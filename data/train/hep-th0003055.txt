    "the ads / cft correspondence conjectures a duality between @xmath8  supersymmetric yang - mills theory in four dimensions and type iia superstring theory on an ads@xmath9  background @xcite .",

    "this also contains the conjecture that the ads@xmath9   background is an exact solution of type iib superstring theory . *",
    "a weaker version asserts a duality of the t  hooft limit of the gauge theory , where @xmath10 with the t  hooft coupling @xmath11 held fixed , and the classical @xmath12 limit of type iia superstring theory on ads@xmath9 . in this correspondence ,",
    "corrections to classical supergravity theory from stringy effects which are of order @xmath13 would agree with corrections to the large t  hooft coupling limit , of order @xmath14 , but higher orders in @xmath15 on the supergravity side and non - planar diagrams on the gauge theory side could disagree . *",
    "an even weaker version is a duality between the t  hooft limit where one also takes the strong coupling limit @xmath16 and the low energy , supergravity limit of type iib superstring theory on ads@xmath9 . in this case",
    ", there would be order @xmath13 and @xmath15 corrections to supergravity which might not agree with order @xmath17 and @xmath14 corrections to @xmath8   supersymmetric yang - mills theory .",
    "even this last , weakest version of the correspondence has profound consequences .",
    "previous to it , the only quantitative tool which could be used to attack supersymmetric yang - mills theory was perturbation theory in @xmath18 , the yang - mills coupling constant .",
    "this is limited to the regime where @xmath18 is small .",
    "furthermore , although some qualitative features of the large @xmath19 limit are known , it is not possible to sum planar diagrams explicitly .",
    "the ads / cft correspondence enables one to compute correlation functions in the large @xmath19 , large @xmath20 limit .",
    "this limit contains the highly nontrivial sum of all planar feynman diagrams , and emphasizes those diagrams which have infinitely many vertices .",
    "because they are inaccessible to perturbation theory , the predictions of the ads / cft correspondence are very difficult to check in any direct way .",
    "the main evidence which supports the correspondence comes from symmetry arguments .",
    "the global symmetries of both @xmath8  supersymmetric yang - mills theory and type iib string theory on ads@xmath9   are identical .",
    "they have the same global super - conformal group @xmath21 ( whose bosonic subgroup is @xmath22 ) . not only are the global symmetries the same , but some of those objects which carry the representations of the symmetry group  the spectrum of chiral operators in the field theory and the fields in supergravity theory  can , to some degree , be matched @xcite . furthermore , both theories are conjectured to have an montonen - olive @xmath23 duality acting on their coupling constants .    the only correlation functions which can be checked directly are correlators which are protected by non - renormalization theorems and thus do not depend on the coupling constant .",
    "these correlators are related to anomalies in the @xmath24 r - symmetry and conformal current algebras .",
    "a number of them have been shown to match @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we sum infinite classes of planar ladder diagrams in @xmath8  supersymmetric yang - mills theory , and compare our results with the predictions of the ads / cft correspondence .",
    "we are for the most part interested in the wilson loop operator .",
    "all computations are in the t  hooft limit where @xmath19 is put to infinity while holding @xmath11 fixed .",
    "we shall not succeed in providing a direct test of the correspondence .",
    "however , we will show that the generic dependence of the loop expectation value on the coupling constant found in the ads / cft computations arises naturally when perturbation theory is summed to all orders and extrapolated to strong coupling .",
    "we also compute the exact weak coupling results to order @xmath3 which , if one takes the strongest version of the ads / cft correspondence seriously , should tell us something about classical superstrings on ads@xmath9  in the strong curvature limit .",
    "we shall also find that leading order corrections to the sum of ladder diagrams vanish for the two simple loops that we study .",
    "the wilson loop operator is a phase factor associated with the trajectory of a heavy quark in the fundamental representation of the gauge group , which in our case is @xmath25 .",
    "the loop operator which couples to classical quantities in the superstring theory in the simplest way provides a source for a classical string @xcite .",
    "it is @xmath26 where @xmath27 is a parameterization of the loop , @xmath28 and @xmath29 is a point on the five dimensional unit sphere ( @xmath30 ) .",
    "this operator measures the holonomy of a heavy w - boson whose mass results from spontaneous breaking of @xmath31 gauge symmetry to @xmath32 . in the ads",
    "/ cft correspondence , it is computed by finding the area of the world - sheet of the classical string in ads@xmath9  whose boundary is the loop @xmath33 , which in turn lies on the boundary of ads@xmath34 @xcite .",
    "the expectation value of the wilson loop operator is easy to compute in perturbation theory @xmath35 for a loop without cusps or self - intersections , this result is finite .",
    "this is because a cancellation occurs between the contributions of the scalar and vector fields .",
    "the case of cusps and self - intersections has been discussed in @xcite .",
    "we work in feynman gauge and consider specific , not necessarily gauge invariant , classes of planar feynman diagrams .",
    "we will comment on the issue of gauge invariance later . in all computations ,",
    "we consider only planar diagrams , thus the coupling constant dependence of all results is in the combination @xmath11 .",
    "@xmath8  supersymmetric yang - mills theory is a conformal field theory for any value of its coupling constant .",
    "this conformal invariance is a result of the fact that the theory has no dimensional coupling constants , so it is conformally invariant at the tree level .",
    "in addition , the high degree of supersymmetry leads to a cancellation of loop corrections to the coupling constant renormalization .",
    "however , as we shall see , the theory does have divergent wave - function renormalization , which does not contradict ultraviolet finiteness , since all divergences can be absorbed by rescaling the fields .",
    "the wilson loop potentially contains its own short - distance singularities which occur when the spacetime arguments of operators in the loop approach each other . in ( [ leadloop ] ) , the divergent contributions of the gauge fields and the scalars mutually cancel .",
    "we shall see in the following that , to order @xmath3 , part of such singularities survive in order to compensate for the infinite wave function renormalization , and all ultraviolet singularities cancel for a generic smooth ( without cusps and self - intersections ) loop .",
    "the wilson loop operator for a single infinite straight line , @xmath36 where @xmath33 is parameterized by @xmath37 , is a bps object : it commutes with half of the sixteen supercharges @xcite .",
    "this residual supersymmetry protects it from obtaining quantum corrections .",
    "it is easy to verify that the first few orders in weak coupling perturbation theory cancel . in the strong coupling limit of planar diagrams ,",
    "the ads / cft correspondence predicts that @xmath38 in fact , this is the case for any array of parallel straight lines with like orientations .      for the circular loop , conformal",
    "invariance predicts that the expectation value of the loop operator is independent of the radius of the loop ) .",
    "we shall see explicitly that this is not the case .",
    "this asymmetry is introduced by the boundary conditions which require that propagators go to zero at infinity . ] .",
    "we find that the sum of all planar feynman diagrams which have no internal vertices ( which includes both rainbow and ladder diagrams ) produces the expression @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the bessel function .",
    "taking the large @xmath11 limit gives @xmath41 which has exponential behavior identical to the prediction of the ads / cft correspondence @xcite , @xmath42    it is intriguing that this sum of a special class of diagrams produces the exact asymptotic behavior that is predicted by the ads / cft correspondence , considering that it does not include any diagrams which have internal vertices . assuming that the ads / cft prediction is indeed the correct asymptotic behavior , there are two possible reasons for this agreement .",
    "first , the corrections to the sum of planar ladder diagrams could produce a term which would be added to ( [ circladder1 ] ) and which would grow no faster than @xmath43 for large @xmath11 .",
    "such a term could modify the prefactor of the exponential but would not modify the exponent .",
    "second , it is possible that corrections to the sum of ladder diagrams cancel and the result ( [ circladder1 ] ) is exact .    in order to explore this appealing possibility ,",
    "we compute the leading order corrections to ( [ circladder1 ] ) coming from diagrams with internal vertices .",
    "these occur at order @xmath3 .",
    "we find that these diagrams do indeed cancel exactly when the spacetime dimension is four .",
    "away from dimension four , there is a residual term of order @xmath44 .",
    "it is tempting to speculate that all higher order corrections from diagrams with internal vertices also cancel . at this point",
    "we have not been able to check this possibility beyond order @xmath3 .",
    "one reason we have to be optimistic is that the circular loop is related to the single straight line by a conformal transformation .",
    "the conformal transformation must not be representable as a unitary operator operating on the loop operator .",
    "otherwise , the expectation value of the circular loop would be one ( identical to the straight line ) and we know this is not the case .",
    "however , for some classes of diagrams , the symmetry could survive . we know",
    "that , for the straight line , the rainbow diagrams , which are what the ladder diagrams are mapped onto , cancel identically .",
    "this clearly does not happen for their conformal images on the circle .",
    "however it could still happen for the diagrams which have internal vertices  which do in fact cancel identically for the straight line wilson loop .",
    "as stated above , we have checked explicitly that this is indeed the case for the leading order @xmath3 corrections .",
    "this has not yet been checked at higher orders .",
    "one important issue is gauge invariance .",
    "the computation of ( [ circladder1 ] ) is in feynman gauge . since only a subset of the diagrams",
    "has been included , there is no guarantee that the calculation is gauge invariant .",
    "in fact , summing diagrams without internal vertices in a different gauge would give a different result .",
    "however , if the corrections indeed vanish then the sum would be equal to the gauge invariant sum of all feynman diagrams on the wilson loop .",
    "the cancellation of the diagrams with internal vertices would then be a special property of the feynman gauge ) vanishes even before integration along the loop . ] .",
    "we have explicitly demonstrated that corrections vanish up to order @xmath3 .",
    "consider a rectangular wilson loop with length @xmath45 and width @xmath46 . in the limit that @xmath47",
    ", the ends can be ignored and the loop can be seen as a pair of anti - parallel lines separated by a distance @xmath46 .",
    "we find that the sum of all planar diagrams without internal vertices , the ladder diagrams , is given by @xmath48,\\qquad g^2n\\ll 1 ;   \\label{asympt1}\\ ] ] and by @xmath49,\\qquad g^2n\\gg 1 .",
    "\\label{asympt2}\\ ] ] here , we use the fact that @xmath47 to ignore any terms in the exponent which are of lower order than @xmath50 .",
    "the logarithm in the exponent of the weak coupling limit ( [ asympt1 ] ) comes from an infrared divergence which appears in the order @xmath3 ladder diagram .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that resummation of these logarithms to all orders replaces the logarithm of @xmath50 by a logarithm of the coupling constant .",
    "we will elaborate on those arguments in section 5 .",
    "logarithms of this kind are known to appear in the wilson loop in qcd at order @xmath51 @xcite . in the weak coupling limit ,",
    "the leading term and the coefficient of the next - to - leading term are indeed gauge invariant .",
    "however , the strong coupling limit depends on the gauge parameter and we have quoted the result ( [ asympt2 ] ) in feynman gauge only ( while the particular constants vary , the generic behavior is still @xmath52 ) .    in the large t",
    "hooft coupling limit , the ads / cft computation in @xcite differs by a factor of @xmath53 from our definition . ]",
    "@xcite @xmath54 comparing this with ( [ asympt2 ] ) , we see that summing only ladder diagrams does not produce ( [ adsasymp2 ] ) .",
    "the failure of this result to agree with the supergravity computation is not very interesting : since the anti - parallel lines are not as closely related to a bps object as a circle , we have no reason to speculate that the sum of ladder diagrams would reproduce the exact strong - coupling behavior .",
    "we also find that the diagrams with internal vertices cancel exactly to the leading order @xmath3 . in this case , as opposed to the circular loop where they only cancel in four dimensions , the cancellation occurs in any number of spacetime dimensions .",
    "the sum over an infinite number of diagrams that we have done produces the strong coupling behavior @xmath55 $ ] which is characteristic of the wilson loops computed using the ads / cft correspondence .",
    "this seems to be the generic behavior of infinite sums of planar ladder diagrams .      in the rest of this paper",
    "we give a detailed derivation of the above results . in section 2 , we give the results of some loop calculations . in section 3 , we prove that ultraviolet singularities cancel to order @xmath3 for any smooth loop . in section 4 , we consider the circular loop .",
    "we compute the sum over ladder diagrams and show that the diagrams with internal vertices cancel to order @xmath3 . in section 5 ,",
    "we give similar arguments for two anti - parallel lines . in section 6 , we summarize some speculations about the implications of our results . in appendix",
    "a , we summarize our notation and conventions and record some useful formulae .",
    "with the exception of section [ canl ] , we use regularization by dimensional reduction throughout this paper .",
    "this procedure considers supersymmetric yang - mills theory in @xmath56 dimensions as a dimensional reduction of @xmath57 supersymmetric yang - mills theory in ten dimensions . in this scheme ,",
    "the gauge field @xmath58 is a @xmath56 component vector field .",
    "the index of the scalar field runs over @xmath59 values , @xmath60 . in every dimension , the fermion field has sixteen real components .",
    "regularization by dimensional reduction preserves the sixteen supersymmetries of the ten dimensional yang - mills theory .",
    "these lead to four conserved four component majorana spinor supercharges in four dimensions .",
    "this regularization scheme provides a supersymmetric regularization of the four dimensional theory .",
    "since the gauge coupling becomes dimensional in any spacetime dimension other than four , the regularization breaks conformal symmetry explicitly .",
    "it also modifies the r - symmetry .",
    "consider the one loop self - energies of the vector and scalar field .",
    "the dimension of space - time is @xmath61 .",
    "all of the loop integrals are elementary and can be found in reference books such as @xcite .",
    "we parameterize the wilson loop by @xmath62 , and abbreviate @xmath63 .",
    "the vector field obtains self - energy corrections from :    * @xmath64 colors of vector fields and ghost fields : @xmath65 * @xmath59 real scalar fields in the adjoint representation : @xmath66 * four flavors of four - component majorana fermions in the adjoint representation : @xmath67    note that these are the negative of the conventionally defined self - energies .",
    "thus , to one loop order , the propagator for the unrenormalized gluon , in feynman gauge is @xmath68    similarly , we can compute the one loop correction to the scalar propagator .",
    "it obtains corrections from :    * the scalar - vector intermediate state : @xmath69 * and the fermion loop : @xmath70    thus , to one loop order , the ( unrenormalized ) scalar propagator is @xmath71 note that , aside from vector indices , the scalar and vector propagators are identical . also , note that the self - energy corrections have poles at @xmath72 which arise from an ultraviolet divergence .",
    "if we were to compute correlators of local renormalized fields , it would be necessary to add a counterterm to the action in order to cancel these ultraviolet singularities . here ,",
    "for purpose of computing the wilson loop , we leave them unrenormalized .      the ladder - like diagrams to order @xmath3 contribute @xmath73 this result is finite when @xmath62 is a smooth curve .",
    "using the one loop self - energies of the vector and scalar fields that we found in section 2.2 , we can find the corrections to the expression ( [ leadloop ] ) resulting from insertion of one loop into the vector and scalar field propagators .",

    "this integral is singular in the limit @xmath99 .",

    "the limit where @xmath100 and @xmath101 are coincident is then equivalent to the limit of infinite @xmath103 . without the infrared cutoff",
    "the integral would diverge logarithmically , so up to terms regular in the limit @xmath106 , we get @xmath107 since @xmath108 only goes as a logarithm as points approach each other , ( [ 3part ] ) receives divergent contributions only from @xmath100 near @xmath101 ; the parts of the integral with @xmath100 or @xmath101 near @xmath109 are finite .",

    "it is well known that each planar graph will contain the same group theoretical factors @xcite .",
    "we observe that , in fact , each planar diagram without internal vertices gives an identical contribution to the loop expectation value .",
