    "the physical and chemical state in the interstellar medium ( ism ) continuously changes through the combination of star formation and stellar death ( cox & smith 1974 ; jenkins & meloy 1974 ; mckee 1990 ; thornton et al .",
    "1998 ; marri & white 2004 ) .",
    "the evolution of a galaxy is governed to a large extent by these processes .",
    "the final stages of star formation involve the disruption of interstellar material from which the stars formed .",
    "if enough material is available in interstellar clouds forming o and b stars , one generation of stars can lead to the formation of a second generation , and so forth , but eventually the cloud remnants can no longer sustain star formation .",
    "the propagation of star formation occurs in regions of enhanced gas density behind shocks ( e.g. elmegreen & lada 1977 ; mckee & tan 2003 ) . early type ( o and b ) stars are associated with stellar winds , expanding regions , and supernova explosions that lead to shocks in the surrounding medium . since these stars tend to form in clusters ( clark et al .",
    "2005 ) , the effects are magnified as seen in the magellanic clouds . clearly ,",
    "knowledge of the physical conditions and chemical composition of the ism in star - forming regions will help us understand the above processes and their effects on the evolution of the ism and the galaxy .",
    "high - resolution optical observations of interstellar absorption ( e.g. , welty & hobbs 2001 ; pan et al .",
    "2004 , hereafter paper i ) have revealed complex velocity structure on many galactic lines of sight , especially on sight lines through star - forming clouds .",
    "determination of the physical properties of individual interstellar clouds from observations of absorption lines requires high spectral resolution to distinguish the individual components contributing to the generally complex line profiles .",
    "furtheremore , ultraviolet ( uv ) spectra provide considerable information on abundances and general physical conditions in the ism ( e.g. , spitzer & jenkins 1975 ) . in paper",
    "i , we presented high - resolution optical spectra of interstellar cn , ch , ch@xmath3 , , , and absorption along 29 lines of sight in three star - forming regions , @xmath4 oph , cep ob2 , and cep ob3 .",
    "we obtained velocity component structure by simultaneously analyzing the spectra of the six species along a given sightline .",
    "column densities and doppler parameters of the individual velocity components were derived through profile fitting . to complement the results of the optical survey , presented in paper i , we here present an analysis of far ultraviolet ( fuv ) spectra of 15 of the stars in that sample .",
    "the fuv data were either acquired in dedicated observing programs or extracted from the existing data archives of the _ far ultraviolet spectroscopic explorer _ ( fuse ) and _ hubble space telescope / space telescope imaging spectrograph _",
    "( hst / stis ) .",
    "the main contribution of the present paper is an analysis of the results from paper i and those for h@xmath0 and co in terms of cloud structure for gas with densities of 10 to 1500 @xmath5 .",
    "we emphasize that our data for the diffuse molecular gas associated with the three star - forming regions probe the large - scale structure of the parent molecular cloud as it disperses .",
    "we investigate whether a connection exists between the levels of star formation and conditions in the surrounding diffuse gas .",
    "the remainder of the paper has the following outline .",
    "the next section gives a brief background of the three star - forming regions , and @xmath6 3 describes the fuv observations and their analysis .",
    "a comparison of doppler parameters is the focus of @xmath6 4 . in @xmath6 5 ,",
    "we examine correlations between column densities of different species .",
    "a chemical analysis is performed in @xmath6 6 to derive gas densities for components with ch and cn .",
    "the analysis utilizes available results for c@xmath0 from the literature .",
    "the amount of h@xmath0 excitation and its relationship to the chemical results is described here also .",
    "this is followed by a discussion on the distribution of species within clouds , on large- and small - scale cloud structures , and a comparison of general properties for the molecular gas in the three star - forming regions .",
    "the final section presents a summary of our work .",
    "the divergence in the modes of star formation is perhaps best understood in terms of the physical properties of the molecular cloud and environmental effects such as nearby regions .",
    "oph , cep ob2 , and cep ob3 are three regions that provide fruitful laboratories for the investigation of cloud dispersal as a result of star formation . our data on diffuse molecular gas , whose @xmath7 velocities are similar to those of the radio - emitting clouds , probe the later stages of dispersal . extensive studies ( e.g. , sargent 1979 ; de geus , bronfman , & thaddeus 1990 ; patel et al .",
    "1998 ) on these regions outlined basic properties for the cloud complexes .",
    "the region around the star @xmath4 oph , also called the @xmath4 oph molecular cloud , is a well - known concentration of dark nebulae and molecular clouds with a size of about 6@xmath85 pc@xmath9 , a total molecular mass of 80 @xmath10 ( de geus et al . 1990 ) , and at a distance of 140 pc .",
    "one of its prominent characteristics is the extremely active star formation in the cloud core , where stars are heavily clustered with an estimated star - forming efficiency @xmath11 20% ( cf .",
    "green & young 1992 ; doppmann et al .",
    "2003 ; phelps & barsony 2004 ) . radio observations ( loren 1989 ; de geus et al . 1990 ) showed that co molecules mainly exist within a velocity range of @xmath12 1.55.0 km s@xmath13 , and that the cloud forms the boundary between the bulk of the ophiuchus molecular gas and the upper - scorpius stellar groups .",
    "the @xmath4 oph molecular cloud is part of the ophiuchus molecular clouds , a filamentary system of clouds with a total molecular mass of 10@xmath14 @xmath10 ( de geus 1992 ) .",
    "the ophiuchus molecular clouds , in turn , belong to a larger cloud complex that is associated with the scorpio - centaurus ob association .",
    "this ob association consists of three subgroups , lower - centaurus crux ( lcc ) , upper - centaurus lupus ( ucl ) , and upper - scorpius ( us ) .",
    "blaauw ( 1958 ) showed that the three subgroups are separated in position and age , and that the youngest subgroup lies in upper - scorpius , which is adjacent to the @xmath4 oph molecular cloud .",
    "based on photometric measurements , de geus , de zeeuw , & lub ( 1989 ) derived ages of 1112 , 1415 , and 56 myr for the three subgroups , respectively . somewhat surprisingly , they found that the middle subgroup , ucl , is the oldest one .",
    "they argued that either the classic picture of sequential star formation ( blaauw 1964 ; elmegreen & lada 1977 ) is not valid for the sco ob2 association as a whole because the oldest subgroup is inbetween the two younger ones , or for some unknown reason , massive star formation was initiated near the middle of the original giant molecular cloud .",
    "however , pan ( 2002 ) conjectured that lcc and ucl may actually have a similar age .",
    "more recently , sartori , lepine , & dias ( 2003 ) found that the us subgroup is 48 myr old and that ucl and lcc have the same age , 16 - 20 myr .",
    "a region of enhanced infrared emission associated with cep ob2 shows the location of a giant ring - shaped cloud system , the so called cepheus bubble .",
    "the distance of the bubble is somewhat uncertain .",
    "earlier measurements indicated distances from 700 to 900 pc ( garrison & kormendy 1976 ; kun , balazs , & toth 1987 ) . recently ,",
    "de zeeuw et al . ( 1999 ) determined the distances of nearby ob associations using proper motion and parallaxes measured by hipparcos .",
    "they obtained a distance of 615 pc for cep ob2 .",
    "as de zeeuw et al . noticed , their distances are systematically smaller than the previous photometric determinations . if a distance of 750 pc is adopted , the ring - shaped cloud system has a diameter of about 120 pc and the total molecular mass for the system is about 10@xmath15 @xmath10 ( patel et al .",
    "a dozen star - forming regions have been identified in the rim of the bubble .",
    "each star - forming region has a size of a few pc , similar to that of the @xmath4 oph region , and total molecular mass of about 10@xmath16 @xmath10 .",
    "some large star - forming regions consist of several star - forming globules .",
    "for instance , ic 1396 includes at least four star - forming globules with a total mass of about 2200 @xmath10 and a size of 12 pc ( patel et al .",
    "1995 ) ; weikard et al .",
    "( 1996 ) reached similar conclusions .",
    "based on measurements of co emission , patel et al .",
    "( 1998 ) proposed that the bubble was created by stellar winds , and likely supernova explosions , from now deceased stars in the cluster ngc 7160 as well as the evolved stars , vv cep and @xmath17 cep , in the region .",
    "patel et al . ( 1998 ) suggested that these stars were the first generation formed .",
    "the first generation stars have an age of about 13 - 18 myr .",
    "after about @xmath2 7 myr , the expanding shell reached a size of about 30 pc and became unstable .",
    "the instability led to the formation of a second generation of stars , current numbers of cep ob2 , which are about @xmath2 7 myr old .",
    "the iras point sources in the globules and molecular clouds associated with the bubble are the third generation , whose formation was triggered by stellar winds from cep ob2 stars . from 21 cm data , abraham , balazs & kun ( 2000 ) obtained a similar picture for the formation of the bubble .",
    "the latter model showed that a supernova explosion might have occurred as recently as about 2 myr ago .",
    "the explosion expanded the pre - existing bubble further .",
    "the molecular clouds producing the cep ob3 association represent a filamentary system , showing clumpy and irregular structure ( sargent 1977 , 1979 ) .",
    "the cloud system is located at a distance of about 700800 pc ( garrison 1970 ; moreno - corral et al .",
    "1993 ) , with a size of @xmath2 60@xmath820 pc@xmath9 and a total molecular mass of @xmath2 10@xmath14 @xmath10 ( sargent 1979 ) .",
    "a few identified star - forming regions are embedded in the cloud system .",
    "the star - forming regions in this cloud system have a size similar to those in the cepheus bubble ( a few pc ) , but have smaller total molecular mass ( 100500 @xmath10 ) .",
    "our lines of sight toward cep ob3 probe two star - forming regions in the cloud system , cepheus b and cepheus f , with total molecular mass of 100 and 300 , respectively ( yu et al . 1996 ) .",
    "the cep ob3 association consists of two subgroups separated by @xmath2 13 pc on the plane of the sky .",
    "based on photometric measurements , blaauw ( 1964 ) assigned ages of 8 and 4 myr to the two subgroups .",
    "however , ages derived from such isochrone fitting must be treated with caution in young ob associations because masses and ages remain model dependent .",
    "consequently , the shape of both the evolutionary tracks and of the isochrones change from one model to another , leading to discrepancies in the age estimates .",
    "much lower ages for the younger subgroup can be found in the literature .",
    "for instance , garmany ( 1973 ) and assousa , herbst & turner ( 1977 ) obtained an age of @xmath2 1 myr for it .",
    "sargent ( 1979 ) suggested that the formation of the younger group was triggered by the interaction between stellar winds of the older subgroup and the original molecular cloud .",
    "in paper i , we presented observational data for interstellar cn , ch , ch@xmath3 , , , and absorption on 29 directions in @xmath4 oph , cep ob2 , and cep ob3 . to complement these results , we obtained and analyzed fuv data for h@xmath0 and co. eight stars from the sample in paper",
    "i were observed with _ fuse _ under our programs a051 and b030 . for each star , reduction and calibration",
    "were performed using calfuse v2.4 .",
    "we then re - binned the data by a factor of 4 , yielding a two - pixel resolution element of @xmath2 0.06  .",
    "_ fuse _ archival data for two more stars , hd  206773 and hd  217312 , were downloaded from programs b071 and p193 , respectively .",
    "four additional stars have been studied before ; we used their published h@xmath0 column density , @xmath18(h@xmath0 ) , and @xmath19 results from rachford et al .",
    "( 2003 ) ( under _ fuse _ program p116 ) .",
    "although no published h@xmath0 results are available for hd  208266 , we included this star in our analysis because there were ch and co observations .",
    "moreover , these data can be utilized in tandem to predict @xmath18(h@xmath0 ) toward hd  208266 .",
    "table 1 lists all fuv datasets that we utilized , specifying which space telescope was the source , what s / n was obtained , and which molecules were analyzed .",
    "three @xmath20 bands of h@xmath0 ( 2@xmath210 , 3@xmath210 , and 4@xmath210 , between 1042 and 1083  ) were chosen to model the molecule s column density .",
    "this range is covered by the four overlapping _ fuse _ detector segments , lif-1a , lif-2b , sic-1a , and sic-2b , although 2@xmath210 is not covered by lif-2b . each segment was fitted independently with the code ismod , which uses the simplex method to minimize the rms of the residuals down to about 10@xmath22 in relative parameter steps .",
    "the fit was based on the ch cloud components in paper i , preserving the velocity separations and relative fractions in column density among components as fixed input . we , however , allowed the @xmath23-values to vary during the fits , constraining them by the mass ratio of ch to h@xmath0 and by the kinetic temperature ( @xmath24 ) in the gas as given by the ( fitted ) @xmath19 rotational temperature of h@xmath0 ( see @xmath6 6.2 ) .",
    "both the thermal and non - thermal components of the velocity field were thus determined .",
    "free parameters included the total column density , @xmath18(h@xmath0 ) , radial velocity of h@xmath0 , six rotational temperatures relative to the ground state , @xmath25@xmath26 , and the placement of the stellar continuum .",
    "our final h@xmath0 model and the associated uncertainties were computed by averaging the results from fits of the four independent segments . in a few cases of high - j levels , where one of the four segment yielded a deviant result , that value was not included in the final average .",
    "the values of total @xmath18(h@xmath0 ) are very robust and practically independent of the cloud structure because of the damping wings for the @xmath27@xmath28 = 0 and 1 lines .    for determinations of co column density",
    ", we first searched the _",
    "hst_/stis archive and downloaded high - resolution observations of @xmath29 bands of co. six stars happen to have e140h data with r @xmath30 100,000 , covering @xmath29 bands blueward of @xmath2 1360   ( transitions 7@xmath210 and higher ) .",
    "for the ismod fits , we used @xmath31-values from chan , cooper & brion ( 1993 ) , see also morton and noreau ( 1994 ) .",
    "these values are within a few percent of those recommended by eidelsberg et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , except for the @xmath31-value for 11@xmath210 where chan et al.s value is 11% smaller .",
    "the higher _",
    "hst_/stis resolution allowed us to derive relative cloud strengths as well .",
    "when the co along a line of sight is relatively weak , not enough fitting leverage is available from the @xmath29 bands alone . in such cases we expanded the analysis to include simultaneous fits of rydberg bands from the _ fuse _ data with r @xmath32 17,500 .",
    "for co toward hd  203374a , our simultaneous fits of @xmath29 and rydberg bands were published in sheffer , federman , & andersson ( 2003 ) .",
    "an additional three stars have medium - resolution data from the e140 m grating ( r = 46,000 ) . despite the lower resolution ,",
    "robust fits are reliably obtainable in these cases because the spectral coverage includes 14 @xmath29 bands down to the lowest s / n region around ly-@xmath33 .",
    "nevertheless , in our fits we employed at most six bands for simultaneous solutions , making sure to include bands spanning the largest possible range in @xmath31-value . adding more bands to the fit",
    "did not change the results significantly .",
    "finally , for the six stars without any archival _ hst_/stis data , our co modeling was based solely on the three rydberg bands , @xmath20 0@xmath210 , @xmath34 0@xmath210 , and @xmath35 0@xmath210",
    ". understandably , the inferred co component structure for these stars are less reliable than for those from @xmath29 bands , due to the lower resolution of _ fuse _ and the limited range in @xmath31-values sampled , which were based on the results of federman et al .",
    ". however , since the @xmath20 0@xmath210 band is relatively optically thin , the total @xmath18(co ) is approximately independent of the cloud structure .",
    "the derived total h@xmath0 and co column densities along the fifteen lines of sight are listed in table 2 , along with the kinetic temperature ( @xmath19 ) of h@xmath0 . for comparison",
    ", we also tabulate ch column densities from paper i and abundance ratios ( ch / h@xmath0 and co / h@xmath0 ) along these sight lines .",
    "table 3 provides the column densities for individual h@xmath0 rotational levels .",
    "the doppler parameters , @xmath23-values , of individual absorption components seen for any individual species provide upper limits on the temperature and internal turbulent velocity ( @xmath36 ) in the interstellar gas because @xmath37 . if two species with significantly different atomic weight @xmath38 coexist in the same volume of gas , comparison of their @xmath23-values provides estimates of the relative contributions of thermal and turbulent broadening , if both lines are fully resolved . alternately , known temperatures and turbulent velocities for two species can allow estimates of their relative volumetric distributions .",
    "the extracted @xmath23-values in the present paper , except for cn @xmath23-values from the doublet ratio method in this section , are based on gaussian instrumental widths .",
    "earlier studies suggested that cn resides in denser regions whereas ch@xmath3 is found mainly in regions of lower density ( cardelli et al .",
    "1990 ; federman et al .",
    "the ch molecule , on the other hand , can be present in both low- and high - density gas ( 100 vs. 600 @xmath39 ) .",
    "it can be synthesized through the non - equilibrium ch@xmath3 chemistry in low density diffuse clouds ( draine & katz 1986 ; zsarg & federman 2003 ) , and in moderately dense gas it is produced via c@xmath3 + h@xmath40 ch@xmath41 ( federman et al .",
    "however , it is not a trivial task to disentangle the amount of ch formed with ch@xmath3 or associated with cn . examining ch@xmath3like ch and cn  like ch components may elucidate the chemical schemes occurring in the gas ( lambert , sheffer , & crane 1990 ) . of our 125 ch components , there were 12 cn  like ch components , which are ch components with corresponding cn , but no ch@xmath3 [ @xmath18(ch@xmath1 ) @xmath42 @xmath43 , at the same @xmath44 , and 78 ch@xmath3like ch components , ch components with detected ch@xmath3 at the same v@xmath45 but no cn [ @xmath18(cn ) @xmath46 @xmath43 .",
    "typically , ch@xmath1 and cn column densities are 7 times greater than these limits .",
    "table 4 presents average @xmath23-values of the ch@xmath3-like ch and the cn - like ch components , along with mean doppler parameters of all defined components for other species .",
    "the analysis reveals that cn - like ch components have an average @xmath23-value indistinguishable from that of cn components ( 0.83 @xmath47 0.11 km s@xmath13 vs. 0.90 @xmath47 0.11 km s@xmath13 ) , whereas ch@xmath1-like ch components possess a larger average @xmath23-value ( 1.10 @xmath47 0.16 km s@xmath13 ) .",
    "simple statistical tests show that the average @xmath23-values for a given species agree within their mutual uncertainties in the diffuse gas surronding different star - forming regions , although cep ob3 seems to have consistently larger @xmath23-values than @xmath4 oph and cep ob2 . since thermal broadening plays a minor role ,",
    "our results indicate that cloud turbulence in the three regions does not differ significantly .",
    "compared with earlier studies , our average @xmath23-values of atomic species ( table 4 ) are slightly greater than those obtained from very high - resolution spectra of interstellar atomic lines .",
    "based on spectra with resolution of 0.3 - 0.6 km s@xmath13 , welty and colleagues obtained median @xmath23-values of 0.66 km s@xmath13 for components ( welty , hobbs , & morton 2003 ) , 0.67 km s@xmath13 for ( welty & hobbs 2001 ) , and 1.33 km s@xmath13 for components",
    "( welty , morton , & hobbs 1996 ) .",
    "three causes may lead to the differences .",
    "their spectra had much higher resolution than ours so that they could discern more closely blended components which we did not , different lines of sight were probed , and the median values are slightly smaller than corresponding average values .",
    "( for example , the median @xmath23 is 0.66 km s@xmath13 while the corresponding average is 0.70 km s@xmath13 for well defined components . ) with a resolution of @xmath2 0.50 km s@xmath13 , andersson , wannier , & crawford ( 2002 ) obtained spectra of interstellar ch absorption toward 18 stars in southern molecular cloud envelopes .",
    "based on f - tests ( lupton 1993 ) , they fitted all but one of these ch profiles with a single - velocity component .",
    "( however , they noticed that additional velocity components may be present ) .",
    "their @xmath23-values range from 0.3 to 3.6 km s@xmath13 , with an average of 1.7 km s@xmath13 .",
    "this mean @xmath23-value is greater than ours , 1.04 km s@xmath13 ( table 4 ) .",
    "because we simultaneously analyzed the spectra of six species along a given sightline ( paper i ) , in general , we found more ch velocity components per line of sight .",
    "this is one of the reasons , if not main one , that our average @xmath23 value is smaller than theirs .",
    "based on ultra - high - resolution ( @xmath48v @xmath2 0.35 km s@xmath13 ) observations along five lines of sight , crawford ( 1995 ) found average @xmath23-values of 0.63 , 1.5 , 2.3 , and 0.8 km s@xmath13 for cn , ch , ch@xmath1 , and components .",
    "overall , our average doppler parameters are in agreement with those determined by previous studies using spectra with higher resolution .    the @xmath23-value of a cn component can also be derived by using the doublet ratio ( strmgren 1948 )  see also gredel , van dishoeck , & black ( 1991 ) .",
    "because cn @xmath49(1 ) and @xmath50(1 ) absorption lines arise from the same rotational level , @xmath51=1 , the same column density should be inferred from them .",
    "therefore , the @xmath23-value of a cn component can be determined by performing a curve of growth analysis on the @xmath49(1 ) and @xmath50(1 ) values of @xmath52 and requiring they give the same column density and @xmath23-value . to check @xmath23-values of cn components derived from the profile fitting in paper i",
    ", we applied the doublet ratio method to eleven components where both cn @xmath49(1 ) and @xmath50(1 ) lines were detected and obtained an average @xmath23-value of 0.70 @xmath47 0.14 km s@xmath13 , which is closer to that of crawford ( 1995 ) based on ultra - high - resolution spectra .",
    "considering the uncertainties , it also agrees with the mean doppler parameter in table 4 , which we determined from profile fitting .",
    "once the @xmath23-value of a cn component is determined , column densities of rotational levels of @xmath51=0 [ from cn @xmath49(0 ) ] and @xmath51=1 [ from cn @xmath49(1 ) and @xmath50(1 ) ] can be derived by using a curve of growth .",
    "knowing columns of these rotational levels allows us to obtain the cn excitation temperature , @xmath53 , of cn components .",
    "@xmath53 is governed by the boltzmann equation ,    @xmath54   \\right)^{-1}=\\frac{5.442}{ln\\left[3n(0)/n(1)\\right]},\\ ] ]    where @xmath55 is the energy separation between rotational levels @xmath51=0 and @xmath51=1 , while @xmath56 and @xmath18 are the statistical weight and column density for each level .",
    "the derived cn excitation temperatures for these eleven components range from 2.55 k to 2.89 k with an average of 2.75 @xmath47 0.10 k. the derived excitation temperatures indicate that no significant excitation in addition to that due to the cmb is observed in these cloudlets , including three components toward hd  204827 where very strong cn absorption is detected and @xmath53 is between 2.72 and 2.78 k.    the @xmath23-values in table 4 for co toward cep ob2 and ob3 are most like those for cn , suggesting that these species coexist in the diffuse molecular gas probed by optical absorption . there is also a hint that the @xmath23-values for cep ob3 are larger , as seen in other species , but in the case of co , the difference could be the result of coarser resolution in @xmath57 spectra for the stars in cep ob3 .",
    "other evidence makes the connection between co and cn stronger .",
    "first , while the input for the synthesis of co bands was based on the component structure seen in ch , the best fit revealed a component structure very similar to that for cn .",
    "this is illustrated in table 5 , where the @xmath58 deviations between co and ch relative column density fractions on the one hand and between co and cn on the other are presented for syntheses based on stis spectra .",
    "along each line of sight , the @xmath58 deviations are smaller for cn than for ch .",
    "the correspondence is not perfect , however , because co and ch are detected in cases where only upper limits for cn are available ( e.g. , crenny & federman 2004 ) .",
    "second , there is an approximate linear relationship between @xmath18(co ) and @xmath18(cn ) for individual velocity components .",
    "since upper limits exist for both quantities , correlations were sought through the use of the package asurv , revision 1.1 ( see isobe , feigelson , & nelson 1986 ; isobe & feigelson 1990 ; la valley , isobe , & feigelson 1992 ) .",
    "using schmitt s method , we obtain log[@xmath18(co ) ] @xmath59 ( @xmath60 ) log[@xmath18(cn ) ] @xmath61 ( @xmath62 ) .",
    "this analysis suggests that all but 3 of 24 limits are consistent with detections .",
    "when all data are treated as detections , schmitt s method gives a slope of @xmath63 and an intercept of @xmath21(@xmath64 ) and a linear least - squares fit indicates respective values of @xmath65 and @xmath21(@xmath66 ) .",
    "the slopes are steeper when all data are considered detections because the upper limits on cn are less confining .",
    "each of these observational effects show that columns of co and cn are tightly coupled in the denser portions of diffuse molecular clouds , a conclusion consistent with our earlier findings ( zsarg & federman 2003 ; crenny & federman 2004 ) .",
    "comparisons of column densities for different species provide constraints on chemical models , elemental depletions , species distributions , and the processes contributing to the ionization in diffuse clouds ( e.g. , hobbs 1976 ; chaffee & white 1982 ; federman et al .",

    "if only components with log[@xmath18(ch@xmath1 ) ] @xmath71 12.6 are considered , column densities of the two species are not well correlated .",

    "our findings explain why different correlations were seen in these studies . because many of the sight lines in the study of crane et al .",

    "it is possible that their amounts of cn are overestimated because columns of about 0.4 @xmath73 cm @xmath75 represent marginal detections .",
    "as one can see from figure 1 , the @xmath18(ch@xmath1-like ch ) vs. @xmath18(ch@xmath1 ) relationship shows quite a bit of scatter .",
    "this scatter may cause the three components to be outliers as well .",
    "use of ch@xmath1-corrected ch interestingly does improve the correlation compared to the original @xmath18(cn ) vs. @xmath18(ch ) plot .",
    "the correlation coefficient slightly increases from 0.80 to 0.86 .",
    "as one can see from figure 2 and table 6 , the regression is now very similar to that for @xmath18(cn ) vs. @xmath18(cn - like ch ) .",
    "this analysis indicates that our assumption is a reasonable one . in other words , we conclude that there are two kinds of ch in diffuse molecular clouds : cn - like ch and ch@xmath1-like ch . disentangling the amount of ch in each appears possible when utilizing the relation between columns of ch@xmath1-like ch and ch@xmath1 . in the past , only ultra - high resolution observations toward @xmath76 oph ( lambert et al .",
    "1990 ; crawford 1997 ) distinguished between these two possibilities .",
    "welty & hobbs ( 2001 ) found an essentially linear relationship between @xmath18 ( ) and @xmath18(ch ) by using total column densities along lines of sight .",
    "based on column densities for individual velocity components , we obtain a very similar correlation , with a slope of 0.96 @xmath47 0.04 , as shown in the upper panel of figure 3 .",

    "this also implies that they generally coexist , at least in the density range sampled by these data .",
    "however , we also note that there are exceptions . a few components with reasonable strengths do not have corresponding ch components .",
    "for instance , the velocity component at @xmath77 4.3 km s@xmath13 toward hd 216532 has a column density of 3.2 @xmath8 10@xmath78 @xmath74 , but no detected ch .",
    "however , there are relatively strong and lines with column densities of 5.2 @xmath8 10@xmath79 @xmath74 and 10.0 @xmath8 10@xmath78 @xmath74 , respectively . considering",
    "the @xmath23-value of the component , 1.5 km s@xmath13 , is greater than the average value of 0.92 km s@xmath13 ( as is the case for the and component ) , we think this component may arise from a slightly lower density region where no significant amount of ch is present , but one with a relatively large volume so that a reasonably strong line is observed . in other words , this may indicate that could be distributed in less dense regions where no observable amount of ch resides .",
    "the lower panel of figure 3 presents the relationship between @xmath18 ( ) and @xmath18 ( ) .",
    "the figure shows that the column densities of the two species are well correlated .",
    "however , the best fit slope of 0.60 @xmath47 0.04 , indicated by the solid line in the plot , is significantly smaller than 1.0 . compared with the relationship of welty et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , which was based on total column densities , our best fit slope is the same as theirs ( 0.60 @xmath47 0.08 ) while the scatter and the intercept ( 2.88 @xmath47 0.47 versus 3.11 @xmath47 0.68 ) are slightly smaller .",
    "welty et al . ( 2003 ) discussed possibilities that could lead to a slope less than unity for the comparison between log[@xmath18 ( ) ] and log[@xmath18 ( ) ] .",
    "they concluded that it is most likely that calcium depletion has a steeper dependence on local density than does potassium depletion .",
    "this is not all that unexpected because calcium is a refractory element while potassium is more volatile , having lower condensation temperature .",
    "once again , three facts , the good correspondence in column density , similar average @xmath23-values ( see table 4 ) , and the similar correlations between relationships based on individual components and on lines of sight , suggest that these two species generally share comparable volumes .",
    "in addition to above the correlations , table 6 also lists relationships for log[@xmath18 ( ) ] vs. log[@xmath18 ( ) ] and log[@xmath18 ( ) ] vs. log[@xmath18 ( ) ] .",
    "column densities of these species are correlated although not as tightly as the relationships above , with about twice the scatter .",
    "the column density ratios can differ by a factor of 10 for individual components .",
    "such a large range in column density ratios may indicate that these species do not track each other well .",
    "in other words , they seem to be probing different portions of a cloud . there are actually many components without corresponding or .",
    "this latter fact arises because is believed to be distributed more broadly ( welty et al .",

    "our starting point for the directions in cep ob2 for @xmath84 was 2@xmath86 .",

    "this suggests that ch could coexist with either cn and ch@xmath1 .",
    "since in all velocity components where cn is detected , ch is observed , we believe that ch exists in the whole volume where cn resides . on the other hand , generally wider profiles , more components , and larger @xmath23-values indicate that ch occupies a larger volume than does cn .",
    "similarities in @xmath23-values , aod profiles , and a good correlation between their column densities all suggest that ch and generally coexist , or share a large fraction of their volumes in diffuse clouds .",
    "the combined set of facts leads us to believe that these two species can also exist in less dense gas , or less dense regions of clouds ( such as envelopes ) where cn is not present .",

    "the ion is the most widely distributed among the observed species ; it can exist in moderately high - density regions but favors a relatively low density environment .",
    "several correlations and analyses show that both ca and k may be depleted onto grains in denser gas , and that the ca depletion has a steeper dependence on local density . within the framework of cardelli",
    "et al ( 1991 ) , our data suggest that ca column density varies roughly as @xmath104 , whereas k column is proportional to @xmath105 due to their depletions",
    ". however , we note that their assumptions involving space densities and column densities may not be applicable .",
    "gas densities for individual velocity components where cn is detected were inferred from a chemical model .",
    "the inferred gas densities are independent of assumptions about cloud shape , on which some previous calculations relied . based on these derived gas densities",
    ", we examined the large- and small - scale structure of clouds .",
    "in general , our data are consistent with the large - scale structure suggested by maps of co radio emission .",
    "our analysis reveals the presence of variations in gas density among sight lines in two multiple star systems , @xmath4 oph and hd  206267 .",
    "the gas density is seen to vary by factors of 510 over scales of @xmath2 10,000 au .",
    "this indicates that observed column density variations are due in part to a change in gas density .",
    "however , variations of the order of 10@xmath14 suggested by 21 cm observations ( e.g. , frail et al .",
    "1994 ) must have a different origin .",
    "cloud thicknesses for individual components ( cloudlets ) are estimated to be @xmath2 1pc , which may suggest that some of the cloudlets are sheet - like with aspect ratios of 5 to 10 .",
    "the estimation of cloud thickness provides evidence for the need to consider non - spherical geometries ( heiles 1997 ) when analyzing small - scale structure in diffuse clouds .",
    "comparisons show that there are both similarities and differences in general characteristics of diffuse gas in the three star - forming regions , @xmath4 oph , cep ob2 and cep ob3 .",
    "for example , cloud turbulence in the three regions does not differ significantly ( but note that cep ob3 seems to have consistently larger @xmath23-values than @xmath4 oph and cep ob2 ) .",
    "clouds in cep ob2 and cep ob3 have more complex ( clumpy ) structures than those in @xmath4 oph ; in other words , material in @xmath4 oph is more compact than in cep ob2 and cep ob2 .",
    "the molecular cloudlets associated with cep ob3 have lower gas density and lower total molecular mass , compared to those associated with @xmath4 oph and cep ob2 .",
    "the differences may be related to the star formation histories for the regions .",
    "this paper presents analyses of the physical and chemical structure of the diffuse gas in star - forming regions based on absorption at visible and uv wavelengths . as in federman",
    "et al . ( 1997 ) and knauth et al . ( 2001 ) , such analyses provide results for foreground diffuse molecular gas that are both consistent and complement results of the denser gas probed at longer wavelength .",
    "the combined set of data yields a comprehensive view of the effects of star formation on molecular clouds .",
