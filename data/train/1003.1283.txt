    "the enigmas of dark matter and cosmic acceleration have motivated the exploration of theories where gravity is  modified \" at large distances . on the other hand ,",
    "the range of possibilities for constructing such theories is severely limited by the requirement of general covariance , and for that reason , most of the proposed alternatives to general relativity ( gr ) can in fact be cast as gr coupled to new fields .",
    "cosmic acceleration may be due to a scalar field slowly rolling down a potential @xcite , or simply sitting in one of its local minima @xcite .",
    "alternatively , it can be driven by the non - minimal kinetic term of a k - essence scalar field with a lagrangian of the form @xmath0 , where @xmath1 .",
    "this form is quite versatile , and can be used to mimic cosmic fluids with a wide range of possibilities for the effective equation of state and speed of sound , including those which are characteristic of dark energy and cold dark matter @xcite .",
    "the gradient of the k - essence field , @xmath2 , is a time - like vector which spontaneously breaks lorentz invariance , in a way that is parametrically independent of its effects on the time evolution of the background geometry . in particular ,",
    "lorentz invariance can be spontaneously broken by @xmath3 while the background spacetime remains maximally symmetric , a situation which is known as ghost condensation @xcite .",
    "still , the  fluid \" responds to the gravitational pull of ordinary matter , leading to modifications of the long range potentials .",
    "more generally , theories with a massive graviton can be written in a covariant form as gr coupled to a set of  stckelberg \" scalar fields @xmath4 with non - minimal kinetic terms , whose gradients have non - vanishing expectation values @xcite .",
    "depending on the interactions and the expectation values of the condensates , this can describe different phases of massive gravity . aside from the lorentz preserving fierz - pauli phase @xcite ( see also @xcite ) , lorentz breaking phases have been investigated in @xcite . some of these have interesting phenomenology , such as the absence of ghosts in the linearized spectrum , a massive graviton with just two transverse polarizations , and weak gravitational potentials which differ from those in standard gr by terms proportional to the square of the graviton mass @xcite .",
    "additional fields of spin 2 have been considered in bi - gravity ( or multi - gravity ) theories @xcite , where space - time is endowed with several metrics interacting with each other non - derivatively . due to general covariance ,",
    "only one of the gravitons in the linearized spectrum stays massless , while the remaining ones acquire masses proportional to the non - derivative interaction terms .",
    "lorentz invariance can be broken spontaneously even in cases where all metrics are flat , provided that their light - cones have different limiting speeds .",
    "this leads to phenomenology @xcite similar to that of certain phases of lorentz breaking massive gravity referred to above @xcite , of which multigravity can be seen as a particular realization .",
    "finally , additional vector fields have received considerable attention in cosmology .",
    "effective field theories for vectors are strongly constrained by stability requirements .",
    "typically , those with non - trivial cosmological dynamics contain a massive ghost @xcite , which can be removed from the spectrum by sending its mass to infinity .",
    "this amounts to imposing a fixed - norm constraint on the vector , which in turn forces a lorentz - breaking vacuum expectation value .",
    "this led jacobson and mattingly to dub this type of models einstein - aether theories @xcite .",
    "their low - energy excitations are the goldstone bosons of the broken lorentz symmetry , which will participate in the dynamics of the long range gravitational interactions .",
    "an interesting recent development is the proposal by hoava @xcite that a lorentz - breaking theory of gravity may be renormalizable and uv complete .",
    "the breaking of lorentz invariance in this case is implemented by introducing a preferred foliation of space - time , but no additional structure . as pointed out in @xcite , any theory with a preferred foliation can be written in a generally covariant form by treating the time parameter which labels the different hypersurfaces as a stckelberg scalar field @xmath5 .",
    "the foliation is considered to be physical , but not the parametrization , and therefore the covariant theory should be invariant under field redefinitions @xmath6 . in other words , the lagrangian can have a dependence on the unit normal to the hypersurfaces , but not on the magnitude of the gradient @xmath7 ( in contrast with the examples of k - essence and ghost condensation mentioned above ) . from this observation , blas , pujols and",
    "sibiryakov showed @xcite that hoava gravity could be extended by including in the action all terms compatible with reparametrization symmetry , and consistent with power counting renormalizability .",
    "interestingly enough , this extension also cured certain problems in the scalar sector of the original proposal ( such as instabilities and strong coupling at low energies @xcite ) .",
    "jacobson @xcite , has recently clarified the relation between the einstein - aether theory and this extended version of hoava gravity , which he dubbed bpsh gravity . in particular",
    ", he pointed out that any solution of einstein - aether where the vector field is hypersurface orthogonal is also a solution of the low energy limit of bpsh gravity .",
    "since the aether only interacts gravitationally , any signal of it must be proportional to a power of @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the reduced planck mass , and @xmath10 is an energy scale .",
    "thus , even though the aether contains massless fields , its presence is hard to detect . in that respect",
    ", inflation provides an interesting window to probe the aether and its implications . during inflation ,",
    "short - scale vacuum fluctuations of light fields are transferred to cosmological distances , where they may leave an observable imprint .",
    "it is thus natural to look for signatures of einstein - aether on the spectrum of primordial perturbations , which is the subject to which we devote this article .",
    "previous work on this subject has been done in refs .",
    "@xcite , although in a somewhat narrower region of parameter space and with somewhat different conclusions . in the scalar sector , we find that there is a primordial isocurvature mode , which can be interpreted as the velocity potential for the aether with respect to matter .",
    "depending on the aether parameters , this mode can grow on superhorizon scales , leading to a large random velocity field for the aether .",
    "similar results apply to the transverse vector sector .",
    "these perturbations may thus be of phenomenological interest .",
    "we also find that the isocurvature mode is strongly correlated with the usual adiabatic mode , which corresponds to curvature perturbations in the co - moving slicing .    for previous work on the impact of adiabatic scalar perturbations on the cosmic microwave background radiation ( cmb ) and large scale structure in ( generalized ) aether theories ,",
    "see @xcite .    while this paper was being prepared , an interesting related paper by kobayashi , urakawa and yamaguchi appeared @xcite , which analyzes the post - inflationary evolution of the adiabatic scalar mode in bpsh theory .",
    "where we overlap , our conclusions agree .",
    "the plan of the paper is the following . in section [ sec : theory ] we review the basics of einstein - aether theory and the homogeneous cosmological solutions . sections [ sec : tensor perturbations ] , [ sec : scalar perturbations ] and [ sec : vector perturbations ] are devoted to the analysis of tensor , scalar and transverse vector perturbations respectively .",
    "section [ ncmbs ] analyzes the contribution of vector modes to the cmb spectrum .",
