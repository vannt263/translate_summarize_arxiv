    "hercules  x-1/hz  herculis is an x - ray binary consisting of a 1.24 second pulsar in an eclipsing 1.7 day orbit with a @xmath4 mass normal companion . as a result of its many periodicities ,",
    "it is one of the most frequently observed x - ray binaries .",
    "the x - rays vary over a 35  day cycle ; an @xmath5 day `` main - on '' state and @xmath6 day `` short - on '' state ( in which the observed x - ray flux is reduced by a factor of @xmath7 ) are separated by half of a 35-day phase ( scott &  leahy 1999 ) . outside of these states",
    "the x - ray flux is several %  of that seen in the main - on state .",
    "the x - ray modulation is not due to a change in the total x - ray output , as the optical magnitude continues to vary over the 1.7  day orbit due to x - ray heating of the companion star . instead , the 35-day variation probably results from obscuration of the central source by an accretion disk which wobbles over a 35-day period due to an unknown cause .",
    "x - ray absorption dips occur at a period of 1.65  days , near to , but significantly greater than , the 1.62  day beat period between the 1.7 and 35 day periods ( crosa &  boynton 1981 ; scott &  leahy 1999 ) .",
    "features in the x - ray spectrum near @xmath8  kev have been interpreted as the result of cyclotron absorption ( trmper et al .",
    "1978 , dal fiume et al . 1998 ) , implying a magnetic field strength @xmath9  g ( mihara et al . 1990 ) .",
    "recently , another model has been put forward for the cyclotron lines , in which the electron momentum distribution is allowed to be anisotropic .",
    "the magnetic field strength is then inferred to be @xmath10  g ( baushev &  bisnovatyi - kogan 1999 ) .",
    "the x - ray power spectrum is dominated by the 1.24 second pulse and its harmonics and by a continuum noise component ( belloni , hasinger , & kahabka 1991 ) .",
    "there has been a single report of 144  sec period x - ray fluctuations during an x - ray turn - on ( leahy et al .",
    "the optical and uv continuua both show evidence for reprocessed pulsations ( middleditch &  nelson 1977 , boroson et al .",
    "1996 ) with fractional amplitudes of several @xmath11 .",
    "the accretion disk and the atmosphere of hz  her may both contribute to the reprocessed pulsations .",
    "quasiperiodic oscillations ( qpos ) , observed in a variety of compact accreting binary systems , have not previously been reported for her  x-1 .",
    "qpos in general are poorly understood . in the `` atoll '' and `` z - class '' sources that show khz qpos , spin periods",
    "are not observed directly , cyclotron lines are not seen , and emission from the companion star is often overwhelmed by the emission from the accretion disk .",
    "thus the discovery of qpos in her  x-1 may help to link qpo behavior to such properties as the neutron star magnetic field and spin , and details of the mass transfer .",
    "we have been carrying out a multiwavelength study of hercules  x-1 using the hst  space telescope imaging spectrograph ( stis ) , the rossi x - ray timing explorer ( rxte ) , the extreme ultraviolet explorer ( euve ) , and ground - based observatories , including the keck telescope .",
    "empirical models for the emission lines observed during the first segment of our campaign , in july of 1998 , have been reported in boroson et al .",
    "a second segment of the campaign took place during july of 1999 .",
    "the 1999 observations took place during an `` anomalous low '' state in which the x - ray flux was two orders of magnitude lower than in the expected `` main - on '' state , although accretion continued to take place ( parmar et al .",
    "a summary of the multiwavelength campaign results is presented in vrtilek et al .",
    "( 2000 ) .",
    "the uv observations used the hst stis .",
    "the stis instrument design is described by woodgate et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , and the in - orbit performance of the stis is described by kimble et al . (",
    "we show a log of the 1999 stis observations in table  1 .",
    "all of these observations used the e140 m grating for high resolution echelle spectroscopy .",
    "this provides a spectral coverage of @xmath12  with a resolving power of @xmath13 ( 6  km  s@xmath14 ) .",
    "we obtained the hst spectra using the time - tag mode , which stamps each photon with a time accurate to 125@xmath15sec and the position of the photon along the two axes that define the two - dimensional echelle image . to create light curves we first selected a region of the two - dimensional raw spectral image corresponding either to the entire spectrum or the brightest spectral lines ( @xmath16 and @xmath17 ) .",
    "we selected the region in the two - dimensional echelle image using the task `` fselect '' in the fits utility package ftools ( version 4.2 ) .",
    "then we converted the resulting file to a light curve with 0.1  second bins using the ftools `` fcurve '' task .",
    "we then formed power spectra from the discrete fourier transform of the data in each of the hst orbits , and for 400  second intervals within each orbit .",
    "as a `` control '' on our method , we also examined stis time - tag data for the x - ray binary lmc  x-4 using similar data reduction techniques .",
    "analysis of these observations , and the search for uv pulsations with the 13.5  second lmc  x-4 pulsar period , will be presented in kaper et al .",
    "none of the 5  hst orbits in which lmc  x-4 was observed showed significant power above the white noise due to counting statistics in the 1 - 100 mhz region .",
    "we did not find any evidence for uv pulsations near the 1.24  s pulsar period in the 1999 data .",
    "we would have detected ( with 5@xmath18 significance ) pulsations of rms amplitude @xmath19%  near @xmath2 , amplitude @xmath20%  near @xmath21 , and amplitude @xmath22%near @xmath23 when the disk is emerging from eclipse .",
    "these values should be compared with the uv rms amplitudes found with the ghrs in boroson et al .",
    "( 1996 ) : @xmath24%  at @xmath25 and @xmath26%  at @xmath27 . in the 1998 data , during the short - on state at @xmath28",
    ", we found marginal evidence ( false alarm probability @xmath24% ) for pulsations with rms amplitude of @xmath26% . with this sole exception",
    ", there were no uv oscillations near the pulse period in the data from either 1998 or 1999 .",
    "the fractional rms amplitude is defined and related to the power spectrum in van der klis ( 1989 ) . for a constant plus pure sinusoid signal ,",
    "the fractional rms amplitude is @xmath29 times the peak - to - peak difference , divided by the average value .",
    "it is useful to place the non - detection of uv pulsations in context by examining the x - ray pulsations seen in 1998 and 1999 .",
    "our 1998 multiwavelength campaign overlapped with x - ray observations using bepposax ( oosterbroek et al .",
    "these observations found that the fractional rms amplitude of the x - ray pulses during the july 1998 short - on state was 10%  in the 4 - 10  kev band , compared with 20%  in the main - on state ( fig .",
    "4 of oosterbroek et al . 2000 ) .",
    "rxte measured an x - ray flux of @xmath30  erg  s@xmath14  @xmath31 , steadily decreasing to @xmath32  erg  s@xmath14  @xmath31 as the short - on state progressed .",
    "the 1999 rxte observations found that although the direct component of the x - rays was obscured , x - rays were observed at @xmath33%  of the normal main - on level , and continued to pulsate with the 1.24  second period , with a fractional rms amplitude of @xmath34% ( still et al .",
    "we caution , however , that these low pulse fractions do not provide a full explanation of why uv pulses were not observed , as the x - ray pulse fraction seen by the companion star and disk ( which cause the uv pulsations ) can be very different from that which we observe .    in figure  1",
    "we show the average power spectrum for each orbit in which qpos were detected . in figure",
    "2 we show the average of 46  power spectra of the light curves from all hst orbits from the 1999 campaign in 400  second intervals . near @xmath2",
    "the count rate is sufficient to detect individual qpo oscillations , which we show in figure  3 .",
    "no significant qpos were detected in the emission line flux .",
    "the lines contribute about 20%  of the total counts in the spectrum .",
    "when we subtract the light curve of the emission lines from the light curve of the total spectrum and take a power spectrum , the qpos remain unaffected .",
    "we could not obtain accurate gaussian representations of the power spectra within each hst orbit .",
    "however , taking the average of all power spectra , we could fit a power - law continuum and 2  gaussians ( figure  2 ) .",
    "we find qpo centroids of @xmath35  mhz and @xmath36  mhz ( we have determined errors from a monte carlo bootstrap analysis , press et al .",
    "the gaussian widths of the qpos were @xmath37  mhz and @xmath38  mhz . applying the techniques outlined in van der klis ( 1989 ) , we find total rms qpo fractions of 2.1@xmath39%  and 3.7@xmath40%  for the two qpo peaks , respectively .",
    "we detect qpos at @xmath41 if we remove a linear trend from the uv continuum light curve ( table  1 ) .",
    "it is possible that the predominance of uv oscillations near @xmath2 results from the flatter orbital light curve near @xmath2 .",
    "however , removing linear trends from the data for other hst orbits did not reveal mhz  qpos .    after finding qpos in the 1999 stis data , we examined optical observations from our 1998 campaign and found evidence for a 35  mhz qpo peak there as well ( figure  4 ) .",
    "results from the optical campaign will be presented in more detail in ( obrien et al .",
    "2000 ) . the hst  ghrs observations of boroson et al .",
    "( 1996 ) during the main - on state included 1200  s of high count - rate ( 1100  cts  s@xmath14 ) data at @xmath42 , which show the 8  mhz qpo but not the 43  mhz qpo .",
    "we investigated the time dependence of the 45 mhz qpo feature using a gabor transform ( heil &  walnut 1989 , 1990 ) .",
    "the gabor transform is a wavelet transform which decomposes the signal into the time - frequency plane .",
    "the discrete implementation used here is equivalent to a short - time , gaussian - windowed fourier transform ( boyd et al .",
    "we chose a window size of 512 seconds , and restricted the frequency range to lie between 2.5 - 90 mhz .",
    "figure  [ fig : gt ] displays power as a function of frequency and time for the first five observations . the palette runs from dark blue ( low power ) through deep red ( high power ) .",
    "the featureless dark blue vertical strips are times during which no data was collected . significance was estimated by performing individual , independent fourier transforms on the data in windows fully containing the features of highest power .",
    "the strongest of these features are found to be significant at more than @xmath43 .",
    "figure  [ fig : gt ] shows the frequency evolution of the 45  mhz qpo as a function of time , and can be thought of as an unfolding of the single power spectrum , which shows a broad qpo feature centered about a preferred frequency .",
    "the frequency evolution shown in the gabor transforms shows that the qpo in the overall power spectrum is composed of many individual short - time components that come and go over the entire observation .",
    "the `` spikey '' power spectra could be caused by several processes .",
    "multiple overlapping exponential oscillating shots or a single sinusoid whose phase undergoes a random walk could each reproduce the qualitative power spectral shape observed .",
    "the gabor transforms suggest that the qpo width is due to high q oscillations appearing and disappearing at different frequencies .",
    "oscillating shot noise can cause both qpo and a low - frequency red noise component together , and we have tried to determine whether the 8  mhz feature could actually be red noise associated with the 45  mhz feature .",
    "analysis of the dynamical power spectrum through the gabor transform shows no apparent correlation .",
    "are the qpos due to the accretion disk or the x - ray heated atmosphere of hz  her ?",
    "the qpos were not detected at @xmath44 or @xmath45 .",
    "models suggest that at @xmath46 and @xmath47 , most of the optical and uv continuum arises in the accretion disk , and that from @xmath23 to @xmath48 the flux from the disk should be constant ( howarth &  wilson 1983 ) . the x - ray heating of the atmosphere of hz  her causes the optical continuum flux to reach a maximum near @xmath2 ( bahcall &  bahcall 1972 ) , and at these phases , the uv emission arises predominantly on the x - ray heated face hz  her ( vrtilek &  cheng 1996 ) . from figure  6",
    "we conclude that at @xmath2 , the disk continuum should contribute at most @xmath49%  of the total continuum flux .",
    "thus if the uv qpos with 10%amplitude of the total flux result from oscillations of the disk flux , the disk flux must be modulated by an amplitude near 100% .",
    "it would be simpler to attribute the qpos to the heated atmosphere of hz  her .",
    "the concentration of the qpo detections about @xmath2 could be a result of the increased stellar flux ; with a higher flux the qpos would be easier to detect .",
    "the light - travel time across the x - ray heated face of the companion should be @xmath50  seconds , as the separation of the neutron star and the system center of mass is @xmath51  s ( deeter et al .",
    "this allows variability on the observed timescales , while damping the harmonics of the 45  mhz qpo ( which are not observed ) .",
    "although we conclude that the uv qpos are probably emitted by hz  her , they may well be _ reprocessed _ from qpos originating in the accretion disk , either as a result of some structure in the disk _ emitting _ with the qpo frequency , or _",
    "shadowing _ the star from x - ray emission with the same frequency .",
    "a comparison with optical and x - ray qpos recently discovered in other x - ray pulsars supports this conclusion ( see table  2 for a summary of these systems . )    the kz  tra/4u  1627 - 67 system contains an x - ray pulsar with a 7.7  s period , and shows 48 mhz qpos in both x - ray and optical lightcurves ( chakrabarty 1998 ) .",
    "the optical qpos , with an amplitude of @xmath52% , are emitted by the surface of the companion in response to x - ray illumination .",
    "the qpo frequency is probably the orbital frequency of a structure revolving about the neutron star ( kommers , chakrabarty , &  lewin 1998 ) .",
    "the x - ray binary pulsar smc  x-1 shows x - ray power spectral turnover at @xmath53  mhz ( angelini , stella , &  white 1991 ) and qpos at 60  mhz ( wojdowski et al .",
    "transient x - ray pulsars also show qpos ; xte j1858 + 034 has qpos with @xmath54  mhz with rms amplitude 3.7 - 7.8%  depending on the energy band ( paul &  rao 1998 ) .",
    "the transient be system 4u  1907 + 09 shows very narrow qpo with @xmath55  mhz during bursts ( intzand , baykal , &  strohmayer 1998 ) .",
    "these sources thus show qpos with remarkably similar frequencies , and as they are all x - ray pulsars they probably have similar magnetic field strengths ( for 4u  1627 - 67 , bepposax observations of a cyclotron feature imply @xmath56  g , orlandini et al .",
    "it thus seems natural to try to associate the qpos with the region where the magnetic field disrupts the disk .",
    "the alfvn radius ( where the magnetic energy density equals the gas ram pressure ) in her  x-1 is probably @xmath57  cm ( mccray &  lamb 1976 ) . within this region ,",
    "the keplerian frequency is @xmath58  mhz , higher than the observed qpos .",
    "the qpo may be due to keplerian rotation further out in the disk , but a physical reason why this region is singled out is lacking .",
    "we also consider a `` beat - frequency '' interpretation ( alpar &  shaham 1985 ) , in which the observed qpo frequency @xmath60 , where @xmath61 is the neutron star spin frequency and @xmath62 is the keplerian frequency of some material in the disk . in order for @xmath63 to be a beat frequency ,",
    "the keplerian frequency must be within 5%  of @xmath64 .",
    "this seems an unlikely coincidence , although we must have @xmath65 or the gas will be expelled from the disk , spinning down the pulsar via `` propellor effect '' ( illarionov &  sunyaev 1975 ) .",
    "we note that bepposax observations ending @xmath66  days before the start of the hst observations reported here ( parmar et al . 1999 ) show that the pulsar has indeed spun - down , reversing @xmath33 years of spin - up in a period of months .",
    "the beat frequency interpretation of the qpos requires that the alfvn radius be near the corotation radius in her  x-1 ( at @xmath67  cm ) , and this does appear to be the case .",
    "the transition between keplerian rotation and corotation occurs at a radius @xmath68 ( ghosh &  lamb 1979 ) over a radial zone of extent @xmath69 . in this range ,",
    "@xmath62 varies by @xmath33% , naturally leading to @xmath70  mhz , given @xmath71 .",
    "( however , this mechanism would not be able to explain the 8  mhz qpo , which requires the keplerian frequency to be within @xmath72%  of the pulse frequency . )",
    "further bolstering the beat - frequency case , we have found marginal evidence for oscillations at 760  mhz=@xmath73  mhz in the x - ray data from rxte from our 1998 campaign . as an example of how this could arise in a beat - frequency scenario ,",
    "if a blob in orbit around the neutron star has an orbital frequency of 760  mhz , it will cover the x - ray beam from the pulsar ( which rotates at 808  mhz ) and prevent it from illuminating the companion star with a frequency of @xmath74  mhz@xmath75  mhz .",
    "the ( marginally ) observed 760  mhz x - ray signal would then be a direct signal from this blob , due either to emission or obscuration .",
    "it seems more likely that the reprocessed qpos are due to material that absorbs the x - rays and prevents them from heating hz  her than material that emits x - rays .",
    "whether the qpo frequency results from keplerian rotation or a beat - frequency , the accretion disk is too cold at the implied radii to emit x - rays that significantly heat the companion .    a third possible explanation for the qpos , that may explain the presence of * both * qpos , is provided by titarchuk &  osherovich ( 2000 , submitted ) . in this explanation ,",
    "the higher frequency qpo results from a global vertical oscillation of the disk , whereas the lower frequency qpo results from keplerian rotation .",
    "we detected uv continuum qpos during an anomalous low state of her x-1 .",
    "although there may be a connection between the qpo and the low state , time - resolved uv observations near @xmath2 have not been common , and similar optical qpo are seen in observations using the keck telescope ( obrien , et al . 2000 ) during the short - on state ( figure  4 ) .",
    "the iue observations and the hst  fos observations of anderson et al .",
    "( 1994 ) did not have the required time resolution for the detection of qpos .",
    "the qpo phenomenon in her  x-1 should help us understand the origin of qpos in other sources .",
    "the simultaneous detection of x - ray and uv qpos during an on state could test our suggestion that hz  her reprocesses x - ray qpos .",
    "the uv qpos should lag the x - ray qpos by @xmath76  s , in a manner that varies with the orbital phase .",
    "simultaneous measurement of uv and optical qpos could determine the spectrum of the reprocessor .",
    "these analyses will test our proposal that the qpos originate on the star in response to disk qpos , and may help us distinguish between the possible origins in the disk that we have suggested .",
