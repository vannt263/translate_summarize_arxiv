    "the hubble space telescope and advances in ground based observing have greatly increased our knowledge of the galaxy population in the distant universe . however , the nature of these galaxies and their evolutionary connections to local galaxies remain poorly understood .",
    "luminous , compact , star forming galaxies appear to represent a prominent phase in the early history of galaxy formation @xcite . in particular :    * the number density of luminous , compact star forming galaxies rises significantly out to z  @xmath1  1 @xcite . *",
    "the lyman break galaxies at z  @xmath12  2 seen in the hubble deep field are characterized by very compact cores and a high surface brightness @xcite . *",
    "sub - millimeter imaging has revealed distant galaxies ( z  @xmath1  2@xmath134 ) , half of them compact objects , which may be responsible for as much as half of the total star formation rate in the early universe @xcite .",
    "however , little is definitively known of their physical properties , or how they are related to subsets of the local galaxy population .    a classification for known examples of intermediate redshift ( 0.4  @xmath0  z  @xmath0  0.7 ) luminous , blue , compact galaxies , such as blue nucleated galaxies , compact narrow emission line galaxies , and small blue galaxies , has been developed by @xcite in order to be able to choose samples over a wide redshift range .",
    "they have found that the bulk of these galaxies , collectively termed luminous compact blue galaxies ( lcbgs ) , can be distinguished quantitatively from local normal galaxies by their blue color , small size , high luminosity , and high surface brightness .",
    "( see  2.1 for more detail . )    from studies at intermediate redshifts , it has been found that lcbgs are a heterogeneous class of vigorously starbursting , high metallicity galaxies with an underlying older stellar population @xcite . while common at intermediate redshifts , they are rare locally @xcite and little is known about the class as a whole , nor their evolutionary connections to other galaxies .",
    "lcbgs undergo dramatic evolution : at z  @xmath1  1 , they are numerous and have a total star formation rate density equal to that of grand - design spirals at that time . however , by z  @xmath1  0 , the number density and star formation rate density of lcbgs has decreased by at least a factor of ten @xcite . since the lcbg population is morphologically and spectroscopically diverse , these galaxies are unlikely to evolve into one homogeneous galaxy class . @xcite and @xcite suggest that a subset of lcbgs at intermediate redshifts may be the progenitors of local low - mass dwarf elliptical galaxies such as ngc  205 .",
    "alternatively , @xcite and @xcite suggest that others may be disk galaxies in the process of building a bulge to become local l@xmath2 spiral galaxies .    clearly , to determine the most likely evolutionary scenarios for intermediate redshift lcbgs , it is necessary to know their masses and the timescale of their starburst activity .",
    "are they comparable to today s massive or low - mass galaxies ?",
    "are they small starbursting galaxies which will soon exhaust their gas and eventually fade ? or are they larger galaxies with only moderate amounts of star formation ? only kinematic line widths that truly reflect the masses of these galaxies , as well as measures of their gas content and star formation rates , can answer these questions . using ionized gas emission line widths , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite ,",
    "have found that lcbgs have mass - to - light ratios approximately ten times smaller than typical local l@xmath2 galaxies .",
    "however , since ionized gas emission lines may originate primarily from the central regions of galaxies , their line widths may underestimate the gravitational potential @xcite .",
    "h   emission lines provide a better estimate of the total galaxy mass as they measure the gravitational potential out to larger galactic radii .",
    "observations of both h   and co ( the best tracer of cold h@xmath14 ) , combined with star formation rates , are necessary to estimate the starburst timescales .      with current radio instrumentation ,",
    "h   and co can only easily be measured in very nearby lcbgs , at distances @xmath0  150 mpc for h  , and @xmath0  70 mpc for co. therefore , to understand the nature and evolutionary possibilities of higher redshift lcbgs , we have undertaken a survey in h   21  cm emission and multiple rotational transitions of co of a sample of 20 local lcbgs , drawn from the sloan digital sky survey @xcite .",
    "this work , paper i , reports the optical photometric properties of our sample and the results of the h   21  cm portion of the survey , including dynamical masses and comparisons with local galaxy types .",
    "paper ii @xcite will report the results of a survey of the molecular gas conditions .",
    "knowledge of the dynamical masses , combined with gas masses and star formation rates , constrains the evolutionary possibilities of these galaxies .",
    "nearby blue compact galaxies ( bcgs ) have been studied extensively at radio and optical wavelengths since @xcite originated the term `` compact galaxy '' and @xcite distinguished between `` red '' and `` blue '' compact galaxies .",
    "the term bcg typically refers to galaxies with a compact nature , a high mean surface brightness , and emission lines superposed on a blue continuum .",
    "however , many different selection criteria have been used , leading to various definitions of bcgs and samples with a range of properties .",
    "for example , the term `` dwarf '' has been used to mean bcgs fainter than @xmath1317 ( e.g. thuan & martin 1981 ; kong & cheng 2002 ) or @xmath1318 blue magnitudes ( e.g. taylor et al .",
    "1994 ) , or an optical diameter less than 10  kpc @xcite .",
    "the term `` blue '' has been used to mean blue on the palomar sky survey plate ( e.g. gordon & gottesman 1981 ) , or to have emission lines superposed on a blue background ( e.g. thuan & martin 1981 ) .",
    "the term `` compact '' has been used to mean smaller than 1 kpc in optical diameter ( e.g. thuan & martin 1981 ) , or qualitatively compact ( e.g. doublier et al .",
    "some , for example @xcite , began using the term blue compact dwarf to refer to the common low luminosity , low metallicity bcgs .",
    "as high luminosity ( @xmath1l@xmath2 ) , nearby bcgs are rare , many began to use the term blue compact dwarf for all nearby bcgs , regardless of luminosity .",
    "there are only a few of the rare local lcbgs ( by the @xcite definition ) in previous bcg surveys .",
    "note that @xcite have recently been studying local luminous bcgs .",
    "however , their selection criteria are not as stringent as that of @xcite , and they have been focusing on very low metallicity ( less than 15% solar ) galaxies .",
    "intermediate redshift lcbgs with rest - frame properties matching the class definition of @xcite have metallicities at least 40%  solar @xcite .",
    "four of our local lcbgs have metallicities available in the literature , which range from 40  @xmath13  70  %  solar @xcite . by using the selection criteria of @xcite ,",
    "we ensure that our study is of those local lcbgs defined to be analogs to the widely studied higher redshift lcbgs .",
    "the observations , including sample selection and data reduction , are described in @xmath152 .",
    "the optical photometric properties , h   21  cm spectra , measurements , and derived properties are presented in @xmath153 , and analyzed in @xmath154 .",
    "we compare the derived physical properties to local normal galaxies and higher redshift lcbgs in @xmath155 , and conclude in @xmath156 .",
    "we assume h@xmath16  =  70  km  s@xmath17  mpc@xmath17 throughout .",
    "when we compare our results to those of other authors , we scale their results to this value .",
    "when @xcite compared intermediate redshift lcbgs with local normal galaxies , they found that lcbgs can be isolated quantitatively on the basis of color , surface brightness , image concentration , and asymmetry .",
    "color and surface brightness were found to give the best leverage for separating lcbgs from normal galaxies .",
    "specifically , lcbgs can be defined by a region limited to b@xmath13v  @xmath18  0.6 , and a b - band surface brightness within the half - light radius , sbe , brighter than 21  b - mag  arc  sec@xmath19 .",
    "this simple definition differs only slightly from the formal definition in @xcite which uses a color - dependent sbe .",
    "@xcite also applied a luminosity cut - off of 25%  l@xmath20m@xmath21  @xmath18  @xmath1318.5 ) , to distinguish lcbgs from blue compact galaxies .",
    "lcbgs are not so extreme that they are completely separated from the continuum of normal galaxies .",
    "the sharp borders used to classify them are artificial , but serve the purpose of defining similar objects over a range of redshifts .",
    "lcbgs at intermediate redshifts ( z @xmath1 0.6 ) can be studied in deep spectroscopic surveys ( i @xmath1 24 ) , while the brightest lcbgs at high redshifts ( z @xmath1 3 ) require very deep spectroscopic surveys ( i @xmath1 26 ) . therefore ,",
    "lcbgs selected in this manner are observable over a wide range of redshifts .    using these color , surface brightness , and luminosity criteria , we selected our sample of local lcbgs from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) . begun in 2000 ,",
    "this survey will ultimately image one quarter of the sky using a large format ccd camera on a 2.5  m telescope at apache point observatory in new mexico .",
    "images are taken in five broad bands ( u , g , r , i , z ) which range from 3540    ( u ) to 9130    ( z ) .",
    "the survey has a limiting magnitude of 22.2 in g  ( 4770   ) and r  ( 6230   ) , our two bands of interest . after searching through approximately one million galaxies ( @xmath11500 degree@xmath22 on the sky )",
    ", we identified only 16 nearby ( d  @xmath0  70  mpc ) lcbgs .",
    "this distance cut - off was chosen to ensure our galaxies could be detected quickly in both h   and co. we added four markarian galaxies from the literature which fulfilled our selection criteria and were not yet surveyed by sdss , for a total of 20 local lcbgs .",
    "the color and surface brightness characteristics of our local sample , as well as higher redshift ( 0.4  @xmath0  z  @xmath0  1 ) samples of lcbgs , are compared to other nearby galaxies in figure 1 .",

    "however , our sample includes galaxies down to 0.25  l@xmath2 .",

    "therefore , it is more appropriate to compare mass - to - light ratios ; see @xmath154.1 .",
    "we estimate the random errors associated with the dynamical masses to be approximately 50% . this estimate is made from uncertainties in the inclination ( @xmath34  12@xmath47 , from the earlier comparison of hyperleda and sdss inclinations ) ; uncertainties in radii measurements ( as given by hyperleda and sdss ) ; and uncertainties in measuring w@xmath39 ( as discussed above ) .",
    "however , the random errors are overwhelmed by the systematic uncertainties when estimating dynamical masses .",
    "we have chosen a structural constant of c@xmath14  =  1 , but this could be as high as 1.5 , as discussed earlier .",
    "even more significant is that 45% of our galaxy sample have other galaxies at similar velocities in the beam of the gbt . as the h   emission from all sources in the beam and within the bandwidth",
    "is blended into one spectrum , we may be overestimating the masses of these galaxies .",
    "finally , a fifth of our galaxies have low inclinations ( @xmath18  40@xmath47 ) which lead to large corrections and therefore increasing uncertainties in the rotational velocities and overestimations of the dynamical masses .",
    "the dynamical masses we report may be viewed as upper limits    we are certainly overestimating the masses in many cases , but not underestimating them .",
    "we are pursuing a follow - up program with both the arecibo radio telescope and the vla to address these issues . at 21  cm the arecibo radio telescope",
    "has a beam size of 3@xmath33.1  @xmath4  3@xmath33.5 , a third the size of the gbt beam .",
    "this decreases the number of target galaxies observed with other galaxies in the beam , decreasing the number of galaxies with overestimates of dynamical masses .",
    "we have already observed over 40 lcbgs at arecibo , but results are not yet available .",
    "the vla in `` b '' configuration provides the ability to map our galaxies in 21  cm emission to a resolution of 5@xmath33@xmath33 .",
    "we have begun a survey of those lcbgs with companions .",
    "vla maps allow us to disentangle the emission from each galaxy and more accurately estimate the dynamical mass of the target galaxy .",
    "along with dynamical mass , a knowledge of the amount of fuel , i.e. atomic and molecular gas , available for the starburst activity , is critical for narrowing down the evolutionary possibilities for lcbgs . when combined with star formation rates , this gives an estimate of the maximum length of the starburst at the current rate of star formation .",
    "we defer a full discussion of this until paper ii @xcite where we present our measurements of the co content of these galaxies , but present the h   results here .",

    "dynamical mass - to - light ratios indicate whether our local sample of lcbgs are under - massive for their luminosities .",
    "we calculated the total blue luminosities , l@xmath21 , of our galaxies from m@xmath21 , assuming m@xmath63  =  5.48 @xcite .",
    "we find the median mass - to - light ratio , m@xmath40(r @xmath18 r@xmath10 )  l@xmath8  =  3  m@xmath7 l@xmath64 , with a minimum of 0.6 and a maximum of 9  m@xmath7  l@xmath64 .",

    "however , as discussed in @xmath153.1 , to compare our mass - to - light ratios to those of local , normal hubble - types in @xcite , we must use dynamical masses which have not been corrected for random motions . figure 6 compares such mass - to - light ratios for our local sample of lcbgs and nearby hubble types . while some local lcbgs have mass - to - light ratios equal to or greater than the median for local hubble types , approximately half the local lcbgs have smaller mass - to - light ratios .",
    "many of the galaxies with mass - to - light ratios typical of local hubble types have other galaxies within the beam , possibly leading to an overestimation of the dynamical mass - to - light ratio of the target galaxy .",

    "we find similar results if we simply scale w@xmath39 to @xmath38 by assuming the spectra are gaussian , that is , dividing w@xmath39 by 3.6 .",
    "the values of @xmath38 for the other galaxy samples are from optical line width measurements , except the measurements for magellanic spirals are from 21  cm h   line widths .",
    "optical line widths may be smaller than h   line widths .",
