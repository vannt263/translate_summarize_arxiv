    ", @xmath0 can be used to constrain models of the evolution and clustering of faint galaxies at intermediate and high redshift .",
    "a large number of investigations have measured the correlation for faint magnitudes in different passbands , bernstein 1994 ; brainerd , smail , & mould 1995 ( bsm ) ; couch , jurcevic , & boyle 1993 ; efstathiou 1991 ; neuschaefer , windhorst , & dressler 1991 ; roche 1993 .",
    "there is a general consensus that @xmath0 can be approximated by a power law with slope of @xmath8 and an amplitude that decreases with increasing limiting magnitude",
    ". there is , however , little consensus on what that means in terms of luminosity evolution , merger history , and clustering .",
    "the number counts as a function of magnitude , ( lilly 1991 , smail 1995 ) , and the redshift surveys to faint magnitudes ( broadhurst 1992 , glazebrook 1994 ) put significant constraints on the galaxy evolution .",
    "weak gravitational lensing of distant galaxies , equivalent to a systematic induced magnification and distortion without multiple imaging , is a probe of the large scale mass distribution of the universe , ( gunn 1967 ) . essentially , when a light ray from a distant galaxy passes through an overdense region in mass , the image will be magnified and distorted tangentially with respect to the center of the mass overdensity .",
    "this effect has been measured in a number of galaxy clusters , [ tyson , valdes , & wenk ( 1990 ) , bonnet ( 1994 ) ] .",
    "conversely , passing through a low density region , the image will become dimmer and elongated radially .",
    "independent perturbations along the line of sight add up stochastically [ blandford 1991(bsbv ) , miralda - escud 1991 , kaiser 1992 , villumsen 1995a(v95a ) ] .",
    "weak lensing by large scale structure is observable because galaxy images near each other on the sky will be sheared coherently leading to a locally preferred direction .",
    "due to the weak nature of the lensing there has been no undisputed measure of the distortion , see f.ex .",
    "( mould 1994 ; kaiser , squires , & broadhurst 1995 ) , though a reanalysis by villumsen ( 1995b ) shows a tentative detection at the 5-@xmath9 level consistent with expectations from a weakly biased flat cold dark matter ( cdm ) universe .",
    "the problem with weak lensing is that it is weak .",
    "measuring the weak shear requires measuring the shape and orientation of distant galaxy images .",
    "this is observationally feasible , but quite difficult , since the images are small and faint , and the possible systematic errors are the limiting factors .",
    "weak gravitational lensing is characterized by the convergence @xmath10 and shear @xmath11 .",
    "we will work only in the weak limit , @xmath12 . in this limit , both @xmath10 and @xmath11 are observables .",
    "the distortion of an image is given by @xmath11 , such that an intrinsically round image will aquire an eccentricity equal to @xmath13 and the phase of @xmath11 will be twice the position angle of the major axis .",
    "the magnification @xmath14 of an image is @xmath15 . in clusters ,",
    "the distortion is used to generate shear maps which can then be converted into maps of the surface density as pioneered by kaiser & squires ( 1993 ) and further developed by seitz & schneider ( 1995 ) . recently",
    "broadhurst , taylor & peacock(1995 ) have demonstrated the use of the magnification to improve the information about the surface mass density .    in this paper",
    "i propose a new measure of weak gravitational lensing by large scale structure based on the magnification bias introduced by turner ( 1980 ) and used by broadhurst ( 1995 ) for lensing in clusters .",
    "basically , weak lensing will induce angular correlations in the number density of galaxies on the sky .",
    "this measure only involves the convergence @xmath10 and does not involve @xmath11 .",
    "thus , it is not necessary to measure the shape of high - redshift galaxies .",
    "this means that a galaxy survey to look for magnification bias can be pushed to fainter magnitudes than a search for galaxy distortions .    in  2",
    "i estimate the amplitudes of `` true '' and `` apparent '' clustering , in  3 i work out the theory . in  4 i calculate @xmath1 in terms of the 3-d correlation function and in  5",
    "i discuss the implications .",
    "magnification bias is the change in surface number density of sources on the sky due to gravitational lensing ( turner 1984 ) . as the total number of galaxies on the sky",
    "is conserved , magnification in a given patch of the sky will lead to a decrease in the number density of galaxies , because you are looking at a smaller area of sky than you think .",
    "however , magnification will also brighten an image so more galaxies will be visible at a given apparent magnitude @xmath16 .",
    "if the number counts @xmath17 in the absence of lensing has a slope s = d n_0(m ) dm , then the number counts will be changed n_obs(m)=n_0(m)a^2.5s-1=n_0(m)(1+(5s-2)),[nobs ] where @xmath18 and @xmath17 are the number counts in the presence / absence of lensing .",
    "the first equality is generally valid , the second assumes that @xmath19 . for @xmath20",
    "there is no magnification bias , for @xmath21 there is a depletion of counts , while for @xmath22 there is an increase in counts in the presence of magnification .    in order to estimate the clustering effects of the `` magnification bias '' , assume a universe with no intrinsic clustering of galaxies .",
    "then weak lensing will introduce an apparent clustering characterized by an angular two - point correlation function @xmath23 & & n_0(m)^2.[wkk ] here the correlation function is calculated as the average over all direction vectors @xmath24 of the relative excess number of galaxy pairs separated by angle @xmath25 .",

    "they are identical ( bsbv and v95a ) .",

    "the variation in the number counts to a given magnitude limit across the sky is an observable .",
    "the shear and convergence correlation functions are related to the density distribution and cosmological parameters as described in bsbv , v95a .",
    "the shear @xmath11 will also influence the number counts , but the effect is quadratic in @xmath11 and can be ignored .    in real life",
    ", of course , we observe a true clustering of galaxies at faint magnitudes characterized by the angular two - point correlation function @xmath31 , ( see references in  1 ) . the correlation induced by magnification bias",

    "this would indicate that at low redshift @xmath23 is unimportant but that at sufficiently high redshift @xmath23 might become important .",

    "if light traces mass , then there will be a strong correlation between the magnification and the true clustering .",
    "if @xmath45 , this is really an anticorrelation and the observed clustering will be less than the true clustering .",
    "smail ( 1995 ) find that the slope in the vri bands all tend to @xmath46 for the faintest galaxies .",
    "neuschaefer ( 1991 ) have reported on @xmath1 in the gunn - g band and they find a slope @xmath47 .",
    "this is close to the critical slope of @xmath20 , so the magnification bias is expected to be small and quite uncertain . for @xmath48",
    "they find that @xmath1 is approximately a power law with the amplitude decreasing with increasing magnitude . for fainter magnitudes",
    "they find a very steep rise in the amplitude .",
    "this rise is much too steep to be accounted for by magnification bias . at @xmath49 , @xmath50 . for a high value of @xmath51 there may be a small contribution to @xmath1 from magnification bias , though this is uncertain",
    ".    however , broadhurst ( 1995 ) has shown that for the @xmath52 band counts , @xmath53 , the red counts , @xmath54 , are fitted well by a slope @xmath55 .",
    "the blue counts , @xmath56 , have @xmath57 .",

    "this encourages a more detailed study of the magnification bias .",
    "in the limit where the intrinsic clustering and the magnification bias are weak , the clustering , characterized by the angular two - point correlation function @xmath0 can be calculated .",

    "the problem with weak lensing is that it is weak .",
    "it requires measuring the shape and orientation of faint galaxy images .",
    "this is observationally feasible , but quite difficult , since the images are small and faint , and the possible systematic errors are the limiting factors .",
    "however , the payoff is immense in terms of measuring cosmological parameters and the power spectrum of density fluctuations .    we have presented a new way of measuring the mass density fluctuations at intermediate redshifts by measuring the angular two - point correlation function @xmath0 . at sufficiently faint magnitudes ,",
    "the observed @xmath0 will be dominated by weak lensing .",
    "the method combines the relative ease at which @xmath0 can be determined , with the relatively simple theoretical interpretation of weak lensing in terms of cosmological parameters and the statistical properties of the mass distribution .    at relatively bright magnitudes , @xmath181 ,",
    "weak lensing is expected to be unimportant .",
    "if the slope of the number counts is greater / less than @xmath182 , the amplitude of @xmath0 will decrease slower / faster than expected from limber s equation .",
    "in both cases the amplitude will hit a minimum and then increase with limiting magnitude .",
    "an equivalent measure is the ratio of number counts in two different passbands as a function of position in the sky .",
    "this measure can , by carefully choosing the passbands and magnitudes , be tuned to be nearly independent of the true clustering of galaxies . in that case",
    ", @xmath1 is a straight measure of weak lensing and the theoretical interpretation is considerably simpler .    in summary : the angular two - point correlation function of galaxies is affected by weak lensing by large scale structure through the magnification bias . at faint magnitudes",
    "this can be a signicant effect and must be included in calculations . for a properly designed experiment , @xmath1 can be used to infer the clustering of the mass , the clustering of the galaxies , and how well light traces mass ."
