    "it is widely believed that the study of qnm can help us get deeper understandings of the ads / cft @xcite , ds / cft @xcite correspondences @xcite , loop quantum gravity @xcite and present us the imprint of the extra dimensions @xcite .",

    "the perturbation of a single classical field will die out finally due to the black hole absorption .",
    "recently more interest has been focused on the strongly coupled theory by considering the einstein - maxwell field interacting with a charged scalar field with a minimal lagrangian @xmath0 in the light of ads / cft correspondence , it was realized that a condensate of the charged scalar field is formed through its coupling to a maxwell field of the background @xcite . along this line",

    "it was disclosed that there is a second order transition , with mean field theory exponents , between a non - superconducting state at high temperatures , where all the charge is in the normal component , and a superconducting state at low temperatures .",
    "similar transition occurs for black hole geometries based on gravity coupled to the abelian higgs model @xcite .",
    "it is of great interest to ask whether the qnm can be an effective probe of this phase transition .",
    "this is the motivation of the present work .    in @xcite , the marginally stable linearized perturbation around a charged black hole background in ads",

    "we want to establish the more range of behaviors that this mechanism exhibits by studying the qnm behavior . in @xcite ,",
    "the qnm at strong coupling was computed from the poles of retarded green s function in the black hole background . in our investigation",
    "we will start from the bulk equations and directly study the wave dynamics outside black holes . by this way we can get the objective picture of how the perturbation of the scalar field evolves if it is coupled to a maxwell field . by comparing our result with that obtained in @xcite , we can have further insight into the holographic correspondence .",
    "besides the black hole configuration , in our study we will also investigate the ads soliton configuration which has lower energy than the ads space in the poincare coordinates , but has the same boundary topology as the ricci flat black hole and the ads space in the poincare coordinates @xcite .",
    "it was found that there is a hawking - page phase transition between the ricci flat ads black hole and the ads soliton @xcite and this phase transition was observed in the qnm spectrum @xcite .",

    ", we see that in the spherical black hole background , the black hole starts to be unstable due to the perturbation at bigger value of the ads radius @xmath77 , while for the hyperbolic case , the black hole begins unstable at smaller @xmath77 than that of the flat case . inserting these @xmath77 into the temperature expression , we observe that the critical temperature to break the background stability satisfies @xmath78 .",

    "the spherical background is the easiest to be destroyed due to the perturbation .",

    "recently it was argued that the negative curvature topology can make the superconductor gapless and give a geometrical mechanism of conductivity @xcite .",
    "more studies in this direction is called for .",
    "the growing mode was caused by the interaction between scalar field and the maxwell field , which has never been observed in the perturbation of a single classical field in the black hole background @xcite .",
    "the process of the blow up ( or the scalar condensation ) can be understood as arising in part from the temperature of the black hole , but also as arising from the other two factors which lead to the negative effective mass of the scalar field , the charge @xmath64 and the mass @xmath79 of the scalar field . to see the influence of these two factors , we fix the value of the black hole background , @xmath80 and @xmath7 .",
    "if @xmath64 is big , the electric field outside the horizon is big .",
    "for the same mass of the scalar field , @xmath81 will become negative provided that @xmath64 is big enough , this can be seen from ( [ meff ] ) .",

    "when @xmath66 , there is no coupling between the scalar field and the maxwell field , the perturbation always decays .",

    "for smaller mass of the scalar field , it is easier for @xmath81 to be negative outside the horizon and to produce an unstable mode in @xmath19 , this can happen even for the smaller value of @xmath82 , which is shown in the right panel of fig.5 .    in fig.6",
    ", we also exhibit the result of the perturbation for 5-dimensional flat black hole background . comparing with that of the 4-dimensional situation ( shown in fig.2 )",
    ", the blow up of the perturbation can appear at smaller values of @xmath77 and @xmath82 .",
    "for fixing @xmath33 , inserting the values of @xmath77 into the temperature expression , we have @xmath83 .",
    "this shows that the instability of the 4-dimensional rn ads black hole can happen at higher temperature than that in 5-dimensions .",
    "however when we fix the same ads radius in 4-dimensions and 5-dimensions , we observe that the critical value of the charge of the scalar field to break the stability is smaller for the 5-dimensional case .",
    "this implies that for the same black hole parameters ( @xmath84 ) , the stability of the black hole spacetime can be broken easier in the high dimensions .",
    "this result supports the finding that the scalar hair can be formed easier in the higher dimensional background @xcite .",
    "in this section we will study the perturbation of the scalar field coupled to maxwell field in the background of ads soliton .",
    "recently the signature of the hawking - page phase transition between the ricci flat ads black hole and the ads soliton @xcite was observed in the qnm spectrum of the scalar perturbation in @xcite .",
    "it was argued that there is a phase transition in the ads soliton configuration and the superconducting phase will appear dual to an ads soliton @xcite .",
    "it is of interest to study the evolution of the perturbation in the charged ads soliton background and get more understanding on this phase transition .    by analytically continuing the ricci flat black hole one obtains the ads soliton @xcite @xmath85 to satisfy the einstein equation the function @xmath86 is in the same form as eq.([f ] ) but with a negative sign before @xmath87 .",

    "@xmath99 and @xmath100 ( @xmath101 ) are the eigenvalues of @xmath102    we observed that the negative effective mass term plays an important role in producing growing modes in the rn - ads black hole .",
    "however in the charged ads soliton case , due to the coordinate transformation , @xmath103 substitutes @xmath23 in the second term of the effective mass .",
    "since @xmath103 is always positive , the effective mass will always be positive provided that @xmath104 is not too negative .",
