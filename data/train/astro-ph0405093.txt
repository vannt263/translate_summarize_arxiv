    "it has long been recognized that the starburst occurring in the central region of ngc  5253 must be among the youngest in the local universe , and that this star forming process may be the first to have occurred in this galaxy in the last @xmath13yr ( van den bergh 1980 ; moorwood & glass 1982 ; rieke , lebofsky , & walker 1988 ) .",
    "ngc  5253 appears to have been a metal poor dwarf elliptical before the current burst of star formation , and after the current burst of star formation it may evolve back to a dwarf elliptical galaxy with a bright core such as those in the virgo and fornax clusters ( caldwell & phillips 1989 ) .",
    "one of the longstanding questions is the triggering mechanism for the central starburst of ngc  5253 .",
    "it has been suggested that the nuclear burst of star formation was triggered as the result of an interaction with the neighboring galaxy m83 ( van den bergh 1980 ; caldwell & phillips 1989 ) .",
    "recently meier , turner , & beck ( 2002 ) have found that only the giant molecular cloud in the dust lane intersecting the galaxy , among the five detected in co(2 - 1 ) , is sufficiently nearby to be associated with the central starburst .",
    "more interestingly , these authors have shown that gas is falling into the nucleus of this galaxy , suggesting that this may be the mechanism for fuelling the starburst .",
    "evidence for an extremely young and powerful burst of star formation in the central region of ngc  5253 comes from different observational clues . the nuclear radio and millimeter continuum emission are almost entirely due to thermal emission from hii regions ( beck et al .",
    "1996 ; mohan , anantharamaiah , & goss 2001 ; meier et al .",
    "both the detection of wolf - rayet optical features ( walsh & roy 1987 ; conti 1991 ) and the high stellar temperature ( @xmath14k ) , inferred from the near - infrared hei(@xmath15m)/br10 line ratio ( vanzi & rieke 1997 ) and mid - infrared emission lines ( beck et al .",
    "1996 ; crowther et al .",
    "1999 ; thornley et al .",
    "2000 ) , can only be explained with the presence of massive stars ( imf extending to at least @xmath16 , see rigby & rieke 2004 ) .",
    "finally cowan & branch ( 1982 ) searched for two historical supernovae in this galaxy using the vla , and did not detect them , or any other radio supernovae , indicating that the burst must be very young .",
    "the star formation appears to be occurring in a relatively small region of the galaxy on the observed h@xmath5 emission ( calzetti et al .",
    "1997 ) and the compact mid - infrared emission of this galaxy ( rieke 1976 ) .",
    "thus , ngc  5253 offers us an ideal opportunity to study the early stages of extragalactic star formation in the relatively confined nuclear region of this galaxy .    throughout the paper",
    "we assume a distance to ngc  5253 of @xmath4mpc ( sandage et al .",
    "_ hst_/nicmos observations of ngc  5253 were obtained in january 1998 using the nic2 camera , with a pixel size of 0.076pixel@xmath17 .",
    "the filters used were f110w , f160w and f222 m , roughly equivalent to ground - based filters @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 respectively .",
    "in addition , narrow band observations through the f187n and f190n filters , covering the pa@xmath5 ( @xmath21m)+ continuum and @xmath22 m continuum , respectively , were obtained .",
    "the raw images were reduced with routines from the package nicred ( mcleod 1997 ) .",
    "the main steps in the data reduction involve subtraction of the first readout , dark current subtraction on a readout - by - readout basis , correction for linearity and cosmic ray rejection ( using fullfit ) , and flat fielding .",
    "the flux calibration was performed using the conversion factors derived from measurements of the standard star p330-e during the servicing mission observatory verification ( smov ) program ( marcia rieke , private communication 1999 ) .",
    "nicmos only provides continuum bands to the red of the emission lines .",
    "the extinction in the nuclear region of ngc  5253 is known to be very high ( even at infrared wavelengths ; e.g. , turner et al . 2003 and references therein ) , and a straight subtraction of the longer wavelength continuum image may result in an overcorrection of the continuum at the wavelength of the emission line .",
    "we fit the continuum between @xmath23 m and @xmath22 m ( using the nic2 f160w and nic2 f190n line - free images ) on a pixel - by - pixel basis , and interpolate to estimate the continuum at @xmath24 m .",
    "this interpolated continuum is then subtracted from the line+continuum image to produce the continuum subtracted pa@xmath5 image .",
    "the fully - reduced images were rotated to the usual orientation with north up , east to the left .",
    "they are shown in fig .  1 .",
    "in addition , we constructed infrared color maps equivalent to ground - based @xmath25 ( f110w - f160w ) and @xmath26 ( f160w - f222 m ) color maps .",
    "we have obtained simultaneous intermediate resolution @xmath20 ( @xmath27 m ) and @xmath11 band ( @xmath28 m ) spectroscopy of the central region of ngc  5253 using spex ( rayner et al . 2003 ) at the 3 m nasa irtf telescope on mauna kea in march 2003 .",
    "we used the 0.15pixel @xmath17 plate scale and a slit width of 1.6  which provided a spectral resolution of @xmath29 in the @xmath20-band .",
    "the slit was oriented approximately north - south to cover the nucleus ( c1+c2 , section  3.1 , fig .",
    "2 ) of ngc  5253 plus the bright star cluster c3+c3 to the southwest of the nucleus ( see table  1 and fig .  2 ) . the c4+c5 cluster ( see fig .  2 ) was sufficiently bright and pointlike at the guider resolution that we could use it for the tip - tilt capability , thus improving the spatial sampling of the data .",
    "the total on - source integration time was 30 minutes .",
    "the seeing conditions as measured from standard star observations were approximately @xmath30 ( fwhm ) in the @xmath20-band .",
    "we also obtained @xmath31 spectroscopy of two comparison galaxies henize 2 - 10 and ngc  2903 in a similar fashion .",
    "observations of solar - type stars were interspersed with the galaxy observations selected to be at similar air masses , and used to perform the telluric correction .",
    "we used the data reduction package spextool ( cushing , vacca , & rayner 2004 ) especially developed to reduce spex data .",
    "briefly , we created calibration frames ( flatfields and arcs ) , median combined the galaxy observations , flatfielded the data , extracted 1d spectra , and performed the wavelength calibration using sky lines and arcs .",
    "the 1-d spectra of the nuclear region of ngc  5253 were extracted with apertures : @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "we also extracted a @xmath20-band spectrum of the c3+c3 cluster through a @xmath32 aperture .",
    "standard stars at a similar airmass observed before and after the galaxy were reduced in a similar fashion and used to perform the correction of the galaxy spectra for atmospheric transmission .",
    "the flux calibration of the galaxy spectra was obtained from the observations of the standard stars .",
    "we compared the spex @xmath20-band continuum level with the flux measured in the nic2 f222 m images through the same extraction apertures and found that they agree to within 10% .",
    "the fully reduced spex spectra corrected for the standard star blackbody temperature , flux - calibrated and shifted to rest frame wavelengths are shown in fig .",
    "3 . line fluxes and equivalent widths ( ew ) for the main emission lines are given in table  2 .",
    "fully reduced _ hst_/wfpc2 images of ngc  5253 through the f255w , f547 m and f814w filters ( calzetti et al . 1997 ) were retrieved from the _ hst _ archive .",
    "these observations placed the central part of the galaxy on the wp3 chip providing a plate scale of @xmath34 pixel@xmath17 .",
    "in addition we retrieved images through the f555w and f814w filters where the galaxy was centered on the wp1 chip providing higher spatial resolution . because the [ oiii]@xmath355007  emission line in the central region of ngc  5253 is bright ( e.g. , gonzlez - riestra , rego , & zamorano 1987 )",
    ", we expect it to have a large contribution to the photometry through the f555w filter .",
    "we thus use the f555w image for comparing the optical and near - infrared morphologies , but not for star cluster photometry .",

    "briefly , the hii selection and photometry procedure is as follows .",
    "first the program selects local maxima ; then we set a brightness limit for the pixel to be included as part of an hii region that the pixel must have an intensity above the local background of at least 3 times the rms noise of the local background ( see rand 1992 for more details on the criteria employed ) . after identifying the hii region ,",

    "the nuclear photometry is summarized in table  4 .    for the photometry of the _ hst_/wfpc2 and nicmos broad - band images we simulated the spectroscopy aperture on the images , and the local background was estimated from annuli around the nucleus taking care that they did not include faint star clusters .",

    "the isocam images of ngc  5253 show at all five wavelengths a bright point source superimposed on a faint extended component .",
    "the emission from the point source is unresolved , as determined from the comparison of the measured fwhm of the nuclear source with the sizes of theoretical psfs ( with sizes typically of @xmath126 fwhm depending on the wavelength , okumura 1998 ) .",

    "this photometry is in good agreement with the @xmath127 m spectrophotometry through a 5.4-diameter aperture of aitken et al .",

    "the ground - based small aperture mid - infrared fluxes are consistent with the isocam unresolved fluxes , giving us confidence that most of the small aperture mid - infrared emission is from the nucleus.m source with a much higher surface brightness than other star forming galaxies in their sample .",

    "the most striking feature revealed by the _",

    "( 1997 ) and meurer et al .",
    "( 1995 ) , respectively .",
    "indeed the nicmos f222 m image shows that the western cluster c2 dominates the emission at @xmath115 m .",
    "we thus identify the eastern star cluster c1 with the peak of the h@xmath5 emission and youngest optical star cluster ( ngc  5253 - 5 in calzetti et al .",
    "1997 notation ) .",
    "the western star cluster c2 becomes the brightest source at @xmath115 m ( see table 1 , and fig .",

    "bright pa@xmath5 emission is detected from both star clusters , and the two hii regions are named h2 ( at the location of c2 ) and h1 ( at the location of c1 ) , see table  3 .",
    "the h@xmath5 luminosity derived from the pa@xmath5 luminosity ( not corrected for extinction ) using the theoretical line ratios in hummer & storey 1987 ) of h2 indicates that this source has the typical brightness of giant hii regions , e.g. , 30 doradus .",

    "roche et al .  ( 1991 ) and clavel et al .",
    "( 2000 ) have shown that the strength of the @xmath256 m pah feature depends strongly on environment : galaxies classified as seyfert 1 show little to no @xmath256 m emission , while many type 2 agn ( see also imanishi , 2002 and 2003 for a study of the @xmath10 m feature ) and most pure starburst galaxies show strong pah features .",
    "this behavior implies that as the radiation field density increases , the pah carrier is progressively destroyed .",
    "this picture is supported by m82 where the @xmath10 m pah emission is found to be anti - correlated with both the centrally peaked continuum emission and also with the br@xmath106 emission ( normand et al .",
    "a similar situation is observed in ngc  253 where there is a decrease of the ratio of @xmath10 m pah emission to continuum at the sites of strong star formation ( tacconi - garman et al .",
    "2004 ) .",
    "dwarf galaxies in the metallicity range @xmath257 tend to show weak or no mid - infrared pah features from iso data ( madden 2002 ; thuan , sauvage , & madden 1999 ) or ground - based observations ( roche et al .",

    "8 are the spectra for some of these galaxies , including a second dwarf galaxy , he2 - 10 , with an age of @xmath259myr and metallicity of @xmath260 ( kobulnicky , kennicutt , & pizagno 1999 ) .",
    "for ngc  2903 we have spectra for the quiescent nucleus and one of the bright hii regions to the north of the nucleus ( see alonso - herrero et al .",
    "the @xmath10 m feature is clearly detected in he2 - 10 and in the bright hii region of ngc  2903 , as well as in all starburst galaxies in our sample with metallicities @xmath261 .",
    "we also show that the highly obscured starburst / agn ngc  4945 ( @xmath11-band spectroscopy from spoon et al .",
    "2003 ) has bright @xmath10 m pah emission , indicating that this feature can be detected regardless of the extinction ( imanishi 2002 ) .",
    "the effects of metallicity and a harsh environment are coupled for young starbursts as in the nucleus of ngc  5253 .",
    "as metallicity decreases stars present harder spectra , and wolf - rayet stars require larger mass progenitors thus creating a hard and intense radiation field that could suppress the formation of the @xmath10 m pah feature . as discussed in tacconi - garman et",
    "al . ( 2004 ) and references therein , in strong radiation fields the efficiency of @xmath10 m pah emission can be lowered by photoionization of the pah molecules , or by destruction of the pah molecules .",
    "rigby & rieke ( 2004 ) have demonstrated that the observed mid - infrared fine structure lines of the low metallicity starbursts ngc  5253 and ii  zw40 can only be reproduced with a salpeter imf extending to @xmath262 , whereas for their sample of high mass , solar metallicity starbursts the interstellar radiation field will not include the outputs of stars above @xmath263 because most of them are probably embedded in compact hii regions .",
    "although the number of low metallicity starbursts analyzed in rigby & rieke ( 2004 ) is small , there seems to be an indication that in these systems the interstellar medium is less effective in confining ultracompact hii regions , and thus a harsher radiation field environment is present that can effectively decrease or even suppress the @xmath10 m pah emission .",
    "we have analyzed _ hst_/nicmos observations ( @xmath0 m ) and obtained @xmath1 m spectroscopy of the central region of the dwarf galaxy ngc  5253 .",
    "the nicmos images have revealed the presence of a double cluster ( c1+c2 ) in the nucleus of the galaxy separated by @xmath264  or @xmath3pc for the assumed distance of @xmath4mpc .",
    "this double cluster is also a bright double source of pa@xmath5 emission .",
    "we have also analyzed _",
    "hst_/wfpc2 observations and found that the western cluster ( c2 ) is almost entirely obscured at uv and optical wavelengths , but becomes the brightest source in the galaxy at @xmath265 m .",
    "the double cluster c1+c2 appears to be coincident with the double radio nebula detected at 1.3 cm by turner et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , and it is likely to be responsible for most of the mid - infrared nuclear emission in this galaxy ( see also turner & beck 2004 ) .    the high spatial resolution of the _ hst_/nicmos images allows us to measure the near - infrared magnitudes , ew of pa@xmath5 and pa@xmath5 luminosities of c1 and c2 .",
    "if the star formation in the double cluster c1+c2 occurred in an instantaneous burst , c1 and c2 have virtually the same age ( @xmath266 million years ) .",
    "this young age for the double cluster is consistent with estimates by other authors for cluster c1 from uv / optical imaging and spectroscopy ( e.g. , calzetti et al .",
    "1997 ; harris et al .",
    "2004 ) , and the presence of wolf - rayet features in the optical spectrum of the nucleus of the galaxy ( walsh & roy 1987 ; conti 1991 ) .",
    "although both nuclear clusters appear to be coeval , c2 is more massive and obscured than c1 .",
    "the stellar mass for c2 is in the range of @xmath7 ( for a salpeter imf in the mass range @xmath8 ) , depending on the dust emission contribution to the observed @xmath20-band magnitude , thus putting c2 in the category of super star clusters .",
    "the stellar mass of c1 is @xmath267 .",
    "the fact that both c1 and c2 appear to be coeval but c2 is much more massive than c1 appears to conflict with the naive expectation that more massive clusters would blow away their birth clouds first . using @xmath20 and @xmath11-band hydrogen recombination lines and near - infrared colors",
    "we have inferred a very high obscuration for c2 , suggesting that this young star cluster may be still ( partially ) embedded in its natal cloud .",
    "the age derived using the ew of pa@xmath5 assumes that the extinction to the stars and gas is the same . if this is not the case , as discussed in calzetti et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , that is , stars , gas and dust are mixed , then the derived age of c2 would be only an upper limit .",
    "turner & beck ( 2004 ) have put forward some alternative explanations to that of the presence of a coeval double cluster in the nucleus of ngc  5253 .",
    "one possibility they discuss is that cluster c1 is not a cluster but a reflection nebula from a gap opening in the cocoon around the infrared cluster .",
    "their second scenario is that the supernebula is cometary and that what we are seeing in the nucleus of ngc  5253 is motion of the hii region / cluster to the west and north .",
    "we favor the interpretation of a double cluster in the nucleus of ngc  5253 that has resulted from triggered star formation , due to infalling gas along the minor axis of the galaxy ( see meier et al .",
    "the south - east elongation of the radio supernebula detected by turner & beck ( 2004 ) shows a morphology similar to the pa@xmath5 emission ( fig .  4 , left panel ) , but we find that the bright nuclear pa@xmath5 emission is extended over scales of a few arcseconds , whereas the radio supernebula is very compact ( @xmath268 , see turner & beck for more details ) . from the @xmath19-band nicmos image of the central @xmath269",
    "it is clear that there are a number of near - infrared clusters with no pa@xmath5 emission , but there must be other ionizing clusters ( not detected as bright sources of @xmath133 m emission ) that are responsible for the extended pa@xmath5 emission .",
    "moreover , we have derived a very young age ( @xmath270 million years ) using the @xmath20-band spectrum for the circumnuclear region _ excluding _",
    "c1 and c2 .",
    "this all seems to indicate that what we are seeing are the effects of self - propagating star formation in the central region of ngc  5253 .",
    "in addition to the nuclear double cluster , we have identified a total of 269 star clusters in the @xmath19-band over the observed region of @xmath124 , and measured their near - infrared magnitudes as well as the ew of pa@xmath5 .",
    "assuming that the ew of hydrogen recombination lines are good indicators of the age , we find that @xmath271 of the detected clusters in the @xmath19-band have ages younger than approximately 7 million years .",
    "these young clusters have stellar masses of between @xmath272 and @xmath273 .",
    "we finally model the nuclear uv to mid - infrared sed of ngc  5253 using the model of takagi et al .",
    "( 2003a ) , and compare it to the sed of the entire galaxy .",
    "for the nuclear sed we have taken special care to measure and subtract the underlying galaxy emission to isolate as much as possible the uv to mid - infrared emission of the double star cluster . for a salpeter imf we find that the nuclear infrared sed is well reproduced with a total stellar mass of @xmath274 and an age of 3.2 million years in good agreement with the estimates using the photometry and spectroscopy of c1+c2 .",
    "the modelling of the nuclear sed shows that the young starburst is very obscured , @xmath275mag , in good agreement with extinction estimates obtained from near - infrared hydrogen recombination lines .",
    "the uv - optical sed of the nuclear region is not well reproduced by the model probably due to the complicated dust and emitting source geometry of the nuclear region .",
    "the comparison between the nuclear and entire galaxy sed modelling shows that up to 50% of the dust mass in this galaxy is concentrated in the nucleus .",
    "the model of the nuclear sed of ngc  5253 also predicts a moderately bright @xmath10 m pah feature that is not observed in our nuclear @xmath11-band spectrum .",
    "the @xmath10 m pah feature along with the mid - infrared pah features are detected in most massive starburst galaxies , but appear to be weak or absent in low mass and metallicity dwarf star forming galaxies .",
    "rigby & rieke ( 2004 ) have recently demonstrated that the star formation properties of ngc  5253 , in particular the mid - infrared fine structure line ratios , can only be reproduced with a salpeter imf where the upper mass cutoff is @xmath276 . in the other more massive and metal rich starbursts in their sample the interstellar radiation field may not include the outputs of stars above @xmath263 because most of them are probably embedded in compact hii regions . the fact that low metallicity stars produce a harder radiation field together with the presense of massive stars in the nuclear starburst of ngc  5253 result in a more intense and harder radiation field that could effectively suppress the production of the @xmath10 m pah feature .",
