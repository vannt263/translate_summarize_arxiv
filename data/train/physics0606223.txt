    "this has motivated ideas of building quantum simulators for solid state phenomena , and even quantum computers  @xcite . for such purposes",
    "one needs a wide - ranging and versatile toolbox for the quantum control of atomic motion .    in optical lattices atoms",
    "can either move in the bloch bands of the periodic structure , or become localized at lattice sites ( not forgetting the interesting intermediate region where the motion or  hopping \" takes place by quantum tunnelling between the lattice sites ) . here",
    "we consider the case of rather deep localization , where the eigenstates of the atomic center - of - mass states are quite discrete in energy and become the vibrational states of a single lattice site .",
    "our aim is to develop a tool for moving atoms efficiently and selectively to these vibrational states if they are initially in the vibrational ground state .",
    "especially , we want to consider the case where the state change is associated with a move from one lattice site to another .",
    "we approach the problem with ideas originally proposed for the quantum control of vibrational states in dimer molecules  @xcite .",
    "note that for atoms the vibrational states are center - of - mass states , whereas in molecules they correspond to the internal motion , i.e. , relative motion of the nuclei .",
    "an efficient method to move molecules between vibrational states is stirap ( stimulated raman adiabatic passage )  @xcite , which is based on the existence of a noninteracting eigenstate in a three - level system and a counterintuitive pulse sequence . the advantage of the method is its high efficiency ( population transfer is nearly complete ) , robustness in relation to the parameters , and the elimination of the intermediate state . for molecules as well as for atoms in a lattice the intermediate state would usually be an electronically excited one , which normally decays rapidly and incoherently .    the standard stirap approach , however , is strongly dependent on overlap integrals between the vibrational states , which in molecules means favorable franck - condon factors .",
    "this limits the achievable  stretching \" of the molecules as the process needs to adhere to the franck - condon principle .",
    "in addition , any implementation for optical lattices would require additional pulsed laser fields .",
    "an interesting and viable alternative in molecules is offered by very strong pulses , which actually affect the vibrational state structure  @xcite . as demonstrated in ref .",
    "@xcite , this situation can be modelled with lip s , i.e. , light - induced potentials , which are the time - dependent potential surfaces associated with the instantaneous eigenstates of the combined system of three electronic states and two pulses .",
    "in fact , the process is described by adiabatic evolution along a single lip , which efficiently takes the molecule from one electronic state to another .",
    "as the equilibrium positions associated with each electronic state may be quite different , the process leads to an apparent breakdown of the franck - condon principle .",
    "later it was shown that with a proper setting of parameters one can decide whether the vibrational state is changed during the process as well  @xcite .    here",
    "we show that the same method is applicable for atoms in optical lattices or in double - well structures .",
    "first we demonstrate that under suitable conditions we can indeed reduce the system of three states and two pulses into a single time - dependent potential .",

    "[ sec : derivation ] , this is not so straightforward as one could assume .",
    "the fact that the process is not completely adiabatic ( as noted in ref .",

    "in case of molecular dimers , the system is originally described in terms of a three - component state vector consisting of electronic state wave functions  @xcite . next we present a highly simplified picture of a dimer system .",
    "the advantage is that the description of the system can be generalized beyond the dimer concept to any suitable three - state case , and then reduced to a single - state model .",
    "both cases , three state and single state , are in principle applicable to suitable optical lattice systems , and furthermore , the latter model can be also used to describe situations which are genuinely single - state cases , i.e. , there is no underlying three - state structure present .",

    "also , we have above applied the rotating wave approximation ( rwa ) , which allows us to shift potentials appropriately .",
    "thus the potentials @xmath9 are parameterized by trapping frequencies @xmath10 and detunings @xmath11 , and the coupling terms @xmath12 include maximum rabi frequencies @xmath13 and time scales for the pulses @xmath14 .",
    "the role of parameters and the effect of rwa is demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : schematicpotentials ] .",
    "we assume that @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "this assumption is justified because the effect of @xmath17 is merely a universal shift in the energy levels and the shape of the potential @xmath18 does not have any significant effect on the results  @xcite .",

    "the potential matrix   can always be diagonalized and we obtain three real eigenvalues as a result .",

    "[ sec : vibrational ] .",
    "the number of parameters in the full three - state model is very large : maximum rabi frequencies  @xmath13 , detunings  @xmath11 , trapping frequencies @xmath10 , time scales of pulses  @xmath14 , and pulse delay @xmath68 .",
    "furthermore , one can consider asymmetric pulse shapes , chirped pulses or some different potential geometry .",
    "consequently , the parameter space is too large for a complete mapping , and we limit our discussion to the effect of @xmath57 , @xmath69 , and @xmath59 within the previous parameter settings . with these three parameters , we are already able to target arbitrary vibrational states of both @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "the sign of @xmath57 is essential .",
    "choosing @xmath70 , i.e. , locating @xmath71 below the other two curves , will result in the very robust aplip process  @xcite , in which the wave packet is smoothly transferred from one ground state to another , but no other tailoring is possible .",
    "the opposite selection leads to much richer dynamics and excitations become possible as well  @xcite , but we pay for it with the dynamics becoming far more sensitive to the parameters . in short ,",
    "as long as @xmath72 is large enough , its sign is a sufficient switch between the two cases . from an alternative point of view , changing the sign of @xmath57 is also equivalent to swapping the pulses @xmath73 .",
    "the role of @xmath59 is intuitively clear : the more powerful are the couplings , the more are the adiabatic potentials modulated . on the other hand , @xmath59 and",
    "@xmath72 counteract each other , such that the larger @xmath72 , the larger values of @xmath59 are needed to modify the potentials by the required amount .",
    "of course , they do not exactly cancel each other , since lower values of @xmath72 tend to allow the wells to broaden , too . nevertheless , the cancellation is efficient from the point of view of regions close to the minima of the wells , where the dynamics is also concentrated .",
    "therefore , the counterplay between the detuning @xmath57 and the coupling strength @xmath59 explains , e.g. , the plotted stripe structure of fig .  3 in ref .",
    "we have verified the existence of these stripes also in our single - state model .",
    "the detuning @xmath58 between potentials @xmath36 and @xmath37 has an obvious function .",
    "if the potentials @xmath74 are to be considered one by one , they each have their own ( and in this case the same ) frequency @xmath75 .",
    "because of our scaling , the corresponding energy difference between the harmonic eigenstates is @xmath76 in the scaled units . starting with @xmath61",
    ", we can find such combinations of parameters that will lead to the transfer of the population from one ground state to another as in fig .  [",
    "fig : evolution1d](a ) .",
    "the basic idea is that lowering @xmath37 by @xmath77 will drive the population now into the first excited state with approximately the same parameters [ cf .",
    "[ fig : evolution1d](b ) ] .",
    "this generalizes to higher excited states as well : @xmath78 , @xmath79 , will lead to the @xmath80th excited state of potential 2 .",
    "interestingly , by setting @xmath81 and keeping @xmath82 we always get the initial state , i.e. , lowest vibrational state of potential 1 back , but by increasing @xmath59 we can reach the higher vibrational states of potential 1 .",

    "[ fig : deltavsomega ] we can see that the final outcome forms regular patterns .",
    "especially , clear systematicity arises . on the one hand ,",
    "higher vibrational states of @xmath36 are gained by increasing @xmath59 while @xmath58 acts only in a periodic way . on the other hand ,",
    "the higher vibrational states of @xmath37 are achieved by decreasing @xmath58 while @xmath59 has no significant role .      in order to understand the role of the parameter choices and the dynamics in general , we have followed ref .",
    "@xcite and analyzed the situation by solving the instantaneous vibrational states of the relevant lip ( we call them lip eigenstates ) . if the two wells are sufficiently separated , the lowest few lip eigenstates are very much similar to those of two single harmonic potentials @xmath36 and @xmath37 , except for the narrow degenerated cases , when the energies of two lip eigenstates coincide .",
    "as the energy of a lip eigenstate gets comparable to the height of the separating potential barrier , it starts to have non - negligible component in both wells , as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : vibrationalbasisviblip ] .        during the pulses",
    "the double - well potential gets modulated in such a manner , that the potential barrier becomes lower or even disappears .",
    "accordingly , the set of corresponding lip eigenstates changes as well .",
    "as the height of the barrier gradually decreases , the minima of the two wells move with respect to each other in energy . with large enough values of @xmath59 ,",
    "the changes are considerable , if compared to the energy separations @xmath83 .",
    "consequently , in terms of the lip eigenstates , the states approximately corresponding to the single - well eigenstates appear to cross each other .",
    "this phenomenon can be easily seen in the energy spectra ( cf .",
    "[ fig : delta2nonzero ] ) .",
    "of course , there is always a small energy gap between the energies , i.e. , the crossings are in fact avoided .",
    "the sharp crossings are an indication of diabatic evolution .",
    "let us define crossing time scale @xmath84 where @xmath85 is the @xmath80th lip vibrational eigenstate . with the given choice of parameters , the transformations from one eigenstate to another happen in time scale of @xmath86 , which is less than the vibrational time scale of the potential @xmath87 .",
    "accordingly , the wave packet can not succeed in following these changes in the vibrational basis , and therefore a diabatic jump between the lip eigenstates occurs .    between the sharp diabatic crossings , the system follows a particular lip eigenstate adiabatically .",
    "adiabatic following occurs when the energy gap between the two approaching lip eigenstates is large .",
    "consequently , in case there are many possible energy level crossings , the time scale of potential modulations @xmath88 can be used as a switch to determine which crossings are passed diabatically and which adiabatically .",
    "by making a crossing into a mixture of diabatic and adiabatic , one can reach superpositions , although the precise result is likely to be very sensitive on parameter values .",
    "it is worthwhile to emphasize , that the seemingly rapid and radical changes in the appearence of the wave packet typically around @xmath89 and @xmath90 do not have anything to do with diabatic crossings . in fig .",
    "[ fig : vibrationalbasisviblip ] we have plotted the lip eigenstates corresponding the choice of parameters in fig .  [ fig : delta2nonzero](d ) . by comparing these figures , it is obvious , that the diabatic jump occurs already at @xmath91 , when nothing seems to happen in the time evolution .",
    "interestingly , the subsequent changes in the course of evolution are in fact due to the evolution of the corresponding lip eigenstate itself . therefore , all the visible transformations are actually a manifestation of adiabatic following .    returning to the discussion of fig .",
    "[ fig : deltavsomega ] in the preceding section , we are now ready to give explanation to the pattern .",
    "let us denote the number of sharp lip energy level crossings by @xmath92 , where @xmath80 and @xmath93 , respectively , count the crossings before and after the pulse maxima .",
    "for example , the situation in fig .",
    "[ fig : delta2nonzero](a ) corresponds to the notation @xmath94 .",
    "the edges of the zones arise for two reasons .",
    "first , those with a positive slope occur because a new lip energy level crossing is being formed prior to the pulses , i.e. , @xmath95 at the edge .",
    "second , those with a negative slope are associated with a creation of a crossing after the pulses , i.e. , @xmath96 at the edge .",
    "yet another rule for crossings can be formulated , but it does not correspond to any visible edge in the mapping .",
    "the third rule is , that when passing the resonance detuning @xmath97 from above , one crossing travels via infinity from left to right , i.e. , @xmath98 .",
    "illustration of the rules is given in fig .",

    "if @xmath101 , then a state in @xmath37 is reached , such that each increment of @xmath102 in @xmath58 introduces one step higher excitations . advancing towards greater values of @xmath59 brings along more diabatic jumps .",
    "naturally , the stability suffers as the complexity of the process increases , which can be seen as a degeneration of the pattern with large values of @xmath59 .",
    "so far we have studied only the one - dimensional case . in two dimensions , we set the potentials symmetric for simplicity and apply a time - dependent shift to the potentials @xmath36 and @xmath37 . the shifting is the same as previously in the one - dimensional case , but it is conducted only in one direction , as defined in eq .  .",
    "there is no coupling between the cartesian coordinates @xmath103 and @xmath104 in the potentials @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",

    "the initial position is chosen such that the minima of both @xmath113 and @xmath112 coincide , i.e. , @xmath122 .",
    "furthermore , approximately @xmath123 is needed .",
    "the scaling is chosen as previously with an added assumption that @xmath124 .",
    "accordingly , the recoil energies @xmath125 of the lattice fields become @xmath126 and @xmath127 in the scaled units .    for simplicity ,",
    "let us consider only one lattice site located initially at @xmath128 .",
    "at first , the wave packet is at rest at the bottom of the well .",
    "thereafter , the @xmath112 potential sweeps one - half of its wavelength to the right .",
    "meanwhile , the wave packet gets driven uphill by the moving potential barrier . however , since the barrier effectively becomes lower after having passed the @xmath128 point , the wave packet will drop down to a vibrational state of a newly created well around @xmath128 .",
    "the point is that from the perspective of the initial ground state there will be only one set of energy level crossings during the period , when the wave packet is driven upwards in a local minimum , while a new global minimum is deepened on the other side of the barrier .",
    "the energy gaps in these crossings increase with the corresponding vibrational state number ( cf .",
    "[ fig : energyspectrumlatticemodulation ] ) .",
    "therefore , the sweep rate @xmath88 will determine which crossings are passed diabatically , and which are followed adiabatically .",
    "( color online ) the energy spectrum during lattice modulation as a function of the lattice offset parameter @xmath115 . here",

    "[ fig : evolutionlatticemodulation ] , a superposition of the first two excited states ( grey arrows ) is achieved by passing the first crossing diabatically ( black circle ) and the second partially diabatically ( grey circle).,width=302 ]      sinusoidal potentials are relatively flat and round if compared to the lip s described in sec .",
    "[ sec : derivation ] .",
    "therefore , the corresponding double - well structure holds a set of eigenstates , which do not represent eigenstates of individual wells very well , but are spread over both wells instead . consequently , in case of the higher vibrational states the energy level crossings are not as sharp as previously .",
    "accordingly , the population is after the sweep likely to be spread over a distribution of vibrational states , as the population leaks gradually at each energy level crossing .",
    "alternatively , a high control over the sweep rate @xmath131 is needed in order to slow down at the instant when adiabatic following during a crossing is wanted , and accelerate again thereafter in order to cross the other possible gaps diabatically .",
    "( color online ) time evolution during the lattice modulation .",
    "the second plot is a high - resolution view of the transition moment , and illustrates the speed of the process compared to the smoother behavior in the harmonic wells .",
    "the lattice parameters are chosen as in fig .",
    "[ fig : energyspectrumlatticemodulation ] and a constant sweep rate is applied.,width=302 ]    figure  [ fig : evolutionlatticemodulation ] shows an example of the lattice evolution corresponding to fig .  [ fig : energyspectrumlatticemodulation ] .",
    "the lattice offset is evolved linearly , i.e. , @xmath132 , where the constant sweep rate is @xmath133 .",
    "a superposition of the first two excited vibrational states is populated accordingly .",
    "the above - mentioned leaks of population to other vibrational states result in small oscillations of the final wave packet .",
    "the process of change is rather fast as expected , too .",
    "nevertheless , this example shows clearly that the ideas developed for the three - state system with two pulses can be carried over to the optical lattices .",
    "we have investigated a transition from a counterintuitively coupled three - state system into a single - state system described by a time - dependent double - well potential .",
    "thereafter , we have shown how the populations of the vibrational states in each well can be tailored by modulations of this double - well potential .",
    "the focus of our study was in investigation of necessary diabatic crossings blended among otherwise adiabatic following .",
    "the system holds basically three different time scales : ( i )  the intrinsic vibrational time scale @xmath134 induced by potential geometry , ( ii )  the general time scale of the modulation of the potential surface @xmath88 , and ( iii )  a set of time scales associated with the crossings of the lip eigenstates @xmath79 with their upper neighbors @xmath135 .",
    "first , @xmath136 is needed in order to have adiabatic following in general .",
    "second , the tailoring of the state populations is done by adjusting the set @xmath137 with respect to @xmath134 such that certain energy gaps are crossed diabatically while the others are avoided adiabatically .",
    "the values of @xmath138 are ultimately determined by the way the potential geometry is modified , but @xmath88 scales the overall time scale of the process .",
    "therefore , the adjustment of crossing time scales can be made by tuning either the potential parameters or the general time scale @xmath88 .    in this general model survey",
    "we have used scaled units rather than taking a specific physical system with fixed parameters .",
    "this was done intentionally in order to focus on describing the model itself . in practice",
    ", we expect that the results can be applied in various systems .",
    "a recent example is an optical lattice setup where one generates a periodic two - dimensional lattice of double - well structures , with controllable barrier heights and relative well depths  @xcite .",
    "another interesting situation arises when we consider our model from the viewpoint of a moving atom in an atom chip waveguide  @xcite .",
    "the position in our description can be considered as the transverse direction of the waveguide , and the time evolution corresponds to the change in the potential seen by the atom during its motion in the longitudinal direction .",
    "our model can then describe a controlled transfer process between two waveguides , with the additional possibility of exciting tranverse modes .",
    "our future investigations will consider the role of interactions in this process .",
    "the simplest system to study is a zero - temperature bose - einstein condensate .",
    "the interactions cause the lip eigenstate structure to depend on the momentary local density and this back - action needs to be taken into account . also , in two dimensions it will remove the separability of the coordinates .",
