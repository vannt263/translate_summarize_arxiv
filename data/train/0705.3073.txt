    "correlations among particles produced at high energies have always been a subject of great interest , starting from the beginning in hadronic collisions @xcite , and more recently in nuclear collisions @xcite . over the years an abundant supply of experimental data",
    "have been accumulated , some of which have very high statistics , especially in the work done at relativistic heavy - ion collider ( rhic ) . by comparison ,",
    "theoretical studies of the correlation phenomena in the bulk ( excluding high-  jets ) have been meager . before the basic processes in hadron collisions mainly at low",
    "are fully understood in a way that can be accepted as having a solid theoretical foundation , the profusion of nuclear data has inundated the subject that has no clear theoretical guidance , resulting in conflicting interpretations at times .",
    "the terms  long - range \" and  short - range \" correlations have been used , primarily in reference to what have been observed , rather than as properties of correlations understood at the level of parton interaction .",
    "star collaboration has produced extensive and detailed data on correlations in nuclear collisions @xcite as well as in @xmath0 collisions @xcite .",
    "the analyses have been done on autocorrelations in the angular difference variables @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "the method used is to invert the scale - dependent @xmath6 fluctuations @xcite , yielding a rich structure in correlations not seen by any other method .",
    "theoretical interpretation of the result is unfortunately grossly out of step with the growth of experimental information .",
    "earlier models , such as the dual parton model @xcite , were adequate to treat the problem at a level commensurate with the coarseness of the data available at the time , but no recent attempt has been made to calculate more accurately the basic correlations in @xmath0 collisions and to compare with the latest data .",
    "soft production is still based on the idea of string fragmentation , the implementation of which is not much different from the original lund model @xcite . on nuclear collisions efforts",
    "have been made to incorporate string fusion @xcite , but no explicit calculation on correlation has been done . very recently , the possibility of forward - backward correlation in the framework of color glass condensate has been advanced @xcite , but without quantitative result yet to be compared with data .    in view of the present theoretical status described above , a model - independent calculation on any portion of the problem",
    "would lead to an improvement of that status .",
    "there is , however , no feasible formalism for calculating soft qcd processes involving multiparticle production at low . instead of starting from first principles , it is sensible to examine relevant hints from the data and restrict the scope to the issues most salient for correlations .",
    "it is furthermore reasonable to start with @xmath0 collisions before tackling the complexity associated with nuclear collisions .",
    "careful analysis of the high - statistics data on the inclusive  in @xmath0 collisions at @xmath7 gev has revealed a two - component picture of the particle production process essentially independent of theoretical models @xcite .",
    "inferences on the properties of parton scattering are made .",
    "the dominant soft component gives rise to a correlation behavior in  that is drastically different from the contribution from the minor , but significant , harder component , as revealed by the porter - trainor analysis of autocorrelation for @xmath0 collisions @xcite .",
    "although the autocorrelation measure is the pearson s correlation coefficient that is the normalized version of the covariance of multiplicity densities , the  dependence is primarily the same as the forward - backward multiplicity covariance @xmath8 that has been determined without averaging over the rapidity sum @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "we shall focus on just that piece of data on @xmath8 and relate it to the basic partonic scattering process that has back - to - back correlation .",
    "the connection between scattering angle and pseudo - rapidity is carefully done at the parton level to reveal the basic structure in the  dependence after hadronization is incorporated to relate the partonic properties to the hadronic observables . since the processes are at low , there are inevitably some free parameters that are not fixed by our current understanding of soft physics . while the strength of correlation is adjustable to fit the data , there are no adjustable parameters to specify the range of correlation .",
    "thus an understanding of the  dependence will be the main finding in this study that is essentially independent of models .",
    "hadronization will be considered in the context of recombination , but details are not important in any essential way . a significant outcome of our study is the recognition that parton and hadron pseudo - rapidities can be sufficiently different that partons in one region may give rise to hadrons in another region , thereby cross - fertilizing forward and backward windows that are not too far apart .",
    "a correspondence of our result with the two components in the porter - trainor analysis will be attempted at the end of our study .",
    "we start with a brief discussion of the kinematical relationship between the parton and hadron variables .",
    "since the forward - backward correlation ( fbc ) is measured in terms of pseudo - rapidity without reference to the transverse momenta  of the detected hadrons , it is clear that the correlation properties are dominated by the hadrons produced at low , since high-  particles are severely suppressed . since pqcd is not valid at low , there is no reliable theoretical formalism in which rigorous calculation can be made .",
    "nevertheless , quarks and gluons are the constituents that interact , and those partons before and after scattering are the intermediary that bridges the initial state of the nucleons and the final state of multiparticles .",
    "we therefore seek some simple description of the parton state before hadronization in the hope that the observed fbc can be related to some basic properties of the partons .",
    "since the hadronic  is not specified in the measurement of fbc , there is no point in emphasizing the partonic transverse momenta @xmath10 , especially when their behavior is not calculable .",
    "hence , our focus will be on the angular properties of the partons and hadrons .",
    "let the parton and hadron momenta be denoted by @xmath11 and @xmath12 , respectively , and let their corresponding polar angles be @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "if the angle between @xmath11 and @xmath12 is denoted by @xmath15 , then we have @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the solid angle between the plane containing @xmath11 and @xmath12 and the plane containing @xmath11 and the @xmath18 axis .",
    "the @xmath15 dependence in the problem is a property of the hadronization process . at low  parton recombination",
    "is far more efficient , thus dominant , compared to fragmentation , which requires higher @xmath10 partons .",
    "the dynamical mechanism need not be specified at this stage of geometrical consideration , except to mention that another parton beside the one at @xmath11 , not necessarily collinear , has to be picked up to form the hadron at @xmath12 .",
    "let the hadronization cone be described by a gaussian  in @xmath15 @xmath19 where the normalization factor @xmath20 is determined by @xmath21 @xmath22 is the average number of hadrons produced by a parton .",
    "the cone width @xmath23 is expected to be small for @xmath0 collisions , and larger for aa collisions . for @xmath23",
    "much smaller than the range of angular integration in eq .",
    "( [ 3 ] ) , we approximate @xmath24 by @xmath15 so the integration can be readily carried out , yielding @xmath25 the differential form of eq .",
    "( [ 3 ] ) is @xmath26 at this stage of our discussion of hadronization it really does not matter whether hadrons are formed by recombination or fragmentation , since a hadronization cone is relevant in both cases .",
    "we postpone further discussion about hadronization until the following section , since what is described above is sufficient to lead us from the hadrons to the partons .",
    "we now consider the two - parton  of back - to - back scattering at low @xmath10 in the cm system of the partons .",
    "starting from the simplest possible form at this point , with allowance for complications to be included later , we write @xmath27 where @xmath28 , assuming temporarily that the partonic rest frame is the same as the @xmath0 cm system . since the two partons are exactly back - to - back , it is obviously a possible source of correlation at the partonic level .",
    "there can , of course , be other types of partonic interaction not describable in a simple form as in ) .",
    "however , it is not our problem here to provide a listing of all possible expressions of those interactions . our aim is to investigate to what extent the observed fbc at the hadronic level can be traced back to eq .",
    "( [ 6 ] ) .",
    "the @xmath29 function is , of course , to constrain @xmath30 that is only valid if the cm systems of partons and hadrons coincide . in reality",
    "the proton has a wide  of partons at low @xmath31 , so any pair of them from the two initial protons can have varying degree of mismatch between the two systems . thus in the @xmath0 system",
    "we must allow @xmath29 to be broadened , but the way in which it is to be done is not calculable , since these are all low-@xmath32 partons .",
    "we use a one - parameter description of the broadened  to replace @xmath29 : @xmath33^m ,    \\label{7}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which is forced to vanish at the kinematic limit @xmath34 and is normalized such that @xmath35 @xmath36 being the beta function .",
    "this  is roughly gaussian shaped in the finite interval that @xmath37 is allowed to vary , and can be broad when @xmath38 is small . since @xmath39 is a constant , we know that in the limit @xmath40 , @xmath41 can not give rise to any correlation between the two partons .",
    "thus for the correlated part , we must subtract the uncorrelated part and introduce @xmath42 which is what we shall use in place of @xmath29 for the correlation to be calculated below .",
    "let the pseudo - rapidity of a parton be denoted by @xmath43 , i.e. , @xmath44 from which can be derived @xmath45 using this in eqs .",

    "( [ 10 ] ) is to emphasize that it is the correlated part of the two - parton  we are describing .",
    "having obtained an expression for the correlated two - parton  in @xmath49 and @xmath50 , we now develop from it the correlated part of the two - hadron .",
    "equation ( [ 1 ] ) gives the relationship between the hadronic polar angle @xmath14 in terms of the partonic polar angle @xmath13 , with @xmath15 being the hadronization cone angle . since soft hadrons with @xmath51@xmath52 gev",
    "/ c dominate fbc , the participating partons that hadronize by recombination have transverse momenta @xmath10 in the range @xmath53 gev / c . for a quark with @xmath11 that hadronizes , it picks up an antiquark with momentum @xmath54 and forms a pion with momentum @xmath55 . the vectors @xmath11 and @xmath54 need not be exactly collinear , but their angular difference can not be too large , since the pion size is finite . in momentum space",
    "the uncertainty in the pion wave function is of the order of the pion mass , so the angular difference between @xmath11 and @xmath54 is of order 0.14/0.5 .",
    "the angle @xmath15 between @xmath11 and @xmath12 is about half that much .",
    "thus the hadronization cone width @xmath23 in eq .",
    "( 2 ) is roughly between 0.1 and 0.2 .",
    "the hadronization process considered here implies that only one pion is produced per inclusive parton , since we are not discussing the total number of hadrons formed from a fixed pool of partons .",
    "thus the normalization integral in ) is @xmath56 .",
    "the precise value of @xmath22 is unimportant in the situation where the parton density is not precisely known , exemplified by the undetermined parameter @xmath57 in ) .",
    "we have not been thorough in our discussion about the recombination process , nor have we mentioned specifically the role that gluons play .",
    "the details of such processes , including the conversion of gluons to quarks before hadronization , have been studied extensively before @xcite .",
    "they are omitted here since such details would not contribute to the clarification of any crucial issues at hand and would only distract the flow of our main concern here .    for a fixed parton momentum @xmath58 the probability of finding a hadron at angles @xmath59 relative to it",
    "is given by ) . to guarantee that )",
    "is satisfied for the hadron at @xmath14 , we define the hadron  per unit @xmath60 as @xmath61 such that @xmath62 where the range of integration corresponds to the angles in ) . carrying out the integration over @xmath17 in eq .",
    "( [ 12 ] ) we obtain @xmath63 in the realistic 3d geometry of the experiments the angular measure is in @xmath64 .",
    "the azimuthal angle @xmath65 around the beam axis is integrated over @xmath66 in both @xcite and @xcite , and is of no concern here .",
    "with the definition @xmath67 the hadron  in @xmath68 is related to the parton  in @xmath18 as @xmath69 in terms of the hadron pseudo - rapidity @xmath70 , as in ) , @xmath71 we have @xmath72 defining @xmath73 we then have for the two - hadron @xmath74 the hadronization function @xmath75 has no simple analytical form and is non - trivial . for small @xmath23 , @xmath75 may be shaped roughly as a gaussian , depending on @xmath43 .",
    "because of the non - linear relationship between polar angle and pseudo - rapidity , what is symmetric in @xmath15 as in ) can not be symmetric in @xmath70 around @xmath43 . in fig .  1 we show some illustrative examples of @xmath75 for @xmath76 and @xmath77 and 0.5 . as @xmath23 increases , the asymmetry in @xmath78 develops in the wings , and becomes more significant for higher @xmath43 ( not shown ) .",
    "the physics of hadronization is in the physical 3d momentum space involving @xmath15 , not in @xmath43 or @xmath70 . in aa collisions",
    "@xmath23 can be large and @xmath75 can be wide in @xmath78 .",
    "it is then unreliable to assume that a window in @xmath70 for the detected hadrons corresponds to a similar window in @xmath43 for the originating partons .",
    "returning to the two - hadron  given in ) we note that the two partons at @xmath49 and @xmath50 hadronize independently , but because of the finite width in @xmath78 of the @xmath79 functions , it is possible that for any given window in @xmath70 the detected hadrons in any given event can originate from both partons separately at different @xmath49 and @xmath50 . in other words , hadronization can  spill over \" from positive to negative sides , and vice - versa , even if the forward and backward windows are located symmetrically on the two sides of @xmath80 .",
    "putting ) in ( [ 19 ] ) we obtain for the correlated two - hadron @xmath81 note that without the @xmath82 function the integral is factorizable , resulting in no correlation .",
    "thus the non - factorizable @xmath82 is the source of fbc .",
    "the inverse - square factor @xmath83 suppresses the large @xmath43 contribution , so @xmath84 appears to have no long - range correlation .",
    "however , that factor is the jacobian of the transformation from @xmath18 to @xmath43 in ) and has no dynamical content .",
    "thus the designation of such terms as short- or long - range correlation can be misleading .",
    "to get fbc we integrate ) over @xmath85 with @xmath86 in the forward window , and @xmath87 in the backward window , defined to have widths @xmath88 and spaced symmetrically apart from @xmath80 with @xmath89 being the distance between the centers of the windows .",
    "thus the correlated part of the forward and backward multiplicities is @xmath90 where @xmath91 and @xmath92 , and @xmath93 it is clear in ) that hadronization is described entirely by the @xmath94 and @xmath95 functions .",
    "the hadronization of the two partons at @xmath49 and @xmath50 can allow a forward ( backward ) parton into a backward ( forward ) window when @xmath89 is small , since @xmath94 and @xmath95 are not narrow functions .    to illuminate the properties of hadronization , we show in fig .",
    "2 @xmath96 vs @xmath43 for fixed @xmath97 and @xmath98 , and for three values of @xmath23 .",
    "all curves peak at @xmath99 , which is the location of the window extending from 0.1 to 0.3 , as indicated by the shaded interval .",
    "the solid curve shows that even for the narrow cone width of @xmath100 partons significantly outside that window can contribute .",
    "it is even wider for the dashed curve .",
    "although large @xmath23 ( such as 0.5 ) is not relevant to @xmath0 collisions , it shows that the value of @xmath43 of the contributing parton can be greater than 1 , i.e. , outside the detector coverage of star .",
    "the covariance of @xmath101 that is measured is denoted by @xmath8 : @xmath102 whose @xmath89 dependence in the data @xcite is shown in two figures below . identifying @xmath103 with ) , we can fit the data by varying the relevant parameters in the problem . before discussing how that is done ,",
    "it is important to note first that the decrease of @xmath8 with increasing @xmath89 is strongly affected by the @xmath104 factor in the integrand in ) .",
    "changing that factor artificially to a weaker power diminishes the rate of decrease of @xmath105 with @xmath89 and will not fit the data .",
    "since there is nothing to adjust in that factor to reflect the nature of interaction , the range of correlation that one may naively infer from the data has no dynamical meaning .",
    "there are essentially only two parameters to adjust in the problem : @xmath106 .",
    "@xmath57 describes the strength of parton interaction at low , and @xmath38 specifies the spread of the parton rest frame relative to the @xmath0 cm system , thereby affecting the observed properties of correlation .",
    "@xmath23 is between 0.1 and 0.2 , and will not affect the final result sensitively . we adopt the following fitting strategy .",
    "first , we fix @xmath107 , and vary @xmath38 to see the corresponding dependence of @xmath108 on .",
    "that is shown in fig .",
    "3 . evidently , there is strong dependence on @xmath38 . for narrower @xmath82 at higher @xmath38 ,",
    "the hadronic fbc is stronger , as it should for fixed @xmath57 .",
    "however , the dependence on  appears to be universal .",
    "we plot the ratios @xmath109 in the inset and find that they are essentially independent of , except when @xmath110 or larger .",
    "we do not expect @xmath111 to be narrow , so @xmath38 should not be large . for smaller @xmath38 ,",
    "@xmath112 increases approximately linearly with @xmath38 .",
    "a fit of the whole range of @xmath38 studied results in @xmath113 at @xmath114 .",
    "it is clear then to fit the data on @xmath8 the value of @xmath57 must decrease with @xmath38 as @xmath115 .",
    "let us then define @xmath116 which we expect to be a rather stable variable to use to fit @xmath8 for a wide range of @xmath38 . still holding @xmath117 , we obtain the results shown collectively by the solid line in fig .  4 for @xmath118 .",
    "there is no dependence on @xmath38 .",
    "the value of @xmath119 is @xmath120 the reproduction of the data in their  dependence is very good , except for the highest point at = 1.6 .",
    "we emphasize that we only vary @xmath119 to fit the normalization ; the  dependence follows from ) without adjustment . for @xmath100",
    "we fix all other parameters already considered , and obtain the dashed line in fig .  4 for @xmath121 .",
    "for other values of @xmath38 there are some small variations because @xmath112 that is used is given in ) , which was calculated for @xmath117 .",
    "but the difference is miniscule ( @xmath122 ) .",
    "the dependence on @xmath23 is evidently not strong , so we shall hereafter adhere to the value @xmath117 .    to summarize our result",
    "so far , we see that @xmath57 and @xmath38 are strongly correlated in the fitting procedure .",
    "@xmath123 is the source of hadronic correlation that replaces the @xmath124 in ) .",
    "the smaller @xmath38 is , the larger must be @xmath57 to compensate for the spread of @xmath82 in order to account for the observed magnitude of fbc .",
    "we have combined the two into one parameter @xmath119 and succeeded in fitting the data .",
    "but the adjustment is only in the magnitude of the correlation .",
    "the important point is that the basic dependence of @xmath105 on  is due to the factor @xmath104 in ) that is not adjustable and is the origin of the universality seen in fig .  3 .",
    "let us , for definiteness , consider the case @xmath121 , for which @xmath125 , so @xmath126 .",
    "using this number in ) and integrate it over @xmath127 , we obtain 28 correlated pairs of partons .",
    "this is not a large number compared to the total number of pairs of partons @xmath128 , where @xmath129 is roughly twice the total average charged event multiplicity @xmath22 of hadrons , which is about 20 .",
    "thus only a small fraction ( @xmath130 ) of all parton pairs are correlated .",
    "returning now to ) that expresses the two - parton  assumed from the start , one may regard that as the @xmath131-wave contribution to the scattering process .",
    "it is of interest to ask whether the data on fbc can admit a @xmath132-wave contribution as well . to that end",

    "although the fit of the data on @xmath8 in fig .  5 is not significantly improved , we have demonstrated that the data can be understood as a combination of two components , one of which is nearly flat in .",
    "the reason for doing the above decomposition is to establish a connection with the picture formed in the data analyzed in ref .",

    "our notations @xmath146 and @xmath142 are chosen to make a symbolic correspondence to those soft and hard components .",

    "@xcite are determined by detailed analysis of the  behavior of the produced hadrons , the hard having @xmath6 only around 1.2 gev / c , but still higher than the soft component .",
    "our study here bypasses the issue about the transverse momenta of the partons and hadrons , which are not tractable at such low , but focuses on the angular variables that are more intimately related to pseudo - rapidity .",
    "we find that the properties found in refs .",
    "@xcite can be accommodated by a combination of @xmath131- and @xmath132-wave components to give the @xmath146 and @xmath142 components .",
    "since we have had no need to question the @xmath10 aspect of the partons in the present treatment , we have no basis to judge what is soft or hard .",
    "however , it does seem reasonable that the soft component consists entirely of the @xmath131-wave , while the hard component includes also the @xmath132-wave part of the scattering .",
    "we have considered hadronic fbc by relating it to the simplest form of partonic interaction that has back - to - back correlation . it is found that it gives a fairly good description of the dependence of fbc on window separation  without any adjustment of the range of correlation .",
    "the magnitude of the correlation function is fitted by varying the number of correlated pairs of partons , which turns out to be less than 2% of all possible pairs that hadronize .",
    "the so - called  range of correlation \" in @xmath70 is mainly a consequence of the transformation from the polar angles , and has no meaning at the parton level .    since low-  hadrons dominate any hadronic measure that does not restrict the  range of coverage , it is necessary to consider low-@xmath10 partons for which available theoretical tools are deficient . leaving open the questions about @xmath10 and",
    ", we have focused on the relationship between polar angles and pseudo - rapidities and found a meaningful way to separate different issues that include the mismatch between the partonic and hadronic cm systems in the initial state , and the hadronization of partons in the final state .",
    "uncertain properties of those two specific issues have been investigated , and various possibilities have been considered before arriving at the final result that is mainly insensitive to those properties .    since at @xmath147",
    "gev / c recombination may be more likely than fragmentation as the dominant mechanism of hadronization , we have considered the effect of non - vanishing width of the hadronization cone .",
    "we find that there is significant cross feeding of partons from one region to hadrons in neighboring regions .",
    "to identify the partonic window with the hadronic window is an assumption that becomes even more unreliable in nuclear collisions , where attempts have been made to infer the nature of the bulk medium from the observed charge fluctuation in restricted windows .",
    "we have attempted to make contact with the results of porter - trainor analysis that shows by autocorrelation the existence of very different  behaviors for the soft and hard components at low @xmath51 @xmath148 gev / c ) @xcite .",
    "we can identify the ( soft ) component having strong  dependence with our @xmath131-wave component and the weaker ( hard ) component having roughly no dependence on  with our part that includes the @xmath132-wave contribution .",
    "our major finding is that the strong  dependence does not imply short - range correlation .",
    "it is possible that the -independent component may be related to multiplicity fluctuation in some way by treating the  minijets \" in the hard component at the parton level .",
    "the parton - based approach adopted in this work is clearly different from the string model that emphasizes the role of the valence quarks in the formation of strings and the mechanism of string fragmentation for soft production of particles .",
    "our approach is closer to the original parton model , where low - momenta soft partons are a part of the initial state of the incident proton @xcite .    with the elucidation that we have achieved for the @xmath0 collision problem , it is natural to ask what light it sheds on the @xmath149 collision problem .",
    "to the extent that we have investigated the subject we have found that the nuclear problem is vastly more complicated , since there are many contributing factors that can influence fbc .",
    "what we have uncovered in the @xmath0 problem is likely to be overwhelmed by fluctuations related to the particle production processes outside the realm of partonic correlation in @xmath0 collisions .",
    "it is therefore mostly a separate problem only a part of which is connected with the topic of study here .",

    "<S> forward - backward correlation in @xmath0 collisions is studied in an approach that emphasizes the partonic scattering angles and circumvents the intractable problem related to the transverse momenta that are low . assuming the back - to - back scattering of partons to be the origin of hadronic correlation , the properties of forward - backward multiplicity covariance can be derived essentially independent of details of hadronization . </S>",
    "<S> the range of correlation in pseudo - rapidity emerges from the study without any dynamical input , thus dispelling the notion that correlation length has any fundamental significance . </S>",
    "<S> an attempt is made to relate the results to the two - component structure seen in autocorrelation .    </S>",
