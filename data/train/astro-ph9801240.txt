    "aquila x1(=v1333 aquilae ) is a soft x - ray transient source that shows type i x - ray bursts ( koyama et al . 1981 ; czerny , czerny & grindlay 1987 ) , thereby indicating that the compact object is a neutron star . from quiescent observations the companion star has been identified to be a v=19.2 k1@xmath5 star ( see shahbaz , casares & charles and references within ) .",
    "aql x1 is known to undergo regular x - ray and optical outbursts on a timescale of @xmath61 year ( kaluzienski et al .",
    "1977 ; priedhorsky & terrell 1984 ; charles et al . 1980 ) much more frequently than the other neutron star transient cen x4 ( mcclintock & remillard 1990 ) .",
    "attempts to find the orbital period have revealed many modulations .",
    "watson ( 1976 ) reported an unconfirmed 1.3 day x - ray periodicity during the 1975 outburst .",
    "chevalier & ilovaisky ( 1991 ) have obtained an 18.97 hr periodicity from optical photometry during its active state , which they interpret as being the orbital period .",
    "recently the rxte all sky monitor showed aql x1 to have undergone an x - ray outburst between late january and early march 1997 ( levine & thomas 1997 ) .",
    "ilovaisky & chevalier ( 1997 ) reported that aql x1 was optically in quiescence by 30 march 1997 . in this letter",
    "we report on our @xmath0-band photometry of aql x1 obtained in june 1997 , when the source was in quiescence .",
    "we are able to confirm the periodicity detected by chevalier & ilovaisky ( 1991 ) and determine the binary inclination .",
    "we monitored aql x1 on the nights of 1997 june 20 , 23 , 24 , 25 , and 26 ut , using the 1.3 m mcgraw - hill telescope at michigan - dartmouth - mit ( mdm ) observatory and a direct ccd camera equipped with a @xmath7 thinned tektronix chip which yielded 0.51 pixel@xmath1 at @xmath8 .",
    "the nights of june 21 and 22 were clear , but the source was too close to the bright moon to observe . to suppress scattered moonlight and to obtain maximum sensitivity to the cool secondary star",
    ", an interference filter approximating the kron - cousins @xmath0-band was used for all the exposures , which were generally 480 s long . except for a very few thin clouds on june 20 , conditions were entirely photometric .",
    "the seeing was variable but generally usable ( fwhm @xmath9 ) .",
    "occasional focus changes and tracking problems spoiled a few frames . in order to obtain maximum leverage in the time series analysis we observed aql x1 for as long as we could each night .    for flatfield division we used median - filtered exposures of the twilight sky taken the same nights as the data .",
    "the flatfield pictures agreed very well from night to night , except for occasional @xmath10 per cent changes in the shadows cast by dust particles on the ccd window .",
    "bias subtraction was accomplished using overscan regions of the picture . for all reductions we used iraf routines .",
    "we measured eight stars ( table 1 ) in each picture using the apphot package ; of a variety of software apertures , a @xmath11 radius gave the lowest scatter among the _ differential _ magnitudes , the averages of which are listed in table 1 .",
    "photometric standardization was not attempted .",
    "the coordinates in table 1 are derived from a fit of eight stars from the hst guide star catalog v1.2 in a single good - seeing frame , and are estimated accurate to @xmath12 from the scatter of the fit .",
    "the mean differential @xmath0 magnitudes were computed by averaging over all frames and rejecting points more than three standard deviations from the median . for the local standard ( @xmath13 north of aql x1 ) , only the standard deviation of the instrumental magnitudes is given .",

    "we expect the quiescent optical modulation in aql x1 to arise primarily from the ellipsoidal variations of the secondary star , as it does in other sxts .",
    "these variations arise since the observer sees differing aspects of the gravitationally distorted star as it orbits the compact object ( van paradijs & mcclintock 1995 ) . in theory",
    "the modulation should have two maxima and minima .",
    "the two minima may be unequal depending on the binary inclination , but the maxima should be equal",
    ". however , in practice , the light from the accretion disc ( especially in the optical ) contaminates the ellipsoidal variations of the secondary star , making detailed interpretations of the optical light curves difficult ( see shahbaz , naylor & charles 1993 ) .    therefore , we first analysed the optical light curve of aql x1 using the phase dispersion minimization algorithm ( stellingwerf 1975 ) .",
    "this technique is insensitive to the shape of the modulation , but does not remove the effects of the window function .",
    "the method groups the data in phase bins and seeks to minimize the dispersion within the bins .",
    "the deepest minimum of the statistic is the best estimate of the period .",
    "the pdm spectrum was computed in the frequency range 0.1 to 4.0 c  d@xmath1 at a resolution of 0.01c  d@xmath1 with 20 phase bins .",
    "the common method of computing a discrete fourier transform ( dft ) and halving the estimate of the period is equivalent to assuming that the maxima and/or minima are of equal depths .",
    "this may not be the case , as the observed ellipsoidal modulation may contain unequal maxima and/or minima depending on the binary inclination and the contamination by the accretion disc .",
    "a lomb - scargle periodogram ( lomb 1976 ; scargle 1982 ) of the data set was then computed with the same resolution and frequency range as was used for the pdm periodogram .",
    "figure 1 shows the pdm and lomb - scargle periodgrams , with three frequencies present at 0.524 c  d@xmath1 , 1.509 c  d@xmath1 and 2.487 c  d@xmath1 .",
    "the suggested orbital period of chevalier & ilovaisky ( 1991 ) is marked at 18.97@xmath15 hr .",
    "if this is the orbital period , then it should appear in the lomb - scargle periodogram as a peak at twice the frequency , _",
    "i.e. _ at 2.530 c  d@xmath1 . in",
    "both the pdm and lomb - scargle periodograms a periodicity at 2.487 c  d@xmath1 in present .",
    "chevalier & ilovaisky s period should also appear in the pdm periodogram , since the method is insensitive to the shape of the modulation in the light curve ; a periodicity at 1.242 c  d@xmath1 is present .",
    "we note that no periodicity at 1.242 c  d@xmath1 or 2.487 c  d@xmath1 is present in the light curves of the comparison stars .",
    "we therefore assume the peak in the lomb - scargle periodogram at 2.487 c  d@xmath1 with a power of 31 to be real .    in figure 1",
    "we also show the 99 per cent confidence level which allows us to demonstrate the significance on the peaks detected in the lomb - scargle periodogram .",
    "the level was calculated from a monte carlo simulation , which calculates the maximum power in 10  000 sets of gaussian noise with mean and variance equal to that of aql x1 .",
    "random peaks reaching a power of 7.8 are only found in 1 per cent of the artificial data sets , hence this defines our 99 per cent confidence level .",
    "thus we conclude that the power level of the 2.487 c  d@xmath1 peak is substantially greater than 99 per cent level significant . in order to estimate the uncertainty in the 2.487 c  d@xmath1 peak position we created an artificial data set . with a mean , variance , semi - amplitude , amplitude difference between the minima and baseline equal to that in aql x1 . the observed ellipsoidal modulation is well represented by a sinusoid of frequency @xmath16 which lags 90 degrees in phase , relative to sinusoid at frequency @xmath17 .",
    "the amplitude of the sinusoid at frequency @xmath17 determines the difference between the minima in the final light curve .",
    "since this difference is small ( 0.01 mags ) , the ellipsoidal light curve is very similar to a single sinusoid of frequency @xmath16 . using a monte carlo simulation we recorded the peak power in the lomb - scargle periodogram near the peak of interest , for the artificial data set .",
    "this was repeated 10  000 times to produce good statistics , giving a mean peak at 2.487 @xmath20.005c  d@xmath1 ( 1-@xmath18 uncertainty ) .",
    "since this peak corresponds to twice the orbital frequency , the orbital period is then 1.244@xmath20.003 c  d@xmath1 ( = 19.30@xmath20.05 h ) .",
    "chevalier & ilovaisky ( 1991 ) were taken over a 3 month baseline , when aql x1 was in its active state .",
    "the @xmath19-band modulation they observe is probably due to a combination of x - ray heating of the secondary star , and of the accretion disc .",
    "modulations of this kind are probably not coherent , due to the highly variable nature of the accretion disc , even more so in the @xmath19-band ( van paradijs & mcclintock 1995 ) .",
    "our observations of aql x1 were taken when the source was in quiescence , and where in the @xmath0-band the accretion disc contribution is negligible ( shahbaz , casares & charles 1997 ) .",
    "therefore , what we see in the @xmath0-band is the characteristic double humped modulation per orbital cycle , due to the ellipsoidal shape of the secondary star .",
    "we therefore take the orbital period to be 19.30@xmath20.05 h ( = 0.804@xmath20.002",
    "d ) .    from table 1",
    "it can be seen that the scatter in the aql x1 data is similar to stars of comparable brightness .",
    "this may suggest that the modulation we have detected is not real .",
    "however , it should be noted that we can still use the largest amplitude of an ellipsoidal modulation that could conceivably be hidden within the noise in the data , to constrain the inclination of the system .",
    "using an orbital period @xmath20=19.30 h ( = 0.804 d ) we folded the aql x1 and comparison star data .",
    "as there is no spectroscopic ephemeris defining phase 0.0 ( i.e. superior conjunction of the secondary star ) we used an arbitrary value for t@xmath21 .",
    "we then shifted the light in phase so that the deeper minima corresponded to phase 0.0 .",
    "[ note that the choice is arbitrary . in the fitting procedure ( see later ) , one of the free parameters is a phase shift . ]",
    "the data were then binned into 15 phase bins , and the standard error and mean were then calculated for each bin after discarding the data points which were more than 3-@xmath18 away from the mean of each bin .",
    "this process removed 4 and 12 discrepant data points from the aql x-1 and comparison star data respectively ; the total number of data points was 152 .",
    "figure 2 shows the resulting light curves for aql x1 and a comparison star .",
    "we fitted the orbital @xmath0-band light curve of aql x1 with an ellipsoidal model , similar to that used for the other objects in our programme ( see shahbaz , naylor & charles 1997 and references within ) .",
    "the model describes the light curve generated by a roche lobe filling star , where each element of area on the surface of the star is assumed to emit blackbody radiation .",
    "the temperature distribution over its surface is assumed to vary according to von zeipel s ( 1924 ) gravity darkening law and a linear limb darkening law is used . for",
    "a detailed description of the model see shahbaz , naylor & charles ( 1993 ) .",
    "the model parameters were the binary mass ratio ( @xmath22 = m@xmath23 where m@xmath24 and m@xmath25 are the mass of the compact object and secondary star respectively ) , the inclination ( @xmath26 ) and the effective temperature of the secondary star ( t@xmath27 ) . a bright spot , _",
    "i.e. _ the region where the accretion stream hits the accretion disc was also included .",
    "the free parameters of the model were a phase shift , the normalisation of the bright spot and the normalisation of the light curve .",
    "thus the fitting procedure is not dependent on the choice for t@xmath21 .",
    "we performed least - squares fits to the data using this model , grid searching @xmath22 in the range 110 and @xmath26 in the range 5@xmath350@xmath3 .",
    "a t@xmath28 of 4620 k , appropriate for a k1@xmath5 star was used .",
    "we used a gravity darkening exponent of 0.05 ; sarna ( 1989 ) finds the gravity darkening exponent for convective stars with m@xmath290.7 to be 0.05 .",
    "the limb darkening coefficient for the @xmath0-band ( 9000 ) and the varying temperature around the surface of the secondary star was interpolated from the tables given by al - naimiy ( 1978 ) .",
    "the best fit gives a of 1.45 at @xmath30 , @xmath31 , with a phase shift of 0.0033@xmath32(=0.027 d ) .",
    "this fit is plotted in figure 2 as the dashed line .",
    "the phase shift allows us to estimate t@xmath21 to be hjd 2450623.450@xmath20.016 .",
    "figure 3 shows the resulting ( @xmath33 ) diagram with the 68 and 90 per cent confidence regions marked , calculated according to lampton , margon & bowyer ( 1976 ) for three parameters ( the phase shift , bright spot normalisation and the light curve normalisation ) , after the error bars had been rescaled to give a fit with a of 1 .",
    "as one can see , the ellipsoidal variation is only weakly dependent on @xmath22 .",
    "the 68 and 90 per cent confidence regions for the binary inclination are 21@xmath330@xmath3 and 20@xmath331@xmath3 respectively .",
    "shahbaz , casares & charles ( 1997 ) determine the fraction of light arising from the accretion disc to be 6@xmath23 per cent at 6000 .",
    "with increasing wavelength the disc contamination decreases ( see mcclintock & remillard 1986 ; shahbaz , et al . 1996 and references within ) , therefore the @xmath0-band disc contamination should be lower . if we assume a 95 per cent upper limit of 9 per cent for the disc contamination , the effect of this on the binary inclination is to increase it by at most 1@xmath3 .    from figure 2",
    "it can be seen that there seems to be some systematic trend in the data of the comparison star . as noted earlier",
    "the scatter in the comparison star data is comparable to that in the aql x1 data ( see also table 1 ) .",
    "if we assume that the modulation we observe in the aql x1 data is not due to the ellipsoidal modulation of the secondary star , and what we have fitted is the maximum possible modulation that could be present , then our fits allow us to determine a 95 percent upper limit of 31@xmath3 to the binary inclination .",
    "the quiescent period ( 19.30 h ) we find is slightly different ( @xmath6 2 per cent ) from the outburst period ( 18.97 h ) obtained by chevalier & ilovaisky .",
    "outburst and quiescent period differences are observed in sxts ( see odonoghue & charles 1996 ) , but the outburst modulation ( caused by the precession of the accretion disc ; whitehurst 1988 ) is usually a few per cent _ longer _ than the orbital period . if we interpret chevalier & ilovaisky s outburst period as being due to the superhump phenomenon , then the superhump period is shorter than the orbital period by 2 per cent , _",
    "i.e. _ we have a `` negative '' superhump .",
    "this may seem unusual , but negative superhumps have previously been observed in cataclysmic variables , _",
    "e.g. _ in v503 cyg the superhump period is shorter than the orbital period by 3 per cent ( harvey , skillman , patterson & ringwald 1995 ) .",
    "we can compare aql x1 to the other long period neutron star sxt cen x4 .",
    "assuming that our inclination is correct , and that both systems have similar mass neutron stars , then one can estimate @xmath34 , the semi - amplitude of the radial velocity curve for aql x1 ( @xmath34 scales with @xmath36 ) . using @xmath34=146 @xmath4km@xmath4s@xmath1(mcclintock & remillard 1990 ) and @xmath37 for cen x4 and @xmath38 for aql x1 , we find @xmath39@xmath4km@xmath4s@xmath1(95 per cent upper limit ) for aql x1    we can also determine the upper limit to the rotational broadening of the secondary star ( @xmath35 ) assuming that the secondary star fills its roche lobe and its spin is tidally locked to the binary period . eliminating @xmath34 from the mass function and the equation which relates the rotational broadening to the radial velocity semi - amplitude and mass ratio ( wade & horne 1986 ) ,",
    "we obtain the expression    @xmath40    the secondary star must be less massive than a main sequence star of the same spectral type , 0.8 . then using equation ( 1 ) with @xmath20=19.3 hr and @xmath38 gives @xmath41@xmath4km@xmath4s@xmath1(95 per cent upper limit ) .",
    "this value for @xmath35 is consistent with the limits obtained by shahbaz , casares & charles ( 1997 ) .",
    "using @xmath0-band photometry of aql x1 taken during quiescence , we have detected a periodicity at 2.487 c  d@xmath1 , which we interpret as twice the orbital frequency .",
    "folding the data on the orbital period ( 19.30@xmath20.05 hr ) , we fit the ellipsoidal modulation of the secondary star .",
    "we determine 95 per cent upper limits to the binary inclination , radial velocity semi - amplitude and rotational broadening of the secondary star to be 31@xmath3 , 117@xmath4km@xmath4s@xmath1and 50@xmath4km@xmath4s@xmath1respectively .",
    "the data analysis was carried out on the oxford starlink node using the @xmath42 and starlink software ."
