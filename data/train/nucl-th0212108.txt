    "there are many phenomenological models for masses and/or transition properties of baryons . however ,",
    "if one tries to extend a model from the flavor su(2 ) to su(3 ) or to include excited state , the situation of fitting the experimental data becomes more and more complicated .",
    "even if the spectrum can be reproduced by a phenomenological model , it is not easy to extract underlying physics or intuitive picture from them since some of the important effects may be hidden behind the model parameters .",
    "this is due to the seemingly complicated structure of the experimental data .",
    "it seems important therefore to have a fresh look at the existing data .",
    "historically , it is known that the gell - mann - okubo ( go ) mass formula works well to describe the pattern of the flavor octet and decuplet baryons in the ground states .",
    "we have extended this go mass formula to all observed flavor su(3 ) baryons and found that there is a flavor independent systematics in spectra  @xcite , more precisely in the excitation energy .",
    "remarkably , we have found that these patterns of mass spectra have a quite similar behavior to the _ rotational band _ in the deformed nuclei , which seem to imply spatial deformation of excited states of baryons .",
    "we have then investigated these spectra in terms of an effective non - relativistic quark model with a deformed harmonic oscillator potential , which we call the deformed oscillator quark ( doq ) model , and have shown that almost all data can be reproduced with only one parameter by the doq model .    in the deformed nuclei ,",
    "typical transitions are observed among rotational bands , which are classified as _ inter_-band or _",
    "intra_-band transitions .",
    "we expect that we can also observe similar transitions in the excited baryons if the pattern of their spectra is described by rotational bands . in this brief report ,",
    "we study intra - band transitions which correspond to the transitions among excited baryons with the same parity through an emission of a pion in the framework of the doq model .",
    "let us start with the hamiltonian of the doq model : @xmath1 where @xmath2 and @xmath3 are the momentum and position of the @xmath4-th quark .",
    "the constituent quark mass @xmath5 is taken to be 300 mev , which is insensitive to the following calculations . in order to take into account the deformation of excited states , the oscillator parameters @xmath6 can take different values , which are determined by energy minimization @xmath7 with volume conservation condition @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the eigenenergy of @xmath10 .",
    "the only one parameter to be fitted in the doq model is @xmath11 , which determines the energy scale of the system .",
    "we choose @xmath12 644 mev to reproduce the excitation energy of the first @xmath13 excited states .",
    "the system is characterized by the total principle quantum number @xmath14 , where @xmath15 s are oscillator quanta along each axis . here",
    "we take @xmath16 , since this combination gives the lowest energy for given @xmath17 .",
    "resulting system is spherical for @xmath18 ( ground state ) and prolately deformed : 1:2 for @xmath19 ( excited states with negative parity ) 1:3 for @xmath20 ( those with positive parity ) .",
    "inspired by such a large deformation of the system , we adopt semi - classical picture to obtain the orbital wave function with a definite angular momentum @xmath21 and its @xmath22-component @xmath23 ; we introduce collective motion of strongly deformed intrinsic state by wigner @xmath24 function .",
    "together with the appropriately symmetrized spin and isospin wave function @xmath25 and @xmath26 , the doq wave function with total spin @xmath27 and its @xmath28-component @xmath29 is written as @xmath30 where @xmath31_{jm}$ ] . here",
    "the collective coordinate and internal body fixed coordinate are denoted as @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "for @xmath34 , we take the standard non - relativistic @xmath35 interaction , @xmath36 where @xmath37 and @xmath38 are the momentum and energy of an emitted pion , respectively . depending on the charge of an emitted pion , an appropriate component of the pauli matrix for isospin @xmath39 acts on the isospin wave function of the @xmath40 state .    here",
    "we adopt a semi - classical cranking method to calculate the transition amplitudes ; @xmath41 \\ ,    \\varphi^{*n}_{\\mathrm{int}}(\\vec{r}_{\\mathrm{int } } )    r^{\\dagger}(\\vec{\\theta } )   h_{\\pi qq}(\\vec{r } ) r(\\vec{\\theta } )     \\psi^{n}_{\\mathrm{int}}(\\vec{r}_{\\mathrm{int}}),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath42 is a rotation operator which relates the original coordinate @xmath43 to the internal body - fixed coordinate @xmath33 .",

    "\\label{eq : fmp1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] from this expression , an interesting relation among transitions is obtained ; apart from the effect of momentum transfer @xmath50 , the ratio of the decay widths is determined only by geometrical factors in eq .   as @xmath51 this relation corresponds to the `` alaga rule '' in nuclear physics  @xcite .",
    "numerical results of the decay width for other transitions are listed in table[tbl : width - result ] .",
    "we have found several interesting features among the intra - band transitions : 1 ) the decay widths of @xmath52 to @xmath53 are very small due to the small momentum transfer and hence a small phase space ; we can show @xmath54 has large @xmath55 dependence , roughly @xmath56 , with the long wave length approximation ( @xmath57 ) .",
    "2 ) the decay widths of @xmath58 and of @xmath59 have a rather large value since the pion with @xmath60 can contribute them ( see , table  [ tbl : negative - pi ] ) . due to the difference of the geometrical factor in the transition form factor @xmath61",
    "the contribution of the @xmath62 transition is much bigger than that of @xmath63 transition .",
    "3 ) the decay widths of @xmath64 and of @xmath65 are small again due to the geometrical factor in the transition form factor .",
    "we would like to mention that such a interpretation of the result is possible by virtue of the semi - classical cranking formula .",
    "experimentally , such intra - band transitions may be observed in @xmath66 processes .",
    "however , no clear evidence has been found in existing data at the moment . as a future work",
    ", we would like to study other transition properties such as inter - band transitions with a pion , which can be comparable with experimental data ."
