    "understanding the reionization of the universe , when the first luminous sources were formed , is one of the lastest frontiers of observational cosmology .",
    "constraints have been obtained using diagnostics such as quasar studies of the gunn - peterson absorption trough , the luminosity evolution of ly@xmath4 galaxies , and the polarization isotropy of the cosmic microwave background .",
    "taken together , these data portray a complicated picture in which reionization has taken place over a wide range of redshifts ( 6@xmath5 ) rather than at one specific epoch",
    ". the dominant source of reionization appears to be due to ultraviolet emission from young , massive stars ( see review by @xcite ) .    as the most luminous explosions in the universe , gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) are potential signposts of these early massive stars .",
    "the radio , infrared and x - ray afterglow emission from grbs are in principle observable out to z@xmath6 @xcite .",
    "it is estimated that 10% of grbs detected by the _",
    "swift _ satellite are at @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "the most distant grb to date is  at @xmath0 .",
    "it was detected by the _",
    "burst alert telescope and localized to an accuracy of a few arcseconds by the _ swift _ x - ray telescope @xcite . follow - up optical and near - infrared observations ( nir ) were begun shortly thereafter",
    ". details on the discovery and properties of the x - ray and nir afterglow of this burst can be found in several papers @xcite .",
    "an optical / nir spectrum taken by the _ subaru _",
    "telescope 3.4 days after the burst showed multiple heavy metal absorption lines and a gunn - peterson trough with a damping wing redward of the ly@xmath4 cutoff which was used to derive the neutral fraction @xmath8 @xcite . with a _",
    "swift _ grb detection rate of 100 yr@xmath9 , grbs could one day replace quasars as the preferred probe of the high redshift universe .    in this paper",
    "we report on the detection of the radio afterglow from  (  [ sec : obs ] ) , which makes it possible to derive physical properties of the explosion and the circumburst medium (  [ sec : afterglow ] ) .",
    "our results are compared with predictions for the properties of the explosion and how the progenitors of high redshift grbs are expected to have shaped their surrounding environments (  [ sec : disc ] ) .",
    "radio observations were undertaken with the very large array ( vla ) at a frequency of 8.46 ghz ( see table  [ tab : vla ] ) . to maximize sensitivity ,",
    "the full vla continuum bandwidth ( 100 mhz ) was recorded in two 50 mhz bands .",
    "data reduction was carried out following standard practice in the _ aips _ software package .",
    "some additional phase and amplitude self - calibration was necessary to remove the contaminating effects of a bright ( 10 mjy ) radio source four arcminutes northeast from the grb .",
    "radio emission from  was not detected during the first week , ruling out a bright short - lived component similar to grb990123 @xcite . by averaging the data from this period , we obtain a peak flux at the position of the nir afterglow of 33@xmath1014 ujy .",
    "a clear detection was made during three epochs 34 - 37 days after the burst ( see table  [ tab : vla ] ) .",
    "averaging the data taken in october we obtain a mean flux density of 76@xmath1014 ujy .",
    "the spectral radio luminosity , expressed as @xmath11 = 2.5@xmath12 erg s@xmath9 hz@xmath9 ( where @xmath13 and @xmath14 and @xmath15 has been assumed , corresponding to an optically thin , flat post - jet break light curve ) , is normal for grbs @xcite , and is two orders of magnitude below the highest redshift radio - loud quasars @xcite .",
    "we show these detections in fig .",
    "[ fig : data ] together with a complete sample of 8.5 ghz flux density measurements for grbs with known redshifts .",
    "neither the time - to - peak nor the flux density of  is unusual compared to the known sample of grbs at lower redshifts . in the source rest frame the flux density for the majority of afterglows is reached before 5 days postburst . more interestingly",
    ", the average centimeter flux density in fig .  [ fig : data ] shows only a weak dependence on redshift .",
    "this effect was predicted by @xcite and is shown here for the first time .",
    "it is reminiscent of the `` negative k - correction '' for submillimeter observations of ultraluminous infrared galaxies @xcite .",
    "the afterglow flux density remains high because of the dual effects of spectral and temporal redshift , offsetting the dimming due to the increase in distance @xcite .",
    "we illustrate in fig .",
    "[ fig : data ] how slowly the centimeter flux density decreases for a canonical grb afterglow beyond @xmath16 due to this effect ( long dashed lines ) , compared to one whose luminosity is assumed constant ( short dashed lines ) .",
    "observational bias does not explain the flattening in fig .",
    "[ fig : data ] because the detection rate of radio afterglows is largely insensitive to redshift . of the 60 grbs with known redshift that have been observed in the radio , there are 42 with detected afterglows .",
    "their detection rate above and below @xmath17 is identical .",
    "we now proceed to combine these radio data (  [ sec : obs ] ) with the extensive x - ray and optical / nir data for  in order to constrain the physical parameters of the outflow and the circumburst medium .",
    "we interpret these multi - wavelength data within the framework of the relativistic blastwave model ( see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "the particular fitting approach that we take is described in more detail in @xcite .    to limit the number of free parameters in the fit",
    ", we chose to model only the evolution of the forward shock after energy injection has ceased .",
    "the early x - ray light curve shows complex flaring activity , common in _ swift _ bursts but lasting an unusually long time ( @xmath18 days ) , corresponding to a central engine lifetime of more than 2 hrs in the source rest frame @xcite .",
    "on - going energy injection is also suspected based on the flares and the flattening of the optical / nir lightcurves on similar timescales @xcite .",
    "if these early data are excluded the nir data show a smooth power - law evolution with a clear break at @xmath19 days and decay indices before and after the break of @xmath20 and @xmath21 @xcite . if interpreted as a jet break , the sharpness of the transition makes it unlikely that this burst occurred in a wind - blown environment @xcite and motivates our modeling choice of a constant density circumburst medium .",
    "our best - fit forward shock model is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : model ] .",
    "we fit for the isotropic kinetic energy of the shock @xmath22 , the opening angle of the jet @xmath23 , the density of the circumburst medium @xmath2 , the electron energy index @xmath24 , and the fraction of the shock energy density in relativistic electrons @xmath25 and magnetic fields @xmath26 .",
    "our model makes the unusual prediction that the synchrotron cooling frequency lies below _ both _ the x - ray and optical bands before the first j - band detection of the afterglow at @xmath27=3.07 hrs @xcite .",
    "this implies a steep spectral slope of @xmath28 @xcite .",
    "this is likely the case at @xmath29=3 days where we derive an nir / x - ray slope of @xmath30 .",
    "this value also agrees with @xcite who derive a best fit optical / nir spectral index of @xmath31 over the interval from 0.4 to 7 days postburst .",
    "a steep spectral slope of @xmath32 is seen even when the x - ray light curve is highly time variable between 0.05@xmath33 days .",
    "thus we find that the available data support a small value for the cooling frequency .",
    "our best - fit model favors a circumburst density @xmath2=680 @xmath3 . to test the robustness of this result we ran several model fits , fixing @xmath2 over a range of values between 0.7 @xmath3 and 7@xmath34 @xmath3 .",
    "as expected , the x - ray and nir data are relatively insensitive to @xmath2 , so the radio afterglow provides the tightest constraints .",
    "large densities @xmath35 @xmath3 are ruled out since the solutions are bounded by the condition that the magnetic and electron densities do not exceed equipartition . low densities @xmath36 @xmath3 are also not favored since they predict bright early radio emission in the first week well in excess of that which is observed (  [ sec : obs ] ) . over the allowable density range ,",
    "@xmath22 varies from 40 to 530 , and therefore it is no better constrained by the afterglow data than the _ isotropic _ radiated energy @xmath37 is by the prompt emission @xcite .",
    "another possibility is that radio afterglow flux density measurements are biased by the turbulent ionized interstellar medium of our galaxy which induces non - gaussian intensity fluctuations for compact radio sources .",
    "indeed , it has been shown by @xcite that repeated short observations similar to those in table  [ tab : vla ] increase the odds of detecting a weak radio signal close to the detection threshold .",
    "we replaced the detections with upper limits and re - ran the fit .",
    "high density solutions are still preferred ( @xmath38 @xmath3 ) because both the x - ray and optical afterglows of  were bright @xcite .",
    "thus , in order to suppress the radio emission at 8.5 ghz ( or 62 ghz in the rest frame ) , a large value of the synchrotron self - absorption is required and hence a large circumburst density .",
    "with the detection of the radio afterglow from  we have a complete multi - wavelength dataset for this high redshift burst . by comparing the physical properties of the burst and its circumburst environment to those grbs found at lower redshifts , we hope to gain some insight into the birth and death of the earliest generations of stars in the universe .",
    "there is good support for interpretating  as an energetic event . from our afterglow modeling (  [ sec : afterglow ] ) of the isotropic kinetic energy of the shock @xmath39 ( normalized in units of 10@xmath1 erg ) .",
    "estimates obtained for the _ isotropic _ radiated energy @xcite with @xmath40 .",
    "the quoted range in @xmath37 relects the uncertainty in the location of the peak of the gamma - ray spectrum .",
    "these constraints can be refined owing to our fitting the jet opening angle @xmath23=0.14 rad ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the geometrically corrected energies are @xmath41=0.9 , and @xmath42 .",
    "both the radiated and kinetic energy of this event lie at or beyond the values derived for a large sample of lower redshift afterglows @xcite .",
    "an independent check on this result uses the x - ray light curve to compute the geometrically - corrected x - ray luminosity at some fiducial time ( usually taken at @xmath27=10 hrs ) .",
    "we derive l@xmath43=2.6@xmath44 erg s@xmath9 , again larger than any previous grb afterglow @xcite .",
    "perhaps the most interesting aspect of these data is that they allow us to make an _ in situ _ measurement of the density structure for a massive star in the early universe . from our afterglow",
    "modeling we conclude that  exploded into a constant density medium with @xmath2=680 @xmath3  two orders of magnitude above the nominal value for lower redshift grbs @xcite .",
    "line - of - sight measures @xcite also indicate that a substantial column of gas exists towards .",
    "the fine - structure silicon lines siii@xmath45 are the most important since their column density ratios yield estimates of the electron density @xmath46 @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "the close agreement of this line - of - sight estimate with our _ in situ _ value argues for a common physical origin for the gas in the immediate vicinity of the grb .",
    "there are testable predictions for star formation and collapse in the early universe ( @xcite and reference therein ) .",
    "the first stars are expected to be very massive and could produce energetic grb explosions like .",
    "likewise , the high density we derived for   may be part of the general increase expected for the ambient density of the interstellar medium @xcite , but more likely just indicates that this grb exploded in a dense molecular cloud .",
    "a lower density would be expected if the progenitor of  was a low metalicity wolf - rayet star @xcite .",
    "however , it remains a problem , at both low and high redshifts , why the radial density signature from the collapsar wind is rarely detected @xcite .",
    "a larger sample is needed before drawing too much from these predictions .",
    "deep radio observations will continue to play a role since can be seen out to the highest redshifts and are sensitive probes of the total calorimetry of the explosion and the density structure of the circumburst medium .",
    "looking further ahead to the next generation of centimeter ( evla ) and millimeter radio instuments ( alma ) , events like  will be bright enough to sample primordial magnetic fields @xcite , and probe the cold atomic and molecular gas from the time of the first light @xcite .",
