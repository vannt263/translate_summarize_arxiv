    "there has been considerable recent interest in graphene ( single layer graphite ) sparked by its discovery and subsequent experimental study @xcite .",
    "the remarkable properties of graphene have been suspected for many years @xcite . in brief , for a carbon monolayer having one mobile electron per atom , a simple tight - binding model shows that the spectrum of low - energy excitations exhibits a linear dispersion relation centred on zeros located at the six corners of the first brillouin zone ( see e.g. @xcite ) . using a linear transformation among the fields at two independent zeros it is possible to recast the hamiltonian in dirac form with @xmath0 flavors of four - component spinor @xmath1 - the counting of the massless degrees of freedom coming from two carbon atoms per unit cell times two zeros per zone times two physical spin components per electron .",
    "electron propagation in the graphene layer is thus relativistic , albeit at a fermi velocity @xmath2 .",
    "the implications for the high mobility of the resulting charge carriers is the source of the current excitement .",
    "the electronic properties of graphene are discussed in detail in a recent review paper @xcite .",
    "although the semimetallic properties of graphene on a substrate are well - known , it remains unclear whether graphene in vacuum undergoes a phase transition from the semimetal phase to an insulating phase .",
    "a suffuciently strong coulomb interaction may lead to a condensation of electron and hole pairs thus turning the conducting phase into a gapped insulator at a critical value of fermion flavors @xmath3 .",
    "recent estimates of @xmath3 have been obtained by : self - consistent solutions of schwinger - dyson equations yielding @xmath4 @xcite ; renormalization group treatment of radiatively induced four - fermion interactions yielding @xmath5 @xcite ; and lattice simulations yielding @xmath6 @xcite .",

    "the results of lattice simulations of a thirring - like model pertinent to graphene presented in this paper are consistent with this observation .",
    "while the above considerations apply quite generally , a realistic model of graphene must incorporate interactions between charge carriers .",
    "one such model , due to son @xcite , has @xmath7 massless fermion flavors propagating in the plane , but interacting via an instantaneous @xmath8 coulomb interaction .",
