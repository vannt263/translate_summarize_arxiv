    "the problem of how to compute quantum corrections to the mass of @xmath1 dimensional solitons was first addressed by dashen , hasslacher and neveu @xcite in 1974 .",
    "this work was followed by a decade of activities related to quantum properties of solitons , see @xcite .",
    "the subject was re - opened in 1997 in the context of supersymmetric solitons @xcite ( see also reviews @xcite ) .",
    "about the same time many methods of calculations appeared , the ones based on the heat kernel expansion are most important for us @xcite .    previous studies of solitons in noncommutative ( nc ) theories ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) avoided the problem of quantum corrections to their mass , except for the work @xcite , where quantum correction to an nc sine - gordon soliton were calculated in a couple of leading orders of the @xmath2-expansion .",
    "this paper also reported certain difficulties in calculating the mass shift , which are probably not specific to the model considered , but rather common to all time - space nc theories .",
    "the present paper is devoted to calculation of quantum corrections to the mass of nc kink in ( 1 + 1 ) dimensions .",
    "we do not use the @xmath2-expansion . on the contrary",
    ", we concentrate on finite and large values of the noncommutativity parameter . as in @xcite",
    "we define the mass shift ( the vacuum energy @xmath3 ) as , roughly speaking , half the sum of eigenfrequencies of fluctuations about the soliton .",
    "such a definitions is hard to justify rigorously since in time - space nc theories where there is no canonical definition of energy .",
    "some arguments in favor of treating eigenfrequencies as one particle energies can be found in @xcite .",
    "anyway , @xmath3 is useful for the discussion of quantum properties of solitons and renormalization .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "the next section contain some preliminary material on the nc kink and fluctuations about it mostly taken from @xcite . in sec .",
    "[ sec - qe ] we study spectral density of the fluctuation and renormalization of the vacuum energy ( which is done by adding a mass counterterm to the classical action ) .",
    "section [ sec - cal ] is devoted to numerical calculations of the vacuum energy for several values of the nc parameter @xmath4 ( in some natural units ) .",
    "the bound state frequencies are evaluated with the help of the wkb method , while the contribution of the continuous spectrum is calculated by using an approximating square well potential .",
    "we find that quantum corrections to the vacuum energy grow linearly with @xmath2 .",

    "we repeat some steps from that paper .",
    "let us split @xmath16 with @xmath17 being the kink solution ( [ kink ] ) and @xmath18 describing quantum fluctuations .",
    "the linearized equation of motion reads @xmath19 since the kink ( [ kink ] ) is static , we can look for the solutions of ( [ lin1 ] ) in the form @xmath20 . by substituting this ansatz in ( [ lin1 ] ) and using the relations ( [ shift ] ) we obtain the following equation for @xmath21 @xmath22 where @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "it is convenient to choose the mass units such that @xmath25 then eq .  ( [ lin2 ] ) yields @xmath26 where @xmath27 and the constant part @xmath28 is selected in such a way that @xmath29 exponentially fast for @xmath30 and a fixed @xmath31 .",
    "the vacuum energy can be formally defined as a sum of eigenfrequencies of quantum fluctuations @xmath32 . in nc theories with time - space noncommutativity ( in particular , in all nc theories in @xmath1 dimensions ) it is hard to define a canonical hamiltonian ( due to the presence of an infinite number of time derivatives ) and thus to justify this formula for @xmath3 rigorously . here",
    "we follow @xcite and accept this definition of the vacuum energy ( see the comments made in sec .",
    "[ sec - intro ] above ) . more precisely , after taking @xmath33 we split the vacuum energy as @xmath34 where @xmath35 is a finite sum over the bound state frequencies .",
    "the contribution of the continuous spectrum has to be regularized . in the zeta function regularization",
    "it reads @xmath36 where a regularization parameter @xmath37 has been introduced which should be put zero at the end of the calculations .",
    "the function @xmath38 is the spectral density in the continuous spectrum . by using the well known relation between the spectral density and the phase shift we can write @xmath39 where @xmath40 .",
    "( for the sake of completeness we rederive this formula for noncommutative case in appendix [ app - ve ] ) .",
    "equivalently , @xmath41 this quantity is divergent in the limit @xmath42 .",
    "to get rid of the divergences one has to know the the asymptotic behavior of the spectral density for large frequencies .      since the potential in ( [ lin3 ] ) depends on the frequency @xmath31 we are dealing with a _ non - linear spectral problem_. to analyze the spectral density we use a method developed initially in @xcite and then adapted to nc theories in @xcite .",
    "let us consider an auxiliary eigenvalue problem @xmath43 where @xmath44 the functions @xmath45 solve our initial eigenvalue problem ( [ lin3 ] ) , but the spectral densities are different .",
    "let us denote the density of the auxiliary problem by @xmath46 .",
    "note , that according to appendix [ app - ve ] we are actually working with the densities from which ( an infinite ) contribution from free massive fields in an infinite space has been subtracted . by using this density",

    "we have @xmath73 we are going to use this expansion to evaluate the large @xmath31 behavior of @xmath63 , and , after setting @xmath74 - the large @xmath31 behavior of the physical density @xmath38 .",
    "as noted in @xcite , the problem is that besides from powers of @xmath31 the high frequency asymptotics of the spectral density contain oscillating terms which are not defined by the heat trace asymptotics . strictly speaking",
    ", the heat kernel expansion defines the asymptotic behavior of the so - called riesz means of the spectral density rather than that of the spectral density itself .",
    "this is not precisely what we need , but we learn an important lesson : the power - law asymptotics _ are _ defined by the heat kernel expansion .",
    "oscillating terms are less important anyway since corresponding contributions to the vacuum energy are better convergent than that from pure powers .",
    "let us consider the zeta function corresponding to @xmath63 @xmath75 one should be careful with possible contribution from @xmath76 .",
    "one should either treat such state separately , or add a small positive part to the mass .",

    "there is a well know relation between residues of the zeta function and the heat kernel coefficients @xmath77 on the other hand , if the spectral density has a contribution behaving like @xmath78 at large @xmath31 , the zeta function has a pole term @xmath79 where @xmath80 is a large number , and the coefficient of @xmath81 appeared because we have to take into account degeneracy of the continuous spectrum .",

    "this formula does not contain possible oscillating term which can not be obtained by these methods .",
    "one should not be afraid of negative spectral densities .",
    "we have subtracted the spectral density of a free massive field .",
    "what remains can have both signs .",
    "let us now consider renormalization of the vacuum energy .",
    "since only the contribution from continuous spectrum is divergent , we treat this term only @xmath87 where we introduced a parameter @xmath88 with the dimension of mass in order to keep proper dimension of the vacuum energy @xmath89 independently of the regularization parameter @xmath37 .",
    "next we choose some frequency @xmath80 and split the integral into two parts .",
    "the part from @xmath90 to @xmath80 we leave as it is . in the part from @xmath80 to infinity we add and subtract the asymptotics @xmath91 of the spectral density . @xmath92",
    "the choice of @xmath80 is simply a matter of convenience .",
    "all ultraviolet divergences are contained in the last term .",
    "as @xmath93 we take the first term in ( [ asrho ] ) , @xmath94 where we took into account ( [ a210 ] ) .",
    "we assumed that oscillating terms in the spectral densities ( which are beyond our control ) do not contribute to the divergences .",
    "this assumption can not be universally true .",
    "however , in the case we consider in this paper the subtraction of ( [ rhoas ] ) indeed gives a convergent integral ( see below ) .",

    "therefore , the no - tadpole condition is not suitable for us . in the case of commutative kink",
    ", there is the large mass subtraction scheme @xcite which is equivalent to the no - tadpole condition @xcite .",
    "although this scheme can be applied even in non - renormalizable theories , it is not clear how to implement it in the noncommutative case .",
    "this situation is not hopeless , but it is more natural to address it together with studying the commutative limit @xmath104 . our numerical scheme ( see below ) does not work well in this limit .",

    "it is well - known that wkb approach works well for the low laying bound states , i.e. the smaller @xmath128 , the better accuracy of the wkb approximation . at the same time ,",
    "the larger @xmath128 , the better accuracy of the square well approximation . as a result",
    ", one can see in the table i , with an example of @xmath129 case , that highly excited bound state frequencies obtained from the square well approximation agree very well with their wkb values in the regime of large @xmath128 .",

    "let us also remind that the zero mode @xmath130 is the same as in the commutative case .",
    "( this is the translation zero mode ) .",
    "to summarize , for all bound state frequencies @xmath131 we use the wkb approximation , which is known to be accurate for lower eigenstates , and which practically coincides with the frequencies obtained from the square well approximation near the barrier .    on the contrary to the discrete spectrum , when considering integrals over continuous part of the spectrum ( second and third terms in ( [ efin ] ) ) , we start from @xmath132 , @xmath133 and can use the square well approximation . in other words",

    "the the potential does not look like square well , but rather like a modified pschl - teller potential .",
    "the wkb method is certainly justified for that case as well for calculation of bound states , yet is computationally difficult for the continuous spectrum .",
    "that is why we did not consider the limit of small @xmath2 .",
    "we used the following expression for the phase shift @xmath135 ( cf .",
    "appendix [ app - ve ] ) .",
    "the dominant asymptotic behavior of @xmath136 at large @xmath31 is given by ( [ rhoas ] ) above .    since we put @xmath134 the second term in ( [ efin ] ) vanishes .",
    "the calculation of the third term in ( [ efin ] ) was done by numerical integration with a @xmath137 function given by a square well approximation .",
    "the numerical integration was performed by _ mathematica _ and the values for different @xmath2 are given in fig . 1 .",
    "one can see there that the roughly linear dependence on @xmath2 takes place .",
    "the approximating square well potential differs from the exact potential @xmath121 only slightly near the points @xmath138 , and the form of this difference practically does not depend on @xmath2 . therefore , especially since we deal with a massive field , we may hope that the total error will remain small and bounded independently of @xmath2 , so that our conclusion about the linear growth of the integral over the continuous spectrum will remain true even if a better approximation is used .",
    "besides , as we shall see , the contribution of the continuous spectrum is about @xmath139 of the contribution of the bound states , so that any error in the continuous spectrum is less important . adding the values for the integration over continuous spectrum ( fig .",
    "1 ) to the sum over the bound state frequencies ( see table i , except for the case @xmath140 which is not presented explicitly in order not too overload the table ) , we get @xmath141 let us note that as the contribution to the energy from the integral over continuous spectrum is linear with @xmath2 ( see fig . 1 ) and the contribution to the bound state is linear as well , the final values for @xmath3 as a function of @xmath2 is linear in @xmath2 ( see fig .",

    "the comparison shows that the wkb approximation results differ from the sw ( square well ) approximation only by fractions of one percent . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "in this work we found that the divergences in the zeta - regularized one - loop vacuum energy of nc kink ( defined as a half - sum over egenfrequencies ) can be removed by the mass renormalization .",
    "this renormalization is , however , different from the one required in the topologically trivial sector .",
    "although the effective potential which defines the spectrum of excitations above the kink depends on frequencies , for intermediate and large values of the nc parameter @xmath2 the finite part can be calculated by a combination of the wkb method and an approximation by a square well potential . for large noncommutativity the one - loop vacuum energy grows linearly with @xmath2 , so that sooner or later it should become larger than the classical value thus signalling break - down of the perturbative expansion .    our results may be improved and extended in a number of ways .",
