    "in the n - body problem there is a family of solutions that conserve the shape in the evolution in time . among these motions ,",
    "those with zero angular momentum are called homothetic motions .",
    "they have the form @xmath1 where @xmath2 is a solution of a one center problem in the line @xmath3 , and @xmath4 a central configuration .",
    "this kind of configurations can be defined in many equivalent ways , say for instance as the critical points of the restrictions of the potential function @xmath5 to the level sets of the moment of inertia @xmath6 it turns out that these configurations have _ center of mass at the origin_. for some authors there is an extended notion of central configuration with respect to its center of mass .",
    "these are only translation of the first ones",
    ".    in this paper we will be interested in the collinear n - body problem , therefore a configuration @xmath7 will represent the vector of positions of the bodies , which are supposed to be point particles , each with mass @xmath8 , and contained in a straight line . as usual , @xmath9 will denote the distance between the bodies @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "when the bodies evolve in a space of dimension @xmath12 not much is know about the geometry of central configurations .",
    "not even know in general if there exist only a finite number ",
    "modulo similitude  of central configurations .",
    "one of the most recent works on this topic , due to albouy and kaloshin @xcite , shows the generic finiteness in the case of five bodies in the plane , that is , excluding the situation in which the vector of masses @xmath13 belongs to a given subvariety of @xmath14 .",
    "in contrast , for dimension @xmath15 , the problem is solved .",
    "the first step was given by euler who solved the case of three bodies see @xcite .",
    "moulton solved the problem for arbitrary number of masses .",
    "more precisely , he proved in @xcite that if we identify configurations which are homothetic by a positive factor , then there are exactly @xmath16 equivalence classes of critical points , each one corresponding to an order @xmath17 of the bodies in the line . as we will explain , they are all nondegenerate local minima .",
    "see also the appendix on moulton s theorem in the paper by smale @xcite .",
    "the mass vector @xmath18 is a parameter which determines the potential function @xmath19 and the moment of inertia @xmath20 .",
    "thus the mass vector also determines the central configurations . before stating our result ,",
    "let us recall some well known equivalent definitions of central configuration .",
    "once the mass vector is fixed , we say that a configuration @xmath21 without collisions ( that is , such that @xmath22 ) is a _ central configuration _ if and only if one of the following equivalent conditions is satisfied :    * @xmath4 is a critical point of @xmath23 , the restriction of @xmath19 to the level set of @xmath20 which contains @xmath4 .",
    "* @xmath4 is a critical point of the homogeneous function ( of zero degree ) @xmath24 * @xmath4 is a critical point of the function @xmath25 for some value of @xmath26 .",
    "note that if @xmath4 is a central configuration then @xmath27 is also a central configuration for every @xmath28 .",
    "moreover , the notion of _ nondegenerate _ central configuration refers to the first condition .",
    "more precisely , if @xmath29 then @xmath4 is a nondegenerate central configuration when @xmath4 is a nondegenerate critical point of the restriction of @xmath19 to the ellipsoid @xmath30 .",
    "the main result of the present note is the following theorem and his corollary .",
    "[ minmoulton ] there is an open and dense set of mass vectors @xmath31 such that , if @xmath32 then the function @xmath33 has @xmath0 critical values .",
    "there is an open and dense set of mass vectors for which the collinear @xmath34-body problem has only one global minimal configuration .",
    "of course , the uniqueness in the statement of the corollary refers to the similarity classes of central configurations , that is to say , once we identify configurations which are homothetic by a non zero factor .",
    "thus there are @xmath0 different central configurations in this sense , and generically only one of them is minimal .",
    "in contrast , the number of critical values can be less than @xmath0 for some values of the mass vector .",
    "it is clear that if two masses are equal , and @xmath35 , then commutation of the corresponding bodies gives an extra symmetry of the problem which is not induced by an spacial isometry . in that case",
    "it is also clear that we must have at least two non similar minimal configurations , and at most @xmath36 critical values of the potential function restricted to any inertia level .",
    "if all the masses are equal , the action of the full symmetric group preserves the set of central configurations , which in turn implies that the restriction of the potential function to any inertia level has only one critical value , that is , the potential takes the same value at every normalized central configuration .    before beginning the proof of the theorem ,",
    "let us explain our special interest in minimal central configurations .",
    "they appear repeatedly in the recent literature on the general @xmath34-body problem .",
    "more precisely , the minimality condition is often necessary to apply global variational methods .",
    "indeed , in @xcite the second author and venturelli have proved that if @xmath37 is a given minimal configuration normalized in the sense that @xmath38 , then for any configuration @xmath4 there is at least one motion @xmath39 starting from @xmath4 which is completely parabolic for @xmath40 , and whose normalized configuration @xmath41 converges to @xmath37 .",
    "more recently , percino and snchez - morgado @xcite built the busemann functions associated to each minimal configuration .",
    "this last result improves the previous one , because each of these functions is provided with a lamination of completely parabolic motions which are asymptotic to the minimal configuration .    in higher dimensions",
    ", as we already said , very little is known about the number of minimal central configurations modulo similitude . however , at the risk of being bold and naive , it seems natural to expect that generically in the masses there should be only one minimal configuration .",
    "this is true for instance when the dimension of the euclidean space in which the bodies move is @xmath42 and the number of bodies @xmath34 does not exceeds @xmath43 . in this case",
    "we have , _ for any choice of the masses _ , only one minimal configuration in which all the mutual distances @xmath44 are equal .",
    "the main result in this work shows that this is also true for arbitrary number of bodies and generic masses in the collinear case .",
    "the proof of theorem [ minmoulton ] is divided in several lemmas which shall be established in the next section .",
    "the first two are given for the sake of completeness even if they are well known .",
    "more precisely , these two lemmas contain a proof of moulton s theorem which includes the analytic dependence on the mass vector .",
    "we begin by recalling a very useful and well known way to normalize central configurations which was proposed by yoccoz at a conference in palaiseau ( @xcite ) .",
    "it is clear that @xmath45 is a central configuration if and only if there exits @xmath46 such that @xmath47 since the functions @xmath19 and @xmath20 are homogeneous of degree @xmath48 and @xmath49 respectively , we deduce that @xmath50 hence that @xmath51 . we also see that @xmath52 is a central configuration if and only if @xmath53 is a central configuration for all @xmath54 , and that @xmath55 .",
    "therefore we conclude that there are two natural ways to normalize the size of a central configuration : fixing the value of the moment of inertia , or fixing the value of @xmath56 .",
    "the advantage of the second one is that the normalized configuration is a critical point of the function @xmath57 in the open set @xmath58 rather than a critical point of the restriction of @xmath19 to some level set of the moment of inertia .",
    "our first lemma proves the uniqueness and the analytical dependence on the masses , of the normal central configuration once fixed the ordering of the bodies .",
    "let us introduce before some convenient notation .",
    "first , since we will consider varying masses , it will be convenient to use the notation @xmath59 and @xmath60 for the values at @xmath61 of the potential function and the moment of inertia respect to the origin respectively .",
    "note that both functions @xmath19 and @xmath20 are real analytic functions in @xmath62 .",
    "finally , as usual , @xmath63 will denote the group of bijections of the set @xmath64 into itself .",
    "each element of @xmath63 is therefore identified with an ordering of the @xmath34 bodies in the oriented straight line .",
    "for @xmath17 we define the open set @xmath65 as the set of configurations of @xmath34 bodies in the oriented line with the ordering prescribed by @xmath66 , that is to say , @xmath67 in other words , @xmath68 means that the mass @xmath69 occupies the place @xmath70 from left to right .",
    "it is clear that the set @xmath71 of configurations without collisions is the disjoint union of the above sets .",
    "thus @xmath58 has @xmath16 connected components .",
    "[ moulton - analitico ] for each @xmath17 there is a real analytic function @xmath72 such that @xmath73 is the unique central configuration in @xmath65 for the collinear @xmath34-body problem with mass vector @xmath74 such that @xmath75 .",
    "we will prove that for any value of @xmath76 and any @xmath17 the function @xmath77 has a unique critical point in @xmath65 .",
    "clearly @xmath78 is a proper function over each convex set @xmath65 . indeed",
    ", for each @xmath79 , @xmath80 implies that @xmath61 is in the closed set @xmath81 and @xmath82 is a compact subset of @xmath83 . on the other hand @xmath78",
    "is strictly convex in @xmath58 .",
    "a simple computation shows that @xmath84 when @xmath85 .",
    "thus given @xmath86 and @xmath87 we can write @xmath88 which implies that the spectrum of the hessian matrix is uniformly bounded from below by @xmath89 where @xmath90 .",
    "the same conclusion can be obtained by application of the gershgorin circle theorem ( see @xcite ) .",
    "therefore we deduce that the function @xmath78 has one and only one critical point at each component @xmath65 of @xmath58 .",
    "we will call @xmath91 this critical point .",
    "we have that @xmath91 is the unique central configuration in @xmath65 such that @xmath92 .",
    "the map @xmath93 is real analytic because it is also defined by the real analytic implicit function theorem ( see for instance chapter 6 in @xcite ) , applied to the real analytic function @xmath94 given by @xmath95 we know that the necessary condition to apply the implicit function theorem is satisfied since @xmath96 is the hessian matrix of the function @xmath78 and we already know that is positive definite at every point .    in order to finish the proof ,",
    "we write as a function of @xmath74 the corresponding central configuration with unitary moment of inertia . indeed , since @xmath92 we have that @xmath97 and therefore @xmath98 defines a real analytic function which gives , for each value of the mass vector @xmath74 the unique central configuration in @xmath65 with moment of inertia equal to @xmath99 .",
    "now we will prove that the collinear central configurations , also called moulton configurations , are local minima of @xmath100 .",
    "note that @xmath101 is the value of the potential @xmath102 at the normalized configuration @xmath103 .",
    "moreover , if we call @xmath104 then every central configurations in @xmath105 is a nondegenerate local minimum of the restriction @xmath106 , and a global minimum on each component @xmath107 .",
    "we give the proof of this well known fact for the sake of completeness .",
    "we will use the arguments in the proof of the previous lemma .",
    "[ nondegenerate - local - minima ] given @xmath76 and @xmath17 let us write @xmath108 for the set of normal configurations with order @xmath66 .",
    "the function @xmath109 has a unique global minimum which is nondegenerate .",
    "we already know that @xmath110 has a unique critical point , thus we only have to prove that it is a nondegenerate minimum .",
    "the critical point is the point @xmath111 in the previous lemma , so we have @xmath112 where @xmath113 is the unique critical point of @xmath114 in @xmath65 .",
    "now we consider the map @xmath115 given by @xmath116 clearly , @xmath117 is a smooth embedding which satisfies @xmath118 , as shown in figure 1 .",
    "moreover , for any @xmath119 we have @xmath120 hence @xmath121 for some constant @xmath122 .",
    "this proves that @xmath111 is a nondegenerate minimum of @xmath110 because @xmath78 has a nondegenerate minimum at @xmath123 and @xmath124 .    from now on",
    ", we will denote @xmath125 the minimal value of the potential function @xmath102 restricted to @xmath108 , the set of normal configurations of @xmath34 bodies in the oriented line with a given order prescribed by a permutation @xmath17 .",
    "thus we have @xmath126 .",
    "we will say that @xmath127 is _ compatible _ with @xmath128 whenever for every @xmath129 we have @xmath130 of course the condition can be written in terms of @xmath66 and @xmath131 exclusively .",
    "more precisely , taking into account that the value @xmath132 is the number of the body in the @xmath133-th place from , it is easy to see that @xmath66 is compatible with @xmath131 if and only if the function @xmath134 is increasing",
    ".      let @xmath140 be a minimizing sequence for @xmath141 .",
    "this means that @xmath142 and that @xmath143 now , for each @xmath144 , we define @xmath145 as the unique normalized central configuration of the @xmath146 bodies given by lemma [ moulton - analitico ] , for the mass vector @xmath147 and the ordering given by @xmath148 .",
    "thus , for each @xmath144 we have @xmath149 where the last equality is due to lemma [ nondegenerate - local - minima ] .",
    "moreover , if we write @xmath150 then the compatibility of @xmath148 with @xmath66 says that the configuration @xmath151 has the ordering given by the permutation @xmath66 .",
    "the configuration @xmath151 is not normalized for the vector mass @xmath152 as it is clear that @xmath153 .",
    "however , if we define @xmath154 we can write @xmath155 so the normalization of @xmath151 gives the configuration @xmath156 , and we have @xmath157 on the other hand , we have that @xmath158 since @xmath159 , we deduce that @xmath160 thus , given that @xmath161 , we conclude that @xmath162 taking the limit for @xmath163 we obtain the inequality @xmath164    we fix now @xmath165 and we define @xmath166 as the unique normal central configuration for the mass vector @xmath152 and ordering prescribed by @xmath66 .",
    "in particular we have @xmath167 by lemma [ nondegenerate - local - minima ] .",
    "we will prove that the inequality @xmath168 is satisfied whenever @xmath137 is small enough .",
    "this will finish the proof , since it implies that @xmath169    since @xmath148 is compatible with @xmath66 , we can add to the configuration @xmath166 the positions of @xmath170 bodies , in such a way that the ordering of the resulting extended configuration @xmath171 is given by @xmath148 .",
    "we shall call @xmath172 the minimal distance between the positions in the configuration @xmath173 , that is to say , @xmath174 we will also consider the moment of inertia of the configuration @xmath173 with respect to the mass vector @xmath175 , and we will denote it by @xmath176 . thus we can write @xmath177 where @xmath178 moreover , since @xmath52 is a normal configuration for @xmath152 , we can write @xmath179 . thus , normalizing @xmath173 with respect to the mass vector @xmath175 we obtain the configuration @xmath180    we observe now that the homogeneity gives @xmath181 and that @xmath182 hence we deduce the upper bound @xmath183 where @xmath184 . therefore , since the right hand of the previous inequality is a continuous function of @xmath185 , and @xmath186 , we conclude that there is @xmath187 such that @xmath188 whenever @xmath189 , as we wanted to prove .",
    "let us first compute @xmath191 .",
    "the symmetry of the mass vector implies that the central configurations in @xmath192 are also symmetric .",
    "this means that the configurations have the form @xmath193 with @xmath194 .",
    "computing the potential function and the moment of inertia we get @xmath195 so the normal central configuration for this order of the masses is @xmath196 .",
    "we deduce that @xmath197    the second distribution of masses is not symmetric .",
    "however , euler has showed ( see @xcite , or @xcite for a modern reference ) that up to a translation and rescale , a central configuration for the mass vector @xmath198 and order @xmath199 is @xmath200 , where @xmath201 is the unique positive root of the polynomial @xmath202 since in our case we have @xmath203 and @xmath204 the polynomial becomes @xmath205 we claim that there is @xmath54 for which @xmath206 is a translated central configuration",
    ". therefore @xmath207 must be a root of this polynomial , which gives rise to the linear equation @xmath208 whose solution is @xmath209 .",
    "we conclude that , the central configurations , for the mass vector @xmath210 and the ordering given by @xmath199 , have the form @xmath211 with @xmath194 . using the leibnitz formula for the moment of inertia with respect to the center of mass we avoid to translate the configuration .",
    "more precisely , we have @xmath212 in particular , the central configuration with moment of inertia @xmath213 is , up to a translation , the configuration @xmath214 for @xmath215 .",
    "now we can compute the value of the potential function in this configuration , and we get @xmath216      the last lemma we will need in the proof of the theorem is purely combinatorial and characterizes the fact that two permutations are not equal nor symmetric .",
    "let us introduce first simplifying notations .",
    "if @xmath17 is a given permutation , then we will write @xmath219 to denote the permutation corresponding to the inverse order .",
    "more precisely , @xmath219 is defined by @xmath220 . moreover , given @xmath17 and numbers @xmath221 , we will say that @xmath222 is between @xmath223 and @xmath224 if either @xmath225 or @xmath226 .",
    "[ combinatorio ] if @xmath227 and @xmath148 are two given permutations then we have the following alternative : either @xmath228 , @xmath229 , or there are three numbers @xmath221 such that @xmath222 is between @xmath223 and @xmath224 , but @xmath230 is not between @xmath231 and @xmath232 .",
    "clearly , each one of the first two possibilities in the triple alternative excludes the others .",
    "thus it suffices to show that if the third possibility is not satisfied then one of the two first must be true .",
    "it is not difficult to see that if the third possibility is not satisfied then @xmath233 is a monotone bijection .",
    "on the other hand , the only permutations on the @xmath133 numbers @xmath234 which are monotone are the identity and the inversion .",
