    "in statistical physics models for epidemic spreading continue to attract attention because they exhibit non - equilibrium phase transitions with universal properties .",
    "the best known example is the universality class of directed percolation ( dp )  @xcite , which is observed in lattice models for epidemic spreading with nearest - neighbor infection and spontaneous recovery .",
    "very recently , this type of phase transition was observed experimentally for the first time by takeuchi _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite .    in the past two decades",
    "various generalized models of epidemic spreading have been proposed .",
    "one possible generalization is to introduce a local memory in order to mimic the effect of immunization  @xcite .",
    "this leads to the so - called general epidemic process ( gep ) , which has been studied both numerically and by field - theoretic methods  @xcite .",
    "another possibility is to consider long - range infections which are usually modelled by so - called levy flights ( for a recent review see  @xcite ) . in such models",
    "the infection is transported over randomly chosen distances @xmath0 , which are power - law distributed as @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the spatial dimension and @xmath4 is an exponent controlling the characteristic shape of the distribution . by studying dp with levy flights it turns out that critical exponents vary continuously in a certain range of @xmath5 .",
    "let us briefly recall some of the main results for the gep .",
    "starting point is the langevin equation for directed percolation , i.e. , epidemic spreading without immunization .",
    "@xmath6    here @xmath7 is the density of infected individuals , @xmath8 is a parameter controlling the spreading rate , @xmath9 reflects to lowest order the constraint that individuals can not be doubly infected , and @xmath10 is a diffusion term accounting for nearest - neighbor interactions .",
    "the noise @xmath11 describes density fluctuations caused by the stochastic nature of the spreading process and is defined by the density - dependent correlations @xmath12 as first suggested by cardy  @xcite , the effect of immunization can be implemented by adding a term of the form @xmath13 in this term the integral sums up the past activity at position @xmath14 between the initial condition @xmath15 and the actual time @xmath16 .",
    "if this integrated activity is still small the exponential function is essentially equal to 1 , marking a non - immune individual .",
    "however , when the integrated activity exceeds a certain threshold of the order @xmath17 , the exponential function ` switches ' to zero , representing an immunized individual . omitting arguments @xmath18 the modified langevin equation reads @xmath19 as can be seen , the exponential function is coupled to the field @xmath20 so that it effectively modifies the spreading rate  @xmath8 .",
    "this means that non - immune sites are infected with rate @xmath21 , while immune sites are infected with rate @xmath8 .",
    "this allows one to control the rates for the first and all subsequent infections of an individual separately .",
    "the additional term modifies the critical behavior of the transition , leading to a universality class which is different from dp .",
    "this so - called gep - class comprises all models which are defined in the spirit of this langevin equation .    using the janssen - de dominics formalism by introducing a response field @xmath22 and integrating out the gaussian noise , one",
    "is led to a field - theoretic action  @xcite @xmath23\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which is expected to be valid in arbitrary dimensions .",
    "apart from the interpretation as an epidemic process with immunization , the gep also plays an important role as a dynamical process that produces isotropic ( undirected ) percolation clusters in @xmath3 dimensions .",
    "more specifically , whenever the process terminates , it leaves behind a certain cluster of immune sites . this cluster can be shown to be an ordinary percolation cluster  @xcite for which the critical exponents are already known ( in two dimensions even exactly ) and can be expressed in terms of two standard exponents @xmath24 and @xmath25 . in the gep ,",
    "time as an additional degree of freedom induces another exponent , the so - called dynamical exponent @xmath26 .",
    "knowing @xmath24 , @xmath27 , and @xmath26 , the exponents for the survival probability @xmath28 and the average number of particles @xmath29 can be expressed as @xmath30 wehre @xmath31 .",
    "the upper critical dimension of the gep is @xmath32 and the exponents are summarized in table  [ tableexponents ] .",
    ".critical exponents of the standard general epidemic process .",
    "empty entries are not available . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tableexponents ]    in this paper we consider the gep generalized in such a way that the nearest - neighbor interactions are replaced by non - local ones according to a levy distribution  ( [ levydistribution ] ) . for large values of @xmath5 , where the levy flights become short - ranged ,",
    "one expects to recover the standard gep . on the other hand , for sufficiently small values of @xmath5 the interactions",
    "are so long - ranged that any spatial structure is wiped out , hence one expects mean - field behavior . in between there is an intermediate regime described by a non - trivial field theory  @xcite , where critical exponents vary continuously with @xmath5 .",
    ".,width=604 ]    the paper is organized as follows .",
    "in the next section we recall how the problem can be formulated as a field - theoretic action that involves a fractional derivative . then in sect .",
    "[ analysissection ] we analyze the scaling behavior of this action , determine the range where perturbative methods can be applied , discuss two scaling relations which are conjectured to hold to all orders of perturbation theory , and quote the one - loop results derived by janssen _ et al . _",

    "a lvy flight in @xmath3 dimensions is an isotropic random displacement @xmath33 according to a probability distribution which for large distances decays algebraically as @xmath34 here the exponent @xmath4 is a control parameter which determines the asymptotic power - law characteristics of long - range flights . in order to normalize this distribution , a lower cutoff of this power law for small @xmath35",
    "is needed , for example in form of a minimal flight distance .",

    "the operator @xmath42 is known as a fractional derivative because it has certain algebraic properties that generalize those of ordinary derivatives .",
    "for example , for @xmath43 the action of the operator @xmath42 on a plane wave amounts to bringing down a prefactor of the form @xmath44 as a field - theoretic approach to gep with levy flights , one may simply replace the laplacian in the action  ( [ gepaction ] ) by a fractional derivative .",
    "however , past experience in the study of directed percolation with levy flights  @xcite shows that the fractional derivative should be added as a new term without discarding the laplacian .",
    "the reason is that even if the laplacian was not included in the bare action , it would be generated under renormalization group .",
    "therefore , the field - theoretic action describing the long - ranged gep is given by @xmath45\\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]",
    "the major problem technical problem when investigating this action lies in the structure of the exponential function . in order to apply ordinary field - theoretic methods",
    ", one needs to expand the exponential function as a power series .",
    "however , such an expansion is only meaningful if the relevance of the terms under renormalization group decrease with increasing order .    as usual",
    "one introduces the dimensions @xmath46=[k]^{-1}\\,,\\quad [ t]=[k]^{-z}\\,,\\quad [ \\phi]=[k]^{\\chi}\\,,\\quad [ \\tilde\\phi]=[k]^{\\tilde\\chi}\\ ] ] with respect to a momentum scale @xmath47 , where @xmath48 is the dynamical exponent and @xmath49 are the field exponents . as usual , the fields @xmath7 and @xmath50 stand for the creation and removal of active sites .",
    "since each removed particle leaves an immune site behind , the scaling properties of the generated cluster of immune sites are described by the exponent  @xmath51 .",
    "therefore , one can identify @xmath51 with the exponent @xmath24 of isotropic percolation through @xmath52      obviously , the integrand in the last term of the action has the dimension @xmath53 = [ k]^{\\chi - z}.\\ ] ] this means that the exponential function can be expanded as a power series only if @xmath54 since in this case the terms of the series are decreasingly relevant . under this condition",
    "the zeroth term of the series , @xmath55 , can be absorbed by a shift @xmath56 so that the non - trivial term to be retained in the action is the first - order term of the exponential @xmath57 which has the dimension @xmath58^{\\tilde\\chi+2\\chi - z}$ ] . for @xmath59",
    "this term is more relevant than the cubic term @xmath60 in eq .",
    "( [ gepaction ] ) so that the latter one can be discarded . hence for @xmath61 the action takes the form @xmath62.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for @xmath63 this expression reduces to the action of the conventional gep .    by dimensional analysis of the field - theoretic action  ( [ gepaction2 ] ) one obtains the mean field ( tree level ) exponents @xmath64 which are expected to be valid above the upper critical dimension @xmath65      the exponents @xmath49 and @xmath26 are related by two exact scaling relations  @xcite .",
    "these relations can be explained as follows .",
    "the first scaling relation is caused by a rapidity reversal symmetry of the action . as can be verified easily ,",
    "the action of the standard gep is invariant under the replacement  @xcite @xmath66 obviously this rapidity reversal symmetry holds also in the case of long - range interactions @xmath67 .",
    "moreover , it is an exact symmetry which holds to all orders of perturbation theory . comparing the scaling dimensions on both sides",
    "this immediately implies the exact scaling relation forces @xmath68 and @xmath69 to be identical . ]",
    "@xmath70 as long as the field exponent @xmath51 is positive ( which is indeed the case here ) , the condition @xmath54 is fulfilled , justifying the expansion of the exponential term in eq .",
    "( [ gepaction2 ] ) .",
    "the second scaling relation can be made plausible as follows .",
    "the term with levy operator @xmath71 is bilinear in the fields .",
    "therefore , it modifies the free theory , whereas it does not change the interactions described by the cubic terms . in other words ,",
    "the levy term modifies the free propagator of the theory , but it has no influence on the structure of the feynman diagrams .",
    "this means that all loop integrals have exactly the same form as in the standard gep , the only difference being that the free propagator in momentum space @xmath72 has to be replaced by @xmath73 . in",
    "so far the situation is completely analogous to the case of directed percolation with long - range interactions .    in the case of levy - dp",
    "it was observed that the corrections caused by the loop integrals can be expressed as a power series in the momentum @xmath47 . as in any taylor expansion",
    ", this series involves only integral powers , the leading order being @xmath74 .",
    "this means that the long - ranged levy operator produces loop corrections that can be absorbed in the coefficient of the ( short - range ) laplacian . in other words ,",
    "the levy term is not renormalized , but instead renormalizes the short - range diffusion coefficient @xmath75 .",
    "this implies that the levy term with scaling dimension @xmath58^{\\chi+\\tilde\\chi+\\sigma - d - z}$ ] must be invariant under rescaling , hence one obtains the scaling relation @xmath76 this so - called hyperscaling relation holds to all orders of perturbation theory below the upper critical dimension @xmath77 . combining it with eq .",
    "( [ firstscalingrelation ] ) one obtains @xmath78 or equivalently @xmath79 the hyperscaling relation implies that the exponents @xmath80 are related by @xmath81      the scaling relations are particularly interesting at the crossover from the regime , where the levy operator is relevant , to the ordinary gep , where the short - ranged laplacian plays the dominant role .",
    "this crossover takes place at a particular value of @xmath5 denoted as @xmath82 . assuming that the crossover is smooth in the sense that the exponents do not change discontinuously , @xmath82 can be computed by plugging the known gep exponents into the hyperscaling relation  ( [ hyperscaling ] ) and solving it for @xmath5 : @xmath83 for example , in @xmath84 dimensions the threshold for @xmath5 , above which the short - range gep is recovered , is given by @xmath85 at a first glance this result seems to be counterintuitive as it contradicts the naive expectation that the fractional derivative @xmath42 should reduce to the ordinary laplacian @xmath86 at the threshold @xmath63 .",
    "however , studies of directed percolation and the ising model with levy - type interactions have shown that this naive argument does not necessarily hold in an interacting theory .",
    "moreover , it is surprising that in 2d the crossover takes place at a threshold @xmath87 , while in previous studies of directed percolation @xmath82 was always found to be larger than  2 .      according to janssen _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite , the critical exponents computed in @xmath88 dimensions to one - loop order are given by @xmath89 usually a field - theoretic @xmath90-expansion can be verified only approximately by numerical simulations : since the dimension @xmath3 is an integer number , it is in most cases impossible to study small values of @xmath91 .",
    "however , in the present model the upper critical dimension @xmath92 is controlled by the parameter @xmath5 and can be chosen in such a way that @xmath90 becomes small .",
    "this allows one to test the one - loop results directly through monte carlo simulations , as we show in the next section .",
    "for a simulation in @xmath3 dimensions , let us introduce the parameter @xmath93 by @xmath94 for @xmath95 the @xmath3-dimensional system is at the upper critical dimension , while for a small @xmath96 it is slightly below @xmath97 with @xmath98 . substituting this parameter the exponents @xmath99 and @xmath100",
