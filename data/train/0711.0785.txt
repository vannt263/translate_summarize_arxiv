    "mixing phenomenon , i.e. the oscillation of a neutral meson into its corresponding anti - meson as a function of time , has been observed in the @xmath8 , @xmath9 , and most recently @xmath10 systems .",
    "this process is also possible in the @xmath11-meson system , but has not previously been observed .    mixing in heavy flavor systems such as that of @xmath9 and @xmath12 is governed by the short - distance box diagram .",
    "however , in the @xmath0 system this diagram is both gim - suppressed and doubly - cabibbo - suppressed relative to the amplitude dominating the decay width , and thus the short - distance rate is very small .",
    "consequently , @xmath0-@xmath13 mixing is expected to be dominated by long - distance processes that are difficult to calculate ; theoretical estimates for the mixing parameters @xmath14 and @xmath15 range over two - three orders of magnitude @xcite . here , @xmath16",
    "( @xmath17 ) are the masses ( decay widths ) of the mass eigenstates @xmath18 , and @xmath19 . the parameters @xmath20 and @xmath21 are complex coefficients satisfying @xmath22 .",
    "the general experimental method identifies the flavor of the neutral @xmath11 meson when produced by reconstructing the decay @xmath23 or @xmath24 @xcite ; the charge of the accompanying pion identifies the @xmath11 flavor . because the energy release in @xmath25 decays is only @xmath26 mev",
    ", the background is largely suppressed . the @xmath5 decay time ( @xmath27 )",
    "is calculated via @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the distance between the @xmath30 and @xmath5 decay vertices and @xmath20 is the @xmath5 momentum .",
    "the @xmath30 vertex position is taken to be the intersection of the @xmath5 momentum with the beamspot profile .",
    "to reject @xmath31 decays originating from @xmath32 decays , one requires @xmath33 gev , which is the kinematic endpoint .",
    "we have studied the decays to @xmath36 eigenstates and ; treating the decay - time distributions as exponential , we measured the quantity @xmath37 where @xmath38 and @xmath39 are the lifetimes of @xmath40 and ( or ) decays .",
    "it can be shown that @xmath41  @xcite , where @xmath42 parameterizes @xmath43 in mixing and @xmath44 is a weak phase . if @xmath36 is conserved , @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "this method has been used by numerous experiments to constrain  @xcite .",
    "our measurement , based on 540  fb@xmath47 data , yields a nonzero value of @xmath4 with @xmath48 significance  @xcite .",
    "we also searched for @xmath43 by measuring the quantity @xmath49 this observable equals @xmath50  @xcite .",
    "we reconstruct @xmath51 decays and , @xmath52 , and @xmath35 .",
    "candidate @xmath5 mesons are selected using two kinematic observables : the invariant mass of the @xmath5 decay products , @xmath53 , and the energy release in the @xmath54 decay , @xmath55 . according to monte carlo ( mc ) simulated distributions of @xmath27 , @xmath53 and @xmath56 , background events fall into four categories :",
    "( 1 ) combinatorial , with zero apparent lifetime ; ( 2 ) true @xmath0 mesons combined with random slow pions ( this has the same apparent lifetime as the signal ) ( 3 ) @xmath0 decays to three or more particles , and ( 4 ) other charm hadron decays .",
    "the apparent lifetime of the latter two categories is 10 - 30% larger than @xmath57 .    for the lifetime measurements , we select the events satisfying @xmath58 , @xmath59 mev@xmath60 mev and @xmath61 fs , where @xmath62 , and @xmath63 is the decay time uncertainties calculated event - by - event . the invariant mass resolution @xmath64 varies from 5.5 - 6.8 mev/@xmath65 , depending on the decay channel .",
    "the selection criteria are chosen to minimize the expected statistical error on @xmath4 using the mc .",
    "we find @xmath66 @xmath34 , @xmath67 @xmath52 and @xmath68 @xmath35 signal events , with purities of 98% , 99% and 92% respectively .",
    "the relative lifetime difference @xmath4 is determined by performing a simultaneous binned maximum likelihood fit to the , , decay time distributions .",
    "each distribution is assumed to be a sum of signal and background contributions , with the signal contribution being a convolution of an exponential and a detector resolution function , @xmath69    the resolution function @xmath70 is constructed from the normalized distribution of the decay time uncertainties @xmath63 .",
    "the @xmath63 of a reconstructed event ideally represents an uncertainty with a gaussian probability density : in this case , bin @xmath71 in the @xmath63 distribution is taken to correspond to a gaussian resolution term of width @xmath72 , with a weight given by the fraction @xmath73 of events in that bin .",
    "however , the distribution of  pulls \" , i.e. the normalized residuals @xmath74 ( where @xmath75 and @xmath76 are reconstructed and generated decay times ) , is not well - described by a gaussian . we found that this distribution can be fitted with a sum of three gaussians of different widths @xmath77 and fractions @xmath78 , constrained to the same mean . therefore , we choose the parameterization @xmath79 with @xmath80 , where the @xmath81 are three scale factors introduced to account for differences between the simulated and real @xmath77 , and @xmath82 allows for a ( common ) offset of the gaussian terms from zero .    the background @xmath83 is parameterized assuming two lifetime components : an exponential and a @xmath84 function , each convolved with corresponding resolution functions as parameterized by eq . ( [ res ] ) . separate @xmath83 parameters for each final state are determined by fits to the @xmath27 distributions of events in @xmath53 sidebands .",
