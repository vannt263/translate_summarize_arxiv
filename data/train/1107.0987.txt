    "in the recently discovered iron - based superconductors substitutions to the parent compounds that add electrons or holes , as well as isoelectronic substitutions and pressure , suppress the structural and magnetic phase transitions and can ultimately reveal superconductivity with a relatively high transition temperature @xcite .",
    "the proximity of the suppressed magnetic / structural phase transitions to the maximum _ t_@xmath1 values , as well as more direct evidence , suggest the importance of magnetism , most likely itinerant magnetism , to the superconducting state @xcite . among the fe - pnictide - based superconductors , one of the most extensively studied families , aefe@xmath0as@xmath0 , ( ae = ca , sr , ba ) forms in thcr@xmath0si@xmath0 crystal structure with space group i4/mmm .",
    "thcr@xmath0si@xmath0-type compounds are some of the most common ternary intermetallic phases ; for example , the rt@xmath0x@xmath0 ( r = y , la@xmath2lu ; t = mn@xmath2cu , ru , rh , etc . and x = si , ge ) series have been intensively studied for several decades due to the wide range of exciting physical properties displayed by their members @xcite . out of all of the transition metals , t , only mn carries a local moment with the rmn@xmath0ge@xmath0 and rmn@xmath0si@xmath0 compounds ordering magnetically at greatly enhanced temperatures relative to the other rt@xmath0x@xmath0 series .",
    "it is worth noting , though , that lufe@xmath0ge@xmath0 manifests anomalies in susceptibility , resistivity and specific heat at 9  k that have been associated with itinerate magnetic order @xcite . although the precise nature of the magnetic ordering is still unclear , analysis of susceptibility , resistivity and specific heat data lead to the prediction of a sdw state , most likely with an ordering wave vector along a [ 00l ] direction , a result subsequently found by neutron scattering measurements @xcite .",
    "two alternate hypotheses are ( i ) that lufe@xmath0ge@xmath0 ( and yfe@xmath0ge@xmath0 ) are close to the stoner limit and easily forced into a magnetically ordered state , or ( ii ) that the fe is moment bearing with a large paramagnetic effective moment @xcite , but both of these hypotheses are inconsistent with the relatively low ordering temperatures of the other rfe@xmath0ge@xmath0 members which are closer to those of rni@xmath0ge@xmath0 @xcite rather than rmn@xmath0ge@xmath0 @xcite or the stoner enhanced rfe@xmath0ge@xmath3 compounds @xcite .    in order to better characterize this phase transition , in this work",
    "we report the effects of y and sc substitutions on the lu site , as well as ru and co substitutions on the fe site , on the low temperature properties of the parent compound and present the phase diagram for y , sc and ru substitutions . the isoelectronic substitution : y , sc , and ru ,",
    "can be considered as chemical pressure or strain causing primarily steric effects , whereas co substitution , can be considered ( in a rigid band model ) as adding electrons and thereby causing changes in the band filling as well .",
    "the goal of this work was to see how the antiferromagnetic ordering evolves with different substitutions .",
    "single crystals of pure and substituted lufe@xmath0ge@xmath0 were grown out of sn flux @xcite . a typical procedure involved adding , to a 2  ml alumina crucible , about 5  g of sn , and roughly 6  at@xmath4 of lufe@xmath0ge@xmath0 in elemental form . for sc and y substitutions , elements were mixed together according to the ratio lu : sc / y : fe : ge : sn = 1-_x_:_x_:2.4:2:90 , where _ x _ is the nominal concentration of the substitutions . for co and ru substitutions ,",

    "the 20@xmath4 excess of fe was used to suppress the growth of a second phase , lufe@xmath5ge@xmath5 , although it was not crucial and did not change the actual measured properties of the lufe@xmath0ge@xmath0 crystals .",
    "( as indicated by @xmath6 measurements , no additional ferromagnetic impurities were induced due to the extra fe in the starting material . ) the crucible , with starting elements , was sealed in a fused silica ampoule under partial argon atmosphere and then placed in a box furnace and heated up to 1190  @xmath7c over 6  h and held at 1190  @xmath7c for 2  h. the crystals grew while the temperature was reduced to 550  @xmath7c over 96  h , after which the ampoule was quickly removed from the furnace and the molten , sn - rich solution was decanted by use of a centrifuge @xcite . a concentrated hcl etch",
    "was used to remove residual sn from the crystal surfaces .",
    "elemental analysis was performed on each of these batches using wavelength - dispersive x - ray spectroscopy ( wds ) in the electron probe microanalyzer of a jeol jxa-8200 electron microprobe . to get flat surfaces for wds analysis ,",
    "all samples were carefully polished by embedding the samples in epoxy in 0.5 cm diameter carbon ring forms and polishing the surfaces with sand papers and alumina abrasives until a final surface polish with @xmath8 1  @xmath9 m roughness was achieved .",

    "the unit cell parameters were refined by rietica software .",

    "figure [ yt]a shows the temperature dependent magnetization data for h @xmath20 ab of the lu@xmath21y@xmath22fe@xmath0ge@xmath0 series which was measured in the field of 1  t. the parent compound , lufe@xmath0ge@xmath0 , shows a weak temperature dependence that is consistent with a somewhat enhanced pauli paramagnetic behavior @xcite , but that has also been fit to a curie weiss behavior , albeit with an unrealistically high paramagnetic @xmath23 of @xmath8 800  k @xcite . upon cooling to low temperatures there is a clear local maximum followed by a sharp drop ; analysis of @xmath13 gives a transition temperature of 8.2  k , a value that is similar to , but somewhat lower than , the previous report of 9  k @xcite . by substituting y onto the lu site , this transition is suppressed to lower temperatures , ultimately dropping below 2  k for _ x _ @xmath24 0.148 .",
    "the signature of the transition evolves gradually with the substitution level . as the transition",
    "is suppressed a clear , low temperature minimum in @xmath25 is revealed , followed at lowest temperatures by a sharp upturn . by _ x _ = 0.19 the form of @xmath25 is essentially identical to that of pure yfe@xmath0ge@xmath0 .",
    "it is worth noting that this lowest temperature tail does not seem to be extrinsic since it essentially disappears below the tunable magnetic transition .",
    "the effect of y substitution on the low temperature properties of lu@xmath21y@xmath22fe@xmath0ge@xmath0 compounds can also be seen in the electrical transport data which is shown in figure [ yt]b .",
    "the slope of @xmath26 for parent compound changes slightly at around 8  k , which corresponds to the anomaly seen in the magnetization data . upon y substitution ,",
    "the resistive feature remains weak and becomes difficult to resolve for _ x _ = 0.125 , even though the magnetization data show a clear anomaly centered at 3.4  k. for _ x _ @xmath27 0.148 , the signatures in both magnetization and resistivity are suppressed completely .",
    "the effect of sc substitution on the lu site on the low temperature properties is markedly different from that of y substitution as manifested by the temperature dependent magnetization and resistivity data as shown in figures [ sct]a and [ sct]b . as the sc substitution level increases",
    ", the signatures in both magnetization and resistivity are pushed up to higher temperatures instead of being suppressed .",
    "whereas the form of the resistive signature remains essentially unchanged ( a weak decrease in resistance similar to a minor reduction in scattering ) , the magnetic signature evolves in a way different from that of y substituted compound .",
    "the weak local minimum in the susceptibility , seen for temperatures just above the magnetic transition disappears as the magnetic ordering temperature increases ; ultimately , for the highest sc substitution level , _ x _ = 0.045 , the sharp drop in susceptibility associated with the magnetic transition occurs abruptly without any hint of a local minima in @xmath25 .",
    "the enhancement of the transition temperature is further confirmed by specific heat measurement on samples with selected substitution levels ( figure [ sct]c ) .",
    "it can be seen that the corresponding anomaly in specific heat is small but well resolved . with increasing the sc substitution level , the anomaly shifts to higher temperature .",
    "it would be interesting to see the evolution of the transition temperature as well as the signatures of the transition at higher substitution level .",
    "unfortunately , as the substitution level increases , a second phase with different crystal morphology begins to grow and becomes more and more pervasive .",
    "already the nominal _ x _ = 0.20 growth , our highest substitution in this work , yields mostly this second phase and only a small amount of clean 122 phase that had to be carefully separated .",
    "the enhancement of transition temperature by sc substitution as well as the suppression of transition by y substitution is consistent with the result of an existing pressure study of lufe@xmath0ge@xmath0 @xcite which shows that on applying pressure , the transition temperature monotonically increases . with sc substitution for lu , both lattice parameter _ a _ and _ c _ decrease , indicating that sc substitution serves as a chemical pressure . on the other hand",
    ", y substitution leads to increases in both _ a _ and _ c _ lattice parameters , making it similar to negative pressure .    to a first order approximation , both y and sc substitutions cause only steric effects without changing the band filling . in an itinerant picture ,",
    "another way to modify the sample without changing the band filling is to substitute ru for fe .",
    "figures [ rut]a and [ rut]b show the temperature dependent magnetization and resistivity data for the lu(fe@xmath21ru@xmath22)@xmath0ge@xmath0 series .",
    "it can be seen that by ru substitution onto the fe site the 8.2  k transition is suppressed . for _",
    "x _ = 0.008 , the lowest substitution level we were able to achieve , the anomaly in magnetization is suppressed to 5.2  k. the corresponding feature in resistivity is rather weak but can be seen clearly in the first derivative @xmath28 ( not shown ) giving a transition temperature of 4.6  k. for _ x _ = 0.014 , there is an indication of drop in magnetization just as base temperature is approached ; further , lower temperature measurements would be required to determine the precise transition temperature .",
    "no indication of a transition is observed in the resistivity data for this substitution level . for _",
    "x _ = 0.035 , neither magnetization nor resistivity data show any signs of a transition above 2  k.    whereas y , sc and ru substitutions are expected to primarily cause only steric changes , co substitution onto the fe site , with one extra electron per atom , potentially affects the band filling .",
    "figure [ cot]a shows the temperature dependent magnetization data for the lu(fe@xmath21co@xmath22)@xmath0ge@xmath0 series . by co substitution onto the fe site , even with our lowest substitution level , _ x _ = 0.018 , the anomaly is suppressed completely . with the magnetic transition suppressed , the magnetization data manifests the same type of upturn at low temperature that the y and ru substitutions data does .",
    "as the co substitution level is increased , the high temperature susceptibility decreases , consistent with the fact that luco@xmath0ge@xmath0 has a susceptibility that is one order of magnitude smaller than that of lufe@xmath0ge@xmath0 ( as shown in the inset to figure [ cot]a ) .",
    "the complete suppression of the 8.2 k feature by co substitution is further confirmed by both resistivity and specific heat data which are shown in figures [ cot]b and [ cot]c ; neither the change of slope in resistivity nor the anomaly in the specific heat are detected in co substituted compounds for any substitution levels .",
    "based on the magnetization , resistivity and specific heat data , the phase diagrams for y , sc and ru substitutions are presented in figure [ tx ] .",
    "the phase diagrams indicate a near linear suppression ( enhancement ) of the transition temperature for y ( sc ) substitution .",
    "ru substitution suppresses the transition at a higher rate than y substitution and co substitution suppresses the transition at least as rapidly as ru substitution .",
    "given the apparent similarities between the effects of sc substitution and applied pressure as well as the effects of y and ru substitutions it is worthwhile seeing if there is some underlying , unifying parameter that can be used to describe the effects of isoelectronic perturbations of the low temperature magnetic transition in lufe@xmath0ge@xmath0 .",
    "an examination of the plots in figures [ lattice ] and [ tx ] points to possible scaling of the transition temperature with either the unit cell volume or with the _ a_-lattice parameter .",

    "v_/_v_@xmath29 , _ c_/_c_@xmath29 and ( _ c_/_a_)/(_c_@xmath29/_a_@xmath29 ) .",
    "whereas changes in _ a _ and _ v _ may correlate with changes in the magnetic transition temperature , changes in _ c _ or _",
    "c_/_a _ do not .",
    "even though the changes in the _ a_-lattice parameter ( and volume ) are rather small , some clear tendencies can still be extracted .",
    "it can be seen that for y and sc substitution , the transition temperatures can be well scaled with normalized _",
    "a_-lattice parameter , and to a lesser extent normalized volume ( with y substitution transition temperature values jump a little bit at first substitution level ) .",
    "it appears that ru substitution with the higher rate at which it suppresses the transition temperature falls on the edge of the manifold for either normalized _ a_-lattice parameter or normalized volume .",
    "the inset to figure [ tlattice]b includes the transition temperature data from lufe@xmath0ge@xmath0 under pressure . in order to compare our data with those of the pressure study @xcite ,",
    "the change of unit cell volume under pressure was estimated by using the bulk modulus of ybrh@xmath0si@xmath0 @xcite , _",
    "b_@xmath29 = 189  gpa , which is the closest compound that such data could be found for . considering the possibly differences between the bulk moduli of ybrh@xmath0si@xmath0 and lufe@xmath0ge@xmath0 ,",
    "this is only a rough estimation .",
    "it appears that y and sc substitutions as well as the pressure data roughly follow the same scale of volume .",
    "the effects of y and sc substitutions for lu , as well as ru and co substitutions for fe , on the low temperature magnetic phase transition of lufe@xmath0ge@xmath0 have been studied in single crystals and the phase diagrams of y , sc and ru substitution have been established .",
    "the results reveal that whereas sc substitution , which serves as chemical pressure , enhances the transition , y and ru substitutions which serve as negative chemical pressure or strain suppress the transition to lower temperature .",
    "this is consistent with previous report of pressure study of the parent compound lufe@xmath0ge@xmath0 @xcite .",
    "in addition , for y and sc substitutions , there appear to be universal relations between transition temperature and both a - lattice parameter and volume so that transition temperature of these two substitutions can be scaled very well with both a - lattice parameter and volume . as this magnetic phase transition",
