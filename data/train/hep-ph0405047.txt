    "it is , however , difficult to construct such a testable model of inflation since the requirements on the inflaton potential is very stringent.within the minimal supersymmetric standard model , however , it may be possible to use some of the scalar quarks and higgs bosons as the inflaton . for detail , see @xcite . recently , a new mechanism of generating the cosmic density fluctuations has been attracting many attentions , where a late - decaying scalar condensation provides the dominant source of the cosmic density fluctuations . in this scenario , dominant part of the cosmic density fluctuations",

    "even though , in a large class of the curvaton scenario , inflation is assumed as a solution to the horizon and flatness problems as well as to generate the primordial fluctuation of the curvaton field , constraints on the inflaton potential can be relaxed in the curvaton scenario . in addition , since the requirements on the curvaton is not so stringent , it is possible to use ( some of the ) well - motivated particles as the curvaton ; for example , scalar fields in the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) may play the role of the curvaton .",
    "in such a case , it may be possible to study the properties of the fields responsible for the structure formation by collider experiments .",

    "i first discuss the basic scenario . in the curvaton scenario , there are two scalar fields which play important roles ; one is the inflation @xmath0 and the other is the curvaton field @xmath1.i assume the inflation to solve the horizon and flatness problems .",

    "the most important features of the curvaton scenario do not depend on the details of the inflation .",
    "thus , i do not assume any specific form of the inflaton potential .",
    "on the contrary , resultant density fluctuations depend on the potential of the curvaton field . here , for simplicity , i adopt the simplest form of the curvaton potential , i.e. , the parabolic one : @xmath2 where @xmath3 is smaller than the expansion rate of the universe during the inflation @xmath4 . in addition , the curvaton field is assumed to have non - vanishing initial amplitude @xmath5 .    in the scenario ,",
    "the universe starts with the inflationary epoch and , after the inflation , the universe is reheated by the decay of the inflaton .",
    "then , the universe is dominated by the radiation ( which i call @xmath6 ) .",
    "i call the radiation - dominated epoch filled with radiation generated from the decay products of the inflaton as the first radiation dominated epoch , or rd1 epoch , since , in the curvaton scenario , there are two radiation - dominated epochs . denoting the decay rate of the inflaton as @xmath7 , reheating temperature after the inflation is given byin the following discussions , i neglect @xmath8 coefficients which are not important .",

    ", we should compare the size of the curvaton contribution with the inflaton contribution .",
    "even with the curvaton , there is also a contribution from the inflaton fluctuation since i assume inflation as a solution to the horizon and flatness problems .",

    "thus , in the curvaton scenario , there are two conflicting requirements on the initial amplitude of the curvaton field .",
    "one is the upper bound on @xmath5 ; upper bound on @xmath5 for @xmath75 depends on the model of the inflation .",
    "for the case of the chaotic inflation , for example , the curvaton contribution becomes larger than the inflaton contribution if @xmath76 . the other is the lower bound on the @xmath5 , since the @xmath1d epoch can not be realized if @xmath5 is too small .",
    "lower bound depends on the reheating temperatures @xmath77 and @xmath78 given in eqs .",

    "[ fig : phimin ] , i plot the lower bound on @xmath5 to realize the @xmath1d epoch .",
    "now , i discuss the cmb angular power spectrum in the curvaton scenario .",
    "one of the most important consequences of the curvaton scenario is that , if all the components in the universe are generated only from the decay products of @xmath1 , no entropy fluctuation is generated and the primordial density fluctuations ( after the rd2 epoch ) becomes purely adiabatic .",
    "let us first consider such a case .",
    "one important check point is that the scale dependence of the primordial density fluctuations . in the case where the cosmic density fluctuations are generated from the primordial fluctuation of the inflaton",
    ", scale - dependence originates from the change of the slope of the inflaton potential as well as the expansion rate during the inflation . as can be seen from eq .",
    "( [ psi(curv ) ] ) , on the contrary , scale - dependence of the curvaton contribution is only from the change of the expansion rate ( as far as @xmath79 ) .",
    "thus , even though both the curvaton and inflation contributions are from primordial fluctuations of some scalar fields , their scale - dependences are different . defining the spectral index @xmath80 as @xmath81 ^ 2   \\simeq n^{({\\rm inf } , \\delta\\phi)}_{\\rm s}-1,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the spectral indices for the inflaton and curvaton contributions are calculated as @xmath82 where @xmath83 and @xmath84 are slow - roll parameters which are given by @xmath85    due to the change of the scale - dependence",
    ", we can see that the observational constraints on inflation models are relaxed in the curvaton scenario .",
    "for example , for the case of the chaotic inflation with the inflaton potential @xmath86 , spectral indices for the inflaton and curvaton contributions are estimated as @xmath87 and @xmath88 for @xmath89 , @xmath90 and @xmath91 for @xmath92 , and @xmath93 and @xmath94 for @xmath95 .",
    "thus , using currently available constraint on the spectral index @xmath96 @xcite from the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap ) , simple chaotic inflation model with @xmath97 is excluded by the observations while , with the curvaton mechanism , @xmath95 becomes consistent with the observational constraints .",
    "for other class of inflation models , change of the constraint may be more drastic .",
    "next , let us discuss the effects of the possible entropy fluctuation in the curvaton scenario .",
    "as mentioned in the previous section , in the curvaton scenario , correlated mixture of the adiabatic and isocurvature fluctuations may be generated . in order to discuss effects of the entropy fluctuation to the cmb angular power spectrum , it is convenient to parameterize the density fluctuation of the non - relativistic matter as @xmath98_{\\rm rd2 } & ~\\equiv~ &      \\left [ \\frac{\\omega_b}{\\omega_m } \\delta_b^{(\\delta\\phi ) }           + \\frac{\\omega_c}{\\omega_m } \\delta_c^{(\\delta\\phi ) }       \\right]_{\\rm rd2 }      \\nonumber \\\\ & ~=~ &      \\frac{3}{4 } \\left [ \\delta_\\gamma^{(\\delta\\phi ) } \\right]_{\\rm rd2 }       + \\kappa_m \\psi_{\\rm rd2}^{(\\delta\\phi)},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath99 , @xmath100 and @xmath101 are the ( present ) density parameters of the baryon , the cdm , and the non - relativistic component ( and hence @xmath102 ) .",
    "although the density fluctuations for the baryon and the cdm are independent , shape of the cmb angular power spectrum is determined once @xmath103 is fixed .",
    "for the purely adiabatic case , @xmath104 . with the relations ( [ sb ] ) , ( [ sc ] ) , and ( [ sbc ] ) , @xmath103 becomes @xmath105 , @xmath106 , and @xmath107 , respectively .",
    "= 0.5    in fig .",
    "[ fig : clkdep ] , i show how the cmb angular power spectrum depends on the @xmath103 parameter .",
    "as one can see , @xmath108 strongly depends on @xmath103 and , if @xmath109 , deviation of the cmb angular power spectrum from the adiabatic result ( i.e. , @xmath108 with @xmath104 ) becomes sizable .",
    "importantly , the wmap results strongly suggest that the primordial density fluctuations be ( almost ) purely adiabatic ; with the wmap data , @xmath110 is obtained @xcite .",
    "thus , the wmap results impose stringent constraint on the curvaton scenario .",
    "a possible small contamination of the entropy fluctuation in some case will be discussed in the next section .",
    "now , i would like to discuss the case where the curvaton field is also responsible for the scenario of baryogenesis . among various scenarios , there are some cases where the baryon asymmetry of the universe is generated from scalar - field condensations . in those scenarios ,",
    "scalar fields often dominate the universe at some epoch and hence , if they have primordial fluctuations , they may play the role of the curvaton .",
    "probably , two of the most famous examples of the possible scalar fields responsible for the baryon asymmetry are right - handed sneutrino @xcite and the affleck - dine field @xcite.in some case , inflaton can be responsible for the scenario of the baryogenesis .",

    ", i consider the case where the right - handed sneutrino , which becomes the origin of the baryon asymmetry of the universe @xcite , plays the role of the curvaton @xcite .",
    "first , i briefly summarize the model and the thermal history . here , the relevant part of the superpotential is given by @xmath111 where @xmath112 is the yukawa matrix for the neutrino while @xmath113 is the majorana mass matrix for the right - handed ( s)neutrinos . here ,",
    "@xmath114 and @xmath115 are generation indices of the right - handed neutrino @xmath116 while @xmath117 is that of the left - handed lepton doublet @xmath118 . in addition",
    ", @xmath119 is the up - type higgs field .",
    "i work in the basis where the matrix @xmath113 is diagonalized . for simplicity ,",

    "( hereafter , mass of @xmath121 is denoted as @xmath122 . )    with a non - vanishing primordial amplitude , @xmath121 starts to oscillate when @xmath123 and decays when @xmath124 , where @xmath125 is the decay rate of @xmath121 .",
    "since the majorana mass term breaks the lepton - number symmetry , lepton - number asymmetry may be generated at the time of the sneutrino decay if non - vanishing cp violation exists .",
    "such a lepton - number asymmetry becomes the source of the baryon - number asymmetry of the universe with the sphaleron process .",
    "the mechanism of generating the baryon - number asymmetry is basically the supersymmetric version of the fukugita - yanagida mechanism @xcite .",
    "expression for the resultant amount of the baryon asymmetry is , however , rather complicated since , in this case , the primordial abundance of the right - handed sneutrino has non - thermally determined .",
    "assuming @xmath126 , we obtain @xcite @xmath127 where @xmath128 is the temperature at the epoch of the decay of @xmath121 , @xmath129 the mass of the heaviest ( left - handed ) neutrino mass .",
    "( so , if @xmath121 decays after dominating the universe , @xmath128 becomes the reheat temperature due to the decay of @xmath121 . )",
    "in addition , in the basis where the majorana mass matrix for the right - handed neutrinos @xmath130 is real and diagonalized , the effective cp violating phase is given by @xmath131_{11 } }      { [ \\hat{h } \\hat{h}^\\dagger]_{11 } } .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] notice that , with maximum cp violation , @xmath132 .",
    "in addition , @xmath133 is the energy fraction of the radiation generated from the decay product of @xmath121 . with the relation @xmath126",

    "now , i consider the cosmological density fluctuations in this scenario",
    ". in particular , i concentrate on the case where the condensation of the right - handed sneutrino plays the role of the curvaton .",
    "( thus , in this case , the epoch after the decay of @xmath121 is identified as the rd2 epoch . )",
    "the scenario is basically the same as the curvaton scenario which i have explained before .    in the previous discussion ,",
    "i have discussed the cases where all the components in the universe are generated from the decay product of the curvaton , which corresponds to the case of @xmath144 .",
    "as is explained above , however , ( small ) contamination of the radiation from the decay product of the inflaton may always exist .",
    "if the baryon asymmetry is generated from thermally produced particles after the rd2 epoch is realized , then entropy fluctuations vanish and the primordial density fluctuations become purely adiabatic .    in the scenario we consider , however , the situation is quite different since the baryon asymmetry is generated from the decay product of @xmath121 . in particular ,",
    "if the energy fraction of the radiation from the decay product of the inflaton becomes sizable , non - vanishing baryonic entropy fluctuation may be generated .",
    "evolution of the density fluctuations in this case is also understood by solving the einstein and boltzmann equations for the fluctuations given in the previous section .",
    "we can calculate the entropy in the radiation - dominated universe after the decay of both @xmath0 and @xmath121 . in the radiation - dominated universe @xcite",
    "@xmath145 then , with the relation @xmath146 with @xmath147 , we obtain @xmath148 using the fact that the entropy between any component produced from @xmath121 and that from the inflaton field is conserved , we can relate @xmath149 with @xmath150 ; with the relation @xmath151 , we obtain @xmath152 thus , if @xmath121 decays much after it dominates the universe , @xmath144 and hence the metric perturbation becomes comparable to the primordial entropy perturbation . on the other hand , if @xmath153 , the metric perturbation becomes negligibly small .",
    "since the baryon asymmetry is generated from @xmath121 , the density fluctuation in the baryonic component is given by @xmath154 thus , the entropy between the baryon and the radiation is given by @xmath155 and defining @xmath156 we obtain @xmath157 if the right - handed sneutrino once dominates the universe , @xmath158 and hence the perturbation becomes adiabatic .",
    "( thus , the situation is like the case discussed in the previous section . )",
    "it is interesting if a sizable amount of the energy density of the radiation is from the inflaton . in this case , @xmath159 becomes smaller than @xmath160 and correlated mixture of the adiabatic and isocurvature fluctuations is generated .",
    "as mentioned in the previous section , wmap data suggests that the baryonic and cdm entropy fluctuations should be very small ; @xmath161 @xcite . if @xmath162 , however , @xmath163 can be smaller than the present upper bound but the deviation of the cmb angular power spectrum from the adiabatic result may still be within the reach of the future precise observations .",
    "thus , it is desirable to find the signal from the ( correlated ) entropy fluctuation in the future precise observations of the cmb anisotropy for the test of the curvaton scenario .",
    "finally , let me comment on the case where the curvaton also generates the baryon asymmetry of the universe via affleck - dine mechanism .",
    "if the primordial fluctuation of the affleck - dine field becomes the dominant source of the cosmological density fluctuations , large baryonic entropy fluctuation is generated even if the universe is once completely dominated by the affleck - dine field .",
    "this is due to the fact that the affleck - dine field is a complex scalar field and also that the resultant baryon asymmetry of the universe is sensitive to the initial value of the affleck - dine field .",
    "if the affleck - dine field acquires primordial fluctuation , its initial phase as well as the initial amplitude is expected to have fluctuations .",
    "here , i have discussed the basic features of the curvaton scenario and its implications to particle cosmology . in particular , i have discussed that the cosmic density fluctuations can dominantly originate from the primordial fluctuation of the `` curvaton '' field , which is a late - decaying scalar condensation other than the inflaton . in the curvaton scenario ,",
    "scale - dependence of the cosmic density fluctuation becomes different from the case of the simple inflation , and in many cases , the spectral index @xmath164 becomes close to @xmath160 compared to the simple inflation case .",
    "thus , given the fact that the cmb anisotropy observed by the wmap suggests ( almost ) scale - invariant primordial density fluctuations , observational constraints on the inflaton potential can be relaxed by adopting the curvaton scenario .",
    "one of the important feature of the curvaton scenario is the possible contamination of the ( correlated ) entropy fluctuation in the non - relativistic matter .",
    "the cmb angular power spectrum is sensitive to the entropy fluctuation .",
    "thus , if such correlated entropy fluctuation is sizable , it affects the shape of the cmb angular power spectrum and hence it will be interesting and important to try to find its consequence in particular in the cmb anisotropy at future precision observations of the universe .",
