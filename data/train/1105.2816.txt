    "given the massive black holes ( mbhs ) known to reside at the centers of most galaxies ( magorrian et al .",

    "a complete study of the tidal disruption process was carried out recently by strubbe & quataert ( 2009 , hereafter sq09 ) and lodato & rossi ( 2011 , hereafter lr11 ) .",
    "for mbhs with greater than @xmath2 , the tidal disruption radius lies inside the event horizon for a typical main sequence star , so the star would be swallowed whole .",
    "the rate of such events is calculated to be @xmath310@xmath4 yr@xmath5 galaxy@xmath5 , depending on galaxy type ( wang & merritt 2004 ) .",
    "wang & merritt derive a rate @xmath310@xmath6 yr@xmath5 mpc@xmath7 , which , given a local galaxy space density of @xmath30.01 mpc@xmath7 ( driver et al .",

    "ground - based nir and radio observations provided the first clear evidence connecting the x - ray / gamma - ray source with the galaxy nucleus ( berger et al .",

    "quataert & kasen ( 2011 ) point out however that the signal - to - noise of the xrt data is not sufficient to constrain significant variability on @xmath19 s timescales , therefore the central bh mass could be much lower . similarly , the host galaxy brightness places only an upper limit on the bh mass from the magorrian relation , since no `` bulge '' is actually resolved .",
    "in addition , miller & gltekin ( 2011 ) use empirical relations relating central black hole mass to radio and x - ray luminosity for sw1644 + 57 to argue for a central mass @xmath20 . in view of these considerations and the uncertainty associated with applying the magorrian relation , in this work",
    "we seriously entertain the possibility that @xmath21 may lie between @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",

    "2011ab , shao et al .",
    "2011 ) , and yet the contrast between theoretical expectation ( uv source at @xmath24 erg s@xmath5 ) and observation ( gamma - ray / x - ray source at @xmath25 erg s@xmath5 ) lead to the unavoidable conclusion that we are viewing a strongly beamed event .",
    "in fact , the jet that we must be observing is completely divorced from the physical properties of the fallback disk , other than relying on accretion as a power supply .    in this work",
    "we estimate the rate of accretion within a transient disk formed from the tidal debris of a disrupted star , and estimate a temperature in the inner disk .",
    "we also calculate the expected rates , both for _ swift_/bat and all - sky x - ray monitors with @xmath3mcrab sensitivity .",

    "this gives @xmath31 where @xmath32 , @xmath33 , and @xmath34 ( rees 1988 , 1990 ) .",

    "an equivalent way of visualizing this is in terms of the mean density enclosed by @xmath41 . for a nonspinning ( i.e. , schwarzschild )",

    "we now look at the long term evolution of the resultant mass accretion rate onto the mbh , both in terms of stellar debris fallback and accretion disk .",
    "earlier studies give an expression , derived in the newtonian limit , for the time scale of return of the most bound stellar material to periastron ( lth82 , rees 1988 , cf . equation [ 4 ] of lr11 ) @xmath53 where the dynamical time at periastron @xmath54 .",

    "superposed on the long - term x - ray light curve of sw 1644 + 57 , levan et al .",
    "( 2011b ) and bloom et al .",
    "( 2011b ) show a @xmath67 decay law .",
    "this suggests that the x - ray luminosity tracks the rate of return of the fallback material to pericenter . in this work",
    "however , we argue that only the early light curve , @xmath68 d , is representative of the stellar debris fallback ; the subsequent evolution is dominated by the accretion disk . as mentioned above ,",
    "the very high x - ray luminosity points to a strongly beamed source , with a beaming factor @xmath69 , so that the intrinsic jet luminosity @xmath70 is related to the observed @xmath71 by @xmath72 let us assume that the jet luminosity is a fraction @xmath73 of the kinetic energy carried by the outflowing material : @xmath74 where we have also assumed that the outflow velocity @xmath75 .",
    "the outflow rate itself is a fraction @xmath76 of the fallback rate @xmath77 , where , for a mildly super - eddington accretion flow , we expect @xmath78 ( sq09 , lr11 , dotan & shaviv 2011 ) .",
    "we do not wish to restrict ourselves to baryonic jets ; this same analysis could be applied to a poynting flux jet , with @xmath73 denoting a mass - energy equivalent flux .",
    "we can thus obtain an estimate of the fallback rate @xmath77 as a function of the observed x - ray luminosity : @xmath79 using equations ( 5 ) and ( 7 ) , we can thus obtain an estimate of the fallback time and of the penetration factor @xmath56 : @xmath80 @xmath81 note that @xmath56 is very weakly dependent on both the stellar mass and on the black hole mass @xmath82 ( krolik & piran 2011 ) .",
    "we acknowledge the simplicity of the assumption that @xmath73 and and @xmath83 are independent of the eddington ratio of the accretion rate .",
    "there is observational evidence that agn decrease in radio loudness with decreasing eddington ratio ( e.g. , sikora et al .",
    "this may be the result of a fundamental change in the underlying accretion disk structure , e.g. , from a slim disk to a thin disk .",
    "based on the total sw1644 + 57 light curve to date , which has exhibited a dynamic variation in averaged x - ray flux of @xmath842 orders of magnitude , our assumption @xmath85 may be at least crudely justified .",
    "in other words , although the accretion physics will likely change with eddington ratio ( i.e. , slim - to - thin disk ) , this transition occurs at   a low eddington ratio @xmath30.01 , which is not applicable to date for sw1644 + 57 .",
    "several works have considered the observational consequences of ultra - relativistic jets from tdes prior to sw 1644 + 57 ( farrar & gruzinov 2009 , giannios & metzger 2011 ) . giannios & metzger find , on the assumption of a baryonic jet , that emission from the forward shock may be detectable for several years .",
    "however , motivated by results from recent groups studying 3d grmhd jets ( hawley & krolik 2006 , mckinney & blandford 2009 ) which find a baryonic zone - of - exclusion in the jet beam , leading to primarily poynting flux jets , we do not restrict our focus to baryonic jets , and indeed we view poynting flux jets to be more likely .",
    "on the other hand , the jet luminosity can be dominated by poynting flux even if most of its rest mass is in baryons . if the jet remains poynting dominated out to the distance where it begins to interact with the ism , a forward shock with concomitant non - thermal emission can still be produced ( e.g. , mimica , giannios , & aloy 2009 ) .",
    "a highly magnetized jet transfers energy efficiently to the environment , and the lorentz factor of the forward shock is related to the magnetization of the jet , not its lorentz factor , which could be much less .    at @xmath86",
    "d from the bat trigger the x - ray luminosity crosses @xmath87 erg s@xmath5 . inserting these values into equation ( 11 ) , after taking into account the offset time 2 d to be added to the 2.5 d , we obtain @xmath88 s @xmath89_b^3/2 f^-3/2 _ j^-3/2 @xmath90@xmath911@xmath92f@xmath93_j@xmath94>0.2(0.1)@xmath95m_b7=1@xmath96>0.04(0.02)@xmath95m_b7=0.1@xmath97l_disk_acc_fallbackc^2    if one assumes @xmath98 and @xmath99 , the resulting @xmath56 value would be smaller than the minimum given by equation ( 6 ) .",
    "this allows us to put reasonable bounds on the least constrained parameters , @xmath73 and @xmath83 . by requiring that @xmath56",
    "be larger than the minimum value , we get @xmath100 unless @xmath101 is much smaller than the value above , the event must have been deeply plunging . note that the condition above is strongly dependent on the black hole mass .",
    "if the mbh mass were smaller , closer to @xmath102 , that would relax the stringency of the deeply plunging constraint .",
    "the need for a deeply plunging orbit can also be obtained considering the properties of the accretion disc formed by the debris .",
    "the process of fallback does not directly supply gas into the mbh , but rather it returns material to @xmath3@xmath48 and therefore feeds an accretion disk .",
    "given the small inferred @xmath103 value with respect to the total length of the x - ray light curve , it seems probable that at early times an accretion disk is established .",
    "an evaluation of @xmath104 using equation ( 7 ) shows that 90% of the total available fallback mass @xmath105 has already been supplied to the accretion disk by @xmath10632@xmath103 .",
    "it is therefore of interest to estimate the properties of the accretion disk , given a resident disk mass @xmath3@xmath107 .",
    "one may estimate the long term accretion rate in sw 1644 + 57 by looking at the properties of the accretion disk formed from the debris .",
    "we idealize the disk as extending from the event horizon to @xmath108 , where @xmath109 . for the high rates of accretion",
    "expected we use the super - eddington slim disk considered by cg09 ( see their section 2.3.2 ) in which the radial distribution of surface density @xmath110 in a roughly steady disk would be @xmath111 , thus @xmath112 . therefore integrating the mass distribution @xmath113 out to @xmath108 , and setting it equal to the mass of the fallback debris @xmath26 , one obtains @xmath114",
    "we derive an estimate for the properties of the resultant disk using algebraic scalings .",
    "inverting equation ( 24 ) of cg09 to obtain @xmath115 yields @xmath116 where the disk radius @xmath117 cm and @xmath118 is the shakura & sunyaev ( 1973 , hereafter ss73 ) @xmath119 parameter in units of 0.1 . substituting for @xmath120",
    "gives @xmath121 where @xmath122 is the fallback debris mass in units of @xmath107 .",
    "substituting for the disk radius @xmath108 in units of @xmath123 cm , @xmath124 , gives @xmath125 equation ( 18 ) only gives a measure of the initial value of the rate of accretion within the accretion disk formed rapidly by stellar fallback .",
    "the longer term evolution is given by cg09 as @xmath126 where @xmath127 and @xmath128 .",
    "the time @xmath129 is basically the viscous time for a thick disk at @xmath48 .    for a disk mass which varies as @xmath130 ,",
    "the global viscous time scale @xmath131 increases with time .",
    "the outer edge of an `` external '' accretion disk , defined by the lack of a confining torque as from a companion in an interacting binary , moves outward with time .",
    "the fact that @xmath132 results from the spreading of the outer disk edge , and the viscous time is determined by the slowest time scale in the system , i.e. , that at large radii . on the other hand , in comparing the time scales for mass fallback with a viscous time scale , the more relevant time within the disk is not that at the outer edge , but rather the response time of the disk at the radii where the fallback mass is deposited @xmath129 .     and",
    "the red lines show the fallback decline rate expected due to a super - eddington slim disk , @xmath133 .",

    "the x - ray flux @xmath310@xmath134 erg s@xmath5 is super - eddington for @xmath135 , and also quite different spectrally from theoretical expectations if we were directly observing the disk . on the lower panels we indicate the expected slopes for stellar debris fallback and accretion due to the external disk formed by the stellar debris .",
    "there appears to be a difference in the decay characteristics at @xmath136d , which we interpret as the start of the disk - dominated decay .",

    "@xmath139 d is close to the time @xmath140 d in the sw 1644 + 57 light curve where there appears to be a change in the decay characteristics . if this is indeed associated with the debris fallback / disk decay transition , it provides further evidence for a small periastron value @xmath141 . for @xmath142",
    "the putative @xmath140 d transition corresponds to a larger @xmath143 .",

    "\\(2 ) the long term x - ray luminosity is @xmath310@xmath206 times greater than expected for eddington accretion .",
    "this points strongly to beaming , as has been inferred for grbs .",
    "in addition , in the long term light curve there appears to be a change in the decay properties at @xmath136 d which we interpret as the onset of disk - dominated accretion . by comparing our theoretical decay rates for stellar debris fallback and accretion in a freely expanding super - eddington disk",
    ", we find that a small value @xmath207 is required , @xmath208 , for @xmath209 .",
    "the observed x - ray luminosity at @xmath32.5d @xmath21010@xmath211 ( @xmath212 ) for @xmath138 ( 0.1 ) would imply a beaming factor @xmath213 ( for @xmath214 ) , similar to blazars ( sikora et al .",
    "2005 , bttcher et al .",
    "the sudden introduction of @xmath30.5@xmath215 of gas inside the ergosphere of a kerr bh would launch powerful jets within a few local orbital time scales ( mckinney 2005 ) .",
    "figure 1 of mckinney shows the steep dependence of jet efficiency on bh spin to mass ratio @xmath216 , and in particular a steep upturn close to @xmath217 .",
    "in fact it may be that our putative constraint on @xmath48 , namely @xmath218 ( which requires @xmath217 ) , is a necessary condition for this rare event .",
    "\\(3 ) the standard tde rate @xmath219 yr@xmath5 galaxy@xmath5 implies a _",
    "swift_/bat detection rate @xmath330 yr@xmath5 , for a beaming factor @xmath310@xmath176 , which can be strongly excluded . a deeply plunging orbit , @xmath173 , lowers the tde rate by a factor @xmath310@xmath220 , giving a rate in line with the bat detection rate of @xmath31/7 yr@xmath5 .",
    "our revised rate @xmath3@xmath175 yr@xmath5 galaxy@xmath5 may need adjusting to correct for relativistic effects .",
    "ayal et al .",
    "( 2000 ) compare newtonian and relativistic tde methods and find slight differences in @xmath48 between the two sets of calculations , for the same initial trajectory .",
    "they also find that @xmath375% of the star becomes unbound , rather than @xmath221% .",
    "however , this depends strongly on the treatment of cooling , which was not modeled in their sph ( smoothed particle hydrodynamics ) simulations .",
    "another potential source of concern in our estimates is our use of the ss73-like algebraic scalings for the accretion disk .",
    "the ss73 methodology was expanded by novikov & thorne ( 1973 ) to include general - relativistic corrections including the full kerr metric .",
    "their multiplicative correction factors are based on taylor expansions of the form @xmath222 , where @xmath223 , @xmath224 , and the factors @xmath225 , @xmath226 , @xmath227 , ... , @xmath228 , @xmath229 , @xmath230 , ... are of order unity .",
    "these extra multiplicative terms would therefore modify our simple estimates by factors of order unity , even at small radii .",
    "it is worth noting that nearly all previous theoretical studies of tidal disruption have , for simplicity , considered orbits for which the periastron radius @xmath48 equals or is slightly interior to @xmath29 ( rees 1988 , evans & kochanek 1989 , clg90 , ulmer 1999 , sq09 ) .",
    "few works have considered deeply plunging disruptions ( e.g. , guillochon et al . 2009 ) .",
    "it appears sw 1644 + 57 may require @xmath201 , and would be different in at least two important ways from the standard tde .",
    "( 1 ) first , the rates would be lower .",
    "the rate for deeply plunging orbits would be less than that for traditional tdes in which @xmath231 by @xmath232 , thus giving @xmath3@xmath233 yr@xmath5 galaxy@xmath5 , if the more common normal , i.e. , `` total '' tde rate integrated over all @xmath48 values is @xmath3@xmath219 yr@xmath5 galaxy@xmath5 .",
    "( 2 ) second , to observe the event we need to be situated within the beam , which would only cover @xmath3@xmath200 of the sky .",
    "our estimate of the beam size is based on the ratio of observed x - ray luminosity to expected mass - energy accretion luminosity .",
    "there have been no detailed theoretical studies investigating the scenario we outline in this work .    for an orbit",
    "in which @xmath234 , for example , the tidal force acting on the star at periastron would be @xmath3(0.15)@xmath235 times that minimally needed to unbind the star .",
    "the subsequent evolution might be more properly called `` obliteration '' rather than `` disruption '' , hence we propose the acronym toe ( tidal obliteration event ) . from sq09 and earlier studies , in the moving frame of the center - of - mass of the star , the acceleration of the outer layers due to the mbh tidal force @xmath3@xmath236 acting over a dynamical time @xmath237 results in velocity perturbations to the stellar envelope @xmath238 , where @xmath239 is the escape speed from the stellar surface . for @xmath240 , the velocity perturbation exceeds the stellar escape speed by a factor @xmath320 .",
    "the star would likely be completely shredded in @xmath310@xmath211 s. the half of the star remnants with orbits on inward trajectories would immediately establish a super - eddington disk within the ergosphere of the mbh .",
    "the discovery of a new class of objects raises several interesting questions .",
    "for instance , why should a sudden accretion event onto a @xmath3@xmath241 bh resemble in any way a grb ?",
    "if there were an accretion event in which @xmath3@xmath107 were suddenly introduced near the event horizon , the time scales would be consistent with what is observed . within the first five days",
    "the light curve of sw 1644 + 57 showed flares with rise and decay times of @xmath3@xmath242 s. it is unclear whether these variations stem from jet instabilities or are associated with disk time scales . an orbital time scale at the tidal radius @xmath243 hr @xmath244 ( 0.5 hr for @xmath142 ) .",
    "an after - the - fact examination of prior bat data revealed a slow brightening over several days , significant at the @xmath3@xmath245 level .",
    "the source was already bright in x - rays by the time xrt began observations .",
    "it appears we require a deeply plunging orbit , @xmath203 , and the orbital time @xmath246 at the corresponding @xmath48 is @xmath3300 s for @xmath138 ( @xmath3100 s for @xmath142 ) .",
    "the small periastron radius and general relativistic corrections such as the advance of the line of apsides would enormously speed up the tde evolution compared to what is shown for instance in figure 3 of sq09 .",
    "this is evidenced in the apparent @xmath3@xmath247 hr timescale for the fallback time .",
    "the process responsible for utilizing the accretion power in the inner disk to tap the bh spin , presumably the magnetorotational instability ( balbus & hawley 1998 ) operating inside the ergosphere ( mckinney & narayan 2007ab ) , would proceed with an initial growth rate given roughly by the local orbital frequency . given a small seed field within the gas , it is likely that a large number @xmath24830 of @xmath249folding times are required before the shear amplification of the local magnetic field leads to the nonlinear development of a strong jet .",
    "weak precursor events may have contributed to low - level bat activity preceding the main sw 1644 + 57 trigger .",
    "considering the commonalities among jets observed to date in such a wide variety of objects , nature appears to be telling us that the jet physics is largely independent of the mass of the central black hole .",
