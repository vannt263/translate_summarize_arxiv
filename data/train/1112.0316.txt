    "one of the primary physics goals of the cern large hadron collider ( lhc ) is the direct study of the electroweak symmetry breaking ( ewsb ) sector via the production of new states associated to it .",
    "the analyses of unitarity in the weak gauge boson scattering @xmath4 indicates that there must be a contribution of the ewsb at the tev scale  @xcite , well within the lhc reach .",
    "there is a plethora of possibilities for the ewsb sector that contains new scalar and vector resonances , and the standard model ( sm ) represents only the minimal scenario , with a higgs sector with one scalar higgs boson being responsible for cutting off the growth of the weak gauge boson scattering amplitudes .",
    "new vector resonances are a common feature of models where the ewsb is due to a new strongly interacting sector  @xcite .",
    "although the precision electroweak measurements and flavor changing neutral currents present an obstacle for strongly interacting theories , recent theoretical advances made possible the construction of models in agreement with the experimental constraints  @xcite . furthermore , new spin1 states are also present in extra dimension scenarios , in particular in higgsless models  @xcite where unitarity restoration takes place through the exchange of an infinite tower of spin1 kaluza - klein excitations of the known electroweak gauge bosons  @xcite .",
    "such scenarios can be viewed as the holographic version of strongly coupled theories  @xcite .    in this work ,",
    "we derive bounds on new neutral spin1 resonances ( @xmath5 ) associated to the ewsb from the available atlas and cms data on @xmath2 pair production @xmath6 where @xmath7 and @xmath8 stand for electrons and muons .",
    "we perform a model independent analysis proposed in refs .",
    "we present our results as constraints on the relevant spin-1 boson effective couplings , mass and width .",
    "for instance , our results indicate that @xmath5 s coupling with sm strength to light quarks and to pairs @xmath2 saturating the partial wave amplitudes can be excluded at 95% cl if their masses are lighter than @xmath9 gev .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : frame ] we present our model independent parameterization of the @xmath5 properties .",
    "section  [ ana : frame ] contains a detailed accounting of the procedures used in our analyses . our model",

    "our conclusions are drawn in section  [ sec : summary ] .",
    "in order to evaluate the @xmath5 production cross section via the channel ( [ eq : proc ] ) we must know the @xmath5 couplings to light quarks and @xmath2 pairs in addition to its mass and width .",
    "we do not assume any relation between these parameters ( although they might be connected in a complete theory ) .",
    "nevertheless , inspired by models where the new vector states interact with the light quarks and electroweak gauge boson via their mixing with the sm vectors , we assume that the @xmath5 couplings exhibit the same lorentz structure as those of the sm .",
    "we normalize the @xmath10 coupling by the value @xmath11 that saturates the partial wave amplitude for the process @xmath12 by the exchange of a @xmath5 ,  @xcite , _ i.e. _ @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the strength of the sm triple gauge boson coupling . here",
    "@xmath15 stands for the @xmath16 coupling constant and @xmath17 is the cosine of the weak mixing angle .",
    "we treat the @xmath5 width as a free parameter since it can receive contributions from particles that do not play a role in our study , such as @xmath18 and @xmath19 quarks .",
    "the only bound to the @xmath5 width is that it should be compatible with its couplings to light quarks and @xmath20 pairs that is expressed by the lower bound  @xcite @xmath21 where we have defined the combination @xmath22 with @xmath23 being the @xmath5 coupling to light quark pairs and @xmath24 .",
    "within our approach we can express the cross section for the process ( [ eq : proc ] ) as @xmath25 where the standard model , interference and new resonance contributions are labeled sm , int and @xmath5 respectively .",

    "our strategy is to use the sm backgrounds that have been carefully evaluated by the experimental collaborations and we simulate only the @xmath5 signal .",
    "however , in order to tune and validate our monte carlo we also simulated the sm production of @xmath2 pairs and compared with the results presented by atlas and cms .",
    "we evaluated the signal and sm @xmath26 cross sections by two different methods . in the first one , we used the package madevent  @xcite to evaluate the @xmath27 signal matrix elements for the subprocesses @xmath28 , with @xmath29 as well as the small contribution with @xmath30 which then decays leptonically into either @xmath31 or @xmath32 and the corresponding neutrinos .",

    "<S> several extensions of the standard model predict the existence of new neutral spin1 resonances associated to the electroweak symmetry breaking sector . using the data from atlas ( with integrated luminosity of @xmath0 ) and cms ( with integrated luminosity of @xmath1 ) on the production of @xmath2 pairs through the process </S>",
    "<S> @xmath3 , we place model independent bounds on these new vector resonances masses , couplings and widths . </S>",
    "<S> our analyses show that the present data excludes new neutral vector resonances with masses up to 12.3 tev depending on their couplings and widths . </S>",
    "<S> we also demonstrate how to extend our analysis framework to different models working a specific example . </S>"
