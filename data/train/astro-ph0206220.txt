    "the supernova remnant ( snr )  is a close analogue of the crab nebula in several respects . at radio wavelengths it has a filled - center morphology , a flat spectrum , and shows significant polarization @xcite .",
    "its x - ray spectrum is non - thermal , and the x - ray and radio extents are comparable ( @xmath10 ; lu , aschenbach , & song 2001 ) .",
    "it is a classic compact synchrotron nebula powered by its putative energetic pulsar , with no evidence for a thermal component corresponding to shocked ism or stellar ejecta . using the  x - ray observatory , lu et al .",
    "( 2002 ) have recently identified the central compact source ( pulsar candidate ) and imaged with @xmath11 arcsecond resolution beautiful coherent structures ( e.g. , a ring ) that are a manifestation of the relativistic pulsar wind interacting with the ambient medium .",
    "the morphological and spectral properties of  revealed by  leave no room for doubt as to the presence of a central pulsar .",
    "it is nevertheless of considerable interest to detect actual pulsations , and to measure the period of rotation @xmath12 and its derivative @xmath13 . because the snr is powered entirely by the pulsar , knowledge of the input energy source ( pulsar spin - down ) luminosity ( @xmath14 , where @xmath15gcm@xmath9 is the neutron star moment of inertia )",
    "would improve our understanding of the energetics of the nebula . also , the pulsar characteristic age @xmath17 is a useful ( if sometimes crude ) measure of the snr age , especially in cases like  where no independent reliable age estimate exists .",
    "finding radio and/or x - ray pulsations is also important because a significant sample of well - studied snrs and their pulsars provides a window into the distribution of initial spin periods and magnetic fields of neutron stars .",
    "finally , detection of pulsations addresses the poorly constrained luminosity distribution , `` beaming fraction '' , and hence galactic population of young neutron stars .",
    "the snr  was searched for a radio pulsar by gorham et al .",
    "( 1996 ) with the `` pre - upgrade '' arecibo telescope . at a frequency of 1408mhz ,",
    "their 30min observation of a 40mhz - wide band reached a claimed sensitivity of 300@xmath18jy for a pulsar with period @xmath19s of duty - cycle 10% and dispersion measure @xmath20@xmath1pc ( based upon their assumptions , we find their limiting sensitivity to be @xmath21jy ) .",
    "following the striking  observations of @xcite , we attempted the most sensitive search currently possible at arecibo . in this letter",
    "we report the discovery of a 136ms radio pulsar which , through a subsequent detection in archival  x - ray data , is confirmed to be the neutron star powering snr  .",
    "on 2001 august 29 we collected data for a full source transit of 2.7hr within which it can not be tracked ; nevertheless we continued data ( noise ) collection during this 8min interval in order to maintain phase coherence of the data set . ] at a center frequency of 1175mhz .",
    "however these data were too corrupted by radio - frequency interference to be searched , and the observations were redone on 2002 april 29 .",
    "the incoming signals from the telescope were recorded using the wide - band arecibo pulsar processor ( wapp ) , a fast - dump digital correlator ( dowd , sisk , & hagen 2000 ) currently capable of sampling a band of either 50 or 100mhz and determining either 3- or 9-level correlation functions .",
    "all observations for this search utilized the 100mhz 3-level mode of the wapp in which raw auto - correlation functions ( acfs ) for each of the two polarizations ( ifs ) were written to disk as either 32- or 16-bit numbers .",
    "data from 2001 august were collected in 32-bit mode recording 256 lags every 570@xmath18s with the two ifs summed on - line .",
    "data from 2002 april were collected in 16-bit mode recording 256 lags every 295@xmath18s separately for each of the two ifs at a frequency of 1180mhz .",
    "off - line preparation of wapp data for search processing proceeded by applying the van  vleck correction ( see , e.g. , hagen & farley 1973 ) to each set of 256 acfs to remove unwanted 3-level quantization effects .",
    "the resulting unbiased acfs were then fourier transformed to produce spectral channels so that the data following this step are , in effect , equivalent to power streams from a filter bank with @xmath22 spectral channels .",
    "since the search targeted a young ( @xmath23ms ) pulsar , the ideal sampling interval for our observations would have been @xmath24ms .",
    "however the slowest sample time of the wapp ( determined by the size of the registers used to store accumulated correlation values ) is @xmath25s in 16-bit , 2-if mode , and the faster - sampled data recorded were instead decimated off - line by adding every 8 time samples before further processing .",
    "at this point summing of the 2 ifs and reduction in precision to 8-bit quantities were also performed .",
    "the data reduction tools used for this stage of the analysis are described by lorimer ( 2001)drl / sigproc . ] .",
    "the data from 2002 april were reduced thereafter in standard fashion .",
    "the 256 time series of @xmath26 samples , each decimated to a resolution of 2.36ms , were de - dispersed at 1001 trial dms in the range 01000@xmath1pc .",
    "finally , these 1001 time series were each searched for periodic signals over a range of duty cycles with an fft - based code ( see lorimer et al .",
    "2000 for details ) .",
    "an unmistakable periodic and dispersed signal with @xmath27ms was detected with maximum signal - to - noise ratio of 20.7 at @xmath28@xmath1pc .",
    "nine days later we confirmed this signal in a shorter observation , by which time the barycentric period had increased by @xmath29s , indicating a period derivative @xmath30 . at this stage , we searched archival x - ray data for ( and found ) pulsations (   [ sec : xray ] ) .",
    "we have begun timing observations of the pulsar and so far have obtained times - of - arrival ( toas ) on 5 occasions spanning 24 days .",
    "in addition we reduced , and obtained toas from , the 2001 august data .",
    "we have used the tempo timing software and the toas , along with the pulsar position known to @xmath31 accuracy from  data @xcite , to derive the @xmath12 and @xmath13 listed in table  [ tab : parms ] .",
    "we regard this as a preliminary ephemeris because of the 8 month gap between the first toa and the recent set .",
    "= 8.0truecm    the average pulse profile at a frequency of 1180mhz is displayed in figure  [ fig : radioprof ] , and was obtained by phase - aligning and summing the profiles obtained on each day according to the ephemeris given in table  [ tab : parms ] .",
    "we have measured the area under each of the individual profiles , and their baseline offsets , and used these , together with the known telescope gain and system temperature ( including their dependencies on zenith angle and the contribution from galactic synchrotron and snr emission ) , to estimate the average flux density of the pulsar .",
    "we obtain @xmath32jy , where the uncertainty is the addition in quadrature of the standard deviation of the 6 measurements ( @xmath33jy ) and a @xmath3415% contribution accounting for imperfectly known system parameters .",
    "the field containing  was observed in the x - ray band on 1997 april 2728 with the _ advanced satellite for cosmology and astrophysics _ (; tanaka , inoue , & holt 1994 ) to search for a crab - like pulsar .",
    "this observation was designed to allow temporal studies with the two gas scintillation imaging spectrometers ( giss ) at a time resolution of 0.488ms throughout the exposure . to ensure consistent ( high ) temporal resolution , during periods",
    "when real - time telemetry was not available , data were taken at a reduced ( @xmath35 ) spatial resolution at the slower ( medium ) bit - rate and stored on board .",
    "although the spatial resolution of the gis ( @xmath36 ) is insufficient to resolve the pulsar from the surrounding nebula , the moderate ( @xmath3710% ) energy resolution in the 0.510kev bandpass allows some measure of energy discrimination of the instrumental and x - ray background . to search for pulsations , we combined gis data from both instruments and from data sets taken in different spatial modes .",
    "the latter necessitated rebinning the sky pixels of the high bit - rate data to match the medium bit - rate data set .",
    "all data were edited to exclude times of high background contamination using the standard ( rev2 ) screening criteria .",
    "the resulting effective observation time was 22.7ks spanning 43.1ks .",
    "photon arrival times were corrected to the solar system barycenter using the jpl de200 ephemeris and the known pulsar position ( table  [ tab : parms ] ) .",
    "arrival times were obtained for 2210 photons extracted from a @xmath38 radius aperture centered on the peak of x - ray emission from  and restricted in energy to 210kev to optimize the signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "we generated a periodogram using the @xmath39 statistic by folding the extracted photons over a range of test frequencies centered on the extrapolated radio measurement , using a crude spin - down rate based on the discovery and confirmation observations .",
    "we detected a single @xmath40 signal with a narrow pulse profile near the predicted period . using the @xmath41 test to gain sensitivity to @xmath42 harmonics of the fundamental frequency @xcite",
    ", we obtained a best signal with @xmath43 . while not significant in a blind search ( probability of chance occurrence is @xmath44 per trial , or 0.13 in a 020hz search range with @xmath45hz resolution ) , this is the strongest signal in the search range .",
    "impressively , the barycentric period of @xmath46ms on 50566.0 mjd differs by only ( @xmath47)@xmath18s from the period extrapolated back to this epoch with the preliminary radio timing ephemeris obtained 5yr later (   [ sec : radio ] ) .",
    "this confirms that the x - ray signal represents a bona fide detection of pulsations from the radio pulsar . as there is no x - ray source in the  field other than the point - source pulsar candidate that could generate the pulsed x - ray emission detected by ,",
    "we conclude unambiguously that we have in fact detected radio and x - ray pulsations from  at the center of snr  .",
    "the x - ray pulse profile , shown in figure  [ fig : xrayprof ] , is similar in shape to the radio profile ( fig .",
    "[ fig : radioprof ] ) , with a single narrow peak of @xmath48 duty - cycle .",
    "the pulse width is slightly larger than that found in the radio , but is limited by the statistics of the observation .",
    "the measured pulsed fraction , defined as the ratio of counts in the light - curve above the mean baseline in the off - pulse interval to the total counts , is 9.5% . however",
    "this result is contaminated by emission from the nebula . using all available data (  gis and  acis - s3 ) together",
    "we can constrain further the properties of the pulsar .",

    "( 2002 ) was significantly affected by pile - up @xcite .",
    "we have used a new version of the spectral analysis software xspec that accounts for this , obtaining a corrected pulsar photon index @xmath50 ( uncertainties are 90% confidence levels ) and measured flux in the 210kev band of @xmath51erg@xmath52s@xmath4 .",
    "the absorbing column density was fixed at @xmath53@xmath52 @xcite , for which the unabsorbed pulsar flux is @xmath54erg@xmath52s@xmath4 .",
    "this spectrum corresponds to a count rate in the 210kev  gis band of 0.044s@xmath4 , computed with wpimms for a @xmath55 radius aperture .",
    "the pulsed rate measured within this aperture is 0.012s@xmath4 , implying a pulsed fraction of @xmath56 .",
    "this compares to a fraction of @xmath57 for the vela pulsar ( helfand , gotthelf , & halpern 2001 ) , and @xmath58 for psr  j2229 + 6114 @xcite , two young pulsars with values of @xmath59 within a factor of 2 of s .",
    "the absolute phase alignment of the x - ray and radio profiles ( to be determined from scheduled _ rxte _ and planned radio observations ) will provide a further diagnostic of the emission mechanism(s ) .",
    "pulsars such as this one are known to emit a substantial fraction of their spin - down luminosity in magnetospheric @xmath60-rays .",
    "lies @xmath61 from the high energy ( @xmath62mev ) egret @xmath60-ray source 3eg  j1928 + 1733 @xcite .",
    "this is slightly outside the 99% confidence - level error box , but given its weakness and the possibility of an extended or multiple source , an association is not out of the question .",
    "the @xmath12 and @xmath13 measured for  imply a large spin - down luminosity @xmath63ergs@xmath4 , small characteristic age @xmath64yr , and surface magnetic dipole field strength @xmath65 g ( table  [ tab : parms ] ) .",
    "these parameters are virtually identical to those of psr  j1124@xmath665916 in snr  g292.0 + 1.8 , and place it in the group of @xmath34 pulsars with the highest values of @xmath59 and smallest apparent ages known , all of which are associated with snrs ( see camilo et al .",
    "however its parameters are substantially different from those of the crab pulsar , which remains the only galactic neutron star known with @xmath67ms and @xmath68ergs@xmath4 .",
    "the pulsar s characteristic age allows for a useful estimate of its actual age ( and that of the snr ) , given by @xmath69/(n-1)$ ] under the assumption of constant magnetic moment , where @xmath70 is the initial period and @xmath42 is the braking index of rotation @xcite . for magnetic dipole braking , @xmath71 , and",
    "measured values span @xmath72 ( see , e.g. , camilo et al .",

    "2002a ) . considering the extremes of @xmath75 and @xmath76ms in turn ,",
    "the age of j1930 + 1852/  likely lies in the range 15006000yr .",
    "the distance of snr  has been estimated from a measurement of the x - ray absorption column density , which is found to be about half the total galactic absorption in this direction . as the galaxy here extends to @xmath34kpc from the sun ,",
    "lu et al .",
    "( 2002 ) consider @xmath77kpc . assuming the snr to be associated with the star - forming region g53.9 + 0.3 , velusamy & becker ( 1988 ) obtain @xmath78kpc .",
    "the dispersion measure of  ( table  [ tab : parms ] ) provides an independent estimate : the taylor & cordes ( 1993 ) free electron density / distance model suggests @xmath79kpc .",
    "a newer model incorporating , among other improvements , discrete regions of enhanced ionized material ( j.  m. cordes & t.  j. lazio 2002 , in preparation ) , yields @xmath80kpc ( t.  j. lazio 2002 , private communication ) , consistent with the estimate derived from x - ray measurements . while the distance to this snr / pulsar pair remains uncertain , we here retain @xmath77kpc as a plausible estimate .",
    "we now comment on some features of the pulsar wind nebula ( pwn ) . a composite  image of  ( fig .",
    "[ fig : cxo ] ) demonstrates the trend of x - ray spectral softening from the inner to the outer regions of the nebula ( as first indicated in the analysis of lu et al .",
    "this is likely caused by a combination of synchrotron cooling and adiabatic expansion of the shocked wind material .",
    "the 210kev luminosity of the pwn / pulsar combination is @xmath81ergs@xmath82 .",
    "this is a factor of @xmath83 lower than that of the pwn surrounding psr  j1124@xmath665916 , a pulsar with identical spin parameters to  @xcite@xmath84hz ) of , @xmath85ergs@xmath86 @xcite , is half that of the pwn powered by psr  j1124@xmath665916 .",
    "however , in one significant respect these two pulsar / snr systems are different : psr  j1124@xmath665916 and its pwn are part of the text - book composite snr  g292.0 + 1.8 , embedded in a large and bright shell of stellar ejecta @xcite , whereas to date no thermal emission has been detected surrounding . ] . by contrast , the cooling efficiencies ( @xmath87 ) of the pwne surrounding the vela @xcite and j2229 + 6114 @xcite pulsars , with similar @xmath59 , are much lower : @xmath88 ; while that of the crab nebula is @xmath89 times higher ( e.g. , helfand & becker 1987 ) . the extent to which these differences are due to different ambient media , energy spectra of the injected pulsar wind ( including the time evolution thereof ) , and ages , among other variables , is not clear .      with the discovery of , four very young and energetic pulsars have been uncovered in the past year , all with luminosities of @xmath8mjykpc@xmath9 in the 1400mhz radio band ( halpern et al .",

    "2002a , b ; this letter ) .",
    "these are well below the luminosities of previously known young pulsars ( see camilo et al .",
    "2002a ) , and it is now clear that such pulsars can be extremely faint .",
    "determining their intrinsic luminosity distribution requires disentangling observed `` pseudo - luminosities '' from beam - averaged values .",
    "for example , do the broad wings of emission in  visible in figure  [ fig : radioprof ] indicate nearly aligned rotation and magnetic axes with an impact angle grazing the outer boundary of a radio beam with possibly large averaged luminosity ? studies of polarized emission may provide important clues to constrain the beaming geometry of individual pulsars .    naturally , a large sample of young pulsars is also desirable , together with upper limits from the most sensitive searches possible of well - selected targets .",
    "in this regard , it is significant that new and upgraded radio telescopes are now available .",
    "the discovery of  is an excellent example , as it could only barely have been made with the arecibo telescope prior to its upgrade in the late 1990s : in addition to the increased bandwidth , we can now sample a lower - frequency band ( 1175 vs. 1400mhz ) , where pulsars are brighter and the telescope s gain is higher .",
    "planned improvements in system temperature and bandwidth at arecibo , the new green bank telescope , and the remarkably productive parkes telescope , along with the continued availability of the superb  x - ray observatory , offer the prospect of yet further progress in studies of faint young neutron stars .",
    "we thank joe taylor and joel weisberg for generously giving us some of their telescope time for the original radio observation , and john harmon for scheduling it .",
    "we are also grateful to shri kulkarni for designing the  observation , and to jeff hagen , bill sisk and andy dowd for their sterling work in realizing the potential for wide - band pulsar observations with the upgraded arecibo telescope .",
