    "ngc 4472 ( m49 ) is a giant elliptical galaxy in the virgo cluster , located at 4@xmath10 south of ngc 4486 ( m87 ) at the center of the cluster .",
    "ngc 4472 is the brightest member of the virgo cluster , some 0.2 mag brighter than the cd galaxy m87 .",
    "ngc 4472 is an outstanding example of giant elliptical galaxies showing a bimodality in the color distribution of globular clusters ( geisler , lee & kim 1996 ; lee , kim & geisler 1998 ) .",
    "the bimodal color distribution of the globular clusters in ngc 4472 has shown that there are two kinds of cluster populations in this galaxy : a metal - poor population with a mean metallicity of [ fe / h ] @xmath11 dex and a more spatially concentrated metal - rich population with a mean metallicity of [ fe / h ] @xmath12 dex .",
    "interestingly it is found that the metal - rich globular clusters show some properties in common with the galaxy halo stars in their spatial distribution and color profiles , while the metal - poor globular clusters do not show such behavior .",
    "this result indicates that there may exist some connection between the metal - rich globular clusters and halo stars in ngc 4472 ( lee et al .",
    "1998 ) .",
    "[ cols=\"<,^,^,^ , < \" , ]      it is found that there is clearly a negative color gradient for @xmath13 (= 15 kpc ) in ngc 4472 in the sense that the color gets bluer with increasing radius : @xmath14 mag arcsec@xmath4 for @xmath15 . in general ,",
    "color gradients in giant elliptical galaxies are interpreted as evidence for a metallicity gradient , while color gradients in dwarf galaxies may be due to age effects ( vader et al .",
    "1988 ; peletier et al .",
    "the color gradient in the inner region of ngc 4472 corresponds to a metallicity gradient of @xmath6[fe / h ] @xmath7 dex .",
    "this result is similar to that derived from the line - strength gradient for @xmath16 of ngc 4472 by davies et al .",
    "this value for ngc 4472 is similar to the mean value known for giant elliptical galaxies , @xmath6[fe / h]@xmath17 dex ( kormendy & djorgovski 1989 ; peletier et al .",
    "1990 ; davies , sadler & peletier 1993 ) .",
    "the metallicity gradient in ngc 4472 may result from dissipational collapse .",
    "however , the metallicity gradients predicted by conventional models of galaxy formation based on dissipational collapse ( larson 1975 ; carlberg 1984 ) are much steeper than the value observed in ngc 4472 . considering that the metallicity gradients can be diluted by a factor of 2 over three merger events @xcite , davies et al .",
    "( 1993 ) pointed out that the shallow metallicity gradients support the hypothesis that giant elliptical galaxies form by stellar mergers , and that the line - strength ( metallicity ) gradient may be due to their progenitors which formed predominantly by dissipational collapse .",
    "some of the observed properties of the globular clusters in ngc 4472 also support the merger hypothesis for the formation of ngc 4472 , while some do not .",
    "this point was discussed in detail by lee et al .",
    "( 1998 ) .",
    "on the other hand , it is difficult to understand in terms of galaxy formation that the color profile of ngc 4472 shows a positive gradient in the outer region at @xmath18 .",
    "this trend was also shown by the @xmath19 color profile given by cohen ( 1986 ) , but this @xmath19 color profile showed a positive color gradient even for the inner region which is contrary to others , as seen in fig .",
    "other deep photometry of the outer region of ngc 4472 and other giant elliptical galaxies are needed to investigate this feature further .",
    "we have presented surface photometry in washington @xmath8 and @xmath9 filters for a wide field centered on the brightest elliptical galaxy in virgo , ngc 4472 .",
    "our data cover a wider field than those of any previous ccd surface photometry , and our photometry goes deeper than any previous photometry .",
    "primary results obtained in this study are summarized as follows :    \\(1 ) surface brightness profiles for the outer region of ngc 4472 obtained in this study lie between those found in the wide field photographic studies of king ( 1978 ) and caon et al .",
    "the surface brightness profiles of ngc 4472 are not fit well by a single king model , but they can be fit approximately by two king models : one for the inner region and the other for the outer region .",
    "surface brightness profiles for the outer region can be fit approximately also by a devaucouleurs law .",
    "\\(2 ) there is obviously a negative color gradient for the region at @xmath13 of ngc 4472 in the sense that the colors get bluer with increasing radius .. the slope of the color gradient for this region is derived to be @xmath14 mag arcsec@xmath4 for @xmath5 , which corresponds to a metallicity gradient of @xmath6[fe / h ] @xmath7 dex",
    ". however , the surface color appears to get redder slowly with increasing radius for the region with @xmath18 .",
    "\\(3 ) a comparison of the structural parameters of ngc 4472 in @xmath8 and @xmath9 images has shown that there is little difference in the ellipse shapes between isochromes and isophotes .",
    "\\(4 ) photometric and structural parameters of ngc 4472 have been determined , which are listed in table 3 .",
