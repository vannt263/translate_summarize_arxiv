    "many - body perturbation theory ( mbpt ) is a leading method for computing excited - state electronic properties in solid - state physics  @xcite . within many - body perturbation theory ,",
    "hedin s @xmath2 method  @xcite is the most widely used approximation for the self - energy , @xmath1 .",
    "the exact one - body green s function , @xmath3 ( which contains information about ground and excited - state properties of the system ) can be written , using a dyson equation , in terms of a suitable green s function of a `` zeroth - order '' system of non - interacting electrons , @xmath4 ( constructed from that system s one - particle wavefunctions and energies ) , and the self - energy operator @xmath1 .",
    "the approximation is defined by the choice of zeroth - order system and by the expression ( typically a diagrammatic expansion in terms of @xmath4 ) used to approximate @xmath1 .",
    "the self energy , @xmath1 , contains all the information of many - body interactions in the system and can be obtained by using hedin s set of coupled equations : @xmath5 @xmath6 @xmath7 @xmath8 and the dyson equation , where @xmath9 is the polarizability , @xmath0 the screened and @xmath10 the unscreened coulomb interaction and @xmath11 the vertex function.the notation @xmath12 is used to denote space , spin and time variables and the integral sign stands for summation or integration of all of these where appropriate .",
    "( @xmath13 denotes @xmath14 where @xmath15 is a positive infinitesimal in the time argument ) .",
    "atomic units are used in all equations throughout this paper .",
    "these are four coupled integro - differential equations where the most complicated term is the _ vertex _ , @xmath11 , which contains a functional derivative and hence , in general , can not be evaluated numerically .",
    "the vertex is the usual target of simplification for an approximate scheme .",
    "the widely used @xmath2 approximation is derived with the hartree method as a starting point , and hence has a rigorous foundation only when started from a non - interacting green s function , @xmath4 , made from eigenstates of the hartree hamiltonian .",
    "this is because the initial self - energy , @xmath16 and the vertex function is correspondingly set to @xmath17 since @xmath18 .",
    "solving hedin s equations with the vertex fixed in this expression yields the so - called self - consistent @xmath2 approximation . in this approach",
    ", the self - energy operator is formed from a product of a green s function and a screened coulomb interaction , where the green s function used is consistent with that returned by dyson s equation .",
    "since the self - energy depends on @xmath3 , this procedure should be carried out self - consistently , beginning with @xmath19 .    in practice , it is customary to use the first iteration only , often called @xmath20 , to approximate the self - energy operator .",
    "here , @xmath21 is perhaps the simplest possible screened interaction , which involves an infinite geometric series over non - interacting electron - hole pair excitations as in the usual definition of the rpa .",
    "it is important to make this one iteration as accurate as possible , so an initial @xmath4 calculated using kohn - sham density - functional theory in the local - density approximation ( dft - lda ) is normally used .",
    "this choice of @xmath4 generally produces much more accurate results for quasiparticle energies ( the correct electron addition and removal energies , in contrast to the dft - lda eigenvalues@xcite ) .",
    "however , because this choice of @xmath4 corresponds to a non - zero @xmath22 , there is no longer a theoretical justification for the usual practise of setting the vertex to a product of delta functions and different choices for the exchange - correlation functional may lead to different green s functions @xcite .    using the static exchange - correlation kernel , @xmath23 , ( which is the functional derivative of the dft exchange - correlation potential , @xmath24 , with respect to density , @xmath25 ) del sole _",
    "_ @xcite demonstrated how @xmath20 may be modified with a vertex function to make @xmath1 consistent with the dft - lda starting point .",
    "they added the contribution of the vertex into both the self - energy , @xmath1 , and the polarization , @xmath9 . the result is a self - energy of the form @xmath26@xcite .",
    "the @xmath27 approximation is obtained when the vertex function is included in @xmath9 only . as commented by hybertsen and louie@xcite and",
    "_ , both these results take the _ form _ of @xmath2 , but with @xmath0 representing the coulomb interaction screened by respectively the test - charge - electron dielectric function and the test - charge - test - charge dielectric function , in each with electronic exchange and correlation included through the time - dependent adiabatic lda ( tdlda ) .",
    "et al . _ found that @xmath26 yields final results almost equal to those of @xmath20 for the band gap of crystalline silicon and that the equivalent results from @xmath27 were worse when compared to @xmath20 .",
    "it should perhaps be mentioned that the inclusion of other types of vertex corrections have been studied before as well , most notably corrections based on various approximations of a second iteration of hedins equations , starting with @xmath20@xcite .",
    "however , these have usually been applied with initial kohn - sham ( ks ) green s functions , which are still not theoretically consistent with that starting point .",
    "the correct theoretical treatment of a second - iteration vertex from ks green s functions is quite complicated and still absent in the literature .",
    "the purpose of the present work is to make a systematic study , for both localized and extended systems , of a simple _ ab initio _ vertex correction whose form is determined by the starting approximation for the self - energy ( @xmath28 for dft - lda ) .",
    "related vertex corrections , including others derived from @xmath23 , have been investigated in earlier work . for example , northrup _ et al . _",
    "@xcite used lda bulk calculations as a starting point and a plasmon - pole calculation of the response function in conjunction with a @xmath27-like vertex correction in the screened interaction .",
    "they found a narrowing of the band widths of na , li and k@xcite in agreement with the experiments of jensen and plummer@xcite who had noted that the experimental band width was significantly narrowed ( @xmath29 ) compared to the free - electron result .",
    "@xmath20  @xcite calculations only gave a narrowing of about @xmath30 for an homogeneous electron gas of the same mean density , indicating a large impact of further many - body effects .",
    "this led to additional experimental and theoretical investigations@xcite but the issue remains controversial @xcite .    for individual atoms , @xmath2 quasiparticle properties",
    "have been investigated previously by shirley and martin@xcite ( including an exchange - only vertex ) and , more recently , total energy studies on atoms and molecules using the variational functionals of luttinger and ward@xcite have been performed by dahlen _",
    "@xcite , stan _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite and verdonck _ et al",
    ". _ @xcite .",
    "these studies have shown that @xmath20 in general gives quasiparticle properties which are much improved over dft and hartree - fock methods and that , when calculated self - consistently , @xmath2 also provides reasonably good total energies for atoms ( with differences versus highly accurate reference methods being on the order of tens of @xmath31 per electron ) . to its merit ,",
    "self - consistent @xmath2 is also a conserving approximation in the baym - kadanoff@xcite sense .",
    "however , non - self consistent total energies in @xmath20 are noticeably less accurate .",
    "conversely , the good agreement between the quasiparticle energies and experiment is destroyed when performing self - consistent calculations .",
    "the answer to why this happens must , by definition , lie with the only approximated quantity , the vertex correction .",
    "this study is meant to address the need for a precise ( including a full treatment in frequency ) comparative study of the vertex corrections proposed by del sole _",
    "et al . _ for localized and extended systems within @xmath32 .",
    "hybertsen and louie@xcite comment that it is possible to start a @xmath2 calculation from an initial self - energy , @xmath33 .",
    "this approach gives a theoretical basis for beginning a @xmath32 calculation from dft - lda orbitals .",
    "adopting this idea , we see from eq.([hedin_iv ] ) that the second term is now non - zero , unlike in the @xmath2 approximation .",
    "since the electron density is @xmath34 then , @xmath35 where delta - functions are to be understood in all other variables . in an appendix",
    "_ @xcite show how to add this approximate vertex to both @xmath0 and @xmath1 , and into @xmath0 only , by forming two different effective @xmath0s .",
    "our method follows that of del sole _",
    "_ @xcite by modifying the dielectric function , @xmath36 from its form in the rpa .",
    "the screened coulomb interaction in mbpt is written as @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the inverse dielectric function .",
    "we use the full polarization without recourse to plasmon - pole models .",
    "the random phase approximation ( rpa ) dielectric function is @xmath39 del sole _",
    "_ show that adding the form of the vertex from eq.([vertex ] ) into both @xmath1 and @xmath0 modifies the rpa dielectric function to , @xmath40 which leads to the introduction of an effective screened coulomb interaction @xmath41 .",
    "this is trivial to implement into a @xmath2 computer code as it requires a simple matrix addition , once @xmath23 is calculated .",
    "the result of this modification is that @xmath41 contains not only the screened coulomb interaction but also an exchange - correlation potential .",
    "we shall refer to this method as @xmath26 as we have added the correct dft - lda vertex to the @xmath2 method , hence the method is a one - iteration @xmath42 ( @xmath43 ) calculation beginning with a dft - lda green s function .",
    "an alternative choice for the effective dielectric function , @xmath44 corresponds to adding @xmath23 into @xmath0 only .",
    "we term this method @xmath27 as the lda vertex is inserted into the screened coulomb interaction , @xmath0 , only .",
    "this is equivalent to the one - iteration @xmath2 approximation , @xmath32 but with @xmath0 calculated using the adiabatic lda .    the vertices presented are thus dynamical , i.e. frequency dependent , due to the inclusion of @xmath45 , and must include the excitonic effects of the corresponding jellium due to the appearance of @xmath23 .",
    "another way of looking at it is that this corresponds to a treatment beyond @xmath32 where _ at the level of the vertex corrections _",
    ", the system is modelled by the homogenous electron gas .",
    "it is not likely , however , that these methods would be able to capture any satellite structure beyond that provided by @xmath23 as the calculations are non - self - consistent .",
    "the quasiparticle energies , @xmath46 and wavefunctions , @xmath47 , are formally the solution of the quasiparticle equation , @xmath48 where @xmath49 and @xmath50 are the external and hartree potential , respectively .    in the case of a spherically symmetric system",
    "it is sufficient to describe all non - local operators in the @xmath2 formalism by two radial coordinates and one angular coordinate , @xmath51 , that denotes the angle between the vectors @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "the self - energy , @xmath1 , then assumes the much simpler form , @xmath54                                 p_l(\\cos\\theta),\\ ] ] where @xmath55 is a legendre polynomial of order @xmath56 .",
    "the legendre expansion coefficients of the self - energy , @xmath1 , are calculated directly , thereby circumventing the need for a numerical treatment of the angular dependence .",
    "we use a real - space and imaginary time representation@xcite to calculate the self - energy from the non - interacting green s function @xmath4 .",
    "the self - energy on the real frequency axis , required for solving the quasiparticle equation , is obtained by means of analytic continuation@xcite .",
    "the current implementation has been successfully applied to jellium clusters@xcite and light atoms@xcite .    to obtain the quasiparticle energies and wavefunctions",
    "the quasiparticle equation ( [ qpe : generic ] ) is fully diagonalized in the basis of the single particle orbitals of the non - interacting kohn - sham system . for localized systems the quasiparticle wavefunctions can differ noticeably from the wavefunctions of the non - interacting system or in certain cases",
    "even have a completely different character , as was demonstrated for image states in small metal clusters @xcite .",
    "ground - state total energies were calculated using the galitskii - migdal formula@xcite transformed to an integral equation over imaginary frequency .",
    "this avoids analytic continuation of the self - energy , which would be unreliable for large frequencies .    for jellium , the homogenous electron gas ,",
    "we solve hedin s equations in wavevector and real - frequency space .",
    "this avoids analytic continuation and enables accurate and easy extraction of spectral properties .",
    "again , we do not use plasmon - pole models , but the full frequency - dependent polarization .",
