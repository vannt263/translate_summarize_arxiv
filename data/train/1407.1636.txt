    "can she delegate her quantum computing to bob while keeping her privacy ?",
    "recently , it was theoretically shown that such a secure cloud quantum computing is indeed possible  @xcite .",

    "she sends these states to bob , the server , who has the full quantum technology .",

    "generation of single qubit states is ubiquitous in today s laboratories , and therefore not too much burden for the client . in other words ,",
    " almost classical \" client can enjoy secure cloud quantum computing .",
    "however , is nt it possible to realize secure cloud quantum computing for a completely classical client ( fig .  [ classical ] ) ?",
    "many variant protocols of secure cloud quantum computing have been proposed recently  @xcite .",
    "for example , it was shown that , in stead of single - qubit states , the client has only to generate weak coherent pulse states if we add more burden to the server  @xcite .",
    "coherent states are considered as  more classical \" than single - photon states , and therefore it enables secure cloud quantum computing for  more classical \" client .",
    "it was also shown that secure cloud quantum computing is possible for a client who can only measure states  @xcite ( fig .",
    "[ measuringalice ] ) .",
    "a measurement of a bulk state with a threshold detector is sometimes much easier than the single - photon generation , and therefore the protocol also enables  more classical \" client .",
    "however , these two protocols still require the client to have some minimum quantum technologies , namely the generation of weak coherent pulses or measurements of quantum states .",
    "in fact , all protocols proposed so far require the client to have some quantum ability , such as generation , measurement , or routing of quantum states  @xcite .",
    "( it is known that  @xcite if we have two quantum servers , a completely classical client can delegate her quantum computing . however , in this case , we have to assume that two servers can not communicate with each other . ) in other words , the possibility of the perfectly secure cloud quantum computing for a completely classical client has been an open problem .            in this paper , we show that perfectly - secure cloud quantum computing for a completely classical client is unlikely possible . here , the perfect security means that an encrypted text gives no information about the plain text  @xcite .",
    "it is a typical security notion in the information theoretical security .",
    "the idea of the proof is as follows . since no non - affine cryptography is known to be perfectly secure  @xcite",
    ", we assume that the client uses an affine cryptography . we then show that if the cloud quantum computing can be done in the perfectly secure way for a completely classical client , classical computing can efficiently simulate quantum computing . although the conjecture of @xmath0 is not so solid as @xmath1 or that the polynomial hierarchy does not collapse , researchers in quantum computing believe @xmath0 .",
    "therefore , we conclude that perfectly - secure cloud quantum computing is impossible for a completely classical client ( unless a non - affine cryptography is shown to be perfectly secure or classical computing can efficiently simulate quantum computing ) .",
    "our setup is given in fig .",
    "[ classical ] .",
    "alice has only a classical computer ( more precisely , the probabilistic polynomial time turing machine ) , whereas bob has a universal quantum computer .",
    "furthermore , alice and bob share a two - way classical channel .",
    "let @xmath2 be the @xmath3-qubit unitary operator that alice wants to implement in her quantum computing , where @xmath3 is a polynomial of the size of the input of her problem .",
    "( more precisely , she choses a unitary from the finite set @xmath4 of unitaries , since the capacity of the classical channel between alice and bob is finite , and a set of finite unitaries is sufficient for universal quantum computing . ) without loss of generality , we can assume that the initial state of her quantum computing is the standard state @xmath5 .",
    "in other words , if she wants to start with a certain input state @xmath6 , the preparation of it is included in @xmath2 .",
    "( in the secure cloud quantum computing protocol of ref .",
    "@xcite , alice can use unknown quantum state as the input , such as a given state from another person .",

    "therefore , what alice wants to hide from bob are the classical description @xmath7 $ ] of the unitary @xmath2 , and the output of the computation , which is the computational basis measurement result on @xmath8 .",
    "( the protocol of ref .",
    "@xcite allows alice to finally obtain an output quantum state .",

    "[ classical ] , what alice and bob can do is the following protocol .    *",
    "alice sends bob the classical message @xmath9,k)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] that encrypts the classical description @xmath7 $ ] of the unitary @xmath2 with the private key @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the set of keys and @xmath12 is an encrypting operation . since the encryption is done by alice , we assume that the key generation and the encrypting operation @xmath12 can be done with a classical computer in @xmath13 time .",
    "we also assume that the encryption operation @xmath12 is an affine one .",

    "the value @xmath20 is the desired result of her quantum computing , i.e. , the result of the measurement on @xmath8 .",
    "now we show that if the above protocol can be done in the secure way , classical computing can efficiently simulate quantum computing by using a similar argument of ref .",
    "@xcite . here",
    ", secure means the perfect security , i.e. , bob can not gain any information from @xmath14 about the classical description @xmath7 $ ] of the unitary @xmath2 ( except for some necessarily leaking information such as the maximum size of @xmath7 $ ] , etc . ) .",

    "this means that bob can gain some information about alice s unitary , which contradicts to the assumption of the perfect security  @xcite .",

    "this means that classical computing can efficiently simulate quantum computing .",
    "therefore , if the above protocol can be done in the perfect secure way , classical computing can efficiently simulate quantum computing , which shows our claim .",
    "in this paper , we have shown that perfectly - secure cloud quantum computing is impossible for a completely classical client unless a non - affine cryptography is shown to be perfectly secure or classical computing can efficiently simulate quantum computing .    we think a majority of researchers in quantum information believe quantum computing is more powerful than classical computing . furthermore",
    ", if classical computing could efficiently simulate quantum computing , a classical client can achieve perfectly secure cloud quantum computing in the following trivial way , and therefore our question , namely the possibility of the perfect - secure cloud quantum computing for a classical client , is trivialized .    * the client encrypts a message which contains information about client s desired quantum computation , and sends it to the server via the classical channel . *",

    "our result therefore does not exclude the possibility that in a future a perfectly - secure non - affine cryptography is found , and the non - affine cryptography enables perfectly - secure cloud quantum computing for a completely classical client in some clever way",
    ".    we also note that if we relax the requirement of the perfect security , there might be several possibilities of secure cloud quantum computing for a classical client .",
