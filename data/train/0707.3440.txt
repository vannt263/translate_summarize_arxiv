    "a similar method can be used to identify nonstellar emission at @xmath48 m .",
    "no pah emission lines are present at such short wavelengths , so the nonstellar emission sources are direct radiation from the agn and hot dust only . making an assumption about the form of the nonstellar emission , this technique can be used to quantitatively estimate the emission from stars and the assumed nonstellar source at 3.6 and @xmath48 m .",

    ".    the cnm - like pah ratios of aperture  18 suggest that radiation from the agn may be absorbed within a few hundred parsecs along the ne ionization cone .",
    "the radio jet of @xcite ends abruptly near the same location .",
    "however , optical line ratios also show that radiation from the agn is ionizing gas up to 11  kpc from the nucleus within the ne cone @xcite .    although the @xmath1 m mips data are saturated ( @xmath89 , 900  pc ) , the innermost available isophotes are elongated along the same ne - sw axis corresponding to the arcs seen at other wavelengths ( fig .",
    "[ n1068i4m1 ] ) .",
    "in addition to the pah knots , a weaker feature is visible in both the irac and mips  @xmath1 m images , corresponding to the ne tip of the southern arm of the inner spiral ( @xmath90 from the nucleus at @xmath91 ) .",
    "two additional peaks are seen @xmath92 ( 3  kpc ) to the sw of the nucleus at @xmath93 .",
    "the nonstellar emission map ( fig .  [ n1068ns ] ) shows that hot dust is present in these locations .",
    "the subtraction of the nuclear psf ( right panel ) suggests that there is little hot dust emission in the inner @xmath94 outside of the nucleus ; widespread heating of dust to @xmath95  k can be ruled out .",
    "it is curious that every peak of ir emission in the disk of ngc  1068 , including the three such locations on the inner spiral as defined by the @xcite co map , lie within the ionization cones of the agn .",
    "the radio continuum emission @xcite comes to an abrupt end at a distance of 500700  pc from the nucleus , roughly halfway to the inner spiral , as shown in fig .",
    "[ n1068radioco ] .",
    "the 8  @xmath96 m knots on the inner spiral lie @xmath97 ( 300  pc ) farther along the radio axis .",
    "@xcite found that the high velocity nuclear outflow ends abruptly at the ne radio lobe and the sw radio hotspot ( @xmath98 from the nucleus ) .",
    "the co observations of @xcite ( fig .",
    "[ n1068radioco ] ) show a coherent spiral structure .",
    "the @xmath0 m emission peaks coincide with regions of bright co emission , though the converse is not true .",
    "the two brightest pah knots are seen at precisely the locations where the radio jet axis intersects the inner spiral ( fig .",
    "[ n1068radioco ] ) . the 200500  pc distance between the ends of the radio jets and the inner spiral",
    "indicate that the agn is unlikely to trigger shock - induced star formation , however .",
    "the optical emission line imaging of @xcite provides important insight into the origin of the observed pah knots .",
    "the pah knots coincide with strong h@xmath3 emission ( fig .",
    "[ n1068line ] , left panel ) and with small [ o  iii]/h@xmath5 ratios ( 0.21.7 ; fig .",
    "[ n1068line ] , right panel ) .",
    "the @xmath0 m and h@xmath3 images show strikingly similar morphologies , tracing active star forming regions across a wide range in wavelength .",
    "the [ o  iii]/h@xmath5 ratio is an indicator of mean ionization and temperature ; high ratios ( @xmath99 , as a rule of thumb ) are typical of agn , while lower ratios are typical of h  ii regions @xcite .",
    "as @xcite pointed out , high [ o  iii]/h@xmath5 ratios are seen out to @xmath100  kpc in ngc  1068 , most visibly in the ne ionization cone .",
    "figure  [ n1068line ] clearly shows that both the starburst knots and the three fainter ir emission peaks have optical line ratios indicative of star formation . although the h@xmath3 and [ o  iii]/h@xmath5 data confirm the conclusion of @xcite that the pah knots are due to star formation in those locations on the inner spiral , it is still surprising that bright pah emission should be present from regions that are being illuminated by ionizing radiation from the agn .",
    "while the galaxy disk is illuminated by the agn , it is unclear how opaque the pah emitting regions are to radiation from the agn ( e.g. see fig .",
    "[ galexfig ] , left panel ) .",
    "the galex data @xcite provide little guidance on this issue .",
    "figure  [ galexfig ] ( right panel ) is a galex fuv image of ngc  1068 shown with contours of both the spitzer 8@xmath96 m and psf - subtracted 24@xmath96 m emission overlaid .",
    "as is apparent in the figure , the regions showing strong pah and warm dust emission are clearly uv luminous , indicating that ( i ) the pah emitting regions are optically thin to uv photons and thus unshielded by the agn , that ( ii ) the uv emanates from the optically thin outer envelope of a much more embedded , optically thick starburst responsible for producing the observed pah emission , or ( iii ) that the uv emission is agn light scattered by optically thick clouds .",
    "the latter possibility is unlikely  a simple assumption of a 100  pc spherical cloud with an albedo of one would reflect a flux @xmath101 fainter than the flux of the agn . comparing measurements within 6\"(galex fwhm )",
    "radius apertures centered on the nucleus and on each pah knot , the galex data show that the pah knots are @xmath102% as bright as the nucleus in the fuv and therefore scattering from the agn is unlikely to be a significant contribution .",
    "thus , the uv emission is associated with stars , but can not be used to rule out whether the pah regions are shielded from the agn .",
    "further interpretation is complicated by the near - coincidence between the axis of the agn jet and the position angle of the inner stellar bar .",
    "intense star formation is common at the ends of a bar @xcite , so the agn may have no effect on the pah knots at all .",
    "it is also possible that the agn is either triggering increased star formation or directly exciting pah emission .",
    "either the high energy photons capable of destroying pahs are absorbed near the agn while lower energy photons are unobstructed over the entire @xmath103  kpc of the illuminated disk , or the high energy photon flux within 1  kpc produces a pah destruction rate less than or equal to the pah formation rate in the star - forming regions . for details on the parameters governing the formation and destruction of pah molecules ,",
    "see @xcite .",
    "the radiative transfer model of @xcite supports the latter hypothesis , finding that even in the optically thin regime pahs survive exposure to a @xmath104 agn at distances of 100  pc or more .",
    "however , @xcite calculated that pahs could only survive direct exposure to a @xmath105 agn at distances @xmath106  kpc .",
    "we have investigated the influence of the agn on pah emission in ngc  1068 , a lirg with a seyfert 2 nucleus .",
    "bright pah knots are detected in the inner spiral in ngc  1068 .",
    "these knots lie directly along the axis of the ionization cone , which extends well beyond the inner spiral in the disk of the galaxy",
    ". the knots also coincide with the ends of the inner stellar bar .",
    "contrary to the model of @xcite , the spectra and colors of the pah knots are consistent with starlight and pah emission , with very little if any hot dust .",
    "three other star forming regions are also detected : the ne tip of the southern arm of the inner spiral , and two regions 2.53  kpc to the sw .",
    "all three regions lie within the agn ionization cones and show pah emission at @xmath0 m and a slight excess of @xmath48 m emission relative to starlight , suggesting dust heated by young stars .",
    "irs spectra near the pah knots indicate that pahs are the dominant energy source , and show that pah emission is present within a few hundred parsecs of the agn .",
    "pah line ratios on the inner spiral are generally consistent with a cool , neutral ism , while pah line ratios interior to the inner spiral generally indicate a more ionized medium .",
    "these data show that the agn is not destroying all pah molecules within the ionization cone .",
    "the enhanced pah emission within the ionization cones indicates that the agn is either triggering increased star formation , directly exciting the pahs , or has no effect on the dust properties in the ionization cones .",

    "<S> the irac colors and irs spectra of these regions rule out dust heated by the agn as the primary emission source ; the seds are dominated by starlight and pah emission . the equivalent widths and flux ratios of the pah features in the inner spiral </S>",
    "<S> are generally consistent with conditions in a typical spiral galaxy ism . </S>",
    "<S> interior to the inner spiral , the influence of the agn on the ism is evident via pah flux ratios indicative of a higher ionization parameter and a significantly smaller mean equivalent width than observed in the inner spiral . </S>",
    "<S> the brightest 8 and @xmath1 m emission peaks in the disk of the galaxy , even at distances beyond the inner spiral , are located within the ionization cones traced by [ o iii]/h@xmath5 , and they are also remarkably well aligned with the axis of the radio jets . although it is possible that radiation from the agn may directly enhance pah excitation or trigger the formation of ob stars that subsequently excite pah emission at these locations in the inner spiral , the orientation of collimated radiation from the agn and star formation knots in the inner spiral could be coincidental . </S>",
    "<S> the brightest pah and @xmath1 m emitting regions are also located precisely where two spiral arms of molecular gas emerge from the ends of the inner stellar bar ; this is consistent with kinematic models that predict maxima in the accumulation and compression of the ism where gas gets trapped within the inner lindblad resonance of a large stellar bar that contains a smaller , weaker bar . </S>"
