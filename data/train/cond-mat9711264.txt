    "recently there has been a renewed interest in the finite temperature dynamics of the one dimensional spin 1/2 heisenberg model , especially on the question of diffusive spin transport@xcite . in particular",
    ", it was argued that the integrability of the model implies pathological spin dynamics and presumably the absence of spin diffusion@xcite .",
    "the role of conservation laws was pointed out in reference@xcite were it was shown that in several quantum integrable models the uniform ( @xmath0 ) current correlations do not decay to zero at long times .",
    "this result , established using the mazur inequality@xcite , suggests pathological finite temperature dynamics .",
    "as far as the heisenberg model is concerned , the analysis of conservation laws has shown that the energy current operator commutes with the hamiltonian , suggesting anomalous finite-(@xmath1 ) energy density correlations . however , for zero magnetic field , this method turned out to be insufficient for deciding about the decay of the uniform spin current correlations . this case",
    "is closely related to the behavior of the finite temperature conductivity in the one dimensional model of spinless fermions at half - filling interacting with a nearest neighbor interaction ( the  t - v \" model@xcite ) .    in this work ,",
    "we address the issues raised above by the numerical diagonalization of the hamiltonian matrix on finite size lattices .",
    "more precisely , we study the implications of the energy current conservation on the ( @xmath1 ) energy density correlations , and , as an alternative route to the analysis of spin diffusion , we investigate the decay of the uniform ( @xmath0 ) spin current correlations .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section 2 , we recall the heisenberg hamiltonian and define the various quantities studied below . in section 3",
    "we briefly summarize the phenomenological picture of diffusion .",
    "there , we also argue that the decay of the uniform spin current correlations to a finite value is incompatible with a diffusive behavior , _ assuming _ continuity in the wave - vector @xmath2 of the correlations at @xmath0 .",
    "next , we test these ideas in section 4 in the xy limit , where results can be obtained analytically .",
    "turning to the numerical results , in section 5.1 we present the energy density correlations at infinite temperature for the case of the isotropic heisenberg model .",
    "a simple ansatz for the observed behavior suggests a logarithmic dependence at low frequencies for the energy autocorrelation function .",
    "as far as the spin dynamics is concerned , numerous studies of the @xmath3 spin density correlations exist@xcite . therefore , in section 5.2 , we restrict ourselves to the decay of the uniform spin current correlations for various values of the anisotropy parameter @xmath4 and temperatures",
    "interestingly , it turns out that these do not decay to zero for @xmath5 . according to the argument given in section 3 , this result implies non - diffusive spin transport .",
    "section 6 contains a short discussion on experimental relevance of these findings and open questions .",
    "the anisotropic heisenberg hamiltonian for a chain of @xmath6 sites with periodic boundary conditions is given by : @xmath7 where @xmath8 , @xmath9 are the pauli spin operators with components @xmath10 at site @xmath11 .    for a conserved quantity @xmath12 , @xmath13=0 $ ] ,",
    "the continuity equation in @xmath14space defines the current @xmath15 :    @xmath16    with @xmath17 and @xmath18 .    setting @xmath19 we find the following spin and energy currents respectively : @xmath20 @xmath21 for the discussion of dynamic correlations at finite temperatures , we chose to analyze the anticommutator form : @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the thermal average at temperature @xmath24 over a complete set of states .",
    "further , the frequency dependent correlation function defined by : @xmath25 is symmetric in frequency , @xmath26 .",
    "a central point in our approach is the relation between the dynamic correlations of a quantity a and its corresponding current correlations , which we obtain by using the continuity equation ( [ ce ] ) : @xmath27    in particular , we will discuss the asymptotic value of the current correlations @xmath28    a finite value of @xmath29 translates to a @xmath30 peak in @xmath31 and , as we will discuss below , implies restrictions in the behavior of @xmath32 .",
    "an important observation is that the energy current @xmath33 of the heisenberg model commutes with the hamiltonian@xcite , so that @xmath34 , whereas the spin current does not .",
    "however , it will turn out that @xmath35 for @xmath5 , meaning that the spin current and energy current correlations are similar in the sense that in their frequency representation , they both exhibit a finite weight @xmath30 function .",
    "when we consider the @xmath3-dependent correlations of a conserved quantity @xmath36 such as the magnetization , it is usually assumed , largely on phenomenological grounds , that they exhibit a diffusive behavior in the long - time @xmath37 , short wavelength @xmath38 regime@xcite : @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the corresponding diffusion constant , or @xmath41 for @xmath42 .",
    "this lorentzian form correctly reduces to a @xmath30 function in the limit @xmath38 , as implied by @xmath13=0 $ ] .",
    "further , using the continuity equation ( [ cs ] ) for @xmath38 , we obtain : @xmath43 which gives the diffusion constant @xmath40 when first , the limit @xmath38 and then , @xmath44 are taken . on the other hand , if the current correlations for @xmath0 do not decay to zero at long times , @xmath45 and @xmath46 has a finite weight @xmath30 component which is incompatible with the diffusive form ( [ djbqo ] ) . in this reasoning , we must assume a regular behavior of the correlation functions in the @xmath2 variable .    to summarize the argument ,",
    "if a quantity @xmath36 is conserved ( @xmath13=0 $ ] ) and its current @xmath47 is either conserved ( @xmath48=0 $ ] ) , or @xmath45 , then continuity in @xmath2 at @xmath0 excludes a diffusive form ( [ db ] ) for the corresponding correlation @xmath49 .",
    "a simple model for testing these ideas is the @xmath50 limit ( @xmath51 ) , of the heisenberg model . in this case , both the energy current @xmath33 and the spin current @xmath52 commute with the hamiltonian .",
    "the model can be mapped to a free spinless fermion model by using a jordan - wigner transformation which allows us also to evaluate explicitly the spin and energy dynamic correlations at @xmath53 . in the spin case , these are well known results@xcite : @xmath54 @xmath55 these forms are indeed consistent with the conservation of both spin ( energy ) and spin current ( energy current ) as they reduce to a @xmath30 function when the limits @xmath38 , @xmath44 are taken .",
    "further , the time decay of the autocorrelations at @xmath53 is not of the form @xmath56 , as predicted by the diffusion hypothesis .",
    "indeed , @xmath57 @xmath58 which both behave as @xmath59 for @xmath60 .",
    "as we mentioned earlier , the energy current @xmath33 associated with the anisotropic heisenberg model ( [ heis ] ) commutes with the hamiltonian for all values of the parameter @xmath4 .",
    "therefore , the time correlations do not decay at all ( @xmath34 ) and according to the argument explained in section 3 , no diffusive energy transport occurs .",
    "however , the conservation of @xmath33 does not provide us with any details about the shape of @xmath61 at finite @xmath2 . in the absence of an analytical solution",
    ", we investigate this quantity by numerical diagonalization of the hamiltonian matrix on a ring of 16 sites .    in figure 1",
    ", we show @xmath61 for @xmath62 , which is experimenally the most interesting point as it describes isotropic quasi one - dimensional antiferromagnets .",
    "we study the high temperature limit @xmath53 , which is the most convenient for a numerical study as it involves the full excitation spectrum , but is also relevant experimentally for spin systems as the magnitude of @xmath63 can be of the order of @xmath64 .",
    "the plot is represented as histograms of width @xmath65 , all the frequencies which fall into one interval are summed up .",
    "the inset shows the normalized , integrated ( prior to summing nearby frequencies ) quantity @xmath66 which has the advantage of smoothing out the finite size discontinuities . to point out the practically linear integrated behavior of the pure heisenberg model",
    ", we also show the same quantity for a more generic case obtained by adding a next - next neighbor ( non - integrable ) interaction @xmath67 .    the simplest way to describe this behavior is by means of  plateaus \" given by the following ansatz : @xmath68 which satisfy the first @xmath69 and the second @xmath70 exact moments for @xmath53 .",
    "further , this ansatz is compatible with the limit @xmath71 as implied by the conservation of energy . using the continuity equation ( [ cs ] )",
    ", we obtain for small @xmath2 and @xmath72 @xmath73 which correctly reduces to a @xmath30-function for @xmath38 , in agreement with the conservation of the energy current @xmath74=0 $ ] .    using this ansatz we find for the energy autocorrelation function ( obtained by integration over @xmath2 ) : @xmath75 a logarithmic behavior at low frequencies , in contrast to the diffusion form @xmath76 .",
    "we should stress that these results are only _ indicative _ , as they are obtained from small size lattices which can provide reliable information only for correspondingly high frequencies and large wave - vectors .",
    "nevertheless , the consistency of these results with the arguments presented above against a diffusion form are encouraging .      the spin density dynamic correlations @xmath77 have been the subject of many studies which have not been able to answer the question of spin diffusion unambiguously . here",
    ", we revisit this problem by investigating the compatibility between spin density and spin current correlations , which requires that we calculate @xmath78 .",
    "in contrast to the energy current , the spin current @xmath52 does not commute with the hamiltonian , so that @xmath79 is different from a pure @xmath30 function . nevertheless , if @xmath80 , which means that @xmath79 has a finite weight @xmath81function at @xmath82 , our previous arguments against diffusion still hold .    in determining @xmath78 , we noticed a peculiar difference in the low frequency behavior of @xmath79 depending on the anisotropy parameter @xmath4 . in figure 2 , we show @xmath83 the corresponding integrated , normalized quantity .",
    "we see that for @xmath84 , @xmath85 ( @xmath86 in the figure ) all the low frequency weight of @xmath79 is concentrated in the @xmath87-function at @xmath82 .",
    "in contrast , for neighboring values such as @xmath88 or @xmath89 , we observe a shift of weight to a low frequency region whose size decreases as the system grows ( inset ) and eventually vanishes as @xmath90 .",
    "we believe that the behavior of this special @xmath4 points is related to the existence of finite length strings ( bound states ) as they appear in the formulation of the thermodynamics of the heisenberg model , within the bethe ansatz method@xcite .",
    "it seems that in order to determine @xmath78 from finite size systems for @xmath91 , we should include the weight from these low frequency regions . as an example",
    ", doing so for @xmath88 gives us a value of @xmath92 for l=16 ( figure 2 ) .",
    "having discussed this technical issue , we can then determine @xmath78 for different size systems , as a function of temperature and @xmath4 . by extrapolating our finite size results to the thermodynamic limit using second order polynomials in @xmath93 for @xmath94",
    ", we obtain the results shown in figure 3 .",
    "their striking feature is that for @xmath95 , @xmath78 is finite in the @xmath5 region , and practically zero when @xmath96 . in this regime , according to our previous argument , we expect a non- diffusive behavior .",
    "deciding about the behavior of @xmath78 for @xmath96 at finite temperatures is rather subtle .",
    "the reason is that in the heisenberg model , @xmath62 corresponds to a point of change of symmetry , from easy plane to easy axis , accompanied by the opening of a gap . in the fermionic version of the model , the  t - v \" model",
    ", it corresponds to a metal - insulator mott - hubbard type transition , with the charge stiffness changing discontinuously@xcite at zero temperature .",
    "we should note that this discontinuity is difficult to reproduce by numerical simulations on small finite size lattices , as the transition corresponds to the divergence of the localization length .",
    "considering that at high temperature , @xmath78 behaves similarly to the charge stiffness in the  t - v \" model@xcite we understand why it is difficult to decide whether @xmath78 is greater than zero in the region @xmath97 and @xmath98 .",
    "for the same reason , we can not exclude that @xmath78 behaves discontinuously at @xmath62 .",
    "nevertheless , it seems unambiguous that @xmath99 for @xmath100 and @xmath95 .",
    "the results presented are of interest in recent experimental studies@xcite of spin dynamics in quasi - one dimensional materials such as @xmath101 and @xmath102 .",
    "particular attention should be paid to the unusually high value of the diffusion constant found in nmr experiments on @xmath102@xcite , perhaps related to the integrability of the heisenberg model as discussed above .",
    "furthermore , our results on the behavior of energy density correlations are of interest in the interpretation of the quasi - elastic raman scattering , related to magnetic energy fluctuations@xcite .",
    "we should emphasize that no diffusion form should be expected for the energy density correlations in the isotropic heisenberg model with only nearest neighbor interaction .",
    "an eventual diffusive behavior should be attributed to next - nearest neighbor coupling , interaction with phonons or deviations from one dimensionality . finally , the main unresolved issue in this work is a better understanding of the finite temperature spin dynamics at the isotropic point .",
