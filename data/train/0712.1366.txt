    "the study of polynomials orthogonal over a closed rectifiable curve of the complex plane was initiated by szeg in @xcite , and later continued by szeg himself and such authors as smirnov , keldysh , lavrentiev , korovkin , suetin and geronimous ( see @xcite for references and an overview of the developments until 1964 ) .",
    "polynomials orthogonal over several arcs and curves have also been studied , for instance ( and without being exhaustive ) , by akhiezer @xcite , @xcite , widom @xcite , aptekarev @xcite , peherstorfer and coauthors @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and for an orthogonality measure with finitely many point masses outside the curve / arc , by kaliaguine @xcite , @xcite .    among the central questions that are often investigated",
    "figure the asymptotic behavior of the orthogonal polynomials and the distribution and location of their zeros . in this regard ,",
    "the case of a closed curve has the peculiarity ( not observed in that of an open arc ) that the interior of its polynomial convex hull is non - empty , giving more freedom of distribution to the zeros of the polynomials , and consequently , making the behavior of the polynomials themselves much less clear .",
    "the results of the present work clarify this question to a substantial extent for a single closed curve under analyticity conditions .",
    "let @xmath1 be an analytic jordan curve in the complex plane @xmath2 and let @xmath3 be an analytic function in a neighborhood of @xmath1 such that @xmath4 for all @xmath5 . using the gram - schmidt orthogonalization process",
    ", we can form a unique sequence @xmath6 of orthonormal polynomials over @xmath1 with respect to @xmath3 , i.e. , satisfying @xmath7 @xmath8    in what follows , we are concerned with the asymptotic behavior of these polynomials as their degree @xmath9 becomes large . with this generality ,",
    "essentially the only known result is szeg s strong asymptotic formula @xmath10^n\\left[1+o(1)\\right].\\ ] ]    here @xmath11 is the conformal map of the exterior @xmath12 of @xmath1 onto the exterior of the unit circle satisfying that @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 is the so - called exterior szeg function for the weight @xmath16 , and ( [ eq20 ] ) holds locally uniformly as @xmath17 on any open set @xmath18 that is conformally mapped by @xmath11 onto the exterior of a circle about the origin of radius @xmath19 , and is such that @xmath15 is analytic on @xmath20 ( see next subsection for details ) .    for @xmath21",

    "so far as this writer can learn , progress in understanding the asymptotic behavior of @xmath22 at the remaining points of the complex plane , that is , for @xmath23 , has only been made in the specific case of @xmath1 being the unit circle , the strongest result having being obtained recently in @xcite . here",
    "the authors use the riemann - hilbert approach for the asymptotic analysis of orthogonal polynomials to derive , for each @xmath22 of sufficiently large degree , a series expansion in terms of certain recursively generated cauchy transforms .",
    "this important result yields at once szeg s asymptotic formula and an integral representation for @xmath22 inside the unit circle , from which it is possible to distill the precise behavior of the polynomials under additional assumptions on the first singularities encountered by the exterior szeg function . this has been done in @xcite for finitely many polar singularities , as well as for two examples of an isolated essential singularity .",
    "earlier related works ( e.g. , @xcite ) are briefly described in the introduction of @xcite .    in the present paper",
    "we extend the expansion of @xcite to an arbitrary analytic curve . our proof is not based on the riemann - hilbert method , it is rather direct and in some sense natural , which we believe will lead to applications to other systems of orthogonal polynomials . from the dominant term of the expansion",
    "we derive precise asymptotic formulas for @xmath22 in a case where the exterior szeg function has finitely many algebraic singularities in a thin neighborhood of @xmath1 .",
    "we state our results in subsections [ sub2 ] and [ sub3 ] below , followed by their proofs in section [ sec2 ] .      in this subsection",
    "we introduce some notation to be used throughout , as well as the concepts involved in the asymptotic behavior of @xmath24 . in particular , we discuss the szeg functions associated with the weight @xmath16 . for a deeper discussion of these functions",
