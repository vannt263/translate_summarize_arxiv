    "three - dimensional ( 3d ) fermi systems in which valence and conduction bands touch quadratically at the fermi level form the very boundary between two classes of materials : right at the fermi level their density of states vanishes and the systems can hence be understood as limiting cases of semiconductors in which the band gap goes to zero . away from the fermi level , on the other hand , the density of states increases rapidly , and the systems may alternatively be regarded as degenerate semimetals with the band overlap region shrunk to a single point .",
    "prominent examples for such three - dimensional _ gapless semiconductors _ are given by @xmath0-sn and hgte , which feature band inversion due to spin - orbit coupling .",
    "the quadratic band touching ( qbt ) point , located at the center @xmath9 of the brillouin zone , is protected by crystal symmetry , and in the undoped systems the fermi level is right at the touching point  @xcite . when the rotational symmetry is broken , the band degeneracy at the @xmath9 point can be lifted and the spectrum develops a full , anisotropic , and topologically nontrivial gap  @xcite .",
    "hgte , for instance , shows the quantum spin hall effect in quantum well structures  @xcite and becomes a 3d strong topological insulator under uniaxial strain  @xcite .",
    "the pyrochlore iridates @xmath10ir@xmath1o@xmath2 ( where @xmath11 is a rare - earth element ) that display a metallic paramagnetic state presumably also host a 3d qbt point at the fermi level  @xcite .",
    "this scenario has been employed to explain the anomalous low - temperature behavior measured in pr@xmath1ir@xmath1o@xmath2  @xcite .    the dichotomous classification of gapless semiconductors is reflected in their concomitant peculiar _",
    "screening , which allows fundamentally new types of many - body ground states .",
    "theoretical control over the situation can be exerted by employing a @xmath5 expansion , where @xmath12 is the number of qbt points at the fermi level . in the limit of large @xmath12 , abrikosov and beneslavskii found a scale - invariant semimetallic ground state with anomalous power laws  a 3d non - fermi - liquid phase  @xcite .",
    "recently , their analysis has been rediscovered and extended in the context of the pyrochlore iridates  @xcite .    in this work ,",
    "we revisit the problem of the ground state of 3d fermi systems with qbt by deriving and exploiting the nonperturbative solution of the dyson - schwinger equations .",
    "although also controlled by the small parameter @xmath5 , this enables one to address questions such as spontaneous symmetry breaking and dynamical mass generation .",
    "we demonstrate that the abrikosov - beneslavskii large-@xmath12 regime exhibits a lower bound @xmath3 below which the non - fermi - liquid state becomes unstable and the system features a symmetry - breaking phase transition .",
    "the value for @xmath3 is found to be _ above _ the physical @xmath8 , rendering the 3d systems with qbt insulating and nematic at low temperatures .",
    "while such a possibility has been suggested earlier by considering the theory in higher spatial dimensions @xmath13",
    "@xcite , so far there has not been a definite demonstration of the instability within a fully controlled approximation .",
    "conceptually , our scenario is analogous to the well - known situation in ( 2 + 1)-dimensional quantum electrodynamics ( qed@xmath14 ) , which displays chiral symmetry breaking if the number of fermions is less than a certain critical fermion number  @xcite .",
    "the principal difference is , however , the lack of relativistic invariance at low energies , which makes the effects of dynamical screening both crucial and nontrivial to include .",
    "we show , nevertheless , that the critical number of four - component fermions @xmath3 is , to the leading order of the @xmath5 expansion , bounded from below by @xmath15 , and thus is significantly larger than the relevant physical value of @xmath8 .",
    "the @xmath12-dependent excitonic transition can be understood heuristically within a simple semiclassical picture . at the fermi level",
    ", the point of qbt separates the filled valence electron band from the unoccupied conduction band .",
    "virtual or thermal fluctuations can induce electron - hole pairs , which interact via an attractive screened coulomb potential @xmath16 . in the simplest approach ,",
    "the latter is determined by the density of states  @xmath17 near the fermi level  @xcite , @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the elementary charge and @xmath20 is the `` background '' dielectric constant arising from transitions between bands away from the fermi level  @xcite . when the band dispersion is quadratic , @xmath21 , the density of states vanishes linearly as a function of momentum , @xmath22 , with @xmath12 the number of qbt points at the fermi level . at large distances ,",
    "the form of the potential thus becomes @xmath23 in fourier space or , equivalently , @xmath24 in real space .",
    "the coulomb interaction is _ marginally _ screened , in clear contrast to both metallic and dielectric screening . whether or not an electron - hole pair can form an excitonic quasiparticle is determined by the spectrum of the corresponding @xmath25-wave schrdinger equation for the radial `` exciton wave function ''  @xmath26 , @xmath27 \\psi_\\text{exc}(r )   = 2 m e \\psi_\\text{exc}(r),\\ ] ] where @xmath28 is the effective band mass",
    ", @xmath0 is a dimensionless constant , and we have set @xmath29 .",
    "an exciton bound state would be given by the solution of eq .   with energy eigenvalue @xmath30 .",
    "the quantum mechanical hamiltonian with @xmath31 potential is formally invariant under the scale transformation @xmath32 , @xmath33 .",
    "a discrete bound - state spectrum would inevitably break the scale invariance , and one therefore might expect the spectrum to possess scattering states only .",
    "this naive expectation , however , is correct only for weak interaction , when the dimensionless parameter @xmath34  @xcite . in this case ,",
    "no exciton formation is possible , and the 3d qbt system becomes scale invariant at large distances .",
    "this is the abrikosov - beneslavskii non - fermi - liquid state  @xcite . for @xmath35 ,",
    "on the other hand , the hamiltonian needs to be regularized at short distances and _ does _ admit bound states , with energy eigenvalues @xmath30 that depend on the regularization  @xcite .",
    "this peculiarity of the quantum mechanics of the attractive @xmath31 potential can be interpreted as possibly the simplest realization of a quantum anomaly  @xcite . in our system , screening is suppressed at short distances , which naturally regularizes the potential and prevents the electron - hole pair from `` collapsing ''  @xcite . for small values of @xmath12 ,",
    "exciton formation is thus possible and in fact favored energetically .",
    "the critical number of fermions that separates the scale - invariant non - fermi - liquid phase at large @xmath12 from the excitonic insulating phase at small @xmath12 would in this approximation be given by @xmath36 .    in what follows we use the field - theoretical machinery to demonstrate that the above picture is qualitatively entirely correct .",
    "in particular , we will find that the system can be described by a differential equation formally identical to eq .",
    ", with a value for @xmath0 that leads to @xmath37 .",
    "the minimal low - energy hamiltonian relevant for semiconductors with diamond or zincblende crystal structure is given by the luttinger hamiltonian  @xcite @xmath38,\\ ] ] with @xmath39 as the ( @xmath40 ) @xmath41 representation of the angular momentum algebra , @xmath42  the phenomenological luttinger parameters , and where we assumed spherical symmetry .",
    "the spectrum then is @xmath43 , and @xmath44 describes a qbt point if @xmath45 . for large @xmath12 , both spherical as well as particle - hole symmetry are in fact expected to be _ emergent _ at low energies  @xcite , and for simplicity we therefore also set @xmath46 in the following . while the assumption of spherical symmetry appears to be a valid description of hgte and @xmath0-sn  @xcite , we should note that strong correlations in the pyrochlore iridates may induce significant anisotropies  @xcite . for a quantitative description of the latter systems it may therefore be necessary to go beyond our simple rotationally and particle - hole symmetric model .",
    "this is left for future work .",
    "the hamiltonian can then be written as  @xcite @xmath47 where @xmath48 are the five real spherical harmonics for the angular momentum of two , viz . ,",
    "@xmath49 , @xmath50 , and @xmath51 , with @xmath52 and @xmath53 as the spherical angles in momentum space .",
    "the hermitian @xmath54 dirac matrices @xmath55 satisfy the clifford algebra @xmath56 . for convenience , in eq .   we have also set the remaining effective band mass to @xmath57 .",
    "we are interested in the effects of the long - range coulomb interaction , which is mediated by a scalar field  @xmath58 , and described by the euclidian bare action @xmath59.\\ ] ] @xmath60 and @xmath61 are four - component fermion fields , and @xmath62 . upon integrating out @xmath58 in the functional integral",

    "an isotropic mass gap , that is usually energetically favored in systems with dirac fermions  @xcite and in two - dimensional qbt models  @xcite , is thus impossible in the ( isotropic ) 3d systems with qbt .",

    "and hereafter we adopt the summation convention over repeated indices .",
    "the vertex renormalization is also suppressed by  @xmath5 , @xmath72  @xcite . in qed@xmath14 ,",
    "higher - order calculations give corrections to @xmath3 of no more than 25%  @xcite , and it is therefore reasonable to expect the relevant physics in the present case also to be captured well already by the lowest - order calculation .",

    "essential singularity _",
