    "the idea of dark matter ( dm ) in the universe was first advanced in the 1930s , when  @xcite discussed the deviation of the masses of galaxy clusters away from expected values .",
    "the idea was subsequently confirmed in many different ways  ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the strong deviation of the rotation curves of spiral galaxies away from what would result from just the luminous matter , has given an important additional quantitative indication of the existence of dm .",
    "its presence in our galaxy was first discussed by  @xcite .",
    "the current estimate gives @xmath5  @xcite , which matches that by  @xcite .",
    "searches for non - luminous dm in the form of brown and white dwarfs , neutron stars and black holes , with masses above @xmath6 ( `` machos '' ) has shown that these objects are far too rare to make up a significant part of the total dm @xcite . within the past five years , it has even been shown by wmap that baryonic matter only makes up @xmath7 , of the critical density of the universe while dark matter makes up @xmath8  @xcite .",
    "while objects like neutron stars or white dwarfs are thereby excluded as making up a major proportion of the dm , black holes with masses between @xmath9 might still be responsible for a significant fraction , as explained in the next section .",
    "in certain models , these primordial black holes ( pbhs ) are predicted to be produced at an interesting level in early phases of the universe due to density fluctuations of the type also observed in the cosmic microwave background .",
    "their gravitational radius @xmath10 would be subatomic , @xmath11  cm .",
    "the bondi - hoyle accretion radius , on the other hand , can be significantly larger .",
    "+ in this paper , we check whether hypothetical pbh collisions with galactic objects may be observable . a detection of observational signatures of such collisions would support the hypothesis that pbhs may represent a significant fraction of the dm in the galaxy .",
    "we find that the pbh collisions discussed by  @xcite would produce no presently - observable signatures . to prove our case , we show that even with the most optimistic conditions assumed , hypothetical collisions of pbhs with galactic objects place no observational constraints in the pbh mass range @xmath12  g  @xmath13  @xmath14  g considered in this paper .",
    "the assumptions made are as follows :    * the mass distribution of pbhs is a delta - function , i.e.  all pbhs have the same mass .",
    "the mass is treated as a free parameter , and the whole range @xmath15  g  @xmath13  @xmath14  g is considered .",
    "any other distribution would significantly decrease the event rate : if we assume that all pbhs have the same mass and then consider this mass as a free parameter , we maximize the event rate for each single mass value , as we assume that 100% of the total mass is focused at one arbitrary value . for wider mass distributions , the total mass of the pbhs is less than 100% for a given mass value , which always reduces the event rate . * the entire energy from a single interaction",
    "is taken to be in the energy band of the potential detector . in reality",
    ", we expect the signal to be spread from radio wavelengths up to soft gamma - rays .",
    "using the entire radiated energy therefore gives an upper limit for detectability .",
    "* a single photon is sufficient for detecting the event . even for a background - free source , three photons",
    "are required for giving 90% confidence significance ( see @xcite ) and so with a more realistic estimate , the detection probability would be further reduced by a factor of between 3 and more than ten .",
    "* the signal is radiated at full opening angle , i.e.  @xmath16 .",
    "a more realistic estimate would include consideration of the shock opening angle , reducing the expected observation probability .",
    "* we assume that the signal is always strong enough that it can reach us over the entire thickness of the galactic disk , @xmath17  pc .",
    "further , we make a few assumptions that greatly simplifies calculations but could only slightly ( indeed insignificantly ) influence the final result :    * luminous matter is taken to be distributed uniformly in the galactic disk and dark matter is taken to have constant density in the spherical halo .",
    "we will show that the enhanced density in the galactic center yields slightly better results , but with the same conclusion that detection of the events can be neglected .",
    "* we use a delta - function for the distribution of relative velocity between the luminous and dark matter , @xmath18  cm / s .",
    "we will show in this paper that the reduced velocity at the central part of the galaxy does not influence our result . as for the possibility of a capture at low velocities ,",
    "we show in section [ added - section ] that this does not occur within the energy range being considered .",

    ", we need to ask the following questions :    1 .",
    "_ how frequent are the events ? _ 2 .",
    "_ how energetic is each single event ? _ 3 .",
    "_ what are the possible signatures ? _    in the following sections , we answer each question separately for the five most important object classes in the galaxy , i.e.  main sequence stars , red giants ( in particular their dense cores ) , white dwarfs and neutron stars .",
    "the main intrinsic properties of those objects are listed in table  [ object_properties ] together with their abundances in the galaxy . both the interaction probability and the energy loss strongly depend on the properties listed .",
    "also , we consider collisions with the earth , in order to investigate the claim that the tunguska event might have been caused in this way ( see @xcite ) .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section  [ pbh_constraints ] summarizes the already - existing observational constraints . in section",
    "[ estimation ] , interaction probabilities in the galaxy and energy loss of a single event are derived .",
    "possible signatures and the detectability of such events are investigated in section  [ signatures ] .",
    "section [ added - section ] discusses the possibility of capturing the pbh in a stellar object . finally ,",
    "section  [ conclusion ] summarizes the conclusions to be drawn from our calculations and discusses further possibilities for detection requiring additional assumptions .",
    "ever since the hypothesis of primordial black holes was first established  @xcite , different theoretical and observational constraints on their actual abundance in the universe have been discussed . while theoretical constraints are rather speculative and model dependent ( see e.g.  @xcite ) , the observational ones are far more robust .",
    "they firmly constrain the abundance of primordial black holes in two mass ranges . in this section ,",
    "we briefly review them .",
    "since we are interested in pbhs as a possible contributor to the dark matter , we only consider pbhs that can have survived until today , that is those with initial mass above @xmath19",
    "g.    there are three main methods of looking for indirect detection of primordial black holes above @xmath20  g. the first one aims for the detection of pbh evaporation .",
    "this method is sensitive to the lower mass limit of the initial mass function ( imf ) .",
    "this initial mass function is expressed in terms of the number of pbhs at their initial mass @xmath21 , as a function of the initial mass itself , @xmath22 . as predicted by  @xcite , and shortly afterwards also by  @xcite",
    ", black holes evaporate due to quantum fluctuations around the schwarzschild radius of the black hole , leading to the evaporation of pbhs with masses below @xmath20  g before the present time .",
    "therefore , non - detection of the high - energy photons which would be produced by black hole evaporation , i.e.  @xmath23  mev , leads to a robust constraint on the mass function around @xmath24  g. at @xmath24  g , egret observations between @xmath25  mev and @xmath26  mev imply that the pbh mass density must be smaller than @xmath27 times that of the total dark matter  @xcite . between @xmath28  g",
    ", constraints from egret measurements are still at a level of @xmath29 and provide significant constraints as well . at significantly higher mass scales , micro - lensing can help to restrict the abundance of pbhs , see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "@xcite looked for planetary mass dark matter via gravitational micro - lensing in the direction of the large magellanic cloud , resulting in constraints of up to 10% in the mass range @xmath1  g  @xmath30  g. at even higher mass scales , @xmath31  g  @xmath32  g , results from anisotropy and spectra measurements of the comic microwave background ( wmap-3years and cobe - firas ) can be used to constrain the number of pbhs @xcite .",
    "the excluded regions for the mass function are shown in fig .",
    "[ constraints ] .",
    "in addition , @xcite proposed using gamma ray bursts ( grbs ) to detect `` femto - lenses '' produced by dark matter objects in the mass range of @xmath33  g  @xmath34  g. this method has not yet been applied , however , and so no experimental limit has yet been set . a mass range of about ten orders of magnitude , @xmath24  g  @xmath3  g , then remains at present unexplored .    in the standard scenario of density perturbations in the early universe",
    ", the imf of pbhs , @xmath35 , behaves as , e.g.  @xcite @xmath36 and so most pbhs have masses at around the current evaporation level .",
    "the constraint by egret at the lower end of the mass scale therefore has significant consequences for the abundance of black holes at higher masses . + the above model for pbh production is not , however , the only one .",
    "several other proposed theories for pbh production predict significant contributions from pbhs at different mass scales .",
    "examples are the collapse of topological defects , softening of the equation of state and quantum gravity scenarios , which , although speculative , deserve to be tested ( see reviews by @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "in order to describe possible observational signatures of the hypothetical collisions of pbhs with stars in our galaxy , one must answer the two fundamental questions : _ how frequent are the collisions ? _ and _ how energetic is a single collision ? _ precise answers to these questions are obviously very difficult to obtain , as they depend on genuine astrophysical uncertainties that can not be resolved today . in the view of these uncertainties",
    ", we estimate the collision frequency and energetics using a very general and rather simple analytic toy model that adopts several simplifying assumptions .",
    "for example , we assume that all pbhs have the same mass @xmath37",
    ". we do not specify that value .",
    "instead , we consider @xmath37 to be one of a few free parameters of the model",
    ".    adopting ideas from the kinetic theory of gases , one may argue that a reasonable estimate of the collision frequency between stars and pbhs should depend only on the size @xmath38 of the region of interest ( e.g. either the whole galaxy , or its central bulge ) , numbers of stars @xmath39 and pbhs @xmath40 in this region , the relative velocity @xmath41 between stars and pbhs , and the collision cross section @xmath42 .",
    "similarly , a reasonable estimate of the collision energetics should depend only on the mass and radius of the star , @xmath43 , @xmath44 , mass of the black hole @xmath37 , and the relative velocity @xmath41 .",
    "the final results obtained this way fully justify the adopted strategy .",
    "they show that the hypothetical collisions would be far too infrequent , or far too energetically weak , to be detected .",
    "this holds _ in the whole range _ of @xmath37 and all other parameters of the model .",
    "the mismatch involves several orders of magnitude .",
    "thus , our conclusion that _ there are no observational constraints from hypothetical collisions of hypothetical dark halo primordial black holes with galactic objects _ can not be changed by including fine details , for example by considering some particular mass functions for @xmath37 .",
    "let us consider a spherical part of the galaxy with the radius @xmath38 containing @xmath45 stars .",
    "we will consider stars of a specific type , e.g. main sequence , white dwarf , or neutron star .",
    "the dark matter mass in the region is @xmath46 .",
    "the number density of primordial black holes can be estimated by assuming that pbhs represent a fraction @xmath47 of the dark matter in the region , and that the mass of a single pbh is @xmath37 ( @xmath47 and @xmath37 are free parameters of the model ) , @xmath48 the collision frequency is given by , @xmath49 here @xmath50 is the cross section of the interaction , and @xmath51 is the flux of pbhs that move with respect to stars with the relative velocity @xmath52 .",
    "we approximate @xmath52 by the rotational velocity in the galaxy , which is close to radial .",
    "the cross section @xmath53 should be calculated from the energy and momentum conservation during the encounter of gravitationally interacting star and pbh .",
    "the impact parameter @xmath54 of the encounter is defined by the pbh angular momentum , equal to @xmath55 as we are interested in an optimistic estimate of the event rate , and hence of the cross section , here we use the conservation of angular momentum in order to put an upper limit on the impact parameter @xmath56 for which there is a collision .",
    "this means that we use the maximum value for @xmath56 for each collision , even if this value may be smaller in reality .",
    "this maximum value for the impact parameter corresponds to the limiting case of a pbh only grazing the star s surface , so that from angular momentum conservation we get @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the final pbh speed , that can be computed by considering energy conservation in the limit of @xmath59 : @xmath60 with @xmath43 being the mass of the star and @xmath61 being the typical distance between stars .",
    "the characteristic distance at which the pbh enters the gravitational field of the star can be approximated as the typical distance between objects in the galaxy , assuming that each star - like object deflects the pbh at least marginally .",
    "we take this typical distance to be @xmath62  pc .",
    "we find that the gravitational energy is negligible in the initial state  pc , we get @xmath63  cms@xmath64 .",
    "the initial gravitational potential only becomes important for distances below @xmath65  pc , where the term @xmath66 becomes comparable to the initial velocity .",
    "since such short distances between stars are rather rare , we neglect this effect . as a comparison , the distance between the sun and its closest neighbor is @xmath67  pc .",
    "] , so that the final velocity can be expressed as @xmath68 where @xmath69 is the escape velocity of the star . combining equations ( [ vstar ] ) and ( [ ang_mom ] )",
    "one arrives at @xmath70 replacing the impact parameter @xmath56 in equ .",
    "( [ ndot : equ1 ] ) with the help of equ .",
    "( [ impact_parameter ] ) we get , finally @xmath71 now , the radial dependence of the parameters needs to be specified .",
    "the observed velocity profile of the galaxy can roughly be approximated as @xmath72 for @xmath73  kpc , and @xmath74 for @xmath75  kpc .",
    "starting from this observational fact , mass densities and masses enclosed in a radius @xmath38 can be determined , as listed in table [ table - regions ] .",
    "this naturally divides our estimates in a central part , considering only the bulge of the galaxy , and an outer part , considering the part of the galaxy where the velocity is constant . here",
    ", we will first consider the outer part of the galaxy .",
    "in section [ scaling - bulge ] , we will show how our results change for the central part .    if the region considered is the whole outer part of the galaxy ( the `` flat rotational curve region '' outside the bulge ) , one may use @xmath76  kpc , @xmath77 , and @xmath78  cms@xmath64 . introducing units convenient in this region , @xmath79 , @xmath80 , @xmath81 and @xmath82 ,",
    "one writes ( [ ndot : equ2 ] ) in the form @xmath83 apart from the pbh mass ( which is a free parameter ) this estimate depends only on the stellar properties .",
    "for instance , white dwarfs ( with @xmath84 ) have an event rate of @xmath85  yr@xmath64 for a black hole mass of @xmath4  g.      in estimating the kinetic energy which is transferred from the black hole to the star and then radiated , we follow previous studies of the motion of accretors in a continuous medium , see e.g.  @xcite . in making this first estimate",
    ", we assume a uniform and frictionless medium and disregard self - gravity of the gas .    the black hole passing through the gas focuses matter behind itself , creating a wake , because of the gravitational interaction transferring momentum to the atoms nearby .",
    "the inhomogeneity in the medium gives rise to a force acting on the black hole , causing a decrease in kinetic energy .",
    "as pointed out by  @xcite , the force on the black hole ( and hence the energy loss ) depends on whether the motion is supersonic or not , as well as on the degree of supersonic motion . in making a first order approximation",
    ", we consider the black hole to be moving at constant speed .",
    "also , we assume the velocity to be supersonic , so that the drag force , and hence the energy loss , reduces to that given by  @xcite .",
    "the energy loss due to the bow shock is negligible compared to that due to the tail shock , and the energy loss per time is then given by @xmath86 where @xmath87 is the maximum linear dimension of the star ( i.e.  its diameter ) and @xmath88 is the linear dimension of the accretor , lying between the black hole s horizon radius and its bondi - hoyle accretion radius .",
    "the exact formulation of the linear scales is not crucial for this first estimate , as they appear in a logarithm . here",
    ", we use @xmath89 .",
    "the total energy loss is then given by @xmath90 considering a time interval of @xmath91 .",
    "equation  ( [ eq : en_loss ] ) can be expressed as @xmath92 where @xmath93 .",
    "table  [ energy : table ] lists the energy released and the interaction probability for black holes of @xmath4  g passing through the different types of galactic objects .    in our picture",
    ", the shock front will locally heat the plasma to an extent depending on the particular galactic object under consideration .",
    "the spectrum is therefore a thermal one . in the following ,",
    "we discuss the peak energy of the spectrum in order to estimate the detectability for detector systems observing in the relevant energy range .",
    "to calculate the temperature of the shock , we assume supersonic shock conditions and a perfect gas , giving @xmath94 where the downstream velocity is diminished by a factor of four with respect to the upstream velocity ( see , for example ,  @xcite ) . here , @xmath95 is the boltzmann constant , @xmath58 is the velocity of the shock , @xmath96 is the mass of a hydrogen atom , @xmath97 is the mach number , and the average relative velocity between primordial black holes and stars is taken to be @xmath98  cm  s@xmath64 .",
    "wien s law now gives the frequency at maximum intensity as @xmath99 where @xmath100  km .",
    "this can also be expressed in terms of the peak photon energy @xmath101 this is merely a lower limit , but should suffice as a first - order estimate . for a collision with earth",
    ", an extreme ultraviolet spectrum is expected , while collisions with main sequence stars and red giant cores are expected to give an x - ray spectrum .",
    "white dwarfs and neutron stars can not be treated with simple thermodynamics : we here assume that the shock velocity @xmath58 determines the temperature of the shock .",
    "thus , we get a peak energy which is increased by a factor @xmath102 , @xmath103 for a white dwarf , we get a soft @xmath104 spectrum , while for a neutron star we get high - energy gamma rays , see table  [ energy : table ] .",
    "since we are dealing with order - of - magnitude estimates here , the actual peak energy could deviate from what is calculated . therefore , we present our results for all objects and for all possibly interesting energy ranges , i.g .  x - rays up to @xmath105rays .",
    "the estimates of frequency ( [ ndot : equ2 ] ) and energy ( [ eq : en_loss ] ) are general and valid everywhere in the galaxy . we have already numerically specified them for the region outside the bulge , where the velocity @xmath106 .",
    "we will now discuss them for the central bulge .",
    "note that only the frequency equation ( [ ndot : equ2 ] ) contains parameters @xmath38 , @xmath107 , @xmath108 , @xmath109 that depend on the region in the galaxy .",
    "the energy equation ( [ eq : en_loss ] ) does not depend on the relative velocity of stars and pbhs @xmath109 because the actual velocity of collision @xmath58 is usually dominated by the escape velocity at the stellar surface .",
    "the frequency equation ( [ ndot : equ2 ] ) scales with the relevant parameters as , @xmath110 let us now consider a model of the galaxy in which the rotational velocity @xmath52 is proportional to the distance from the galactic center in the `` bulge '' and constant `` outside '' .",
    "this approximately follows what is observed .",
    "distributions of the total ( i.e. luminous plus dark matter ) mass @xmath111 and its density @xmath112 may be calculated from @xmath113 results are given in table [ table - regions ] .",
    "one may assume that @xmath114 .",
    "then , in the bulge it is @xmath115 , @xmath116 and therefore @xmath117 , which means that in the bulge the frequency of collisions is maximal for @xmath118 ; it does _ not _ increase towards the bulge center .",
    "let us denote this maximal frequency by @xmath119 , and let us denote the frequency in the outside region by @xmath120 . from the above discussion and the last column of table [ table - regions ] it follows that , @xmath121 in the view of our estimate at the end of section [ eventrate ] , the collision frequency @xmath120 in the outside part of the galaxy is extremely small .",
    "the factor of @xmath122 does change much the situation in the bulge ; the collision frequency @xmath123 is also very small there .",
    "for this reason , in the rest of this paper we will not distinguish between the outside and the bulge , and take in our estimates of observational detectability @xmath124 as representative for the whole galaxy .",
    "an encounter in which a pbh passes through a stellar object would be detectable if the following conditions are met :    1 .",

    "similar results are obtained for swift , fermi - gbm and fermi - lat , as shown in figures  [ tobs_incl_dmax_swift : fig ] , [ tobs_incl_dmax_fermi_gbm : fig ] and [ tobs_incl_dmax_fermi_lat : fig ] : here as well , the observation times would need to be longer than @xmath180  years in order to see one event , except in the case of fermi / gbm at @xmath181  g , where @xmath182  years would be sufficient .",
    "the best observation times @xmath183 are those for the break points in the plots of the observation time against pbh mass @xmath176 .",
    "they are listed for the four detectors in table  [ detectors : table ] .",
    "these observation times are far longer than the lifetimes of the present detectors and so , given that they are anyway optimistic lower limits on the real times , we conclude that we can not obtain meaningful constraints in this way .",
    "the event rates are too low and the energy released is too small .",
    "+ any constraint which we could give for the pbh contribution to dark matter in the galaxy would be above 100% .",
    "we therefore do not convert the observation times into limits on the dark matter contribution .",
    "there are a few other processes that could in principle lead to the production of a detectable signal for different detectors .",
    "we will briefly discuss here why these mechanisms also fail to produce a significant signal :    * _ shock acceleration of charged particles _",
    "+ particles can gain energy by scattering off magnetic inhomogeneities via the mechanism of stochastic acceleration  @xcite .",
    "however , inside stars the densities are typically very high , and for white dwarfs and neutron stars the matter is degenerate .",
    "the mean free path of a proton in matter can be determined by considering the total cross section for proton - proton interactions ( with @xmath184  mbarn ) : @xmath185 this mean free path is typically smaller than a centimeter and does not allow for significant acceleration .",
    "injection and acceleration of energetic charged particles in shock fronts is therefore highly disfavored , with the possible exception of the tenuous envelopes of red giant stars . *",
    "_ star quakes _",
    "+ pbhs passing through an astrophysical object can induce star quakes .",
    "although the emitted photons themselves can not be distinguished from the general thermal spectrum of the star , the event could be detected by fourier - transforming the spectrum from time to frequency space , see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* e.g. ) and references therein .",
    "however , these quakes can so far only be detected for the sun and our rate for encounters between a pbh and the sun is only @xmath186 .",
    "this method for getting detections can therefore be excluded .",
    "@xcite have considered the possibility of a pbh being captured by a star . in this section , we show that such a capture could happen only for pbhs with masses greater than about @xmath187 g , i.e. in the range already constrained by the micro - lensing results discussed earlier .",
    "the capture rates would therefore be reduced by a factor of 10 or more , considering that @xmath188 .",
    "the energy balance for a pbh being attracted by an astrophysical object in the formulation of a reduced two - body problem is given by @xmath189 here , @xmath190 is the energy loss undergone by the pbh as it passes through the star and @xmath191 is its final energy .",
    "its initial energy is given by @xmath192 where we replace the reduced two - body mass by @xmath37 , because we are considering .",
    "the pbh can be captured by the star only if a sufficient part of the its initial kinetic energy can be dissipated ( `` lost '' ) by the effective dynamical friction as it passes through the star .",
    "the condition for getting a bound system is @xmath193 . from equations  ( [ e_balance : equ ] ) and ( [ ein : equ ] ) we get @xmath194 this is the condition that needs to be fulfilled in order to have a capture .",
    "the energy loss from effective friction should be dominant , as determined from equ .",
    "( [ eq : en_loss ] ) .",
    "it follows that @xmath195 we can now derive a condition for the minimum pbh mass required for capture : @xmath196 the minimum mass for which capture can occur can now be computed for each of the astrophysical objects which we are considering ( see table [ energy : table ] ) : @xmath197 on the view that the existence in the dark halo of pbhs with masses greater than about @xmath1  g is already constrained by the micro - lensing observations , we conclude that the capture of a pbh by a star is difficult in _ any _ of the pbh mass ranges .",
    "only relative velocities far below the average value could lead to a capture , but such events do not happen often enough to be significant .",
    "if any pbhs are captured by stars , this must be extremely rare , and certainly the fact that we do not observe them does not additionally constrain the pbh abundance in the dark halo of our galaxy .",
    "the above conclusion follows from the estimate of the energy lost when a pbh passes through a star , @xmath190 , based on the ruderman - spiegel effective dynamical friction formula .",
    "this may explain the difference between our conclusions and those of @xcite : they do not estimate @xmath190 , but instead assume that any pbh which collides with a star would be captured .",
    "we will examine the problem of estimating the probability of very low velocity pbh - star collisions at high pbh masses in a separate publication .",
    "we have shown in the previous sections that the process of effective friction when a pbh passes through a galactic object can not lead to a significantly detectable signal with current instruments .",
    "we calculated lower limits for the observation time for the best - suited detectors : xmm newton , swift - bat , and fermi - gbm and fermi - lat .",
    "these lower limits were based on the assumptions that    * _ the entire energy loss is radiated without significant delays and at the wavelength at which it is produced , _ * _ one photon is sufficient for having a significant detection of a signal , _ * _ all emitted energy is contained in the energy range of the detector , _ * _ the entire thickness of the galactic disk can be observed , _ * _ the signal is emitted at the largest opening angle , i.e.  @xmath16 .",
    "_    all of these assumptions were made in the sense of favoring detection ; more realistic settings would reduce the detectability even more .",
    "we have investigated interactions with main sequence stars , red giants , white dwarfs , and neutron stars . in general",
    ", we can conclude that the best results are obtained for main sequence stars . however , independently of the class of objects , the difficulty is that either the total energy loss in the process is too small ( for lower masses around @xmath24  g  @xmath34  g ) or the event rate is too small ( for larger masses around @xmath4  g  @xmath3  g ) .",
    "even with the optimistic assumptions listed above , observation times of more than @xmath180  years are required in order to see a single event for all of the objects and all of the detectors considered .",
    "although we use average values in place of the mass and velocity distributions of pbhs , variations away from these central values will not influence the result of these calculations significantly .",
    "one could , for instance , argue that the clumping of dark matter as discussed by @xcite would lead to an enhanced signal .",
    "however , such an effect would need to increase the event rate by at least a factor of @xmath198 in order to achieve reasonable observation times of @xmath199  yr .",
    "as shown in this paper , the central bulge of the galaxy may improve the situation by a factor of @xmath122 , but this is still not enough to reduce observation times to realistic scales of less than a month .",
    "hence , we conclude that constraining the abundance of pbhs in dm using interactions of pbhs with galactic objects is not possible in the standard scenario described above",
    ". a significant rate of grb - like events as suggested in @xcite can therefore be excluded .",
    "there may be additional aspects , such as clumping of dark matter or observation of nearby dwarf galaxies , leading to an enhanced event rate and energy release .",
    "however , these will have to be able to improve the observation times in this standard scenario by at least a factor of @xmath180 in order to give a significant signal .",
    "the main reason is that observation times of less than a month may be available with the different instruments , but not more .    concerning a possible collision with the earth : the predicted rate is as low as @xmath200yr@xmath201 .",
    "this means that there would be less than one such event per @xmath202  years for pbh masses above @xmath4  g. the interpretation of the tunguska event as a collision with a pbh of @xmath203  g , see @xcite , can therefore be considered highly implausible on the basis of this straightforward statistical argument .",
    "the most common explanation discussed today is that a comet or asteroid disintegrated on its way to earth . since no macroscopic fragments of the initial object were found , its exact nature , comet or asteroid , is still unknown , see e.g.  @xcite .    on the other hand , pbhs with masses below @xmath204  g may have struck or could still strike the earth , as the encounter frequency may be greater than once during the earth s life time .",
    "however , the energy loss is too small to see such events by means of radiation .",
    "the possibility of detecting them by means of an acoustic signal has been discussed by @xcite but there it was pointed out that the signal is too weak to be seen by seismic detectors .",
    "it could be interesting to look for those signatures with the planned generation of high - energy neutrino telescopes , optimized to detect acoustic signals : large natural water , ice or salt reservoirs are to be instrumented to look for acoustic signals from cherenkov radiation , see e.g. @xcite for a review .",
    "the surface area of such a detector is planned to be of the order of @xmath205  km@xmath206 .",
    "if the pbh has a distinct signature , it might be observable with such an instrument .",
