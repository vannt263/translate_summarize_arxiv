    "constraints on stellar abundance ratios ( high @xmath6/fe ) indicate their stars formed in rapid bursts of star - formation @xcite .",
    "additionally , it has been observed that galaxy morphology and star - formation properties are highly correlated , such that this quenched nature in massive galaxies appears coincident with morphological transformation to ellipsoidal , velocity dispersion dominated stellar structure ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "despite efforts to study this transition from star - forming galaxy to quenched ellipsoid , we have gained very little insight into both the transformational quenching process , as well as the mechanisms preventing further star - formation for the majority of the universe s history .    of particular importance to this effort",
    "are constraints from observing the progenitors of these massive early - type galaxies at z@xmath51 , shortly after their transformation from star - forming galaxy .",
    "recently quenched galaxies ( qgs ) begin to appear in large numbers at z@xmath72 @xcite , and have been observed even out to z@xmath73 - 4 @xcite .",
    "the properties of these quenched high - redshift galaxies provide significant insight into both the formation process of the galaxies during the star - formation phase , as well as the quenching mechanisms causing their transformation .",
    "the most striking feature of these recently quenched galaxies at high - redshift is their stellar structure ; while already having built up a similar amount of stellar mass as their z@xmath70 counterparts , they are remarkably compact in stellar density @xcite .",
    "the overwhelming majority of qgs ( @xmath580% ) at z@xmath51.5 have stellar densities higher than the lower 1@xmath8 of passive ( early - type ) galaxies at z@xmath70 at the same stellar mass @xcite .",
    "additionally , they are much smaller than the majority of massive star - forming galaxies at the same epoch @xcite , and in fact , one of the strongest predictors of quiescence among high - redshift galaxies is centrally concentrated light ( i.e. a measure of compactness ; * ? ? ?",

    "it appears , therefore , that compactness and quenched nature at high - redshift are inextricably linked .",
    "however , the physical reason for this correlation is also poorly understood .",
    "does the existence of the compact qgs at high - redshift imply something very fundamental about quenching ?",
    "in other words , does some physical process associated with stellar compactness predispose galaxies to quench ? alternatively ,",
    "are the earliest galaxies to form in the universe and complete their evolution simply the densest because the universe was denser at early times , or , because of some highly dissipative gaseous process that could take place predominantly at high redshift ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "there are some physically motivated reasons to believe that the former may be true .",
    "first , high stellar density implies a previous epoch of high surface density of star - formation , which would mean a higher energy input into the interstellar medium ( ism ) of compact galaxies , than might be present in larger , extended galaxies .",
    "@xcite have made this argument , based on the observation that there appears to be a maximum stellar density of _ any _ structure in the universe ( @xmath9 10@xmath10 m@xmath11 kpc@xmath12 ) .",
    "this limit in stellar density exists despite covering 8 orders of magnitude in stellar mass , from star clusters within galaxies , to the z@xmath52 compact qgs .",
    "this empirical limit argues for some stellar feedback process , such as massive stellar winds , that truncate the star - formation and prevent further growth beyond this density limit .",
    "studies of objects with high surface density of star - formation , where such extreme stellar feedback might be expected , have in fact found evidence of feedback in the form of very fast ( @xmath71000 km / s ) galactic - scale outflows from extremely compact star - forming regions that approach the eddington limit @xcite .",
    "the second , alternative scenario exists , that this connection is a very simple consequence of structure formation in the @xmath13cdm paradigm .",
    "the most massive galaxies in the early universe have formed the earliest in cosmic time , and therefore evolve to the end of their star - forming lifetime earliest . in this scenario ,",
    "the density of the parent halo of the quenched population at any redshift reflects the density of the universe at its formation epoch ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and therefore will progressively increase in size ( and therefore stellar density ) over time .",
    "such a scenario , known as progenitor bias , would also contribute to the increasing size evolution of qgs over cosmic time @xcite ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "in this scenario , the significance of compactness is irrelevant for the quenching , and rather , galaxies quench when they ve reached sufficient mass that they no longer support star - formation .",
    "the quenching mechanism then may be related to halo mass , or some other mass related mechanism to cut of gas supply for future star - formation ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . distinguishing between these scenarios is highly important to understanding the evolution of early - type galaxies .",
    "each of these two scenarios have empirical predictions for the properties of qgs .",
    "in the stellar - density regulated star - formation scenario , galaxies with high enough surface density of star - formation will quench , and produce remnants with high stellar density .",
    "thus at any given epoch , the most recently quenched objects should also be the densest ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "there is no explicit prediction for a trend of stellar density with stellar age or mass ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "however , progenitor bias explicitly predicts that stellar age , and stellar density be correlated , with the densest objects also being the oldest at any given epoch ( in the absence of size growth via merging ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in this paper , we seek to distinguish between these two scenarios , and in the process , gain insight into why galaxies quench their star - formation early in cosmic time . in section 2",

    "we select qgs from the cosmic assembly near - infrared deep extragalactic legacy survey ( candels ) data @xcite in goods - south according to the selection outlined in @xcite , which identified 179 qgs at z@xmath51 with m*@xmath510@xmath17m@xmath11 , specific sfr @xmath18 10@xmath12 gyr@xmath19 and centrally concentrated , spheroidal morphologies . for this study , we have measured the properties of this sample using the candels multi - wavelength photometry @xcite following the sed fitting procedure outlined in lee et al .",

    "we define a compactness cut on the qg sample according to the local z@xmath70 mass - size relation for local galaxies from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) .",
    "we define qgs as compact if their size ( at a given mass ) is smaller than the lower 1-@xmath8 of the local early - type galaxy size - mass relation @xcite .",
    "this roughly corresponds to a stellar mass surface density of @xmath93x10@xmath23m@xmath11kpc@xmath12 .",
    "we refer to any qg with a stellar density higher than this threshold as compact .",
    "qgs that are more extended , and thus similar to the majority of local sdss early - type galaxies in mass and size , we refer to as normal. the position of the qgs in the mass - size diagram , illustrating the compactness cut from sdss , are presented in figure [ masssize ] .",
    "there are 28 compact galaxies and 33 normal - sized galaxies .",

    "the spectra we use from vimos in the @xcite release are all using the medium resolution grism , which has comparable resolution .      to produce average composite spectra ( stacks ) we perform the following procedure .",

    "we then flux normalize each spectrum using the median flux value measured between restframe 4000@xmath254050 .",
    "finally , we stack the normalized spectra using the _ scombine _ package in iraf , and rebin to a common dispersion ( @xmath261.4pixel@xmath19 , rest frame ) , and performed a 3@xmath8 clipping during the stack .",
    "our stacked composite spectra of the two qg samples are presented in figure [ stack ] .",
    "there are 6 out of the 28 compact qgs that do not have spectral coverage at red ward of rest frame 4000 , thus we have excluded them from the stack and its analysis presented in section 3.2 .",
    "however their spectra are suitable for the analysis presented in sections 3.3 and 3.4 , which include the full sample of 28 galaxies .    [ !",
    "t ]        we have estimated the error on the stacks as the sample standard deviations of each spectroscopic sample . to measure the standard deviations , we repeat the stacks of each sample using jackknife resampling , each time removing one spectrum and stacking the rest of the spectra following the identical procedure described above .",
    "the final sample error is the standard deviation of the jackknifed stacks at each spectral point .",
    "the stacks presented in figure [ stack ] exhibit many features typical of old stellar populations , namely strong balmer absorption typical of post - starburst galaxies , strong g - band absorption , and a prominent 4000  break .",
    "additionally , very weak [ ] emission is occasionally present ( as we discuss later ) , indicating little ( if any ) star - formation in some cases .",
    "we discuss the [ ] properties of the galaxies further in section 3.3 . in the following section 3.2 ,",
    "we show the properties of the stellar populations , including average stellar population ages , in these two samples .        we have measured the average age of the stellar populations of the two qg samples from their stacks , using two age diagnostics : the 4000  break ( d@xmath274000 ) , and h@xmath28 absorption . for the d@xmath274000 diagnostic ,",
    "we have used the age calibration presented in @xcite , which takes the ratio of the mean flux between 4000  and 4100 , to the mean flux between 3850  and 3950  in the stack . we measure the error on the d@xmath274000 diagnostic by generating 1000 gaussian deviates of each spectral point in the stack using the observed sample error described in section 2.3 , and repeating the d@xmath274000 measurement each time .",
    "the error is then the standard deviation of the sample of gaussian deviated d@xmath274000 measurements .",
    "we find that the compact sample have a d@xmath274000 @xmath29 1.45 @xmath30 0.03 , a larger measure ( i.e. older age ) than for the normal sample , from which we have measured d@xmath274000 @xmath29 1.398@xmath300.002 .",
    "we have compared these d@xmath274000 measurements to those made with single - age stellar population models using the same procedure ( figure [ kauff03 ] ; * ? ? ?",

    "the age evolution of the diagnostic is presented from the stelib library for bursts of solar metallicity ( solid line ) , 20% solar ( dotted ) and 2.5 times solar ( dashed line ) .",
    "for all models , the d@xmath274000 of the compact sample implies older stellar age than that of the normal sample .    [ !",
    "t ]        similarly , we have made the comparison using the age - sensitive h@xmath28 absorption feature .",
    "unlike the d@xmath274000 diagnostic , which grows monotonically with age , the h@xmath28 ( as well as other balmer ) absorption feature peaks for stellar populations of age @xmath71 gyr ( a - type stars ) . as the stellar population ages , the balmer absorption starts to decrease in strength .",
    "we measure h@xmath31 using the lick absorption line index @xcite . to estimate the error on our measurement of h@xmath31 we follow the same procedure as for d@xmath274000 , by re - measuring the index from 1000 gaussian deviates of each spectral point , and taking the standard deviation of these h@xmath31 measurements .",
    "we find that the compact sample has h@xmath31 @xmath29 0.33 @xmath30 0.31 , a smaller value ( i.e. older age ) than for the normal sample , from which we have measured h@xmath31 @xmath29 2.74 @xmath30 0.06 .",
    "the bottom panels of figure [ kauff03 ] show how these measured values compare to those from the evolutionary models explored in @xcite .",
    "although the trends between the age diagnostics and the stellar population age are obvious for each of the models shown in figure [ kauff03 ] , it is also obvious that the diagnostics depend on other features of the models such as metallicity . therefore , we do not attempt to use these measurements as average age measurements of the galaxy populations . rather , we seek to gain insight into _ relative _ age differences between the two samples using the few models presented in figure [ kauff03 ] . at face value",
    ", the average age implied by the 6 models from d@xmath274000 suggests an age difference between the two galaxy samples of roughly @xmath70.3 gyr . the h@xmath31 index suggests a larger age difference , with the compact sample are @xmath72.5 gyr older than the normal qg sample ( we discuss in section 3.2.2",
    "why the difference implied by h@xmath31 is likely overestimated ) .",
    "however , it is clear that both age indicators imply that the compact sample , on average , have older stellar ages than the normal sample .      in the literature , it has been extensively discussed that other spectral features adjacent to the h@xmath28 absorption line can affect the measurement of the h@xmath31 lick index ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    ". in particular , stellar continuum absorption by molecular ch and cn lines to the blue and red of h@xmath28 can depress the pseudo continuum regions used to measure the index , resulting in an underestimated value for the index .",
    "the net consequence is an overestimated age based on the line .",
    "although the nature of this continuum absorption is not well understood , it is likely originating in old stellar populations , from metal enriched cool stars @xcite .    as can be seen in figure [ stack ] , we observe the compact qg stack to exhibit a prominent peak immediately blue ward of the h@xmath28 line , followed by a band of continuum absorption between 4100 - 4200 .",
    "the blue peak is an indication of the true continuum level , unaffected by the cn absorption .",
    "such prominent features are not seen in the normal qg stack .",
    "this feature is undoubtedly affecting the h@xmath31 measurement in the compact sample , such that the implied age is overestimated ( and , therefore , the relative age difference as well ) .",
    "however , this evidence of old , metal enriched stellar populations in the compact sample is in general agreement with the evidence for an older average stellar age than the normal qg sample .",
    "we discuss further constraints on this age differential between the two samples in the following section .    [ !",
    "t ]          an alternative estimate for the age differential between the two populations can be obtained by fitting stellar population templates to the stacks . in this section ,",
    "we use the penalized pixel - fitting ( ppxf ) software @xcite to explore the average ages of the two galaxy samples , again with the goal of gaining insight into _ relative _ age differences . as templates for the fitting",
    ", we use the @xcite ssp models based on the medium resolution int library of empirical spectra ( miles ; sanchez - blazquez et al .",
    "due to the poorly understood nature of the cn and ch stellar continuum absorption features , we choose to use these templates because they are composed of empirical stellar spectra where these features are observed ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "we allow ppxf to choose the  optimal  combination of templates , along with multiplicative and additive polynomials , to fit the continuum shape , to fit each stacked spectrum , where the initial mass function ( imf ) is fixed with a slope of 1.3 @xcite , and we constrain the maximum age of any template to be the age of the universe at z=1.2 .",
    "we allow ppxf to choose from a range of templates of varying ages , which are weighted and summed together to construct the best fitting model .",
    "the signal to noise of our stacks starts to deteriorate at wavelengths longer than rest - frame 4800  from a combination of decreased number of spectra with wavelength coverage in that region , and possibly poor subtraction of telluric features , and so we constrain the spectral region provided to ppxf to 3500 - 4800 , masking out 40  surrounding the [ ] @xmath323727 emission .    to choose the appropriate metallicity range for the fitting , we use constraints from the mass - stellar metallicity relation out to z@xmath70.7 @xcite at our average stellar masses ( @xmath3310.7 for both samples ) . only the solar metallicity models in (",
    "* using the padova+00 isochrones of @xcite ) fall within the confidence intervals of the @xcite mass - metallicity relation at this average mass .",
    "therefore , we limit our fits to these models .",
    "ppxf measures the luminosity weighted age based on the sum of 2 templates , which assumes galaxies may be composed of several stellar populations .",
    "those individual populations may not necessarily follow the mass - stellar metallicity relation .",
    "however , we note that our results do not strongly depend on either the wavelength range or metallicity assumed by the fit .",
    "we estimate errors on the age of the stellar populations given by the fit as the variance of a series of bootstrap resampled templates added to the fit residuals .",
    "we find that the compact stack has an average age of 2.54@xmath300.63 gyr ( reduced @xmath34=15.3 ) , while the normal sample are 1.87@xmath300.65 gyr ( reduced @xmath34=30.2 ) , an age differential that is in general agreement with the findings using the lick indices in section 3.2.1 in that the age measured from the compact sample is older .",
    "these results are shown in figure [ ppxf ] .    to conclude this section , our results from both the spectral indices and the full spectral fitting _ consistently _",
    "indicate that there is evidence that the average age of the compact qg sample may be older than that of the normal qg sample .",

    "it is therefore unlikely that this [ ] emission is contributed to significantly by an agn ( see section 3.4 for additional constraints ) .",
    "there is no obvious difference in the line luminosities or sfrs between the two samples ( figure [ oiifluxdist ] ) .",

    "additionally , @xcite have arrived at the same result via the opposite analysis from us ; by separating the oldest qgs during the epoch 1@xmath18z@xmath182 from the youngest ( @xmath28age@xmath71.5 - 2gyr ) they find the youngest to reside on the local z@xmath70 early - type galaxy mass - size relation ( like our normal qg sample ) , whereas the old qgs are denser , with radius a factor of 2.5 - 3 smaller than local early - type galaxies .",

    "this has prompted investigations of scenarios where quenching is more efficient in galaxies with high stellar density because of increased stellar feedback ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "however , a causal relationship between high stellar density ( compactness ) and likelihood of quenching does not directly predict an age  density correlation ; rather , at any given epoch , the densest galaxies should be the most likely to quench , but not necessarily the oldest ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "the presence of a relationship between age and stellar density where by denser galaxies are older is precisely the prediction of the progenitor bias scenario @xcite .",
    "the density of a galaxy reflects the density of the universe when the galaxy formed ( assuming very little , or average , structural disruption ) and therefore older galaxies should be denser .",
    "thus , at face value , our results support that galaxies which form earlier , and completed their evolution earlier , were simply denser than larger galaxies that form and evolve later , without the density necessarily having anything directly to do with the cessation of their star formation activity .",

    "an independent , but complementary , piece of information comes from the x  ray and [ ] properties of our two samples . in themselves",
    "the [ ] emission line and the x  ray data do not provide any firm indication as to the causes of quenching .",
    "the average x  ray luminosity for the majority of our sample does not show evidence of any powerful agn , but one could have been present prior to reaching the current , very low level of star formation activity .",
    "there is evidence that the sources of ionizing radiation that are still present in the two samples are different at the time of observation ; namely the compact galaxies show a significantly lower detection rate of [ ] and of x - ray emission than the normal qgs .",
    "this difference is fully consistent with a scenario where the quenching occurred earlier in the compact sample and have therefore had a longer time to fade .",

    "it is interesting to note that various studies have come to very different conclusions about the nature of feedback in compact star - forming galaxies .",
    "@xcite have claimed that the agn fraction in compact sfgs may be up to 50% , suggesting that the presence of agn may truncate the star - formation on short timescales .",
    "however , @xcite have discovered that a subset of this sample , despite being on the star - forming main sequence , have much lower molecular gas masses than normal main - sequence galaxies , suggesting that star - formation will be quenched on short timescales due to simple gas exhaustion if the influx of gas has been suppressed .",

    "* ) , plausibly leading to the truncation of future star - formation .    from our data",
    "it is clear , however , that in the time since quenching was initiated in these qg samples , major energizing sources have already dissipated .",
    "future detailed studies of galaxies closer to their quenching epoch may identify the physical processes that shut down star - formation at high - redshift .",
    "an important feature of both samples is that some of the qgs have x - ray emission detected in the deep chandra 4ms data of the cdfs .",
    "only a minority of the galaxies are individually detected ( see table 1 ) ; stacking the images at the position of the the non - detected galaxies , however , yields measurable flux in the soft band , but not in the hard one .",
    "figure 7 shows a plot of the hardness ratio versus the x - ray luminosity ( left ) and versus the  luminosity ( right ) .",
    "the former correlation seems rather striking given the relatively small sample of galaxies with x - ray detections , and barring some unforeseen selection effects , it may be used as a diagnostic of the physical nature of the x - ray emission .",
    "the latter correlation is much less obvious due to the limited dynamic range of the  luminosity , and while a physical correlation could still be present , we note that the second most luminous galaxy in x - ray has the weakest  emission while the most luminous one has no measurable  line flux .",
    "agn have long been suspected to be the key agent behind the quenching of star formation , as well as prevention of future star formation in galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "thus an obvious question is whether or not the x - ray properties of our qgs are consistent with this idea . while the range of hardness ratio spanned by our galaxies is the same as narrow  line agn and normal galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the correlation between hardness ratio and x - ray luminosity shown by our galaxies qualitatively looks very different from the distribution of the parent population of x - ray detections ( see gray points in figure [ xray ] ; * ? ? ?",

    "these x - ray sources are dominated by agn with luminosities @xmath5 10@xmath46 erg / s ( see also * ? ? ? * for the distribution among more powerful obscured agn ) .",
    "the distribution exhibits large scatter in hardness ratio and x - ray luminosity , most likely a reflection of the diversity of obscuration , orientation , spectral slope , power and selection effects of the agn population . while our data points seem to follow the general trend of other faint x - ray sources in their redshift bins , they seem to have much less scatter , especially given the small size of the sample ( only 9 points ) .",
    "this , taken together with the fact that we observe stacked x - ray emission in the soft band but not the hard one ( i.e. on average our galaxies are soft x - ray sources ) suggests that the x - ray emission is unlikely powered by agn .",
    "a possibility is that the x  ray luminosity of our qgs is primarily powered by emission from hot gas , e.g. coronal gas that formed as a combination of outflows , stellar winds , and also low  mass x",
    " ray binaries ( lmxb ) .",
    "at this time we do not have sufficient information to distinguish which one is more likely to be dominant .",
    "coronal emission and lmxb produce x - ray radiation that is generally softer than agn , and the value of hardness ratio that we measure from our sample is generally consistent with both , although the hardness ratio of agn covers a very broad range @xcite . in the case of emission from hot gas",
    "a correlation between x - ray luminosity and hardness ratio would simply reflect a dependence of the spectral index and the gas temperature .",
    "this is observed , for example , in the emission from coronal gas around individual stars @xcite . in our galaxies ,",
    "the gas would come collectively from the stellar remnants produced during the phase of star formation , or hot halo gas , both of which could be still present in the galaxies .",
    "an in  depth study of the x  ray emission of our sample and the comparison with local counterparts is beyond the scope of this paper , which is devoted to the galaxies stellar age .",
    "we simply note that the possibility that we are observing coronal emission from individual quenched galaxies at @xmath44 is very important to understanding the evolution of the interstellar medium and circum - galactic medium in early - type galaxies . in a forthcoming paper",
    ", we plan to accurately quantify selection effects and further investigate the x - ray properties of qgs .",
    "if confirmed , it will provide a powerful diagnostic of the feedback that took place during the star  formation phase and that is preventing the galaxies from forming stars again .",
    "we also note that even if the observed x  ray emission does indeed turn out to be from hot gas , this still does not rule out agn as the cause of quenching , since the agn activity could have been quenched together with the star - formation , for example , as a result of the cessation of gas accretion into the galaxies .",
    "the question of whether or not agn is responsible for star - formation quenching in galaxies thus remains an open one .",
    "we have presented analysis based on optical spectroscopy of two samples of z@xmath71.2 qgs ; those which are compact relative to local early - type galaxies , and larger , more extended ",
    "normal  qgs .",
    "we find evidence that compact qgs on average have older stellar ages than normal - sized qgs .",
    "this observed density - age correlation is an empirical prediction of the progenitor bias scenario , whereby the first galaxies to evolve and quench are simply the most compact due to their early formation time , and extended qgs form later and quench later .",
    "we also study the [ ] emission and x - ray properties of the two samples , finding evidence for lower incidence rate of residual energy sources in the compact sample compared to normal qgs .",
    "this is consistent with the idea that the compact sample quenched earlier , having had longer time to fade .",
    "we do not find explicit evidence for compactness - driven quenching , and suggest that future studies of galaxies at their quenching epoch may help illuminate whether the feedback or regulation of star - formation differs with stellar density .",
