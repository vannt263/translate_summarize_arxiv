    "the essence of quantum metrology @xcite is the concept of estimation of a small external parameter with the help of a quantum procedure .",

    "the usual quantifier of a distance between quantum states is the quantum fidelity @xcite @xmath4 where density operators @xmath5 and @xmath6 describe the compared states .",
    "now consider a family of quantum states @xmath7 controlled by a parameter @xmath8 , and let @xmath9 be a small shift of the parameter that we want to estimate",
    ". for sufficiently small @xmath9 one has @xmath10 where @xmath11 is often called _ fidelity susceptibility _ and is proportional to the _ fisher information _ , i.e. , @xmath12 . for pure states",
    "fidelity susceptibility is directly measurable by means of bragg spectroscopy @xcite .",
    "quantum fisher information is an ultimate bound on the accuracy of any estimate one may make on the unknown @xmath9 . indeed ,",
    "if in order to identify @xmath9 we make a measurement of some general observable @xmath13  called an _ estimator _  then the precision it offers is quantified by the _ error propagation _ formula given by the inverse of the _ signal to noise ratio _ : @xmath14 the ultimate lower bound for the uncertainty of estimation of a small deviation @xmath9 is @xmath15 which is independent of the observable @xmath16 and determined by the fisher information @xmath17 . in principle , the above bound would be saturated by some special observable @xmath18 satisfying the condition @xmath19 , which , however , would generally be impossible to design experimentally . in this article",
    "we shall focus on the feasible estimation of the small parameter @xmath20 .",
    "there are basically two different scenarios discussed in the literature on how to introduce the dependence of the state on the parameter @xmath9 . in the first approach @xcite the state",
    "is rotated by some hamiltonian and then the estimator observable @xmath16 is measured , with the accuracy determined by the error propagation formula . while it is known that , in principle , with many - body interacting hamiltonian the corresponding fisher information can imply the error vanishing exponentially with @xmath1 @xcite , it has been proven that when the hamiltonian is composed only of _ local _ one - site terms @xmath21 i.e. @xmath22 then the scaling is of the so - called heisenberg - type i.e. @xmath23 as opposed to the classical type of behavior with @xmath24 .",
    "it has been argued that adding short range interactions to the above hamiltonan does not improve the scaling @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the final formula is quite sensitive to local noise and because of that one basically always ends up with the classical scaling in the large @xmath1 limit @xcite . on the other hand , the above approach serves as a powerful entanglement detector @xcite which can detect a vanishing fraction of entanglement @xcite or even bound entanglement @xcite with scaling close to the heisenberg limit .",
    "this entanglement detection method has recently found a new application in the proposal to measure the fisher information as a dynamical susceptibility of the thermal input state @xcite .",
    "recently , the pure state metrology in the spirit of the above approach has been reformulated in terms of the loschmidt echo @xcite .",
    "also , the variant involving so called compressed sensing has been provided @xcite , which , due to the specific character of the model that can be mapped onto the free - fermionic system allows one to exponentially reduce the resources at some stage of the procedure . note that even though quantum criticality has been explicitly employed in the latter , the heisenberg bound is still an ultimate bound in that framework @xcite .    having this in mind , one immediately recalls the second approach that connects estimation problem to the concept of criticality @xcite . in that approach one focuses on the situation where the dependence of the state on @xmath8 has completely different origin : the state @xmath25 is the ground state of the hamiltonian depending on the parameter @xmath8 , which exhibits criticality at some critical point @xmath26 .",
    "the essence of this approach is an observation that in the vicinity of the critical point the ground states overlap becomes drastically sensitive to small change of @xmath8 . clearly , the parameter measuring this sensitivity is the same as before : fidelity susceptibility proportional to the fischer information .",
    "however , as far as estimation of the parameter @xmath8 is concerned the questions of ( i ) the bound on the scaling of the error in terms of @xmath1 , ( ii ) structure of observable saturating it and ( iii ) feasible experimental proposal have not been addressed explicitly so far .",
    "in particular , the immediate question is : while it is known that the local unitary generator approach leads to the heisenberg scaling as an ultimate bound @xcite  even if enhanced by adding short - range interactions to the original one - body hamiltionian @xcite  is it also so in the second approach considering ground states overlap ?",
    "here we point out that in such cases , due to quantum phase transitions exhibited by the model , the super - heisenberg scaling is something natural . in particular we provide the spin model yielding @xmath27 with @xmath28 being the parameter value at the critical point .",
    "moreover , unlike in the standard metrology , the most natural , strictly local and parameter independent estimator , namely the magnetization , is enough to go beyond the heisenberg limit by reaching @xmath2 .",
    "we also show that the operator which measures the magnetization on all sites simultaneously scales in the same way as the optimal one , where we should point out that finding an analytical form of the optimal operator in many - body system is a daunting challenge , typically .",
    "nevertheless , we also discuss how to make an _ universal _ estimator - type measurement in the paradigm where original reference state , which is independent of the sought small parameter @xmath9 , and a specific quadratic interactions are accessible .",
    "finally we provide a possible implementation on cold atoms system in optical lattice which makes an experimental verification of our results plausible .    in sec .",

    "here we provide the derivation of scaling super - heisenberg relations ( the core result of the paper ) and test them against numerical data in the immediate vicinity of the critical point of the model .",
    "we briefly mention possible realization of the model in cold atom optical lattice setting , giving the more detailed derivation in sec .",
    "[ sec : cold ] .",

    "consider the quantum system depending on a parameter @xmath8 , the value of which we shall try to estimate . for the ground state @xmath25 of the hamiltonian @xmath29 , the fidelity defined in eq .",
    "simplifies as @xmath30 it is intuitively clear that fidelity may be significantly below unity , or alternatively that @xmath31 is large , when the properties of the system change significantly with @xmath8 . then the measurement of some observable might lead to an accurate determination of @xmath8 .",
    "clearly , when the system undergoes the quantum phase transition ( qpt ) its properties change dramatically that is why the maxima of @xmath31 ( for a finite system ) or divergences ( in the thermodynamic limit ) of @xmath31 signal the location of the quantum critical point @xcite . obviously , for eq .",
    "to hold we have to consider finite system and sufficiently small @xmath9  otherwise higher terms in that expansion are non - negligible and in that case one should be considering @xmath32 which becomes an extensive quantity in this limit @xcite .",
    "it has been shown @xcite that the universal information can be extracted from the fidelity susceptibility at the critical point due to the scaling @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the system size in @xmath35 dimensions .",
    "one may also look at @xmath31 away from the critical point where the expected scaling reads @xmath36 in the above expressions it is assumed that the physics around the critical point is described by one characteristic scale of length ( correlation length ) which dependence on the distance from the critical point is captured by the critical exponent @xmath37 , and @xmath38 so that non - universal ( system - specific ) corrections to eq .",
    "are subleading @xcite .",
    "the behavior of the fidelity susceptibility at the critical point is directly matched by the quantum fisher information , @xmath17 , as both are directly proportional to the bures distance between density matrices at slightly differing values of @xmath8 @xcite . as a result at the critical point @xmath39 .",
    "consequently , realization of the physical system with small @xmath37 can lead to hyper - sensitive estimation of @xmath8 .",
    "the usually considered , exactly solvable 1d spin ising chain with @xmath8 being the transverse field exhibits the critical point with @xmath40 , resulting in @xmath41 @xcite . in the following",
    "we propose a physical realization of another spin system leading to much smaller value of @xmath37 , which leads to extreme sensitivity of the system when @xmath8 is varied across the critical point .",
    "the model of interest is the ferromagnetic heisenberg spin chain @xmath42 where we assume open boundary conditions and @xmath1 is the number of spins .",
    "it has a critical point at @xmath43 for @xmath44 .",
    "the critical exponent @xmath45 was calculated in ref .",
    "@xcite and for fixed @xmath46 reads @xmath47 which satisfies the desired condition of @xmath48 .",
    "we note that quite similar xxz model was studied in @xcite both in zero and non - zero temperatures , where however external magnetic field @xmath8 was not present , and the shift of parameters was induced by changing the value of @xmath46 , which leads to a qualitatively different type of behavior .",
    "we consider the following observables @xmath49 which corresponds to the simultaneous measurement of magnetization at all sites , and @xmath50 i.e. the on - site magnetization in the bulk .",
    "@xmath8 is a magnetic field conjugated to the magnetization in this model .",
    "we note that , in order to avoid possible confusion with the commonly used convention , see e.g. @xcite , we use here @xmath45 instead of @xmath37 as a correlation length critical exponent .    by employing finite size scaling analysis",
    "we argue that for @xmath51 the error propagation formula should scales as @xmath52 saturating the bound provided by fidelity susceptibility , and for the observable @xmath53 we obtain @xmath54 the above scaling relations are the main observation of this article .    [ t ]    in order to derive the above relation , we analyze the scaling of variance and susceptibility appearing in eq .  .",
    "in the thermodynamic limit the induced magnetization follows a power law @xmath55 with critical exponent @xmath56 and susceptibility @xmath57 .",
    "the finite size scaling implies that for a finite system at the critical point @xmath58 , where we write general expression for a system in @xmath35 dimensions where @xmath59 is the linear size and @xmath60 .",
    "taking into account that @xmath61 this leads to eq .   .",
    "similarly , the @xmath51 susceptibility is expected to scale in the same way as for @xmath53 ( we assume that possible boundary effects are subleading ) and it is enough to estimate the behavior of the variance , where we have to take into account algebraically decaying correlations at the critical point .",
    "as the correlation function @xmath62 , then easy calculation yields @xmath63 and consequently @xmath64 . the hyperscaling relation , see .",
    "e.g. @xcite implies that the exponent in the second term is zero , leading to eq .  .    in figure",
    "[ fig : xxz_scaling ] we numerically verify that the above scaling relations indeed hold in this model by employing matrix product states ( mps ) calculations @xcite .",
    "it can be seen that the very natural operator measuring magnetization on all sites practically reproduces the super - heisenberg scaling allowed by the fisher information .",
    "while on - site magnetization in a bulk grows slower with the system size then the ultimate bound , it is still well in the super - heisenberg regime .",
    "for instance , eqs .",
    "( [ eq : nu_xxz],[eq : epfa1],[eq : epfa2 ] ) imply that for @xmath65 in our model we expect @xmath66 and @xmath67 , which is in good agreement with the numerical results .",
    "notice , that the value of @xmath45 in eq .   follows from the scaling dimension of the operator @xmath68 , equal @xmath69 @xcite , and consequently the exponent @xmath70 .",
    "the natural question is how to produce or simulate the above physical system .",
    "such a spin model may be possibly realized for repulsively interacting ultra - cold bosons in optical lattice potential in a quasi - one - dimensional ( 1d ) geometry resulting from tight confinement in the perpendicular directions .",
    "the optical lattice potential can be precisely controlled , in particular it can be shaken laterally @xcite that allows to change the system properties . by modulating intensity of laser beams forming the optical lattice its depth can be also modulated periodically @xcite . assuming that both processes occur with the same frequency @xmath71 , frequency that is much larger than the tunneling frequency as well as a characteristic frequency due to interactions one can derive an effective time - averaged hamiltonian governing the long - time physics as reviewed e.g. in @xcite .",
    "importantly , we assume , that this frequency ( or rather its integer multiple , @xmath72 ) is resonant with @xmath73 transition between the lowest and the excited , @xmath74-band .",
    "such a resonance leads to additional slowly varying terms that affect the effective hamiltonian obtained after time - averaging .",
    "consider such a system with an unit mean filling per site .",
    "identifying the proper ground state manifold one may express the low energy excitations as an effective spin hamiltonian . depending on @xmath75",
    "one may realize the effective xxz heisenberg model for @xmath76 @xcite , or the model that reduces to the desired xxz heisenberg hamiltonian in the magnetic field in eq .   for @xmath77 .",
    "for the interested readers , we provide the explicit derivation in section [ sec : cold ] while we continue the discuss of the possible effects due to imperfect tuning and a finite temperature first .",
    "while the main super - heisenberg scaling results has been already presented , it is quite natural to ask to what extend such a scaling can be observed in real systems , for example due to a non - perfect tuning to the phase transition point and/or a finite temperature of an experiment .",
    "fortunately , general scaling predictions addressing this issue can be provided and verified by numerical simulations , which we show in this section .",
    "firstly , when @xmath8 is not tuned sufficiently close to the critical point , the fidelity susceptibility depends linearly on @xmath1 as discussed around eq .  .",
    "the crossover is expected for @xmath78 , which means that in order to obtain super - heisenberg scaling , @xmath8 should be tuned to the critical point within @xmath79 .",
    "this is also the scale of @xmath9 which can be observed in this case . in the opposite limit , away from the critical point ,",
    "the error propagation formula in the leading order should scale as @xmath80 and @xmath81 the derivation is similar as in the previous section , but now in order to estimate the variance of @xmath51 we assume correlation function of the form @xmath82 , where the correlation length @xmath83 .",
    "we numerically verify those scaling predictions in our model for @xmath84 in figure [ fig : xxz_detune ] .",
    "while away from the critical point the accuracy allowed by @xmath53 becomes significantly worse then the optimal one , the accuracy of @xmath51 closely follows the ultimate bound set by the fisher information .",
    "it is worth pointing out that even though we have @xmath85 scaling in this limit , being in the vicinity of the critical point significantly improves the prefactor as in general @xmath86 .",
    "[ t ! ]    secondly , the pure state idealization which were discussed thus far can not be fully realized due to external noise , including the thermal one . here , for simplicity , we consider the situation where the temperature @xmath87 is finite but @xmath88 is exactly tuned to the critical point .",
    "if the finite - size energy gap at the critical point scales as @xmath89 , with the critical exponent @xmath90 , then we expect super - heisenberg behavior to hold for @xmath91 . in the opposite limit of @xmath92",
    "we recover the classical behavior , where similarly as above we obtain @xmath93 and @xmath94 .",
    "it is worth noticing that the studies of finite temperature fidelity susceptibility of @xcite were performed in such a limit .    in figure",
    "[ fig : xxz_t ] we illustrate those scaling predictions in our model for @xmath84 .",
    "we employ mps calculations , where the finite temperature density matrices @xmath95 are expressed as purification and obtained via simulation of the finite system in the imaginary time @xcite .",
    "[ t ! ]    as the direct computation of fidelity in eq .   seems difficult in the mps representation , we follow ref .",
    "@xcite and calculate the fidelity defined as @xmath96 in this case .",
    "importantly , as discussed in @xcite and derived in @xcite if one uses this definition to calculate fidelity susceptibility @xmath97 ( similarly as in eq .  ) then @xmath98 .",
    "this allows us to define @xmath99 , which is upper - bounding fisher information and which we plot in fig .",
    "[ fig : xxz_t ] .",
    "consider an arbitrary hamiltonian @xmath29 and suppose that we have significant reasons to believe that @xmath8 is critical , but for technical reasons it is difficult to prove it and , in particular , there is no linear estimator known  like the two observables discussed in the previous sections  that could provide accuracy close to the limit of fisher information scaling .",
    "the question is whether there is any way to design an experiment that would allow to circumvent the above difficulty . to answer this affirmatively",
    ", we shall provide a simple estimator , quadratic in terms of the interaction involved , which however remains relatively simple and , at least in principle , can be detected with the present state of the art technology of the optical lattices .",
    "let us assume that apart from @xmath100 experimentalist can also prepare the state at the critical point @xmath101 .",
    "now , it is known that @xmath102  the square of fidelity in eq .   between the two above states ",
    "can be detected using so called _ universal quantum estimator _",
    "@xcite , which is measurable involving at most quadratic interaction among elementary qubits corresponding to the series of independent hong - ou - mandel type measurements @xcite .",
    "the main idea behind it is to measure the quantity @xmath103 , which is the mean value of the _ swap _ observable ( defined below ) jointly measured on the product state @xmath104 .",
    "the first experiment of this type has been performed relatively long time ago on two copies of the same state of the polarization - entangled photon pairs , which aimed at estimation of renyi-2 entropy to show that violation of suitable inequality can serve as entanglement detector @xcite .",
    "consider the _",
    "operator @xmath105 which by definition acts as @xmath106 on @xmath107 .",
    "alternatively , it can be represented as @xmath108 where @xmath109 is the projector on the antisymmetric subspace of @xmath107 .",
    "then the obvious observable which measures @xmath110 is @xmath111 acting on the `` quadratic '' state @xmath112 composed of @xmath113 elementary subsystems , where each @xmath105 acts on one element of , respectively , first and second pure states .",
    "the above measurement corresponds to coupling each elementary subsystem of the first chain of @xmath1 spins , with the corresponding subsystem of the second chain and performing the measurement by projecting it on the antisymmetric subspace and then multiply the results .",
    "this gives the overall results of @xmath114 ( @xmath115 ) when the number of successive projections is even ( odd ) .",
    "now it is an elementary exercise to see that in this case the error propagation formula of eq .",
    "takes the form @xmath116 where we employ eq .   and",
    "the error propagation formula in eq .",
    "is then only by a factor of two worse then the best possible linear estimator .",
    "therefore , we got a quadratic estimator that reproduces - up to the constant factor - the scaling in @xmath1 of the best possible linear one .",
    "note that applying the above procedure to the original unitary perturbation scheme ( like eg .",
    "@xcite ) can not surpass the heisenberg limit , since the whole scheme may be simulated as a measurement of some new observable on the @xmath25 alone which is known to obey the limit as long as the part of the hamiltonian with unknown parameter @xmath8 is fully local , see @xcite .",
    "now the question is : can we employ the above approach for the case of bosonic lattices considered in previous sections ? fortunately",
    ", the answer is , at least in principle , affirmative .",
    "indeed , very recently it has been shown how to directly perform the measurement of the swap observable on the bosonic lattices @xcite . more specifically , the authors designed the beam - splitter type of interaction as a tunneling coupling between two optical lattices , followed by the measurement of the parity of the on - site occupation numbers .",
    "this guarantees that the observable in eq .  , which is crucial for the experimental application of the formula can be directly measured on the optical system with an effective spin hamiltonian having the critical parameter introduced by lattice shaking",
    "the system of ultracold bosons trapped in the quasi 1d optical lattice is subjected to the periodic driving with frequency fulfilling the resonance condition @xmath118 where @xmath56 is a small detuning from the transition between the levels with energies @xmath119 and @xmath120 .",
    "hence , the dynamics of the system is captured within the two  band bose ",

    "it is now assumed that @xmath139 where @xmath140 is the first zero of @xmath141 so that the hopping within the @xmath124 and @xmath74 bands is strongly suppressed .",

    "then the spin system in eq",
    ".   effectively describes the excitations in the mott space of the both laterally and vertically shaken optical lattice .",
    "we have shown that not only the scaling of the fidelity susceptibility at the criticality may be of the super - heisenberg type , but the corresponding  close to being ultimate ",
    "estimator around the critical point may be chosen to be a natural , simple physical observable .",
    "this may be viewed as a super - quadratic improvement achieved by adding the controlled two - body hamiltonian terms to the one - site part , where the latter depends linearly on some small , unknown parameter in a standard way as in eq .  .",
    "that type of improvement has no analog in the unitary perturbation approach well - known in the standard quantum metrology , see @xcite .",
    "on the other hand it is known that in the standard metrological approach the scaling may grow with the range of the interaction involving the unknown parameter @xcite , i.e. super - heisenberg behavior is in general possible if we replace the one - body operators in eq .   by many - body terms . however , it is not automatic since it is known that the most elementary ( product ) next - neighbour interactions in the case of 1d spin chain does not help in enhancing the scaling @xcite .",
