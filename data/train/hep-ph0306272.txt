    "the electroweak sector of the standard model ( sm ) contains only one cp - violating phase which arises in the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) quark mixing matrix . adding right - handed neutrinos to account for non  zero neutrino masses and their mixing opens up a possibility of new cp - violating phases in the maki - nakagawa - sakata ( mns ) lepton mixing matrix .",
    "in both cases unitarity imposes constraints on mixing matrices , which can be represented graphically as unitarity triangles .",
    "after many years of experimentation with the @xmath1 and @xmath2 mesons , the ckm unitarity triangle @xmath3 is essentially reconstructed and the required amount of cp violation can be accommodated within the sm .",
    "( reconstructing mns triangles will be far more difficult . )",
    "the cp violation in the sm also induces electric dipole moments ( edm ) of elementary particles .",
    "however , in the lepton sector could generate a very large neutron edm , unless @xmath4 is tuned to be very small . ]",
    "they are induced at a multiloop level and , as a result , edm s generated by the ckm phase are extremely small @xcite and beyond current and foreseeable future experiments .",
    "therefore the observation of a lepton edm would be a clear signal of new physics beyond the standard model .",
    "while the cp properties of the @xmath1 and @xmath2 systems appear to be consistent with the sm , another ( indirect ) piece of evidence of cp violation , the baryon asymmetry in the universe , requires a new source of cp violation beyond what is in the sm @xcite .",
    "thus new cp - violating phases must exist in nature .",
    "supersymmetric extensions of the sm based on soft supersymmetry breaking mechanism introduce a plethora of cp phases .",
    "this poses a susy cp problem ( assuming even that the strong cp is solved ) , since if the phases are large @xmath5 , susy contributions to the lepton edm can be too large to satisfy current experimental constraints @xcite .",
    "many models have been proposed @xcite to overcome this problem : fine tune phases to be small , push sparticle spectra above a few tev to suppress effects of large phases on the edm , constrain phases present in the first two generations to be small , arrange for internal cancellations etc .    in the absence of any reliable theory that forces in a natural way the phases to be vanishing or small ,",
    "it is mandatory to consider scenarios with some of the phases large and arranged consistent with experimental edm data . in such scenarios",
    "many phenomena will be affected : sparticle masses , their decay rates and production cross sections , susy contributions to sm processes etc .",
    "it is one of the main physics goals of future collider experiments to find susy and verify its cp properties @xcite .",
    "detailed analyses of the neutralino sector can prove particularly useful in this respect . in this note",
    "we will discuss the cp properties of neutralinos strengthening an argument of ref.@xcite that measurements of the neutralino production cross sections can provide a qualitative , unambiguous evidence for non  trivial cp phases .",
    "in the minimal supersymmetric extension of the standard model ( mssm ) , the mass matrix of the spin-1/2 partners of the neutral gauge bosons , @xmath6 and @xmath7 , and of the neutral higgs bosons , @xmath8 and @xmath9 , takes the form @xmath10     0         &      m_2          &    m_z c_\\beta c_w   & -m_z s_\\beta c_w\\\\[2 mm ] -m_z c_\\beta s_w & m_z c_\\beta c_w &        0        &      -\\mu         \\\\[2 mm ]   m_z s_\\beta s_w & -m_z s_\\beta c_w &      -\\mu       &        0                    \\end{array}\\right)\\ \\label{eq : massmatrix}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the fundamental supersymmetry breaking parameters : the u(1 ) and su(2 ) gaugino masses , and @xmath13 is the higgsino mass parameter . as a result of the electroweak symmetry breaking by the vacuum expectation values of the two neutral higgs fields @xmath14 and @xmath15 ( @xmath16 , @xmath17 where @xmath18 ) , non  diagonal terms with @xmath19 and @xmath20 appear and gauginos and higgsinos mix to form the neutralino mass eigenstates @xmath21 ( @xmath22=1,2,3,4 )",
    ".    in general the mass parameters @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 in the mass matrix ( [ eq : massmatrix ] ) can be complex . by reparameterization of the fields",
    ", @xmath12 can be taken real and positive ; the two remaining non ",
    "trivial phases , which are therefore reparameterization  invariant , may be attributed to @xmath11 and @xmath13 : @xmath23    since the existence of cp  violating phases in supersymmetric theories in general induces electric dipole moments ( edm ) , current experimental bounds can be exploited to derive indirect limits on the parameter space @xcite .",
    "in fact the experimental limits on edm s of the electron , neutron and mercury atom have been used to ( partly ) justify the assumption of real susy parameters , and most phenomenological studies on supersymmetric particle searches have been performed within the cp - conserving mssm .",
    "however , the edm constraints can be avoided assuming masses of the first and second generation sfermions large ( above the tev scale ) , or arranging cancellations between the different susy contributions to the edms . as a result ,",
    "the complex phase of the higgsino mass parameter @xmath13 is much less restricted than previously assumed , while the complex phase of @xmath11 is practically unconstrained . the possibility of non  zero cp ",
    "phases should therefore be included in phenomenological analyses .",
    "the neutralino mass eigenvalues @xmath24 @xmath25 can be chosen _ positive _ by a suitable definition of the unitary mixing matrix @xmath26 . in general this matrix",
    "involves 6 angles and 10 phases , and can be written as @xcite @xmath27 where @xmath28 are rotations in the [ @xmath29 plane characterized by a mixing angle @xmath30 and a ( dirac ) phase @xmath31 .",
    "for example , @xmath32 with @xmath33 , @xmath34",
    ". one of ( majorana ) phases @xmath35 is nonphysical and , for example , @xmath36 may be chosen to vanish .",
    "none of the remaining 9 phases can be removed by rotating the fields since neutralinos are majorana fermions .",
    "neutralino sector is cp conserving if @xmath13 and @xmath11 are real , which is equivalent to @xmath37 ( mod @xmath38 ) and @xmath39 ( mod @xmath40 ) .",
    "majorana phases @xmath41 indicate only different cp parities of the neutralino states @xcite .",
    "the matrix elements of @xmath26 define the couplings of the mass eigenstates @xmath42 to other particles .",
    "like in the quark sector , it is useful @xcite to represent the unitarity constraints on the elements @xmath43 @xmath44 in terms of unitarity quadrangles . for @xmath45 ,",
    "the above equations define the @xmath46- and @xmath47-type quadrangles in the complex plane .",
    "the @xmath46-type quadrangles are formed by the sides @xmath48 connecting two rows @xmath22 and @xmath49 , and the @xmath47-type by @xmath50 connecting two columns @xmath22 and @xmath49 of the mixing matrix . by a proper ordering of sides",
    "the quadrangles are assumed to be convex with areas given by @xmath51&=&{\\textstyle \\frac{1}{4 } }           ( |j_{ij}^{12}|+|j_{ij}^{23}|+|j_{ij}^{34}|+|j_{ij}^{41}| ) \\label{eq : am}\\\\ { \\rm area}[d_{ij}]&=&{\\textstyle \\frac{1}{4 } }           ( |j_{12}^{ij}|+|j_{23}^{ij}|+|j_{34}^{ij}|+|j_{41}^{ij}| ) \\label{eq : ad}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath52 are the jarlskog  type cp  odd `` plaquettes '' @xcite @xmath53 note that plaquettes , and therefore the areas of unitarity quadrangles , are not sensitive to the majorana phases @xmath35 .    unlike in the quark or lepton sector ,",
    "the orientation of all quadrangles is physically meaningful , and determined by the cp - phases of the neutralino mass matrix . in terms of quadrangles , cp is conserved if and only if all quadrangles have null area ( collapse to lines or points ) _ and _ are oriented along either real or imaginary axis .",
    "in principle , the imaginary parts of the complex parameters involved could most directly and unambiguously be determined by measuring suitable @xmath54 violating observables .",
    "neutralinos can copiously be produced at prospective @xmath0 linear colliders @xcite via the @xmath55-channel @xmath56 exchange and @xmath57- and @xmath58-channel selectron exchange .",
    "the polarized differential cross section for the @xmath59 production is given by @xcite @xmath60\\ \\label{eq : diffx}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath61=@xmath62 [ @xmath63=@xmath64 is the electron [ positron ] polarization vector ; the electron  momentum direction defines the @xmath65axis and the electron transverse polarization ",
    "vector the @xmath66axis ; @xmath67[1-(\\mu_i-\\mu_j)^2]$ ] with @xmath68 .",
    "the coefficients @xmath69 , @xmath70 , @xmath71 and @xmath72 depend only on the polar angle @xmath4 and their explicit form is given in @xcite .",
    "an interesting feature of neutralino production is encoded in the term @xmath72 of eq.([eq : diffx ] ) . unlike @xmath69 , @xmath70 and @xmath71 ,",
    "the @xmath72 is a function of plaquettes @xmath73 \\label{sigman}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where tilde means that in calculating @xmath74 the @xmath75 should be replaced by @xmath76 .",
    "the combinations of propagator factors @xmath77 are @xmath78 with @xmath79 , @xmath80 and the @xmath56-boson propagator @xmath81 is taken real by neglecting the @xmath56 width in the limit of high energies .",
    "therefore @xmath72 is nonvanishing only in cp  noninvariant theories and already",
    "the detailed measurement of the angular distribution of produced neutralino pairs in collisions of transverse polarized beams could indicate the presence of cp phases .",
    "however , since @xmath72 depends on plaquettes , nonvanishing @xmath72 requires specific form of cp - violation : the area of some unitarity quadrangles has to be non ",
    "i.e. _ at least one of dirac phases @xmath82 . moreover , the effect might be quite small due to cancellations between @xmath83 and @xmath84 higgsino components of @xmath42 and @xmath85 in eq.([sigman ] ) , and between t- and u - channel selectron exchanges in eq.([eq : normal1 ] ) .",
    "if the initial beams are not polarized , the cp phases could be inferred from the @xmath86 component of the polarization of the @xmath87 pairs produced in @xmath0 annihilation @xcite .",
    "the polarization vector @xmath88 is defined in the rest frame of the particle @xmath42 , with components parallel to the @xmath42 flight direction in the c.m .",
    "frame , in the production plane , and normal to the production plane , respectively",
    ". the normal component @xmath86 can only be generated by complex production amplitudes in the non ",
    "diagonal @xmath59 pair production process with @xmath45 .",
    "for example , the contribution to @xmath86 from the @xmath89 exchange reads @xmath90\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the normal polarization can be non ",
    "zero even if all the @xmath91-type cp phases vanish , _",
    "i.e. _ it could signal the existence of non ",
    "trivial @xmath92-type cp phases .",
    "the non  zero values of cp - odd characteristics @xmath72 or @xmath86 would unambiguously indicate cp - violation in the neutralino sector .",
    "however , their experimental measurements will be very difficult .",
    "on the other hand , one can also try to identify the presence of cp - phases by studying their impact on the cp - even quantities , like neutralino masses , branching ratios etc .",
    "since these quantities are non  zero in cp conserving case , the detection of cp - odd phases will require a careful quantitative analysis of a number of physical observables .",
    "in particular , for numerically small cp - odd phases , their deviations from cp - even values will also be small .",
    "as an example , in fig.[fig : quad ] the unitarity quadrangles for a particular point in the parameter space ( consistent with all experimental constraints ) are shown .",
    "the phase of @xmath13 is set to zero , and @xmath93 . in this case",
    "the quadrangles are almost degenerate to lines parallel to either real or imaginary axis , and revealing the phase of @xmath11 will be quite difficult .    in this respect , as pointed out in ref.@xcite , a clear indication of non  zero cp violating phases can be provided by studying the energy behavior of the cross sections for non  diagonal neutralino pair production near thresholds .    in cp - invariant theories ,",
    "the cp parity of a pair of majorana fermions @xmath87 is given by @xmath94 where @xmath95 is the cp parity of @xmath42 and @xmath96 is the angular momentum @xcite .",
    "therefore neutralinos with the same cp parities ( for example for @xmath97 ) can be excited only in the p - wave via the s - channel @xmath98 and @xmath56 production processes .",
    "the excitation in the s - wave , with the characteristic steep rise @xmath99 of the cross section near threshold , can occur only for non  diagonal pairs with opposite cp ",
    "parities of the produced neutralinos @xcite .",
    "the power of the selection rule ( [ cpparity ] ) can clearly be seen by inspecting the expressions for the total cross section @xmath100 ( @xmath45 ) near threshold    @xmath101    where @xmath102 and the kinematic functions @xmath103 in the cp  invariant theory , the imaginary parts of @xmath43 can only be generated by majorana phases @xmath39 and @xmath104 or vice versa , _",
    "i.e. _ the s  wave excitation is possible when the cp  parities of the produced neutralinos are opposite , as dictated by the eq.([cpparity ] ) .",
    "this immediately implies that if the @xmath105 and @xmath106 pairs are excited in the s  wave , the pair @xmath107 must be excited in the p  wave characterized by the slow rise @xmath108 of the cross section , fig.[fig : th ] , left panel .",
    "if , however , cp is violated the angular momentum of the produced neutralino pair is no longer restricted by the eq.([cpparity ] ) and all non  diagonal pairs can be excited in the s  wave .",
    "this is illustrated in fig.[fig : th ] , where the threshold behavior of the neutralino pairs @xmath109 , @xmath110 and @xmath111 for the cp - conserving ( left panel ) case is contrasted to the cp - violating case ( right panel ) . even for relatively small cp ",
    "phase @xmath93 , implying small impact on cp  even quantities , the change in the energy dependence near threshold can be quite dramatic .",
    "thus , observing the @xmath105 , @xmath106 and @xmath107 pairs to be excited _ all _ in s  wave states would therefore signal cp  violation .",
    "the supersymmetric extension of the standard model can come with new sources of cp violation . in the absence of natural suppression of the susy cp ",
    "phases , their non  zero values have to be considered in phenomenological studies . in this paper",
    "we have discussed the cp properties of neutralinos , which are quite peculiar due to their majorana nature .",
    "the cp violation in the neutralino sector can reveal itself in many different ways .",
    "the most ambitious analysis would require the experimental reconstruction of the unitarity quadrangles .",
    "since all phases of the mixing matrix @xmath26 ( at least at the tree level ) are ultimately determined by the phases of the fundamental parameters @xmath13 and @xmath11 , the reconstruction of the quadrangles would provide many consistency checks of the underlying theory .",
    "on the other hand , the first qualitative indication of the cp violation can be provided by the energy dependence of the neutralino production cross sections .",
    "the steep rise of cross sections for the production of at least three different non  diagonal neutralino pairs can be interpreted as a first direct signature of the presence of cp  violation in the neutralino sector . + * acknowledgments * + work supported in part by the kbn grant 2 p03b 040 24 ( 2003 - 2005 ) .",
