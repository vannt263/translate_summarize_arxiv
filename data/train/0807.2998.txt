    "our bolometric luminosities are well above the classic agb limit , and while both sources have no detected maser activity , their k - band amplitudes are inconsistent with supergiant status .",

    "two sources show evidence of hot - bottom burning , hv 2572 @xcite and hv 12070 @xcite , making them massive agb stars .",
    "@xcite suggested that hv 2572 might be a foreground object , but its radial velocity is more consistent with membership in the lmc ( p.  wood , private communication ) .",
    "the first step in our analysis is to classify each source into one of five broad categories based on the general properties of its infrared spectrum . each spectrum",
    "is then analyzed in more detail , using a method appropriate to its classification .",
    "we applied the classification method developed at hanscom field and introduced by @xcite .",
    "this system places a spectrum into one of five numbered groups based on its overall color : 1 for blue spectra dominated by a stellar continuum , 2 for dusty stars , 3 for spectra dominated by warm dust , and 4 and 5 for spectra dominated by progressively cooler dust .",
    "it then describes the dominant features in the spectra with one- or two - letter abbreviations : n for naked stars , se for silicate emission , sb for self - absorbed silicate emission , sa for silicate absorption , ce for carbon - rich dust emission , cr for optically thick and cooler carbon dust shells , and u for spectra showing the unidentified infrared ( uir ) emission features arising from polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( pahs ) and related material .",
    "we introduce a new classification , 2.st , in  5.6 .",
    "table 4 gives the infrared spectral classifications , which include the basic classification plus additional subdivisions and notes as described in the following sections .",
    "the overall classification determines the method(s ) applied to analyze the spectra and in which sections they are discussed . in  4 , we discuss the naked stars ( 1.n and 1.no ) and some of the nearly naked spectra showing other dust features . in ",
    "5 we examine oxygen - rich dust spectra ( 2.se , 3.se , 3.sb , and 3.sa ) , while  6 examines carbon - rich spectra ( 1.nc , 2.ce and 3.cr ) . finally ,  7 looks at the spectra with red continua and/or contributions from pahs .    distinguishing the nature of the dust ( oxygen - rich vs. carbon - rich ) is straightforward if there is plenty of dust , but for sources with low - contrast excesses , not only can it be difficult to determine what kind of dust is present , but it can be a challenge just to decide if there is an excess at all . to assist , we have measured the dust emission contrast ( dec ) , which @xcite defined to be the ratio of dust emission to stellar emission between 7.67 and 14.03  .",
    "they applied this method to the database of low - resolution spectra ( lrs ) from _",
    "@xcite noted that all sources with dec @xmath29 0.08 had clear dust excesses , while all sources with dec@xmath30 0.04 looked naked .",
    "the sources between these two limits were more problematic and could be described as `` fig - leaf '' sources , since they are neither naked nor fully clothed by a dust shell .",
    "we follow their example , but with some changes .",
    "as done previously , we assume the optically thin case , which implies that the contributions to the spectrum from the star and dust are additive . the better coverage to shorter wavelengths of the irs compared to the lrs allows us to shift the wavelength range for fitting the stellar contribution to 6.87.4  , between an absorption band from water vapor at @xmath16.6  and the fundamental sio band , which begins at 7.4  . as discussed below (  4 ) ,",
    "the sio band is much weaker in the magellanic clouds than in the galaxy , so instead of using a model spectrum with an sio band , we simply fit and subtract a 3600 k planck function to measure the dec .",
    "this also makes the method general enough to apply to carbon stars .",
    "while @xcite set the minimum dec for dusty stars to be 0.08 , we find that in the mc_dust sample , sources with a dec as high as 0.10 do not have a sufficient excess to identify unambiguously .",
    "we classify sources with dec@xmath310.04 as 1.n , while the fig - leaf sources with 0.04@xmath30dec@xmath310.10 are 1.n : .",
    "sources with higher dust emission contrasts are classified in group 2 , and in all cases but one , can be placed into the appropriate sub - category ( 2.se , 2.ce , etc . ) .",
    "three sources ( bfm 1 , hv 5810 , and wbp 77 ) have decs high enough to qualify as dusty , but we can see through the dust and investigate their photospheres .",
    "consequently , we will examine their photospheric properties in the section below on naked stars (  4 ) and their dust content in the appropriate section as well .",
    "two of our sources are identified as c / ir stars in table 2 , iras 05300 and iras 05348 .",
    "@xcite list iras 05348 as `` unknown type '' , but our irs data clearly show a carbon star . as noted in  2.2 , iras 05128 has previously been identified as carbon - rich based on its _ iso _ spectrum , but both our optical and infrared spectra reveal an oxygen - rich source .",
    "one source , macho 79.5505.26 , has inconsistent optical and infrared spectra .",
    "the optical spectrum is clearly carbon - rich , but the infrared spectrum shows no dust or absorption bands indicating its chemistry , which is unusual for carbon stars . for this reason ,",
    "we analyze it both in  4 and 6 . similarly , the smc supergiant massey smc 59803 shows both silicate and pah emission ( analyzed separately in  5 and 7 ) .",
    "figures 2 and 3 present the spectra of the naked sources in the smc and lmc , respectively . these include seven of the 11 smc sources and five of the 27 lmc sources .    many of these spectra are faint , which exposes us to background issues that would have little effect on brighter sources .",
    "the magellanic clouds are crowded in the infrared , with extended emission and a multitude of stray sources .",

    "between 250 and 700 days , the range dominated by mira variables , the galactic sample shows a general trend of increasing dust emission contrast with increasing period , but with a substantial spread . for periods less than 700 days , the magellanic sources show significantly less dust emission than their galactic counterparts .",
    "this result is consistent with the low sio molecular band strength detected in naked oxygen - rich stars in the magellanic clouds , since sio is the basic building block of silicate dust .",
    "magellanic sources with periods greater than 700 days typically show large contributions from dust in their spectra .",
    "in particular , five sources lie on or appear to continue the trend of dec vs.  period established by the galactic sample .",

    "we believe these four sources are more massive than typical agb sources and therefore younger . since they formed more recently , they are probably more metal rich than typical magellanic sources , and they would be expected to mimic the more metal - rich galactic sample .",

    "all three of these sources show silicate absorption at 10  , so our dec measurement , which is a simple sum , underestimates the total silicate contribution . correcting for this simplification would undoubtedly push these points upward in figure 26 .",
    "however , all three spectra show clear evidence for crystalline silicate emission at longer wavelengths , which as described in  5.2 , resemble the spectra from dusty galactic objects with disks .",

    "we shifted the long - wavelength range for fitting the planck function from 11.513.0  to 10.811.4  to avoid hysteresis effects in the sws data , which tend to drive the flux up slightly toward 12  . for similar reasons , we shifted the long - wavelength boundary for integrating the equivalent width from 11.5 to 11.1  .",
    "these shifts slightly reduce the equivalent widths , but the galactic sample still has stronger sio absorption than the magellanic samples .",
    "the mean sio equivalent width shows no strong dependency on optical spectral type .",
    "the second comparison sample of m giants comes from the ongoing irs gto cycle 4 program used to generate the sio template described in  4.1 . at the time of this writing , spectra of 13 of the 20 planned m giants",
    "have been obtained and reduced .",
    "we extracted the sio equivalent width using wavelengths identical to those used for the magellanic samples , but as with the sws data , we simply integrated the feature , instead of fitting a template .",
    "as with the sws sample , the equivalent width does not depend strongly on spectral type .",
    "the difference between the two galactic m giant samples may result from different selection criteria , but it is within the standard deviations .",
    "table 11 shows a general trend toward decreasing sio band strength with decreasing metallicity , although there is some overlap in the samples .",
    "the lmc sample overlaps the irs m giants .",
    "the wide spread in the lmc sample may indicate a range of metallicities , but the sample is not large .",
    "the smc clearly shows weaker sio bands than the galactic giants .",
    "these results confirm the metallicity - dependent trend first recognized by @xcite in the 3  spectral region .",
    "@xcite demonstrated with radiative transfer models that the amorphous alumina grains produce the broad , low - contrast features peaking @xmath11112  , which correspond to lower se indices ( se13 ) , while amorphous silicate grains produce the classic 10  silicate feature ( and associated 18  feature ) which corresponds to higher se indices ( se68 ) .",
    "the middle portion of the sequence ( se46 ) generally shows structured emission features , with a peak at 10  and a shoulder at 11  . this structure could arise from multiple causes , including mixtures of amorphous alumina and silicates , self - absorbed silicates , or possibly , crystalline silicate grains .",
    "given that alumina and silicates both contribute to the spectra , it might be more appropriate to refer to the sequence as the oxygen - rich dust sequence .",
    "figure 27 compares the distribution of silicate emission sources in the magellanic clouds to the galactic samples examined by @xcite .",
    "the magellanic sample differs markedly from the galactic agb sample by having only two sources from se1 to se4 .",
    "in fact , it looks more like the galactic supergiant sample than anything else , which is somewhat surpising given that the sample displayed in figure 27 includes only three supergiants .",
    "we had intentionally observed ten stars classified as s or ms , which we had expected to resemble the galactic s and ms stars , but most of these proved to be naked instead .",
    "of the five s and ms stars in the lmc , three ( wbp 104 , hv 2575 , and hv 12620 ) are naked , while hv 12070 is an se6 and wbp 77 accounts for the lone se1 source .",
    "of the five in the smc , only bfm 1 shows any sign of dust , but as discussed in  5.6 . , it is very unusual dust .",
    "the lack of emission from amorphous alumina dust in the magellanic clouds is consistent with how the abundance of al depends on metallicity compared to other dust - producing elements like mg and si .",
    "the latter elements are both @xmath11-capture products , and while their abundance is lower in metal - poor stars , al is even less abundant ( see * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "the apparent absence of a 13  feature in our sample provides further evidence of the relative lack of al in the magellanic clouds .",
    "the carrier of the 13  feature has been the subject of some debate , with the focus on crystalline alumina ( corundum , al@xmath0o@xmath39 * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) or spinel ( mgal@xmath0o@xmath38 * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite and @xcite have provided strong evidence against spinel as the carrier , but here , it is sufficient to note that in both proposed carriers , the al  o bond is responsible for the 13  feature .",
    "consequently , the lack of al in the magellanic clouds fully explains its absence .",
    "the presence of the 14  feature in our magellanic sample provides some clues about its carrier .",
    "@xcite recently noted that the 14  feature in hv 2310 could be reproduced by aln dust or possibly by non - spherical corundum grains .",
    "while the non - spherical grain models discussed by @xcite do shift the emission peak from 13  to longer wavelengths , the features become quite broad compared to the observed 14  features . in addition , the low abundance of al in the magellanic clouds make any al - bearing dust species an unlikely carrier .",
    "the presence of the 14  feature appears to be limited to strong silicate emission sources , which suggests that its carrier is probably related to silicates in some way .",

    "the total mass - loss rate is simply inferred from the gas - to - dust ratio , which @xcite assumed to be 200 in both the lmc and smc .",

    "figure 29 plots [ 6.4]@xmath8[9.3 ] color as a function of pulsation period , and it reveals no significant differences in the distribution of colors at a given period between the samples . in other words , carbon stars with similar pulsation properties are embedded in similar quantities of dust , regardless of their initial metallicity .",
    "the similar dust production rates among the samples in figure 29 have important consequences .",
    "the production of amorphous carbon is limited by the amount of excess carbon compared to oxygen , but carbon is produced in the triple-@xmath11 process in agb stars .",
    "the production of silicates and other oxygen - rich grains , on the other hand , is limited by the abundances of heavy elements such as si and al , and these are not produced in significant quantities on the agb .",
    "the ready explanation for the results presented in figure 29 is that the carbon produced and dredged up by agb stars dominates the carbon with which they formed .",
    "it should follow , then , that even population iii stars , if they are in the mass range to become carbon stars , will produce approximately the same amount of carbon - rich dust as their population i counterparts .",
    "@xcite discovered that in the smc , more agb stars became carbon rich than in the lmc ( see also * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "@xcite explained this phenomenon as a metallicity effect .",
    "stars with solar abundances will become carbon stars if their initial mass @xmath511.7  m@xmath52 , but at 1/5 solar metallicity , the mass limit has dropped to 1.2  m@xmath52 , primarily because of the lack of oxygen in the atmosphere of the metal - poor star to balance the dredged up carbon . assuming a salpeter initial mass function @xcite and integrating from these carbon limits to 8  m@xmath53",
    ", we find that in the smc , 70% more of the agb should be carbon - rich compared to a sample with solar metallicity .",
    "since we see no diminishment of carbon - rich dust production at decreasing metallicity , we conclude that the more metal - poor an initial population of stars , the more carbon - rich dust it will contribute to the ism , simply because it produces more carbon stars .",
    "many other properties of carbon stars do depend on metallicity .",
    "our small sample reinforces results from previous studies of _ spitzer _ spectroscopy in the magellanic clouds , which show that as the metallicity decreases , emission from sic and mgs dust decrease , while absorption from acetylene gas increases .",
    "the increased acetylene absorption probably arises from higher c / o ratios in magellanic carbon stars @xcite , which in turn arise from a combination of increased dredge - up efficiency @xcite and less initial oxygen in the atmosphere @xcite .",
    "the additional acetylene we observe may add even more to the amount of carbon injected into the ism by metal - poor populations .",
    "the behavior of the oxygen - rich dust stands in stark contrast to the carbon - rich dust .",
    "while the quantity of carbon - rich dust shows no discernable dependence on metallicity , oxygen - rich dust shows many clear trends . as metallicity decreases ,",
    "( 1 ) the fraction of naked stars increases , ( 2 ) sio absorption decreases , ( 3 ) the silicate dust emission also decreases , and ( 4 ) alumina - rich dust emission disappears almost entirely .",
    "the lower metallicity of the magellanic clouds provides a ready explanation for all of these effects .",
    "si is not produced on the agb , so its abundance scales with overall metallicity . as a result",
    ", we observe less sio gas , which is the fundamental building block of silicate dust , and less silicate dust as well .",
    "the abundance of al scales even more strongly with metallicity (  5.4 . ) , so the lack of alumina dust should not be a surprise .",

    "standard condensation sequences propose the formation of alumina - rich grains before silicates ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "several sources have an unidentified 14   emission feature , and one source , the only true s star in our sample , shows a previously unknown 13.5  emission feature .",
    "these two features are newly discovered by the irs , and their identification awaits further investigation .",
    "the magellanic clouds present us with a scenario of steady or increasing carbon - rich dust production as systems grow more metal - poor , compared to declining rates of oxygen - rich dust production .",

    "<S> we observed a sample of evolved stars in the large and small magellanic clouds ( lmc and smc ) with the infrared spectrograph on the _ spitzer space telescope_. comparing samples from the smc , lmc , and the galaxy reveals that the dust - production rate depends on metallicity for oxygen - rich stars , but carbon stars with similar pulsation properties produce similar quantities of dust , regardless of their initial metallicity . </S>",
    "<S> other properties of the oxygen - rich stars also depend on metallicity . as the metallicity decreases , the fraction of naked ( i.e.  dust - free ) stars increases , and among the naked stars , the strength of the 8  absorption band from sio decreases . </S>",
    "<S> our sample includes several massive stars in the lmc with long pulsation periods which produce significant amounts of dust , probably because they are young and relatively metal rich . </S>",
    "<S> little alumina dust is seen in circumstellar shells in the smc and lmc , unlike in galactic samples . </S>",
    "<S> three oxygen - rich sources also show emission from magnesium - rich crystalline silicates . </S>",
    "<S> many also show an emission feature at 14  . </S>",
    "<S> the one s star in our sample shows a newly detected emission feature centered at 13.5  . at lower metallicity , </S>",
    "<S> carbon stars with similar amounts of amorphous carbon in their shells have stronger absorption from molecular acetylene ( c@xmath0h@xmath0 ) and weaker emission from sic and mgs dust , as discovered in previous studies . </S>"
