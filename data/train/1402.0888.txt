    "the cold dark matter model with a cosmological constant ( @xmath1cdm ) is well established enough ( see e.g. , @xcite,@xcite , @xcite,@xcite ) that individual large - scale simulation efforts can be carried out that focus on just this one cosmology .",
    "we have also reached the point at which supercomputers enable numerical modeling of cosmological volumes with enough resolution to study the properties of individual galaxies . in this paper",
    "we report on a p - gadget hydrodynamic simulation of @xmath10 cubic volume , the massiveblackii simulation .",
    "it has @xmath11 mass resolution , cooling , star formation , black holes and feedback , and represents the evolution of a @xmath1cdm universe to redshift @xmath0 .",
    "numerical simulations ( see reviews by @xcite , @xcite , ) are the tool of choice to address many questions in cosmology , as galaxy formation is a complex non - linear problem .",
    "two criteria which must be satisfied for accurate results are :    \\(1 ) a large enough simulation volume that fourier density modes on the largest scales are evolving independently .",
    "the volume simulated must be a representative region of the universe , otherwise inferences drawn from it regarding such questions as clustering and the mass function of objects will be incorrect ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) . when @xmath1cdm models are evolved to redshift @xmath0 , then a volume of at least @xmath12 on a side becomes necessary to predict the overall star formation rate , for example ( @xcite ) .",
    "\\(2 ) high enough mass and spatial resolution that the properties of the objects of interest have converged .",
    "this requires many resolution elements ( particles or grid cells ) . if we focus on particle based simulations relevant to the current work , at the very least for identification of objects there must enough particles to overcome shot noise .",
    "if we require detailed properties of the objects such as galaxy spectra , or angular momenta then this can require many more ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "these criteria of large simulation volume and high resolution are more straightforward to address in the context of more restricted physical modeling . as a result , dark matter and gravity - only simulations",
    "have long been used to make cosmological predictions that cover both large and small scales in the same volume ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "semi - analytic modeling has been used to process dark matter simulations , resulting in many studies of the galaxies and their properties in the @xmath1cdm model ( see e.g. , @xcite , @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "baryonic physics including hydrodynamics obviously plays an important role in the formation of luminous objects and structure .",
    "this has lead to the inclusion of the relevant equations in simulation codes in many forms , smoothed particle hydrodynamics ( sph , @xcite ) , eulerian grid solvers ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite ) and hybrid lagrangian / eulerian schemes ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "although previous work has not simultaneously reached the combination of large volume and high resolution that we present here , research has progressed using many methods , including making use of zoom simulations of smaller volumes inside a representative one ( @xcite , @xcite ) , simulations that stop at high redshifts before large - scale modes become non - linear ( e.g. , @xcite ) , or by tackling problems which require lower mass resolution ( e.g. , @xcite ) .    the advent of large - scale computing facilities with 100,000 compute cores or more ( such as the cray xt5 , `` kraken '' on which the current simulation was run ) and the development of highly efficient distributed memory simulation codes ( such as gadget2 , @xcite ) means that simulations which satisfy both criteria ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) are now possible .",
    "we have run one such simulation as part of the nsf petascale applications in cosmology program , using the code p - gadget ( see e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "our aim was to simulate and analyze a large , representative volume of the @xmath1cdm model with the most important physical processes previously included in zoom runs or simulations with smaller boxes .",
    "these are hydrodynamics ( using sph ) , cooling , a subgrid multiphase model for star formation ( @xcite ) and subgrid black hole modeling ( @xcite,@xcite ) , both with feedback .",
    "our use of the physical modeling and algorithms used in previous work such as @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite enables continuity and therefore comparison with this previous work .",
    "our aim is to see what this `` fiducial '' model ( @xmath1cdm + gadget sph + the particular subgrid algorithms employed ) predicts about the properties of galaxies , their halos and their clustering at redshifts extending down to the present day .",
    "we have not adjusted methods , algorithms and parameters used in previous work ( e.g. , @xcite ) to try to tune to observational results .",
    "our goal is to see how this model performs , now that there is a large volume at high resolution .",
    "we naturally expect both regions of agreement and disagreement with observations and we aim that our work will offer guidance to future work to address the problems .    in this paper , we make the first use of the massiveblackii simulation evolved to @xmath0 , and use it to explore some topics in structure formation . here we choose to focus on topics relevant to galaxy and agn formation and large - scale structure , including mass functions , galaxy and halo properties and clustering .",
    "our emphasis is on lower redshifts ; the simulation at redshifts @xmath13 has been explored by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "topics that we leave to future work include the intergalactic medium , absorption lines , galaxy clusters and x - ray emission .",
    "our plan for the paper is as follows . in section  [ sec_methods ]",
    "we briefly describe the numerical methods and algorithms used to run the simulation , select galaxies and carry out stellar population synthesis . in section  [ sec_vis ] , we describe visualization of the simulation . in sections [ sec_massfn ] and [ sec_hod ]",
    "respectively we present the mass function and halo occupation distribution and in section [ sec_gal_clustering ] we examine the clustering of dark matter and galaxies . the properties of galaxies and supermassive black holes are examined in sections  [ sec_galaxy ] and [ sec_bh ] and we derive some conclusions from our work in section  [ sec_conc ] .",
    "we have used p - gadget , an upgraded version of gadget3 ( see @xcite for an earlier version ) which we are developing for use at upcoming petascale supercomputer facilities .",
    "this code was also used to run the massiveblack ( mb ) simulation ( @xcite . both mb and mbii are cosmological simulation of a @xmath1cdm cosmology .",
    "the major differences between mb and mbii are resolution and volume .",
    "however there are minor differences in cosmology between the two .",
    "the initial conditions for mbii were generated with the cmbfast transfer function at @xmath14 and the simulation was evolved to @xmath0 .",
    "the cosmological parameters used were : amplitude of mass fluctuations , @xmath15 , spectral index , @xmath16 , cosmological constant parameter @xmath17 , mass density parameter @xmath18 , baryon density parameter @xmath19 and @xmath20 ( hubble s constant in units of @xmath21 ) .",
    "these are consistent with the wmap7 cosmology @xcite .",
    ".basic simulation parameters for the simulation .",
    "the columns list the size of the simulation box , @xmath22 , the number of particles ( dark matter + gas ) used in the simulation , @xmath23 , the mass of a single dark matter particle , @xmath24 , the initial mass of a gas particle , @xmath25 , and the gravitational softening length , @xmath26 .",
    "all length scales are in comoving units . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "in this paper we have examined a variety of standard predictions using the recently completed mbii simulation . in particular , the results presented here range from the clustering of halos and galaxies , hod , the mass function of halos to basic properties of galaxies and agns .",
    "our main conclusions are :    * we find that halos with masses @xmath27 have a baryon fraction close to 80%-90% of the cosmic mean .",
    "the baryon fraction decreases steadily with decreasing halo mass .",
    "our results are broadly consistent with @xcite for cluster sized halos but differ significantly for lower mass halos .",
    "the discrepancy can be attributed to feedback both from agn and supernovae which were not been modeled in @xcite .",
    "* we find that the fof halo mass function ( where halo mass includes both dark matter and baryonic components ) in mbii can be fit with a universal form ( valid for all redshifts ) at the @xmath28 level .",
    "* one of the most striking results predicted by mbii is the behavior of the halo mass function which shows a strong suppression in the abundance of halos below the knee of the mass function ( @xmath29 which corresponds to @xmath30/h at @xmath0 and @xmath31/h at @xmath32 ) when compared to dark matter only predictions of the halo mass function .",
    "this is due to the significant impact of baryonic processes which tend to suppress the mass of the halo by up to 30% @xcite .",
    "* fits to the mass function from dark matter only simulations overpredict the mass function at the 20 - 35% level below the knee of the mass function at @xmath33 .",
    "* we have quantified the scale dependence of bias and stochasticity in the simulation .",
    "we find that scale of the deviation from a linear fit for both bias and stochasticity reaches a minimum at @xmath34 .",
    "the galaxy and mass density field can in this sense be said to trace each other most closely at this redshift . *",
    "the mbii overall matches most observed measurements of galaxy clustering with stellar mass .",
    "there are however some discrepancies in the bias at the lowest masses and redshifts probed .",
    "the simulation is consistent with observed measurements of stochasticity from combinations of galaxy clustering and weak lensing .",
    "* we find that the hod is well described by a power law behavior ( see equation  [ occfit ] ) .",
    "we find a modest evolution for the power law slope however the normalization mass for the distribution exhibits an exponentially decaying behavior with redshift . *",
    "the location of the peak and the width for the radial distribution of satellite galaxies decrease with decreasing redshift irrespective of the host mass of the halo , showing that satellite galaxies cluster more strongly around the central galaxy with time . *",
    "we find that the shape of the csed in mbii is consistent with observed data .",
    "the amplitude is however much lower and can be attributed to incompleteness at low galaxy masses in mbii . *",
    "the gsmf predicted by mbii is consistent with observations out to @xmath35 . at lower redshifts",
    "however the mbii gsmf is much steeper at lower masses whereas mbii over produces stars at larger masses at @xmath0 .",
    "* we find black hole mass and agn luminosity to be broadly correlated to host @xmath36 but with very large scatter , indicating a wide range of black hole properties for a given halo mass .",
    "however , the local @xmath37 relation is tighter and consistent the observed one .",
    "our results also imply very moderate evolution for the @xmath37 from @xmath38 .",
    "the global star formation rate density and black hole accretion rate density are also similar , but with a peak for the latter shifted to later times . *",
    "the bolometric luminosity function of the simulated agn population is broadly consistent with observational constraints ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see also ) .",
    "we note however that simple thermal coupling for agn feedback appears to quench the bright end of the agn lf too fast around @xmath39 whilst not being sufficient to fully quench the brightest agn at @xmath0 .",
    "the best agreement with observations is at @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "our results show a weak dependence of agn clustering with luminosity .",
    "( note that we defer to future work we to carry out detailed analysis of agn population ) .",
    "the mbii simulation is the largest simulation of its kind run to date with sufficient resolution to resolve @xmath42/h halos .",
    "we have found that the properties , such as hod and clustering are consistent with previous work and observations .",
    "however we find that feedback from agns is still not sufficient at lower redshifts to properly account for the properties of large galaxies and agns since it is unable to quench star formation in massive galaxies and the abundance of luminous quasars .",
    "however it describes the current state of standard sph simulations of galaxy formation and should be used as a testbed for improving models of galaxy formation .",
    "the parameters used in mbii were based on much smaller sph simulations which missed these large halos in their volumes and thus could not find discrepancies with observations at the large mass end .    at smaller masses",
    "the gsmf in mbii is very steep compared to observational constraints .",
    "a variable wind model based on the galaxy velocity dispersion @xcite has been shown to flatten the gsmf at smaller masses to better reproduce observational constraints at @xmath0 .",
    "however at higher redshifts these models still predict a steep slope . on the other hand we find that agn feedback is still insufficient to quench star formation in the most massive galaxies .",
    "the effect of agns is important in regulating the growth of massive galaxies ; e.g. the results of @xcite ( which do not include agn feedback ) and those of @xcite ( which include agn feedback ) clearly illustrate how agns affect the stellar content of massive galaxies .",
    "however these simulations are still small in volume and miss out on massive halos .",
    "it would be interesting to see their predictions when run on boxes similar in size to mbii . in subsequent work we will look at improving on the feedback models employed in mbii .",
    "one of the important effects we have quantified here is the effect of baryonic processes on the halo mass function .",
    "although we find that the universality of the mass function in mbii holds at the 13% level consistent with previous work , we find considerable differences in the abundance of halos below the knee of the mass function when compared to dark matter simulations .",
    "one of the natural questions which arise are : how do different models for star formation , black hole growth and feedback affect the mass function ? how strong is the redshift dependence ? what can be said of halo abundance matching techniques and their predictions when done with mass functions such as mbii ?",
    "these questions can only be addressed with simulations with different galaxy formation models and corresponding dark matter simulations which we will address in future work .",
    "the simulations were run on the cray xt5 supercomputer kraken at the national institute for computational sciences .",
    "this research has been funded by the national science foundation ( nsf ) petaapps programme , oci-0749212 and by nsf ast-1009781 .",
    "nk would like to aknowledge useful discussions with michael boylan - kolchin and erin sheldon ."
