    "astrometry has had limited application in s - vlbi @xcite , as the existing missions ( halca : @xcite and radioastron : @xcite ) were designed without the rapid beam - switching capability traditionally required for phase referencing .",
    "the vsop-2 ( astro - g ) mission was designed with this capability , but has been cancelled due to insufficient technical readiness , mainly in the surface accuracies of the main reflector that was required for the highest frequencies .",
    "the astro - g design , however , included the infrastructure for phase referencing , that is : the capability for rapid source switching with attitude control ( requiring a massive gyroscope ) and accurate orbit determination ( requiring the application of multiple complex space - craft navigation methods ) . in this paper",
    "we investigate the possibilities of using multiview vlbi as an alternative method to address the requirements and find that this approach offers a solution for these aspects of phase referencing s - vlbi on future missions .",
    "s - vlbi is recognized as one of the most challenging areas of vlbi , as it  as for all space missions  requires the manufacturing of complex technologies , which must be space certified to survive long exposure to high levels of cosmic radiation , which must be robust enough to survive the launch , which must be reliable enough to operate without maintenance for the full life time of the mission  typically 3 or more years  and yet be light enough to not overwhelm the extremely restricted weight budget of any satellite launch .",
    "in addition there are the complications arising from the sensitivity of the space - based antenna .",
    "this relate to the unfolding of a large parabolic reflector in space whilst ensuring that the surface accuracy is sufficiently high for observation at the highest frequencies and downlinking a large bandwidth of coherent baseband radio data to the ground tracking stations .",
    "furthermore for conventional phase referencing ( pr ) s - vlbi the instantaneous satellite position needs to be known to a high degree of accuracy . in @xcite",
    "a careful study of the requirements for pr observing at the astro - g frequencies of 8 , 22 and 43ghz concluded that orbital reconstruction needed accuracies of a few cm .",
    "this in turn required significant additional infrastructure both on - board and on the ground .",
    "that is a combination of multiple spacecraft navigation techniques consisting of an onboard gps receiver and a satellite laser ranging array @xcite . whilst the engineering problem of sensitivity is very difficult to address",
    ", new vlbi techniques can reduce the restrictions which arise from the weight and the orbit limitations .",
    "the rationale for s - vlbi is that it is the only method which can provide the long baselines that are required for the highest resolutions , where high frequencies are not an option .",
    "such cases would be particularly important for astrophysical emission lines at fixed frequencies ( i.e. masers ) , or sources for which higher frequencies are unfeasible due to their steep spectral index or changes in the structures under study .",
    "one of the best reasons for focusing on the frequencies around 1.4ghz is that the ska phase-1 site decision has recently been made , with both western australia and south africa being selected to host some of the ska - mid ( i.e. frequencies around 1.4ghz ) dishes .",
    "the australian site will host a smaller array with phased array feeds ( paf ) to perform un - biased surveys , whereas the sa site will host the majority of the antennas for high sensitivity targeted observations .",
    "both sites are expected to be capable of supporting phased - array vlbi observations , as this would be an extension of the pathfinder capabilities ( i.e. those of askap and meerkat ) . with a phased - ska core in australia and in south africa , with the former capable of forming multiple beams and the latter capable of forming multiple sub - arrays , high sensitivity vlbi baselines can be formed .",
    "high sensitivity improves astrometry , but on its own is insufficient to ensure it . with this as our driver we are investigating how to combined the phase 1 ska - mid with s - vlbi to achieve high precision astrometry . alternatively @xcite reports on approaches for achieving micro - arcsecond ( @xmath0-as ) astrometric accuracy with the high frequencies that will be provided by ska - hi .",
    "however the time line for the installation of ska - hi is not yet clear .",
    "pulsar astrometric vlbi is a well established technique which measures parallaxes and proper motions , providing distances and true velocities of pulsars .",
    "it is also a key science goal for ska , as vlbi observations of any discovered pulsar ",
    "black hole ( psr - bh ) candidates will be required to determine the precise distances .",
    "this will be an essential step in the detection of gravity waves from these psr - bh sources @xcite .",
    "these sources exist in the ` strong gravity ' regime and would allow for the testing of predictions of quantum gravity and the search for deviations from classical general relativity ( gr ) .",
    "the sensitivity of the ska will lead to the discovery of many ( estimated to be hundreds ) of psr - bh pairs , of which tens are expected to be millisecond pulsars . these , because of the requirements for their formation , will be close to the galactic centre or in globular clusters , that is at distances of the order of 10kpc .",
    "the full analysis for the application of all the gr tests depends on using astrometric vlbi measurements of the trigonometric parallax to independently determine the distances to these sources .",
    "therefore one would need to be achieving positional accuracies at the level of 15@xmath0as at the observing frequency of 1.6ghz @xcite .",
    "this is similar to the very best astrometric accuracies currently obtained at wavelengths of one- to , at most , a few - cm ( @xcite and the references therein ) .",
    "hydroxyl ( oh ) masers as well as water vapor ( h@xmath1o ) , silicon monoxide ( sio ) and methanol ( ch@xmath2oh ) masers are excellent tools for astrometric studies . as for pulsars , trigonometric parallaxes have been measured for 1665- and 1667-mhz ( mainline )",
    "oh masers associated with long - period variable , asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) stars @xcite .",
    "these are associated with massive - star forming regions , and evolved stars such as agb and post - agb stars . towards the galactic center , a large group of oh maser sources",
    "have been detected @xcite .",
    "thus the oh masers are also good astrometric tracers of the dynamics of the milky way .",
    "in particular , oh maser sources in the large and small magellanic clouds ( lmc and smc ) are excellent targets for s - vlbi astrometry .",
    "while galactic oh maser spots are spatially resolved in s - vlbi @xcite those in the lmc , at a distance of @xmath350  kpc , should be unresolved .",
    "there are 10 such",
    "oh maser sources known so far @xcite . a new oh maser survey toward the magellanic clouds , as part of gaskap ( galactic askap spectral line survey , @xcite ) , will massively increase the number of sources .",
    "it is expected that the proper motion of each of the magellanic masers , which are on the order of 100  km / s and correspond to a proper motion of @xmath4400  @xmath0as / yr , will be detectable .",
    "thanks to a larger sample size of proper motions in the galaxies ( @xmath5100 ) , the rotations of the lmc and the smc may be well modeled and the orbital motion may be unambiguously determined in an accuracy significantly better than the 0.1 mas / yr achieved in previous measurements ( e.g. , @xcite ) . furthermore , the measurement of the trigonometric parallaxes of oh masers in the lmc will directly determine its distance , and cement the first step in the cosmological distance ladder . to reliably detect the parallax ( @xmath420  @xmath0as , a peak - to - peak modulation of @xmath440  @xmath0as ) in the individual maser spot motions will require astrometric accuracies better than this level .      for both science cases the aim is to achieve approximately 15@xmath0as astrometric accuracy .",
    "theoretically the astrometric accuracy achievable , from statistical considerations , is approximately the synthesized beam - width over the signal to noise ratio , but in practice this is typically limited to at most a hundredth of the beam @xcite .",
    "the minimum l - band beam achievable with global ground baselines is of the order of 10 milliarcseconds ( mas ) which , independent of any other consideration , makes the required precision a very challenging proposition , as one would be required to super - resolve the beam by three orders of magnitude . any unstable structure at these scales or source position changes would contaminate the astrometric results , even if the methodological approach could in principle deliver that accuracy .",
    "the use of weak and barely detected sources as calibrators in phase referencing analysis will prevent the analysis of the sources for structural changes .",
    "this is in comparison with the well - studied icrf sources which have been monitored for structural variations over decades and at sub - mas scales , which is possible as they are also monitored at higher frequencies .",
    "s - vlbi baselines will be an order of magnitude longer than global baselines , and would directly resolve and separate structures with an angular scale greater than @xmath4mas .",
    "this reduces the challenge , but does not remove it .",
    "nevertheless resolving to a hundredth of the beam has been demonstrated in conventional cm - wavelength vlbi , so one would expect the same level to be achievable with s - vlbi and therefore provide the astrometric levels required .",
    "there are several approaches to deliver improved astrometric accuracies at lower frequencies : gps - based ionospheric corrections @xcite , wide bandwidth corrections @xcite , in - beam corrections @xcite and multiple calibrator 2d corrections @xcite .",
    "most astrometric campaigns have focused on the approach followed by @xcite where the dominant residual errors in the measurements are diluted by the proximity of the calibrator to the target .",
    "the ( relative ) astrometric accuracy of chatterjee s work is @xmath40.1mas , which is achieved by using a weak source within the primary beam ( typically @xmath410 arc - min from the pulsar ) and making the final calibration against those .",
    "although the proper motion and parallax are measured to high precision , the ultimate astrometric accuracy is limited by the unknown ( and unknowable ) stability of the weak in - beam calibrator .    to achieve higher precision astrometry with a single calibrator , it must be ten times closer to improve the astrometry ten fold . to achieve 10@xmath0as one",
    "would therefore need a calibrator within an arc - minute .",
    "estimates from the simulations of likely detectable sources @xcite predict that many sources will be found in - beam , but not so many that these would have the arcmin separations required for @xmath415@xmath0as level astrometry @xcite . alternatively , to achieve the ska goals , methods that use multiple calibrators have been proposed that interpolate solutions to the target line of sight .",
    "the combination of _ multiple _ calibrators as described by @xcite and @xcite with the use of _ simultaneous _ in - beam calibrators as described by chatterjee . such approaches to vlbi calibration are known as ` cluster - cluster ' or ` multi - view ' @xcite vlbi .",
    "multiview vlbi has been reviewed elsewhere @xcite , and here we only summarise the method and benefits . the multiview approach is to use multiple high quality calibrators arranged around the target , and to reconstruct the ionospheric phase correction required in the direction of that target .",
    "the interpolation of the required phases , accounting for linear variations across the field , reduces considerably the need to have the calibrators close to the target .",
    "that is the calibrators no - longer need to be closer than 1 arc - minute for a 10@xmath0as accuracy , as for conventional phase referencing , only that the phase screen is sufficiently linear that the interpolated solution is equivalent to this requirement .",
    "the approach is most suitable for calibration of the phase residuals from the ionosphere , which has spatial structure that is smooth over the typical separation angle of the sources .",
    "multiview ideally observes all the sources simultaneously so that the temporal variations do not unduly affect the results .",
    "nevertheless , given that the ionospheric variations are slow , this approach works even with fast source switching @xcite .",
    "we are currently performing just such tests with the australian vlbi network , the lba , and plan to also test the method with the vlba .",
    "we have found , in simulations , that by using multiview approaches we can achieve an order of magnitude improvement in the astrometric accuracy compared to using single calibrators , even when the multiview calibrators are separated by many degrees from the target .",
    "these simulations matched the preliminary investigations of @xcite , for which the calibrator distribution is shown in figure [ fig : sky]a .",
    "the improvement arises from the fitting of a linear surface to the calibration residuals and interpolating this model to the target position , which allows one to extend beyond the traditional ionospheric patch ( which is defined only by the difference between the phase at the calibrator and that for the target ) .",
    "if one includes attempts to resolve phase ambiguities one can extend the area of validity for the solutions even further .",
    "our approach includes this by checking solutions which include up to a few additional wraps of phase and determining if the new results are better than the original .",
    "in addition this approach removes contributions from many other major sources of calibration errors , such as the antenna clock contributions , the antenna position error , but not source structure and position errors .",
    "this calibration approach is different in character to conventional phase referencing , where the errors are diluted by the proximity of the calibrator to the target .",
    "the limitations in this case come from the deviation of the true phase screen from the planar solution , which for a particular source separation will become more and more pronounced as lower frequencies are used .",
    "we are currently attempting multiview calibration with long baseline lofar observations at 150mhz .",
    "lofar is also capable of providing multiple tied array beams ` pointed ' at different vlbi sources , and therefore will provide an interesting exploration of the method at very low frequencies .",
    "previously multiview experiments have been performed with connected arrays where different antennas , driven by a single time standard and under ( what is approximately ) a single atmosphere , are pointed simultaneously at different targets . as part of the vlbi science survey on askap",
    "@xcite we plan to implement multiview methods with phased arrays feeds ( paf ) as installed on the askap array .",
    "pafs solutions for wide - field surveys @xcite are being developed for a number of instruments including askap @xcite and wsrt @xcite .",
    "these devices allow multiple beams to be formed on each antenna , extending the single pointing of a conventional radio dish into an instrument receiving information from multiple directions .",
    "the beams can be arbitrarily ` steered ' within the field of view ( fov ) of the paf , which is many times the fov of the dish , by the electronic variation of the complex weights applied to the elements of the paf .",
    "figure [ fig : paf ] shows the paf constructed for the askap array .",
    "these devices are most applicable for survey projects , and the wide spread interest in paf applications arise because the large field of view optimises the ` survey speed ' svs : @xmath6 where @xmath7 are the number of beams , @xmath8 is the beamsize , @xmath9 the bandwidth , @xmath10 the effective area and @xmath11 the system temperature . assuming a fixed antenna size and system temperature the best returns come about by maximising @xmath12 .",
    "however there is also an exciting option in the vlbi field which we are actively investigating ; that of applying the multiview method in vlbi with single antennas equipped with pafs . this forms part of the askap vlbi project . in this case",
    "we are not fully covering a blank field evenly , but pointing a smaller number of tied beams at vlbi sources simultaneously , which are up to several degrees apart .",
    "the frequency range for which pafs will provide the best performance is 0.5 to 15ghz ; below 0.5ghz aperture arrays are more efficient , above 15ghz horn arrays can produce many beams with conventional approaches .",
    "astron , in the netherlands , uses a ` vivaldi ' based element array in a box pattern , forming a travelling wave slot antenna between two coplanar conducting sheets ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the approach on askap is to use a connected dipole array above a ground plane in a ` checkerboard ' pattern on a printed circuit substrate .",
    "each patch forms two orthogonal polarisations .",
    "the latter approach forms an extremely compact and robust structure and can be seen in figure [ fig : paf ] .",
    "we note that the paf for askap weighs 200 kg , but that is mainly because it is also a structural member",
    ". the weight could be much less , given that it is based around printed circuit boards .",
    "we have realised that pafs offer interesting possibilities in s - vlbi .",
    "multiview vlbi is normally considered in terms of correcting for the approximately planar ionospheric phase - screen across each antenna .",
    "but it also corrects for any antenna position error in the same fashion .",
    "offsets from the expected antenna positions effectively add a linear phase slope across the field of view , which is perfectly handled by the multiview approach .    the final piece of the puzzle is the recent development of paf technologies , which have the potential to make multiview vlbi a straightforward and effective method .",
    "the printed circuit board pafs being developed for the askap array by csiro are focused on meeting the wide field of view goals of the ska , but they are equally suitable for multiview vlbi .",
    "the new generations are falling in both cost and weight and are compact and robust .",
    "one of the most challenging aspects of the astro - g mission was to include the capability for source switching , which is essential for both detecting weak sources and astrometry , using phase referencing .",
    "this required the inclusion of a massive control moment gyro ( cmg ) . on the other hand",
    "the electronically steerable beams which pafs can form would allow the tracking of multiple sources that are several degrees apart , simultaneously , without the cmg , providing much simpler antenna operations .",
    "the combination of these new methods , new goals and new technologies offers the opportunity to develop a new science mission for space vlbi .",
    "we have run simulations using the software tools aris ( astronomical radio interferometor simulator ) and meqtrees .",
    "a detailed description of aris can be found in @xcite .",
    "it is an extremely complete simulator written for the astro - g mission , particularly to study the mission requirements to achieve various science goals such as phase referencing .",
    "it allows the determination of the required observing parameters , such as the switching cycle time , the source separation angle , the orbit determination discrepancy at apogee ( odda ) accuracy of the satellite , for various tropospheric conditions , and calibrator flux densities and structures .",
    "it generates _",
    "uv_-data for arrays of antennas , including observational constrains ( such as low elevation limits and downlink - station coverage ) . among its many capabilities",
    "it will generate datasets which are contaminated by the satellite orbit error , which is the capability we have used in our simulations here .",
    "it has a simplistic ionospheric model and , as we wished to explore more sophisticated ionospheric options , we generated the ionospheric contamination with meqtrees .",
    "meqtrees @xcite is a python based interface for the casa libraries , and allows the construction of many different functions into compute - trees in a straight - forward and efficient fashion . we have used meqtrees to generate the ionospheric models based on the minimum ionospheric models ( mim ) of @xcite .",
    "we have used the travelling ionospheric disturbance ( tid ) and the kolmogorov models , as these are designed to reproduce the full range of observed ionospheric behaviour with a limited set of parameters .",
    "we have simulated vlbi datasets with a bandwidth of 16mhz at 1.6ghz with two space craft in astro - g like orbits , plus the vlba antennas , to provide a demonstration which would match an attractive experimental setup .",
    "twin spacecraft missions have a number of extremely useful features , such as the absence of any atmospheric contamination on the space - space baseline and a rapid construction of a well - sampled uv coverage on the longest baselines .",
    "the chinese space vlbi program is investigating a twin spacecraft mission , and this drives our configuration .",
    "however the use of twin space craft has little influence on the astrometric investigations discussed in this paper , as they give an improved _ uv _ coverage that provides an improved reconstruction of resolved source structure . to confirm this",
    "we have investigated the astrometric accuracy achieved for both the full simulation , which stands in for a model of a possible ska - phase 2 configuration , and a reduced dataset which closely follows the ska - phase 1 .",
    "figure [ fig : uv ] shows the typical _ uv_-coverage in both of these configurations .",
    "the sources were all modelled with 1jy flux and the vlba antennas had thermal noised added based on their nominal sensitivities . in the discussions we estimate sensitivities which maybe achieved in the future .    as we are particularly interested in understanding what will be possible in the near future with ska phase-1 we selected a smaller array to realistically model the phase-1 response .",
    "this consists of only three stations , two on the ground and a single space craft .",
    "the antennas are separated by @xmath49,000 km as are the two phase-1 sites of ska - sa and ska - au",
    ".    40 m@xmath13.,width=529 ]    the mission design of astro - g continues to serve as a template for s - vlbi studies .",
    "the orbit parameters of astro - g were for a periastron of 25,000 km and an orbital period of @xmath47.5 hours .",
    "the mission design for phase referencing required orbital errors of less than 10 cm .",
    "this requirement was one of the more challenging aspects for the astro - g mission . in our simulations",
    "we have calibrated the data when contaminated by both a odda of 8 cm and 8 m , which are approximately the orbit error planned for astro - g and that achieved for halca , respectively .",
    "these two cases are shown in figure [ fig : orb]a and b respectively .    in the simulations we used the mim tid model with two diagonal sinusoidal disturbances , a residual total electron content ( tec ) level of 5 tecu",
    "( 10@xmath14 electrons / m@xmath15 ) and a 10% amplitude tid , at an altitude of 200 km with a velocity of 300 km / hr . this is shown in figure [ fig : wth]a .",
    "our most extreme weather model was the mim kolomogorov power spectrum with @xmath16=5/3 , an intrinsic tec of 10 tecu and a turbulent content of 10% , as shown in figure [ fig : wth]b .",
    "at this level , even with a self - calibration solution interval of one minute , the losses ( 13% ) start to become significant .",
    "good weather conditions are traditionally defined as having an allan standard deviation ( asd ) of @xmath17 at short timescales .",
    "our models have asd of 6 and 12@xmath18 at 10 seconds , respectively , confirming that they represent extremely bad weather conditions for the ground stations .",
    "other atmosphere models were explored but are not presented here , as they do not add to the discussion .",
    "figure [ fig : postcal ] shows the data with large orbital errors and poor weather , calibrated with the multiview method and the largest minimum angular separation ( 2.5@xmath19 ) , overlaid with the same data calibrated in the conventional manner with the source with the smallest angular separation ( 0.5@xmath19 ) .",

    "this underlines the improvement that the 2d phase correction provides compared to the direct phase transfer.,width=491 ]",
    "we firstly simulated the _ uv_-datasets in aris , with only orbital errors and no atmosphere .",
    "we simulated eight sources , with the sky positions as shown in figure [ fig : sky]b .",
    "the maximum separation of the sources was 5@xmath19 in ra and 6@xmath19 in declination , which matches the askap paf field of view .",
    "then we converted these id - fits datasets to measurement sets and simulated a common atmosphere for all sources with meqtrees .",
    "the phases from the calculated models were added to those of the orbit model .",
    "both the tid and kolomogorov models were used , the latter with a range of parameters . each of these measurement sets were converted back into fits format for analysis with aips .",
    "we analysed the case of orbit only , atmosphere only and the combination of these in our studies .",
    "only the analysis with all effects are presented here .",
    "the residuals for each of the eight sources were measured using the aips task fring and the solution tables were exported to a text file .",
    "these were read by an external script for combination with the correct weights for the source separation .",
    "we were particularly careful in the phase unwrapping ( as the fractional weights were not integer values ) and additionally explored the inclusion of a range of 2@xmath21 offsets around the initial results , to discover if a better solution could be identified .",
    "in this fashion we were able to significantly improve on the formation of the calibration via methods such as a linear combination of interpolations using sncor in aips .    from these sources on the sky",
    "six configurations were formed in which the ` target ' calibration was derived from the weighted combinations of other calibrators .",
    "these were made up of two triangular and four linear combinations which span minimum angular separations from 0.5 to 2.5@xmath19 , as listed in table [ tab : com ] .",

    "we have demonstrated a method which allows the highest levels of astrometric accuracy to be achieved at 1.6ghz .",
    "this involves the combinations of space vlbi to achieve small beam sizes at the required frequency , the capability to form multiple beams simultaneously on the antennas and multiview analysis to solve for the 2d phase surface .",
    "these approaches allow for the resolution of the sub - beam effects on the mas - scale described in section [ sec : req ] , which would contaminate and limit the astrometric accuracies , the removal of the massive cmg from the spacecraft requirements yet delivers astrometric results accurate enough to allow the measurement of parallaxes across our galaxy and out to the lmc .",
    "the major advantages for the space craft from the use of multiview methods with pafs are : i ) the mission launch weight is reduced .",
    "ii ) the source separations can be of the order of several degrees .",
    "iii ) the orbit errors can be of the order of several meters .",
    "we have therefore shown that the multiview method in s - vlbi can deliver the target astrometric accuracy of @xmath415@xmath0-as without the additional weight of a space borne cmg and the satellite navigation infrastructure .",
    "this will allow the measurement of the trigonometric parallax to psr - bh pairs across the galaxy and oh masers in the lmc .      as shown in figure [",
    "fig : err ] the orbit errors contaminate the astrometric results , raising the mean error for a 8 cm odda from @xmath48@xmath0as to @xmath420@xmath0as , when the odda is 8 m . as shown in figure [ fig : orb]b the phase rates introduced by large orbit errors become difficult to follow and at this point it would become hard to track the residuals .",
    "the halca orbit tracking was based on doppler tracking at ku - band , and produced orbit accuracies of the order of 5 m @xcite . a similar approach for any new mission should therefore be acceptable .",
    "of course an iterative process could be used to estimate even larger oddas , from the residuals , at the correlator , which would reduce the effective odda to a manageable level .",
    "such an approach could be attempted with radioastron .",
    "radioastron was not designed for phase referencing , let alone multiview astrometry .",
    "nevertheless we have considered possible approaches which could be used . with ground radio telescopes ( grt ) alternating rapidly between the four sources one would be able to remove their atmospheric contamination .",
    "radioastron , as it has an on - board h - maser , does not suffer from any atmospheric contamination of its own .",
    "therefore the cycle time between calibrators of the space craft could be considerably longer .",
    "even with residual orbit errors of 8 m solution intervals of 30 minutes allows for a 65% flux recovery . of course",
    "the observing efficiency will be significantly reduced as the space baselines will be formed only when the grt were observing the same source as the space antenna .",
    "the initial orbit errors of radioastron , however , are considerably greater than that of halca ; a recent estimate is 100 m @xcite .",
    "the errors arise from the influence of the moon on the very large orbit of the space craft , which prevent simple reconstruction",
    ". however one could perform a self - calibration to the space craft , of the best calibrator , after grt - only calibration .",
    "the orbit errors will be smooth and should be easy to separate from the atmospherical contributions .",
    "if these errors could be corrected for one source pre - correlation and the other sources are within 6@xmath19 ( 0.1 rad ) , the residual error will be of the order of a tenth of this absolute error .",
    "therefore our results with odda residuals with 8 m should be applicable to radioastron .",
    "we conclude that the orbit errors should be minimised as far as feasible , and that traditional orbit reconstruction methods should be sufficient for the multiview method to provide high precision astrometry .",
    "bootstrapped calibration of larger orbit errors should be feasible , but would need to be demonstrated .",
    "we have not directly investigated the effect of the ska baselines on the astrometry , as that would not be significant in the setup we have used .",
    "the sources were all modelled with 1jy flux and the vlba antennas had thermal noised added based on their nominal sensitivities .",
    "the ska sensitivities are required only to detect a weak source , which we would expect to be the target .",
    "the recommended procedure is that one uses strong icrf sources , which have been well monitored at a range of frequencies over a long time , to provide confidence in the astrometric quality of the calibrator .",
    "both the sa and australian ska arrays would be capable of supporting multiview vlbi , either by sub - arraying or via formation of multiple outputs from their pafs , along with conventional connected arrays such as vlba , atca , gmrt and wsrt .    with the ska site decision now announced we can make estimates of the phase-1 sensitivity . ska - au will have 96 12m - antennas with paf receivers whilst ska - sa will have 254 single pixel 13.5 m antennas . assuming system temperatures of 30k and 20k respectively and that the ska - sa antennas would be evenly sub - arrayed between the four sources for observation we find that these station beams have similar sensitivities of @xmath4500 m@xmath22k@xmath23 . for a bandwidth of 256mhz and a one minute solution interval such a station correlated with 10 m diameter antenna with a system temperature of 50k would provide a baseline sensitivity of the order of 0.3 mjy .",
    "this underlines that for space - vlbi , even when combined with the ska , will struggle to detect the postulated weak in - beam calibrators ; a consequence of the small diameter of any antenna capable of being launched into space .",

    "we conclude that s - vlbi missions can be linked to the ska ground stations and we believe that this will be the only method that can produce the high precision astrometry required for the fulfillment of the ska key science goal of the measurement of trigonometric parallax distance to psr - bh targets .",

    "<S> high precision astrometric space very long baseline interferometry ( s - vlbi ) at the low end of the conventional frequency range , i.e. 20 cm , is a requirement for a number of high priority science goals . </S>",
    "<S> these are headlined by obtaining trigonometric parallax distances to pulsars in pulsar  </S>",
    "<S> black hole pairs and oh masers anywhere in the milky way galaxy and the magellanic clouds . </S>",
    "<S> we propose a solution for the most difficult technical problems in s - vlbi by the multiview approach where multiple sources , separated by several degrees on the sky , are observed simultaneously . </S>",
    "<S> we simulated a number of challenging s - vlbi configurations , with orbit errors up to 8 m in size and with ionospheric atmospheres consistant with poor conditions . in these simulations we performed multiview analysis to achieve the required science goals . </S>",
    "<S> this approach removes the need for beam switching requiring a control moment gyro , and the space and ground infrastructure required for high quality orbit reconstruction of a space - based radio telescope . </S>",
    "<S> this will dramatically reduce the complexity of s - vlbi missions which implement the phase - referencing technique . </S>"
