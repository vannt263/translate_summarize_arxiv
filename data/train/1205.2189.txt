    "recent interest in studying nuclear spins was fuelled @xcite by the dephasing effect in gaas quantum dots which is induced by fluctuations of the nuclear ( overhauser ) field and blocks prospective application of electron spins for spintronics @xcite and quantum computing @xcite . among different approaches to this problem",
    ", there is a new tool that combines radio frequency excitation and dynamical nuclear pumping techniques to control the overhauser field and simultaneously to detect its state @xcite . in particular , this method allows to access directly some of the local properties of the nuclear bath .    at infinite temperature ,",
    "a connection between the line width of the nuclear magnetic resonance and the dipole interaction between nuclei in a crystal was established in @xcite .",
    "later , it was found that the line shape changes at low spin temperatures @xcite . a detailed understanding of the effect of a non - equilibrium polarisation , as occurs in dynamical pumping experiments , may give a way to measure directly the degree of polarisation reached under dynamical pumping and provide further insights in the effect of dipole interaction which plays an important role in the intrinsic dynamics of the nuclear bath in unstrained structures .    in present paper",
    "we address this problem by analysing the long wavelength spectrum of polarised nuclei using a cumulant expansion of the full line shape .",
    "we employ a combinatorial method to restrict the nuclear states to a fixed polarisation @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the number of excitation quanta pumped to the nuclear bath , and find that the centre of the resonance shifts linearly with the polarisation , @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the external magnetic field , @xmath4 is the nuclear magneton , @xmath5 is spin of a nucleus , @xmath6 is the total number of nuclei , and @xmath7 is a maximum field induced by fully polarised nuclear bath .",
    "the line width at a finite polarisation is reduced , relative to an unpolarised bath , as @xmath8 where @xmath9 is a fluctuating field induced by completely unpolarised nuclear bath and @xmath10 is a bell shaped function , @xmath11 and @xmath12 ; @xmath13 for @xmath14 and the line width shrinks slightly faster for @xmath15 .",
    "the third cumulant is zero when @xmath16 but becomes comparable to the line width at a moderate polarisation signalling the build - up of a line shape asymmetry .",
    "one way to suppress the dephasing effect of the overhauser field is to polarise the nuclei above 99% @xcite .",
    "so far the polarisation reached in dynamical nuclear pumping experiments is estimated indirectly via the hyperfine shift of the electron spin and , as reported , is still below the required threshold @xcite .",
    "the result of this paper suggests to use the shape of the nuclear magnetic resonance as a direct indicator of the degree of polarisation achieved in quantum dots .",
    "the vanishing of the broadening at large polarisations is caused by predominance of the exchange part of the dipole interaction . in the limit of single quantum of excitation above the ferromagnetic state the eigenmodes are plane waves with a sinusoidal dispersion , which allows to solve the problem of nuclear spin dynamics explicitly .",
    "we show that the observed line width of the nuclear resonance in a single crystal of gaas @xcite gives a bound on the shortest polarisation decay times for lateral quantum dots as @xmath17 s which is only an order of magnitude shorter than the @xmath18 s measured in these dots @xcite at @xmath19 .",
    "note that , in this bound , we neglect quadrupole and hyperfine interactions of nuclear spins . thus it is valid for unstrained structures without conduction or localised electrons .",
    "the paper is organised as follows . in section",
    "ii we approximate the model of dipole interaction between nuclear spins for a large external magnetic field . in section",
    "iii we analyse the shape the absorption line to obtain its polarisation dependence .",
    "section iv contains the analysis of single quantum of excitation above the fully ferromagnetic state where we establish a bound on the shortest poralisation decay time . in the appendices we give some details of the calculations in section iii",

    "the hilbert space is partitioned by a large zeeman energy into a set of subspaces labelled by the total z - projection of all spins , @xmath1 is an eigenvalue of @xmath30 . in each subspace",
    "the many spin states that have the same zeeman energy are split by a part of the dipole interaction that conserves @xmath1 ,    @xmath31    the matrix elements of the @xmath1 non - conserving remainder , @xmath32/\\left(8r_{ij}^{3}\\right),$ ] connect subspaces with different zeeman energies and can be treated perturbatively when the magnetic field is large . here @xmath33 are coordinates of the vector @xmath34 in a reference frame with z - axis parallel to the external @xmath3-field .",
