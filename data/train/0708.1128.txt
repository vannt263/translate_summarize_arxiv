    "what remains poorly understood , however , is the role that base - pairing and base - stacking plays in the transport and migration of the initial excitation along the double helix.@xcite    the absorption of uv radiation by dna initiate a number of photochemical reactions that can ultimately lead to carcinogenic mutations .",
    "@xcite the uv absorption spectrum of dna largely represents the weighted sum of the absorption spectra of it constituent bases .",
    "however , the distribution of the primary photochemical products of uv radiation , including bipyrimidine dimers , @xcite is depends quite strongly upon base sequence , which implies some degree of coupling between the dna bases .",
    "@xcite inasmuch as both the base stacking and base pairing are suspected to mediate the excess of electronic excitation energy , understanding of the excited - state dynamics is of primary importance for determining how the local environment affects the formation of dna photolesions .",
    "recent work by various groups has underscored the different roles that base - stacking and base - pairing play in mediating the fate of an electronic excitation in dna .",

    "@xcite give compelling evidence that base - stacking rather than base - pairing largely determines the fate of an excited state in dna chains composed of adenosine and thymine bases with long - lived intrastrand states forming when ever adenosine is stacked with itself or with thymine .",
    "however , there is considerable debate regarding whether or not the dynamics can be explained via purely frenkel exciton models  @xcite or whether charge - transfer states play an intermediate role .",
    "@xcite    upon uv excitation , the majority of excited molecules shows a subpicosecund singlet lifetimes .",
    "@xcite owing to the technical difficulties in measuring the ultrashort lifetimes the study of the charge and excitation energy transfer in dna has only recently received much of attention with the advances in the femtosecond spectroscopy .",
    "although , so far , no clear picture of the excited -state deactivation mechanism has been offered by the experiment , two possible decay channels have been investigated .",
    "kohler and coworkers in their recent study of the duplex poly(da)poly(dt ) suggested that @xmath3-stacking of the dna base determines the fate of a singlet electronic excited state.@xcite alternative decay mechanism involves interstrand hydrogen or proton transfer .",

    "@xcite the experimental results suggests that these very fast decay pathways play an important role in quenching the reactive decay channels and providing dna with intrinsic photochemical stability .",
    "however , they do not provide a clear picture which arrangement of bases , pairing or stacking , is of primary importance .    until recently ,",
    "most theoretical investigations of excitation energy transfer in dna helices has been within the frenkel exciton model which treats the excitation as a coherent hopping process between adjacent bases.@xcite this model has tremendous appeal since it allows one to construct the global excited states ( i.e of the complete chain ) in terms of linear combinations of local excited states .",
    "the key parameter in the evaluation of the electronic excitation energy transfer ( eet ) is the electronic coupling between the individual bases . to a first - order approximation",
    ", the base to base coupling can be estimated using a dipole - dipole approximation in which the interaction between the donor and acceptor is calculated using only the transition dipole associated with each chromophore . while this approach is certainly suitable for cases in which the distance between the donor and acceptor sites is substantially greater than the molecular length scale . in case of",
    "double stranded dna , where the dna bases are in relatively close contact compared to their dimensions this approach leads to the neglect of the effect of the size and spatial extent of the interacting transition densities associated with each chromophore .    by far",
    "the most precise way to calculate the coupling elements is to directly integrate the coulomb coupling matrix element between transition densities localized on the respective basis.@xcite the accuracy is then limited only by the numerical quadrature in integrating the matrix element and by the level and accuracy of the quantum chemical approach used to construct the transition densities in the first place .",
    "futhermore , one must perform a quantum chemical evaluation of the coupling elements between each base at each snapshot along a molecular dynamics simulation in order to properly take into account the fluctuations and gyrations of the chain itself .",
    "this is a formidable task , one that has prevented an accurate benchmarking of the excited state electronic structure of realistic dna chains .    in this paper",
    ", we present the results of simulations and calculations of accurate interbase exciton couplings for a - t strands of dna in water in an attempt to provide such a benchmark .",
    "starting from a molecular dynamics simulation of a model dna sequence in water at the correct salt concentrations , we mapped out the evolution of the photochemically relevant excited states within a frenkel exciton model in which the couplings were computed using both the ideal dipole - dipole approximation ( ida ) and using the transition density cube approach ( tdc).@xcite",
    "the calculation procedure consisted of several steps . in the first stage",
    "the molecular dynamics ( md ) calculations were carried out to sample a range of conformations of ( a)@xmath0(t)@xmath1 model of dna double - helix .",
    "the transition densities of the individual nucleobases obtained from time dependent density functional theory ( tddft ) calculations were subsequently superimposed with the instantaneous conformations from the md simulations in order to calculate the coupling between the electronic transitions of the individual bases . in the final step , the excited - states of the model were calculated within the frankel exciton model .      the excited states of the @xmath4 were calculated in the framework of the exciton theory@xcite . in this approach the total hamiltonian for the super system of @xmath5 molecules is written as the sum of @xmath5 hamiltonians of isolated molecules @xmath6 and the intermolecular interaction potential @xmath7 between the molecules @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",

    "one of the _ serious _ deficiencies with this model as it stands thus far is that for dna each of the interactions described is very sensitive to the geometric fluctuations of the dna chain itself .",
    "@xcite hence , we need to consider each of the couplings as being parametrically dependent upon the instantaneous molecular geometry of both the individual bases and the chain itself .",
