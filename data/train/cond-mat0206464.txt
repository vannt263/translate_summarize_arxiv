    ", the appearance of a multicritical point on the phase transition line is related to the interaction of two or more order parameters @xcite .",
    "correspondingly , the complex crossover behavior is affected by a competition between the diverging correlation lengths of the fluctuations of these different order parameters .",
    "the most well - known example of such systems with a multicritical ( specifically , tricritical ) point is the @xmath6he-@xmath7he mixture @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we investigate the phase separation of solutions of high - molecular - weight polymers in low - molecular - weight solvents in the vicinity of the @xmath8-point , which is defined as the critical mixing point in the limit of infinite degree of polymerization @xcite .",

    "later on , the mapping onto a field theory was generalized to solutions of finite concentration and arbitrary polydispersity @xcite .",
    "the scaling field @xmath12 , conjugate to the polymer order parameter @xmath13 , is zero along the @xmath14-line but becomes non - zero for finite degrees of polymerization @xmath2 .",
    "the second scaling field @xmath15 ( scalar ) conjugate to @xmath16 also vanishes in the limit of infinite @xmath2 and zero polymer volume fraction .",

    "in analogy to the @xmath17-transition in @xmath18he , one can view @xmath13@xmath19 as an operator for initiation or termination of a polymer chain at a point @xmath20 , thereby relating it to the concentration of polymer endpoints . on the level of two - point correlations",

    "the separation of a polymer solution into two coexisting phases has been qualitatively explained long ago by flory and huggins @xcite .",

    "it leads to the following helmholtz free energy @xmath21 of mixing of polymer chains and solvent molecules @xcite : @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the number of lattice sites in the system , @xmath24 boltzmann s constant , @xmath25 the temperature , while @xmath1 is the volume fraction of the polymer , and @xmath5 is the @xmath5-temperature .",

    "@xcite contains most essential features of real systems , namely : the crossover from mean - field to asymptotic ising - like behavior , the crossover to the ( tricritical ) @xmath5-behavior , and the variation of the effective critical exponents upon changing the degree of polymerization .",
    "however , the restrictions imposed by the free energy ( [ gflory ] ) of the flory - huggins theory are too tight to represent actual data within experimental accuracy .",
    "this is why here we shall use a more general approach based on the virial expansion of the osmotic pressure @xmath60 , which we shall renormalize so as to include the effects of fluctuations .",

    "it is interesting to observe that the data for all three systems with good accuracy collapse onto a single scaling curve , as is suggested by the solution of the unrenormalized coexistence conditions ( [ equnren ] ) indicated by a dashed line in figs .",
    "[ fig5 ] and [ fig6 ] .",
    "this is not necessarily to be expected , since the critical renormalization introduces two additional parameters @xmath133 and @xmath257 which may have different values for different solutes and solvents .",
    "one clearly sees , that the unrenormalized scaled coexistence curve fails to reproduce the proper ising - type singularity ( [ ising ] ) with @xmath258 close to the critical point , but instead has the mean - field exponent @xmath259 . in our second step in fitting the data we remedy this deficiency by applying the renormalization procedure as outlined in sec .",
    "[ critren ] .",
    "since the parameter @xmath133 was already found to be close to unity in a recent evaluation of light - scattering data above @xmath3 @xcite , and its variation does not affect the coexistence curves very much , we fixed it to @xmath260 , leaving @xmath136 as the only fit parameter of the crossover theory .",

    "our scaled crossover formulation nicely reproduces the ising singularity , but shows some deviations in the crossover region which can not be removed by tuning @xmath262 .",
    "one can think of a plethora of possible sources for such a deviation , since in our approach we neglected higher - order terms in expansions at several stages in our calculations .",
    "we truncated the virial expansion at order @xmath263 , included only first - order perturbative corrections in @xmath14 and @xmath79 , and used the lowest - order approximations for the temperature dependence of @xmath14 and @xmath79 .",
    "the influence of higher - order terms in the expansion of the temperature dependence of @xmath9 and @xmath79 and similarly of higher - order terms in the perturbation theory causes only a change of the scaling variable @xmath110 , that can not account for the deviation .",
    "note that both coexisting densities @xmath41 and @xmath42 of the renormalized fit are shifted to higher densities as compared to the experimental data .",
    "higher - order terms in the virial expansion , like a negative @xmath264-term can induce a shift of both coexisting densities in the double - tangent construction ( [ eqren ] ) to lower values .",
    "since we use the theory to volume fractions up to @xmath265 , it is likely that such higher - order terms in the virial expansion contribute to the observed deviations .      in the previous section we assigned values for the @xmath5-temperature that optimized scaling of the coexistence curves .",

    "those for polystyrene compare well with other extrapolations of critical - point data @xcite .",
    "we believe that the origin of the discrepancy again lies in the neglect of higher - order terms in our calculations .",
    "to discriminate between the relations ( [ pred1 ] ) - ( [ pred3 ] ) we form a ratio @xmath275 , by dividing the right - hand side of each equation by its left - hand side .",

    "the renormalized fits for ps in cyclohexane and pmma in @xmath232-octanone are indeed constant within the scattering of the data , but the most precise data on ps in methylcyclohexane clearly show a residual slope which can be easily accounted for by introducing a correction @xmath276 .",
    "this , together with the mismatch to the @xmath5-temperatures from coexistence - curve scaling , indicates the presence of second - order terms .",
    "our fits for the critical - point scaling are included as dotted lines in figs .",

    "we think this is unlikely since the value of the ratio is not altered by the leading order of tricritical renormalization @xcite .",
    "we have also analyzed a set of coexistence - curve data obtained from computer simulations of self - avoiding walks with attractive nearest - neighbor interaction on a simple cubic lattice @xcite along the same lines aswas done for the experimental coexistence - curve data in sec .",

    "deviate significantly from those for smaller chain lengths .",
    "one main difference between experiment and simulations is that the simulations were done in rather small boxes .",
    "these boxes were chosen to be at least four times larger than the maximum value of the radius of gyration . however , with the mean squared end - end distance of a random walk being a factor @xmath289 larger , this still implies that a single polymer stretches over a significant portion of the box , causing finite - size effects . also the rather small and varying total number of polymers , ranging between @xmath290 and @xmath291 for different simulations may cause problems in obtaining reliable bulk estimates , since large surface contributions are to be expected . on the other hand",
    ", we observe a clear breakdown of coexistence - curve scaling for the simulation data for the shorter chain lengths @xmath292 and @xmath293 .",
    "this is to be expected , since we then reach volume fractions where our virial expansion is no longer accurate .",
    "furthermore , the symmetric coexistence curve of the ising model for @xmath294 can not be scaled onto a asymmetric scaling curve with a finite reparametrization .",
    "the two fit parameters @xmath295 and @xmath136 of our crossover theory are not sufficient to provide a decent fit to the scaling curve , probably due to the reasons already discussed for the fit of the experimental data .",
    "more work has to be invested in order to decide , whether the observed mismatch is due to a limitation of the coexistence - curve scaling or can be attributed to systematic deviations in the simulation data .",
    "we find that the scaling description for coexistence curves of polymer solutions , including first - order perturbative corrections , provides a decent collapse of the available experimental data onto a single scaling curve at fitted @xmath5-temperatures which are systematically about @xmath274 higher than those obtained from an extrapolation of critical point data to infinite chain - length .",
    "incorporation of the critical fluctuations via crossover rg theory leads to a decent description of the scaled coexistence curve by fitting essentially only one parameter @xmath296 .",
    "we attribute the remaining deviations in the fit and the discrepancies in the @xmath0-temperature estimates mainly to two approximations in our approach .",
    "first , we truncated the virial expansion after the @xmath263 term , neglecting higher - order terms that contribute at larger volume fractions , and will perturb the scaling description as they do in the flory - huggins model .",
    "another source of corrections are higher - order terms in the temperature dependence of the bare parameters and higher - order corrections of perturbation theory , which have similar effects on the scaling variable @xmath240 .",
    "we find that both simulations and experiments are pointing towards an universal ratio @xmath297 , implying that @xmath4 has to be calculated at constant chain length @xmath2 rather than at constant field @xmath101 , which would lead to @xmath298 in the landau theory .",
    "the scaling description is less satisfactory for coexistence - curve data provided by simulations . concerning the @xmath5-temperature extrapolations we find from the simulation data the same pattern as for the experimental data , with the value of @xmath5 , obtained from the scaling description , being @xmath284 higher than the best value obtained from a extrapolation of @xmath299 .      the authors acknowledge a fruitful collaboration with v.a .",
