    "the existence of closed magnetic geodesics , and the magnetic flow in general , has been widely studied since then . some of the approaches to this subject are , the morse - novikov theory for variational functionals ( e.g. @xcite ) , aubry - mather s theory ( e.g. @xcite ) , the theory of dynamical systems ( e.g. @xcite ) and using methods from symplectic geometry ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "+ in the special case of surfaces , where the @xmath0form has the form @xmath9 , a magnetic geodesic of energy @xmath10 has geodesic curvature @xmath11 .",
    "this relates magnetic geodesics with the problem of prescribing geodesic curvature , in particular with the study of curves of constant geodesic curvature .",
    "this relation was used by v.i .",
    "arnold in @xcite , and later by many others ( see e.g @xcite ) , to study the existence of closed curves with prescribed geodesic curvature .    it is clear that on surfaces of constant curvature the curves of large constant geodesic curvature are circles , therefore closed .",
    "the study of these curves goes back to darboux , who in 1894 claimed ( in a footnote in his book @xcite ) that the converse is true , that is , if all curves of constant ( sufficiently large ) geodesic curvature are closed , then the surface has to be of constant gauss curvature .",
    "the proof of this result depends strongly on the fact that curves of geodesic curvature are closed for all large curvature , or equivalently low energy .",
    "this raises the following question , brought to my attention by r. bryant .",
    "[ bryantq ] are surfaces of constant gauss curvature the only surfaces for which all curves of a fixed constant nonzero geodesic curvature are closed ?    for the case where the constant is @xmath12 , this question corresponds to existence of surfaces all of whose geodesics are closed .",
    "the first examples of such surfaces where given by zoll @xcite who , in 1903 , constructed a surface of revolution with this property .",
    "+ using the relation between geodesic curvature and magnetic geodesics we can approach this question by studying magnetic geodesics on a surface , in the presence of a constant magnetic field .",
    "a first step in this direction is to determine if a surface of constant curvature can be locally changed keeping all the curves of a fixed constant geodesic curvature closed .",
    "we show in section [ rigidity for surfaces ] that the metric can not be changed in a small region without loosing this property .",
    "in fact , more generally , we show that a riemannian surface with a magnetic flow whose orbits are closed ca nt be changed locally without `` opening '' some of its orbits . + the easier way of changing the metric in a small region without opening the orbits is to require that all magnetic geodesics that enter the region leave it at the same place and in the same direction as before , to join the outside part of the orbit .",
    "this is the _",
    "magnetic scattering data _ of the region ; for each point and inward direction on the boundary , it associates the exit point and direction of the corresponding unit speed magnetic geodesic .",
    "+ with this problem in mind , we can ask the following boundary rigidity question for magnetic geodesics . in a riemannian manifold with boundary , in the presence of a magnetic field ,",
    "is the metric determined by the metric on the boundary and the magnetic scattering data ?    in general",
    "this is not true , even for the geodesic case .",
    "for example , a round sphere with a small disk removed has the same scattering data as a round @xmath13 with a disk of the same size removed .",
    "one of the usual conditions to obtain boundary rigidity is to assume that the region is _",
    "simple_. in our setting _",
    "simple _ means a compact region that is magnetically convex , and where the magnetic exponential map has no conjugate points ( see section [ simple metrics and boundary data ] ) .    for simple domains ,",
    "scattering rigidity for geodesics is equivalent to distance boundary rigidity ( see @xcite ) and it has been widely studied .",
    "it is known to hold for simple subdomains of @xmath14 @xcite or @xcite , an open round hemisphere @xcite , hyperbolic space @xcite @xcite , and some spaces of negative curvature @xcite among others . for a discussion on the subject ,",
    "see @xcite . + recently n. dairbekov , p. paternain , p. stefanov and g. uhlmann proved ( in @xcite ) magnetic boundary rigidity between two simple manifolds in several classes of metrics , including simple conformal metrics , simple analytic metrics , and all @xmath0dimensional simple metrics .    to be able to apply this results to local perturbations of existing metrics we would like to be able to compare a simple domain with any other ( not necessarily simple ) domain with the same boundary behavior . for this",
    "we prove the following theorem .",
    "thus , proving magnetic rigidity for the simple domains considered in @xcite .",
    "magnetic simplicity can be read from the metric on the boundary and the scattering data .    to change the metric in a small region without opening the orbits , it is not necessary to preserve the scattering data",
    ". it could be the case , in principle , that orbits exit the region in a different place , but after some time , came back to the region and leave it in the proper place to close up again ( see figure [ double orbit ] ) . in section [ rigidity for surfaces ]",
    "we look at this case in @xmath15 dimensions , and we show the following theorem .     twice . ]",
    "[ closed orbits implies scattering ] let @xmath16 and @xmath17 be compact surfaces with magnetic fields , all of whose magnetic geodesics are closed .",
    "let @xmath18 be a strictly magnetically convex region , such that every magnetic geodesic passes through @xmath19 at most once .",
    "if the metric and magnetic fields of @xmath16 and @xmath17 agree outside @xmath19 , then they have the same scattering data . +    applying these two theorems for a constant magnetic field on a surface of constant curvature ,",
    "we conclude that :    [ rigidity for constant curvature ] given a surface of constant curvature and a fixed @xmath20 such that all the circles of geodesic curvature @xmath20 are simple . the surface can not be perturbed in a small enough region while keeping all the curves of geodesic curvature @xmath20 closed .",
    "+      i would like to thank my advisor christopher croke for all his support .",
    "let @xmath21 be a compact riemannian manifold with boundary , with a magnetic field given by the closed @xmath15-form @xmath1 on @xmath16 .",
    "denote by @xmath22 the canonical symplectic form on @xmath23 , that is , the pull back of the canonical symplectic form of @xmath24 by the riemmanian metric . the geodesic flow can be described as the hamiltonian flow of @xmath25 w.r.t .",

    "in fact , @xmath34 moreover , the trajectories of the magnetic geodesics depend on the energy level . unlike geodesics ,",
    "a rescaling of a magnetic geodesic is not longer a magnetic geodesic .",
    "we will restrict our attention to a single energy level , or equivalently to unit speed magnetic geodesics .",
    "therefore , from now on , we will only consider the magnetic flow @xmath35 .",

    "this function is @xmath44 on @xmath45 but in general only @xmath46 at @xmath12 .",
    "the lack of smoothness at the origin can be explained by the fact that magnetic geodesics are not reversible . when we pass through the origin we change from @xmath47 to @xmath48 , that in general only agree up to first order . for a proof see appendix",
    "a in @xcite .",
    "+ we will say that a point @xmath49 is _ conjugate _ to @xmath38 along a magnetic geodesic @xmath31 if @xmath50 and @xmath51 is a critical point of @xmath52 .",

    "+ in what follows , and throughout this paper , if @xmath55 is a vector field along a geodesic @xmath56 , @xmath57 will denote the covariant derivative @xmath58 .",

    "this equation together with equation ( [ jnabla ] ) gives , for any such variational field @xmath72 , @xmath73    this equations characterize the variational field of variations through magnetic geodesics , in a way analogous to the characterization of jacobi fields",
