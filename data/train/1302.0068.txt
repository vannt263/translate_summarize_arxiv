    "the galactic tev sources with firm associations include high - mass x - ray binaries ( hmxbs ) , supernova remnants ( snrs ) , and pulsar wind nebulae ( pwne ) , and they can be point - like ( mostly hmxbs ) or extended ( mostly snrs and pwne , * ? ? ?",

    "@xcite reported two gev sources ( their sources e and w ) detected with the _ fermi _ large area telescope ( lat ) around but found that they do not match with the tev source in morphology or spectrum .",
    "instead , their source e has most emission positionally coincident with .    although both and are also x - ray sources beside their radio emission , there are other x - ray sources that are positionally closer to than them .",
    "@xcite reported detection of two highly absorbed hard x - ray sources with _",
    "suzaku _ , i.e. , ( our src 1 below ) and ( our src 2 below ) , only @xmath12@xmath10 away from the best - fit position of and suggested them as the plausible x - ray counterparts to this tev source .",
    "@xcite analyzed the _",
    "observation of these two x - ray sources ( and , respectively ) and obtained similar results .    in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* lwb12 hereafter ) , we carried out source type classifications of 4330 sources from the 2xmmi - dr3 catalog @xcite , which is based on  pointed observations .",
    "in that project , we serendipitously discovered a 2.93  hr x - ray periodicity from src 1 and a strong but narrow fe emission line from src 2 from three  observations of the central part of . in this work , after excluding src 1 and src 2 as the x - ray counterparts to , we search for other possible counterparts in the field of view ( fov ) , using the source type classification scheme from lwb12 .    in section  [ sec : reduction ] , we describe the screening of spurious sources along with detailed spectral and timing analysis of the relatively bright sources that we selected for final study . in section",
    "[ sec : res ] , we present the results of the source classification and the detailed properties of the sources . in section  [ sec :",
    "dis ] , we discuss the possible nature of the sources and the possible x - ray counterparts to . the conclusions of our study are given in section  [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "the three  observations that covered the central part of are 0503170101 , 0503170201 and 0503170301 .",
    "they will be referred to as obs 1 , 2 , and 3 , respectively .",
    "obs 1 was made on 2007 october 2 , lasting for about 54 ks , while obs 23 were made only six days later , i.e. , 2007 october 89 , lasting for about 31 ks each .",
    "these three observations had the same pointing direction , and the three european photon imaging cameras ( epic ) , i.e. , pn , mos1/m1 , and mos2/m2 @xcite , all used the `` medium '' optical blocking filter and the `` full frame '' imaging mode .",
    "the x - ray image combined from all these observations and the corresponding fov relative to observations in other wavelengths are shown in figure  [ fig : colorimage ] .",
    "sources detected from these three observations are included in the 2xmmi - dr3 catalog , with 524 in total .",
    "we found from visual inspection that the catalog has successfully included all significant sources .",
    "however , there are also many spurious sources because they appear in the straylight structures ( see the bright arcs and the blue stripes in the epic image in figure  [ fig : colorimage ] ) caused by single reflections of a bright x - ray source outside the fov .",
    "there are also other spurious sources due to problems of low - energy noise near the central line in the pn camera ( such sources are detected only in the pn image and only below 0.5 kev ) and noisy ccds in both mos cameras ( such sources tend to be detected as extended in the 2xmmi - dr3 catalog ) in all three observations .",
    "because the straylight structures tend not to completely match in sky position in different cameras and noisy ccds are camera specific , the spurious sources caused by these problems can show no emission in cameras that are free of these problems at the position of the sources , which can be used to confirm their spurious nature .",
    "we find from visual screening that about 150 sources are probably real .",
    "however , most of them are faint and have low statistics , making it difficult to study their source properties .",
    "thus in this study we only concentrate on 38 sources that have the signal - to - noise ratio s@xmath12n @xmath13 , or s@xmath12n",
    "@xmath14 if they are within 3@xmath10 from the best - fit position of , in at least one observation ( table  [ tbl : dercat ] ) .",
    "our numbering of these sources is given in figure  [ fig : colorimage ] and table  [ tbl : dercat ] .",
    "we followed the procedure in lwb12 to search for the optical and ir counterparts to these 38 sources in the usno - b1.0 catalog @xcite and the 2mass point source catalog ( 2mass psc , * ? ? ? * ) and calculated their x - ray - to - optical and x - ray - to - ir flux ratios , respectively ( table  [ tbl : dercat ] ) .",
    "the counterpart is chosen to be the closest one within 2@xmath15 or three times the x - ray positional error , whichever is larger .",
    "we also followed the lwb12 procedure to fit the spectra created from the band count rates included in the 2xmmi - dr3 catalog with an absorbed powerlaw ( pl ) , in order to roughly characterize the spectral shape of the sources .",
    "we created light curves for each source and visually searched for stellar x - ray flares to help the source classification .",
    "we used sas 11.0.0 and the calibration files of 2011 june to reprocess the x - ray event files and do the follow - up analysis .",
    "very short intervals of strong background flares occured in the pn camera in all three observations and were excluded following the sas thread for filtering high background .",
    "the final pn / mos1/mos2 exposures used are 46/54/54 , 22/31/31 , and 25/32/32 ks for obs 1 - 3 , respectively .",
    "for all sources , we used a circular source region centered on the source ( the radii used for src 1 and src 2 are 15@xmath15 and 20@xmath15 , respectively ; for others , see figure  [ fig : lcsum ] ) .",
    "the background was estimated from a large circular region , typically with a radius of 50@xmath15100@xmath15 , near the source in each camera .",
    "the event selection criteria followed the default values in the pipeline ( see table  5 in @xcite ) .",
    "we carried out detailed spectral fitting and timing analysis for sources that we find to be possibly compact object systems containing a white dwarf ( wd ) , a neutron star ( ns ) , or a stellar - mass black hole ( bh ) .",
    "as their spectra are in general hard , we only used an absorbed pl to fit their continuum . to improve the statistics and considering that obs 2 and obs 3 are relatively short and close in time ( in one day ) , the spectra of both observations were added together for each camera .",
    "we rebinned the spectra to have at least 20 counts in each bin so as to adopt the @xmath16 statistic for the spectral fits .",
    "to search for x - ray periodicity , we created the leahy power @xcite from the light curves that combined all epic cameras and were extracted from the source region .",
    "we used a binsize of 2.6 s ( the frame readout time of the mos cameras ) .",
    "although the pn camera has a higher time resolution ( 73.4 ms ) and using data exclusively from this camera allows to search for periodicities at higher frequencies , we found no powers above a 99.9% confidence level at high frequencies .",
    "thus only results using light curves binned at 2.6 s and combining all epic cameras will be shown .    to constrain the values of their periods and examine the profiles of the modulation",
    ", we employed the epoch folding search technique .",
    "the phase folded background - subtracted light curve was obtained by subtracting the folded light curve from the background region ( after being rescaled to the size of the source region ) from the folded light curve from the source region combining all epic cameras .",
    "the spectra of src 1 are well fitted with an absorbed pl model with photon indices @xmath17 and the column density @xmath18 @xmath5 ( table  [ tbl : spfit ] ) .",
    "the average flux in obs 1 is slightly higher ( a few tens of percent ) than that in obs 23 .",
    "the timing properties of src 1 are shown in figure  [ fig:254026foldcurve ] , and we see strong powers at a period of @xmath19@xmath2010531  s ( i.e. , 2.93  hr ) and its harmonics ( especially @xmath19/3 ) in both obs 1 and obs 23 . such a periodic behavior can also be seen in the light curves in the same figure . the pulse profile shows double peaks with comparable maxima and does not seem to vary over the observations ( figure  [ fig:254026foldcurve ] ) .",
    "the count rate is consistent with zero in the two low phases , with one lasting for about one third of the period and the other very brief ( @xmath13% of the period ) .",
    "the pulse profile seems to vary slightly with energy .",
    "the fits to the spectra of src 2 with an absorbed pl show strong residuals around the fe line energy 67 kev ( figure  [ fig : s253961spfits ] ) , resulting in high values of @xmath21 ( @xmath11.5 , table  [ tbl : spfit ] ) .",
    "thus we added a gaussian line to the fits .",
    "we saw no significant variation of the line centroid energy @xmath22 and fwhm @xmath23 between obs 1 and obs 23 .",
    "thus we chose to tie these parameters to be the same in these observations in the final fits , to have better constraints on them .",
    "we obtained good fits with small photon indices ( @xmath10.7 ) and large equivalent widths ( ews ) of the fe line ( @xmath10.8 kev ) in both obs 1 and obs 23 ( table  [ tbl : spfit ] and figure  [ fig : s253961spfits ] ) .",
    "the timing properties of src 2 are shown in figure  [ fig:253961foldcurve ] .",
    "we see large variability of the source on timescales of about ten hours .",
    "the epoch folding search technique suggests a @xmath111.4 hr period ( figure  [ fig:253961foldcurve ] ) , which , however , needs to be confirmed with longer observations .",
    "the results of multi - wavelength cross - correlation and simple x - ray spectral fits are given in table  [ tbl : dercat ] .",
    "optical and ir counterparts were found for most of the 38 sources .",
    "the light curves of 14 sources with some flaring activity are shown in the bottom panels of figure  [ fig : lcsum ] .",
    "stellar flares tend to show a fast rise and a slow decay , as we see in sources like src 7 , 18 , and 25 , while most of the others do not have such a structure but only exhibit the rise or the decay , due to observation gaps . in lwb12",
    ", sources with the x - ray - to - ir flux ratio logarithm @xmath24 ( table  [ tbl : dercat ] ) less than @xmath25 and/or with stellar x - ray flares are classified as stars . following this scheme , we have 32 candidate stars , based on table  [ tbl : dercat ] and figure  [ fig : lcsum ] .",
    "these stars generally have very soft x - ray spectra ( @xmath26 in table  [ tbl : dercat ] ) and thus mostly appear green in the x - ray colored image in figure  [ fig : colorimage ] .",
    "their spectra become harder when there are stellar flares in the light curves .",
    "some sources ( e.g. , src 47 ) were detected because of flares .",
    "the other six sources ( src 1 , 2 , 27 , 30 , 34 and 36 ) are candidate compact objects .",
    "we ruled them out as being agn , considering that they appear in the galactic plane and that their x - ray spectra are hard ( lwb12 ) .",
    "src 27 is .",
    "similar to src 1 and src 2 , we calculated the leahy powers for the latter four sources but found no strong power above the 99.9%-confidence level in the frequency range of @xmath270.5 hz .",
    "the light curves , plotted in figure  [ fig : lcsum ] , exhibit little variability .",
    "we note that for we did not use the pn data because the source falls across the ccd gap and near the bright arc ( figure  [ fig : colorimage ] ) in all observations .",
    "we also carried out detailed spectral fits for these sources .",
    "the results are given in table  [ tbl : spfit ] .",
    "src 30 , 34 and 36 are all hard ( @xmath28 ) and heavily absorbed ( @xmath29@xmath30 @xmath5 ) . for src 34 and src 36 , adding a narrow fe line improves the fits , similar to src 2 .    in figure",
    "[ fig : colorimage ] , many other ( fainter ) point sources can be seen .",
    "most of them appear green ( thus soft ) and are probably stars .",
    "we note that the 2xmmi - dr3 catalog also includes 113 extended sources ( with the extent radius greater than 6@xmath15 in at least one of the three observations ) .",
    "however , they are all probably spurious , because most of them appear in the straylight structures , while others ( typically with s@xmath12n around 5 ) seem to be caused by noisy mos ccds or bright sources .",
    "thus none of these extended sources are included in our 38 sources .",
    "there are studies of observations of the field around by other x - ray observatories . here",
    "we briefly compare their results with ours , focusing on the properties of src 1 and src 2 . in the _ chandra _ 2005 - 05 - 04 observation ,",
    "@xcite saw a weak and possibly extended / multiple source ( ) with a size of 1.5@xmath102@xmath10 and the centriod only 3@xmath15 away from src 1 .",
    "they also found the source , which has a 95% positional error of 1@xmath314 and is only 09 away from src 2 , based on the position information from the _ chandra _ source catalog ( release 1.1 , * ? ? ? * ) . in",
    "the _ swift _ 2005 - 11 - 03 observation ( 12 ks ) studied by @xcite , no source near src 1 was detected above 3@xmath32 , but they found a source ( their src 3 ( sw3 hereafter ) , with a positional error of 5@xmath15 ) 7@xmath15 away from src 2 . in the _ suzaku _ 2006 - 04 - 06 observation ( 40 ks ) , @xcite found two sources , and , 34@xmath15 and 23@xmath15 away from src 1 and src 2 , respectively ( the _ suzaku _ systematic positional uncertainty is 1@xmath10 ) , with claimed to be extended / multiple .",
    "based on the positional coincidence , and are probably the same source as src 1 , and , sw3 , and are probably the same source as src 2 . considering that both src 1 and src 2 are point - like with the extent radius @xmath33 from the 2xmmi - dr3 catalog , which is supported by the large x - ray modulations on timescales of hours seen in both sources , the extended / multiple feature of and are probably due to contamination emission from nearby stars or noisy background . for , the contaminating source could be the flaring star src 6 ( 34@xmath15 away from src 1 ) , and for , it could be the bright star src 11 ( @xmath34 away from src 2 ) , which seems to be persistent and has no flare observed by us .",
    "the fluxes of the candidate counterparts to src 1 and src 2 estimated by the above studies are within a factor of about two of those that we obtained here , indicating a fairly constant flux level for both sources over about two years .",
    "this is not in conflict with the non - detection of src 1 in the _ swift _ 2005 - 11 - 03 observation , considering that this observation only detected src 2 , which has a flux five times more than src 1 , at only 4@xmath32 .",
    "@xcite fitted the spectrum of with an absorbed pl and inferred a harder spectrum ( @xmath35 ) than src 1 , but this could be caused by background contamination , which could be a serious issue due to the low statistics of .",
    "the fit of by @xcite and that of by @xcite using an absorbed pl both inferred an absorption column density and a photon index with large error bars but fully consistent with those that we obtained for src 2 .",
    "we note that @xcite and @xcite did not need an fe line in their spectral fits , probably due to the low statistics of their data . concerning the timing properties",
    ", @xcite found a 106 s period candidate at only 2.3@xmath32 for , which we were unable to confirm in either obs 1 or obs 23 of src 2 ( figure  [ fig:253961foldcurve ] ) .",
    "it could be because this periodicity is not real or is intermittent .",
    "considering that the galactic tev sources with firm associations are mostly hmxbs , snrs and pwne , @xcite and @xcite discussed both src 1 and src 2 in terms of these source types as the x - ray counterparts to .",
    "however , the large x - ray modulation on timescales of hours observed by us in these two sources excludes them from being snrs or pwne .",
    "it is unlikely that src 1 is a hmxb for several reasons .",
    "its 2.93  hr x - ray period is too short to be the orbital period , because hmxbs mostly have orbital periods longer than one day @xcite ( but this can not exclude it as a low - mass x - ray binary like the pulsar ) .",
    "this period seems too long to be the ns spin period either ( the slowest pulsar known is , with a spin period of 1412  s @xcite ) .",
    "it has a long low phase in the pulse profile , which is rarely seen in hmxbs ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "its 0.310.0 kev unabsorbed luminosity is about @xmath36 erg s@xmath4 ( assuming a source distance of 8 kpc ) , which is too low for accretion - powered x - ray pulsars ( typically higher than @xmath37 erg s@xmath4 , * ? ? ?",
    "considering the low luminosity and the hard spectra , we suggest src 1 to be a magnetic cataclysmic variable ( cv ; polar or intermediate polar ) . the 2.93  hr period could be either the orbital period or the spin period of the wd ( they are the same for polars ) .",
    "further , the observed pulse profile is similar to those of some eclipsing polars at high energies ( above 1 kev ) , e.g. , the eclipsing polar ( see figure  3 in * ? ? ?",
    "the light curve would then be dominated by a single bright phase interval ( phase 0.20.8 in figure  [ fig:254026foldcurve ] ) of a self - eclipsing pole , with the short low period ( phase around 0.6 ) caused by the eclipse of the accretion region by the secondary star .",
    "we checked whether an fe emission line is present in the spectra of src 1 by adding a gaussian emission line to the spectral fits , considering that magnetic cvs often exhibit fe emission lines with ews typical of a few hundred ev @xcite . we found that adding the line did not improve the fits ( the total @xmath16 values decreased by less than 2 for both obs 1 and obs 2 - 3 ) , but we also obtained very high ew upper limits ( @xmath11.4 kev , at a 90% confidence level ) .",
    "thus we can not rule out the presence of fe emission lines in src 1 at the level often seen in magnetic cvs .",
    "src 2 has a 0.310.0 kev unabsorbed luminosity of about 6@xmath2@xmath36 erg s@xmath4 , assuming a source distance of 8 kpc .",
    "such a luminosity also seems low for a hmxb .",
    "its fe emission line is also stronger than most hmxbs ( ew@xmath38100 ev , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , while it is close to typical values seen in magnetic cvs @xcite .",
    "in fact , sources with an x - ray luminosity , a hard spectrum , and a strong fe emission line like src 2 are commonly seen toward the galactic center , and @xcite argued that they are most likely intermediate polars .",
    "src 2 is probably one such object .",
    "src 30 , 34 and 36 have similar low luminosities ( also assuming a distance of 8 kpc ) and hard spectra like src 1 and src 2 .",
    "thus they are probably magnetic cvs too .",
    "although they have steady light curves and may be rotation - powered pulsars like , we do not favor this interpretation because the rotation - powered pulsars tend to have @xmath39 ( * ? ? ?",

    "six times more exposure , obs 1 - 3 failed to detect extended thermal x - ray emission as seen in observation 0405750201 . this could be due to spatial variation in absorption , which , however , was not supported by @xcite , because they observed no significant spatial correlation between the intensity and the hardness ratio of the x - ray emission .",
    "alternatively , x - ray emission from the snr can be intrinsically very weak , considering its low surface brightness .",

    "we focus on two x - ray sources ( src 1 and src 2 ) that were suggested to be the counterparts to the tev source .",
