    "in spite that in recent years many different experimental techniques have been established , single molecule spectroscopy ( sms ) barkaichem , michel , jung , that is , the study of single nano - objects is predominantly realized by purely optical methods , i.e. , by measuring the far - electromagnetic field scattered by the system when it is subjected to laser radiation .",
    "in contrast to standard quantum optical systems breuerbook , carmichaelbook , milburn , scully , loudon , yariv , where the reservoir is only defined by the background ( free ) quantized electromagnetic field , in sms the supporting nano - environment is highly structured .",
    "its definition and specific properties depend on each experimental setup .",
    "in fact , the local environment felt by the fluorophore may involve cryogenic single - molecules @xcite , molecules at room temperature , either immobilized @xcite or diffusing in solution elson , the solid state matrix supporting a nanocrystal nirmal , pmichler , brokmann , verberk , kuno , potatova , cichoslaser , cichos , vanorden , bianco , or single bio - molecules dickson , xie , wemoerner , caoyang , lu , sweiss , valle .",
    "even more , the proper definition of the background electromagnetic field may be modified because the local surrounding of the system may develop fluctuations in its dielectric properties @xcite .",
    "each specific environment leads to different underlying physical or chemical processes that in turn modify the emission properties of the fluorophore . in most of the situations",
    ", it can be model as a two - level optical transition .",
    "the central theoretical problem of sms is to relate the scattered laser field statistics with the underlying nanoscopic environment dynamic . due to its complexity",
    ", its dynamical influence is usually taken into account by adding random elements to the characteristic parameters of the system barkaichem , michel , jung .",
    "for example , spectral diffusion processes are taken into account by adding classical noise fluctuations to the transition frequency of the system , while lifetime fluctuations may be associated to transitions between different conformational ( chemical or physical ) states of the environment .",
    "stochastic bloch equations zheng , he , flhbrown , barkaiexactmandel , stochastic decay rates wang , brown , modulated reaction models @xcite or stochastic reaction coordinates @xcite are some of the associated theoretical models . on the other hand ,",
    "radiation patterns whose statistics depend on the external laser power dickson , wemoerner , hoch , barbara , talon , moerner , wild , cichoslaser are modeled by introducing extra states coupled incoherently to the upper level of the system @xcite .",
    "the previous approaches are well - accepted and standard theoretical tools for modeling sms experiments .",
    "they provide a solid basis for describing different  experimental observables , such as those associated to the photon counting statistics .",
    "nevertheless , as the influence of both the background electromagnetic field and the reservoir fluctuations are represented in a unified way by a classical noise , in general it is not clear how to calculate arbitrary observables associated to the scattered laser field .",
    "this limitation is evident when considering , for example , the optical or absorption spectrum , which is defined in terms of the scattered field correlations .",
    "the previous drawback or limitation could be surpassed if one is able to describe sms experiments on the basis of a full open quantum system approach . by an open quantum systems approach",
    "we mean : ( i ) the possibility of describing both the fluorophore system and the reservoir fluctuations through a density matrix operator , whose evolution , i.e. , its master equation , can be written and adapted to each specific situation .",
    "( ii ) describing the quantum nature of the scattered electromagnetic field through operators and providing a closed solution for their evolution , in such a way that a simple procedure for calculating arbitrary field correlations is established .",
    "then , the calculation of observables like the optical spectrum follows straightforwardly .",
    "( iii ) characterizing the photon counting process through a mandel formula and establishing a manageable analytical tool for the explicit calculation of the photon counting probabilities .",
    "the main goal of this paper is to demonstrate that it is possible to build up such kind of powerful and general approach , which not only recovers the predictions of standard approaches , but also allows to characterize , in different situations , arbitrary observables associated to the scattered quantum electromagnetic field .",
    "the scarce application of an open quantum system approach to sms has a clear origin . due to the complexity of the underlying nano - environment , a microscopic description , from where to deduce the system density matrix evolution ,",
    "is lacking .",
    "we overcome this difficulty by noting that the noise fluctuations induced by the reservoir @xcite can be associated to a coarse grained representation of its complex structure vankampen , allowing us to write microscopic interactions that take into account its leading dynamical effects and at the same time are analytically manageable . from the effective microscopic dynamic the system and reservoir fluctuations result described in terms of a lindblad rate equation .",
    "the theoretical validity of these equations for describing non - markovian open quantum system dynamics was established in refs .",
    "the possibility of establishing a quantum - electrodynamic treatment of sms experiments also relies on the results of ref .",
    "@xcite , where the quantum regression hypothesis was analyzed for lindblad rate master equations .",
    "we remark that recent author contributions anticipated the possibility of establishing the powerful formalism developed in this paper . in refs .",
    "rapid , it was demonstrated that an anomalous fluorescence blinking phenomenon can be dynamically induced by a complex environment whose action can be described by a direct sum of markovian sub - reservoirs . in ref .",
    "mandel , for the same situation , observables associated to the photon counting process and a mapping with triplet blinking models barkaichem , molski were characterized . in ref .",
    "@xcite , we shown that fluorescence blinking patterns whose statistics depend on the external laser power can be model through an underlying tripartite interaction .",
    "both situations lead to quantum master equations that correspond to particular cases of the present general formalism .",
    "since in both cases the calculations relied on specific generalizations of a quantum jump approach @xcite , there is not a recipe for calculating the scattered field correlations .",
    "the present quantum - electrodynamic treatment also fills up this gap .",
    "the paper is outlined as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , the effective hamiltonian microscopic dynamic that defines the full approach is introduced and the evolution of the fluorophore density matrix is obtained . in sec .",

    "iv , the photon counting statistics is characterized through a mandel formula and a generating function approach @xcite . in sec .",
    "v , the formalism is exemplified by analyzing different kind of environment fluctuations .",
    "processes like spectral diffusion , lifetime fluctuations , and light assisted processes are explicitly characterized through the scattered field observables . in sec .",
    "vi we give the conclusions .",

    "since the nano - reservoir can only be indirectly observed through the fluorophore system , its hilbert space structure can not be resolved beyond the experimental resolution .",

    "clearly , the subspaces @xmath6 define the maximal information about the reservoir hilbert space structure that can be achieved from a sms experiment .",
