    "staggered ( kogut - susskind , ks ) fermions provide a competitive method for simulating full qcd , including the effects of virtual @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 pairs .",
    "indeed , recent improvements in the action @xcite have made it possible to compute many physical quantities with rather small scaling violations in such  2 + 1 flavor \" simulations @xcite .",
    "the violation of ks - flavor symmetry , while reduced by the improved ( `` asqtad '' ) action , remains however quite large at the lattice spacing ( @xmath5 fm ) where most of the simulations in refs .",
    "@xcite have been performed .",
    "the maximum splitting in mass squared among the various flavor pions , @xmath6 , is @xmath7 at this lattice spacing . because one can choose the staggered flavor on the valence quark lines , the flavor violations often enter through loop effects alone , and as such they have a typical size of only @xmath88% in most quantities .",
    "here , i estimate the size from a `` typical '' chiral logarithm , including flavor violation : @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the chiral scale ( taken , for instance equal to @xmath11 ) , and @xmath12 . since the leading flavor violating terms in the improved ks action are @xmath13",
    ", these discretization effects can be reduced still more by going closer to the continuum limit ; milc simulations are currently in progress at @xmath14 fm",
    ".    on the other hand , if one focuses directly on chiral logs and works at @xmath5 fm , the effect of ks - flavor violation should be large .",
    "indeed , in ref .",
    "@xcite , we were unable to fit @xmath15 to the standard continuum chiral - log form @xcite for 2 + 1 flavor qcd .",
    "( here and below @xmath16 stands for a generic light ( @xmath2 or @xmath3 ) quark ; i neglect isospin violations throughout . ) to test the hypothesis that ks - flavor violations are responsible for this behavior of @xmath15 , one needs to compute the chiral logs in the presence of ks symmetry breaking . that computation is the subject of this paper @xcite .",
    "the effective chiral lagrangian that describes ks fermions through @xmath17 ( @xmath18 is a generic quark mass ) has been constructed by lee and sharpe @xcite .",
    "their approach is to make a joint expansion in @xmath18 and @xmath19 , which are considered to be comparably small .",
    "that is in fact the case for a simulation like @xcite , where the splittings in mass squared of various ks - flavor pions are comparable to the squared masses themselves . a one - loop calculations using the lagrangian of ref .",
    "@xcite would give the chiral logs ( non - analytic terms ) of @xmath20 .",
    "the lee - sharpe lagrangian corresponds to a single lattice ks field , which becomes 4 degenerate flavors in the continuum limit .",
    "the main subtleties in the current work arise because i am interested in the more phenomenologically relevant 2 + 1 flavor theory being simulated , with @xmath21 in general , not the 4-flavor ( continuum degenerate ) ks theory .",
    "i follow a three - step procedure :    * \\1 .",
    "generalize ( almost trivially ) the lee - sharpe lagrangian to the 4 + 4 case , where one has two lattice ks fields with different masses ( @xmath22 , @xmath23 ) .",
    "this is an @xmath24 theory , with mass terms and @xmath13 ks - flavor violating terms breaking the symmetry .",
    "compute @xmath0 at one loop in the 4 + 4 case .",
    "i treat only the case where the pion is the @xmath25 goldstone particle .",
    "( this is the situation most immediately relevant to the fits attempted in @xcite . )",
    "the symmetry then implies that @xmath0 vanishes when @xmath26 , allowing one to simplify the calculation . *",
    "adjust the 4 + 4 answer to correspond to the 2 + 1 case of interest .",
    "this requires identifying the contributions that correspond to @xmath16 or @xmath4 virtual quark loops and multiplying them by @xmath27 or @xmath28 respectively .",
    "the subtleties are almost entirely in step 3 . to identify those terms that should be reduced by a factor of 2 or 4 ,",
    "one needs to follow the `` quark flow '' approach , which was introduced by sharpe @xcite to compute quenched chiral logarithms .",
    "unfortunately , in the presence of ks - flavor symmetry violation , there does not appear to be an alternative , lagrangian approach @xcite that would automatically cancel the effects of the unwanted ks flavors .",
    "this corresponds to the fact that , in numerical simulations , the reduction from 4 + 4 to 2 + 1 flavors is accomplished by taking the square root and fourth root of the @xmath16 and @xmath4 determinants , respectively .",
    "the procedure reduces each of the four ks flavors in a virtual quark loop equally , by a factor of 2 ( 4 ) ; it does not than cancel specific flavors .",
    "there is thus no equivalent ( ultra)local lattice lagrangian , and it is not at all clear how or whether one can represent the low energy chiral properties of this theory with an effective chiral lagrangian @xcite .    of course , in the continuum limit the ks - flavor symmetry is restored , and one may cancel any 2 of the 4 light quark flavors ( and any 3 of the 4 strange quark flavors ) with 2 ( 3 ) bosonic pseudo - quarks .",
    "the effective chiral theory is then obvious : an `` @xmath29 '' partially quenched chiral perturbation theory .",
    "this is discussed in ref .",
    "such a theory is trivially equivalent to standard 3 flavor chiral perturbation theory in the physical sector where the sea quarks are also the ones on the external lines .",
