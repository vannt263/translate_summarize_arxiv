    "as results from the high energy run of the large hadron collider ( lhc ) start arriving , interest in probing any non - standard behavior of the scalar with mass around 125 - 126 gev @xcite remains ever - alive . to keep the flame on , departure from the pattern of its interactions as laid down in the standard model ( sm ) is still allowed , though not imperatively , by the ( 7 + 8 ) tev data . on the other hand ,",
    "issues ranging from the naturalness of the higgs mass to the question of vacuum stability continue to nudge theorists even after higgs discovery .",
    "therefore , it is both legitimate and well - motivated to enquire if the high energy run can reveal some non - standard interactions of the particle which , in all fairness , can be called ` a higgs boson ' .",
    "some such investigations in relation to cp - violating @xmath0 coupling are reported here .",
    "a rather general approach is to consider effective interactions of the higgs , without committing oneself to any specific theoretical model . in this spirit , many studies have taken place over the years , probing higher - dimensional @xmath3 and @xmath0 interactions , often taking them in isolation and predicting observable phenomena in terms of the new operators @xcite .",
    "it is , however , worthwhile to obtain these interactions in terms of _ gauge invariant higher - dimensional operators _ @xcite .",
    "this is primarily because these operators can arise , if at all , by integrating out hitherto unseen new physics , and such physics , ruling above the electroweak symmetry breaking scale , must by default be @xmath4 invariant .",
    "also , the @xmath5 and @xmath6 interaction terms ensuing from such gauge invariant operators are correlated , and this correlation percolates into observed phenomena involving higgs production as well as decay . a detailed inventory as well as a large mass of work already exists on cp - even operators of this kind and their constraints and consequences .",
    "systematic studies on their cp - odd counterparts are relatively sparse , and perhaps less exhaustive .",
    "however , the very observation of the baryon asymmetry in the universe strongly suggests some source of cp - violation over and above what is manifested in the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa scheme of the sm .",
    "a bottom - up investigation of cp - odd couplings of the recently discovered scalar is therefore as well - founded as one on their cp - even counterparts .",
    "in general , there are five each of cp - even and - odd operators of dimension-6 involving @xmath7 interactions .",
    "coefficients of the latter are subject to rather strong constraints from the limits on the electric dipole moments ( edm ) of the neutron and the electron and also from the upper bounds on hg edm @xcite , in addition to global fits of collider data ( including those from the lhc ) that constrain the cp - even operators as well .",
    "arguably a detailed study of these constraints on the cp - violating operators was presented in the reference @xcite .",
    "it is , however , possible to generalize the study even further .",
    "first , the constraints from edm are rather tight on individual operators which tend to get very strongly correlated if there are two or three of them present at a time . on the other hand , taking them together along with other dimension-6 operators constructed out of the fermion fields and the higgs doublet @xcite , which can potentially contribute to fermion edms , can relax such correlations considerably , and one can end up with large values of the effective @xmath7 couplings that potentially contribute to collider observables . moreover , once we introduce the gauge invariant effective interaction terms , the simultaneous existence of several of them is the general expectation , unless some specific symmetries are invoked to forbid some of them .",
    "secondly , global fits of collider data can yield less stringent constraints if cp - odd and - even operators are all present simultaneously , mainly due the sheer proliferation of parameters ( which nonetheless should be there in the general effective theory ) . on the other hand ,",
    "it is only natural to expect operators of both kinds of a given dimensionality to exist , in the absence of any forbidding principle .",
    "to further elaborate on the second issue mentioned above , we need to identify some observables , mostly defined in terms of asymmetries , which subtract out the effect of cp - even operators , while keeping substantial separation between the cp - odd ones with the standard model predictions including their uncertainties .",
    "this is accomplished in the present work , allowing in principle the existence of all cp - odd and - even gauge invariant dimension-6 operators .",
    "the points we emphasize in particular are as follows :    * constraints from collider as well as edm limits are listed in terms of the _ effective _",
    "@xmath7 couplings , though they can arise from all possible operators at the same time .",
    "* the contributions of the cp - even operators to the suggested asymmetries at the lhc lie within the @xmath8 error - bars of the sm , while the cp - odd ones are shown to lead to values that steer clear of these error - bars over extended regions of the parameter space . * the prediction of observable asymmetries is based on detailed event generation , including showering , jet formation and detector simulation , thus leading to realistic estimates of what can be observed .",
    "* our ` realistic ' predictions of cp - violating asymmetries and suppression of the effects of cp - even operators are presented for various luminosities , giving an idea of the luminosity required to obtain useful conclusions . *",
    "correlated interactions arising due to the gauge - invariant nature of the parent operators are always taken into account , taking , for example , the @xmath6 and @xmath9 couplings arising concomitantly from the dimension-6 operators ( and thus competing favorably with their loop - induced sm counterparts ) .",
    "a resume of the cp - odd dimension-6 operators as well as their current limits is given in section 2 .",
    "in section 3 we discuss the observables which elicit the presence of cp - violating operators and help distinguish them from the sm and the corresponding cp - even counterparts .",
    "the role of asymmetries constructed from the kinematic distributions of such observables is also discussed .",
    "we summarize and conclude in section 4 .",
    "the set of cp - violating gauge - higgs operators of dimension-6 that we have considered in our analysis @xcite is listed below : @xmath10    here @xmath11 is the cut - off scale above which the high scale physics sets in . for the purpose of this study @xmath11",
    "is taken to be 1 tev .",
    "since for the lhc observables , @xmath12 ( @xmath13 etc . ) is the effective parameter that gets constrained , the global fit constraints can be predicted for any value of @xmath11 , with the constraints on the parameters @xmath14 s being appropriately scaled .",
    "however , for the constraints coming from edm measurements , one finds that edms have an explicit cut - off dependence other than the one coming via the parameters @xmath12 .",
    "this dependence coming from loop contributions is logarithmic in nature @xcite .",
    "+ however , all five of these cp - violating operators are not independent , and are related by the following constraint equations , which arise from using the sm equations of motion : @xmath15 the above set of constraints in eq .",
    "[ eq : operator_constraints ] entails only three of the five operators in eq .",
    "[ eq : o - cp - odd ] to be independent of each other . for the purpose of our study",
    "we take @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 to be comprising an independent set of cp - violating gauge - higgs operators .",
    "these operators give rise to the cp - odd @xmath7 interaction vertices of following form , @xmath19~ v^{\\mu}(k_{1})v^{\\nu}(k_{2})h(k)\\label{eq : l - vvh } ,     \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath20 .",
    "the coefficients @xmath21 denote the effective coupling strengths of cp - odd @xmath7 couplings and , are listed in table 1 .",
    "the @xmath7 interaction vertices arising from corresponding cp - even operators are derived in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "our aim in the present work is to include scenarios where both cp - odd and - even operators are present , and to discriminate between them via appropriately defined asymmetry parameters .",
    "we demonstrate this by turning on the cp - even operator , @xmath22    which contributes to all the @xmath7 vertices .",
    "the additional interaction terms thus playing a role in our analysis have the following form @xcite    @xmath23~ v_{\\mu}(k_1)v_{\\nu}(k_2)h(k)\\label{eq : cpeven : l - wwh}.    \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the coupling strengths of cp - even @xmath7 couplings are given by @xmath24 which are similar to the corresponding cp - odd couplings receiving contributions from @xmath18 operator .    .",
    "cp - odd @xmath7 coupling factors and their effective strengths in terms of operator coefficients @xmath25 and @xmath26 [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     as has been already stated , these constraints can get relaxed when we keep a linearly independent set of cp - violating gauge - higgs operators to be non - zero at the same time along with the other fermion - higgs dimension-6 operators ( which contribute to fermionic edms ) , and also include at least some of their cp - conserving counterparts .",
    "such operators can be obtained directly by extending those listed in @xcite , table 2 .",
    "while the cp - violating ones contribute to edms , they do not affect the phenomenology of @xmath7 interactions .",
    "the consequent enlargement of the parameter space , however , relaxes the otherwise stringent constraints from edms .",
    "the allowed values of the coefficients of the dimension-6 operators apparently threaten perturbative unitarity in @xmath27 at scales of the order of few tev .",
    "the exact value of this scale depends on the specific choice of the operators involved and the corresponding anomalous couplings they generate @xcite .",
    "however , the effective operators are not reliable at such scales .",
    "there one has to include the actual heavy fields of mass @xmath28 ( for weakly coupled ultraviolet completion ) , which are integrated out to obtain the effective coupling terms .",
    "these additional degrees of freedom are trusted to restore unitarity when the full theory is switched on . in the context of the study presented here ,",
    "the range of @xmath29 is varied upto @xmath30 . even though @xmath29 is varied upto this range , the effective coupling parameter that will decide the perturbativity of the loop expanson is given by @xcite , @xmath31 here , @xmath32 gev is the higgs vacuum expectation value .",
    "thus even for @xmath33 , @xmath34 and the loop expansion in terms of @xmath35 remains perturbative .",
    "in any elementary particle scattering process , the size and shape of certain kinematic distributions involving leptons and jets can change non - trivially with respect to the purely standard model prediction in the presence of both cp - odd and - even higher dimensional operators .",
    "some of these have been studied mostly in purely phenomenological formulations , i.e. , without working in terms of gauge invariant dimension-6 operators or without performing a realistic simulation of events ( @xcite ) . for generic observables like @xmath36 and rapidity distributions which are affected by both cp - even as well as cp - odd couplings",
    ", it may not be possible to separate the effect of the two couplings with sufficient statistical significance .",
    "in other words , for values of anomalous couplings , consistent with the available experimental data , it would require analysing a huge amount of data / events to confirm the effect of cp - odd couplings on top of the effect of cp - even couplings using generic observables .",
    "therefore , it is more economical to work with observables which are unambiguously sensitive to the definite cp - propertry of the couplings .    in the present work ,",
    "we are interested in cp - odd observables .",
    "the cp - odd observables can be categorised as @xmath37-even or @xmath37-odd type .",
    "is the naive time reversal transformation that flips the sign of the particle spin and momenta , without interchanging the initial and final states .",
    "] unlike the @xmath37-even observables which require a non - zero absorptive / unitary phase to quantify the cp - violation , the @xmath37-odd observables do not require any absorptive phase and can be calculated at tree - level . the triple cross products constructed using the particle momenta / spin in a given process can serve as @xmath37-odd observables ; thus they need not be driven by any absorptive phase .",
    "a non - zero expectation value of such a cp - odd and @xmath37-odd observable would imply cp - violation at the lagrangian level @xcite . in practice , we work with asymmetries , constructed out of such observables , which are unlikely to be faked by the sm or other cp - even couplings via statistical fluctuation . in this section ,",
    "we quantitatively establish such characteristics of the chosen observables after a realistic simulation of a suitable process at the lhc .      with the above considerations in view , we take up the analysis of the process , @xmath38 with @xmath39 .",
    "we consider the decay of higgs to @xmath40 final state to ensure sufficient event rates .",
    "the final state is required to have two opposite sign leptons and _ exactly two @xmath41-tagged jets_. the proton - proton collisions are simulated at the center - of - mass energy of 14 tev . in presence of dimension-6 operators , this process also receives contribution from a tree - level diagram involving @xmath42 vertex , which is not present in the sm .",
    "thus there is an interference of the two @xmath43channel diagrams involving the @xmath44 and @xmath42 vertices at the amplitude level .",
    "this is because the same gauge - higgs operators that give rise to the anomalous @xmath45 coupling also give rise to the @xmath46 interaction [ table [ tab : anomalous_vertices ] ] .    throughout our analysis",
    "we consider @xmath47 gev .",
    "we implement the anomalous couplings in madgraph @xcite using the package feynrules @xcite .",
    "the cross sections are calculated using nn23lo1 @xcite parton distribution functions with default settings for renormalization and factorization scales .",
    "while the parton level events are generated in madgraph , the pythia @xcite switch is turned on to incorporate showering , hadronisation and initial and final state radiation ( isr / fsr ) effects .",
    "the hep file obtained from this interfacing is passed to delphes-3.1.2 @xcite which gives a root @xcite file as output .",
    "jets are formed using the anti - kt algorithm in delphes with a cone size of 0.6 .",
    "a @xmath36 dependent tagging efficiency is employed for @xmath41-jets , namely , 0.7 - 0.5 for @xmath36 in the range 20 - 500 gev .",
    "we also use a mis - tagging efficiency of 0.001 for light jets and a @xmath36 dependent mis - tagging efficiency for @xmath48-induced jets , which varies from 0.14 - 0.08 for 20 @xmath49 500 gev .",
    "the root file thus obtained is fed to the analysis code to generate the distributions .",
    "+ we start with following basic cuts on the transverse momentum , rapidity and separation of leptons ( @xmath50 ) and jets ( @xmath51 ) , where @xmath52 ; @xmath53 being the light quark jets and @xmath41 corresponds to the @xmath41-induced jets .",

    "we have taken such a window for the invariant mass of the two @xmath41-tagged jets because owing to the effects of hadronisation and showering , the peak of the invariant mass distribution shifts from @xmath69 to about 116 gev .",
    "thus we gain in terms of signal events by choosing such an invariant mass cut .",
    "further , requiring exactly two @xmath41-tagged jets in the final state significantly reduces the background coming from @xmath70 .    in order to suppress the @xmath71 backgrounds ,",
    "use has been made of the fact that our signal events are hermetic in the ideal situation .",
    "in contrast , similar final states from the @xmath71 background will be necessarily associated with missing-@xmath72 .",
    "thus we propose to distinguish the signal by demanding @xmath73 20 gev @xcite .",
    "moreover , no missing-@xmath36 pointing centrally is ensured by choosing @xmath74 2.5 , where @xmath75 stands for the polar direction of the transverse momentum imbalance .",
    "next , we discuss two cp - odd , @xmath37-odd quantities used in the rest of the analysis to isolate the effect of cp - odd couplings from the cp - even ones .",

    "this is important in the context of lhc , as there is ambiguity associated with the momentum direction of the initial quark with respect to which proton it is from .",
    "the definition of @xmath84 removes this ambiguity and makes it uniquely measurable .",
    "the second observable that we consider uses @xmath85 and @xmath86 , the three - momenta of the two @xmath41-tagged jets in addition to the oppositely signed leptons in the final state and is given as : + @xmath87,\\ ] ]    these observables are cp - odd and @xmath37-odd , and thus generated from the dispersive part of the amplitude .",
    "it should also be noted that , since the in - state partons from the two colliding proton beams do not always carry equal momenta , the lab frame and the center of mass ( cm ) frame for the colliding partons are in general different .",
    "thus , except for the cm frame _ i.e. _ when the two initial partons come with the same @xmath88-value , where @xmath89 , the observables @xmath84 and @xmath90 are distinct . also , due to the showering effects , an exact momentum balance between the final state @xmath41-jets and leptons does not hold true .",
    "the difference in the observables is evident from their distributions . by definition ,",
    "each of them ranges from -1.0 to + 1.0 .",

    "it is important to note that unlike total rates and other cp - even observables which depend on cp - odd couplings quadratically , a comparison of distributions from second and third panel confirms that these observables have linear dependence on @xmath99 coupling in the numerator of the expression for the asymmetry [ eq .",
    "[ eqn : asymmetry_def ] ] .",

    "another important feature to notice is that the asymmetry does not monotonically increase as we increase the magnitude of the coupling parameter .",
