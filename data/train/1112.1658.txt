    "it has been almost one decade since the first atmospheric measurement of a hot jupiter @xcite and yet this class of exotic exoplanet still provides us with many mysteries waiting to be solved .",
    "these include the culprit responsible for the stratospheric temperature inversions inferred for many hot jupiters @xcite , the implication of a super - solar carbon - to - oxygen ratio in at least one hot jupiter @xcite , the possible influence of magnetic drag on the atmospheric circulation @xcite , and a peculiar planet where dawn seems to be much hotter than noon @xcite . in the midst of a growing collection of observations ,",
    "some with unexpected or surprising results , is the continuing development of atmospheric models trying to interpret and understand the measurements .",
    "one set of atmospheric models are numerical ones that simulate the global circulation patterns on close - in gas giants . with masses and radii comparable to jupiter , but subject to incident stellar fluxes 10,000 times stronger than what jupiter receives from the sun , and expected to be tidally locked into synchronous orbits , hot jupiters exist in an atmospheric regime unlike anything in our solar system , and models of their atmospheric circulation are expanding into uncharted territory .",
    "in order to try to understand how atmospheres work in this new regime , the models that have been developed so far represent a range of complexities , various approaches , and the use of different sets of assumptions .",
    "some of the simplest models solve the shallow water or equivalent barotropic equations and use various schemes to include the effect of radiative heating @xcite .",
    "others solve the primitive equations of meteorology , either using a newtonian relaxation scheme for the radiative forcing @xcite , a dual - band radiative transfer scheme ( * ? ? ?",
    "* similar to the one we present here ) , or more complex non - gray radiative transfer @xcite . finally , there are also models that solve the full set of fluid equations , using dual - band flux - limited diffusion for the radiative transfer @xcite .    here",
    "we present an updated version of our previous general circulation model that now includes a",
    " double - gray \" radiative transfer scheme .",
    "fluxes throughout the atmosphere are separated into optical and infrared components , each with its own absorption coefficient , which is constant for the optical band and can scale as a powerlaw with pressure for the infrared band .",
    "we use standard two - stream radiative transfer equations to solve for the vertical fluxes and calculate heating rates from those .",
    "in addition to producing self - consistent radiative fluxes and heating rates , including the observable infrared flux emerging from the top boundary , this new code has the advantage of maintaining only a moderate level of complexity .",
    "this facilitates comparison between simulated results and analytic profiles ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see also hansen 2008 ) and makes it easier to clearly identify the effects due to changes in opacity .",
    "our new code is described in detail in section  [ sec : code ] .",
    "we demonstrate the functionality of our code by presenting a model of a generic hot jupiter ( section  [ sec : models ] ) and we investigate issues related the atmosphere s behavior at deep pressures ( section  [ sec : deep ] ) .",
    "we then study the effect of magnetic drag on atmospheric circulation by applying a simplified drag scheme to our model , with drag strengths ranging from weak to strong ( section  [ sec : drag ] ) . in section  [ sec : conc ] we summarize our results .",
    "the new version of our code presented here solves the primitive equations of meteorology using the dynamical core originally developed by @xcite , converted for hot jupiter studies in @xcite and used in subsequent papers @xcite .",
    "the previous version of this code ( igcm1 ) heated the atmosphere through a newtonian relaxation scheme .",
    "here we use an updated version of the code ( igcm3 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) with several improvements , including a simple radiative transfer scheme , which we have adapted to model gaseous exoplanets .",
    "this code also contains a standard dry convection scheme .",
    "the static stability throughout each vertical column is calculated and any layers found to be convectively unstable are adjusted to constant potential temperature ( entropy ) , with the vertical integral of enthalpy conserved .      the primary driver of atmospheric circulation on close - in extrasolar planets is heating from the stellar irradiation , which is absorbed and re - emitted throughout the atmosphere .",
    "we employ the common assumption that the incident radiation is predominantly at optical wavelengths , while the re - emitted radiation is in the infrared .",
    "we can then separate our treatment of radiative transfer into two wavelength ranges , with downward optical flux absorbed as it penetrates deeper into the atmosphere and infrared flux absorbed and emitted isotropically throughout the atmosphere .",
    "we calculate the upward and downward net fluxes in each vertical column of the atmosphere and then solve for the localized specific heating as : @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the temperature tendency , @xmath4 is the gravitational acceleration ( assumed to be constant through the model ) , @xmath5 is the specific heat , and @xmath6 is the vertical derivative of the net vertical flux ( pressure , @xmath7 , is our vertical coordinate ) .",
    "upward flux , in the direction of decreasing pressure , is defined to be positive . for an atmosphere in local radiative equilibrium ( i.e. without dynamics )",
    "@xmath8 , either because there is a constant flux through the atmosphere ( e.g. an outward heat flux from the planet interior ) or because the optical heating is exactly balanced by infrared cooling . the heating rate feeds into the energy equation of the dynamics solver ( @xmath9 in equation 1d of menou & rauscher 2009 ) .",
    "the incident optical flux at the top of each column of the atmosphere , with latitude @xmath10 and longitude @xmath11 , is @xmath12 for the day side and the day side has @xmath13 . ] and @xmath14 on the night side , where @xmath15 is the stellar flux incident on the top of the atmosphere at the substellar point and @xmath16 is the bond albedo , which here we assume to be zero .",
    "we assume a well - mixed optical absorber throughout the atmosphere , and negligible scattering , so that on the day side the downward flux in a column @xmath17 degrees away from the substellar point ( @xmath18 ) is given by the well - known equation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) : @xmath19 where we have converted from path length ( @xmath20 ) to pressure using the equation for vertical hydrostatic equilibrium ( assumed in the primitive equations ) and by integrating from the top of the atmosphere ( @xmath21 , @xmath22 ) down to the current pressure .",
    "note that the absorption of the incident flux , and the resulting heating of the atmosphere , is entirely determined by the wavelength - integrated absorption coefficient @xmath23 .",
    "lacking any reflection from a solid surface or clouds , the upward optical flux is always zero ( @xmath24 ) .",
    "our assumption that all of the incoming stellar irradiation is at visible wavelengths leads to the upper boundary condition for our infrared flux : @xmath25 .",

    "are absorbed and emitted as for a gray atmosphere , with a wavelength - integrated absorption coefficient that scales with pressure as a powerlaw : @xmath27 the infrared fluxes are : @xmath28\\right ) \\frac{d \\sigma t^4}{dp } dp \\label{eqn : fir}\\ ] ] where the integrations are from the bottom boundary ( @xmath29 ) to the given pressure for the upward flux and from the top boundary ( @xmath22 ) for the downward flux , and we have used the standard diffusivity factor 1.66 to account for integration of the isotropic radiation over all zenith angles ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "if both the infrared and optical absorption coefficients are constant with pressure ( @xmath30 ) our radiative scheme ( with the dynamics turned off ) should reproduce the analytic profiles from ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see also hansen 2008 ) .",
    "note that for this type of  double - gray \" atmosphere with constant absorption coefficients , the temperature - pressure profiles can never be convective ; as shown in appendix  [ sec : conv ] , for a convective region to exist the powerlaw index , @xmath31 , must be greater than a threshold value based on the ratio of the specific gas constant to the specific heat ( @xmath32 ) .",
    "we initialize our model runs with no winds and with temperatures everywhere set to the analytic night side profile ( equation 27 of guillot 2010 ) . for the first ( planet ) day of the run , the fluxes from the radiative transfer scheme are not used and instead a newtonian relaxation scheme heats each point in the atmosphere toward the value it would have in local radiative equilibrium , with a relaxation timescale set to 0.1 planet days . during this time the atmosphere is also allowed to respond by developing winds .",
    "after the first day the newtonian scheme is no longer used and the heating is entirely determined by fluxes from the radiative transfer scheme .    to test the implementation of our radiative transfer in the code , we set the infrared opacity to be constant with pressure ( @xmath30 in equation  [ eqn : kir ] ) and compared our temperature - pressure profiles against the analytic solutions from @xcite . ;",
    "see also @xcite .",
    "when testing our radiative transfer scheme , we also checked how our code performed for non - constant absorption coefficients and found our results to be in good agreement with the analytic profiles , after the modification described in section  [ sec : fdiff ] .",
    "] we ran several tests in which the downward optical flux at the top boundary was identical at all points around the globe , so that there are no horizontal gradients and no atmospheric motion .",
    "this effectively turns the code into a one - dimensional radiative transfer solver . for a given set of absorption coefficients and boundary fluxes , we began with initial profiles set to the analytic solutions and then let the code run until each column was in local radiative equilibrium : @xmath33 , with heating equal to cooling , or with a constant flux set by the bottom boundary condition : @xmath34 .",
    "we considered a profile to be equilibrated once it was within less than 1% of @xmath8 .",
    "this testing showed that , although our profiles matched the analytic solution at low pressures , they tended toward isothermal in the deepest levels , rather than approaching an adiabat ( as shown in figure  [ fig : fdiff ] ) .",
    "the reason for this is that our numerical domain spans many orders of magnitude in pressure and vertical levels are evenly distributed in @xmath35 .",
    "deep in the atmosphere the pressure difference between adjacent levels becomes very large ( @xmath36 ) , the optical depth greatly exceeds unity ( @xmath37 ) , and the exponential term in equation  [ eqn : fir ] goes to zero .",
    "when the deepest levels are in radiative equilibrium , the temperature profile is entirely determined by the vertical resolution , with the temperature differences between adjacent pressure levels set by : @xmath38 ( a profile that exactly matches those shown in figure  [ fig : fdiff ] ) .          in order to achieve the correct temperature - pressure profiles at depth ,",
    "we have implemented a scheme in which we transition to calculating the radiative flux using the diffusion approximation at optical depths greater than one .",
    "the flux through the optically thick , deep atmosphere is calculated as : @xmath39 a temperature profile that increases with pressure results in an upward flux ( @xmath40 ) .    the transition from fluxes calculated using the main radiative transfer equations ( [ eqn : sw ] , [ eqn : fir ] ) and the diffusion approximation ( [ eqn : fdiff ] ) occurs based on the local optical depth ( @xmath41 , taking into account any dependence of @xmath42 with pressure ) . the original radiative scheme begins to fail when the term @xmath43\\int { \\ensuremath{\\kappa_{\\mathrm{ir}}}}dp)$ ] becomes too small , and so we use this as a criterion for when to begin the implementation of the flux diffusion scheme . through trial and comparison to the analytic solutions",
    ", we determined that the fix should begin at the point where @xmath44 , which in our code corresponds to an optical depth @xmath45 , where @xmath16 is the vertical resolution of the model , @xmath46 . for a model",
    "whose bottom boundary is at @xmath47 bar , whose upper boundary is @xmath48 mbar , and that has @xmath49 levels , @xmath50 ( @xmath51 bar in figure  [ fig : fdiff ] ) .",
    "a model using only 10 vertical levels would have @xmath52 ( @xmath53 bar in figure  [ fig : fdiff ] ) .",
    "this resolution - dependent @xmath54 appropriately fixes the resolution dependence of the problem with the original radiative transfer scheme .    at optical depths greater than @xmath54 ,",
    "the infrared flux is calculated as : @xmath55 , where @xmath56 is the infrared flux calculated from equation  [ eqn : fir ] .",
    "the transition to the diffusion fluxes has the same exponential dependence as the problem with the original radiative scheme and the factor of 0.023 was chosen so that at the pressure where @xmath57 ( @xmath58 ) , @xmath59 .",
    "we found that this correction produced a smooth transition ( both in fluxes and the temperature - pressure profiles ) from the optically thin to optically thick regimes .",
    "there are several advantages to using this radiative transfer scheme .",
    "the main benefit over the newtonian relaxation scheme is that the atmosphere is heated through self - consistently calculated fluxes , given a small set of parameters : the optical absorption coefficient ( @xmath60 ) , the infrared absorption constant ( @xmath61 ) and powerlaw index ( @xmath31 ) , the external stellar flux ( @xmath15 ) , and the internal heat flux ( @xmath62 ) .",
    "the upward flux at the top boundary of the model can be used to create maps of the infrared flux emitted by the planet .",
    "although detailed physics are hidden within the two absorption coefficients , the relative simplicity of this radiative transfer facilitates comparison to analytic predictions .",
    "in particular , the dynamic temperature - pressure profiles can easily be compared to analytic profiles for local radiative equilibrium ( see * ? ? ? * and appendix  [ sec : tpprofiles ] for profiles with non - constant infrared absorption coefficients ) .",
    "we present a fiducial model for a hot jupiter with global parameters similar to hd 209458b , as listed in table  [ tab : params ] .",

    "we performed partial runs at t21 and t42 and found consistency with the t31 results shown here , but the t42 resolution was too computationally expensive for this work .",
    "we also tested the strength and order of the hyperdissipation we used to prevent the build up of noise on small scales , which takes the form : @xmath81 , where @xmath82 represents the vorticity , divergence , and temperature fields . for horizontal resolutions of t21 , t31 , and t42 we tested orders of @xmath83 , 3 , and 4 , and values of @xmath84 corresponding to e - folding times ( for damping the smallest scales ) at fractions of a planet day : 0.5 , 0.05 , 0.005 , and 0.0005 .",

    "we chose to use an order of @xmath85 and a damping timescale of 0.005 planet days for our t31 fiducial model .",

    "<S> we present a new version of our code for modeling the atmospheric circulation on gaseous exoplanets , now employing a  double - gray \" radiative transfer scheme , which self - consistently solves for fluxes and heating throughout the atmosphere , including the emerging ( observable ) infrared flux . </S>",
    "<S> we separate the radiation into infrared and optical components , each with its own absorption coefficient , and solve standard two - stream radiative transfer equations . </S>",
    "<S> we use a constant optical absorption coefficient , while the infrared coefficient can scale as a powerlaw with pressure . here </S>",
    "<S> we describe our new code in detail and demonstrate its utility by presenting a generic hot jupiter model . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss issues related to modeling the deepest pressures of the atmosphere and describe our use of the diffusion approximation for radiative fluxes at high optical depths . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , we present new models using a simple form for magnetic drag on the atmosphere . we calculate emitted thermal phase curves and find that our drag - free model has the brightest region of the atmosphere offset by @xmath012@xmath1  from the substellar point and a minimum flux that is 17% of the maximum , while the model with the strongest magnetic drag has an offset of only @xmath02@xmath1  and a ratio of 13% . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we calculate rates of numerical loss of kinetic energy at @xmath015% for every model except for our strong - drag model , where there is no measurable loss ; we speculate that this is due to the much decreased wind speeds in that model . </S>"
