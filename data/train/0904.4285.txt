    "as atomic nuclei far off the @xmath5-stability exhibit exotic characters ( _ e.g. _ nucleon halos  @xcite and new magic numbers  @xcite ) , excitation properties of unstable nuclei come under interest as well as their ground - state properties .",
    "the new features of unstable nuclei , such as the broad distribution of nucleons , the exotic shell structure and the coupling to the continuum , may give rise to new aspects of nuclear excitation . in theoretical studies of unstable nuclei , it is highly desired to handle those features efficiently . it is expected that ground - state properties of many nuclei can be investigated in the mean - field ( mf ) approximations , although correlation effects are not necessarily negligible . among many efforts to develop new numerical methods to study structure of unstable nuclei , one of the authors ( h.n . ) proposed a method for mf calculations  @xcite that is based on the gaussian expansion method ( gem )  @xcite .",
