    "today , we believe that the sm should be an effective theory to explain most of the current experimental results . however , it is well - known that one can not explain in this context , for example , the hierarchy of the fermion masses , the origin of neutrino masses , the origin of parity and cp violation , the nature of dark matter and the baryon - asymmetry in the universe .",

    "hence , due to the invariance of the trace , the following conclusion about the hierarchy of the masses can be drawn : the model predicts that the muonic sterile neutrino is much lighter than the others , which therefore have degenerated masses . in order to study qualitatively the order of magnitud of the sterile neutrino masses",

    "the current experimental bounds are represented by the red line and with dashed lines we show the projected limits .",
    "as one can see , the current bounds constrain only a small region of the parameter space , while the projected bounds will constrain the model in a significant way .",
    "it is important to emphasize that in this theory one can have large lepton number violating effects in a consistent way in agreement with all experimental constrains .",
    "then , combining the results for the @xmath3 and the @xmath1 conversion one can hope to test these predictions in the near future .",
    "in this model one can have new contributions to neutrinoless double beta decay once the singlet charged higgs , @xmath112 , mixes with the charged higgses in the bi - doublet higgs . since the charged higgses in the bi - doublet have to be heavy to avoid large flavour violation in the quark sector and the mixing angle is small the contribution to neutrinoless double beta decay is very small .",
    "therefore , here one has the usual contributions in the context of the left - right theory but taking into account that the right - handed neutrinos are light .",
    "we have investigated the @xmath154 , and the predictions are quite below the current and projected experimental bounds .",
    "we have discussed the main features of a simple left - right symmetric theory  @xcite where the neutrinos are majorana fermions and their masses are generated at one - loop level .",
    "this theory predicts that the right - handed neutrinos are generically light and the existence of new interactions violating lepton number which can give rise to large contributions to flavor violating processes such as @xmath0 and @xmath1 conversion .",
    "we have investigated the lepton number violating contributions mediated by the new charged gauge bosons @xmath80 .",
    "these contributions are very small in our model due to the gim suppression . however , in other models where the right - handed neutrinos are heavy and close in mass to the @xmath5 gauge bosons , these contributions can be very large motivating the search for the lfv processes .",
    "our left - right symmetric theory predicts the existence of a new charged singlet higgs which can give rise to very large flavour violation effects . since the charged scalar could be in principle very light due to the lack of strong collider constrains",

    "we have shown that both processes provide non - trivial bounds on this model and thanks to the possibility of improving the experimental bounds in the near future one can hope to test these predictions . together with the usual collider signatures from the @xmath80 and right - handed neutrinos decays , one can use the predictions for lepton number violating processes to realize the testability of this theory .",
