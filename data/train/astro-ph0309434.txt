    "it was known for many years that the universe , which once became almost neutral after recombination , reionized before @xmath2 by using gunn - peterson ( gp ) test of high redshift quasars .",
    "it was not until recently , however , that direct evidences to determine the reionization epoch were found .",
    "first evidence of the reionization epoch was obtained by sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) @xcite .",
    "the spectra of quasars observed by sdss team revealed that there existed neutral hydrogen at the redshift @xmath3 by gp test , which implies that we have started to see the completion of reionization , although the amount of neutral hydrogen does not have to be very large to explain the observed gp trough .",
    "recent wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap ) observation provided second important evidence of reionization @xcite .",
    "wmap found that the optical depth due to the reionization is @xmath4 , which may correspond to the reionization epoch @xmath5 .",
    "therefore , it is observationally required that the reionization process was very efficient at around @xmath5 , but the process did not complete until @xmath6 .",
    "the conventional view of the reionization process is that the universe is reionized by uv fluxes from early formed stars and quasars .",
    "many calculations have shown that the universe can be reionized at @xmath7  @xcite .",
    "thus , it is possible to explain the full reionization at @xmath8 observed by sdss but not what wmap observed .",
    "recent studies  @xcite showed that the reionization epoch can be earlier assuming the non - standard initial mass function ( imf ) or unrealistically large uv fluxes from galaxies .",
    "however , the uv fluxes from stars and quasars increase as time and soon exceed the critical value to fully reionize the universe .",
    "therefore it is expected that the universe achieved the full reionization much earlier than @xmath9 in this scenario .",
    "therefore we need to consider really extreme and perhaps unrealistic assumptions about imf , escaping uv fraction from galaxies and so on , to have the reionization process with two stages ; for example , see @xcite .",
    "alternative to along this line , one may also consider other sources for ionizing hydrogens and heliums",
    ". it could be decaying particles , but it has been considered that enduring photon emission from particle decay disables the picture of gp trough confirmed by sdss . in this article , however , we will show that the optical depth @xmath10 can be explained naturally by decaying particles with rather large parameter space of mass and lifetime ; in some cases , the lifetime could be longer than the age of the universe .",
    "we follow the evolution of hydrogen , helium , and electron temperature including uv sources of quasars , stars , and decaying particles . here",
    "we simply assume the particles decay into two photons with energy half of the particle mass .",
    "notice that hansen and haiman @xcite tried to explain the optical depth of @xmath11 by a particle of mass @xmath12 mev and the lifetime @xmath13 sec , which is @xmath14 reported by wmap team @xcite .",
    "they considered the decaying particle as some sterile neutrino which decay into electrons ( and positrons ) in order to achieve half partially reionized era before @xmath6 . here",
    "we will see that photons emitted through particle decay keeps much smaller partially ionization before @xmath6 , and explains rather large optical depth .",
    "we assume that the particle @xmath15 emits two photons with monochromatic energy of half mass of that particle , i.e. , @xmath16 .",
    "the number density of @xmath15-particle is written as @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the lifetime of @xmath15-particle . if @xmath19 ev , those photons emitted can ionize hydrogen atoms",
    ". then one can write a source term for the decaying particle as @xmath20 in order to calculate how many photons are emitted , the abundance , mass , and the lifetime of the particle should be fixed .",
    "we parameterize them as free parameters by @xmath21 , @xmath22 , and @xmath18 .",
    "we will see below the allowed region in these parameter space .",
    "notice that we restrict ourselves only for @xmath23 ev .",
    "this is because @xmath24 mev case involves e@xmath25e@xmath26 pair production , and it is too complicated .",
    "moreover , @xmath27 mev may destroy light elements such as d , t , @xmath28he , and @xmath29he , spoiling successful big bang nucleosynthesis .",
    "other than decaying particles , we also include usually considered contributions to reionizing photons from quasars and stars .",
    "uv photons emitted from early formed stars are indeed responsible for achieving full ionization at @xmath9 .",
    "uv photons from quasars may keep the ionization fraction unity , but this contribution is very small , and may not be needed for that purpose ( of course , quasars exist and there are contributions from them ) .",
    "we follow the argument of fukugita and kawasaki @xcite to follow the thermal history from @xmath30 including reionization epoch , calculating the ionization fraction of hydrogen and helium , the photon spectrum , and the electron temperature ( see also @xcite for treatment of high energy photons from decaying particle ) .    some of the difference from ref .",
    "@xcite are adoption of decreasing star formation rate for smaller collapsed objects . in refs.@xcite",
    "it was assumed that the collapsed objects which satisfy the cooling condition become star - forming galaxies and a constant fraction @xmath31 of baryons go into stars . in the present paper",
    ", we introduce the star - forming efficiency @xmath32 which depends on the mass of the objects as @xmath33             f & ( m \\ge 3\\times 10^{12}m_{\\odot } ) ,         \\end{array}\\right.\\ ] ] where @xmath34 is the mass of the collapsed object . with @xmath32",
    "the mass function of galaxies obeys the form of an empirical schecheter function at @xmath35 .",

    "we follow the evolution of the fraction of ionized hydrogen and helium , in addition to electron temperature .",
    "figure [ hii ] shows ionization history of hydrogen for @xmath39 and @xmath52 ev for various lifetime @xmath18 . in each case , the abundance of @xmath15-particles is determined in such a way that the optical depth reads @xmath53 , which we define by @xmath54,\\ ] ] where @xmath55 is the thomson cross section and @xmath56 is the number density for standard recombination .",

    "notice that the upper limit of the lifetime is around @xmath65 sec , when @xmath15-particles is ( cold ) dark matter , i.e. , @xmath66 . for shorter lifetime",

    "we exclude those regions where the photon flux exceeds the cosmic x - ray background : typically , @xmath73 ev and @xmath74  sec.,width=302 ]    on the other hand , if larger energy of photons are emitted , we have to be careful about cosmic x - ray backgrounds .",
    "we adopt the following simple formulas to compare with the calculated photon flux @xcite : @xmath75 where @xmath76 is measured in units of ( @xmath77 sr sec)@xmath78 .",
    "we find that long lifetime is not allowed , because the emitted photon flux exceeds the observed diffuse photon background .",
    "thus , the lifetime is rather restricted in the narrow range , and should typically be @xmath79 sec .",
    "this constraint is taken into account in fig .",

    "evolutions of ionization fraction of hydrogen look more or less similar in any emitted photon energy for the same lifetime . in order to distinguish them",
    ", we need to look at the ionization history of helium .",
    "since larger photon energy can excite helium atoms , one can see the qualitative difference from low energy emitted photons . in figs .",

    "therefore , although it will be very difficult to observe ionization fraction of helium at @xmath82 , it might be one of the tools for ( dis)proving the particle decay scenario .",
    "the evolutions of ionization fraction of hydrogen and helium look very different from those instantaneous reionization history usually considered in the literatures , although we obtain the optical depth of @xmath10 .",
    "so it is interesting to know what we can see , or more precisely , whether we can distinguish them , in the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) power spectrum .",
    "figure [ te ] shows the cross correlation spectra between temperature and e - mode polarization .",
    "our models seem to be less power in the small @xmath83 region than the model with instantaneous reionization .",
    "this is because particle decay takes place for longer period , so the power spreads to larger @xmath83 for fixed value of the optical depth . from the te spectrum",
    ", it is not apparent to distinguish between these models within these error bars .",
    "even difference between the instantaneous reionization and ionization by decaying particles can hardly seen . moreover ,",
    "notice that larger optical depth @xmath84 may account for the observational results of the te spectrum , too . of course",

    "peculiar feature of enduring photon emission from particle decays is larger power around @xmath87 ( a few)@xmath88 .",
    "in addition , there is different feature between long and short lifetime : for long lifetime , the spectrum is rather flat , while there is a dip at @xmath89 for short lifetime .",
    "thus , ee spectrum hoped to be seen by planck satellite or even wmap should ( dis)prove the photons from decaying particles in the near future .    to end this section , we comment on the compton @xmath90-parameter .",

    "we have studied comprehensively the ionization history of the universe by photons emitted from decaying particles , together with the effects of stars , quasars , and shown that the decaying particle can explain rather large optical depth observed by wmap without conflicting other astrophysical and cosmological constraints .",
    "one of the amazing fact is that the lifetime of order @xmath58 sec ( in other words , @xmath93 ) is not necessarily required for successful scenario , and larger parameter space is allowed .",
    "since the early star formation ejecting uv photons may be difficult to lead large optical depth without adjusting parameters beyond their natural values , this alternative is at least as good as them .    for @xmath94 ev , larger lifetime",
    "is prohibited , because the emitted flux exceeds the observed diffuse photon background , and @xmath95 sec is only allowed in these cases . on the other hand , if some bump is observed in the photon spectrum , it could be a great clue for decaying particle scenario .",
    "longer lifetime is also allowed for @xmath96 ev . in the limiting case",
    ", the decaying particle can be the dark matter , provided that its lifetime is around @xmath65 sec .",

    "@xcite , in which they investigated for decaying neutrino dark matter and thus using hot dark matter scenario . in this case ,",
    "ionization fraction becomes unity at @xmath97 , which conflicts with sdss results .",
    "in addition , eurd observation may falsify decaying particle scenario with @xmath98 ev , but it needs careful look , since their conclusion will change if the abundance of galactic dark matter near the sun is one third of their applied value @xcite .",
    "observation of cmb spectrum is very powerful .",
    "although instantaneous reionization suggests optical depth @xmath99 , higher optical depth may be favored for the observed te spectrum by wmap if the decaying particle scenario is correct , where slow reionization takes place .",
    "it is somewhat difficult to discriminate from each other only by te spectrum .",
    "however , the differences in the ee spectrum is tremendous so we hope that even the lifetime of the decaying particle will be measured by planck .    finally , we comment on what can be a candidate for this decaying particle . in the context of no - scale",
    "supergravity , scalar particles remain massless at the tree level",
    ". they may acquire their masses at one - loop order . among them , saxion , the scalar partner of axion in supersymmetric theory , might be the best candidate . if we consider the hadronic axion model , the lifetime is estimated as @xcite @xmath100 where @xmath101 is the axion decay constant .",
