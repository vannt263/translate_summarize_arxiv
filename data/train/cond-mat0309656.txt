    "catalytically - activated reactions play an important role in various processes in chemistry , physics and biology .",
    "such reactions are involved , as well , in many industrial and technological processes , in which the design of desired chemicals requires the binding of chemically inactive molecules , which recombine only when some third substance - the catalytic substrate - is present @xcite .",
    "one of the simplest examples of such catalytically - activated reactions , which will be discussed here , is provided by the so - called langmuir - hinshelwood scheme @xcite .",
    "this reaction scheme involves two types of reactive species - an @xmath3 and a @xmath4 , which are spread in a gaseous phase in contact with a solid surface - a catalyst , may adsorb onto the surface at specific adsorption sites ( at constant rates @xmath5 ) , desorb from them back to the gas phase ( at constant rate @xmath6 ) , and enter into the reaction @xmath7 at a finite reaction rate @xmath8 , as soon as any two of unlike adsorbed species appear at neighboring adsorption sites .",
    "the reaction product @xmath9 desorbs from the surface instantaneously and leaves the system .    within the conventional mean - field approach @xcite , ( in which one discards the correlations in particles distributions on the catalytic surface ) , one gets , in particular , in the simple limit @xmath10 , @xmath11 and at low particles densities in the gaseous phase , the following large-@xmath12 asymptotical behavior @xmath13 where @xmath14 denote mean surface coverages by the @xmath3 and @xmath4 species at time @xmath12 , respectively , while @xmath15 determines the characteristic time at which the value @xmath16 is approached .",
    "the expression in eq.([1 ] ) can be readily generalized for arbitrary values of @xmath6 , @xmath5 and for arbitrary particles densities in the gas phase , which will result in a somewhat more complex expressions for @xmath17 and for the characteristic relaxation time @xmath15 .",
    "note , however , that the long - time approach to @xmath17 will be still described by an exponential function of time . it is also important to emphasize that the state approached as @xmath2",
    "is believed to be a true @xmath18 @xmath19 state , in which the @xmath3 and @xmath4 particles distributions on the surface are @xmath20-correlated and @xmath17 is independent of the kinetic parameters .    within the last two decades",
    "a considerable progress have been made in the theoretical analysis of the kinetics of _ non - catalytic _",
    "reactions @xcite . here",
    ", a remarkable phenomenon of stochastic segregation has been discovered @xcite , and the effects of correlations and fluctuations in particles spatial distributions on the reaction course have been elucidated , which are in a striking contrast with the conventional mean - field picture @xcite .",
    "these studies resulted in the inception of a novel interdisciplinary domain on the boundary between conventional chemistry and physics - the fluctuation - dominated chemical kinetics .",
    "following the early works on the fluctuation phenomena in chemical reactions @xcite , ziff and collaborators @xcite have questioned the predictions of the mean - field approach in eq.([1 ] ) for the @xmath21 langmuir - hinshelwood scheme .",
    "focussing on the specific example of the oxidation process of the carbon monoxide on platinum surfaces , @xmath22 , ziff et al have observed a behavior which is by far richer and goes far beyond than the traditional mean - field predictions .",
    "in particular , they have discovered that as the @xmath23 gas pressure is lowered the system undergoes a first - order transition from a @xmath23 saturated inactive phase ( zero rate of @xmath24 production ) into a reactive steady state ( non - zero rate of @xmath24 production ) followed by a continuous transition into an @xmath25-saturated inactive phase .",
    "this continuous transition was shown to belong to the same universality class as the directed percolation and the reggeon field theory @xcite .",
    "different aspects of the kinetic and equilibrium behavior in this model have been scrutinized , revealing the importance of many - particle effects .",
    ".    an essential ingredient of the langmuir - hinshelwood model is that the phase confronting the catalytic surface and acting as a reservoir of particles is @xmath26 .",
    "this is not the case , however , in many instances . for many important applications , especially in biological and chemical systems",
    ", the catalytic substrate appears to be in contact with a @xmath1 phase which comprises concentrations of reactive species ( see , fig.1 ) .    in such systems",
    "the reaction kinetics and equilibrium properties may be affected by yet another important process , not included in the previous models ; namely , here the particles can performs long - range concerted excursions inside the bulk liquid phase .",
    "that is , , as depicted in fig.1 , the particles , adsorbed onto the surface being in contact with the bulk liquid phase , can desorb , diffuse rapidly ( with the diffusion coefficient being several orders of magnitude larger than that for a surface diffusion ) within the bulk phase , and then return to the surface at a new position far away from the detachment point .",
    "indeed , it has been shown both experimentally and theoretically ( see , e.g. , refs.@xcite and references therein ) that such bulk mediated excursions ( hereafter abbreviated as the bme ) can be the principal kind of motion for particles . in biological systems ,",
    "such bulk - mediated excursions might play a significant role since here most of the systems include membranes surrounded by fluid environments @xcite ; as an example , one may consider the receptor - ligand reactions which take place on a membrane surface @xcite , or the catalytic efficiency of proteins , which cut the dna molecules ( one dimensional substrates ) at specific sequences @xcite . more generally , bme may be involved in certain `` searching '' processes @xcite .",
    "several prominent features distinguish the situations with a liquid and with a gas phase in contact with a solid substrate .",
    "first , in the case when the solid surface is in contact with a liquid , the desorption of the adsorbed particles is generally much more pronounced than in the latter case ; hence , one expects that the bme process will be more frequent here .",
    "second , appearing in the liquid phase after the desorption event , a desorbed particle will move diffusively , being multiply scattered by the solvent molecules . in view of the geometry of the system , here the motion relative to the surface",
    "is effectively one - dimensional , such that , after desorption and excursions in the bulk , any particle will be @xmath27 to return back to the surface , in contrast with the situation with the gaseous phase in which the particle may travel away from the surface almost indefinitely .     a sketch of the reactive langmuir - hinshelwood - like system with bulk - mediated excursions .",
    "black and white circles denote @xmath3 and @xmath4 particles , respectively .",
    "( a ) denotes a particle configuration , in which reaction takes place .",
    "solid and dashed curved lines depict effective trajectories of @xmath3 and @xmath4 particles , respectively . ]",
    "last but not least , repeated many times , the adsorption / desorption events separated by the bulk - mediated excursions , will result in effective motion of any given particle along the surface .",
    "a most striking point here is that this motion is @xmath28 , such that with respect to its surface displacements , any given particle performs a `` lvy walk '' ( see refs.@xcite for ample physical discussion ) .",
    "consequently , instead of a familiar gaussian propagator , one finds @xcite that here the distribution @xmath29 of particles displacements along the surface is that of a two - dimensional cauchy process and is characterized by a long @xmath30 tail @xcite : @xmath31 where @xmath32 , @xmath33 being the particles diffusion coefficient in the bulk liquid , while @xmath34 stands for the `` adsorption depth '' and @xmath35 is the `` capture range '' - the distance over which a particle can directly be adsorbed in a single displacement step @xcite .",
    "this implies , in turn , that due to the bme , the distribution @xmath36 of particles displacements @xmath37 along the surface obeys @xcite : @xmath38 @xmath39 being the typical time between the readsorption events , @xmath40 @xcite .",
    "the impact of such a peculiar transport on the kinetics and equilibrium properties of the reaction process in eq.([reaction ] ) has not been elucidated theoretically up to the present time .    in this paper",
    "we analyze the effect of the bulk - mediated excursions of the reactive species on the long - time behavior of the catalytic langmuir - hinshelwood - like reactions , eq.([reaction ] ) , in terms of a simplified model , the model captures only some basic features of the physical system , but still allows to draw several important conclusions .",
    "first of all , we concentrate here on a totally symmetric situation , in which the mean concentrations of the reactive particles in the liquid phase , as well as their adsorption and desorption rates , are equal to each other .",
    "further on , in this model , we focus on the events taking place on the catalytic surface and introduce the presence of a semi - infinite liquid phase containing concentrations of reactive species in an indirect fashion . that is , we assume that continuous inflow of @xmath3 and @xmath4 particles , dispersed in the semi - infinite liquid phase , to the catalytic surface can be modelled as a source , which creates @xmath3 and @xmath4 directly on the surface , independently of each other and at a constant production rate @xmath41 .",
    "furthermore , we suppose that the bme can be taken into account by letting the adsorbed particles to perform random , long - range hopping motion along the adsorption sites of the catalytic surface with suitably chosen hopping probabilities , determined by eq.([disp ] ) .",
    "consequently , we propose here a two - dimensional model which includes two types of reactive species , which react upon encounters , perform long - range ( lvy or , more spcifically , gillis - weiss @xcite ) walks on the lattice and are continuously introduced onto the lattice from a reservoir maintained at a constant chemical potential .",
    "we hasten to remark that this model serves only as a first approximation of the real physical system and there are several other important processes , which may influence the kinetic behavior of the reaction process in eq.([reaction ] ) .",
    "first of all , an assumption that the `` intensity '' of particles creation on the lattice is not varying in time may be inadequate . as a matter of fact , here",
    ", in view of the effectively one - dimensional geometry and diffusive transport in the liquid phase , non - homogenous particle density profiles in the direction perpendicular to the catalytic plane , characterized by a `` depletion '' zone , may emerge .",
    "this will result in the `` intensity '' decaying in time .",
    "on the other hand , here we overestimate mixing effect of long - range bme , supposing that for any particle a jump on distance @xmath37 along the lattice , once chosen with the probability distribution in eq.([disp ] ) , is executed @xmath42 , while in reality the transport via bme on this distance takes some time interval , which is a random variable having a broad distribution .",
    "consequent analysis of these effects requires much more complex approach , which is currently being carried out @xcite .    finally , we would like to note that , apart from its relevance to the reaction process in eq.([reaction ] ) for a catalytic surface in contact with a liquid phase , our analysis sheds the light on the conceptually important question of the effect of mixing on the fluctuation - induced kinetics .",
    "as we have already remarked , for batch @xmath0 reactions , i.e. reactions in which the particles of the reactive species are all initially introduced into the system , in case of equal mean particles densities and diffusive transport , diffusion appears to be a non - efficient mixing channel and the like species tend to segregate spontaneously in the reaction course , which causes deviations from the text - book kinetic behavior @xcite . in presence of a steady inflow of reactive species ,",
    "this effect gets dramatically increased and the deviations from the conventionally expected behavior @xcite are getting even more pronounced @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "it has been shown recently in refs.@xcite , which analyzed kinetics of the batch @xmath0 reactions , involving particles which execute lvy walks , that in this case , under certain conditions , accelerated diffusion destroys effectively the particle - particle segregation and the mean - field behavior prevails .",
    "one may now pose quite a legitimate question whether in situations with a steady inflow of reactive species the lvy walks would provide a sufficiently fast mixing channel and overcome the strong tendency for segregation of like species in the course of the process in eq.([reaction ] ) ?",
    "our answer is negative .",
    "we show that in the situation under study , despite the fact that we strongly enhanced mixing supposing that the bme are executed instantaneously , the state reached by the process in eq.([reaction ] ) as @xmath2 is not a true chemical equilibrium but only a steady - state . as a matter of fact",
    ", we proceed to show that the long - time concentration @xmath17 appear to depend on the kinetic parameters , such as , e.g. , particles diffusivities in the bulk , particles distributions on the lattice are very strongly ( algebraically ) correlated and moreover , the long - time approach to such a steady - state is essentially delayed , as compared to the exponential dependence in eq.([1 ] ) - it is described by a power - law function of time !",
    "the paper is structured as follows . in section 2",
    "we introduce the model and basic notations . in section 3 ,",
    "focussing on the case of batch reactions , we present our analytical approach and reproduce several known results . in section 4",
    "we analyze the steady - state behavior in models with steady particles input , which mimics langmuir - hinshelwood scheme with bulk - mediated excursions , and discuss the long - time approach to such a steady - state .",
    "finally , we conclude in section 5 with a brief summary of our results and discussion .",
    "consider a two - dimensional regular lattice which is brought in contact with a reservoir of particles of two types - an @xmath3 and a @xmath4 , maintained at constant chemical potentials @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "here we restrict our analysis to the special case @xmath45 .",
    "the particles of both species may adsorb onto the lattice at constant rate @xmath41 , desorb from the lattice at rate @xmath46 , an event followed by a long - range instantaneous jump of distance @xmath37 with probability @xmath36 and an immediate re - adsorption .",
    "the particles then react at a constant rate @xmath8 according to the scheme in eq.([reaction ] ) as soon as two of them of unlike species appear on the same lattice site . in most of our analysis",
    "we will focus on the limit @xmath47 , which will allow us to emphasize the `` statistical physics '' , rather than purely `` chemical '' effects .",
    "we will discard the hard - core exclusion between like and unlike species , assuming that the particles coverages are sufficiently small .",
    "now , the long - range jumps performed by the particles of reactive species will be described here within the framework of the gillis - weiss random walks @xcite ( also referred to sometimes as the riemann walks @xcite ) , which represent the lattice version of lvy flights @xcite in the limit @xmath48 .",
    "we will use here a bit more general definition of @xmath36 , than that in eq.([disp ] ) , and supporse that @xmath36 is given by @xmath49 note that the distribution in eq.([distt ] ) reduces to the one in eq.([disp ] ) in the particular case when @xmath50 and @xmath51 . in this case , the parameter @xmath52 .",
    "note also that with this definition of the elementary jump probability , the mean square displacement per step @xmath53 is infinite for all @xmath54 , which implies that such a random walk has an infinite variance @xcite .",
    "the long - tailed distribution of the jump probabilities permits long range jumps and generates a super - diffusive regime .",
    "gillis - weiss walks lead to anomalous diffusion , associated to the dynamic exponent @xmath55 for @xmath56 , @xmath57 , and to conventional diffusion for @xmath58 , corresponding to gaussian random walks , @xmath59 . in the case of interest here ,",
    "i.e. for @xmath60 and @xmath50 , which case mimics the reaction in eq.([reaction ] ) mediated by bulk excursions , one has that in regard to surface displacements , the particles execute random ballistic - type ( with an infinite vellocity ) motion with @xmath61 .",
    "let now @xmath62 and @xmath63 denote the local , ( at point with vector @xmath64 ) , time - dependent coverages of @xmath3 and @xmath4 particles , respectively .",
    "evolution of these properties is governed by the following rate equations    @xmath65",
    "@xmath66    where the dot denotes the time - derivative , the first term on the rhs describes the decrease in particles coverages due to the reaction events , the second and the third terms describe departures and arrivals of the particles at the site @xmath64 at time @xmath12 due to long - range jumps , respectively . note that the summation in the second and the third terms on the rhs of eqs.([dens1 ] ) and ( [ dens2 ] ) extend over all lattice sites , which signifies the long - range character of particles migration , while @xmath67 denotes the time each particle typically spends on each lattice site between the desorption events , @xmath68 . in turn , the fourth terms on the rhs of eqs.([dens1 ] ) and ( [ dens2 ] ) describe the ( random ) contributions to particles coverages due to adsorption of particles from the reservoir , which mimics , in our model , the presence of particles in the bulk liquid phase . in the usual fashion , we admit the following statistical properties of these `` source '' terms : @xmath69 @xmath70 @xmath71 and @xmath72 where @xmath73 is the delta - function , @xmath74 is the correlation parameter and the angle brackets @xmath75 , here and henceforth , denote the volume averages .",
    "consequently , we stipulate that creation of particles on the catalytic surface proceeds completely at random , in space and in time , at a constant rate , which describe arrival of the particles located initially in the bulk liquid phase at progressively longer distances in the direction perpendicular to the catalytic surface .    in what follows , we discuss the behavior of the solutions of the dynamic rate equations , eqs.([dens1 ] ) and ( [ dens2 ] ) under different physical conditions .",
    "to set up the scene , we discuss first the effect of the bme on the kinetics of @xmath76 in the `` batch '' reaction case ; namely , in situations in which all particles of the reactive species which were dispersed intially in the bulk liquid phase were asorbed onto the surface by some `` rapid quench '' ; steady inflow of reactants by the external source is supposed to be absent here , @xmath77 .",
    "we suppose , as well , that at @xmath78 particles desorption from the catalytic surface , and consequently , the bme , are allowed .    in this case , we assume that the initial particles distributions on the lattice are random gaussian , @xmath20-correlated with mean coverages @xmath79 ; that is , @xmath80 and @xmath81 obey : @xmath82 @xmath83 @xmath84 and @xmath85 now , to analyze the time evolution of the mean particles coverages , we make use of the analytical approach first proposed in ref.@xcite for the description of the fluctuation - induced kinetics of irreversible diffusion - limited @xmath0 reactions . in this approach the hierarchy of the reaction - diffusion equations for the higher - order correlation functions has been truncated at the level of third - order correlations .",
    "subsequent works ( see refs.@xcite ) generalized the approach to more complex reaction schemes , e.g. to reversible reactions or reactions involving interacting particles , and also showed that such a truncation is tantamount to the assumption that fields @xmath86 remain gaussian at all times ; this implies that the fourth - order correlations decouple automatically into the product of the pairwise correlations which insures that the third - order correlations vanish .",
    "following ref.@xcite , we write first the local coverages @xmath86 in the form : @xmath87 where @xmath88 denote @xmath89 deviations from the mean coverages @xmath90 . by definition ,",
    "@xmath91 .    further on",
    ", we introduce the pair - correlation functions : @xmath92 @xmath93 and @xmath94 @xmath95 being the correlation parameter .",
    "note that since we have assumed a totally symmetric situation with regard to the adsorption / desorption rates , the correlation fucntions @xmath96 and @xmath97 are obviously equal to each other at any time moment , @xmath98 .",
    "next , averaging eqs.([dens1 ] ) and ( [ dens2 ] ) , we obtain @xmath99,\\ ] ] where we have used the notation @xmath100 , i.e. @xmath101 is the value of the particle - particle pairwise correlations at distance @xmath95 which is equal to the reaction radius @xmath102 ( here , in the lattice version of the model , we assumed that reaction takes place when two particles of unlike species appear at the same site , i.e. @xmath103 ) .",
    "note now that eq.([dens3 ] ) shows that the time - evolution of the mean coverage is @xmath104 coupled to the evolution of the pairwise correlation function .",
    "note also that if the correlations are supposed to be insignificant , @xmath105 , as one generally takes for the mean - field approach , one obtains from eq.([dens3 ] ) that @xmath106 , i.e. the conventional `` law of mass action ''",
    ". this law yields @xmath107 for systems of any spatial dimension and regardless of the way how the particles move in the system . on the other hand , assuming perfect , instantaneous reaction with @xmath108 , one gets that @xmath109 which represents the mathematical formulation of the segregation effect ; as a matter of fact , eq.([dens4 ] ) shows that the time - evolution of the observable - the mean coverage , is guided at any time @xmath12 by the time - evolution of the pairwise correlations in the system ! in case when both species move diffusively , eq.([dens4 ] ) entails an unusual kinetic law @xmath110 @xcite , which thus predicts for @xmath111 a @xmath112 time - evolution of the mean coverage than that defined within the mean - field approach .",
    "note also that for finite @xmath8 equation ( [ dens4 ] ) holds for times @xmath12 sufficiently large such that the fluctuation - induced law @xmath110 determines the long - time asymptotic behavior .",
    "now , to determine analytically the time - evolution of the mean coverage in our case with bme , we have to evaluate the time dependence of @xmath101 which embodies all necessary information on the initial fluctuation spectra and particles dynamics . making use of eqs.([dens1 ] ) to ( [ dens3 ] ) , neglecting the third - order correlations and employing an evident symmetry condition between the @xmath113 and @xmath114 correlation functions , ( @xmath115 )",
    ", we find that @xmath116 and @xmath96 obey the following system of reaction / transport equations :    @xmath117 + \\frac{1}{\\tau_d}\\sum_{\\mathbf{y}}\\phi(y ) \\widehat{{\\cal l}_{\\lambda } } g_{ab}(\\mathbf{\\lambda},t),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    and @xmath118 + \\frac{1}{\\tau_d}\\sum_{\\mathbf{y}}\\phi(y ) \\widehat{{\\cal l}_{\\lambda } } g_{aa}(\\mathbf{\\lambda},t),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath119    note that eqs.([k1]),([k2 ] ) together with eq.([dens3 ] ) are @xmath120 with respect to the mean coverages and pairwise correlations , and permits the evaluation of these quantities .    in order to solve the system of eqs.([k1]),([k2 ] ) and eq.([dens3 ] ) , it is expedient to introduce a pair of discrete fourier transforms : @xmath121 and @xmath122 where @xmath123 denotes the first brillouin zone .    transforming eqs.([k1 ] ) and ( [ k2 ] ) , we get @xmath124\\\\ & + & \\frac{2}{\\tau_d } \\big (   \\widetilde{\\phi}(\\mathbf{k } ) - \\widetilde{\\phi}(\\mathbf{0})\\big ) \\widetilde{g}_{ab}(\\mathbf{k},t)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath125\\\\ & + & \\frac{2}{\\tau_d } \\big(\\widetilde{\\phi}(\\mathbf{k } ) - \\widetilde{\\phi}(\\mathbf{0})\\big)\\widetilde{g}_{aa}(\\mathbf{k},t),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in which equations we have made use of the condition @xmath126 , since random jump process under consideration is symmetric invarient .",
    "equations ( [ m1 ] ) and ( [ m2 ] ) are accompanied by the initial conditions , which follow from the ones in eqs.([in1 ] ) to ( [ in4 ] ) , @xmath127 solution of eqs.([m1 ] ) to ( [ m3 ] ) can be readily obtained explicitly and reads :    @xmath128 \\left[1 - \\exp\\big ( - 4 k \\int_0^t c(t ' ) dt'\\big)\\right].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    we focus first on the perfect reaction case , when @xmath129 . here",

    "hence , the long - time decay of the mean coverage @xmath90 is given by @xmath141 generalization of the result in eq.([genn ] ) for arbitrary @xmath142 is straightforward and yields @xmath143 i.e. precisely the result obtained using a different theoretical approach in refs.@xcite , which studied the kinetics of batch @xmath0 reactions involving particles performing lvy walks .",
    "note also that for @xmath144 , which corresponds to the case of a standard random walk , we recover from eq.([gen ] ) the celebrated fluctuation - induced law @xmath145 @xcite . on the other hand , for sufficiently small values of @xmath146 , such as @xmath147 , fomrula ( [ genn ] ) would give a decay faster than the usual mean field @xmath148 law .",
    "such a behavior is of course specific of the perfect reaction limit @xmath149 .",
    "actually the system becomes perfectly stirred for such small @xmath146 , and the segregation phenomenon seizes to exist , so that the usual @xmath148 decay is recovered .",
    "similar effect has been also obtained for reactions in inhomogeneous systems in ref.@xcite .",
    "we turn now to the borderline case @xmath50 and @xmath51 , which is of special interest here , since it corresponds to the reactions mediated by bulk excursions . here ,",
    "eq.([genn ] ) entails the behavior @xmath150 , i.e. the decay of the mean coverge mediated by the cauchy walks proceeds exactly in the same fashion , as the decay obtained within the conventional mean - field approach @xcite .",
    "this circumstance has prompted the authors of refs.@xcite to conclude that that such a long - range transport may serve as an effective mixing channel which suppresses effectively the `` undesired '' segregation effect . in the next section",
    ", we will examine whether this conclusion remains valid in case of reactions followed by a steady inflow of reactive species .",
    "finally , we note that this special case , in which the `` mean - field '' , purely chemical component , and the decay of correlations contribute to the overall kinetics at the same rate , can be viewed from a different perspective . following the celebrated collins - kimball treatment of imperfect diffusion - limited reactions @xcite",
    ", one may stipulate that here the time - evolution of the mean coverage obeys effectively the second - order rate equation of the form @xmath151 where @xmath152 is the apparent or effective rate constant , dependent both on @xmath8 and on the parameters of the cauchy process .    to determine @xmath152 , we proceed as follows",
    ": we notice first that for finite @xmath8 the mean coverage defined by eq.([dens3 ] ) can not decrease faster than the @xmath153 law expected from the mean - field kinetics .",

    "now , from eq.([lu ] ) we have that in this case @xmath157 substituting this expression into eq.([dens3 ] ) and searching for the solution of the resulting equation in the form @xmath158 , we obtain @xmath159 recollecting next that @xmath68 and @xmath160 , where @xmath161 , we may rewrite @xmath152 as @xmath162 which relates the kinetic behavior of the `` batch '' reactions with the bme to the physical parameters describing our model .",
    "let us now consider the case when the reaction process in eq.([reaction ] ) is accompanied by a steady inflow of particles onto the lattice , which mimics in our model of reactions with bulk - mediated excursions arrivals onto the surface of particles initially dispersed in the liquid phase from progressively larger and larger distances in the direction perpendicular to the surface .",
    "the statistical properties of external sources are defined in section 2 , eqs.([p1 ] ) to ( [ p4 ] ) .",

    ", there is an ample evidence that all three of these statements are wrong because of the segregation effects in case when reactive particles perform conventional diffusive motion on a two - dimensional surface in presence of a steady inflow @xcite .",
    "however , as demonstrated in refs.@xcite and in the section 3 of the present paper , for batch reactions with the bme , which ultimately result in random ballistic - like motion along the surface , the segregation effect is suppressed and , apart of some renormalization of an the reaction constant @xmath8 , kinetic behavior follows an essentially mean - field type dependence @xmath167 .",
    "consequently , it is not @xmath168 @xmath169 clear whether @xmath101 governs ( or even contributes to ) the long - time evolution of the system in the case @xmath50 and @xmath60 .",

    "we find , after elementary calculations , that in the long - time limit ( in which the asymptotic behavior in eq.([exp ] ) holds ) the fourier - image of the pairwise correlation function @xmath116 reads :    @xmath170\\right ) + \\frac{q_{ads}}{2 } \\int^t_0 \\exp\\big [ - 2 a |{\\bf k}|^{\\mu } \\frac{t}{\\tau_d } - 4 k \\int^{t}_{t ' } c(t '' ) dt '' \\big ] dt'.\\ ] ]    now , some analysis shows that due to the presence of the function @xmath171 in the exponential , the second term on the rhs of eq.([prop ] ) is negligibly small compared to the first one .",
    "consequently , we focus on the behavior of the dominant contribution",
    ".    consider first the long - time evolution of @xmath101 , which enters the rhs of eq.([dans ] ) and hence , may affect the evolution of the observable - the mean coverage .",
    "inverting the fourier transform , we find then that in the long - time limit @xmath101 obeys , in @xmath142-dimensions and for arbitrary @xmath146 , @xmath172\\right)\\\\   & \\sim&-\\frac{q_{ads } \\tau_d}{8 \\pi a}\\int_0^{2\\pi}\\frac{dk}{k^{\\mu - d+1 } }   \\left(1 -   \\exp\\big [ - 2 a |{\\bf k}|^{\\mu } \\frac{t}{\\tau_d}\\big]\\right)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] analyzing the behavior of @xmath101 , defined in eq.([last ] ) , one notices first that @xmath173 for @xmath174 , which signifies that in such situations @xmath101 is a growing with @xmath12 function .",
    "this is precisely the case discussed in refs.@xcite , which concerned with the behavior of two - dimensional @xmath0 reactions involving diffusive species in presence of external uncorrelated input of particles . on the other hand , for @xmath175 the stationary value",
    "@xmath176 is finite .",
    "consequently , in the case of interest here , i.e. for @xmath50 and @xmath51 , we find from eq.([last ] ) the following behavior : @xmath177 which predicts that the stationary value of @xmath101 , i.e.@xmath178 is approached as a power - law , at a rate which is proportional to the first inverse power of time ! note also that @xmath179 , which means that pairwise correlation slow down the @xmath180 reaction .    substituting the expression in eq.([j ] ) into eq.([dans ] ) and solving the resulting equation in the limit @xmath2 , we find eventually that at sufficiently long times the mean coverage obeys @xmath181 where we have made use of relations @xmath52 and @xmath68 , and the characteristic relaxation time @xmath182 is given by @xmath183 now , several comments are in order .",
    "first of all , we notice that in contrast to the behavior in eq.([1 ] ) , predicted by the mean - field approach , the actual approach to the @xmath184-state is algebraic , proportional to the first inverse power of time .",
    "this means that the long - time relaxation of the mean coverage to its @xmath2 value is @xmath185 entirely by the time - evolution of the pairwise correlations .",
    "second , @xmath17 is generally different of the mean - field value @xmath186 and reduces to it only when the particles diffusion coefficient in the bulk liquid phase @xmath187 .",
    "the fact that @xmath17 depends on such a `` kinetic '' parameter as @xmath33 is also quite a prominent feature - it shows unambiguously that in the reaction process under study there is no true @xmath19 but rather a @xmath188 !    to emphasize this point , we turn finally to the analysis of the particle - particle correlations on the surface in the limit @xmath184 , embodied in the pairwise correlation function @xmath189 . from eq.([prop ] ) we find then that these stationary correlations obey for @xmath50 and @xmath60 : @xmath190,\\ ] ] which yields , in the limit @xmath191 , the following behavior @xmath192 therefore , the decay of correlations in the particles distributions on the surface is algebraic , i.e. the particles distributions show a quasi - long - range order . as a consequence , despite the fact that the bme process effectively mixes the system in the case of batch reactions restoring the mean - field - type behavior and suppressing the segregation effects , in the case with a steady inflow of particles , which mimics the presence of particle s concentrations in the bulk liquid phase , the bulk mediated excursions fail to establish chemical equilibrium .",
    "to conclude , in this paper we have analyzed the effect of the bulk - mediated excursions of reactive species on the long - time behavior of the catalytic langmuir - hinshelwood - like reactions in systems in which a catalytic surface confronts a @xmath1 phase , containg concentrations of reactive particles .",
    "such bulk mediated excursions result from particles desorption from the lattice , subsequent fast diffusion in the liquid phase and eventual adsorption on the surface far away from the intial detachment point .",
    "repeated many times , such bme yield an effectively long - range particles transport along the catalytic surface with superdiffusive related properties .",
    "we have considered both `` batch '' reactions , i.e. reactions in which all particles of reactive species were initially adsorbed onto the surface , and reactions followed by a steady inflow of particles onto the catalytic surface .",
    "the latter situations , under certain assumptions , mimic the presence of particles concentrations in the bulk liquid phase which act as a reservoir of particles .",
    "we have shown that for `` batch '' reactions , in accord with previous analysis @xcite , the bme provide a very effective mixing channel which suppresses the segregation effects , such that the mean - field - type behavior prevails . on contrary , for reactions followed by a steady inflow of particles , we observe essential departures from the mean - field behavior and find that the mixing effect of the bme is insufficient to restore chemical equilibrium . we show that here a steady - state is established as @xmath2 , in which the limiting value of mean coverages of the catalytic surface depends on the particles diffusion coefficient in the bulk liquid phase and the particles distributions on the lattice are strongly , algebraically correlated .",
    "moreover , the relaxation to such a steady - state is described by a power - law function of time , in contrast to the exponential time - dependence describing the approach to equilibrium in perfectly stirred systems .",
    "the authors greatly acknowledge helpful discussions with r.kimmich and p.levitz .",
