    "all these measurements have been made from space , with the _ spitzer _ and _ hubble _ telescopes .",
    "exoplanet atmosphere detection from the ground has so far been elusive , despite many tries ( e.g. deming et al . 2007 ; snellen & covino 2007 ; snellen 2005 ) . yet",
    ", ground - based detection capability would greatly facilitate studies of hot jupiter atmospheres .",
    "hot jupiters are jupiter - mass planets in 3 to 9 day period orbits",
    ". very hot jupiters ( vhjs ) are those in 1 to 3 day period orbits .",
    "these planets are heated primarily from incident radiation from their parent stars .",
    "the closer the planet is to the star , the hotter the planet will be .",
    "vhjs orbiting solar - type stars may have effective temperatures , @xmath3 , as high as 25003000k .",
    "therefore , vhjs may be as hot as brown dwarfs or very low - mass stars . in this case",
    ", the contribution of the thermal emission from the planet to the total light of the planet - star system will be significantly high , and could be detected in the optical or near - infrared during secondary transits .",
    "eleven transiting vhjs are currently known ( see table 1 ) .",
    "we explore the thermal radiation contribution of these planets at wavelengths between v and k - band ( 0.52.5@xmath2 m ) , and the prospects of detecting their secondary transits with current ground - based instruments .",
    "our study focuses on the thermal emission from the planets lower atmosphere , defined to be in the 1 to @xmath4 bar pressure range .",
    "for vhjs at optical wavelengths one usually thinks of the reflected light without considering that , depending on the vhj effective temperature , thermal emission could dominate reflected light .    the effective temperatures of externally heated extrasolar planets can be estimated from energy balance as @xmath5^{1/4 } , \\ ] ] where @xmath3 is the temperature of the planet , @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the effective temperature and the radius of the star ,",
    "@xmath8 is the star - planet orbital separation , and @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the re - radiation factor and the bond albedo of the planet .    given the planets effective temperatures , their thermal and reflected fluxes can be computed using @xmath11 for the thermal flux , and @xmath12 for the reflected flux , where @xmath13 is the stellar surface flux divided by @xmath14 , @xmath15 , assuming lambert s law ( e.g. , rowe et al . 2006 ) , and @xmath16 is the radius of the planet .",
    "@xmath17 is the distance from the planet to earth .",
    "we computed temperatures for each known vhj from eq .",
    "( 1 ) , adopting published masses , radii , and effective temperatures for the host stars ( see table  1 ) .",
    "the orbital separations were derived from the mass of the stars and the planets , and the published orbital periods .",
    "the parameter @xmath9 describes how the stellar radiation absorbed by a planet is redistributed in its atmosphere .",
    "the absorbed radiation can be reradiated back to space , advected around the planet , or a combination of both .",
    "if the radiative timescale is shorter than the advective timescale , the incident radiation will be reradiated back to space , in which case @xmath18 . in the opposite case ,",
    "atmospheric circulation redistributes the energy around the planetary atmosphere before it can get reradiated , and @xmath19 .",
    "recent studies of the day - to - night side brightness variations of @xmath20 andromedae b ( harrington et al .",
    "2006 ) , and hd189733b ( knutson et al . 2007 ) , indicate that both scenarios are possible .",
    "we consider values of @xmath9 = 2/3  1/4 to bracket the possible range .",
    "the bond albedo @xmath21 is the fraction of incident stellar radiation reflected by the planets atmosphere .",
    "@xmath21 depends on a planet s chemical composition , which in turn depends partly on temperature .",
    "we consider the cases @xmath21 = 0 , 0.3 , and 0.5 .",
    "observations indicate that the albedos of hot jupiters are in fact very low ( @xmath21 @xmath22 0.15 ; rowe et al .",
    "2006 ; harrington , priv . comm . ) .",
    "model atmospheres also suggest these planets are dark ( e.g. marley et al .",
    "even so , we include @xmath21 = 0.3 and 0.5 to illustrate possible unexpectedly reflective cases .",
    "vhjs may be as bright as @xmath21 = 0.3 if covered by homogeneous pure silicate clouds at one millibar level or higher altitudes ( marley et al .",
    "1999 , seager et al .",
    "2000 , sudarsky et al .",
    "if they have patchy silicate or iron clouds , then @xmath21 will be @xmath22 0.3 , as the stellar radiation can penetrate below the clouds and be absorbed by gas - phase molecules ( hood et al .",
    "2007 ; submitted ) . of most relevance to this work",
    "is that vhj atmospheres are too hot on the substellar side for silicate or iron clouds to form .",
    "table 1 gives the expected @xmath3 for each known transiting vhj , for the @xmath9 and @xmath21 values above .",
    "the table includes formal errors derived from eq .  1 and published parameters of each system .",
    "the maximum expected temperatures in the table reveal two groups of vhjs .",
    "one with @xmath23 @xmath24 2600k , that includes ogle - tr-56b and ogle - tr-132b , and a second group with @xmath23 @xmath22 2200k , that includes the other nine planets .",
    "ogle - tr-56b and ogle - tr-132b are the most likely candidates for detection .",
    "a successful detection of radiation from transiting extrasolar planets depends on the ratio of fluxes emitted by the planet and the star at a given wavelength .",
    "figure  1 shows the computed model stellar fluxes for ogle - tr-56 and ogle - tr-132 , between 0.5 and 2.5@xmath2 m , and their expected thermal emission and reflected light fluxes , based on the @xmath3 and @xmath21 values from  2.1 .",
    "the stellar fluxes are derived using grids of kurucz ( 1993 ) models , interpolated for the specific @xmath25 , [ fe / h ] , and log@xmath26 values of ogle - tr-56 and ogle - tr-132 .",
    "stellar parameters for ogle - tr-56 have been measured by santos et al .",

    "we derive thermal emission and reflected light fluxes from eqs .",
    "( 2 ) and ( 3 ) , assuming the planets and the stars emit as blackbodies .",
    "we consider two temperature scenarios : 1 ) @xmath9 = 1/4 and @xmath21 = 0.5 , where the planetary fluxes in the optical are dominated by reflected light ( such high albedos are unlikely for vhjs , see  2.1 ) , and 2 ) @xmath9 = 2/3 and @xmath21 = 0.05 , close to the @xmath9 = 2/3 ; @xmath21 = 0.0 scenario , to illustrate the significantly lower contribution of reflected light versus thermal emission for very low albedos .",
    "the expected temperatures of ogle - tr-56b and ogle - tr-132b in scenario 2 ) are 2852 @xmath28 24k and 2581 @xmath28 35k .",
    "we go beyond blackbody models by including in fig .",
    "1 the hubeny et al . ( 2003 ) models for irradiated planets at @xmath3 = 2600k , with and without tio / vo molecules in their atmospheres . in the latter case ,",
    "tio and vo have condensed into solids , no longer contributing to the opacity .",
    "tio and vo are such strong absorbers that the incident stellar radiation is absorbed at an altitude where reradiation dominates over advection , potentially leading to very hot planetary atmospheres on the substellar side .",
    "the presence of tio and vo is furthermore expected to create a temperature inversion in the lower atmosphere in some cases ( e.g. , metal rich , see also fortney et al .",
    "2006 ) , leading to emission lines and making the planet flux at some wavelengths brighter than blackbodies of the same temperature .",
    "secondary transits can be detected at any given wavelength if the planet - to - star flux ratios , @xmath30 , are high enough . in terms of magnitudes , the transits are detectable if the difference in magnitude during transit , @xmath31mag@xmath32 , is larger than the photometric precision of the observational light curves , @xmath33 .",
    "@xmath34 mag @xmath32 is derived as @xmath35 where @xmath36 is either the thermal emission flux , @xmath37 , or the reflected light flux , @xmath38 .",
    "detectability can be further increased by binning the transit data , as done for example by deming et al .",
    "( 2005 ) for hd209458b .",
    "the photometric precision of the light curves is then @xmath33/@xmath39 , where @xmath40 is the time duration of the bins .",
    "figure 2 shows the expected @xmath31mag@xmath32 during secondary transits of ogle - tr-56b and ogle - tr-132b , for the thermal emission and reflected light cases in fig .  1 .",
    "a detailed description is given in the figure s caption .",
    "the stellar and planetary fluxes have been integrated over two model filter passbands with fwhms = 0.1@xmath2 m , centered at 0.76@xmath2 m and 0.91 @xmath2 m .",
    "those passbands resemble the @xmath41 and @xmath42band filters of the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; fukugita et al .",
    "1996 ) .",
    "we also show the achievable @xmath33 for ogle transit light curves at optical wavelengths ( horizontal dashed lines in fig .",
    "2 ) for integration times of @xmath40 = 1 , 120 ( 3@xmath43 ) , and 120(1@xmath43 ) minutes .",
    "the transits of both planets last about 120 min , so the two bottom lines represent the 1@xmath43 and 3@xmath43 level photometric precision that would be achieved by binning @xmath33 = 1.0 mmags / min light curve data over the entire duration of the transits ( see below and  4 ) .    to compare our estimates with @xmath33 from ogle primary transit light curves , we give the average @xmath33 and exposure times per data point in table  2 .",
    "assuming no correlation between photometric precision and filter passbands , @xmath33 varies between 0.83 and 1.18 mmags / min , depending on the instrument and the target .",
    "here we have excluded the magellan / imacs values because its low photometric precision results from instrumental effects ( winn et al .",
    "we therefore reasonably assume an average @xmath33 of 1.0 mmags / min .",
    "secondary transits of extrasolar planets are normally pursued in the infrared , where @xmath44 is higher than in the optical .",
    "we argue that , for the right combination of stellar and planetary parameters , the thermal emission from some vhjs could be detected at optical wavelengths during secondary transits .",
    "our investigation of all known transiting vhjs concludes that only two of them , ogle - tr-56b and ogle - tr-132b , have the right combination of stellar and planetary parameters to be hotter than 2600k . at those temperatures thermal emission dominates over",
    "reflected light emission .",
    "therefore thermal emission could be detected during secondary transits in the optical .",
    "ogle - tr-56b is the most promising candidate for detection , in either @xmath41 or @xmath42band .",
    "ogle - tr-132b could also be detected in @xmath42band , but the prospects are lower . reflected",
    "light emission is similar in both filters , and a factor of 1020 less than the thermal emission if the planets are very hot .",
    "observations in @xmath42band are better suited for detecting thermal emission from these two planets than ground - based observations at other optical or near - ir passbands . the better performance of @xmath42band versus @xmath41band is clearly illustrated in fig .  2 . at shorter wavelengths ,",
    "e.g. 0.500.65@xmath2 m , @xmath45 decreases considerably ( see fig .  1 ) . at near - ir wavelengths ,",
    "the expected @xmath45 are higher , but the effect of the atmosphere on ground - based observations produce lower quality light curves ( snellen & covino 2007 ; daz et al .",
    "2007 ) .",
    "the transits of ogle - tr-56b and ogle - tr-132b last for about two hours . by binning @xmath42-band light curves with @xmath33 = 1.0 mmag / min over the duration of the transits ( in - transit and out - of - transit bins of the same duration ) , thermal emission from ogle - tr-56b",
    "could be detected with @xmath24 5@xmath43 significance after three secondaries , if the planet emits as a blackbody with @xmath3 @xmath24 2500k .",
    "if the planet emits as predicted by the hubeny et al .",
    "( 2003 ) models with tio / vo , the expected transit depth is 0.04% ( filled magenta squares in fig .  2 ) .",
    "the transit could be then detected with @xmath24 6@xmath43 significance after three transits . in the case of ogle - tr-132b , four secondary transits are needed for a 5@xmath43 significance detection .",
    "one might expect that cooler vhjs around brighter stars would be as promising or more so than the more distant and fainter ( yet hotter ) ogle - tr-56b and ogle - tr-132b . in principle , slightly cooler planets around brighter stars should be just as favorable , because the brighter stars have lower poisson photon noise . in practice ,",
    "@xmath33 is limited for bright stars in two ways . on small telescopes",
    "atmospheric scintillation limits @xmath33 from reaching the photon noise limit ( @xmath33 from scintillation is typically several millimags ) . on large telescopes",
    "the limit is usually imposed by the absence of suitable nearby comparison stars within their small fields of view .",
    "any newly discovered transiting vhjs should be examined for the possibility of detecting their thermal emission at optical wavelengths .",
    "in particular hot vhjs orbiting bright stars with a binary star companion would be ideal .",
    "such detections will provide important clues about the energy processing mechanisms undergoing in the atmospheres of those planets .",
