    "it is well known that neutrino masses are one of the most promising open windows to physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) . simply by adding extra heavy right - handed neutrinos to the sm particle content , neutrino masses arise in a simple and natural way in the so called type - i seesaw  @xcite .",
    "the aim of our work @xcite is constraining the additional neutrino mixing by using a set of electroweak ( ew ) and flavour observables .",
    "for some other recent works on this topic see references  @xcite . +",
    "once the new heavy states that we have added are integrated out , the sm - seesaw theory that remains , and which is valid till a given energy scale @xmath2 , can be considered as a low energy effective theory where the new phenomenology is encoded in a set of effective operators .",
    "the first one is the dim-5 weinberg operator @xcite that after ew symmetry breaking ( ewsb ) generates the masses of the light neutrinos @xmath3 : @xmath4 where @xmath5 denotes the sm higgs field and @xmath6 is the majorana mass allowed for the right - handed neutrinos by the sm gauge symmetry .",
    "notice that since this operator violates lepton number symmetry ( l ) by two units , light neutrino masses violate this accidental symmetry of the sm .",
    "+ at dim-6 the only  @xcite operator that appears at three level is : @xmath7 which conserves @xmath8 , and which after ewsb generates non - canonical kinetic terms among the active neutrinos of the sm",
    ". then , after diagonalizing and normalizing the operator to bring the kinetic terms to its canonical form , it induces non - unitarity in the mixing matrix that appears in lepton charged current interactions . as a result , the pontecorvo - maki - nakagawa - sakata mixing matrix @xmath9 is not going to be unitary and to stress that we call it @xmath10 . the deviations of @xmath10 from unitarity are given by the @xmath11 mixing matrix in the following way : @xmath12 where @xmath11 is related with the active - heavy neutrino mixing @xmath13 as follows : @xmath14 since @xmath11 is hermitian , eq .",
    "[ eq : n_matrix ] represents the most general parametrization  @xcite for @xmath10 .",
    "+ if the smallness of @xmath3 ( light neutrino masses ) comes only from the suppression of the new heavy scale @xmath6 , the mixing @xmath11 is going to be much more suppressed since it has two powers of the same heavy scale ( compare eq .",
    "[ eq : weinberg_op ] and eq .",
    "[ eq : dim6_op ] ) .",
    "thus experimental verification turns extremely challenging .",
    "alternatively , the smallness of light neutrino masses may naturally stem from an underlying approximate symmetry  @xcite of the theory instead of a huge hierarchy of masses . since dim-5 operator violates @xmath8",
    "if we impose an approximate lepton number symmetry to the model , the operator becomes suppressed and as a result light neutrino masses become small .",
    "what is more , since dim-6 operator conserves @xmath8 and remains unsuppressed , the mixing can be arbitrarily large .",
    "this is known in the literature as inverse@xcite / linear  @xcite seesaw models . in particular , the only  @xcite dirac and majorana mass matrices that leads to an underlying @xmath8 symmetry are : @xmath15 with @xmath16 and @xmath17 small @xmath18 parameters . by setting all @xmath19 and @xmath20 , @xmath8 symmetry",
    "is indeed recovered with the following @xmath8 assignments @xmath21 and @xmath22 . as a result @xmath23 ( 3 massless neutrinos in the @xmath8-conserving limit ) but an arbitrarily large mixing @xmath11 are obtained . upon switching on the @xmath8-violating parameters in eq .",
    "( [ eq : texture ] ) , we end up with a small masses for the light neutrinos while the mixings are still arbitrarily large . in this work",
    "we derive the bounds on a * completely * general seesaw ( g - ss ) model where the sm is extended by an * arbitrary number * of right - handed neutrinos , all of them are * heavier * than @xmath24 .",
    "the mixing matrix @xmath10 is parametrized by the @xmath25 @xmath11 hermitian matrix via eq .",
    "( [ eq : n_matrix ] ) .",
    "thus the non - unitarity of the pmns matrix is given by 6 free elements .",
    "however , by using the schwarz inequality : @xmath26 we can already set indirect constraints on the off - diagonal entries of the mixing matrix .",
    "in this section i will briefly introduce the set of 28 ew and flavour observables we have used to constrain the additional neutrino mixing .",
    "the full expressions of the observables in terms of the non - unitarity parameters , @xmath27 , @xmath28 ( @xmath29 measured in the @xmath30 decay ) and @xmath31 are given in the original paper @xcite .",
    "the set of observables we have included in the global fit is :    * the @xmath32 boson mass @xmath33 * the effective weak mixing angle @xmath34 : @xmath35 and @xmath36 * four ratios of @xmath37 fermionic decays : @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 * the invisible width of the @xmath37 @xmath42 * ratios of weak decays constraining ew universality : @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 * 9 weak decays constraining the ckm unitarity * 3 radiative lfv decays : @xmath51 , @xmath52 and @xmath53    we have studied in detail the lepton flavour violating ( lfv ) decays which constraint the off - diagonal elements of the @xmath11 matrix . since these processes become unsuppressed by the loss of the gim cancellation we consider them worth investigating . a comparison summarizing the present relative importance of these observables constraining the off - diagonal elements of @xmath11 ( solid lines ) is presented in fig .  [ fig : bounds ] .",
    "as can be seen , the radiative decay @xmath54 presently dominates .",
    "however , regarding future expectations ( dotted lines ) , the constraints on @xmath55 will be dominated by @xmath56 or @xmath1 conversion in nuclei rather than by @xmath54 . on the other hand , the present and future sensitivity to @xmath57 and @xmath58",
    "is completely dominated by the radiative decays @xmath59 .",
    "in particular , the constraints on @xmath60 from the lfv decays of the @xmath37 and higgs bosons , @xmath61 and @xmath62 , are at least one or three orders of magnitude weaker than the bounds from radiative decays respectively . for these reasons , the three radiative decays will thus be added to the global . however , since these processes depend on the heavy majorana scale that is running in the loops , they could be considered as model - dependent processes . in such a way ,",
    "we have performed two different global fits : the first one with the set of 28 observables which include the lfv decays , and the second one with just the 25 lepton flavour conserving ( lfc ) observables that does not include the three rare decays .    % cl constraints on @xmath63 from lfv observables .",
    "solid lines represent current experimental bounds while dotted lines represent future sensitivities .",

    "we have performed two separate markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) simulations with the two sets of 28 and 25 observables that scan over the free parameters of the g - ss and as a result we obtain these frequentists contours at 1@xmath65 ( in red ) , 90@xmath66 ( in black ) and 2@xmath65 ( in blue ) showed in figure  [ fig : contours ] .",

    "these bounds are expressed in the quantity @xmath71 .",
    "thus , the diagonal elements @xmath72 correspond to the sum ( in quadrature ) of all mixings @xmath73 of the individual extra heavy neutrinos @xmath74 to a given sm flavour @xmath27 and represent an upper bound on each individual mixing .",
    "concerning the diagonal bounds , we obtain a non - zero value with a significance close to @xmath70 for @xmath75 and @xmath76 while an upper bound for @xmath77 . regarding the off - diagonal entries , the indirect bounds from lfc processes",
    "can be compared with the direct constraints from lfv observables .",
    "interestingly , the constraint from @xmath54 strongly dominates over all others leading to a bound one order of magnitude better @xmath78 in the @xmath79 entry , while the @xmath80 and @xmath81 values are rather dominated by the indirect constraints from the schwarz inequality ( comparison between the lfc and lfv rows ) .",
