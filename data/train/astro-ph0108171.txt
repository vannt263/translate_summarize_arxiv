    "different galaxy formation scenarios provide distinct predictions for the space densities and masses of evolved galaxies at redshifts beyond @xmath38 . in monolithic collapse scenarios , massive galaxies form early over a dynamical time ( e.g.  eggen , lynden - bell , & sandage 1962 ) and passively evolve to the present epoch .",
    "the co - moving space density of evolved galaxies is therefore expected to remain constant and the intrinsic luminosities of these galaxies are expected to increase gradually with increasing redshift . in hierarchical formation scenarios ,",
    "massive galaxies form later through mergers of low - mass galaxies over a significant fraction of the hubble time ( white & rees 1978 ) .",
    "the bulk of star formation and mass assembly occurs much later and the co - moving space density of evolved galaxies is expected to decline steeply with redshift at @xmath0 . while various surveys have identified some luminous galaxy populations at @xmath39 ( e.g.  steidel et al .",

    "1999 ) , the connection between these galaxies and typical present - day galaxies is unclear . on the other hand , comparisons of statistical properties of evolved high - redshift galaxies and local elliptical galaxies",
    "may provide a direct means of discriminating between competing galaxy formation scenarios ( e.g.  kauffmann & charlot 1998 ) .",
    "evolved galaxies may be characterized by their intrinsically red colors due to the lack of ongoing star formation that provides most of the uv light in typical galaxy spectral energy distributions . at redshifts beyond unity , where the uv region of the spectrum is redshifted to the visible , optical galaxy surveys are insensitive to evolved galaxies , because of their steep uv spectra",
    ". identifications of evolved high - redshift galaxies therefore rely on observations carried out at near - infrared wavelengths .",
    "various studies based on near - infrared surveys have , however , yielded inconsistent measurements of the space density of evolved galaxies ( kauffmann , charlot , & white 1996 ; totani & yoshii 1997 ; zepf 1997 ; franceschini et al .  1998 ;",

    "because most of the existing deep , near - infrared surveys observe a sky area of only a few tens of square arc - minutes , the discrepancy is likely due to significant field - to - field variation ( e.g.  daddi et al .",
    "2000 ; mccarthy et al .  2001a ,",
    "b ) . furthermore , because evolved galaxies lack prominent narrow - band spectral features in the uv spectral range , this discrepancy is also likely due to selection biases ( e.g.  totani & yoshii 1997 ) . additional uncertainty",
    "may also arise due to the presence of dusty star forming galaxies that exhibit red colors resembling evolved high - redshift galaxies ( e.g.  graham & dey 1996 ; smail , ivison , & blain 1997 ) .    a complete survey of evolved galaxies over a large sky area is needed to address these issues .",

    "therefore , a wide - field optical and near - infrared imaging survey , with sufficiently accurate colors to yield reliable photometric redshifts , offers an opportunity to identify statistically significant and representative samples of evolved galaxies at @xmath0 .",
    "we initiated the las campanas infrared ( lcir ) survey to obtain and analyze deep near - infrared images and complementary optical images in the @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 , and @xmath43 bandpasses over one square degree of sky at high galactic latitudes ( marzke et al .",

    "we also require that the optical imaging survey reach consistent depths based on the predicted optical and near - infrared colors . the actual depth that we achieved varied from field - to - field and often fell somewhat short of our design goals .",

    ", we list the fields , their j2000 coordinates , and galactic latitudes .",
    "the @xmath1-band imaging survey was carried out at the du pont 2.5  m telescope at las campanas using the cambridge infrared survey instrument ( cirsi ) .",
    "this instrument contains a sparse mosaic of four @xmath78 rockwell hawaii hgcdte arrays ( beckett et al .",
    "1998 ; persson et al .  2001 ) . at the cassegrain focus of the du pont telescope ,",
    "the plate scale of the camera is 0.199 arcsec pixel@xmath25 .",
    "some of the observations were made with a doublet field corrector in front of the dewar window , which produced a plate scale of 0.196 arcsec pixel@xmath25 .",

    "a filled mosaic covers @xmath79 .",
    "this defines our unit field area , henceforth referred to as a `` tile '' .",
    "observations of individual pointings were composed of nine sets of three to five exposures 35 to 45 s in duration with dither offsets of between 8 and 13 arcsec in a rectangular pattern . for a typical @xmath1-band sky brightness of 14.7 magnitudes",
    ", we estimated that a total exposure time of 80 minutes was needed to reach a @xmath2 limiting magnitude of @xmath80 in a four arcsec diameter aperture .",
    "the target integration time was achieved by making three passes on each field .",
    "because it was often impossible to complete three passes of a field within one night , the observations of any given field area were spread over several nights .",
    "standard stars from persson et al .",
    "( 1998 ) were observed three to five times per night .",
    "flat field observations were made using a screen hung inside the dome and were formed from differences of equal length exposures with the dome lamps on and off .",
    "most of our fields are composed of four contiguous tiles arranged to cover a roughly @xmath81 field .",
    "the hdfs field contains seven tiles arranged in an h - shaped pattern to avoid several very bright stars .",
    "the ntt deep and 1511 fields contain tiles that are not contiguous .",
    "this was because the optical data were obtained with the sparse - array geometry bernstein - tyson camera ( btc ) on the 4-m telescope at ctio .",
    "the journal of @xmath1-band imaging observations is given in table 2 , in which columns ( 1 ) through ( 5 ) and column ( 8) list the field , tile number , the 2000 coordinates of the tile centers , total exposure time , and date of observation , respectively .",
    "optical images of the lcir survey fields were obtained either from our own observations or from the literature using various large format ccds at different telescopes .",
    "the journal of optical imaging observations is given in table 3 , which lists the field , telescope , instrument , plate scale , field of view ( fov ) , bandpasses , total exposure time , and date of observation .",
    "a more detailed description of the optical imaging observations will be presented elsewhere ( marzke et al .  in preparation ) .",
    "in this section , we describe the procedures of processing the near - infrared @xmath1-band images of all six fields and summarize the qualities of the available optical images of the hdfs and cdfs regions .",
    "in addition , we discuss astrometric and photometric calibration of these images .",
    "the @xmath1-band images obtained with cirsi were processed using two independent reduction packages , one developed by mccarthy , wilson and chen at carnegie , the other by lewis , sabbey , mcmahon , and firth at the institute of astronomy ( ioa ) .",
    "the carnegie reduction pipeline proceeds as follows .",
    "first , loop - combined images were formed by taking a mean of each loop of three to five exposures obtained without dithering the telescope .",
    "a @xmath2 rejection algorithm was applied to remove cosmic ray events , if there were more than four exposures in a loop .",
    "next , the loop - combined images were divided by the normalized dome flats and grouped together according to their locations on the sky .",
    "the use of a dome rather than dark - sky flat field image allows us to separate the pixel - to - pixel gain variations from the additive sky fringes which are non - negligible for these hawaii arrays .",
    "the flat - field images have been normalized to remove the gain differences between the four detectors .",
    "these are generally less than 5% , except in the case of chip # 3 for which the gain correction is @xmath82% .",
    "next , a bad pixel mask was generated for each night using the flat - field exposures .",
    "initial sky frames were constructed from medians of all frames for individual arrays that lay within a given pointing position .",
    "these sky frames were subtracted from each flat - field corrected image for the purpose of constructing an object mask for each image .",
    "the sky - subtracted images were registered using the offsets derived from the centroids of 5 to 15 stars .",
    "all objects with peak intensities more than @xmath83 above the sky noise were identified and sorted into four categories according to their isophotal sizes .",
    "mask frames were then generated for each dithered exposure accordingly .",
    "next , a sliding - median sky frame was obtained by taking the median of the preceding and succeeding three to five images with the bad pixel and object masks applied . after being scaled by the ratio of the modes in the images ,",
    "the median sky frame was subtracted from the appropriate flat - field - corrected image to remove the fringes due to oh emission lines from the sky that are present in the flat - field - corrected images .",
    "this latter scaling ( typically @xmath84% ) allowed us to remove non - linear temporal variations in the sky level .",
    "finally , the flat - field - corrected and sky - subtracted images were registered and combined using a @xmath2 rejection criterion , a bad pixel mask , and a weight proportional to the inverse of the sky variance to form a final stacked image for each pointing position .",
    "the contiguous @xmath45 tiles were assembled from the 16 stacked images corresponding to the four arrays at four pointings of the telescope .",
    "the array boundaries were registered using stars in the overlap region , which was typically 20 to 30 arcsec in extent .",
    "the four arrays were not perfectly aligned with each other and a significant rotation ( @xmath85 ) was found necessary to bring one of the arrays into registration with the other three .",
    "the final image was constructed by summing the 16 registered stacked images .",
    "a @xmath2 rejection criterion and a weighting determined from the sky variance were also applied in the vicinity of the array boundaries .",
    "a @xmath86 error image was formed simultaneously for each tile through appropriate error propagation , assuming poisson counting statistics .",
    "the ioa based reduction pipeline is similar in conceptual design , although it is written in a somewhat different architecture and contains a few operational differences ( sabbey et al .",
    "the offsets between dithered images were derived via cross - correlations in the ioa pipeline rather than from image centroiding .",
    "the object masks were derived from segmentation maps produced by sextractor ( bertin & arnout 1996 ) rather than using a set of five fixed object sizes as in the carnegie pipeline .",
    "finally , the assembly of the final tiles was completed after the application of a world coordinate system derived from comparison with the apm catalog . in the carnegie pipeline",
    "the astrometry was derived for the completed tiles using the usno astrometric catalog , discussed in   3.3 .",
    "the images of the first three tiles of the hdfs region , the first tile of the ntt field , and the second tile of the 1511 field contained significant artifacts associated with instabilities in the detector reset . these manifest themselves as low spatial frequency bias roll - offs that change shape and amplitude on short timescales .",
    "both the carnegie and ioa pipelines deal with this low frequency signal by fitting low order polynomials to sigma - clipped images on a line - by - line and column - by - column basis . in the carnegie pipeline",
    "this reset correction is applied after the final sky subtraction , in the ioa pipeline it is applied before the flat - field and sky corrections have been determined .",
    "new read - out electronics were implemented in august 2000 , which largely suppress the reset instability .",
    "the full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) of a typical point spread function ( psf ) and the @xmath2 detection threshold in a four arcsecond diameter aperture of each completed tile are given in columns ( 6 ) and ( 7 ) of table 2 , respectively .",
    "the psf was measured to vary by no more than 10% across a tile , but the @xmath87 sky noise was found to vary by as much as 50% across each tile . figure 2 shows the distributions of the fwhm of a mean psf ( left ) and the @xmath2 detection threshold estimated based on mean sky noise in a four arcsecond diameter aperture ( right ) for each completed tile .",

    "next , we applied sextractor to the white light image and determined object extents based on their instrumental colors . because the psf varied between different optical bandpasses by at most 10% in each field , we were able to reliably deblend overlapping objects without erroneously splitting or blending individual objects in the white light image due to a large variation in the psfs of different bandpasses .",
    "this procedure takes into account the intensity contrast between overlapping objects in all bandpasses instead of a single bandpass , allowing a more accurate object deblending for overlapping objects with different instrumental colors .",
    "we adopted a different approach to reliably identify all the faint objects in the @xmath1-band images . because of a non - uniform noise pattern between individual arrays across a single tile , in particular in the join regions between adjacent array images , the zero negative detection criterion would force a significant underestimate of the survey depth in some areas .",
    "an example to illustrate the noise pattern is given in figure 4 , which shows the associated @xmath86 noise image of the tile shown in figure 3 .",
    "we identified objects well into the noise in the @xmath1-band images and used our subsequent calibration of the completeness limits and photometric errors to set the faint magnitude limit of the @xmath1-band catalog .    finally , to ensure accurate measurements of optical and near - infrared colors , we excluded objects that lie within @xmath34 2 arcsec of the edges of each tile .",

    "next , we placed the test objects of a given magnitude at 1000 random positions in an @xmath1 tile and repeated the object detection procedures using the same sextractor parameters . finally , we measured the recovery rate of the test objects as a function of @xmath1-band magnitude .",

    "the large difference between the completeness limits for objects of different intrinsic profiles makes an accurate incompleteness correction of the survey very challenging , because in practice we have no prior knowledge in the intrinsic profile of each source .",
    "it appears that under these circumstances correcting for the incompleteness based on one of these curves becomes arbitrary and therefore less accurate .",
    "we repeated the simulations based on empirical surface brightness profiles determined from the image itself to address this problem and obtain a more meaningful estimate of the survey completeness .",
    "it is clear in figure 5 that the completeness of an image is in practice set by the limit at which we can identify the majority of extended sources and that the survey for the largest disks in the image becomes incomplete at @xmath1 at least 1.5 magnitudes brighter than the 50% completeness limit for point sources .",
    "first , we adopted the stellarity index estimated by sextractor , which according to bertin & arnouts ( 1996 ) is nearly unity for a point source and zero for an extended object .",
    "we identified objects of stellarity @xmath13 0.95 and with an @xmath1-band magnitude between @xmath111 and 18 , and coadded the individual images of these compact sources to form a high signal - to - noise empirical profile for point sources .",

    "the zero - point was found to remain stable between different nights with a scatter of @xmath113 0.04 mag .    to cross check the photometric accuracy of objects identified in the hdfs and cdfs regions , we first compared our photometry with that from the eis project ( da costa et al .",
    "1998 ) on an object - by - object basis .",
    "this clearly revealed an offset in the @xmath42-band photometry for the hdfs .",

    "based on the results of stellar track comparison , we concluded that adjustments of @xmath120 , @xmath121 , and @xmath122 may be needed in order to bring the stellar colors into agreement , where @xmath123 , @xmath124 , and @xmath125 are the photometric zero - points published by the goddard team at http://hires.gsfc.nasa.gov./~research / hdfs - btc/. this also brought our photometry very close to the eis photometry of the same objects in the hdfs region .",
    "accurate photometry of faint galaxies is hampered by the unknown intrinsic surface brightness profiles of the galaxies and because of strong surface brightness selection biases .",
    "accurate total flux measurements of distant galaxies are crucial not only for an accurate assessment of galaxy evolution in luminosity function ( e.g.  dalcanton 1998 ) but also for comparing the observed number counts with theoretical predictions based on different cosmological models .",
    "various approaches to measure the total fluxes of faint galaxies have been proposed .",
    "for example , an `` adapted '' aperture magnitude , also known as a kron magnitude , measures the integrated flux within a radius that corresponds to the first moment of the surface brightness distribution of an object and corrects for the missing flux outside the adopted aperture , which was found to be a constant fraction of the total flux for objects of different surface brightness profiles ( kron 1980 ) .",
    "a simpler way is to measure the integrated flux within a fixed aperture and correct for the missing flux using a growth curve derived from the psf of the image .    to understand how well various approaches are able to recover the total flux for objects identified in the survey",
    ", we performed a series of photometric tests for objects of different brightness and intrinsic surface brightness profiles based on the same simulations as described in   4.3 .",
    "first , we generated test objects of different brightness using a series of psf - convolved model surface brightness profiles .",
    "next , we placed the test objects at 1000 random positions in an @xmath1 tile and ran sextractor on the simulated object image using the same photometric parameters . finally , we compared various photometric measurements with the model fluxes .",
    "we present in figure 6 comparisons of model fluxes and various photometric measurements for objects of different intrinsic surface brightness profiles to the 90% completeness limit of the image .",
    "the left most panel shows the test results for corrected isophotal magnitudes provided by sextractor , the center panel for aperture magnitudes within a four arcsecond diameter , and the right panel for the `` best '' magnitudes estimated by sextractor , which are either kron magnitudes or corrected isophotal magnitudes in cases of crowded areas .",
    "the plotted points are the median residuals and the error bars indicate the 16th and 84th percentiles of the residuals in 1000 realizations .",
    "three interesting points are illustrated in figure 6 .",
    "first , the corrected isophotal magnitudes always underestimate the total flux at faint magnitudes , irrespective of object intrinsic surface brightness profile .",
    "second , the four arcsecond diameter aperture photometry after a small , fixed aperture correction appears to deliver accurate total flux measurements for all but the largest disk model at all magnitudes to the 90% completeness limits .",
    "third , the sextractor `` best '' magnitudes appear to be able to recover the total flux of every profile except for the largest disks at the faintest magnitudes , although it also appears that a small amount of `` aperture '' correction is needed to bring the centroids of the residuals to zero . because galaxies of scale length greater than 0.5 arcsec , corresponding to 0.8 arcsec half - light radius , appear to be rare ( e.g.  yan et al .",
    "1998 ) , we conclude that the corrected four arcsecond aperture magnitude provides the most accurate estimate of the total object flux . although the use of a relatively large aperture results in reduced signal - to - noise ratios and hence a loss in depth , the loss in precision is offset by the improved accuracy in both the total magnitude measurements and the determination of colors from images with a wide range of seeing .",
    "stellar contamination of the final galaxy catalog from the lcir survey is non - negligible , particularly in the hdfs .",
    "an accurate separation of stars from the galaxy catalog is therefore essential for subsequent statistical analysis . to identify stars in the survey fields ,",
    "we can either rely on morphological classification by comparing object sizes and shapes with the psf , or we can classify objects on the basis of their spectral shapes .",
    "neither approach by itself can robustly identify stars at all signal - to - noise levels .    to test the reliability of the stellarity index provided in sextractor at different signal levels , we measured the rate at which a point source has a measured stellarity index less than a threshold value in the completeness test described in   4.3 .",
    "the results are shown in figure 7 .",
    "the solid curve indicates the fraction of the input stars that have a stellarity index @xmath126 as a function of @xmath1-band magnitude .",
    "the dashed curve indicates the fraction of stars that have a stellarity index @xmath127 .",
    "the dotted line indicates the 50% completeness limit ( @xmath112 ) of the test image for a point source .",
    "we found that while sextractor is able to uncover point sources at fairly bright magnitudes , it becomes unreliable at around @xmath128 magnitudes ( i.e.  more than 20% of stars would be misclassified as galaxies ) and unstable at around @xmath129 magnitudes ( where objects are more or less equally divided between compact and extended sources irrespective of their true shapes ) , and therefore can not by themselves be adopted to robustly separate stars from galaxies .",
    "in addition , identifying stars based on morphological classification alone introduces biases against compact sources such as quasars , narrow emission line galaxies , etc .",
    "to test the reliability of comparing object colors with known stellar energy distributions , we first included a suite of empirical stellar templates collected from the literature ( oppenheimer et al .",
    "1998 ; pickles 1998 ; fan et al .",
    "2000 ; leggett et al .",
    "2000 ) in the photometric redshift likelihood analysis ( chen et al .  in preparation ) .",
    "the adopted stellar templates span a wide range in both spectral coverage , from optical to near - infrared wavelengths , and stellar types , from early - type o and b stars to late - type l and t dwarfs .",
    "then we compared the results of photometric redshift analysis with spectroscopic redshift measurements collected from the literature for objects in the hdfs region .",
    "we found that while all the spectroscopically identified stars were accurately identified as stars based on the photometric redshift analysis , @xmath15 10% of the spectroscopically identified galaxies were misidentified as stars .",
    "therefore , we conclude that photometric redshift analysis with our present filter set alone can not robustly separate galaxies from stars .",
    "to improve the accuracy of star and galaxy separation , we investigated a method of combining both approaches .",
    "we first examined the stellarity index estimated for each object by sextractor in all bandpasses . for objects with a stellarity index greater than 0.95 in one or more bandpasses , we used both stellar and galaxy templates in the photometric redshift analysis . for objects with a stellarity index less than 0.95 in all bandpasses , we used only galaxy templates in the photometric redshift analysis .",
    "comparison of photometric and spectroscopic redshifts for objects in the hdfs region demonstrates that all 11 spectroscopically identified stars may be reliably identified in this procedure .",
    "the addition of other colors ( e.g.  @xmath130 & @xmath73 ) will improve the photometric separation of stars and galaxies . at present",
    ", the star and galaxy separation may be inaccurate at faint magnitudes where the stellarity index becomes unreliable .",
    "however , galaxies are likely to dominate the number counts at faint magnitudes ( see   6.2 ) .",
    "figure 8 shows the stellar fraction in the hdfs and cdfs regions based on the results of the star and galaxy separation .",
    "closed circles indicate the mean surface density of galaxies observed in the two fields ( see   6.2 for a detailed discussion ) ; stars indicate the surface density of stellar objects in the hdfs region ; and open triangles indicate the surface density of stellar objects in the cdfs region .",
    "it shows that the star counts increase gradually with the @xmath1 magnitude , while the galaxy counts show a much steeper slope .",

    "specifically , we expect to observe on average @xmath192 galaxies of @xmath68 and @xmath193 galaxies of @xmath180 among @xmath15 270 @xmath1-band detected galaxies at @xmath35 , but only @xmath194 galaxy of @xmath68 and less than one of @xmath180 among @xmath195 @xmath1-band detected galaxies at @xmath196 in a random 25-arcmin@xmath197 region .    on the other hand , because eros and these moderately red galaxies are found to exhibit strong angular clustering ( daddi et al .  2000 ; mccarthy et al .   2001b ; firth et al .",
    "2001 ) , a large disperson in the surface density measurements is expected . to examine the accuracy of the surface density measurements presented in figure 13 , we estimated the field to field variation by measuring the surface density of galaxies of @xmath68 in a randomly selected @xmath198 arcmin@xmath14 region in each tile and compared the measurements between different tiles .",
    "we found that the total number of red galaxies of @xmath199 varies from @xmath200 to @xmath34 40 with a mean surface density of @xmath201 arcmin@xmath20 and an rms dispersion of @xmath202 arcmin@xmath20 .",

    "( 2001b ) .",
    "we therefore conclude that a deep , wide - field survey is necessary not only to identify a large number of red galaxies , but also to obtain accurate estimates of their statistical properties .",
    "we present initial results from the las campanas infrared survey , which is a wide - field near - infrared and optical imaging survey designed to reliably identify a statistically significant and representative sample of evolved galaxies at redshifts @xmath0 and to secure a uniform sample of galaxies of all types at intermediate redshifts .",

    "this suggests that foreground galaxies ( @xmath185 ) may be effectively excluded from the total @xmath1-band population by apply the @xmath142 color selection criterion and that the steep bright - end slope of red galaxy number counts reflects the shape of the bright - end luminosity function of the red population .",
    "red galaxies are strongly clustered , producing strong field to field variation in their surface density .",
