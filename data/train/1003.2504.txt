    "both of these could emit gravitational waves in the frequency band of ground - based laser interferometer gw detectors ( e.g. , ref .",
    "several large - scale interferometric gw detectors have reached ( or approached ) their design sensitivity , and are coordinating to operate as a global array .",

    "@xcite ) . on the other hand , em follow - ups to probable gw events require a clear understanding of the angular resolution of an array of gw detectors .",
    "the angular resolution of an individual gw detector , arising from its antenna beam pattern , is rather poor @xcite .",
    "however , the large baselines of the current gw - detector network facilitate better angular resolution via triangulation .",
    "several localization algorithms have been proposed and the effect of arrival timing uncertainties as well as amplitude information of gws have been investigated @xcite .",
    "quantitative studies of the angular resolution of a network of gw detectors have been conducted by several authors , both for a ground - based detector network and for the future space gw detector lisa @xcite .",
    "a standard approach is to calculate numerically the fisher information matrix , which leads to a method - independent lower bound on the statistical errors of estimated parameters ( see a review in ref .",

    "this particular resolution was then rescaled by the cosine of the wave incidence angle and snr  @xcite .",

    ", we deduce explicit analytical expressions for the angular resolution of an arbitrary gw detector network in terms of observables such as cross - sectional areas of the network and energy flux of the incoming gw .",
    "we use only the time - of - arrival information , ignoring additional ( usually rather poor ) information from the directional - derivatives of antenna beam pattern functions  and therefore arrive at a conservative estimate .",

    "multiple detectors can be treated in the same way as a single detector , since the area formed among several detectors is much less than the area formed by the detector s trajectory over the typical observation time of much longer than minutes .",
    "multiple detectors thus contribute mainly by increasing snr .",

    "long observing time is essential .    for _ short signals _",
    ", besides geometrical area , the angular resolution of a detector network can be improved by maximizing values of @xmath148 in eq .  .",
    "in the _ worst - case _ scenario where the waveform is unknown , the angular resolution largely depends on the noise - weighted correlation of responses between detectors ( eq .  ) . in the _ best - case _ scenario , when wave parameters except for arrival time are known , the best achievable angular resolution strongly depends on the fractional energy flux coupled to individual detectors and does not depend on correlation of data between detectors .",
    "therefore , building detectors of parallel antennae and comparable sensitivity is advantageous for localizing gws in either improving the data correlation ( _ worst case _ ) or balancing fractional energy fluxes among detectors ( _ best case _ ) .    in the _ best - case _ scenario ,",
    "the angular resolution is approximately inversely proportional to the total received gw energy flux weighted by noise .",
    "when the noise spectral density @xmath187 can be replaced with a characteristic value , @xmath188 , it follows from eq .   that for a 3-detector network , @xmath189 where @xmath190 is the gw energy coupled by the network ( c.f .",
    "for gws from coalescing binaries of two neutron stars ( inspiral source ) , even though the mergers occur around 1.5 khz , the noise - weighted energy flux peaks around 150 hz as this is where the ligo detectors are the most sensitive .",
    "this makes the inspiral gw sources relatively low - frequency sources in terms of localization .    for a given detector network of fixed configuration",

    "for sources of known waveforms , we need to focus on maximization of the total coupled energy flux weighted by noise while maintaining a balanced budget for fractional energy flux coupled to individual detectors . for localizing gws of unknown waveforms , it is crucial to maximize the noise - weighted data correlation between detectors and to make use of the maximum dimension of the null - space  @xcite .",
    "we first apply our formulae to the existing detector network , that is , the 3-detector network consisting of the ligo detectors at livingston ( l ) and hanford ( h ) in the us and virgo ( v ) in italy  ( the network is often called the lhv network ) with 4 km - armlengths .",
    "when there are only two detectors available at different sites , say the two ligo detectors ( l and h ) , we can locate the source with 1-dimension angular resolution using eq .  .",
    "the angular separation of the 1-@xmath105 error - bars is @xmath191 where @xmath192 is the distance between the two detectors , @xmath176 is the angle between the 2-detector baseline and wave direction .",
