    ", it is relatively straightforward to fix the initial values for the parameters at the starting scale @xmath84 .    in matter",
    ", the detemination of our renormalised parameters is complicated by the fact that our fermionic cut - off depends on the fermi momentum .",

    "note that we assume that our starting scale @xmath84 is sufficiently large that all physical effects of the fermi sea have been completely suppressed by our cut - off .",
    "hence the dependence of the initial parameters on @xmath32 is merely to compensate for the @xmath32 dependence of our regularisation and renormalisation procedures .",
    "for example , in the case of a simple sharp cut - off , the maximum momentum included is @xmath127 in matter instead of @xmath84 .",
    "it is thus particularly important to correctly renormalise @xmath126 , since this quantity cancels a linear divergence and so can be shifted by a finite amount even for @xmath128 .",

    "the initial values for @xmath130 , @xmath131 and @xmath132 can be determined using similar procedures , although this is not so crucial since these quantities do not contain linearly divergent pieces and so all their @xmath32-dependence is suppressed by powers of @xmath137 .",
    "one convenient choice is to take their starting values to be zero at some large but finite scale @xmath84 .",
    "an alternative is to require that they tend to zero as @xmath128 .",
    "the initial condition for the energy density is most conveniently expressed in terms of @xmath138 which , in the symmetric phase , is simply given by the energy of a free fermi gas , measured relative to the chemical potential , and so its initial value is just @xmath139",
    "we solve the evolution equations numerically with two types of cutoffs .",
    "first , we use the smoothed step - function type of regulator ( called hereafter as @xmath140 ) @xmath141      second , we use a sharp cutoff function denoted @xmath144 chosen to make the calculations as simple as possible @xmath145,\\ ] ] @xmath146 similar boson regulator was used in ref .",
    "@xcite ( see also ref.@xcite ) .    as we can see the fermion sharp cutoff consists of two terms which result in modification of the particle and hole propagators respectively .",
    "the hole term is further modified to suppress the contribution from the surface terms , which may bring in the dangerous dependence of the regulator on the cutoff scale even at the vanishingly small @xmath0 . as an example",
    ", we focus on the parameters relevant to neutron matter : @xmath147 .    we first discuss the results obtained with the smooth cutoff @xmath140 .",
    "we find that the value of the physical gap is practically independent of either the values of the width parameter @xmath143 ( varied within some range ) or the starting scale @xmath84 provided @xmath148 .",
    "the results of the calculations are shown on fig . 1 .    numerical solutions to the evolution equations for infinite @xmath149 and @xmath150  fm , starting from @xmath151  @xmath152 .",
    "we show the evolution of all relevant parameters for the cases of fermion loops only ( thin lines ) , and of bosonic loops with a running @xmath53 ( thick lines ) . all quantities are expressed in appropriate powers of @xmath152.,width=340 ]    at starting scale the system is in the symmetric phase and remains in this phase until @xmath23 hits zero at @xmath153 where the artificial second order phase transition to a broken phase occurs and the energy gap is formed .",
    "already at @xmath154 the running scale has essentually no effect on the gap .",
    "we found very small ( on the level of 1@xmath155 ) contribution to the gap from the boson loops , due to cancellations between the direct contributions to the running of the gap and indirect ones via @xmath49 .",
    "the boson loops play much more important role in the evolution of @xmath49 and @xmath53 .",
    "in fact , they drive both couplings to zero at @xmath156 although at rather slow pace .",
    "we note however , that the effect of the boson loops for the gap may still be more visible if the evolution of the other couplings is included .",
    "the results obtained for the gap correspond to the case of the infinite negative scattering length . to study the bcs - bec crossover we have to solve the evolution equation for a wider range of the scattering lengths , including the positive values .",
    "the corresponding results for the evolution of chemical potential as a function of the parameter @xmath157 are shown in fig.2 .",
    "while the vacuum scattering length is large and negative , the system is in the bcs - like phase with positive chemical potential , whereas if the scattering length is chosen to be large and positive reflecting the existence of a bound state near threshold the system ends up being the collection of weakly overlaping tightly bound pairs with negative chemical potential .",
    "now we turn to the results obtained with sharp cutoff ( fig.3 ) .",
    "one immediate observation is that that the results become starting scale independent as long as @xmath148 similar to the smooth regulator case .",
    "however , the phase transition occurs at lower values of the running scale @xmath158 . at",
    "approximately @xmath159 the value of the gap becomes scale independent .",
    "the gap evolutions obtained with the smooth and sharp regulators , being rather different at intermediate scales , approach each other with decreasing scale resulting in similar values for the physical gap .",
    "this is an encouraging results taking into account that , although the exact results must be independent of the choice of the regulator , in practice it is not garanteed .",
    "the same conclusion also holds for other quantities .",
    "the couplings @xmath160 and @xmath49 first grow with scale and then start decreasing eventually coming to zero .",
    "chemical potential begins to decrease at the point of phase transition and becomes scale independent at @xmath161 .",
    "however , in this case the numerical values of the chemical potentials obtained with different regulators differ by approximately @xmath162 so that this quantity is more sensitive to the details of effective action and to the trancations made .",
    "we note that the sharp regulator can also describe the bcs - bec crossover , although gives somewhat smaller ( negative ) values of chemical potential at @xmath163 .      applying our approach to neutron matter we find a gap comparable to @xmath164 , of the order of 30  mev .",
    "there is a simple explanation for the smaller values ( see @xcite , @xcite or @xcite ) .",
    "the argument can be given most succinctly for weak coupling , where the gap satisfies @xmath165 for nucleon - nucleon scattering , @xmath166 increases relatively quickly with momentum and the resulting reduction in the gap is substantial .",
    "we therefore expect that an extension of our approach to include the effective range should capture this physics . indeed ,",
    "if the `` in - medium '' scattering length is identified with the bethe - goldstone @xmath167 matrix calculated at zero energy but finite momenta @xcite then we obtain the gap @xmath168 8  mev which is already compatible with the commonly accepted value .",
    "of course , this is only a crude estimate and the proper calculations should be done using the momentum dependent part of the four - fermion interaction .",
    "there are several points where our approach could be improved .",
    "we have already mentioned above the effective range effects .",
    "we should also include running of all the couplings and treat explicitly the particle - hole channels ( rpa phonons ) since these contain important physics .",
    "they will allow us to remove the `` fierz ambiguity '' associated with our bosonisation of the underlying contact interaction @xcite .",
    "we would like to include the three - body force effects , which are required to satisfy the reparametrisation invariance theorem @xcite and possibly the long - range forces . as to further applications",
    "we plan to explore the superfluidity of the cold fermionic atoms in traps , temperature dependence of the bec - bsc transitions and the formal relations of the erg with the other many - body approaches .",

    "<S> this situation is quite common both in few- and many - body problem . </S>",
    "<S> one notes that , although we will focus on the systems consisting of nucleons , many aspects of the following discussion are relevant for the other types of fermionic systems , especially fermionic atoms in traps .    </S>",
    "<S> probably the most important dynamical feature of the nucleon - nucleon interaction is the unnaturally large scattering length that makes a perturbative expansion meaningless both for free nucleons and in nuclear matter . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , the presence of the fermi momentum signals the appearance of another scale which further complicates the use of any perturbative technique . </S>",
    "<S> one notes that the use of the perturbation theory for the two - nucleon system in vacuum can be justified only for the hypothetical case of weakly interacting nucleons with a small scattering length.in medium , however , even a weak attraction between nucleons may lead to the intrinsically nonperturbative phenomenon , the superfluidity , characterised by rearrengement of the ground state and appearance of the gap in the spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> the fermions form correlared pairs which , depending on the strength of the interaction , may lead to different physical regimes . the weak coupling regime ( bcs phase ) corresponds to a pair with the spatial size much larger then the radius of the interaction so that no actual bound two - body subsystem is formed , while in the strong regime corresponding to the bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) the fermion pairs form compact deeply bound two - body states .    </S>",
    "<S> it would be an appealing to describe all these regimes by starting at a large initial scale with some eft motivated effective action and then run the scale down to the physical point where the scale parameter vanishes . </S>",
    "<S> thus the results will depend on one physical parameter , the scattering length of the nucleon - nucleon interaction in free space .    </S>",
    "<S> the ideal tool to treat this problem is provided by a variant of the erg approach , based on the average effective action ( aea ) @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the ( aea ) is the generating functional of the one - particle irreducible ( 1pi ) correlation function in the presence of an infrared cutoff scale @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> only fluctuations with momenta larger then @xmath0 are taken into account . </S>",
    "<S> for @xmath1 all fluctuations are included and we arrive at standard effective action from which all physical correlation functions can be extracted . </S>",
    "<S> the evolution equation for the aea has the following one - loop form @xmath2.\\ ] ] here @xmath3 is the second functional derivative of the aea taken with respect to all types of field included in the action . and @xmath4 is a regulator which should suppress the contributions of states with momenta less than or of the order of running scale @xmath0 . to recover the full effective action we require @xmath5 to vanish as @xmath6 0 , in other respects its form is rather arbitrary . </S>",
    "<S> the concrete functional form of the regulator has no effect on physical results provided no approximations / truncations were made . in practice , however , approximations / truncations are always required to render the system of the evolution equations finite and solvable . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , some dependence on the functional form of regulator is inevitable . </S>",
    "<S> the simplest way to estimate this dependence is to solve the system of evolution equations using several choices of regulators . of course </S>",
    "<S> , it does not garantee the fully quantitative estimate of the errors introduced but may at least give an idea about the size of the corresponding uncertainty . </S>"
