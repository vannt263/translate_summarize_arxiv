    "over the past several decades , density functional theory ( dft)@xcite with the local density approximation ( lda)@xcite has been very successful in electronic structure and total energy calculations in many systems .",
    "meanwhile , several hybrid approaches based on the combination of lda with many - body techniques have been proposed to overcome the limitation of lda in strongly correlated electron systems . among these hybrid approaches ,",
    "lda+u@xcite is the most widely used method .",
    "using a more detailed treatment of electronic correlation effects , lda plus dynamical mean field theory ( lda+dmft)@xcite takes the local quantum fluctuations into account and can calculate both ground state and excited state properties .",
    "however , due to the large computational load of dmft , lda+gutzwiller method has recently been developed to calculate the ground state properties of correlated systems@xcite .",
    "all practical calculations with the above hybrid approaches use as input the screened coulomb repulsion u and hund s coupling j parameters for the correlated orbitals , which have to be estimated in advance using experiment data , constrained - lda calculations@xcite or random phase approximation ( rpa)@xcite .    different from the above hybrid approaches which require prior determination of the screened coulomb repulsion u and hund s coupling j parameters , a gutzwiller density functional theory (",
    "gdft)@xcite has recently been proposed as an _ ab initio _ approach which directly takes the coulomb integrals of the local orbitals and incorporates the screening process explicitly through a self - consistent solution of the many - electron wave function . in the gdft",
    ", a gutzwiller form is adopted for the variational wave function to go beyond single slater determinant - based approaches , while the effective single particle picture is retained through the gutzwiller approximation@xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we address an important yet unresolved question in the gdft , i.e. , how to choose the local subspace for the gutzwiller operator such that the most relevant many - body screening processes can be captured in a self - consistent calculation .",
    "an orthogonal tight - binding model for the strongly correlated @xmath0-phase ce is chosen as a prototype to examine the effects of including main onsite screening @xmath1-channels in addition to the localized @xmath3-orbitals into the gutzwiller local subspace . in many lda+@xmath8 , lda+gutzwiller and lda+dmft calculations",
    "such screening processes are usually bypassed by introducing the screened interaction parameters ( e.g. , u and j parameters ) as input between the minimal correlated orbitals ( e.g. , 4f - orbitals for ce ) .",
    "such screened @xmath8 parameter is usually much smaller than the bare atomic value since the screening effects are assumed to be absorbed in it . by the explicit inclusion of some many - body screening processes into self - consistent calculations , one may expect to use the partially unscreened larger input @xmath8 parameter for the calculations in order to obtain the same physical effects . and the fully unscreened @xmath8 parameter ( i.e. , bare atomic value )",
    "should be used as input for the calculations if all the important many - body screening processes are explicitly dealt with . in this paper",
    ", we show that a much larger input @xmath8 parameter close to bare atomic value is needed for the calculations with both @xmath1 and @xmath3-orbitals in the gutzwiller local subspace in order to retain the same physical effects as one uses the screened @xmath8 parameter with minimal @xmath3-orbitals in the gutzwiller local subspace for @xmath0-ce .",
    "therefore the treatment of @xmath1-@xmath3 interactions on the gutzwiller level is indeed a many - body screening process . including the many - body screening effects in a self - consistent way is critical for a predictive first principles theory .",
    "such calculations can also provide useful insights on how to determine accurate screened interaction parameters .",
    "the electron hamiltonian for @xmath0-phase ce is written as@xmath9 where the bare paramagnetic band hamiltonian  is@xmath10 @xmath11 is the electron hopping element between orbital @xmath12 at site @xmath13 and orbital @xmath14 at site @xmath15 .",

    "the gutzwiller local subspace in this model includes @xmath3 and @xmath1-orbitals .",

    "@xmath27 is the uncorrelated wave function and @xmath28 is the gutzwiller projection operator .",
    "the gutzwiller approximation renormalizes the expectation values of one - particle operators .",
    "the renormalization factors have analytic expressions , however , they are usually quite complicated .",
    "these expressions can be simplified by introducing a set of rotated orbitals @xmath29 in the gutzwiller local subspace following ref.@xcite , such that the local single particle density matrix is diagonalized , i.e.,@xmath30@xmath31 here we define @xmath32 for a general operator @xmath33 .",

    "such contributions are commonly referred to as the double counting term which should be subtracted in the expression for the total energy .",

    "minimization of the total energy @xmath69 with respect to the band wave function @xmath70 and the local configuration occupation probability @xmath58 under the set of constraints given by eq.[c1 ] and eq.[c2 ] yields the following set of equations which need to be solved self - consistently , @xmath71@xmath72 where@xmath73 and @xmath74 the effective single - particle hamiltonian eq.[h1.1 ] has been shown to describe the landau - gutzwiller quasiparticle bands@xcite , and the square of the @xmath75-factor corresponds to the quasiparticle weight@xcite .",

    "fig.[bd ] shows that up to 2ev above fermi level the tight binding band structure agrees very well with the lda result from vasp@xcite calculations .",
    "the orbital projected weight for each band has also been plotted , confirming that @xmath3-contributions are dominant near the fermi level . the total number of @xmath3 electrons is found to be 0.93 , which is fairly close to one .",
    "[ ptb ]    bd4.eps    in order to single out the many - body screening effects of the @xmath1-channels , we first study the system with @xmath63 treated at the hartree - fock mean - field level .",
    "the double counting term in eq.[dc ] represents the hartree - fock mean field interactions between the @xmath3 and @xmath1-electrons contained in @xmath61 , therefore , it exactly cancels the contribution from the @xmath63  at the hartree - fock level and the whole electron hamiltonian of the system reduces to the usual form with many - body coulomb interactions only between the @xmath3-electrons ( i.e. , @xmath62 ) .",
    "proceeding with the gutzwiller solution of @xmath62 , we include in our calculations @xmath3-shell occupations of @xmath90 , @xmath91 and @xmath92 , resulting in 106 local @xmath7-configurations .",
    "fig.[znf ] shows the variation of orbital renormalization factors and orbital occupations with increasing coulomb repulsion parameter @xmath2 . due to cubic symmetry of @xmath0-ce ,",
    "the @xmath3-orbitals split into three groups with degeneracy of 3 , 3 , and 1 .",
    "it can be seen that all the @xmath75-factors initially decrease with increasing @xmath2 .",
    "a transition occurs near @xmath93 , beyond which the @xmath75-factors of the two sets of 3-fold degenerate @xmath3-orbitals increase sharply while the @xmath75-factor of the singly degenerate @xmath3-orbital decreases rapidly .",
    "meanwhile , the orbital occupations exhibit similar variations near @xmath93 .",
    "the occupations of the triply degenerate orbital groups vanish swiftly as @xmath2 exceeds @xmath94 , while the singly degenerate orbital quickly approaches half - filling .",
    "these results support the physical picture of orbital - selective mott transition@xcite in which the @xmath7-electron in the system is redistributed among the @xmath3-orbitals such that the singly degenerate @xmath3-orbital approaches mott localization with a half - filled band , while the remaining @xmath3-orbitals become empty due to strong @xmath7-electron correlation effect .",
    "however , it has also been shown that a finite hybridization between the narrow correlated @xmath7-bands and the wide conduction bands ( mainly 5d bands in this system ) can suppress the mott transition by kondo screening@xcite .",
    "the screened @xmath4 for @xmath0-ce has been calculated using constrained - lda method and yields a value of @xmath94 which interestingly coincides with @xmath95@xcite .",
    "therefore we choose the transition point in the @xmath75-@xmath8 curve as a fingerprint to identify the correct input @xmath2  parameter for @xmath0-ce in the following calculations of different levels .",
    "we should emphasize that lda itself can not capture the many - body kondo screening effect .",
    "the constrained - lda method gives reasonable estimation of the screened @xmath4 due to other processes , e.g. , dielectric screening .",
    "[ ptb ]    zn-f.eps    we now study the effect of the many - body screening when the @xmath1-electron screening is explicitly included by treating the @xmath63 and @xmath62  on equal footings with gutzwiller variational wave functions constructed on the gutzwiller local subspace consisting of both @xmath3 and @xmath1-orbitals .",
    "any deviation of the calculation results from the mean field calculation described above will reflect the effect of many - body correlation effects arising from including @xmath1-electrons in the gutzwiller projector .",
    "since we do not expect any significant correlation effect for @xmath1-orbitals , we include all the local @xmath1-configurations into account , which pushes the dimension of the local subspace to 108544 . by taking advantage of sparse matrix techniques , a typical self - consistent calculation",
    "can still be done quite fast on a single processor .",
    "a set of coulomb parameter @xmath25  values of \\{1ev , 3ev , 5ev } are chosen with the successive inclusion of different number of many - body screening @xmath1-channels to investigate the details of the many - body screening process .",
    "our calculation results are shown in fig.[zfd ] for the orbital renormalization factors @xmath96 and in fig.[nfd ] for the orbital occupations @xmath97 .",
    "one can see that the curves shift towards larger values of @xmath2 in a nonlinear fashion with increasing coulomb parameter @xmath25 and increasing number of many - body @xmath1-screening channels , indicating that the many - body screening is not a linear process .",
    "the correct input @xmath2 parameter for @xmath0-ce in the calculations which corresponds to the transition point of the @xmath75-@xmath8 curve is pushed much closer to the bare coulomb repulsion energy between @xmath3-electrons ( @xmath9823ev based on the neutral atomic @xmath3-orbitals ) with @xmath99 and all the @xmath1-channels participating in many - body screening process .",
    "it should be pointed out that we encounter some numerical problem in searching solutions of the system on the smaller @xmath2 side , however , this numerical difficulty will not affect our conclusion .",
    "[ ptb ]    zfd.eps    [ ptb ]    nfd.eps    to shed some light on the many - body screening mechanism , it is instructive to examine the variations of the local electronic configuration occupation probabilities @xmath100 , which are the new variational degrees of freedom in the gutzwiller treatment .",
    "however , a straightforward analysis of the local electronic configurations can be rather tedious since its dimension is usually very large .",
    "in fig.[pf012 ] we present the sum of the occupation probabilities of the grouped local configurations according to the number of @xmath7-electrons occupied , which is closely related to the @xmath75-factors for the @xmath3-orbitals .",
    "the local configurations with two @xmath7-electrons occupied can survive to larger @xmath2 and the local configurations with one @xmath7-electron occupied will approach a full occupation at higher @xmath2 by increasing @xmath25 .",
    "this tendency is consistent with the behavior of the @xmath75-factors for the @xmath3-electrons .",
    "another way to look at the many - body screening mechanism is to investigate the response of the screening @xmath1-electrons when the many - body screening is turned on .",
    "fig.[zfd ] shows that the @xmath75-factors for @xmath1-orbitals are smaller than one , but are still quite large ( @xmath101 ) .",
    "it implies that the @xmath1-electrons rearrange themselves in the local subspace in a way deviating from hartree - fock mean field solution in order to effectively screen the interactions between the @xmath3-electrons .",

    ", i.e. , having @xmath1-electrons treated in the same gutzwiller level as @xmath3-electrons beyond static hartree - fock mean - field approximation , we observe that the equivalent @xmath2  is pushed towards its bare atomic value in @xmath0-ce .",
    "therefore local many body response in the @xmath1-channels is the dominant contribution in the screening process for @xmath3-electrons in bulk ce .",
    "this justifies our method in using single - site gutzwiller treatment in this system . in some cases where significant screening effect comes from the atomic environment@xcite",
    ", we expect the generalized cluster - gutzwiller treatment in parallel with cluster - dmft would be useful@xcite .",
    "a method for explicitly including many - body screening process into self - consistent calculations based on gutzwiller variational wave function and gutzwiller approximation has been proposed and applied to the tight - binding electronic structure calculation of @xmath0-ce .",
    "the resultant coulomb repulsion parameter between @xmath3-electrons @xmath2  can be much larger than the corresponding screened @xmath2 with moderate value of coulomb repulsion parameter between @xmath3 and @xmath1-electrons @xmath25 .",
    "assuming the dominant many - body screening effect for the strongly correlated orbitals ( e.g. , @xmath3-orbitals for ce ) can be explicitly taken into account in this local approach , it is therefore of great interest to examine how the current scheme performs in full dft - based self - consistent calculations where all the coulomb repulsion energies between various orbitals in the gutzwiller local subspace are directly obtained from atomic orbital integrations .",
    "since the atomic orbitals are generally non - orthogonal , it is also highly worthwhile to extend the scheme from orthogonal orbitals to non - orthogonal orbitals .",
