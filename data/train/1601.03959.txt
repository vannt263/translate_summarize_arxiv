    "observations of transits and eclipses of exoplanets have been used , in the last decade , to characterize the nature of more than 100 of these alien worlds with unprecedented detail .",

    "for the brightest targets , emission spectra have been measured during ( planetary ) eclipses to constrain the atmospheric chemistry , pressure - temperature profile , albedo , and global circulation patterns ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "many datasets were obtained using the infrared array camera ( irac , @xcite ) onboard _ spitzer space telescope_. since depletion of the telescope s cryogen in 2009 , irac continues to operate in the 3.6 and 4.5 @xmath1 m bands , as the `` _ _ spitzer _ _ warm mission '' .",
    "a precision of 0.01@xmath4 is required to study the atmospheres of giant exoplanets through transmission and/or emission spectroscopy @xcite .",

    "it is not always obvious how to decorrelate the data using auxiliary information of the instrument and , in some cases , different methods lead to significantly different results ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the majority of exoplanets transit and eclipse multi - band photometric data adopted in the literature are obtained by combining data at different wavelengths from separate epochs years apart .",
    "repeated observations are necessary to estimate the overall level of variability , due to astrophysical variations and possible uncorrected instrument effects .",
    "if consistent , compared to single observations , repeated observations can provide more accurate parameter values , leading to higher signal - to - noise atmospheric spectra for exoplanets , and potentially allowing the characterization of smaller exoplanets around fainter stars .    the main instrumental effect affecting _",
    "spitzer_/irac data at 3.6 and 4.5 @xmath1 m is due to intra - pixel gain variations and spacecraft - induced motion , so - called pixel - phase effect . the measured flux from the star is correlated with its position on the detector , hence the idea of correcting the data with a polynomial function of the stellar centroid as proposed in the literature @xcite .",
    "multiple reanalyses of the same datasets with the polynomial method show that , in some cases , results can be sensitive to some specific options / variants , such as the degree of the polynomial adopted , partial data rejection , including temporal or other decorrelations ( e.g. @xcite ) . recently",

    "pixel - ica method differs from the other detrending methods proposed in the literature , as it is an unsupervised machine learning algorithm .",
    "the lack of any prior assumptions about the instrument systematics and astrophysical signals ensures a high degree of objectivity , and indicates that the same method could be applied to detrend data taken with different instruments .",
    "pixel - ica method gave coherent results when applied over multiple transit observations of the exoplanets hd189733b and gj436b , for which the previous literature reported discrepant results @xcite , and over simulated observations with a variety of instrumental systematics @xcite .",

    "we list the main steps of the wavelet pixel - ica method , followed by a more accurate description and comments :    1 .   selecting an array of pixels .",
    "the raw light - curve is the sum of the individual pixel time series within the selected array .",
    "2 .   removing outliers .",
    "3 .   subtracting the background from the raw light - curve .",
    "4 .   computing the wavelet transforms of the time series from the pixels within the selected array , hereafter called pixel - light - curves .",
    "5 .   performing ica decomposition of the wavelet - transformed pixel - light - curves .",
    "6 .   computing the inverse wavelet transforms of the independent components .",
    "simultaneous fitting of the components ( except the eclipse one ) and astrophysical model on the raw light - curve",
    "estimating parameter error bars .",
    "we use squared arrays of pixels as photometric apertures ; in this paper , we tested 5@xmath605 and 7@xmath607 arrays with the stellar centroid at their centers . by default ,",
    "all pixel - light - curves within the selected array are also used to decorrelate the instrument systematics through ica .",
    "our previous analyses of transit observations indicated the 5@xmath605 and 7@xmath607 arrays to be optimal choices , and , in general , results were very little affected by the choice of different arrays @xcite .",
    "we flag and correct outliers in the flux time series .",
    "first , we calculate the standard deviations of any set of five consecutive points and take the median value as the representative standard deviation .",
    "we define the expected value in one point as the median of the four closest points , i.e. two before and two after .",
    "points differing from their expected values by more than five times the standard deviation are flagged as outliers .",
    "they are then replaced with the mean value of the points immediately before and after , or , in case of two consecutive outliers , with a linear interpolation between the closest points which are not outliers .",
    "we checked that the outliers removed after this process are coincident with outliers that would have been spotted by eye .",
    "they are less than 0.35@xmath4 the number of points in each observation .",
    "the background is estimated by taking the mean flux over four arrays of pixels with the same size of the selected array ( 5@xmath605 or 7@xmath607 ) near the corners of the sub - array area . in appendix [ app_back ]",
    "we discuss how this preliminary step improves the results . here",
    "we anticipate that the impact on individual measurements of the eclipse depth is at the level of @xmath1710@xmath61 , well below the error bars",
    ". however , this difference might become significant when averaging results from multiple observations , and the error bars are reduced .",
    "the main novelty of the algorithm proposed in this paper is that the pixel - light - curves are wavelet - transformed before performing the ica separation .",
    "more specifically , we adopt one - level dwt with mother wavelet daubechies-4 @xcite .",
    "we found that different choices of the mother wavelet , among different families and numbers , lead to exactly the same results , and higher - level dwts are not useful .",
    "we also investigated the effect of binning the time series ( see appendix [ app_bin ] ) .",
    "it is performed on the wavelet - transformed pixel - light - curves ( see equation [ eqn : waveletica ] ) .",
    "the independent components are transformed in the time domain through inverse dwts ( see equation [ invdwt ] ) .",
    "the raw light - curves are linear combinations of the independent components .",
    "one of the components is the eclipse signal ( with some residual systematics ) , other components may be instrumental systematics and/or other astrophysical signals . instead of fitting an eclipse model to the eclipse component ,",
    "more robust estimates of the eclipse parameters are obtained by fitting a linear combination of the eclipse model and the non - eclipse components , hereafter full models , to the raw light - curves .",
    "the free parameters of the eclipse model are fitted together with the scaling coefficients of the independent components .",
    "first estimates of the parameters and scaling coefficients are obtained through a nelder - mead optimization algorithm @xcite ; they are then used as optimal starting points for an adaptive metropolis algorithm with delayed rejection @xcite , generating chains of 300,000 values .",
    "the output chains are samples of the posterior ( gaussian ) distributions .",
    "we adopt the mean values of the chains as final best estimates of the parameters , and the standard deviations as zero - order error bars , @xmath62 .",
    "the final parameter error bars are : @xmath63 @xmath64 is the sampled likelihood variance , approximately equal to the variance of the residuals for the best transit model ; @xmath65 is a term accounting for the potential bias of the components obtained with ica .",

    "the dwt of a time series is specified by the choice of a mother wavelet and the number of levels ( see section [ dwt ] ) .",
    "we adopted a daubechies-4 mother wavelet , and one - level decomposition .",
    "for a few observations we tested multiple choices of the mother wavelet , among the daubechies , biorthogonal , symlets and coiflets families , and number of decomposition levels .",
    "we refer to @xcite for details about the wavelet properties .",
    "we found that different choices of the mother wavelet are not significant , e.g. discrepancies in the eclipse signals are 1 - 2 orders of magnitudes smaller than the fitting residuals , while level decompositions higher than 1 usually appear to make impossible for ica to retrieve the eclipse .",
    "the difficulties with higher - level dwts may arise from sub - sampling the average coefficients , and the fact that some of the low - frequency non - gaussian components may be smeared over higher levels of detail coefficients .",
    "uncorrected background may bias the normalized amplitude of the eclipse depth , as well as the phase curve s slope , if background is not constant over time .",
    "the typical morphology of a background time series is either a constant function or a slow monotonic drift .",
    "the lack of a distinct temporal structure and non - gaussianity makes it difficult to disentangle with ica , as well as other statistical methods . for this reason",
    ", we performed ad hoc background subtractions before ica detrending ( see section [ back ] ) .",
    "in this section , we discuss the impact of this step in the analyses , by comparing results obtained with and without background subtraction .",
    "these are also used to infer the maximum parameter errors that can be caused by an inappropriate background correction .",
    "figure [ fig7 ] shows an example of background time series estimated for one observation .",
    "the measured mean background level slightly varies from one observation to the other , but it is always less than 0.6@xmath4 of the total flux from the system , hence potentially affecting the eclipse depth by less than 10@xmath61 , well below the error bars .",
    "background is also not constant during one observation : it has a small ramp for the first @xmath1720 minutes ( except for the eclipses extracted from longer observations ) , then continues to slowly increase .",
    "figure [ fig8 ] shows the parameter results obtained with and without background subtraction .",
    "the greatest discrepancies are observed for the phase constant , which is systematically higher by 2 - 20@xmath6010@xmath15 days@xmath16 for the cases without background subtraction , suggesting the presence of uncorrected systematics .",
    "it is quite remarkable that our individual error bars automatically account for those systematics , but , given their non - random nature , the weighted mean error bars for the phase constant can not be compared .",
    "it is difficult to prove the superiority of the results obtained with background subtraction over the others , as the residuals between the full models and the relevant raw light - curves ( see section [ mcmc ] ) are very similar for the two cases , e.g. similar amplitudes and time correlations , leading to similar error bars .",
    "slightly smaller parameter dispersions are obtained with background subtraction rather than without , in particular 7@xmath6010@xmath61 vs 9@xmath6010@xmath61 for the eclipse depth , and 7@xmath6010@xmath15 vs 8@xmath6010@xmath15 days@xmath16 for the phase constant .",
    "the higher mean value of the phase constant obtained without background subtraction , i.e. @xmath1713@xmath6010@xmath15 days@xmath16 , appears to be less likely , as it would require a higher than expected increase in the atmospheric temperature due to stellar irradiation during the eclipse , and/or strong horizontal disomogeneities either in temperature , chemical composition and/or clouds @xcite .",
    "if we assume that systematics are removed with background subtraction , we can take the weigthed mean as best estimate for the phase constant .",
    "the discrepancies between eclipse depth measurements with and without background subtraction are in the range 10@xmath61 - 10@xmath15 , and , in average , the eclipse depth is smaller by @xmath174@xmath6010@xmath61 for the case without background subtraction . although this is more than the 10@xmath61 difference expected from the mean background level relative to the mean stellar flux ( see discussion in the previous paragraph ) , in this case , the two weighted means are consistent within 0.5 @xmath2 .",
    "we found that the main effect of background on the eclipse depth is due to correlations between the measured eclipse depth at the eclipse center and the phase constant , in terms of pearson correlation coefficients between the relevant mcmcs .",
    "the details of this study are beyond the scope of this paper .      in previous studies , we found that , for high - s / n transit observations , pixel - ica performances are only slightly dependent on the choice of the array @xcite .",
    "the 3@xmath603 array is too narrow compared to the spitzer / irac point spread function , and for this reason , it is not photometrically stable ( although it usually leads to consistent results ) .",
    "larger arrays are more photometrically stable , but they include more noise . also , noisier pixel - light - curves , appear to increase the uncertainties in the ica decomposition ( @xmath85 , see section [ error_bars ] ) , so that the smallest error bars were usually obtained using the 5@xmath605 array .    in this work",
    ", we analyzed all datasets with two different choices of the pixel - array , i.e. 5@xmath605 and 7@xmath607 .",
    "for the analyses with the 7@xmath607 array , we only adopted the 64 frames bin size , for which the mcmc fitting is faster .",
    "figure [ fig9 ] compares the results obtained with the two different arrays and the same bin size .",
    "the two sets of results are consistent well within 1 @xmath2 , but error bars obtained with the 7@xmath607 array are 1 - 1.5 times larger than the ones obtained with the 5@xmath605 array , despite the residuals in the fits are similar and often smaller for the 7@xmath607 cases .",
    "this confirms the conclusions obtained from previous analyses , in particular :        figure [ fig10 ] compares the results obtained with and without background subtraction for the case of 7@xmath607 array .",
    "the same considerations discussed in appendix [ app_back ] for the 5@xmath605 array are valid for the 7@xmath607 array .      at the end of appendix [ app_back ] we revealed the existence of a correlation between the eclipse depth and phase constant parameter , which is stronger for data with a higher slope , such as the cases without background subtraction",
    ". this may affect the eclipse depth estimate in case of residual systematics with a slope , e.g. uncorrected background . in our analyses ,",
    "the maximum bias on the eclipse depth due to correlations with this kind of systematics is @xmath174@xmath6010@xmath61 , provided the systematic slope is not larger than our individual error bars .",
    "here we test the consequences of adopting zero phase constant while fitting for the eclipse depth .",
    "this is equivalent to the assumption that the phase curve is flat before and after the eclipse , and the slope is entirely due to instrumental effects .",
    "compared to the cases with the phase constant as free parameter , fitting residuals with zero phase constant are not significantly larger .",
    "figure [ fig11 ] compares results for the eclipse depth with free and zero phase constant , with and without background subtraction .",
    "the weighted mean results are reported in figure [ fig12 ] .",
    "we note that differences in eclipse depth measurements with and without background subtraction are smaller for the zero phase constant models , suggesting that eclipse depth measured with zero phase constant models are less affected by residual systematics with a slope .",
    "free phase constant models are valid in a more general context , as , differently from the zero phase constant models , they approximate planet s flux variability during the observation .",
    "the consistency between the results obtained with the two classes of models indicates that , in this case , planet s flux variability in the proximity of the eclipse is smaller than the error bars .",
    "figure [ fig12 ] reports the weighted mean eclipse depth estimated for all the tests discussed in the appendices .",
    "note that they are mutually consistent at the 0.5 @xmath2 level , and the range is 6@xmath6010@xmath61 .",
