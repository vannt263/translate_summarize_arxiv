    "half - metallic ferrimagnetic compounds show advantages as compared to the more common half - metallic ferromagnets . due to their internal spin compensation",
    "they have a lower magnetization and thus do not generate high stray fields , while still having high curie - temperatures.@xcite    recently , the class of mn@xmath0v@xmath12 heusler compounds has been the subject of several theoretical studies.@xcite _ ab initio _",
    "calculations performed for compounds with @xmath12 = al , ga , in , si , ge , and sn by zdogan _ _ et al.__@xcite predicted a nearly half - metallic electronic structure with a pseudo band gap for the majority carriers and a ferrimagnetic ground state for most of these compounds .",

    "in contrast to the well - known co@xmath0-based heusler compounds with a minority gap , the majority gap results in a negative spin polarization , and thus negative tunnel magnetoresistance ( tmr ) in magnetic tunnel junctions ( mtjs ) around zero bias is expected .",

    "laue - oscillations at the @xmath43 peaks are visible in the xrd patterns , displaying the good crystallization .",
    "the reflectivities indicate that the @xmath4c sample possesses a higher roughness of about @xmath45 , while the films deposited at @xmath2c and @xmath3c are very smooth with roughnesses of only @xmath46 .",
    "lattice parameters perpendicular to the surface decrease with increasing deposition temperature .",
    "the @xmath2c film has the highest value of about @xmath47 , which is a little larger than the bulk value .",
    "the lattice parameters @xmath48 and @xmath49 in the @xmath3c and the @xmath4c samples , respectively , are significantly lower .",
    "this trend in lattice distortion is due to an increasing lattice matching between the mgo(001 ) substrate and the films with increasing temperature .",
    "the lattice thus is expanded in the film plane and compressed in the direction perpendicular to the plane .",
    "the deposition temperature 450@xmath50c was chosen for the mtjs since these films had sufficiently small roughness , allowing to grow tunnel barriers free of pinholes .",
    "the order parameters were determined with the method presented by takamura _ _ et al.__@xcite we found a mostly b2 ordered structure in the films with only a small degree of l2@xmath42 ordering . with increasing deposition temperature the order parameters increased .",
    "especially , an increase in l2@xmath42 ordering at higher deposition temperatures occured .",
    "the order parameters , which have been obtained including anomalous scattering contributions are displayed in figure [ fig : xrd_xrr ] .",
    "due to the similar atomic form factors of mn and v , the parameter @xmath51 measures essentially the number of ga atoms on the mn sites .",
    "with @xmath52 we find that about 10% of the mn sites are occupied with ga atoms .",
    "assuming that the a , b , and c sites are ideally occupied and the excess mn and v of our samples reside on ga sites , we have @xmath53 .",

    "c. ]    the extrapolated low - temperature magnetic moment of the films deposited at 450@xmath50c was @xmath56/f.u .. at room temperature , this value is reduced to @xmath57/f.u . ,",

    "[ fig : xmcd ] we show exemplarily the l@xmath58 xmcd spectra of a sample deposited at 550@xmath50c .",
    "the spectra of the other samples are very similar .",
    "the antiparallel alignment of the mn and v magnetic moments is immediately clear .",
    "unfortunately , we can not quantify the magnetic moment of v. on the one hand , this is because we can not determine the experimental background function , due to the k absorption edge of o at 543ev . on the other hand ,",
    "jj mixing prevents us from applying the sum rules in the usual way . to compensate for the latter in the case of mn , we multiply the apparent spin moment with 1.5.@xcite for the 550@xmath50c sample we find @xmath59 per atom at room temperature , where the error arises mainly from uncertanties in the background subtraction .",
    "this value extrapolates to @xmath60 per atom at low temperature , which is consistent with the calculated magnetic moment ( see next section ) .",
    "neutron diffraction performed by itoh _ et al .",
    "_ on the isostructural and isoelectronic compound mn@xmath0val revealed a ferrimagnetic coupling of mn and v with total moments of @xmath61 and @xmath62 at room temperature.@xcite these data are consistent with a total magnetic moment of 2@xmath63/f.u .",
    "for the ideally ordered compound , and they are consistent with our measurements on mn@xmath0vga , which should have similar magnetic moments .",
    "we note that the xmcd spectra shown here are very similar to those of mn@xmath0val.@xcite      in our spr - kkr calculation with the ideally ordered l2@xmath42 structure , mn@xmath0vga has a total moment of 1.94@xmath63/f.u . , with 1.37@xmath63 on mn and -0.76@xmath63 on v. in the flapw calculation , the total magnetic moment is 1.98@xmath63/f.u . , with 1.47@xmath63 on mn and -0.91@xmath63 on v. due to the limited accuracy with respect to the angular momentum cutoff in the spr - kkr calculation , we consider the flapw result to be more accurate .",
    "furthermore , these values match the experimental values of the magnetic moments of mn@xmath0val,@xcite for which we find very similar magnetic moments as for mn@xmath0vga .",
    "similar results were also obtained for the mn@xmath0ti__z _ _",
    "compounds.@xcite    however , chemical disorder is more accurately treated in the kkr method , as supercells have to be considered in the flapw scheme .",
    "thus , we treat the chemical disorder within the kkr method , noting that the magnetic moments are eventually somewhat underestimated . in both calculations ,",
    "the band structure is not fully half - metallic , but a pseudogap for the majority spin is present at the fermi energy .    the b2 ordered case exhibits a similar pseudogap as the l2@xmath42 ordered compound . here",
    ", the total moment is 1.93@xmath63/f.u . , with 1.42@xmath63 on mn and -0.87@xmath63 on v. the total magnetic moment does not depend on the degree of v - ga intermixing , i.e. , it is independent from @xmath64 .",
    "however , we find a significant influence of disorder involving mn .",
    "an l2@xmath42 structure with 5% mn and 3% v antisites on the ga sites mimics the experimental stoichiometry .",
    "the calculated total magnetic moment of this configuration is 1.71@xmath63/f.u . , where the individual magnetic moments correspond to those of the ideal l2@xmath42 structure .",
    "the mn and v antisites have -2.37@xmath63 and -0.88@xmath63 , respectively .",
    "the calculated total moment agrees with the slater - pauling value of 1.74@xmath63/f.u . for this stoichiometry",
    "nevertheless , both values are larger than the experimental magnetic moment , which hints to additional mn disorder being present in the samples , as was already suggested by the xrd measurements .    with an additional 4% intermixing of mn and ga , considering the mn antisite moments",
    "as calculated above , we get @xmath65 and @xmath66@xmath63/f.u .",
    ", which agree with the experimental data .",
    "the total mn occupation of ga sites is 9% within this model .",
    "a small amount of additional mn - v disorder would not influence the total magnetic moment : the v antisites would couple parallel to the mn atoms on the ( a , c ) sites and partially compensate the large negative moment of the mn antisites . assuming the moments to be independent from the degree of disorder , mn - ga swaps contribute about @xmath67 per atom , while mn - v swaps give only about @xmath68 per atom .",
    "however , with mn - v swaps the mn ( a , c ) moments increase slightly in addition , so that in total the moment remains nearly constant .",
    "this type of disorder can not be detected by xrd , so mn - v disorder remains unknown .",
    "these considerations establish the following internally consistent structural model for our films .",
    "the ordering is essentially of the b2 type , with some preferential ordering of the v and ga atoms towards the l2@xmath42 structure .",
    "in addition , the ( v , ga ) sites have a 4.5% occupation of mn atoms due to excess of mn atoms and chemical disorder involving ga . the mn antisites couple antiparallel to the mn atoms on the ( a , c ) sites and reduce the total magnetic moment .      to investigate the transport properties of the magnetic tunnel junctions , major loops and @xmath69 curves were recorded .",
    "the tmr(@xmath6 ) characteristics were determined from the @xmath69 curves for parallel and antiparallel magnetization .",
    "we carried out measurements on the samples without and after successive post - annealing treatments , starting at 100@xmath50c and up to 425@xmath50c in steps of 25@xmath50c each for 30min .",

    "the highest tmr was obtained at a bias voltage of -100mv after annealing at 150@xmath50c , where positive bias means tunneling of electrons into the heusler compound .",
    "major loops ( figure [ fig : tmr ] ) yield a tmr ratio of 8.3@xmath71 for these parameters .",
    "however , the field of @xmath72 is not high enough to saturate the mn@xmath0vga completely , see figure [ fig : moke ] .",
    "futhermore , the low squareness of the mn@xmath0vga hysteresis reduces the tmr by at least a factor of 2 .     at @xmath73 after annealing at 150@xmath50c .",
    "right : negative tunnel magnetoresistance of @xmath74 at 50mv after annealing at 400@xmath50c . ]",
    "the 150@xmath50c curve also shows a shoulder at high positive bias voltages between @xmath75 and @xmath76 . with increasing temperature",
    "the shape of this shoulder develops to a peak while the maximum around @xmath73 is reduced significantly and a minimum around + 100mv emerges .",
    "as of t@xmath77c , the tunnel magnetoresistance drops below zero for low positive bias voltages . for higher post - annealing temperatures ,",
    "the tmr around low bias is significantly negative .",
    "this is an indication for the inverted spin polarization and the pseudogap in the majority channel .",
    "the highest negative tmr of was reached for t@xmath78c at v@xmath79mv ( figure [ fig : tmr ] ) .    to provide an explanation for the bias voltage dependence of the tmr",

    "the co@xmath38fe@xmath39 compound was modeled in the chemically disordered bcc ( a2 ) phase .",
    "its total moment is 2@xmath63/f.u . , with 1.76@xmath63 on co and 2.58@xmath63 on fe .",
    "as before , the density of states is dominated by _",
    "d _ states around @xmath92 .",
    "the _ d _ character and total dos have negative spin polarization at @xmath92 , while the _ s _ states show a positive spin polarization .",
    "since our samples were primarily b2 ordered , we calculated the tmr(@xmath6 ) curves for this case .",
    "a comparison between the theoretical and the experimental bias voltage dependent tmr is shown in figure [ fig : tmrvsu ] . the main contribution to",
    "the tunneling current comes from the light electrons of _ s _ character.@xcite thus , we consider only the _ _ s__dos in eq . [ tunnelstrom ] . with this model",
    "we find good qualitative agreement between experiment ( for junctions with high post - annealing temperature ) and theory : a negative tmr region around zero bias , a flat tmr(@xmath6 ) at negative , and a peaked tmr(v ) at positive bias , respectively . however , the voltage scale is narrower in the experiment .    on the origin of the annealing temperature dependence of the tmr(@xmath6 ) curves we can only speculate .",
    "removal of interfacial disorder or reduction of oxidized transition metal atoms would provide explanations for such behaviour .",
    "interfacial disorder could introduce states in the pseudogap , which would contribute to a positive tmr around zero bias .",
    "oxidized transition metal atoms could allow coupling of _ d _ electron states across the barrier ( eventually as resonant defect states).@xcite crystallization of the mgo barrier is usually expected to give rise to coherent tunneling and a strong enhancement of the tmr.@xcite in this case , only bloch states with momentum parallel to the interface normal ( here the @xmath93 direction ) contribute to the tunneling current .",
    "however , this is inconsistent with our observation that the tmr(@xmath6 ) characteristic is well explained with dos obtained from integrating over the entire brillouin zone .",
    "the magnitude of the negative tmr of the @xmath94c sample is much smaller than the theoretical value of @xmath95 . on the one hand , this is due to the low squareness of the magnetic hysteresis . on the other hand",
    ", the theoretical value corresponds to a low - temperature experiment , while our measurements were taken at room temperature .",
    "bulk disorder may in general induce states in the half - metallic gap.@xcite we find that mn antisites on ga positions and vice versa contribute weakly to the pseudogap , but their polarization is negative for the _ s _ states and in total .",
    "however , v antisites on mn positions generate states in the pseudogap by hybridization , diminishing the negative polarization .",
    "thus , the tmr(@xmath6 ) dependence on the annealing temperature may also arise from removal of ( interfacial ) mn - v disorder .",
    "inelastic tunneling contributions , such as magnon excitations or kondo scattering , may also decrease the tmr .",
    "furthermore , the interfacial spin polarization may be significantly different from the bulk polarization.@xcite    it is well known that the tunneling spin polarization of the cofe / mgo interface is positive.@xcite in conclusion , a negative spin polarization at the mn@xmath0vga / mgo interface must be present in order to explain the observed negative tmr .",
    "the observed tmr(@xmath6 ) characteristic is a definitive fingerprint of the majority spin pseudogap predicted by dft calculations .",
    "epitaxial mn@xmath0vga thin films were synthesized on mgo(001 ) substrates by uhv dc and rf magnetron co - sputtering .",

    "the order parameters are consistent with the magnetization , which is confirmed by _",
    "ab initio _ electronic structure calculations .",
    "a series of successive post - annealing steps with tmr measurements on mtjs reveals a strong dependency of the tmr(@xmath6 ) characteristics on the annealing temperature for this compound . for high annealing temperatures",
    ", we found negative tmr of up to @xmath74 around low bias at room temperature .",
    "this can be assigned to the unusual band structure and reflects the inverse spin polarization with a pseudogap in the spin majority channel .",

    "<S> the ferrimagnetic heusler compound mn@xmath0vga is predicted to have a pseudogap in the majority spin channel , which should lead to a negative tunnel magnetoresistance . </S>",
    "<S> we synthesized epitaxial mn@xmath0vga thin films on mgo@xmath1 substrates by dc and rf magnetron co - sputtering , resulting in nearly stoichiometric films . </S>",
    "<S> xrd analysis revealed a mostly b2-ordered structure for the films deposited at substrate temperatures of @xmath2c , @xmath3c , and @xmath4c . </S>",
    "<S> magnetic tunnel junctions with mgo barrier and cofe counter - electrodes were fabricated . </S>",
    "<S> after post - annealing at up to t@xmath5c negative tmr was obtained around zero bias , providing evidence for the inverted spin - polarization . </S>",
    "<S> band structures of both electrodes were computed within the coherent potential approximation and used to calculate the tmr(@xmath6 ) characteristics , which are in good agreement with our experimental findings . </S>"
