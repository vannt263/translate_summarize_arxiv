    "indistinguishable photons are naturally produced during the spontaneous decay of atoms and ions  @xcite .",
    "solid - state atom - like systems can also emit indistinguishable photons , with examples including quantum dots  @xcite , molecules  @xcite and semiconductor impurities @xcite ; diamond nitrogen - vacancy ( nv ) centers also appear promising  @xcite .",
    "solid - state systems are especially interesting for large - scale photonic networks incorporating many devices",
    ". the temporal length of the emitted photons can be short due to the large dipole moment and correspondingly short spontaneous emission lifetime ( @xmath1 ) , and the lifetime can be further shortened using integrated small mode volume optical cavities .",
    "the main drawback of solid - state systems is that they can suffer from severe dephasing of the optical transitions caused by phonons  @xcite , random charge fluctuations  @xcite or other mechanisms  @xcite .",
    "one way to reduce the detrimental effect of dephasing on photon indistinguishability in two - level systems is to push towards shorter - lived transitions .",
    "this approach reaches its limit when the photon lifetime becomes comparable to the time jitter that characterizes incoherently pumped transitions .",
    "this then necessitates true resonant excitation , which has recently been demonstrated  @xcite but limits experiments to cavity geometries that minimize pump laser scattering .",
    "alternatively , one can move to three - level systems that can be coherently excited at a frequency different from that of the photon emission .",
    "three - level @xmath0-type systems also potentially provide an interface between long - lived matter qubits and `` flying '' photonic qubits .",
    "schemes based on raman transitions in three - level systems were proposed more than a decade ago for deterministic communication in quantum networks  @xcite , and for probabilistic entanglement generation  @xcite and teleportation  @xcite .",
    "some more recent papers have investigated the theoretical aspects of single - photon generation in three - level systems in greater detail , including the problem of generation and trapping of photons with arbitrary waveforms  @xcite , and the problem of how best to generate indistinguishable photons from non - identical systems  @xcite .",
    "experimentally , three - level schemes have now been used for single - photon generation in atoms  @xcite , and in trapped ions  @xcite it was shown that photons with arbitrary waveforms could be generated .",
    "such experiments have not yet been performed in solid - state systems , but following a recent demonstration of tunable , spontaneous raman fluorescence from a single quantum dot  @xcite the outlook is promising .    for solid - state implementations of the raman scheme , a critical question is how the photon indistinguishability is affected by excited - state dephasing . ref .",
    "@xcite investigated this question but only for the special case of zero detuning , and furthermore the model , based on optical bloch equations , did not allow for finite correlation timescales in the dephasing process .",
    "the results suggested that the three - level scheme is helpful for solving the time - jitter problem , but little or no improvement with respect to excited - state dephasing was indicated .",
    "one might expect that for a large detuning , single photons generated in a raman process will be far less sensitive to excited - state energy fluctuations . in this paper , we analyze theoretically the dependence of photon indistinguishability on both the detuning and the correlation timescale of the dephasing process affecting the excited state . we find that for a large detuning , the effects of excited - state dephasing can be reduced by orders of magnitude beyond the usual reduction that occurs due to shortened photon lifetime in a two - level system , but only if the memory timescale of the noise process is short compared with the photon emission lifetime .",

    "we include spontaneous decay only from state @xmath4 to state @xmath3 , so that the system can not be re - excited after emitting a photon .",

    "the achievable improvement will be limited by additional excited states which , although they may be further detuned , will make a substantial contribution to the system dynamics when the excitation field is too strong . the other way to improve",
    "the @xmath151 ratio is through selective cavity enhancement of the @xmath6 transition .",
    "this requires either a cavity linewidth that is narrow compared with the @xmath152 energy spacing or else good polarization selection rules .",
    "let us now discuss how the above results may apply to actual solid - state atom - like systems that have two or more ground - state spin sublevels connected by _",
    "strong _ optical transitions to a common excited state .",
    "various types of optical control have been demonstrated in semiconductor quantum dots  @xcite , shallow donors  @xcite , and diamond nv centers  @xcite .",
    "the benefit provided by a large detuning will first of all depend on the fluctuation rate of the noise source affecting the excited state . for spectral - diffusion processes with long correlation timescales",
    "we expect little improvement compared with a two - level scheme for useful photon emission rates , but a large improvement may be possible for noise processes that have sub - nanosecond correlation timescales .",
    "first , let us consider a charged quantum dot subject to a strong magnetic field that is not aligned to the growth axis , so that two long - lived electron spin ground states are coupled to an excited ( trion ) state by optical transitions .",
    "suppose this quantum dot is placed in a state - of - the - art photonic - crystal microcavity  @xcite with cavity - qed parameters @xmath153 and @xmath154 . because spontaneous emission into leaky modes in 2d photonic crystals is suppressed by a factor of @xmath155",
    "@xcite we set @xmath156 .",
    "suppose now that the excited state is subject to a phonon dephasing process which we shall approximate using the above dephasing model with @xmath157 , with fluctuation rate @xmath158 ( corresponding to @xmath159 at @xmath160 ) .",
    "if the system is excited on resonance with a short pulse , the best - case indistinguishability degradation due to excited - state dephasing is @xmath161 with a photon temporal width ( fwhm ) of @xmath162 ( the decay is non - exponential since the system is near the onset of strong coupling ) . for non - resonant excitation ,",
    "possibly the only option with photonic crystal cavities due to pump laser scatter , the indistinguishability will be much worse due to the time jitter associated with the finite relaxation time to the upper level of the optical transition .",
    "suppose now that we instead use a raman scheme with @xmath163 and @xmath164 , and send the collected light through a fabry - perot cavity with a transmission bandwidth of @xmath165 .",
    "the simulated filter efficiency is @xmath166 , and the total photon collection efficiency is @xmath167 .",
    "the theoretical indistinguishability degradation in the raman scheme , considering excited - state dephasing alone , is @xmath168 while the lifetime for the raman transition is @xmath169 , still quite fast for many applications .",
    "to predict the total degradation we must also consider the processes in eqs .",
    "[ eq : ground_dephasing],[eq : pump_scattering ] . in negatively charged inas quantum dots",
    "@xmath170 is limited to @xmath171 due to hyperfine coupling between the electronic and nuclear spins .",
    "however , a recent experiment with positively charged quantum dots  @xcite suggests that @xmath172 values of hundreds of nanoseconds or more may be achievable .",
    "if we take @xmath173 to be @xmath174 , for @xmath175 one could hope for @xmath176 , which approximately matches the degradation predicted above for excited - state dephasing .",
    "if @xmath177 the situation is better since the dephasing will follow a gaussian time dependence , and in the first @xmath169 may be negligible ( this is reflected in the @xmath178 dependence in eq .",
    "[ eq : ground_dephasing ] for @xmath179 ) .",
    "the main limiting factor is likely to be spontaneous emission back to @xmath2 .",
    "if we have a perfectly balanced @xmath0 system , the degradation is given approximately by the inverse purcell factor @xmath180 giving @xmath181 .",
    "it is tempting to try to reduce @xmath148 by moving to an imbalanced @xmath0 system using a magnetic field that is nearly aligned to the growth axis , or by using a very large magnetic field .",
    "however there are in fact two excited ( trion ) states , and if @xmath148 decreases for one of them , it will increase for the other .",
    "furthermore , at practical magnetic field strengths the energy separation between the two trion states can not be made much larger than the value of @xmath71 used in this example .",
    "thus , @xmath182 is probably close to the best possible performance .",
    "nevertheless , we note several improvements in the raman scheme compared with the two - level scheme .",
    "first , the overall indistinguishability is substantially improved , especially if we consider realistic excitation schemes in the two - level case .",
    "additionally , the raman scheme can tolerate much more high - frequency excited - state dephasing than was included here .",
    "finally , the raman scheme includes a long - lived matter qubit coupled to a single - photon emitter as needed for quantum networking applications .",
    "in this example we assumed that the ground - state splitting could be made large compared with the cavity linewidth @xmath12 .",
    "if this can not be achieved in a photonic - crystal cavity using practical magnetic field strengths , then it may be advantageous instead to use microdisk cavities , which tend to have higher quality factors , can also reach a strong coupling regime , and can be coupled efficiently to a tapered optical fiber  @xcite .",
    "next , let us briefly discuss the case of diamond nv centers .",
    "this system seems attractive for quantum computation since in isotopically purified diamond the spin coherence lifetime ( as measured in a spin - echo experiment ) can reach several milliseconds , and @xmath173 ( without spin echo ) can be several microseconds or longer  @xcite .",
    "a @xmath0-type system can be obtained either by using a magnetic field to mix two of the ground states  @xcite or by using strain or an electric field to mix some of the excited states  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , at low temperatures , lifetime - limited spectral linewidths of @xmath183 have been observed in high - purity samples using laser spectroscopy  @xcite .",
    "however , while much recent progress has been made towards the realization of high-@xmath184 , small - mode - volume cavities in diamond  @xcite , it seems unrealistic to expect extremely large factors for total spontaneous emission lifetime modification as have been realized in quantum dots .",
    "apart from technological issues , the main difficulty in this system is that only @xmath185 of the spontaneous emission is into the zero - phonon line , and only this emission can be efficiently coupled to a high-@xmath184 cavity .",
    "this amounts to a factor of @xmath186 penalty in converting the purcell factor into total spontaneous emission lifetime modification .",
    "thus , the best approach to obtain a photon indistinguishability above @xmath187 in a raman scheme is probably to use an imbalanced @xmath0 system to suppress the @xmath13 process .",
    "since the excited - state level splittings near an anticrossing are only @xmath188  @xcite , there is not much room for large detunings .",
    "furthermore , the most problematic excited - state dephasing process in this system seems to be a slow spectral diffusion process related to charge trap fluctuations as was mentioned above . for these reasons , and because the spontaneous emission lifetime ( @xmath189 ) is already rather long , the best performance can probably be obtained by operating the system on resonance .",
    "in summary , we have shown that if photon indistinguishability is limited by excited - state dephasing , it can in some cases be drastically improved using a three - level raman scheme with a large detuning .",
    "the dependence of the photon indistinguishability on the noise fluctuation rate was examined , and it was shown that a large detuning provides an improvement when the noise fluctuation rate is fast compared with the photon emission rate .",
    "to realize this benefit it is usually necessary to use an internal or external spectral filter to remove a weak spontaneous emission component at the natural transition frequency .",
    "we have also considered the practical application of this scheme to solid - state systems such as semiconductor quantum dots and diamond nitrogen - vacancy centers . due to additional mechanisms which degrade the photon indistinguishability",
    ", a large detuning appears most helpful in the quantum - dot case where large purcell enhancements can be achieved . with this approach",
    ", we are optimistic that solid - state single - photon sources can be improved to a level where they will be truly useful for quantum network applications such as creating distributed entanglement between matter qubits .                                                                                            c.  santori , d.  fattal , s.m .",
