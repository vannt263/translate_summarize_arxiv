    "low - surface - brightness ( lsb ) galaxies are one of the main constituents of the realm of galaxies . they are usually defined as objects with a blue central surface brightness @xmath1 significantly fainter than the freeman value of 21.65 mag  arcsec@xmath2 @xcite .",
    "however , the threshold value of @xmath1 to classify galaxies as lsb galaxies varies in the literature from @xmath3 23.0 mag  arcsec@xmath2 @xcite to @xmath3 22.0 mag  arcsec@xmath2 @xcite .",
    "the understanding of the important role of lsb galaxies for many issues of extragalactic research came during the last 1015 years ( see , e.g. , reviews by * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "there are many topics for which the knowledge of the properties of the lsb galaxy population is crucial .",
    "they include the following : a ) the galaxy luminosity function , especially at its faint end , ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which in turn is related to the understanding of the primordial power spectrum of density fluctuations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; b ) the spatial distribution of lower - mass galaxies , which allows us to check the predictions of cold dark matter cosmology for large - scale - structure formation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; d ) the role of interactions in galaxy evolution ; and many others .",
    "the detection of lsb galaxies is difficult owing to their intrinsically low global luminosities and their characteristic low surface brightness . despite more than 20 years of lsb galaxy studies",
    ", their census remains incomplete .",
    "even in the local group new , very faint dwarf galaxies are still being detected , including four new galaxies within 0.8 mpc in the past four years @xcite .",
    "several samples of lsb objects , identified with different criteria and on either photographic plates , or on ccd images , have been published during last 20 years ( for a review see * ? ? ?",

    "they comprise hundreds of galaxies with a central blue surface brightness , ( sb ) @xmath4 , in the range of 22 to 26 mag  arcsec@xmath2 .",
    "the number of known galaxies with lower central sb drops quickly . in the range of @xmath5  =  24 to 26 mag",

    "very faint lsb galaxies can have large errors in their photometric parameters or may be artifacts , thus their real number is likely smaller .",

    "the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is well suited for searches for and studies of lsb galaxies due to its homogeneity , area coverage , and depth ( see the sdss project book ) .",
    "the sdss is an imaging and spectroscopic survey that will eventually cover about one quarter of the celestial sphere .",

    "the conclusions drawn from this study are summarized in ",
    "[ txt : summ ] .",
    "in order to find the best method for identifying lsb galaxy candidates in sdss data , it is helpful to use a test sample with known properties .",
    "our test sample is a subsample from the @xcite ( isib96 hereafter ) catalog , which overlaps with the edr .",
    "the isib96 catalog and hence our test sample includes disk galaxies of various types , namely both high - surface - brightness ( hsb hereafter ) and lsb galaxies .",
    "we tried to pick a sufficiently large test sample in order to be able to study the various factors affecting an effective automatic selection procedure .",
    "the resulting sample consists of 92 galaxies from isib96 that lie in 93 `` fields''12@xmath1110 . ] of",
    "the edr `` runs '' 752 and 756 .",
    "most fields only contain one isib96 galaxy .",
    "several of these galaxies fall into the regions near the boundary of 2 adjacent fields , and thus were detected on both of them . in a few of the fields several sample galaxies are located .",
    "the whole area of these 93 fields on the sky , accounting for partly common boundary regions , is about 3 square degrees .",
    "11 objects from this test sample are classified by isib96 as dwarf ellipticals without ( de ) or with nuclei ( den ) , while the remaining galaxies comprise various types of disk galaxies ranging from different types of spirals to magellanic irregulars ( i m ) and dwarf irregulars ( dirr ) . in accordance with our intention to use disk galaxies of various types as a training set ,",
    "the test sample that we selected from isib96 covers a range of central surface brightnesses @xmath5 from 18.2 to 26.4 mag  arcsec@xmath2 . as follows from our measurements ( see section  [ txt : disc ] for details ) the fraction of lsb galaxies is indeed rather high : @xmath1236% of the galaxies with @xmath3 230 arcsec@xmath2 or @xmath1270% of the galaxies with @xmath3 220 arcsec@xmath2 .",
    "lsb galaxies are a subgroup of the general galaxy population and comprise primarily extended , quiescently evolving disk galaxies , irregular galaxies , and dwarf galaxies lacking extended starbursts .",
    "the sdss pipeline automatically detects point sources and extended sources .",
    "the latter are mainly galaxies and include many lsb galaxies .",
    "therefore , we first tested whether it is possible to exploit the sdss edr image database for the efficient selection of extended lsb galaxies and for the derivation of their main photometric and structural parameters .",
    "we carried out these tests on sdss fields that included galaxies from our test sample ( using the sdssqt query tool ( see * ? ? ? * for a description and details ) ) and tried to recover these known lsb galaxies .",
    "we found that the standard procedures employed for the creation of the edr catalogs to classify and measure photometric characteristics of objects split many extended galaxies with sufficiently prominent knots ( such as luminous hii regions ) into several separate entities , each listed as a galaxy of its own .",
    "this problem with sufficiently bright and extended galaxies was pointed out by other authors in the course of their work with edr catalog data as well @xcite and is known as `` galaxy shredding '' .",
    "the latter problem revealed the need for own photometry software to recalculate the integrated photometric parameters for the affected galaxies .",
    "furthermore , many tests with various photometric parameters from the edr , in the attempt to figure out the most efficient means to recover the test sample galaxies , have shown that either a significant ( up to 30% ) fraction of galaxies were missed , or that with relaxed selection criteria ( which improved the detection rate of the test sample ) a large number of unwanted objects was found , which in no way are related to the galaxies we are looking for .",
    "these unwanted objects exceeded several times the number of galaxies from the test sample , rendering this search method highly inefficient .",
    "for these reasons , we decided to create our own detection software .",
    "isib96 selected galaxies with angular sizes @xmath13 30 , where @xmath14 is the major - axis diameter at the limiting isophote of the apm scans ( @xmath15  =  24.5@xmath160.5 mag  arcsec@xmath2 @xcite or @xmath17 mag  arcsec@xmath2 @xcite ) .",
    "therefore we have also chosen angular size as the primary criterion to select candidate galaxies .",
    "we used a simple algorithm for the detection and subsequent photometry of galaxies with large angular sizes on the sdss images .",
    "the new programs that we created for these purposes are based on the kitt peak international spectral survey ( kiss ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) reduction package @xcite and some programs from the astrophysical institute of potsdam ( aip ) package in midas @xcite for adaptive filtering and topological operations with masks .",
    "the input data for our programs consist of : ( 1 )  sdss direct images ( fpc files ) for each field in the @xmath6 and @xmath7 filters , ( 2 )  sdss tables ( fpobj files ) , where all information about the objects found in the field with photo @xcite is stored , and ( 3 )  tables with astrometric and photometric coefficients extracted from the sdss database with the sdssqt query tool .",
    "we tried to use as much information as possible from the sdss database to simplify our software : information about positions of all objects identified as stars in the sdss fields , astrometric coefficients , and coefficients for recalculations of measured fluxes into the sdss photometric system .",
    "knowledge of the positions of stars is important , since these objects act as contaminants for galaxy flux determinations .    the processing steps of our programs can be conveniently described in terms of 8 discrete tasks or modules : ( 1 ) alignment and combining of @xmath18 images ; ( 2 ) filtering of the combined image ; ( 3 ) object detection ; ( 4 ) integrated photometry ; ( 5 ) creation of surface brightness profiles ( sbp hereafter ) ; ( 6 ) rejection of false detections ; ( 7 ) fitting of sbps ; ( 8) calculations of total magnitudes .",
    "we briefly outline these tasks below :      the goal of this task is to create a single combined direct image with better _ signal - to - noise ratio _ ( _ snr _ hereafter ) as compared to the separate @xmath19 , and @xmath20 images .",
    "we concentrate on images obtained in these three filters since here the greatest photometric depth is reached .",
    "the combined image is used in the following steps for the detection of galaxies with large angular sizes . to work in the astrometric system of the sdss we selected @xmath21-frame coordinates as reference",
    "coordinate system .",
    "we produce a geometrical transformation of the _ u , g , i , _ and _ z _ frames to the coordinates of the @xmath21 frame for each field . for this",
    "we use the coordinates of the 100 bright unsaturated stars from the sdss field , which we extract from the fpobj table .",
    "since @xmath19 , and @xmath20 images have different @xmath22 ( where @xmath23 , and @xmath24 is the background level ) , and in order to obtain an optimal _ snr _ ratio @xcite we used the weighted factors @xmath25 for averaging . here the index @xmath26 denotes the @xmath26-image , for which we use a weighting factor @xmath27 . for the estimation of the background level and noise dispersion at this and all consequent steps we use an algorithm that was developed for kiss reductions @xcite , which is similar to that of @xcite .",
    "this robust algorithm is based on the calculation of a histogram distribution for pixel values of the frame and on fitting a gaussian function to that histogram distribution .",
    "this task serves to filter the combined image in order to decrease the noise of the background and thus to facilitate the detection of galaxies with the sufficiently low central surface brightness .",
    "we consider the problem of filtering as a problem of robust estimation of an average value in the window where objects of interest are mixed up with all other sources from the background noise .",
    "different kinds of non - linear filters were used in the course of various lsb galaxy searches @xcite .",
    "proper filtering is a very important step .",
    "our tests showed that 42% of the galaxies with @xmath28 mag  arcsec@xmath2 presented in this paper were detected only after we applied filtering . without filtering they were not detected by our programs even when a threshold as low as 1.5@xmath29 of the noise of the combined @xmath18 frame was used . for @xmath30 mag  arcsec@xmath2",
    "the number of galaxies that remain undetected without filtering is 90% .",
    "two criteria were used for the choice of the filter and smoothing window size : ( 1 ) the requirement to detect all galaxies from the test sample while minimizing false detections and ( 2 ) the requirement that the total calculation time required by all our programs should not exceed more than 12 months for @xmath07000 sdss fields that we plan to analyze in future ( see section  [ txt : future ] ) .",
    "finally , after a number of tests , we use the combination of two filters that work one after the other with the same window size of 27 pixels ( @xmath12105 ) : a smooth - and - clip ( sac ) filter @xcite and the fast median smoothing algorithm with circular window , implemented into midas by @xcite .",
    "we use simple thresholding to detect galaxies with large angular sizes at the surface brightness level above the limiting isophote .",
    "we divide this procedure into two separate iterations : ( 1 ) the detection of objects above the 3@xmath29 noise level on the unsmoothed combined images , ( 2 ) additional detection of objects above the 3@xmath29 noise level on the smoothed combined images . in both cases",
    "the @xmath29 of the noise is estimated by the same method as described in section [ txt : method_alig ] .",
    "mask frames are generated during each step .",
    "these are frames where topologically isolated areas have their own unique integer labels .",
    "such areas are called masks and show the location of the selected objects . for both steps",
    "we are looking for objects with areas of connected pixels at or above the detection threshold of 2900 pixels .",
    "this corresponds to the area of round objects with the radii r@xmath3112  or diameters d@xmath3124 .",
    "this radius was selected as limit to detect the smallest galaxy in our test sample .",
    "in the course of the first iteration we usually detect all bright stars and bright large galaxies .",
    "comparison with the positions of the 50 brightest stars from the fpobj table allows us to select all such cases in our list except for bright stars ( @xmath32 15@xmath33 ) and @xmath34 photometric systems are small , typically no more than a few hundredths of a magnitude . ] , which were usually classified as galaxies by the sdss photo software .",
    "we remove bright stars from our list but save their masks in the mask frame .",
    "the two mask frames after two iterations are joined into one and the areas around the brightest stars are excluded . finally , all selected objects have their own mask labels and mask size with the isophotal level found in the smoothed combined image . for illustration ,",
    "several of our detected galaxies with overplotted mask borders are shown in figure  [ fig : examples ] .",
    "no other criteria except the total area are used for the primary selection step .",
    "objects with centers that are located closer than 40 pixels ( @xmath1216 ) to the frame borders are rejected since most of them are detections of ghosts of bright stars .",
    "the centers of all selected objects are calculated using mask and filtered frames to exclude effects of background stars and possible bright hii regions .",
    "the position angle ( pa ) and axis ratio are calculated through the flux - weighted second - moments method ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) using masks and combined @xmath18 images .      this task is intended to derive accurate magnitudes and colors for the selected objects .",
    "subimages are extracted from the images in the @xmath6 and @xmath7 bands ( @xmath35 and @xmath7 images are transformed to the @xmath21 coordinate system as described above ) .",
    "their centers coincide with the centers of the selected objects while their sizes are 1.5 times larger than the masks created in the previous task .",
    "the latter is necessary for the correct local background determination and its proper subtraction . for each object",
    "the mask created with the previous task is increased by 10 pixels ( @xmath04 ) in all directions before the local background is calculated .",
    "all stars are subtracted from the image using their positions and petrosian radii in each filter from the sdss photometric database .",
    "all previously unrecognized background galaxies and foreground stars can be masked out by hand with additional circular masks .",
    "a code for fitting the sky background from the aip package for adaptive filtering is used , which constructs the background within the masked regions .",
    "this algorithm iteratively fills the background inside the mask by interpolating the background from the regions outside the mask @xcite .",
    "this algorithm is used twice : ( 1 ) to subtract any contaminating sources like foreground stars or background galaxies and ( 2 ) to fit and subtract the sky background .",
    "after that the apparent flux is measured inside the same mask for background - subtracted @xmath36 images . the instrumental flux is transformed into the apparent magnitude in the standard sdss photometric system .",
    "an example of several of our detected galaxies after preparation for the apparent magnitude calculation in the @xmath21-band is shown in figure  [ fig : examples ] .",
    "the total uncertainty of the instrumental magnitudes includes the uncertainty of the background determination @xmath37 and the photon noise @xmath38 , which can be calculated from poisson statistics . therefore the instrumental magnitude uncertainty @xmath39 is computed for the cumulative flux @xmath40 in the total mask area @xmath41 with the value of the local background dispersion @xmath42 : @xmath43 where @xmath44 and @xmath45 . the distributions of apparent @xmath21 magnitudes , absolute @xmath21 magnitudes ( m@xmath46 ) , velocities , calculated instrumental errors of the integrated magnitudes , pas , and axis ratios for all galaxies found in the 93 test fields with our programs are shown in figure  [ fig5 ] .",
    "the next task creates @xmath47 sbps of each detected galaxy using the background - subtracted images , which were used for the calculation of the integrated magnitudes . to simplify our programs and to make them more robust with regard to the creation of sbps for galaxies with different morphologies , our software generates sbps in the same way as photo does @xcite , i.e. , by measuring magnitudes in circular apertures . as the analysis in @xcite showed , good agreement exists between an elliptical fit and circular aperture photometry .",
    "standard sdss software creates sbps only for a constant number of apertures ( 15 apertures ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) at a fixed spacing .",
    "our task is capable of measuring sbps with any constant step size .",
    "we selected 10 step sizes as the standard aperture steps for our work .",
    "the uncertainty of each sb level is calculated in the same way as the uncertainty of the integrated magnitude ( with equation  ( [ eq : error ] ) ) . after a sbp",
    "is created , the effective radius r@xmath48 ( limiting the region of the galaxy , which contains the half of the light ) , the effective surface brightness @xmath49 ( the mean sb inside r@xmath48 ) , the radius of the region containing 90% of the integrated flux ( r@xmath50 ) , and the concentration index c = r@xmath50/r@xmath48 are calculated .",
    "as an example of the output from this task we show in figure  [ fig : sbps ] sbps in @xmath26 and the radial @xmath51 color profiles for several galaxies from the test sample .",
    "we also use some programs from the aip package to calculate the following parameters : the pa of the major axis for each filter , the axis ratio @xmath52 for each filter , effective surface brightnesses @xmath53 , and effective radii r@xmath54 .",
    "all these additional parameters are calculated using the multilevel mask approach @xcite , in which each region of intensities of the studied object is labelled with a different mask .",
    "apart from sbps , our task calculates curves of growth to compare the final magnitude with the integrated magnitude calculated with the previous task .",
    "usually these two magnitudes practically coincide . however , for galaxies located near the frame borders , whose masks are truncated by the borders , our programs in this task calculate galaxy parameters under the assumption that they are symmetric relative to their centers .",
    "the best illustration of such a case is ngc  4996 , found as an additional ( i.e. , non - isib96 ) very extended galaxy in the fields containing the galaxies from the test sample .",
    "the difference between the magnitude calculated within the mask area on the frame , and that calculated for the `` restored '' , extrapolated image is @xmath55  022 .",
    "this galaxy ( as it was originally found ) is reproduced in the left panel of figure  [ fig : examples_bilt ] . in the right panel of the same figure",
    "we show its `` restored '' image resulting from the assumption of symmetry beyond the frame borders .      after the primary selection algorithm identifies all sufficiently large objects and their model - independent parameters",
    "are calculated , we need to clean the list of false detections .",
    "this task is performed on an automatic level , subjecting the detected objects to selection criteria that identify : ( 1 ) very bright stars not recognized by photo as stars and which are therefore selected by our programs in the course of the object detection procedure ; ( 2 ) ghosts close to the borders of the sdss fields that stem from bright stars located outside of our fields ; ( 3 ) parts of extended halos around bright stars resembling the galaxies in which we are interested ; ( 4 ) parts of satellite tracks .",
    "all these false detections selected in the primary selection have either very unusual colors , or bright effective surface brightnesses @xmath53 calculated with aip package . to be confident we have checked visually all the rejected objects in order to estimate the quality of our criteria .",
    "as our statistics show about 80% of all false detections were rejected during this stage .",
    "since our programs are very simple and , by design , are looking for extended objects , they can not recognize all possible blends and other complicated cases ( ghosts , parts of halos around bright stars ) if these have photometric parameters close to `` normal '' galaxies .",
    "such cases thus can not be rejected by our task automatically either .",
    "therefore , during the second step we interactively checked all remaining candidates by eye to identify such objects .",
    "we applied our programs to all selected 93 sdss fields where the 92 galaxies from the test sample are located . altogether 245 candidates with sufficiently large angular sizes ( @xmath5612 ) were identified automatically in these fields in the course of the primary selection procedure . in the second step , as described above , most of the remaining bright stars ( marked in the sdss database as `` galaxies '' and therefore not rejected during the first step ) , their ghosts or parts of halos around them , and linear tracks from satellites were removed .",
    "this step resulted in the removal of 82 objects ( or @xmath079% of all false detections among the non - galaxies ) .",
    "all objects remaining after these two steps have been checked by eye to identify possible complicated cases that were not rejected automatically .",
    "this step revealed 22 more false candidates ( @xmath021% of all false detections ) , which were then removed by hand .",
    "this task produces fits to the @xmath57 sbps created earlier .",
    "it is well known that the fitting functions should be based upon the physics of the formation and evolution processes .",
    "unfortunately , these processes are still not well understood and the most commonly used functions are derived empirically .",
    "the fitting functions for elliptical galaxies and spiral galaxy bulges include the king model @xcite and de vaucouleurs law @xcite .",
    "recently @xcite suggested that a generalized version of the de vaucouleurs profile ( @xmath58 ) provides better bulge fits . on the other hand , @xcite and",
    "@xcite suggest that late - type spirals often have bulges best fitted by an exponential .",
    "exponentials @xcite and inner - truncated exponentials @xcite are usually used for the disk components of spiral galaxies .",
    "our programs follow the scheme to fit both the disk and bulge components with exponential sb profiles to measure their central surface brightness @xmath59 and scale length @xmath60 .",
    "the equation for such profiles in logarithmic scale usually looks as follows @xcite : @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the distance along the axis and @xmath63 is taken to be 1 for both bulge and disk . in very rare cases for dwarf galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ) with obvious @xmath64",
    "1 we fit the profile with only a disk and with @xmath63 as an additional parameter .",
    "this task is interactive and is based on the midas fit package @xcite , which uses different methods for performing a nonlinear least - squares fit of the data to a specified function .",
    "it also allows control over the inclusion of different parameters and the range of the data to be fitted .",
    "our program performs the fitting on the surface intensity data and accomplishes an optimized fit by minimizing the weighted rms deviation of the data from the fit function .",
    "it calculates weights as @xmath65 , where @xmath66 is the uncertainty calculated for each sb level with the previous task for the creation of sbps .",
    "some examples of our fitting are presented in figure  [ fig : sbps ] .",
    "we also incorporated the de vaucouleurs profile ( @xmath63 = 1/4 ) in our fit task in order to have the possibility ( 1 ) to automatically classify our observed sbps by comparing them to different model light profiles and finding the model profile with the smallest @xmath67 difference , and ( 2 ) to get fit parameters for bright elliptical galaxies in future applications of our programs .",
    "our method of galaxy detection and the subsequent determination of their integrated magnitudes is essentially isophotal photometry with a sufficiently deep isophotal detection limit ( @xmath68 ) that will be discussed in more detail in section  [ txt : limpar ] .",
    "it is well - known that unlike for point sources , the fraction of light of a galaxy contained within the limiting isophote @xmath68 is a function of several parameters such as central surface brightness @xmath69 , redshift , point - spread function ( psf ) , and cosmological dimming ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . in our case",
    "the minimal diameter of the selected galaxies of 24  is much larger than the psf , since the typical seeing in the sdss edr images is @xmath70 @xcite .",
    "thus any sample , selected with this method from sdss images , will be independent of the psf . in the case of a purely exponential surface brightness profile ( equation ( [ equ : exp_profile ] ) with @xmath71  1 )",
    "it can be shown in simple analytical form that the ratio of the total galaxy flux to that observed within the limiting isophote @xmath68 @xcite obeys @xmath72 where @xmath73 is the number of scale lengths @xmath60 observed within the limiting isophote . and in the general case @xmath73",
    "is given by @xmath74 where @xmath75 is a term accounting for the @xmath76 cosmological dimming in surface brightness and @xmath77 is a term to correct for the redshifting of the spectral energy distribution ( the @xmath78-correction ) .",
    "the dependence of a fraction of the light above the limiting isophote on @xmath76 is illustrated in @xcite . in figure",
    "[ fig : ratio_model ] we show the behaviour of the @xmath79 ratio versus the central surface brightness @xmath69 for various values of the limiting isophotes . in real galaxies",
    "the situation is , of course , more complicated .",
    "the true ratio @xmath79 is higher for galaxies with detectable bulge subsystems or srsic sbps ( @xmath80 in equation ( [ equ : exp_profile ] ) ) .",
    "if one wishes to avoid such a systematic bias in the determination of magnitudes , it is possible to calculate total magnitudes m@xmath81 integrated out to infinity ( for equation ( [ equ : exp_profile ] ) with @xmath82 ) using the equation @xmath83 here @xmath60 is in arcsec and index ` d ' refers to a purely exponential disk .",
    "the last term is @xmath121.995 .",
    "it is , however , difficult to get very accurate values for m@xmath81 , since they depend on the accuracy of the scale length and @xmath59 derived during the fit procedure and thus introduce extra uncertainties @xmath84 as one can see in figure  [ fig : model_errors ] ( top and middle panels ) , the mean uncertainty of the central surface brightness in , for example , the @xmath26 band is about 0.12 mag  arcsec@xmath2 , and the mean relative uncertainty of the scale length in this filter is @xmath04% .",
    "the respective median parameters are 0.08 mag  arcsec@xmath2 and @xmath03% .",

    "we therefore conclude that the detections noted by isib96 are probably caused by photographic plate defects .",
    "the occurrence of artifacts among some of the faintest galaxies in the sample of isib96 was also noticed by @xcite .",

    "is 004@xmath16004 , which is well consistent with the mean value of the total error for this band , @xmath145  =  008 .",
    "only 17 galaxies ( @xmath0  13% of the total number of the sample galaxies ) have @xmath146  008 , and only 4 galaxies ( @xmath0  3% ) have @xmath147 .",
    "the situation is similar for the @xmath21 and @xmath20 filters . as was described in section  [ txt : method ] , the total magnitudes in our method are available only after fitting sbps .",
    "this is due to the need to extrapolate the apparent light profile . while developing our software , we tried to use the extrapolation of curves of growth in order to calculate total magnitudes",
    "however , we found that in any case we need to choose different types of extrapolation .",
    "they are different for pure exponential disk , srsic profile , and bulge plus disk systems , and thus need to be taken into account when fitting the sbps .",
    "therefore , our total magnitudes are derived only for the @xmath26 , @xmath21 and @xmath20 filters , since we confine our sbp determinations to these three filters . for the @xmath35 and @xmath7 filters",
    "we do not perform this procedure , since the uncertainty of the additional light contributions affecting these extrapolations is in most cases significantly larger than the value of the respective term . as figure  [ fig : appar_total ] shows , our apparent magnitudes are often a sufficiently good approximation of the total magnitudes .",
    "for example , in section [ txt : phot_comp ] we compare our magnitudes and ned magnitudes for objects with brightnesses up to @xmath148 ( see figure  [ fig : phot_comp ] ) , i.e. , to @xmath149 for the typical color index @xmath150 . as one can see in figure  [ fig : appar_total ] , most of our galaxies in this magnitude range have @xmath151 and @xmath152 less than 003 .",
    "therefore it will be only a minor difference when using apparent magnitudes instead of total magnitudes , if total magnitudes are not available .      to examine the photometric quality of our data and to check our programs we tested our results in two ways :",
    "( 1 ) we compared the magnitudes obtained for the same objects detected in different sdss fields ( observed either within the same run , or in two different runs ) as an internal consistency check , and ( 2 ) we compared our magnitudes for previously known objects with the results of published photometry from the literature as an external consistency check .",
    "three galaxies from the test sample each were found in 2 different fields .",
    "thus , they were measured independently twice , and their integrated magnitudes are suitable to check the quality of our photometry and reliability of our error estimates .",
    "this comparison is shown in table  [ tbl : repeat ] .",

    "this implies that galaxies located in adjacent fields of the same run do not show significant differences in their total magnitudes .",
    "this repeatability underlines both the data quality and correct functioning of our programs . in both fields we are dealing with the same object from the same run . because the adjacent sdss fields have common regions with a width of 128 pixels @xcite , our programs found these galaxies in two fields , and the only difference is global and local background and noise determination .",
    "the same situation holds for galaxy sdss  j135230@xmath109002504 , found in two fields of _ different _ runs .",
    "therefore , we can state that we do not see any differences in the calibration between the sdss runs 752 and 756 .",
    "since one galaxy is too little for statistics , the planned future extension of this study to a much larger number of sdss fields ( of the same two interleaving runs , see section  [ txt : future ] ) will yield many more pairs of independent photometric measurements .    in figure",

    "therefore , even if we consider that ned data come from many different sources and do not constitute a uniform dataset as such , we expect that the comparison of our photometry with ned photometry and the comparison of isib96 photometry and ned data should show similar trends ( if any ) .",
    "the comparison shows that our magnitudes ( in @xmath103-band , as well as in other broad bands ) , after accounting for the uncertainties cited in ned ( figure  [ fig : phot_comp ] , both bottom panels ) , are well consistent with the magnitudes from ned . in particular , for the 12 isib96 galaxies in common with our sample and with ned the weighted r.m.s . of @xmath155(our@xmath108ned ) is 029 . for all 17 galaxies in common with our list and ned the weighted r.m.s . of @xmath155(our@xmath108ned )",

    "the weighted r.m.s for @xmath155(isib96@xmath108ned ) is 08 . for extreme cases",
    "the difference between isib96 magnitudes and those listed in ned amounts to up to 1015 .",
    "this suggests that besides the random errors in the isib96 sample , some of their galaxies suffer from rather large systematic shifts .",
    "further support of this conclusion can be found in @xcite , where one additional measurement is presented for the galaxy 1226 + 0105 from isib96 .",
    "its magnitude in isib96 , @xmath103=157 , is very different from our value for this galaxy , @xmath103=1634 .",
    "@xcite obtained ccd photometry of this galaxy and measured @xmath103=1610@xmath16007 .",

    "after the de - correction for dimming ( v@xmath158 = 23655 km s@xmath10 , @xcite ) and extinction we get @xmath103=1627 , which is within the 1@xmath29 uncertainty of our @xmath103-magnitude .    as the last test",
    "we show ccd @xmath159 total photometry from @xcite for 5 galaxies in common with our sample .",
    "we analyzed these measurements separately from the ned because they are a uniform set of observations and have fainter magnitudes than the galaxies listed in the ned .",
    "four of these galaxies are also part of the isib96 data .",
    "the comparison of these published magnitudes with our photometry is shown in the right panels of figure  [ fig : phot_comp ] with asterisks .",

    "this lends further support to our conclusion that the absolute accuracy of our sdss photometry as compared to external data is @xmath162 .",
    "additionally , figure  [ fig : phot_comp ] ( both bottom panels ) demonstrates that our software allows us to get reliable magnitudes even for galaxies as bright as @xmath0100 in @xmath103-band from sdss data , whereas galaxies this luminous are excluded from the public sdss photometric database . most of the ned magnitudes for passbands other than @xmath103 are from ccd observations , while @xmath103-band magnitudes are mainly photoelectric . in the other bands",
    "we therefore see even better consistency between the magnitudes compiled in the ned and our total magnitudes . since , unfortunately , there are only a few measurements in each band , we estimated the scatter of the combined data in the remaining uvri bands .",

    "@xmath163(our@xmath108ned ) is 012 .",
    "thus , summarizing the results of the comparison of our new photometry with the @xmath153 magnitudes from isib96 and ned we conclude that : ( 1 ) in general the agreement is very good for the different bands , and our photometry results are reliable ; ( 2 ) the external quality of photometry for sdss data is about the same for the different bands and has a precision of @xmath162 ; ( 3 ) with our software we are capable of obtaining accurate photometry also for all bright ( non - lsb ) galaxies within the studied sky region , while photometry for many of these galaxies is not available from the sdss database or has larger uncertainties .",
    "this is an important by - product of our programs , since a large fraction of bright galaxies has either only photoelectric photometry @xcite or ccd photometry only in one or two bands .      to investigate the quality of structural parameters of our data we compared them with the data from isib96 .",
    "we emphasize that our definition of @xmath49 is different from the one used by isib96 .",
    "their @xmath49 corresponds to the surface brightness in the narrow annulus with a mean radius equal to @xmath164 .",
    "if these parameters would be defined for the same band , then for a pure exponential disk @xmath49 as defined by isib96 should be 070 fainter than according to our definition .    in figure",
    "[ fig : struct_comp ] we compare our parameters r@xmath165 , @xmath166 , and @xmath1 with the corresponding ones in isib96 .",
    "interacting galaxies as complex , composite systems were not included in this comparison .",
    "as shown in the upper panel of figure  [ fig : struct_comp ] , the values of the model - independent parameter r@xmath48 obtained in the present work for the test sample galaxies are in good agreement for most of the galaxies in isib96 .",
    "the difference is within 12 combined @xmath29 of r@xmath48 . to estimate this parameter we used @xmath167 derived directly from our measurements and the estimate for a purely exponential disk for isib96 data , based on their @xmath168 025 .",
    "this results in a relative error of r@xmath169 0.15 . only for five galaxies",
    "( that is , 6% ) are the differences significant .",
    "they exceed 2@xmath29 of the combined error , and it is difficult to explain them by random errors . since all our data are of uniform quality , we can suggest that a few galaxies of isib96 are based on lower quality data ( as follows also from our photometry comparison in section  [ txt : phot_comp ] ) , which caused larger uncertainties in the determination of their r@xmath48 as well .",
    "the parameter @xmath166 is more difficult to compare ( middle panel of figure  [ fig : struct_comp ] ) , since only for pure exponential disks our defined value ( the mean inside r@xmath48 ) and the isib96 parameter ( @xmath170 of the narrow annulus at r@xmath48 ) can be converted into each other through a simple relation .",
    "even when accounting for this `` disk '' difference , the scatter is still significant and shows some systematic deviations on both high and low surface brightness levels .",
    "the typical uncertainty of the photometric calibration of the photographic plates used in the work by isib96 is @xmath0025 @xcite .",
    "this implies that the uncertainty of their @xmath166 is at least at this level . besides the term related to @xmath171",
    "should be added .",
    "thus , @xmath171 is calculated with the equation @xmath172 where @xmath85 is the uncertainty in the total / observed magnitude and @xmath167 is the uncertainty for @xmath164 .",
    "as discussed above , the error in r@xmath48 for our data was estimated directly . for isib96 data",
    "it was estimated for a purely exponential disk as 0.15 of r@xmath48 .",
    "the combined error bars for the differences in @xmath49 are shown in the middle panel of figure  [ fig : struct_comp ] .",
    "the great majority of the data from our sdss parameters and those from isib96 are consistent within 2@xmath29 of the combined error ( @xmath00810 ) .",
    "however , for about 20% of the galaxies the differences are larger . as follows from section  [ txt : phot_comp ] ,",
    "the uncertainties of our photometry are significantly lower than those from isib96 .",
    "thus the total uncertainties for the differences in @xmath49 will be defined mainly by uncertainties from @xcite .",
    "therefore , large deviations ( i.e. , more than twice the combined @xmath29 , or @xmath00810 ) should be attributed both to the mentioned photometry problems for some objects in isib96 and to differences in the definition of @xmath49",
    ".    of greater concern , however , are the rather large differences apparent in the comparison of the model - dependent central surface brightness @xmath1 that is shown in the bottom panel of figure  [ fig : struct_comp ] .",
    "for each point the total uncertainty includes the 025 from isib96 and the uncertainty that was defined in course of our fitting procedure . in reality",
    ", the average uncertainty for @xmath1 given by isib96 should probably be at least two times larger than average uncertainty of the total magnitude .",
    "we show , therefore , the average combined 2@xmath29 level as 10 . however , even with this 2@xmath29 uncertainty level about 23% of objects exhibit larger deviations . in particular , in many cases , for galaxies with a central luminous component such as a bulge or bar ,",
    "the parameter @xmath1 from isib96 was significantly brighter than ours .",

    "to summarize , we exploited the superb quality of the sdss imaging data to re - measure the structural and photometric properties .",
    "we then compared our results with the published data for the test sample galaxies . for a substantial number of galaxies the estimates of some parameters that are important for further analysis",
    "are improved in comparison to the values derived in the original work .",
    "in a later paper we will address issues concerning the resulting selection function , and completeness via monte - carlo simulations of the selection process .",
    "however , some useful estimates for the selection thresholds of our method can be derived using very simple models and through the measured parameters of the detected galaxies .",
    "the use of highly homogeneous sdss images obtained in drift - scan mode and of a very simple primary selection criterion ( total area ) allow us to easily estimate the limiting isophote parameter of our selection procedure .",
    "however , the use of combined @xmath18 and filtered images to search for galaxies makes the estimation of this criterion more complicated . as a first step",
    ", we tried to estimate the limiting isophote in the @xmath26 filter ( @xmath174 ) using the background level and noise estimation on @xmath26 band images before combining , after combining , and after filtering of the combined frames .",
    "this is possible only because our background level for images in the @xmath26 filter and in the combined images is the same as follows from our description of the steps for aligning and combining the @xmath18 images ( see section  [ txt : method_alig ] for details ) .",
    "we carried out such estimates for several randomly selected fields .",
    "they show that we have a mean limiting surface brightness 3@xmath29 isophote @xmath175  26.4 mag  arcsec@xmath2 .",
    "unfortunately , devising a similar procedure of estimating @xmath68 for other bands is less straightforward .",
    "next , we tried to estimate the limiting surface brightness isophote analytically using the following equation for a pure exponential surface brightness profile @xcite :    @xmath176\\ ] ]    in this equation @xmath177 is the limiting angular diameter ( in arcsec ) of the galaxy with an exponential sbp at the limiting surface brightness isophote @xmath68 . since @xmath59 and @xmath68 in this equation",
    "refer to the same band as @xmath87 , we can apply equation ( [ equ : allen_shu ] ) to any photometric band of interest .",
    "the expression for @xmath177 may be used for any angular - limited sample .",
    "for example , @xcite applied it to analyze selection effects based on the structural parameters for a sample of lsb galaxies found in the virgo cluster .    in our case @xmath87 for a purely exponential sbp can be calculated using the fit parameters and equation ( [ equ : disk_tot ] ) .",
    "the limiting surface brightness is defined as the level above which we detected our objects .",
    "it can therefore be determined by comparison with a grid of model curves from equation ( [ equ : allen_shu ] ) with @xmath68 as a parameter .",
    "since we defined our limiting angular size @xmath177 precisely as 24  ( section  [ txt : method_detect ] ) , one needs to vary only the limiting surface brightness @xmath68 of these models in order to put the model curves on the plot of @xmath178 versus total @xmath104 magnitude for underlying disks .",
    "the respective lines for the @xmath26 band are shown in figure  [ fig : model_limits ] , where we plotted them for three limiting surface brightnesses @xmath68 = 25.0 , 26.0 , and 26.5 mag  arcsec@xmath2 . as evident from the figure , both",
    "the test sample galaxies ( filled diamonds ) and additionally selected galaxies ( crosses ) define the unique model curve ( as expected from the selection procedure ) , corresponding to the limiting surface brightness @xmath179  26.5 mag  arcsec@xmath2 .",
    "there are no galaxies to the left of this curve .",
    "all are situated either to the right of it or fall ( within the uncertainties of their parameters ) right on top of this curve .",
    "this estimated limiting surface brightness isophote for @xmath26 is even slightly fainter than our previous rough estimate @xmath179  26.4 mag  arcsec@xmath2 , but the difference between these two values is not large . since the second estimate is a global one ( i.e. , it allows us to produce an estimate for all data simultaneously ) , we will adopt this value as the estimate of @xmath174 hereafter .",
    "a similar analysis was performed for the @xmath21 and @xmath20 bands as well .",
    "the resulting threshold values are @xmath180  26.2 mag  arcsec@xmath2 for the @xmath21 band and @xmath181  25.9 mag  arcsec@xmath2 for the @xmath20 band . to compare our limiting parameters with those from previous studies we transformed @xmath174 and @xmath122 to @xmath15 with the equations from @xcite . thus , our limiting surface brightnesses correspond to @xmath182  26.9 mag  arcsec@xmath2 in the standard johnson b - band .",
    "this value is slightly deeper in comparison to the claimed value of isib96 @xmath17 mag  arcsec@xmath2 .",
    "based on the plot in figure  [ fig : model_limits ] we can also discuss the distribution of scale lengths @xmath60 of the detected galaxies .",
    "the dotted straight lines drawn in this plot show the positions of exponential disks from equation ( [ equ : disk_tot ] ) with scale lengths of @xmath60 = 2 , 25 , 3 , 10 , 30 , and 90 . as expected from the limiting isophotes in figure  [ fig : model_limits ] , the most compact galaxies that our software should be able to detect are objects with @xmath60 = 2 , if their @xmath135 is brighter than or equal to 20 mag  arcsec@xmath2 .",
    "however , although our sample contains galaxies with bright centers , the five most compact galaxies actually detected ( both from the test sample as well as new detections ) have @xmath183 25 .",
    "thus , from this rather limited sample we can infer that our programs can confidently detect disk galaxies with scale lengths @xmath184 .",
    "as one can see , most of the sample galaxies have @xmath185 ranging from 3  to 10 .",
    "only 11 galaxies ( @xmath08% ) have @xmath186 10 .",
    "two galaxies in the sample are found to have @xmath186 20 .",
    "one of them , with @xmath185 = 23 , is a galaxy from the test sample .",
    "so , the real fraction of extended objects in our sample is seemingly limited not by our methods , but by their presence in the test sample .",
    "the evidence for the effective detection of extended galaxies comes from the largest and the brightest galaxy in our sample ",
    "ngc  3521 with @xmath183  75 , which was absent in the test sample .",
    "finally , we conclude that our software is capable to detect galaxies with scale lengths @xmath185 at least up to @xmath01  on sdss images .",
    "of course , the limited size of the sdss fields ( 12@xmath1110 ) begins to play a significant role in the selection procedure for such extended galaxies .",
    "however , even for such extended galaxies our programs will detect at least `` the tip of iceberg '' with sufficiently high probability .",
    "it is also worth noting that on the sdss frame containing ngc  3521 , whose final mask had the size of @xmath01/2 of the whole frame , our programs found two more galaxies , one of which ( 1103@xmath1090007 ) exists also in the test sample . as for galaxies with @xmath187 90(dashed line in figure  [ fig : model_limits ] )",
    "one has to work with the much larger sdss mosaic frames ( see stoughton et al .",
    "2002 for details ) to ensure their detection .",
    "the expected limiting @xmath69 also can be estimated from the plot in figure  [ fig : model_limits ] .",
    "it of course depends on the galaxy scale length .",
    "in particular , for galaxies with @xmath188  25  our software should detect galaxies as dim as @xmath189  26.0 mag  arcsec@xmath2 ( which corresponds to @xmath190  26.3 mag  arcsec@xmath2 ) . since these estimates account only for pure exponential disks , any additional light from bulge , bar , or hii regions will improve the possibility to detect such a faint disk .",
    "the distribution of @xmath135 for all studied galaxies is shown in figure  [ fig : observed_mu0 ] .",
    "all objects , both from the test sample as well as the additional detections , fall in the range of @xmath191 mag  arcsec@xmath2 .",
    "based only on the properties of these galaxies one can hardly judge the possibility to detect fainter disks with our software .",
    "however , for further analysis we can use the fact that several objects as dim as @xmath192  26.0 mag  arcsec@xmath2 were detected during the preliminary process of extended object identification . in the subsequent checks they were recognized as artifacts ( ghosts of bright stars ) .",
    "their parameters , however , indicate that if these objects were real galaxies , galaxies this faint will very likely be detected by our software . in figure",
    "[ fig : ghost_g ] we show for illustration the surface brightness profile of one of the ghost artifacts with @xmath192  26.00 mag  arcsec@xmath2 and @xmath193  2418 .",
    "these `` disk '' parameters correspond to a total magnitude of @xmath194  1708 .",
    "a real galaxy with such parameters will appear just on the border of the allowed region on diagram @xmath135 versus @xmath195 in figure  [ fig : model_limits ] ( star symbol ) .",
    "it is worth noting that our selection criteria produce a bias against edge - on galaxies . since we separate objects with the total area within the limiting isophote greater than some minimal threshold ,",
    "the lower limit for their major - axis diameter of 24  is valid only for round , face - on galaxies .",
    "for elongated galaxies , the lower limit for this parameter varies as @xmath196 thus , for the most elongated galaxies ( @xmath1970.1 ) we will detect all objects with major - axis diameter larger than 76 .",
    "since in order to describe sbps of galaxies with general srsic profiles one needs one more parameter , the discussion of galaxy selection effects becomes more complicated when indices of @xmath64  1 ( equation [ equ : exp_profile ] ) have to be used .",
    "we detected all galaxies of this type present in the test sample when applying our homogeneous selection criteria based on the size on the limiting isophote .",
    "they are shown in figure  [ fig : model_limits ] by open circles . however , for the same values of @xmath60 and @xmath59 such objects have total magnitudes fainter than objects with @xmath198  1 .",
    "the amount of the total flux decrease depends on value of @xmath63 .",
    "for example ,",
    "@xmath199  0.8 for @xmath198  1.67 and @xmath199  0.58 for @xmath198  5 . thus , @xmath64  1 shifts effectively such objects to the left in figure  [ fig : model_limits ] .",
    "this implies , e.g. , that some of these galaxies with sbp parameters falling close to the limiting model curve with @xmath179  26.55 mag  arcsec@xmath2 will remain undetected .",
    "this will cause some additional problems for the analysis of completeness in the future survey .",
    "this issue may be properly addressed via modelling of the srsic profile disk detection .",
    "our test sample from isib96 was chosen to allow us to optimize our search criteria such that we are capable of retrieving known lsb galaxies .",
    "for the development of our programs and algorithms we confined ourselves to the subset of sdss fields containing the galaxies from the test sample .",
    "these fields are non - contiguous and are drawn from a much larger area . owing to our biased area selection",
    "we can not draw conclusions regarding the statistical distribution and density of lsb galaxies , nor can we easily assess the overall completeness .",
    "however , the detection of numerous additional galaxies that fall in the same parameter space as the isib96 sample indicates that the sdss imaging data have the potential to significantly increase the number of known lsb galaxies ( see also section [ txt : future ] ) . in any case , even our current , limited survey has lead to a number of interesting scientific findings , some of which will be discussed briefly below .",
    "the depth and homogeneity of the sdss imaging data allow us to study processes such as large - scale star formation in the faint outer regions of galactic disks @xcite , which have been little studied so far .",
    "for example , a galactocentric radius @xmath200 ( where @xmath201 is defined by the @xmath202 mag isophote ) corresponds to an isophotal level @xmath203 mag  arcsec@xmath2 for @xmath204 , and an even brighter level for redder @xmath51 colors .",
    "these levels are much brighter than our limiting isophotal level of @xmath205 mag  arcsec@xmath2 .",
    "the study of star formation processes in the faint outskirts of disk galaxies provides a unique insight into the nature of the star formation law , preconditions for star formation , and star formation thresholds in regions that are characterized by physical environments ( such as lower metallicities and longer dynamical time scales , etc . )",
    "that are very different from those typical of the bright , inner regions of disks ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "an interesting galaxy offering such an opportunity is sdss  j140831@xmath10800073 ( 1405@xmath1090006 in isib96 ) .",
    "this galaxy has an unusual structure reminiscent of the multi - component disks mentioned by @xcite .",
    "the sbp of the disk of this galaxy is approximated best by two exponentials , corresponding to an `` inner '' and an `` outer '' disk .",
    "this galaxy was classified by isib96 as sb(r ) . on the sdss images , a bulge , a bar , and different spiral patterns in the `` inner '' disk and in the `` outer '' disk",
    "are clearly seen ( fig .",
    "[ fig : outer_disk ] ) .",
    "the `` inner '' disk is characterized by @xmath206 mag  arcsec@xmath2 and @xmath207 kpc . at a surface brightness of @xmath208 mag  arcsec@xmath2 ( @xmath209  15 ) , the `` inner '' spiral arms disappear .",
    "this surface brightness limit also corresponds to the apparent size of this galaxy given in previous studies , and to the outer limit of the `` inner '' disk . on the sdss images we found a new subsystem of spiral arms fainter than @xmath210 mag  arcsec@xmath2 .",
    "the contrast - enhanced image ( plotted with @xmath211 to @xmath212 , where @xmath29 is the noise of the sky background ) is shown in the right panel of figure  [ fig : outer_disk ] .",
    "the limiting isophotal level above which this galaxy was detected corresponds to @xmath213 mag  arcsec@xmath2 ( plotted as a solid line in figure  [ fig : outer_disk ] ) , yielding a scale length @xmath60 for the `` outer '' disk of @xmath214 kpc .",
    "the central surface brightness for the `` outer '' disk is @xmath215 mag  arcsec@xmath2 .",
    "the flux ratio of the `` inner '' and the `` outer '' disk , m@xmath216/m@xmath217 , is approximately 1.2 .",
    "while the detailed nature of this galaxy remains uncertain at this point , we may be seeing an example of the class of galaxies with `` stepped disks '' described in @xcite .",
    "it is interesting that each of the two disk components exhibits its own distinct spiral pattern .",
    "planned long - slit spectroscopy will tell us more about the rotational properties of sdss  j140831@xmath10800073 and the metallicities of the `` inner '' and `` outer '' disks .",
    "@xcite show that the hi profile of this system is very narrow ( w@xmath218 km s@xmath10 and w@xmath219 km s@xmath10 ) .",
    "@xcite discuss the possibility that this kind of galaxy may have a very low effective viscosity , allowing outlying gas to retain its initial angular momentum .",
    "a possibly similar case is the galaxy ngc  6946 described in @xcite , which also shows spiral arms in its outskirts that do not appear to be connected with its `` inner '' arms .",
    "our photometric programs calculate a number of global morphological parameters for every galaxy . some of these may be useful for morphological galaxy classifications ( see earlier discussions by , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "a particularly useful parameter is the concentration index ( @xmath220 hereafter ) , defined as the ratio of the radii containing 90% and 50% of a galaxy s light . for the classical de vaucouleurs profile , @xmath220 is @xmath05.5 , and for pure exponential disks , @xmath221 .",
    "these values are valid for the idealized seeing - free case , which we are approximating due to the limiting angular size @xmath222 that we impose in this work .    in figure",
    "[ fig : conc_index ] the relation between the color index @xmath223 and the concentration index in the @xmath21-band , c(@xmath105 ) , is plotted .",
    "we selected the color index @xmath223 for two reasons : ( 1 ) as a robust index from the point of view of signal to noise , and ( 2 ) since it provides a good temperature baseline considering the wavelength separation between the two bands .",
    "isib96 and ned list morphological classifications for the galaxies in our sample , which we revised in a number of cases based on the sdss image material . the adopted classification is shown in column 10 of table  [ tbl-1 ] ( see section  [ txt : test ] ) .",
    "based on this classification we divided all galaxies in our sample into following categories ( barred types included ) shown in figure  [ fig : conc_index ] : ( a ) early - type spiral galaxies ( s0  sa ) ; ( b ) intermediate - type spirals ( sb  sc ) ; ( c ) late - type galaxies : sd , sm , and various irr and di ; ( d ) des ; and ( e ) interacting galaxies .",
    "we added e galaxies ( open squares ) in this figure to see overall distribution of all different morphological types .",
    "the theoretical values for the concentration index for classical de vaucouleurs profiles and for pure exponential disks are shown by dashed lines there too .",
    "the bimodality in the distribution of galaxies noticed by @xcite is clearly visible in figure [ fig : conc_index ] : early - type galaxies are located in the parameter region @xmath224 and @xmath225 , and late - type galaxies are characterized by @xmath226 and @xmath227 .",
    "intermediate - type spirals are found in both branches of the distribution .",
    "our empirical separation at @xmath228 for these `` branches '' is in excellent agreement with the one found by @xcite , @xmath229 . but",
    "using @xmath230 as the only morphological separation criterion has certain drawbacks that lead to ambiguities : additional substructure such as spiral arms and bulges in spiral galaxies or hii regions in irregular galaxies will change both @xmath220 and color and often act in opposite ways .",
    "we plan to use the large sample of galaxies that will result from the application of our programs to larger areas of the sdss ( section  [ txt : future ] ) to devise an improved , more detailed classification scheme .    a few more comments on figure  [ fig : conc_index ] : ( 1 ) our empirical upper limit for the concentration index is @xmath231 , close to the theoretical value for the classical de vaucouleurs profile ( @xmath232 ) .",
    "our upper limit differs from the value @xmath233 calculated based on petrosian radii by @xcite as given in the sdss photometric database .",
    "this difference is caused by the method employed for the calculation of petrosian magnitudes by the standard sdss software ( e.g. , @xcite ) , which systematically underestimates petrosian magnitudes not only for galaxies with pure de vaucouleurs profiles , but for all galaxies with bulges .",
    "the amplitude of this shift depends on the bulge - to - disk ratio @xcite ) .",
    "( 2 ) interacting galaxies as complex systems may be located in any part of this diagram and can not easily be recognized . ( 3 ) disk systems are characterized by @xmath234 .",
    "shifts to lower values of @xmath220 occur when additional light from spiral arms and/or hii regions contribute .",
    "( 4 ) practically all de systems are located below @xmath235 as well .",
    "this is in agreement with the theoretical expectations since most of these galaxies have sbps with @xmath80 ( equation ( [ equ : exp_profile ] ) ) .",
