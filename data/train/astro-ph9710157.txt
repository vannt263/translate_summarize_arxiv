    "red giants and long - period variables provide crucial information on stellar and galactic evolution .",
    "it is thus essential to be able to interpret their spectra and photometry in terms of stellar parameters ( effective temperature , chemical composition , mass , etc ) and physical processes ( presence of shocks , of a wind , etc ) . in spite of the difficulty to model these stars due to the many complications arising from low temperatures ( molecule and dust formation ) and the often very extended atmosphere , important progress in the modelling of static ( plez et al .",
    "1992 ; see also the review by plez 1997 ) and dynamic ( bowen 1988 ; fleischer et al .  1992 ; hfner & dorfi 1997 ) cool star atmospheres have been achieved in the last years .",
    "+ confrontation with observations is the natural aim of any modelling attempt .",
    "checking the validity of the various models assumptions and inputs is obviously essential .",
    "some recent investigations have dealt with high resolution spectroscopic observations ( e.g.  plez et al .",
    "1993 ) while others concentrated on photometry ( bessell et al .",
    "they demonstrate that model atmospheres and synthetic spectra are now reaching a high quantitative agreement with observations , due to the recent great improvement in opacity completeness and accuracy . + the near - infrared narrow - band photometry of lockwood ( 1972 ) ,",
    "described in sect .  2 , has various qualities which make it very suitable for the study of m  giants and mira variables .",
    "it consists of narrow - band filters around 1 @xmath0 m , a spectral region where very cool stars emit most of their energy and where , unfortunately , very few observed spectra are available .",
    "the narrow - band filters used allow a precise study of absorption features of molecules dominating the optical spectrum of cool stars , titanium oxide ( tio ) and vanadium oxide ( vo ) , for which new data have been recently published .",
    "furthermore , lockwood s data represent one of the very few set of regular observations on whole cycles of a large number of miras .",
    "the study of the effects of pulsation on absorption features is thus possible .",
    "observational evidence for a phase lag between indices related to tio and vo absortion features is given ( sect .",
    "3 ) . in sect .  4 ,",
    "synthetic colours from static models are computed and compared to m  giant colours . thanks to the updated millions of spectral lines taken into account , a remarkable agreement is obtained . in sect .",
    "5 we compute lte radiative transfer in hydrodynamic models that satisfactorily reproduce the colour variations and the phase lag for mira variables .",
    "lockwood ( 1972 ; hereafter l72 ) observed 292 m and s  type mira variables from 1969 to 1971 at the kitt peak national observatory , with a five - colour narrow - band photometric system based on wing s 27 colours system ( wing 1967 ) .",
    "he obtained 1795 individual sets of five - colour measurements , at different phases , and , for some stars , during several cycles .",
    "the narrow - bands were chosen to measure depths of molecular band heads of tio and vo , or regions relatively free of molecular absorption .",
    "table  1 lists the properties of the five - colour system .",
    "the 78 and 88 filters were used to measure several bands of tio .",
    "the vo absorption was measured by the 105 filter .",
    "the 87 and 104 filters were expected to match continuum regions .",
    "however , it appeared to lockwood that the 87 filter becomes contaminated by tio bands in the later m stars . in l72",
    "are tabulated the measurements of the 104 magnitudes and of the four colours : 78@xmath187 , 88@xmath187 , 87@xmath1104 , and 105@xmath1104 .",
    "the median standard errors were 0.012 mag for 104 and 0.006 mag for the colours .",

    "only the oxygen - rich miras have been subsequently considered .",
    "they represent a sample of 256 stars for which 1501 sets of five - colour measurements were obtained at several phases .",
    "the period distribution of the sample corresponds perfectly to the one obtained for the m ",
    "miras listed in the general catalogue of variable stars ( gcvs ; kholopov 1985 , 1987 ) .",
    "the stars were observed preferably near maximum and minimum of light curves .      in order to study the behaviour of tio and vo absorption features with phase ,",
    "we have considered four indices :    78@xmath188 : this index is proportional to the ratio between two different band heads of tio .",
    "it is a good effective temperature indicator for temperatures above 3000  k and thus was prefered to 88@xmath187 originally given in l72 . for lower temperatures ,",
    "the tio bands begin to saturate .",
    "78@xmath187 : the 87 and 88 filters overlap slightly . as a consequence ,",
    "the 78@xmath188 and 78@xmath187 indices are very similar .",
    "the absolute differences are always less than 0.2 mag .",
    "87@xmath1104 : lockwood originally hoped to obtain a colour temperature determination from this index as both filters were thought to measure regions free of strong molecular absorption . but",
    "filter 87 proves to be contaminated at least by tio bands .",
    "105@xmath1104 : it is related to vo bands",
    ". this index depends strongly on effective temperature below 3000  k where the vo molecular bands begin to appear .",
    "the first three indices can be considered to measure mainly tio features ( although we will show below that vo bands are also present in these passbands ) and 105@xmath1104 may be seen as a pure vo index .",
    "the indices 78@xmath188 and 105@xmath1104 complement each other very well as temperature indicators .",
    "they have been used to determine effective temperature for a large number of miras ( alvarez & mennessier 1997 ) .",
    "the four colours are each defined so as to increase linearly with decreasing effective temperature during a cycle .",
    "the phases of all sets of measurements are given in l72 .",
    "they were determined from the mean periods given in the gcvs and the aavso annual predictions .",
    "phase zero marks the maximum of the visual light curve .",
    "figure 1 shows the four indices calculated from the entire data ( 1501 measurements ) plotted against the phase .",
    "the curves represent the running average computed for 100 points on a 1/16th cycle interval .",
    "the data in the phase interval [ 0.5;1.0 ] are reproduced in the interval [ -0.5;0.0 ] .",
    "arrows indicate the extremes of each curve .",
    "such a plot has of course no real physical significance since the data are composed of observations of 256 different miras , which exhibit a large spread of periods and mean spectral types .",
    "nevertheless , it gives interesting insights into the global behaviour of the indices with phase .",
    "as expected , the colours reach a minimum around phase zero when the effective temperature is highest and reach a maximum around phase 0.5 , at minimum light .",
    "+ the important feature is the phase lag that exists between the 105@xmath1104 index and the other indices .",
    "the vo index has its minimum value at phase @xmath2 or so , whereas the indices 78@xmath188 , 78@xmath187 , 87@xmath1104 have their minimum slightly before phase zero .",
    "the same phase shift of about 0.1 is also found between the maxima : it occurs at @xmath3 for 105@xmath1104 , and around @xmath4 for the other colours .",
    "note that the dispersion around the mean value is minimum near phase zero for 87@xmath1104 and 105@xmath1104 and maximum near phase 0.5 , whereas the opposite is true of the two other indices .",
    "this is explained by the sensitivity , or the lack thereof , of the various indices in the effective temperature range above or below 3000  k ( see fig .",
    "7 ) . as a consequence ,",
    "the positions of the maxima of the tio indices ( 78@xmath187 , 78@xmath188 ) which saturate around 1.8 , are not easy to locate accurately .",
    "the vo index ( 105@xmath1104 ) has values clearly greater than zero only near the minimum light .",
    "thus , the presence or not of a phase lag is not totally obvious in fig .  1 .",
    "colour diagrams enable us to confirm that feature .",
    "figures 2 and 3 display the average colour  colour variation with phase for 78@xmath188/105@xmath1104 , and 78@xmath187/87@xmath1104 respectively .",
    "the average curves of fig .  1 are simply reported in those colour  colour diagrams .",
    "the filled circles mark phase zero and the arrows indicate the direction of variation during the cycle . + in the 78@xmath188/105@xmath1104 diagram ( fig .",
    "2 ) , a loop is clearly described during the cycle . to a single 78@xmath188 value two different 105@xmath1104 values",
    "corresponds , depending on whether the mira is rising or declining .",
    "this loop confirms that a phase lag exists between 78@xmath188 and 105@xmath1104 . on the other hand",
    ", there is no loop in the 78@xmath187/87@xmath1104 diagram ( fig .  3 ) .",
    "it demonstrates the absence of phase shift and thus the occurence of extremes at more or less the same phase , as can be seen in fig .  1 .",
    "similarly there is no phase lag between 78@xmath188 and 78@xmath187 .",
    "only 105@xmath1104 is out - of - phase by an amount of 0.1 .",
    "the presence ( absence ) of loop in the 78@xmath188/105@xmath1104 ( 78@xmath187/87@xmath1104 ) diagram is also verified when only a part of the sample of miras is considered .",
    "early and late spectral type miras or short and long period sub - samples have been tried . the apparent phase shift and",
    "the presence of a loop in a colour  colour diagram which is its counterpart are independent of period and spectral type .",
    "the loop for shorter periods ( higher @xmath5 ) is at smaller colour indices than that for longer periods ( lower @xmath5 ) .",
    "the results described above concern only mean values .",
    "the trends revealed by this _ global approach _ should be verified by considering the individual sets of observations . in the following",
    ", we adopted the complementary _ individual approach _ to determine the possible phase shifts .",
    "+ for each mira with a number of observations at least equal to six ( 93 objects ) , we fitted the four indices as a function of phase @xmath6 by sine curves : @xmath7\\ ] ] where @xmath8 is one of the four colours ; @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the three free parameters .",
    "+ we only used the miras which have observed colours distributed in a phase range larger than 0.3 in order to properly fit the observations .",
    "we excluded the stars for which : @xmath12 @xmath13 for these stars , the extremes given by the fit are too distant from the observations and thus are less reliable .",
    "finally , we rejected the miras with : @xmath14 as it means that these stars show no appearance of vo absorption bands during the whole cycle ( the temperature is always too high ) and the fits have no meaning in these cases .",
    "there is no such problem with the other colours .",
    "+ among the 93 miras with a number of observations greater than 5 , 76 finally remained .",
    "the phase shift between two indices is simply : @xmath15      figure 4 presents the histogram of phase shifts between the ( 78@xmath188 , 105@xmath1104 ) indices .",
    "a majority of miras clearly displays a phase lag .",
    "the distribution is almost symmetrical , the mean value being 0.08 , with a sigma of 0.07 .",
    "the variation of the 105@xmath1104 index lags behind that of 78@xmath188 , as it is observed in fig .  1 .",
    "the individual phase lag values are not correlated with period or spectral type .",
    "the histogram for the ( 78@xmath187 , 87@xmath1104 ) indices is shown in fig .",
    "no global phase lag is apparent as in fig .",
    "the calculated mean value is 0.01 with a sigma of 0.07 .",
    "+ the fit of the observations by sine curves is of course not really accurate and the individual phase lags determined with this method are not reliable , but both distributions provide an excellent statistical confirmation of what was concluded from the previous global approach : the 105@xmath1104 index appears out - of - phase with the other indices by an amount of almost 0.1 , which corresponds to more or less 30 days for a typical mira .",
    "lockwood ( 1972 ) already noted that miras perform large loops in a colour / spectral - type diagram .",
    "he pointed out that the mean phase of maximum light at 1.04 @xmath0 m occurs at 0.11 , whereas at v it occurs at phase zero by definition .",
    "mean minimum light at 1.04 @xmath0 m is reached almost simultaneously with mean minimum visual light , although the individual phases of these events often differ by 0.1 cycle or more .",
    "+ we have shown that the phase lag and the loop phenomenon are also displayed by the particular near infrared indices considered here .",
    "more precisely , the phase shift is between the vo index on one hand and indices mainly related to tio on the other hand .",
    "the phase lag between changes in the various bands which are dominated by different molecular absorption ( tio and vo ) may be explained by the fact that these bands are formed at various depths in the atmosphere .",
    "what we see is a consequence of the shocks ( created by the pulsation ) running through the atmosphere .",
    "+ important progress in nonlinear stellar pulsation models has been made in the last years ( feuchtinger & dorfi 1994 , 1996a , 1996b ; bessell et al .",
    "1996 ; yaari & tuchman 1996 ) .",
    "dynamical atmosphere models have also been successfully developed recently ( e.g.  bowen 1988 ; fleischer et al .  1992 ;",
    "hfner & dorfi 1997 ) : the effects of pulsation generated in the interiors are simulated by periodic mechanical driving at the inner boundary ( piston model ) .",
    "all these numerical simulations show that the propagation of successive shock fronts in the atmosphere creates a complex temperature , density , and velocity stratification .",
    "parts of the atmosphere are heated up while others cool down .",
    "the run of temperature is often far from the smooth decrease found in static lte models . as a consequence , during a fraction of the cycle",
    ", the vo molecular lines can still be building up strength , as e.g.  vo molecules are forming ( the vo index increases ) , while the tio lines have started to weaken ( tio indices decrease ) : a loop then appears in the corresponding colour  colour diagram .",
    "we will try to investigate this hypothesis in sect .  5 by using a set of dynamical atmosphere models to compute the colours variation during a cycle , but this requires that we are first able to well reproduce lockwood s colours for non - variable m  giants .",
    "this is the aim of the following section .",
    "the first step in any attempt to investigate the origin of the phase lag is to correctly reproduce lockwood s colours for m  giants .",
    "it is now possible thanks to important progress in the modelling of red giant atmospheres achieved in the last years ( plez et al .",
    "1992 , hereafter pbn92 ; see also the review by plez 1997 ) .",
    "we computed synthetic spectra with turbospectrum , an enhanced version of the spectrum package developed at uppsala observatory and used in previous investigations of agb stars ( e.g.  plez et al .",
    "input model atmospheres were calculated with sosmarcs ( pbn92 ) , one of the latest developments in the marcs suite of programs initiated by gustafsson et al .",
    "sosmarcs generates spherically symmetric , hydrostatic , flux constant ( convective + radiative ) models in lte .",
    "it is especially designed for cool star atmospheric conditions .",
    "it features a full opacity sampling treatment of all opacities with 10912 sampling points between 990 and 125000   .",
    "turbospectrum is based for a large part on the same ensemble of routines ( e.g.  evaluation of continuous opacities and solution of the transfer equations ) .",
    "any kind of temperature  pressure stratification may be used and the execution time is relatively short even when millions of lines are taken into account .",
    "it offers the possibility for instance to test complex profiles which can mimic pulsating atmospheres , and perform extensive calculations with various abundances and/or line lists .",
    "we included for the spectrum computations atomic line data from n to ni ( kurucz 1992 ) .",
    "we also included line lists for the tio @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 and a ",

    "the synthetic 87@xmath1104 colours are maybe also slightly above the observed ones for temperatures lower than 3300  k ( fig  7c ) .",
    "the 105@xmath1104 index appears to be the least well - modelled ( fig  7d ) , but note that its scale of variation is a factor 10 smaller than the other colours .",
    "+ discrepancies might be due to uncertainties in the :    * narrow - band filter shapes ( a gaussian shape was assumed ) and in the zero point calibration : this may imply a systematic error .",
    "it seems this is the case at least for the 105 filter ( see fig  7d ) .",
    "standard errors quoted by lockwood for 104 are @xmath53 mag .",
    "errors in our zero points are probably of the same order of magnitude .",
    "this is problematic only for 105@xmath1104 , which has a very small range of variation .",
    "* spectral types attributed by lockwood : some stars have the same spectral type whereas they exhibit rather distinct colours .",
    "furthermore , the scale of spectral subtypes ( m0 to m10 ) adopted by fluks et al .  for their spt@xmath5 relation might differ from the one used by lockwood .",
    "* laboratory measurements and calculations of lifetime as quoted by the different authors : the uncertainties are still important despite great progress made recently in the tio and vo bands calibration .",
    "furthermore , red giants naturally exhibit a spread of effective temperature , but also of stellar masses , gravities and chemical composition .",
    "figure  7 shows only a one - dimensional fit ( in @xmath5 ) : @xmath54 and @xmath48 have a non - negligible effect on colours and part of the discrepancy might also be explained by this .",
    "test calculations using models taken from the grid of plez ( 1992 ) show that two models with the same @xmath5 and luminosity but with distinct @xmath48 and @xmath54 have differences of tenths of mag for some indices ( e.g.  at 3000  k , the @xmath48=@xmath55 and @xmath54=1 model differs by @xmath56 in 78@xmath187 , @xmath57 in 78@xmath188 , 0.37 in 87@xmath1104 , and 0.042 in 105@xmath1104 from the @xmath48=0.00 and @xmath54=5 model ) .",
    "we recall that the sequence of models was computed using the ridgway et al .",
    "( 1980 ) temperature calibration , and a theoretical red - giant branch from lattanzio ( 1991 ) to relate the effective temperature and luminosity , assuming a mass of 1.5 @xmath47 .",
    "+ the effect of relative abundance changes in c and n was also checked .",
    "some spectra were recomputed with a change of @xmath58 dex in the c abundance and + 0.5 dex in the n abundance , which are typical values after dredge - up ( smith 1990 ) .",
    "the difference is less than a tenth of a magnitude in all colours at 3100k , and largest for 87@xmath1104 .",
    "+ the fit for the 105@xmath1104 index is not excellent below @xmath5 @xmath59 3100  k. however , the variation scale is less than 0.2 mag .",
    "uncertainties in the observations are of the order of 0.006 mag for the colours , according to lockwood .",
    "we suspect the flux level of our models around 1@xmath0 m to be slightly too high .",
    "this appears also when comparing them to observed spectra of m  giants .",
    "there may be a missing opacity in our computations .",
    "this will be further investigated by plez et al .",
    "( in preparation ) .",
    "note also that the points at @xmath60 3100  k consist of x  her , ep  aqr , bk  vir , rt  vir , sw  vir and rx  boo , which are all variables . in conclusion ,",
    "keeping in mind the above discussion , the agreement between the synthetic and observed colours is remarkable in fig .  7 , and provides a quite safe basis for the study of miras .",
    "now that we are confident about the line lists and our synthetic colour calculations we may try to compute them for mira stars .",
    "an examination of fig .",
    "1 readily shows that the variation of the 87@xmath1104 and 105@xmath1104 colours for miras greatly exceeds the range of static models , whereas this is not the case for 78@xmath187 and 78@xmath188 . together with the phase lag between 105@xmath1104 and the other colours",
    ", this shows that static models will not be able to reproduce the colour variations along the cycle of mira stars .",
    "s.  hfner ( 1997 ) kindly provided us with a sequence of models ( 50 in total distributed on 2 successive cycles ) with the parameters : @xmath611  @xmath47 , @xmath62  @xmath63 , @xmath64  k , @xmath65  d , and a piston velocity of 4  km.s@xmath66 .",
    "this model was already used by loidl et al .",
    "( 1997 ) to synthetize c - rich ir spectra and is similar to the models presented by hfner & dorfi ( 1997 ) except for the gas opacity which was adjusted by comparison with standard model atmospheres to give more realistic gas densities .",
    "it was computed with c / o=1.8 , which is not adapted to our o - rich objects . however , there are no suitable o - rich hydrodynamical models available , and we only want to qualitatively understand the phase lag .",
    "a likely explanation is that this phase lag arises from the difference in formation depth of the various spectral regions dominated by continuum , tio or vo bands , combined with the running temperature @xmath67 and density @xmath68 perturbations along a cycle . for the purpose of this work",
    "we may assume that the chemistry used in the computation of the hydrodynamic model is not a key issue ( especially as it is hardly reflected in the radiative transfer , treated in the grey case with a constant opacity of @xmath69 @xmath70.g@xmath66 ; the c - rich chemistry has however a strong impact on the dust formation ) .",
    "we therefore only used the @xmath67 and @xmath68 stratification of the models in @xmath71 , recomputed the chemical equilibrium with a solar composition , to derive the electronic pressure @xmath72 and an optical depth scale @xmath73 .",
    "we did not use all the 500 points of the original models but selected about 65 depth - points with an average separation of 0.2 in @xmath74 , which is sufficient for treating the radiative transfer .",
    "we slightly extrapolated the models inwards to increase the maximum @xmath73 value in order to provide a better inner boundary condition ( diffusion approximation ) , but the exact stratification deep in the model has no strong impact on the emergent spectrum . +",
    "as noted above , we surmise that the phase lag is due to a difference in the depth of formation of vo bands ( dominating at 105 ) and tio bands .",
    "a first and quick qualitative check is offered by the variation in column density of tio and vo along a pulsation cycle of the model .",
    "the column densities are obtained by calculating the chemical equilibrium at each depth point of the dynamical models and integrating the number densities radially .",
    "the column densities oscillate up and down along the cycle ( fig .",
    "the phase lag is 0.065 at minimum column density and 0.030 at maximum , the vo variation lagging behind tio s , providing a first qualitative confirmation of our hypothesis .",
    "the ratio of the column densities is about 50 , a factor 5 larger than the abundance ratio of ti and v. +    we also computed lte synthetic spectra for these models in the same fashion as for static models .",
    "the velocity fields were neglected .",
    "the resulting colours are displayed in fig .",
    "9 . to facilitate the comparison with observations we have also plotted in this figure the mean relation from fig .  1 for each colour .",
    "we have allowed for 2 shifts of the observed colours , relative to the observations .",
    "the first shift , identical for all 4 colours , is in phase ( the calculated curves are shifted by 0.08 ) .",
    "there are no _ a priori _ reasons for the zero of the phase to be the same in the observations and in the models . for the observations , we recall that the zero is defined as the maximum light in v band . in the models ,",
    "the zero is defined as the time when the piston moves outwards with its maximum velocity .",
    "we also shifted the data vertically to allow an easier comparison of the shape and amplitude of the curves .",
    "the scale on the right - hand side of the diagrams is for the observed data , the one on the left - hand side is for the synthetic colours .",
    "the agreement is surprisingly good .",
    "the minima are all reasonably well matched with the possible exception of the 87@xmath1104 index . from the calculated minima",
    "we find a phase lag of 0.09 of 105@xmath1104 relative to 78@xmath187 and 78@xmath188 in very good agreement with the value derived from observations ( 0.08 ) .",
    "we also find a slight phase lag for 87@xmath1104 of 0.04 , which is also detectable in the observations at minimum light , and due to the hybrid nature of this index .",
    "the maxima are more discrepant , especially for 78@xmath187 and 78@xmath188 , with a tendency for the synthetic colours to show a secondary minimum .",
    "we suspect this to be due to the same cause as the s - shape shown in fig .  7 by the synthetic colours of static models around 3000  k ; we believe this s - shape to be in error .",
    "it is possible that additional absorbers missing in our synthetic spectra would solve the discrepancy .",
    "a more serious problem is that the 78@xmath187 and 78@xmath188 synthetic indices are 1.5 to 2 mag too large in absolute value , although their amplitude of variation is about right . as 87@xmath1104 is of the right magnitude",
    ", it could be that this problem stems from an inadequate value of the 78 flux .",
    "a more detailed discussion is not useful given the approximations we have made .",
    "we have used _",
    "one _ specific _ c - rich _ hydrodynamical model stratification for which we have computed an _",
    "radiation transfer with an _ o - rich _ equilibrium chemistry .",
    "we have compared the result of these calculations for a unique set of model parameters to _ mean _ colour variations resulting from the average of 256 different mira stars .",
    "it is actually amazing that we get such a good agreement .",
    "but one should certainly perform the same computations for a series of models with various @xmath75 , @xmath76 , @xmath77 , @xmath78 , and check for possible variations of the phase lag , of the amplitude of variations of the various indices , etc .",
    "it would also be desirable to use o - rich models .",
    "one more limitation of our approach is that we have neglected the velocity field that shifts spectral lines differentially with depth . in this particular model",
    "the velocity of the gas is of the order of + 15 to -15 km.s@xmath66 in the line formation zone .",
    "this will spread out the opacity , block more flux between the lines and allow more photons to escape within the lines .",
    "this may solve some of the discrepancies we discussed above .",
    "using lockwood s ( 1972 ) five - colours observations of 256 o - rich miras we found evidence for the loops described by these stars in colour  colour diagrams , and a phase lag between the vo and tio indices , reflecting the shocks running through the extended stellar atmosphere .",
    "we used the best current hydrostatic and hydrodynamic model atmospheres , and line lists to compute synthetic colours for normal m  giants and miras .",
    "we found that the normal m ",
    "giant colours are rather well reproduced , at least for @xmath5 above 3100  k. missing opacity sources , non - lte , non - thermal heating , variability may all explain the worse match to observations at later spectral - types .",
    "this is worth further study , but for earlier spectral - types model atmospheres and synthetic spectra are reaching a high quantitative agreement with observations .",
    "this is very encouraging for the next ( and last ) generation of classical models in preparation in uppsala that will include even more up - to - date and more complete opacities ( plez et al .  in preparation ) .",
    "our experiments in solving lte radiative transfer in one series of hydrodynamical models ( hfner , private communication ) have worked beyond our expectations .",
    "we found approximately the right variation of the colours and the right phase lag between them .",
    "the fit is of course not perfect , and should not be .",
    "we used one specific model and the observations are an average of 256 different stars .",
    "there are many more limitations in the modelling ( e.g.  lte , no account of velocity field , ... ) , but the main point is that hydrodynamical models , equilibrium chemistry , and lte radiative transfer seem to reproduce at least some of the observed data on miras ( cf . also the work of loidl et al .",
    "1997 on ir spectra of c - rich miras )",
    ". this may be surprising at first sight .",
    "we can not just assume that equilibrium and lte prevail all through miras atmospheres .",
    "this has to be checked , and that is a heavy task .",
    "the advantage of the present approach is that it allows us to account for millions of spectral lines , carry a large number of tests ( vary chemical composition , ... ) while keeping the computation time into reasonable bounds .",
    "we could easily compute center - to - limb intensity profiles as well .",
    "we believe this work opens the prospect of calculating accurate colours and spectra for cool stars , not least long - period variables ( lpv s ) .",
    "the out - of - phase variations of the various spectral features , reflecting the propagation of perturbations ( shocks ) in the atmospheres are a very strong constraint to the models .",
    "the confrontation to spectrophotometric observations , resolving the absorption bands , along the whole cycle , will be necessary to test the models and better understand lpv s atmospheres , pulsation and mass - loss .",
    "it will also unveil limitations / inadequacies in the hypotheses made in the modelling .",
    "this would be a very useful program for a small telescope equiped with an @xmath79 spectrograph , ideally reaching wavelengths up to 1.1 micron .",
    "s.  hfner and her collaborators are warmly thanked for providing us with extensive data from one of their hydrodynamical model and for useful discussions and suggestions .",
    "s.  langhoff is acknowledged for sending us the result of his tio calculations prior to publication .",
