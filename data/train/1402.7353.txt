    "<S> the floquet sum rule can also be used to detect the s ; however , the topological protection is lost .    </S>",
    "<S> a more suitable detection setup for the quantum - dot system is obtained by coupling a probe quantum dot , @xmath4 , with a single resonant level at energy @xmath6 to one or both of the dots , as depicted in fig .  </S>",

    "<S> a potential challenge in creating this system is obtaining appreciable pairing amplitude between spin - filtered resonant levels of the two quantum dots through the superconductor bridge . for a singlet superconductor , this can be addressed in at least three ways : ( i ) by exploiting the spin - orbit interaction with a characteristic length smaller than the size of the quantum dots  @xcite ; ( ii ) by applying opposite zeeman fields on the two dots ; or ( iii ) by applying a uniform external zeeman field and field - tuning the quantum dot @xmath99-factors  @xcite to achieve opposite signs on the two dots . </S>",
    "<S> a major obstacle in the clear detection of majorana fermions is ruling out other mechanisms leading to bound state with similar spectroscopic signatures , e.g. disorder - induced andreev bound states or kondo resonances  @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> . it would be interesting to study the interplay between kondo interaction and s. in this regard , an advantage of s over the static ones is the existence of @xmath100 states that are distinct from @xmath58 states and other non - dynamical bound states and whose presence can be clearly identified in transport or tunneling experiments we have described .    to summarize , we have discussed s in a double - dot system coupled through a superconducting and subject to ac gate potentials . the driving amplitude , frequency and the ac phase difference between the dots provide a large , highly tunable set of control knobs that make it possible to observe the signatures of s in a solid - state system and to test their exotic properties . </S>",
