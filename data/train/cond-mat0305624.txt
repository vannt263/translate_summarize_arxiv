    "<S> by means of a scaling ansatz , we investigate an approximated solution of the boltzmann - vlasov equation for a classical gas . within this framework , we derive the frequencies and the damping of the collective oscillations of a harmonically trapped gas and we investigate its expansion after release of the trap . </S>",
    "<S> the method is well suited to studying the collisional effects taking place in the system and in particular to discussing the crossover between the hydrodynamic and the collisionless regimes . </S>",
    "<S> an explicit link between the relaxation times relevant for the damping of the collective oscillations and for the expansion is established .    </S>",
    "<S> the favored signature of bose - einstein condensation in weakly interacting gases is the time - of - flight expansion @xcite . in this technique </S>",
    "<S> , the asymmetric trapping potential is switched off and the evolution of the spatial density is monitored . after long time expansion , the observed inversion of the aspect ratio reflects the anisotropy of the initial confinement . in an ideal bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) , this effect is a direct consequence of the heisenberg uncertainty constraint on the condensate wave function . for an interacting bec , </S>",
    "<S> the inversion is also produced by the anisotropy of the pressure gradients caused by the hydrodynamic forces . </S>",
    "<S> the changes in the shape of the expanding gas can be characterized by scaling factors , which provide an easy quantitative tool for the analysis of on - going bec experiments . </S>",
    "<S> the set of equations for those factors have been derived in many papers @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a similar effect has also been predicted for a fermi gas in its superfluid phase @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> strong anisotropy has been recently measured in the expansion of a highly degenerate fermi gas @xcite close to a feshbach resonance . </S>",
    "<S> resonance scattering can also give rise to anisotropic expansion in the normal phase as proven in the experiments of @xcite carried out in a less degenerate regime . </S>",
    "<S> some recent experiments on bosonic atoms above the critical temperature have also reached the collisional regime investigating both the oscillations of the low lying quadrupole mode and the expansion in asymmetric traps @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> so far analytic calculations for the expansion of a classical gas have been limited to either the ballistic or to the hydrodynamic regime @xcite . as a consequence , </S>",
    "<S> it is important to generalize such calculations to all intermediate collisional regimes . </S>",
    "<S> this is precisely the main purpose of this paper . </S>",
    "<S> we begin by an outline of the theoretical description of the thermal gas based on the boltzmann - vlasov equation . </S>",
    "<S> our approach relies on an approximated solution to this equation by means of a scaling ansatz . </S>",
    "<S> this solution is used throughout the paper to investigate two kinds of related problems : the lowest collective oscillation modes and the time - of - flight expansion when the confinement is released .    </S>",

    "<S> interparticle interactions enter eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ bv ] ) in two different ways @xcite . on the one hand </S>",
    "<S> , they modify the effective potential through the mean field term @xmath4 which affects the streaming part of the boltzmann kinetic equation . </S>",
    "<S> the mean field potential @xmath4 is equal to @xmath5 for bosons and @xmath6 for two fermion species @xcite , where the coupling constant @xmath7 is fixed by the @xmath8-wave scattering length @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> the mean field term is linear in @xmath9 and is non dissipative . on the other hand </S>",
    "<S> , two body interaction determines the collision integral @xmath10 $ ] which is quadratic in the scattering length , and describes dissipative processes . </S>",
    "<S> eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ bv ] ) is valid in the semi - classical limit , namely when the thermal energy is large compared with the separation between the energy eigenvalues of the potential @xcite .    in this paper </S>",
    "<S> , we will treat the collision integral within the relaxation time approximation . </S>",
    "<S> this model should suffice to capture the essential physics of the problem . </S>",
    "<S> we consequently write : @xmath11\\approx-\\frac{f - f_{\\rm le}}{\\tau},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath12 is the relaxation time related to the average time between collisions , and @xmath13 is the local equilibrium density in phase space . as a consequence , @xmath13 has a spherical symmetry in velocity space , _ i.e. _ it depends on the velocity through @xmath14 ^ 2 $ ] where @xmath15 is the local velocity field .    the dynamics of the gas will be described by the following scaling ansatz for the non equilibrium distribution function : @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the equilibrium distribution function which satisfies the equation ( @xmath18=0 $ ] ) : @xmath19 the dependence on time of @xmath20 is contained in the dimensionless scaling parameters @xmath21 and @xmath22 . </S>",
    "<S> the parameter @xmath21 gives the dilatation along the @xmath23 direction , while @xmath22 gives the effective temperature in the same direction . </S>",
    "<S> such an ansatz generalizes the one used in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we recall that in this method the shape of the cloud does not explicitly enter the equations . </S>",
    "<S> this is the reason why the solutions are equally valid for a dilute bose gas above the critical temperature , a dilute fermi gas in its normal phase , and a classical gas .    following ref . </S>",

    "<S> the parameter @xmath28 is expected to be small for dilute gases ( @xmath29 ) since the ratio @xmath30 scales as @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is the de broglie wavelength and @xmath33 the mean density @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> the collisionless regime is obtained by taking @xmath34 . in this limit </S>",
    "<S> , we have the simple relation @xmath35 between the scaling parameters , and we recover the equations derived in @xcite . in the opposite limit ( hydrodynamic regime ) , local equilibrium is always ensured because of the high collision rate . as a consequence , we have @xmath36 and the eqs ( [ s1 ] ) and ( [ s2 ] ) can be recast in the form : @xmath37 for @xmath38 ( no mean field ) , we recover the equations first derived in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> note that in both the collisionless and the hydrodynamic regimes , the collisional term does not contribute since there is no dissipation in these limits . </S>",
    "<S> we next focus our attention on the intermediate regimes where the collision term enters explicitly the equations of motion .    </S>",
    "<S> let us first study the breathing mode in the case of spherical harmonic trapping with angular frequency @xmath39 . in this case </S>",
    "<S> , we find a solution with @xmath40 and @xmath41 . </S>",
    "<S> for such a solution the collision term identically vanishes in all intermediate collisional regimes </S>",
    "<S> . our approach can be readily generalized to lower dimensions leading to the frequency @xmath42 for the monopole mode @xcite , where @xmath43 is the dimension of space . in two dimensions </S>",
    "<S> the mean field does not affect the frequency of the monopole . </S>",
    "<S> this comes out from the fact that in this case the ansatz is an exact solution of the bv equations , as already stressed in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> we now consider a sample of atoms confined in a three - dimensional cylindrically symmetric harmonic potential . </S>",
    "<S> we denote by @xmath44 the ratio between the axial and radial angular frequencies . </S>",
    "<S> expanding eqs . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ s1 ] ) and ( [ s2 ] ) around equilibrium ( @xmath45 ) we get a linear and closed set of equations which can be solved by looking for solutions of the type @xmath46 . </S>",

    "<S> the solution of eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ disp ] ) interpolates the frequencies of the low lying modes for all collisional regimes ranging from the collisionless to the hydrodynamic . as the confinement is cylindrically symmetric around the @xmath54 axis , we can label the modes by their angular azimuthal number @xmath55 . </S>",
    "<S> the first factor of the l.h.s . of eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ disp ] ) gives the frequencies of the two @xmath56 modes , while the second factor gives that of the quadrupole ( @xmath57 ) mode . </S>",
    "<S> the roots of @xmath58 and @xmath59 have already been obtained in @xcite , and correspond to the frequencies of the low lying modes of a collisionless gas in presence of mean field . </S>",
    "<S> eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ disp ] ) for @xmath38 has been derived in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite and the corresponding frequencies have been investigated experimentally @xcite . for @xmath60 , corresponding to @xmath61 , we find @xmath62 , @xmath63 , and the frequencies coincide with the ones predicted for a bose - einstein condensate in the thomas - fermi regime @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> so far , we have not given the explicit link between the relaxation time entering eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ disp ] ) and the collision rate . </S>",
    "<S> following ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , we can establish this link for a classical gas by means of a gaussian ansatz for the equilibrium distribution function @xmath64 . </S>",
    "<S> one obtains @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the classical collision rate where @xmath67 is the thermal velocity , @xmath68 is the peak density and @xmath69 is the cross section which is assumed to be velocity independent . for bosons </S>",
    "<S> the link between the scattering length and the cross section is @xmath70 whereas for two fermions species one has @xmath71 .    </S>",
    "<S> we now establish the set of equations that describe the time - of - flight expansion . in the collisionless regime where the mean free path </S>",
    "<S> is very large with respect to the size of the trapped cloud and in the absence of mean field contribution , we readily obtain the exact equations @xmath72 which admit the solutions @xmath73 , leading to isotropic density and velocity distributions after long time expansion .    </S>",
    "<S> when the effect of collisions is important the physics of the expansion changes dramatically . as an example , the radial directions of a cigar - shaped cloud expand faster than the longitudinal one finally resulting in an anisotropic velocity distribution . </S>",
    "<S> so far , an analytic approach has been proposed only in the full hydrodynamic regime @xcite . however </S>",
    "<S> , this approach assumes that the hydrodynamic equations are always valid during the expansion . in general </S>",
    "<S> , this can not be the case since the density decreases during the expansion reducing the effect of collisions . </S>",
    "<S> alternatively , the expansion of an interacting bose above @xmath74 gas has been investigated by means of a monte carlo simulation @xcite .    in our approach </S>",
    "<S> , we provide an interpolation between the two opposite collisionless and hydrodynamic regimes using the scaling formalism . </S>",
    "<S> the decrease of the collision rate during the expansion yields a non constant relaxation time @xmath75 that depends explicitly on the scaling parameters and reflects the changes of the density and the temperature during the expansion . as a result </S>",
    "<S> , the expansion is described by the following set of 6 non - linear equations @xmath76 the dependence of the relaxation time @xmath12 on the scaling parameters is obtained by noticing that the collision rate @xmath77 scales as @xmath78 . using the scaling transformation @xmath79 and @xmath80 , where @xmath81 and @xmath82 are the initial density and temperature respectively , we deduce @xmath83 where @xmath52 is the average time of collision at equilibrium @xcite . since both the results ( [ disp ] ) for the dispersion of the linear oscillations and eqs . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ expan ] ) and ( [ tauexp ] ) for the expansion have been derived starting from the same scaling equations ( [ s1 ] ) and ( [ s2 ] ) the relaxation time @xmath52 entering the two processes is the same . as a consequence , </S>",
    "<S> the combined investigation of the expansion and of the quadrupole oscillations can provide a useful check of the consistency of the approach and , possibly , useful constraints on the value of the cross section . </S>",
    "<S> the time evolution of the aspect ratio @xmath84 in the absence of mean field is depicted on fig . 1 for different values of the product @xmath85 and for an initial aspect ratio @xmath86 . </S>",
    "<S> in the collisionless regime ( @xmath34 ) , the aspect ratio tends asymptotically to unity reflecting the isotropy of the initial velocity distribution . for other collisional regimes , </S>",
    "<S> the asymptotic aspect ratio is larger that one as a consequence of collisions during the expansion . </S>",
    "<S> we find a continuous transition from the collisionless to the hydrodynamic prediction as we decrease @xmath52 from infinity to zero . </S>",
    "<S> we then conclude that in general the expansion can not be described with either the hydrodynamic or the collisionless prediction @xcite , but requires a full solution of our equations ( [ expan ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> similar conditions have been already encountered experimentally for classical or almost classical gases @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we also notice that it is very important to take into account the time dependence of the relaxation time , accounted for by the scaling law ( [ tauexp ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> for example by simply using @xmath87 during the whole expansion , the curve @xmath88 of fig . 1 ( solid line ) would be shifted upward and the resulting prediction would result much closer to the hydrodynamic curve ( dotted line ) .    </S>",
    "<S> _ aspect ratio as a function of the normalized time @xmath89 for different collisional regimes ( initial aspect ratio @xmath86 ) : collisionless ( dashed line , @xmath90 ) , intermediate collisional regime ( solid line , @xmath91 ) , hydrodynamic regime ( dotted line , @xmath92 ) . </S>",
    "<S> _    [ fig1 ]    let us finally comment on the effect of quantum statistics on the calculation of the relaxation time . </S>",
    "<S> for a bose gas at temperature above @xmath74 the problem has been investigated in @xcite where it has been shown that statistical effects do not play a significant role . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , the relaxation time in a harmonically trapped dilute fermi gases has been shown to be strongly affected by pauli blocking at low temperature @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the effects of collisions in a strongly interacting fermi gas , including the unitarity limit , have been recently addressed in @xcite . </S>"
