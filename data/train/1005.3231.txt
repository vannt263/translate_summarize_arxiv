    "we study the moments of the wigner random matrices that are obtained from ( 1.1 ) by the standard truncation procedure .",

    "random variables such that ( 1.2 ) holds and consider truncation of @xmath25 .",
    "since the pioneering works of e. wigner @xcite , one extensively uses the natural representation of the averaged moments of ( 1.1 ) as the sum over a family of closed paths of @xmath26 steps .",
    "more precisely , one can write equality @xmath27 where @xmath28 , @xmath29 is the set of all even closed trajectories @xmath30 over the set @xmath31 and @xmath32 is the weight given by the mathematical expectation of the product of @xmath10 s that corresponds to @xmath30 , @xmath33 the trajectory @xmath30 can be viewed as an @xmath34-realization of an even closed walk such that in the corresponding multigraph @xmath35 each couple of vertices is joined by even number @xmath36 of edges , @xmath37 and the total number of edges is @xmath26 . for the rigorous definitions of trajectories , walks and their graphs see @xcite .",

    "we prove that if the probability distribution of @xmath10 is such that @xmath46 does not exist , then for any truncation @xmath47 needed in the standard proof of ( 1.4 ) , the moments of the corresponding truncated wigner random matrices diverge in the asymptotic regime of ( 1.5 ) . to show this",
    ", we construct the family @xmath48 of even closed walks @xmath49 such that the weighted sum over the trajectories @xmath30 from the corresponding equivalence classes @xmath50 @xmath51 diverges .",
    "this outcome means that the condition @xmath52 is hard to be avoided in the simultaneous proof of ( 1.4 ) and ( 1.5 ) in the frameworks of the approach of @xcite",
    ".    0.3 cm    being focused on the combinatorial part of the construction of @xmath4 , we do not pay much attention to the generality of our results with respect to the probability distribution @xmath53 of @xmath10 and consider one of the simplest cases given by the probability density @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the normalization constant and @xmath56 is a bounded even positive monotone decreasing function such that @xmath57 for all @xmath58 .",
    "0.1 cm our main result is as follows .",

    "_    0.1 cm    let us complete this section by the following comments . by itself , does not imply the necessity of the twelfth moment for the bound ( 1.5 ) .",
    "however , one can see that in many cases the truncation @xmath64 combined with the reasoning based on the borel - cantelli lemma leads to the optimal conditions for the moments of @xmath10 ( see the papers @xcite and @xcite for the necessary and sufficient conditions for the semicircle law to be valid ; see @xcite for the convergence of the spectral norm ) .",
    "therefore in view of theorem 1 , it is natural to put forward a hypothesis that the bound @xmath65 represents the necessary condition for the existence of the upper bound ( 1.5 ) . at the end of the present paper ,",
    "we discuss the optimal conditions on @xmath10 in asymptotic regimes different from that of ( 1.5 ) .    finally , let us note that the bound ( 1.5 ) and its proof play the central role in the demonstration of the universality of the edge spectral distribution of large wigner random matrices @xcite",
    ". thus one can relate our results with the necessary and sufficient conditions of the spectral universality in the spectral theory of random matrices .",
    "let us briefly explain the structure of the elements @xmath66 of ( 1.6 ) which is based on a fairly simple principle .",
    "we assume that each walk @xmath49 consists of two parts ; during the first half - part it creates a vertex @xmath67 of high self - intersection degree , where @xmath68 edges of multiplicity @xmath69 meet each other . on its second part , the walk @xmath49 enters @xmath67 and then performs a sequence of `` there - and - back '' trips along the multiple edges .",
    "the vanishingly small proportion of the half - part trajectories with @xmath67 of this kind is compensated by the large number of choices where to go by these there - and - back steps form the second half - part .",
    "the cardinality of trajectories of this structure is such that it is impossible to get a finite upper bound for the sub - sum ( 1.6 ) with @xmath70 , @xmath9 .",
    "let us split the time interval @xmath72 $ ] into two parts , the @xmath73-part containing @xmath74 steps and the @xmath75-part containing @xmath76 steps with obvious equality        the chronological order is as follows : the first @xmath77 steps belong to the @xmath73-part ; these are followed by @xmath76 steps of the @xmath75-part and the final step @xmath78 $ ] is attributed again to the @xmath73-part .",
    "we determine in a natural way the sub - walks that correspond to the @xmath73- and @xmath75-parts of @xmath79 and denote them by @xmath80 and @xmath81 , respectively .",
    "we also consider the first @xmath82 steps as the @xmath83-part of the walk ( see figure 1 ) .      regarding the @xmath83-part",
    ", one can create a catalan structure by attributing to the @xmath82 steps @xmath84 signs @xmath85 and @xmath84 signs @xmath86 @xcite .",
    "following @xcite , we will say that each step labelled by @xmath87 is marked , the remaining steps being the non - marked ones .",
    "the catalan structure is in one - to - one correspondence with the set @xmath88 of plane rooted trees @xmath89 constructed with the help of @xmath84 edges or equivalently , with the set of the dyck paths @xcite .",
    "this correspondence can be determined by the lexicographic ( or in other words , by the chronological ) run over the element @xmath90 that produces also a dyck path . in this representation ,",
    "the signs @xmath87 and @xmath91 correspond to the ascending and the descending steps of the dyck path , respectively .",
    "it is known that the cardinality of @xmath88 is given by the catalan number , @xmath92 in our construction , we are mainly related with a subset @xmath93 of catalan structures on @xmath83-part such that the majority of vertices of the corresponding trees have the degree @xmath94 with @xmath95 children edges . to describe this subset",

    "we want these edges to be such that for any couple @xmath133 and @xmath134 , the distance between their vertices in @xmath135 is not less than 3 .",
    "it is easy to see that the number of possible choices is estimated from below by @xmath136    let us denote by @xmath137 the instants of time that correspond to the edges @xmath134 , @xmath138 in @xmath132 .",
    "let us denote by @xmath139 , @xmath140 the marked instants of time that correspond to the supplementary edges of @xmath132 that follow after that @xmath134 is passed for the second time .",
    "with particular values of @xmath141 pointed out , we force the walk to join the same vertex @xmath142 at the instants of time @xmath143 .",
    "also we oblige the walk to join @xmath67 at the instants of time @xmath139 .",
    "then we get a walk that has a vertex of the self - intersection degree @xmath144 ; there are @xmath68 distinct vertices @xmath145 such that the edge @xmath146 is passed 10 times by @xmath79 when counted in both directions .",
    "0.3 cm the last stage is to create @xmath147 simple self - intersections with the help of @xmath148 marked steps not used before .",

    "the @xmath83-part of the walk being constructed , we attribute the sing @xmath87 to the step @xmath151 $ ] ; the prescription is such that @xmath152 .",
    "it is clear that @xmath153 and therefore the step @xmath154 $ ] produces the edge @xmath155 .",
    "the last step of the @xmath73-part @xmath78 $ ] is non - marked ; it returns the walk from @xmath67 to the root vertex @xmath156 .",
    "we see that the walk @xmath79 at the instant @xmath157 enters the vertex @xmath67 that belongs to the family of multiple edges @xmath158 , where @xmath159 , each edge being passed by the walk @xmath160 times .",

    "therefore given @xmath181 and assigning different values from the set @xmath182 to the vertices of @xmath79 , we get the equivalence class of trajectories @xmath183 of the cardinality @xmath184 taking into account the factor @xmath185 , we can write that @xmath186 @xmath187 indeed , since we are related with the asymptotic regime @xmath188 , we can write that @xmath189 @xmath190 then , taking into account equality @xmath191 , we get ( 2.8 )",
    ".    0.3 cm regarding the weights of the trajectories , we observe that if @xmath192 and @xmath193 belong to the same equivalence class @xmath183 , then @xmath194 each edge @xmath195 of the frame @xmath115 represents a random variable @xmath196 and these random variables are jointly independent .",
    "each edge of the frame being passed in both directions by equal number @xmath197 of times , we get the factor @xmath198 with no difference between the cases of hermitian random matrices @xmath1 and the real symmetric @xmath1 .",
    "if the edge @xmath195 does not belong to @xmath199 , then it produces either the factor @xmath200 or the factor @xmath201 . taking into account that @xmath202 for large values of @xmath34 ,",
