    "many of the nuclear properties are explored through the interaction with an electromagnetic field .",
    "the electric and magnetic components of the field are used to unveil some properties of electric and magnetic nature , respectively . as good examples on this line",
    "are the scissors like states @xcite and the spin - flip excitations @xcite which were widely treated by various groups .",
    "the scissors mode is associated to the angular oscillation of the proton against the neutron system with a total strength proportional to the nuclear deformation squared , which confirms the collective character of the excitation @xcite .    due to this feature",
    "it was believed that the magnetic collective properties , in general , show up in deformed systems . however , this is not supported experimentally , since there are the magnetic dipole bands have been observed often in spherical nuclei .",
    "indeed , there exists experimental evidence for the magnetic bands in nearly spherical nuclei where the ratio between the moment of inertia and the b(e2 ) value for exciting the first @xmath8 from the @xmath9 ground state , @xmath10 , takes large values , of the order of 100(eb)@xmath11 @xcite .",
    "these large values can be consistently explained by large transverse magnetic dipole moments which induce dipole magnetic transitions , but negligible charge quadrupole moments @xcite .",
    "indeed , there are several experimental data sets showing that the dipole bands have large values for @xmath12 , and very small values of @xmath13 ( see for example ref .",
    "the states are different from the scissors like ones , exhibiting instead a shears character .",
    "a system with a large transverse magnetic dipole moment may also consist of a triaxial core to which a proton particle and a neutron hole are coupled .",
    "the maximal transverse dipole momentum is achieved when , for example , @xmath14 is oriented along the short axis of the core and @xmath15 along the long axis of the core which rotates around the intermediate axis .",
    "suppose that the three orthogonal angular momenta form a right - handed frame .",
    "if the hamiltonian describing the interacting system of protons , neutrons and the triaxial core is invariant to the transformation which changes the orientation of one of the three angular momenta , i.e. the right - handed reference frame is transformed to one of a left - handed one , the system exhibits a chiral symmetry .",
    "as always happens , such a symmetry is identified when it is broken and consequently for the two reference frames the system acquires distinct energies , otherwise close to each other .",
    "thus , a signature for a chiral symmetry characterizing a triaxial system is the existence of two @xmath16 bands which are close in energy . by increasing the total angular momentum ,",
    "the gradual alignment of @xmath14 and @xmath15 to the total @xmath17 takes place and a magnetic band is developed @xcite .    in refs .",
    "@xcite we attempted to investigate another chiral system consisting of one phenomenological core with two components , one for protons and one for neutrons , and two quasiparticles whose total angular momentum @xmath18 is oriented along the symmetry axis of the core , due to the particle - core interaction . in the quoted references we proved that states of total angular momentum @xmath19 , where the three components mentioned above carry the angular momenta @xmath20 which are mutually orthogonal , do exist .",
    "such a configuration seems to be optimal for defining a large transverse magnetic moment that induces large m1 transitions . in choosing the candidate nuclei with chiral features",
    ", we were guided by the suggestion @xcite that triaxial nuclei may favor orthogonality of the aforementioned three angular momenta and therefore may exhibit a large transverse magnetic moment . in the previous publications ,",
    "the formalism was applied to @xmath21pt , @xmath22os and @xmath23os , which satisfy the triaxiality signature condition @xcite .    here",
    "we amend the hamiltonian used in the previous publications by two particle - core terms with the specific feature that the core factors are anharmonic in the quadrupole bosons and have the tensor properties of a quadrupole and hexadecapole operators , respectively .",
    "correspondingly , the other factors are quasiparticle number conserving terms of quadrupole and hexadecapole type .",
    "the model hamiltonian is treated in a restricted space consisting of the projected states of the core describing six collective bands and of a subspace of states spanned by two quasiparticles with the total angular momentum @xmath24 aligned along the symmetry axis , which are coupled with the states of the ground band to a total angular momentum larger or equal to @xmath24 .",
    "the chiral properties are studied with the @xmath25 ground band states . alternatively , like in refs .",
    "@xcite , we chose another @xmath25 subspace by changing the ground band states with those of the magnetic dipole band @xmath26 .",
    "the formalism is applied to @xmath7nd for which some relevant data are available @xcite .",
    "the work sketched above is developed according to the following plan . in section 2",
    "we briefly present the main ingredients of the generalized coherent state model ( gcsm ) which was used to describe the states of the core .",
    "the hamiltonian describing the particle - core interaction is presented in section 3 .",
    "the composition of the core and @xmath25 states is analyzed in sections 4 and 5 .",
    "one identifies states of the @xmath25 subspace where the proton @xmath27 , neutron @xmath28 and fermion @xmath29 angular momenta are mutually orthogonal , which is a prerequisite of a large transverse dipole momentum .",
    "numerical results for the specific case of @xmath7nd are discussed in section 6 , while section 7 is devoted to the final conclusions .",
    "the core is described by the gcsm @xcite , which is an extension of the coherent state model ( csm ) @xcite for a composite system of protons and neutrons .",
    "the main ideas underlying the csm are as follows .",
    "the usual procedure used to describe the excitation energies with a given boson hamiltonian is to diagonalize it and fix the structure coefficients such that some particular energy levels be reproduced . for a given angular momentum ,",
    "the lowest levels belong to the ground , gamma and beta bands , respectively . for example",
    ", the lowest state of angular momentum 2 , i.e. @xmath30 , is a ground band state , the next lowest , @xmath31 , is a gamma band state , while @xmath32 belongs to the @xmath33 band .",
    "the dominant components of the corresponding eigenstates are one , two and three phonon states .",
    "the harmonic limit of the model hamiltonian yields a multi - phonon spectrum , while by switching on a deforming anharmonicity , the spectrum is a reunion of rotational bands .",
    "the correspondence of the two kinds of spectra , characterizing the vibrational and rotational regimes respectively , is realized according to the sheline - sakai scheme @xcite . in the near vibrational limit",
    "a certain staggering is observed for the @xmath34 band , while in the rotational extreme , the staggering is different .",
    "the bands are characterized by the quantum number @xmath35 which for the axially symmetric nuclei is 0 for the ground and @xmath36 bands , and equal to 2 for @xmath34 band .",
    "the specific property of a band structure consists of that the e2 transition probabilities within a band is much larger that the ones connecting two different bands . for @xmath34 stable nuclei ,",
    "the energies of the states heading the @xmath34 and @xmath36 bands are ordered as @xmath37 while for @xmath34 unstable nuclei the ordering is reversed .",
    "a third class of nuclei exists where @xmath38 , @xmath24-even .",
    "_ these are the fundamental features which should be described by the wave functions of any realistic approach_. csm builds a restricted basis requiring that the states are orthogonal before and after angular momentum projection and , moreover , accounts for the properties enumerated above . if such a construction is possible , then one attempts to define an effective hamiltonian which is quasi - diagonal in the selected basis .",
    "the csm is , as a matter of fact , a possible solution in terms of quadrupole bosons @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the csm , within the gcsm @xcite the protons are described by quadrupole proton - like bosons , @xmath39 , while the neutrons by quadrupole neutron - like bosons , @xmath40 . since one deals with two quadrupole bosons instead of one ,",
    "one expects to have a more flexible model and to find a simpler solution satisfying the restrictions required by csm .",
    "the restricted collective space is defined by the states describing the three major bands - ground , beta and gamma- as well as the band based on the isovector state @xmath26 .",
    "orthogonality conditions , required for both intrinsic and projected states , are satisfied by the following 6 functions which generate , by angular momentum projection , 6 rotational bands : @xmath41|0\\rangle .",
    "\\label{figcsm}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here , the following notations have been used : @xmath42 @xmath43 with @xmath44 , involved in the wave functions , are normalization factors calculated in terms of some overlap integrals .",
    "note that for the gamma band there are two candidates which satisfy the requirements of the csm .",
    "one function is symmetric , while the other one is asymmetric with respect to the proton - neutron permutation . in refs .",
    "[ 9,12 ] we used alternatively the two versions for the gamma band and we found out that for some nuclei the fitting procedure yielded a better description of the data both for energies and b(e2 ) values , when the the choice of the asymmetric function was made . in ref . [ 9 ] it was proved that the asymmetric gamma states can be excited from the ground state by the asymmetric component of the electric quadrupole transition operator .",
    "the possibility of having two distinct phases for the collective motion in the gamma band has been also considered in ref .",
    "[ 18 ] within a different formalism .",
    "we do nt claim however that this is a general feature for the gamma band , but that for some nuclei the properties specific for asymmetric state may prevail over those characterizing the symmetric gamma states . on the other hand some experiments like @xmath45 scattering support the isoscalar structure of the gamma - band states although even this result is not proved to be in general true .",
    "for that reason , in this paper we choose the option of symmetric gamma states .",
    "following the csm criteria , for the dipole bands we have also two candidate functions , @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "in ref . [ 9 ] the asymptotic behavior of both states has been considered in the intrinsic reference frame .",
    "the important results which came out are : a ) the first state is a generalization of the wave functions used by the two rotor [ 1 ] and two liquid drops [ 17 ] models ; b ) the first state corresponds to a lower excitation energy than the second state .",
    "these two properties induced us us to use @xmath46 as model states for the dipole bands studied in the present work .",
    "all calculations performed so far considered equal deformations for protons and neutrons .",
    "the deformation parameter for the composite system is : @xmath48    the projected states defined by eq .",
    "( 2.1 ) describe the essential nuclear properties in the limiting cases the spherical and well deformed systems : a ) they describe degenerate multiphonon states for the vibrational regime , while for large deformation they are identical with the liquid drop prediction in the strong coupling regime .",
    "the connection between the two mentioned extreme regimes is achieved by smoothly varying the parameter @xmath49 which simulates the nuclear deformation ; b ) they are mutually orthogonal before and after angular momentum projection and because of that they might be an useful basis set for studying the quadrupole boson hamiltonian ; c ) written in the intrinsic reference frame the projected states are combinations of different @xmath35 components .",
    "the dominant components of the function superpositions have @xmath50 for the ground and beta bands , @xmath51 for the gamma bands and k=1 for the dipole bands .",
    "actually this feature represents a strong support for the band assignments to the model projected states ; d ) usually the collective models start with a boson hamiltonian including anharmonic terms , which is to be diagonalized in a suitable basis for a set of phenomenological parameters which are fixed by fitting some experimental data . despite the difficulties which might be encountered due to the tedious diagonalization process",
    ", the structure of the resulting wave function is simple .",
    "the first state @xmath8 is described by a function which has the one - phonon component with a dominant weight , the second @xmath8 by a wave function with the dominant component the two - boson state , etc .",
    "note that our basis exhibits this property and due to this fact it may be considered as obtained by diagonalizing a complex hamiltonian . by contrast to the above mentioned procedure , the wave functions considered here are infinite series of bosons which results in accounting for high anharmonicity .    according to the",
    "above mentioned salient features of the projected states basis , it is desirable to find a boson hamiltonian which is effective in that basis , i.e. to be quasi - diagonal .",
    "besides of this restriction , we require to be of the fourth order in bosons and constructed with the rotation invariants of lowest order in bosons .",
    "since the basis contains both symmetric and asymmetric states with respect to the proton - neutron ( p - n ) permutation and these are to be approximate eigenstates of the effective hamiltonian , this should be symmetric against the p - n permutation .",
    "therefore , we seek an effective hamiltonian for which the projected states ( [ figcsm ] ) are , at least in a good approximation , eigenstates in the restricted collective space .",
    "the simplest hamiltonian fulfilling this condition is : @xmath52 with @xmath53 denoting the proton and neutron total angular momentum .",
    "the hamiltonian given by eq .",
    "( [ hgcsm ] ) has only one off - diagonal matrix element in the basis ( [ figcsm ] ) . that is @xmath54",
    "however , our calculations show that this affects the energies of @xmath36 and @xmath55 bands by an amount of a few kev",
    ". therefore , the excitation energies of the six bands are in a good approximation , given by the diagonal element : @xmath56 the analytical behavior of energies and wave functions in the extreme limits of vibrational and rotational regimes have been studied in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "since the hamiltonian is a linear superposition of the @xmath57 spin algebra generators : @xmath58 it is manifestly that @xmath59 is not @xmath57-spin invariant , e.g. , @xmath60\\ne 0 $ ] , for @xmath61 consequently , the eigenstates of @xmath59 are @xmath62 mixed states .",
    "however , one can easily check that the expected value of @xmath62 corresponding to the projected model states is equal to zero .",
    "it is worth to remark that the proposed phenomenological boson hamiltonian has a microscopic counterpart obtained through the boson expansion procedure from a many body hamiltonian for a proton and neutron interacting system . in that case",
    "the structure coefficients @xmath63 would be analytically expressed in terms of the one- and a two - body interactions matrix elements .",
    "a detailed review of the results obtained with the csm and gcsm is presented in the recently published book of one of the present authors @xcite .",
    "we note that @xmath64 comprises a term which is not invariant to the change the sign of either @xmath65 or @xmath65 . for what follows",
    "it is useful to write @xmath64 in the form :    @xmath66",
    "the particle - core interacting system is described by the following hamiltonian : @xmath67 \\label{modelh}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with the notation for the particle multipole operators : @xmath68 the core is described by @xmath64 , while the particle system by the next two terms standing for a spherical shell model mean - field and pairing interaction of the alike nucleons , respectively .",
    "the notation @xmath69 is used for the spherical shell model states .",
    "the last three terms , denoted hereafter as @xmath70 , express the interaction between the satellite particles and the core .",
    "the interaction consists of a quadrupole - quadrupole @xmath71 , a spin - spin @xmath72 and an anharmonic @xmath73 pole , with j=2 and 4 , denoted by @xmath74 force , respectively , @xmath75 being the anharmonic boson factors which are tensors of rank j. the angular momenta carried by the core and particles are denoted by @xmath76 and @xmath77 , respectively .",
    "note that the anharmonic coupling terms are specific to the present paper .",
    "the strengths of these interactions denoted by @xmath78 ( with j=2,4 ) and @xmath79 are free parameters .    the mean field plus",
    "the pairing term is quasi - diagonalized by means of the bogoliubov - valatin transformation .",
    "the free quasiparticle term is @xmath80 , while the @xmath71 and @xmath81 interaction preserve the above mentioned form , with the factors @xmath82 and @xmath83 changed to : @xmath84 the notation @xmath85 @xmath86 is used for the quasiparticle creation ( annihilation ) operator .",
    "we restrict the single - particle space to a proton single-@xmath87 state . in the space of the particle - core states we , therefore , consider the basis defined by : @xmath88_{im } , \\label{basis1}\\\\    \\psi^{(2qp;j1)}_{ji;m}&=&n^{(2qp;j1)}_{ji}\\sum_{j'=even}c^{j\\;j'\\;i}_{j\\;1\\;j+1}\\left(n^{(1)}_{j'}\\right)^{-1}\\left[(a^{\\dag}_ja^{\\dag}_j)_j|bcs\\rangle\\otimes|1;j'\\rangle \\right]_{im}. \\label{basis2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath89 denotes the quasiparticle vacuum , while @xmath90 and @xmath91 are the projected state norms .    _",
    "why these bases states are favored in describing the chiral properties of some nuclei ? _ the states describing the core might be any of the eigenstates of @xmath64 .",
    "the lowest bands are energetically preferred and thus a good candidate is the ground - state band . on the other hand , in ref . @xcite it was shown that the states of the isovector dipole band are also good candidates since the core contribution to the @xmath92 transitions would be substantial . since the basis ( [ basis2 ] ) was described in detail in refs .",
    "@xcite , we restrict our presentation to the basis ( [ basis1 ] ) .    according to the definition ( 2.1 ) the unprojected ground state is a product of two coherent states associated to the proton and neutron systems , respectively .",
    "the angular momentum projected component from each factor state is a @xmath50 function , i.e , in the intrinsic coordinates system the @xmath50 component of the wave function prevails over the other ones .",
    "therefore , the angular momenta carried by protons and neutrons are lying in a plane perpendicular on the intrinsic symmetry axis . in the state",
    "@xmath9 belonging to the ground band of the core , the two angular momenta are anti - aligned .",
    "when the angular momentum of the core increases the proton and neutron angular momenta tend to align to each other , their relative angle gradually decreases and finally vanishes for high total angular momentum . we recognize a shears - like motion of the proton and neutron angular momenta of the core . on the path to the mentioned limit the angle reaches the value of @xmath93 , which is necessary to have an optimal configuration for the magnetic dipole transition . on the other hand",
    "if the two quasiparticle state has a maximum projection of the angular momentum on the @xmath94 axis , which is chosen to coincide with the symmetry axis , the total quasiparticle angular momentum is perpendicular to each of the core angular momentum , realsizing , thus , the dynamical chiral symmetry . in ref",
    "@xcite , the calculations were performed for @xmath95 with @xmath96 .",
    "the result was that @xmath97 yields the maximal magnetic dipole transition probabilities .",
    "the orientation of the quasiparticle angular momenta is specific to the hole - like protons since the corresponding wave function overlap with the density distribution is maximal .",
    "actually , the @xmath71 interaction favors the motion of particles on orbits close to the equator of the density ellipsoid .",
    "it is noteworthy to make a degression concerning the particle - core subspace .",
    "we have proved in several publications that projecting the angular momentum from a spherical shell - model state of maximum @xmath98-projection times the unprojected ground - state , one can define a basis for the particle - core space which , moreover , can be also used as a single particle basis @xcite .",
    "the same arguments work for the space of two particles - core states in the laboratory frame .",
    "this basis has the advantage of having @xmath97 as the dominant component which is suitable for the description of large m1 transitions .    in conclusion",
    ", this basis is optimal in order to describe a composite system which rotates around an axis not situated in any principal planes of the density distribution ellipsoid .",
    "it is known that in the nuclei of the a=130 - 140 mass region , which are @xmath34-soft , the valence protons occupy the lower half of the @xmath99 orbital driving the nucleus to a prolate shape ( @xmath100 ) , while the valence neutrons occupy the upper half of the @xmath99 orbital , which favors an oblate shape ( @xmath101 ) .",
    "one expects , therefore , coexisting prolate and oblate minima for the potential energy . for nuclei with @xmath102",
    "the @xmath99[505]9/2 and @xmath99[505]11/2 orbitals are strongly down sloping in energy on the oblate side ( @xmath103 of the nilsson diagram and may aslo contribute to the stability of the oblate shape . indeed , collective oblate bands built on or involving these single high-@xmath104@xmath99 orbitals have been observed to low spin ( @xmath105 ) in light iodine nuclei @xcite and at medium spins in @xmath106ce @xcite and references therein .",
    "we note that the hamiltonian @xmath59 is not invariant to the chiral transformations , defined by changing the sign of one of the angular momenta @xmath107 and @xmath108 .",
    "it is worthwhile to write @xmath59 as a sum of a chiral invariant term @xmath109 and the non - invariant terms : @xmath110 the chiral properties will be studied alternatively with the basis @xmath111 and @xmath112",
    "for a state characterizing the ground band , the results concerning the average values of the angular momenta carried by protons and neutrons respectively , are : @xmath113 note that @xmath114 , since the proton and neutron deformations are equal to each other . using the above equation ,",
    "the angle between the two angular momenta associated to the proton and neutron subsystems is readily obtained : @xmath115 similarly the angular momenta composition of the @xmath25 states is specified by the following relations : @xmath116 here we used the notation @xmath117 and @xmath118 for the average of @xmath119 with the ground band state @xmath120 .",
    "the angle between the proton and neutron angular momenta can be obtained from the equation : @xmath121           the average values of the angular momenta in a ground band state as well as in a state of the @xmath25 system are plotted as function of the total angular momentum in figs . 1 and 2 .",
    "2 we also show the values of @xmath122 to be compared with @xmath123 . when the two curves intersect each other , the angular momenta carried by protons and neutrons respectively , are orthogonal . actually , the distance between the two curves represents a measure for the deviation from the orthogonality geometry .",
    "the angles between the proton and neutron angular momenta in a ground band state as well as in a @xmath25 state are plotted as function of the state total angular momentum in figs .",
    "3 and 4 respectively .",
    "the mechanism responsible for the orthogonality of proton and neutron angular momenta is determined by the increasing rotation frequency .",
    "indeed , in the ground state the core s proton and neutron angular momenta are anti - aligned , leading to a total angular momentum equal to zero .",
    "increasing the total angular momentum and therefore the rotational frequency , the angle between the two angular momenta becomes smaller than @xmath124 and for some critical values of frequency it reaches the value of @xmath125 .",
    "the angle between the core proton and neutron angular momenta decreases smoothly and slowly tends to zero for very high angular momenta .",
    "the situation when the core proton and neutron , as well as the fermion angular momenta are mutually orthogonal is optimal in determining the dipole transition strength .",
    "when the model hamiltonian is invariant to any chiral transformation one says that it exhibits a chiral symmetry and therefore any state of the @xmath25 and its transformed state are degenerate .",
    "breaking gently the chiral symmetry , this degeneracy is removed and as a result two @xmath16 quasi - degenerate bands show up . actually , the chiral symmetry is detected just by identifying the chiral bands partners .",
    "in other words , the symmetry is indirectly figured out when this is broken . breaking the chiral symmetry leads to a nuclear phase transition ,",
    "one phase being characterized by the chiral symmetry , while the other one without such a symmetry .",
    "usually , a phase transition is evidenced by the behavior of an order parameter . for",
    "the phase transition mentioned above a possible order parameter could be @xcite : @xmath126 the extreme values of @xmath127 are 1 when the three vectors are mutually orthogonal and 0 when they are planar .",
    "this quantity is plotted as function of the total angular momentum in fig 5 .",
    "note that for i=11 , 12 the angular momenta carried by the three components are orthogonal .",
    "suppose that the mentioned orthogonal angular momenta form a right - handed frame denoted by @xmath128 .",
    "acting on @xmath128 with the chiral transformation @xmath129 , one obtains the left - handed frame @xmath130 .",
    "this transformation , conventionally denoted by @xmath131 , does not commute with @xmath59 , due to the spin - spin term , @xmath72 .",
    "however it anti - commutes with the spin - spin term : @xmath132 if @xmath133 is an eigenstate of @xmath134 corresponding to the eigenvalue @xmath135 then the transformed function @xmath136 is also eigenfunction corresponding to the eigenvalue @xmath137",
    ". one eigenfunction of the spin - spin interaction is @xmath138 with the eigenvalue @xmath139.\\ ] ] obviously , the spectrum of the spin - spin interaction has the chiral property since a part of it is the mirror image , with respect to zero , of the other one .",
    "let us see what happens with the whole hamiltonian ( 3.6 ) .",
    "it is easy to show that the following equations approximatively hold : @xmath140\\psi^{(2qp;c)}_{ji;m}&=&\\left[\\langle \\psi^{(2qp;c)}_{ji;m}|h^{\\prime\\prime}|\\psi^{(2qp;c)}_{ji;m}\\rangle+\\lambda_{ji}\\right]|\\psi^{(2qp;c)}_{ji;m}\\rangle , \\nonumber\\\\ \\left[h^{\\prime\\prime}-x_{ss}{\\bf j_{f}}\\cdot { \\bf j_{c}}\\right]c_{12}|\\psi^{(2qp;c)}_{ji;m}\\rangle&=&\\left[\\langle \\psi^{(2qp;c)}_{ji;m}|h^{\\prime\\prime}|\\psi^{(2qp;c)}_{ji;m}\\rangle-\\lambda_{ji}\\right ] c_{12}|\\psi^{(2qp;c)}_{ji;m}\\rangle .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] therefore the hamiltonian @xmath59 exhibits also the chiral feature , since a part of the spectrum is the mirror image of the other , with respect to an intermediate spectrum given by averaging @xmath141 with the function @xmath142 .",
    "similar considerations can also be applied to the hamiltonian @xmath59 and to the basis of @xmath143 and @xmath144 , where @xmath145 denotes the chiral transformation which changes @xmath146 to @xmath147 .",
    "since the transformed hamiltonian with the chiral transformation @xmath148 , denoted hereafter by @xmath149 , is identical with the one corresponding to the transformation @xmath150 , the two transformed hamiltonians have identical spectra .    summarizing the above results , one can say that the spectrum of @xmath59 within this restricted space @xmath142 forms a chiral band denoted , for simplicity , with @xmath151 .",
    "the eigenvalues of @xmath59 obtained by averaging @xmath59 with the transformed wave function @xmath152 , forms the chiral partner band denoted by @xmath153 .",
    "another partner band of @xmath151 is @xmath154 corresponding to the chiral transformed functions @xmath144 .",
    "also the partner band of @xmath151 , denoted hereafter with @xmath155 , obtained by averaging @xmath59 with @xmath156 is identical with @xmath154 .",
    "note that the symmetry generated by the transformations @xmath145 and @xmath149 are broken by two terms , namely the spin - spin particle - core interaction and the rotational term @xmath157 involved in @xmath64 .",
    "the latter term is ineffective in a state where the angular momenta @xmath158 are orthogonal . since the wave - function @xmath142 is symmetric with respect to the proton - neutron permutation , the average values of the @xmath72 term with the transformed functions @xmath159 and @xmath156 are vanishing .",
    "therefore , the degenerate bands @xmath154 and @xmath155 are essentially determined by the symmetry breaking term generated by @xmath160 , i.e. -4@xmath161 . concluding , there are four chiral partner bands @xmath162 , obtained with @xmath59 and the wave functions @xmath142 , @xmath163 , @xmath144 , @xmath164 , respectively .",
    "the four chiral bands will be quantitatively studied in section vi .",
    "the chiral transformation can always be written as a product of a rotation with an angle equal to @xmath124 and a time reversal operator .",
    "the rotation is performed around one of the axes defined by @xmath18 , @xmath146 , @xmath108 which , in the situation when they are an orthogonal set of vectors , coincide with the axes of the body fixed frame . since the hamiltonian has terms which are linear in the rotation generators mentioned above , it is not invariant with respect to these rotations .",
    "@xmath59 is however invariant to the rotations in the laboratory frame , generated by the components of the total angular momentum , @xmath165 .",
    "the fingerprints of such an invariance can be found also in the structure of the wave functions describing the eigenstates of @xmath59 in the laboratory frame .",
    "this can be easily understood having in mind the following aspects .",
    "the proton and neutron angular momenta of the core are nearly perpendicular vectors in a plane perpendicular to the symmetry axis , in a certain spin interval .",
    "however , we can not state that @xmath65 is oriented along the @xmath166 or @xmath167 axes .",
    "in the first case the intrinsic reference frame would be right - handed , while in the second situations it is left - handed . in other words the wave function must comprise right- and left - handed components which are equally probable .",
    "their weights are then either identical or equal in magnitude but of opposite sign . since the transformation @xmath145 changes the direction of @xmath146 , it will change the left- to the right - handed component and vice versa .",
    "it results that the states of the basis ( [ basis1 ] ) are eigenstates of @xmath145 .",
    "similar reasoning is valid also for the transformation @xmath131 , the component corresponding to the orientation of @xmath18 along the @xmath94 axis being equally probable with the component with @xmath18 having an opposite direction .",
    "we remark that by the transformation @xmath131 , the wave function @xmath142 goes to : @xmath168",
    "here we formulate a schematic model which is more easy to handle .",
    "the basis ( [ basis2 ] ) has been used in refs .",
    "@xcite in connection with the triaxial isotopes @xmath21pt and @xmath169os .",
    "therein , the angular momentum composition of the involved projected states was described in detail . moreover ,",
    "the particle - core hamiltonian was similar to the one used in the present paper with the difference that there the particle - core terms with anharmonic boson factor were missing . here , we shall use a very simple hamiltonian , which in the quasiparticle representation looks like : @xmath170 we shall use the same notations as in the previous sections . thus , by the transformations @xmath171 , the right - handed intrinsic reference frame @xmath128 is changed to the left - handed frames @xmath130 , @xmath172 and @xmath173 respectively . correspondingly , the wave functions @xmath174 are transformed to @xmath175 , @xmath176 and @xmath177 , respectively . each of these functions generates a rotational band defined by the corresponding average values of @xmath59 .",
    "thus , the band denoted by @xmath178 and its chiral partners @xmath179 , @xmath180 and @xmath181 show up . the proof that the bands have , indeed",
    ", a chiral character goes identically with that used for the different hamiltonian ( [ modelh ] ) and the different basis ( [ basis1 ] ) .",
    "since the spin - spin interaction is ineffective in determining the band @xmath181 it is natural to construct its chiral partner also with the hamiltonian @xmath182 defined by ( 3.16 ) , but without the spin - spin interaction , i.e. @xmath183 thus , the bands obtained by averaging @xmath182 alternatively with @xmath174 and with @xmath176 are denoted by @xmath180 and @xmath181 respectively .",
    "the band obtained with @xmath184 is degenerated with the band @xmath181",
    "the formalism presented above was applied to the case of @xmath7nd .",
    "the experimental data were taken from refs .",
    "the reason for which we chose to apply the present formalism to @xmath7nd is that it has been proven that this nucleus is triaxial both at low and high spins , through a coherent interpretation of most of the multitude of observed bands .",
    "the triaxiality is a prerequisite of chiral motion which is predicted by the present formalism . among the eight observed dipole bands in @xmath7nd ,",
    "there are two bands which could have chiral character : band @xmath185 which is suggested as chiral partner of band @xmath186 in ref .",
    "[ 10 ] within the @xmath187 formalism , and band @xmath188 for which two possible configurations of two and four quasiparticles were suggested in ref . [",
    "10 ] , but which has characteristics compatible with the present @xmath189 formalism which predict chiral bands of different nature .",
    "indeed , for band @xmath188 both the level energies and the transition probabilities are in agreement with the present formalism .",
    "firstly , the band - head energy of band @xmath188 is the lowest among the eight observed dipole bands and is in agreement with the energy calculated by @xmath189 using realistic assumptions for the model parameters .",
    "secondly , the band is composed of only dipole transitions , which is in agreement with the prediction of the present formalism .",
    "thirdly , a possible chiral partner has been identified . all these features which will be discussed in the following in this section induced us to propose band @xmath188 as candidate for the new chiral mode .",
    "the collective states from the ground , @xmath36 and @xmath34 bands were described by means of the gcsm .",
    "the particle - core term is associated to the protons from @xmath99 interacting with the core through the harmonic @xmath71 term , a spin - spin term and an anharmonic force of quadrupole - quadrupole plus a hexadecapole - hexadecapole type .",
    "the structure coefficients @xmath190 were fixed by fitting the experimental energies of the states @xmath191 .",
    "the deformation parameter @xmath192 was chosen such that an overall agreement is obtained .",

    "the symmetric states are considered for the gamma band . as for the @xmath36 band ,",

    "the quasiparticle energy for @xmath201 is taken equal to 2 mev , which for a single @xmath87 calculation would correspond to a paring strength g=0.67 mev .",
    "the agreement with the data is improved by switching on the anharmonic particle - core interaction .",
    "since the monopole - monopole term determines just a constant shift for the energy levels , we ignore it . as for the quadrupole - quadrupole and hexadecapole - hexadecapole interactions",
    ", we considered equal strengths but of different sign i.e. , @xmath202 .",
    "this choice quenches the rotation influence on energies in the upper part of the band . switching on the @xmath72 interaction , the degeneracy of the four bands , @xmath198 and @xmath155 ,",

[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     it is very interesting to note that under the chiral transformation @xmath145 the rotational term @xmath204 involved in @xmath64 becomes @xmath205 .",
    "this term appearing in the chiral transformed @xmath182 is essential in determining the partner band @xmath181 . on the other hand we recall that such a term is used by the two rotor model to define the scissors mode . in that respect",
    "the partner band @xmath181 may be interpreted as the second order scissors band .",

    "the model hamiltonian was treated within a restricted space associated to the phenomenological core and the subspace of aligned two proton quasiparticle states coupled to the states of the phenomenological core states .",
    "two scenarios for the particle - core hamiltonian as well as for the particle - core states are considered :    * a ) * the particle - core hamiltonian involves as phenomenological factor a linear quadrupole as well as an anharmonic boson quadrupole and an anharmonic boson hexadecapole term .",
    "also a spin - spin interaction is taken into consideration .",
    "the model hamiltonian was treated within a restricted space associated to the phenomenological core and the subspace of two aligned proton quasiparticle states coupled with the states of the phenomenological ground band .",
    "the former space is spanned by the model projected states assigned to six bands : ground ( g ) , @xmath206 .",
    "this basis is enlarged by adding the chiral transformed states .",
    "the eigenvalues of the model hamiltonian within this restricted basis are arranged in four bands denoted by @xmath198 and @xmath155 , respectively .",

    "this is compared with the theoretical band @xmath151 .",
    "the bands @xmath207 are also studied . an experimental chiral partner for band d4",
    "is also proposed , which is associated with the calculated band @xmath153 .",
    "we calculated not only the energies of these bands but also the intra - band m1 and e2 transitions .",
    "since the m1 transition operator does not commute with the chiral transformations relating the right and left - handed intrinsic reference frames , the b(m1 ) values are changed when we pass from one band to another . on the contrary , the e2 transition operator is invariant to the mentioned chiral transformations and therefore b(e2 ) values are the same in all four chiral bands .",
    "it is remarkable that although the bands @xmath154 and @xmath155 are degenerate , they are characterized by different intra - band @xmath92 transitions .",
    "both the m1 and e2 transitions exhibit the properties which are specific to the chiral bands .",

    "the basis used for treating this hamiltonian consists of the core states , the six bands , and two aligned proton quasiparticles , from the @xmath201 sub - shell , coupled with the phenomenological magnetic dipole states describing the core .",
    "also the chiral transformed states are members of the model basis .",
    "the resulting bands are denoted by @xmath208 and @xmath181 , respectively .",
    "energies and @xmath92 properties for these bands are quantitatively studied .",
    "note that for describing the bands @xmath180 and @xmath181 there is only one parameter , that is the two quasiparticle energy of the single @xmath87 state @xmath99 , which shift all energies in the two bands .",
    "the energies of band @xmath180 agree very well with the corresponding experimental data .",
    "the band head of the b - like bands is the state @xmath209 . in this scenario",
    "the head state for the experimental band d4 , @xmath210 , belongs to the ground band of the core .",
    "note that the effect of the chiral transformation @xmath131 on the energies of band @xmath178 is to increase them , while the transformation @xmath145 applied on @xmath180 compresses the energy levels .    in both scenarios the energy spacings in all four bands",
    "is almost constant .",
    "also the intra - band b(m1 ) values are large and different when one passes from one band to another . on the contrary , the b(e2 ) values",
    "do not depend on band and in general are small . as a matter of fact",
    "these properties confer the bands a chiral character .    experimental data for energies of the chiral partner bands as well as for electromagnetic intra - band transitions would be a stringent test for the hypothesis advanced in the present paper .",
    "our work proves that the mechanism for chiral symmetry breaking , which also favors a large transverse component for the dipole magnetic transition operator @xcite , is not unique .",
    "the two bases were chosen since the core states are low in energy and therefore are the most favored ones .",
    "however , the results described above show that the basis with the dipole collective states involved provides a more realistic description of the experimental band d4 .",
    "moreover the partner band @xmath181 may be interpreted as the second order scissors band .",
    "it is clear that an improvement of the two descriptions may be obtained by diagonalizing the model hamiltonian consisting of @xmath64 plus the particle - core coupling terms in a larger basis obtained by the reunion of the two bases ( [ basis1 ] ) and ( [ basis2 ] )    for odd - odd nuclei several groups identified twin bands in medium mass regions @xcite and even for heavy mass regions @xcite .",
    "the formalisms proposed are based either on the tilted axis cranking ( tac ) approach @xcite or on the two quasiparticle - triaxial rotor coupling model @xcite . although the efforts were mainly focused on identifying and describing the chiral twin bands in odd - odd nuclei , few results for even - odd @xcite and even - even @xcite nuclei were also reported .    finally , we mention again that the formalism proposed in the present paper concerns the even - even nuclei and is based on a new concept .",
    "indeed , there are few features which contrasts the main characteristics of the elegant model proposed by frauendorf for odd - odd nuclei @xcite .",
    "indeed , here the right- and left - handed frames are the angular momentum carried by two aligned protons and by proton and neutron bosons respectively , associated to the core . within the model proposed by frauendorf the shears motion",
    "is achieved by one proton - particle and one neutron - hole , while here the shears blades are the proton and neutron components of the core .",
    "the b(m1 ) values are maximal at the beginning of the band and decrease with angular momentum and finally , when the shears are closed , they are vanishing since there is no transverse magnetic momentum any longer .",
    "by contrast , here the b(m1 ) value is an increasing function of the angular momentum . in both models",
    "the dominant contribution to the dipole magnetic transition probability is coming from particles sub - system .",
    "this property is determined by the specific magnitudes of the gyromagnetic factors associated to the three components of the system .",
    "since the two schematic models reveal some complementary magnetic properties of nuclei they might cover different areas of nuclear spectra .",

    "the reduced matrix elements for the m1 transition operator in the basis ( [ basis2 ] ) have been analytically derived in ref.@xcite .",
