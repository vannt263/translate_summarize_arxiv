    "beneath the scattered point sources that speckle the x - ray sky should lie a subtler , more continuous background of x - rays emanating from the hot gas that fills the spaces between galaxies .",
    "many , if not most , of the universe s baryons inhabit intergalactic space and are heated to temperatures of @xmath2  k by gravitationally - driven shocks ( e.g. , cen & ostriker 1999 ; dav 2000 ) .",
    "once heated , these baryons tend to settle into gravitational potential wells and assume the characteristic temperature of the dark matter that confines them . because the emissivity of these baryons depends on how severely they are compressed , the mean intensity of the continuous x - ray background reflects the amount of non - gravitational energy injected into intergalactic space .",
    "large amounts of energy injection by supernovae and active galactic nuclei can inhibit compression of the intergalactic medium , lowering the mean level of the continuous background .",
    "current estimates place the point - source contribution to the 0.5 - 2  kev background at @xmath3% ( hasinger 1998 ; mushotzky 2000 ; giacconi 2000 ) , meaning that hot intergalactic gas contributes less than 20% , which amounts to @xmath4 .",
    "a sizeable fraction of this residual emission comes from clusters of galaxies . integrating over the observed luminosity function of clusters , assuming no luminosity evolution , places the background from clusters hotter than 5  kev at @xmath5 .",
    "however , these clusters cover only @xmath6% of the sky .",
    "the remainder is covered by a confused patchwork of groups and intercluster filaments whose properties depend critically on non - gravitational processes . if gravitational processes alone were responsible for establishing the entropy distribution of intergalactic gas , emission from groups and filaments would vastly overproduce the remainder of the 0.5 - 2  kev background ( pen 1999 ; wu , fabian , & nulsen 2000 ) . somehow , the lowest - entropy , most compressible gas has been eliminated .",
    "non - gravitational heating has been the most widely studied way of establishing this entropy floor , but it is also possible that low - entropy gas has been removed by radiative cooling and subsequent condensation ( e.g. , bryan 2000 ) .    analyzing individual groups and filaments to determine the impact of energy injection and cooling will not be easy . several factors",
    "complicate the task of compiling unbiased samples of x - ray emitting groups : groups are low surface - brightness objects , some apparent groups are chance superpositions of galaxies , and the potential wells of individual galaxies can strongly affect a group s x - ray properties ( see mulchaey 2000 for a review ) .",
    "projection effects further complicate matters .",
    "virialized objects with",
    "@xmath7  kev cover over a third of the sky , making individual filaments very difficult to isolate and creating a significant probability that one group will overlap another somewhere along the same line of sight ( voit , evrard , & bryan 2000 ) .",
    "for example , about three higher - redshift @xmath8  kev groups are expected to lie within the projected virial radius of a 0.5  kev group at @xmath9 .",
    "because of these projection effects , statistical analyses of the 0.5 - 2  kev surface brightness distribution should be explored as an alternative way to characterize the lowest surface - brightness structures in the x - ray sky and perhaps to gauge the impact of non - gravitational energy injection and cooling .",
    "we have begun to investigate this brightness distribution using both hydrodynamical simulations and semi - analytical techniques and report some of our early results in this letter .",
    "section  2 briefly describes our simulations of the x - ray surface brightness distribution and shows how the high - brightness end can be approximated with a semi - analytical model .",
    "section  3 demonstrates that non - gravitational processes strongly influence this distribution function , and ",
    "4 summarizes our results .",
    "our analysis of the x - ray background owing to intergalactic gas centers on the quantity @xmath10 , the probability that a given line of sight through the universe will have a 0.5 - 2  kev surface brightness @xmath11 .",
    "the ideal computation of @xmath10 would involve a hydrodynamical simulation encompassing the entire observable universe , but this is currently infeasible .",
    "instead , we have chosen to simulate a box large enough to contain a fair sample of clusters and groups , yet small enough to resolve the cores of these virialized objects . a companion paper ( bryan & voit 2001 ) describes in more detail these simulations , which employ an adaptive mesh refinement technique for the hydrodynamics ( bryan 1999 ; bryan & norman 1997 ; norman & bryan 1999 ) .",
    "here we will focus on simulations of a @xmath12 box with @xmath13 grid points and mesh refinement down to a minimum cell size of @xmath14 .",
    "we reconstruct @xmath10 for lines of sight from @xmath15 by computing @xmath16 for the box alone at a number of discrete redshift points to determine how @xmath16 varies with redshift for a given comoving box size . at any given redshift",
    ", the comoving size of our simulation box corresponds to a redshift interval @xmath17 , so we can reconstruct @xmath16 for the entire line of sight by appropriately convolving the individual distributions corresponding to each redshift interval ( see bryan & voit 2001 for more details ) .",
    "this procedure yields the distribution shown in figure  [ sbplt_ps ] for a @xmath18cdm cosmology ( @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 ) with a baryon fraction @xmath22 and without non - gravitational energy injection . because of the limited box size",
    ", we can not capture brightness enhancements owing to correlated structure on @xmath23 scales , but we anticipate that their effect on @xmath10 will be small .",
    "several features of this distribution are worth noting .",
    "first , the mean surface brightness is @xmath24 , about five times higher than allowed by observations , verifying the expectations of pen ( 1999 ) and wu ( 2000 ) .",
    "in addition , our numerical experiments reveal that @xmath25 depends on numerical resolution , implying that @xmath25 in an optimally resolved simulation would be even higher ( bryan & voit 2001 ) .",
    "second , @xmath26 at @xmath27 indicating that the median value of @xmath28 is close to the maximum allowed by observations .",
    "third , the quantity @xmath29 shows a broad peak between @xmath30 and @xmath31 , indicating that most lines of sight have a surface brightness broadly distributed in this range .",
    "finally , we show for comparison two @xmath10 distributions derived from the power - law fits to rosat and chandra point - source counts of hasinger ( 1998 ) and giacconi ( 2000 ) assuming gaussian point - spread functions with full - width at half - max of 1 arcsec and 10 arcsec . in both cases ,",
    "diffuse hot gas dominates the surface - brightness distribution from @xmath30 to @xmath32 .",
    "an early hydrodynamical computation of x - ray surface brightness was performed by scaramella , cen , & ostriker ( 1993 ) , who computed the mean and variance of the specific intensity at 1 and 2 kev for a standard cdm cosmology using simulations of somewhat lower effective resolution .",
    "because of the different cosmological model and resolution limit , their results are difficult to compare directly with our own .",
    "however , we do verify their conclusions regarding the brightness distribution at intermediate brightness levels .",
    "scaramella ( 1993 ) found that the pixel distribution of specific intensity ( @xmath33 ) varies like @xmath34 , equivalent to @xmath35 .",
    "figure  [ sbplt_ps ] illustrates this power - law slope , which is quite similar to that of our model in the neighborhood of @xmath36 to @xmath31 .",
    "this scaling stems from the @xmath0-model surface brightness distribution typical of clusters of galaxies .",
    "most clusters are adequately fit by the law @xmath37^{-3\\beta+1/2}$ ] , where @xmath38 is the cluster s core radius .",
    "( cavaliere & fusco - femiano 1978 ) . for an individual cluster",
    "we therefore have @xmath39}$ ] , which reduces to @xmath40 for @xmath41 , quite close to the slope found by scaramella ( 1993 ) .",
    "as figure  [ sbplt_ps ] shows , this relation is also a good approximation of @xmath10 in the intermediate range .",
    "because the simulations produce clusters and groups that are well fit by @xmath0-models , we can successfully reproduce our simulated @xmath10 through semi - analytical means .",
    "following voit ( 2000 ) , we have taken the cluster catalog from the @xmath18cdm hubble volume simulation performed by the virgo consortium ( evrard 1999 ; macfarland 1998 ; frenk 2000 ) and have computed @xmath10 assuming @xmath41 surface - brightness profiles and the core radius - luminosity relation from jones ( 1998 ) .",
    "however , instead of using the observed @xmath42-@xmath43 relation , we assume @xmath44 , correct @xmath42 to the 0.5 - 2.0  kev band as described in bryan & norman ( 1998 ) for a metallicity of 0.3 solar , and normalize the relation to fit our simulated clusters at @xmath6  kev .",
    "figure  2 compares the resulting @xmath10 distribution with the hydrodynamical model and the @xmath10 derived from the hubble volume catalog using the _ rosat _ @xmath42-@xmath43 relation observed by markevitch ( 1998 ) instead of the one derived from the simulation .",
    "apparently , the contribution to @xmath10 from the virialized regions of clusters and groups can be adequately modeled by combining the cluster mass function with appropriate analytical equations relating luminosity to mass and to a cluster s surface - brightness profile .",
    "the excellent agreement between the simulated and semi - analytical @xmath10 distributions also simplifies the task of identifying the major contributors at each level of @xmath28 .",
    "the steep slope of @xmath10 at the surface - brightness levels of cluster cores ( @xmath45 ) echoes the steep slope of the cluster mass function . between @xmath46",
    "the @xmath0-model outskirts of clusters and groups dominate the background , and below @xmath47 is the realm of true intercluster emission .",
    "our model without energy injection is illuminating but clearly does not represent reality , primarily because @xmath25 is far too high . applying the observed @xmath42-@xmath43 relation to the hubble volume clusters",
    "significantly shifts the @xmath10 distribution to lower @xmath28 ( see figure  [ sbcomp ] ) with @xmath48 , on the verge of being disallowed by observations . however , this model relies on an uncertain extrapolation of the cluster @xmath42-@xmath43 relation down to group scales .",
    "in fact , the @xmath42-@xmath43 relation may steepen below @xmath49 , perhaps because supernova energy injection becomes comparable to the gravitational energy of the intragroup gas ( e.g. , heldson & ponman 2000 ) .    in order to explore the effect of non - gravitational energy injection on @xmath10",
    ", we have run a hydrodynamical model with a very simple prescription for preheating : we instantaneously add @xmath50 of energy per baryon at @xmath51 , similar to the level needed to explain the observed @xmath42-@xmath43 relation for clusters ( e.g. , ponman , cannon , & navarro 1999 ) .",
    "figure [ sbfbck ] shows the resulting @xmath10 in terms of the quantity @xmath52 , which peaks in the neighborhood of @xmath28 values that contribute most to the mean .",
    "the distribution has indeed shifted to lower @xmath28 , relative to the no - preheating case , and @xmath52 has also flattened , indicating that a larger range of @xmath28 contributes significantly to the mean . yet ,",
    "the mean surface brightness , @xmath53 , still exceeds observational limits .",
    "furthermore , our numerical experiments indicate that even this value may be an underestimate ( bryan & voit 2001 ) .    another crude but inexpensive way to way to explore the effects of non - gravitational processes is to apply an ad hoc entropy floor to the simulation results .",
    "the heat input required to explain the scaling properties of clusters corresponds to a minimum entropy level @xmath54 ( e.g. , ponman 1999 ) .",
    "interestingly , the same critical entropy level also emerges from cooling considerations : @xmath49 gas will cool and condense within a hubble time if its specific entropy level is @xmath55 . in either case , establishing an entropy floor lowers the mean gas density in the cores of groups and clusters .",
    "thus , we have chosen to mimic the effect of an entropy floor by recalculating @xmath10 after substituting the quantity @xmath56^{-3/2}$ ] for the original gas density .",
    "figure  [ sbfbck ] shows the resulting @xmath52 distributions . for @xmath57 ,",
    "we obtain @xmath58 , just barely consistent with current observations , and for @xmath59 , we obtain @xmath60 .",
    "croft ( 2000 ) have recently performed a similar computation using a smooth - particle hydrodynamics code that includes cooling and a prescription for supernova feedback and find @xmath61.cdm cosmology with @xmath62 .",
    "their value for the @xmath63  background from diffuse gas , @xmath64 , is even lower , partly because of the lower baryon fraction .",
    "] because the simulation analyzed by croft includes multiple non - gravitational processes that ours do not , it is difficult to pinpoint the process most responsible for lowering their value of @xmath25 .",
    "quite possibly , removal of low - entropy gas by cooling and condensation could be just as important as supernova heating in establishing @xmath25 and the @xmath42-@xmath43 relation of groups and clusters ( see also bryan 2000 ) .",
    "it also remains possible that @xmath25 would be larger in a higher - resolution sph computation .",
    "additional simulations will be needed to clarify the roles of various non - gravitational processes and to relate the thermal history of intergalactic baryons to the @xmath10 distribution .    given the difficulties in compiling an unbiased @xmath42-@xmath43 relation for groups , we suggest that observations of the @xmath10 distribution at 0.5 - 2  kev be pursued as an alternative way to constrain preheating and radiative cooling .",
    "the quantity @xmath52 is clearly sensitive to non - gravitational processes like energy injection and cooling , particularly around @xmath65 , and the background from hot gas is competitive with the point - source background in _",
    "chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ observations over the interesting range of @xmath28 ( @xmath66 ) .",
    "identification of extended sources and follow - up redshift surveys are unnecessary .",
    "however , the trick will be to distinguish the true astronomical background from non - astronomical detector events .",
    "we have derived the 0.5 - 2  kev surface - brightness distribution function @xmath10 from hydrodynamical simulations of structure formation in a @xmath18cdm cosmology . the bright end of this distribution is well reproduced by combining the cluster catalog from the @xmath18cdm hubble volume simulation with appropriate @xmath42-@xmath43 and @xmath38-@xmath42 relations and a @xmath67 surface - brightness law . without non - gravitational heating or cooling , @xmath25 exceeds observed limits by a factor of several .",
    "another simulation that adds @xmath68 of energy at @xmath51 substantially lowers @xmath25 , but not by enough .",
    "an entropy floor @xmath69 appears necessary to reconcile our simulations with observational limits .",
    "observations of @xmath10 with _ chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ appear to be a promising way to constrain the thermodynamical history of this intergalactic gas .    glb is supported by nasa through hubble fellowship grant hf-01104.01 - 98a from the space telescope science institute , which is operated under nasa contract nas6 - 26555 .",
