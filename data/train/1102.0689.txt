    "the evaporation of black holes through hawking radiation is one of the cornerstones of post - classical gravity@xcite . in hawking s original derivation  @xcite for the case of a gravitational collapse ,",
    "the emphasis lay on the positive - energy modes that cross the horizon just before it is actually formed , escape from the black - hole spacetime and can in principle be detected by an asymptotic observer .",
    "hawking already observes that the decrease of the black hole mass , and the accompanying decrease of the area of the event horizon `` must , presumably , be caused by a flux of negative energy across the event horizon which balances the positive energy flux emitted to infinity .",
    "one might picture this negative energy flux in the following way .",
    "just outside the event horizon there will be virtual pairs of particles , one with negative energy and one with positive energy .",
    "the negative particle  can tunnel through the event horizon to the region inside the black hole  in this region the particle can exist as a real particle with a timelike momentum vector even though its energy relative to infinity as measured by the time translation killing vector is negative . the other particle of the pair , having a positive energy , can escape to infinity where it constitutes a part of the thermal emission described above . ''",
    "hawking warns , however , that it `` should be emphasized that these pictures of the mechanism responsible for the thermal emission and area decrease are heuristic only and should not be taken too literally . ''    with regard to massive particles , hawking notes that `` as [ the black holes ] got smaller , they would get hotter and so would radiate faster . as the temperature rose , it would exceed the rest mass of particles such as the electron and the muon and the black hole would begin to emit them also . ''",
    "therefore , `` the rate of particle emission in the asymptotic future  will again be that of a body with temperature @xmath0 .",
    "the only difference from the zero rest mass case is that the frequency @xmath1 in the thermal factor @xmath2 now includes the rest mass energy of the particle .",
    "thus there will not be much emission of particles of rest mass @xmath3 unless the temperature @xmath0 is greater than @xmath3 . ''",
    "a similar conclusion was reached in  @xcite . indeed ,",
    "for the black hole to emit for example an electron , its temperature must be on the order of @xmath4 kelvin . and",
    "using @xmath5 , one obtains @xmath6 kelvin .",
    "this rough estimate is in agreement with @xcite ( see p.261 ) .",
    "the associated frequency , from @xmath7 , is @xmath8 . ] due to emission of massless particles the black hole will eventually become small enough for the temperature to reach @xmath9 k , and then the radiation will contain electrons and positrons .",
    "but for most of the lifetime of the black hole , the mass cutoff prevents any ( significant ) radiation of electrons .",
    "implicit in the above reasoning is that the black hole emission corresponds ( by definition ) to what can be detected by an asymptotic observer .",
    "this definition makes sense from a relativistic point of view because a black hole in relativity is , strictly speaking , not just the central object enclosed by a horizon , but also the entire spacetime surrounding it .",
    "this definition however has various well - known complications , for example that , strictly speaking , one needs an infinite amount of time to ascertain the existence of a black hole . in an astrophysical sense , therefore , the alternative definition in which the black hole is only what lies beyond the horizon makes much more sense . in the context of analogue gravity , which we will discuss in section  [ s : analogue - gravity ] , only the horizons are the essential ingredient and it makes little sense to speak of asymptotic observers .",
    "one can already anticipate that , from this second point of view , what is emitted by the black hole ( i.e. , what moves away from the horizon ) is not necessarily equal to what is detected at infinity .",
    "as we will see , the difference can actually be substantial .",
    "hawking s heuristic picture in which the black hole shrinks through the absorption of negative - energy modes was given a physical basis in the following context . an important problem with hawking s calculation",
    "is the so - called `` transplanckian problem '' : the exponential frequency - shift near the horizon means that particles detected just seconds after the formation of the black hole seemingly originate from modes with an energy exceeding by far the total energy of the observable universe just before the formation of the black hole . in 1981 , in what is usually considered the founding paper of analogue gravity ( see  @xcite for a review ) , unruh  @xcite noted that the propagation of sound waves in a fluid with a subsonic - to - supersonic transition is formally identical to the propagation of scalar fields in a black hole spacetime . since the continuum description of fluid systems has a natural cut - off ( the intermolecular distance ) , the transplanckian problem of hawking radiation can be studied in this fluid - analogy context .",
    "unruh took up his own suggestion and studied the ( typically `` subluminal '' ) modification of the dispersion relation for sound waves compared to a `` relativistic '' or acoustic one , and its influence on the hawking spectrum  @xcite .",
    "for such subluminal dispersion , an outgoing positive - energy hawking packet can be traced back to a mixed positive / negative - energy mode originating from _ outside _ the horizon .",
    "if the dispersion is changed to superluminal then the positive - energy mode originates from _ inside _ the horizon , but this difference does not alter the size of the hawking effect compared to the subluminal case .",
    "this suggests that the evaporation ( loss of mass ) of the black hole does not rely so much on this positive - energy emission , but instead has its physical origin in the absorption of the negative - energy partner .",
    "the negative - energy mode is always consumed by the black hole , regardless of the details of the high - energy dispersion .",
    "it is far beyond our intention to clear up the exact physical origin of hawking emission and black - hole evaporation .",
    "what we do want to point out , however , is the following .",
    "the emission of massive positive - energy modes immediately seems to be limited by a lower cut - off , as pointed out above , since the energy of a massive mode in the flat space - time of an asymptotic observer can not be less than its mass - energy .",
    "this is not the case , however , for the absorption of massive negative - energy modes , since these fall into the black hole and so never obey the flat space - time dispersion relation .",
    "in fact , as we will discuss in detail , the process of creation of positive / negative - energy pairs near the horizon is not restricted by the mass of the corresponding modes .",
    "massive negative - energy modes are created and absorbed by the black hole according to exactly the same mechanism and at exactly the same rate as massless modes . since the two pictures of black hole evaporation through hawking radiation ( either through the emission of positive - energy modes or through the absorption of negative - energy modes )",
    "should in principle lead to exactly the same evaporation rate , this raises an apparent paradox .",
    "the paradox is qualitatively easy to solve : all positive - energy modes emitted with energy ( relative to asymptotic infinity ) below the rest - mass energy must somehow be reabsorbed by the black hole in order to counterbalance the `` excess '' negative - energy absorption . a detailed analysis of how this process takes place leads to some curious consequences , and in particular to several potentially crucial aspects for experiments in analogue gravity systems with massive modes .",
    "before starting our analysis , note that we will talk about massive _ modes _ to avoid any caveats concerning the definition of _ particles _ in a curved spacetime .",
    "this is not just a matter of terminology . strictly speaking",
    ", particles do not go on - shell until they have reached the flat region of spacetime ( either at infinity , or when they are trapped by the potential well of a particle detector before reaching infinity ) .",
    "care should therefore be taken when reasoning in terms of particles .",
    "for example , the usual heuristic argument about particle pair creation near the horizon ( due to the effect of curvature on a distance of the order of the compton wavelength ) might induce one to think that massive particle pairs are created near a black hole horizon only when the action is sufficient to provide an energy at least equal to the pair s mass .",
    "this argument might be useful in that it correctly reproduces the threshold for particles to appear at infinity , as mentioned above .",
    "however , in order to make estimates about what happens anywhere between the black hole horizon and infinity , it can be quite deceptive , and it is more indicated to reason in terms of modes or wave packets , as we will do . for analogue gravity systems ,",
    "such complications do not usually arise because the emitted modes are in general phonons or other collective excitations , which are in any case naturally decribed in terms of waves rather than particles .",
    "moreover , the configurations considered for experimental detection of analogue hawking radiation are typically stationary and have an asymptotically constant background flow velocity @xmath10 .",
    "the ambiguity of the quantum vacuum definition in a non - stationary curved spacetime  @xcite does therefore not arise here ( see  @xcite for useful remarks in the case of phonons in a bec ) .",
    "we will come back extensively to the question of detectability in sections  [ s : hr ] and [ s : analogue - gravity ] .",
    "the general dispersion relation for massive klein - gordon modes trying to escape a black hole can be written @xmath11 note that , strictly speaking , the mass @xmath12 of the mode is given by @xmath13 .",
    "we set @xmath14 and will refer throughout to @xmath3 as the mass . as usual , @xmath15 can either represent the velocity of an observer freely falling into the black hole ( in the case of gravity ) , or the velocity of a background flow against which the mode counter - propagates ( for analogue gravity systems ) .",
    "both cases are described by exactly the same painlev - gullstrand - lematre metric @xmath16dt^2 - 2u(x ) dt\\ , dx -dx^2\\ ] ] where @xmath17 is the direction perpendicular to the horizon ( which contains all the essential features that we are interested in ) , and @xmath18 represents the speed of light , or in analogue gravity the ( low - frequency ) speed of sound or any other characteristic velocity of the system which leads to an effective relativistic behaviour ( typically ) at low frequencies .",
    "the strict equivalence ( at least at low frequencies ) means that we do not have to worry about terminology , and so we will typically refer quite generally to , for instance , @xmath19 as the `` sonic '' case , @xmath10 as the `` background flow '' , and `` counter - propagating modes '' for modes that try to escape the black hole ( or enter a white hole ) , as if they were moving against a background flow",
    ".    the action of the klein - gordon field @xmath20 in the metric ( [ metric ] ) is @xmath21,\\ ] ] which gives the field equation @xmath22 and the dispersion relation ( [ disp - rel - squared ] ) .",
    "wave packets obeying the klein - gordon equation ( [ kgeqn ] ) possess two conserved quantities due to the invariance of the action ( [ action ] ) under 1 ) the transformation @xmath23 , @xmath24 constant , and 2 ) time translation ( for time - independent @xmath10 ) .",

    "the only blocking line ( @xmath122 ) for @xmath118 is therefore @xmath19 . for @xmath119 , however , a second blocking line @xmath71 is present , the `` red horizon '' : for a given period @xmath123 ( frequency @xmath1 ) , massive modes can only exist for @xmath69 , i.e. when the counterflow is sufficiently strong . for weaker background flows @xmath70 ,",

    "when @xmath62 , @xmath131 , and reappears as @xmath132 when @xmath64 . for @xmath68 , there is therefore one negative and one positive root . for @xmath118 , there are 2 roots , one positive ( @xmath55 , counter - propagating ) and one negative ( @xmath60 , co - propagating ) , both with positive ( co - moving ) frequency , as long as @xmath91 . for @xmath68 ,",
    "the @xmath55 solution has converted into a negative - frequency and negative-@xmath27 root and therefore @xmath133 .",
    "as before , the transition from @xmath134 to @xmath58 goes through @xmath135 for @xmath136 , i.e. : @xmath55 effectively disappears for @xmath19 .",
    "as was seen in the foregoing , the behaviour of all massive ( counter - propagating ) modes , including those with @xmath33 , is identical very close to the black - hole horizon : they all experience the familiar infinite blue - shifting .",
    "this behaviour at the horizon is in fact a serious problem for the derivation of the hawking effect for real black holes , as it invalidates the assumption of negligible back - reaction on the black hole .",
    "nevertheless it is now well - established that the introduction of non - linear dispersion at high wave numbers does not destroy the hawking mechanism ( although see  @xcite for some possible complications with respect to the vacuum selection in the case of super - luminal dispersion ) , while it limits the blue - shifting at the horizon .",
    "this removal of infinite ( co - moving ) frequencies through dispersion is certainly present in all analogue systems and gives a robust basis for investigations of hawking radiation .",
    "as all massive modes are not distinguished by their behaviour at the horizon , where the hawking mechanism occurs , any fields described by the klein - gordon equation will exhibit the hawking effect at all frequencies @xmath1 , i.e. without a cutoff given by the mass .",
    "but the fact that a particular mode exhibits the hawking effect does not imply that it contributes to the evaporation of the black hole . after being emitted from the black hole",
    ", particles with @xmath137 eventually turn around and fall though the horizon , so they do not contribute to the evaporation .",
    "but one could imagine capturing the @xmath137 particles before they fall back into the black hole , in which case they would contribute to the shrinking of the horizon .",
    "a detector @xmath138 placed sufficiently close to the black hole will detect a significant amount of massive particles emitted by the black hole that are not detected by a detector at infinity .",
    "the same detector @xmath138 would also register massive hawking particles falling back into the black hole .    for a schwarzschild black hole ,",
    "the position @xmath139 of the red horizon is obtained from @xmath140 , with @xmath141 the schwarzschild radius and @xmath48 given by eq .. this leads , for example , to @xmath142 for @xmath143 , and @xmath144 for @xmath145 .",
    "the spectral resolution of a hypothetical particle detector placed at a position @xmath146 will essentially be determined by the fly - by time of the emitted mode : the time between crossing the detector on its way out and its disappearance behind the black hole horizon , after having bounced on the red horizon . to obtain a sufficient resolution",
    ", one would need a supermassive black hole , and/or place the detector extremely close to the black hole horizon , where the mode is slowed down by the black hole s gravitational pull . in that region ,",
    "all sorts of additional astrophysical effects would probably put strong limits on the detectability of the boomerang behaviour .",
    "although these issues are not very different from the general problems of detecting ( massless ) hawking radiation , it is clear that such considerations are of theoretical interest only in the astrophysical case .",
    "however , for an analogue system , there is no issue with the spectral resolution since the modes can perfectly well be detected inside the horizon . for an analogue system in which a field obeys the klein - gordon equation ,",
    "the lack of a mass cutoff in the emission of hawking radiation is very important , and we will dedicate the next section to it .    explicit quantitative estimates for the detection rate @xmath147 of massive particles with @xmath148 ( with @xmath149 the usual hawking temperature ) can be obtained through the semiclassical tunneling formalism  @xcite .",
    "this gives the standard hawking result for massless particles , modulated by a factor which depends on the particle mass @xmath3 , the difference @xmath150 , the distance @xmath146 to the detector , and the black - hole spacetime profile @xmath151 .",
    "while the general expression is rather involved , it strongly simplifies when @xmath152 , with @xmath96 the radius of the horizon . in that case , one obtains the simple approximation @xmath153\\exp\\left[-\\frac{2x_d}{c}\\sqrt{m^2-\\omega^2}\\right]\\ ] ] ( in units such that @xmath14 , as before ) , with @xmath154 the standard hawking temperature .",
    "compared to the standard case , the probability that a massive particle with @xmath33 arrives at a distance @xmath146 decreases exponentially with @xmath146 , as expected .",
    "the study of hawking radiation in analogue - gravity systems opens up possibilities that are excluded in astrophysics .",
    "one can consider black- and white - hole horizons , which both produce hawking radiation , and indeed combinations of horizons that communicate with each other ( for example , the so - called black - hole laser  @xcite ) .",
    "one can also perform measurements on both sides of a horizon , so detection of both particles in a hawking pair and measurement of their correlation becomes possible .    the study of astrophysical black holes may lead to the simplistic view that there is a lower frequency ( energy ) threshold in the production of massive particles by horizons .",
    "this in turn would lead to the view that an analogue system where a field described by the klein - gordon equation experiences a horizon is a poor choice for observing the hawking effect . in reality",
    "the hawking radiation produced by the horizon is in no way suppressed by the mass , and such an analogue system is in this regard just as promising a candidate as one in which the field obeys the massless wave equation .",
    "the @xmath33 particles would be just as accessible to detection as the @xmath36 particles . in the case of a black - hole horizon",
    "the @xmath137 particles end up going into the `` black hole '' , whereas the @xmath155 particles propagate away from the other side of the horizon , but all can be detected .",
    "for a white - hole horizon , what happens depends on how the dispersion relation is modified at high @xmath27 in the particular analogue system",
    ". all real systems will be dispersive at the high @xmath27 values experienced by modes near the horizon and instead of sticking at the white - hole horizon the rays will drift away from the horizon on one side or the other depending on whether the dispersion is super - luminal or sub - luminal at high @xmath27 . again , there is no problem in principle in detecting all the particles , for all @xmath1 , in this white - hole case .    one may wonder whether the boomerang effect will not be mixed with the  possibly very complicated ",
    "dispersive high-@xmath27 behaviour near the horizon .",
    "two elements should be borne in mind .",
    "the first is that detailed studies based on rather general ( mainly `` subluminal '' , see e.g.  @xcite ) dispersion relations as well as for concrete systems with massless waves ( becs , surface waves , etc . )",
    "have shown that such potential ultraviolet problems do not spoil the hawking effect and a thermal spectrum can be recovered under quite general conditions on the velocity profiles . for becs , for example ,",
    "this is demonstrated starting from the bogoliubov  de gennes equations  @xcite , and the outcome can safely be expected to be independent of the masslessness or massiveness of the phonons .",
    "the second key point is that the boomerang effect is detectable as long as the background flow velocity @xmath10 is non - zero . in analogue systems",
    ", this region can be extended to a distance far beyond the immediate surroundings of the horizon , so that any complicated high-@xmath27 behaviour has been completely smoothened out .",
    "it remains to identify analogue - gravity systems where these ideas could be tested experimentally . in most analogue systems that have been considered the waves obey the massless wave equation at low wave - numbers ( with modifications at high wave - numbers ) .",
    "an exception is a recent study of acoustic waves in a rotating ion ring  @xcite where the discreteness of the ions leads to a dispersion relation at low @xmath27 that is not of the massless form , but these waves are not klein - gordon waves .",
    "we give three examples of systems where waves obey the klein - gordon equation and where the creation of horizons for the waves is possible .",
    "bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) are among the most discussed systems for analogue gravity .",
    "theoretically , they provide the advantage of being well - studied and rather well - understood , while experimentally they are clean and quite flexible .",
    "black hole configurations in a bec were recently realized for the first time  @xcite .",
    "the phonons that are obtained in standard becs are massless , but in  @xcite a scheme was described for producing a  massive \" phonon in a two - component bec . in the presence of a horizon created by a sub- to super - sonic flow these massive phonons",
    "should then behave as described above ( with an appropriate modification at high @xmath27 ) .",
    "the second example is langmuir waves in a moving plasma  @xcite .",
    "these waves have a dispersion relation of the form @xmath156 , with @xmath157 the plasma frequency and @xmath158 the debye radius .",
    "this is the klein - gordon dispersion relation with the cut - off frequency @xmath157 playing the role of mass .",
    "one obvious undesirable feature in this system is landau damping  @xcite of the waves , but all analogue - gravity systems present their own challenges .",
    "the third example is from barotropic waves  @xcite in fluid mechanics .",
    "barotropic waves are an assortment of waves in fluids with rotation , one type of which , known as inertia - gravity or poincar waves , has the klein - gordon dispersion relation  @xcite @xmath159 , where @xmath160 is the coriolis parameter , @xmath161 the gravitational acceleration and @xmath162 is the fluid depth . as in the previous examples ,",
    "a horizon can be created by a fluid flow .",
    "the presence of a lower frequency cutoff in the flat ( but not curved ) space - time dispersion relation is the feature of klein - gordon waves that leads to the interesting behaviour we have discussed in this paper .",
    "this lower cutoff is not unique to klein - gordon waves and we note another possible analogue - gravity system with waves that exhibit a lower frequency cutoff , namely one based on spin waves .",
    "spin waves  @xcite are propagating perturbations of the ordering in magnetic systems .",
    "these waves can have a variety of dispersion relations , depending on their particular type and propagation direction .",
    "the key points relevant to our present discussion are the following .",
    "first , several of these dispersion relations have the form @xmath163 , where @xmath164 ; there is therefore a lower frequency cutoff @xmath165 .",
    "second , a doppler shift of spin waves can be induced by the application of an electric current  @xcite , an effect that was demonstrated a few years ago  @xcite . in the presence of an electric current",
    "the dispersion relation becomes @xmath166 , with a doppler - shifted frequency @xmath31 , where @xmath10 is proportional to the current density  @xcite .",
    "one can therefore envisage creating horizons for spin waves using an electric current density that varies along the length of the sample due to a changing transverse area .",
    "further details of this proposal will be given elsewhere .",
    "the hawking effect for massive klein - gordon modes does not exhibit a lower frequency cutoff given by the mass .",
    "this does not contradict the obvious fact that black holes can not emit massive particles with @xmath36 to asymptotic infinity .",
    "we have shown in detail that massive modes with @xmath33 display a boomerang behaviour : after being emitted from the horizon they eventually turn around and are dragged back into the black hole .",
    "this bouncing , or blocking , behaviour is a familiar feature in analogue gravity in the context of waves with sub - luminal or super - luminal dispersion ( or a combination of both  @xcite ) at high wave numbers . in the klein - gordon case",
    "the interesting dispersive effects are at low wave numbers , but the same techniques of analysis reveal the behaviour .    the lesson that the hawking effect for klein - gordon modes is not suppressed compared to the massless case is an important one for analogue gravity . hawking radiation of klein - gordon modes in an analogue system is just as amenable to experimental detection as radiation of massless modes .",
    "analogue - gravity systems with klein - gordon waves are possible using two - component becs  @xcite , langmuir waves in plasmas and barotropic waves in fluid mechanics .",
