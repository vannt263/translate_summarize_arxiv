    "in a recent paper @xcite magnetic force microscopy ( mfm ) was employed to image and manipulate individual vortices in a single crystal yba@xmath0cu@xmath1o@xmath2 , directly measuring the interaction of a moving vortex with the local disorder potential .",
    "several unexpected results were obtained in that paper . in particular , the authors of ref .   found a dramatic enhancement of the response of a vortex to pulling when they wiggled it transversely .",
    "in addition , they discovered enhanced vortex pinning anisotropy in this crystal .",
    "these results demonstrate the power of mfm to probe microscopic defects that cause pinning and show that the described manipulations of an individual vortex provide a new powerful tool for studying the vortex dynamics and vortex pinning in type - ii superconductors .    in this paper",
    "we derive equations that govern the vortex dynamics under such mfm manipulations , and by solving these equations numerically , we provide some insight into the results of ref .  .",
    "consider a platelet - shaped biaxial anisotropic superconductor , with its crystalline c - axis being perpendicular to the plane of the platelet ( and the a and b axes in this plane ) .",
    "let there be a vortex directed along the c - axis in the sample .",
    "we denote this axis as the @xmath3 axis , and choose the @xmath4 and @xmath5 axes along the a and b axes of the crystal .",
    "mfm employs a sharp magnetic tip placed near the surface of the platelet .",
    "the tip magnetization exerts an attractive force @xmath6 on the vortex end .",
    "this force can shift the top of the vortex when the tip moves . on the other hand ,",
    "it is possible to measure @xmath7 at the tip , and this permits one to visualize the position of the top end of the vortex .",
    "@xcite let @xmath8 , @xmath9 be the position of the tip in the @xmath4-@xmath5 plane , while its height above the surface of the platelet be @xmath10 .",
    "we shall describe the shape of the vortex by the functions @xmath11 and @xmath12 with @xmath13 , the position of the vortex end at the surface is thus @xmath14 , @xmath15 .",
    "below we shall use the following dependence of the force @xmath6 on height @xmath10 and on the two - dimensional vector @xmath16 : @xcite @xmath17 where the constant @xmath18 ( @xmath19 is of the order of the london penetration depth ) , @xmath20 , @xmath21 is the flux quantum , @xmath22 is the magnetic monopole strength of the tip ( or the magnetic moment per unit length of a long narrow cylinder used as tip ) , and @xmath23 is the unit vector along the @xmath3 axis .",
    "this dependence is obtained if one considers the tip and the end of a straight vortex as magnetic monopoles of strengths @xmath22 and @xmath24 .",
    "@xcite the lateral component of @xmath6 , @xmath25 , gives the driving force acting on the vortex .",
    "the maximum of @xmath25 with respect to variations of @xmath26 is reached at @xmath27 and is equal to @xcite @xmath28 . in our following numerical calculations we shall use formula ( [ 1 ] ) even when the vortex is curved , and to describe the lateral component @xmath29 of the external driving force applied to a vortex segment which has the projection @xmath30 on the @xmath3-axis , we shall employ the model expression @xmath31 this expression can be justified if the change of the total lateral force @xmath25 on the scale @xmath19 in the @xmath4-@xmath5 plane is relatively small ( i.e. , if @xmath32 ) . however , in the case when the vortex shift @xmath33 caused by the tip is essentially larger than @xmath19 , this shift is practically independent of the specific form of the @xmath3-dependence of @xmath34 , see below .",
    "so , to clarify the physics without additional mathematical complications , below we shall always use the model dependences ( [ 1 ] ) and ( [ 2 ] ) .",
    "as it was mentioned above , measurement of @xmath35 is employed to visualize the vortex .",
    "equation ( [ 1 ] ) yields the following expression for this derivative : @xmath36 this derivative is maximum @xmath37 when the tip is just above the vortex , i.e. , when @xmath38 , and @xmath39 . on the other hand ,",
    "the maximum lateral force occurs when @xmath40 , and hence @xmath41 at this @xmath26 . in other words ,",
    "the maximum of the lateral force and the maximum of @xmath42 occur at different positions of the tip and of the vortex end .",
    "we shall consider the vortex as an elastic string . in the case of a biaxial superconductor",
    "the line tension of the vortex , @xmath43 , and the pinning force acting on its unit length , @xmath44 , were calculated in ref .  .",
    "the angles @xmath45 and @xmath46 define the direction of the vortex , i.e. , we shall describe this direction by the unit vector @xmath47 while the angle @xmath48 defines the direction of the pinning force or of the vortex distortion in the plane perpendicular to the vortex , fig .  1 .",

    "let us analyze the balance of the driving , the pinning , and the elastic forces applied to this segment .",
    "all these forces are perpendicular to it",
    ". however , to find the two functions @xmath11 and @xmath12 describing the vortex , it is convenient to carry out the analysis in the @xmath4-@xmath5 plane , projecting all the forces onto this plane .",

    "then , the _ first _ of two equations for @xmath11 and @xmath12 is @xmath81 where @xmath82 is the absolute value of the projection of the so - called critical force @xcite on the @xmath4-@xmath5 plane .",

    "this is due to the fact that the direction of the pinning force ( and hence of the critical force ) is not known in advance and is dictated by the direction of @xmath85 .",

    "( [ 11 ] ) and ( [ 12 ] ) for the case of the pinning force described by formulas ( [ 7 ] ) and ( [ 8 ] ) is presented in appendix [ a ] .",
    "finally , when the critical force @xmath95 is found , its projection @xmath82 on the @xmath4-@xmath5 plane is determined by the formula @xmath96 that follows from geometrical considerations .",
    "equation ( [ 9 ] ) is a differential equation since it contains the derivatives @xmath97 and @xmath98 originating from the elastic force .",
    "as in ref .  , we shall consider only sufficiently thick superconducting crystals in which the vortex as a whole does not shift , and only its upper part ( @xmath99 ) adjoining the @xmath4-@xmath5 surface moves , while the lower part ( @xmath100 ) is pinned .",
    "the boundary point @xmath101 of this upper part is determined by @xmath102 then , the boundary conditions to eq .  ( [ 9 ] ) are @xmath103 if these conditions were not fulfilled , the derivatives @xmath104 and @xmath105 would be discontinuous at the points @xmath106 and @xmath107 , and the elastic force @xmath108 would be singular there .",
    "@xcite in the most interesting case when @xmath109 ( and hence @xmath110 ) , one can put @xmath111 . in this limiting case",
    "the driving force @xmath6 is applied to the vortex only at its surface point ( @xmath112,@xmath113 ) .",
    "then , in equation ( [ 9 ] ) the force @xmath114 can be omitted , @xmath83 coincides with @xmath115 , and the driving force @xmath6 only modifies the boundary condition ( [ 16 ] ) .",
    "now the integration of the forces over the thickness of the surface layer gives @xmath116 this result shows that at small @xmath19 the vortex dynamics is practically independent of the distribution of the driving force @xmath6 over the surface layer of thickness @xmath19 .",
    "equation ( [ 9 ] ) alone is not sufficient to find the two functions @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "we now derive a _ second _ equation for these functions . when the position of the tip changes , the vortex begins to move in the direction @xmath94 in the plane perpendicular to the vortex .",
    "this movement of the vortex in the perpendicular plane corresponds to its shift at an angle @xmath117 ( measured from the @xmath4 axis ) in the @xmath4-@xmath5 plane .",
    "a geometrical consideration shows that this angle @xmath118 is determined by @xmath119 thus , changes of the functions @xmath11 and @xmath12 in time are connected by the relation @xmath120 this is a second equation for the functions @xmath11 and @xmath12 . since the time @xmath121 can be expressed in terms of the known functions @xmath122 , @xmath123 that describe the shift of the tip , eq .",

    "this situation is reminiscent of the case that occurs in the theory of the critical states of type - ii superconductors when the external magnetic field @xmath127 applied to a superconducting sample changes in a complex way.@xcite in this case the critical states are different for different histories @xmath128 with the same final value of @xmath127 .",
    "equations ( [ 1])-([19 ] ) describe the vortex dynamics in thick superconducting crystals when the tip moves in its @xmath4-@xmath5 plane .",
    "we solve these equations in the next section .",
    "the equations of the previous section show that if the driving - force density @xmath129 at the surface of the superconductor , @xmath107 , is lower than a certain threshold @xmath130 where @xmath131 is the angle of @xmath114 relative to the @xmath4 axis , the vortex remains pinned , i.e. , @xmath132 . in particular , if the driving force acts along the @xmath4 or @xmath5 direction , we obtain the following thresholds : @xmath133 and @xmath134 , respectively , which coincide with the appropriate pinning forces . here",
    "we have used the formulas of appendix a and the fact that @xmath135 at the experimental value @xcite of @xmath136 .",

    "however , @xmath152 , @xmath153 are not necessarily small in an experiment . in this case",
    "formulas ( [ 21 ] ) , strictly speaking , have no region of applicability .",
    "moreover , boundary conditions ( [ 17 ] ) show that the characteristic tilt angle @xmath45 is not small at typical experimental values of @xmath154 pn even when @xmath155 pn .",
    "so we do not assume in this paper that @xmath156 .",

    "then , taking into account the model dependence ( [ 2 ] ) for the driving force density @xmath129 , one finds that equations ( [ 9 ] ) and ( [ 19 ] ) for @xmath11 and @xmath12 , as well as the boundary condition ( [ 17 ] ) , become independent of the absolute values of @xmath183 , @xmath51 , and @xmath19 .",
    "they depend only on the dimensionless forces @xmath184 and the dimensionless parameter @xmath185 .",
    "thus , in a certain sense fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] is universal .",
    "but in this scaling procedure one has to bear in mind that if one changes the parameter @xmath19 keeping a fixed value of @xmath184 , this leads to a change of the tip position @xmath8 , @xmath9 which is not scaled with @xmath19 , see eq .",
    "( [ 1 ] ) .",

    "thus , a more detailed theoretical investigation of the driving force and the nonlocal line tension near the surface is needed .",
    "one more problem that should be studied both theoretically and experimentally is the vortex - motion randomness that is superimposed on the regular vortex motion considered here .",
