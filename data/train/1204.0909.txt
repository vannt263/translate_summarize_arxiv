    "large scale redshift surveys of galaxies reveal a hierarchy of structure that extends out to hundreds of megaparsecs , yet a homogeneous cosmological model lies at the core of our understanding of how the universe evolves .",
    "such an assumption works incredibly well , as can be seen from current analyses of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) .",
    "the linearly perturbed friedmann  lematre  robertson  walker ( flrw ) model can fit observations of the cmb with exquisite precision @xcite .",
    "nevertheless we can not avoid the fact that the universe is inhomogeneous , especially on small scales .",
    "indeed , as a first approximation , space looks empty , with nuggets of mass and energy clustered together to form an intricate cosmic web .",
    "it is quite possible that the smooth description of space emerges as the average behaviour of a fundamentally inhomogeneous universe ( cf .",
    "this is an operation that we are familiar with closer to home , when we describe a gas or liquid through their macroscopic properties instead of through a detailed atomistic description .",
    "we would like to be able to do the same for the universe , i.e. to infer the smooth , large scale ( macroscopic ) properties of space time from cosmological observations without having to worry about the discreteness of its constituents on small scales .",
    "we attempt to reconcile such an observation with a homogeneous universe by saying that our local , granular point of view is merely the small scale limit of the description given by the @xmath0-cold dark matter ( @xmath0cdm ) cosmology .",
    "we then assume that on large scales , @xmath0cdm is accurately described by a smooth cosmological fluid which on small scales fragments into particle dark matter and forms halos .",
    "some have expressed strong concerns about the validity of such an approach ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) , especially because it is not clear whether the inhomogeneities on small scales will radically affect the large scale dynamics of the universe ( see @xcite ",
    "@xcite , but see also @xcite for counterexamples ) .",
    "there are a number of interesting and important issues that must be addressed when tackling this problem . in this paper",
    "we wish to focus on one : how inhomogeneities can affect the inferred optical properties of the universe .",
    "this problem has been looked at before , throughout the 1960s @xcite  @xcite and 1970s @xcite  @xcite , and more recently @xcite ",

    "one might expect , _ a priori _ , that studying the effect of inhomogeneities on ( @xmath1 , @xmath2 ) is pointless : in 1976 , weinberg @xcite claimed that the overall ( @xmath1 , @xmath2 ) for an inhomogeneous universe should , on the whole , match that of the average homogeneous universe .",
    "views are somewhat divided on the validity of weinberg s argument and its generality , with cosmologists tending to accept it wholesale , while some relativists are slightly more sceptical and question its assumptions ( cf .",

    "our approach is based entirely on the sachs equations . within the framework of these equations ,",
    "we study different aspects of the redshift - distance relation .",
    "this is a complementary procedure to what is usually done .",
    "our approach will be to use a number of different approximate models : high resolution n - body simulations , halo models , and a variety of swiss cheese models with lematre - tolman - bondi inhomogeneities .    while what we find is not , as yet , definitive",
    ", it does shed light on how important the effects of inhomogeneities might be .",
    "the paper is structured as follows . in section [ maths ]",
    "we present the sachs equations and their various limits . in section [ r ]",
    "we look at the effect of ricci focusing , in section [ wsigma ] we study the impact of shear , and in section [ sofz ] we attempt to include local fluctuations in the expansion rate . in each of these sections",
    ", we need to consider different models for inhomogeneities . in section [ disc ]",
    "we discuss our results .",
    "the sachs optical equations describe the evolution of optical quantities , the expansion of the null bundle @xmath3 and its shear @xmath4 @xcite @xmath5 where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are respectively the ricci and weyl tensors , @xmath8 is the null vector and @xmath9 is perpendicular to @xmath8 and is confined to a surface tangent to a wave front . in the gravitational lensing nomenclature , ` shear ' normally refers to the image distortion @xmath10 .",
    "these two quantities are related but are not the same , and in order to avoid any confusion , we will always refer to @xmath4 as to the _ shearing _ ( for a detailed set of equations that relates these two quantities , see @xcite ) .",

    "first of all , the smaller the smoothing radius , the larger the variance , although even with the 1.25 mpc smoothing radius we get a smaller standard deviation than was obtained within the framework of linear approximation .",
    "also , note that the maximum of the pdf lies on the demagnification side ( i.e. @xmath62 ) , so a random object is most likely to be dimmer than on average .",

    "we now extend our analysis to investigate the role of smoothing and the effect of weyl focusing on the optical properties of the universe .",
    "when dealing with the weyl focusing , it is not straightforward to link density fields with the weyl curvature .",
    "an ideal situation would be to have an exact generic solution of the einstein field equations , and use that to model the evolution and effects of the weyl curvature .",
    "since there is no such a solution , in practise we must always employ some approximations . here",
    "we will evaluate the weyl focusing within the _ halo _ model .",
    "simply put , the halo model considered here consists of a universe filled with different halos of masses above @xmath77 , while the rest of the mass density ( in objects of masses below this threshold ) is assumed to be distributed homogeneously .",
    "the halo model we use closely follows the construction outlined in detail in ref .",
    "each halo is described by the navarro - frenk - white ( nfw ) density profile @xcite ,    @xmath78    where @xmath79 is the radius of the halo , defined as @xmath80 with @xmath81 , and @xmath82 ( the halo is defined as an overdensity of mass @xmath83 , whose constant density contrast is 180 with respect to the mean matter density , cf .",

    "the halo model allows us to address the problem of smoothing  instead of dealing with a continuous density field , we now have a discrete set of dark matter halos  although one should keep in mind that , given the characteristics described above , this is not really a completely ` discrete ' model .",
    "it also allows us to take into account the effect of the shearing , by assuming that the weyl focusing for a particular halo , @xmath94 , is calculated using the lematre ",
    "tolman ( lt ) model @xcite ( an exact general relativistic model of an spherically symmetric , inhomogeneous , non - stationary space time ) @xcite @xmath95 where @xmath96 is the impact parameter , @xmath79 is the areal radius , @xmath97 we apply the weak field approximations ( cf . ref .",
    "@xcite ) and assume that the total weyl focusing is a sum over all contributors , @xmath98 .",
    "note that , outside the halo , @xmath99 , and so only halos that are close to the light ray contribute most significantly .",
    "we again solve eq .",
    "( [ dsr ] ) for @xmath45 different lines of sight .",
    "the ricci and weyl focusing are calculated using the halo model , while @xmath35 is assumed to be the same as in the flrw background model [ see the first term of ( [ flrwlimit ] ) ] . the resulting distribution for @xmath49 is presented in fig . [ fig2 ]",
    "( thick solid curve ) .",
    "as expected , the variance is much larger than when the smoothed millennium maps were used . also , the maximum is shifted more towards positive values of @xmath49 .",
    "the mean , as before , is still negligible , at @xmath100 .    for comparison , and to gain a better understanding of the different factors ,",
    "we now consider rather unphysical variations of the halo model .",
    "the first variation is when we neglect the shearing  when solving ( [ dsr ] ) , we put @xmath101 .",
    "the result of this is shown as the dashed line in fig .",
    "as can be seen , it is significantly shifted to the magnification side ( positive @xmath49 )  the mean is @xmath102 .",
    "this shows that , when considering the halo model , the role of the shearing should not be neglected when calculating the distance correction .    to better understand the relation between the halo model and the smoothed millennium density fields , we can study two more unconventional modifications of the halo model . in order to reduce the level of discreteness of the halo model",
    ", we decrease the value of the parameter @xmath103 , which results in larger halos and a lower amplitude of the halo density profiles . in the first case we reduce @xmath103 to @xmath75 , which means that the radius of the halo increases by roughly @xmath104 . in the second case ,",
    "we reduce @xmath103 to @xmath76 , which results in a @xmath105 increase in the halo s radius and @xmath82 has @xmath106 kpc [ this follows from ( [ halorad ] ) ] , for @xmath107 and @xmath108 , @xmath109 kpc and @xmath110 kpc respectively . ] .",
    "we plot these results as dotted lines in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] . as can be seen , when we increase the halo radii ( and",
    "hence decrease the degree of discreteness ) , we approach the results obtained when using the smoothed millennium maps .",
    "so far , the results reveal the same pattern : a skewed distribution with a maximum at the demagnification side ( @xmath111 ) .",
    "this can easily be understood within the framework of the weak lensing formula ( [ dwl ] ) : when light rays pass through the large - scale structure , they are more likely to propagate through voids than through more dense , compact structures .",
    "therefore , it is more likely to have @xmath112 along the line of sight and , as follows from ( [ dwl ] ) , @xmath113 .",
    "this is clearly visible when we use the smoothed millennium maps",
    ". if the smoothing scale is sufficiently large , the resulting density field approaches a gaussian field ( all non - linearities are washed away , and we recover symmetry between overdense and underdense regions ) , and so the maximum approaches zero ( for pure gaussian fluctuations @xmath114 ) . in the halo model , we deal with halos that are very compact and occupy a relatively small volume , which makes propagation through voids even more likely to occur .",
    "we therefore see a shift of @xmath115 towards higher demagnification ( see fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) .",
    "occasionally , light rays pass close to a halo , and then both the ricci and weyl focusing magnify the light bundle .",
    "thus , on average , the total balance is recovered , and the mean of @xmath49 is almost zero ( in the lensing framework , as seen in ( [ dwl ] ) , due to matter conservation it is exactly zero ) . here",
    "we find a mean of order @xmath74 . a small deviation from the expected value in the flrw model is expected . for example",
    "the analogue of the integrated sachs - wolfe effect will affect the redshift , and thus @xmath116 .",
    "also , the local environment plays a role  note that our observer is located inside an inhomogeneity ( i.e. not within a homogeneous region ) ",
    "see footnote on page 6 .",
    "the same pattern has also been reported in previous studies ",
    "see for example in @xcite , and in ray tracing though n - body simulations .",
    "in fact , our halo model provides very good agreement with the ray tracing through the millennium simulation , cf .",
    "it is also in almost perfect agreement with the pdf generated using the turbogl code@xcite , the zero - shear pdf , apart from a small change in its amplitude , looks like the translation of the nonzero - shear pdf . ] .",
    "the results are therefore consistent with the most commonly - implemented procedures , where the effects of inhomogeneities on light propagation are calculated using the magnification matrix approach . in almost all cases ,",
    "one further assumes that light propagates on unperturbed geodesics , and so the redshift ( to a source located at some fixed comoving distance ) is calculated as in the background homogeneous models , while inhomogeneities only affect the magnification / demagnification .",
    "so far , we have been doing the same ( that is , we assumed that @xmath35 is the same as in the background flrw model ) .",
    "we therefore examine the effect of changing @xmath35 in the next section .",
    "the last effect that remains to be examined is related to @xmath35 .",
    "so far we have been applying the flrw formula , but as shown in ( [ sodz ] ) , to calculate it correctly we need to solve null geodesics .",
    "we now address this point by studying light propagation within the lt swiss cheese model .",
    "the advantage of the lt model is that it is an exact model , and so no approximations are required when modelling the light propagation , evolution of perturbations , or the weyl curvature .",
    "the disadvantage is that each particular inhomogeneity must be spherically symmetric , and we do not have the freedom to mimic the millennium density profile .",

    "quantitatively , however , the variance is much smaller than in previous cases .",

    "[ fig3 ] to the lower left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ( the ` mild ' swiss cheese case ) .    to bring us closer to the millennium case ,",

    "the first qualitative difference is that the maximum is now at _ negative _ @xmath49 ( magnification ) .",
    "secondly , due to large fluctuations in the density field , the variance is larger , and is comparable with the @xmath44 millennium density field ( dotted - dashed line in fig . [ fig4 ] ) .",
    "the surprising result is that the maximum is on the magnification side ( @xmath129 ) .",
    "such a phenomenon has not been reported before .",
    "let us closely examine what could lead to such an unexpected behaviour .",
    "three working hypotheses can be put forward to explain this : ( 1 ) the effect of the weyl focusing , ( 2 ) the problem with collapsing regions , ( 3 ) an artefact of the symmetry of the density contrast . with regards to the shearing ,",
    "we have seen in the previous section , when comparing the halo model with and without the weyl focusing , that if @xmath130 , the pdf shifts to lower values of @xmath49 . however , as seen from fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] , the role of the weyl focusing for our swiss cheese models is small ( cf .",
    "@xcite and @xcite for a similar conclusion regarding the role of the weyl focusing in this type of model ) .",
    "essentially , if the density contrast is not high ( unlike in the halo model ; compare the upper right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] with the lower right panel ) , the role of the weyl focusing is small ( compare the set of 3 solid lines with the set of 3 dashed or dotted lines in fig . [ fig5 ] ) .",
    "we therefore conclude that the shear can not be responsible for the shift of @xmath115 from demagnification to the magnification side .",
    "this can be confirmed by re - running the same model with @xmath4 set to zero  the resulting pdf is exactly the same as in the case of @xmath130 ( solid line in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ) .",
    "our second hypothesis involves considering the role of collapsing regions . in this case , @xmath131 , which may strongly affect @xmath35 . in the real universe , whenever the density field has a high amplitude , cosmic structures are virialised , and hence they are not collapsing .",
    "unfortunately , there is no rotation within the lt model , which could prevent the collapse .",
    "therefore , as seen in the lower right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , the expansion is negative within the wall . in order to ` correct ' the model for the virialisation effect ,",
    "whenever the expansion rate is negative , we assume that the structure is already virialised and so the redshift does not change within this region .",
    "that is , we assume that @xmath132 in these regions , whereas in all other regions we use the exact formula , i.e. @xmath133 .",
    "we should exercise caution when analysing these results , as this ` correction ' was done by hand .",
    "the fact that some regions are virialised , and hence @xmath132 , is not a consequence of a model , and so there is clearly an issue of self - consistency . the resulting pdf is presented using a dashed line in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , where we find that the maximum of the curve is shifted even further towards negative values of @xmath49 .",
    "the mean is almost twice as large as before , @xmath134 .",
    "clearly this does not explain why @xmath135 , and in fact it makes things even ` worse ' .",
    "our final hypothesis concerns the symmetry of the density perturbations .",
    "we can already see that this can not be the cause , as @xmath136 for the ` mild ' swiss cheese model .",
    "nevertheless , we return to the millennium smoothed maps and perform further tests .",
    "we proceed as before , with the only difference being that , when solving @xmath35 , we no longer assume a uniform expansion rate as in ( [ flrwlimit ] ) , but instead assume that @xmath137 where @xmath138 is the expansion rate of the background model . in general    @xmath139 where @xmath140 is",
    "the matter scalar of the expansion and @xmath141 is the shear of the matter velocity field .",
    "we further work under the assumption of zero shear and so we only consider fluctuations in the expansion field , which in the linear regime are given by @xmath142 here , @xmath89 is the growth function , @xmath143 .",
    "this method has thus 2 limitations , and works well as long as ( 1 ) the density contrast is not too high and ( 2 ) the matter shear is negligible .",
    "we proceed further with this toy model , as it will bring more insight into results obtained within the exact lt model .",
    "naively , one can think of this as follows : because @xmath144 , we should expect ( qualitatively ) the same results as before , except for a potentially larger variance due to the presence of both @xmath118 and @xmath119 .",

    "this leads us to question : if we recover the average @xmath35 correctly , will we obtain the correct mean of the distance , without the need for a detailed calculation of the ricci and weyl focusing ?    we study this issue within the halo and @xmath41 models , as they have the largest deviation of @xmath163 .",

    "the average of the expansion rate fluctuations calculated on a slice of constant @xmath1 is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] . before proceeding further , we must comment on one important aspect of our computations .",
    "cosmologists tend to use the redshift as a proxy for time , so they express the evolution of different fields in terms of the redshift , for example : @xmath164 only in the case of perfect homogeneity do we have that @xmath165 ( the proxy for time , i.e. the redshift of a photon at a given time in a perfect homogeneous model ) coincides with @xmath1 ( the actual shift of the photon s frequency ) .",
    "thus , in solving the sachs equations , one must solve the following : @xmath166 we solve these , and plot the results as dotted lines in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] . as can be seen ,",
    "the difference between the actual value , and that obtained from the above set of equations , is of order of @xmath167 , ( as before , where we set @xmath35 to its value in the background @xmath0cdm model ) . for comparison ,",
    "we solve the above equation with @xmath168 this time , the result ( given by the dashed line ) is significantly displaced to the left .",
    "the reason for the shift towards higher magnification is that if @xmath169 then , as follows from ( [ approxsetd ] ) , we have that @xmath170 , and so if we replace @xmath165 with @xmath1 , we increase the ricci focusing , hence higher magnification .",
    "this simple exercise shows that if one is interested in having an average @xmath171 without having to worry about the ricci or weyl focusing , one can simply use the average @xmath35 of one s model .",
    "caution must be taken , though , when studying models in which @xmath46 is not proportional to @xmath156 .",
    "such models include , for example , gpc - scale inhomogeneous lt models increases outwards , which results in the decrease of the expansion rate along the past null cone , hence the dimming of the supernova within the giant voids is caused by the change of the @xmath35 relation . whereas for the giant hump models @xmath46 decreases outwards making the ricci focusing less efficient , and hence causing additional dimming . ] and some backreaction models .    in this section",
    "we have tested all 3 factors that affect the relation between @xmath1 and @xmath2 via the sachs equation : @xmath33 , @xmath34 , and @xmath35 . in order to model them in a self - consistent manner",
    ", we used the lt swiss cheese model . in all cases",
    ", we found that the distance does not change , on average , by more than @xmath167 ( at @xmath172 ) .",
    "this result is fairly consistent with what has been found by other groups who have employed exact models , and ensured the proper randomization of light rays @xcite ] ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "our main motivation has been to follow , as closely as possible , the standard procedures to test self - consistency and the impact of inhomogeneities on the optical properties of the universe within models that follow the flrw evolution . nevertheless , it is not completely obvious that one should recover the flrw results for these models , unless one completely agrees with weinberg s reasoning .",
    "if one _ does _ take weinberg s results at face value , then our @xmath167 results should be considered as a _ big _ deviation , about two orders of magnitude larger than what is allowed by the analogue of the integrated sachs wolfe effect ( which should be of order @xmath173 ) .    from one point of view",
    ", our results have turned out to be quite surprising . in the case of large fluctuations in the density and expansion fields , the mode of @xmath49 shifts to the magnification side .",
    "such a behaviour has not been reported before .",
    "the effect is only visible if the degree of inhomogeneity is large  for small amplitude swiss cheese models , we recover the standard results .",
    "this can be explained using the same ` voids argument ' that we used in the case of the weak lensing approximation  since the structures in the universe form a cosmic web , it is more likely for photons to propagate through voids ( hence the position of the mode is associated with the amount of void regions ) . as seen from ( [ dwl ] ) ,",
    "the weak lensing regime is only sensitive to density fluctuations , and so the mode is positive .",
    "if we introduce fluctuations in the expansion rate , then the redshift decreases , as seen from ( [ sofzdh ] ) .",
    "hence an object located at the same distance has a higher redshift , and thus gives the impression of being magnified compared to the homogeneous case  when the redshift increases faster than in the homogeneous case , the slope decreases .",
    "see , for example , fig .",
    "4 of @xcite , which shows the change of the slope in the relation @xmath116 , depending on fluctuations in the density and expansion rate . ] .",
    "this is the reason why the mode is now on the magnification side .    a valid point , and one worth further investigation ,",
    "is related to the fact that , due to the virialisation of high density regions , the average expansion rate may deviate from the background value .",
    "this was already pointed out in @xcite in the context of backreaction models , although as shown in @xcite , the presence of matter shear may decrease the backreaction effect , leaving the evolution of the average quantities relatively unchanged . nevertheless , in such cases",
    ", the 3d volume average on surfaces of constant time may not coincide with the average on slices of constant @xmath1 . as a result , as we have shown above , we would still expect a change in the redshift - distance relation .",
    "however , we reiterate that care should be taken in interpreting these results ",
    "changing @xmath30 by hand may not lead to self consistent results ( although keeping the expansion rate uniform may also turn out to be inconsistent ) . to test this phenomenon more closely ,",
    "we require exact models that allow for virialisation .",
    "the lt models are definitely not suitable for such a study .",
    "the overarching question that we wish to address is : does the flrw model , which correctly describes the evolution of the background , correctly recover ( on average ) the distance - redshift relation ? our results , while not entirely conclusive , are suggestive .",
    "we have explored a suite of models which are inhomogeneous , but close to the flrw .",
    "we find that , if the background model correctly describes the evolution of the average expansion rate and the average matter density , then indeed the homogeneous model is a good approximation .",
    "our results show that ricci focusing alone introduces deviations from the average value .",
    "the pdf is skewed and the maximum is on the demagnification side ( a random object will most likely be dimmer than the average ) .",
    "the change of the mean is negligible , which means that , on average , distances coincide with the expected distance in the background model .",
    "the deviation from the average ( for a particular line of sight ) depends crucially on the smoothing scale and , unsurprisingly , the smaller the smoothing scale , the larger the deviation .",
    "we find that weyl focusing is important for objects with very high density contrast , and yet even in this case , the bias in the mean of @xmath49 is negligibly small .",
    "we also find that the presence of large fluctuations in the expansion rate also affects the final results : there is a slight shift of the maximum of the pdf towards the magnification side ( a random object will most likely be brighter than the average ) , and the variance changes . in particular , we find that if the average expansion rate deviates from the background expansion rate , the distance ( on average ) changes by a few percent . in the real universe , such a situation may occur in the late non - linear stage of evolution , where large voids expand much faster than the background , while virialised over - dense regions do not expand at all ( for these fluctuations to cancel each other , at some stage the presence of collapsing regions is required ) .    in summary",
    ", we have studied the various biases that cosmological inhomogeneities can introduce into the inferred optical properties of the universe by considering a range of toy models .",
    "there are , of course , limitations to the accuracy and self - consistency of these models , and how well they mimic the real universe .",
    "we find that the presence of inhomogeneities ( around a fixed background ) changes distances by at most a few percent , although the average is closely related to the background model .",
    "the only possible deviation of the average of the distance from the distance predicted by the background model is in situations where the background model does not correctly describe the evolution of the average quantities .",
    "the lessons we have learned can be summarized in the form of a message to our readers . for cosmologists",
    ", we would like to point out that , with the increasing precision of cosmological observations , a change of few percent might soon become important for accurate estimation of cosmological parameters ( cf .",
    "in particular , the pdfs are skewed and hence , for a limited number of observational data , there might be a bias due to the fact that the mode does not coincide with the mean , or median . for relativists , we would argue that , to study the effect of inhomogeneities on observations , it is first important to understand how much inhomogeneities affect the evolution of the background model .",
    "such a study should focus on @xmath33 and @xmath174 , and especially on potential deviations from ( [ flrwevo ] ) , as this has the biggest impact on the distance - redshift relation ( see , for example , fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] for a few percent change in the case where @xmath175 ( cf .",
    "thus , pinning down @xmath33 and @xmath174 will also provide the average of @xmath171 , without the need to account for the weyl focusing or to model complex aspects of the ricci focusing ) .",
