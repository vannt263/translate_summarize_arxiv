    "bok globules @xcite are small ( @xmath1 pc ) , isolated clouds , some of which are sites of low- and intermediate - mass star formation @xcite .",
    "they have been observed to be in different evolutionary stages , from starless dark cores @xcite to sites hosting t - tauri stars @xcite .",
    "these globules have traditionally been considered important laboratories for the study of star formation processes , since their small size and relative simplicity make these processes less likely to be affected by confusion from different generations of young stellar objects .",
    "another important aspect of star formation in bok globules is that it may explain the somewhat puzzling existence of pre - main - sequence objects apparently not related with known molecular clouds .",
    "at least some of these objects may have originated in already dispersed bok globules @xcite .    among the observational tools used in star - formation studies , water masers have proved to be a very powerful one .",
    "water maser emission at 22 ghz is a good tracer of mass - loss activity in young stars @xcite . in the low - mass young stellar objects ( ysos )",
    "this signpost of mass loss phenomena occurs in their most embedded phase , at the earliest stages of evolution .",
    "this period is characterized by the presence of the disk / young stellar object / outflow system @xcite and a large amount of circumstellar dust . in the low - mass ysos framework",
    ", the youngest evolutionary stage is represented by class 0 sources @xcite , which show the most powerful and collimated molecular outflows ( e.g. , @xcite , and references therein ) , centimeter emission ( e.g. @xcite ) , and host strong submillimeter and millimeter continuum emission @xcite .",
    "water maser studies have shown that this emission provides a good characterization of the age of low - mass ysos ( e.g. @xcite ) , with class 0 sources being the most probable candidates to harbor water maser emission , due to the interaction of powerful jets with a larger amount of circumstellar material .",
    "this fact makes sources that host water maser emission good candidates for being in a very early stage of its evolution .",
    "in addition , several water maser surveys towards low - mass ysos have shown that this emission tends to be located close ( within several hundred au ) to the central powering source @xcite .",
    "these characteristics make the water maser phenomenon well - suited to derive information about the location of the exciting source of the mass - loss phenomena observed in young star forming regions . moreover",
    ", maser emission can be a useful tool for studying the physical conditions and kinematics of the gas surrounding the most embedded ysos at very high angular resolution ( @xmath2 1 mas ) , due to the very specific conditions which pump the maser emission ( hundreds of k and n@xmath3 @xmath4 ) @xcite .",
    "these conditions can be generated in shocked gas compressed by winds @xcite , as well as in circumstellar disks @xcite .",
    "this dichotomy has also been suggested to be a possible evolutionary sequence , with water masers tracing gravitationally bound material ( e.g. , circumstellar disks ) in the youngest sources , and outflows in more evolved ysos @xcite .",
    "recently , the hot dense infalling gas after the accretion shock has also been proposed as a good environment for pumping the maser emission @xcite .    therefore , there are different evolutionary aspects related to water maser emission ( e.g. , the likely occurrence of masers in class 0 ysos , and their association with either disks and jets ) .",
    "bok globules are appropriate sites to study evolution of ysos , since they are usually identified as dark patches in optical images , without any selection criterion related to possible star - forming activity ( @xcite , hereafter cb ; @xcite ) , and therefore they may span a large range of evolutionary stages .",
    "surprisingly , studies of water masers in bok globules are relatively scarce .",
    "recently , our group undertook a sensitive and systematic single - dish survey for water masers in 207 positions within bok globules @xcite , using nasa s 70 m antenna in robledo de chavela ( spain ) , which provided six new detections in , , , , , and . before this survey , only @xcite conducted a search for water masers specifically in bok globules , with 80 target positions and only one detection towards .",
    "other surveys for water masers included some bok globules within their target positions ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , although they did not find any detection in these types of sources .    using as a reference the catalogs of bok globules of cb in the northern hemisphere , and @xcite in the southern one ( probably the more complete ones available ) , we are only aware of 9 bok globules in those catalogs that are apparently associated with water maser emission : the six new detections mentioned above in the survey by @xcite , the detection towards cb 3 reported by @xcite , as well as the detections obtained by @xcite and @xcite in and respectively . all these reported detections of masers in bok globules present single - dish data .",
    "however , interferometric high - angular resolution observations are necessary to pinpoint accurately the actual pumping source of water maser emission among several candidates , and to determine whether maser emission in these bok globules tends to trace collimated jets or circumstellar disks .    in this paper we present for the first time interferometric ,",
    "high - angular resolution observations using the very large array ( vla ) of the national radio astronomy observatory of some of these water masers in bok globules .",
    "this paper is structured as follows : in  2 we describe our observations and data processing ; in  3 we present our observational results and we discuss them ; we summarize our conclusions in  4 .",
    "we present interferometric observations using the vla in the bok globules in which water masers were detected in the survey by @xcite between 2002 april and 2003 may ( i.e. , cb 54 , cb 65 , cb 101 , and cb 232 ) , as well as cb 3 @xcite and cb 205 @xcite .",
    "the interferometric data have been complemented with a multimolecular single - dish study at millimeter and centimeter wavelengths using the iram-30 m and robledo-70 m antenna of cb 101 ( iras 17503@xmath00833 ) and cb 65 ( iras 16277@xmath02332 ) , in order to better understand the nature of these sources , and determine the internal structure of their surrounding region .",

    "we detected water maser emission in cb 54 , cb 101 , and cb 232 ( see table  [ tbl - masers ] ) , but we did not detect any emission towards either cb 65 or cb 205 . in the case of cb 101 and cb 232 ,",
    "maser data were self - calibrated , and spectral hanning smoothing was applied ( to alleviate ringing in the bandpass ) , which provides a final velocity resolution of @xmath9 1.3 km s@xmath8 .",
    "the continuum data of these two sources were cross - calibrated using the self - calibration solutions obtained for the stronger maser lines .",

    "cb 3 is located at the near side of the perseus arm , at a distance of @xmath28 2.5 kpc @xcite .",
    "this globule shows a highly luminous fir / submillimeter dust condensation ( @xmath29 = 930 @xmath30 ) , and it seems to be associated with intermediate - mass star formation @xcite .",
    "several sources in different stages of evolution have been identified in cb 3 : the young stellar object , which corresponds to @xcite , a near - infrared source , , that was proposed to be a class ii source @xcite , and a millimeter source , @xcite , cataloged by @xcite as a probable class 0 object , which also shows submillimeter emission @xcite .",
    "this bok globule is associated with a bipolar molecular outflow elongated in the northeast - southwest direction @xcite , of which cb 3-mm was proposed to be the driving source @xcite .",
    "the co channel maps reveal different clumps along its main axis , which suggest episodic mass loss @xcite .",
    "there are four h@xmath7 emission knots , projected towards the blueshifted lobe of the outflow , and whose distribution does not follow a straight line ( see fig .",
    "[ cb3h2maser ] ) , probably due to precession of the outflow axis @xcite .",
    "our vla maser spectrum is shown in fig .",
    "[ cb3h2maser ] .",
    "water maser emission in this source was first detected by @xcite , although the position reported with those single - dish observations is shifted @xmath28 ( 30@xmath20 , @xmath060@xmath20 ) from our vla position .",
    "at least five independent spectral features are evident in the vla maser spectrum ( fig .",
    "[ cb3h2maser ] ) , which we designated as a , b , c , d , and e on table  [ tbl - masers ] , and are centered at @xmath31 , @xmath051.4 , @xmath057.4 , @xmath067.2 , and @xmath078.4 km s@xmath8 respectively .",
    "component d may in its turn be composed of two individual features , but they are blended together , given our spectral resolution .",
    "all except component a are blueshifted with respect to the cloud velocity ( @xmath32=@xmath038.3 km s@xmath8 , @xcite ) . the five maser features delineate a spatial structure of @xmath28 0@xmath331 elongated from northeast to southwest ( see fig .  [ cb3h2maser ] ) . assuming that the emission from a given velocity channel is dominated by a single component",
    ", its position can be determining with high accuracy .",
    "therefore , the linear structure observed is real and it is likely to be tracing the base of a jet , since the relative positional uncertainty ( @xmath34 0@xmath33007 , see fourth column in table  [ tbl - masers ] ) of the emission for individual maser spectral features is better than the total size of the structure ( @xmath28  0@xmath331 ; see fig .",
    "[ cb3h2maser ] ) .",
    "the emission corresponding to the velocity closest to that of the cloud ( feature a ) occupies the southern part of the structure , while that of the most blueshifted one ( e ) is located at the north .",
    "the maser emission is aligned in the same direction than the blueshifted molecular outflow , and it is located @xmath28 5  south of the position of cb3-mm reported by @xcite , between this source and the northernmost h@xmath7 knot observed by @xcite ( see fig .  [ cb3h2maser ] ) .",
    "however , the mm observations were made with a beamsize of @xmath35 , so it is possible that both mm and water maser emission actually come from the same location , which would be more accurately traced by the masers .",
    "the proximity of the masers to the mm source is consistent with the idea that the yso traced by this source is exciting the water masers and probably powering the molecular outflow . nevertheless ,",
    "although this mm source is the best candidate , we can not rule out the existence of another embedded source closer to the masers , and higher resolution observations at millimeter and submillimeter wavelengths are needed in order to clarify this point .    in fig .",
    "[ cb3axis - model ] we have represented the position - velocity diagram of the maser emission along the major axis of the maser structure , by considering the centroids of the maser emission for each velocity channel .",
    "we note that although these centroids are not independent spectral features , spatio - kinematical information of the gas traced by water masers can be derived from the analysis of these centroids , under the assumption that each velocity channel there is a single dominant component .",
    "this diagram shows an interesting wave - like distribution , similar to that observed in afgl 2591 @xcite .",
    "@xcite , based on the relative spatial distribution of h@xmath7 knots with respect to the powering source , suggested the possible presence of a precessing outflow .",
    "our position - velocity diagram also supports this suggestion , but at smaller scales , with the wave - like distribution pattern compatible with a precessing jet traced by masers at scales of @xmath28  250 au . to illustrate this possibility",
    "we have represented an ideal model of a precessing jet that can qualitatively explain the same wave - like tendency observed in the position - velocity diagram . in the lower panels of fig .",
    "[ cb3axis - model ] , we show a sketch reproducing the model we propose . in order to fit the model with the observed pattern",
    ", we approximated the precessing jet with a narrow cone on whose surface discrete ejections of material are located and we assumed that the ejected material is being decelerated ( bottom left panel of fig .",
    "[ cb3axis - model ] ) .",
    "we also consider that the motion of the ejected material is dominated by deceleration , while the changes in velocity due to precession are negligible .",
    "therefore , our model can reproduce a wave - like distribution ( solid lines joining the dots in the bottom right panel of fig .  [ cb3axis - model ] )",
    "similar to the one observed ( dashed lines joining the symbols in the upper panel of fig .",
    "[ cb3axis - model ] ) . under these assumptions , we estimate a deceleration of the ejected material of @xmath28  2.2  @xmath36  10@xmath37 cos  @xmath38 km  s@xmath39 ( @xmath28  0.14 cos  @xmath38 au  yr@xmath39 ) , where @xmath38 is the position angle between the direction of the jet and the plane of the sky .",
    "we caution that our aim with this model is to explain the wave - like tendency observed with the position - velocity diagram , and not to reproduce exactly the observed maser emission .",
    "further support for the possible presence of a precessing jet at these small scales ( 250 au ) could be obtained with proper motions studies of masers by means of vlbi observations .",
    "this bok globule hosts a multiple system of ysos towards ( ) , with the presence of two bright near - infrared ( k band , 2.2  @xmath40 m ) objects ( , , which are probably class i protostars ) , plus a bright elongated feature ( hereafter ) mainly seen in h@xmath7 [ v = 10 s(1 ) , 2.121 @xmath40 m ] ( @xcite , @xcite ; @xcite ; see fig .",
    "[ cb54composition ] ) .",
    "in addition , @xcite and @xcite reported a radio continuum source ( cb 54 vla1 ) at 3.6 and 6 cm located @xmath28 5@xmath20 to the ne of the nominal position of the iras source ( see fig .",
    "[ cb54composition ] ) .",
    "these sources are located near the center of a bipolar co outflow that is oriented in the northeast - southwest direction and probably moves close to the plane of the sky @xcite .",
    "our vla observations ( fig .",

    "these velocities are blueshifted with respect to the velocity of the cloud ( @xmath32=19.5 km s@xmath8 ; @xcite ) .",
    "no maser emission was detected with the robledo antenna at the velocities reported here @xcite , which is understandable since the flux density reported here is below the sensitivity threshold of those single - dish observations .",
    "however , @xcite detected a component at @xmath42 km s@xmath8 , which reached a flux density of up to @xmath43 jy , and another one of up to @xmath44 jy at @xmath45 km s@xmath8 .",
    "neither of these is evident in the vla spectrum ( fig .",
    "[ cb54composition ] ) , although the component at @xmath45 km s@xmath8 might be present at a very low level , and blended with the one at @xmath41 km s@xmath8 .",
    "the maser emission is located at the position of the elongated feature cb54 yc1-sw ( see fig .  [ cb54composition ] ) .",
    "@xcite , on the basis that the elongated feature appears brighter in h@xmath46 than in the k - band , proposed that it could trace shocked material , such as a knot in a near - infrared jet .",
    "however , given the association of cb 54 yc1-sw with the water masers , we suggest that this feature is another embedded yso and that , according to the association of water masers with mass - loss phenomena , this object would be a good candidate for being the powering source of the observed molecular outflow in the region .",
    "in fact , masers are located @xmath28 18000 - 20000 au ( at a distance of 1.5  kpc ; @xcite ) from both cb 54 yc1-i and cb 54 yc1-ii , which make these objects less likely candidates for pumping the maser emission , since masers in low - mass star - forming regions tend to be within several hundred au from the powering source @xcite .",

    "this value at the center of the globule is @xmath28  6 times higher than the value derived by us at the position of iras 17503@xmath00833 , which is consistent with a decrease of the gas density towards the edges of the cloud .",
    "the absence of any signpost of star formation activity associated with the water maser emission , suggests that the water maser in cb 101 may not be associated with a young object but with an evolved star , since water maser emission is also known to be associated with circumstellar envelopes of late - type stars @xcite .",
    "moreover , the difference between the centroid velocity of the detected water maser and the cloud velocity is @xmath76 km s@xmath8 , whereas this difference is usually @xmath77 km s@xmath8 in the case of ysos @xcite . to further investigate the true nature of iras 17503@xmath00833 , we searched for additional data in the literature .",
    "the iras flux density at 12  @xmath40 m is well determined , but the values for 25 , 60 , and 100  @xmath40 m are only upper limits .",
    "the near - infrared flux densities were retrieved from the 2mass catalog , and dereddened with a value for e(b@xmath0v ) = 0.21 , taken from @xcite for stars with galactic latitude b = 8  @xmath78 .",

    "[ cb101varios ] we have plotted the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of iras 17503@xmath00833 , including the upper limits for the iras flux densities . evolved objects may show one or two maxima in their sed .",
    "after the agb the seds usually show two maxima , one belonging to the central star and the other to the circumstellar envelope @xcite . in the case of iras 17503@xmath00833 , if it is an evolved object there seem to be only one maximum in the near infrared ; the second maximum should have shown up in the far infrared .",
    "the presence of only one maximum suggests that no disk or circumstellar envelope is detached from the central star .",
    "this would restrict the evolutionary stage of the star to the phase between red giant and the asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) .",
    "the sed is then compatible with a black body distribution at a temperature of @xmath79 k , although more data points at different wavelengths would be necessary to better constrain this temperature . in fig .",
    "[ cb101varios ] , we have plotted the dereddened ir colours of the object in an ir color - color diagram , to further check its evolutionary stage . iras 17503@xmath00833 is located to the right and above the main sequence and the red giant branch , which is typical of mira stars ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the temperatures of these stars fall in the range between 2000  k and 3500  k @xcite , which is compatible with the temperature of @xmath80  k estimated by us . moreover , water maser emission is very frequent in mira - type stars @xcite . therefore , we suggest that the co emission found belongs to the cloud cb 101 , and iras 17503@xmath00833 is a field star , not associated with the cloud . this is consistent with the location of this source at the edge of the bok globule , at a distance of @xmath81 from its center . in any case ,",
    "additional observations at other frequencies , in order to be able to accurately determine the effective temperature of the star from the sed , together with a light curve to perform variability studies of this source are needed to confirm its identification as a mira star .",

    "however , @xcite did not detect the maser , with a @xmath82 upper limit of 0.75 jy on 2003 july 11 and of 0.15 jy on 2004 july 22 and 2005 june 16 .",

    "smm1 was classified as a class 0 source while smm2 was proposed to be either the submillimeter counterpart of cb 232 yc1-i , or another class 0 source without infrared counterpart @xcite .",

    "the general conclusions we have obtained are the following :    * we have detected water maser emission with the vla in cb 3 , cb 54 , cb 101 and cb 232 . no water maser emission was detected towards cb 65 or cb 205 . * these water masers are associated with star forming regions showing bipolar molecular outflows , except for cb 101 ( iras 17503@xmath00833 ) , which we propose is an evolved object , possibly a mira star , and cb 65 ( iras 16277@xmath02332 ) , whose nature is unknown . *",
    "all of the bok globules associated with star formation present multiple stellar systems in different evolutionary stages .",
    "accurate positions of water masers has helped us to get information about the powering sources in the case of cb 3 , cb 54 , and cb 232 .",
    "we propose the millimeter source cb 3-mm and the near - ir source cb 232 yc1-i as the best candidates for pumping the maser emission in cb 3 and cb 232 respectively . in the case of cb 54",
    ", we propose a new young object ( cb 54 yc1-sw ) , seen as an elongated feature in near - infrared images , as the powering source of the maser emission . * the maser emission in cb 3",
    "is distributed along the direction of the molecular outflow , and seems to be tracing the inner part of a collimated jet .",
