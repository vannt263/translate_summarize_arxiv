    "an rna molecule is a heteropolymer , consisting of four types of nucleotides  uracil ( @xmath1 ) , adenine ( @xmath2 ) , guanine ( @xmath3 ) and cytosine ( @xmath4)which are linked into a chain by phosphate bonds .",
    "the nucleotides then form saturating hydrogen bonds with one another , with @xmath5 bonding to @xmath6 and @xmath7 bonding to @xmath8 .",
    "these bonds cause the rna to fold up into a stable , three dimensional structure .",
    "the structure is further stabilized by the stacking interactions , where runs of adjacent bonds twist into the familiar watson - crick helices .",
    "the folding process is believed to be roughly hierarchical@xcite , in that the primary ( one - dimensional ) structure , defined as the sequence of nucleotides , determines the secondary ( two - dimensional ) structure . if one visualizes the rna as a circle , tying the first nucleotide to the last , and then represents hydrogen bonds as arcs within the circle , the secondary structure is the structure that can be drawn without bonds crossing one another@xcite .",
    "the secondary structure is largely unaffected by the formation of the ( three - dimensional ) tertiary structure , which includes , among other things , pseudoknots .",
    "pseudoknots are precisely those structures which _ do _ contain bonds that would cross each other inside the disk",
    ". algorithms that allow for the prediction of certain pseudoknots exist .",
    "for instance , @xcite allows for any number of bonds on the outside of the disk , as long as they do not cross .",
    "our algorithm allows for a different set of topologies , enumerated in @xcite .",
    "we only consider a basic model of rna , in which we only account for the energies associated with bond formation and neglect stacking interactions , loop entropies , and steric constraints .",
    "modern rna folding algorithms tend to be more complex , especially towards secondary structure@xcite , but we opt for a simpler approach for the sake of clarity in this paper . as a result ,",
    "the implementation we outline here is merely an illustration ; it is not useful for predicting the structure of folded rna .",
    "let @xmath9 be the change in energy of forming a hydrogen bond between the @xmath10th and @xmath11th bases , and let @xmath12 be the boltzmann factor at temperature @xmath13 . then one can write the partition function as a sum of terms of the form @xmath14",
    ". the @xmath15s in the above sum must be unique because a base is saturated by a single hydrogen bond .",
    "our partition function is then @xmath16 the factor of @xmath0 is a parameter which tracks the topology of the bond structure . since there is usually a small number of pseudoknots , and they can be controlled by the concentration of @xmath17 ions in solution , we have introduced the parameter @xmath0 , and penalize terms involving pseudoknots with factors of @xmath18 .",
    "the secondary structure is @xmath19 , while a restricted set of singly - pseudoknotted structures are @xmath20@xcite .",
    "there are many ( @xmath21 ) possible terms in the above sum .",
    "we propose an algorithm which allows us to calculate this partition function to @xmath22 in @xmath23 time .",
    "we also generalize this algorithm to calculate the partition function of an rna that contains an arbitrary number of these @xmath24 pseudoknots .",
    "we can then use backtracking to determine what bonds contribute to the dominant term in the partition function , and thus the folded structure at low temperatures .",
    "we can also determine the probability that a given bond is present at a finite temperature .    in order to express sums like ( [ eq : pt - fn - v ] ) in a convenient fashion",
    ", we introduced two objects , which we call `` propagators '' .",
    "the first of these is the two - indexed @xmath25 , which is the partition function of the secondary structure of a chain of nucleotides identical to that which lies between the @xmath26th base and the @xmath27th base .",
    "we set @xmath28 and @xmath29 for @xmath30 , which forbids `` backwards propagation '' , insuring @xmath31 always runs in the @xmath32 to @xmath33 direction .",
    "the other propagator is the four - indexed @xmath34 , which is non - zero if @xmath35 . in that case",
    ", @xmath34 is the partition function of the structure of two spatially separated , anti - parallel , chains of nucleotides , one between @xmath36 and @xmath27 , and the other between @xmath26 and @xmath37 , .",
    "these definitions allow us to depict topological classes of structures with feynman diagrams . in these diagrams",
    ", @xmath31 is an arrow pointing from @xmath26 to @xmath27 , and @xmath34 is a box with solid sides with corners at @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath38 , and @xmath39 .",
    "individual @xmath40 bonds are dashed lines from @xmath27 to @xmath41 .",
    "these diagrams are typically in one - to - one correspondence with sums , as in @xcite .",
    "the diagrams , as well as typical associated structures , are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : el - prop ] . in figs .",
    "[ fig : el - prop : ty - g ] and [ fig : el - prop : ty - d ] , the heavy lines represent the rna backbone , and the empty circles represent nucleotides .",
    "we begin by summarizing the results relevant to a computer implementation of the algorithm are in section  [ sec : algo ] .",
    "we present two variations on the algorithm .",
    "one allows for the calculation of the partition function with a single pseudoknot .",
    "the other allows for any number of pseudoknots .",
    "the remainder of the paper presents derivations of these results for the interested reader .",
    "the index structure makes the topology of rna folding similar to that of large @xmath42 quantum chromodynamics , and these diagrams can be expressed using the thooft double line formalism@xcite .",
    "we review the derivations of the recursive equations which define @xmath43 and @xmath44 , as well some other techniques and notations from @xcite and @xcite , in section  [ sec : matrix ] .    calculating the pseudoknot partition function",
    "is considerably more involved than backtracking the secondary structure partition function . instead of a single , simple sum",
    ", many topologies must be summed over , and many of those involve summations over several indices . in order to do these sums efficiently ,",
    "we define new propagators , similar to @xmath44 and @xmath43 , in section [ sec : props ] .",
    "the procedure for calculating the partition function remains a recursive one , though .",
    "one finds the partition function @xmath45 of an @xmath46 nucleotide rna in terms of the structures of the @xmath47 nucleotide rna . this is simple enough for the secondary structure , because it is defined to exclude crossings .",
    "thus , one considers only structures where a single bond arcs over complete secondary structures .",
    "this reasoning will lead one to the defining relation for @xmath44 described in section  [ sec : matrix ] , and , indeed , it is how the equation was first derived@xcite .",
    "however , crossings are the defining feature of pseudoknots , so our recursion relation will need to handle them .",
    "this requires the introduction of the `` vertex operators '' mentioned in section vi of @xcite .",
    "these vertex operators are defined to be equal the partition functions of the secondary and pseudoknot structures on runs of nucleotides , with the additional requirement that a given nucleotide is unsaturated , so an incoming hydrogen bond can attach there .",
    "for example , the structure between the bases marked @xmath27 and @xmath48 in fig .",
    "[ fig : ps - vert ] can be associated with a term in a vertex operator that allows an incoming bond from the @xmath46st base to connect at @xmath36 .    once these vertex operators are put in a form similar to that of the pseudoknots in @xcite , which can be summed explicitly",
    ", it is possible to use them to write a recursion relation that can be used to generate a partition function that includes pseudoknots .",
    "fortunately , the techniques needed to evaluate these vertex operators are very similar to those used to evaluate the pseudoknots . these calculations are described in section [ sec : verts ] .",
    "using the methods and results of the previous section , one can calculate the partition function of a singly pseudoknotted rna with @xmath49 nucleotides as follows :    1 .",
    "generate the matrix @xmath50 from the rna sequence .",
    "2 .   solve the hartree equation @xmath51 for @xmath44 .",
