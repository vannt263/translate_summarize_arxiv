    "<S> anisotropy effects on the finite - size critical behavior of a two - dimensional ising model on a general triangular lattice in an infinite - strip geometry with periodic , antiperiodic , and free boundary conditions ( ) in the finite direction are investigated . </S>",

    "<S> this allows us to relate free energy scaling functions in the presence of an anisotropy to those of the corresponding isotropic system . </S>",
