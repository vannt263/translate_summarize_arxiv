    "current wireless standards ( e.g. , ieee 802.11n and 802.16e ) have adopted mimo techniques @xcite-@xcite to achieve the benefits of transmit diversity ( using space - time coding ) and high data rates ( using spatial multiplexing ) .",
    "they , however , harness only a limited potential of mimo benefits since they use only a small number of transmit antennas ( e.g. , 2 to 4 antennas ) .",
    "significant benefits can be realized if large number of antennas are used ; e.g. , large - mimo systems with tens of antennas in communication terminals can enable multi - giga bit rate transmissions at high spectral efficiencies of the order of _ several tens of bps / hz_. key challenges in realizing such large - mimo systems include low - complexity detection and channel estimation , rf / if technologies , and placement of large number of antennas in communication terminals .",
    "our focus in this paper is on low - complexity detection and channel estimation for large - mimo systems .",
    "spatial multiplexing ( v - blast ) with large number of transmit antennas can offer high spectral efficiencies , but it does not give transmit diversity . on the other hand ,",
    "well known orthogonal space - time block codes ( stbc ) have the advantages of full transmit diversity and low decoding complexity , but they suffer from rate loss for increasing number of transmit antennas @xcite,@xcite,@xcite .",
    "however , _",
    "full - rate , non - orthogonal stbcs from cyclic division algebras ( cda ) _",
    "@xcite are attractive to achieve high spectral efficiencies in addition to achieving full transmit diversity , using large number of transmit antennas .",
    "for example , a @xmath2 stbc matrix from cda has 1024 symbols ( i.e. , 32 complex symbols per channel use ) , and using this stbc along with 16-qam and rate-3/4 turbo code offers a spectral efficiency of 96 bps / hz . while maximum - likelihood ( ml ) decoding of orthogonal stbcs can be achieved in linear complexity , ml or near - ml decoding of non - orthogonal stbcs with large number of antennas at low complexities has been a challenge .",
    "channel estimation is also a key issue in large - mimo systems . in this paper , we address these two challenging problems ; our proposed solutions can potentially enable realization of large - mimo systems in practice .",
    "sphere decoding and several of its low - complexity variants are known in the literature @xcite-@xcite .",
    "these detectors , however , are prohibitively complex for large number of antennas .",
    "recent approaches to low - complexity multiuser / mimo detection involve application of techniques from belief propagation @xcite , markov chain monte - carlo methods @xcite , neural networks @xcite,@xcite,@xcite , etc .",
    "in particular , in @xcite,@xcite , we presented a powerful hopfield neural network based low - complexity search algorithm for detecting large - mimo v - blast signals , and showed that it performs quite close to ( within 4.6 db of ) the theoretical capacity , at high spectral efficiencies of the order of tens to hundreds of bps / hz using tens to hundreds of antennas , at an average per - symbol detection complexity of just @xmath3 , where @xmath4 and @xmath5 denote the number of transmit and receive antennas , respectively .    in this paper",

    "we propose a method to generate soft outputs from the @xmath0-las output vector .",
    "soft outputs generation was not considered in @xcite,@xcite . the proposed soft outputs generation for the individual bits results in about 1 to 1.5 db improvement in coded bit error rate ( ber ) compared to hard decision @xmath0-las outputs . 3 .",
    "assuming i.i.d . fading and perfect channel state information at the receiver ( csir ) ,",
    "our simulation results show that the proposed @xmath0-las algorithm is able to decode large non - orthogonal stbcs ( e.g. , @xmath1 and @xmath2 stbcs ) and achieve near single - input single - output ( siso ) awgn uncoded ber performance as well as near - capacity ( within 4 db from theoretical capacity ) coded ber performance .",

    "we show that the proposed approach outperforms the other considered approaches , both in terms of performance as well as complexity .",
    "we present simulation results that quantify the loss in ber performance due to spatial correlation in large - mimo systems , by considering a more realistic spatially correlated mimo fading channel model proposed by gesbert _",
    "et al _ in @xcite .",
    "we show that this loss in performance can be alleviated by providing more receive dimensions ( i.e. , more receive antennas than transmit antennas ) .",
    "7 .   finally , we present a training - based iterative detection / channel estimation scheme for large stbc mimo systems .",

    "high spectral efficiencies with large @xmath10 can be achieved using this code construction .",
    "for example , with @xmath104 transmit antennas , the @xmath2 stbc from ( 11.a ) with 16-qam and rate-3/4 turbo code achieves a spectral efficiency of 96 bps / hz .",
    "this high spectral efficiency is achieved along with the full - diversity of order @xmath105 . however , since these stbcs are non - orthogonal , ml detection gets increasingly impractical for large @xmath10 .",

    "this goes on until @xmath107 either the algorithm succeeds in the @xmath106th sub - stage for some @xmath108 ( in which case a new search stage is initiated ) , or @xmath109 the algorithm terminates .",

    "however , for the case of 1-symbol update , we could obtain a closed - form expression for the optimum @xmath137 that minimizes @xmath143 , which is given by ( corresponding theorem and proof are given in the appendix ) @xmath145 where @xmath146 denotes the rounding operation , where for a real number @xmath147 , @xmath148 is the integer closest to @xmath147 .",

    "now , let @xmath163 if @xmath164 , the update for the @xmath116th iteration is @xmath165 where @xmath166 is the @xmath167th column of @xmath126 .",
    "the update in ( [ eqx ] ) follows from the definition of @xmath133 in ( [ ck+1minusck ] ) . if @xmath168 , then the 1-symbol update search terminates . the data vector at this point is referred to as ` 1-symbol update local minima . ' after reaching the 1-symbol update local minima , we look for a further decrease in the cost function by updating multiple symbols simultaneously .      the motivation for trying out multiple symbol updates can be explained as follows .",
    "let @xmath169 denote the set of data vectors such that for any @xmath170 , if a @xmath106-symbol update is performed on @xmath171 resulting in a vector @xmath172 , then @xmath173 . we note that @xmath174 , because any number of symbol updates on @xmath175 will not decrease the cost function .",

    "note that @xmath177 , and @xmath178 , i.e. , @xmath179 is a singleton set with @xmath175 as the only element .",
    "it is noted that if the updates are done optimally , then the output of the @xmath106-las algorithm converges to a vector in @xmath180 .",
    "also , @xmath181 .",
    "for any @xmath182 , @xmath183 and @xmath184 , it can be seen that @xmath171 and @xmath175 will differ in @xmath185 or more locations .",
    "the probability that @xmath186 increases with increasing snr , and so the separation between @xmath187 and @xmath87 will monotonically increase with increasing @xmath106 .",
    "since @xmath188 , and @xmath189 decreases monotonically with increasing @xmath106 , there will be lesser non - ml data vectors to which the algorithm can converge to for increasing @xmath106 .",
    "therefore , the probability of the noise vector @xmath190 inducing an error would decrease with increasing @xmath106 .",
    "this indicates that @xmath106-symbol updates with large @xmath106 could get near to ml performance with increasing complexity for increasing @xmath106 .      in this subsection",
    ", we present the update algorithm for the general case where @xmath106 symbols , @xmath192 , are updated simultaneously in one iteration .",

    "consequently , a brute - force method is to evaluate @xmath219 over all possible values of @xmath217 .",
    "approximate methods can be adopted to solve this problem using lesser complexity .",
    "one method based on zero - forcing is as follows . the cost difference function in ( [ eqpqk ] )",

    "<S> in this paper , we present a low - complexity algorithm for detection in high - rate , non - orthogonal space - time block coded ( stbc ) large - mimo systems that achieve high spectral efficiencies of the order of tens of bps / hz . we also present a training - based iterative detection / channel estimation scheme for such large stbc mimo systems . </S>",

    "<S> the fact that we could show such good results for large stbcs like @xmath1 and @xmath2 stbcs from cyclic division algebras ( cda ) operating at spectral efficiencies in excess of 20 bps / hz ( even after accounting for the overheads meant for pilot based training for channel estimation and turbo coding ) establishes the effectiveness of the proposed detector and channel estimator . </S>",
