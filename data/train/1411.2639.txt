    "this paper concerns the floer cohomology of symplectic automorphisms , and its behaviour under iterations : more specifically , when passing to the square of a given automorphism ( one expects parallel results for odd prime powers , but they are beyond our scope here ) .",

    "our most significant result is the following smith - type inequality ( the name refers to a topological result reproduced as below , see ( * ? ? ? * chapter iii , 4.3 ) ) :    [ th : floer - smith ] there is an inequality of total dimensions , @xmath8    this is not entirely new : under additional topological restrictions ( stated below as assumption [ th : stably - trivial ] ) , it has been previously proved by hendricks @xcite . as in @xcite ,",
    "the proof involves an equivariant form of floer cohomology , written as @xmath9 .",
    "this is a finitely generated @xmath3-graded module over @xmath10 $ ] , the ring of formal power series in one variable @xmath11 ( the variable has degree @xmath12 ) . the information encoded in this equivariant theory can be viewed as a refinement of the previously mentioned @xmath3-action .",
    "what we obtain is a description of equivariant floer cohomology after inverting @xmath11 , which means after tensoring with the ring @xmath13 of laurent series :    [ th : localized - isomorphism ] there is an isomorphism of ungraded @xmath13-modules , @xmath14 } { { \\mathbb k}}((h)).\\ ] ]    corollary [ th : floer - smith ] follows from this by purely algebraic arguments ( the same step appears in @xcite , as well as in ordinary equivariant cohomology ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter iv.4 ) ) .",
    "naively , may not be surprising : if one thinks of floer cohomology as a measure of fixed points , @xmath6 clearly has more of them than @xmath0 . in the same intuitive spirit ( and with the localization theorem for equivariant cohomology in mind , which we will recall as theorem [ th : localization ] below ) , one can think of tensoring with @xmath13 as throwing away the fixed points of @xmath6 which are not fixed points of @xmath0 , leading to .",
    "indeed , in a sense , the proofs ultimately reduce to such very basic considerations . before one can get to that point",

    "we take its tensor product with itself ( as a chain complex ) , equip it with the involution that exchanges the two factors , and consider the associated group cohomology @xmath17 .",
    "we will see , as part of the elementary formalism of group cohomology , that this depends only on @xmath2 .",
    "our main theorem is :    [ th : main ] the equivariant pair - of - pants product becomes an isomorphism after tensoring with @xmath13 on both sides .",
    "corollary [ th : localized - isomorphism ] is a purely algebraic consequence of this statement .",
    "note that in principle , the map contains additional information , which is lost when taking the tensor product with @xmath13 .",
    "[ th : warning ] the construction of @xmath2 assumes nondegeneracy of fixed points , and involves additional choices of almost complex structures .",
    "ultimately , one uses continuation maps @xcite to show that floer cohomology is independent of those choices up to canonical isomorphism , and also to extend the definition to the degenerate case .",
    "similarly , the construction of @xmath9 and of requires nondegeneracy of the fixed points of @xmath6 , and involves further auxiliary choices ( of almost complex structures and , in the case of the product , hamiltonian functions which serve as inhomogeneous terms for the @xmath18-equations ) . even though this should not affect the outcome , in the same sense as before",
    ", we will not prove that statement here .",
    "now , the proof of theorem [ th : main ] makes some specific requirements : in addition to the nondegeneracy of fixed points of @xmath6 , there is an additional condition on the action functional ( see setup [ th : setup-4 ] ; this can be achieved by a small perturbation ) .",
    "one then needs to choose the auxiliary data ( specifically , the inhomogeneous terms ) that define the equivariant pair - of - pants product to be sufficiently small .",
    "the precise statement should therefore be that , for this particular class of @xmath0 , one can define in such a way that it becomes an isomorphism after tensoring with @xmath13 .",

    "in particular , it describes the algebraic arguments that tie together the statements made above ; explains the motivation from classical equivariant cohomology ; and discusses some applications .",
