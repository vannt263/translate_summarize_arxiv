    "as represented by the pygmy dipole mode @xcite , there are novel excitation modes peculiar to unstable nuclei",
    ". in particular , the low - lying collective excitation modes are quite sensitive to the underlying shell structure and the pairing correlations , and hence , the quenched shell gaps in unstable nuclei should generate unique collective modes .",
    "one of the interesting example is the @xmath0=28 shell gap that is known to be quenched in the vicinity of @xmath3s , and has been paid considerable experimental @xcite and theoretical attentions @xcite . since the the orbital angular momenta of @xmath8 and @xmath9 differ by two , the quench of @xmath0=28 shell gap will lead to the strong quadrupole correlation of neutrons .",
    "furthermore , the protons in si , s and ar isotopes occupy the middle of the @xmath5-shell , and hence , the quadrupole correlation should also exist in the proton side .",
    "therefore , once the @xmath0=28 shell gap is quenched , the strong quadrupole correlations amongst protons and neutrons will be ignited and lead to a novel variety of the excitation modes .",
    "indeed , various exotic phenomena such as the shape transition in si and s isotopes and the coexistence of various deformed states are theoretically suggested @xcite .    in this paper , we report the low - lying quadrupole excitation modes in @xmath2ar , @xmath3s and @xmath4si generated by the strong quadrupole correlation between protons and neutrons . to access the low - lying quadrupole modes of these isotopes , we apply the canonical - basis time - dependent hartree - fock - bogoliubov ( cb - tdhfb ) theory @xcite which has been successfully applied to the study of the dipole @xcite and quadrupole @xcite resonances of nuclei of wide mass range .",
    "the cb - tdhfb can describe self - consistently the dynamical effects of pairing correlation which has a significant role to generate the low - lying quadrupole strength as reported in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : method ] , we present the cb - tdhfb equations , the choice of energy density functional and the method to evaluate the strength function of quadrupole modes and @xmath10(e2 ) . in sec .  [ sec : results ] , the results of @xmath1ca and @xmath2ar obtained by using skyrme ski3 parameter set are presented , and the enhancement of the low - lying quadrupole mode in @xmath2ar is demonstrated .",
    "the interaction dependences of the results are also discussed .",
    "furthermore , the low - lying states of other @xmath0=28 isotones ( @xmath3s , @xmath4si ) are also investigated .",
    "finally , sec .",
    "[ sec : concl ] summarizes this work .",
    "in this section , we introduce the cb - tdhfb equation briefly , choice of interaction and the method to evaluate quadrupole strength function and @xmath10(e2 ) . [",
    "sec : method ]      by assuming the diagonal form of pairing functional , the cb - tdhfb equations @xcite are derived from the full tdhfb equation represented in the canonical basis @xmath11 which diagonalize a density matrix .",
    "the cb - tdhfb equations describe the time - evolution of the canonical pair @xmath12 , its occupation probability @xmath13 and pair probability @xmath14 , @xmath15 where @xmath16 , and the @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the single - particle hamiltonian and the gap energy , respectively .",
    "the numerical calculation was performed in the three - dimensional cartesian coordinate space representation .",
    "the canonical basis @xmath19 with @xmath20 is expressed in the space which is discretized in a square mesh of 1.0 fm inside of a sphere of radius 18 fm .",
    "we introduce the absorbing boundary condition ( abc ) to eliminate unphysical modes by adding a complex potential @xmath21 to the single - particle hamiltonian @xmath17 in accordance with refs .",
    "@xcite . here",
    "@xmath22 is given as , @xmath23 where @xmath24=@xmath25+@xmath26=18 fm .",
    "we set the abc effective range @xmath26=6 fm and the depth @xmath27=3.75 mev .",
    "we apply the skyrme functionals to particle - hole ( @xmath28)-channel .",
    "unless otherwise mentioned explicitly , we adopt the ski3 parameter set  @xcite which , amongst the parameter sets we tested , most reasonably describes the proton and neutron single - particle levels in the vicinity of @xmath1ca .",
    "it is experimentally known that @xmath0=28 shell gap is approximately 4.8 mev  @xcite and the proton @xmath29 is a few hundreds kev above @xmath30  @xcite . to investigate the interaction dependence of the results",
    ", we also show the results obtained skm@xmath31 parameter set  @xcite , that yields smaller @xmath0=28 shell gap and different order of proton @xmath29 and @xmath30 shells .",
    "we use a schematic pairing functional form that was employed in ref .",
    "the pairing energy @xmath32 and gap parameter @xmath18 are written as @xmath33 where , the cut - off function @xmath34 depends on the single - particle energy @xmath35 in the ground state @xcite . in this work ,",
    "we have tested several choice of the pairing strength @xmath36 , that will be explained in the next section .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     to investigate how the enhancement of the low - lying strength depends on the underlying nuclear structure , we tested several different combinations of the energy density functional in @xmath28- and @xmath37(@xmath38)-channels . in any cases we tested , the low - lying quadrupole collectivity in @xmath2ar is much more enhanced than in @xmath1ca , but its magnitude and distribution depend on the single - particle structure and pairing strength . to illustrate it ,",
    "we discuss three cases which are denoted as @xmath2ar@xmath39 , @xmath2ar@xmath40 and @xmath2ar@xmath41 in the following .",
    "the first case @xmath2ar@xmath39 is calculated by using skm@xmath31 in @xmath28-channel instead of ski3 , and the pairing strengths are determined by the same manner with that explained in sec .",
    "[ ssec:48ca46ar ] , _ i.e. _ the strength of proton @xmath42 is so chosen to reproduce the empirical pairing gap , while that of neutron is vanished .",
    "this choice of the energy functional yields the proton and neutron single - particle levels listed in tab .",
    "[ tab : gs2 ] where the @xmath0=28 shell gap ( 3.31 mev ) is smaller than those of ski3 and observations , and the order of proton @xmath30 and @xmath29 is reverted in contradiction to the observations .",
    "figure  [ fig:2 ] shows the strength functions of @xmath2ar@xmath39 in ( a ) proton and ( b ) neutron channels , which are obtained in the fully self - consistent ( solid lines ) and the unperturbed ( thin chain lines ) calculations . as clearly seen , the enhancement of the low - lying collectivity similar to the results shown in fig .  [ fig:48ca46arq ] is confirmed .",
    "however , there are several differences between the ski3 and skm@xmath31 results ; first , the low - lying peak is split into two , and second , the amount of the low - lying strength is increased .",
    "the origin of the splitting may be attributed to the proton excitation from @xmath43 .",
    "as already mentioned , skm@xmath31 yields different ordering of the proton @xmath5-shell , @xmath30 is 1.2 mev above @xmath29 , and hence , the corresponding proton excitation can be seen as a small peak at 1.2 mev in the unperturbed proton strength function . by switching on the residual interaction , the proton excitation couples to the neutron excitations and",
    "grows to the peak at 1.1 mev in the full - calculation . on the other hand",
    ", the peak at 2.3 mev has similar nature to that of ski3 result , _",
    "i.e. _ , it is dominated by the neutron excitations across @xmath0=28 shell gap and the proton excitation is induced by the residual interaction .",
    "the relatively reduced @xmath0=28 shell gap in skm@xmath31 dearly increases the amount of the strengths below 5 mev ( s@xmath44 ) from 109 @xmath45@xmath46 ( ski3 ) to 139 @xmath45@xmath46 ( skm@xmath31 ) .",
    "the other visible differences are the small peaks around 7 mev in proton channel , which originate in the proton @xmath47 and @xmath30 excitations and corresponds to the splitting of @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "the gqr locates at 17.5 mev in lower than that of ski3 , which has no drastic change .",
    "it is well - known that the pairing correlation has a significant role to form the low - lying quadrupole modes as reported in ref.@xcite .",
    "therefore , we now discuss two cases ( @xmath2ar@xmath48 ) in order to investigate the pairing effects to low - lying 2@xmath6 strength .",
    "the case @xmath2ar@xmath40 is calculated by using ski3 and the pairing strength @xmath36 are determined to reproduce empirical @xmath49 and @xmath50 simultaneously , in short , the pairing correlation in neutron channel is turned - on . in the case of @xmath2ar@xmath41 ,",
    "its pairing - strengths are weakened to 85% of those of @xmath2ar@xmath40 .",
    "the calculated single - particle levels in tab .",
    "[ tab : gs2 ] show that the pairing in neutron channel changes the occupation probability of each orbit , but does not strongly affect the single - particle energies .",
    "the distributions of the strength functions shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] are not drastically changed by switching on the neutron pairing , except for a shoulder around 1.5 mev which appears due to the partial occupation of neutron @xmath51-orbits .",
    "the major difference brought about by pairing correlation is the further enhancement of the low - lying collective mode .",
    "here we check it by looking at the sum of the e2 strengths below 5 mev ; s@xmath52(@xmath2ar , @xmath2ar@xmath40 , @xmath2ar@xmath41)= 109 , 128 and 131 @xmath45@xmath46 are obtained .",
    "these results indicate that the pairing correlation tends to enhance the low - lying collectivity , but its magnitude is sensitive to the pairing strength .    here",
    ", we also comment on the comparison between the present result and experimental data .",
    "the life - time measurement @xcite reports about three times larger value of @xmath10(e2)@xmath53570 @xmath45@xmath46 than that reported by coulomb - excitation experiments @xcite , @xmath10(e2)@xmath53196(218 ) @xmath45@xmath46 . in all cases we tested ,",
    "the low - lying strengths are less than 200 @xmath45@xmath46 , and hence supports the smaller value of @xmath10(e2 ) reported by coulomb excitation .    as summary of this section , for all cases we tested",
    ", it is found that the low - lying collectivity is enhanced .",
    "it is also noted that the distribution and magnitude depend on the single - particle structure and pairing strength .",
    "the same mechanism also applies to other @xmath0=28 isotones @xmath3s and @xmath4si which are experimentally known to have deformed shape and low - lying 2@xmath6 states @xcite . in the present calculation ,",
    "the pairing strengths in both channels are chosen to reproduce empirical gap energies .",
    "@xmath3s has prolate shape ( @xmath54=0.26 ) with @xmath49=2.37 mev and @xmath50=1.12 mev , while @xmath4si has oblate shape ( @xmath54=@xmath550.27 ) with @xmath49=2.70 mev and @xmath50=1.04 mev , respectively .",
    "it is noted that the pattern of the deformed shape of the @xmath0=28 isotone is consistent with other theoretical results @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig:44s42siq2 ] shows their strength functions .",
    "deformation of these nuclei splits the strength functions in the @xmath56 and 2 modes , and makes their strength distributions even more complicated than those in previous sections .",
    "however , we can still identify very low - lying peaks which correspond to a couple of 2@xmath6 states with enhanced collectivity .",
    "it is noted that , for example , three 2@xmath6 states are observed in @xmath3s @xcite and our results may be associated with some of them .",
    "we also estimated 2@xmath6 energies and @xmath10(e2@xmath57 ) of @xmath3s and @xmath4si by using eq.([eq : fit ] ) and ( [ eq : be2 ] ) , although quantitative comparison with observation is not possible because of deformation of these nuclei .",
    "the first peak of @xmath3s at 1.0 mev has a value of @xmath10(e2@xmath58=103 @xmath45@xmath46 and that of @xmath4si at 1.4 mev has @xmath10(e2@xmath58=47 @xmath45@xmath46 . similar to @xmath2ar ,",
    "the energies of 2@xmath6 states have shifted to lower energy , and their strengths are significantly increased compared to @xmath1ca .",
    "indeed in the experimental study of @xmath3s @xcite , a couple of low - lying 2@xmath6 states and the enhancements of @xmath10(e2 ) are reported , however , the observed @xmath10(e2 ) is 310@xmath5990 @xmath45@xmath46 which is larger than our present result .",
    "this discrepancy could be attributed to the rotational mode caused by deformation of the ground band as reported by experiments @xcite .",
    "it is also noted the linear response method occasionally underestimates the observed @xmath10(e2 ) as reported by scamps and lacroix @xcite which could be another reason of the disagreement in @xmath3s and @xmath4si .",
    "we have investigated the low - lying quadrupole vibrational modes of @xmath0=28 isotones ( @xmath1ca , @xmath2ar , @xmath3s , @xmath4si ) by using cb - tdhfb theory .",
    "the proton low - lying 2@xmath6 states of @xmath1ca have neutron single - particle nature , which is found from the comparison fully self - consistent and unperturbed results .",
    "our calculation well reproduce not only the single - particle levels of ground state but also the first 2@xmath6 state and @xmath10(e2 ) of @xmath1ca .",
    "we discuss the mechanism of low - lying 2@xmath6 excitation of other isotones , based on the @xmath1ca results .",
    "the 2@xmath6 states of @xmath2ar have a similar mechanism of @xmath1ca , and the lowest peak indicates some collectivity which is triggered by proton hole - states .",
    "furthermore , we investigate the behavior of 2@xmath6 strength functions under the change of interaction ( @xmath28- , @xmath37(@xmath38)-channel ) for @xmath2ar . from the investigation",
    ", we found that the peak position and the collectivity of the 2@xmath6 states strongly depend on the relation amongst the neutron @xmath60-shell gap , the level - spacing in proton @xmath5-shell and the pairing strength .",
    "our studies argue that the low - energy 2@xmath6 state bringing a strong collectivity can be generated by these three pieces , also in spherical system .",
    "additionally , we found that the pairing correlation does not always enhance the collectivity of low - lying 2@xmath6 states . in this study",
    ", we obtain prolate and oblate deformed ground states for @xmath3s and @xmath4si .",
    "the multiple 2@xmath6 states which appear in deformed nuclei can be applied the argued mechanism , although it could not explain the lowest 2@xmath6 state of deformed nuclei .",
    "the mechanism of 2@xmath6 excited state can be induced near the region to violate ordinary magicity .",
    "we will apply the mechanism to other candidates , in future work .",
