    ", the tip continuously rotates into the direction of the magnetic field , where a strong magnetic contrast is deduced by the increase in the @xmath26 intensity . from the similar saturation values of the @xmath26 intensities in figs .",
    "[ fig : mag_contrast_layer_neu](d , h ) we can conclude , that the out - of plane component of the bicollinear antiferromagnetic spin structure in the surface layer of the fe@xmath0te thin film has a similar strength as the in - plane component .",
    "in summary , we provide a direct proof that spin - polarized tunneling is responsible for the observation of the @xmath13 superstructure in scanning tunneling microscopy on fe@xmath0te by using well defined spin - sensitive fe - coated w - tips .",

    "this confirms previous sp - stm results with magnetically sensitive tips on fe@xmath0te  @xcite and does not support the interpretation of a @xmath13 cdw - order discussed in ref .",
    "furthermore , we have found a strong contribution of the surface spin component in the out - of - plane direction along the c - axis and an in - plane component which deviates from the @xmath10-axis direction , for both the bulk fe@xmath0te samples and the thin fe@xmath0te films grown on bi@xmath3te@xmath4 .",
    "neutron scattering , which is sensitive to the bulk magnetization , revealed a dominant spin direction of the bicollinear antiferromagnetic structure along the @xmath33-axis direction  @xcite .",
    "a tiny component of the magnetization along the @xmath34- and @xmath29-axes has been mainly attributed to local moments of excess iron atoms which are located in the van der waals gap between the fete layers  @xcite .",
    "in contrast , our experiments indicate a strong component of the surface magnetization out of the @xmath33-axis direction , in favour of a reorientation of the ordered magnetic moments _ at the surface _ of fe@xmath0te .",
    "the central question is , thus , what drives this surface reorientation of the spin direction by keeping the overall bicollinear order . due to its layered crystal structure bulk fe@xmath0te",
    "has a quasi - two - dimensional electronic structure and the _ relative _ orientation of the spins within the bicollinear structure is mostly determined by the exchange interaction of the fe atoms within the @xmath34-@xmath35-plane of a given fe@xmath0te layer .",
    "this exchange interaction is relatively strong and largely unaffected by additional effects occurring at the surface such as lattice relaxations or charge redistribution .",
    "therefore , the bicollinear antiferromagnetic structure is preserved at the surface of fe@xmath0te . on the other hand ,",
    "the _ absolute _ orientation of the magnetic moments is influenced by the magnetic anisotropy energy which has a much smaller energy scale .",
    "typically , the magnetic anisotropy is strongly influenced by electronic effects or lattice relaxations .",
    "based on these considerations , we propose that the observed reorientation of the spin structure at the surface of fe@xmath0te is induced by such surface effects .",
    "our findings might have implications for related sample systems .",
    "e.g.  comparable spin - polarized stm studies could offer insight into the origin of the strong increased @xmath5 of the monolayer fese grown on srtio@xmath4 compared to bulk fese  @xcite .",
    "although bulk fese does not show static magnetic order , spin fluctuations are known to exist and being coupled to superconducting pairing  @xcite , which likewise might be strongly modified on the surface .    in conclusion",
    ", we have shown that sp - stm experiments with fe - coated w - tips are well suited to investigate correlated electron systems such as fe@xmath0te with a complex electronic and magnetic structure . however",
    ", a complete characterization requires sp - stm experiments performed in 3d - vector - field systems offering field - dependent studies with arbitrary field orientation .",

    "<S> in particular , scanning tunneling microscopy ( stm ) with atomic - scale resolution has proven to be an indispensable tool for revealing the real - space electronic structure  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , most of the recent stm studies on tmo and iron - based superconductors have been focusing only on the charge degrees of freedom . with the recent developments in spin - polarized stm ( sp - stm )  @xcite , which accesses both charge and spin degrees of freedom on the atomic length scale , detailed investigations of tmo compounds and iron - based superconductors </S>",
    "<S> have now become possible .    since </S>",
    "<S> fe@xmath0te exhibits double - stripe ( bicollinear ) antiferromagnetic ( afm ) order , contrasted with single - stripe afm order in iron pnictide superconductor parent compounds , the study on its mechanism of magnetic order has recently attracted a lot of attention . </S>",
    "<S> it provides a nonpolar charge - neutral te terminated surface upon cleaving  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore fe@xmath0te can be grown _ in situ _ by molecular beam epitaxy ( mbe ) with high quality  @xcite . in bulk , fe@xmath0te is the nonsuperconducting parent compound of the transition metal chalcogenide system fe@xmath0se@xmath1te@xmath2@xcite and exhibits an afm bicollinear magnetic structure below its nel - temperature @xmath6  @xcite . depending on its excess iron concentration @xmath7 the nel - temperature varies from @xmath8  k  @xcite . using neutron diffraction </S>",
    "<S> , it has been shown that the bulk fe spins are pointing along the diagonal of the fe - fe square network  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the crystal structure and corresponding bicollinear afm order are schematically shown in figs .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : fete_simple_topo](a , b ) . </S>",
    "<S> the magnetic phase transition of bulk fe@xmath0te is accompanied by a structural phase transition , with the structure changing from a tetragonal to a monoclinic phase for which the lattice constant @xmath9 is slightly larger than the lattice constant @xmath10  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the bicollinear structure itself shows a commensurate afm modulation along the @xmath9-direction with a wave length of @xmath11 and has a ferromagnetic ( fm ) coupling along the @xmath10-direction  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> stm data obtained for fe@xmath0te bulk and thin film samples have revealed atomic resolution of the te - terminated surface and a superstructure on top of the atomic corrugation having a periodicity of @xmath12  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the observation of this additional @xmath12 periodicity is mainly discussed in two contradictory models . </S>",
    "<S> on one hand , the interpretation for the @xmath13 superstructure is given in terms of a charge density wave ( cdw ) , where the charge density of the top te layer is modified by the spin density wave ( sdw ) of the underlying afm order of the fe - layer . </S>",
    "<S> the strong dependence on the bias voltage @xmath14 suggests a complex interplay between the charge and the magnetic order  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast to a common representation of spin and charge modulations in correlated electron systems  @xcite , in this case the cdw would have the same periodicity as the sdw . </S>",
    "<S> opposed to this interpretation , experiments performed with magnetically sensitive tips , which were prepared by attaching excess fe atoms to the tip apex , give additional insight based on spin - polarized tunneling  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath13 superstructure can unambiguously be assigned to a direct imaging of the bicollinear antiferromagnetic order of the underlying fe lattice . however , in previous studies the absolute orientation of the spins within the antiferromagnetic structure could not be revealed .    in this work we investigated the fe@xmath0te surface of bulk samples and of thin fe@xmath0te films grown on bi@xmath3te@xmath4 by spin - polarized stm , revealing the bicollinear antiferromagnetic structure in both sample systems . moreover , by using fe coated w - tips in a vector - magnet system , we were able to rotate the tip magnetization direction both within the surface plane as well as perpendicular to the surface . </S>",
    "<S> since we thereby have access to the different components of the spin direction of the sample , we could unambiguously prove that the spin direction within the surface bicollinear antiferromagnetic structure is canted with respect to the crystallographic @xmath10-direction . </S>"
