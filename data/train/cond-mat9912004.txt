    "the field of high - transition - temperature ( high-@xmath13 ) superconductivity has generated several thousand publications in the last few years . for a short overview of the lattice structure and phase diagram of the most widely studied copper oxide compounds , such as hole - doped la@xmath0sr@xmath1cuo@xmath14 and yba@xmath9cu@xmath15o@xmath16 or electron - doped l@xmath0ce@xmath1cuo@xmath14 ( l = nd or pr ) , one can consult , e.g. , the review in ref .",

    "the copper oxide high-@xmath13 materials are basically tetragonal , and all of them have one or more cuo@xmath9 planes in their structure , which are separated by layers of other atoms ( ba - o , la - o , nd - o , ... ) .",
    "most researchers empirically and theoretically have come to a consensus that superconductivity is related to processes occurring solely in the conducting cuo@xmath9 planes , with the other layers simply providing the carriers ( they are therefore called charge reservoirs ) . in the cuo@xmath9 planes , each copper ion is strongly bonded to four oxygen ions separated by approximately 1.9 .    due to the layered character of the crystal structures ,",
    "the high-@xmath13 copper oxide compounds are highly anisotropic in their normal - state electrical properties .",
    "although the resistivity in the cuo@xmath9 planes , @xmath17 , shows metallic temperature dependence , the temperature behavior and the magnitude of the resistivity parallel to the @xmath18 axis , @xmath19 , are strongly dependent on crystal structure , and on the concentration of charge carriers .",
    "systematic data for @xmath19 in a number of high-@xmath13 materials obtained on well characterized single crystals are presented by ito et al .",
    "[ 3 ] . for hole - doped systems",
    "yba@xmath9cu@xmath15o@xmath16 and la@xmath0sr@xmath1cuo@xmath14 @xmath19 exhibits a marked change in magnitude as well as in temperature dependence with changing hole concentration ( i.e. , changing @xmath20 ) . for the underdoped ( low @xmath20 ) and optimally doped ( superconducting ) compounds",
    "@xmath19 is non - metallic ( @xmath21 ) at low enough temperatures . in both systems",
    "the anisotropy coefficient , @xmath22 , decreases noticeably with doping , being @xmath23 for the superconducting compounds .",
    "the crystal structure t of the electron doped nd@xmath0ce@xmath1cuo@xmath2 system is the simplest among the superconducting cuprates with the perovskite structure [ 4 ] .",
    "the cu atoms in the cuo@xmath9 layers of hole - doped la@xmath0sr@xmath1cuo@xmath14 or nd@xmath24ce@xmath1sr@xmath25cuo@xmath2 ( @xmath26 ) superconductors are surrounded by apical o atoms , forming octahedrons ( t structure ) or semioctahedrons ( t@xmath27 structure ) .",
    "the most important difference in the crystal structures of nd@xmath9(ce)cuo@xmath14 and la@xmath9(sr)cuo@xmath14 is that the apical oxygen atoms in the t structure are displaced so as to make an isolated cuo@xmath9 plane ( fig.1 ) .",

    "as the gap between the conduction and valence bands is determined just by the energy @xmath33 , these cuprates are classified as charge - transfer semiconductors [ 5 ] .    the combination of ce doping and o reduction results in @xmath34-type conduction in cuo@xmath9 layers in nd@xmath0ce@xmath1cuo@xmath2 single crystals [ 4,6 ] . an energy band structure calculation",

    "the @xmath35 band appears to be of highly two - dimensional ( 2d ) character , with almost no dispersion in the @xmath38-direction normal to cuo@xmath9 planes .",

    "preliminary measurements on a pr - system with different @xmath20  indicated that , as in the case of y- and la- systems , @xmath19  decreases with increasing carrier concentration much more rapidly than @xmath17 .",
    "the larger anisotropy in nd- or pr- systems compared with la- or y- systems would imply that fluorite - type nd@xmath9o@xmath9 or pr@xmath9o@xmath9 layers block out - of - plane conduction more effectively than nacl- type la@xmath9o@xmath9 or ba@xmath9o@xmath9 layers [ 3 ] .    the non - metalic behavior of out - of - plane conductance suggests that the carriers are confined tightly in the cuo@xmath9 plane [ 3 ] .",
    "it is thus of interest to search for two - dimensional effects in the in - plane conductance of the layered cuprates .",
    "there are several previous reports on the manifestation of 2d weak localization effects in the in - plane conductance of nd@xmath0ce@xmath1cuo@xmath2 single crystals or films .",
    "thus a linear dependence of resistivity on @xmath45 comes about at @xmath46 for samples with @xmath47 , in which the superconducting state is destroyed by a magnetic field [ 11 ] .",
    "furthermore , a highly anisotropic negative magnetoresistance , predicted for 2d weak localization , has been observed in the nonsuperconducting state at low temperatures : in samples with @xmath48 [ 12 ] and in unreduced samples with @xmath5 [ 13 ] or @xmath6 [ 14 ] .",

    "a true metallic conduction takes place in cuo@xmath9 layer .",
    "thus , we have a rather pure 2d system with @xmath100  for @xmath20 = 0.15 or @xmath20 = 0.18 , and an extremely pure system with @xmath101  for @xmath20 = 0.20 .",
    "it is quite remarkable that even at such high values of the parameter @xmath96 , a trace of localization comes to light : for @xmath102 , @xmath51  is greater at 1.3k than at 4.2k ( see fig .  4 ) . as for the sample with @xmath20 = 0.12 , where @xmath96  is of the order of unity , this system is in close proximity to transition from weak logarithmic to strong exponential localization as disorder increases ( @xmath96  decreases ) .    the second critical field @xmath71  at temperatures around @xmath103 1.4k ( see figs .",

    "for each temperature there are two fit parameters : the characteristic field @xmath116 ( or @xmath117 ) and the factor @xmath108 .",
    "the widest range of requisite magnetic fields and thus the most accurate fit results are obtained for the lowest temperature @xmath64 = 0.2k . with @xmath97 = 22.5 t",
    ", the best fit is obtained for @xmath118 0.1 t ( @xmath117 = 560 ) and @xmath108 = 6.6 .",
    "the fitting procedure is highly sensitive to the value of the parameter @xmath108 .",
    "in contrast , the value of @xmath116  is obtained only to order of magnitude , as we have no zero - field and weak - field data .",
    "nevertheless , there is no doubt that the inequality @xmath119 is valid .    in the field range @xmath120 , the expression ( 4 )",
    "can be written @xmath121 the inset of fig .",
    "7 shows that the experimental data at @xmath64 = 0.2k can be fitted rather closely by this simple formula over a wide range of fields , 5 t @xmath122  11 t .",
    "but as we have the factor @xmath108 = 6.6 , negative magnetoresistance is too large to be due to the destruction of weak localization only .",
    "thus we conclude that some additional mechanism of negative magnetoresistance must be at work .",
    "there exists another quantum correction to the normal - state conductivity with a logarithmic dependence of magnetoresistivity on @xmath54 , namely the correction due to disorder - modified electron - electron interaction ( eei ) in the cooper channel [ 23 ] . in the range of magnetic fields",
    "@xmath123 , we have @xmath124 where @xmath125 is the thermal coherence length , and @xmath126 is the effective interaction constant of two electrons with opposite momenta . for the attractive electron - electron interaction due to virtual phonon exchange , @xmath127 , and according to ( 6 ) the magnetoresistance should be negative .",
    "as we have dealt with _ in situ _ superconducting samples , so that @xmath127 , the contribution due to eei is most probably the reason for the extra negative magnetoresistance at very low temperatures ( @xmath128 = 0.02 t at @xmath64 = 0.2k ) .",
    "with increasing temperature , the magnitude of the eei conribution decreases rapidly ( @xmath108 = 2.5 at @xmath64 = 0.8k ) , and at @xmath105 1k the estimated value of the factor is close to unity ( @xmath108 = 0.77 at @xmath64 = 2.1k ) , as it should be for weak localization .",
    "it should be noted that pronounced negative magnetoresistance due to the suppression of weak electron localization is observed in ordinary superconductors as well .",
    "the electron transport properties of three - dimensional ( 3d ) amorphous @xmath108-mo@xmath15si and @xmath108-nb@xmath15ge superconducting films have been investigated in magnetic fields up to @xmath54 = 30 t at temperatures down to @xmath64 = 0.35k [ 24 ] .",
    "the authors have found that both the temperature and field dependence of the resistivity @xmath51 can be qualitatively described by weak localization theory . at low temperatures and in magnetic fields above the upper critical field , @xmath7 , magnetoconductivity is proportional to @xmath129 .",
    "this field dependence is consistent with weak localization in the high - field limit ( @xmath130 ) for 3d disordered systems , in contrast to a 2d system with @xmath131 .",
    "one important indication of the 2d character of a system is the strong dependence of magnetoresistance on magnetic field orientation .",
    "highly anisotropic ( negative ) magnetoresistance is actually observed in a nonsuperconducting sample with @xmath20 = 0.12 ( see fig .",
    "9 ) . from the fit",
    "to @xmath114  by the functional form ( 4 ) with @xmath108=1 , we find @xmath117=770  at @xmath64=1.9k and @xmath117=550   at @xmath64=4.2k , so that the phase coherence time @xmath132s  at @xmath64=1.9k and @xmath133s  at @xmath64=4.2k .",
    "we explain the much weaker negative magnetoresistance for the parallel configuration @xmath134 by incorporating finite - thickness ( @xmath12 ) corrections into the strictly 2d theory [ 25 ] : @xmath135 by fitting the theoretical expression ( 7 ) to the curves for @xmath136 ( see fig .",
    "9 ) , we have found the effective thickness of a conducting cuo@xmath9 layer , @xmath137 1.5 .",
    "this value yields an estimate for the extent of the electron wave function in the normal direction , and ensures strong carrier confinement ( @xmath138 ) .",
    "the single crystal ndcecuo can therefore be regarded as an analog of an ultra - short - period superlattice ( 1.5wells / 4.5barriers ) .    as the 2d version of weak localization theory is able to describe the behavior of @xmath139  in our sample , the inequality @xmath140 should be valid for the escape time of an electron from one cuo@xmath9 plane to another .",
    "then we have @xmath141s .",
    "the escape time between adjacent wells in a superlattice can also be estimated from the value of the normal diffusion constant , @xmath142 .",
    "for the parameters of our sample at 300k , we have [ 9 ] @xmath143  with the in - plane diffusion constant @xmath144 = 1.2 @xmath145s@xmath146 .",
    "then @xmath147s even at room temperature , so @xmath140  with certainty at low temperatures .",
    "we have investigated the low - temperature and magnetic field dependence of the normal state in - plane resistivity , @xmath17 , in a layered copper oxide single crystal nd@xmath0ce@xmath1cuo@xmath2 .",
    "the material is regarded as an intrinsic two - dimensional conduction system ( a collection of 2d conducting cuo@xmath9  planes ) , and the results are interpreted in terms of the 2d weak localization model .",
    "three indications of 2d weak localization have been displayed : logarithmic temperature dependence of the resistivity , significant negative magnetoresistance for a field normal to the @xmath11-plane , and pronounced magnetoresistance anisotropy ( much weaker effect for a parallel configuration ) .",
    "a strong dependence of the magnitude of magnetoresistance on the direction of the magnetic field is the most important experimental test for the two - dimensional character of a conducting system .    in a series of samples with @xmath20=(0.12 - 0.20 )",
