    "stick - slip instabilities are ubiquitous in sheared granular materials ranging from pharmaceutical powders to earthquake fault gouge .",
    "such instabilities are often observed in laboratory experiments @xcite . at much larger scales",
    ", these instabilities may explain how aftershocks can be triggered by acoustic waves from earthquakes elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "in the context of industrial processing , stick - slip could result in structural damage and problems in mixing , causing major problems in the quality control of products  @xcite . however , only very few of the many grain - scale numerical simulations to date , such as  @xcite , exhibit stick - slip behavior .",
    "most other models do not account for the extended elastic interaction between the slipping region and its surroundings .",
    "it seems that we do not yet know what basic ingredients of granular models are necessary for the apparent rate - weakening behavior that produces the observed unstable behaviors . for both practical and theoretical purposes ,",
    "we need a predictive , first - principles description of these phenomena .    in this paper",
    "we propose a nonequilibrium theory of stick - slip instabilities in dense granular flows .",
    "our theory accounts for the effect of friction between colliding particles , and for the effects of both internally and externally driven acoustic vibrations .",
    "our key findings are that interparticle friction is crucial for stick - slip instabilities , and that vibrations can amplify or reduce the stick - slip amplitude , or suppress stick - slip altogether , in different parameter regimes .",
    "a key ingredient of our analysis is the idea that the nonequilibrium states of a driven granular material are characterized by its compactivity @xmath0 or equivalently , its effective disorder temperature @xmath1  @xcite . here",
    ", @xmath2 is the extensive volume of the system , @xmath3 is the configurational entropy pertaining to slow , configurational degrees of freedom alone , and the @xmath4 s are the internal variables , such as the density of defects and misalignments , that specify the configurational state of the granular material .",
    "the compactivity @xmath5 is controlled by how the system is driven , and in turn controls the volume .",
    "in fact , @xmath5 increases monotonically with the volume @xmath2 ( if the grain mass is held constant ) , and decreases with increasing packing fraction .",
    "increasing the shear rate would tend to dilate the system , while if one starts from a somewhat loose granular packing , increasing the vibration intensity would reduce the volume .",
    "this effective - temperature description is made possible by the fact that the slow , configurational degrees of freedom of the granular medium are driven out of equilibrium with the fast , kinetic - vibrational motions , so that the two sets of degrees of freedom are only weakly coupled to each other .",
    "the basic idea is that the coupling @xmath6 between the configurational and kinetic - vibrational subsystems consists of additive contributions of the fluctuations @xmath7 induced by shearing , @xmath8 induced by interparticle friction , and @xmath9 induced by external vibrations ( when switched on ) . in our analysis",
    "@xcite of a series of experiments by van der elst _",
    "et al_.  @xcite , these are referred to as mechanical , frictional , and vibrational noise strengths .",
    "the effect of @xmath8 and @xmath9 on granular rheology is clearly illustrated there .    in the van der elst _",
    "et al_.  experiments , the authors measured the steady - state shear band thickness , or volume , as a function of the shear rate , for both spherical glass beads and angular sand particles in a cylindrical shear cell .",
    "the circular plate on top of the shear cell was rotated so that the shear band formed immediately underneath the plate , and contained roughly a dozen particles across its width .",
    "the apparatus was connected to a transducer which , when turned on , vibrated the grains at a single frequency and amplitude .",
    "van der elst _",
    "et al . _  found that for unvibrated angular sand , the steady - state shear band thickness decreases as a function of increasing shear rate , at intermediate shear rates , but increases with shear rate in the fast , inertial flow regime .",
    "this is in contrast to smooth spherical glass beads for which the shear zone thickness increases monotonically with the shear rate .",
    "moreover they found that external acoustic vibrations cause compaction in both angular sand and smooth glass beads at slow shear rates .",
    "their experimental measurements and our quantitative fit to their data are shown in fig .  1 in our earlier analysis @xcite .",
    "in fig .  [",
    "fig : xvplot ] below , we also plot the dimensionless compactivity , instead of the volume or shear band thickness , as a function of the shear rate , albeit at a higher confining pressure than in the van der elst _",
    "et al_.  experiments .",
    "our analysis has shown that acoustic vibrations fluidize the granular material ; that is , vibrations unjam the granular material and significantly reduce the flow stress at slow shear rates .",
    "in addition , frictional dissipation between particles suppresses shear dilatancy at intermediate shear rates , and is responsible for the nonmonotonic variation of the steady - state shear band thickness with shear rate seen in those experiments .",
    "this is shown by a direction comparison between the dashed and solid curves for frictionless and frictional particles in fig .  [ fig : xvplot ] .",
    "nonmonotonic rheology is suggestive of inherent instabilities  @xcite , stick - slip failure being one example .",
    "this motivates our present theoretical analysis .",
    "we show in this paper that interparticle friction is indeed responsible for stick - slip at intermediate shear rates and high enough pressure . in addition , vibrations can amplify or reduce the stick - slip amplitude , or suppress stick - slip in different parameter regimes .",
    "( color online ) a key ingredient for the emergence of flow instabilities is the nonmonotonic variation of the steady - state compactivity @xmath10 , as a function of the imposed shear rate @xmath11 .",
    "( the quantity @xmath10 increases monotonically with the layer thickness or volume , so the layer thickness follows the same qualitative behavior . ) for clarity , this is shown here for a pressure @xmath12 mpa , which lies below the critical pressure necessary for stick - slip to occur ( see fig .",

    "we conclude our paper in sec .",
    "[ sec:6 ] with a discussion of open questions and future directions .",
    "the following theoretical development is almost the same as , but not identical to , that presented in ref .",
    "@xcite . here",
    ", we explicitly account for the work done by external acoustic vibrations  which need not be negligible  and clarify the nature of the thermal temperature @xmath13 .",
    "we also discuss how external vibrations directly control the configurational degrees of freedom of the system in sec .",

    "then , when the system is driven by a shear stress @xmath17 in the presence of a pressure @xmath18 , and if vibrations do work on the medium at a rate @xmath19 ( where the time scale @xmath20 is conveniently chosen to be the inertial time scale , discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec:4 ] below , and we have factored out @xmath21 to make @xmath22 dimensionless ) , the first law of thermodynamics reads @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the plastic shear rate . as in eq .",
    ", the @xmath4 s are the internal variables , such as the density of flow defects , that specify the configuration of the granular medium .",
    "note that while @xmath14 , the quantity @xmath25 need not be small , as energy is being dissipated into the environment . on the other hand , the second law of thermodynamics says that the rate of change of total entropy , being the sum of the thermal and configurational contributions , must be nonnegative : @xmath26 rearranging eq .   to obtain an expression for @xmath27 , substituting into eq .  ,",
    "and using the fact that each individually variable term in the resulting inequality must be nonnegative @xcite , we arrive at the second - law constraints @xmath28 in arriving at these two constraints , we have arranged terms in such a way that terms pertaining to the degrees of freedom that belong to the same subsystem are grouped together .",
    "the dissipation rate @xmath29 , as defined in @xcite , is the difference between the rate at which inelastic work is done on the configurational subsystem and the rate at which energy is stored in the internal degrees of freedom .",
    "the second constraint implies that @xmath30 and @xmath31 must carry the same sign if they are nonzero , so that @xmath32 where @xmath33 is a non - negative thermal transport coefficient .",
    "it is already clear from this analysis that @xmath34 plays the role of a temperature .",
    "a heat flux @xmath35 flows between the granular subsystem and the reservoir when the two subsystems are not in thermodynamic equilibrium with each other .",
    "we can now set @xmath15 , and define the dimensionless variables , to be used in the rest of the development , as follows : @xmath36 thus @xmath37 is the dimensionless compactivity , and @xmath38 is the shear - stress - to - pressure ratio .",
    "@xmath39 is the excess volume of stz s  loose spots where irreversible particle rearrangements occur , incurring local topological change .",
    "the extensive volume @xmath2 of the granular medium is a sum of the total volume of grains @xmath40 plus the contributions of the configurational degrees of freedom , such as stz s and misalignments . in the simplest approximation",
    ", it varies linearly with @xmath37 : @xmath41 where @xmath42 can be interpreted as an effective volumetric expansion coefficient , and @xmath43 denotes the compactivity of a reference state .",
    "the equation of motion for @xmath37 is derived from the expression for @xmath27 . to this end , eliminating @xmath31 in eq .",
    "using eq .",
    "for an expression for @xmath27 , dividing by @xmath44 , and replacing @xmath27 by @xmath45 through the chain rule of differential calculus , the equation of motion for @xmath37 becomes @xmath46    the next step is to determine the transport coefficient @xmath47 in eq .  .",
    "because @xmath47 couples the configurational and kinetic - vibrational subsystems , we assume that it consists of additive contributions from shearing , interparticle friction , and vibrations .",
    "our strategy is to first determine @xmath47 for frictionless grains , then add in the effect of friction afterwards .",
    "we know that in the absence of vibrations and interparticle friction , the steady - state compactivity is uniquely determined by the dimensionless shear rate @xmath48 ; that is , @xmath49 .",
    "as such , direct substitution into eq .",
    "in this case yields @xmath50 . here",
    "the dimensionless work rate @xmath51 is proportional to the mechanical noise strength @xmath7 , to be discussed in greater detail in sec .",
    "[ sec:4 ] below .",
    "on the other hand , if the granular medium is vibrated but not sheared , the steady - state compactivity is determined by the vibration intensity or noise strength @xmath9",
    "@xcite : @xmath52 . as such @xmath53 .",
    "the quantity @xmath9 should be a function of the vibrational frequency and amplitude ; past studies  @xcite suggest that @xmath9 is proportional to the vibrational amplitude , and the square of the frequency .",
    "however , the detailed dependence is unimportant for the purposes of this paper which , as in the van der elst _",
    "_  experiments  @xcite , focuses on one single amplitude and frequency , unless otherwise specified .",
    "if the granular material is sheared and vibrated at the same time , it is plausible that the shear rate sets a time scale below which vibrations can not compete with shearing in allowing the system to explore different configurational states by rearranging constituent grains . referring to fig .",
    "[ fig : xvplot ] , and foreshadowing the discussion in the next subsection , the effect of vibrations to increase the packing fraction relative to an unvibrated granular medium diminishes above a certain shear rate . because the intensity of vibrations is proportional to the square of the frequency  @xcite",
    ", we propose that the diminution of the effect of vibrations is determined by the ratio @xmath54 .",
    "thus , for smooth frictionless grains , the transport coefficient is @xmath55 , \\ ] ] where @xmath56 is the relative weight of the contributions from vibrations versus shear .",

    "when the granular medium is subjected to either shear or vibrations but not both , eq .   reduces to the results discussed in the preceding paragraphs .",
    "in analogy to the direct proportionality between the mechanical noise @xmath7 and the plastic work of deformation @xmath59 alluded to above , we propose that the noise strength @xmath9 associated with vibrations is proportional to the work of external vibrations itself : @xmath60 for some constant @xmath61 .    for the case of angular , frictional grains ,",

    "this can be seen directly by setting @xmath65 in eq .   and solving for the steady - state compactivity @xmath10 .",
    "in analogy to @xmath59 and @xmath22 , we propose that @xmath63 is proportional to what we term the `` frictional noise strength '' @xmath8 , to be discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec:5 ] .",
    "at this point let us discuss the quantity @xmath66 , which denotes the disorder temperature of a driven granular material in the absence of vibrations and interparticle friction .",
    "one example of a frictionless granular material is an idealized hard - sphere system .",
    "we pointed out in  @xcite that this quantity approaches some constant @xmath67 in the limit of small shear rate @xmath68 , and becomes a rapidly increasing function of @xmath68 once the shear rate becomes comparable to the rate of intrinsic structural relaxtion , thereby implying shear - rate dilation . a convenient way to interpolate between these two limiting regimes",

    "( the appearance of the constant 3 in eq .   is purely a matter of convention . )",
    "the choice @xmath75 in eq",
    ".   stipulates a rate - strengthening response of the granular material to applied shear , at least in the large @xmath68 regime . an earlier analysis by daub and one of us  @xcite involved a model for which @xmath77 , which corresponds to rate - weakening behavior ; stick - slip instabilities did occur in that case .",
    "however , experience shows that hard - sphere systems , or `` barebone '' granular materials , should be rate strengthening  @xcite .",
    "a key result of this paper is that the condition @xmath77 can be lifted in the presence of other microscopic mechanisms , such as interparticle friction , that alter the hard - sphere rheology , allowing for the possibility of stick - slip . in other words ,",
    "we isolate the mechanism for rate - weakening behavior and stick - slip instabilities in a naturally - occurring granular medium .    meanwhile",
    ", the quantity @xmath78 , which denotes the steady - state compactivity of a vibrated granular medium , should be a decreasing function of increasing vibration intensity @xmath9 .",
    "( as we pointed out above , @xmath9 is a function of the vibration frequency and amplitude . )",
    "this is because an increase in vibration intensity causes the grains to explore more possible configurations and reduce the packing fraction  @xcite , dissipating energy in the process .",
    "since we consider only one vibration intensity , we do not propose a functional form for @xmath78 , but stipulate that it takes on one of two values depending on whether the fixed - intensity vibration is turned on or off .",
    "the combined effect of shearing , vibrations , and friction on the steady - state compactivity @xmath10 is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : xvplot ] above for vibrated and unvibrated granular media composed of frictional and frictionless particles .",
    "we now turn to the shear - transformation - zone ( stz ) theory of dense granular flow  @xcite , which directly connects macroscopic dynamics to the grain - scale physics of deformation .",
    "the latter refers to the irreversible , nonaffine granular rearrangements , along with noise induced by friction and external vibration .",
    "the stz theory has been invoked in our successful effort to reconstruct and explain constitutive friction laws  @xcite .",
    "recall our physical picture that in dense granular flow , irreversible particle rearrangements occur at rare , non - interacting soft spots with excess free volume known as stz s .",
    "the applied shear stress defines a direction relative to which stz s can be classified according to orientation , with total numbers @xmath79 and @xmath80 respectively . upon application of shear stress in the `` plus '' direction ,",
    "stz s of the minus type easily deform to become plus - type stz s .",
    "however , plus - type stz s rarely flip and acquire the minus orientation ; rather , they are annihilated readily by noise .",
    "this is described by a master equation of the form @xmath81 here , we assume that the attempt frequency @xmath82 , being the sum of mechanical and vibrational noise strengths , does not include contributions from @xmath8 , because interparticle friction serves to dissipate energy but does not open up or close voids .",
    "the inertial time scale @xmath83  @xcite , with @xmath84 , @xmath85 , and @xmath18 being the characteristic grain size , grain material density , and confining pressure , is the typical duration for a pressure - driven granular rearrangement .    if @xmath86 is the total number of grains , the plastic strain rate is @xmath87.\\ ] ] introducing the intensive variables @xmath88 which denote the density and orientational bias of stz s , and analogously the rate factors @xmath89 eqs .   and",
    "can be rewritten in terms of intensive quantities alone : @xmath90    note that @xmath91 and @xmath92 are not the only internal state variables ; others include the orientational bias of angular grains  @xcite .",
    "however , at least for grains with aspect ratio close to unity , those variables are not coupled to eq .  , and therefore play no role in plastic shear deformation .",
    "thus , internal variables other than @xmath91 and @xmath92 are expected to be immaterial in the present analysis , in which we are not explicitly concerned with the volumetric response of the system .",
    "we now substitute eqs .  , , and into eq",
    ".   for the dissipation rate @xmath29 which , according to the second law of thermodynamics , must be non - negative .",
    "we then arrive at several independent constraints on the dynamics of the system , according to the procedure outlined in  @xcite .",
    "one of these constraints says that the stz density at equilibrium equals @xmath93 .",
    "another tells us that @xmath94 , where @xmath95 is the excess volume @xmath39 of each stz normalized by the grain size @xmath96 .",
    "the yield stress parameter @xmath106 , which originates as a proportionality parameter between the mechanical noise strength @xmath7 and the plastic work of deformation , plays a crucial role in the present analysis . in  @xcite we assumed that @xmath106 is a rapidly decreasing function of the kinetic - vibrational temperature below the glass transition temperature .",
    "yet it could equally well be a decreasing function of the compactivity @xmath37 if we extend the analogy between the thermal and effective temperatures .",
    "there are two ways to understand this .",
    "first , intuition suggests that the amplitude of the fluctuations generated by shearing decreases as the granular medium becomes more tightly packed .",
    "thus @xmath106 should decrease with increasing @xmath37 .",
    "second , one expects that a larger shear stress is needed to create voids in a more densely - packed granular medium in order for it to flow . in this connection",
    ", we pointed out above that @xmath106 controls the minimum flow stress in the absence of vibrations . indeed , a @xmath106 that decreases rapidly with @xmath37 when @xmath37 is below the steady - state compactivity @xmath67 in the slow - shear limit , such as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : s0plot ] , is an essential ingredient for the emergence of stick - slip instabilities here .",
    "( color online ) the parameter @xmath106 , which provides a measure of the apparent yield stress , as a function of the compactivity @xmath37 .",
    "this quantity must be a rapidly decreasing function of @xmath37 whenever @xmath108 , and cease to be so above @xmath67 , as indicated by the vertical dashed line .",
    "( @xmath67 is the steady - state compactivity in the slow shear limit . )",
    "this condition conforms with the intuition that the stress needed to unjam a granular medium increases with the packing fraction .",
    "this , combined with the rapid increase of the steady - state compactivity @xmath10 below @xmath67 for frictional grains shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : xvplot ] , provides the apparent weakening that permits stick - slip instabilities at high enough pressure .",
    "here we have used the interpolation eq .   with @xmath109 and @xmath110 .",
    "]    on the other hand , @xmath106 must cease to be rapidly decreasing when @xmath111 , and be bounded from below by a nonzero value , so that the energy dissipated by shear - induced fluctuations ( to open up voids and create stz s , for example ) can not exceed the energy fed into the granular medium itself .",
    "thus we use @xmath112 to interpolate between the large- and small-@xmath37 regimes .",
    "we argue below that a @xmath106 with these qualitative features is one of two ingredients that provide apparent rate - weakening at intermediate shear rates .",
    "the other ingredient is the nonmonotonic variation of the steady - state compactivity @xmath10 with shear rate , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : xvplot ] . referring to eq .   and",

    "the steady - state solution to eq .   shows that if @xmath8 varies as @xmath120 at small shear rates , and saturates to some constant @xmath121 at large @xmath24 , then it is possible for @xmath37 to decrease below the zero - shear - rate limit @xmath67 for a range of intermediate shear rates .",

    "based on physical principles associated with grain - scale processes and nonequilibrium thermodynamics , these results shed light on practical problems in granular physics in earth science , industry , and beyond . for example , the notion that one can control stick - slip behavior by external acoustic vibrations may have applications in the nondestructive evaluation of materials , the control of jamming and unjamming , damage , and wear in materials processing , as well as in other industrial applications .    in the context of granular earth materials ,",
    "an important example of phenomena observed in nature and in simulations , and captured in the present stz model , is the dynamic triggering of catastrophic events  @xcite , known to occur in the presence of a granular gouge layer .",

    "characterization of the stress state immediately prior to shear failure , as well as the degree to which preseismic slip hints at the arrival of large slip events , may have important implications on the evaluation of seismic hazards .    in this paper we assumed for simplicity that the material is spatially homogeneous ; in effect , we have considered only what happens within the shear band .",
    "however , real granular materials are heterogeneous in all spatial directions , and the shear band thickness depends on a variety of factors such as boundary conditions , imposed shear rate , and aggregate shear modulus  @xcite .",
    "it may be necessary to consider a spatially heterogeneous compactivity distribution in order to fully capture irregular stick - slip dynamics seen in experiments such as  @xcite .",
    "we also assumed here for simplicity that grains do not break apart , in order to focus on the most salient physical ingredients associated with stick - slip .",
    "a simple mean - field physical model for grain fragmentation was discussed in earlier work  @xcite . there , we showed that grain fragmentation occurs readily above the crushing strength of particles , which is of the order of dozens of mpa and determined partly by the grain size .",
    "changes in particle size may have important implications on the frictional noise term @xmath8 , the shear rate regime in which instabilities may occur , and the shear strength of the granular medium . in @xcite",
    "we argued that grain fragmentation reduces the shear strength in a rate - strengthening granular material .",
    "one could also easily envision the physical picture of small grains produced by fragmentation getting trapped between large grains , causing compaction .",

    "the effect of grain fragmentation should be addressed in detail if one wants to examine the full range of possible physical behaviors in crushed rock particles .",
    "future studies will account for the roles of inertial effects , boundary conditions , the physics at the grain contacts , and grain fragmentation .",
