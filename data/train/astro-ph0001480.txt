    "accretion in neutron star low mass x - ray binaries can be studied through the spectral and timing properties of the associated x - ray emission .",
    "some of these systems exhibit quasi - periodic oscillations with frequencies ranging from a few hundred hz to more than 1000 hz ( kilohertz qpos ) .",
    "these oscillations have been observed with rossi x - ray timing explorer ( rxte ; for reviews and references see van der klis 1998 , 1999 ; swank 1998 and http://www.astro.uva.nl/@xmath3ecford/ qpos.html ) .",
    "the high frequency of these signals nearly certainly reflects the short dynamical time scale in the region near the compact object where they originate .",
    "the timing properties at low frequencies ( @xmath4 hz ) as well as the spectral properties are the basis of a classification of the systems as _ z _ or _ atoll _ sources ( hasinger & van der klis 1989 ) .",
    "the low frequency part of the fourier power spectra of the atoll sources is dominated by two features ( first identified with the exosat satellite ) : a power  law red noise component in the lowest range of the spectrum ( @xmath5 1 hz ) called very low frequency noise ( vlfn ) , and a high frequency noise ( hfn ) component which is flat at low frequency and breaks to follow a power  law with an index of about 1 at higher frequency . in some cases ,",
    "a low frequency lorentzian is also seen ( e.g. wijnands & van der klis 1999a ) .",
    "the hfn is very similar in shape to the low state noise of the black hole candidates ( bhcs ; van der klis 1994a ; yoshida et al .",
    "also the correlation between the break frequency of the hfn and the centroid frequency of the low frequency lorentzian is the same for black hole candidates and neutron stars ( wijnands & van der klis 1999a ) .",
    "these timing properties are connected with the properties of the x - ray energy spectrum .",
    "this is seen very clearly in the z sources both for the lower frequency features ( e.g. , van der klis et al .",
    "1985 ; hasinger & van der klis 1989 ; wijnands et al . 1997a ; kuulkers et al . 1997 ; kuulkers et al . 1996 ) and for the kilohertz qpos ( van der klis et al . 1996",
    "; wijnands et al . 1997b ; jonker et al . 1998 ) .",
    "similar correlations exist for atoll sources as well , both for the lower frequency features ( e.g. , hasinger & van der klis 1989 ; prins & van der klis 1997 ; et al . 1997 ) and for the kilohertz qpos ( e.g. , ford et al . 1997b ; kaaret et al .",
    "1998 ; et al . 1999 ) .",
    "also connections have been made between the frequency of the kilohertz qpos and the frequencies of the lower frequency features ( van der klis et al .",
    "1996 ; ford & van der klis 1998 ; wijnands & van der klis 1998 ) .",
    "the most obvious reason for all these correlations is that the changing mass accretion rate causes changes in the timing and spectral properties ( hasinger & van der klis 1989 ) .",
    "4u 0614 + 09 has been studied previously with exosat ( singh & apparao 1994 ; barret & grindlay 1995 ) .",
    "the exosat data showed an anti - correlation of high and low energy emission ( barret & grindlay 1995 ) , and observation with the burst and transient source experiment ( batse ) and the rxte all  sky monitor showed that this anti - correlation extends to about 100 kev ( ford et al .",
    "ray bursts from 4u 0614 + 09 were identified by oso-8 ( swank et al .",
    "1978 ) and watch ( brandt et al . 1992 ; brandt 1994 ) .",
    "the only previously published study investigating the broadband ( @xmath30.031200 hz ) x  ray power spectra is the et al .",
    "( 1997 ) study of 14 ks of rxte data , concluding that this source can be classified as an atoll source .",
    "strong kilohertz qpos were discovered in this source with rxte ( ford et al .",
    "the frequency of these qpos correlated with count rate over short time scales , but on long time scales this correlation broke down ( ford et al .",
    "1997a ; et al .",
    "a more robust correlation was shown to exist between the frequency and either the flux of a spectral component , the x - ray spectral shape , or a hardness ratio ( ford et al .",
    "1997b ; kaaret et al .",
    "1998 ; et al . 1997 ) .",
    "the physical implication is that both these latter parameters and the frequency of the kilohertz qpos are determined by a changing mass accretion rate .",
    "the 265 ks of rxte data we use here includes 75 ks previously used by ford et al .",
    "( 1997a;1997b ) and kaaret et al .",

    "we show a connection between the changes in spectral shape and both the kilohertz qpos and the lower frequency features in a large rxte data set for 4u 0614 + 09 . in ",
    "2 we describe our analysis of the spectral and timing data . in  3 we present our results and in  4 we compare our results to other atoll sources and discuss the connections to physical models .",
    "in this analysis we use data from rxte s proportional counter array ( pca ; for more instrument information see zhang et al .",
    "the total observing time is about 265 ks , approximately 75% of the total rxte observing time on 4u 0614 + 09 to date .",
    "data sets are split into near continuous time intervals of approximately 2500 s which we shall call observations .",
    "these observations are listed in table 1 .",
    "we use the 16s time ",
    "resolution standard 2 mode to calculate the colors ( as defined below ) and the 122@xmath6s time  resolution event and 0.95@xmath6s time ",
    "resolution good xenon modes for fourier analysis .",
    "no x  ray bursts were observed in this data set .",
    "we calculate a hard color , defined as the count rate in the energy band 9.7@xmath216.0 kev divided by the rate in the energy band 6.0@xmath29.7 kev , and a soft color , defined as the count rate in the energy band 3.5@xmath26.0 kev divided by the rate in the energy band 2.0@xmath23.5 kev .",
    "we also calculate the intensity , the count rate over five detectors in the energy band 2.0@xmath216.0 kev . to obtain the count rates in these exact energy ranges we interpolate linearly between count rates in the pca channels .",
    "we calculate the colors and intensity first for each time interval of 16 s. we subtract the background contribution in each band using the standard background model for the pca version 2.1b .",
    "we then calculate the average and standard deviation for each observation among the 16 s points . in the left panel of figure [ fig : hidcd ]",
    "we show a diagram of hard color vs. intensity , in the right panel a diagram of hard color vs. soft color .",
    "each point in the plot corresponds to the average of the 16 s points in one observation .",
    "the error bars indicate the standard deviation from the 16 s intervals . in the few observations where only three or four of the five pcus were on , we normalize the count rates to five detectors .",
    "most of the data fall on one curve . however , there is a set of points in the @xmath7 hardness range that appears to be shifted to higher count rate .",
    "these are the points from the 1997 observations .",
    "there is no obvious reason for the shift .",
    "the general trend in the soft color vs. hard color diagram is the same as in the diagram of hard color vs. intensity including the offset of the 1997 points .",
    "we use the diagram of hard color vs. intensity in this source instead of the color  color diagram , as was done with 4u 1608@xmath252 ( et al .",
    "1999 ) and 4u 1728@xmath234 ( & van der klis 1999 ) , because there is less scatter in count rate than in soft color .",
    "most of our observations occurred in gain _ epoch 3 _ ( between 1996 april 15 and 1999 march 22 ) .",
    "four of our observations ( a total of 9.4 ks of data ) took place in gain _ epoch 1 _ ( before 1996 march 21 ) , two ( 5 ks ) in gain _ epoch 2 _",
    "( 1996 march 21  1996 april 15 ) and two ( 6.9 ks ) took place in gain _ epoch 4 _",
    "( 1999 march 22 to present ) . in order to correct the colors for these data for the changes in instrumental response , we calculate colors of the crab nebula , which can be supposed to be constant in its colors , using the same energy bands in the various gain epochs and calculate a correction factor which we apply to the data in epochs 1 , 2 , and 4 to make the crab colors match those of epoch 3 ( c.f . kuulkers et al .",
    "the correction factor for hard colors for epochs 1,2 and 4 is about 0.2 % , 1.0 % and 0.2 % respectively .",
    "the correction factor for soft colors for epochs 1,2 and 4 is about 3.5 % , 1.0 % and 20 % respectively . finally , the correction factor for intensities for epochs 1,2 and 4 is about 1.0 % , 6.0 % and 2.0 % respectively .",
    "we have tested the validity of these corrections for epochs 1 and 2 by using spectral fits of 4u 0614 + 09 observations and the response matrices to calculate cross - epoch corrections .",
    "the correction factors obtained in this way are within 1.5 % larger in hard color , within 7 % larger in soft color and within 10 % smaller in intensity as the crab - based corrections .",
    "we parametrize the position of each observation in the hard color vs. intensity diagram by a variable , @xmath8 , which measures the distance along the curve traced out by the data ( see figure [ fig : hidcd ] ) .",
    "this is inspired by the work on z sources where the distance along the z track in the color  color diagram is parameterized by @xmath9 ( hasinger et al .",
    "1990 ; hertz et al . 1992 )",
    "and by recent results on the atoll sources 4u 1608@xmath252 ( et al . 1999 ) and 4u 1728@xmath234 ( & van der klis 1999 ) .",
    "we note that these previous studies use color  color diagrams as opposed to the color  intensity diagram we use here .",
    "in calculating @xmath8 , we choose a few points in the hardness  intensity diagram and fit a quintic spline through these points and define @xmath8 = 1 as the point ( 174,0.629 ) and @xmath10 = 3 as the point ( 1255,0.295 ) as indicated in the figure .",
    "we rescaled the axes so that both axes range over the same values .",
    "we then find the @xmath8 value of each observation by determining the closest point on the curve .",
    "the error in @xmath8 is obtained by quadratically adding the errors in @xmath8 that resulted from mapping the one sigma errors in hard color and intensity on to @xmath10 .",
    "we calculated power spectra from the high time resolution data . for each observation",
    "we make two spectra .",
    "one in which we use all the energy channels of the pca , for the fit at low frequency ( @xmath11 400 hz ) , and one in which we apply channel cuts to select high energies for the fit of the kilohertz qpos .",
    "the qpos are generally stronger at higher energies . for the kilohertz qpo",
    "fits we use a nominal energy range of 4.6@xmath297.3 kev ( unbinned pca channels 13@xmath2249 for gain epoch 3 ) , for the other epochs we use the channel range closest to these energies . for gain epoch 1",
    "we use channels 17@xmath2249 ( 4.2@xmath268.0 kev ) , for gain epoch 2 channels 13@xmath2249 ( 3.5@xmath275.6 kev ) and for gain epoch 4 we use channels 11@xmath2219 ( 4.6@xmath297.5 kev ) . in all cases , we divide the data into segments of 64 or 256 s and then bin the data in time before fourier transforming such that the nyquist frequency is always 4096 hz .",
    "we then average the individual power spectra over each observation .",
    "four representative power spectra are shown in figure [ fig : reprps ] .",
    "we fit each spectrum with a function that was found to describe all the power spectra well .",
    "the four main components are as follows .",
    "( i ) the poisson level . for the poisson level",
    "we fit a value constant in frequency .",
    "this is valid since dead - time effects are very small in this weak source .",
    "this value is approximately 2 as expected from poisson noise with the normalization of leahy et al .",
    "we fit the poisson level from 2000 to 4000 hz , and then fix it and fit the low frequency power spectra up to 400 hz .",
    "when we fit the kilohertz qpos we let the poisson level float .",
    "( ii ) a broken power ",
    "law whose power , @xmath12 , is defined as : @xmath13 where a , @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the normalization factor , break frequency and the index below and above the break . following previous work we will refer to this component as high frequency noise ( hfn ; hasinger & van der klis 1989 ) .",
    "( iii ) a power ",
    "law below 1 hz called very low frequency noise ( vlfn ; hasinger & van der klis 1989 ) .",
    "( iv ) the kilohertz qpos , described by lorentzians with best - fit centroid frequencies from 153 to 1329 hz . in one power spectrum",
    "the centroid frequencies of the qpos fall in the same frequency range as the low frequency noise ( @xmath5 400 hz ) , in this case we include the shape of the low frequency noise in our fit of the kilohertz qpos .    in some cases we add two additional components to the fit function : a lorentzian with a best - fit centroid frequency between 6 and 38 hz ( fwhm 2@xmath219 hz ) , and another lorentzian with a best - fit frequency between 97 and 158 hz ( fwhm 22@xmath2144 hz ) .",
    "other atoll sources show similar components in their power spectra , as seen with ginga in 4u 1608@xmath252 ( yoshida et al .",
    "1993 ) and with rxte in 4u 1705@xmath244 ( ford , van der klis & kaaret 1998 ) , 4u 1728@xmath234 ( ford & van der klis 1998 ) , 4u 1820@xmath230 ( zhang et al .",
    "1998a ) , 4u 1608@xmath252 ( et al .",

    "the @xmath17/dof of our fits are typically 1.0 to 1.4 with 127 to 164 degrees of freedom .",
    "the broken power  law component of the power spectra is similar to that in previous measurements in other atoll sources and black hole candidates .",
    "the rms fractional amplitude ( 0.1@xmath2400 hz ) ranges from 3 to 30 % .",
    "the average value of @xmath15 is close to zero ( @xmath18 ) , and the average value of @xmath16 is close to unity ( 0.92 ) .",
    "there is no evidence for a second break in this component as is seen in some descriptions of the power spectra of the bhcs and the atoll source 4u 1608@xmath252 ( yoshida et al .",
    "1993 ) . above @xmath8 values of 2 ,",
    "the broken power ",
    "law has a peaked shape ( hasinger & van der klis 1989 ) : @xmath15 is between @xmath19 and @xmath20 and @xmath16 is between 1 and 2 .",
    "these power spectra could also be fitted with a broken power ",
    "law with @xmath21 and @xmath22 if we add an extra lorentzian with a centroid frequency near @xmath14 .",
    "the fits reported here , however , do not include this lorentzian as it is less than 3@xmath1 significant in most cases .",
    "historically other functions have been used to describe this hfn component : a cut - off power ",
    "law described by @xmath23 ( hasinger @xmath24 van der klis 1989 ) , or lorentzians with a central frequency of zero hz ( grove et al .",
    "1994 ; olive et al .",
    "we have tried such functions , but the @xmath25-test statistics show no preference for one of the functions . we employ the broken power ",
    "law because it uses fewer free parameters ( with the other functions we often need to add an extra lorentzian with a frequency near @xmath14 ) .",
    "fits of the correlations ( see below ) also have better @xmath17/dof with the broken power  law function .",
    "the vlfn is present in some of the intervals of march , november and december 1998 ( see table 2 and fig .",

    "this state ( extremely soft with vlfn ) is often referred to as the _ banana _ state ( hasinger & van der klis 1989 ) . in all but one of the observations where the vlfn was present , it is accompanied by a significant hfn component with rms fractional amplitude between 3.1 and 13.6 % ( see table 2 ) .",
    "the kilohertz qpo parameters ( fitted in the energy range 4.697.3 kev ) are listed in table 1 .",

    "reported here , 69 % have a significance of 3.5 to 8.9 @xmath1 and 31 % have a significance of 3.0 to 3.5 @xmath1 .",
    "the qpo with the highest observed centroid frequency , 1329 @xmath0 4 hz is 3.5 @xmath1 significant .",
    "this significance is for a single trial ( van der klis 1989 ) .",
    "we estimate that the number of trials is about 40 based on the width of the detection interval ( @xmath3 1000 hz ) and the width of the qpo ( @xmath3 25 hz ) at 1329 hz .",
    "including these trials reduces the significance to 2.4 @xmath1 .",
    "we note that the qpo frequency of 1329 hz deviates from the linear trend seen for the other kilohertz qpos ( fig .",

    "models explaining the kilohertz qpos predict , for different reasons , that the centroid frequencies increase with mass accretion rate ( miller , lamb & psaltis 1998 ; titarchuk , lapidus & muslinov 1998 ; stella & vietri 1998 ) .    the present data indicate a link between @xmath8 and mass accretion rate .",
    "the correlation between break frequency of the hfn and @xmath8 further strengthens this link .",
    "the suggestion that the break frequency tracks the mass accretion rate was previously noted for atoll sources ( van der klis 1994a ; prins et al .",
    "the only possible exceptions to a correlation between break frequency and inferred mass accretion rate so far are sax j1808.4@xmath23658 ( wijnands & van der klis 1998 ) and slx 1735@xmath2269 ( wijnands & van der klis 1999b ) where at higher count rates the break frequency is smaller .",
    "the exception to the correlation in these sources may be related to the fact that they were observed at especially low inferred mass accretion rates .",
    "the two spectra of slx 1735@xmath2269 have exceptionally low break frequencies of 2.3 and 0.11 hz ( wijnands & van der klis 1999b ) .",
    "we note however , that accretion rates are inferred only from the fluxes and the relative change in flux is small , about 20 % in slx 1735@xmath2269 and about 40 % in sax j1808.4@xmath23658 .",
    "the anti  correlation in these sources may be due to this small dynamic range .",
    "the changes in energy spectra , reflected in a changing @xmath8 , are likely driven by changes in the mass accretion rate , as previously suggested for 4u 0614 + 09 by the correlation between the frequency of the kilohertz qpos with the blackbody flux ( ford et al .",
    "1997b ) or with the index of the power  law ( kaaret et al . 1998 ) .",
    "larger values of @xmath8 correspond to softer spectra , higher fluxes , and larger inferred mass accretion rates . from color ",
    "color diagrams , at low inferred mass accretion rate there is an anti - correlation of flux and hardness , which is manifest also in spectral studies of atoll sources : e.g. , 4u 1636@xmath253 ( breedon et al .",
    "1986 ) , 4u 1735@xmath244 ( smale et al . 1986 ) , 4u 1705@xmath244 ( langmeier et al .",

    "1996 ) , and others ( van der klis & van paradijs 1994 ) .",
    "one long - standing explanation of this anti - correlation is in terms of thermal comptonization models ( e.g. sunyaev & titarchuk 1980 ) . in the thermal model",
    "the increasing soft x - ray flux cools the comptonizing electron plasma , leading to a decrease in its temperature and thus a decrease in hard x - ray flux .",
    "the vlfn component might correspond to motion of the source along the track in the color - color diagram during an observation , as suggested for z sources ( van der klis 1991 ) .",
    "observations of cyg x@xmath22 however indicate that the motion in the z track is at most partly responsible for the vlfn ( wijnands et al .",
    "bildsten ( 1995 ) suggested that the vlfn is caused by unstable burning of nuclear fuel in a regime of time dependent helium burning .",
    "the dependence of the strength of the vlfn on the mass accretion could then be explained by a slower mode of combustion that sets in at higher mass accretion rate .",
    "this slower mode of combustion leads to stronger long time scale variations .",
    "the 6@xmath238 hz lorentzians are similar to the horizontal branch oscillations ( hbos ) in the z sources in their rms fractions and correlations with @xmath8 and @xmath30 .",
    "the hbos sometimes show a saturation of the hbo frequency with respect to @xmath9 at a frequency of about 60 hz ( gx 17 + 2 , wijnands et al . 1997b ; cyg x-2 , wijnands et al .",
    "1998a ) . in 4u 0614 + 09",
    "the lorentzian frequency only goes up to 38 hz and we do not observe a saturation of the lorentzian frequency with respect to @xmath8 ( fig . [",
    "fig : saqpo ] ) , but we do observe a saturation of the break frequency of the hfn with respect to @xmath8 ( fig . [",
    "fig : salf ] ) .",
    "the 97@xmath2158 hz lorentzians could be related to the 65@xmath2317 hz oscillations seen in some of the black hole candidates ( gro j1655 - 40 , remillard et al .",
    "1999a ; xte j1550 - 564 , remillard et al .",
    "1999b ; grs 1915 + 105 , morgan et al .",
    "these oscillations fall in the same frequency range as the 97@xmath2158 hz lorentzians we observe but have weaker rms fractional amplitudes ( @xmath31 % ) . in grs 1915 + 105 ( 6568 hz ; morgan et al .",
    "1997 ) and gro j1655 - 40 ( 281317 hz ; remillard et al .",
    "1999a ) the oscillations were about constant in frequency . in xte j1550 - 564 however ,",
    "the frequency varied considerably from 184 to 284 hz ( homan et al . 1999 ; remillard et al .",
    "1999a ) .",
    "for what concerns the other features in the power spectra , the high frequency noise component in atoll sources is very similar to the low - state noise in black hole candidates ( van der klis 1994a , b ) .",
    "the bhcs show a correlation of power density at the break with break frequency ( belloni & hasinger 1989 ) .",
    "the relation between power density at the break and break frequency is similar in 4u 0614 + 09 and the bhcs in the low state ( fig .",
    "[ fig : bhpl ] ) .",
    "however in the region where the break frequencies of 4u 0614 + 09 and the bhcs become comparable ( the intermediate and very high state of the bhcs ) 4u 0614 + 09 does show a larger power density .",
    "the hfn may result from a superposition of shots with the break corresponding to the shots with the longest durations , as proposed for the bhcs ( e.g. belloni & hasinger 1990 ) .",
    "the time scale of the shots could be set by the lifetime of clumps ( van der klis 1994b ) and could decrease with mass accretion rate ( ford & van der klis 1998 ) .",
    "stella & vietri ( 1998 ) have proposed that the 6@xmath238 hz lorentzian is caused by relativistic frame dragging in the inner accretion disk ( lense - thirring precession ) .",
    "the frequency of the lorentzian depends on the frequency of the upper kilohertz qpo , assumed to be fixed by the keplerian frequency at the inner edge of the disk .",
    "stella & vietri ( 1998 ) predict a scaling index of 2 , but see corrections by morsink & stella ( 1998 ) .",
    "our value of 2.46 @xmath0 0.07 is significantly different from 2 .",
    "also , as in 4u 1728@xmath234 ( ford & van der klis 1998 ) , the required ratio of the moment of interia over the neutron star mass is unphysically large if the nodal precession frequency is the qpo frequency .",
    "however this is not a problem if the qpo frequency is twice the nodal precession frequency ( stella & vietri 1998 ) .",
    "titarchuk & osherovich ( 1999 ) associate the 6@xmath238 hz lorentzian with radial oscillations in a boundary layer where the disk adjusts to the rotating neutron star and the break frequency of the hfn with the diffusion time scale in this region .",
    "the correlations in 4u 0614 + 09 of the _ lower _ kilohertz qpo vs. 6@xmath238 hz lorentzian and hfn break frequency do not fall on the predicted curves .",
    "in fact the correlations with respect to the _ higher _ frequency kilohertz qpo are closer to those predicted .",
    "in addition there is a high frequency turnover of the break frequency which is not predicted ( fig .",
    "[ fig : khzvsqpo ] ) .",
    "we report here the highest frequency qpo of any low mass x - ray binary to date at 1329 @xmath0 4 hz .",
    "such a high frequency oscillation puts new constraints on the structure of neutron stars ( miller , lamb & cook 1998 ) .",
    "the mass and radius are bounded by : @xmath39 and @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the dimensionless angular momentum of the star , @xmath42 ( e.g. miller , lamb & psaltis 1998 ) .",
    "this expansion in @xmath41 is valid for spin frequencies less than about 400 hz ( miller , lamb & cook 1998 ) .",
    "for @xmath43 3@xmath44 g @xmath45 ( cook , shapiro & teukolsky 1994 ; miller , lamb & psaltis 1998 ) and @xmath46 hz , the inferred spin frequency of the star , the kilohertz qpo at 1329 @xmath0 4 hz constrains @xmath47 and @xmath48 to @xmath49 and @xmath50  km . these constraints rule out the extremely stiff eos . a mean - field theory ( ` l ' in cook , shapiro & teukolsky 1994 ) is ruled out and the tensor interaction eos ( ` m ' in cook",
    ", shapiro & teukolsky 1994 ) is ruled out except for a very small range of r and m. however we note , that this qpo has a single - trial significance of only 3.5 @xmath1 . to put constraints on the softer eos",
    "the kilohertz qpo must be observed at higher frequencies . for a slow rotating star , 2010",
    "hz would rule out the `",
    "u'-type eos ( wiringa , fiks & fabrocini 1988 ) and 1920 hz would rule out the commonly used ` fps ' eos ( cook , shapiro & teukolsky 1994 ) .",
    "we note that there is no obvious saturation of the kilohertz qpo frequency with respect to @xmath8 , our chosen indicator of mass accretion rate ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : sakhzqpo ] ) .",
    "however the kilohertz qpo at 1329 hz does deviate from the linear trend seen for the other kilohertz qpos .",
    "such a saturation where the frequency becomes independent of the chosen mass accretion rate indicator would be an indication for the marginally stable orbit predicted by general relativity ( kluzniak , michelson & wagoner 1990 ; kaaret , ford & chen 1997 ; miller , lamb & psaltis 1998 ) .",
    "such a saturation has been reported in 4u 1820@xmath230 ( zhang et al .",
    "1998a ; kaaret et al .",
    "1999 ) .",
    "we found that , @xmath51 , the frequency difference between the upper and the lower kilohertz qpo peak is constant in 4u 0614 + 09 , confirming the results of ford et al .",
    "( 1997a ) .",
    "this matches the prediction of the beat frequency mechanism ( e.g. miller , lamb & psaltis 1998 ) in which @xmath51 is equal to the spin frequency and therefore constant .",
    "however observations of five sources have shown a significant decrease in @xmath51 as the frequency of the kilohertz qpos increases ( sco x1 , van der klis 1997 ; 4u 1608 - 52 , et al .",
    "1998a , b ; 4u 1735 - 44 , ford et al . 1998 ; 4u 1728 - 34 , & van der klis 1999 ; 4u 1702 - 42 , markwardt et al .",
    "1999a , b ) . to examine the trend of @xmath51 with increasing qpo frequency in 4u 0614 + 09 we plot @xmath51 vs. the frequency of the lower frequency kilohertz qpo for all these sources in figure [ fig : freqdiff_alls ] .",
    "we find that at low qpo frequency ( @xmath52 hz ) @xmath51 in 4u 0614 + 09 is consistent with sco x1 and 4u 160852 and at high qpo frequency ( 750820 hz ) inconsistent ( 2.88.0 @xmath1 different ) .",

    "<S> we study the correlations between timing and x - ray spectral properties in the low mass x - ray binary 4u 0614 + 09 using a large ( 265-ks ) data set obtained with the rossi x - ray timing explorer . </S>",
    "<S> we find strong quasi - periodic oscillations ( qpos ) of the x - ray flux , like the kilohertz qpos in many other x - ray binaries with accreting neutron stars , with frequencies ranging from 1329 hz down to 418 hz and , perhaps , as low as 153 hz . </S>",
    "<S> we report the highest frequency qpo yet from any low mass x - ray binary at 1329 @xmath0 4 hz , which has implications for neutron star structure . </S>",
    "<S> this qpo has a 3.5 @xmath1 single - trial significance , for an estimated 40 trials the significance is 2.4 @xmath1 . besides the kilohertz qpos , the fourier power spectra show four additional components : high frequency noise ( hfn ) , described by a broken power  </S>",
    "<S> law with a break frequency between 0.7 and 45 hz , very low frequency noise ( vlfn ) , which is fitted as a power  </S>",
    "<S> law below 1 hz , and two broad lorentzians with centroid frequencies varying from 6 to 38 hz and 97 to 158 hz , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> we find strong correlations between the frequencies of the kilohertz qpos , the frequency of the 6@xmath238 hz broad lorentzian , the break frequency of the hfn , the strength of both the hfn and the vlfn and the position of the source in the hard x - ray color vs. intensity diagram . </S>",
    "<S> the frequency of the 97@xmath2158 hz lorentzian does not correlate with these parameters . </S>",
    "<S> we also find that the relation between power density and break frequency of the hfn is similar to that established for black hole candidates in the low state . </S>",
    "<S> we suggest that the changing mass accretion rate is responsible for the correlated changes in all these parameters .    </S>",
