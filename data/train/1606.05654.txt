    "therefore it is crucial to investigate and understand the features that are invariant due to symmetry transformations .",
    "one example of great interest is the symmetry associated with scale invariance .",
    "this symmetry has been essential in the study of complicated systems such as the thermodynamics @xcite and dynamics @xcite near critical points , and biological complexes @xcite . without taking into account this symmetry",
    ", these problems would be otherwise intractable .",
    "although scale invariance has had resounding success in studying the energetics and critical dynamics of these rather difficult systems , the role of scale invariance on far - from - equilibrium coherent quantum dynamics has yet to be fully understood . in this work",
    "we are specifically interested in the scale invariant far - from - equilibrium quantum dynamics , where the governing equations of a system remain unchanged when subject to dilations of the spatial and temporal coordinates :    @xmath0    below we use @xmath1 to denote the coordinates of the @xmath2-particles with @xmath3 , and @xmath4 as the scaling factor .",
    "one very promising platform to study the role of scale invariance in far - from - equilibrium dynamics is cold atom systems .",
    "cold atom systems are unique in their tunability present in experiments .",
    "it is possible to prepare cold atom systems with a wide range of initial conditions and interaction parameters .",
    "this control has led to both experimental and theoretical studies concerning a wide range of dynamical phenomena , such as the dynamics of expansion and collapse @xcite , breathing modes @xcite , solitons @xcite , and quench dynamics @xcite .",
    "a few theoretical efforts have also been made to understand far - from - equilibrium coherent quantum dynamics in fermion superfluids @xcite .",

    "the fact that the many body wave function is a homogeneous function , implies that the unitary evolution of a quantum state can be effectively described by a simple scale transformation , i.e. eq .  ( [ scaling ] ) . by extension",

    "we study the signatures of scale invariance on the quantum dynamics of a two dimensional bose einstein condensate with attractive contact interactions .",
    "although the scale invariance has been studied in the thermodynamics of this system @xcite , the role of scale invariance in the far - from - equilibrium dynamics has yet to be determined .",
    "we restrict ourselves to an isotropic single parameter scaling solution and show how the scale invariance leads to distinct features present in the density profile of the gas .",

    "secondly , this density profile will undergo oscillations , the frequencies of which satisfy a robust discrete scaling relation .",
