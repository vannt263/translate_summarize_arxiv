    "during hierarchical assembly of galaxy clusters through accretion and mergers , gravitational energy is transferred to random motion of the intracluster matter .",
    "most of the random motion of baryonic matter is thermalized , leading to x - ray emitting temperatures as well as high thermal pressure support which sustains the intracluster gas against a gravitational collapse .",
    "in addition to the thermal motion , there can be other sources of pressure support in the intracluster gas , including bulk motion , turbulence , cosmic rays , and magnetic fields .",
    "the non - thermal pressure support is difficult to detect directly using x - ray or sunyaev - zeldovich ( sz ) observations due to the small electron velocities it is associated with .",
    "however , if not accounted for , it causes a bias in the cluster mass estimated from x - ray or sz observations assuming hydrostatic equilibrium between gravity and thermal , rather than total , pressure .    while observational evidence of intracluster non - thermal pressure exists ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "we discuss other sources of non - thermal pressure support in sect.[sec : dis ] , discuss future research directions in sect.[sec : test ] , and conclude in sect.[sec : con ] .",
    "we use the following cosmological parameters of a flat @xmath2cdm cosmology : matter content @xmath3 , dark energy content @xmath4 , hubble parameter @xmath5 , slope of the initial power spectrum @xmath6 , and the normalization of the matter power spectrum @xmath7 .",
    "we decompose the total pressure into a thermal ( ` th ' ) and a non - thermal ( ` nth ' ) part , @xmath8 . we focus our study on what is usually considered as the major source of @xmath9 : the non - thermal random motion in the intracluster gas , and refer to it as ` turbulence ' without distinguishing it from isotropic bulk motions .",
    "other possible sources of non - thermal pressure , e.g. , magnetic fields and cosmic rays , are neglected for the moment .",
    "we shall discuss them later in sect.[sec : dis ] .",
    "we write the non - thermal pressure as @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the mass density of intracluster gas and @xmath12 is the one - dimensional velocity dispersion of the non - thermal random motion .",
    "similarly , we write the thermal pressure as @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the one - dimensional velocity dispersion of the thermal motion .",

    "we then define the ` non - thermal fraction , ' @xmath16 , as @xmath17 as @xmath18 and @xmath19 can be regarded as thermal and turbulence energies per unit mass per degree of freedom , respectively , the non - thermal fraction reflects the evolution of turbulence and thermal energies in the intracluster medium .    note that turbulent motions exist in the intracluster medium only as a transient phenomenon . given a sufficiently long time",
    ", they will all dissipate into heat , and the intracluster gas will be in perfect hydrostatic equilibrium .",
    "therefore , how much turbulence there is in a cluster depends predominantly on its dynamical state , and the amplitude of intracluster turbulence reflects the past and undergoing growth of the cluster via accretion and merger events .      during the continuous growth of a galaxy cluster in mass",
    ", gravitational energy is converted into kinetic energy , and then further into turbulence and thermal energy . at each position in the cluster , we write the partition of turbulence and thermal energy increases as @xmath20 i.e. , during cluster growth , the increase in turbulence energy is @xmath21 times the increase in thermal energy for a local unit of intracluster gas .",
    "physically , kinetic energy can be converted into turbulence and thermal energy through different processes , e.g. , merger and accretion shocks and wakes , cluster core sloshing and galaxy wakes , with the help of plasma instabilities .",
    "gravitational energy can also be adiabatically converted into thermal and turbulence energy via adiabatic contraction . supported by hydrodynamic simulations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we consider the low mach - number intracluster shocks created at merger events or merger - induced complex flows called ` internal shocks ' to be the major machinery of energy conversion . consequently , we shall call the parameter @xmath22 in equation  ( [ eq : etadefi ] ) the ` turbulence injection efficiency ' of the internal shocks .",
    "this parameter should be determined primarily by the mach number of the internal shocks .",
    "we shall assume that @xmath22 is a constant .",
    "while it is mainly for simplicity , this assumption is supported by the fact that the mach numbers of the merger induced shocks are expected to be nearly universal from simple physical arguments ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * and references therein ) . in simulations ,",
    "the redshift and radius dependencies of the internal shock mach number are indeed found to be weak within the virial region of the cluster ( see , e.g. , fig.6 of @xcite for the redshift dependence , and fig.9 of @xcite for the radius dependence ; see also @xcite for a comparison of different simulation methods , although at lower resolutions ) .",
    "we shall discuss the consequence of additional dependence of @xmath22 in sect.[sec : dis ] .",
    "the energy injected into the intracluster gas during the cluster mass growth gets distributed over different radii as follows .",
    "to the first order , the intracluster pressure profile , and thus the energy density profile of the intracluster gas , is self - similar @xcite . to maintain this self - similarity during the mass growth of a cluster",
    ", the energy density must increase in a multiplicative fashion , i.e. , the energy gained by a gas particle in the cluster is proportional to the existing energy of that particle , @xmath23 . it has been shown numerically that this near self - similarity holds even after violent major - merger events @xcite .",
    "this can again be understood physically by the fact that the intracluster gas is processed by shocks whose mach numbers do not vary very much as the shocks travel across the whole cluster .    in previous analytical studies ,",
    "different turbulence energy injection scenarios have been considered . @xcite",
    "consider turbulence injection at single merger events , and assume that a fraction of the @xmath24 work done by the in - falling sub - cluster is converted into intracluster turbulence energy .",
    "the volume swept by the sub - cluster in which turbulence is injected is estimated from the virial radius of the main cluster and the radius of the sub - cluster after ram - pressure stripping , following @xcite . in their model ,",
    "the turbulence injected roughly scales with the thermal energy of the cluster , which is in accordance with the @xmath25 relation in our considerations , although they do not consider the radial distribution of the energy .",
    "@xcite also consider the non - thermal pressure support in the intracluster medium contributed by turbulence . in their work",
    ", turbulence is driven by the inflows of intergalactic gas across the virial accretion shocks .",
    "they assume an exponential decay of the radial profile of the turbulence - to - thermal fraction .",
    "the correlation length and the amplitude of the profile need to be obtained from fitting to observations .",
    "since their turbulence driving mechanism is very different from what we consider , their results on turbulence pressure differ from ours , which we will discuss in sect.[sec : nthfrac ] .",
    "in addition to the structure formation process , magnetothermal instability may drive turbulence in the presence of intracluster magnetic fields and a long - standing negative temperature gradient @xcite .",
    "the turbulence driven by magnetothermal instability is found to be generally additive to the turbulence produced by structure formation .",
    "we shall not consider this potential source of non - thermal pressure in this paper .      once injected , turbulence in the intracluster gas starts to dissipate .",
    "this process can be described by the standard theory of dissipation of turbulence ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "any kinetic energy on the viscous scale ( the so - called kolmogorov microscale ) dissipates rapidly into heat .",
    "the overall time - scale of dissipation of turbulent kinetic energy , @xmath26 , is controlled by the efficiency of energy transfer from the largest scales , where most of the turbulence energy is stored , to smaller scales .",
    "this time - scale is linearly related to the eddy turn - over time of the largest eddies .",
    "consider the largest eddy at a radius @xmath27 from the cluster center to have a size proportional to @xmath27 , and a typical peculiar velocity on the order of the local orbital velocity given by @xmath28 , with @xmath29 being the corresponding angular velocity , and @xmath30 the cluster mass within a radius @xmath27 . the dissipation time - scale , @xmath31 , is then proportional to the local dynamical time , i.e. , @xmath32 .",
    "we write @xmath33 where @xmath34 is a coefficient determined by microphysics .",
    "this definition of @xmath26 allows the preferred value of @xmath34 to be around unity , see sect.[sec : res ] .    to compute equation  ( [ eq : td ] ) , we use",
    "@xmath30 computed from the nfw density profile @xcite , @xmath35 where @xmath36 and @xmath37 and @xmath38 are the virial mass and radius , respectively , and @xmath39 is the concentration parameter , for which we use the fitting formula developed by @xcite .",
    "the relation , @xmath40 , derives from our assumption on the largest eddy size at each radius .",
    "large coherent motions can be easily broken into eddies with sizes proportional to @xmath27 owing to the geometry and density structure of the cluster .",
    "whether the eddies at cluster outskirts could reach such large sizes depends on the turbulence injection mechanism . in hydrodynamical simulations , large - scale flows and low - curvature shocks",
    "are observed at cluster outskirts ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , enabling the formation of large size turbulence eddies .",
    "if intracluster turbulence is coupled with magnetic fields , turbulence can give rise to magnetohydrodynamical waves which transfer energy from magnetic fluctuations to relativistic particles on small scales .",
    "this process provides an additional channel for energy dissipation at high @xmath41 modes ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    ". however , this does not affect the evolution of turbulence pressure , as the turbulence energy is contained predominantly in the largest scales which has the longest timescale .",
    "in other words , the turbulence dissipation time - scale is insensitive to the small scale physics , including the resistivity and viscosity of the gas .",
    "the dynamical time - scales in a galaxy cluster increase significantly from the inner region to the outskirts due to a steep slope of the density profile .",
    "it then follows from equation ( [ eq : td ] ) that the turbulence dissipation time in the inner region of a galaxy cluster is much shorter than that in the outskirts . as a consequence ,",
    "the magnitude of the non - thermal fraction at each radius evolves roughly independently with different time - scales .",
    "the scalings @xmath23 and @xmath42 suggest that the injection of turbulence energy can also be treated independently at each radius .",
    "these considerations motivate our focusing on the evolution of turbulence and thermal energies at a single eulerian radius , @xmath27 .",
    "the turbulence energy dissipates with a typical time - scale @xmath26 , and is sourced by the mass growth of a cluster in a way that @xmath43 .",
    "we thus write the following first - order differential equation to describe the evolution of @xmath19 at a given radius @xmath27 , @xmath44 in general , the terms @xmath45 , @xmath26 , and hence @xmath19 , are all functions of radius , mass , and redshift of a cluster .",
    "the total one - dimensional velocity dispersion , @xmath46 , is determined by the depth of cluster s gravitational potential .",
    "we present a method to compute @xmath45 in sect.[sec : ptot ] , and regard it as a given quantity here . equation ( [ eq : sigkin ] ) then forms an initial value problem .",
    "once the initial condition , @xmath47 , at the initial time , @xmath48 , is chosen , we can use equation ( [ eq : sigkin ] ) to solve for the evolution of @xmath49 for any later times , @xmath50 , given the mass growth history of the cluster , @xmath51 .    the parameters in our model , @xmath34 and @xmath22 , have physical origins and therefore are not free parameters . from the current knowledge of intracluster gas ,",
    "however , their values are not yet known precisely .",
    "the turbulence injection efficiency , @xmath22 , ranges between @xmath52 and @xmath53 by definition .",
    "a high value of @xmath54 is expected from the low mach number ( mach number @xmath55 ) of the internal shocks @xcite .",
    "the parameter @xmath56 is expected from theory of turbulence , with rather large uncertainty .",
    "we will discuss the range of their values in more detail in sect.[sec : res ] .",
    "three time - scales determine our problem : the turbulence dissipation time - scale , @xmath26 ; the time elapsed between the initial time and the time of observation , @xmath57 , which in some situations characterizes the age of the cluster ; and a time - scale characterizing the mass growth rate of the cluster defined by @xmath58 since @xmath59 also determines the rate at which turbulence energy grows , we refer to it as both the ` cluster growth time - scale ' and the ` turbulence growth time - scale ' .",
    "the ratios of these three time - scales determine , to a large extent , the value of the non - thermal fraction , @xmath16 .    using",
    "@xmath59 , equation ( [ eq : sigkin ] ) can be re - written as @xmath60 let us find an attractor solution defined by @xmath61 inserting this relation into equation ( [ eq : evorewrite ] ) , we find the limiting value of the non - thermal fraction , @xmath62 it is then apparent that the @xmath63 is smaller than or equal to @xmath22 .",
    "the upper limit is reached when intracluster turbulence grows much faster than it dissipates ( @xmath64 ) , while in the opposite limit ( @xmath65 ) the non - thermal fraction is very small , @xmath66 . when growth and dissipation time - scales are roughly equal ( @xmath67 ) , @xmath68 approaches a non - negligible fraction of @xmath22 . in general , @xmath26 and @xmath59 ( hence @xmath16 )",

    "so far , we have assumed the turbulence pressure to be isotropic . whereas an isotropic state usually is a higher entropy state to which a system generally evolves , physical conditions , for instance the density stratification in the intracluster medium , can trigger an anisotropic velocity field .",

    "anisotropic magnetic field , if exists , can also induce anisotropic turbulence pressure .",
    "this is beyond the scope of this paper . in any case , in the presence of anisotropy ,",
    "the non - thermal fraction given in this paper should be interpreted as the ratio of the radial components of @xmath19 and @xmath45 , whose evolution is described by equation ( [ eq : sigkin ] ) .",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "if , as commonly anticipated , magnetic fields in clusters are amplified by turbulence dynamo @xcite , then its saturation time - scale is set by the eddy turnover time - scale , and its energy dissipates as turbulence energy dissipates .",
    "the non - thermal pressure it contributes to can then be modelled conveniently by adding another source term to the r.h.s . of equation  ( [ eq : sigkin ] ) , and its amplitude",
    "is limited by that of the turbulence pressure .",
    "cosmic rays are expected to be generated in accretion and merger shocks with high mach numbers .",
    "however , efforts to detect signatures of cosmic ray ions in galaxy clusters have so far resulted in null results , which limits the cosmic ray pressure contribution to a few percent of the thermal pressure in several clusters ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "recently , some numerical studies @xcite show that residual , collective accelerated motion in the gas at cluster outskirts contributes to additional deviation from hydrostatic equilibrium .",
    "this ` acceleration bias ' can not be taken into account as a form of pressure ; however , it also originates from recent merger / accretion of the cluster , and has a dissipation time - scale of the sound crossing time which is comparable to the dynamical time defined in equation  ( [ eq : td ] ) .",
    "therefore one naturally expects that the acceleration bias increases towards larger radii due to significantly longer sound crossing times there .",
    "this may enable a treatment of the acceleration bias using the same framework of our model by considering its effect at each eulerian radius separately .",
    "the fitting formula for @xmath16 proposed by @xcite , to which we compared our results in sect.[sec : simcomp ] , is not optimal in describing the simulation results since it assumes a factorizable form in terms of radius , cluster mass , and redshift . in general , these dependencies are coupled to each other , as found in both simulations and our model . since our model predicts how these dependencies couple , e.g. , radial dependence of @xmath16 is stronger for low redshift and less massive clusters , one can test the existence of the predicted coupling in numerical simulations .",
    "we have compared our model with simulations and observations using the average properties of cluster samples . with the help of hydrodynamical simulations with high time resolution ,",

    "this would enable a far more detailed comparison between the predicted non - thermal pressure and simulations of individual clusters .",
    "although comparison with observations is limited to cluster samples , here too , exists a large room for improvements .",
    "for instance , the redshift evolution and mass dependence of the hse mass bias could be studied and tested against the predicted trend .",
    "the biggest uncertainty in our non - thermal fraction model so far is the uncertainty in two physical parameters : the turbulence injection efficiency @xmath22 , and especially @xmath34 , the ratio between the turbulence dissipation time and the local dynamical time .",
    "we have constrained them to be @xmath172 and @xmath173 from comparison to simulation results of non - thermal fraction and its mass dependence .",
    "we find that @xmath174 is preferred from the existing observations .",
    "numerical experiments of , e.g. , turbulence generation by a single minor merger event and turbulence dissipation in an isolated cluster , can help us further pin down their values , as well as prove the basis of our theoretical model .",
    "we have developed an analytical model for non - thermal pressure of intracluster gas .",
    "the key part of this model is a model of the non - thermal fraction , @xmath175 , which is based on a description of the evolution of turbulence energy in the intracluster medium in the form of a first - order differential equation .",
    "three time - scales are responsible for the non - thermal fraction . in particular , the ratio of @xmath59 and @xmath26 determines the limiting value of the non - thermal fraction , while the ratio of @xmath176 and min(@xmath177 ) determines how much the value of @xmath68 at @xmath50 has replaced its initial value and approached its limiting value .",
    "the other parts of our non - thermal pressure model include a model of the total pressure , which is based on a re - interpretation of the self - similar model of gas pressure profile presented in @xcite , and a model of the average mass growth history of clusters presented in @xcite .",
    "the non - thermal fraction predicted by our model lies in the range seen in numerical simulations .",
    "generic trends of the non - thermal fraction , e.g. , the increase with radius , cluster mass and redshift , seen in numerical simulations are successfully reproduced by our analytical model .",
    "our analytical model gives physical insights into the cause of the generic trends .",
    "for example , the increasing non - thermal fraction with radii is explained by the increasing turbulence dissipation time - scale , and the increase at higher redshift is mainly due to the higher cluster growth rate .",
    "combining our model of the non - thermal fraction and the self - similar model of the total pressure profile , we obtain thermal pressure profiles which match well with the existing simulations and observations .",
