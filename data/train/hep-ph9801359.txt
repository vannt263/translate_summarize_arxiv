    "the search for a higgs boson , the last unobserved particle predicted by the minimal electro - weak standard model  ( sm ) , is a primary objective for experiments at operating colliders , as well as for the planning of future colliders .",
    "the potential discovery of a fundamental higgs particle  either at a hadron collider ( tevatron , lhc ) or at a @xmath2-collider ( lep2 , next linear collider)will initiate detailed studies and measurements of its properties like spin , parity , decay branching fractions , total width , and the couplings with gauge bosons and fermions .",
    "any deviation of these results from the sm predictions will be a signature of new physics beyond the sm .",
    "electro - weak precision tests at lep1 are sensitive to the symmetry breaking sector and a fundamental higgs through radiative corrections to the electro - weak observables .",
    "the minimal sm and the most popular extensions ( supersymmetry ) favour a neutral higgs boson in the intermediate - mass region between  @xmath3 and just above  @xmath4 . in this mass range ,",
    "the search for the higgs boson and the study of its properties are delicate phenomenological and experimental problems , mostly because of large irreducible backgrounds .",
    "in fact , the complementary information provided by different colliders has to be used  @xcite and a photon linear collider  ( plc ) hosted at a @xmath2 linear collider  @xcite plays an important rle in this context .",
    "for example , the total higgs width  @xmath5 , which is related directly to the fundamental couplings , can be determined in a model - independent way by simultaneously using results from various machines  @xcite .",
    "this procedure combines the branching ratios @xmath6 and @xmath7 , measured at an @xmath2 or hadron machine , with the width @xmath8 measured at the plc .",
    "the detailed study of the @xmath9 vertex at the required precision is only possible at the plc .    in the intermediate higgs mass range @xmath10 , the dominant decay mode is into @xmath11 pairs .",
    "this final state is contaminated by a huge tree level gauge boson background and it is generally expected that it will be very difficult to use for higgs physics at a plc  @xcite .",
    "recently , this question has been reanalysed  @xcite with the conclusion that both the @xmath12 and @xmath11 modes can be used if a reasonable ( on the order of 10gev ) resolution for the @xmath11 invariant mass can be achieved experimentally . however , the calculations in  @xcite are based on on - shell matrix elements continued from above the @xmath11 pair production threshold .",
    "this method gives the correct signal to background  ( s / b ) ratio above the threshold , of course .",
    "however , as will be shown below , it overestimates the s / b ratio significantly below the threshold .",
    "indeed , it has already been pointed out  @xcite that the correct background rate below the @xmath11 threshold is dominated by the contribution of nonresonant diagrams . in the present paper",
    "we investigate the possibilities for searching for the higgs boson in that mass range from about 140gev to @xmath13 at a plc in more detail .    after a short discussion of higgs production at a plc in section  [ sec : higgs@plc ] , we present in this paper an analysis for the higgs signal process including all important corrections ( cf .",
    "section  [ sec : calc ] )    @xmath14    which includes the subsequent decay of the @xmath15 into quark or lepton pairs as well as all other sm contributions . in the remainder of the paper , we will often write @xmath16 for brevity . in section  [ sec : xsect ]",
    "we present numerical results for these cross sections and we investigate two extreme scenarios for the operation of a plc in section  [ sec : scenarios@plc ] .",
    "we conclude in section  [ sec : concl ] .",
    "the optimal strategy for the higgs search and the experimental determination of its properties at any collider depends strongly on the value of the higgs mass under consideration . at the plc we can distinguish three mass ranges for the search for the intermediate mass higgs that require different approaches .      in the mass range below 140gev , a higgs boson decays predominantly into  @xmath18 and the higgs signal at a plc can be extracted from the background using highly polarized photon beams ( cf .",
    "one of the latest studies  @xcite where the two loop qcd corrections have been taken into account ) . for collider energies up to about 300400gev ,",
    "the background from resolved photon processed remains small enough  @xcite .",
    "the potentially large four - fermion background like @xmath19 where the @xmath2 pair is lost in the beam pipe can be suppressed by a proper cut using the different kinematics of the signal  @xcite . in this case",
    "highly polarized photon beams are not sufficient for rejecting the background , because the initial photon polarization is shared among the polarizations of the four final state fermions and therefore no strong suppression of @xmath18 production occurs .      in the mass range above @xmath4 , the dominant higgs decay mode into @xmath21-pairs is obscured by the huge tree level background @xmath22",
    "it is possible to utilize the interference of the higgs signal with the @xmath11 background  @xcite , which manifests itself as a resonant dip in the @xmath11 invariant mass distribution for higgs studies .",
    "however , in this case a more detailed simulation of the four - fermion final state , including all tree level diagrams is mandatory .",
    "alternatively , one can use the @xmath23 mode with semileptonic four - fermion final states consisting of one neutral lepton pair and two jets  @xcite .",
    "but the one - loop @xmath24 background becomes important when the higgs mass exceeds about 350400gev  @xcite and makes a search for the higgs even more problematic in this region .      in the remaining region for the higgs mass from 140gev to @xmath4 , the determination of the higgs properties is a challenging experimental task . here , the decay mode of higgs to @xmath11 dominates as well , but it is plagued by a huge tree level background .",
    "nevertheless , it has been shown in  @xcite that a signal can be extracted for higgs masses above the @xmath21 pair production threshold .    in the remainder of this paper",
    ", we will discuss the @xmath12 final state for higgs masses below the @xmath11 threshold in more detail . despite the fact that the s / b ratio has been overestimated significantly in  @xcite , we will present strategies for measuring higgs properties in this region as well .",
    "the sm tree - level diagrams contributing to the background process @xmath16 for the quark pair final state @xmath28 are shown in figure  [ fig : udw ] and for the semileptonic final state @xmath29 in figure  [ fig : numuw ] .",
    "only hadronic decays of the @xmath21 will be selected to allow for invariant mass cuts .",

    "the effective @xmath38 vertex has been implemented in ` comphep ` .",
    "in addition , all important corrections have been included : nlo and nnlo qcd corrections to the running quark masses  @xcite as well as the three particle partial higgs decay width @xmath39 with @xmath40  @xcite .",
    "the accuracy of the implementation of the @xmath38 vertex has been verified by finding very good agreement with the results from the program ` hdecay `  @xcite .",
    "cross section for the process @xmath16.,width=453 ]    figure  [ fig : sigma_all ] shows the background cross section @xmath16 together with the leptonic and quark subsets for @xmath41-cuts of 10 and 20gev on both fermions as a function of the photon - photon energy @xmath42 .",
    "as expected , the cross sections vary strongly with the energy @xmath43 in the threshold region from 140gev to @xmath13 .",
    "therefore , a careful consideration of the background and signal rates is mandatory .",
    "depending on the advances in technology , it will be possible to operate a future plc in a variety of modes ( see  @xcite for a recent review ) . in order to cover a wide range of options ,",
    "we consider two extreme scenarios : scenario  i is a more conservative _ wide - band _ plc and scenario  ii is a technically more demanding _ narrow - band _ plc .",
    "* in the technically most conservative scenario  i , laser backscattering is used to turn a first stage @xmath2 next linear collider operating at the @xmath44 threshold 360gev into a plc with colliding @xmath45 beams .",
    "a rather broad photon energy spectrum with a maximum energy at @xmath46 of the incident electron energy is expected for the colliding photons , which will be unpolarized . * in the technically more challenging scenario  ii , the energy of the electron beam , the frequency of the laser , the respective polarizations and the geometry of the conversion and interaction region are tuned to produce highly polarized colliding @xmath45 beams with energy and luminosity comparable to the underlying @xmath2 machine  @xcite .",
    "the accelerator parameters can be chosen so that the differential @xmath45 luminosity has a peak at a particular energy ( e.g.  at @xmath47 ) with a width of approximately 15%  @xcite . +",
    "until realistic energy spectra for the photons can be made available by accelerator physicists , we use a simple step function of appropriate width for our simulations .",
    "we do not expect our conclusions to depend sensitively on the shape of the spectrum . in a real analysis , a spectrum determined experimentally from a reference process will be used .",
    "obviously , scenario  ii is best suited for studying higgs properties , provided that the higgs mass will be known at the start of the operation of a plc . in fact , if nature has chosen an intermediate mass higgs for electro - weak symmetry breaking , it is likely that its mass will have been determined by @xmath2- or hadron - machines at the time a plc can be commissioned .",
    "nevertheless , we will consider the wide - band scenario  i as well , in order to show what could be achieved with a technically more conservative design and in order to gauge the gain in physics results provided by scenario  ii .",
    ".[tab : wide - semilep ] cross sections for @xmath26 with different @xmath41-cuts , assuming a compton backscattering @xmath48-spectrum ( scenario  i ) . [ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]     turning our attention to the hadronic final state @xmath49 , we obtain the cross sections shown in table  [ tab : wide - hadr ] for three different higgs masses . if only the canonical cuts from the linear collider studies  @xcite are used , the s / b ratio is as prohibitively small as in the semileptonic case .",
    "these cuts correspond to the most inclusive coverage of a realistic detector : a minimum energy of 3gev for the jets , a minimum angle of 10degrees from either beam for each jet and a minimum jet / jet invariant mass of 10gev .",
    "differential cross section for @xmath27 .",
    "note that the differential distributions are identical for @xmath30 , only the normalization changes.,width=453 ]    the s / b ratio can be improved dramatically by applying additional @xmath41-cuts and , most significantly , by invariant mass cuts .",
    "figures  [ fig : diff - udw - compt150]a and  [ fig : diff - udw - compt150]b show the @xmath41-distributions of the jets and the @xmath21-boson produced both by a 150gev higgs signal and by the corresponding background ( see figure  [ fig : udw ] ) .",
    "these distributions suggest a transversal momentum cut of @xmath50 .",
    "in fact , this value can be understood from looking at the kinematics of a three - body decay of an on - shell higgs . there",
    "the transversal momentum of particle  1 is bounded by @xmath51 where  @xmath52 is the invariant mass of the other two particles . in the extreme case",
    "@xmath53 we find for example  @xmath54 which is @xmath55 for a 150gev higgs .    using a transverse momentum cut of @xmath56 on either jet and the @xmath21-boson",
    ", we find the invariant mass distributions for signal and background , shown in figure  [ fig : diff - udw - compt150]c .",
    "obviously , a cut on the invariant mass of @xmath57 brings the signal to the level of the background .",
    "this cut can be applied because , as mentioned in the introduction , we assume that the higgs mass will have been determined by the time a plc is commissioned . however , it should be noted from table  [ tab : wide - hadr ] that the s / b ratio of nearly one for a higgs mass at 140gev deteriorates when @xmath58 approaches the @xmath11 threshold .",
    "the fully hadronic final state suffers from additional combinatorial background , since the four jets can not be assigned unambiguously .",
    "therefore a more detailed analysis using a full four - fermion calculation will have to be performed in the future .",
    "however , since we assume one of the @xmath21 s to be on - shell , an invariant mass cut on one pair of jets will have rejected most of the combinatorics .",
    "scenario  ii assumes the technical feasibility  @xcite of producing a narrow photon spectrum around a previously measured higgs mass .",
    "for the numerical illustrations we have chosen again higgs masses of 140 , 150 and 160gev .",

    "this expectation is confirmed by the numerical results shown in table  [ tab : narrow ] .",
    "since the energy is fixed at the higgs mass by the experimental conditions , we can now use also the semileptonic channel , which we had to disregard in scenario  i , because the incomplete kinematical information did not allow invariant mass cuts .",
    "in addition , the photons will be highly polarized in scenario  ii such that states with @xmath61 are strongly enhanced  @xcite .",
    "higgs bosons are produced only from photon helicities of @xmath62 and @xmath63 that correspond to states with @xmath61 .",
    "for fully polarized photon beams , the higgs signal cross section is enriched by a factor of two ( see  @xcite ) whereas the background is suppressed with respect to the unpolarized case .",
    "close to the threshold , we can estimate this suppression factor simply  @xcite by comparing the @xmath21 pair production cross section just above the @xmath11 threshold in the polarized ( @xmath64 ) and unpolarized case .",

    "close to threshold , these cross sections are proportional to  @xmath67 .",
    "the coefficients , @xmath68 in the unpolarized case and @xmath69 in the polarized case , result in a suppression of @xmath21 pair production close to threshold through photon polarization by @xmath70 .",
    "the explicit calculation including all tree diagrams and cuts shows a suppression factor varying from 2.5 to 1.5 as the higgs mass moves down from the @xmath11 threshold ( cf .",
    "table  [ tab : narrow ] ) .",
    "the results of the complete calculation in table  [ tab : narrow ] show that the s / b ratio is smaller than estimated in  @xcite .",
    "if only the very inclusive canonical cuts are applied , the s / b ratio varies from 1.8 for a 140gev higgs mass to 0.5 for a 160gev higgs mass close to the @xmath11 threshold .",
    "this is smaller than the values estimated in  @xcite by factors of 4 and 1.7 , respectively .",
    "of course , if @xmath41-cuts on jets , leptons and the @xmath21-boson are applied , as well as the invariant mass cut in the case of the hadronic final state , the s / b ratio improves just like in scenario  i. however , we should stress that even for the most stringent cuts , the s / b ratio approaches only 5.6 for a 140gev higgs mass , which remains below the 8 estimated in  @xcite _ without any cuts_.    in any case , the s / b ratio with optimized cuts is sufficiently large and approaches unity for the hadronic final state , even for a higgs mass of 160gev close to the @xmath11 threshold .",
    "in addition to the improved s / b ratio , the signal cross sections are also 10 times larger in the narrow - band scenario  ii than in scenario  i. assuming a luminosity of 3050 @xmath71  @xcite , we can expect sufficient statistics at a plc operating in scenario  ii .",
    "we have investigated the options for extracting a signal for an intermediate mass higgs in the process @xmath72 at a future photon linear collider  ( plc ) . the more realistic signal to background  ( s / b )",
    "ratios are significantly smaller than those obtained earlier  @xcite for @xmath73 .",
    "the s / b ratio is of course most favourable for a narrow band plc with energies tuned to the higgs mass . for a wide band plc",
    "the hadronic final state provides enough kinematical information to raise the s / b ratio close to unity .",
