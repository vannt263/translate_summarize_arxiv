    "the problem of the relevance of disorder for phase transitions in lattice models of statistical mechanics has attracted attention for many years and the discovery of quasicrystals @xcite has served to increase interest in the physical properties of disordered systems .",
    "a fundamental problem in this field is whether quasiperiodic order is strong enough to change the critical behaviour of magnetic phase transitions . to investigate this problem we consider in this article a classical ising model defined on an underlying quasiperiodic lattice .",
    "there have been many works in this field since the late eighties . a heuristic criterion ( harris - luck criterion ) has been formulated @xcite which relates the critical behaviour to fluctuations of the number of spin couplings in a given region .",
    "the spatial scaling of fluctuations was described in terms of a `` wandering exponent '' @xmath4 which was required to exceed a threshold @xmath5 in order to produce a new universality class . for the majority of quasiperiodic structures existing in reality , such as the structural models of quasicrystalline phases discovered so far",
    "@xmath4 can be calculated exactly , due to the self - similarity or inflational symmetry of the structure , yielding a value smaller than the threshold and suggesting the irrelevance of disorder .",
    "however since numerous structures like the rhombic sevenfold or ninefold lattices @xcite exist , which are deprived of inflational symmetry and are therefore potential candidates for novel critical behaviour , there is still a strong motivation for dealing with quasiperiodic ising models .",
    "quasiperiodic ising models were investigated by monte - carlo simulations @xcite which at present , seem to yield the most precise estimates for the transition temperature and critical exponents . indeed , in @xcite computations for large periodic approximants ( pa ) of the penrose tiling ( pt )",
    "@xcite were carried out and obtained values for the correlation length @xmath6 and the two - spin correlation function @xmath7 exponents with two - digit precision ( @xmath8 , @xmath9 ) which agreed with the square lattice values ( @xmath10 , @xmath11 ) .",
    "moreover , the non - universal critical temperature @xmath12 has also been determined with an impressively small error @xmath13 .",
    "it is worth mentioning that a novel invaded - cluster algorithm , which modifies the temperature during the simulation towards the critical one , as opposed to standard monte - carlo algorithms with fixed temperature , was also applied to quasiperiodic systems @xcite to give an improved estimate of @xmath12 .",
    "the critical exponents are not available in this case , however .",
    "another approach is an approximate renormalisation group analysis @xcite which yields poor results , however . for the pt the specific heat exponent equals @xmath14 versus @xmath15 for the square lattice .",
    "quasiperiodic ising models were also examined by graphical expansion methods @xcite and by calculating exact partition functions for pa , obtained from the kac - ward determinant @xcite . in the first case",
    "estimates for @xmath12 and critical exponents have not been considerably improved but this approach demonstrated a new feature , a very slow convergence of the partition function @xmath16 series to its predicted asymptotic form .",
    "we also investigated the set of zeros of @xmath17 in the complex plane ( fisher zeros ) , which turned out to be much more complicated than in the square lattice case .",
    "the kac - ward determinant method appeared to yield highly accurate estimates of the critical temperature of quasiperiodic ising models ( for example @xmath18 for the pt ) .",
    "moreover , within this framework it was possible to construct a two dimensional ising model with relevant fluctuations , i.e. for which @xmath19 , which shows up another novel feature , namely the divergence of high temperature series @xcite . this example is interesting because it points out that in some cases the reliability of methods for extracting critical values from analysis of a series expansion , like the pad- or differential - approximants methods , @xcite can be questioned .",
    "an inspection of the fisher zeros furnished the explanation , since it appeared that the moduli of some complex zeros were smaller than the modulus of the physical singularity ( real zero ) and thus the complex zeros , rather than the real zero , were limiting the region of convergence the series .    in this paper",
    "it is not our purpose to improve on estimating @xmath12 or @xmath1 for quasiperiodic ising models since , due to the slow convergence of series expansions @xcite a large , inaccessible number of terms is needed to make progress in this field .",
    "instead , we aim at generalising the series expansion approach to the case of non - zero field quasiperiodic ising or potts models @xcite and provide alternative estimates of the magnetic exponents , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 .",
    "moreover , this approach allows us to investigate the problem of a disorder - driven `` softening '' of the first - order phase transition in @xmath20-state potts models for @xmath21 @xcite .",
    "the problem consists in calculating the partition function @xmath22 of an ising model on a lattice @xmath23 by series expansion .",
    "the partition function with field @xmath24 and coupling constant @xmath25 is defined in the usual way : @xmath26 where the sum over spin configurations @xmath27 consists of @xmath28 sums each of which runs over @xmath29 . starting from cluster integral theory ( page 4246 and page 73 in @xcite )",
    "one can formulate a free energy ( f ) expansion in terms of connected graphs for a wide range of models from statistical mechanics .",
    "in particular , for the non - zero field ising model or the @xmath20-state potts models ( the generalisation of the former one with @xmath20 values of spin at each site ) the expansion on a lattice @xmath23 reads @xmath30 where the sum on the right - hand side runs over connected graphs @xmath31 from @xmath23 . the quantity @xmath32",
    "denotes the embedding number of @xmath31 in @xmath23 , counting the number of ways @xmath31 can be embedded in @xmath23 . finally , the weight functions @xmath33 depend only on @xmath31 not on @xmath34 . making use of the independence of weights @xmath33 from the lattice we can write equation ( [ eq : high_temp_expans ] ) substituting each connected graph @xmath31 for @xmath23 , solve the system of equations for the weights and plug in the results to equation ( [ eq : high_temp_expans ] ) .",
    "we obtain @xmath35 where @xmath36 and @xmath37 is inverse to the matrix of embedding numbers , i.e. @xmath38 . the sum on the right - hand side in ( [ eq : high_temp_expans1 ] ) runs over @xmath39 from a subset of all connected graphs .",
    "it turns out @xcite that the graph @xmath39 can furnish a non - vanishing contribution , i.e. @xmath40 , if and only if it is an overlap of the embeddings of two other graphs having non - vanishing contributions .",
    "the construction of graphs therefore runs as follows ; we start from several `` fairly large '' graphs and construct all possible overlaps of their embeddings in the lattice in a recursive way .",
    "this limits the number of contributing graphs considerably , when compared to expansion ( [ eq : high_temp_expans ] ) , but , except for regular lattices like the square or honeycomb lattice , still leaves the problem of determining @xmath39 and the contributions @xmath41 open .",
    "indeed , for the square lattice where @xmath39 are rectangles , @xmath41 can be explicitly expressed via the ratio of the graph side lengths @xcite and the order to which the expansion is correct is in direct connection with the perimeter length of the largest graphs under consideration .",
    "for the quasiperiodic lattices which we wish to investigate the problem is not so simple . in what follows",
    "we focus on the pt @xcite and present the details of the expansion method for it in the next section .",
    "the pt is an aperiodic tiling of a plane by two kinds of rhombi of unit length side with angles @xmath42 and @xmath43 respectively .",
    "a discussion of the methods of generation and geometrical properties of this tiling can be found in @xcite , here we only mention a particularly useful feature , namely that embedding numbers of finite patches from this tiling can be calculated exactly and take the form @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the golden number and @xmath46 are rational numbers .",
    "the calculation of the series expansion consists therefore of the following steps :    1 .",
    "choose an initial set of `` fairly large '' graphs which are expected to be large enough that every connected subgraph of the underlying tiling with perimeter length not larger than a given threshold @xmath47 can be embedded in one of them .",
    "while on the square lattice this condition is satisfied by all possible rectangles with perimeter length @xmath47 on the pt the things are worse due to the lack of periodicity of the tiling . moreover , as opposed to the square lattice graphs in the pt can have different `` boundary line fillings '' , i.e. there are different graphs having the same boundary line @xcite . knowing that the pt contains eight different vertex types , i.e. different site environments related to the nearest neighbours , we cut out appropriately large patches around each vertex type , obtaining eight patches , and found all possible `` boundary line fillings '' .",
    "there is still a lot of ambiguity in this procedure since a patch in not uniquely determined by the vertex type of its central site",
    ". it would be more correct to take all possible higher order vertex types @xcite , i.e. @xmath48-order vertex types related to neighbours located not further than @xmath48 edges lengths from the site , but since their number grows quite rapidly with the order , the initial set of graphs would be too numerous and the generation of overlaps ( see next item ) too time consuming . 2 .",
    "generate all possible overlaps of embeddings of the initial graphs in the tiling . + it is difficult to estimate how the time of the generation depends on the number of initial graphs . let us say a couple of words about this , however . we group graphs into generations so that the initial set of graphs constitutes the zeroth generation and the nth generation consists of overlaps of graphs from the ( n-1)st and zeroth generations . since the time for creating the nth generation depends on the product of numbers of graphs from generation zero , @xmath49 and generation @xmath50 , @xmath51 ,",
    "starting from a too numerous zeroth generation should be avoided .",
    "the total number of overlaps grows rather slowly with @xmath49 for large @xmath49 and most of the computing time will be devoted to checking and rejecting graphs which occurred before . on the other hand if we took too few initial patches , the covering of the lattice with them would be incomplete , there would be plenty of `` holes '' not covered by any of the patches , and thus the series expansion would be error laden .",
    "the rule of thumb is to take @xmath52 not larger than twenty and choose the patches in such a way that their interiors differ as much as possible .",
    "+ again , on the square lattice it s immediately clear that the overlaps are rectangles , because every rectangle can be constructed as an overlap of two other rectangles , whereas on the pt the shapes of graphs and their quantity depends on the initial set . to make the things worse we are not even sure that we obtain star graphs ( page 116 in @xcite ) , i.e. graphs without articulation points , because the initial graphs are not necessarily convex .",
    "connected graphs consisting of multiple components will cause some difficulties by the calculation of partition functions by the transfer matrix method ( see following items ) .",
    "3 .   calculate the contribution @xmath41 of graph @xmath39 in ( [ eq : high_temp_expans1 ] ) in the following recursive way @xmath53 where the sum on the right - hand side runs over all graphs @xmath54 in which @xmath39 can be embedded .",
    "4 .   calculate logarithms of partition functions @xmath55 by the transfer - matrix method .    * the transfer - matrix method *    here we have to distinguish two cases , namely the case when the graph has no articulation points ( star graph ) and the contrary ( multicomponent graph ) .",
    "the latter is undoubtedly more complicated but fortunately it turns out that it takes place only in a minority of the graphs under consideration .",
    "let us firstly discuss the case of a star graph .",
    "we can define a perimeter of the graph , i.e. a line consisting of edges each of which belongs only to one rhombi .",
    "the sum over spin configurations can be performed by moving a boundary line across the graph . at each stage",
    "the boundary line goes through a number , say @xmath56 , sites . for the @xmath20-state potts model we have @xmath57 different spin configurations on the boundary line .",
    "now we define a @xmath57 dimensional vector @xmath58 consisting of partition functions calculated for the patch composed of sites from the boundary line , with a given spin configuration @xmath59 assigned to them , and sites already traversed by the boundary line .",
    "the initial values of @xmath58 are given by : @xmath60 and @xmath61    shifting the boundary line corresponds to generating a new vector @xmath62 of partition functions from the old vector @xmath17 .",
    "there is a lot of ambiguity in shifting the boundary line by a given number of tiles . in our case",
    "it amounts , however , to considering only three kinds of movements , by one tile , by two tiles and a shift between two given boundary line configurations , which we discuss in the following . placing the initial boundary line on the perimeter of the graph and moving it at each stage by certain number of tiles ,",
    "see fig.[fig : boundarylines ] , we have performed the sum over all configurations after reaching the final position of the boundary line ( also lying on the perimeter ) .",
    "now we discuss the details of updating the partition functions for the two kinds of boundary line movements , see fig.[fig : movements ] .",
    "for @xmath63 we have @xmath64 where @xmath65 and @xmath66 , @xmath67 .      for @xmath68 we have @xmath69 where @xmath70 and @xmath71 where @xmath72 and the new spin configuration is permuted with respect to the old one @xmath73 and @xmath74      in most cases it is possible to displace the boundary line from the initial to the final position by a sequence of the movements defined above .",
    "sometimes , however , we arrive in a dead end because none of the movements can be done , see fig.[fig : dead_end ] .",
    "in this case we have to shift the line directly to its final position by summing over all the spins which have not been taken into account yet .",
    "the formal prescription for updating @xmath58 in this case reads : @xmath75 where @xmath76 and @xmath77 and @xmath78 , @xmath79 , @xmath80 and @xmath81 denote the current and the final boundary lines , the edges and the sites which were not taken into account yet respectively .",
    "can the transfer - matrix formalism ( tmf ) also be applied to the case of a multicomponent graph ?",
    "the answer is affirmative because every connected graph can be dissected into its star graph components for which the tmf is applicable .",
    "since , however , star graph components share certain sites at their boundaries , which we call in the following isolated sites , we have to calculate a whole set of partition functions with given spin values at isolated sites and combine them to get the partition function of the whole graph . in the following we assume the simplest case namely , that every isolated site is shared by exactly two star components .",
    "this was indeed the case by our overlap graphs .",
    "let us explain the procedure for the case of a graph depicted in fig.[fig : multicomponental_graph ] .",
    "the partition function @xmath17 can be build up from partition functions @xmath82 ,",
    "@xmath83 , @xmath84 and @xmath85 corresponding to star components @xmath86 , @xmath24 , @xmath87 , and @xmath88 with isolated spins @xmath89 , @xmath90 and @xmath91 .",
    "@xmath92    now , the problem consists in calculating partition functions for a star graph with specified spins at isolated sites located at the boundary .",
    "assume that we have @xmath93 isolated sites @xmath94 , @xmath95 located at the initial boundary line and @xmath96 isolated sites @xmath97 , @xmath98 at the final boundary line respectively , see fig.[fig : multicomponental_graph ] .",
    "the calculation of @xmath99 amounts to repeating the tmf @xmath100 times and modifying the initial and the final partition function set by setting certain entries to zero .",
    "we replace the initial partition function set by @xmath101 z(\\sigma_1,\\ldots,\\sigma_n ) \\quad\\mbox{for given}\\quad s_{j_1},\\ldots , s_{j_p}\\ ] ] and the final partition function set is multiplied by @xmath102 $ ] again for a given spin configuration @xmath103 .",
    "another slight modification which is required consists in setting the factors @xmath104,@xmath105 and @xmath106 entering in the exponent @xmath107 in equations ( [ eq : onetilemovement],[eq : twotilemovement ] ) according to whether the site is isolated ( one ) or not ( two ) .",
    "we have performed calculations for a set of graphs constructed in the following way .",
    "we cut off seven fairly round shaped patches from the pt so that the central sites of the patches had different vertex types and their perimeter lengths were not larger than @xmath108 edge lengths .",
    "then we enlarged the set of patches by all possible `` boundary line fillings '' obtaining in effect twelve patches , see fig.[fig : initial_patches ] .",
    "in the next step we constructed all possible graphs contributing to the expansion in the recursive way described in section [ sec : calculation ] .",
    "their number turned out to be @xmath109 .",
    "this part of computations was rather tedious , up to two weeks for the second set on a sunos machine , because in generating graph overlaps many graphs turned up repeatedly and had to be rejected . in the next step we generated `` decorations '' of graphs , i.e. we determined vertex types of all sites of the graph including those on its boundary . since the graphs could have several decorations the number of graphs we have to deal with increased to @xmath110 .",
    "now we were ready to compute the coefficients @xmath41 entering in ( [ eq : high_temp_expans1 ] ) which appeared to be different from zero only for a small fraction of all graphs , namely for @xmath111 graphs .",
    "this is not a surprising result since on the square lattice the vast majority of rectangles used in the expansion yields zero coefficients as well @xcite .",
    "fortunately , most of the relevant graphs here were star graphs so we could easily compute the free energies @xmath55 entering in ( [ eq : high_temp_expans1 ] ) in the way described in section [ sec : calculation ] .",
    "there were however some awkward multicomponent graphs for which partition function computations were more tedious .",
    "the series expansion is shown beneath .",
    "after reordering the expansion ( [ eq : high_temp_expans1 ] ) , i.e. collecting together terms with the same power of @xmath112 , the free energy @xmath113 takes the form .",
    "@xmath114 quantities like the spontaneous magnetisation @xmath115 , susceptibility @xmath116 and field derivatives of the susceptibility @xmath117 can be expressed as linear combinations of the polynomials @xmath118 .",
    "@xmath119    .expansion coefficients of the magnetisation @xmath120 , susceptibility @xmath121 and its field derivatives @xmath122 , @xmath123 obtained from the finite lattice method .",
    "[ tab : magnetisation ] [ cols= \" > , > , > , > , > , > , > , > , > , > , > \" , ]",
    "the aim of this work was to analyse quasiperiodic ising models by means of graphical series expansions .",
    "we calculated low temperature expansions of the free energy , magnetisation and the susceptibility to order @xmath0 and extracted the respective critical exponents .",
    "we note that we did not obtain exact values for the exponents .",
    "they are marked by errors , which however do not exceed 10% in most cases .",
    "this feature is rather unusual for series expansions on regular lattices where the coefficients are exact to a given order which is determined by the size of patches used for calculations .",
    "this deserves further comment .",
    "there are the following two sources of errors in our method :    1 .",
    "there are always graphs which can not be embedded in any of the patches used in the calculations .",
    "the flm consists in covering and probing the lattice with a finite set of patches .",
    "since the lattice is irregular , in particular , not periodic there can always be `` holes '' , i.e. groups of sites , associated with graphs on the dual lattice , which are not covered by any of the patches . such incomplete covering with only one single patch is shown in figure [ fig : covering ] .",
    "consequently , even if the patches are large there can always be few small graphs which can not be embedded into them and which produce an error in even the lowest order coefficients .",
    "the next step in our research is to analyse the quasiperiodic @xmath20-state potts models , especially for @xmath124 because the harris - luck criterion implies that quasiperiodic order should be strong enough to alter the critical behaviour in these cases .",
    "the main problem here consists in calculating partition functions for finite patches .",
    "this can be done , for instance , by improving the flm @xcite where the expansion for a particular @xmath20 is obtained from partition functions with smaller @xmath20 values .",
    "another possibility is to use the fortuin - kasteleyn representation of the potts model @xcite , expressing partition functions as a function of @xmath20 .",
    "work in this direction is in progress .",
