    "in his seminal article on `` the nature of martensite '' bain @xcite proposed a mechanism that transforms the face - centred cubic ( fcc ) lattice to the body - centred cubic ( bcc ) lattice , a phase transformation most importantly manifested in low carbon steels .",
    "he writes :    bain , 1924 _ `` it is reasonable , also , that the atoms themselves will rearrange  by a method that will require least temporary motion .",
    "a mode of atomic shift requiring minimum motion was conceived by the author  '' _    the key observation that led to his famous correspondence was that _",
    "`` if one regards the centers of faces as corners of a new unit , a body - centered structure is already at hand ; however , it is tetragonal instead of cubic''_. he remarks that this is not surprising _ `` as it is the only easy method of constructing a bcc atomic structure from the fcc atomic structure''_.    even though now widely accepted , his mechanism , which he illustrated with a model made of cork balls and needles ( see fig .  [ bainorg ] ) , was not without criticism from his contemporaries .",
    "in their fundamental paper kurdjumov & sachs @xcite wrote [ free translation from german ] that `` nothing certain about the mechanism of the martensite transformation is known .",
    "bain imagines that a tetragonal unit cell within the fcc lattice transforms into a bcc unit cell through compression along one direction and expansion along the two other .",
    "however a proof of this hypothesis is still missing.''-eisens bergeht .",
    "eine besttigung fr diese anschauung konnte bisher nicht erbracht werden .",
    " _ ] interestingly , without being aware of it , the authors implicitly used the bain mechanism in their derivation of the kurdjumov & sachs orientation relationships ( see @xcite for details ) .    in subsequent years",
    ", the determination of the transformation mechanism remained of great interest . in their paper on  atomic displacements in the austenite - martensite transformation ",
    "@xcite jaswon and wheeler again acknowledged that    jaswon and wheeler , 1948 _ `` off all the possible distortions of a primitive unit cell of the face - centred cubic structure , which could generate a body - centred cubic structure of the given relative orientation , the one which actually occurs is the smallest '' _    by combining it with experimental observations of the orientation relationships they devised an algorithm to derive the strain tensor .",
    "however their approach is only applicable to cases where the orientation relationship is known a - priori .    with the years passing and a number of supporting experimental results ( for a discussion see e.g. @xcite ) the bain mechanism rose from a conjecture to a widely accepted fact . nevertheless , almost a century after bain first announced his correspondence a rigorous proof based on the assumption of minimal atom movement has been missing .",
    "of course , the transformation from fcc - to - bcc is not the only instance where the determination of the transformation strain is of interest .",
    "the overall question remains the same : which transformation strain(s ) , out of all the possible deformations mapping the lattice of the parent phase to the lattice of the product phase , require(s ) the least atomic movement ?    to provide a definite answer to this question one first needs to quantify the notion of least atomic movement in such a way that it does not require additional input from experiments .",
    "then one needs to establish a framework that singles out the optimal transformation among the infinite number of possible lattice transformation strains .",
    "one way to appropriately quantify least atomic movement is the criterion of smallest principal strains as suggested by lomer in @xcite . in his paper ,",
    "lomer compared @xmath0 different lattice correspondences for the @xmath1 to @xmath2 phase transition in uranium and concluded that only one of them involved strains of less than @xmath3 .",
    "more recently , in @xcite an algorithm is proposed to determine the transformation strain based on a similar minimality criterion ( see remark  [ remarkdistances ] ) that also allows for the consideration of different sublattices .",
    "the present paper considers a criterion of least atomic movement in terms of a family of different strain measures and , for each such strain measure , rigorously proves the existence of an optimal lattice transformation between _ any _ two bravais lattices . as a main application , it is shown that the bain strain is the optimal lattice transformation from fcc - to - bcc with respect to three of the most commonly used strain measures .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows : after stating some preliminaries in section  [ secpre ] we explore in more depth some mathematical aspects of lattices in section  [ secmet ] .",
    "this section is mainly intended for the mathematically inclined reader and may be skipped on first reading without inhibiting the understanding of section  [ secopt ] , which constitutes the main part of this paper . in this section",
    "we establish a geometric criterion of optimality and prove the existence of optimal lattice transformations for any displacive phase transition between two bravais lattices .",
    "additionally a precise algorithm to compute these optimal strains is provided . in the remaining subsections ,",
    "the general theory is applied to prove the optimality of the bain strain in an fcc - to - bcc transformation , to show that the bain strain remains optimal in an fcc to body - centred tetragonal ( bct ) transformation and finally to derive the optimal transformation strain between two triclinic phases of terephthalic acid .",
    "similarly to the fcc - to - bcc transition , this phase transformation is of particular interest as it involves large stretches and thus the lattice transformation requiring least atomic movement is not clear .",
    "throughout it is assumed that both the parent and product lattices are bravais lattices ( see definition  [ defbrav ] ) and that the transformation strain , i.e. the deformation that maps a unit cell of the parent lattice to a unit cell of the product lattice , is homogeneous .",
