    "the qcd sum rules were invented by shifman _",
    "@xcite to express the hadron parameters through the vacuum expectation values of qcd operators .",
    "being initially used for the mesons , the method was expanded by ioffe @xcite to the description of the baryons . the approach succeeded in describing the static characteristics as well as some of the dynamical characteristics of the hadrons in vacuum",
    " see , , the reviews @xcite .    the basic idea is to consider the correlation function @xmath3 describing the propagation of the system with the quantum numbers of the hadron , in the different regions of values of the momentum @xmath4 , where certain information on its behavior is available .",
    "the asymptotic freedom of qcd enables to present @xmath3 at @xmath5 as a power series in @xmath6 and the qcd coupling @xmath7 . on the other hand ,",
    "the imaginary part of @xmath3 at @xmath8 can be described in terms of the observable hadrons .",
    "this prompts to consider the dispersion relation for the function @xmath3 @xcite @xmath9 at @xmath5 .",
    "the coefficients of the expansion of the left - hand side ( lhs ) of the function @xmath3 in powers of @xmath6 are the expectation values of the local operators constructed of the quark and gluon fields , which are called `` condensates '' . such presentation , known as the operator product expansion ( ope ) @xcite provides the perturbative expansion of the short - distance effects , while the nonperturbative physics is contained in the condensates .",
    "the usual treatment of the right - hand side ( rhs ) of eq .",
    "( 1 ) consists in `` pole + continuum '' presentation , in which the lowest lying pole is singled out while the higher states are approximated by the continuum . thus , eq . ( 1 ) ties the values of qcd condensates with the characteristics of the lowest hadronic state .",
    "such interpretation requires that the contribution of the pole to the rhs of eq .",
    "( 1 ) exceeds the contribution of the continuum .    the ope of the lhs of eq .",
    "( 1 ) becomes increasingly valid , when the value of @xmath10 increases . on the other hand ,",
    "the `` pole + continuum '' model becomes more accurate when @xmath10 decreases .",
    "the important assumption is that the two presentations are close in a certain intermediate region of the values of @xmath4 . to improve the overlap of the qcd and the phenomenological descriptions , one usually applies certain mathematical tools ,  the borel transform .",
    "the borel transformed dispersion relations ( 1 ) are known as qcd sum rules @xcite .",
    "for example , the qcd sum rules for the nucleon provided a connection between the nucleon mass and the scalar quark condensate @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "similar relations have been obtained for the magnetic moments of the nucleons @xcite , etc .",
    "later the qcd sum rules were applied for the investigation of modified nucleon parameters in nuclear matter @xcite .",
    "they were based on the borel - transformed dispersion relation for the function @xmath12 describing the propagation of the system with the quantum numbers of the nucleon ( the proton ) in nuclear matter .",
    "considering nuclear matter as a system of @xmath13 nucleons with momenta @xmath14 , one introduces the vector @xmath15 which is thus @xmath16 in the rest frame of the matter .",
    "the function @xmath12 can be presented as @xmath17 with the arbitrary function @xmath18 being kept constant in the dispersion relations in @xmath4 .",
    "the spectrum of the function @xmath12 is much more complicated than that of the function @xmath3 .",
    "the choice of the function @xmath18 is dictated by attempts to separate the singularities connected with the nucleon in the matter from those connected with the properties of the matter itself . since the latter manifest themselves as singularities in the variable @xmath19",
    ", the separation can be done by putting @xmath20 and by fixing @xcite @xmath21 with @xmath22 being the relativistic value of the nucleon energy at the fermi surface .",
    "the general form of the function @xmath23 can thus be presented as @xmath24 the in - medium qcd sum rules are the borel - transformed dispersion relations for the components @xmath25 @xmath26 @xmath27 it was shown in @xcite that the `` pole + continuum '' model for the rhs of eq .",
    "( 5 ) can be used at least until we do not include the higher order terms of the density expansions of the functions @xmath25 .",
    "thus , one can expect that the characteristics of the nucleon in nuclear matter can be expressed through the in - medium values of qcd condensate .    in the lowest order of ope",
    "the problem was approached in @xcite .",
    "it was noticed that the condensates of the lowest dimensions @xmath28 can either be calculated or expressed through the observables .",
    "the vector condensate @xmath29 is proportional to the density of the matter @xmath30 , being @xmath31 here the upper index @xmath32 denotes the quark flavor . in the rest frame of the matter we get @xmath33 , @xmath34 with @xmath35 being just the number of the valence quarks in the nucleon .",
    "the scalar condensate is @xmath36 here the dots denote the terms which are nonlinear in @xmath30 . the expectation value @xmath37 is related to the @xmath38 sigma term @xmath39 , @xcite @xmath40 with @xmath41 standing for the current masses of the light quarks .",
    "turning to the condensates of dimension @xmath42 , we find for the gluon condensate @xcite @xmath43 with the nucleon expectation value @xmath44 obtained in @xcite in a model - independent way .",
    "also , the nonlocal condensate @xmath45 provides the contributions of @xmath42 and those of the higher dimension .",
    "the term of the dimension @xmath42 is @xmath46 with @xmath47 standing for the second moment of the nucleon structure function @xcite .",
    "the nonlocality of the scalar operator @xmath48 manifests itself in the higher terms of the operator expansion .",
    "the nonlocality of the product of the gluon operators is not expected to be important because of the minor contribution of the gluon expectation value to the nucleon parameters .",
    "the shift of the position of the nucleon pole , which in the linear approximation can be identified with the single - particle potential energy of the nucleon , was expressed as a linear combination of the condensates of the lowest dimension @xcite .",
    "the vector and scalar expectation values appeared to be the most important ingredients .",
    "their contributions cancelled to large extent , reproducing the familiar features of the walecka model @xcite .",
    "an alternative approach was developed in @xcite with the dispersion relations in the time component @xmath49 at three - dimensional momentum @xmath50 being fixed .",
    "it provided a similar result .",
    "the lack of knowledge about the in - medium expectation values of the higher dimension became the obstacle for the development of both approaches .",
    "one of such expectation values is the scalar four - quark condensate @xmath51 .",
    "it was noticed in @xcite that the configuration @xmath52 ( with @xmath30 standing for the baryon density ) is one of those , which composed the in - medium expectation value of the operator @xmath53 . in the gas approximation",
    "the expectation value of the colour - singlet operator is @xmath54 with the last term describing the `` internal '' action of the operators inside the nucleon . in the `` ground - state saturation approximation '' (",
    "also called `` factorization approximation '' ) formulated in @xcite the last term of the rhs of eq .",
    "( 12 ) vanishes .",
    "this would lead to the change @xmath55 of the value of the scalar four - quark condensate . assuming this approximation one",
    "would be forced to conclude that the four - quark scalar condensate plays the crucial role in qcd sum rules , causing doubts on the convergence of ope .",
    "the numerical results would contradict the known nuclear phenomenology @xcite .",
    "there have been some attempts to get rid of the contribution of the four - quark condensates , applying the differential operators @xcite or by choosing the form of the in - medium function @xmath12 which does not couple to the four - quark condensates @xcite . however , some of the information appeared to be lost in the former case , while there still remained some unknown condensates in the latter case .",
    "anyway , there was no consistent analysis of sum rules with the inclusion of the four - quark condensates until now",
    ". on the other hand , there are some indications that the second term of the rhs of eq .",
    "( 12 ) does not provide the true scale for the in - medium modification of the value of the scalar four - quark condensates .",
    "the calculations , carried out in @xcite predicted strong cancellation between the second and the third terms in the rhs of eq .",
    "also , the arguments based on chiral counting and supporting the violation of the in - medium factorization have been given in @xcite .",
    "in the present paper we build and solve the qcd sum rules in nuclear matter in the gas approximation with the account of the condensates up to the dimension @xmath56 .",
    "this means that we include the terms of the order @xmath0 of the ope ( recall that the leading ope terms are of the order @xmath57 ) .",
    "this requires the inclusion of the four - quark condensates @xmath58 , @xmath59 and @xmath60 with @xmath61 standing for the basic @xmath62 matrices , corresponding to the scalar , pseudoscalar , vector , pseudovector ( axial ) and tensor structures .    in the gas approximation",
    "the in - medium expectation value of any operator @xmath63 is @xmath64 with @xmath65 standing for the state vector of the free unpolarized nucleon .",
    "since we include only terms linear in @xmath30 , we can neglect the fermi motion of the nucleons of the matter .",
    "thus we put @xmath66 in eq .",
    "having in mind the future extension of the approach , we shall keep the dependence on @xmath67 , using eq .",
    "( 14 ) for the specific computations .",
    "we consider symmetric nuclear matter with an equal density of the protons and neutrons @xmath68 .",
    "the nucleon expectation values of the lowest dimensions can either be calculated in a model - independent way or expressed through the observables .",
    "the calculations of the four - quark condensates require model assumptions on the structure of the nucleon .",
    "the complete set of the four - quark condensates was obtained in @xcite by using features of the perturbative chiral quark model ( pcqm ) .",
    "the chiral quark model , originally suggested in @xcite , was developed further in @xcite . in the pcqm",
    "the nucleon is treated as a system of relativistic valence quarks moving in an effective static field .",
    "the valence quarks are supplemented by a perturbative cloud of pseudoscalar mesons , in agreement with the requirements of the chiral symmetry . in @xcite",
    "a simple version close to the su(2 ) flavor pcqm , which includes only the pions , has been used .",
    "there are three types of contributions to the four - quark condensate in the framework of this approach .",
    "all four operators can act on the valence quarks .",
    "also , four operators can act on the pion .",
    "there is also a possibility that two of the operators act on the valence quarks while the other two act on the pions .",
    "following @xcite we speak of the `` interference terms '' in the latter case .    to obtain the contribution of the pion cloud , we need the expectation values of the four - quark operators in pions .",
    "the latter have been deduced in @xcite by using the current algebra technique .",
    "we obtain a remarkable cancellation of the pion contributions in the function @xmath12 .",
    "this cancellation takes place in any model of the nucleon which treats the pion cloud perturbatively .",
    "thus , the contributions of the four - quark condensates come from the terms , determined by the valence quarks only and from the interference terms .",
    "we find the contribution of the four - quark condensate to the in - medium modification @xmath69 of the function @xmath70 to be much smaller , then one could expect by assuming the `` in - medium factorization approximation '' .",
    "these terms are about 4 - 5 times smaller than the leading ones of the ope series .",
    "this is consistent with the hypothesis of the convergence of ope .",
    "thus , we obtain three sum rules equations for the functions @xmath71 , @xmath72 and @xmath73 introduced in eq.(4 )",
    ". the in - medium characteristics of the nucleon ,  the vector self - energy @xmath1 and the effective mass @xmath2 are the unknowns of these equations .",
    "there are two unknown parameters more ,  the residue at the nucleon pole @xmath74 and the continuum threshold @xmath75 .",
    "all these characteristics will be obtained from the qcd sum rules .    the dependence of the rhs of eq .",
    "( 5 ) on the parameters , which are expected to be determined , is not linear ( except the dependence on @xmath74 ) .",
    "thus , even in the gas approximation the behavior of these parameters with @xmath30 is linear only at sufficiently small values of the density .",
    "we consider two approaches to the problem . in the linearized case",
    "we determine only the linear parts of the in - medium modifications of the hadron ( nucleon ) and continuum parameters .",
    "we construct the combination of the sum rules for the function @xmath69 in such a way , that two of the equations determine the values of @xmath1 and @xmath76 separately .",
    "note that it is possible to write the equation in which the parameter @xmath76 is the only unknown , only because the proton has a definite space parity .",
    "the third equation enables to find the in - medium changes of the parameters @xmath77 and @xmath78 .",
    "we express the nucleon characteristics @xmath1 and @xmath76 in terms of the vector , scalar , gluon and four - quark condensates and of the moments of the structure functions .    in the nonlinearized version",
    "we do not assume the in - medium changes of the parameters to be small .",
    "the three equations for the borel transformed function @xmath79 enable to obtain the values of @xmath1 , @xmath74 and @xmath75 . at densities @xmath30 of the order of the saturation value",
    "@xmath80 the values of @xmath1 and @xmath76 appear to coincide within 25@xmath81 and @xmath82 accuracy with the values provided by the linear version .",
    "this causes somewhat larger difference in the values of the potential energy @xmath83 which still has reasonable values .",
    "inclusion of the four - quark condensates and of the higher moments of the structure functions diminish the ope value of the nucleon vector self - energy @xmath1 by about @xmath84 each . as to the scalar self - energy @xmath76",
    ", the four - quark condensates provide contribution of the same order as the leading ope term .",
    "however , this contribution is almost totally compensated by the account of the higher moments of the structure functions .",
    "thus , the value of the @xmath76 is very close to that given by the leading order of ope .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we present the sum rules in a form , which is convenient for our analysis . in sec .",
