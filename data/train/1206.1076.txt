    "the totem experiment has measured the total  cross section at @xmath2  @xcite and the value may be consistent @xcite with saturation of the froissart - martin bound @xcite , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath3 .",
    "it is also consistent with a range of total cross section predictions , based on a mini - jet qcd model with infrared gluons  @xcite , as well other deductions based on a hard pomeron component  @xcite .",
    "the saturation of the froissart bound , if confirmed , could exclude , at least at present energies  @xcite , a different behaviour obtained from hidden extra dimensions  @xcite . indeed , according to ref .",
    "@xcite , the totem result indicates that we have now reached asymptotia as far as the total cross section is considered and thus existence of hidden extra dimensions can be excluded . on the other hand ,",
    "contradictions in the analysis of ultra high energy cosmic rays composition  @xcite might hint to the existence of new physics that modifies baryonic interactions at center - of - mass ( cm ) energies in the @xmath4 range .",
    "thus the problem of the energy dependence of the total cross section is not yet beyond all dispute .",
    "another interesting feature has arisen in connection with totem published results for the differential and the total elastic cross section  @xcite .",
    "these data show that the dip , which had characterized data at isr in @xmath1 scattering , and which has been only a faint presence in @xmath5 at the tevatron , has reappeared .",
    "we propose to use these data to check whether asymptotia has been reached , through two asymptotic sum rules ( asr ) for the elastic amplitude in impact parameter space  @xcite . to check the satisfaction of these asr , we shall use the    model independent parametrization of the scattering amplitude  @xcite proposed in 1973 by barger and phillips .",
    "we shall see that this model , with two exponentials and a phase , describes well both the diffraction peak , as well as the @xmath6-dependence after the dip at lhc with cm energy of 7  ( lhc7 ) .",
    "we also analyze isr data for @xmath1 scattering at @xmath7 , and , by comparison , find that the asr are not satisfied at isr , while being almost exactly satisfied at lhc7 .",
    "we discuss the approach to asymptotia of the ratio  and of the forward slope and suggest to use this simple model to fit future forward scattering lhc data .",
    "let the elastic amplitude @xmath8 be normalized so that _ total(s ) = 4 f(s,0 ) .",
    "[ 2 ] at high energy , all particle masses can be ignored and the elastic differential cross section reads [ 2 ] =    j_0(b ) , inversion of eq .",
    "( [ 3 ] ) reads [ 4 ] = -i _ -^0 ( dt ) j_0(b ) f(s , t ) , one can study properties of the amplitude in impact parameter space from the known behaviour in the angular momentum discrete variable .",
    "the froissart bound implies that there must exist a finite angular momentum value , _ below _ which all partial waves are absorbed . under the stronger hypothesis of total absorption as @xmath9 in the ultra high energy limit , namely",
    "all `` low-@xmath10 '' waves are completely absorbed , we have the two asr [ 5 ] sr_1= _ -^0 ( dt ) f(s , t ) & & 1 ;  s  , + sr_0=_-^0 ( dt ) f(s , t ) & & 0 ;  s  .",
    "satisfaction of these rules is a good measure of whether the asymptotic limit has been reached , and would reinforce the statement  @xcite based on the totem data for total cross section , that we may have reached asymptotia , namely that @xmath11 , and saturation of the froissart bound has been observed .",
    "notice that the froissart - martin bound is obtained under a hypothesis weaker than total absorption @xcite and it would lead to @xmath12 ; @xmath13 .",
    "as we shall see , phenomenologically eq.([5 ] ) , is favoured .",
    "in order to check these asr , one requires a model for the scattering amplitude .",
    "while the imaginary part of the elastic amplitude is solidly anchored to the optical theorem , the real part is more model dependent .",
    "a limiting behaviour for the real part of the forward amplitude has been obtained by khuri and kinoshita  @xcite , _ i.e. _ , for @xmath14 ( s,0 ) = , if the froissart bound is saturated . as discussed later , the model of ref .",
    "@xcite gives @xmath15 $ ] with @xmath16 for a total cross section asymptotically growing as @xmath17 , and @xmath18 , when the froissart bound is saturated .    for values of @xmath19",
    ", there is a result by andr martin  @xcite , which relates the real part of the amplitude to its imaginary part . given an @xmath20 , martin s method gives an asymptotic expression for @xmath21 , i.e. f(s , t)=(s,0 ) .",
    "we note here that the above equation is valid also if the froissart bound is not saturated , but @xmath22 , where @xmath23 .",
    "the elastic amplitude still scales with the variable @xmath24 , the only difference is @xmath25 $ ] , with @xmath26 .    to complete the expression for the real part",
    ", one needs to estimate @xmath27 for all cases including the case when the froissart bound is not saturated .",
    "the phase of the leading ( first term ) contribution at @xmath28 is readily obtained from the @xmath29-dependence of the total cross section , or equivalently @xmath30 , using the prescription @xmath31 , which assures analyticity and crossing symmetry of the scattering amplitude  @xcite . at high energies _ and very small @xmath6 values _",
    ", @xmath32 crossing symmetry tells us that the leading @xmath33 amplitude is a function of the complex variable @xmath34 .",
    "the froissart bound requires @xmath35 , and we can generally write , asymptotically [ r1 ] f ( s,0 )  i^1/p= i^1/p , [ eq : phase block ] with @xmath36 to include both the case of saturation of the froissart bound and a slower rise , compatible with @xmath37 behaviour . for large @xmath29 , this may be approximated to [ r2 ] f ( s,0 )  i^1/p .",
    "[ eq : phase ] the above equation gives an estimate for the leading contribution to the parameter @xmath27 , namely ( s,0 ) = , [ eq : rho ] where the approximate sign refers to the fact that the real part of the amplitude can receive also ( non - leading ) contributions from other terms .",
    "the khuri - kinoshita result , valid when the froissart bound is saturated , is obtained for @xmath38 . to obtain a numerical value for @xmath39",
    ", we use a model  @xcite built on qcd mini - jets embedded into the eikonal representation . according to this model ,",
    "qcd mini - jets drive the rise of the cross section , and @xmath40-resummation of ultra - soft gluons transforms the power - law rise of the mini - jet cross sections into an asymptotic logarithmic behaviour . in our model  @xcite _ total~^1/p(s ) , where the parameter @xmath41 can be related to a dressed one - gluon exchange potential rising as @xmath42 , and our phenomenology of total cross section data  @xcite leads to values @xmath43 .",
    "it should be noted that the asymptotic expression for the real part of the scattering amplitude automatically satisfies the second asr .",
    "however , this does not help in checking whether asymptotia has been reached , since the expression for the real part is based on an asymptotic scaling law , which may not be valid .",
    "another measure for asymptotia , also examined in ref .",
    "@xcite , can be obtained from the ratio of the elastic to the total cross section .",
    "based on the black and grey disk model , where @xmath44 and @xmath45 , the black disk limit , @xmath46 , gives , for the ratio , the limiting value 1/2 .",
    "however , we have recently shown  @xcite that the eikonal formulation at high energy underestimates the total inelastic cross section , including in it only uncorrelated ( non - diffractive ) collisions , whereas the diffractive collisions appear to be part of the eikonal elastic cross section .",
    "in fact , it is known that , at high energies , the  elastic \" cross section , as defined in eikonal models , is typically overestimated  @xcite .",
    "thus we propose the following asymptotic limit = = r_el+r_diff1/2 ,  s , [ eq : ratio ] where @xmath47 includes both single and double diffractive components .",
    "we show in fig .",
    "[ fig : sigeltosigtotnew ] a compilation of data  @xcite for the ratio @xmath48 and compare it with the black disk limit and results of ref .",
    "@xcite .    in the figure",
    "we have added to the accelerator data a value extracted from the recent measurement by the auger collaboration for the inelastic cross section  @xcite .",
    "we estimated the ratio @xmath49 at 57 , by using block and halzen ( bh )  @xcite value for the total cross section at @xmath50 mb , which is based on the analytic amplitude method of ref .",
    "we then obtained @xmath51 .",
    "we also show the asymptotic result ( green dot ) from ref .",
    "@xcite , which appears in line with the ratio   extrapolated from the auger point for the inelastic cross section .",
    "the conclusion in ref .",
    "@xcite that we are still not in asymptotia for what concerns this ratio , may however be too pessimistic .",
    "firstly , from the figure , it is quite conceivable that data may approach a limiting value of 1/3 .",
    "this would be better in keeping with eq .",
    "( [ eq : ratio ] ) . also , estimates for the inelastic cross section are affected by large uncertainties , and often model dependent on extrapolations .",
    "indeed , in order to reconcile cosmic ray composition data , an extrapolation from @xmath39-air to   could use higher total cross section values  @xcite .",
    "given the uncertainties in different simulations at ultra high energies , the estimate for @xmath49 at 57  could then be lowered ( closer to the totem value ) , thereby opening the possibility that an asymptotic plateau for   may have already been reached . in fact @xmath49 has been rising from lower energies until the value @xmath52 at the tevatron , and at lhc7 .",
    "data at 8  could indicate whether we have reached a plateau or not .",
    "in order to perform a test of the asr in a model independent way , we have analyzed the data for the differential elastic cross section through a parametrization of the scattering amplitude , proposed by barger and phillips ( bp ) in 1973  @xcite . in 1973 , bp proposed two different parametrizations , consisting in using a phase and two exponentials to describe the elastic scattering amplitude as a function of momentum transfer in the range @xmath53 .",
    "the first parametrization was given as ( s , t)= i , [ eq : bpeq1-ampl ] + = a(s)e^b(s)t+c(s)e^d(s)t+2 e^(b(s)+d(s))t/2 , [ eq : bpeq1 - 1 ] with five @xmath29-dependent real parameters , @xmath54 . the total cross section in this model is given as _",
    "total=4 m a(s , t=0)=4 .",

    "the values of the parameters at @xmath7 are given as @xmath58 in @xmath59 and @xmath60 in @xmath61 , @xmath62 .",
    "the first exponential was seen to have normal regge shrinking , namely [ b ] b = b_0 + 2 s ,  0.3 , [ eq : bpxb ] while the second exponential term appeared to be constant in this energy range . with this parametrization",
    ", the phase @xmath63 was fitted to be always larger than @xmath64 , so that the interference term was always negative .",
    "the second parametrization interpreted the energy dependence of the parameters in terms of regge - pomeron exchange and fits to data were as good as in the first case , but more model dependent .",
    "however , eq .  ( [ eq : bpxb ] ) for the forward slope @xmath65 poses now a problem , as recently discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , since totem data can be described by eq .",
    "( [ eq : bpxb ] ) only if @xmath66 is not a constant , but has a logarithmic energy dependence . on the other hand , by relinquishing any model interpretation , one can use the model of eq .",

    "reading the totem data from ref .",
    "@xcite , we show the result in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : dsigellhcfits ] .",
    "we find that two exponentials and a phase can give a very good description of totem data , with the tail well described by a term @xmath67 , with @xmath68 and a relative weight of the two terms at lhc7 @xmath69 . with this parametrization ,",
    "the position of the dip ( which the model fit gives at @xmath70 ) and the behaviour around the dip are both well reproduced .",
    "this result differs from the proposal in ref .",
    "@xcite and also from the suggestion by totem  @xcite that the tail , past the dip at @xmath71 , is described as being compatible with a behaviour of the type @xmath72 with @xmath73 .",
    "the totem suggested behaviour is close to a description of the tail through a qcd type contribution from three gluon exchange advanced in ref .",
    "it is also close to the observation in ref .",
    "@xcite , that the `` second exponential '' can be identified with a term proportional to @xmath74 , valid , according to the authors , for all available @xmath1 data for @xmath75 . following these suggestions , and mindful of the fact that the form factor dependence of the amplitude would contribute to the cross section with a term as @xmath76 ,",
    "we have tried a slight modification of the bp model , which consists in substituting the second term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : bpeq1-ampl ] ) with a term proportional to the 2@xmath77 power of the proton form factor , namely to write ( s , t)=i .",
    "[ eq : ffmodel ]     with @xmath78 a free parameter , this allows a comparison with the parametrization of the tail in ref .",

    "one observes a good satisfaction of both asr .",
    "notice however , that , in general , the conjecture for @xmath27 proposed in eq .",
    "( [ eq : rho ] ) can not be valid at lower energies , because the approximation for the amplitude in eq .",

    "2 , can not be applied here , because at isr we are far from an asymptotic regime . before leaving this discussion , we point out that the value obtained for the total cross section in this model is below the experimental value .",
    "this is particularly true for isr energies , where the fit gives @xmath89 to be compared with values with very small errors , such as @xmath90  @xcite . at lhc7 the total cross section",

    "[ fig : dsigellhcfits ] and [ fig : isr5param ] , we conclude that this model is approximately valid at lower energies , better apt to describe data at lhc7 and onwards .",
    "totem released values for @xmath92 , @xmath93 , the slope @xmath94 and the position of the dip .",
    "the total cross section is reproduced by the five - parameter fit ( @xmath95 is let unconstrained ) of the two exponential model within 10% , and we have a good determination of the position of the dip , which , in our fit , occurs at @xmath96 .    as for the slope parameter , one can not immediately compare the value of this model parameter @xmath65 with totem data , where it is defined as = .|_t=0",

    "such difference is well understood in the two exponential model . with the definition for the effective slope @xcite b_eff(s , t ) ( ) , [ eq : beff ]",

    "one finds b_eff(7  , 0)=.()|_t=0=17.7  ^-2 ,  .",
    "notice that the figure is obtained by neglecting the contribution from @xmath103 .",
    "clearly this approximation is not valid where the real or the imaginary part of the amplitude approaches zero .",
    "it is possible to identify the two @xmath6-values where this will happen before the dip , namely where the real part of the amplitude is zero , and a subsequent one , close or very close to the dip , where the imaginary part is zero . at lhc7",
    ", these two points occur at -t_r&=&()= 0.280.30  ^2 , + -t_i&= & ( ) = 0.5  ^2,[eq : tim ] where the uncertainty in @xmath104 depends on the value for @xmath105 and we have neglected @xmath106 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : tim ] ) and , again , we have used the parameter values indicated in the left hand panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : dsigellhcfits ] . an asymptotic value for the slope @xmath107 , can be obtained through the asr , already well satisfied at lhc7 .",
    "thus , in the exact limits @xmath108 , @xmath109 , for asymptotic energies at lhc and beyond , one obtains for the effective slopes b_eff(s , t_r)&= & , + b_eff(s , t_i)&=&b+d- .",
    "we find , in agreement with totem , that past @xmath104 , where the real part of the amplitude is zero , the slope is @xmath110 , and that it increases to higher values , to then start decreasing    as it approaches @xmath111 where the imaginary part goes to zero    in correspondence with the occurrence of the dip .",
    "we note that the asr imply that the slope @xmath112 from the two exponential model should grow as @xmath92 , thus as @xmath113 , if the froissart bound is saturated , or as @xmath114 for a slower rise .",
    "we see that the same behaviour is also true asymptotically for the ( constant in @xmath6 ) leading parameter @xmath65 of the two exponential model , for which we also have the well known result _",
    "el(s ) = recently also discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite on general grounds .",
    "we conclude that , if the two exponential model is a good representation of the amplitude at lhc in the range @xmath115 , and if the total cross section rises faster than @xmath37 , the slope of the leading term in this model should grow faster than @xmath116 .",
    "notice that in ref .",
    "@xcite , an analysis of the effective slope from na8 to totem seems to indicate a rise according to @xmath113 .",
    "thus , just as in the case of the total cross section , the question of the energy dependence of the effective slope is still very much open . in conclusion , we stress the following points concerning the slope parameter :    1 .",
    "one can not speak about a unique slope if there is more than one term with different @xmath6 dependence in the elastic amplitude , as required by the presence of a dip , in the differential cross section .",
    "2 .   even in the region before the dip , the necessity of _ at least _ two terms , whose interference gives rise to the dip , is felt and totem itself provides two different values for the slope in two different regions of @xmath6 .",
    "hence it is not meaningful to consider only a single slope and its asymptotic behavior . in a two component model such as",
    "the one considered above , all one can discuss is the relative growth of the two slopes with energy .",
    "3 .   even in the rather simple model analyzed here , we find that the slope near @xmath28 is less than that around @xmath117 , which is less than that around @xmath118 and hence the question of the growth with energy becomes a strong function of the @xmath6 range under consideration .",
    "the curve in the right hand panel of fig .  [ fig : isr5param ] shows that at lhc this model predicts an increase of the slope parameter in the range @xmath119 .",
    "this is in contrast with the behaviour observed at lower energies , notably at isr for very small @xmath120values @xcite .",
    "notice however that our findings at lhc are in agreement with those expected in ref .",
    "@xcite at asymptotic energies .",
    "we have utilized two asymptotic sum rules derived earlier for the elastic scattering amplitude in @xmath1 scattering @xcite and have tested them using a well known parametrization of the elastic differential cross section with two exponentials with a relative phase .",
    "our study of totem data at lhc7 finds that this model can describe well the data before and past the observed dip .",
    "similar conclusions about the behaviour past the dip , have also been advanced in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "a possible interpretation of this model is that the exponential behaviour exhibited both before and after the dip corresponds to a resummation of soft terms accompanying the leading @xmath121 , two gluon exchange , and @xmath122 , three gluon exchange term , with non leading terms giving rise to @xmath123 .",
    "given the general nature of the parametrization discussed here , we recommend its usage for further studies of the behaviour of the scattering amplitude at higher energies .",
