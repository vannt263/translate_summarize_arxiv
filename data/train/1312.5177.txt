    "in a recent paper , @xcite some of us demonstrated a scalable flying qubit architecture in a four - terminal setup .",
    "electrons were transported via an aharonov - bohm ( ab ) ring into two channel wires that have a tunable tunnel coupling between them .",
    "the superposition of the two electron states between the two outgoing channels can be considered as a flying qubit , which can be manipulated by the various gate voltages on the system .",
    "that paper also exhibited an interesting variation of the relative phases of the ab oscillations in the currents in the two outgoing channels , as function of the coupling between them . in the present paper",
    "we present similar experimental results for a new ( simpler ) three - terminal setup , and then present a simple theoretical model which reproduces them .",
    "the early experiments on two - terminal ` closed ' ab interferometers @xcite exhibited a phase rigidity : the minima and maxima of the ab oscillations in the outgoing current stayed at the same values of the magnetic flux through the interferometer ring , irrespective of the details of a quantum dot which was placed on one arm of the interferometer . at most ,",
    "the phase of the oscillation jumped by @xmath0 , interchanging the minima and maxima .",
    "this rigidity was due to the onsager relation , by which unitarity and time reversal symmetry imply that the conductance through the interferometer must be an even function of the magnetic field",
    ". @xcite one way to overcome this rigidity , and to measure the phase of the transmission amplitude through the quantum dot , was to open the interferometer , allowing leaks of electrons out of the interferometer ring and thus breaking the unitarity condition needed for the onsager relation .",
    "@xcite indeed , experiments with open interferometers @xcite yielded a continuous shift in the oscillation phases . in a ` two - slit ' geometry ( as in young s classical diffraction experiment ) ,",
    "the electronic wave passes only once through each branch of the interferometer , and then this phase shift should be equal to the desired transmission phase .",
    "however , this ` two - slit ' limit is achieved only when the electronic leaks are very large , and therefore the remaining visibility ( i.e. the amplitude of the ab oscillations ) is very small .",
    "@xcite    in the present paper we discuss an alternative way to cross between the ` two - slit ' and the ` two - terminal ' limits , i.e. between the case in which the oscillation phase reflects the scattering phase through one branch of the interferometer and the case of full phase rigidity .",
    "this is achieved by having two outgoing wires , namely by our novel three - terminal setup , consisting of an ab ring and a coupled - wire .",
    "@xcite a priori , the current in each outgoing wire need not obey the onsager phase rigidity , because electrons  leak \" through the other outgoing wire .",
    "however , we show that the strength of the tunnel - coupling between the outgoing wires can cause the crossover between the above two limits .",
    "section [ exp ] describes our experimental setup , as shown in fig .",
    "this is similar to that of ref .",
    "@xcite , but now we use only three ( and not four ) terminals , one for the incoming current ( on the left ) and two for the outgoing coupled channels ( on the right ) .",
    "section [ exp ] also presents results for the two outgoing currents , see fig .",
    "2 . these results are also similar to those found in ref .",
    "for strong inter - wire tunnel - coupling , the ab oscillations in both wires have the same phases , and they exhibit phase rigidity as in the ` two - terminal ' case . for weak tunnel coupling ,",
    "the two oscillations have opposite phases ( which we call ` anti - phase ' ) . in this limit",
    "the phases of the oscillations vary smoothly with the gate voltage on the upper branch of the interferometer , implying a relation between the measured phase and the phase of the electronic wave function on that branch .    .",
    "we apply the source - drain bias @xmath1 on the left ohmic contact and measure the output currents of the two right ohmic contacts . ]    in the rest of this paper we develop a simple and minimal theoretical tight - binding model , which imitates the experimental setup .",
    "since the following sections are somewhat technical , we first give a qualitative description of our model and of our results . in sec .",
    "[ models ] we formulate the tight binding equations which describe the scattering of electrons from two quantum network models , which are constructed from one - dimensional wires . in these models , which are shown in fig .",
    "[ sab ] , the ab loop is modeled by a triangle ( abc ) of one - dimensional wires , and the tunnel - coupling between the outgoing wires is modeled by many transverse wires , each having a tunneling energy @xmath2 .",

    "[ wires ] and [ intwires ] .",
    "the amplitudes and the relative phases of the ab oscillations in the reflected and transmitted currents depend on @xmath2 . at small @xmath2 ,",
    "the oscillations in the reflected current are very small , and therefore the oscillations in the two outgoing currents must cancel each other , hence the  anti - phase \" behavior .",
    "this phenomenon appears for both models in fig .",
    "[ sab ] , independent of the length of the coupling between the outgoing wires .",
    "in contrast , the  in - phase \" behavior appears only for a long region of tunnel - coupling between the wires , fig .",
    "[ sab](b ) . for a very large @xmath2 ,",
    "all the wave functions on these wires become evanescent , due to a strong reflection from each of the transverse coupling wires , and therefore both outgoing currents become very small .",
    "however , for intermediate values of @xmath2 , in a range which depends on some anisotropy between the two wires , one finds only one  running \" wave solution on the coupled wires . for this single solution ,",
    "the ratio of the wave amplitudes , and therefore also the ratio of the two outgoing currents , are practically independent of the magnetic flux .",
    "therefore , both currents have the same flux dependence ( up to a constant multiplicative factor ) .",
    "this explains the  in - phase \" behavior .",
    "section [ conc ] presents our conclusions .",
    "we employed an ab ring connected to a tunnel - coupled wire shown in fig .",
    "1 . this three - terminal geometry is the simplest for realizing the two - slit experiment even compared with the four - terminal geometry employed in the previous work .",
    "@xciteour device is fabricated from a modulation doped algaas / gaas heterostructure ( depth of 2deg : 125 nm , carrier density : @xmath3 , mobility : @xmath4vs ) using a standard schottky gate technique . by varying the tunneling gate voltage @xmath5",
    "we can modulate in - situ the tunnel coupling energy @xmath2 . by applying a voltage to the gate @xmath6 the phase acquired in one of the two paths can be varied . to observe the quantum interference ,",

    "this is because the gate electrode deposited to define the tunnel coupling is narrow . in such a strong coupling case ,",
    "the two output currents @xmath8 and @xmath9 oscillate in - phase as shown in fig .",
    "namely , the two output contacts work equally and the interferometer effectively works as a standard ab ring in a two - terminal setup . the total current oscillates with a period of @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the area enclosed by the ab ring .",
    "this standard ab interference is subjected to phase rigidity , as would result from the onsager law .",
    "below we explain why this law applies in this limit .",
    "the phase of the ab oscillation can thus only take the values 0 or @xmath0 at zero magnetic field and as a consequence leads to phase jumps when the ab phase is modulated by changing a voltage @xmath6 applied to a side gate of the ab ring as shown in fig .",
    "the gate voltage irregularly shifts the phase of the ab oscillation , implying that the observed ab oscillation is not an ideal two - path interference , but a complicated multi - path interference .",
    "in contrast , our device can also be tuned into the weak coupling regime by applying a large negative voltage on @xmath5 .",
    "when @xmath5 is properly tuned so that the coupled wire works as a beam splitter to yield high visibility , and the potential change at the transition region between the ab ring and the coupled wire is small enough , the observed two output currents oscillate with opposite phases with almost the same amplitude ( see fig .",
    "2(b ) ) . in other words",
    ", the total outgoing current @xmath13 has very small ab oscillations .",
    "this result strongly suggests that backscattering does not contribute to the main oscillation .",
    "furthermore , when the phase difference between @xmath8 and @xmath9 is exactly @xmath0 , the phase of the oscillation evolves smoothly and linearly with @xmath6 without any jump ( see fig .",
    "2(d ) ) . these results are in contrast to what is observed for the standard two - terminal ab interferometer .",
    "the observed interference does not suffer from the multi - path contribution that modulates the total current , but captures the phase difference between the two paths that linearly shifts with @xmath6 , suggesting the realization of a true two - path interference . in",
    "what follows , we show that the anti - phase oscillation and the smooth phase shift are reproduced in a simple tight - binding model and prove that the measured phase shift is the bare phase shift of the upper path .    in the experiment ,",
    "the visibility in both the in - phase and the anti - phase oscillations is further decreased by the existence of many transmitting channels with different tunnel couplings . however , as we show below , a model with a single channel in each wire captures the above mentioned observed features .",
    "we now construct tight - binding models which imitate the experimental setup and allow a systematic study of the effects of various parameters on the outgoing currents .",
    "the models contain single - level sites @xmath14 , with site energies @xmath15 , and nearest - neighbor hopping matrix elements @xmath16 .",
    "the models are simple enough to be solved fully analytically , so that we can capture clearly the properties of all eigenstates .",
    "the hamiltonian is thus written as @xmath17 where @xmath18 denotes a bond between the neighboring sites @xmath14 and @xmath19 .",
    "the schrdinger equation for the electron s wave function @xmath20 is therefore @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the energy of the electron .",

    "these leads are described by one - dimensional chains , with zero site energies and constant nearest - neighbor hopping matrix elements @xmath23 .",

    "these amplitudes determine the two outgoing currents and the reflected current , via the landauer formula.@xcite in the linear response limit ( zero bias between the left and right leads ) and at zero temperature , the ratios of the two outgoing currents and of the reflected current to the incoming one are given by the two transmission and one reflection coefficients , @xmath34 with @xmath35    \\(a )   + ( b )     we next start with a simple three - terminal interferometer , fig .",
