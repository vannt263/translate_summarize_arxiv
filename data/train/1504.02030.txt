    "till now , we have studied nonclassicality using negative values of the @xmath4 or @xmath1 function .",
    "negative values of the qds only provide a signature of nonclassicality , but they do not provide a quantitative measure of nonclassicality . there do exist some quantitative measures of nonclassicality , see for example , @xcite for a review .",
    "one such measure is nonclassical volume introduced in @xcite . in this approach , the doubled volume of the integrated negative part of the @xmath4 function of a given quantum state is used as a quantitative measure of the quantumness @xcite . using our knowledge of the @xmath4 functions for various systems , studied here",
    ", the nonclassical volume @xmath263 , which is defined as @xmath264 can be computed .",
    "it can be easily observed that a nonzero value of @xmath263 would imply the existence of nonclassicality , but this measure is not useful in measuring inherent nonclassicality in all quantum states .",
    "this is so because , the @xmath4 function is only a witness of nonclassicality ( it does not provide a necessary condition ) .",
    "however , this measure of nonclassicality has been used in a number of optical systems , see for example , @xcite and references therein .    here",
    ", we will illustrate the time evolution of @xmath263 for some of the spin - qubit systems , studied above .",
    "specifically , fig .",
    "[ fig : w_vol ] a and b show the variation of @xmath263 for two spin-@xmath45 systems , initially in an atomic coherent state under the influence of qnd and sgad channels , respectively .",
    "[ fig : w_vol ] c shows two spin-@xmath45 states in a two - qubit vacuum bath . the dashed and dot - dashed lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : w_vol ] a and b , i.e. , for atomic coherent state in qnd with finite temperature and in sgad with finite temperature and squeezing , exhibit the exponential reduction of nonclassical volume with time implying a quick transition from nonclassical to classical states , whereas the smooth lines in a and b ( when temperature and squeezing parameters are taken to be zero ) show that after an initial reduction , the nonclassical volume stabilizes over a reasonably large duration .",
    "thus , nonclassicality does not get completely destroyed with time . a similar nature of time evolution of @xmath263 is also observed for the dashed line in fig .",
    "[ fig : w_vol ] c ( a two qubit state in a vacuum bath with relatively large inter - qubit spacing ) , whereas an oscillatory nature is observed for small inter - qubit spacing , depicted here by a smooth line .",
    "it should be noted that the smooth blue line in fig .",
    "[ fig : w_vol ] b corresponds to the nonclassical volume for an atomic coherent state dissipatively interacting with a vacuum bath , i.e. , at zero temperature and squeezing , while the @xmath4 function of the atomic coherent state , illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : sgad - acs ] , is for non - zero temperature and squeezing . at zero temperature",
    ", the nonclassicality present in the system is expected to survive for a relatively longer period of time .",
    "further , the nonclassical volume is the overall contribution in nonclassicality from all values of @xmath250 and @xmath88 .",
    "it is possible that the @xmath4 function shown for a particular value of @xmath250 and @xmath88 , in the previous sections , may not exibit nonclassical behaviour at time @xmath79 whereas the other possible values provide a finite contribution to nonclassical volume , resulting in a nonvanishing @xmath263 .",
    "interestingly , in fig . [",
    "fig : w_vol ] d for the nonclassical volume of the dicke model , we find that the amount of nonclassicality oscillates with time . this seems to arise from the weakness of the nonclassicality measure used here .",
    "the nonclassical nature of all the systems studied here , of relevance to the fields of quantum optics and information , is illustrated via their quasiprobability distributions as a function of the time of evolution as well as various state or bath parameters .",
    "we also provide a quantitative idea of the amount of nonclassicality observed in some of the systems studied using a measure which essentially makes use of the @xmath4 function .",
    "these issues assume significance in questions related to quantum state engineering , where the central point is to have a clear understanding of coherences in the quantum mechanical system being used .",
    "thus , it is essential to have an understanding over quantum to classical transitions , under ambient conditions .",
    "this is made possible by the present work , where a comprehensive analysis of qds for spin - qubit systems is made under general open system effects , including both pure dephasing as well as dissipation , making it relevant from the perspective of experimental implementation .",
    "along with the well known @xmath4 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 quasiprobability distributions , we also discuss the so called @xmath3 function and specify its relation to the @xmath4 function .",
    "we expect this work to have an impact on issues related to state reconstruction , in the presence of decoherence and dissipation .",
    "these quasiprobability distributions also play an important role in fundamental issues such as complementarity between number and phase distributions as well as for phase dispersion in atomic systems .",
    "it is interesting to note that in @xcite , a connection was established between negative values of a particular quasiprobability and potential for quantum speed - up .",

    "<S> is however foiled due to the uncertainty principle . despite this </S>",
    "<S> , it is possible to construct quasiprobability distributions ( qds ) for quantum mechanical systems in analogy with their classical counterparts @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these qds are very useful in that they provide a quantum classical correspondence and facilitate the calculation of quantum mechanical averages in close analogy to classical phase space averages </S>",
    "<S> . nevertheless , the qds are not probability distributions as they can take negative values as well , a feature that could be used for the identification of quantumness in a system .    </S>",
    "<S> the first such qd was developed by wigner resulting in the epithet wigner function ( @xmath4 ) @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> another , very well known , qd is the @xmath1 function whose development was a precursor to the evolution of the field of quantum optics . </S>",
    "<S> this was originally developed from the possibility of expressing any state of the radiation field in terms of a diagonal sum over coherent states @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath1 function can become singular for quantum states , a feature that promoted the development of other qds such as the @xmath2 function @xcite as well as further highlighted the use of the @xmath4 function which does not have this feature . </S>",
    "<S> these qds are intimately related to the problem of operator orderings . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the @xmath1 and @xmath2 functions are related to the normal and antinormal orderings , respectively , while the @xmath4 function is associated with symmetric operator ordering . </S>",
    "<S> it is quite clear that there can be other qds , apart from the above three , depending upon the operator ordering . </S>",
    "<S> however , among all the possible qds the above three qds are the most widely studied . </S>",
    "<S> there exist several reasons behind the intense interest in these qds . </S>",
    "<S> they can be used to identify the nonclassical ( quantum ) nature of a state @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> specifically , nonpositive values of @xmath1 function define a nonclassical state . </S>",
    "<S> nonpositivity of @xmath1 is a necessary and sufficient criterion for nonclassicality , but other qds provide only sufficient criteria .    </S>",
    "<S> a nonclassical state can be used to perform tasks that are classically impossible . </S>",
    "<S> this fact motivated many studies on nonclassical states , for example , studies on squeezed , antibunched and entangled states . </S>",
    "<S> the interest on nonclassical states has been considerably amplified in the recent past after the advent of quantum information where several applications of nonclassical states , in particular , of entangled states , have been reported @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly many of these applications have been designed using spin - qubit systems .    </S>",
    "<S> quantum optics deals with atom - field interactions . the atoms , in their simplest forms , are modeled as qubits ( two - level systems ) . </S>",
    "<S> these are also of immense practical importance as they can be the effective realizations of rydberg atoms @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> atomic systems are also studied in the context of the dicke model @xcite , a collection of two - level atoms ; in atomic traps @xcite , atomic interferometers @xcite , polarization optics @xcite , and have recently found applications in quantum computation ( @xcite and references therein ) as well as in the generation of long - distance entanglement @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> all these would evoke the question whether one could have qds for such atomic systems as well . </S>",
    "<S> such questions , which are of relevance to the present work , would be closely tied to the problem of development of qds for @xmath5 , spin - like ( spin-@xmath6 ) , systems . such a development was made in @xcite , where a qd on the sphere , naturally related to the @xmath5 dynamical group @xcite , was obtained . </S>",
    "<S> there are by now a number of constructions of spin qds @xcite , among others .    </S>",
    "<S> however , another approach , the one adapted here , is to make use of the connection of @xmath5 geometry to that of a sphere . </S>",
    "<S> the spherical harmonics provide a natural basis for functions on the sphere . </S>",
    "<S> this , along with the general theory of multipole operators @xcite , can be made use of to construct qds of spin ( qubit ) systems as functions of polar and azimuthal angles @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> other constructions , in the literature , of @xmath4 functions for spin-@xmath7 systems can be found in @xcite , among others . a concept that played an important role in the above developments , was the atomic coherent state @xcite , which lead to the definition of atomic @xmath1 function in close analogy to their radiation field counterparts . </S>",
    "<S> another related development , following @xcite where joint probability distributions were obtained for spin-1 systems exposed to quadrupole fields , was a qd obtained from the fourier inversion of the characteristic function of the corresponding probability mass function , using the wigner - weyl correspondence . </S>",
    "<S> this could be called the characteristic function or @xmath3-function approach @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the fields of quantum optics and information have matured to the point where intense experimental investigations are being made . both from the fundamental perspective as well as from the viewpoint of practical realizations , it is imperative to study the evolution of the system of interest taking into account the effect of its ambient environment </S>",
    "<S> . this is achieved systematically by using the formalism of open quantum systems @xcite .    in the present work , </S>",
    "<S> we investigate nonclassicality in a number of spin - qubit systems including single , two and three qubit states , as well as @xmath0 qubit dicke states and a spin-1 system , of importance in the fields of quantum optics and information . </S>",
    "<S> this is done by analyzing the behavior of the well known @xmath4 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 qds on them . </S>",
    "<S> the significance of this is rooted to the phenomena of quantum state engineering , which involves the generation and manipulation of nonclassical states @xcite . in this context , it is imperative to have an understanding over quantum to classical transitions , under ambient conditions . </S>",
    "<S> such an understanding is made possible by the present work , where investigations are done in the presence of open system effects , both purely dephasing ( decoherence ) @xcite , also known as quantum non - demolition ( qnd ) , as well as dissipation @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these aspects of open system evolution have been realized in a series of beautiful experiments @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we also discuss the not so well known @xmath3 function and specify its relation to the @xmath4 function . </S>",
    "<S> further , we expect this work to have an impact on tomography related issues , as borne out in @xcite , where a method for quantum state reconstruction of a system of spins or qubits was proposed using the @xmath2 function . </S>",
    "<S> also , the @xmath2 function , studied here , can be turned to address fundamental issues such as complementarity between number and phase distributions @xcite , under the influence of qnd as well as dissipative interactions with their environment , as well as for phase dispersion in atomic systems @xcite . here , to the best of our knowledge , </S>",
    "<S> we provide , for the first time , a comprehensive analysis of qds for spin - qubit systems under general open system effects .    </S>",
    "<S> the plan of this paper is as follows . in the next section </S>",
    "<S> , we will briefly discuss the qds that will be subsequently used in the rest of the work , i.e. , the @xmath4 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 functions . </S>",
    "<S> this will be followed by a study of open system qds for single qubit states . </S>",
    "<S> next , we take up the case of some interesting two and three qubit states as well as the well known @xmath0 qubit dicke model . </S>",
    "<S> we then discuss , briefly , qds of a spin-1 system . </S>",
    "<S> these examples will provide an understanding of quantum to classical transitions as indicated by the various qds , under general open system evolutions . </S>",
    "<S> although qds have been frequently used to identify the existence of nonclassical states @xcite , they do not directly provide any quantitative measure of the amount of nonclassicality . keeping these in mind , </S>",
    "<S> several measures of nonclassicality have been proposed , but all of them are seen to suffer from some limitations @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a specific measure of nonclassicality is the nonclassical volume , which considers the doubled volume of the integrated negative part of the @xmath4 function as a measure of nonclassicality @xcite . in the penultimate section </S>",
    "<S> , we make a study of quantumness , in some of the systems considered in this work , by using nonclassical volume @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we then make our conclusions .    </S>",
    "<S> [ [ section-1 ] ]    here , we briefly discuss the different qds , i.e. , the @xmath4 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 functions , subsequently used in the paper .      exploiting the connection between spin - like , @xmath5 , systems and the sphere , </S>",
    "<S> a qd can be expressed as a function of the polar and azimuthal angles . </S>",
    "<S> this expanded over a complete basis set , a convenient one being the spherical harmonics , the @xmath4 function for a single spin-@xmath6 state can be expressed as @xcite @xmath8 where @xmath9 , and @xmath10 , and @xmath11 here , @xmath12 are spherical harmonics and @xmath13 are multipole operators given by @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the wigner @xmath16 symbol @xcite and @xmath17 is the clebsh - gordon coefficient . </S>",
    "<S> the multipole operators @xmath13 are orthogonal to each other and they form a complete set with property @xmath18 . the @xmath4 function is normalized as @xmath19 and @xmath20 . </S>",
    "<S> similarly , the @xmath4 function of a two particle system , each with spin-@xmath6 is @xcite @xmath21 where @xmath22 here , @xmath23 is also normalized as @xmath24 further , it is known that any arbitrary operator can be mapped into the @xmath4 function or any other qd discussed here . in what follows , using the same notations we describe @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 functions for single spin-@xmath6 state and for two spin-@xmath6 particles . </S>",
    "<S> it may be noted that all the analytic expressions for the qds given below are normalized .      in analogy with the @xmath1 function for continuous variable systems , the @xmath1 function for a single spin-@xmath6 state </S>",
    "<S> is defined as @xcite @xmath25 and can be shown to be @xmath26 the @xmath1 function for two spin-@xmath6 particles is @xcite @xmath27 here @xmath28 is the atomic coherent state @xcite and can be expressed in terms of the wigner - dicke states @xmath29 as @xmath30      similarly , the @xmath2 function for a single spin-@xmath6 state is @xmath31 and can be expressed as @xcite @xmath32    further , the normalized @xmath2 function for two particle system of spin-@xmath6 @xcite particles is @xmath33      the @xmath3 distribution function @xcite is defined using the relation between fano statistical tensors and state multipole operators . specifically , for a single spin-@xmath6 state , it is defined as @xcite @xmath34 similarly , the normalized @xmath3 function for a two particle , spin-@xmath6 , @xcite system is @xmath35    to summarize , all the qds discussed in this work are normalized to unity . </S>",
    "<S> they are also real functions as they correspond to probability density functions for classical states . </S>",
    "<S> the density matrix of a quantum state can be reconstructed from these qds @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> one can also calculate the expectation value of an operator from them @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> it would be appropriate here to make a brief comparison of the qds , discussed above , with their continuous variable counterparts . </S>",
    "<S> the coherent state and thereby the displacement operator @xmath36 , which generate coherent states from vacuum and is usually expressed as @xmath37 with @xmath38 , @xmath39 being the annihilation and creation operators of the given fock space , respectively , play a central role in these considerations . </S>",
    "<S> thus , for example , the wigner function , associated with a state @xmath40 is the symplectic fourier transform of the mean value of @xmath36 in the state @xmath40 , leading to the standard representation of the wigner function as the fourier transform of the skewed matrix representation of @xmath40 , @xmath41 with @xmath42 and @xmath43 being real and @xmath44 . </S>",
    "<S> similarly , the @xmath1 function is associated with the diagonal representation of the state @xmath40 in terms of the coherent state , while the @xmath2 function is related to the expectation value of @xmath40 , with respect to coherent states .    </S>",
    "<S> the multipole operators @xmath13 ( [ eq : multipole - operator ] ) play a pivotal role in the construction of qds of spin systems , discussed here . </S>",
    "<S> these operators are extensively used in the study of atomic and nuclear radiation and can be shown to have properties analogous to those of the coherent state dispalcement operator @xmath36 for usual continuous variable bosonic systems @xcite . in this sense , the properties of spin qds are analogous to those of their continuous variable counterparts , with the atomic coherent state playing the role of the usual coherent state . </S>",
    "<S> thus , for example , even though , for the spin ( qubit ) systems , both @xmath1 and @xmath4 qds are witnesses of quantum correlations , in the sense that their negative values indicate quantumnes in the system , it is possible for a scenario wherein the @xmath1 function is negative and @xmath4 is positive , but not viceversa . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath2 function is always positive , while the @xmath3 function is same as the @xmath4 function for spin-@xmath45 systems , as shown below .    before proceeding further , </S>",
    "<S> it is worth noting here that for all the spin-@xmath45 states ( qubits ) , single or multi - qubit , the @xmath4 and @xmath3 qds are identical . </S>",
    "<S> specifically , for the single qubit case , the @xmath4 function is @xmath46 where @xmath47 , while , the @xmath3 function is @xmath48 where the term inside the brackets with square root is @xmath49 for both the values of @xmath50 ( i.e. , @xmath51 or @xmath52 ) . </S>",
    "<S> similarly , for two spin-@xmath45 states , the @xmath4 and @xmath3 functions are @xmath53 where @xmath54 and the term in the brackets is @xmath55 for all the possible values of @xmath56 and @xmath57 . </S>",
    "<S> this can further be extended for higher number of spin-@xmath45 states .    </S>",
    "<S> since the @xmath4 and @xmath3 functions are the same for spin-@xmath45 systems , we will not discuss the evolution of the @xmath3 function of these systems .    </S>",
    "<S> [ [ section-2 ] ]    here , we consider single spin-@xmath45 states , initially in an atomic coherent state , in the presence of two different noises , i.e. , qnd @xcite , which are purely dephasing , and the dissipative sgad ( squeezed generalized amplitude damping ) @xcite noises . for calculating the qds , we will require multipole operators for @xmath58 and @xmath59 , giving @xmath60 and @xmath52 . for @xmath60 , @xmath61 , and for @xmath62 , @xmath63 . </S>",

    "<S> the oscillatory nature of the qds for atomic coherent state when subjected to qnd noise can be attributed to the purely dephasing effect of the qnd interaction . </S>",
    "<S> that is , this process involves decoherence without any dissipation . at temperature @xmath94 decoherence is minimal and hence an oscillatory pattern is observed in the depicted time scale . with increase in @xmath93 , resulting in increase in the influence of decoherence , these oscillations gradually decrease .      </S>",
