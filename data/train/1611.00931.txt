    "whole sky imagers ( wsis ) are becoming popular among the remote sensing community .",
    "they provide instantaneous data of cloud formations and are thus useful in a variety of applications  @xcite .",
    "wsis complement satellite images with localized data of higher temporal and spatial resolution .",
    "they capture images of the sky at regular intervals and archive them for processing .",
    "most wsis use traditional cameras in the visible - light spectrum @xcite , while a few models capture the near - infrared range as well @xcite .",
    "typical post - processing algorithms include the computation of the fraction of the sky covered by clouds  @xcite , the recognition of cloud types  @xcite , or the estimation of the cloud base height  @xcite .",
    "a prerequisite for these applications is the segmentation of clouds from the sky , with each pixel of the image classified as either _ sky _ or _",
    "cloud_. as the sky is predominantly blue because of rayleigh scattering , most existing approaches use thresholding on an ad - hoc combination of red and blue color channels  @xcite .",
    "kreuter et al .",
    "@xcite used a fixed threshold for the blue / red ratio .",
    "calb and sabburg @xcite use various statistical features ( mean , standard deviation , entropy , etc . ) obtained from red and blue channels for successful detection and subsequent labeling of pixels .",
    "the difference of red and blue channels is exploited in @xcite .",
    "the saturation channel of the hsv color model is used in @xcite .",
    "recently , li et al .",
    "@xcite proposed the use of a normalized red / blue ratio for cloud detection .",
    "we believe only a structured review of color channels allows us to systematically select the one(s ) with the most _ discriminative _ cues .",
    "this helps to efficiently represent the images in a lower - dimensional subspace .",
    "such systematic analysis of color channels for sky / cloud images is important for subsequent tasks , such as cloud type recognition or feature matching in cloud base height estimation .",
    "an analysis of several color channels for sky / cloud segmentation is provided in our previous works , where we used bimodality  @xcite and principal component analysis  @xcite to determine favorable channels .",
    "however , these techniques had certain shortcomings with regards to ranking color channels according to their relevance for cloud segmentation , as their correlation with cloud segmentation accuracy is relatively weak .",
    "several other techniques have been used for selecting the most discriminative features in a classification problem .",
    "serrano et al .",
    "@xcite chose the area under the receiver operator characteristic ( roc ) curves @xcite for feature selection in a synthetic dataset .",
    "information - theoretic measures like kullback - leibler ( kl ) distance or divergence have been applied to band selection in hyperspectral imaging  @xcite .",
    "our main contribution in this letter is to determine those color channels that are most discriminative in identifying cloud pixels in traditional visible - light images .",
    "we extend the benchmarking done in @xcite using a",
    "_ rough set _ based approach that can accurately assess the efficiency of different color channels for cloud segmentation .",
    "rough set theory , originally introduced by pawlak  @xcite , is useful for representing uncertain data with a level of approximation , and selecting the most discriminative features from the feature space .",
    "recently , it has been successfully applied to hyperspectral band selection  @xcite . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "our proposed approach is the first that uses rough set theory for color channel selection in visible - light images .",
    "the remaining letter is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : rs ] , we describe the fundamental concepts behind rough set theory and present our proposed color channel selection algorithm .",
    "experimental results are presented in section  [ sec : exp ] .",
    "finally , section  [ sec : conclusion ] concludes the letter .",
    "classical rough sets @xcite are an approximation of conventional sets in set theory . in a scenario where it is difficult to define the boundaries of a conventional set",
    ", rough set theory provides a set of mathematical tools to define them in a approximate way .",
    "it facilitates an objective analysis in a data - driven system which is vague , uncertain and incomplete . here",
    "we first explain the related terminologies of rough sets , and subsequently define the use of rough sets for visible - light images .      in rough sets",
    ", information is expressed in the form of a _",
    "decision table_. we define a decision table @xmath0 such that each row represents an observation , and each column is an attribute from attribute set @xmath1 .",
    "this non - empty set of observations is usually referred to as the _ universe _ @xmath2 .",
    "formally , for each entry in the decision table , we define the function @xmath3 that maps attribute @xmath1 to value domain @xmath4 , @xmath5 .",
    "any reduct @xmath6 from the set of attributes @xmath1 satisfies the indiscernibility ( or equivalence ) relation ind(@xmath6 ) . for any reduct @xmath7",
    ", the @xmath6-indiscernibility relation is defined as : @xmath8 where @xmath9 and @xmath10 are two observations from the universe @xmath2 , and @xmath11 is an element from set @xmath6 .",
    "this indicates that @xmath9 and @xmath10 are indiscernable based on the attribute @xmath6 , as the value function @xmath3 assigns both @xmath9 and @xmath10 to the same value .",

    "rough set theory asks the question : how can we express this conventional set @xmath13 , using only the information in attribute set @xmath6 ?",
    "in general , there is no precise answer , and therefore approximations are generated .",
    "they are defined by their corresponding @xmath6-_lower_- and @xmath6-_upper_-approximations as :    [ eq : low - upp ] @xmath14 | [ x_m ] \\subseteq \\mathcal{x}\\},\\ ] ] @xmath15 | [ x_m ] \\cap \\mathcal{x } \\neq \\phi\\}.\\ ] ]    the observations in the lower approximation set @xmath16 are the definite members of @xmath13 , also called the _ positive _ region @xmath17 . on the other hand",

    "the main benefit of using rough set theory is that it provides a systematic method to approximate the segmentation ground truth , with the highest degree of approximation .",

    "[ fig : corr](c ) , where favorable color channels @xmath34 and @xmath36 have comparatively lower kl - divergence values , and color channel @xmath39 has the highest kl - distance . however , the order of ranking for the other color channels is poor , leading to a low correlation value ( @xmath40 ) .    from these results ,",
    "we observe that the relevance criterion has the highest correlation with the cloud segmentation accuracy among all methods .",
    "therefore we conclude that our proposed rough set based color channel selection algorithm is useful to rank color channels and identify suitable ones for image segmentation .",
