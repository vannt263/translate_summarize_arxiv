    "<S> we obtain exact analytical results for lattices of maps with couplings that decay with distance as @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> we analyze the effect of the coupling range on the system dynamics through the lyapunov spectrum . for lattices </S>",
    "<S> whose elements are piecewise linear maps , we get an algebraic expression for the lyapunov spectrum . when the local dynamics is given by a nonlinear map , the lyapunov spectrum for a completely synchronized state is analytically obtained . </S>",
    "<S> the critical lines characterizing the synchronization transition are determined from the expression for the largest transversal lyapunov exponent . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , it is shown that in the thermodynamical limit , such transition is only possible for sufficiently long - range interactions , namely , for @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the lattice dimension .    </S>",
    "<S> 24.8 cm    2    synchronization between coupled chaotic systems is one of the most intriguing nonlinear phenomena @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it has attracted much interest since two decades ago @xcite as it appears in a wide range of real systems such as in arrays of josephson junctions @xcite , oscillating chemical reactions @xcite , physiological processes @xcite , and has applications as in communications @xcite and control theory @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> there are many types of synchronized behavior @xcite , but we are particularly interested in the completely synchronized states ( csss ) of coupled map lattices ( cmls ) , where all maps present the same amplitude at all times . </S>",
    "<S> complete synchronization is an example of non - equilibrium phase transition @xcite , which may be related to actual critical phenomena like the superconducting - normal transition in josephson junctions @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> cmls , which are dynamical systems with discrete space and time , and a continuous state variable , have been investigated as theoretical models of spatiotemporal phenomena in a variety of problems in condensed matter physics , neuroscience and chemical physics @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the spatiotemporal behavior is governed by two simultaneous mechanisms : the intrinsic nonlinear dynamics of each map , and diffusion due to the spatial coupling between maps ; the dynamical pattern being the outcome of the competition between them . </S>",
    "<S> this applies , in particular , to the problem of synchronization of chaotic maps @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the effective coupling range is a crucial factor to determine whether or not chaotic maps mutually synchronize . nearest - neighbor couplings ( short range ) </S>",
    "<S> do not favor synchronization , since the coupling effect is typically too weak to overcome the intrinsic randomness of map dynamics @xcite . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> long - range couplings tend to facilitate synchronization , as exemplified by the limiting case of global ( mean - field ) coupling @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> lattices of non - locally coupled maps appear in neural networks with local production of information @xcite , models of physico - chemical reactions @xcite , assemblies of biological cells with oscillatory activity @xcite , and diffusion coupling in nucleation kinetics @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> beyond cmls , systems with many degrees of freedom with long - range couplings are an interesting object of study because of their anomalies ( appearing at the level of the macroscopic thermodynamical description as well as in the underlying microscopic dynamics ) , which still require deeper understanding @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> simple dynamical models , such as cmls , may add new knowledge on non - equilibrium long range systems . however , there is a lack of analytical results for cmls with arbitrary range couplings . </S>",
    "<S> exact analytical results are particularly crucial because the occurrence of phenomena such as shadowing breakdown @xcite or spurious synchronization @xcite set difficulties in numerical approaches due to the unavoidable finite precision of numerical simulations .    here </S>",
    "<S> we examine a form of coupling whose intensity decays with the distance @xmath3 between sites as @xmath4 , with @xmath5 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it has also been considered in biological networks @xcite , in ferromagnetic spin models @xcite , many - particle conservative ( hamiltonian time evolution ) classical systems @xcite , large populations of limit cycle oscillators @xcite and a generalization of the kuramoto model @xcite , among other examples . </S>",
    "<S> explicitly , we consider a chain of @xmath6 coupled one - dimensional chaotic maps @xmath7 such that the coupling prescription is    @xmath8    where @xmath9 represents the state variable for the site @xmath10 @xmath11 at time @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the coupling strength and effective range , respectively , and @xmath15 , is the normalization factor , with @xmath16 for odd @xmath6 . in conservative systems </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , scaling by @xmath17 plays an important role in making the systems pseudo - extensive . </S>",
    "<S> here periodic boundary conditions @xmath18 and random initial conditions are assumed . </S>",
    "<S> the coupling term is a weighted average of discretized spatial second derivatives , the normalization factors being the sum of the corresponding statistical weights . </S>",
    "<S> it is straightforward to prove that in the limits @xmath19 and @xmath20 eq . ( [ cml ] ) reduces to the global mean - field and the local laplacian - type couplings , respectively .    </S>",
    "<S> we characterize the spatio - temporal synchronization dynamics by means of the lyapunov spectrum ( ls ) of the lattice , that enables one to estimate , for instance , the kolmogorov - sinai entropy through the pesin formula @xcite and the lyapunov dimension , which gives an upper bound on the effective number of degrees of freedom needed to characterize the system dynamics @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> besides characterizing a css , when it exists at all , we must investigate its stability with respect to small perturbations . </S>",
    "<S> if the css turns out to be dynamically unstable , we are faced with two possibilities : either the css presents the so called bubbling attractor , and in this case the css only lasts for a finite time , or the css loses transversal stability through a blowout bifurcation @xcite .    in this work we will present exact analytical results for the cml ( [ cml ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> we will show that for a 1d lattice of @xmath6 coupled piecewise linear maps it is possible to obtain an exact analytical expression for the ls , the results shown in @xcite being recovered in the limits @xmath19 and @xmath21 . </S>",
    "<S> when the maps @xmath22 are nonlinear , we will show that analytical results are still possible for csss . by means of the algebraic formulas for the ls </S>",
    "<S> , one can find the synchronization regions in the @xmath23 space , since the second largest lyapunov exponent ( belonging to the direction transversal to the sm ) equal to zero indicates a transition to the synchronized state @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> finally , the results obtained for a chain of maps will be extended to @xmath2-dimensional hypercubic lattices .    in order to calculate </S>",
    "<S> the ls one has to consider the tangent dynamics . by differentiating the equations of the original maps ( [ cml ] ) , </S>",
    "<S> one obtains the evolution equations for tangent vectors @xmath24 , that in matrix form read @xmath25 , with the jacobian matrix @xmath26 given by    @xmath27{\\bf d}_n ,   \\label{tanmatrix}\\ ] ]    where the matrices @xmath28 and @xmath29 are defined , respectively , by @xmath30 and @xmath31 , being @xmath32 . </S>",
    "<S> notice that the particular choice of the interaction law is embodied in the matrix @xmath29 which is time independent .    once specified the initial conditions , </S>",
    "<S> the ls is extracted from the evolution of the initial tangent vector @xmath33 : @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is product of @xmath12 jacobian matrices calculated at successive points of the discrete trajectory . </S>",
    "<S> if @xmath36 are the eigenvalues of @xmath37 ( that are real and positive ) , the lyapunov exponents are obtained as @xcite    @xmath38    we start by applying the expressions above to the piecewise linear maps @xmath39 ( mod 1 ) , with @xmath40 . in this case </S>",
    "<S> we have @xmath41 , therefore @xmath42 , and @xmath26 becomes    @xmath43\\equiv \\beta \\hat{\\bf </S>",

    "<S> so , in order to obtain the ls , it is enough to diagonalize @xmath29 . </S>",
    "<S> because of its periodicity , @xmath29 can be diagonalized in fourier space @xcite , the eigenvalues being    @xmath46    where we considered odd @xmath6 . finally , from eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ lyap1 ] ) , taking into account the special form of @xmath47 , the ls is given by    @xmath48    this expression is consistent with previous numerical results @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in the extreme cases @xmath49 and @xmath19 the known expressions @xcite are recovered .    now we will consider lattices of nonlinear maps . </S>",
    "<S> an important case that can be tackled easily is the one where the maps are in the css . as it will become clear soon </S>",
    "<S> , this instance provides relevant information on the synchronization transition . in the css , </S>",
    "<S> the dynamical variables of all maps coincide , i.e , @xmath50 , at each time step @xmath12 . </S>",

    "<S> therefore , for the css , following eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ lyap1 ] ) , one arrives at    @xmath55    where @xmath56 are the eigenvalues of @xmath29 defined in ( [ beigenvalues ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> assuming ergodicity , the time - average in ( [ beigenstar ] ) can be substituted by an average over the single - map attractor . in this way one gets    @xmath57    where @xmath58 is the lyapunov exponent of an uncoupled map . </S>",
    "<S> this expression is _ general _ : it applies to any lattice of nonlinear 1d maps coupled with the scheme here considered , the parameters that define the particular uncoupled map affecting only @xmath59 . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , for the logistic map @xmath60 , with @xmath61 and @xmath62 $ ] , @xmath63 @xcite and the contribution of the power - law coupling is always @xmath64 . </S>",
    "<S> notice that the ls in csss has the same structure as the ls obtained for piecewise linear maps [ eqs . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ beigenvalues])-([spectrum ] ) ] .    </S>",
    "<S> the synchronization transition can be characterized by a complex order parameter @xcite defined , for time @xmath12 , as @xmath65 . a time - averaged amplitude @xmath66 is computed over an interval large enough to warrant that the lattice has attained the asymptotic state . in the css </S>",
    "<S> , one has @xmath67 . on the opposite case of completely non - synchronized maps , the site state variables @xmath68 </S>",
    "<S> are so uncorrelated that @xmath69 .    </S>",
    "<S> a diagnostic of synchronization can also be extracted from the ls . </S>",
    "<S> it can be easily verified that , for arbitrary @xmath51 , the css lies along the direction of the eigenvector associated to the largest exponent . </S>",
    "<S> this was previously observed by kaneko for the particular case @xmath19 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the css will be transversally stable if the @xmath70 remaining exponents are non positive , that is , @xmath71 ( where the tilde stands for ordered exponents ) . </S>",
    "<S> the second largest exponent , @xmath72 , corresponds in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ spectrum_css ] ) , to @xmath73 ( or @xmath74 , due to degeneracy ) if the argument of the modulus in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ spectrum_css ] ) is positive and to @xmath75 ( or @xmath76 ) otherwise . </S>",
    "<S> one obtains    @xmath77    where @xmath78 ( @xmath79 ) are the coupling strengths below ( above ) which the sm ceases to be transversely stable , such that synchronized states are not typically observed . </S>",
    "<S> it is noteworthy that eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ critical ] ) is _ quite general _ for the coupling scheme here considered : the parameters that define the particular uncoupled nonlinear map ( embedded in @xmath59 ) just participate through the first factor .     for a 1d lattice of @xmath6 coupled logistic maps @xmath80 and @xmath81 . </S>",
    "<S> the critical line @xmath82 was determined analytically from eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ critical ] ) for different values of @xmath6 ( full lines ) and numerically from the conditions @xmath83 ( open symbols ) and @xmath84 ( full symbols ) for @xmath85 and 51.,scaledwidth=40.0% ]    fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 1 presents the lower critical line in the parameter space @xmath23 for @xmath6 coupled logistic maps @xmath80 . </S>",
    "<S> the critical line was obtained analytically from eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ critical ] ) and numerically by means of two procedures : either when @xmath86 is numerically detected or by the condition of nullity of the second largest lyapunov exponent in the css . </S>",
    "<S> the numerical results are in good agreement with the analytical prediction .    as can be observed in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1 , the critical frontier depends on the system size @xmath6 . in the limit @xmath87 </S>",
    "<S> we obtain    @xmath88    where @xmath89 corresponds to    @xmath90             \\biggl [ \\sum_{m=1}^{n^\\prime } \\frac{1}{m^{\\alpha } } \\biggr]^{-1 }   \\biggr).\\ ] ]    this limit is equal to unity for @xmath91 , so that eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ critical_inf ] ) furnishes a divergent result . for @xmath51 outside the domain of convergence of the series </S>",
    "<S> , one gets    @xmath92    moreover , one has @xmath93 , if @xmath94 . </S>",
    "<S> then , in the limit @xmath87 , synchronization is only possible for sufficiently long - range interactions ( see fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2 ) , namely , for @xmath95 . </S>",
    "<S> the critical value here obtained for 1d cmls is different from the one reported for other 1d systems with similar power - law interactions , such as ferromagnetic spin models @xcite or many - particle classical hamiltonian systems @xcite ; in such cases , the critical value for the existence of an order / disorder transition is @xmath96 . in a generalization of the kuramoto model , </S>",
    "<S> the value of @xmath97 is controversial : while @xmath96 was first reported @xcite , recent analytical considerations point to @xmath98 @xcite . although the generalized kuramoto model is a continuous time dynamical system , our analytical result for the upper bound of the critical value suggests that the latter value is the correct one .    </S>",
    "<S> the expressions we have derived for the ls of chains of maps can be straightforwardly generalized for hypercubic lattices of arbitrary dimension @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , for the general @xmath2-dimensional case , it is straightforward to show that the eigenvalues of the matrix @xmath29 become    @xmath99    where @xmath100 is the position vector of site @xmath101 , @xmath102 , with @xmath103 , and @xmath104 . </S>",
    "<S> the normalization factor reads @xmath105    then , following the same lines as before but now for the sake of generalizing eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ critical_inf ] ) , it is easy to see that @xmath106 will diverge if @xmath107 , which leads to @xmath108 .    additionally , our results for the ls could be extended to the more general class of coupling schemes where the dependence of the coupling strength on the inter - map distance is not necessarily of the power - law type . in these cases </S>",
