    "power - laws are intrinsic features of the economic and financial data as well .",
    "the aim of this contribution is to analyze a relation between the origin of the power law distribution and the power - law correlations in financial time series .",

    "however , the investigation of the model revealed , that the simple additive brownian model of time interval between trades failed to reproduce power - law probability density distribution ( pdf ) of trading activity . on the other hand ,",
    "several authors showed empirically that the fluctuations of various financial time series possess multifractal statistics @xcite .",
