    "the substrates with round holes with various diameters were prepared by photolithography and dry etching of si substrates covered with a 300  nm - thick sio@xmath9 layer .",
    "the depth of the holes is @xmath11.7  @xmath10 m , deep enough to prevent interference from laser light reflected and scattered from the bottom of the holes.@xcite the diameters were 2.6 , 3.6 , 4.6 , and 6.6  @xmath10 m .",
    "the graphene samples were prepared directly on the cleaned substrate by mechanical exfoliation from natural graphite flakes .",
    "no chemical treatment of the sample was involved in the preparation process .",
    "this ensures that the sample surface is free from chemical contaminants that may affect the measured @xmath3 values .",
    "the sample used was a single - layer graphene flake of 35@xmath1160  @xmath10m@xmath12 dimensions identified by the line shape of the @xmath13 band in the raman spectrum@xcite ( fig.[fig : fig1.eps ] ) . the 514.5-nm",
    "( 2.41  ev ) beam of an ar ion laser was focused onto the graphene sample by a 50@xmath11 microscope objective lens ( 0.8 n.a . ) , and the scattered light was collected and collimated by the same objective .",
    "the scattered signal was dispersed with a jobin - yvon triax 550 spectrometer ( 1800 grooves / mm ) and detected with a liquid - nitrogen - cooled charge - coupled - device detector .",
    "the spectral resolution was about 0.7  cm@xmath2 .",
    "the laser spot size was measured using the modified knife - edge method:@xcite the raman intensity of the si phonon peak was monitored as the laser spot is scanned across the straight sharp edge of a ti patch deposited on si . by fitting the intensity to @xmath15 , @xmath16 m was obtained .",
    "figure [ fig : fig1.eps ] shows a typical raman spectrum of suspended single - layer graphene obtained with a laser intensity of 1.0  mw .",
    "there is no indication of the defect - induced @xmath0 peak , attesting to the high quality of the sample .",
    "although all our measurements were performed on a single piece of a graphene sample , there are some hole - to - hole variations in the low - power raman spectrum , indicating some inhomogeneities .",
    "the absorption of the laser beam by the sample induces local heating that raises the temperature in the vicinity of the laser spot . in a steady state , there exists a temperature gradient that depends on the total power supplied by the laser beam , @xmath3 , and the boundary conditions at the edge of the hole . the local temperature at the laser spot can be estimated from the shift of the raman @xmath17 or @xmath13 bands .",
    "the temperature dependence of the raman spectrum of graphene has been studied by several groups.@xcite most of the studies were conducted on graphene samples on substrates . in those cases , the raman spectrum may be affected by the strain induced by the difference in the thermal expansion coefficients of the substrate and graphene , in addition to the purely thermal effect .",
    "since graphene samples suspended over a trench or a hole is less affected by the strain due to the thermal expansion coefficient difference , we used the values reported recently by chen _ _ et al.__@xcite on _ suspended _ graphene samples .",
    "they measured the temperature coefficients of the @xmath17 and @xmath13 bands and found that the @xmath13 band ( @xmath18cm@xmath2k@xmath2 ) is more sensitive to temperature than the @xmath17 band ( @xmath19cm@xmath2k@xmath2 ) .",
    "therefore , we used the @xmath13 band for the estimate of the temperature in this work .",
    "figure [ fig : fig2.eps ] summarizes the shift of the @xmath13 band as a function of the incident laser power . as the laser power increases , the @xmath13 band frequency redshifts due to increased heating . for smaller holes ,",
    "the shift is smaller because efficient heat conduction to the substrate limits the temperature rise at the laser spot .",
    "it should be noted that the largest hole ( 6.6  @xmath10 m ) shows a smaller shift than the 4.6-@xmath10 m hole .",
    "this trend was confirmed by repeated measurements on several holes .",
    "this may be explained in the following way .",
    "as the hole size increases , the laser spot moves away from the edge of the hole , reducing the heat conduction to the substrate , and the temperature should increase . beyond a certain hole size",
    ", the temperature would saturate if one ignores the thermal conduction to the ambient air .",
    "in reality , the conduction to air , however small , would decrease the temperature for larger holes , resulting in a smaller temperature rise for the larger holes .     band as a function of the laser power . ]    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     in order to estimate the thermal conductivity , we used the heat diffusion equation ignoring the heat conduction to the ambient air .",
    "we considered heat conduction through suspended graphene and supported graphene on the substrate as well as between graphene and the substrate .",
    "the substrate is assumed to be a heat sink at the ambient temperature . with cylindrical symmetry , one can write the heat diffusion equation as :    @xmath20    where @xmath21 is the radius of the hole , @xmath22 is the radial position , and @xmath3 is the thermal conductivity of _ suspended _ graphene .",
    "@xmath23 is the heat inflow per unit volume due to laser excitation , where @xmath24 is the laser intensity , @xmath25 is the absorptance of light in single layer graphene ( 2.3%),@xcite and @xmath26 is the thickness of graphene ( 0.335  nm ) . outside the hole , where graphene is supported by the substrate",
    ", the following equation applies :    @xmath27    where @xmath28 is the thermal conductivity of _ supported _ graphene ( 600  wm@xmath2k@xmath2),@xcite @xmath29 is the ambient temperature , and @xmath30 is the interfacial thermal conductance between graphene and sio@xmath31 ( 100  mwm@xmath32k@xmath2).@xcite the general solutions to eqs .",
    "( [ eq:1 ] ) and ( [ eq:2 ] ) are    @xmath33    where @xmath34 s are arbitrary constants , @xmath35 is an exponential integral , @xmath36 and @xmath37 are the zero - order modified bessel functions , and @xmath38 . for a converging solution , @xmath39=0 .",
    "the boundary conditions are :    @xmath40    where @xmath41 is the total laser power absorbed . the coefficients @xmath34 s of eqs .",
    "( [ eq:3 ] ) and ( [ eq:4 ] ) are determined from these boundary conditions .",
    "on the other hand , the measured temperature ( @xmath42 ) is an weighted average of temperature inside the beam spot and can be approximated as    @xmath43    by comparing the measured @xmath42 with eq .",
    "( [ eq:9 ] ) , one can determine the thermal conductivity @xmath3 .",
    "figure [ fig : fig3.eps ] shows thus determined @xmath3 as a function of the measured temperature .",
    "the error bars are quite large for lower temperatures because @xmath44 , which determines @xmath42 , is quite small in comparison to the measurement resolution .",
    "therefore , the @xmath3 values at temperatures below 325 k are not very reliable .",
    "it seems that @xmath3 decreases as the temperature increases : from @xmath11800  wm@xmath2k@xmath2 near 325  k to @xmath1710  wm@xmath2k@xmath2 near 500  k.    [ t ]     our thermal conductivity values are somewhat lower than those reported for cvd graphene.@xcite in that work , the measured @xmath3 is 2600  3100  wm@xmath2k@xmath2 near 350  k. the major difference in that work is that they measured the transmittance ( @xmath45 ) of the graphene sample and took @xmath46 as the absorptance .",
    "their value was 3.4% , which is 50% larger than the recently determined value of 2.3%.@xcite reflection and scattering of light on the sample surface and/or other loss of the transmitted light may account for the difference .",
    "if we use the absorptance of 3.4% , we obtain a @xmath3 value of @xmath12700  wm@xmath2k@xmath2 at @xmath1325  k , similar to the value for cvd - grown graphene . on the other hand , faugeras _",
    "et al . _ reported @xmath3 of @xmath1630  wm@xmath2k@xmath2 at @xmath1660  k for exfoliated graphene,@xcite which is rather close to our result at 500  k. another source of uncertainty in the analysis is the temperature coefficient of the raman @xmath13 band .",
    "a 20% variation in the temperature coefficient value would result in a similar variation in the obtained @xmath3 value .    in light of the above analysis , the initially reported value of 5300  wm@xmath2k@xmath2 by balandin _",
    "et al . _ seems to be significantly overestimated .",
    "the most significant difference between their analysis and those of recent publications including our work is the value of the absorptance @xmath25 of single layer graphene .",
    "they used @xmath47% , which is several times larger than the value of 2.3% accurately measured and theoretically analyzed by nair _",
    "et al_.@xcite if one uses @xmath48% , their @xmath3 value would reduce to @xmath49  wm@xmath2k@xmath2 .",
