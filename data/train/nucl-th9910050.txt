    "ever since the advent of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) it has been popular to describe the nucleon in terms of bag or soliton models .",
    "there are many versions of such models , characterized by two extremes : the mit bag model @xcite , where the nucleon consists of just constituent quarks arbitrarily restricted in a given volume , and the skyrme model @xcite , where there are no quarks and the nucleon is instead a topological soliton of the pion field .",
    "other models interpolate between these two extremes , seeking to combine the obvious emphases on the structure of nucleons within the mit bag model and on nuclear interactions via meson exchange within the skyrme model . for example , chiral bag models @xcite surround an mit - like bag of quarks with a skyrme - like cloud of pions ( and perhaps other mesons as well ) . clearly , each such model attempts to balance between low - energy degrees of freedom  the mesons  and high - energy degrees of freedom  the quarks ( and possibly gluons as well ) .",
    "our aim here is to develop a model that as simply as possible , but without losing essential physics , combines quark and meson degrees of freedom .",
    "this task is made more difficult by the `` cheshire cat principle '' @xcite , an extrapolation of results found from chiral bag models , which find that low - energy nucleon properties are largely insensitive to the size of the quark bag . as the bag shrinks , the meson cloud forms more and more of the nuclear structure . to select a model ,",
    "we must study nuclear properties that distinguish between a bag of quarks and a cloud of mesons .",
    "an obvious testing ground for any bag or soliton model is dense baryon matter , where the structure of individual nucleons will become as important as the interactions between neighboring nucleons .",
    "preferably , the model will have a dynamical formation of the bag or soliton , for then one can treat the transition to a quark - gluon plasma consistently .",
    "surprisingly enough , the skyrme model , which may be thought of as a chiral bag model with the quark bag shrunk to zero size , does predict a dynamical transition to a phase of solitons of fractional baryon number at high densities @xcite ; however , identifying this phase with a quark - gluon plasma is certainly problematic .",
    "thus in this paper we study dense nuclear matter in a set of models known as non - topological soliton ( nts ) models .",
    "in particular , we study the friedberg - lee ( fl ) model @xcite and a class of related models , the chiral chromodielectric ( @xmath1cd ) models @xcite , as well as extensions of these models ( or , one might argue , approximations to these models ) that explicitly include couplings to mesons .",
    "these models , based upon general arguments from qcd , are characterized by the coupling of quarks to a scalar field @xmath0 that has a nonzero vacuum expectation field .",
    "this field is understood to be a composite gluon field .",
    "the interaction between the quarks and scalar field leads to a dynamical confinement mechanism , with the quarks carving a hole in the background scalar field .",
    "the structure of this bag depends precisely on how the quarks couple to the scalar field , and it is this coupling that distinguishes the various models we study here .",
    "all these models reproduce single nucleon properties reasonably well  indeed , chiral bag models show that single nucleon properties are relatively insensitive to the structure of the quark bag .",
    "we must look at high densities , where the bags begin to overlap , to see the differences between models with different quark-@xmath0 couplings .    in the last few years there",
    "also has been considerable interest in the application of the quark - meson coupling ( qmc ) model to study the nuclear matter equation of state , as well as medium effects on the nucleon structure and nucleon - meson coupling , motivated by the apparent success of the walecka qhd models @xcite in describing the properties of nuclear matter .",
    "the qmc model , initially suggested by guichon @xcite , consists of non - overlapping nucleon ( mit ) bags that interact through the exchange of scalar and vector mesons in the mean - field approximation ( mfa ) .",
    "this model has been generalized to include fermi motion and center of mass corrections @xcite and was applied to nuclear matter ( see @xcite and references therein ) and also to finite nuclei @xcite .",
    "of course , the assumption that the nucleons can be regarded as non - overlapping bags is only valid at low density , where these models seem to capture the essential physics . already at nuclear saturation density , however , the internucleon separation is comparable to the nucleon radius , and at higher densities the assumption that the bags do not overlap clearly breaks down .",
    "this assumption becomes even more questionable when a modification of the bag constant in nuclear matter is taken into account .",
    "jin and jennings @xcite and mller and jennings @xcite have recently shown that the introduction of a density - dependent bag constant can reproduce the emc effect and reconcile the qmc results with those of the walecka qhd - i model @xcite .",
    "as a result @xcite the bag radius grows with increasing density and the overlapping of the bags starts just above nuclear saturation density .    to take into account the effects from overlapping nucleon bags",
    " that is , to study a nuclear liquid rather a nuclear gas  it is clearly of interest to introduce some dynamics in the confining mechanism .",
    "thus we are led to replace the mit bag model by a nts model .",
    "although the study of nuclear matter properties was begun long ago ( see @xcite and references therein ) and was carried out with different soliton models and with different levels of sophistication ( see @xcite and references therein ) , none of these calculations included the effect of background meson fields on nuclear matter . now , in principle , the non - topological soliton models  in particular , the @xmath1cd model , which in its full form includes perturbative gluon exchange  contain sea quarks and meson exchange explicitly .",
    "however , in practice it is very difficult to deal with anything besides the nuclear constituent quarks . in the interest of simplicity",
    "( and at the sacrifice of consistency ) , we extend our nts models to include explicitly meson degrees of freedom .",
    "( such an extension has been referred to as the local uniform approximation to @xmath1cd in @xcite . )    in the following , then , we shall study a system of non - topological solitons interacting via the exchange of scalar and vector mesons within the mfa .",
    "in modeling nuclear matter each soliton is centered in a spherical wigner - seitz ( ws ) cell .",
    "it has been argued that the choice of a spherical ws cell is more appropriate for a fluid phase than a crystal as it represents an angular average over neighbouring sites .",
    "we consider two further approximations : in one , the ws calculation is simply used to provide an effective nucleon mass and the kinetic energy is then taken to be that of a fermi gas , thus providing the correct low - density limit .",
    "a second approximation uses a bloch - like boundary condition to calculate the band structure of the quark states .",
    "neither of these approximations is quite satisfactory , and the second paper of this series is devoted to improving the modeling of a liquid of solitons .",
    "nevertheless , we can still hope that the major qualitive features of dense nuclear matter will be reproduced even given the two approximations used here .",
    "indeed , we find some encouraging results such as nuclear saturation and an increase of the proton rms with nuclear density . these effects are shown to derive from the background meson fields , which have a considerable effect on the formation of energy bands in nuclear matter .    in this paper",
    "we limit our attention to friedberg - lee soliton type models extended to include the meson fields .",
    "the non - topological soliton models are presented in sec .",
    "[ sec : models ] .",
    "the wigner - seitz approximation is then discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : ws ] . in sec .",
    "[ sec : trivial ] we study in some detail the trivial solution of the model . using these solutions",
    "we show that the high density limit of the friedberg - lee type models depends on the leading power of the quark-@xmath0 coupling vertex .",
    "the numerical results are presented in sec .",
    "[ sec : results ]",
    "our starting point for studying the high density behavior of soliton matter is the friedberg - lee @xcite non - topological soliton model , and we also consider related models like the chiral chromodielectric model of fai , perry and wilets @xcite . in their simplest versions",
    ", these models include only constituent quarks and a single scalar field @xmath0 that couples to the quarks . for the light",
    "quarks we shall assume @xmath2 .",
    "extending these models in the spirit of the quark - meson coupling model , we introduce in addition two meson fields : namely , a scalar meson @xmath3 and a vector meson @xmath4 , which play important roles in quantum hadrodynamics .",
    "we assume these mesons couple linearly to the quarks .",
    "there is some freedom in the structure of the quark - meson vertex , in regard to its dependence on the soliton field @xmath0 . using the nielsen - patkos lagrangian @xcite ,",
    "banerjee and tjon @xcite have recently argued that in nts models the quark - meson coupling should also depend on the scalar soliton field .",
    "similar conclusions are reached by krein , _ et al .",
    "however , we have found that this causes unwanted behavior within the mean field and wigner - seitz approximations used here ( see sec .",
    "4 ) , and so we report calculations that use @xmath0-independent quark - meson couplings .",

    "the approximation that the scalar and vector mesons fields can be regarded as constants while the soliton field is to depend on spatial coordinates stems from the long range nature of the light mesons and the short range nature of the soliton field due to the large glueball mass .",
    "in essence , the mesons are fast degrees of freedom and the glueball is slow , and we use a born - oppenheimer approximation .",

    "the notation @xmath42 stands for an average over the wigner - seitz cell .",
    "thus @xmath43 is the expectation value of the quark momentum squared and @xmath44 is the scalar soliton momentum squared .",
    "the latter average is obtained using a coherent state approximation @xcite , which is essentially a single mode correction to the classical soliton mass .",
    "we find this latter correction to be small with respect to the total mass of the soliton and ignore it henceforth ( it is not clear how valid this single - mode approximation is : at higher density we find that this correction exceeds the energy of the @xmath0 field , with both going to zero ) .",
    "at low density the band width vanishes and the quarks are confined in separate bags .",
    "then we expect the following approximation to be most accurate : we assume the individual nucleons move around as a gas of fermions with effective mass @xmath45 given by eq .",
    "( [ m_n ] ) , and so we get the following estimate for the total energy density at nuclear density @xmath46 : @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the spin - isospin degeneracy of the nucleons .",

    "which includes higher partial waves in the quark wave functions and direct computation of the bands , the calculation breaks down already at a cell radius @xmath821.4 fm .",
    "we view this as a fault of the model and not of the ws approximation , for regardless of whether our restricting the soliton to a single spherical cell represents a dense system well or not , our model of the nucleon should nevertheless allow the soliton to be squeezed to volumes well below nuclear density before it breaks apart . ( the saturation density of nuclear matter is @xmath83=0.17@xmath84 , which corresponds to a ws cell radius @xmath85=1.12fm . )",
    "this leads us to look for improvements upon the original fl model , and the two particular extensions studied in this paper are generalizations of the quark - glueball coupling @xmath86 and the addition of explicit meson degrees of freedom . before proceeding to the numerical results ,",
    "let us look at how these extensions affect the trivial solution .",
    "the trivial solution to the ws equations ( [ u_r]-[sigma_r ] ) is @xmath87 , @xmath88 and @xmath89 , where the constants @xmath70 and @xmath90 are independent of both @xmath91 and @xmath92 .",
    "strictly , for @xmath93 this solution does not satisfy our boundary conditions ; however , we find that below a given cell volume the numerical solution develops a singularity at the boundary in order to reproduce this preferred solution . moreover , the more accurate self - consistent calculations of @xcite for the fl model ( which do not assume just @xmath94-wave states in the quark wave function ) show that the width of the band also narrows sharply at the onset of the trivial solution , indicating that the @xmath92-dependence is not important . thus in order to find the trivial solution that characterizes the breaking down of the ws calculation , we may assume that all the quarks are at the bottom of the band .",
    "this corresponds to squeezing an isolated soliton , and we insist that our model favors a nontrivial solution until the cell radius gets well below that corresponding to nuclear density .    in the present section we shall consider altering the quark - meson couplings in our models as suggested in lagrangian @xcite , namely : @xmath95 this will allow us to investigate whether the coupling to meson fields can help cure the breaking down of the fl model at too low density .",

    "the point at which the band begins to form , @xmath151fm , is not very sensitive to the value of @xmath141 . on the other hand ,",
    "the structure of the band depends strongly on the coupling to the scalar meson , becoming wider as @xmath141 is increased . in fig .",
    "6 we present the energy of the soliton @xmath36 given by eq .",
    "( [ e_nr ] ) , and in fig .",
    "7 we show the total energy per baryon @xmath152 of the system , derived from eq .",
    "( [ eeos ] ) . as expected , the introduction of the scalar meson to the the soliton matter results in attraction and saturation .",
    "the empirical nuclear saturation density corresponds to @xmath153 fm , whereas from fig .",
    "7 we see , for example , that our nts nuclear matter energy per baryon has a minimum at @xmath154fm for @xmath155 .",
    "the saturation energy is @xmath156 mev , as compared to the empirical value @xmath157 mev .",
    "the compression modulus of nuclear matter is @xmath158 at the equilibrium point : for the present model we find @xmath159mev .",
    "this is to be compared to empirical estimates that usually lie in the range @xmath160-@xmath161mev , with @xmath162mev the generally accepted value@xcite .",
    "these results should be regarded as only order of magnitude , as at higher density we are surely underestimating the kinetic energy of the system .",
    "we shall develop a more reasonable model of the liquid state , which leads to a more quantitatively accurate eos for solitonic nuclear matter , in the next paper of this series .",
    "the solution for the @xmath1cd model is stable down to very low values of @xmath54 ( at least as low as @xmath126 fm ) , and it is apparent that with proper calibration this model can be used as an excellent starting point for the study of nuclear matter . another important feature of this model is the increase of the nucleon rms with density , fig .",
    "this unexpected outcome of the model is in accord with the emc effect .",
    "checking the sensitivity of this effect to model parameters , we found that the increase in the rms is insensitive to recoil corrections , but might disappear with different choices of the soliton parameters .",
    "in this paper we have investigated a class of non - topological soliton models that generalize the friedberg - lee model .",
    "we have studied nuclear matter in the wigner - seitz approximation , where neighboring bags begin to overlap at higher density , as a means of distinguishing between the various models .",
    "the models differ in the precise form of the coupling between the quarks and the scalar gluon field , and in the presence and form of couplings to explicit meson fields . of the models",
    "studied , we have found the chiral chromodielectric model to exhibit behavior best in line with phenomenological expectations . for this model",
    ", there is no breakdown in the wigner - seitz calculation as the cell radius is decreased , thus overcoming a serious shortcoming of the original fl model .",
    "we consider it a computational necessity to consider only constituent quarks and ignore colored gluons and sea quarks , and thus these restrictions along with the addition of explicit meson fields may be seen as an approximation to the original theory .",
    "the original @xmath1cd model is closely based upon qcd , exhibiting absolute confinement , and it is therefore satisfying to see that this model is selected by our studies of nuclear matter .",
    "we include mesons along the lines of quantum hadrodynamics , and we use the mean field approximation . in our final calculations",
    "we have considered only the scalar meson , but it is straightforward to include also the vector meson , which should be done for fine - tuning the parameters .",
    "we note that we found it best to use a quark - meson coupling that is not modulated by the quark - glueball coupling , in contrast to that argued for in refs .",
    "@xcite . indeed , when using a @xmath163 coupling proportional to @xmath86 , we find jumps to qualitatively different solutions as density is increased .",
    "the resulting curve of energy as a function of cell radius has several bumps , which is clearly an undesirable feature .",
    "however , this should not necessarily be taken as an argument against models that employ quark - meson couplings that depend on @xmath0 , but rather merely a statement that when using the mean field approximation it is more consistent to use a @xmath0-independent @xmath81-@xmath3 coupling @xmath141 .",
    "indeed , one can view this coupling as a `` mean field approximation '' to a more fundamental coupling  namely , @xmath164 .    in the end , then , we have used a @xmath1cd model with @xmath0-independent coupling between quarks and the scalar meson .",
    "we find that the inclusion of the scalar meson provides a clear saturation point for nuclear matter and that a rough fit to both empirical nuclear matter and single nucleon properties can be obtained .",
    "one of the most interesting features found is an increase in the nucleon rms radius at intermediate densities , in line with the emc effect .",
    "this is dependent on the presence of the scalar meson .",
    "there are clearly several refinements to our model and our calculations that must be considered before fine - tuning the parameters . among these are the inclusion of other mesons in the model , the addition of perturbative gluonic effects , and an improved calculation of the quark wave function along the lines of ref .",
    "one can also improve our handling of the spurious cm motion .",
    "foremost , however , we need to improve our modeling of the liquid state .",
    "in this paper we have used a low - density approximation in modeling nuclear matter with solitons .",
    "this consists in using a wigner - seitz approximation to calculate an effective nucleon mass .",
    "then the kinetic energy is added to the system by taking the motion of the nucleons to be that of a fermi gas .",
    "the assumptions of this picture include : the nuclear medium restricts any given nuclear bag to a spherical cell ; any given nucleon moves slowly , so that it can be constructed at rest and then boosted ; the quarks remain tightly bound inside the bag ; the nucleons move independently within the medium",
    ". only the first of these assumptions can remain valid at high densities , where the nuclear medium will form a liquid in which each nucleon s motion is localized on short time scales and quarks need not remain tightly bound inside the bag .",
    "since we are ultimately interested in studying the transition to a uniform quark plasma within our non - topological soliton model , we must do a better job of modeling the liquid state at high densities .",
    "this is the subject of our next paper .",
    "we thank j.a . tjon for helpful discussions ."
