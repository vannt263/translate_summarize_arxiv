    "the choice of doubly alternating baxter permutations is a part of a general program of study of pattern - avoiding permutations .",

    "* @xmath202 ) for the introduction and references ) .",

    "we refer to  @xcite for strongly related results , and some interesting extensions for larger patterns .      following the ideas in  @xcite and  @xcite , one can ask whether for a given ( generalized ) pattern there is always a limit surface , and whether it is degenerate . since the set of bistochastic matrices is a compact ( in fact , the _ birkhoff polytope _ ) , the answer to the former is likely yes .",
    "but the latter question seems difficult and currently out of reach .",
    "the fact that the limit surface @xmath10 is highly symmetric and piecewise smooth came as a surprise , as in the initial experiments for averages of all @xmath204 , the graphs exhibited fewer symmetries and numerous small spikes , see figure  [ fig : skipes ] . of course ,",
    "these spiked are due to the the parity differences in formula  @xmath205 in the main lemma , and as @xmath46  grows , they gradually disappear .",

    "let us note that for the case of size  3 patterns mentioned in  @xmath213 , the random restricted permutations do in fact resemble their limit shapes , due to exponentially small decay of probabilities away from the anti - diagonal .",
    "however , in the the case of random @xmath214 , permutations tend to exhibit a high degree or structure , and do not resemble the limit surface  @xmath10 .",
    "this suggests that computing square - to - square correlations would an interesting problem .",
    "while we expect this to be doable , this goes outside the scope of our project",
    ".      it would be interesting to compute the limit shape of random baxter permutations .",
    "while they can be sampled exactly uniformly ( see e.g.  @xcite ) , the underlying bijection does not seem to give any useful formulas .",
    "in fact , a special effort is required to sample beyond @xmath215 .",
    "still , the apparent connection to @xmath10 is undeniable ( see figure  [ fig : baxter - alt ] ) .",
    "a possible explanation lies in the `` flat structure '' of alternating permutations . as evident from figure  [",
    "fig : baxter - alt ] for  @xmath216 , there seem to be a limit surface of alternating permutations , with no spikes except at the boundary . in fact , the existence of such a flat surface follows from the asymptotics of entringer numbers given in  @xcite .",
