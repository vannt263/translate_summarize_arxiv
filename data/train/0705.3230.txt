    "production requires the creation of a heavy @xmath4 pair with energy greater than @xmath5 , a scale at which the strong coupling constant is small enough that perturbation theory can be used . however , hadronization probes much smaller mass scales of order @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the typical velocity of the quarks in the quarkonium . for @xmath0 , @xmath6 is numerically of order @xmath8 so the production process is sensitive to nonperturbative physics as well .",
    "many phenomenological problems can be understood well enough by using the non - relativistic quantum chromodynamics ( nrqcd )  @xcite .",
    "nrqcd provides a generalized factorization theorem that includes nonperturbative corrections to the color - singlet model .",

    "in addition to the inclusive measurements , belle reports a cross section for exclusive double charmonium production which exceeds previous theoretical estimates .",
    "recent attempts to address the latter problem can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the inclusive @xmath0 production at the @xmath11 factories is another potential conflict between experimental observations and theoretical predictions using nrqcd  @xcite .",

    "the significant enhancement of the cross section accompanied by the change in angular distribution were proposed as a distinctive signal of color - octet mechanisms in ref .",
    "it was expected that these effects would be confined to @xmath0 whose momentum is within a few hundred mev of the maximum allowed .    however , experimental results do not agree with these expectations . the cross section data as a function of momentum does not exhibit any enhancement in the bins closest to the endpoint . on the other hand , the total cross section measured by the two experiments exceeds predictions based on the color - singlet model alone",
    ". the total prompt @xmath0 cross section , which includes feeddown from @xmath20 and @xmath21 states but not from @xmath11 decays , is measured to be @xmath22 pb by babar , while belle measures @xmath23 pb . estimates of the color - singlet contribution range from @xmath24 pb @xcite .",

    "the degrees of freedom needed to describe this inclusive jet have been integrated out of nrqcd , and thus can not be described by the effective field theory .",

    "the simple model chosen , a good fit to the data was obtained .    however , to be consistent , the color - singlet contribution should also be summed in the endpoint region .",
    "this is the goal of the present paper .",
    "the kinematic logarithms in the @xmath51 color - singlet contribution are small , since the mass of the charm quark acts as a cutoff .",
    "however , we would expect that the summed @xmath52 color - singlet rate would be suppressed relative to the unsuppressed rate .",
    "this would help alleviate the discrepancy with the open charm data .",
    "however , we would not expect a very large suppression except right near the endpoint , and thus do not expect that this will be a solution to the @xmath53 open charm question .",
    "this will be confirmed in our analysis in this paper .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organized as follows . in sec ii a factorization theorem for @xmath0 production near the endpoint is developed .",
    "then in sec iii the sudakov logarithms are summed , including mixing with the @xmath54 final state . in sec",
    "iv the phenomenology of the @xmath0 production is investigated , and finally we conclude in sec v. a similar treatment of nonperturbative and perturbative endpoint corrections to the color - singlet and color - octet contributions in the inclusive decay @xmath55 can be found in refs .",
    "@xcite , and we will rely on some of the results from these papers .",
    "similar results have been previously reported in ref .",
    "in this section , we will derive a factorization theorem for @xmath56 near the kinematic endpoint , where the rate can be factored into a hard coefficient , a collinear jet function and a ultrasoft shape function .",

    "the nrqcd factorization formula breaks down because nrqcd does not include appropriate collinear modes . when @xmath75 , the jet is no longer highly virtual . since @xmath76 , the gluon jet is composed of energetic particles with small invariant mass which must be included explicitly in the effective theory .",
    "hence , a new factorization theorem is needed to handle the end point , which can be derived using a combination of nrqcd for the heavy quark degrees of freedom and scet@xcite which includes the collinear physics .",
    "scet has collinear degrees of freedom whose momentum scales as @xmath77 , @xmath78 , and @xmath79 , soft degrees of freedom whose momentum scales as @xmath80 and ultrasoft ( usoft ) degrees of freedom whose momentum scales as @xmath81 .",

    "note that this implies that the resummation of the color - singlet contribution are not big enough to explain the anomalously large contribution to @xmath0 associated with extra @xmath167 found at the @xmath11 factories  @xcite .    .",

    "since the resummation is independent of the angle , both curves drop to the same value at the endpoint , @xmath203 away from the endpoint , the resummed color - singlet rate is slightly larger than the leading - order rate .",
    "however , to explain the data , we still need to include the color - octet contribution .    .",
    "the solid curve is the scet prediction , with @xmath191 and the dashed curve is the lowest - order nrqcd prediction .",
    "[ ap]_,width=432 ]    to make a prediction for the differential cross section , we need to combine the color - singlet results discussed in this paper with the resummed color - octet results from ref .",
    "given the size of the corrections found in this paper , the results are qualitatively the same as those presented in ref .",
    "in this paper , we study the color - singlet contribution to @xmath3 production in @xmath57 collision near the kinematic end point by using a combination of scet and nrqcd .",
    "the calculation consists of matching onto a color - singlet operator in scet which integrates out the hard scale . by decoupling the usoft modes from the collinear modes using a field redefinition , we are able to show a factorization theorem for the differential cross section",
    ". the differential rate can be factorized into a hard piece , a collinear jet function , and an usoft function . as pointed out by ref .",
    "@xcite the usoft function in this case can be calculated , resulting in just a shift from the partonic to the physical endpoint .    by running the resulting rate from the hard scale to the collinear scale ,",
    "we sum the logarithms of the ratio of the hard and colliear scales , which correspond to large sudakov logarithms of @xmath169 . finally , we combine the scet calculation with the leading order , color - singlet nrqcd result to make a prediction for the color - singlet contribution to the differential cross section over the entire allowed kinematic range . if we combine the results for the color - singlet calculation given in this paper the resummed results for the color - octet calculation given in ref .",
    "@xcite , we now have a consistent prediction over the entire kinematic range for the @xmath204 differential cross section .",
    "to be consistent the resummation of the color - singlet presented here must be included .",
    "however , except for right near the endpoint the size of the corrections are small .",
    "the color - octet contributions , as can be seen from ref .",
    "@xcite , are necessary to get a reasonable fit to the data and are larger than the color - singlet contribution over all of phase space . therefore , while the quantitative picture changes slightly , the qualitative picture is the same with or without running as what was presented in ref .  @xcite .",
    "in particular , we still do not have an explanation for the unexpectedly large number of @xmath0 being produced with extra charm .",
