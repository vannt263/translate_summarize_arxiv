    "the nearest targets ( for which we have the greatest sensitivity ) are generally mature , main sequence stars broadly similar to our sun , where the signatures of planet formation have long since been replaced by processes endemic to mature planetary systems .",
    "we must therefore study the properties of planetary systems indirectly .",
    "it is generally thought that the formation of planetesimals is a natural byproduct of ( advanced ) planetary system formation ; our solar system s asteroid belt and kuiper belt are remnant small body populations that reflect the epoch of planet formation .",
    "these small bodies , in our solar system and in others , occasionally collide , producing collisional cascades that ultimately produce dust .",
    "because dust is the most easily observable component of planetary systems due to its relatively large surface area , one avenue to understanding planetary system formation is to study dusty debris disks around other stars .",

    "dust heated by stellar radiation to temperatures of tens to hundreds of kelvins is best observed at mid- and far - infrared wavelengths , where the contrast ratio between the thermal emission of the dust and the radiation of the star is most favorable . in many cases",
    "the dust temperature and fractional luminosity can be measured or constrained from the observations . under certain assumptions of grain properties ( size , albedo , emissivity , size distribution ) estimates can be made of the dust mass present and potentially of the properties of the planetesimals that produced the observed dust grains ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "dust in planetary systems generally must be ephemeral because the timescales for dust removal are short compared to the main sequence ages of the host stars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the processes of dust production and removal are more complicated in multiple systems than around single stars , but any dust must nevertheless be regenerated from a source population of colliding bodies .",
    "dust production can either be through a continuous collisional cascade , through stochastic ( occasional ) collisions , or derived from individual bodies ( e.g. , sublimation from comets ) .",
    "ultimately , a relatively substantial population of larger bodies ( planetesimals : meter - sized up to planet - sized ) is implied under either model of dust production , and argues that planet formation must have proceeded to some degree in every system with dust , and therefore every system with excess thermal emission .",

    "we conclude with a discussion of the implications of our observations for planet and planetary system formation in binary systems .",
    "we observed 69  binary ( in some cases , multiple ) main sequence star systems in order to study the processes of planetary formation in multiple systems and particularly to search for effects of binary separation on the presence of debris disks .",
    "we chose to observe late a through early f stars for reasons of economy : their photospheres are bright and we could thus reach a systematic sensitivity limit for a significant sample in the shortest observing time .",
    "the primaries in our sample are 18  a  stars ( a3 through a9 ) and 51  f  stars ( f0 through f8 ) .",
    "we have not done an exhaustive study for higher multiplicity ( greater than binarity ) for the 69  systems in our sample .",
    "our targets were vetted to eliminate high backgrounds , and were chosen independent of whether iras data implies any excess for that system .",
    "our target list also excludes systems with extreme flux ratios between the two components , and the secondary is generally g - type or earlier ; in practice , this information is available for only one third of our targets .",
    "our primary goal is to determine whether the incidence of debris disks in binary systems is different than that for single stars .",
    "our secondary goal is to determine whether there is any effect on debris disk properties due to binary separation .",
    "our sample is therefore divided into three subsamples by binary separation to look for possible trends in the frequency of infrared excess ( that is , planetary system formation ) as a function of binary separation .",
    "( in some cases , these separations are the projected separations , not the actual orbital distance . )",
    "21  targets in this program have separations less than 3  au ; 23  systems have separations of 350  au ; and 19  systems have separations of 50500  au .",

    "we used the multiband imaging photometer for _ spitzer _ ( mips ; * ? ? ? * ) to make observations of each system at 24  and , for most systems , 70  ( effective wavelengths 23.68  and 71.42  , respectively ) .",
    "all stars were observed using the mips photometry observing template in small - field mode .",
    "the 24  observations were all made using 3  sec dces ( data collection events ) and a single template cycle .",
    "the 70  observations typically used 10  sec dces and 5 to 10 template cycles .",
    "data were processed using the mips instrument team data analysis tool @xcite .",
    "for the 24  data basic processing included slope fitting , flat - fielding , and corrections for droop and readout offset ( jailbar ) .",
    "additional corrections were made to remove the effects of scattered light ( which can introduce a gradient in the images and an offset in brightness that depends on scan - mirror position ) , and the application of a second order flat , derived from the data itself , to correct latents that were present in some of the observations .",
    "the 70  data processing was basically identical to that of the _ spitzer _ pipeline ( version s13 ) .",
    "mosaics were constructed using pixels 1245 and 4925 square at 24  and 70  , respectively ( about 1/2 the native pixel scale of those arrays ) .",
    "we used aperture photometry to measure the fluxes from our target systems .",
    "aperture corrections were computed using smoothed stinytim model psfs @xcite for a 7000  k blackbody source .",
    "the model psfs were smoothed until they provided good agreement with observed stellar psfs , as described in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the psf full width at half maximum at 24  and 70  is 64 and 193 , respectively .",
    "systems with angular separations less than 6   are unresolved at both mips wavelengths . for these targets , fluxes were measured using relatively small apertures of 996 and 394 in diameter ( at 24  and 70  , respectively ) to improve the signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) of the measurements .",
    "( in a few cases at 24  nearby sources contributed some flux at the target location , so we used apertures 25% smaller than those just described to reduce contamination . ) systems with angular separations between 6and 30  are resolved at 24  but not at 70  . for these cases , we used apertures 35  in radius to measure the system - integrated flux . where the components were visible and clearly separated ( at 24  ) , we compared the photometry from the large aperture with the sum of the fluxes from the individual components ( measured using the smaller apertures ) as a cross check .",
    "five systems have large enough angular separations ( @xmath430 ) that they are resolved not only at 24  but also at 70  : hd  142908 , hd  61497 , hd  77190 , hd  196885 , and hd  111066 .",
    "for these five systems , only photometry for the primary is measured , modeled , and reported ; we have no measurements for the companions through either being too faint or out of the field of view .",
    "the photometric aperture was centered at the center - of - light of each target except in cases where the 70  detection was weak or there was cirrus or background contamination , where we forced the aperture to be centered at the target coordinates .",
    "the fluxes we report are based on conversion factors of 1.048  @xmath5jy / arcsec@xmath6/(dn / s ) and 16.5  mjy / arcsec@xmath6/u70 at 24  and 70  , equal to the calibration in the _ spitzer _ science center pipeline version s13 ( further details on calibration can be found in @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite ) .",
    "the 24  and 70   photometry for all sources observed in this program is reported in table  [ photom ] , together with the system - integrated v  and k  band magnitudes used in photospheric model fitting ( section  [ modeling ] ) .",
    "all targets were strongly detected at 24  , with intrinsic s / n in the hundreds to thousands .",
    "the 70  observations were planned such that the predicted combined photospheric flux from the system could be detected with s / n of at least  3 in 1000  second ; the 16  systems that did not meet this criterion were not observed at 70  .",
    "we also discard from our statistical sample the three sources that were observed at 70  but not detected , leaving 50  good observations at 70  .",
    "all measurements are subject to both photometric ( measurement ) error and a uniform calibration uncertainty of 4% at 24  and 8% at 70  @xcite .",
    "these two sources of error are rss - combined to calculate the total errors presented in table  [ photom ] .",
    "we observed 13 of our systems at 870  with the heinrich hertz submillimeter telescope on mt .",
    "graham , arizona .",
    "the data were reduced using the nic package , which produces mosaicked images from the 19-channels of the detector , subtracts the `` off '' images from the `` on , '' and accounts for atmospheric opacity ( which we measured regularly using sky - dips ) .",
    "flux calibrations were derived from observations of the planets ( primarily neptune and mars ) .",
    "the typical 3-sigma sensitivity achieved in those observations was @xmath730  mjy .",
    "none of the 13  systems were detected above the 3-sigma level , and upper limits for each system are given in table  [ photom ] .",
    "our submillimeter observing program was cut short due to the failure of the facility bolometer array , and the remaining systems have not been observed by us in the submillimeter .",
    "assuming an excess temperature of 50  k , the `` minimum temperature fit '' that we employ below and which gives the maximum submillimeter flux , the ratio of 70  flux to 870  flux is  @xmath712 , so the 70  flux ideally would have to be greater than @xmath7350  mjy for us to have made a significant detection in the submillimeter .",
    "hd  13161 is the only target in our sample with a 70  flux greater than 150  mjy .",
    "since this target unfortunately was not observed before the demise of the bolometer array , it is not surprising that all of our 870  observations are upper limits .",
    "for all 13  sources observed at 870  the upper limits do not significantly constrain the debris disk models that we present in this paper .",
    "from published visible and near - infrared data , we determine the best - fit kurucz model spectrum ; details of this process are described in appendix  [ details ] .",
    "many of our systems are resolved in visible and near - infrared data , but almost all are unresolved at one or both _ spitzer _ wavelengths ( section  [ spitzer ] ) .",
    "our approach is therefore to combine fluxes at any wavelength where the components are resolved into a single system - integrated flux measurement ( with the five exceptions listed in section  [ spitzer ] and table  [ photom ] ) .",
    "we model the combined flux from each binary system as a single stellar source .",
    "this approach is satisfactory regardless of the ( dis)similarity between the two spectral types : for every primary star presented here , no secondary spectral type changes the the slope of the rayleigh - jeans part of the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) by more than 1% from the trivial case of primary and secondary stars having identical spectral types .",
    "the errors in our predictions are therefore always small compared to other sources of error .    using the best - fit kurucz model , we predict the fluxes for the _ spitzer _ observations at the 24  and 70  effective wavelengths .",
    "these predicted photospheric fluxes are listed in table  [ photom ] . in figure  [ sedfig ]",
    "we show seds for two binary systems with no excess emission in our mips observations .",
    "these systems are representative of our method of photosphere modeling and predicting 24  and 70  photometry .",
    "the measured _ spitzer _",
    "photometry falls quite close to the predicted fluxes in all cases .",
    "it is clear that our technique of fitting a single temperature model works quite satisfactorily both in the visible / near - infrared and also at _ spitzer _ wavelengths .",
    "we use the ratio ( r ) of observed flux ( f ) to predicted flux ( p ) to determine the excess threshold and to identify excess emission . in figure  [ fp ]",
    "we show histograms of r24 and r70 for all observed systems .",
    "the r24 distribution is well fit by a gaussian centered at r24  =  0.99 and @xmath8 .",
    "we take a conservative approach , adopting an excess threshold ratio of  1.15 ( figure  [ fp ] , top ) , which formally is slightly more than 3-sigma .",
    "the r24 dispersion less than unity , which should represent excursions @xmath93@xmath10 , extends smoothly down to  0.85 , confirming @xmath8 .",
    "it is more difficult to produce a well - fit gaussian to the 70  data because there are only 50  measurements ( fewer than at 24  ) , of which more than one third likely have excesses ( figure  [ fp ] , middle ) .",
    "the scatter in the r70 distribution implies @xmath11 , centered near unity , suggesting that we adopt a 3-sigma error threshold of  1.30 .",
    "we note that both the r24 and r70 excess thresholds are consistent with , though perhaps somewhat larger than , the errors due to systematic calibration uncertainties , giving us confidence that our thresholds are accurate but also conservative .    in most cases , our observed 24  and 70",
    "fluxes are within 1  sigma ( 5% and 10% , respectively ) of the predictions ( table  [ photom ] ) , confirming that our photospheric predictions are good .",
    "occasionally the measured fluxes are less than the predictions by 23  sigma , and a number of cases have observed fluxes that are greater  in some cases , substantially so  than the predictions . some of these individual cases with significant excesses are discussed in section  [ interest ] .",
    "we note , however , that one 24  and three 70  measurements have r values that deviate from unity by more than 3@xmath10 ( table  [ photom ] ) .",
    "the existence of these low r24 and r70 values may indicate that we have underestimated the scatter in the data , as we would expect no values more than 3@xmath10 below unity for a sample of this size .",
    "this may in turn imply that a few systems that we identify as excesses based on their r values may be spurious ( noise rather than true excesses ) . for this reason , we introduce the additional requirement of having significant excess emission , as follows .",
    "we calculate the significance ( @xmath12 ) of a detected excess as    @xmath13    where f and p are as defined above and @xmath10 is the total error ( photometric error [ noise ] and calibration error , added in quadrature ) of the measurement .",
    "this figure of merit @xmath12 is calculated for each measurement at each wavelength ( table  [ photom ] ) .",
    "the significance of a measurement that exactly matches the prediction is zero .    formally , to identify excess emission from a system",
    ", we require that r be greater than the thresholds derived above _ and _ that the significance be 2.0  or greater .",
    "thus , systems like hd  8556 are , sensibly , excluded from being valid excess detections ( with r70  =  1.35 and @xmath14 , the `` excess '' @xmath15 here is comparable to the total error @xmath10 ) .",
    "we list all valid excess systems in table  [ excesstable ] .      using the criteria explained above , we find that 9@xmath0% of the systems have excess emission at 24  ( 6/69 ) and 40@xmath1%  show excess at 70  ( 20/50 ) , using binomial errors that include 68% of the probability ( equivalent to the 1@xmath10 range for gaussian errors ) , as defined in @xcite .",
    "four systems have excesses at both wavelengths .",
    "individual 24  excesses range from 16% to 47% above the predicted combined photospheric flux ( figure  [ fp ] , table  [ excesstable ] ) .",
    "r70 ranges from  1.3 to more than  25 ( figure  [ fp ] , table  [ excesstable ] ) .",
    "a 100% excess above the predicted combined photosphere ( that is , r  of  2 ) means that the thermally emitting dust in the system is as bright as the total flux from the star at the specified wavelength .",
    "eleven systems have r70@xmath162.0 .",
    "these very large excesses indicate relatively high fractional luminosities , which in turn imply large amounts of dust in these systems .",
    "seven sources have iras 25  fluxes @xcite more than 30% above the predicted photosphere : hd  13161 , hd  13594 , hd  16920 , hd  20320 , hd  80671 , hd  83808 , and hd  118216 ( considering only quality flag  3 data ) .",
    "one source has a measured iras 60  flux more than 50% above its predicted photosphere : hd  13161 ( again , considering only quality flag  3 data ) . except for hd  13594 ,",
    "the iras measurements , after color- and wavelength - corrections , are all quite consistent with our _ spitzer _ measurements ( table  [ photom ] , table  [ excesstable ] ) and we confirm the iras - detected excesses for these six systems ( indeed , as indicated in section  [ interest ] and appendix  [ notes ] , several systems were identified as excess systems previously based on the iras data ) . in contrast , the color - corrected iras 25  measurement for hd  13594 is 50% higher than our 24  measurement , and two sigma above the predicted photospheric flux at 25  ( using the iras reported error ) .",
    "we see no additional sources in our 24  image of this target ; contamination in the large iras beam is probably not the explanation for the high 25  flux .",
    "we speculate that the iras measurement is simply anomalously high .",
    "since debris disk searches are often still based on catalogs of iras - selected excesses , we identify here hd  13594 as a false excess so that future disk searches need not spend time observing this source .",
    "r24 and r70 as a function of separation are shown for the individual measurements in our sample in figure  [ separations ] . the systems with excess are shown in figure  [ hist ] .",
    "the excess rates for small and large separation systems are around 50% , and there are fewer medium separation systems with excesses than either small or large separation systems .",
    "the relative lack of excesses in systems with medium separations confirms our theoretical expectations ( see section  [ bias ] ) . a smaller excess rate for medium separation systems is also in agreement with observations of pre - main - sequence binaries that suggest that systems with separations 150  au ( approximately equal to our medium separation bin ) have significantly fainter disks than systems with large separations @xcite .",
    "the significances of high excess rates for small and wide separation binaries , and a low excess rate for medium separation binaries , are discussed in section  [ context ] .        in previous sections",
    "we have discussed excess emission detected at 24  and 70  .",
    "we now move to the astrophysical interpretation of this excess emission as thermal radiation from dust grains heated by the radiation fields of the star(s ) .",
    "we assume these grains are large and model them as blackbodies .",
    "( we briefly explore the implications of non - black - body grains in section  [ nonbb ] . )",
    "we derive best - fit temperatures for these dust grains , assuming a single temperature for the ensemble population , based on a uniform distance from a single radiation source . while the radiation and temperature fields in binary systems are certainly more complicated than these simple assumptions , in general the results of these approximations will be adequate to help us understand the properties of the systems we observe and allow comparisons among the systems presented here , and to results presented elsewhere .    to calculate dust temperatures for systems with excesses",
    ", we used the following techniques . for systems with both 24  and 70  excesses ( four systems )",
    ", we fit a blackbody to the excess emission in both bands . for systems with only a 70  excess",
    ", we fit the 70  excess emission and the 3-sigma upper limit on the 24  emission ( that is , the predicted flux plus three times the 1-sigma error bar ) .",
    "this approach produces an upper limit to the excess temperature ( and dust luminosity ) consistent with our data . for the three systems with excess emission detected only at 24",
    ", we took the approaches described in section  [ interest ] .",
    "our calculated temperatures for excesses are listed in table  [ excesstable ] .",
    "we again emphasize that these temperatures are the _ maximum _ temperatures that can be fit to the seds . in section  [ mindust ]",
    "we explore `` minimum '' temperature solutions for the excess systems , and the implications thereof .      after solving for the dust temperature ( @xmath17 )",
    ", we can calculate the orbital distance @xmath18 ( in au ) of the dust through equation  3 from @xcite :    @xmath19    where @xmath20 is the ( combined ) stellar luminosity .",
    "we calculate the combined stellar luminosity of the host star(s ) simply through    @xmath21    where @xmath22 is the stellar radius ( from * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the stellar effective temperature @xmath23 is given in table  [ targetinfo ] .    because we know the luminosity of the ( combined ) host stars from our photospheric fitting , for each system we can also calculate the ( single ) radial distance of the source of the excess ; these distances",
    "are reported in table  [ excesstable ] . because the temperatures we use are the maximum temperatures , the distances derived in this way are _ minimum _ distances .",
    "this logic of assigning a single distance to the dust , based on the combined stellar luminosity , is obviously the simplest possible model .",
    "many more complex geometries and solutions are possible ; we discuss some of these in section  [ unc_dust ] .",
    "the fractional luminosity of a dusty debris disk is the ratio of the integrated luminosity of the emission by the dust to the integrated luminosity of the host star(s ) .",
    "the former is the blackbody fit to the excess(es ) , as described above , and the latter is the best - fit kurucz model described in section  [ modeling ] .",
    "the fractional luminosity can be understood visually from the seds shown in figure  [ sedfig ] .",
    "we derive fractional luminosities for each system ; because we fit maximum temperatures to the infrared excesses , the derived fractional luminosities are also maximum values .",
    "we explore in section  [ mindust ] the impact of the `` minimum '' temperature alternate assumption on fractional luminosity .",
    "we list the derived fractional luminosities for all 22  systems with formal excesses in table  [ excesstable ] ; these fractional luminosities are plotted in figure  [ acrit ] .",
    "systems with excesses at 24  generally have large fractional luminosities because the dust temperatures are warm .",
    "this can be seen in table  [ excesstable ] , where the largest fractional luminosity is for hd  83808 , the system with the highest excess temperature .",
    "we discuss the details of that system in the following section .",
    "our fractional luminosities are mostly in the range @xmath3 to @xmath24 ( table  [ excesstable ] and figure  [ acrit ] ) .",
    "this range is consistent with values found by other surveys of debris disks around `` old '' stars ( as described in section  [ comparison ] ) .",
    "we show in figure  [ acrit ] fractional luminosity as a function of dust distance in units of binary separation ; there is no obvious trend .",
    "there is an apparent limit near @xmath3 , which is approximately the mips detection threshold ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    our observations at 24  and 70   place no constraints on colder ( @xmath730  k ) disk components .",
    "our 13  submillimeter upper limits preclude the existence of very massive cold disks but place no useful constraints on modest ( fractional luminosity @xmath710@xmath25 ) cold disks .",
    "although we refer to the fractional luminosity values we derive as maximum values , it is worth noting that a cold , massive disk component could exist for almost all systems in our sample .",
    "this putative cold disk could imply a larger fractional luminosity than the `` maximum '' values that we report here .",
    "we show six systems of particular interest in figure  [ sedfig ] , and discuss them here . these systems present the most interesting and illustrative cases for sed fitting .",
    "an additional 13  systems of note are discussed in appendix  [ notes ] .",
    "* hd  13161 , hd  51199 , and hd  16628 .",
    "* these three systems all have formal excesses at both 24  and 70  ( figure  [ sedfig ] ) .",
    "we therefore have a very good measurement of the color temperature of the excess .",
    "hd  13161 was identified as vega - like  meaning likely possessing a debris disk  by @xcite as well as a number of later workers , based on iras fluxes .",
    "hd  51199 has a relatively strong excess at 24  and a relatively weak excess at 70  , implying a somewhat high dust temperature of 188  k. the 70  flux for hd  16628 is more than five times brighter than the expected photospheric flux .",
    "* hd  83808 . * hd  83808 also has formal excesses at both bands ( figure  [ sedfig ] ) .",
    "this two - band fit gives an excess temperature of 815  k ; comparable excesses at 24  and 70  ( 23% and 30% , respectively ) indicate that the excess color is only slightly redder than the star(s ) , implying a relatively high excess temperature .    because this temperature is quite high compared to a typical dust disk result in this program , we use iras measurements for a consistency check .",
    "the color - corrected iras fluxes are 3500 , 800 , and 130  mjy at 12 , 25 , and 60  , respectively ; this implies 24  and 70  fluxes of 870  and 96  mjy , respectively ( after scaling by @xmath26 ) .",
    "( we note that the iras 60  measurement formally has quality flag 1 , meaning an upper limit , but the measurement is consistent with our higher s / n observation . ) our 24  and 70  measurements of 822  and 94  mjy , respectively , match the iras data quite well .",
    "we can extrapolate our 24  measurement to 12  ( again scaling by @xmath26 ) , and get 3500  mjy , again matching the iras measurement .",
    "we conclude that the iras data are consistent with our measurements .",
    "now we look again at the iras data for confirmation of our excess temperature .",

    "this dust may be observed at its generation location .",
    "for both the circumbinary and circumstellar cases , the simplest explanation is the presence of a planetesimal belt near the distance that we derive .",
    "we ignore the possibility of dust produced from parent bodies that reside in the unstable region , as the lifetimes of those parent bodies in the unstable regions are prohibitively short @xcite .",
    "however , dust can move radially due to radiation pressure or poynting - robertson effect , and therefore can have a very different emission temperature than it had in its generation location ( its asteroid belt ) .",
    "( in fact , the @xcite calculations for stability do not apply for dust , but do apply to the dust parent bodies . )",
    "this may be the explanation for dust in unstable regions in the hd  46273 , hd  80671 , and hd  127726 systems , as described in the following section .",
    "dust in an unstable location could be migrating inward ( under pr drag ) from a larger radius ( and potentially circumbinary disk ) , or could be migrating outward ( via radiation pressure ) from a smaller radius and a circumstellar disk ( figure  [ schematic ] ) .",
    "the parameter @xmath32 is often used to examine radial migration of dust grains .",
    "it expresses the ratio of radiation to gravity forces on an individual dust grain : @xmath33 , where @xmath20 and @xmath34 are the stellar luminosity and mass ; @xmath35 is the speed of light ; @xmath36 is the radiation pressure coefficient ( we use @xmath37 , after * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; and @xmath38 and @xmath39 are the density and radius of the spherical grain , with all values in cgs units .",
    "grains that have @xmath40 generally spiral inward under poynting - robertson ( pr ) drag ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "@xmath32 values greater than  0.5 correspond to dust particles that are blown out of the system by radiation pressure .",
    "a critical size can be derived , where spherical , solid particles larger than that size spiral inward under pr drag . for a5  stars ,",
    "the critical size is @xmath75  ; for f5  stars , the critical size is @xmath72  .",
    "of course , the picture is somewhat more complicated when there are two stars in the system since both radiation and gravity increase ; furthermore , a particle may not see a simple radial radiation pattern as from a single central source .",
    "( we revisit these complications below . )",
    "particles also need not be solid spheres in reality .",
    "we have assumed black body grains , where the particles are larger than the wavelengths of interest .",
    "thus , the infrared excesses that we observe are generally emitted by dust grains larger than the critical size of around 5  or so .",
    "such large grains are plausible in debris systems , although we consider the case of small grains in section  [ nonbb ] .",
    "these grains should therefore be spiraling inward under pr drag , suggesting exterior production zones .    as a further argument",
    ", our temperature ( and distance ) derivations solve for the maximum temperature allowed by the data ; in other words , there can be no significant population of dust interior to the distances that we derive . yet ,",
    "if the dust were migrating outward from an interior source , there would necessarily be a population of dust that would be warmer and at smaller distances than the observed dust location .",
    "dust closer to the star(s ) and warmer would have been detectable by us , yet r24 for these two systems is within 3% of unity . for these systems ,",
    "the dust therefore _ can not _ originate in an interior source region , as we would have detected it at 24  .",
    "these arguments are consistent with our results that the most common configuration of dust in binary systems is in stable circumbinary regions . in 12  cases ( out of 22  total ) , dust is created and observed in circumbinary locations . in an additional two systems , we suggest , dust is created in circumbinary locations and migrates inward under pr drag to an unstable location where we observe it ( figure  [ schematic ] ) .",
    "@xcite and others have suggested that in debris disks with large enough optical depth to be observable , pr drag should _ never _ dominate ; instead , removal of grains that are big enough to be in the pr ( as opposed to radiation pressure ) regime will instead be dominated by collisional processes .",
    "( note that in the solar system , whose fractional luminosity is perhaps a factor of @xmath7100  less than those for typical _ spitzer_-discovered debris disks , pr drag can be a dominant source of grain removal ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "indeed , @xcite provide observational evidence that iras discovered debris disks are dominated by collisions and not pr drag . in the planetesimal belt where the dust we observe is originally produced , it may be true that the space density of grains is high enough that collisions dominate .",
    "we calculate that @xmath41 , defined by @xcite as the ratio of pr migration timescale to collisional disruption timescale , is generally close to but slightly larger than unity for the disks detected in this program ( @xmath42 means collisions dominate ; @xmath43 means pr dominates ) .",
    "this implies that most grains of the size of interest collide with other grains before they migrate inward a significant distance , but also implies that some grains may migrate inward under pr drag without experiencing any collisions .",
    "furthermore , the belt where collisions are taking place must have an inner edge that is defined by the binary s dynamical interactions .",
    "grains that leak inward across this boundary may suddenly be in a region that is devoid of solid material , since no planetesimals would be in stable orbits there . in this `` empty '' region",
    ", few collisions would take place and little dust would exist , other than dust migrating inward under pr drag .",
    "pr effects would dominate since the surface density of grains would be relatively small , implying that collisions can not be a significant loss mechanism .",
    "this may be the dust that we observe in radiative equilibrium with the binary stars .",

    "further study may help reveal the nature of this interesting system .",
    "we note that all three systems with dust in unstable locations are multiple ( higher than binary ) systems . as argued above , this multiplicity may complicate the radiation field sufficiently that the dust has a temperature that masks its true location in a stable location .",

    "it is unlikely that a location that is unstable in a binary system would be stable in a multiple system , barring unusual resonant configurations .",
    "finally , for these systems ( and others in our sample ) there could be multiple reservoirs of dust , each having different temperatures and located in a stable location in the system , that together masquerade as a dust population with the single temperature that we derive from a 1  or 2  band excess .",
    "our observations at 24  and 70  are generally sensitive to dust temperatures around 50150  k , which are found at distances of 1030  au around a  and f  stars . since dust is more likely to be found in stable regions of binary systems than in unstable regions ( from dynamical arguments ) , we are less likely to detect excess emission from binary systems with separations of 1030  au than from those with either smaller or larger separations .",

    "we conclude that the stability arguments of @xcite must apply generally to dust in binary systems .",
    "we note that this distribution of excess as a function of binary separation is consistent with the result of @xcite .",
    "the complement of this argument is that we are more likely to detect dust in unstable zones for intermediate separation systems than for either small or large separation systems , for the same reason : dust at 50150  k that is unstable is more likely to be found in intermediate systems ( by the holman & wiegert arguments ) than in either small or large separation systems .",
    "we find this result as well ( figure  [ acrit ] ) : all three systems with dust in the unstable region are binaries with intermediate separations , as expected .",
    "a primary conclusion from this study is that debris disks exist in binary systems .",
    "planetesimal formation clearly is not inhibited to any great degree by the presence of a second star in the system .",

    "stochastic or random processes may dominate the production of dust ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and not the gradual diminishing of an initial disk reservoir",
    ". however , a continuous collisional cascade over the lifetime of the system remains a possible explanation .",
    "the excess rate we find for binary systems is marginally higher than that for individual ( single ) stars ( section  [ context ] ) .",
    "one possibility is that multiple stellar systems may begin with circumstellar / circumbinary disks that are more massive than those surrounding single stars  the nature argument .",
    "hence , multiple stellar systems are more likely  from birth  than individual stars to possess planetesimal disks and planetary systems , and therefore excess emission that we can detect .",
    "alternately , multiple stellar systems may begin with circumstellar / circumbinary disks that are similar to or diminished relative to disks around individual stars .",
    "the multiple stars may then interact in ways that could cause planetesimal growth ( and subsequent dust production ) : the two ( or more ) stars present in the system can stir up the circumbinary ( or circumstellar ) disk , causing orbits to cross and generally creating an environment in which accumulation of solid material in a protoplanetary disk is favored .",
    "this is the nurture argument , that multiple systems create environments where planetary systems may be more likely to form @xcite .",
    "we note that this nurture model may have a significant backlash .",
    "enhanced dynamical stirring could equally be the downfall of planet formation if protoplanetary disk material is excited sufficiently that collisions are erosive rather than accumulative .",

    "determining which of nature and nurture is more important in planetesimal formation in multiple systems will require detailed studies of the youngest multiple systems ( e.g. , the results presented in @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "further disk studies of an ensemble of young binary ( or higher ) systems will allow us to understand the initial conditions that lead to the properties of the sample presented here .",
    "particles in the unstable zone have their orbits disrupted in @xmath9@xmath31  orbits of the binary system @xcite .",
    "the orbital periods for hd  46273 , hd  80671 , and hd  127726 are all less than 100  years , so the dust should be removed in less than 1  million years in all cases .",
    "the pr crossing time @xmath44 is given approximately by @xmath45 , where @xmath44 is in years ; @xmath46 is the radial distance to be crossed , in au ; @xmath34 is in solar masses ; and @xmath32 is as defined above @xcite .",
    "the unstable zone extends approximately from 0.3  to 3  times the binary separation , so we set @xmath46 equal to 2.7  times the binary separation .",
    "the pr crossing times , which are the maximum residence times of dust in the unstable zone , are therefore also around 1  million years for these systems .",
    "these facts together imply that the dust residing in these unstable regions is very short - lived and that we are witnessing either the migrating tail of a continuous cascade , or the result of a very recent collisional event ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . with a few assumptions , we may be able to suggest which of these is more likely .",
    "for these three infrared excess systems , the residence time of dust against loss mechanisms is around @xmath47  years and the typical fractional luminosity is around @xmath3 . for the purposes of this exercise ,",
    "we assume 10  dust grains located 10  au from a parent star . in this case , approximately @xmath48  grains are required ( at low optical depth ) to absorb and re - radiate the appropriate amount of emission from the parent star . for a density of 1  g/@xmath49 , this population of grains has a mass of @xmath74@xmath50  g. for a residence time of @xmath51  years , this implies a grain production rate on the order of @xmath52  g / s , similar to that measured for comet hale - bopp @xcite .",
    "this is a small enough production rate that none of continuous collisional cascade ; stochastic collisions ; or individual sources ( e.g. , comets ) can be ruled out .",
    "the ages for the two systems with dust in unstable locations are 12  billion years .",
    "over 1  billion years , the total mass of 10  dust grains produced under a continuous collisional cascade would be around @xmath53  g or @xmath54  @xmath55 , which implies the efficient disintegration of @xmath71000  hundred - km asteroids .",
    "if the 10  grains are the tail of a size distribution that follows a power law that goes as size@xmath56 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the total mass may be 10100  times greater ; a shallower slope ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) gives an even larger enhancement . in our solar system , there are fewer than 400  asteroids larger than 100  km . over the age of the solar system ,",
    "the number of 100  km asteroids in the asteroid belt may have decreased by only a factor of 510 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . our solar system s asteroid belt could therefore not be the source of a continuous dust production of the magnitude that is presently observed for these two systems .",
    "the implication may be that the present dust production rate can not have been continuous over the lifetime of the system .",
    "although other interpretations are possible , this rough calculation implies that the dust that we observe in these systems was likely produced in a recent event , and that stochastic ( occasional ) collisions may dominate the dust production in these systems on billion - year timescales .",
    "several alternate interpretations can explain the observations and dynamical stability constraints . recall that the dust temperatures presented in table  [ excesstable ] and elsewhere are the maximum temperatures allowed by the multi - wavelength observations ( with the two exceptions described above and noted in table  [ excesstable ] ; these exceptions are addressed below ) .",
    "in general , this is the most rigorous and most useful statement that can be made , but cooler temperatures might equally well fit the data and imply greater orbital distances , with implications for the implied stability .    to explore the consequences of abandoning our maximum temperature requirement , we recalculated dust location and fractional luminosity for systems with only 70  excesses assuming that all the dust has a `` minimum reasonable temperature '' of 50  k , a value that is consistent with the smallest excess temperatures found by @xcite .",
    "( note that this is not truly the absolute minimum possible , since an undetectable population of very cold dust can not be ruled out for any system . ) in all cases 50  k is consistent with a physical model that can match the observations , and corresponds roughly to a 24  excess that is @xmath71% of the photospheric emission .",
    "generally , the dust location increases somewhat in radius and the fractional luminosity decreases by up to a factor of  10 .",
    "these alternate ( minimum ) solutions are shown in figure  [ acrit ] as the ends of the `` tails '' extending from the data points .",
    "the locus of acceptable solutions for each system lies along this tail , with the maximum temperature solution at one end ( indicated by the symbol ) and the minimum temperature solution at the other end .",
    "alternate solutions , with different temperatures , could potentially move systems into or out of the unstable zone , and in all cases include a move to lower fractional luminosities .    for the two systems where the best temperature solutions are lower limits ( hd  118216 and hd  16920 ) ,",
    "the `` tails '' indicate that warmer temperatures ( that is , smaller dust distances ) are possible solutions . in each case",
    ", assumptions were needed to calculate the range of acceptable temperatures ( section  [ interest ] ) ; because of these extra assumptions , these tails are shown as dashed lines .",
    "we have assumed black body dust grains for all analysis and discussion above , but non - black body dust grains ( generally those with small sizes ) offer a possible alternative interpretation .",
    "non - black body grain thermal equilibrium temperatures are hotter than those of black body - like grains at the same distance from the star ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* and figure  9 therein ) . therefore , in matching a derived temperature , non - black body grains would imply a greater distance from the star(s ) than the black body grain solutions discussed above .",
    "under mie theory , the dust distance ( in centimeters ) is given by @xmath57 where @xmath22 is the stellar radius ( in centimeters ) , and where the grain temperatures are those derived in section  [ dustdist ] .",
    "calculating dust distances under this small - grain assumption moves all systems rightward in figure  [ acrit ] , and moves some systems from the circumstellar region to the unstable region , and some from the unstable region to the circumbinary region .",
    "however , the total number of systems in the unstable region is unchanged : even under this small - grain assumption , there still exist populations of grains in unstable regions .",
    "smaller grains might also have @xmath58 .",
    "this means that grains might be spiraling outward under radiation pressure .",
    "it would still be difficult to explain any dust that remains in the unstable zone , since there is no evidence for hotter interior reservoirs of dust , as explained above .",
    "a more difficult case would arise if the grain properties vary significantly from system to system .",
    "we leave a more complete exploration of these effects for future work as the number of free parameters is large enough that useful constraints may not be easily obtained .      a final uncertainty on our calculations of grain temperatures is related to the geometry of the systems .",
    "we have implicitly assumed that all radiation fields are purely radial , and that all flux comes from a single source , either as a combined close binary or a single star whose companion is far away . for the two systems where the implied dust distances are comparable to the binary separations  that is , for systems where the dust appears to be in the unstable region  neither assumption is likely to be true .",
    "more sophisticated modeling that considers the specific geometry of a given system would be appropriate in those cases .",
    "there are a number of other potential geometries .",
    "we have assumed in all cases that any circumstellar dust must be located around the primary , whose spectral type is known , but of course dust in a binary system could equally be around either the primary or the secondary . a more complicated geometry would allow for circumsecondary dust , but a luminosity ratio for which the primary significantly heats the dust as well ; such a construction could even masquerade as a dust population located in the unstable zone .    following from the previous discussion , there is potentially substantial uncertainty in the dust location for any given system . even for systems with excesses at both wavelengths ,",
    "the possibility of non - black body grains could allow for a substantial change in dust distance .",
    "there is little to be done to explore the consequences of these uncertainties as we have no more than two excess measurements for any system .",
    "further observations at different wavelengths , and especially including low resolution spectra that would allow us to map the sed at much higher resolution than broadband photometry permits , are necessary to break some of these degeneracies and remove uncertainties ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* and figure  13 therein ) .",
    "spatially resolved images at multiple wavelengths would also help break these degeneracies .",
    "finally , we model all dust populations as single populations at a single location . for the four systems with excesses at both bands",
    ", there exists the possibility that dust could instead reside in two separate reservoirs : a hot dust population near one of the stars and a cold(er ) circumbinary dust population .",
    "the small number of data points does not warrant further calculations of this possibility , but we mention it against the possibility of future data that may help constrain the location of the dust in that system . for the three systems with dust apparently in unstable locations , having multiple dust populations in different ( stable ) locations could masquerade as a single population in an unstable location .      in some cases , the separations listed in table  [ targetinfo ] ( and table  [ excesstable ] ) are the projected separations , not the actual orbital distance .",
    "this is because some of these binary systems have not been monitored long enough or well enough to determine true orbits for the components . to calculate whether the dust we observe is in an unstable region",
    ", we use the separations in table  [ targetinfo ] , which lists the best information we have ( actual or projected separations ) . some of our determinations of dust in unstable regions , therefore , could in theory change categorizations if the separation information changed substantially .",
    "we suspect that this possibility would contribute only a minor effect overall as projected separations are not likely to differ from orbital separations by more than a factor of  @xmath72 in most cases .",
    "we also note that higher multiplicity ( beyond binarity ) may have an effect in the stability of planetesimal belts and the production of dust ( section  [ caveats ] ) .",
    "ages are known for most , but not all , of these 69  binary systems ( table  [ targetinfo ] ) .",
    "as it is now well established that larger excesses generally are found around younger stars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we look for possible effects of youth in our results .",
    "r24 and r70 as a function of age are shown in figure  [ ages ] for the 55  systems with known ages .",
    "one might expect that the younger systems would be more likely to have detectable excesses ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , since most systems with known ages in this program are older than 1  billion years , and all are older than around 600  million years ( with three exceptions , as indicated in table  [ targetinfo ] ) , these systems are all mature , so any age dependence might be expected to be minor .",
    "indeed , we find no obvious trend of excess with system age ( figure  [ ages ] ) , though we note that several of the systems with large excesses have no published ages and hence are not shown here ( see text for discussion ) ; we can not rule out the possibility that these systems with large excesses are young .",
    "there are 14  systems for which no published or calculated ages are available .",
    "however , we can classify ten of these systems as `` old '' or `` young , '' as follows ; since we are looking for possible effects of youth , this rough classification suffices .",
    "hd  83808 , hd  13161 ( a large excess system ) , hd  17094 , and hd  213235 are all more luminous than dwarf spectral classes , according to the gray & corbally technique ( see table  [ targetinfo ] and appendix  a ) .",
    "these systems ( or at least the primary stars ) are therefore likely at the old end of their main sequence lifetimes ( and have started to evolve off the main sequence ) .",
    "hd  137909 is part of an extensive study by @xcite , who put it on the hr diagram and find it to be well above the zams , implying that this system is old .",
    "these systems are labeled `` old '' in table  [ targetinfo ] , indicating that excesses around hd  83808 , hd  13161 , and hd  17094 can not be due to youth effects .",
    "hd  127726 ( 70  excess ) and hd  50635 ( no excesses ) were both detected by rosat @xcite .",
    "both stars have spectral types f0v , which may be too early for chromospheric activity , so a likely scenario is the presence of an active late - type dwarf companion .",
    "this argues for youth for these systems , but is not a strong constraint , since the main sequence lifetimes of late - type dwarfs are much longer than those for f0 main sequence stars .",
    "we label both hd  127726 and hd  50635 `` young '' in table  [ targetinfo ] . indeed , @xcite estimate a chromospheric age of 300  myr for hd  50635 based on ca ii h and k measurements of the secondary .",
    "however , strmgren photometry @xcite of the hd  50635 primary alone is available ( due to the system s relatively wide separation ) , and suggests an age of 990  myr ( using the @xcite grid of stellar parameters ) , indicating that our designation of `` young '' for this system has substantial uncertainty .",
    "hd  61497 , like hd  50635 , is widely enough separated that the primary alone can be identified in strmgren photometry @xcite . again using the @xcite grid of stellar parameters",
    ", we estimate an age of 520  myr for this system , and we therefore label it `` young '' ( following our definitions of `` young '' and `` old '' in section  [ context ] ) .    finally , we use the @xmath59 values presented in table  [ targetinfo ] to conclude that hd  72462 is old and that hd  6767 is young , based on their low and high gravities , respectively .",
    "hd  61497 also apparently has a low gravity , but because of the poor fit in the gray & corbally technique we defer to the strmgren photometry technique described above .",
    "four systems remain with no age estimates .",
    "hd  95698 ( the system with the largest excess at 70  , with r70  =  25.56 ) and hd  77190 have @xmath59 between 3.8  and  4 , which is inconclusive for determining ages .",
    "we have no @xmath59 measurements for hd  16628 and hd  173608 .",
    "of the four `` young '' systems and three systems identified as young by i.  song ( pers .  comm . ) , only hd  127726 has an excess . of the four systems with no age estimates , three have excesses , including hd  95698 ,",
    "whose r70 value is reminiscent of a young system ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "results from these subsamples are obviously hampered by small number statistics , but the excess rates are not too different from those measured by @xcite for young a  stars , but are also not too different from the overall excess rates for this binary sample .",
    "furthermore , removing these eight systems ( four `` young '' plus four with no age estimates ) from our binaries sample does not significantly change the observed frequency of disks at either 24  or 70  .",
    "we therefore conclude that there is no overall bias due to young systems in our results .",
    "@xcite and others have recently used _ spitzer _ to study the fraction of afgk stars with debris disks ; most of the targets in those samples are in non - multiple systems .",
    "disentangling age effects from spectral type is difficult , but our excess fraction results can be roughly placed in context as follows .",
    "a primary conclusion of many of those previous studies is that age is the dominant factor in determining excess fraction ( the number of systems with excesses ) : the excess fraction decreases with increasing age .",
    "therefore , to place our binary debris disk results in context with results from non - binary systems , we need to compare to populations of similar age .",
    "since all but three of the systems with known ages in our sample are older than 600  myr , we use that criterion here .",
    "the relevant comparisons are to the overall excess rates for `` old '' a  and f  stars ( the latter of which we summarize here as fgk  stars as there are no published results for a large sample of just f  stars ) , where `` old '' is defined as @xmath4600  myr . at 24  ,",
    "the excess rates for old a  and fgk  stars are around 7% and 1% , respectively . after discarding the 11  systems ( see above ) in our sample that either have ages less than 600  myr ( three systems ) ; are `` young '' ( four systems ) ; or have no age estimates ( four systems ) , our excess rate is 9@xmath60% , marginally higher than the results for single afgk stars ( and perhaps significantly higher than the results for fgk stars ) . at 70  , the excess rates for old a  and fgk  stars are 25% and 15% . our excess rate for the 42  old systems that were observed at 70  is 38@xmath617% , again marginally higher than the rate observed for single afgk stars ( and again perhaps significantly higher than the results for fgk stars ) .",
    "excess rates that are marginally higher than those for individual ( non - multiple ) afgk stars may argue that binary systems are more likely to have planetesimal belts than single stars .",
    "alternately , it may argue that planetesimal belts in binary systems are similar to those of single stars , but more likely to be in an excited ( i.e. , recently collided ) state .",
    "this is the nature / nurture argument about binary systems and planetesimal formation presented above .    around 45% of wide binary systems",
    "have debris disks ( figure  [ hist ] ) .",
    "the disks in these systems are generally very close to the primary ( assumed ) and far from the secondary .",
    "it might therefore be argued that the secondary has little to do with the presence or absence of disks in widely separated binaries , and with our data we can not eliminate the possibilities that disks exist around the secondaries in these systems , either instead of or in addition to disks around the primary .",
    "the excess rate might therefore be given as 20%25% per star for widely separated binary systems .",
    "this number is quite consistent with the excess rates measured in the surveys of single stars listed above .",
    "we make the above point about wide binaries in order to emphasize the fact that the excess rate for small separation binary systems is nearly 60% .",
    "these debris disks are circumbinary , so it is clear that the presence of the secondary star can not be ignored when considering the evolution of the debris disk .",
    "small separation binary systems must clearly , in some way , promote the presence of the kind of debris disk that we can detect .",
    "it would be an interesting further observational and theoretical study to understand why the detectable debris disk rate for small separation binaries is so much larger than that for single stars ( or for wide separation binaries per star ) .",
    "debris disks around a  stars typically have fractional luminosities around @xmath24 to @xmath3 , with only protoplanetary or intermediate - age disks substantially larger @xcite .",
    "the fractional luminosities of disks around old fgk stars are typically a few times 10@xmath25 .",
    "the typical fractional luminosities we report here are similar to the results for those two samples , as expected .",
    "we look for binary systems in the @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite samples to extend our results . by design , there are few binary systems in these samples , and there are only 8  binary systems total that are `` old '' ( @xmath4600  myr ) .",
    "of these  8 , only one , hd  33254 , has an excess at 70  , and none have excesses at 24  .",
    "if we aggregate these 8  systems with our sample , the excess rates at 24  and 70  go down slightly , to 9% and 36% , respectively .",
    "this result is still marginally high compared to the excess rates for old single afgk stars ; because of the small number of additional targets and detections , data on these 8  systems add little to our understanding of planetary system formation in binary systems .",
    "@xcite , in a preliminary result , found that 6  of 26  fgk stars with known extrasolar planets ( 23% ) show excess emission at 70  ( none of the 26  have excesses at 24  ) , a result that would be marginally different from field fgk stars without known planets .",
    "( stars with known extrasolar planets are generally `` old '' ; the vast majority of known extrasolar planets are on orbits comparable to or smaller than the binary orbits presented here .",
    ") however , @xcite and trilling et al .",
    "( in prep . ) , extending the work of @xcite , found that the excess rate enhancement for fgk stars with known planets is marginal at best .",
    "nevertheless , we note that both small separation binary systems ( from this work ) and planet - bearing systems @xcite may be ( more ) likely to have debris disks ( though with a fair amount of uncertainty for the results for both populations ) .",
    "the mechanism(s ) for planet formation may be very different from those of binary star formation , but broadly speaking both are binary ( or multiple ) systems , perhaps suggesting a commonality of properties . again , further observations will be necessary to probe this possible connection .",
    "we observed 69 main sequence a3-f8 binary star systems at 24  , and a subset of 53  systems at 70  , to look for excess emission that could suggest dust grains and , ultimately , planetesimals and planetary systems .",
    "we detected excess emission ( observed fluxes greater than predicted photospheric emission by at least 3@xmath10 ) from 9@xmath0% of our sample at 24  and 40@xmath1% of our sample at 70  .",
    "four systems show significant excess at both wavelengths .",
    "we interpret this excess emission as arising from dust grains in the binary systems , leading to our first main conclusion : _ binary systems have debris disks_. the incidence of debris disks is around 50% for binary systems with small ( @xmath23  au ) and with large ( @xmath450  au ) separations .    for systems with excess emission , we compute or constrain the dust temperature , assuming blackbody emission , and use that temperature to model the location of the dust within the system .",
    "dynamical stability arguments suggest that in more than half of the cases with detected excesses the dust is probably circumbinary ; that another third of the sample of systems with known excesses have circumstellar dust ; and that , in our second main conclusion , _ three multiple systems have dust in dynamically unstable locations .",
    "_ this situation likely arises when dust produced by collisions in a circumbinary disk migrates inward under poynting - robertson ( pr ) drag to its presently observed location .",
    "the dust residence times in the unstable regions are less than 1  million years against both dynamical effects and poynting - robertson drag , implying that we are witnessing either the migrating tail of a continuous cascade , or the result of a recent collisional event . for two of the three systems with dust in unstable locations , there is no obvious location in the system where a stable reservoir of precursor asteroids could reside .",
    "our third main conclusion is that _ the overall excess rate that we measure is marginally higher than that of individual ( single ) old ( @xmath4600  myr ) afgk stars . _",
    "binary star systems are therefore at least as likely as single stars to possess debris disks and , by implication , planetesimal populations .",
    "planetesimal formation may have proceeded because of the nature of the system if the processes that form multiple stellar systems also produce environments conducive to the accumulation of small bodies .",
    "alternately , planetesimal and planetary system formation may take place in multiple star systems if the stars themselves create a dynamical environment that promotes accumulation of planetesimals  the nurture argument . a twist on the latter model",
    "is that extreme dynamical stirring in multiple systems may delay or preclude the formation of big bodies when collisions become erosive .",
    "our fourth main conclusion is that _ the excess rate ( fraction of systems with excesses ) for small separation ( @xmath23  au ) binaries is quite high , at nearly 60%_. either the processes that form small separation binaries must also commonly form debris disks ( the nature argument ) , or else small separation binaries evolve in a way that is likely to produce debris disks that we can observe ( the nurture argument ) .    around 30% of known extrasolar planets",
    "are found in widely separated binary systems , and the recent discovery @xcite of an extrasolar planet in a tight triple system further indicates that stellar multiplicity does not preclude planet formation . we have found that dust production and the implied presence of planetesimals is at least as common in binary systems as it is for individual stars . determining which of nature and nurture is more important in planetesimal formation in multiple systems requires detailed studies of the youngest multiple systems to track the creation of planetesimal belts .",

    "additional details of this photometry are given in table  [ photom ] and section  [ spitzer ] .",
    "we derive a best - fit kurucz model by fitting all available optical to near infrared photometry ( johnson @xmath62 photometry [ jp11 , @xcite ] , strmgren @xmath63 photometry @xcite , hipparcos tycho @xmath64 photometry @xcite , 2mass @xmath65 photometry @xcite ) based on a @xmath66 goodness of fit test .",

    "the technique used to derive the gray & corbally parameters presented in table  [ targetinfo ] is identical to that reported in @xcite and @xcite ; here we briefly summarize that technique .",
    "classification - resolution spectra ( 1.83.5   ) were obtained with the dark sky observatory ( dso ) 0.8-meter telescope of appalachian state university , the ctio 1.5-meter telescope , and the 2.3-meter bok telescope of steward observatory ( so ) .",

    "( our 73.65@xmath736.83  mjy compared to their 56.1  mjy ) , though they probably agree at a @xmath72@xmath10  level .",
    "our re - reduction of their ( independent ) data ( from the _ spitzer _ archive ) gives 24  and 70  values quite close to our values in table  [ photom ] , so the discrepancy may have its root in differences in data reduction and photometric calibration ( the updated calibration factor we use contributes a small factor ( 5% ) in the correct direction ) . our calculated dust temperature of 81  k is higher than their 40  k , and consequently our fractional luminosity of @xmath74 , under the maximum temperature assumption , is higher than their estimate of @xmath75 .",
    "* hd  99211 . * hd  99211 was identified as vega - like by @xcite , meaning it possesses an infrared excess that is likely attributable to a dusty debris disk .",
    "we also find excess emission from this system at 70  but not 24  .",
    "* hd  95698 , hd  20320 , hd  217792 , hd  88215 .",
    "* these four systems all have formal excesses at 70  .",
    "formally , none of them have excesses at 24  , but in all cases r24 nearly exceeds the threshold value of  1.15 and @xmath72 exceeds the significance threshold of  2.0 .",
    "consequently , for these four systems , it is likely that we detect excess emission at 24  , though not at a significant level , and we consequently treat these systems as having single band excess detections . for these systems , we compute dust temperatures and related quantities as described above , using the measured 70  flux and the predicted 24  photosphere , plus three times the relevant error . in all cases ,",
    "this prediction+3@xmath10 value is consistent with the observed 24  flux .    *",
    "hd  26690 , hd  31925 , hd  200499 , hd  51733 .",
    "* hd  26690 has r24 below but near the threshold ; @xmath72 above the threshold ; r70 near unity ; and @xmath28 near zero .",
    "this system could have an excess that is seen only at 24  , making it similar to hd  16920 , above .",
    "hd  31925 has r70 just below the threshold and @xmath28 above the threshold and no signs of excess emission at 24  .",
    "this system therefore may have a small 70  excess that is not formally detected by us .",
    "hd  200499 and hd  51733 both have r24 below but near the threshold ; @xmath72 above the threshold ; r70 above the threshold ; and @xmath28 below the threshold . the interpretation of this excess pattern is unclear , but may suggest a weak excess at both bands .    *",
    "hd  99028 , hd  29140 , hd  80671 , and other triple systems . *",
    "hd  99028 is a triple system , with inner orbital distance of 1.9  au @xcite and outer orbital radius @xmath720  au @xcite . as discussed in section  [ unstable ] , these two orbits allow essentially no intermediate dynamically stable regions , and the only stable zone in this system would be far outside the outer orbit .",
    "it may not be surprising , in this case , that no excesses are observed in this system .",
    "we list the outer orbit in table  [ targetinfo ] .",
    "the sb9 catalog @xcite lists two periods for hd  29140 , 1350  d and 3.6  d ( corresponding to orbital distances @xmath70.04  au and @xmath73  au ) , likely indicating that this system is triple . the intermediate stability zone in this system",
    "must also be quite small , though orbits outside of @xmath710  au may be stable .",
    "we list both orbits in table  [ targetinfo ] , but the outer orbit may be more important in determining stable regions in that system .",
    "the complications arising from studying dust in binary systems clearly are magnified for triple systems ( section  [ caveats ] ) .",
    "a number of other systems in our sample likely have additional system members ( known or unknown ) .",
    "the regions of dynamical stability  if any  in triple and higher systems are no doubt much more complicated than in binary systems .",
    "it may be that excess emission is less likely for higher multiplicity due to increased dynamical interactions .",
    "however , we note that all three systems with dust in unstable locations are found in multiple ( triple or higher ) systems : excesses and dust are clearly not prohibited .",
