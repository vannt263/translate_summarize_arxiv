    "is then performed in section [ sec : pheno ] .",
    "we then turn to the question , whether different models ( or decompositions ) can actually be distinguished at the lhc , if a positive signal were found in the future .",
    "we discuss two types of observables , which allow to do so .",
    "first , in section [ subsec : ca ] we discuss the `` charge asymmetry '' , i.e. the ratio of the number of positron - like to electron - like dilepton ( plus jets ) events .",
    "we then turn to the discussion of invariant mass peaks in [ subsec : mp ] . a joint analysis of charge asymmetry and invariant mass peaks",
    "would allow to identify the dominant contribution to double beta decay .",
    "finally , we close with a short summary of our main results .",
    "in order to be able to compare the sensitivities of the lhc and @xmath0 decay experiments input from both particle and nuclear physics is needed . in this section",
    "we will briefly recapitulate the main results of two papers @xcite , which we will use in the later parts of this work . in @xcite a general decomposition of the d=9 @xmath0 decay operator",
    "was given .",
    "this work allows to identify all possible contributions to @xmath0 decay from the particle physics point of view .",
    "moreover , it makes contact with the general lorentz - invariant parametrization of the @xmath0 deay rate of @xcite .",
    "these latter papers developed a general formalism and gave numerical values for nuclear matrix elements , which allow to calculate the expected @xmath0 decay half - lives for any particle physics model .",

    "external lines are fermions ; internal lines can be fermions ( solid ) , scalars ( dashed ) or vectors instead of scalars ( not shown ) . for t - i",
    "there are in total 3 possibilities classified as : sfs , vfs and vfv .",
    "_ ]    we start by recalling that there are only two basic topologies which can generate the double beta decay operator at tree - level .",
    "these are shown in fig .",
    "( [ fig:0nbbtopologies ] ) , for brevity we will call them t - i and t - ii in the following . while all outer particles in these diagrams are fermions , internal particles can be scalars , fermions or vectors . for topology - i",
    "( t - i ) all three possible combinations ( sfs , sfv and vfv ) can lead to models , which give sizeable contributions to @xmath0 decay .",
    "note that , for t - ii one derivative coupling ( cases vvv and svv ) or one dimensionful vertex ( cases sss and vvs ) is needed .",
    "we plan to deal with t - ii , which requires a slightly more complicated analysis , in a future publication @xcite .",
    "._[tab : topoi ] general decomposition of the @xmath29 operator @xmath31 for topology  i. the chirality of outer fermions is left unspecified , thus the mediators are given with the charge @xmath32 of electromagnetic @xmath33 and that of colour @xmath34 .",
    "the symbols @xmath35 and @xmath36 denote scalars , @xmath37 and @xmath38 vectors , and @xmath39 a fermion .",
    "the table follows the recent paper @xcite , where more complete tables including chiralities can be found . _",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^ , < \" , ]     finally , table [ invmasslq ] shows combinations of invariant mass distributions in case the mass ordering is @xmath40 , for decompositions of @xmath0 decay with charge asymmetries that are `` @xmath41 and @xmath42 like '' , i.e. for single leptoquark production . here",
    ", it is assumed that events from @xmath43 production can be distingsuished from @xmath44 production .",
    "the table refers to the former .",
    "( note again , if @xmath45 , cases a = b can not be distinguished , leaving a degeneracy in the identification of the decomposition in that case . ) in case of events from @xmath44 production , the decay of the lq will lead to a peak in @xmath46 and the decay of @xmath39 to @xmath47 .",
    "note , however , that in case of @xmath43 production , the mass peak for @xmath48 is formed by a subsystem of `` @xmath49 '' ( which gives @xmath50 ) , whereas in @xmath44 production the two mass peaks must come from different leptons and jets , i.e. @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "this feature can be used to separate @xmath43 from @xmath44 production .    before closing , we briefly mention pair production of coloured fermions . here , a signal @xmath53 , i.e. at least four hard jets , would test the different decompositions of double beta decay .",
    "we note that decompositions with @xmath54 exist with a colour singlet fermion , for which pair production at the lhc is negligible , while for all the 12 `` new '' decompositions , see discussion in section [ sec : dec ] and section [ sect : xsect ] , pair production of the exotic fermions is expected to probe the existence of such states with masses up to roughly @xmath55 tev , depending on the final state branching ratios .",
    "note , that also pair produced @xmath39 can , depending on decomposition , produce in some cases like - sign dileptons . also , if a signal is found in @xmath53 , there is a threshold for these events at @xmath56 .",
    "different subsystems again form mass peaks at @xmath57 and in case , this fermion is heavier than ( one of ) the bosons mass peaks in sub - sub - systems will show up , providing additional information .",
    "the possible combinations can be straightforwardly derived from table [ tab : topoi ] .    in summary , we have discussed two possible observables , which allow to identify which of the decompositions of table [ tab : topoi ] is realized , if a positive lnv observation is made at the lhc .",
    "the combination of both observables should be sufficient to identify the correct decomposition unambigously , apart from the two pairs : ( a ) 1-ii - a and 1-ii - b and ( b ) 1-i and 3-i ( the latter only in the mass degenerate case ) , which can lead to very similar values in both observables .",
    "in this paper we have compared the discovery potential of lepton number violating signals at the lhc with the sensitivity of current and future neutrinoless double beta decay experiments , assuming that the decay rate is dominated by heavy @xmath58 ( tev ) particle exchange .",
    "we have treated the first of two possible topologies contributing to both processes which contains one fermion and two bosons in the intermediate state , and concentrated on the case where the fermion mass is always smaller than the scalar or vector masses .",
    "the topology considered corresponds to 18 possible decompositions including scalar , leptoquark and diquark mechanisms . with the exception of some leptoquark mechanisms a @xmath30 decay signal corresponding to a half life in the range @xmath59 yrs should imply a positive lnv signal at the lhc , and vice versa , the non - observation of a positive signal at the lhc would rule out a short - range mechanism for neutrinoless double beta decay in most cases . in summary",
    "the lhc search provides a complementary and in many cases even superior option to search for @xmath60 lepton number violation for this short range case .",
    "if @xmath30 decay is triggered by light sub - ev scale majorana neutrinos , on the other hand , its lhc analogue will be unobservable . in any case",
    "though an observation of either @xmath30 decay or its analogue at the lhc will prove also the light neutrinos to be majorana particles by virtue of the four loop contribution to the neutrino mass generation according to the schechter - valle thorem @xcite .",
    "however , this 4-loop - induced majorana mass while bestowing the light neutrinos with majorana - ness is too small to account for the mass squared differences observed in neutrino oscillations @xcite , implying that differently generated masses , either of dirac or of majorana type will be the dominant contributions for at least the heavier two mass eigenstates .",
    "moreover , we have discussed two possibilities to discriminate different contributions to the @xmath30 decay rate by using lhc observables : first , the charge asymmetry corresponding to the ratio of positive like sign electron events and negative like sign electron events , which reflects the larger abundance of @xmath61 quarks compared to @xmath62 quarks in the most simple cases but becomes a more complicated function of masses and couplings in the general case . for large masses of the resonantly produced particles this asymmetry can vary by up to 7 orders of magnitude . and second , the resonance peaks at the invariant mass distribution of the decay products of the heavy particles produced on - shell .",
    "the various resonance peaks depend on the mass ordering of the intermediate particles and on the exact decomposition and can then be used to identify the intermediate particles triggering the decay . consequently , if an lnv signal at the lhc would be found it should be possible to identify the dominant contribution of @xmath30 decay .",

    "<S> lepton number violation ( lnv ) mediated by short range operators can manifest itself in both neutrinoless double beta decay ( @xmath0 ) and in processes with same sign dilepton final states at the lhc . </S>",
    "<S> we derive limits from existing lhc data at @xmath1 tev and compare the discovery potential of the forthcoming @xmath2 tev phase of the lhc with the sensitivity of current and future @xmath0 decay experiments , assuming the short - range part of the @xmath0 decay amplitude dominates . </S>",
    "<S> we focus on the first of two possible topologies triggered by one fermion and two bosons in the intermediate state . in all cases , except for the pure leptoquark mechanism </S>",
    "<S> , the lhc will be more sensitive than @xmath0 decay in the future . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , we propose to search for a charge asymmetry in the final state leptons and to use different invariant mass peaks as a possibility to discriminate the various possible mechanisms for lnv signals at the lhc . </S>"
