    "at least until the advent of decisive data on cp  violation from the b sector , the k sector remains our main source of experimental information on this old and important question .",
    "further progress depends , however , not only on very high statistics experiments , but also on well tested effective theoretical models for handling long  range strong interactions in a quantitative way .    as in the 3generation quark model",
    "violation is thought to be due to a phase factor in the cabbibo  kobayashi ",
    "maskawa  matrix , any measurable first order effect ( , , direct",
    " cp  violation ) is expected to disappear if certain phase shifts from ( strong ) final state interactions ( f.s.i . ) between different components of transition amplitudes are vanishing . in an attempt to estimate",
    "the size of cp  violation effects in k@xmath6 decays @xcite it was found necessary not only to fit a number of coefficients determining the weak effective lagrangian from experimental data , but also to rely on loop calculations in deriving the f.s.i",
    "a further problem is that the strong interaction effects in k@xmath7 decays can not be handled ( like in k@xmath8 ) by just multiplying final ( strong ) eigenstates with constant phase factors ; imaginary parts from pion loops depend on dynamical variables , and the real parts are modified in turn by various loop contributions , among them loops with inner k lines .",
    "therefore the denotation as f.s.i .",
    "phases is not quite correct",
    ". it would be desirable to get more direct experimental information on these phases from existing experimental data on k decays , but this turns out to be very difficult , as we will explain below .    a well documented joint fit of isotopic k@xmath9 amplitudes has been given by devlin and dickey@xcite , and more recent work is published by kambor et al.@xcite .",
    "both groups of authors found it necessary to make assumptions on the f.s.i .",
    "phases in @xmath10 states , namely that they are zero , resp . @xmath11 .",
    "while general unitarity arguments lead us to agree with these expectations concerning the constant parts of the amplitudes , the situation may be more complex for the coefficients ( @xmath12 , see below ) of the non constant parts , which vanish at the center of the dalitz plot .    instead of repeating once more these fits , varying merely the data sets used and the parameter sets to be fitted",
    ", it may be more useful to investigate by simpler means which data are particularly important for our question , and to check their internal consistency and the appropriateness of the radiative corrections applied before the data can be used to fit isospin amplitudes . their effect is found to be very important for our investigation , and the standard procedure for handling them ( see @xcite ) may not be sufficient .    in the following sections , we first repeat the definitions and notations ( section 1 ) , discuss the internal consistency of slope parameters ( section 2 ) , introduce radiative corrections and demonstrate a method to recalculate slope parameters without reference to raw data from older experiments ( chapter 3 ) , and finally discuss the significance of future experiments ( chapter 4 ) .",
    "in order to fix the notation , we give a short account of relevant definitions for k@xmath6 decays connected to isospin relations .",
    "the kinematic ( dalitz plot ) variables used are @xmath13 @xmath14 we further use the three ( not independent ) variables @xmath15 for expansions about the center of the dalitz plot .",

    "@xmath30 final states are not present in @xmath31 decays , if we assume cp invariance ( @xmath32 for @xmath0 s - states ) .    due to the wigner - eckhart - theorem , we have to introduce only 3 independent form factors @xmath33 , whereby further restrictions are derived by expanding the amplitudes up to @xmath34 order and separating different symmetry classes in @xmath35 .    defining @xmath36 $ ] , etc .",

    ", the pdg values do not disagree significantly from those used here .",
    "while the @xmath73  values from the two @xmath80 decay experiments are in perfect agreement , the situation for the charged @xmath81  decays is less clear , due to the lower ( by one order of magnitude ) statistics in the @xmath82 channel . if we assume @xmath83 and take the @xmath73 value from the ( most significant ) @xmath84  experiment @xcite , we find linear relationships between @xmath85 and @xmath86 for all the other channels , as shown in fig.1 .",

    "the reason is that we have chosen purely local effective interactions without hadronic form factors , which would regularize these integrals . in our approach",
    "we renormalized them by the requirement that their contributions should disappear for transitions , in which the incoming charge reemerges as outgoing with the same velocity .",

    "their treatment would require a more complicated effective lagrangian , inclusion of structural photons etc .",
    ", and would be strongly model  dependent .    a second kind are so  called collinear singularities , appearing in the case of at least two charged particles with equal velocities in the final state , that means on the dalitz  plot boundary . in these points the perturbation expansion breaks down .",
    "accepting that some regions of the dalitz - plot are just not handled correctly by the theory , some caution in the treatment of experimental data near these singularities may be required .",
    "it can be shown that no infinities are encountered in integrals over kinematic regions ( integrability ) .",
