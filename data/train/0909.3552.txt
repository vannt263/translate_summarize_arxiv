    "in several recent experiments @xcite , low - temperature esr has been observed in some heavy - fermion metals , in particular yrh@xmath0si@xmath0 ( yrs ) @xcite .",
    "the phase diagram of yrs has a magnetic - field induced quantum critical point and is a model system for the study of quantum criticality in the kondo lattice .",
    "consequently , the observation of a narrow esr resonance in this compound aroused great interest , especially since it was commonly believed that heavy - fermion esr would be unobservable due to an enormous intrinsic linewidth @xmath6 of order @xmath7 yrs1 . here",
    "@xmath8 is the lattice coherence (  kondo \" ) temperature for the onset of heavy - fermion behavior and @xmath9 is the gyromagnetic ratio for the resonance .",
    "these were the first observations of esr in kondo lattice systems at @xmath10 .",
    "a common feature of the compounds in which esr has been observed appears to be the existence of ferromagnetic fluctuations @xcite these findings challenge our understanding of heavy fermion compounds : how does a sharp electron spin resonance emerge despite kondo screening and spin lattice relaxation , and why is this process influenced by ferromagnetic fluctuations ? in a recent paper ( aw \" ) @xcite , we discussed the background of these questions and answered them in the framework of fermi - liquid theory . an alternative explanation based on localized spins was subsequently proposed by schlottmann @xcite .",
    "the general derivation of fermi liquid theory from the microscopic theory for a two - band anderson lattice model has been given by yip @xcite    in yrs , the observed narrow dysonian @xcite esr line shape was originally interpreted @xcite as indicating that the resonance was due to local spins at the yb sites . therefore , initially the authors speculated that the narrow esr line might indicate the suppression of the kondo effect near the quantum critical point , since , as explained above , carrying over kondo impurity physics to the kondo lattice , one might expect the local spins to be screened by the kondo effect , giving rise only to a broad spin excitation peak , too wide to be observed in esr experiments .",
    "however , a closer look @xcite revealed that itinerant ( heavy ) electron esr could give rise to a similar line shape since the carrier diffusion in yrs is quite slow . thus , whether the resonance is that of localized or itinerant spins remained an open question .    in this paper , we extend our previous work @xcite to the non - fermi liquid ( nfl ) region of the yrs phase diagram and make a detailed comparison with the data .",
    "excellent agreement is obtained for the fermi - liquid ( fl ) regime . in particular , the ratio of the contributions @xmath11 and @xmath12 to the linewidth in the fl region is very well reproduced .",
    "in addition , we account for the anomalous behavior observed in the nfl region for the resonance line shift and the linewidth , one absolutely essential aspect of our theory is the lattice coherence of the quasiparticles in the anderson or kondo lattice model : it is this lattice coherence that is responsible for the absence in the lattice case of the strong local spin relaxation that is observed in single kondo impurity physics .",
    "attempts to account for the observed logarithmic temperature dependence of the lineshift as arising from single kondo ion physics above the kondo temperature are therefore problematic , since lattice coherence is lost in that case",
    "this was analyzed in sec .",
    "iii of aw .",
    "the hamiltonian of the simplest anderson lattice model , assuming momentum independent hybridization is given by @xmath13where @xmath14 @xmath15 is the conduction - electron energy spectrum and @xmath16 is its zeeman splitting ; @xmath17 are creation operators of the conduction electrons in momentum and spin eigenstates @xmath18 , and of electrons in the local @xmath3 level at site @xmath19 , respectively .",
    "the operator @xmath20 counts the number of electrons on the local level , and  @xmath21 . @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the hybridization amplitude and the coulomb interaction matrix element .",
    "we take the zeeman splittings @xmath24 and @xmath25 to be unequal , as they are in real materials .",
    "we consider the limit @xmath26 in the appendix .",
    "we now review the results for the dynamical spin susceptibility @xmath27 obtained in aw @xcite .",
    "we find a single resonance peak    @xmath28    where the resonance frequency is given by @xcite    @xmath29    here @xmath30 is the quasiparticle effective mass ratio .",

    ", we discuss the complete result , showing that even in the case of unequal @xmath4-factors there is only a single resonance peak .",
    "we also show that the residual fermi liquid interaction effects drop out of the resonance frequency .",

    "the numerical coefficient @xmath38 depends on the band structure and is of order unity . in the case of a sizeable ferromagnetic interaction , ( @xmath39 ) , @xmath40 the linewidth gets narrowed by a factor @xmath41 we suggest that this effect is responsible for the fact that so far an esr line has only been observed in compounds that exhibit signatures of ferromagnetic fluctuations .",
    "the magnetic response of yrs is strongly anisotropic , largely because of the single ion anisotropy .",
    "the zeeman hamiltonian of the @xmath3-electron ground state doublet of yb in tetragonal symmetry has the form @xmath42 , where the @xmath43-axis is along the crystallographic @xmath44-axis .",
    "the anisotropy of the @xmath4-factor is about a factor of @xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "we assume for the present that the anisotropy of the interaction is negligible .",
    "the hamiltonian is then diagonal in the coordinate system in the spin space that diagonalizes @xmath48 .",
    "the eigenvalues of @xmath48 are found as    @xmath49    where @xmath50 is the angle between the magnetic field @xmath51 and the @xmath44-axis .",
    "the above results , eq .  ( 2 ) , for the dynamical spin susceptibility @xmath27 obtained in @xcite for the isotropic model may then be generalized to the anisotropic model by replacing @xmath25 by @xmath52 and taking the tensor of spin susceptibility projected onto the direction of the static magnetic field . according to ref .",
    "@xcite , the angle dependence of the resonance frequency is well - represented by eq .",
    "this indicates that the anisotropic part of the residual fermi - liquid spin - exchange interaction is small . as we shall see later",
    ", the temperature dependence of the line shift in the non - fermi liquid regime suggests that there may be a small anisotropic interaction component .",
    "we shall explore the consequences of such a non - spin rotation invariant term in sec .",

    ", we show a sketch of the phase diagram of yrs , including the @xmath53 ranges in which esr experiments have been carried out . here , the crossover to the fermi liquid ( fl ) regime is determined by the onset of fl behavior in thermodynamic quantities @xcite .",
    "the @xmath54 crossover is primarily determined by hall effect results @xcite that can be interpreted as a transition ( from left to right ) to a large fermi surface .        -1.5",
    "cm    the high magnetic field esr data reported in @xcite show a crossover from a low - temperature fermi - liquid ( fl ) like regime to a higher temperature non - fermi liquid behavior at a temperature @xmath55 kelvin . in the fl regime the line shift appears to be temperature independent .",
    "relative to the ionic @xmath4-factor of @xmath56 @xcite , the resonance is shifted to lower values @xmath57 independent of magnetic field in the range @xmath58 to @xmath59 tesla . estimating the effective mass ratio , which is also temperature independent below @xmath60  in the magnetic field range considered , as @xmath61 , we obtain from eq .",

    "( width ) the theoretical ratio @xmath76 , in good agreement with the experimental value .",
    "note that the large enhancement of the single particle zeeman splitting by the fermi liquid interaction ( a factor @xmath77 ) is essential in obtaining this agreement .",
    "the spin - orbit interaction in conjunction with the tetragonal lattice anisotropy may be expected to lead to a small admixture of a non - spin - symmetric component to the fermi liquid interaction of the form @xmath78 , where @xmath79 is the unit vector along the @xmath44-axis of the tetragonal lattice .",
    "taking the magnetic field along the @xmath80-axis , we employ a coordinate system in spin space , in which the @xmath43-axis is oriented along the magnetic field and the @xmath81-axis along the @xmath44-axis ( see fig .  2 ) .",
    "-3 cm    the esr oscillating transverse magnetic field is circularly polarized in the @xmath82 plane , which is the @xmath83 plane of the crystal , perpendicular to the static magnetic field .",
    "the screening of the static magnetic field is effected in linear order in @xmath84 only when the component of the magnetic field along @xmath79 is nonvanishing . in turn , the dynamic screening is changed at linear order in @xmath84 , for any component of @xmath85 perpendicular to @xmath86 .",
    "thus , the static and dynamic screening are effected differently by @xmath84 , which gives rise to a resonance line shift , which we now calculate . as we show in the appendix ,",

    "the most likely explanation of this discrepancy is our neglect of vertex corrections , which would remove any non - magnetic contribution to @xmath171 from the linewidth .",
    "overall the extended quasiparticle picture used to account for the esr - properties in the non - fermi liquid regime appears to work quite well .",

    "indeed , by inserting the quasiparticle weight factors , @xmath243 , where @xmath244 is @xmath245or @xmath3 , one finds that the prefactor of the second resonance is zero . in the limit of equal g - factors , the prefactor of the first resonance simplifies to @xmath246 and its position is unshifted , @xmath247 . in the absence of spin lattice relaxation ,",

    "we take this to be the @xmath43-axis in spin space and identify the @xmath44-axis with the @xmath81-axis .",
