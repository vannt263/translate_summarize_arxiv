    "the standard physical model of cosmology is based on the solution of general relativity describing a spatially homogeneous and isotropic spacetime , known as the friedmann - lematre - robertson - walker ( flrw ) solution .",
    "it is assumed that the geometry of our universe is smooth on large scales .",
    "one of the major tasks in modern cosmology is to precisely determine the parameters which characterize the postulated model by fitting the observational data .",
    "the cornerstone of observational evidence that supports the flrw model is the existence of highly isotropic cosmic microwave background radiation ( cmbr ) .",
    "it could be inferred that the spacetime should be exactly flrw when the background radiation appears to be exactly isotropic to a given family of observers  @xcite .",
    "therefore , we can prove the universe to be flrw just from our own observations of the cmbr by taking the copernican principle into consideration .",
    "moreover , this result could be extended to the case of an almost isotropic background radiation , which hints at an almost flrw spacetime  @xcite .",
    "although this simple solution of einstein field equation provides an excellent description for the universe on large scales , it also makes clear that we need to understand the departures from a spatially homogeneous model when interpreting observational data .",
    "indeed , departures from perfect homogeneity change the distance - redshift relation .",
    "however , in practice , cosmological observations are usually fitted just using relationships derived from homogeneous models .",
    "the fact that matter is not continuously distributed can imprint most cosmological observations probing quantities related to light propagation(as discussed in detail in ref .",
    "@xcite ) , in particular regarding the propagation of light with narrow beams , such as the redshift , the angular diameter distance , the luminosity distance , and the image distortion .",
    "the importance of quantifying the effects of inhomogeneities on light propagation was first pointed out by zeldovich  @xcite and kantowski  @xcite .",
    "they designed an  empty beam \" approximation by arguing that photons should mostly propagate in vacuum .",
    "later , this was generalized by dyer and roeder as the  partially filled beam \" approach  @xcite . more generally , the early work of ref .",
    "@xcite stimulated many studies on this issue  @xcite . in this framework , the proportion of clumped matter with respect to the homogeneous fluid is characterized by the clumpiness or smoothness parameter . in addition , they arrived at an equation for the angular diameter distance which , via the etherington relation , connects to the observable luminosity distance .",
    "we refer to it here as the zeldovich - kantowski - dyer - roeder ( zkdr ) luminosity distance .    since the 1960s ,",
    "a rich literature has formed which concerns the zkdr approach and its cosmological implications .",
    "phenomenologies and investigations involving many different physical aspects were performed , such as analytical or approximate expressions  @xcite , critical redshift for the angular diameter distance  @xcite , gravitational lensing  @xcite , and accelerated expanding universe models driven by particle creation  @xcite .",
    "recently , some quantitative analysis from such compact radio sources as standard rulers  @xcite , and such type ia supernovae ( sne ia ) or gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) as standard candles  @xcite were also performed . to be specific , in ref .",
    "@xcite , constraints on the dark energy and smoothness parameter from the so - called gold sn ia sample released by the high - z supernova team  @xcite and the first year results of the supernova legacy survey ( snls ) , which is a planned five - year project  @xcite , were examined .",
    "the results suggested that sne ia data alone was incapable of constraining the smoothness parameter although the gold sn ia provided a little more stringent constraint since this sample extended to appreciably higher redshifts .",
    "later , busti _ et al . _",
    "@xcite performed an updated investigation where the statistical analysis was based on the 557 sne ia union2 compilation data  @xcite and 59 hymnium grbs  @xcite , and almost the same conclusion was achieved .",
    "more recently , this issue was also studied by using union2.1 sn ia  @xcite plus nine long grbs in @xmath5  @xcite and the constrained value of the smoothness parameter indicated a clumped universe  @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "as concluded in their work , this result may be an indication that the zkdr approximation is not a precise form of describing the effects of clumpiness in the expanding universe .",
    "however , in these previous analysis , all distances of sne ia and grbs applied to test the inhomogeneity of the universe were derived from a global fit in the context of standard dark energy scenarios where the clumpiness has vanished , i.e. , the flat @xmath6 cold dark matter ( @xmath6cdm ) or @xmath7cdm model .",
    "that is , the light - curve fitting parameters accounting for the distance estimation in sne ia observations ( e.g. , @xmath8 and @xmath9 in the most widely used salt2 training method  @xcite ) are left as free parameters ( on the same weight as cosmological parameters ) and are determined by fitting the distances of sne ia , which is a linear combination of light - curve fitting parameters and observed quantities , to the model - predicted ones in the context of the standard @xmath6cdm or @xmath7cdm scenario . therefore , hds constructed in this way are somewhat model dependent . moreover , cosmological implications on nonstandard dark energy scenarios or a universe with homogeneity taken into consideration derived from these hds are model biased  @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that this kind of bias can not be neglected and may be significant in the era of precision cosmology  @xcite .",
    "certainly , this kind of bias also hides in the grb cosmology where luminosity relations being responsible for distance estimation of grb are calibrated with the model - dependent hds of low - redshift sne ia  @xcite .    in this paper , we first reconstruct hubble diagrams for the latest sne ia and for long grb observations by calibrating the light - curve fitting parameters and luminosity relations , respectively , in the context of an inhomogeneous universe with the cosmological constant .",
    "these hubble diagrams can lead to unbiased tests for the matter density parameter @xmath0 as well as the clumpiness parameter @xmath1 .",
    "for the joint light - curve analysis of the sdss - ii and the snls ( jla sn ia ) in the range of @xmath10  @xcite , the constraints are @xmath11 and @xmath12 , slightly indicating a clumped universe .",
    "for the long grbs in the range of @xmath13  @xcite , the best fits are @xmath14 and @xmath15 , strongly supporting a homogeneous universe . for the combination of these two probes , the constraints are @xmath3 and @xmath4 , also favoring a universe full of flrw fluid with a very high confidence level .",
    "we suggest that the matter density parameter @xmath0 is mainly determined by the sne ia observations while the clumpiness parameter @xmath1 is primarily constrained from the observed grb events .",
    "moreover , it is also shown that larger scales are explored , the test more strongly implies a homogeneous universe . these reasonable results may be an indication that the zkdr approximation remains to be a precise description for the luminosity distance - redshift relation in a locally inhomogeneous universe with the cosmological constant",
    "for most cosmological models , angular or apparent size distance , which is proportional to the square root of the cross - sectional area @xmath16 , is related to the luminosity distance by @xmath17 . in the model only including dark matter and dark energy , the luminosity distance @xmath18 , which accounts for a partially depleted mass density in the observing beam but neglects lensing by external masses , is obtained by integrating the second - order differential equation for @xmath16 of an observing beam from the source at redshift @xmath19 to the observer at @xmath20  @xcite : @xmath21+\\frac{3}{2}\\eta\\omega_m(1+z)^5\\sqrt{a(z)}=0,\\ ] ] where @xmath22 is the reduced hubble parameter at redshift @xmath19 @xmath23},\\ ] ] and the phenomenological parameter @xmath24 is the so - called clumpiness or smoothness parameter which quantifies the amount of matter in clumps relative to the amount of matter uniformly distributed .",

    "actually , the zkdr approach has been criticized by several authors ( e.g. , a few detailed comments gathered in ref .",
    "however , so far , confrontations of the zkdr luminosity distance with observations have not led to conclusive results in the sense of totally excluding this model .",
    "moreover , we should keep in mind that most previous tests in this field were somewhat dependent on the standard dark energy model ( the flat @xmath6cdm or @xmath7cdm ) .",

    "the cosmic acceleration was discovered 16 years ago by measuring accurate distances to distant sne ia  @xcite .",
    "the reason for the acceleration remains uncertain and a large experimental effort in observational cosmology has been driven to reveal the mechanism of this ostensibly counterintuitive phenomenon . by precisely mapping the distance - redshift relation up to redshift @xmath36 ,",
    "sne ia remain , at this stage , the most promising probe of the late - time history of the universe .",
    "because of the variability of the large spectra features , distance estimation for sne ia is based on the empirical observation that these events form a homogeneous class whose remaining variability is reasonably well captured by two parameters  @xcite .",
    "one of them characterizes the stretching of the light curve ( @xmath37 in what follows ) , and the other describes the color at maximum brightness ( @xmath38 in what follows ) .    with the assumption that sne ia at all redshifts with the identical color , shape and galactic environment have , on average , the same intrinsic luminosity , the distance estimator ( distance modulus : @xmath39 + 25 $ ] ) used in most cosmological analysis is quantified by a linear model , @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the observed peak magnitude in the rest - frame @xmath42 band , and @xmath8 and @xmath9 are nuisance parameters which characterize the stretch - luminosity and color - luminosity relationships , corresponding to the well - known broader - brighter and bluer - brighter relationships , respectively .",

    "the fact that high redshift grbs prefer a homogeneous universe with a great significance of probability can be understood as follows : they explore much larger scales of the universe and should contribute to diminishing the corresponding space parameter .",
    "that is , since the universe is more homogeneous on larger scales ( a higher redshift ) , higher value of the smoothness parameter @xmath1 is favored .",

    "these also may be an indication that the zkdr approximation remains to be a precise description for the luminosity distance - redshift relation in a locally inhomogeneous universe with the cosmological constant .",
    "frankly , it should be pointed out that constraints on the model parameters from low - redshift sne ia and high - redshift grbs are somewhat inconsistent .",
    "this inconsistency may imply that the assumption with the smoothness parameter @xmath1 being a constant is not accurate enough to fit the practical observations .",
