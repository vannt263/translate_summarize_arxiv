    "onsager  @xcite conjectured that the threshold regularity for the validity of the energy conservation of weak solutions of is the exponent @xmath16 : in particular he asserted that for larger hlder exponents any weak solution would conserve the energy , whereas for any smaller exponent there are solutions which do not .",
    "the first assertion was fully proved by constantin , e and titi in @xcite , after a partial result of eyink in @xcite ( see also  @xcite for a sharper criterion in @xmath17-based spaces ) . concerning the second assertion , the first proof of the existence of a square summable weak solution which does not preserve the energy is due to scheffer in his pioneering paper @xcite .",
    "a different proof has been later given by shnirelman in @xcite .",
    "in @xcite the second and third author realized that techniques from the theory of differential inclusions could be applied very efficiently to produce bounded weak solutions which violate the energy conservation in several forms .",
    "pushed by the analogy of these constructions with the famous @xmath18 solutions of nash and kuiper for the isometric embedding problem ( cf .",
    "@xcite and @xcite ) they proposed to approach the remaining statement of the onsager s conjecture in a similar way ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) . indeed in @xcite and",
    "@xcite they were able to give the first examples of , respectively , continuous and hlder continuous solutions which dissipate the energy , reaching the threshold exponent @xmath19 .",
    "after a series of important partial results improving the threshold and the techniques from several points of view , cf .",
    "@xcite , in his recent paper isett @xcite has been able to finally reach the onsager exponent @xmath16 .",
    "the proof of isett combines previous ideas with two new important ingredients , one developed by daneri and the third author in @xcite ( the introduction of mikado flows , see section [ s : perturbation_outline ] ) and one introduced by isett himself the aforementioned paper ( the gluing technique , see section [ s : gluing_outline ] ) .",
    "however , the solutions produced in @xcite are only shown to be nonconservative and in fact for those solutions the total kinetic energy fails to be monotonic on any interval of time .",
    "thus isett s theorem left open the question whether it is possible or not to construct solutions which _ dissipate _ the kinetic energy ( i.e. with strictly monotonic decreasing energy ) .",
    "in fact the latter is a relevant point , for at least two reasons : first of all because dissipative solutions satisfy the weak - strong uniqueness property @xcite and secondly because indeed onsager in his work conjectures the existence of dissipative solutions . indeed , in @xcite onsager states :    _ _    it is of some interest to note that in principle , turbulent dissipation as described could take place just as readily without the final assistance by viscosity .    in this note",

    "however we give an alternative simpler and self - contained argument for theorem [ t : energy_profile ] : indeed the proof of theorem [ t : h - principle ] invokes some results of @xcite , whereas the argument for theorem [ t : energy_profile ] is entirely contained in our note , aside from technical propositions which are classical statements in the literature , all collected in the appendix .",
    "the most important differences in our proof compared to that of @xcite rely on the estimates for the `` gluing step '' of isett s proof ( we refer to section [ s : gluing_outline ] for more details ) and in a simple remark concerning the regions where the perturbation is added ( see section [ s : perturbation_outline ] ) . we note that , even without the extra benefit of imposing the energy profile and achieving the most general @xmath7-principle statement , the proof proposed here is considerably shorter than that of @xcite .",

    "roughly speaking , the stages are as follows :    * mollification : @xmath126 ; * gluing : @xmath127 ; * perturbation : @xmath128 .",
    "the first stage is mollification : we mollify @xmath46 at length scale @xmath129 in order to handle the _ loss of derivative _ problem , typical of convex integration schemes .",
    "to this aim , we fix a standard mollification kernel @xmath94 _ in space _ and introduce the mollification parameter @xmath130 and define @xmath131 where @xmath132 is the traceless part of the tensor @xmath133 .",

    "we encounter the new crucial ingredient introduced by isett in @xcite : we glue together exact solutions to the euler equations in order to produce a new @xmath145 , close to @xmath46 , whose associated reynolds stress error has support in pairwise disjoint temporal regions of length @xmath146 in time , where @xmath147    the parameter @xmath146 should be compared to the parameter @xmath148 used in the paper @xcite .",

    "this is indeed the key idea of isett in @xcite .",
    "the main difference with @xcite is in the construction of the tensor @xmath163 : in this paper we use the usual elliptic operators introduced in @xcite .",
    "this has the advantage that our reynolds stress remains trace free , in contrast to the one of @xcite , and in turn this is crucial to control the energy in the perturbation step below .",
    "it should be noticed that in @xcite the author resorts to a different definition of @xmath163 because he is not able to find efficient estimates .",

    "this remark allows us not only to keep a better control on the energy and a trace - free reynolds stress with the desired estimate , but it also shortens the arguments considerably compared to  @xcite .      the gluing procedure can be used to localize the reynolds stress error @xmath164 to small disjoint temporal regions , but it can not be used to completely eliminate the error .",
    "first of all note that as a corollary of , and , by choosing @xmath57 sufficiently large we can ensure that @xmath165 starting with the solution @xmath166 satisfying and the estimates - , we then produce a new solution @xmath167 of the euler - reynolds system with estimates @xmath168 cf .",

    "a new set of flows , called mikado flows , with much better properties were introduced in @xcite and indeed , a key element in the proof of isett @xcite is the observation , already used in @xcite , that mikado flows behave better under advection by a mean flow .",
    "an important point is that the mikado flows will not only be used to `` cancel '' the error @xmath171 , but also to `` improve the energy '' in areas where the error vanishes identically . in particular",
