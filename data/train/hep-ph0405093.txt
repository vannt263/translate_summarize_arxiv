    "i see - saw scenario @xcite , where the asymmetry is generated via the out - of - equilibrium decay of the same heavy right - handed neutrinos which are involved in generating neutrino masses , it has been studied intensively . in models with a left - right symmetric particle content like minimal left - right symmetric models , pati - salam models or grand unified theories ( guts ) based on @xmath1 ,",
    "the type i see - saw mechanism is typically generalized to a type ii see - saw ( see e.g.  @xcite ) , where an additional direct mass term @xmath2 for the light neutrinos is present .",
    "the effective mass matrix of the light neutrinos is then given by @xmath3 is the type i see - saw mass matrix .",
    "one motivation for considering the type ii see - saw is that it allows to construct models for partially degenerate neutrinos in a natural way , e.g.  via a type ii upgrade @xcite , which is otherwise difficult to achieve in type i models . from a rather model independent viewpoint , the type ii mass term can be considered as an additional contribution to the lowest dimensional effective neutrino mass operator .    in the literature ,",
    "the most discussed case is where the type ii contribution is realized via su(2)@xmath4-triplets .",
    "there are in general two possibilities to generate the baryon asymmetry : via the decay of the lightest right - handed neutrino @xmath5 or via the decay of one or more su(2)@xmath4-triplets @xcite . in the first case",
    ", there are additional one - loop diagrams where virtual triplets are running in the loop @xcite .",
    "referring to the contributions to the decay asymmetries for @xmath5 proportional to @xmath6 as @xmath7 and to the ones proportional to @xmath2 as @xmath8 , either or both contributions can be important for generating the baryon asymmetry .",
    "in many studies of leptogenesis in left - right symmetric models , it has been assumed that @xmath7 dominates even if neutrino masses stem dominantly from @xmath2 ( see e.g.   @xcite ) .",
    "the case where @xmath8 dominates over @xmath7 has recently been studied in @xcite .",
    "it has the interesting feature that unlike in the type i see - saw scenario , there is in general no upper bound on the absolute neutrino mass scale @xcite from type ii leptogenesis , as has been pointed out in @xcite .    in this work ,",
    "we analyze the consequences of the neutrino mass scale for baryogenesis via the out - of - equilibrium decay of the lightest right - handed ( s)neutrinos in type ii see - saw models .",
    "first , we calculate the type ii contributions to the decay asymmetries for minimal scenarios based on the standard model ( sm ) and on the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) , where the additional direct mass term for the neutrinos stems from the induced vev of a triplet higgs .",
    "the result for the supersymmetric case is new and we correct the previous result in the scenario based on the standard model .",
    "we then develop an effective approach to type ii leptogenesis , assuming a gap between the mass @xmath9 of the lightest ( s)neutrino and the masses of the heavier particles involved in generating neutrino masses .",
    "leptogenesis in this framework is approximately independent of the specific realization of the neutrino mass operator .",
    "the calculation of the decay asymmetries using the effective approach confirms our results for the triplet scenarios in the limit of heavy triplets .",
    "we subsequently derive a general upper bound on the decay asymmetry and find that it increases with the neutrino mass scale .",
    "it leads to a lower bound on the mass of the lightest right - handed neutrino , which is significantly below the type i bound for partially degenerate neutrinos .",
    "it is worth emphasizing that these results are in sharp contrast to the type i see - saw mechanism where an upper bound on the neutrino mass scale is predicted .",
    "here we find no upper limit on the neutrino mass scale which may be increased arbitrarily .",
    "indeed we find that the lower bound on the mass of the lightest right - handed neutrino decreases as the physical neutrino mass scale increases .",
    "this allows a lower reheat temperature , making thermal leptogenesis more consistent with the gravitino constraints in supersymmetric models @xcite ) .",
