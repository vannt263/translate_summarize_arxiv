    "one of the recent strategies to deal with interference is interference alignment . in a multiuser channel",
    ", the interference alignment method puts aside a fraction of the available dimension at each receiver for the interference and then adjusts the signaling scheme such that all interfering signals are squeezed in the interference subspace .",
    "the remaining dimensions are dedicated for communicating the desired signal , keeping it free from interference .",
    "cadambe and jafar @xcite , proposed the linear interference alignment ( lia ) scheme for ic and proved that this method is capable of reaching optimal degrees of freedom of this network .",
    "the optimal degrees of freedom for a @xmath0 user ic is obtained in the same paper to be @xmath1 .",
    "the proposed scheme in @xcite is applied over many parallel channels and achieves the optimal degrees of freedom as the signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) goes to infinity .",
    "@xcite , proposed the so called ergodic interference alignment scheme to achieve 1/2 interference - free ergodic capacity of ic at any signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "this scheme is based on a particular pairing of the channel matrices .",
    "the scheme needs roughly the same order of channel extension compared with @xcite , to achieve optimum performance .",
    "the similar idea of opportunistically pairing two channel instances to cancel interference has been proposed independently by @xcite as well .",
    "however , ergodic interference alignment scheme considers only an special pairing of the channel matrices and does not discuss the general structure of the paired channels suitable for interference cancelation .",
    "this paper addresses the general relationship between the paired channel matrices suitable for canceling interference , assuming linear combining of paired channel output signals .",
    "using this general pairing scheme , to align interference at receiver , proposed scheme significantly lowers the required delay for interference to be canceled .    from a different standpoint , this paper obtains the necessary and sufficient feasibility conditions on channel structure to achieve total dof of the ic using limited number of channel extension .",
    "so far , interference alignment feasibility literature have mainly focused on network configuration , see @xcite and references therein . to ease some of interference alignment criteria by using channel structure ,",
    "@xcite investigates degrees of freedom for the partially connected ics where some arbitrary interfering links are assumed disconnected . in this channel model , @xcite examines how these disconnected links are considered on designing the beamforming vectors for interference alignment and closed - form solutions are obtained for some specific configurations .",
    "in contrast , our work evaluates the necessary and sufficient conditions on channel structure of an ic to make perfect interference alignment possible with limited number of channel extensions .",

    "the noise terms are all assumed to be drawn from a gaussian independent and identically distributed random process with zero mean and unit variance .",
    "it is assumed that all transmitters are subject to a power constraint @xmath13 .",
    "the channel gains are bounded between a positive minimum value and a finite maximum value to avoid degenerate channel conditions ( e.g. the case of all channel coefficients being equal or a channel coefficient being zero or infinite ) .",
