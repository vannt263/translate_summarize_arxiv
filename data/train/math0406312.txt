    "it may be shown that @xmath14 is zero unless @xmath15 is a prime power : @xmath16 @xmath17 , in which case @xmath18 is @xmath19    however , the expansions ( [ gamman ] ) and ( [ etan ] ) are slowly convergent and are therefore useless in numerical computations .",
    "effective numerical algorithms for calculating @xmath3 were given by keiper keiper and  kreminski @xcite .",
    "an interesting recurrence relation involving both @xmath3 and @xmath1 has been recently discovered by coffey @xcite ( written here in our convention ( [ series gamma ] ) and ( [ gamman ] ) concerning @xmath3):@xmath20",

    "seem to be some regularities in ( [ etas ] ) . indeed ,",
    "careful ( and very tedious ) inspection of the indices in @xmath22s , their exponents , as well as the numerical coefficients reveals several simple rules :    1 .   each @xmath1 is a linear combination of products of powers of stieltjes numbers with some numerical coefficient : @xmath23 .",
    "2 .   every such term appears only once .",
    "more precisely , @xmath23 appears in @xmath1 with @xmath24 .",
    "the sign of each term is determined by the sum of _ all _ exponents @xmath25 : it is equal to @xmath26 , where @xmath27 .",
    "the numerical coefficients @xmath28 which appear in @xmath1 may be obtained as follows .",
    "let us discard for a while in each term power of @xmath29 , i.e. @xmath30 , if there is one .",
    "it turns out that @xmath28 contains two factors .",
    "the first is@xmath31and the other is@xmath32where @xmath33 is the sum of all indices of @xmath22 in a given product and @xmath34 is the number of all @xmath22s in the same product ( in both cases @xmath22s are counted according to their multiplicity and in both cases we neglect @xmath29 ) , i.e.@xmath35the above product may be further simplified:@xmath36where the last equality stems from the properties of the pochhammer s symbol . according to ( 2 ) we have @xmath37 , and therefore @xmath38 the last step is equivalent to restoring the powers of @xmath39 in the general term @xmath40 .    collecting all the above rules ( 1 - 4 ) together leads to the general expression for @xmath41 as a function of appropriate @xmath22s : @xmath42 $ }   \\label{etaformula}\\]]where @xmath43and the sum ( [ etaformula ] )  is performed over _ all _ combinations of integers @xmath44 satisfying the constraints ( [ additional ] ) .",
    "this sum contains formally many terms , roughly @xmath45 , but , due to the kronecker delta which picks out only appropriate terms ( i.e. when @xmath46 ) and cuts off all the others , the number of non - zero terms is much smaller . this neat and concise relation ( [ etaformula ] )",

    "is given by the second relation ( [ additional ] ) .",
    "it should be emphasized that formulas ( [ gammaformula ] ) and ( [ etaformula ] ) , as well as ( [ lambdaformula ] ) below , may be effectively implemented e.g. using _ mathematica _ symbolic package ( it is not trivial since the number of summations and products is variable ) :    table[\\{subscript[[eta],n-1 ] ,    factor[n*sum[@xmath50[sum[subscript[k , i],\\{i,0,n } ] ] *    kroneckerdelta[n , sum[(1+i)*subscript[k , i],\\{i,0,n } ] ] *    product[(-subscript[[gamma],i])subscript[k , i]/subscript[k , i]!,\\{i,0,n } ] ,    evaluate[apply[sequence , table[\\{subscript[k , j],0,n},\\{j,0,n } ] ] ]    ] ] } , \\{n,1,5 } ]    where the euler gamma function @xmath50 above is slightly modified :    @xmath50[n _ ] : = gamma[if[n = = 0 , 1 , n ] ]",
    "it was shown elsewhere by the author @xcite  that the behavior of certain numbers @xmath2 with growing @xmath15 is crucial for the riemann hypothesis to be true .",
    "now using@xmath51together with ( [ etaformula ] ) we get@xmath52 $ }   \\label{lambdaformula}\\]]which explicitly expresses the oscillating part of li s numbers using stieltjes constants .",
    "similarly as in ( [ etaformula ] ) , due to the binomial coefficient there are in fact many redundant terms in ( [ lambdaformula ] ) which are identically zero , i.e. always when @xmath49 is greater than @xmath15 . those which are non - zero ( @xmath53 ) give :    @xmath54    with growing @xmath15 the number of terms in @xmath2 increases as the summatory function for partition number , i.e. faster than in the case of ( [ etaformula ] ) .",
    "the distribution of values for various terms which contribute to ( lambdas ) is very nonuniform . when @xmath55 the majority of values is concentrated near zero . in figure 1",
    "there are eight histograms for @xmath56 .",
    "the shape of these histograms is roughly symmetrical about zero but it is just the slight departure from symmetry which contributes to @xmath57 .      the fundamental problem , equivalent to the riemann hypothesis itself is whether the oscillating part of li s numbers @xmath2 is bounded by the trend @xmath58 which grows asymptotically as:@xmath59where ( cf .",
