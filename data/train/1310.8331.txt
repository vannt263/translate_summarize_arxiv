    "we have implemented stimulated raman spectroscopy on thin films of a photovoltaic - relevant polymer : fullerene heterostructure to reveal the structural dynamics of the polymer after photoexcitation , and assign the molecular origin of the observed features in transient absorption@xcite and time - resolved photoluminescence@xcite spectroscopies .",
    "upon absorption in the lowest ( @xmath20 , @xmath21 ) band at 2.21ev ( 560 nm ) , ultrafast charge generation occurs within 200fs to form a hole polaron on the polymer .",
    "the charge separation takes place before exciton localisation ( within 3ps ) in the neat film , while the exciton is far from vibrational equilibrium .",
    "furthermore , vibrational relaxation of the resulting polaron on the polymer is modest over the first 100ps , which suggests that the hole is free from the coulomb potential that the twin negative charge would impart .",
    "this mechanistic insight is key for future optimization of the efficiency of polymer : fullerene based solar cells as it provides a window into the relationship between electronic dynamics and those of the polymer lattice involved in the conversion of excitons to photocarriers , which is of key importance for fundamental mechanistic understanding with molecular detail .",
    "moreover , these conclusions are generally important in molecular photoexcitation because virtually every photochemical , photophysical , or spectroscopic process in molecular materials involves coupled dynamics of electrons and the structure .",

    "steady - state spontaneous raman spectra were acquired with a raman microscope ( renishaw invia ) with either 830 or 514-nm excitation .",
    "femtosecond stimulated raman spectroscopy ( fsrs ) was performed at the central laser facility of the rutherford - appleton laboratory using the ultra setup , a 10-khz synchronized dual - arm femtosecond and picosecond laser system described elsewhere.@xcite fsrs requires the generation of three pulses : the actinic pulse ( 560 nm , @xmath6fs ) , the raman pulse ( 900 nm , 1.5ps ) and the broadband probe pulse ( @xmath6fs ) , which yields an experimental time resolution of @xmath7fs .",
    "these were generated using two custom titanium - sapphire amplifiers ( thales laser ) seeded from a single oscillator ( 20fs , femtolasers ) to create synchronised femtosecond and picosecond outputs after compression , respectively .",
    "the femtosecond beam was split into two : one femtosecond beam pumped an optical parametric amplifier ( light conversion topas ) to generate the actinic pulse , while the other femtosecond beam was focused onto a lead - doped - glass window to create a broadband white light continuum to generate the broad - band probe pulse .",
    "the 800-nm fundamental wavelength of the laser was then rejected from the white light continuum by a pair of notch filters ( kaiser holographic notch plus ) to avoid two - photon absorption in the sample .",
    "these notch filters are responsible for the gap at 800 nm in the transient absorption spectra presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1].the picosecond beam was tuned to 900 nm by an optical parametric amplifier ( light conversion topas ) and acted as the raman pump pulse .",
    "the actinic and raman beams were mechanically chopped at 5khz and 2.5khz , respectively , while the probe beam was kept at the system repetition rate of 10khz .",
    "these different repetition rates create four different sequences of pulses , namely actinic - probe ( 01 ) , raman - probe ( 10 ) , actinic - raman - probe ( 11 ) and probe alone ( 00 ) .",
    "the actinic - probe and probe alone sequences are used to obtain the transient absorption spectrum , while the fsrs spectra are obtained using a combination of those four sequences , as explained by greetham _",
    "et al.__@xcite temporal dispersion of the pulses was minimized using reflective optics to transport beams to the sample . a linear motor drive translation stage ( newport ) provided femtosecond to nanosecond pump - probe timing.the beams",

    "samples were placed in a cold - finger cryostat ( janis research company ) and kept under a dynamic vacuum ( @xmath28 mbar ) .",
    "low temperatures were achieved by flowing liquid helium , reaching 100k and 180k for the pcdtbt : pcbm and the neat pcdtbt films , respectively .",
    "the cryostat was rastered by a mecanical stage in the plane perpendicular to the beams to minimize cumulative photo - damage .    after passing through the sample ,",

    "the spectra were averaged using a computer , averaging 216,000 detected shots per spectra for the neat pcdtbt film and 441,000 shots per spectra for the pcdtbt : pcbm film .",
    "the spectra obtained were then smoothed using a feature - preserving savitzky - golay filter in matlab .",
    "the step size of the filter was small to avoid losing spectral accuracy .",
    "the fsrs spectra were baseline corrected , using a polynomial fit to the broad background shape , preserving the fsrs peaks ( see fig .",
    "s7 in supporting information ) .",
    "fsrs peak dynamics ( peak area , centre frequency ) were extracted by fitting a single gaussian curve to individual peaks , or multiple gaussian curves in areas of peak congestion .",

    "other functionals were tested , such as cam - b3lyp,@xcite but the b3lyp was chosen due to a better description of the experimental vibrational spectrum of the ground state .",
    "all the optimization calculations were forced in a planar geometry , since the low - frequenecy torsion motion of the excited state threw the system out of the harmonic regime .",
    "therefore , all torsion effects are not described by those calculations .",
    "while the ground - state and cation properties are calculated with dft , the optically - excited - state properties are obtained by applying time - dependent density functional theory ( tddft).@xcite the new vibrational frequencies of each mode are obtained by fitting a parabola through nine single - point energy calculations around the energy minimum of the first singlet excited state , going from the minimum to the zero - point motion amplitude of the mode .",
    "this technique assumes that the effect on the frequency eigenvalues is limited to the first order , and that second - order effects of displacement eigenvectors can be neglected .",
    "the excited state intensities depend on the charge reorganisation of the addition of an electron and a hole in our system , and they are approximated using the cation and anion ground state calculations .",
    "the ground - state mode was decomposed in the cation and anion vibrational modes , and a weighted average of all the intensities were done accordingly , with equal weight between the cation and the anion , to obtain the new intensity .",
    "this technique neglects the effect of the interaction between the electron and the hole in the excited state .",
    "this effect is presumed to be small in pcdtbt s case , since the description of the first singlet excited state after geometrical optimisation is composed of 97% of the homo@xmath29lumo transition .",
    "however , the new excited vibrational intensities must only be used to indicate the tendencies of the effects of the charge reorganisation , and their quantitative significance is ambiguous .",

    "<S> box 20537 , 1678 nicosia , cyprus [ ucy ]    in photovoltaic diodes based on blends of polymeric semiconductors and fullerene derivatives , photocurrent generation requires charge separation , with photoinduced electron transfer as an early step . from a semiconductor perspective , the electronic structure of the two materials define a type - ii heterojunction , providing sufficient driving force to dissociate highly - bound excitons on the polymer.@xcite in spite of important progress to optimise the solar power conversion efficiency in polymer solar cells , the mechanism for the evolution from the non - equilibrium primary photoexcitation ( the unrelaxed exciton on a polymer chain immediately after light absorption ) to photocarriers ( unbound charges ) is not resolved and is currently the subject of vivid debate.@xcite earlier studies of all - polymer donor : acceptor blends by morteani  _ et  al_.  concluded that an intermediate step between intrachain excitons and free charges is charge separation into coulomb - bound electron - hole pairs,@xcite which we will refer to as charge - tranfer states ( ct ) , emphasising that the electron and hole are mutually bound across the interface . after this initial step </S>",
    "<S> , the ct state can either branch directly to free charges or relax to an excitonic state bound at the interface between the donor and acceptor materials , a state termed charge - transfer excitons ( ctx ) . </S>",
    "<S> others also reported this branching behaviour in polymer : fullerene blends.@xcite later reports indicated that initial charge separation to ct states occurs @xmath1-fs timescales.@xcite furthermore , jailaubekov  _ et  al_.  concluded that at molecular - semiconductor heterojunctions , ct states must produce photocarriers on timescales faster than @xmath2ps if this process is to be competitive against relaxation to the ctx state,@xcite as the binding energy of ctx is typically @xmath3 at room temperature,@xcite rendering photocarrier generation from those states energetically unlikely in principle . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , these relaxed ctx can be ` pushed ' with an infrared optical pulse resonant with an intraband polaronic optical transition to promote them to a delocalised , near - conduction - edge state that can then dissociate into charge carriers , thus enhancing photocurrent.@xcite however , lee  _ et  al_.@xcite and more recently vandewal  _ et  al_.@xcite have argued that relaxed ctx states , when excited directly , are in fact the photocurrent precursors in many if not most polymer : fullerene systems . </S>",
    "<S> the contemporary literature therefore reflects disagreement on whether rapid dissociation of non - equilibrium intrachain excitons or charge - transfer excitons is a significant pathway towards photocurrent generation in polymer diodes .    </S>",
    "<S> the seemingly conflicting scenarios are all based on probing population dynamics by time - resolved spectroscopies , or directly probing photocurrent internal quantum efficiency spectra in conjunction with steady - state absorption and luminescence measurements , both of which provide limited direct mechanistic insight into photocarrier generation dynamics . in this work , </S>",
    "<S> we exploit an ultrafast optical probe that is simultaneously sensitive to molecular - structure and electronic - population ( excitons , polarons ) dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> it is therefore an intricate probe of charge photogeneration dynamics since charges in polymeric semiconductors are polaronic , in which the charge distorts the polymer backbone surrounding it , producing unambiguous molecular vibrational signatures . although ultrafast solvatochromism assisted vibrational spectroscopy has been used to study charge dynamics in fullerene aggregates,@xcite our work is to our knowledge the first direct time - resolved vibrational probe of polaron formation dynamics on polymers at polymer : fullerene heterojunctions . </S>",
    "<S> we find that by optical excitation of the lowest ( @xmath4 ) optical transition in the polymer , clear polaronic signatures are present within the early - time evolution of the photoexcitation , on @xmath5-fs timescales , in a benchmark polymer : fullerene blend . </S>",
    "<S> surprisingly , we observe limited vibrational relaxation following this ultrafast process , indicating little structural changes occuring on time windows spanning up to 50ps , which we interpret as indicative of holes on the polymer that are sufficiently far from their electron counterparts such that they are free of their coulomb potential . </S>",
    "<S> our results suggest that in this system , which produces amongst the highest efficiency solar cells , intermediate charge - transfer states ( coulomb - bound electron - hole ) pairs are not prerequisite species for photocarriers . </S>",
    "<S> morevoer , because vibrational signatures of polarons emerge at a faster rate than exciton relaxation by at least two orders of magnitude , we conclude that ultrafast dissociation of non - equilibrium photoexcitations is a significant process in this system . </S>",
    "<S> we implement femtosecond stimulated raman spectroscopy ( fsrs ) to characterise the molecular structural dynamics in a model semiconductor copolymer used in efficient solar cells during charge transfer to a fullerene acceptor in the solid state.@xcite fsrs measures the transient resonance stimulated raman spectrum of the photoexcited species by preparing the polymer in its excited state with a short actinic pulse ( @xmath6fs , 560 nm ) , and then probing the evolution of the stimulated raman spectrum with a pair of pulses : a raman pump pulse resonant with a photoinduced absorption of interest ( 1.5ps , 900 nm ) and a short ( @xmath6fs ) broadband probe pulse to generate the excited - state stimulated raman spectrum of the transient species at various delay times between the actinic and raman - pump / probe pulses . </S>",
    "<S> fsrs thus permits measurement of the time - resolved , excited - state resonance - raman spectrum with ultrafast time resolution ( @xmath7fs ) . </S>",

    "<S> unequivocal identification of polarons in pcdtbt requires knowledge of the spectral signatures of its cations . to measure them , we oxidised a neat polymer film , that is a film composed only by the polymer material , with fecl@xmath11 , which is known to dope polycarbazoles.@xcite the ground - state absorption spectrum of the doped film ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : fig1]b ) features a low - energy absorption band centred around 1.7ev , which has been assigned to cations in previous doping studies.@xcite this absorption band in the doped film corresponds to the ` interband ' polaronic transition.@xcite it matches closely the transient absorption band of the pcdtbt : pcbm blend in the 1.22.0-ev region ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : fig1]c ) , which reinforces previous assignment of this photoinduced absorption band to polarons.@xcite excitation of the doped pcdtbt film within the low - energy band at 830 nm ( 1.49ev ) provides thus the resonance - raman spectrum of the polaron ( fig .  [ </S>",

    "<S> we have calculated raman frequencies of the ground , excited and cationic states of the pcdtbt dimer in vacuum using density - functional theory ( dft ) and time - dependent density - functional theory ( tddft ) utilizing the b3lyp functional . </S>",
    "<S> we then identified the modes of the measured raman peaks by comparing them to the frequency and intensity of the bands in the theoretical raman spectrum ( see fig .  </S>",

    "<S> the difference in intensities of the cation resonance - raman spectrum with respect to that of the pristine ( as - cast ) film , consisting of neutral polymer chains , reveal differences in the geometric distortion between the ground and the resonant - electronic states along the normal coordinate for each mode . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , the raman spectrum on resonance with the polaronic transition shows a marked enhancement of bands corresponding to carbazole and thiophene local modes between 1000 and 1200@xmath12 , as well as in benzothiadiazole and carbazole bands at 1268 and 1349@xmath12 , which are more delocalised ( see fig .  </S>",

    "<S> this is consistent with the electronic density shift between the highest occupied molecular orbital ( homo ) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital ( lumo ) of the charged polymer , which affects mainly the carbazole and the thiophene units ( see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> s10 in supporting information ) . on the other hand , the resonance - raman spectra of pcdtbt and pcdtbt : pcbm exhibit strong enhancement of modes predominantly involving motion of the benzothiadiazole unit at 1370@xmath12 and 1540@xmath12 . </S>",
    "<S> this is consistent with the electronic density shift between the homo and the lumo of the neutral polymer , which involves the localisation of the wavefunction on the thiophene  benzothiadiazole  </S>",

    "<S> s8 and s9 in supporting information for fsrs spectra at all recorded time delays ) . </S>",
    "<S> we use a raman pump pulse at 900 nm ( 1.38ev ) to be on resonance with the red edge of the polaron optical absorption , and thus these figures represent the temporal evolution of the stimulated resonance - raman spectrum of the photoinduced polarons in pcdtbt : pcbm heterojunctions . we note the striking similarity of the transient fsrs spectra with the steady - state , spontaneous resonance - raman spectrum of the doped pcdtbt film , confirming that we are probing hole polarons directly on the pcdtbt backbone . the characteristic bands of this polaronic signature , in particular the 1364@xmath12 band that is absent from the fsrs exciton spectrum ( see fig .  [ </S>",
    "<S> fig : fig2]c ) , readily follow the ultrashort actinic pulse ( see also fig .  </S>",
    "<S> s1 in supporting information ) . </S>",
    "<S> the clear observation of the cation raman spectrum at very early times is possible because vibrational coherence dephasing is fast , thus minimising parasitic ` derivative ' line shapes . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , fsrs is a coherent spectroscopy that is able to monitor changes in vibrational frequency that occur faster than the vibrational dephasing time . </S>",
    "<S> this vibrational dephasing is portrayed within the spectra by phase shifts that transpose through interference patterns and frequency shifts in the fsrs spectra . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , an analysis of the early time fsrs line shapes and the spectral kinetics of the c@xmath13 hydrogen - out - of - plane ( hoop ) mode during the ultrafast isomerisation of rhodopsin has recently been carried out by mccamant.@xcite that work correlates the early ( @xmath14ps ) line shapes with frequency changes during the raman vibrational free induction decay showing the hoop mode relaxing with a 140-fs decay time . the heterodyne detection method employed by fsrs that allows interference of the optical fields during the free induction decay cause negative signals , leading to the ` derivative ' type spectral features observed in the time - resolved fsrs spectra of rhodopsin up to 500-fs delays . </S>",
    "<S> our data only portray such derivative features at the earliest time delay , indicating that free - induction decay following the electronic excitation and charge transfer is extremely rapid . </S>",
    "<S> our conclusion that rapid loss of coherence occurs in pcdtbt : pcbm is supported by recent work by gao & grey that reports , for blends of poly(3-hexylthiophene ) ( p3ht ) with pcbm , using resonance - raman spectroscopy excitation profiles , that vibrational coherence within the c = c modes takes place on @xmath15-fs timescales.@xcite the fact that we see clear signals of the cation forming on these timescales confirms the charge transfer reaction is occurring well within the few - hundred - femtosecond timescale . </S>",
    "<S> this structurally sensitive measurement thus establishes unambiguously that polarons in pcdtbt : pcbm blends are created about two orders of magnitude faster than exciton self - localisation in the neat polymer ( see below ) .    the overall shape of the fsrs spectrum of pcdtbt : pcbm at @xmath16-fs timescales is very close to that of the relaxed structure and decays with the population dynamics ( see fig  [ fig : fig3]a and supporting information fig .  </S>",
    "<S> s1 ) , with the exception of the carbazole mode at 1513@xmath12 whose dynamics will be discussed later in this article . </S>",
    "<S> since the spectral signature of polarons emerges in the relaxed structure form at timescales earlier than what we would expect from structural reorganisation , this hints that the conformation of the polymer emerging from the franck - condon region is already close to the relaxed hole conformation in the polymer . </S>",
    "<S> the structural similarity of the polaronic polymer backbone at early time and equilibrium implies a very small structural reorganisation , and we propose that this facilitates the ultrafast charge transfer at the heterojunction .    </S>",
    "<S> having established that polarons appear on ultrafast timescales in pcdtbt : pcbm blends , we address whether they are readily observable in the neat polymer as well . </S>",
    "<S> the fsrs spectra of neat pcdtbt , reported in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : fig2]c , do not display polaronic signatures , excluding that species as a direct photoexcitation on the neat polymer on timescales shorter than 100ps . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , the 1364@xmath12 band is absent , and the relative intensity of the 1260@xmath12 band with respect to the 1429@xmath12 band is at least four times lower at 0.5ps . as the excitation decays , we do not observe the rise of the characteristic 1364@xmath12 band , indicating that there is no conversion of the initial excitation into polarons at later times . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , polarons are not a dominant primary photoexcitation in neat pcdtbt . </S>",
    "<S> we thus assign the observed fsrs spectra in the neat pcdtbt film to intrachain singlet exciton as the primary photoexcitation . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , etzold  _ et  al_.  assigned the photoinduced transient absorption band in neat pcdtbt , centred at the energy we use for our raman pump ( 1.38ev ) , to singlet excitons,@xcite while triplets were argued to form on timescales much longer than those explored in the present experiment.@xcite in addition , the calculated exciton raman spectral line shape in pcdtbt from our tddft calculations is in remarkable agreement with the experimental data ( see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> s2 in supporting information ) , which further supports our assignments .    </S>",
    "<S> these direct structural measurements have important implications on our understanding of ` push - pull ' co - polymers , which comprise electron - rich and electron - poor moieties within the polymer repeat unit . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , an hypothesis to rationalise the generally high solar power - conversion efficiency of this class of co - polymers would be that they readily form loosely bound polaron - pairs upon photoexcitation , without the aid of a fullerene acceptor.@xcite the evidence presented here in favour of the singlet exciton contradict this hypothesis . </S>",
    "<S> we underline that according to our calculations and other work,@xcite the singlet exciton exhibits some degree of charge - transfer - like character . </S>",
    "<S> however , we insist that this picture is distinct from the loosely bound polaron pairs hypothetised for similar ` push - pull ' co - polymers as noted above .    </S>",
    "<S> the evolution of the fsrs spectral line shape in neat pcdtbt is complex , but is consistent with exciton self - localisation on a picosecond timescale . to appreciate the evolution of individual modes , we extract their kinetics by fitting fsrs peaks with a gaussian curve and report their area as a function of time on fig .  </S>",

    "<S> however , other bands deviate significantly from population dynamics . specifically , the 1507-@xmath12 peak decays to 75% of its initial intensity within 3ps , while the 1260@xmath12 band grows on a similar timescale . </S>",
    "<S> the 1507-@xmath12 band is a carbazole mode not visible in the ground state of neutral pcdtbt . </S>",

    "<S> is also observed in other modes , such as the 1045@xmath12 thiophene c  h bending mode . </S>",
    "<S> the evidence provided by fsrs thus helps draw a picture of the exciton evolution following photoexcitation to the franck - condon region , where the wavefunction is initially delocalized along the polymer chain.@xcite the rapid decay of the 1507-@xmath12 mode indicates that initial coupling of carbazole with thiophenes is lost upon shifting of electron density from carbazole to the benzothiadazole acceptor , evidenced by the growing intensity of the 1260@xmath12 band . </S>",
    "<S> localisation of the electronic density on the benzothiadiazole and thiophenes is consistent with the calculated localisation of the electronic density in the lumo ( see fig . </S>",
    "<S> s13 in the supporting information ) . therefore , exciton localisation ( self - trapping ) takes place on a 3ps timescale in the case of pcdtbt , which is in general agreement with the 110-ps timescale reported for exciton self - localisation in polymers.@xcite    we now return to a discussion of the fsrs dynamics displayed in figs .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : fig2]a and [ fig : fig2]b , in which we had pointed out that the overall shape of the fsrs spectrum of pcdtbt : pcbm at early times is comparable to that of the relaxed structure ( 100ps and beyond ) and decays with the population dynamics ( see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : fig3]a and supporting information fig .  </S>",
    "<S> s1 and s4 ) . </S>",
    "<S> as noted above , the only vibrational decay dynamics that we observe involve the decay of the mode at 1513@xmath12 . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , the 1200@xmath12 mode displays similar behaviour , though its modest intensity makes quantitative analysis challenging . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , what these two modes have in common is that their band intensity depends on the extent of the coupling between carbazole and its neighbouring thiophene .    </S>",
    "<S> we can rationalise the decay dynamics of these modes by a dynamic decoupling of carbazole and thiophene , possibly arising from evolution of the dihedral angle between these moieties . </S>",
    "<S> we also note that although the 1513-@xmath12 mode decays rapidly , this decay is slower in the blend than for the 1507@xmath12 mode in the neat film ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : fig2]c ) . </S>",
    "<S> this suggests that the mechanism in the blend is distinct from the excitonic behaviour in the neat film . </S>",
    "<S> insight on the significance of those dynamics can be gained by considering previous work by pensack  _ et  al_.  focusing on a carboxyl spectator mode in pcbm using ultrafast solvatochromism assisted vibrational spectroscopy.@xcite these authors proposed that vibrational energy originally in franck - condon active modes in a polymer : pcbm electron transfer reaction redistributes on a few - picosecond timescale into a distribution of vibrational modes including those involved in electron transport between pcbm molecules.@xcite we speculate that the rapid relaxation of the 1513@xmath12 mode could be related to mobile hole polarons as they move away from the interface .    </S>",
    "<S> in contrast to the modest relaxation of the polymer backbone in the presence of nascent hole - polarons , the overall spectral shape of the fsrs spectrum of pcdtbt in the presence of excitons evolves continuously during the first 100ps after photoexcitation and probably beyond , which indicates that after the initial fast exciton self - trapping , a slower structural relaxation takes place . </S>",
    "<S> this indication would explain fluorescence up - conversion measurements on pcdtbt thin films , which show that the photoluminescence spectrum red shifts to its relaxed state within 200ps.@xcite in particular , we observe red - shifting of the 1260 and 1471-@xmath12 bands that correspond to benzothiadazole and carbazole motion likely due to change in the bond order of the backbone in the thiophene - benzothiadiazole - thiophene unit , and shift of the electron density from the carbazole to the acceptor moiety , lengthening thus the carbazole c  c bonds ( see fig . s13 in supporting information ) . </S>",
    "<S> on the other hand , the 1429-@xmath12 thiophene and carbazole band blue - shifts significantly between 50 and 100ps , reflecting structural reorganisation on those timescales , involving possibly dihedral angle changes between the two units .    </S>",
    "<S> the two key observations presented in this paper are that    in pcdtbt : pcbm , ultrafast charge transfer happens prior to exciton localisation , as exemplified by the emergence of polaron resonance - raman signatures on pcdtbt on timescales well within a few hundred femtoseconds ; [ bigres1 ]    structural reorganisation after polaron formation is negligable , as we do not observe significant spectral shifts or changes in linewidth during the first 50ps . </S>",
    "<S> [ bigres2 ]    result  ( _ [ bigres1 ] _ ) is strongly indicative of ballistic electron transfer following photoexcitation of pcdtbt in the blend , and that polarons , not charge - transfer excitons , are the photoproduct of such rapid dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> this implies that the corresponding electron on a pcbm phase , not detected by our fsrs measurements , must be separated over a sufficiently large distance on average in order for the polaron on the polymer backbone to not evolve under the resulting coulomb potential on subnanosecond timescales . in the dielectric environment defined by this class of materials </S>",
    "<S> , this separation must be in the order of several nanometers . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , glinas _ et al . </S>",
    "<S> _  have analysed signatures of a transient stark effect in the photobleach component of a transient absorption measurement in molecular donor blends with pcbm , and have concluded that over @xmath17fs the average electron - hole separation evolves to several nanometers,@xcite in agreement with our conclusion . </S>",
    "<S> such rapid , long - range charge transfer can be rationalised by exciton delocalisation phenomena,@xcite which can generally persist over sufficiently long timescales to play a role in the charge separation dynamics of interest in this work . understanding the mechanism of ultrafast charge separation is important , as it was demonstrated that even when electronic alignments are unfavourable to charge separation ( e.g.  in the presence of triplets ) , ultrafast kinetics can dominate and lead to very high internal quantum efficiencies.@xcite golden - rule formalisms applied to molecular electron transfer between localised asymptotic states can not generally describe such rapid dynamics ; however , when formulated in a delocalised basis set , such rapid dynamics can be readily described.@xcite another possible mechanism under which ultrafast electron transfer can occur is bath - induced coupling of asymptotic eigenstates of the system.@xcite in this mechanism , the vertical , non - equilibrium exciton state transfers by resonant tunnelling to a delocalised charge - transfer state induced by a dynamic coupling due to common zero - point fluctuations within a vibrational noise spectrum of the system . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , such spectacularly rapid charge separation points strongly to quantum coherence dynamics which are correlated to the dynamics of the molecular lattice,@xcite and has been argued to play a key role in energy transfer dynamics in biological systems.@xcite either of these two mechanisms permit exciton separation over timescales that are much shorter than those in which a marcus - theory description of ultrafast electron transfer is valid .    </S>",
    "<S> observation  ( _ [ bigres2 ] _ ) concerning the lack of structural reorganisation after polaron formation is surprising , since polaronic relaxation following ultrafast charge transfer is generally expected in these polymers composed of such complex repeat units . since the polaron in pcdtbt : </S>",
    "<S> pcbm is formed within 200fs , the subsequent limited structural evolution over 50ps implies that the nascent hole is sufficiently far from the electron counterpart such that they are free from their mutual coulomb potential . </S>",
    "<S> if the charge pair was coulomb - bound , we would expect evolution of the polaron vibrational signatures as the two charges relax within their attractive potential . </S>",
    "<S> similar to our findings , another fsrs study concerning a coumarin : tio@xmath18 system also observed the absence of significant reorganisation after charge formation.@xcite rapid charge separation is expected in this organic : inorganic system , since electron injection occurs into delocalised states in a conduction band of the inorganic nanostructure . </S>",
    "<S> the remaining positive charge on the dye therefore does not evolve under the influence of the electron potential . </S>",
    "<S> it is surprising that this seems to occur in pcdtbt : pcbm as well , given that such delocalised states in acceptor molecular aggregates are not expected _ a priori_. regarding the modest structural evolution on the polymer , we note that sterbacka  _ et  al_.  concluded that an increase in polymer chain stiffness is related to a smaller polaron relaxation energy.@xcite similarly , coffey  _ et  al_.  have suggested that a key route for improving future excitonic solar cells might be to reduce the reorganisation energy inherent to photoinduced electron transfer.@xcite indeed , we propose that correlating reorganisation dynamics with macroscopic optoelectronic parameters will enable a fundamental understanding of the critical factors that lead to efficient photovoltaic systems at a molecular level . the modest polaron relaxation in pcdtbt : pcbm is an intriguing result , and one that opens a new door to understanding of the differences between material systems that produce efficient solar cells and those that should but do not perform as well , even if they obey the same ` rational design ' principles based on empirical design rules relating device parameters ( e.g.  open - circuit voltage , short - circuit photocurrent ) to materials properties ( e.g.  absorption spectral range , reduction potentials with respect to pcbm , etc . ) .    finally , we discuss that observations ( _ [ bigres1 ] _ ) and ( _ [ bigres2 ] _ ) indicate the possibility of parallel pathways for polaron formation in organic solar cells , as was also highlighted in the literature for p3ht : pcbm . </S>",
    "<S> sheng  _ et  al_.  demonstrated that polarons in p3ht : pcbm are created through two different channels : a direct , ultrafast one - step process and a slower , two - step process involving the creation and the dissociation of charge - transfer states.@xcite gao and grey inferred that the dephasing of the vibrational coherence on ultrafast timescales does not depend on pcbm loading ratio in regiorandom p3ht : pcbm,@xcite indicating that ultrafast coupling to charge - transfer states is not significant . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , because photocarriers are generated with high yield in that system , there must be a direct mechanism for their generation that must bypass charge - transfer intermediates . </S>",
    "<S> similarly , the present work points strongly to direct photogeneration ( i.e.  no ct intermediate ) of unbound polarons in pcdtbt : pcbm , although it is also clear that ctx must form eventually in this system since in a previous publication we observed geminate recombination through ctx emission on nanosecond to microsecond timescales.@xcite we note from this work , however , that the direct polaron generation mechanism is operative on ultrafast timescales in pcdtbt : pcbm , with no forthright evidence of early involvement of intermediate charge - transfer states , while both channels may contribute to photocurrent in p3ht : pcbm . </S>",
    "<S> the degree of importance of the charge - transfer - state - mediated mechanism appears to be highly system dependent . in ultrafast pump - push photocurrent measurements , </S>",
    "<S> bakulin  _ et  al_.  demonstrated that once charge pairs relax into bound states , mid - infrared excitation promotes these to a near - conduction - edge state such that photocurrent is recovered in many polymer : pcbm and polymer : polymer blends , but intriguingly , not in pcdtbt : pc@xmath19bm.@xcite if direct photocarrier generation is dominant in pcdtbt : pcbm and related efficient polymer systems,@xcite avoiding the two - step process as is found in p3ht : pcbm@xcite might be key in driving up efficiencies in solar cells by avoiding highly - bound ctx states,@xcite even if it is the case that these states are photocurrent precursors.@xcite the conclusion that charge self - trapping is limited in pcdtbt blends is the key observation that must be understood in order to better engineer polymers for solar - cell applications . </S>"
