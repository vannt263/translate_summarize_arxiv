    "a long standing mystery in solar physics is why solar coronal loops typically have an axially uniform cross - section @xcite ; i.e. , a filamentary shape . this issue has been made especially pressing by recent trace  ( transition region and coronal explorer ) spacecraft soft x - ray images which show a multitude of highly - defined axially uniform loops @xcite ; for example , see fig .",
    "1 . axial uniformity of flux tubes  is also commonly observed in laboratory experiments , for example , in recent simulations of solar prominences @xcite .",
    "[ h ]    923305php1.eps    this paper argues that axial uniformity is the result of a rather complex sequence of events which occur whenever an electric current @xmath0 is made to flow along an initially axially non - uniform , current - free , axisymmetric magnetic flux tube ( a process corresponding to injection of magnetic helicity into the flux tube ) .",
    "the sequence of events occurs even when @xmath0 is modest , i.e. , even when the flux tube is only slightly twisted .",
    "[ h ]    923305php2.eps    the typical arched shape of coronal loops is shown schematically in fig .",
    "2a ; to make the analysis tractable we will assume that the loop is straight as sketched in fig .",
    "2b . however , in order to retain an important aspect of the arched shape , we will allow the length of the straight loop to vary to take into account possible variability in the length of the arched loop .",
    "2b geometry will be characterized by a straight cylindrical coordinate system @xmath15 where @xmath3 refers to the direction along the loop axis , @xmath16 is the azimuthal direction about the axis , and @xmath17 is the distance from the axis . the @xmath16 direction is called the toroidal direction and the @xmath18 directions are called poloidal .",
    "flux coordinates will also be used when appropriate .",
    "this poloidal / toroidal nomenclature is formally the same as that used for tokamaks , but the configuration should not be confused with a tokamak as there are no closed poloidal field lines .",
    "the current @xmath0 will be assumed to be relatively small so that the poloidal field magnitude @xmath19 is always much larger than @xmath11 in which case the flux tube is only slightly twisted .",
    "we note that this straight cylindrical approximation of flux tube geometry has been used in many previous studies of flux tube equilibria , especially force - free equilibria ( for example , see refs.@xcite ) .",
    "however , the analysis presented here differs substantively from these previous studies because our analysis does not begin by assuming existence of an equilibrium .",
    "instead , our analysis characterizes the dynamics that lead to an equilibrium and shows how the resulting equilibrium is intimately related to these dynamics .",
    "furthermore , our analysis takes into account the non - force - free aspects of the equilibrium ( i.e. , finite pressure gradients ) and shows that these finite @xmath20 aspects are of vital importance to the axial uniformity of the equilibrium .",
    "because of the assumed axisymmetry in fig . 2b , the magnetic field can be expressed as @xmath21 where @xmath22 and @xmath23 is the poloidal flux .",
    "axial non - uniformity corresponds to having @xmath24  and axial bulging corresponds to having @xmath25 the current @xmath0 is similarly given as @xmath26 and is related to the toroidal field by ampere s law , i.e. , @xmath27 the current rise time @xmath28 is assumed to be sufficiently slow that alfvn wave propagation effects are unimportant i.e. , it is assumed that @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the length of the flux tube .",
    "the current thus flows as in an electric circuit so that there are no retarded time or radiation effects . taking the curl of eq.([defb ] ) shows that the current density associated with the magnetic field is @xmath31    controversy exists regarding the properties of @xmath32 external to the current - carrying flux tube@xmath33 some authors @xcite argue that @xmath0 must vanish outside the flux tube while others @xcite argue that @xmath0 should be finite outside .",
    "if one insists that @xmath0 vanishes outside the flux tube so that there is no net current in a flux tube , the flux tube acts like a coaxial cable ( i.e. , a center conductor sheathed by a coaxial outer conductor carrying equal and opposite current ) .",
    "this neutralized current configuration has @xmath34 external to the flux tube and so can not produce magnetic forces on external currents .",
    "adjacent neutralized flux tubes thus can not exert forces on each other and so will not mutually interact , just like adjacent coaxial cables will not mutually interact .",
    "furthermore , sections at different axial positions along the length of a neutralized flux tube can not interact via magnetic forces .",
    "the lack of interaction between sections at different axial positions along the length of a neutralized flux tube means that such a flux tube can not undergo a kink instability since a kink instability involves relaxing to the state of lowest mutual interaction energy between loop segments ( similarly , a coaxial cable will not undergo a kink instability since there is no force between axially separated segments ) .",
    "in contrast , having a net current ( i.e. , being non - neutralized ) implies existence of an external potential magnetic field @xmath11 @xmath35 outside of the flux tube just like the magnetic field external to an ordinary current - carrying wire .",
    "an individual flux tube with net current can kink since , if its axis bends , there will be forces between sections at different axial positions .",
    "two flux tubes , each carrying net current ,  will experience mutual interaction forces due to the @xmath11 of one flux tube interacting with the current of the other flux tube .",
    "thus , two adjacent flux tubes each with net current will tend to wrap around each other as shown in fig .",
    "2a of ref.@xcite since the axis of each flux tube will be affected by the @xmath11 of its neighbor .",
    "since we are assuming here that @xmath36 this wrapping will be very slight .",
    "examination of the loop structures # 1 and # 2 denoted by arrows in fig.1 show that these two structures do indeed wrap around each other slightly ( on the left , loop # 1 is to the rear of loop # 2 ; on the right , the two loops appear to be in the plane of the photo ) .    based on the observations that kinks do occur in solar structures and that coronal loops do show evidence of wrapping we will assume in this paper that net current does flow in a flux tube , i.e. , that the current is non - neutralized .",
    "this assumption is additionally supported by recent work by feldman @xcite and by wheatland@xcite who , after careful analysis of a variety of observational evidence , have concluded that net currents do flow .",
    "the assumption of net current means that we are allowing flux tubes to interact with each other via magnetic forces .",
    "however , since the effect of this interaction is to alter the  three dimensional locus of a flux tube axis , and since we are invoking the straight axis approximation ( i.e. using fig .",
    "2b to represent fig .",
    "2a ) , we are removing from consideration the evolution of the three dimensional locus of the flux tube axis .",
    "the straight axis approximation is thus analogous to a kinematics problem where one works in the center of mass frame of a body and so removes from consideration external body forces that change the location of the center of mass .",
    "the dynamics of the configuration are governed by the combination of the magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd )  equation of motion@xmath37 and the induction equation@xmath38 where the latter is obtained from the curl of the ideal mhd  ohm s law@xmath39    the flux tube ends are at @xmath9 and the flux tube middle is at @xmath40 the flux tube is assumed to be initially current - free so that initially @xmath41 the field in the flux tube is thus initially potential ( i.e. , @xmath42 initially ) and the source currents generating this potential field are external to the flux loop and , as sketched in fig .",
    "2a , are assumed to be below the solar surface .",
    "thus the initially potential coronal loop sketched in fig .",
    "2a will have a magnetic field that is stronger at the footpoints than at the arch top because the arch top is further from the source currents .",
    "this means that the initial current - free flux tube will be bulged at the top because the magnetic field is weaker there . in the straight geometry representation given by fig.2b",
    ", the bulging at the arch top corresponds to having the initially potential poloidal field stronger at @xmath9 than at @xmath8 and the flux tube diameter larger at @xmath8 than at @xmath43    the sequence of events that occurs when the current is ramped up to a steady - state will be shown to consist of the following three stages :    1 .",
    "the first stage consists of a twisting of the magnetic field about the @xmath3 axis in fig . 2b together with an associated transient toroidal plasma velocity @xmath44 .",
    "this stage is incompressible and maintains the flux tube poloidal profile , i.e. , @xmath45 is unchanged and the flux tube remains bulged .",
    "the velocity @xmath44 is proportional to @xmath46 and the toroidal acceleration is proportional to @xmath47 2 .",
    "the second stage involves generation of axial plasma flows .",
    "these flows go from @xmath9 where the flux tube diameter is small to @xmath8 where the diameter is large .",
    "the flows are driven by a @xmath3-directed force which is proportional to @xmath48 this axial force is a nonlinear function of @xmath0 in contrast to the first stage toroidal acceleration which is a linear function of @xmath49 3 .",
    "the third stage involves stagnation of the converging flows at @xmath8 resulting in plasma heating as the flow kinetic energy is converted into heat ( thermalized ) .",
    "there is also an accumulation of convected _ toroidal _ flux at @xmath8 which leads to an enhancement of the pinch force at @xmath8 .",
    "the enhanced pinch force squeezes the flux tube diameter at @xmath8 so that the flux tube approaches axial uniformity , i.e. , @xmath50 ultimately , an axially uniform flux  tube loaded with hot plasma results .",
    "arbitrarily specified magnetic fields do not , in general , have associated mhd  equilibria , i.e. , in general , no pressure @xmath51 exists which satisfies @xmath52 for arbitrarily specified @xmath53 the essential physics underlying this assertion is that @xmath54 is identically zero whereas @xmath55 is not necessarily zero , i.e. , @xmath56 is always a conservative force whereas @xmath57 is in general non - conservative .",
    "a non - conservative force has an associated torque and since a pressure gradient can not balance a torque , no equilibrium is possible when @xmath55 is finite .",

    "the condition @xmath219 when @xmath8 and @xmath220 fixes @xmath218 so that the general solution to the grad - shafranov equation is thus @xmath221 if @xmath222 then the _ only _ solution to eq.([gs ] ) satisfying the prescribed boundary condition that @xmath79 vanishes when @xmath223 is the particular solution @xmath224 however , this solution is axially uniform and so we no longer need to specify @xmath213 as being the radius at @xmath225 it is in fact the radius at all @xmath226 equation ( [ gssoln2 ] ) provides the important result that having a finite but extremely small @xmath20 will cause the poloidal flux surfaces to differ substantially from the force - free situation where @xmath20 is exactly zero and in particular will cause the system to become axially uniform when @xmath227 from a mathematical point of view this is because the right hand side of eq.([gs ] ) is an inhomogeneous term ( source term ) of the partial differential equation .",
    "the source term results in there being a particular solution which would not exist if eq.([gs ] ) were homogeneous , i.e. , if @xmath20 were exactly zero .",
    "the axial uniformity condition @xmath228 is just  eq . ( [ betacondition ] ) and so we conclude that the @xmath20 produced by flow stagnation is precisely the @xmath20 required to force the grad - shafranov equation to give an axially uniform solution .",
    "we further conclude that , given sufficient time and assuming there are no losses , current - carrying flux tubes will always tend to become axially uniform and will always tend to have the @xmath20 given by eq.([betacondition ] ) .",
    "this result is similar to the well - known property @xcite of tokamaks having @xmath229 of order unity because diamagnetism exactly balances paramagnetism so that the resulting field is a potential ( vacuum ) field .",
    "the roles of poloidal and toroidal directions are interchanged in the coronal loop compared to a tokamak and so in the coronal loop it is @xmath230 which is of order unity .",
    "the predicted @xmath20 can be compared with actual observed values of @xmath20 in solar coronal loops . to make a prediction , a nominal observed flux loop radius @xmath231 m @xcite and a nominal measured active region @xmath232 m@xmath233",
    "are used @xcite .",
    "these parameters predict a nominal @xmath234 the observed value @xmath235 is calculated using a nominal density @xmath236m@xmath237 and a nominal temperature @xmath238 k @xcite .",
    "in addition a nominal axial magnetic field @xmath239  t is assumed based on the argument that since the flux tube is axially uniform , its axial field must also be axially uniform and so will have the same value as the nominal @xmath240  at the surface of an active region .",
    "these parameters give @xmath241 which is similar to the predicted value .",
    "this model also has implications regarding the brightening typically observed when the axis of a coronal loop starts to writhe and the loop develops a kink instability ( sigmoid ) . since kink instability occurs when @xmath242 @xcite and for a long thin flux tube @xmath243 , this model predicts that @xmath244 @xmath245 will still be small even if @xmath246 is increased to the point where @xmath242 and kink instability occurs .",
    "however , @xmath20 will increase as @xmath246 increases . since the brightness of a loop is proportional to @xmath247 for a given temperature ,",
    "this model predicts that the loop should brighten in proportion to the writhing of its axis ( i.e. , in proportion to @xmath246 as @xmath248 approaches unity ) .",
    "the model thus provides a heating mechanism ( stagnation of mhd - driven flows ) which is consistent with observed coronal temperatures and densities ; however , the prediction is for @xmath249 rather than for temperature or density separately ; a more detailed analysis would be required to isolate the individual dependence of temperature and density on the stagnation process .",
    "as the flows converge , there will be a few particles which have collision mean free paths and trajectories such that they bounce back and forth between converging fluid elements .",
    "because these particles gain energy on each bounce between the converging flows , these particles will gain energy without bound until desynchronized or lost , i.e. , they will undergo fermi acceleration @xcite .",
    "the number of particles having the appropriate mean free path will be small , so one will expect a small high energy tail located around @xmath40 the concentration of high energy particles around @xmath172 i.e. , at the top of a loop , is in fact what is observed @xcite .",
    "we have shown that the apparently simple problem of driving an electric current along a pre - existing potential magnetic flux tube is actually quite complicated and consists of three stages . in real situations these stages would overlap and not be as distinct as outlined here .",
    "the first stage involves a twisting of the magnetic field and an associated @xmath3-dependent toroidal rotation ( i.e. , twisting )  of the plasma ; this motion is incompressible .",
    "the second stage involves convergent axial flows driven by the nonlinear , non - conservative force associated with the axial gradient of @xmath195 .",
    "the third stage involves accumulation of both mass and toroidal flux at @xmath8 and a simultaneous conversion of directed flow energy into thermal energy , i.e. , stagnation .",
    "the concomitant increase in toroidal magnetic field at the stagnation layer ultimately leads to an equilibrium and because the flow stagnation gives @xmath228 the equilibrium is axially uniform .",
    "this sequence of events should be quite common and should explain why current - carrying flux tubes are so often observed to be filamentary .    finally , it should be emphasized that symmetries in both @xmath16 and in @xmath3 play a critical role in the behavior described here .",
    "symmetry in @xmath16 ( i.e. , toroidal symmetry ) prevents the existence of any toroidal electrostatic field so that the only allowed toroidal electric field is the toroidal electric field associated with changing poloidal flux , i.e. , @xmath250 particles are therefore constrained to stay within a poloidal larmor radius of a flux surface so that there can only be ac currents in the direction normal to a flux surface in which case the plasma acts like a capacitor in the direction normal to the flux surfaces . because toroidal acceleration is driven only by the current normal to a flux surface and because no toroidal pressure gradient is allowed , the toroidal motion is constrained to be transient , finite , and dependent on the temporal behavior of @xmath49 thus when @xmath0 is constant , poloidal current flows along poloidal flux surfaces and",
    "there is no toroidal motion .",
    "symmetry about the @xmath8 plane causes this plane to be a stagnation layer where opposing plasma jets collide resulting in accumulation of mass and of frozen - in toroidal magnetic flux and also a thermalization of the flow kinetic energy ."
