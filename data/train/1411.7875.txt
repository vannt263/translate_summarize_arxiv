    "let us now comment on the small wiggle observed in our data between 1.5  -  1.8  t , well visible in fig .",
    "this effect is caused by some additional resonance which disturbs the shape of the polariton branches .",

    "the detuning @xmath61 , defined by eq .",
    "[ eq00 ] , for each magnetic field strength is marked directly in the figures on the top - axis . at high field strengths the population at the bottleneck decreases due to the reduced scattering between excitons and acoustic phonons as",

    "apart from the high intensity at the bottleneck region ( i.e. at high emission angles ) we observe surprisingly strong population of polaritons at the bottom of lp branch at @xmath1  =  0  deg .",
    "the intensity at the bottom of lp branch and at the bottleneck region are compared in fig .",
    "the intensity at the bottom of lp branch dominates over the intensity at the bottleneck .",
    "this effect suggests an increased scattering process induced by the magnetic field that can transform polaritons directly to the lp ground state .",
    "in fact , the magnetic field shifts the excitonic levels in the quantum well , but also the energy of the qw barrier material , the gaas . the energy difference between the bottom of lp branch and the barrier excitons with increasing magnetic filed approaches 36  mev , where it matches exactly the lo phonon in gaas .",

    "the zero detuning angle represents the resonant situation where the lp and up are equally exciton and photon like . at each magnetic field",
    "its value is different due to the change of the global detuning @xmath61 .",
    "the observed general tendency is the increase of polariton linewidth in magnetic field , even in the anticrossing points where both branches share the same excitonic and photonic components ( red curves in fig .",

    "the increase of polariton linewidth is even more pronounced for up traced along zero emission angle ( @xmath64 , black - dashed curve in fig .",

    "the magnetic field imposes an additional in - plane confining potential to excitons and shrinks the electron and hole wave functions .",
    "as we directly probe the linewidth in @xmath65-space , the field - induced linewidth broadening corresponds exactly to the wavefunction shrinkage in real space .",
    "the exciton relative motion wavefunction , responsible for the polariton linewidth @xcite , becomes more sensitive to the disorder potential and the number of available collision states increases , which was also observed in ref .",
    "this is a reversed process to a motional narrowing effect @xcite , or equivalently , motional narrowing process becomes less pronounced . as the field increase , the statistical averaging over the disorder potential is less effective and the polariton line broadens .",
    "the linewidths of polariton states that become more and more photon - like ( black solid curve in fig  [ f11 ] ) slightly decrease in magnetic field as the photonic function is not perturbed by the magnetic field .",
    "such a situation is not observed when the cavity photon is in resonance with high energy exciton - continuum states . in magnetic field",

    "the change of lower and upper polariton dispersion was observed in magnetic field up to 14  t. at each magnetic field strength we were able to trace the polaritons at zero exciton - photon detuning with no change of the position on the sample , temperature or any other external parameter .",
    "we have shown a strong modification of the polariton energy , population and linewidth induced by the external magnetic field .",
    "the excitonic resonance can be tuned up to 8  mev across the photon mode and the exciton oscillator strength increases by a factor of two up to 14 t , which directly influences the increase in the rabi splitting .",
    "the observed zeeman splitting of polariton states can be very well modelled by taking into account the independent coupling of two exciton spin components with cavity photon polarisations .",
    "the modification of polariton intensity and linewidth are well described by taking into account the influence of external magnetic field on the exciton dispersion and in - plane relative motion , while the photonic resonance is not influenced by the magnetic field .",

    "<S> we detail the influence of a magnetic field on exciton - polaritons inside a semiconductor microcavity . </S>",
    "<S> magnetic field can be used as a tuning parameter for exciton and photon resonances . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss the change of the exciton energy , the oscillator strength and redistribution of the polariton density along the dispersion curves due to the magnetically - induced detuning . </S>",
    "<S> we have observed that field - induced shrinkage of the exciton wave function has a direct influence not only on the exciton oscillator strength , which is observed to increase with the magnetic field , but also on the polariton linewidth . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss the effect of the zeeman splitting on polaritons which magnitude changes with the exciton hopfield coefficient and can be modelled by independent coupling of the two spin components of excitons with cavity photons . </S>"
