    "the possibility of a novel  relativity of locality \" is being proposed  @xcite as a candidate feature of quantum gravity . when locality is relative processes are still local in the coordinatization of spacetime by nearby observers , but they may appear to be nonlocal in the coordinatization of spacetime by distant observers .",
    "one can appreciate some of the main implications of this hypothesis by looking , for example , at a particle decay @xmath0 decomposed into a disappearance event for particle @xmath1 and two particle - production events for particles @xmath2 and @xmath3 : with absolute locality the 3 events coincide in the coordinatization of spacetime by any observer , but with relative locality only  nearby observers \" ( observers themselves  local to \" the coincidence of events ) describe the events as sharply coincident , whereas distant observers in general describe them as not exactly coincident .",
    "of course , since so far all our observations are consistent with absolute locality , it must be assumed that the characteristic scale of the relativity of locality is very small , and the quantum - gravity intuition that motivates these studies provides  @xcite a natural candidate for such a scale : the inverse of the planck scale @xmath4 .",
    "we shall here not dwell on the strength of the quantum gravity motivation for studies of relative - locality , for which readers find detailed arguments in refs .",
    "our perspective is focused on investigating relative locality as a novel candidate relativistic feature , whose full understanding we expect to surely require as much dedicated effort as was needed for the galilean relativity of rest and the einstenian relativity of simultaneity .",
    "for this purpose we return here to the simple perspective and formalization of the first studies  @xcite which noticed that some known deformations of relativistic symmetries , some of the ones studied within the  doubly - special relativity \" research programme ( see , _",
    "e.g. _ , refs .",
    "@xcite ) , could result in the property that coincidences of events established by nearby observers might not appear as coincidences of events in the coordinatization of spacetime by distant observers .",
    "the formalization adopted in refs .",
    "@xcite has the limitation of being confined to the description of free particles , which is evidently a severe limitation for what concerns the development of realistic physical theories with relative locality .",
    "this limitation was removed by the more powerful formulation of relative locality , including a description of interactions , advocated in refs .",
    "@xcite ( also see refs .",
    "but for the characterization of certain relativistic issues , such as the ones which are here of our interest , the restriction to free particles is not an important limitation , and the simplicity of the formalism proves to be very advantageous .",
    "our objective here is to advance the understanding of relative locality by introducing a distinction between longitudinal relative locality and transverse relative locality : with longitudinal relative locality coincidences of events established by nearby observers are described by distant observers as events that are non - coincident along the direction connecting the observer to the events , whereas with transverse relative locality the distant observer describes the events as non - coincident along a direction orthogonal to the direction connecting observer to events .",
    "all relative - locality studies produced so far mainly focused on longitudinal relative locality .",
    "a brief mention of a feature of transverse relative locality is found in ref .",
    "@xcite : the analysis in ref .",
    "@xcite nearly exclusively focused on the case of coincidences of events established by nearby observers which would be described by distantly boosted observers as events that do not coincide along the direction connecting the distantly boosted observer to the events ( a case of longitudinal relative locality ) , but ref .",
    "@xcite also mentioned briefly the possibility that for some distantly boosted observers the lack of coincidence could also be  transverse \" , a lack of coincidence occurring in a direction orthogonal to the direction connecting the distantly boosted observer to the events .",
    "another brief appearance of a manifestation of what we here label as transverse relative locality can be found implicitly in parts of ref .",
    "@xcite , specifically the parts of ref .",
    "@xcite that concerned some analyses of the formalism of refs .",
    "@xcite , for interacting particles , providing evidence of  dual - gravity lensing \" , intended as a manifestation of relative locality such that particles on parallel propagation according to some observers could be described by other observers as propagating along different directions . as discussed in some detail here below , this  dual - gravity lensing \"",
    "is intimately connected with transverse relative locality .",
    "we are here reporting a first dedicated study of transverse relative locality , whose humble objectives are focused on building a few elements of intuition on transverse relative locality , its possible dependence on different scales in some applications of interest , and its comparison to longitudinal relative locality .",
    "we shall in particular show that , at least within the confines of relativistic theories of free particles , all previously - obtained results for longitudinal relative locality have a clear ( and no less significant ) counterpart on the transverse - relative - locality side .",
    "indeed in the next section we find that the doubly - special - relativity - based formalism that led , in ref .",
    "@xcite , to the derivation of manifestations of longitudinal relative locality for some distantly boosted observers also produces transverse relative locality for some other distantly boosted observers , and the magnitude of the two classes of effects is comparable .",
    "then in section iii we also expose some transverse - relative - locality coordinate artifacts that result from adopting spacetime - noncommutativity - inspired phase - space constructions , just like in phase - space constructions inspired by @xmath5-minkowski noncommutativity  @xcite it was recently established  @xcite that longitudinal - relative - locality coordinate artifacts are present .",
    "so the evidence we here provide suggests , however preliminarily , that longitudinal and transverse relative locality really need to be considered as equally meaningful aspects of relative locality .",
    "we work throughout in 2 + 1 spacetime dimensions .",
    "evidently transverse relative locality can not be present in 1 + 1-dimensional theories , and on the other hand all the features of transverse relative locality we are here interested in are fully describable within a 2 + 1-dimensional setup ( the generalization to a d+1-dimensional analysis is only modestly cumbersome , but adds nothing to the concepts and results here of interest ) .",
    "our first task is to expose the presence of transverse relative locality and of the associated dual - gravity lensing within the phase - space setup introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite , which was there used instead mainly to characterize longitudinal relative locality .",
    "so we follow ref .",
    "@xcite in introducing its three main ingredients : ( i ) ordinarily trivial poisson brackets for the spacetime coordinates ( @xmath6 ) ; ( ii ) a completely standard description of the generators of space ( @xmath7 ) and time ( @xmath8 ) translations @xmath9 and of the generator of rotation @xmath10 @xmath11 ( iii ) but an unconventional description , with deformation parameters @xmath12 , of the poisson brackets between boost generators and generators of spacetime translations @xmath13 which in particular leads to  @xcite the following one - parameter family of on - shell relations @xmath14    it is easy to verify  @xcite that all jacobi identities are satisfied by these choices of poisson brackets , and readers familiar with the doubly - special - relativity literature  @xcite will recognize a rather standard dsr - type choice of boost generators .    for what concerns the derivation of the equations of motion ( worldlines ) in such a setup one can of course use  @xcite the on - shell relation as hamiltonian of evolution in an auxiliary worldline parameter @xmath15 .",
    "evidently the momenta are conserved on the worldlines ( since @xmath16 ) .",
    "and one finds @xmath17 from which in particular one obtains that for massless particles ( @xmath18 ) the worldlines are governed by @xmath19 the fact that the speed of massless particles here depends on momentum and @xmath20 in @xmath21 were arranged in ref .",
    "@xcite just so that this speed law for massless particles , @xmath22 , would be produced .",
    "this is how from the more general two - parameter case @xmath23 one arrives at the one - parameter case considered here and in ref .",
    "@xcite : @xmath24 . ] is the main intriguing feature of this relativistic framework , and was the subject of several investigations ( see , _",
    "e.g. _ , refs .",
    "@xcite ) , including some which established the presence of longitudinal relative locality  @xcite .    we shall here expose the presence in this framework of also transverse relative locality through a very explicit analysis .",
    "this analysis is centered on the properties of a coincidence of events , local to an observer alice ( _ i.e. _ occurring in the spacetime origin of alice s reference frame ) , with all events in the coincidence being events of emission of a massless particle , all propagating in the same direction ( but with different momenta ) .",
    "the transverse relativity of locality will be evident once we establish how such a coincidence of events at alice is described by a distant boosted observer , and specifically an observer who is at some distance from alice along the direction of propagation of the particles and boosted in a direction orthogonal to the direction of propagation of the particles .    in preparation for",
    "this analysis let us first establish how a single massless particle emitted in alice s origin and propagating along its @xmath25 axis is described by an observer bob , translated with respect to alice along the @xmath25 direction , and by an observer camilla , purely boosted with respect to bob along the direction @xmath26 .",
    "evidently , in light of the equations for worldlines of massless particles derived above , according to alice such a particle has worldline @xmath27    in order to obtain bob s description of this same worldline we must use the translation generators : @xmath28 where , for definiteness and simplicity , we specialized to the case of an observer bob whose spacetime origin is distant from alice s spacetime origin just the right amount to detect in his origin a massless soft ( @xmath29 ) particle emitted from alice s origin ( so the translation is @xmath30 with parameters @xmath31 ) .",
    "we therefore find that alice s worldline ( [ xa2 ] ) is described by bob as follows @xmath32    we are now ready for the final step of our planned analysis of the massless particle of generic momentum @xmath33 emitted in alice s origin along alice s @xmath25 axis , _ i.e. _ we can now perform the dsr - deformed boost along the @xmath26 direction to obtain the description of that particle according to observer camilla . for",
    "that we can rely on the representation of the ( 3-parameter family of ) boosts given in eq .",
    "( [ boosts ] ) which was already derived in ref .",
    "@xcite : @xmath34    in particular this leads to the following action of the boosts on coordinates : @xmath35    specializing these formulae to the case of a boost purely in the @xmath26 direction , and acting with it on the worldline ( [ xb2 ] ) we arrive at the sought camilla description : @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the boost parameter for the transformation from bob to camilla , which is a pure boost along the @xmath38 direction .",
    "+ some indirect manifestations of transverse relative locality are already visible looking at this single worldline .",
    "in particular , by eliminating @xmath39 one obtains the projection of the worldline in the @xmath40 plane @xmath41 which has some remarkable properties .",
    "+ we notice two main features that characterize this result with respect to the corresponding result that applies in the special - relativity limit ( @xmath42 ) : + ( i ) when distances of order @xmath43 are within the reach of available experimental sensitivities it will be appreciated that the worldline does not cross camilla s spatial origin , a feature we shall find convenient to label as  shift \" ; + ( ii ) when @xmath44 is within the reach of available angular resolutions ( and @xmath45 ) the angle in the @xmath46 plane by which camilla sees the arrival of the particle is momentum dependent , which is the mentioned  dual - gravity lensing \" .",
    "none of this in itself provides a direct manifestation of relative locality , but as we shall see these two features of  shift \" and  dual - gravity lensing \" do play a role in the size of the transverse relative locality effects . at least within the framework we are here adopting , the effect of transverse relative locality could be described as composed of these two features , even in the very tangible sense that the magnitude of the transverse relative locality is obtained combining the magnitudes of the shift and of the dual - gravity lensing .    in order to examine the relative locality itself",
    "of course we must analyze contexts with distant coincidences of events , and the result we obtained above for a single massless particle emitted by alice toward bob and camilla is all that we shall need in order to characterize such coincidences of events .",
    "let us start by focusing on the case of 3 wordlines of that type ; specifically 3 massless particles all emitted simultaneously in alice s origin toward alice s @xmath25 axis , but two of them are  soft \" ( _ i.e. _ their momenta , @xmath47 and @xmath48 are small enough that @xmath49 and @xmath50 can be neglected ; @xmath51 ) while the third one has  hard",
    "\" momentum @xmath52 and we keep track of terms with factors @xmath53 .",
    "so we have set up a coincidence of emission events established by the observer alice , local to the coincidence , and with the work done above we can establish immediately how the relevant 3 worldlines are described by camilla : @xmath54 @xmath55 @xmath56 according to camilla s coordinatization the wordlines of the two soft particles ( for which the @xmath57-deformation is not felt ) of course cross at @xmath58 , just as they would in an ordinarily special - relativistic theory .",
    "but ( see fig .",
    "1 ) the hard worldline does not go through @xmath59 and notably when @xmath60 the hard particle has coordinates @xmath61 , from which we establish a transverse relative locality of @xmath62 .",
    "notice that ( as also shown in fig .",
    "1 ) this amount of transverse relative locality can be described as a combination of the term we labeled  shift \" and of a contribution proportional to the term we labeled  dual gravity lensing \" .",
    "so we have given a crisp characterization of how a distant coincidence of events , the crossings of the 3 worldlines @xmath47,@xmath48,@xmath52 at alice , produces for a distantly boosted observer , camilla , some transverse relative locality , which in general also involves  shift \" and  dual - gravity lensing \" .",
    "it is interesting to check how the dual - gravity lensing depends on the momenta of the particles , and for this purpose it is useful to contemplate a fourth massless particle , with momentum @xmath63 , again emitted at alice s origin simultaneously with the other 3 massless particles and emitted toward alice s @xmath25 direction .",
    "we take that @xmath63 is also  hard \" , so that both terms with factors in @xmath64 and in @xmath53 should be taken into account . for this fourth worldline camilla s description",
    "evidently is @xmath65    comparing these with ( [ xcc ] ) we see that in the @xmath66 plane the two hard wordlines reach camilla from directions forming an angle @xmath67 where notably the angle depends linearly on the difference of the momenta @xmath68 .    finally , let us contemplate a different situation , with only two such massless particles , of momenta @xmath69 and @xmath70 propagating again along alice s @xmath25 direction but emitted from alice s origin with just the right difference of times of emission that they reach bob s origin simultaneously .",
    "assuming @xmath69 is soft ( @xmath71 ) and @xmath70 is  hard \" ( @xmath72 ) one has that the worldlines for these two particles are , according to alice , @xmath73 @xmath74 also for this situation we are interested in camilla s coordinatization .",
    "we have here a coincidence of ( detection ) events at bob , so camilla is purely boosted with respect to an observer who is local to a coincidence of events .",
    "using again the results we derived above one easily finds that camilla describes these two worldlines as follows @xmath75 @xmath76 this allows us to verify that , as expected  @xcite , the coincidence of events in bob s origin is also described as a coincidence of events by camilla ( both camilla and bob are nearby observers of a coincidence of events , so even in a relative - locality framework they should , and they do , agree on such coincidences of events ) .",
    "there is however something noteworthy about directions of propagation and for which it is useful to characterize the two worldlines on the @xmath66 plane : @xmath77 from this we see that , while as expected no relative locality is seen by camilla in such situations , the dual - gravity lensing survives ( also see fig .",
    "2 ) : the two worldlines emitted by alice along parallel directions are detected by camilla along directions forming an angle ( if @xmath45 ) @xmath78",
    "in the previous section we established for transverse relative locality results for distantly boosted observers in a theory of free particles , which are evidently as significant as the results for longitudinal relative locality established in  @xcite in the same class of theories for free particles . we are , as announced , postponing more detailed studies of transverse relative locality for interacting theories , of the type introduced in refs .",
    "but there is another type of manifestation of longitudinal relative locality for free - particle theories , which we can here reproduce in transverse - relative - locality version .",
    "these are the results for longitudinal relative locality for pure translations established in ref .",
    "@xcite as a peculiar class of coordinate artifacts present in a much - studied phase - space construction inspired by @xmath5-minkowski noncommutativity  @xcite , in which one adopts  @xmath5-minkowski poisson brackets \" for the spacetime coordinates : @xmath79 ( with @xmath80 ) .",
    "it is easy to verify that there is no transverse relative locality for pure translations in those @xmath5-minkowski - inspired phase - space constructions .",
    "however , in this section we want to show that some peculiar coordinate artifacts of transverse relative locality are found under pure translations within a closely related , still noncommutativity - inspired framework . for this purpose",
    "we introduce the following  @xmath81-minkowski \" poisson brackets for spacetime coordinates - minkowski noncommutativity is linked to the algebra @xmath82 ( euclidean - homotheties algebra ) our @xmath81-minkowski noncommutativity is linked to the algebra @xmath83 ( euclidean algebra ) . ]",
    "@xmath84 where @xmath81 is a parameter with dimension of length , and , consistently with the approach we already adopted in the previous section , we work at leading order in @xmath81 .",
    "+ for the description of space ( @xmath7 ) and time ( @xmath8 ) translations , the requirement of enforcing the jacobi identities - minkowski coordinates . ]",
    "leads us to @xmath85 the type of transverse - relative - locality coordinate artifacts we want to characterize in this section are due to the properties of these translation generators . and to see that these properties alone suffice to produce transverse - relative - locality coordinate artifacts we adopt for this section the standard on - shell relation @xmath86 these ingredients are all that is required for the analysis in this section , but as a side remark let us observe that the poisson brackets we introduced are covariant under classical spatial rotations .",
    "we have in fact that @xmath87 if @xmath88 moreover , postulating @xmath10 @xmath11 all jacobi identities are satisfied .    within this setup we shall expose transverse relative locality by analyzing a simultaneous emission of massless particles in the origin of an observer alice , as described in the coordinatization of spacetime by a distant observer bob .    in preparation for",
    "that let us first derive the worldlines that follow from the undeformed on - shell relation , when analyzed in terms of our @xmath81-deformed poisson brackets .",
    "we have that @xmath89 from which in particular one obtains that for massless particles ( @xmath90 ) the worldlines are governed by @xmath91 notice that , as a result of the @xmath81-deformed poisson brackets , the coordinate velocity depends on momenta in a peculiar way @xmath92 and in particular in order for the coordinate velocity to be directed along the @xmath25 direction actually the momentum must have a small @xmath93 component : @xmath94 still it is easy to check that the speed of massless particles in this framework is always momentum independent : @xmath95    we are now ready to consider the emission at alice of two massless particles , a soft particle of momentum @xmath69 ( with @xmath96 ) and a hard particle of momentum @xmath70 ( such @xmath97 can not be neglected ) . and let us further restrict our focus to the case in which , according to alice s coordinates , the two massless particles are emitted toward the @xmath25 axis . in light of the results derived above it is evident that according to alice the two wordlines are coincident : @xmath98 @xmath99    we can now establish how the peculiar properties of our @xmath81-deformed translations affect the way in which a distant observer bob describes these two worldlines .",
    "in general for our @xmath81-deformed translations we have @xmath100 we are again interested in the description of the two worldlines given by an observer bob , at rest with respect to alice , and such that the soft massless particle reaches bob in his spacetime origin .",
    "so the translation parameters of our interest are @xmath31 . for this choice of translation parameters",
    "we find that the two worldlines are , according to bob , @xmath101 @xmath102    as shown in figure 3 , these results confirm that with @xmath81-minkowski coordinates one finds transverse relative locality which is completely analogous to the longitudinal relative locality found with @xmath5-minkowski coordinates in ref .  @xcite .",
