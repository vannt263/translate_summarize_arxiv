    "since @xmath627 is @xmath299 , it is expanding on @xmath307 , so there is some iterate @xmath473 such that @xmath628 . because we assumed @xmath38 is real analytic  at every point of @xmath629 , we can use lemma [ v ] iteratively to see that @xmath38 is real analytic  at every point of @xmath307 , except perhaps at the iterated images of @xmath630 . however , these consist of just the fixed point @xmath631 . to see that @xmath38 is real analytic  at @xmath631 note that @xmath631 is also the image of @xmath632 under @xmath295 , where @xmath38 is real analytic .",
    "thus , @xmath38 must be real analytic  at every point of @xmath307 , which is impossible by proposition [ u ] .",
