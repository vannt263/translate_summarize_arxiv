    "there has been considerable interest in understanding the interplay among the crystalline - electric - field ( cef ) effect , the indirect exchange [ ruderman - kittel - kasuya - yoshida ( rkky ) ] interaction among the 4@xmath9 magnetic moments and the kondo effect in ce compounds , since these are the decisive factors of the physical properties in these compounds .",
    "it is therefore worthwhile to carry out careful investigation in new ce compounds . with this motivation ,",
    "we report here the results of magnetic susceptibility ( @xmath10 ) , magnetization ( @xmath11 ) , heat - capacity ( @xmath12 ) , electrical - resistivity ( @xmath13 ) , thermoelectric - power ( @xmath14 ) , and hall - coefficient ( @xmath15 ) measurements on single - crystalline ce@xmath0pdsi@xmath1 , grown for the first time .",
    "this compound has been reported to form in an alb@xmath0-derived hexagonal crystal structure and to exhibit kondo effect.@xcite the intensity of investigation in the re@xmath16si@xmath1 ( re @xmath17 rare earth , @xmath18 @xmath17 transition metal ) series , crystallizing in the above - mentioned structure,@xcite increased only in the recent years and these compounds have been reported to exhibit many unusual features in the magnetic , thermal , and transport properties ( see , for instance , refs .",
    "110 and references therein ) .",
    "gd@xmath0pdsi@xmath1 exhibits kondo - lattice - like anomalies , e.g. , a resistivity minimum above @xmath3 accompanied by a large negative magnetoresistance.@xcite these features , presumably due to a novel mechanism , are not common to gd compounds .",
    "ce@xmath0cosi@xmath1 is a mixed - valent compound , a small la substitution for ce induces a non - fermi - liquid behavior in @xmath13.@xcite eu@xmath0pdsi@xmath1 exhibits two distinct magnetic transitions , with the possibility of quasi - one - dimensional magnetism for the high - temperature transition@xcite and unusual magnetic characteristics.@xcite particularly considering that the gd - based compound in the pd series has been found to show many interesting anisotropic features,@xcite it is tempting to carry out detailed studies on the single - crystalline ce@xmath0pdsi@xmath1 as well .",
    "previous magnetic , electrical - resistance , and heat - capacity measurements on this compound were performed only in the polycrystalline form@xcite and no clear magnetic ordering could be detected .",
    "thus the present studies extended to much lower temperatures , particularly on single crystals , serve as a first thorough characterization of the bulk properties of this compound .",
    "single crystals of ce@xmath0pdsi@xmath1 have been prepared by the czochralski pulling method using a tetra - arc furnace in an argon atmosphere .",
    "the single - crystalline nature has been confirmed by back - reflection laue technique .",
    "the magnetic measurements were carried out with a quantum design superconducting quantum interference device ( squid ) magnetometer .",
    "the heat capacity was measured by a quasiadiabatic heat- pulse method using a dilution refrigerator .",
    "the electrical - resistivity and hall - effect measurements have been performed by a conventional dc four - probe method in the temperature interval of 0.5300 k. the thermoelectric - power data have been taken by the differential method using a au - fe ( 0.07%)-chromel thermocouple .",
    "figure 1(a ) shows the temperature dependence of the inverse magnetic susceptibility @xmath10@xmath19 , measured in a magnetic field @xmath20 1 koe for both @xmath21 $ ] and @xmath22 $ ] . there is a large difference in the absolute values of @xmath10 for two geometries , apparently due to cef effect . the effective magnetic moment ( @xmath23 ) and the paramagnetic curie temperature @xmath24",
    "are estimated from the high - temperature linear region to be about 2.60@xmath25/ce    = 8.6 cm    and 3.6 k for @xmath21 $ ] and 2.65@xmath25/ce and @xmath8107 k for @xmath22 $ ] , respectively .",
    "these values of @xmath23 are very close to that expected for a free trivalent ce ion ( 2.54@xmath25 ) . the large negative value of @xmath24 for @xmath22 $ ] and a small positive value for @xmath21 $ ] are presumably due to cef effect.@xcite the large anisotropy in @xmath24 may also indicate the existence of anisotropy in the exchange interaction which depends on the cef level scheme .",
    "the expanded view of the temperature dependence of @xmath10 is shown in the inset of fig .",
    "there is no difference between the field - cooled and the zero - field - cooled measurements of @xmath10 down to 1.9 k within the experimental accuracy , indicating the absence of any spin - glass - like behavior .",
    "this fact is in contrast to the formation of spin - glass state in the isostructural u@xmath26pdsi@xmath27.@xcite there is a peak in @xmath28 at around 2.8 k for @xmath21 $ ] and at 2.5 k for @xmath22 $ ] .",
    "these peaks can be ascribed to the antiferromagnetic ordering .",
    "the occurrence of the peak at slightly different temperatures for two directions might be due to the anisotropic field dependence of @xmath6 for two directions , since the heat - capacity measurement in absence of a magnetic field shows a peak at around 3 k as shown below .",
    "recent neutron - diffraction data on polycrystals also suggests the occurrence of antiferromagnetic ( af ) ordering below 2.5 k in a sinusoidally modulated af structure.@xcite    we have tried to analyse the @xmath28 data using a cef model , considering hexagonal site symmetry@xcite of ce in ce@xmath0pdsi@xmath1 . according to the hutchings notation,@xcite the cef hamiltonian for @xmath29 ion with the hexagonal point symmetry",
    "is given by @xmath30 where @xmath31 and @xmath32 represent the cef parameters and the steven s equivalent operators , respectively .",
    "the results of this cef analysis using eq .",
    "( 1 ) , employing the @xmath28 data at the paramagnetic region , leads to @xmath33 10.1 k , and @xmath34 0.11 k. this set of parameters corresponds to a crystal - field level scheme with the three doublets @xmath5 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 at around 0 , 28 k ( @xmath37 ) , and 130 k ( @xmath38 ) , respectively .",
    "accordingly , the calculated values of @xmath10@xmath39 are shown by the solid lines in fig .",
    "1(a ) , which indicates that the anisotropy in @xmath28 is mainly induced by the cef effect . however , there is a deviation of the calculated @xmath10@xmath39 from the experimental values , particularly at low temperatures .",
    "the following explanations can be offered to this deviation : according to szytula _",
    "et al_,@xcite pd and si atoms are random in this crystal structure ( space group @xmath40 ) .",
    "therefore this randomness or disorder between pd and si sites may produce local modification of the cef effects due to the distribution of the cef parameters .",
    "alternatively , if pd and si are well ordered ( space group @xmath41 , see ref .",
    "10 ) , there are two different crystallographic environments for ce ions,@xcite in which case the cef effect may be different for these two sites .",
    "all these factors are neglected in the present cef calculations .",
    "the isothermal magnetization at 2 k is shown in fig .",
    "@xmath11 varies distinctly in different ways with the applied magnetic field for @xmath21 $ ] and @xmath22 $ ] .",
    "this anisotropy in @xmath11 is presumably due to the cef effect .",
    "the magnetic moments at @xmath20 50 koe for two directions are @xmath42 1.18 and @xmath42 0.25@xmath25/ce for @xmath21 $ ] and @xmath22 $ ] , respectively .",
    "the larger magnetic moment for @xmath21 $ ] indicates the @xmath43-@xmath44 plane as the easy plane of magnetization , and the @xmath5 doublet as the ground state , in agreement with the cef analysis from @xmath28 described above .",
    "these two facts are also consistent with the proposed magnetic structure of ce@xmath0pdsi@xmath1 based on neutron - diffraction experiment , i.e. , the ce magnetic moments lie in the @xmath43-@xmath44 plane.@xcite    = 8.6 cm    figure 2 shows the temperature dependence of heat capacity , @xmath45 , for ce@xmath0pdsi@xmath1 .",
    "a peak in @xmath45 at around 3 k indicates the existence of the antiferromagnetic ordering below @xmath46 3 k , supporting the conclusion from the @xmath10@xmath47 behavior .",
    "the transition is , however , not very sharp , which might be due to the presence of site disorders .",
    "the inset shows the @xmath48 vs @xmath49 plot at temperatures far below @xmath6 where phonon contribution is negligible .",
    "the linear coefficient of specific heat ( @xmath50 ) , named as the sommerfeld coefficient , estimated from this plot at such low temperatures is 108 mj / k@xmath4 mol ce . at this temperature",
    "range the specific heat can be expressed as @xmath51 with @xmath52 862 mj / k@xmath53 mol ce and the parameter @xmath54 mainly comes from the contribution of an antiferromagnetic - magnon part . for y@xmath0pdsi@xmath1 , the non - magnetic compound serving as a reference for phonon contribution ,",
    "the @xmath50 value is 4.5 mj / k@xmath4 moly.@xcite the moderately large value of @xmath50 for ce@xmath0pdsi@xmath1 suggests that even in the magnetically - ordered state ce@xmath0pdsi@xmath1 may be classified as a heavy fermion . the solid line in fig .",
    "2 shows the magnetic entropy ( @xmath55 ) estimated from the 4@xmath9 contribution ( @xmath56 ) to @xmath12 .",
    "@xmath56 is obtained by employing the @xmath12 values of y@xmath0pdsi@xmath1 ( ref .",
    "1 ) as a reference for the lattice contribution taking into account the difference of debye temperatures of the two compounds by using the procedure suggested in ref . 14 . at @xmath3 , @xmath57 2.3 j / k mol ce is @xmath42 40% of @xmath58 ln 2 expected for a complete removal of the two fold degeneracy of a cef ground - state doublet .",
    "this reduced entropy value might be due to the substantial kondo - derived reduction of the ce moments and/or a presence of short - range correlations above @xmath3.@xcite tentatively assuming a kondo - derived reduction , the magnetic entropy @xmath55 ( @xmath59 0.4 @xmath58 ln 2 ) at @xmath3 yields the kondo temperature @xmath60 8 k , according to the bethe - ansatz for a spin-@xmath61 kondo model ( see refs .",
    "16 and 17 ) .",
    "the theoretical calculations of @xmath45 using @xmath60 8 k , however , can not reproduce the experimental curve above @xmath3 .",
    "this deviation indicates the presence of short - range - af correlations above @xmath3 ; the presence of these correlations is , in fact , detected in a recent neutron - scattering experiment,@xcite and a possible contribution from an excited cef level ( 28 k ) even at the measured temperature range .    the temperature dependence of resistivity @xmath62 for ce@xmath0pdsi@xmath1 with the current @xmath63 $ ] and @xmath64 $ ] as well as in polycrystalline y@xmath0pdsi@xmath1 is shown in fig .",

    "it clearly reveals the presence of a peak at around 50 k which might be related with @xmath69 enhanced by cef effect as proposed by hanzawa _",
    "et al_.@xcite correspondingly , there is also a broad hump in @xmath70 ( see fig .",
    "the minimum in @xmath62 around 20 k is either due to the kondo effect or a consequence of magnetic - precursor effect as noted for some gd alloys.@xcite it may be noted that the drop in @xmath13 sets in at 8 k , much above the @xmath3 , similar to cept@xmath0ge@xmath0,@xcite    = 8.6 cm    and such a feature in magnetically ordered kondo lattices arises from a combination of indirect exchange interaction and the kondo effect.@xcite there is a small difference in absolute values for two geometries , which might be due to the combined effect of anisotropy in the fermi surface and preferably oriented microcracks . it may also be remarked that the residual resistivity is large even for the single crystal , which might be due to a presence of crystallographic ( pd - si ) disorder or a combined effect of disorder and a dominance of kondo contribution even in the magnetically ordered state .",
    "figure 4 shows the temperature dependence of thermoelectric power ( @xmath14 ) in ce@xmath0pdsi@xmath1 as well as in y@xmath0pdsi@xmath1 ( polycrystal ) . in ce@xmath0pdsi@xmath1 , for the temperature gradient",
    "@xmath71@xmath72 $ ] , @xmath14 is positive at room temperature , then it gradually increases with decreasing temperature and shows a broad hump around 100 k. there is a change of sign around 50 k with a minimum around 17 k. on the other hand , for @xmath71@xmath73 $ ] , @xmath14 has a large negative value at room temperature and decreases with decreasing    = 8.6 cm    temperature showing a broad hump around 100 k. @xmath70 for this direction also shows a minimum , however , at a temperature slightly higher than that for @xmath71@xmath72 $ ] .",
    "thus @xmath70 in ce@xmath0pdsi@xmath1 is highly anisotropic with the directions of the thermal gradient .",
    "the anisotropy in the fermi surface might be one reason behind this anisotropy , since @xmath70 in the isostructural gd@xmath0pdsi@xmath1 is also anisotropic.@xcite for nonmagnetic y@xmath0pdsi@xmath1 , @xmath70 has a large negative value at room temperature and decreases gradually with temperature . in ce@xmath0pdsi@xmath1",
    ", the broad hump can be attributed to the interplay between cef and kondo effect.@xcite the origin of the minimum at @xmath74 @xmath59 17 k is not clear yet , however , the possible explanation may be the kondo scattering in the cef ground state or the growth of af correlations as in the case of ceaual@xmath1.@xcite tentatively assuming the kondo - derived origin , @xmath69 @xmath59 8 k would be obtained using the relation @xmath69",
    "@xmath59 @xmath75 that holds for ceal@xmath0 and cecu@xmath26 ( see ref .",
    "however , the temperature dependence of @xmath12 above @xmath3 suggests that this estimation of @xmath69 is a rough one , indicating that both kondo effect and af correlations may play a role for this minimum . for @xmath71@xmath72 $ ]",
    ", @xmath70 is similar to the behavior in the typical magnetically ordered heavy - kondo compounds , e.g. , cecu@xmath0 and ceal@xmath0,@xcite though the overall temperature dependence of @xmath14 in ce@xmath0pdsi@xmath1 is rather weaker .",
    "if the crystallographic disorder is the dominant origin of the large residual resistivity , the kondo contribution to @xmath70 could be suppressed .",
    "since , according to the gorter - nordheim rule , the thermoelectric power for more than one scattering mechanisms can be expressed as @xmath76/\\rho$ ] , where the subscripts 1 and 2 correspond to different scattering mechanism:@xcite in the present case , 1 represents the kondo scattering and 2 represents the other scatterings .",
    "therefore a large @xmath77 can suppress the kondo contribution @xmath78 .",
    "the large negative thermoelectric power in y@xmath26pdsi@xmath27 might arise from the 4@xmath79 band of pd , as in the case of the 3@xmath79 band of co in yco@xmath0.@xcite    = 8.6 cm    the @xmath70 curve for @xmath80//[0001 ] at high temperatures is almost parallel to that of y@xmath0pdsi@xmath1 , therefore a significant effect of the pd-4@xmath79 band on @xmath70 even in ce@xmath0pdsi@xmath1 can not be ruled out .",
    "the temperature dependence of hall coefficient ( @xmath15 ) for @xmath20 15 koe , shown in fig .",

    "@xmath15 becomes highly anisotropic and shows a positive peak for both geometries , in the vicinity of @xmath3 ( see the inset ) .",
    "the large anisotropy observed in @xmath15 is also reflected in the @xmath28 data taken at @xmath20 15 koe ( not shown ) , indicating that the anisotropy in @xmath15 is of magnetic origin .",

    "clearly , there is a dominant 4@xmath9 contribution in ce@xmath26pdsi@xmath27 .",
    "the hall coefficient in magnetic materials like those in ce compounds is generally a sum of two terms ; an ordinary hall coefficient ( @xmath85 ) due to lorentz force and an anomalous part arising from magnetic scattering ( skew scattering);@xcite in the paramagnetic state @xmath86 , where @xmath87 is a constant . using this relation ,",
