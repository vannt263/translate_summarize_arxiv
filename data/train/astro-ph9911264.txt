    "large numbers of neutrinos were formed in nucleosynthesis and their unknown number of flavors and abilities to convert between flavors leaves their total mass a mystery .",
    "assuming a neutrino collision cross section of @xmath235 @xmath9 and number density @xmath236 @xmath15 gives a mean free path @xmath237 of @xmath238 m , so collisional dynamics apply .",

    "this gives @xmath248 m during the plasma epoch , much larger than any of the structures formed and larger than the horizon for part of the epoch .",
    "any such nonbaryonic material would diffuse away from the protogalaxies and proto - superclusters as they fragment , to fill the voids between .",
    "non - baryonic materials fragment as the last stage of gravitational structure formation to form protosuperhalos when the baryonic protosuperclusters separate by scales larger than @xmath55 .",
    "this is contrary to cold dark matter models that require cdm condensation as the first rather than last stage of structure formation , producing , rather than being produced by , the baryonic structure .",

    "thus a proper description of structure formation in the primordial self - gravitational fluids of the early universe requires more than the linearized euler equation with gravity and the density equation without diffusion or gravity , as assumed by @xcite .",

    "the density @xmath41 depends on temperature and species concentration variations and their diffusivities , and not simply the pressure as assumed by jeans .",
    "the problem is similar to the turbulent mixing problem @xcite except for the remarkable fact that for clouds of fluid with sizes @xmath262 , gravitational diffusivity takes over and the effective diffusivity @xmath263 becomes negative .",
    "thus , rather than reaching a local equilibrium between local straining and diffusion at the batchelor length scale @xmath264 near density extrema as in turbulent mixing theory with a monotonic decrease toward ambient values , densities in the self - gravitational fluids of astrophysics increase to large values or decrease toward zero at these points due to gravitational instability @xcite .",
    "from standard cosmology and the cmb observations , the initial conditions of the gas epoch are precisely defined .",
    "little or no turbulence was present , as discussed previously , so the rate of strain of the fluid was larger than @xmath265 @xmath10 existing at that time and smaller than the fossil vorticity turbulence value in the structures @xmath266 @xmath10 .",
    "the density of the protogalaxies can not have been much different from the fossilized initial fragmentation density @xmath267 kg @xmath15 since there was insufficient time for collapse .",
    "the temperature at decoupling was @xmath268 k. the composition was 75% h and 25% he by mass .",

    "the physical mechanism of this jeans scale fragmentation is not the mechanism proposed by jeans 1902 .",
    "temperatures in growing voids at scales smaller than @xmath280 adjust by particle diffusion to remain constant at @xmath281 as the gravity driven rarefaction waves of void formation propagate , where the term `` void '' indicates a density deficiency rather than @xmath282 . as the density decreases the pressure decreases .",
    "particle speeds and temperatures are constant as long as the particle diffusion time @xmath283 is less than the gravitational free - fall time @xmath284 ; that is , for scales @xmath285 . for scales @xmath28 larger",
    "than @xmath39 the diffusion time @xmath286 is larger than @xmath284 , causing temperatures in these large voids to decrease as the voids grow because particle diffusion can not maintain constant temperature and acoustical equilibrium .",
    "when this happens , radiation heat transfer from the warmer surroundings increases the temperature , and thus also the pressure , within the voids , and the increased pressure accelerates the void formation , isolating blobs of gas at some multiple of the jeans scale to form pgcs .",

    "evidence supporting hgt has recently been summarized @xcite , and includes the appearance of pfp candidates brought out of cold storage by evaporation near hot objects such as white dwarfs in planetary nebula .",

    "thousands of cometary globules appear with mass values , densities , and separation distances as predicted by hgt .",
    "we conclude that the small amplitude @xmath298 of measured temperature fluctuations in the cosmic background radiation is evidence of strong turbulence damping by both a photon viscosity @xmath8 @xmath9 @xmath10 and buoyancy forces of viscous - gravitational structure formation beginning approximately @xmath174 years after the big bang .",
    "the hypothesis is rejected that the small cmb fluctuations reflect hydrodynamic stability of the hubble flow .",
