    "interest in utilizing the `` colossal magnetoresistance '' ( cmr ) effect has resulted in enormous literature , which spans properties of manganites at numerous compositions , ceramic and crystals , crystalline films on different substrates , stoichiometric and not ( for extensive review see @xcite ) . nevertheless , until recently , it was somewhat difficult to establish systematic trends which govern the physical properties of these materials ( especially their low temperature behavior ) , to access peculiarities pertinent to the ground state and its dependence on composition .",
    "as for the overall behavior , especially for the high temperature properties , which are responsible for the cmr phenomena itself , the consensus is that the zener s double exchange ( de ) mechanism @xcite together with the jahn - teller ( jt ) effect for mn@xmath7 as suggested in @xcite produce the basis for their understanding .",
    "high temperature lattice deformations localize carriers by a formation of the jt or local polarons @xcite . with temperature decrease , de mechanism delocalizes carriers and result in simultaneous onset of metallic conductivity and half - metallic ferromagnetic state .",
    "the physical picture , is by all means correct , but the method , introduced in @xcite , is not sufficient for understanding delicate qualitative features , especially at the low temperatures .    as an important issue , we have to mention , is the evolution of ground state for the doped manganites from the insulating antiferromagnetic state of lamno@xmath2 to the pronounced metallic ferromagnetic one in la@xmath0sr@xmath8mno@xmath2 at @xmath9",
    ".    it has been demonstrated first in our short paper @xcite that both the half - metallic state at finite concentrations and the insulating state of the parent lamno@xmath2 can be brought together by making use of a simple band model .",
    "parent lamno@xmath2 is considered in that scheme as a band insulator . as for the doping process",
    ", it has been shown in @xcite , that it leads to the percolative scenario , producing the well defined threshold concentration @xmath10 for the onset of low - temperature metallic conductivity .    in the presentation below we describe in more details and further elaborate the theory , proposed by gorkov and kresin , keeping in mind both some future applications and analysis of available experimental data at @xmath11 is also provided .",
    "it is shown that the two bands theory agrees reasonably well with the results of recent experiments , demonstrating applicability of the fermi liquid approach to the metallic manganites .",
    "the scheme serves as a theory unifying rather rich low temperature properties of manganites and is capable of some predictions regarding the evolution of physical parameters , the shape of the fermi surface etc . with concentration .",
    "the experimental data show also the consistency with our results in the metallic concentration range and trace remaining percolation features .",
    "the paper is written as follows . in sec .",
    "ii the main features are identified and accounted in hamiltonian .",
    "iii contains the energy spectrum and its dependence on a spin ordering or jt - deformations .",
    "properties of a stoichiometric compound lamno@xmath2 , treated as a band insulator , are considered in sec .",
    "growth of the percolative regime for the phase separation and the critical composition for onset of metallic conduction are discussed in sec . v. sec .",
    "vi contains a summary of major metallic properties calculated in the framework of the two band model , while in sec .",
    "vii a comparison with available experimental data is discussed .",
    "viii contains brief summary and conclusions .",
    "we just start with , a somewhat oversimplified ( the so - called `` pseudocubic '' ) crystalline structure for manganites . as it is well - known  @xcite , in that approximation the unit cell ,",
    "say , for lamno@xmath2 , may be taken as a cube , with the lattice constant @xmath12 .",
    "rare - earth or alkaline ions are placed at the center , while the manganese ions occupy the corner sites .",
    "mn@xmath7 sites are caged into the oxygen octahedra , which share the o@xmath13 ions along the mn - o - mn bond ( another view would be that each la@xmath7 ion is cooped up in the midst of twelve o@xmath13 ions ) .",
    "the ideal structure is then modified for real materials , amno@xmath2 , due to a mismatch in the ionic radii .",
    "the latter is commonly characterized by the tolerance factor , @xmath14 ( see e.g. in  @xcite ) : @xmath15 the effect of @xmath16 is that the oxygen octahedra become periodically tilted , and the unit cell may then be comprised of a few `` pseudocubic '' cells .",
    "it is shown below that deviations from the `` pseudocubic '' structure , i.e. deviations in the angle , @xmath17 , of the mn - o - mn bond from @xmath18 are not of much importance for the `` average '' electronic structure .",
    "however , we will see later that _ local _ fluctuations in the tolerance factor ( [ tol ] ) may play rather significant role for the conducting properties of the `` doped '' manganites a@xmath0b@xmath1mno@xmath2 .",
    "let us outline our base model which is then applied for the interpretation of manganites properties . since the manganese @xmath19- shell has reasonably small orbitals , the model exploits the tight binding approximation .",
    "as it is well known , the mn@xmath7 ion has four @xmath19 electrons . the @xmath19 shell in the cubic environment",
    "is split into the triple ( @xmath20 ) and double ( @xmath21 ) degenerate terms .",
    "the @xmath20 level is fully occupied by three electrons considered as a local spin s = @xmath22 , in accordance with the hund s rule .",
    "the @xmath21 term in manganites may be empty ( mn@xmath23 ) or single occupied ( mn@xmath7 ) .",
    "if there is one electron on the @xmath21 level , the direction of its spin is governed by the same intra - atomic hund s interaction : @xmath24 ( @xmath25 the pauli matrix for the @xmath21 electron ) .",
    "the hund s coupling @xmath26 is rather large ( @xmath27 ) .",
    "therefore spins of @xmath21 and @xmath20 electrons are ferromagnetically aligned locally .",
    "the two major assumptions are : 1 . ",
    "the splitting between the @xmath28 and @xmath29 levels is large enough , so that only @xmath21 electrons may participate in conductivity ; 2 . ",
    "the @xmath29 levels are well above the top of the filled up oxygen band ( on a scale of a few ev ) .",
    "the band - structure calculations do not always support the last assertion ( see e.g.  @xcite ) . on the other hand ,",
    "extensive optical studies agree well with the second assumption , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "hoping process of one electron from a site @xmath30 to its nearest neighbor @xmath31 in the tight - binding approximation has to be modified to account for the double degeneracy of the @xmath21 - level on each site . in the hopping hamiltonian ,",
    "hence : @xmath32 @xmath33 becomes a two - by - two matrix .",
    "its explicit form depends on choice of the basis for the @xmath21 - representation .",
    "the @xmath21 - degeneracy of the mn@xmath7 site would locally result in the jahn - teller ( jt ) instability with respect to spontaneous lattice distortions .",
    "two active modes for deformation of the surrounding oxygen octahedron are usually denoted in literature as @xmath34 and @xmath35 ( see @xcite and review @xcite ) , and form the two - dimensional basis of the octahedron deformations . in the invariant form the jt part of the electron - lattice interaction may be written as : @xmath36 where @xmath37 is called the `` pseudospin '' matrix ( see  @xcite ) .    in what follows we use the normalized complex basis @xcite for the two - dimensional representation @xmath21 : @xmath38 where @xmath39 .",
    "another basis , which is often used in literature , for example  @xcite , is given by the real functions : @xmath40 connection between these two is : @xmath41 the given basis ( [ wfunct ] ) makes it possible to present ( [ jt ] ) in the convenient form : @xmath42 where in the standard notations  @xcite : @xmath43 with @xmath44 being the magnitude of the jt - distortions .",
    "the angle , @xmath45 , specifies the shape of the distorted octahedron .",
    "thus , the angles @xmath46 correspond to elongation of the octahedron along the z , x and y - axes , respectively .    the jt - term ( [ jt ] ) is linear in @xmath47 , while the elastic energy is quadratic in @xmath47 .",
    "therefore if one electron is placed on the jt - level , the total site energy always decreases with non - zero lattice deformations . strictly speaking , deformations , @xmath48 , on the two adjacent manganese sites are not independent because the two sites share one oxygen along the mn - o - mn bond ; in what follows only cooperative jt distortions will be considered .    according to review @xcite",
    "( see also @xcite ) we are dealing with two normal modes @xmath34 and @xmath35 , where : @xmath49    onset of the cooperative jt distortions means the onset of a non - cubic structural order ( `` ferrodistorsive '' deformations , if the wave vector of the structure , @xmath50 , `` antiferrodistorsive '' ones , if @xmath51  @xcite ) . to account for fluctuations or changes in the phonon spectrum , the displacements in ( [ eq:8 ] ) must be expressed in terms of the normal modes for the crystal vibrations .    with the above remark regarding the jt - distortion",
    ", one may now bring all the contributions ( [ dva],[hop],[jt ] ) together : @xmath52 ( the last term added into ( [ eq:9 ] ) is responsible for the `` elastic '' energy of the jt mode ) .",
    "the hamiltonian of exactly the form ( [ eq:9 ] ) has been considered by millis et .",
    "al .  @xcite . as it was mentioned above , the important physical observation made in  @xcite",
    "was that with the temperature increase disorder produced by thermally excited jt degrees of freedom tends to localize the charge carriers .",
    "though the idea by all means is qualitatively correct , the approach , used in  @xcite , is a selfconsistent interpolative scheme which is not appropriate for understanding low temperature properties of manganites , i. e. the symmetry of the ground state and its variation with composition .",
    "the latter issues are addressed below mainly in terms of the band approach .",
    "let us consider first the band spectrum of the hamiltonian ( [ hop],[jt ] ) ( the hund s term and jt term being temporary omitted ) .",
    "the matrix @xmath53 in ( [ hop ] ) on the basis ( [ wfunct ] ) has the form : @xmath54 where @xmath55 , \\\\ \\sigma_{12 } = \\sigma_{21}^ { * } = ( a - b )   [ \\cos(k_z a ) + \\epsilon\\cos(k_x a ) + { \\epsilon}^2 \\cos(k_y a ) ] . \\end{array } \\label{eq:11}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] a and b in ( [ eq:11 ] ) are two overlap integrals : @xmath56 where the bar @xmath57 means the matrix elements for the interaction potential on the two wannier functions , @xmath58 , of the neighboring atoms ( in the tight binding approximation @xmath59 ) .",
    "simple geometric considerations for the d - shell show that @xmath60 , according to @xcite ) .",
    "the cubic spectrum consists of the two branches : @xmath61 ( we introduced the notations @xmath62 ) .",
    "if a homogeneous `` ferroelastic '' jt - distortion is imposed on the lattice , the spectrum may be obtained by adding @xmath63 term to @xmath64 in ( [ eq:10 ] ) .",
    "for some future applications we provide here the spectrum for the limiting case @xmath65 : @xmath66 this expression is interesting : at the choice @xmath67 the low - lying electronic branch would become strongly anisotropic ( @xmath68 ) : @xmath69    returning to the full electronic hamiltonian , let us recall that the hund s term ( [ dva ] ) is the largest one : we assume below @xmath70 .",
    "therefore in all cases the electronic spectrum is shifted up or down by the energy @xmath71 , depending on the @xmath21 and @xmath20 _ mutual _ spin direction . at the ferromagnetic alignment of the all local and itinerant spins _ each of _ the two branches of eq .",
    "( [ eq:13 ] ) merely splits into two by adding the @xmath72 energy term . for an antiferromagnetic ( af )",
    "ground state one needs to calculate the energy spectrum again .",
    "it is done below for the important case of two `` canted '' antiferromagnetic sublattices when a ferromagnetic spin component @xmath73 coexists with the staggered magnetization , @xmath74 .",
    "we assume that antiferromagnetic ordering with the structure vector @xmath75 , runs along the @xmath5-axis , @xmath76 .",
    "such an af - structure is often dubbed as the a - phase .",
    "we will perform our calculations treating local @xmath73 and @xmath77 as the classical vectors : @xmath78 .",
    "the @xmath21- electron wave function in the momentum representation acquires the form : @xmath79 where now @xmath80 have a nontrivial spin - index dependence .",
    "let @xmath81 , the staggered magnetization component , be directed along the @xmath82-direction , while @xmath83 is parallel to the @xmath84 - axis ( in the spin space ) . in the calculations below we suppose @xmath75 is along @xmath5-axis .",
    "the brillouin zone is reduced along the @xmath5 - direction , in accordance with a choice of * q * - vector .",
    "the energy spectrum is determined by the following equations : @xmath85 multiplying each equation by @xmath86 and eliminating @xmath87 , one arrives to the following two - by - two matrix equation : @xmath88 \\left [ \\hat{e } - \\hat{t}_{\\bf p } + j_h \\hat{\\sigma}_x m \\right ] \\psi_{\\bf p } = j_h^2 s^2 \\psi_{\\bf p }   \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] or @xmath89 \\psi_{\\bf p } =   j_h^2 s^2 \\psi_{\\bf p } , \\label{eq:16}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we have separated in the @xmath53 - matrix its dependence on the momenta parallel and perpendicular to the direction of the @xmath75 - vector : @xmath90 and also we have used that @xmath91 . equation ( [ eq:16 ] )",
    "gives @xmath92 in the zeroth approximation , as expected .",

    "( [ eq:17 ] ) is the four - by - four matrix : two - by - two due to the orbital degeneracy and two - by - two due to the spin variables .",
    "after diagonalization over the spin variables , it provides the following tunneling matrix : @xmath97 to obtain the new spectrum one merely has to make a substitution in eq .",
    "( [ eq:13 ] ) : @xmath98 ( the number of energy branches is doubled because of reduction of the brillouin zone at doubling the periodicity along the @xmath5 - direction .",
    "if , in addition , there is a homogeneous jt deformation , all @xmath99 and @xmath100 must be changed in the same manner as it has been done above ) . in accordance with the de - mechanism ,",
    "any connection between adjacent ferromagnetic layer in the @xmath101-phase fully disappears in the approximation ( [ eq:18 ] ) . to find further approximations",
    ", one has to take into account small terms of the order of @xmath102 .",
    "the analysis below produces the scale for @xmath14 in ( [ eq:13 ] ) : @xmath103 , i. e. these terms should be reasonably small and may be neglected except for some more peculiar phenomena in doped manganites . regarding the magnitude of the jt - component , eqs .",
    "( [ jt ] , [ qbas ] ) , it is suggested below that main physics to large extent depends on competition between the energy gained in the jt - distortions and kinetic ( band ) energy of electrons .",
    "correspondingly , the jt - term is generally assumed to be of the same order as @xmath104 , @xmath105 , in our model .",
    "at low temperatures the stoichiometric ends of materials in series a@xmath0b@xmath1mno@xmath2 are insulators . for the `` right '' end ( @xmath106 )",
    "it causes no surprise : all manganese ions are mn@xmath23 , i.e. comprise of the localized @xmath20 - spins .",
    "the magnetic properties are then described by an effective heisenberg hamiltonian commonly attributed to the superexchange mechanisms along the mn - o - mn bonds ( the hamiltonian itself may be constructed by the so - called `` anderson - goodenough - kanamori rules '' ( see in @xcite ) . for the same approach to be applied for the `` left '' end ( @xmath107 , lamno@xmath2 ) , one should similary treat the mn@xmath7 @xmath21 - shells as localized spin orbitals .",
    "all pertinent properties are often interpreted in terms of generalized microscopic hubbard model ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the key feature of the hubbard model is the assertion that for two electrons to be placed on the same site the energy cost is very high ( the famous hubbard @xmath108 due to the on - site coulomb repulsion ! ) .",
    "the hubbard hamiltonian approach has been challenged in @xcite .",
    "first , there are experimental motivations for such challenge",
    ". for instance it was shown than in `` doped '' manganites , la@xmath0sr@xmath1mno@xmath2 , at rather low concentrations , say , @xmath109 , the system displays excellent low @xmath110 metallic behavior @xcite .",
    "meanwhile , the nominal number of @xmath21-electrons per @xmath111 site , @xmath112 , was changed only by one fifth in this study . from the theoretical side ,",
    "it is of course clear that dealing with the strictly atomic @xmath19-orbitals would be a strong oversimplification .",
    "if a mn ion is placed into the oxygen octahedron environment , the @xmath21-terms are formed by the whole ligand , so that the `` pure '' @xmath19-functions become considerably hybridized with the surrounding oxygen states ( e.g. see the discussion in @xcite ) .",
    "hence the electronic polarization would undoubtly reduce the magnitude of the `` hubbard''- like ( on - site ) interactions .",
    "finally , for the jt - effect ( which itself is nothing but another form of the coulomb interaction ) to come up there is no need to use the mn@xmath7 localized states picture as it will be seen from what is done below .",
    "the jt effect may persist even in the band model .",
    "therefore , in what follows , we adopt the band approach to describe the ground state of lamno@xmath2 .",
    "this approach rationalizes the major features of an insulating state in lamno@xmath2 very well and merge into metallic state of `` doped '' manganites ( see @xcite ) .",
    "experimentally it is known  @xcite that lamno@xmath2 transforms into the af state below the @xmath113 temperature , @xmath114 .",
    "its magnetic structure corresponds to the a - phase , i.e. , consists of ferromagnetically aligned layers which are coupled antiferromagntically along the one of main axes ( that axis is chosen as @xmath5-axis below ) . as for the lattice ,",
    "the cubic cell becomes compressed along the same direction because the oxygen octahedra exercise the collective @xmath115 ordering : the octahedra are elongated along @xmath84- or @xmath116-direction and are packed as it is shown schematically in fig .",
    "correspondingly , the periodicity is doubled in the @xmath117 plane by the jt - distortions , and is also doubled by the a - phase magnetic superstructure along the @xmath82-axis .",
    "simple considerations will show that calculating the band spectrum for such a superstructure and filling the bands at one electron per manganese site immediately lead to the band insulator ground state .",
    "we preface these calculations with a brief discussion of the role of de mechanism for a more simple model in which each `` manganese '' site has only one orbital for mobile electrons ( in addition to localized spin @xmath77 , of course ) . instead of ( [ eq:13 ] )",
    ", one has now the tight binding spectrum : @xmath118 imposing the hund s term ( [ dva ] ) , @xmath119 , the energy of an electron in the `` half - metallic '' ( fully polarized ) state , @xmath120 , is : @xmath121 and the electronic contribution to the total energy : @xmath122 ( per cubic unit cell ) .",
    "rederiving eq .",
    "( [ eq:16 ] ) in the simplified case described above for the a - phase , it is easy to find the electronic energy of the a - phase ( @xmath123 in @xmath124 : @xmath125    from ( [ eq:20 ] ) and ( [ eq:20p ] ) one may conclude first , that terms of the order of @xmath126 in the electronic energy make the af - state ( the a - phase ) energetically more favorable .",
    "that gain , being small , should be considered together with the superexchange contributions , if any . moreover , both eqs .",
    "( [ eq:20 ] ) and ( [ eq:20p ] ) were obtained for the `` stoichiometric '' case of one electron per mn site .",
    "the de mechanism in cooperation with large value of @xmath127 makes all electrons have only one spin direction .",
    "therefore , the bands in ( [ eq:20 ] ) and ( [ eq:20p ] ) are fully occupied . in _ both _ cases ( ferromagnegnetic and antiferromagnetic states ) one would obtain the insulating phase for that model .",
    "returning to the more realistic situation of the @xmath21-level , the two bands , and the a - type antiferromagnetic order , it follows again from eq .",
    "( [ eq:18 ] ) that in the main approximation the problem reduces to constructing the ground state of a single ferromagnetic layer . unlike the previous case ,",
    "a `` simple '' ferromagnetic state would be metallic because of the two bands : @xmath128 ( since @xmath129 as was mentioned above , the @xmath130-part in ( [ eq:13 ] ) was neglected ) and one electron per cell .",
    "the brillouin zone will be only half - filled ( all electrons are polarized ) .",
    "superstructure imposed by the @xmath115 deformations , as shown in fig .",
    "1 , suggests that since the brillouin zone is now reduced by a factor of two , the same number of electrons may fill up the reduced zone , producing an insulator at the appropriate energy spectrum .",
    "experimentally , lamno@xmath2 _ is _ an insulator and it is interesting to find the electronic band spectrum in the presence of the cooperative jt - distortions and then discuss the spectrum properties together with the experimental findings .    before we proceed further ,",
    "let us make one remark .",
    "as it is well known , two dimensional ferromagnetic state is never stable being destroyed by spin fluctuations .",
    "stabilization of the a - phase comes up due to the small terms in energy , which are responsible for remnant interactions between layers .",
    "our estimates below for @xmath131 and @xmath132 would place the terms @xmath133 on the scale of @xmath134 which agrees well with the low value of the @xmath113 temperature , @xmath135 .    however , `` superexchange '' terms , @xmath136 , with @xmath137 , being on the same scale as @xmath133 , may also become important .",
    "role of these interaction at the small `` electron '' doping ( i.e. close to the camno@xmath2 end ) has recently been discussed in terms of the band picture in @xcite .    to calculate the electronic spectrum of our model in the presence of the `` antiferrodistorsive '' @xmath115 collective deformations shown in fig .",
    "1 , let us note that the structure vector of the superlattice is @xmath138 .",
    "the superstructure shows up in the jt - term ( [ qbas ] ) and depends on which of the two modes @xmath139 or even their superposition ) of eq .",
    "( [ qbas ] ) is chosen to correspond to the jt local deformations on each of the two sublattices .",
    "experimentally , the arrangement in fig .",
    "1 is close to the one in which octahedra are elongated along each @xmath84- or @xmath116- axis preserving the tetragonal symmetry in the perpendicular plane  @xcite ( for that mode the number of `` short legs '' @xmath140 equals four and the `` long '' ones equals two .",
    "these deformations are also seen in some doped materials ( e.g. see in @xcite ) .",
    "alternations of that specific type would be reflected in expression ( [ qbas ] ) as changes from @xmath141 to @xmath142 between the two sublattices .",
    "that will lead to the band s secular equation which can not be solved in the analytic form .",

    "namely , while in the case of a single ion with one electron occupies the _ local _ degenerate @xmath21-level , it inevitably leads to the local instability caused by the linear @xmath115 term ( [ jt ] ) , the ferromagnetic state with the band spectrum ( [ eq:13 ] ) , filled up to some level , would remain stable with respect to _ small _ enough jt distortions .",
    "there is a _ * threshold value * _ for the magnitude of the jt - terms , before the distorted jt state may set in .",
    "this threshold is determined by the electronic kinetic energy gain and the elastic lattice energy . in case of lamno@xmath2 the existence of the cooperative jt deformations",
    "is confirmed experimentally .",
    "with the substitutional doping , a@xmath0b@xmath1mno@xmath2 , say in , la@xmath0sr@xmath1mno@xmath2 by sr , the materials initially show no metallic behavior with resistivity increasing by many orders of magnitude at @xmath169 , in metals , one would expect that resistivity behaves like @xmath170 where @xmath171 , the residual resistivity , is due to the structure defects or impurities , while the @xmath110-dependence comes up from scattering on thermal phonons or from electron - electron interactions . in the second case , the electronic relaxation rate @xmath172 , while the phonon mechanism prevails at @xmath173 , i.e. at @xmath174 , where @xmath45 is the characteristic phonon frequency .",
    "the latter in manganites is about four hundred degrees kelvin while , as we will see , for @xmath175 in manganites one gets the scale @xmath176 .",
    "hence , the electron mechanism might become important up to rather high temperatures .",
    "however , at elevated temperatures a lot of new effects , related to the colossal magnetoresistance phenomenon , start to play the dominating role .    to understand the nature of the ground state of pure and doped manganites , we need , first of all , to concentrate our attention on the low temperature properties .",
    "it has been shown first in @xcite that low @xmath110 resistivity changes its character with doping , so that the metallic behavior ( [ eq:29 ] ) sets in at @xmath177 @xcite .",
    "interestingly enough , the onset of conducting regime coincides with the onset of the low temperature ferromagnetism , strongly indicating in favor of de mechanism for the latter .",
    "the value of @xmath171 may vary , even for nominally the same material and composition , implying that quality of samples may need further improvement . at the same time it is clear , that in all cases the change from insulating to metallic behavior takes place when @xmath84 is close to the critical concentration , @xmath178 .",
    "the origin of that threshold and its value have been first understood in @xcite in terms of percolation theory ( for review on percolation theory see e.g. the book @xcite ) .",
    "the latter considers any process which , roughly speaking , corresponds to some exchange between two adjacent local sites . a material , a@xmath0b@xmath1mno@xmath2 , is commonly prepared by various methods at high temperatures . as the result , position of atom @xmath130 , which is a substitution for a parent atom , is compelely random .",
    "divalent atom b , locally creates a `` hole '' on adjacent mn - sites which could serve as a charge carrier if there were no long range coulomb forces in the dielectric phase , which keep the `` hole '' close to the negative charge at b@xmath179 .",
    "when concentration is small , average distances between @xmath130 atoms are large , which makes holes remain isolated . in the theory of percolation",
    "one may look for the concentration at which the nearest neighbor b - atoms start to form infinite clasters piercing the whole crystal . for the b",
    "- atoms on the cubic sites it is known as the `` site '' problem : on the simple cubic lattice it gives the critical concentration value at @xmath180 . however , this is not exactly our case . for the doped holes , gathering on few manganese sites around an atom b , charge transfer takes place only along mn - o - mn bonds . therefore the picture of a critical cluster , constructed from the b@xmath179-ions",
    "must be corrected : such cluster would already have a finite `` thickness '' due to the holes spread over surrounding mn - sites .",
    "numerical studies on the percolative models @xcite have shown that this circumstance ( i.e. the presence of the scale of a few lattice constants ) strongly decreases the value for the critical concentration , rapidly converging to its value for the homogeneous problem , @xmath181 .",
    "the phenomenon of percolation in disordered media is akin to the other critical phenomena : it bears a singular behavior in the vicinity of @xmath178 , @xmath182 .",
    "thus , it is expected that conductivity above @xmath178 or @xmath183 in ( [ eq:21 ] ) should behave as @xmath184 , where @xmath185 is a critical index .",

    "one of the helpful observations is that for the three - dimensional problem there is a concentration range in which percolation ( infinite clusters ) may take place simultaneously for two phases ( insulating and conducting , for instance ) though taking into account the surface tension at the boundary between two phases seems to impose limitations on relative thickness of the phases .    in case of manganites ,",
    "understanding on the microscopic level remains far from being complete , though the concept is by all means correct . in the above",
    ", the mixture of `` two '' phases , depending on the concentration , @xmath84 , may look as intervened tiny `` islands '' and `` layers '' of different `` phases '' , whose thickness even difficult to access quantitatively . well below and well above the threshold concentration @xmath178 , one may imagine each corresponding phase as a bulk formation into which the second phase is sparsely embedded .",
    "if there is a spill - over of charge carriers between two phases , it is the electro - neutrality condition which regulates the tiny domain sizes .",
    "as it was explained in the previous section , the percolation being a critical phenomenon , may cede soon to the onset of the homogeneous ferromagnetic phase , when screening becomes effective .",
    "in fact , some good samples of la@xmath0sr@xmath1mno@xmath2 show low temperature resistivity in the range @xmath205  @xcite .",
    "interest in applications of cmr was the main reason why the properties of manganites with @xmath206 have been elaborated rather carefully ( temperature of the resistivity peak , @xmath207 , reaches its maximum at 300 k for concentrations in this range ) .",
    "there are still indications @xcite that remnants of the second phase may still persist at @xmath206 .",
    "however , below we will analyze available low temperature experimental data for doped manganites from the band approach .",
    "our conclusions will be that the band model ( or fermi liquid ) approach seems to be valid at low temperatures , especially for the high quality samples .",
    "data are hindered by sample s quality with local inhomogeneities or the second phase inclusions forming the scattering centers . for a number of compositions ,",
    "depending on tolerance factor , conductivity is close to its value in the mobility edge regime .",

    "these experiments were mostly considered in the literature as a crossover @xcite in which conductivity regime via the thermal hopping of polarons localized by the thermal lattice disorder cedes sharply to a metallic regime with a short mean free path . in recent stm experiments",
    "@xcite it has been successfully demonstrated that even around @xmath196 the regime in la@xmath331ca@xmath332mno@xmath2 is better described as a coexistence of the two percolative phases : metallic and insulating ones . the characteristic scale for sizes of subphases having the shape of smooth clouds are from tens to hundreds of nanometers .",
    "another experimental support comes from the mssbauer spectroscopy measurements @xcite .",
    "the strong paramagnetic signal has been observed at @xmath356 .",
    "decrease in @xmath110 leads to the appearance at @xmath357 of the strong signature of the ferromagnetic state , namely the `` 6 picks '' structure in the mssbauer signal .",
    "however , even at @xmath357 the paramagnetic signal persists up to @xmath358 k , which is much lower then @xmath196 . these studies strongly support the exsistance of the two phases and therefore the percolative scenario .",
    "we have discussed above two major issues in doped manganites : 1 .  the concept of percolation , leading , as it was first predicted in @xcite , to the new understanding of the phenomena related to the phase separation , which takes place in these materials at low enough concentrations;2 .  the possibility to interpret some low temperature data in the habitual band ( or fermi liquid ) picture .",
    "the latter makes possible to suggest an unifying view which circumvent the often raised concerns regarding the role of strong interactions , importance of which is commonly expected in the transition metal oxides @xcite .",
    "the fermi liquid approach is a selfconsistent theory , which of course , may be broken at strong interactions .",
    "the only way to justify the fermi liquid approach is to see whether the experimental results do fit the theory predictions or not .",
    "as it was shown above , the theory works reasonably well at @xmath107 and at @xmath9 for @xmath359 , probably because the @xmath360 mechanism results in rather effective de - localization while the jt - effect partially takes care of the coulomb interaction . in the intermediate regime with respect to @xmath84 ,",
    "the tendency towards the phase segregation turns out to have a percolative character and , therefore , theoretical analysis becomes much more complicated .",
    "the question whether the samples quality is an intrinsic property or may be further improved , seems to be of principle importance .",
    "experience with lsmo materials @xcite implies that attempts made to improve the crystals quality are worth of trying . already the lsmo samples with @xmath361 are encouraging , being reasonably close to the possibility of studying metallic manganites by methods traditional to the normal physics of metals , including the possibility of the de haas - van alphen studies in fields of the order of @xmath362 tesla .",
