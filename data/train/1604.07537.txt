    "in this paper , we describe the results of a centimetre - wave radio study of iras 20100@xmath04156 , an ultra - luminous infrared galaxy ( ulirg ) with a redshift @xmath3 = 0.129 @xcite .",
    "iras 20100@xmath04156 hosts a very luminous megamaser ( actually a ` gigamaser ' ) in the @xmath4 , j = @xmath5 , f = 2 @xmath0 2 ( 1667.3590 mhz ) main line transition of the hydroxyl ( oh ) molecule .",
    "oh megamasers are thought to occur when radio continuum emission from the galaxy is amplified by oh molecules whose energy - level population has been inverted by a far - infrared radiation field generated by dust ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for an overview ) .",
    "optical and infrared images reveal this to be part of a merging pair or possibly a trio of galaxies accompanied by tidal tails and clumps of star - forming gas and dust .",
    "both optical and infrared data indicate that the system is in a starburst phase @xcite , has a low ionisation nuclear emission region ( liner)-like spectrum @xcite and a star formation rate , estimated from far - infrared emission , of approximately 700 solar masses per year @xcite .",
    "searches for x - rays and polarised h@xmath6 emission revealed no definitive evidence of an active galactic nucleus ( agn ) @xcite , however a _ spitzer _",
    "space telescope study using a diagnostic based upon the 5 to 8  @xmath7 m brightness ratio found evidence for a 20 per cent bolometric contribution from an agn @xcite .",
    "this agn is presumably deeply embedded within a dusty starburst region at the centre of iras 20100@xmath04156 .",
    "the oh megamaser in iras 20100@xmath04156 was discovered using the parkes radio telescope by @xcite and a slightly improved spectrum was later published by @xcite .",
    "the former paper identified a double peak at 38,697 and 38,648 km  s@xmath1 in the barycentric rest frame with an oh peak flux density of 200  mjy and a broad ` pedestal ' of emission .",
    "iras 20100@xmath04156 was subsequently observed using the australia telescope compact array ( atca ) as part of a study of magnetic fields in oh megamaser galaxies published by @xcite .",
    "they observed the line as having slightly lower peak flux density ( @xmath2165 mjy ) and found a previously unidentified ( 73 mjy ) peak at approximately 38,500 km  s@xmath1 , although an absolute flux calibration was made difficult by the lack of a robust understanding of the spectral baseline due to a narrow observing bandwidth . in this study , we provide a pair of independent observations of the oh megamaser in iras 20100@xmath04156 in a third observing epoch .",
    "the observations were taken as part of spectral line commissioning of the australian square kilometre array pathfinder ( askap ) using the boolardy engineering test array ( hereafter beta ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and a follow - up observation was made using the atca .",
    "the aims of the study were to ( i ) test the spectral line capabilities of beta ,",
    "( ii ) compare the results to those obtained with the atca and ( iii ) investigate the generation mechanism , variability and kinematics of the oh megamaser emission in iras 20100@xmath04156 .",
    "beta comprises six 12-metre diameter parabolic reflectors outfitted with prototype askap phased array feeds @xcite based on a connected - element  chequerboard \" array @xcite .",
    "we used five antennas of beta ; antennas 1 ( diggidumble ) , 6 ( biyarli ) , 8 ( bimba ) , 9 ( gagurla ) and 15 ( minda ) , to observe the galaxy iras 20100@xmath04156 ( right ascension 20@xmath813@xmath929@xmath10509 , declination -41@xmath1147@xmath1235@xmath1348 , j2000 ) from ut 20:00 march 3rd @xmath0 08:00 march 4th 2015 ( scheduling block i d 1496 ) and from ut 06:25 @xmath0 10:42 on 12th may 2015 ( scheduling block i d 1791 )",
    ". we also observed the radio galaxy pks b1934 - 638 for 15 minutes on each day to provide calibration data before the target was observed .",
    "the correlator was configured to record a total bandwidth of 304 mhz between 1399.5 and 1703.5  mhz in 16,416 spectral channels , each with a width of approximately 18.5  khz ( @xmath14@xmath15 = 3.76 km  s@xmath1 at 1477  mhz ) .",
    "nine beams were generated , oriented in a 3 @xmath16 3 square pattern with an inter - beam spacing of 0.66 degrees , with the central beam pointed directly at the target source .",
    "we subsequently obtained director s discretionary time on the atca to provide an independent verification of our results . the observations ( observing code cx322 )",
    "were conducted in 6  km array configuration ( 6a ) between ut 23:45 16th april @xmath0 00:55 17th april 2015 .",
    "the correlator @xcite was configured to simultaneously record a 2 ghz - wide continuum band with 32 @xmath16 64 mhz channels ( velocity resolution 11507.251 km  s@xmath1 ) and four overlapping zoom modes , centred at 1476 mhz .",
    "the output spectral line data set had 5120 spectral channels with a spectral resolution of about 31.3 khz ( or 5.619 km  s@xmath1 ) .",
    "we again used pks b1934 - 638 as a primary calibrator source .",
    "observations of the target source ( 25 minutes ) were interspersed with three short ( 2 minute ) observations of the phase calibrator pks 1954 - 388 .",
    "the total integration time on the target source was 56 minutes , although a small amount of data was flagged due to a suspected phase jump on antenna 3 .",
    "our beta data were flagged , imaged and calibrated following the method described by @xcite , although our procedure here deviates slightly .",
    "notable changes include an increase in the spectral resolution of the full - band coarse - channel data to 1mhz , used for self - calibration .",
    "this was done to reduce the effect of radio frequency interference ( rfi ) , which is more prevalent in this frequency band than at frequencies between 700  mhz and 1ghz .",
    "the flux scale was corrected using a model of pksb1934 - 638 @xcite , and we applied a primary beam correction assuming a simple gaussian model , scaled with frequency .",
    "the beta flux scale was verified against the sydney university molonglo sky survey source catalogue @xcite by @xcite and against the nrao vla sky survey catalogue @xcite by @xcite . since our target source is at the centre of the beam",
    ", we expect any systematic deviation in the flux density over the period of our observation to be dominated by variation in the gain from our observation of pksb1934 - 638 .",
    "we estimate the uncertainty in the beta flux scale to be approximately 7% .",
    "this was determined by adding in quadrature the 3% uncertainty introduced by bootstrapping the flux to pksb1934 - 638 ; a stochastic component of 4% determined by comparing the flux densities of several continuum point - sources close to the field centre over the two beta observing epochs ; and an approximately 5% component introduced by fitting and removing a baseline ripple introduced by nearby rfi . in fig .",
    "[ figure1 ] we show the resultant spectrum at the observed frequency of the red - shifted 18-cm oh line .",
    "the atca zoom mode ( 31.3 khz spectral resolution ) data were processed as follows .",
    "the raw uvdata were loaded into miriad @xcite and some edge channels and those known to contain bad data or correlator artefacts were flagged using atlod .",
    "visibilities with extreme amplitudes ( @xmath17500 jy ) were flagged using uvflag and further interactive flagging was carried out using blflag .",
    "bandpass and polarisation leakage corrections were calculated for the primary flux calibrator pks b1934 - 638 using mfcal and gpcal , respectively .",
    "bandpass corrections were copied to the phase calibrator pks 1954 - 388 before polarisation leakage corrections were determined using that source and the gpcal task .",
    "using gpboot , the absolute flux scale of the phase calibrator was tied to pks b1934 - 638 , using the same method as for the beta observations .",
    "the uncertainty in the absolute flux scale using this model was estimated by @xcite to be 1@xmath02% . adding this in quadrature with the 3% systematic uncertainty introduced by bootstrapping the flux to pksb1934 - 638 gives an overall uncertainty in the atca flux density scale of 4% .",
    "we then adjusted the labelling of velocity channels in the target source data for the doppler correction during the observation using uvaver and we converted the data to the barycentric rest frame .",
    "the calibration solutions from pks 1954 - 388 were copied to the target source iras 20100@xmath04156 .",
    "a baseline ripple was reduced by fitting a fifth - order polynomial to the line - free channels surrounding the oh maser and subtracting this using uvlin .",
    "the task invert was used to generate a calibrated image cube of iras 20100@xmath04156 .",
    "the peak pixel in the cube was located using maxfit and an average spectrum was extracted at that peak position using uvspec .",
    "the beta spectrum shows significant spectral line emission in iras 20100@xmath04156 lying close to the redshift - corrected rest frequency of the f=2@xmath02 oh ( 1667  mhz ) molecular transition . the median 1@xmath18 root mean square ( rms ) noise in the beta spectrum ( determined using the full 304  mhz band ) is 16.4  mjy per beam per spectral channel .",
    "[ figure1 ] shows the observed spectrum , smoothed using third order hanning smoothing .",
    "a simple baseline subtraction was carried out , however the left - hand side of the spectrum is still slightly affected by a baseline ripple caused by strong broadband radio emission from a satellite at approximately 1485  mhz .",
    "the main peak ( a ) apparently has a double structure , however the level of noise in the beta spectrum means that our gaussian fitting method recognises only a single component .    4156 , showing the three gaussian fits and their sum superimposed on the measured signal from beta .",
    "we have labeled the narrow - line peaks a and b for reference .",
    "peak a has a double structure , however the level of noise in the beta spectrum means that our gaussian fitting method does not recognise the double structure as a significant.,width=302 ]    we modelled the spectrum as the sum of three gaussian components using magicplot .",
    "the model was determined by increasing the number of gaussians until the residuals within the frequency range of the spectral line resembled the noise .",
    "magicplot employs a levenberg - marquardt nonlinear least squares curve fitting algorithm to minimise the residual sum of squares ( @xmath19 ) by iteratively varying the parameters of the input functions .",
    "table 1 lists the characteristic velocities , widths and amplitudes of the three gaussian components determined by the fitting routine and fig .",
    "[ figure1 ] shows the derived gaussian fit curves and their sum , plotted with the measured data .",
    "our modelling reveals a broad component of oh emission , superimposed with two narrower peaks at approximately 38,665 and 38,492 km  s@xmath1 in the barycentric rest frame .",
    "the physical interpretation of the line structure is discussed in section [ discussion ] .",
    "we find no statistically significant emission at the redshift - corrected rest frequency of the oh f=1@xmath01 ( 1665-mhz ) line .",
    "the f=2@xmath01 ( 1720-mhz ) oh satellite line is a non - detection , which is unsurprising since the oh satellite lines are very rarely seen in megamaser galaxies @xcite .",
    "we were not able to observe the f=1@xmath02 ( 1612-mhz ) oh satellite line in these observations , as the redshifted rest frequency was outside our observed frequency range .",
    "the continuum peak flux density of the source is @xmath20 = 14.4@xmath211.8  mjy , which was determined from an image made from the full 304 mhz frequency band centred at 1551.5  mhz observed with beta .",
    "this is consistent with published measurements of @xmath20 = 21.1@xmath211.4  mjy at 843 mhz from the sydney university molonglo sky survey @xcite , @xmath20 = 17.6@xmath210.2  mjy at 1.49 ghz @xcite and @xmath20 = 9.6@xmath213  mjy at 5 ghz @xcite using parkes , assuming a spectral index of @xmath6 = @xmath00.5 , which is a typical value for ulirgs at these frequencies .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     the flux density of the parkes continuum source iras  20100@xmath04156 was quoted as 9.6@xmath213 mjy @xcite .",
    "this very large ( 30% ) uncertainty in the parkes flux scale could potentially account for the apparent drop in the oh flux density between the 1988 epoch and subsequent observations listed in table [ table3 ] .",
    "instrumental changes and differences in absolute flux scales notwithstanding , the changes in the oh line profile shape point to genuine variability in the narrow - line masers , which may be due to ( a ) interstellar scintillation or ( b ) substantive changes in the physical conditions of the maser environment .",
    "this could arise from stochastic changes in the maser gain path length caused by turbulence , or a relative movement of maser clumps relative to the line - of - sight .",
    "alternatively it could be related to a genuine reduction in the background source of radio continuum photons .",
    "previous studies of oh megamasers have in some cases found their narrow - line emission to be variable .",
    "@xcite found a dramatic change in some , but not all , spectral features from iras 21272 + 2514 , which the authors argued were likely to be very compact maser regions ( smaller than 2 pc ) that were undergoing interstellar scintillation . a dedicated monitoring program carried out with askap or meerkat @xcite would be able to to distinguish between these scenarios and disentangle systematic measurement and calibration effects for iras 20100@xmath04156 .",
    "this and previous studies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) have demonstrated that the murchison radio - astronomy observatory has a relatively clean spectral environment , particularly in the frequency range from 700 mhz to 1 ghz .",
    "the maximum redshift probed by the arecibo oh megamaser survey @xcite was effectively set by the rfi environment at arecibo , with an effective lower limit on the observing frequency of 1200 mhz .",
    "the spectral environment was also mentioned as a significant constraint in the green bank telescope oh megamaser survey @xcite . as terrestrial rfi impacts radio observatory sites around the world ,",
    "askap s location and radio - quiet protection @xcite provide the opportunity to search for oh megamasers in the largely unexplored frequency range below 1200  mhz corresponding to @xmath22 .",
    "this work is very encouraging for upcoming searches for megamasers in the deep investigation of neutral gas origins ( dingo ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the first large absorption line survey of h i ( flash ; sadler et al . 2016 , _ in prep .",
    "_ ) with askap .",
    "we have observed the oh megamaser in iras 20100@xmath04156 using beta and the atca .",
    "the oh maser peak flux density is approximately 100  mjy  beam@xmath1 and the continuum flux density at 1.4 ghz ( using beta ) is 14.4  mjy .",
    "we compared the peak flux density , peak velocity and fwhm of the four major spectral features , finding that the parameters agree within the uncertainties of our gaussian model fitting .",
    "this gives us an independent verification of the scientific performance of askap s first - generation phased array feeds .",
    "our atca spectrum reveals at least two narrow - line spectral features that have not previously been reported .",
    "these lie at @xmath0409 and @xmath0562 km  s@xmath1 to the blue - shifted side of the systemic velocity .",
    "there is also a possible pair of weak features on the red - shifted side of the spectrum that warrant further investigation , particularly since one of these lies very close to the redshift - corrected velocity of the oh f=@xmath23 ( 1665 mhz ) transition .",
    "we considered whether the high velocity masers originate from a compact circumnuclear ring or from the agn - driven molecular outflow in iras 20100@xmath04156 .",
    "high - resolution imaging will solve this puzzle , however we note that a 50  pc circumnuclear ring would suggest the presence of an enclosed mass of 3.8@xmath24 .",
    "we studied the variation of the oh spectrum between 1988 and 2015 , finding that the narrow spectral features have varied significantly in that time .",
    "this may be caused by interstellar scintillation or by intrinsic changes in the maser environment .",
    "a dedicated monitoring program carried out with askap or meerkat will be useful to monitor iras 20100@xmath04156 and understand more about the variation in its oh maser emission .",
    "sensitive high - resolution observations of these masers using vlbi will enable us to locate the compact maser spots , confirm the extent of the circumnuclear masers and better constrain the black hole mass .",
