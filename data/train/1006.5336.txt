    "a massive star with main - sequence mass above @xmath4 @xmath0 is thought to end its life as a supernova ( sn ) after forming an fe core at its center .",
    "the sn is triggered by the gravitational collapse of the fe core , thus being called a core - collapse sn .",
    "the mechanism that leads to the final emergence of an sn from the collapse is still under debate but observations show that ejecta of the sn normally has a kinetic energy of @xmath5 erg . currently , however , theoretical attempts to simulate the whole explosion of a core - collapse sn have not obtained explosion energy as large as @xmath6 erg ( see , e.g. , janka et al . 2007 ;",

    "if the explosion energy is low , the inner part of the star falls back onto the central remnant and only the outer part of the star overcomes the gravitational potential .",
    "the idea of the fallback was first introduced by colgate ( 1971 ) and many studies have since investigated the effects of the fallback onto the central remnant , e.g. , black hole formation ( _ e.g. , _",

    "2008 ) . recently ,",
    "more attention has been paid to the outer part , which eventually escapes from fallback , thus being ejected .",
    "the ejecta might be observed as an sn ( _ e.g. , _ fryer et al .",
    "2007 , 2009 ) and could produce the peculiar chemical abundance patterns of extremely metal - poor stars ( _ e.g. , _ iwamoto et al .",
    "2005 ) . as this ejecta has a kinetic energy just above the value required to overcome the gravitational potential , it is expected to have very low energy .",
    "if enough amount of @xmath3ni is also ejected or the ejecta interacts with the circumstellar medium ( fryer et al .",
    "2009 ) , this ejecta might be observed as an sn having very low line velocities .    in this connection ,",
    "the peculiar sn 2008 ha is a suitable object , with sufficient observational data that can be compared with the fallback sn models .",
    "sn 2008 ha was discovered on 2008 november ut 7.17 ( puckett , moore , newton , & orff 2008 ) and was found to be one of the faintest sne ever discovered ( valenti et al .",

    "2009 , hereafter f09 ) .",
    "it was found in an irregular galaxy ugc 12682 at a distance modulus of @xmath7 mag ( f09 ) . adopting a galactic extinction of @xmath8 mag and little host extinction ,",
    "the peak absolute @xmath9-band magnitude was found to be as faint as @xmath10 mag ( f09 ) . from its spectral similarities",
    "to sn 2002cx - like type ia sne , sn 2008 ha was classified as a peculiar type ia sn .",
    "sn 2002cx - like sne make a class of peculiar type ia sne ( see , e.g. , the supplementary information of v09 ; sn 2002cx ( li et al .",
    "2003 ; jha et al .",
    "2006 ) and sn 2005hk ( phillips et al . 2007 ; sahu et al .",
    "2008 ) are well - studied examples of this class ) .",
    "their spectra do not have strong absorptions of si and s at early epochs , which are the characteristic features of normal type ia sne .",
    "line velocities of sn 2002cx - like sne are very low compared with normal type ia sne ( branch et al .",
    "they also have peculiar light curves ( lcs ) , which decline slowly in spite of their low maximum luminosities and do not show a second peak which appears in the @xmath11 and @xmath12 band lcs of normal type ia sne .",
    "sn 2008 ha has additional peculiarities .",
    "the rise time of sn 2008 ha is faster than that of normal type ia sne and the decline of the lc after the maximum is very rapid : @xmath13 mag ( f09 ) is the decline of the @xmath14 band magnitude in 15 days since the @xmath14-band maximum . ] .",
    "line velocities of sn 2008 ha are as low as @xmath15 around the maximum brightness ( v09 ; f09 ) .",
    "thus , the ejecta is expected to have very low energy .",
    "v09 suggested that the ejecta mass is @xmath16 = @xmath17 and the kinetic energy is @xmath18 = @xmath19 erg , while f09 estimated @xmath16 = 0.15 @xmath0 and @xmath18 = @xmath20 erg .",
    "the estimated mass of the ejected @xmath3ni is also as small as @xmath21 @xmath0 ( v09 ) and @xmath22 @xmath0 ( f09 ) .    given the low energy and the small mass of the ejecta as estimated from its spectral features and lc shape as well as its star - forming host galaxy , v09 concluded that sn 2008 ha is not a thermonuclear explosion but a core - collapse sn with fallback .",
    "f09 also pointed out the possibility of the core - collapse origin but did not exclude the possibility of a thermonuclear explosion .",
    "indeed , based on the earliest spectrum observed , foley et al .",
    "( 2010 ) suggested that sn 2008 ha is related to a thermonuclear explosion .",
    "alternatively , pumo et al .",
    "( 2009 ) related sn 2008 ha to an electron capture sn ( nomoto 1984 ) .    in this paper , we show that the properties of sn 2008 ha can be explained well by a fallback sn model .",
    "we first perform numerical calculations of hydrodynamics and nucleosynthesis for several progenitor models . then",
    ", we perform radiative transfer calculations to obtain the bolometric lcs and photospheric velocities of these models to compare them with the observations of sn 2008 ha .    in section 2 , we introduce the pre - sn models .",
    "methods used in our calculations of hydrodynamics , nucleosynthesis , and bolometric lcs are described in section 3 .",
    "we show our results of hydrodynamical calculations in section 4 .",
    "the results are compared with the observed bolometric lc and photospheric velocity of sn 2008 ha in section 5 .",
    "discussion and conclusions are given in section 6 .",
    "the spectra of sn 2008 ha do not show hydrogen lines , which implies the progenitor of sn 2008 ha has lost its h - rich envelope before the explosion . in addition , the identification of he lines in the spectra of sn 2008 ha is very difficult because the lines are overcrowded ( see the supplementary figure 4 of v09 and figure 8 of f09 for line identifications ) .",
    "thus , both a helium star and a carbon + oxygen ( co ) star are possible candidates for the progenitor of sn 2008 ha .",
    "we use pre - sn models of solar metallicity with main - sequence masses of 13 @xmath2 , 25 @xmath2 , and 40 @xmath0 calculated by umeda & nomoto ( 2002 , 2005 ) . as these models",
    "have a h - rich envelope , a he star is constructed by assuming that the whole h - rich envelope is lost either by stellar wind or roche - lobe overflow of a close binary , and only the he core remains at the pre - sn stage .",
    "the boundary between the he core and the h - rich envelope is assumed to be at the location @xmath23(h)@xmath24 ( hereafter , @xmath23(m ) denotes the mass fraction of the element m ) .",
    "we adopt the 25 @xmath0 and 40 @xmath0 models to construct the he star models 25he and 40he , respectively .",
    "the he core masses of 25he and 40he are @xmath25 @xmath0 and @xmath26 @xmath2 , respectively .",

    "the density structures of all the models used in this paper are shown in figure [ ds ] .",
    "calculations of hydrodynamics and nucleosynthesis are performed by using a spherical lagrangian hydrodynamic code with a piecewise parabolic method ( colella & woodward 1984 ) .",
    "the calculation of explosive nucleosynthesis is coupled with hydrodynamics and the adopted reaction network includes 13 @xmath30-particles , i.e. , @xmath31he , @xmath32c , @xmath33o , @xmath34ne , @xmath35 mg , @xmath36si , @xmath37s , @xmath38ar , @xmath39ca , @xmath40ti , @xmath41cr , @xmath42fe , and @xmath3ni ( see also nakamura et al .",
    "2001 for details ) .",
    "the main purpose of the nucleosynthesis calculations is to see how much @xmath3ni is produced at the explosion . for this purpose ,",
    "inclusion of only @xmath30-nuclei is a good approximation because @xmath30-nuclei are the predominant yields of sne .",
    "the equation of state takes into account gas , radiation , coulomb interactions between ions and electrons , @xmath43 pair ( sugimoto & nomoto 1975 ) , and phase transition ( nomoto 1982 ; nomoto & hashimoto 1988 ) . to obtain many @xmath44 relations ,",
    "we compute several hydrodynamical models without following nucleosynthesis and including only gas and radiation in the equation of state .",
    "the omitted physics in the equation of state , such as coulomb interaction , mainly affects the result of nucleosynthesis and does not have much effect on @xmath18 and @xmath45 .    as the explosion mechanism of core - collapse sne",
    "is not yet clear , we initiate the explosion as a thermal bomb ( e.g. , nakamura et al .",
    "we put the thermal energy at @xmath46 in the nucleosynthesis calculations , assuming that the 1.4 @xmath2 neutron star is initially formed and the central remnant is treated as a point gravitational source . here , @xmath47 is the mass coordinate from the center . there",
    "exist several ways to induce sn explosions , e.g. , a kinetic piston ( e.g. , woosley & weaver 1995 ) , but it is suggested that the results of nucleosynthesis are not sensitive to how energy is injected ( aufderheide et al .",
    ". however , note that young & fryer ( 2007 ) reports that the amount of fallback in low energy explosions depends on the method by which explosions are indeuced .",
    "generally , explosions by kinetic piston have less fallback because they tend to create stronger shocks and thus , the difference in the method also affects the yields of the nucleosynthesis .",
    "bolometric lcs are calculated by using an lte radiative transfer code ( iwamoto et al .",
    "this code assumes a gray atmosphere for the @xmath48-ray transport . for the optical radiation transport ,",
    "electron scattering and line opacities are taken into account .",

    "this value has been previously used for the explosion of co stars ( maeda et al .",
    "the gray @xmath48-ray opacity is set to be @xmath50 , which is known to be a good approximation ( axelrod 1980 ) .",
    "positrons emitted by the decay of @xmath3co are assumed to be trapped in situ . to compare with the computed bolometric lcs ,",
    "the observed bolometric lc of sn 2008 ha is constructed as shown in the appendix .",
    "we calculate the hydrodynamics of the explosions and fallback for 25he , 40he , 13co , 25co , and 40co with various input energies . in figure",
    "[ shock ] , the change in the velocity profile shows the propagation of the shock wave .",
    "when the explosion energy @xmath18 is low , the inner part of the progenitor can not overcome the gravitational potential provided by the central remnant and thus falls back on to the remnant .",
    "in such cases , only the outer layers of the progenitor are ejected .",
    "the boundary between the fallback region and the ejecta is determined by whether the velocity of the region exceeds the escape velocity .",
    "we set a mass cut at this boundary to determine @xmath45 .",
    "the expansion of the region above this mass cut eventually becomes homologous .",
    "these homologous models are used for the calculations of the bolometric lcs .    in table",
    "[ tbl1 ] , we summarize @xmath18 and @xmath16 for all our hydrodynamical models and plot them in figure [ etom ] . all the models with fallback",
    "are found to be on the line of either @xmath52 or @xmath53 .",
    "the reason why there exist two relations between @xmath18 and @xmath16 can be understood as due to a difference in the density structure .",
    "the density structure of the progenitor affects the manner of the shock propagation , thus leading to the difference in the @xmath54 relation .",
    "suppose the density structure of the progenitor is expressed as @xmath55 , where @xmath56 is the density and @xmath57 is the radius .",
    "sedov ( 1959 ) showed that a shock wave is accelerated when it is propagating along the density structure with @xmath58 while it decelerates when propagating along the density structure with @xmath59 .",
    "this means that to achieve a certain velocity at a place with a density structure of @xmath60 , more energy is required than the case of @xmath61 . as the escape velocity determines the boundary between the ejecta and the fallback region , the boundary is expected to be closer to the central remnant for the case for @xmath61 than that of @xmath60 if the same energy is injected .",
    "our hydrodynamical models show that if @xmath58 at the boundary between the ejecta and the fallback region , the results follow the relation @xmath62 , and if @xmath63 , they follow @xmath53 . the exact physical reason why @xmath16 and @xmath18 are related as @xmath62 and @xmath53 is still unclear .",

    "considering the fact that we do not see any evidence for the interaction in the spectra of sn 2008 ha and there is no sudden drop in the tail of the lc of sn 2008 ha , which is expected in the interaction - powered sn models and is naturally explained by the nuclear decay of @xmath3co , we think that sn 2008 ha is likely to be powered by the nuclear decay of @xmath3ni and",
    "the circumstellar matter around the progenitor of sn 2008 ha is so thin that the interaction does not become the major energy source of the lc .",
    "however , in conditions such as the mixing of the whole exploding star does not occur , almost all @xmath3ni would fall back to the central remnant and only the interaction between the ejecta and the circumstellar matter would be the energy source to brighten the sn .",
    "we still do not have a clear observational sn with fallback brightened by the interaction , but such sne might be discovered in the future .",
    "we have found a fallback sn model ( 13co_2 ) whose bolometric lc and photospheric velocity are both in good agreement with the observations of sn 2008 ha . the ejecta of the model has very low explosion energies and ejecta masses : ( @xmath18 , @xmath45 ) = ( @xmath229 , @xmath230 ) .",
    "the explosion models from the progenitors of 25co , 40co and 40he are not in agreement with the observations of sn 2008 ha because the photospheric velocities of these models are too high to be compatible with the observed line velocities of sn 2008 ha ( figure [ ttov ] ) .",
    "one might think that a model with sufficiently small @xmath18 can have a low photospheric velocity .",
    "however , as shown in figure [ etom ] , smaller @xmath18 leads to a larger fallback and thus smaller @xmath45 as @xmath62 . in this case",
    ", the velocity of the ejecta , @xmath231 , will not become smaller .",
    "alternatively , the explosion of 25he requires @xmath228 erg to have a rise time similar to sn 2008 ha .",
    "the difference between the successful and the unsuccessful progenitor models to explain sn 2008 ha stems from the difference in the density structure .",
    "as discussed in section 4.1 , the density structure affects the propagation of the shock wave and thus the relation between @xmath18 and @xmath45 .",
    "this means that whether a model can have the appropriate @xmath232 for sn 2008 ha mainly depends on the density structure of the progenitor and not on the progenitor mass .",
    "thus , the main - sequence mass of sn 2008 ha can not be constrained only by hydrodynamical calculations and 13co would not be a unique progenitor candidate for sn 2008 ha .",
    "other progenitor models with appropriate density structures are also expected to reproduce the observational properties of sn 2008 ha .",
    "the fact that faint sne like sn 2008 ha could emerge from the fallback of massive stars is also related to long gamma - ray bursts ( lgrbs ) without accompanied sne ( see also v09 ) .",
    "lgrbs are thought to result from the death of massive stars and the fact that nearby lgrbs are accompanied by bright sne ( e.g. , grb 030329 and sn 2003dh , hjorth et al .",
    "2003 ; grb 100316d and sn 2010bh , chornock et al .",
    "2010 ) is one of the evidence for the scenario that relates lgrbs to the death of massive stars .",
    "however , some lgrbs are not accompanied by sne even though they are close enough to be observed ( e.g. , grb 060614 ( gehrels et al . 2006 ; fynbo et al . 2006 ; della valle et al . 2006 ; gal - yam et al . 2006 ) ) and this is one of the challenging problems of the theory of lgrbs .",
    "several scenarios are proposed , e.g. , a neutron star - white dwarf merger ( e.g. , king et al . 2007 ) and a massive stellar death with a faint / dark sn ( e.g. , tominaga et al . 2007 ) . in this paper , we show that core - collapse sne with fallback can be very faint and reproduce the observations of a faint sn ( sn 2008 ha ) .",
    "this supports the scenario that lgrbs without observed bright sne are accompanied by very faint sne with fallback .",
    "in fact , theories of lgrbs like the collapsar model ( woosley 1993 ) assume black hole formation with an accretion disk and this picture is consistent with our fallback sn model in the sense that most part of progenitors accretes to the central remnant and the central remnant becomes massive enough to be a black hole .",
    "this process could induce an lgrb , and it is possible that an lgrb was actually associated with sn 2008 ha .",
    "we could have missed the lgrb because the jet of the lgrb was not directed to the earth .",
    "in addition , our fallback sn model for sn 2008 ha requires some mixing process to provide the ejecta with @xmath3ni and the jet from the lgrb could have played a role in the mixing .",
    "currently , several sne are reported to have features similar to sn 2008 ha .",
    "sn 2005e is one of the examples ( perets et al .",
    "2010 ; see also figure 7 of f09 ) . as sn 2005e",
    "is found far from the disk of the host galaxy , sn 2005e is unlikely to be a core - collapse sn .",
    "however , its spectra do not show the characteristics of thermonuclear explosions .",
    "thus , sn 2005e is suggested to be a new type of stellar explosion ( perets et al .",
    "perets et al .",
    "( 2010 ) showed that the late phase spectra of sn 2005e contain strong emission lines of [ ] @xmath2337291 , 7323 and suggested that those are the results of ca enrichment in the ejecta .",
    "as this feature is similar to sn 2008 ha ( figure 7 of f09 ) , they suggested that sn 2005e is related to sn 2008 ha .",
    "however , the line velocities of sn 2008 ha ( @xmath234 ) are considerably slower than sn 2005e ( @xmath235 ) .",
    "thus , it is not so obvious that sn 2005e has the same origin as sn 2008 ha",
    ". kawabata et al .",
    "( 2010 ) reported that type ib sn 2005cz is another example of an sn that shows prominent ca emissions and they related it to the core - collapse sn from a low mass ( @xmath236 ) star . in this paper , we suggest that sn 2008 ha is of core - collapse origin .",
    "other sn 2002cx - like sne , sn 2002cx ( li et al .",
    "2003 ; jha et al .",
    "2006 ) and sn 2005hk ( phillips et al . 2007 ; sahu et al . 2008 ) , are considered to be weak thermonuclear explosions while sn 2005e seems to be neither a core - collapse nor a typical thermonuclear explosion ( perets et al .",
    "thus , sn 2002cx - like sne might contain sne with several kinds of origins and other criteria to classify them might be required .",
    "we need more samples of sn 2002cx - like sne to clarify such criteria .",
    "see the supplementary information of kawabata et al .",
    "( 2010 ) for more intensive discussion for these ca - rich sne .",
    "we propose that sn 2008 ha can be a core - collapse sn with fallback .",
    "however , it is not obvious that the features of the intermediate - mass elements that appeared in the earliest spectrum of sn 2008 ha ( foley et al .",
    "2010 ) can be synthesized by our model and this will be investigated in a forthcoming paper ( d. n. sauer et al .",
    "2010 , in preparation ) .",
    "our model does not exclude the possibility that sn 2008 ha is a thermonuclear explosion .",
    "however , simple estimates of @xmath16 by v09 and f09 are far below the chandrasekhar mass limit ( @xmath237 ) , which is required to ignite a thermonuclear explosion of a white dwarf .",
    "however , these estimates assume that the total opacity @xmath196 is constant .",
    "it is possible that the effects of the opacity are large enough to create the appearance of a thermonuclear explosion similar to sn 2008 ha .",
    "if this is the case , the opacity must become very low to match the fast rise of sn 2008 ha as expected from the relation @xmath195 .",
    "other kinds of explosions such as .ia sne ( e.g. , shen et al . 2010 ) or accretion - induced collapses ( e.g. , darbha et al .",
    "2010 ) might also be candidates but there still do not exist sufficient models that are consistent with sn 2008 ha .",
