    "the instrumental fiber diameter is 3  and the spectrophotometrically calibrated spectra cover a wavelength range from @xmath40   , with a instrumental dispersion of 69 km s@xmath16 per pixel .",
    "the nsa provides a re - analysis of the sdss imaging and spectroscopic data for all galaxies with redshifts @xmath39 .",
    "photometry is improved over the standard sdss dr8 photometric catalog as described in @xcite and results in a cleaner sample of dwarf galaxies compared to previous catalogs that include many fragmented pieces of extended massive galaxies .",
    "the spectroscopic data is re - analyzed using the methods of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we only use the emission line measurements in the nsa for quality cuts in signal - to - noise and equivalent width as described below .",
    "in addition to a variety of galaxy parameters , estimates of stellar masses are provided in the nsa .",
    "stellar masses are derived from the ` kcorrect ` code of @xcite , which fits broadband fluxes using templates based on the stellar population synthesis models of @xcite and the nebular emission - line models of @xcite .",
    "masses are given in units of m@xmath41 and we have assumed @xmath42 .    since our goal is to search for dwarf galaxies hosting active massive bhs , we first select sources in the nsa with stellar masses @xmath43 m@xmath1 and obtain 44,594 objects . our mass threshold , while somewhat arbitrary , is approximately equal to the stellar mass of the lmc @xcite , which is the most massive dwarf galaxy satellite around the milky way .",
    "while we do not apply a minimum stellar mass limit , nearly all of the galaxies in our parent sample have @xmath44 m@xmath1 due to the sdss spectroscopic apparent magnitude limit of @xmath45 .",

    "this reduces the number of sources to 25,974 .",
    "we use stellar mass as our primary selection criterion rather than absolute magnitude since galaxies of a given mass can span a wide range in absolute magnitude due to differences in stellar populations .",
    "younger , bluer , star - forming galaxies will be brighter than older , redder , quenched galaxies for a given mass ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "therefore , imposing an absolute magnitude cut would preferentially exclude line - emitting galaxies compared to equivalent galaxies that do not have strong emission lines .",
    "the derived stellar masses are less sensitive to these effects since multiple bands are fit and the sed templates of @xcite include emission lines . however , imposing a stellar mass cut introduces a bias such that blue / star - forming galaxies will be detected over a larger volume than red / quenched galaxies with the same stellar mass ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "there are many ways to identify the presence of an accreting supermassive bh ( see the review in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in this work",
    ", we search for two signatures of active bhs in the optical spectra of galaxies : 1 ) narrow emission - line ratios indicating photoionization by an accreting bh , and 2 ) broad h@xmath5 emission signifying dense gas orbiting a massive bh . after selecting dwarf emission - line galaxies from the nsa (  [ sec : sample ] ) , we retrieve the sdss spectra for the entire sample and analyze them with customized software as described below .",
    "all code was developed in the interactive data language ( idl ) and our fitting routines make use of the non - linear least squares curve fitting package mpfit @xcite .",
    "individual sources flagged by our automated algorithms are subsequently inspected by eye .",
    "before we can look for any signature of an agn , we need to model and remove stellar continuum from the host galaxy , that in almost all cases dominates the total continuum .",
    "the spectra also contain stellar absorption lines .",
    "balmer absorption is of particular concern since we aim to detect potentially weak broad h@xmath5  emission from nuclear activity in the galaxies .",
    "our general approach for modeling the continuum and absorption lines is based on that presented in @xcite .",
    "we fit the galaxy spectra with a non - negative linear combination of simple stellar population ( ssp ) models spanning a range of ages for a given metallicity .",
    "the model templates are the same as those used in @xcite and come from the stellar population synthesis code of @xcite .",
    "the templates include model spectra for 10 different ages ( 0.005 , 0.025 , 0.1 , 0.29 , 0.64 , 0.9 , 1.4 , 2.5 , 5 , and 11 gyr ) and 3 different metallicities ( @xmath54 = 0.008 , 0.02 , 0.05 ) .",
    "each galaxy spectrum is modeled as a combination of ssp templates with a single metallicity and we select the metallicity yielding the best - fit . in the fitting process",
    ", we allow for reddening from dust using the galactic extinction curve of @xcite and gaussian smoothing to match the absorption line widths .    our algorithm for modeling the continuum and absorption lines in each spectrum is an iterative process .",
    "the ssp models do not contain emission lines and so we begin by masking out pixels 5@xmath55 above the continuum in the observed spectra to remove both strong and weak lines .",
    "we then apply a redshift - correction using the redshift derived from emission lines provided in the nsa catalog .",
    "a preliminary model is fit to the resulting spectrum and the two are cross - correlated to determine any redshift offset between the absorption and emission lines . after correcting for the redshift offset , we find the best fit model for each of the 3 model metallicities . the single - metallicity model with the smallest @xmath56 value is selected and used to improve the masking of emission lines .",
    "pixels more than 5@xmath55 above the difference spectrum ( data @xmath57 model ) are excluded in the last round of fitting .",
    "again , we find the best - fit model for each metallicity and select the single - metallicity model with the smallest @xmath56 for our final model of the continuum and absorption line spectrum .",
    "the vast majority of the galaxy spectra are best fit by the sub - solar metallicity model ( @xmath54 = 0.008 ) , which is consistent with studies demonstrating that low - mass galaxies generally have low metallicities ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in the small fraction of cases where absorption lines are",
    "either extremely weak or absent , a third - order polynomial is fit to the continuum .",
    "we subtract this model from the data to produce a pure - emission line spectrum .      in order to identify the spectral signatures of active massive bhs",
    ", we model the emission lines of interest as gaussians .",
    "we are especially interested in detecting any possible broad h@xmath5  component .",
    "luminous unobscured agn powered by supermassive bhs in massive galaxies often exhibit bright , broad h@xmath5  emission that is clearly visible even by eye . however , the broad h@xmath5  signatures from agns with lower - mass bhs hosted by dwarf galaxies will be less pronounced , generally having narrower widths and lower luminosities than their higher mass counterparts .",
    "moreover , any potential broad h@xmath5  feature will be blended with narrow h@xmath5  emission and the surrounding [ n  ii ]  @xmath58 doublet .",
    "therefore , it is vital to carefully model the narrow emission line profile in order to detect any potential broad h@xmath5  emission .",
    "we base our model of the narrow emission line profile on the [ s  ii ]  @xmath59 doublet , which has been shown to be generally well - matched to the line profiles of the [ n  ii ]  @xmath58 doublet and narrow h@xmath5  @xcite .",
    "the [ s  ii ]  doublet is first fit with a single gaussian model with the width of the two lines assumed to be equal and the relative separation between the two lines held fixed by their laboratory wavelengths .",
    "the [ s  ii ]  doublet is also fit with a two - component gaussian model , with the added constraint that the height ratio of the two components must be equal for each line .",
    "if the reduced @xmath56 value from the two - component model is at least @xmath60 lower than that of the single gaussian model , the two - component model is selected .",
    "nearly all of the galaxies in our dwarf sample only require a single gaussian to model the [ s  ii ]  doublet , with only 15 sources preferring a two - component model ( 8 of which turn out to be classified as either a bpt agn or composite , see section [ sec : narrow ] ) .",
    "once we have constructed a suitable model of the [ s  ii ]  doublet , we use it as a template for fitting the narrow lines in the h@xmath5  + [ n  ii ]  complex .",
    "the relative separations between the centroids of the narrow gaussian components are held fixed using laboratory wavelengths and the flux of [ n  ii ]  @xmath616584 to [ n  ii ]  @xmath616548 is fixed at the theoretical value of 2.96 .",
    "we assume the [ n  ii ]  lines have the same width ( in velocity ) as the [ s  ii ]  lines , but generously allow the width of the narrow h@xmath5  component to increase by as much as 25% for the vast majority of cases in which a single gaussian is used to model the narrow line profile . for the small number of sources ( 15/25974 ) with two - component gaussian models for the narrow lines ,",
    "the profiles are strictly scaled from the [ s  ii ]  lines .",
    "the h@xmath5  + [ n  ii ]  complex is fit and the reduced @xmath56 computed . the h@xmath5  +",
    "[ n  ii ]  complex is fit a second time , allowing for an additional broad h@xmath5  component .",
    "if the resulting reduced @xmath56 is improved by at least 20% and the fwhm of the broad h@xmath5  component is at least 500 km s@xmath16 after correcting for the fiber - dependent instrumental resolution , we select the model including broad h@xmath5 .",
    "our choice of 20% improvement in reduced @xmath56 , while somewhat arbitrary , has been used successfully in previous studies ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) and empirically works here .",
    "the modest fwhm requirement is imposed to avoid severe contamination from galaxies undergoing intense star formation that have moderately broadened bases on h@xmath5 .",
    "the procedures described thus far yields a sample of 51 sources flagged as having a broad h@xmath5  component , _ not _ all of which make it into our final sample of broad - line agn candidates as described in section [ sec : broad ] .",

    "is used as a template for fitting h@xmath4 , using the same approach as that for h@xmath5 .",

    "we estimate the bolometric luminosity of an agn corresponding to our minimum detectable broad h@xmath5  luminosity using the conversion between @xmath201 and @xmath202 in equation [ eqn : ha5100 ] @xcite and @xmath203 @xcite .",
    "we caution that these relationships come from studies of more luminous seyfert 1 galaxies and quasars .",
    "nevertheless , we use these relationships and estimate that an agn must have a minimum bolometric luminosity of @xmath204 erg s@xmath16 for us to detect broad h@xmath5  emission ( modulo obscuration from dust ) .    in principle",

    "since maximally accreting bhs are very rare @xcite , it is not surprising that we do not detect such low - mass bhs ( if they exist ) in the limited volume of our sample ( @xmath39 ) . in other words , we can not rule out the existence of @xmath207  m@xmath1  bhs . we just can not detect them via broad h@xmath5  if they are radiating much below their eddington luminosity .",
    "a @xmath208  m@xmath1  bh , on the other hand , only needs to be radiating at @xmath28% of its eddington luminosity to produce detectable broad h@xmath5  within our survey volume .",
    "the nsa , from which we have drawn our parent sample of dwarfs ( section [ sec : sample ] ) , provides a number of galaxy parameters . in figure",
    "[ fig : histograms]b  f , we plot the distributions of various properties for the 136 galaxies that exhibit ionization signatures of bh accretion in their spectra ( i.e. , those galaxies with narrow - line ratios falling in the agn and composite region of the bpt diagram )",
    ". we do not include the 15 broad - line agn candidates falling in the star - forming region of the bpt diagram for the reasons discussed in section [ sec : broad ] . for comparison",
    ", we also show the distributions for our parent sample of emission - line galaxies normalized to the same number sources ( 136 ) , as well as the 35 bpt - agns alone .",
    "by design , the galaxies in our sample have stellar masses @xmath10 m@xmath1 , which is approximately the stellar mass of the lmc @xcite .",
    "while active bhs are preferentially found in more massive galaxies within our parent sample , we do detect active bhs in galaxies 10 times less massive than our threshold with stellar masses comparable to the small magellanic cloud ( smc , @xmath209 m@xmath1 ; * ? ? ?",
    "stellar masses in the nsa are derived from ` kcorrect ` @xcite using galaxy evolution explorer ( galex ) uv and sdss @xmath210 bands combined , and while they do not account for any possible agn contribution , we do not expect the active bhs in our sample to significantly impact stellar mass estimates of the host galaxies .",
    "the use of many broadband filters should help mitigate the contribution from strong emission lines , and the vast majority of sources are type 2 agn that are known to contribute very little continuum emission ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "for the small fraction of type 1 agn candidates , the host galaxy stellar masses could in principle be artificially elevated by a boost in flux from the agn continuum . however , _",
    "hst _ @xmath211-band imaging of two of our broad - line agn candidates ( ids 20 and 123 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) that are also in the sample of low - mass bhs presented by @xcite reveals that the agns in these galaxies contribute @xmath212 of the total flux .",
    "the active galaxies in our sample have a total ( host + agn ) median absolute @xmath52-band magnitude of @xmath213 mag , which is comparable to the lmc ( @xmath214 mag ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and @xmath212 magnitudes fainter than previous samples of low - mass agn .",
    "correcting the median absolute magnitudes to our adopted cosmology ( @xmath42 ) , the @xcite sample of low - mass seyfert 2 galaxies has @xmath215 , and the low - mass seyfert 1 samples of @xcite and @xcite have @xmath216 mag and @xmath217 mag , respectively , after removing the agn contribution .",
    "the colors of our sample of dwarfs hosting active bhs tend to be redder compared to our parent sample of dwarfs .",
    "the distribution of colors remains essentially the same for the parent sample even when applying a mass cut of log @xmath218 , and therefore the color difference between the active sample and parent sample is not a mass effect .",
    "the @xmath219 s of the active galaxies derived from our continuum and absorption line fits are similar to the parent sample ( @xmath20 to 1 with a median of @xmath220 ) , suggesting the redder colors are not due to differences in dust properties .",
    "more likely , the color difference is a selection effect such that the optical diagnostics we are using are not sensitive to accreting bhs in blue galaxies with ongoing star - formation that dominates the emission - line spectra .",
    "in addition to being low - mass , the active galaxies in our sample are physically small , with typical half - light radii @xmath221  kpc .",
    "the distribution of bpt - agn and composites is skewed towards smaller sizes relative to our parent sample of dwarf galaxies .",
    "a similar trend is seen in the distribution of 90%-light radii , suggesting the galaxies hosting active bhs are indeed preferentially compact and this result is not due to the presence of a bright central point source .",
    "single - component two - dimensional srsic fits are also provided in the nsa and the galaxies in our sample span a large range of srsic index , @xmath222 .",
    "relative to our parent sample , a larger fraction of the active galaxies have high-@xmath222 values , although bhs are also found in low-@xmath222 disky galaxies .",
    "figure [ fig : sdssims ] shows the sdss images of a selection of galaxies in our sample with bh accretion signatures .",
    "the fraction of _ optically - selected , active bhs _ in our parent sample of dwarf galaxies is @xmath20.5% ( 136/25974)0.6% . ] .",
    "however , there are a number of obstacles preventing us from determining the true occupation fraction and bh mass function in this low - mass regime .",
    "first of all , our optical diagnostics are only sensitive to actively accreting bhs , and even at their eddington limit low - mass bhs are relatively faint .",
    "furthermore , small galaxies generally have ongoing star formation , gas , and dust that can mask or extinguish the optical signatures of bh accretion .",
    "therefore , while there may an accreting bh present at the center of a galaxy , the total observed line emission in the sdss aperture may be dominated by star formation . indeed , the sdss aperture of 3  is comparable to the median half - light radius of our dwarf galaxy sample . even without significant ongoing star formation ,",
    "agn signatures may be heavily diluted by host galaxy light such that the emission lines are effectively hidden @xcite . additionally , low - metallicty agn , which may be expected in lower - mass galaxies , can fall ( and hide ) in the upper left region of the star - forming plume of galaxies in the [ o  iii]/h@xmath4  versus [ n  ii]/h@xmath5  diagnostic diagram @xcite .",
    "therefore , while we can identify bona - fide agns based on their location in the bpt diagram , the selection of massive bhs is likely highly incomplete .",
    "even if we understand our incompleteness from these effects , to derive a true space density requires that we know the distribution of eddington ratios in these low - mass systems as compared to more massive galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) where we believe the occupation fraction is close to unity .",
    "it is interesting to note , however , that our active fraction is quite similar to that of @xmath223  m@xmath1  bhs radiating at @xmath210% of their eddington limit @xcite .",
    "using broad emission lines to identify agn in dwarf galaxies poses a different set of problems . the broad - line signature is weaker for low - mass bhs and",
    "can be difficult to detect in galaxy - dominated spectra .",
    "there is also the possibility that the broad - line region disappears altogether below some critical luminosity or eddington ratio ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "there are a number of candidate `` true '' type 2 agns ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) that show no sign of a broad - line region in direct or polarized light , and no clear signs of obscuration in x - rays .",
    "it is thus possible that the type 1 fraction drops towards lower luminosity , which could add significant complications in attempting to use these agn as a tracer of the demographics of bhs in dwarf galaxies .",
    "using optical spectroscopy from the sdss , we have systematically assembled the largest sample of dwarf galaxies ( @xmath0  m@xmath1 ) hosting massive bhs to date .",
    "these dwarf galaxies have stellar masses comparable to the magellanic clouds and contain some of the least - massive supermassive bhs known .",
    "contrary to common lore , low - mass , physically small dwarf galaxies can indeed form massive bhs .",
    "we find photoionization signatures of bh accretion in 136 galaxies using the narrow - line [ o  iii]/h@xmath4  versus [ n  ii]/h@xmath5  diagram as our primary diagnostic . of these",
    ", 35 have agn - dominated spectra and 101 have composite spectra suggesting ionization from both an agn and massive stars .",
    "for the small fraction of these active galaxies with detectable broad h@xmath5  emission , we estimate a median virial bh mass of @xmath224  m@xmath1 .",
    "our sensitivity to broad h@xmath5  emission limits our ability to detect broad - line agn with bh masses much below @xmath12  m@xmath1  radiating at less than @xmath210% of their eddington luminosity .",
    "we find broad h@xmath5  in an additional 15 galaxies , yet their spectra exhibit narrow - line ratios consistent with star - forming galaxies .",
    "we caution that at these low - luminosities and low - metallicities , particularly for galaxies with high star formation rates , we are susceptible to contamination from stellar processes .    ultimately , we need a complete census of massive bhs in dwarf galaxies to place stringent constraints on theories for the formation of supermassive bh seeds . while optical diagnostics certainly have a role to play , we need to move towards using alternative search techniques and observations at other wavelengths to make further progress ( e.g. , radio and x - ray ; * ? ? ?",
