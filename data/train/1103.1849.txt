    "coupled oscillators have been used to understand the behavior of systems in physics , chemistry , biology , neurology as well as other disciplines . in particular , they are used to model phenomena such as : josephson junction arrays , multimode lasers , vortex dynamics in fluids , biological information processes , neurodynamics @xcite .",
    "these systems have been observed to synchronize themselves to a common frequency , when the coupling strength between the oscillators is increased @xcite .",
    "although all these phenomena have different dynamics , their synchronization features might be described using a simple model of weakly coupled phase oscillators such as the kuramoto model and variations to adapt it for finite range interactions which are more realistic to represent physical systems @xcite .",
    "but , finite range interactions difficult the analysis and search for analytical solutions . in spite of that , in order to figure out the collective phenomena when finite range interactions are considered , it is of fundamental importance to study and to understand the case of nearest neighbor interactions , which is the simplest form of the local interactions . in this context , a simplified version of the kuramoto model with nearest neighbor coupling in a ring topology , which we shall refer to as locally coupled kuramoto model ( lckm ) , is a good candidate to describe the behavior of coupled systems with local interactions .",
    "the lckm has been used to represent the dynamics of a variety of systems .",
    "specifically , it has been shown that a ladder array of josephson junctions can be expressed by a lckm @xcite .",
    "phase synchronization , in nearest neighbors coupled rssler oscillators and locally coupled lasers where local interactions are dominant , can also be described by the lckm @xcite .",
    "other examples are : the occurrence of travelling waves in neurons , chains in disorders , multi cellular systems in biology , the dynamics of an edge dislocation in a 2d lattice and an antenna array in communication systems @xcite .    while in the kuramoto model of long range interactions one has to get a solution in a mean field approximation , in the local model it is necessary to study the behavior of individual oscillators in order to understand the collective dynamics . due to the difficulty in applying standard techniques of statistical mechanics in order to obtain a close picture of the effect of the local interactions on synchronization , we rely on a simple approach to understand the coupled system with local interactions , by means of numerical study of the temporal behavior of the individual oscillators . in this case ,",
    "numerical investigations provide a good tool to understand the mechanism of interactions at the stage of complete synchronization which in turn helps to get an analytic solution .",
    "earlier studies on the lckm show several interesting features including tree structures with synchronized clusters , phase slips , bursting behavior , saddle node bifurcation and so on @xcite .",
    "it has also been shown that neighboring elements share dominating frequencies in their time spectra , and that this feature plays an important role in the dynamics of formation of clusters in the local model @xcite ; that the order parameter , which measures the evolution of the phases of the nearest neighbor oscillators , becomes maximum at the partial synchronization points inside the tree of synchronization @xcite and a scheme has been developed based on the method of lagrange multipliers to estimate the critical coupling strength for complete synchronization in the local kuramoto model with different boundary conditions @xcite .",
    "in addition , based on numerical investigations , we identified two oscillators which are responsible for dragging the system into full synchronization @xcite , and the difference in phase for this pair is @xmath1@xmath2/2 .",
    "these two oscillators are among two pairs of oscillators which are formed by the four oscillators at the borders between major clusters in the vicinity of the critical coupling .",
    "using these findings we developed a method to obtain a mathematical expression for the estimated value of the critical coupling at which full synchronization occurs , once a set of initial conditions for the frequencies of the @xmath0 oscillators is assigned @xcite .    in this work",
    ", we use the fact that at the stage of full synchronization , all oscillators have a common frequency and the time dependence of the phase difference among neighboring oscillators will vanish . using this",
    "we are able to derive an analytic expression for the phases of oscillators , which shows the actual dependence on the periodic boundary condition .",
    "it is clear that this effect will decrease when the number of oscillators @xmath0 increases , and the result will converge to that of a free chain as @xmath0 tends to infinity @xcite .",
    "even so , both problems are different and have interesting peculiarities when the number of oscillators is finite .",
    "this problem is not a mere detail in a theoretical problem since a ring with a finite number of oscillators has many applications in electronics , coupled lasers and in communications @xcite . in the process of finding the solution , using the saddle node bifurcation which dominates the dynamics at synchronization , we come across two quantities which will permit us to identify the four oscillators at the borders between major clusters , where only two of them will have a phase - lock condition of @xmath3 .",
    "we use the properties of these oscillators and the ones at the boundaries to define a triangle and use its trigonometric properties to derive an analytic formula for the critical coupling .",
    "finally , we can identify directly the pair of oscillators which has the phase - lock condition , which depends only on the set of initial frequencies .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section ii , we introduce the lckm with boundary conditions .",
    "we determine analytically the critical coupling at the stage of complete synchronization .",
    "finally , in section iii we give a conclusion which is based on a summary of the results .",
    "the lckm can be considered as a diffusive version of the kuramoto model , and it is expressed as    @xmath4    with periodic boundary conditions @xmath5 and phase difference @xmath6 for @xmath7 .",
    "the set of the initial values of frequencies @xmath8 are the natural frequencies which are taken from a gaussian distribution and @xmath9 is the coupling strength .",
    "these nonidentical oscillators of system 1 cluster in time averaged frequency , under the influence of the coupling , until they completely synchronize to a common value given by the average frequency @xmath10 at a critical coupling @xmath11 as shown in figure 1 .",
    "at the vicinity of @xmath11 , there are only two clusters of successive oscillators whose borders are nearest neighbors .",
    "the oscillators remain synchronized for @xmath12 when all phase differences and frequencies are constants . in figure 1 , we show the synchronization tree for a system with @xmath13 oscillators , where the elements which compose each one of the major clusters , just before complete synchronization occurs , are indicated in each branch .",
    "these clusters merge into one at @xmath11 where all oscillators have the same frequency .",
    "the major clusters , at the onset of synchronization , just before @xmath11 contain @xmath14 and @xmath15 oscillators , where @xmath16 .",
    "it is not necessary for these clusters to have the same numbers of oscillators .",
    "we point to the oscillators at the border of each cluster , which are formed with successive elements , thus their bordering elements are nearest neighbors , as mentioned above ; i.e , @xmath17 and @xmath18 . an interesting fact emerges here : there is a phase - locked solution , where the phase difference between two oscillators is @xmath19 , and it is always valid for one and only one phase difference .",
    "this can be the difference between phases of any two nearest neighbors of the four oscillators at the border of the clusters at the onset of synchronization @xcite .",
    "however , we can not directly allocate these two oscillators unless we do it numerically .",
    "at this point , we remind the reader that the location of each oscillator corresponds to a well defined entity , characterized by an initial frequency , therefore wondering about the meaning of the location of these borders as well as the position of the boundaries , corresponds to knowing which of the many oscillators in our systems will dominate the dynamics .",
    "thus , the time evolution of the phase differences among neighboring oscillators will be written as @xmath20 where @xmath21 .",
    "we use the fact that at @xmath22 , the quantities @xmath23 , to derive the following expression @xmath24 where , @xmath25 $ ] . according to equation 3 , we need to identify not only the two oscillators , say @xmath26 and @xmath27 , which will phase - lock with @xmath28 , but also the value of the phase difference between the oscillators identified as boundaries to find the critical coupling . in order to tackle this difficulty we depend on numerical simulations of system 1 for different number of oscillators and sets of initial frequencies @xmath8 , as well as on studying the quantity @xmath29 .",
    "it should be noted that the quantity @xmath30 determines the value of the critical coupling and the oscillators locked on @xmath3 at synchronization , for the case of a chain of free ends ( open boundaries ) .",
    "this can be clearly understood from equation 3 , when @xmath31 , and @xmath32 , which coincides with the same index of @xmath33 , and henceforward @xmath34 . however , when periodic boundary conditions are turned on , this fact does not hold true , since @xmath35 can be either positive or negative . therefore , its presence in equation 3 modifies the quantity @xmath36 which matches the same index of the phase difference which locks to @xmath3 , and the oscillators no longer synchronize to a single frequency @xmath37 at a critical coupling defined as @xmath33 . helped by numerical simulations , we can find the four oscillators at the edges of the two clusters at the onset of synchronization , in the vicinity of @xmath11 , and see that only one phase difference is locked to @xmath38@xmath39 at @xmath11 as well as to determine which two oscillators among these four are responsible for the saddle node bifurcation .",
    "when we study numerically the phase differences among neighboring oscillators we find two distinct values among all phase differences , which are characterized by being the absolute maximum and minimum among all phase differences and we shall see that they correspond to the two phase differences of the four oscillators at the borders @xcite .",
    "but , only one of them will have the phase - lock condition of @xmath40 at @xmath11 .",
    "if we now proceed to study the behavior of the quantity @xmath29 , we see that the maximum and minimum values of @xmath29 always coincide with the same indexes of the maximum and minimum of @xmath41 , respectively .",
    "therefore , based on the numerical simulations , we can distinguish two quantities @xmath42 and @xmath43 and their corresponding phase differences @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "any one of them , @xmath42 or @xmath43 can be the absolute maximum or the absolute minimum .",
    "this holds true for the two values @xmath46 and @xmath47 also . comparing between the absolute values of either the two quantities @xmath42 and",
    "@xmath43 or the two quantities @xmath46 and @xmath47 , we can not say which oscillators will have the phase - lock condition . however , we find always , and for any @xmath0 with any sets of @xmath8 , that the signs of @xmath42 and @xmath46 , as well as the corresponding @xmath43 and @xmath47 are always the same , independent of being positive or negative .",
    "figure 2a shows the plot of selected values of @xmath48 versus time at @xmath11 for the same realization of figure 1 .",
    "we can see that @xmath49 for @xmath50 and @xmath51 , for @xmath52 , which is the absolute minimum among all corresponding values of all oscillators .",
    "figure 2b shows the values of @xmath29 versus the positions of oscillators in the chain for the same case of figure 1 , where we clearly see that @xmath53 for @xmath50 is the absolute maximum , while @xmath54 for @xmath52 is the absolute minimum . since these oscillators are obviously special , we shall focus on them in search for the exact solution of the problem .",
    "we see that the maximum and minimum of @xmath29 determine two major cases : @xmath53 and @xmath55 .",
    "once we select the first case , we notice that , again , we encounter two cases .",
    "we shall see that only one of them decides the exact value of the critical coupling .",
    "these two sub - cases are a ) @xmath56 with @xmath57 , and b ) @xmath58 with @xmath59 . for case ( a )",
    "we use three equations from system for @xmath60 and @xmath61 , from which we can write @xmath62 .",
    "this relation correspond to the properties between the angles and sides of a triangle , where the angles and sides are defined as : @xmath63 , @xmath64 and @xmath65 , @xmath66 , @xmath67 and @xmath68 , as shown in figure 4 .",
    "after some manipulation , we get an expression for @xmath45 as    @xmath69    thus , the value of the critical coupling becomes : @xmath70 .",
    "applying the same method to case ( b ) ( @xmath71 with @xmath72 ) , we get @xmath73 . therefore , the value of the critical coupling when @xmath74 and @xmath75 is @xmath76 following the same method for the case @xmath77 and @xmath78 , we find : @xmath79 and @xmath80 .",
    "the value of the critical coupling is again given by equation 5 .",
    "table 1 shows the results from numerical simulations of system 1 which are in good agreement with the values obtained from equation 5 for the same sets of initial frequencies .",
    ".values of @xmath11 from simulation of system 1 and from equation 5 . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     equation 5 allows us to determine whether @xmath81 or @xmath45 has the phase - lock condition @xmath3 at @xmath11 , depending whether the selected value for @xmath11 is @xmath82 or @xmath83 , respectively .",
    "after this is done we can determine the value of @xmath84 , thus showing how the phase difference @xmath85 , consequence of the periodic boundary conditions , influences the dynamics of the system .",
    "we notice from figure 2a that the value of @xmath86 , and it modifies the result of the critical coupling , as expected from equation 3 .",
    "the numerical simulations , for different @xmath0 and for different sets of @xmath87 , show that the system with periodic boundary conditions has a critical value which depends on @xmath0 , and that the influence of @xmath88 decreases as @xmath0 increases which may give indications that it becomes ineffective , but in this case the system never synchronizes at the critical strength given only by the absolute maximum of @xmath29 , as it should be for a free chain .",
    "we find also , that @xmath89 remains different from zero up to @xmath90 .",
    "even though , @xmath89 has a small value , but since it exists , it enforces the oscillators to synchronize approximately as an average of @xmath42 and @xmath43 , which are not in generally equal to each other . for larger values of @xmath0 , we expect that @xmath91 and @xmath31 , and hence the critical coupling is determined by the absolute value of @xmath42 .",
    "as @xmath92 , the system of oscillators in a ring synchronizes at the same value of the coupling strength as a chain of free ends , as expected @xcite .",
    "qualitatively , we can compare the cases of synchronization for a ring and for a free chain for finite number of oscillators in order to understand why the critical coupling depends on both values @xmath93 and @xmath94 for the first case while the free chain only depends on @xmath33 .",
    "if we consider both systems above full synchronization and decrease the coupling strength we observe that a saddle node bifurcation occurs at the critical value and they split into two clusters of unequally number of oscillators in general .",
    "the chain splits into two clusters as shown in figure 5a , where only two oscillators seem to have a new role in the dynamics , @xmath26 and @xmath27 are located in different clusters .",
    "this splitting occurs when the phase difference @xmath95 , and it is the index that maximizes @xmath96 , @xmath97 , @xmath61 and @xmath18 but only one phase difference will be @xmath28 and it can be either @xmath98 or @xmath99 , where the two indexes @xmath100 and @xmath61 match @xmath93 and @xmath94 , respectively .",
    "a priori we do not know which will be . from the previous discussion we can write @xmath101 , where @xmath102 and @xmath103 depends on the periodic boundary conditions , in order to get @xmath104 and @xmath105 and hence @xmath89 `` decides '' which will be the pair of oscillators which phases - lock at @xmath106 . therefore , for finite @xmath0 , the oscillators synchronize at a critical coupling that depends on both quantities @xmath93 and @xmath94 , and this is due to the presence of the periodic boundary conditions . from equations 3 and 5 we can write : @xmath107 , with @xmath108 , where @xmath109 and @xmath110 , and @xmath111 when @xmath112 .",
    "we have studied the synchronization of coupled oscillators in a locally coupled kuramoto model with nearest neighbors coupling with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "particularly , we analyzed the system of oscillators at the stage of complete synchronization .",
    "we see that the dynamics is determined by a particular set of oscillators which are located at the borders of the major clusters which will meet at the critical coupling to form one cluster of all synchronized oscillators . using the boundary conditions we can make a correspondence of the values of some definite quantities @xmath113 _ _ 's _ _ with the sides of a triangle with the aid of some trigonometric properties .",
    "these quantities correspond to those of the border oscillators and their nearest neighbors . using these two quantities",
    ", we derive a mathematical expression for the critical coupling at synchronization .",
    "in addition , we are also able to determine the two oscillators which will have a phase - lock condition of @xmath106 .",
    "all these properties can be calculated a priori since they depend only on the set of initial frequencies @xmath114 .",
