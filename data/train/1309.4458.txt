    "the correlation between stellar mass and gas - phase metallicity in galaxies ( the mass - metallicity , or mz relation ) is sensitive to the processes that regulate their growth .",
    "this relation is shaped by gas outflow and accretion rates , the enrichment of these gas flows , and the star formation efficiency of galaxies @xcite .",
    "it is expected , then , that observations of the mz relation towards low masses and high redshifts will constrain the assembly of galaxies and the metal enrichment of the intergalactic medium ( igm ) .    to date , a complete picture of metallicity evolution has not emerged . while studies focusing on higher mass galaxies at @xmath16 have shown lower metallicities than are seen locally @xcite , evolution below @xmath17 remains unconstrained . in @xcite , we began to probe masses just below @xmath18 at intermediate redshifts ; nevertheless measuring metallicities at higher redshifts ( @xmath19 ) has been challenging because of the requirement for infrared spectroscopy of large , faint samples of galaxies .",
    "although lower masses and metallicities have been reached for some strongly lensed galaxies ( e.  g. @xcite ) , the uncertainties of these measurements are large .    in this letter , we present the mz relation at @xmath20 , derived by stacking 83 galaxies with observations covering the @xmath2   metallicity diagnostic , ( [ ] @xmath3 + [ ] @xmath4)/h@xmath5  @xcite . our sample , which is drawn from _ hubble space telescope _ wide field camera 3 ( wfc3 ; @xcite ) grism observations , reaches @xmath21 at @xmath22 .",
    "by focusing on measurements from stacked spectra , we avoid bias introduced by the requirement that h@xmath5  be detected in each spectrum .",
    "we adopt a @xcite initial mass function ( imf ) and take @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 km s@xmath26 . when reporting measurements of doublet lines ( i.e. [ ] @xmath4 ) , we use `` [ ] '' or `` [ ] '' to refer to both lines .",
    "we use data from the wfc3 infrared spectroscopic parallel ( wisp ) survey , as described by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the wisp survey uses both the g102 ( @xmath27 , @xmath28 ) and g141 ( @xmath29 , @xmath30 ) grisms , enabling measurements of @xmath2  from @xmath22 . as the wisp survey is ongoing ,",
    "we restrict our analysis to 29 fields that have emission - line catalogs and supporting optical imaging , either from wfc3/uvis ( 24 fields ) or from the large format camera @xcite on the 200-inch hale telescope at palomar observatory ( @xmath31 and @xmath32 bands ; 5 fields ) . five - band galaxy spectral energy distributions ( seds ; including _",
    "spitzer_/irac 3.6  photometry for most ) are obtained from photometric catalogs described in @xcite and @xcite .    using the wisp emission line catalogs",
    "@xcite , we identify 128 galaxies with secure redshifts measured from multiple lines . objects with contamination from overlapping spectra were removed , leaving 74 galaxies . of these ,",
    "we exclude five galaxies which have inadequate mass constraints : three fall in the uvis chip gap , one is detected in only one broad - band filter , and one is blended with another object in ground - based @xmath31 and @xmath32 images .",
    "these cuts leave 69 galaxies from wisp .",
    "we supplement this sample with publicly released grism data covering the ultra deep field ( udf ) ; since the udf is observed only in g141 , @xmath2   is covered only for the 25 galaxies between @xmath33 . of these , we exclude three galaxies because of contamination , two because their spectra do not contain emission lines , and one with incomplete imaging near the edge of the udf .",
    "we construct seds for the remaining 19 galaxies using the nine bands of imaging in the hst extreme deep field ( @xcite ) .",
    "photometric catalogs were created by using sextractor @xcite in dual image mode , with f160w as the detection image .",
    "we use mag_auto to estimate the total flux .",
    "errors are increased to account for correlated noise in drizzled data @xcite .    among the 88 galaxies in the combined sample , we identify and remove five agn candidates (  [ agn ] ) .",
    "the mean redshift for the remaining 83 galaxies is @xmath34 .",
    "we measure emission line fluxes from the individual spectra by simultaneously fitting gaussian profiles to the [ ] , [ ] , and h@xmath5lines , as well as h@xmath35  and [ ]  when they are covered . contribution to h@xmath35from unresolved [ ] @xmath36 is taken to be negligible , consistent with our followup spectroscopy ( masters et al . , in prep ) .",
    "each region of the spectrum ( i.e. [ ] , [ ]  + h@xmath5 , h@xmath35 + [ ] ) is also fit with a linear continuum . because the dispersion in the grism spectra diverges from the adopted solution at the red and blue ends , we allow for shifts of up to @xmath37 between the three widely separated groups of emission lines .",
    "we take the redshift from the fit to [ ]  and h@xmath5 .",
    "additionally , since the [ ] @xmath38 doublet is marginally resolved , we fit both lines assuming a 3:1 flux ratio",
    ". finally , the emission lines should be spectrally unresolved with widths set by the size of the galaxy in the dispersion direction . since the dispersion is two times higher in the g102 spectra , we require lines measured in this grism to have widths a factor of two narrower ( in  ) than those of the redder lines .",
    "stellar masses are derived with the fast software @xcite , fitting bc03 @xcite template spectra to our broadband photometry .",
    "we take a grid of stellar population parameters that include : exponentially declining star formation histories with e - folding times ranging from 40 myr to 10 gyr ; ages ranging from 50 myrs to the age of the universe , and @xmath39 for a @xcite extinction curve .",
    "additionally , we use a @xcite imf with metallicities of 0.004 , 0.008 , and 0.02 ( @xmath40 ) .",
    "we removed the emission line contribution to our broadband photometry , estimating the corrections by integrating our continuum subtracted spectra ( see  [ stacking ] ) under the bandpasses that cover the line emission .      in figure [ agn_diagnostics_fig ]",
    ", we use the mass excitation ( mex ) diagram to identify agn that could contaminate our stacked spectra .",
    "this diagnostic uses mass as a proxy for the [ ] @xmath41/h@xmath35   ratio , which is not measured for our sample .",
    "the solid orange lines show the agn threshold from @xcite ; objects above and to the right are classified as agn , and objects between the solid curves at @xmath42 are star - forming / agn composites",
    ". however , the use of the mex diagnostic is compromised by the evolution of the mz relation . at fixed metallicity ( or [ ] /h@xmath5 ) , galaxies at @xmath43 are 1 - 2 dex more massive than @xmath44 galaxies @xcite .",
    "therefore , we expect that the star - forming locus in figure 1 shifts to the right at higher redshifts .",
    "the dashed curve illustrates the possible evolution , by shifting the juneau et al . curves a conservative 1 dex in stellar mass . taking this modified threshold",
    ", we find five agn candidates .",
    "these objects are excluded from further analysis .",
    "we acknowledge that the more aggressive agn selection would slightly modify our mz relation above @xmath45 , increasing the metallicity derived in  [ met ] by 0.03 dex at @xmath46 .",
    "nevertheless , this shift falls within our uncertainties , and does not affect the conclusions drawn in  4 and  5 .    for the galaxies that are undetected in h@xmath5 , we can not rule out an agn for any given object .",
    "however , given the distribution of detections and limits in figure [ agn_diagnostics_fig ] , it is unlikely that a sizable fraction of these galaxies have very high [ ] /h@xmath5  ratios .",
    "we also note that none of the udf galaxies are identified as agn from x - ray counterparts in the @xcite catalog .",
    "therefore , we conclude that stacked spectra will be minimally affected by this contamination .",
    "overall , the low agn content in our sample is consistent with the _ low mass _ , grism - selected objects reported by @xcite .      in order to stack spectra",
    ", we follow a procedure similar to @xcite .",
    "first , we subtract a model continuum for each galaxy , made by masking the emission lines and smoothing with a 30 pixel boxcar .",
    "each spectrum is then normalized by its [ ]  flux , so that all galaxies contribute equally . finally , the spectra are de - redshifted and combined by taking the median .",
    "the relative line fluxes are determined by fitting gaussian profiles .",
    "the measurement follows the same procedure described in ",
    "[ em_line_meas ] , except the widths of the emission lines are allowed to differ from one another because the relative contribution of the g102 and g141 data varies with rest - wavelength .",
    "error spectra are generated by bootstrap resampling the spectra in each mass bin to generate 500 artificial stacks , and taking the rms at each wavelength .",
    "errors on the relative line fluxes are calculated by propagating the uncertainties on the fit parameters .    our sample of 83 galaxies",
    "is divided into four mass quartiles with @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 .",

    "first , since [ ]  and [ ]  are widely separated in wavelength , a dust correction is required .",
    "we estimate extinction by measuring the balmer decrement for each of the five galaxies in our @xmath91 subsample where both h@xmath35  and h@xmath5  are detected ( at @xmath92 significance or greater ) .",
    "consistent with our findings in @xcite , we measure an average h@xmath35/h@xmath5  @xmath93 , with an rms of 1.1",
    ". we also stack all of the 28 galaxies with @xmath94 ; here we find h@xmath35/h@xmath5  @xmath95 , consistent with no dust . in the analysis that follows , we calculate line ratios assuming both no dust , and h@xmath35/h@xmath5  @xmath96 ( with a @xcite extinction curve ) . in the latter case",
    ", the scatter on the balmer decrement is included in the metallicity errors .",
    "second , the flux measured from the h@xmath5   emission line can be artificially reduced by stellar absorption , which is estimated to have an equivalent width ( ew ) of 3 - 4   in similar grism - selected galaxies @xcite .",
    "since our stacked spectra only represent relative line fluxes , we estimate the h@xmath5  ew from the the mean [ ]  ew of the individual stacked galaxies and [ ] /h@xmath5  ratio for that stack .",
    "the values for the rest - frame h@xmath5  ew range from 30 to 110  ( see table [ results_table ] ) .",
    "the relative h@xmath5fluxes are increased by @xmath97 to account for this absorption .",
    "finally , @xmath2  is double - valued ; a single measurement can correspond to either a high or low metallicity .",
    "determining whether a galaxy lies on the high or low metallicity branch can be challenging @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , under the reasonable assumption that metallicity decreases towards lower masses , an average trend is expected : as mass decreases , @xmath2   should increase to log@xmath2   @xmath98 , before turning over and decreasing .",
    "for the first time at high redshift , this trend is observed in figure [ branch_tests ] .",
    "we conclude that the @xmath99 bin marks the  turn - around , \" with the two higher mass bins falling on the upper branch of @xmath2  and the lowest mass bin implying lower - branch metallicities .",
    "the middle panel of figure [ branch_tests ] supports this conclusion ; as in the local universe , the lowest metallicity galaxies have more highly ionized gas , as indicated by higher o32 ( log [ ] / [ ] ) .",
    "we have tested that the results from stacking are robust to scatter between the upper and lower - branch bins .",
    "taking a simulated mz relation with the same slope as we have measured , we adopt an intrinsic metallicity scatter of 0.1 dex ( as at @xmath100 ; @xcite ) and 0.2 dex of scatter in stellar mass due to our typical measurement error .",
    "we find that fewer than 10% of the galaxies in the bins adjacent to the turn - around should be attributed to the opposite @xmath2  branch , and less than 1% of galaxies in our high - mass bin will fall on the lower branch .",
    "this exercise shows that metallicities may be overestimated by 0.03 - 0.04 dex in the @xmath101 bin , and underestimated by the same amount in our lowest mass bin .",
    "we do not apply a correction for this effect , since its amplitude is smaller than our uncertainties .",
    "finally , as detailed in @xcite , different metallicity calibrations of strong - line ratios yield systematically different abundances . in table",
    "[ results_table ] , metallicities are reported on both the kobulnicky & kewley ( 2004 ; kk04 ) and @xcite scale .",
    "in the local universe , metallicity , stellar mass , and sfr form a plane called the fundamental metallicity relation ( fmr ; @xcite ) , in the sense that galaxies with high specific sfrs have lower metallicities . as a result , it is important to consider selection effects when interpreting the mz relation .",
    "for example , uv - continuum or emission - line selected samples may be biased towards higher sfrs and lower metallicities than mass - selected samples .",
    "therefore , we use h@xmath5  luminosity ( measured analogously to the h@xmath5  ew , using the mean [ ]  luminosity and the [ ] /h@xmath5  ratio ) to estimate the sfr for each stack .",
    "the h@xmath5  luminosity is corrected for dust and stellar absorption , and multiplied by 2.86 to obtain the h@xmath35  luminosity .",
    "we then calculate the sfr from the relation in @xcite , converted to a @xcite imf and @xmath102 ) .",
    "however , in order to compare to previous measurements of the star - forming main sequence , we report sfrs for solar metallicity . ] . in table [ results_table ] we list the average sfr in each mass bin .",
    "figure [ mz_fig ] shows that our dust - corrected sfrs lie very close to an extrapolation of the @xmath14 star - forming main sequence from @xcite .",
    "this comparison shows that our grism - selected sample is not likely biased towards high specific sfrs .",
    "remarkably , @xcite report that the fmr does not evolve with redshift ( at least out to @xmath103 ) .",
    "further studies confirm this claim for smaller samples of low mass galaxies @xcite .",
    "using our stack - averaged measurements , we can also test for evolution . in table 1",
    "we list the oxygen abundance , predicted from the fmr in @xcite .",
    "this quantitiy shows excellent agreement with the metallicities calculated on the @xcite calibration ( on which the fmr is defined ) .",
    "we conclude that our sample shows no evidence for evolution of the fmr .",
    "figure [ mz_fig ] shows the mz relation derived from our stacked spectra , for both the dust corrected and uncorrected measurements .",
    "it is clear that the dust correction represents only a small adjustment .",
    "excluding our lowest mass bin , our ( dust corrected ) metallicities are 0.33 , 0.17 , and 0.10 dex lower than the sdss @xmath100 measurement at @xmath104 , and @xmath105 @xcite , suggesting more significant evolution in low mass galaxies . a similar trend has been observed in the intermediate - redshift mz relation ( also shown in figure [ mz_fig ] ; @xcite ) .",
    "in fact , in @xcite we interpreted this evolution as evidence for downsizing , where higher mass galaxies evolve onto the local mz relation at earlier times .",
    "while the uncertainty on the evolution measured by the present data remains large , it is consistent with downsizing .",
    "stacking larger samples of grism spectra can help to reduce the uncertainties , but , at the same time , robust measurements of the local mz relation are needed for @xmath106 . comparison to local dwarf galaxies remains difficult , as most have metallicities derived directly from electron temperatures ( which differ systematically from strong - line metallicities ) , or suffer from uncertainties regarding the @xmath2  branch @xcite .",
    "we also compare our mz relation to the measurement from @xmath13 galaxies reported by @xcite .",
    "these metallicities were measured from the [ ] @xmath41/ h@xmath35  ratio in stacked spectra ( using the @xcite calibration ) , and are converted to kk04 metallicities using @xcite .",
    "figure [ mz_fig ] shows that our mz relation agrees with the results from erb et al .",
    "the somewhat higher metallicities in our data are consistent with the lower redshift ( @xmath107 ) of our sample .",
    "the broad agreement between these measurements suggests that the systematic offsets between metallicity calibrations ( which we removed ) are not drastically different at low and high redshifts . finally ,",
    "while some low mass lensed galaxies have metallicity measurements at these redshifts ( e.g.  @xcite ) , large scatter and many weak upper limits preclude meaningful comparisons .    finally , we compare our data to theoretical models for the mz relation .",
    "following our implementation in @xcite , we show two models calculated from the prescriptions in @xcite .",
    "figure [ mz_fig ] shows that a model regulated by momentum - driven winds predicts a shallower mz slope than an energy - driven wind model .",
    "while we showed in @xcite that the intermediate redshift mz relation is reproduced by momentum - driven winds , the higher redshift relation suggests evolution , as it more closely follows the energy - driven wind model .",
    "it is unlikely that a different choice of metallicity calibration would flatten our observed mz relation to bring it closer in line with momentum - driven winds ; among the widely used strong - line metallicity calibrations , only @xcite and @xcite yield mz relations with significantly shallower slopes compared to a kk04 mz relation .",
    "however , these shallow slopes may be inaccurate , owing to a saturation of the [ ]  @xmath108 diagnostic at high metallicities @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the metallicity errors remain large , so while our data favor energy - driven winds , we can not rule out the shallower slope associated with momentum - driven winds .",
    "we have presented the first measurement of the mz relation from a large sample of low mass , high redshift galaxies .",
    "although emission - line selected , these galaxies are not extreme in their sfrs or metallicities .",
    "rather , our results show excellent agreement with extrapolations of the star - forming main sequence and mz relation at similar redshifts .",
    "we conclude that the low - mass , high - redshift mz relation suggests a downsizing evolution and a preference for feedback from energy - driven winds .",
