    "importantly , both operations are idempotent , @xmath4 and @xmath5 , and closely related to the order : @xmath6 . for standard literature on lattices and semirings",
    "see e.g. @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we consider @xmath7 , the cartesian product of @xmath8 copies of @xmath9 , and equip this cartesian product with operations of taking componentwise @xmath2 : @xmath10 for @xmath11 and @xmath12 , and scalar @xmath13-multiplication : @xmath14 for @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "thus @xmath7 is considered as a semimodule over @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "alternatively , one may think in terms of vector lattices @xcite .",
    "a subset @xmath18 of @xmath19 is said to be _ max - min convex _ , ( or briefly _ convex _ ) , if the relations @xmath20 imply @xmath21 . here and everywhere in the paper",
    "we assume the priority of @xmath13 over @xmath2 . if @xmath22 the set @xmath23 & : = \\{\\alpha \\wedge x\\oplus \\beta \\wedge y\\in \\mmset^{n}|\\,\\alpha , \\beta \\in \\mmset,\\alpha \\oplus \\beta = 1\\ }   \\notag \\\\ \\ & = \\{\\max \\,(\\min ( \\alpha , x),\\min ( \\beta , y))\\in \\mmset^{n}|\\,\\alpha , \\beta \\in \\mmset,\\max \\,(\\alpha , \\beta ) = 1 \\ } , \\label{segm0}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] is called the _ max - min segment _ ( or briefly , the _ segment _ ) _ joining _ @xmath24 _ _  and _ _ @xmath25 like in the ordinary convexity in the real space , a set is max - min convex if and only if any two points are contained in it together with the max - min segment joining them .",
    "the max - min segments have been described in @xcite .",
    "other types of convex sets are max - min semispaces , halfspaces and hyperplanes .",
    "one of the main motivations for the investigation of max - min convex sets is in the study of tropically convex sets , analogously defined over the semiring @xmath26 , which is the completed set of real numbers @xmath27 endowed with operations of idempotent addition @xmath28 and multiplication @xmath29 .",
    "tropical convexity and its lattice - theoretic generalizations , pioneered in @xcite , received much attention and rapidly developed over the last decades @xcite .",
    "another source of interest comes from the matrix algebra developed over the max - min semiring , also known as _",
    "fuzzy algebra _ @xcite .    in this article",
    "we continue the study of max - min convex structures started in @xcite .",
    "we are interested in separation of max - min convex sets by max - min hyperplanes and semispaces .",

    "a _ max - min hyperplane _ ( briefly , a _ hyperplane _ ) is the set of all points @xmath39 satisfying an equation of the form @xmath40 with @xmath41 for @xmath42 , where each side contains at least one term .",
    "the combinatorial structure of hyperplanes is described in @xcite . if the equality in is replaced by a strict ( resp .",
    "non - strict ) inequality , then we obtain an open halfspace ( resp . a closed halfspace ) .",
    "note that any max - min closed halfspace is a max - min hyperplane ( due to @xmath43 ) but not conversely .",
    "one of the main applications of semispaces is in separation results : the family of semispaces is the smallest intersectional basis for the family of all convex sets in @xmath19 @xcite .",
    "separation results by hyperplanes and halfspaces in the tropical convexity and lattice - theoretic generalizations are found in @xcite .",
    "these results are very optimistic : any point can be separated from a closed tropically convex set , and even any two compact non - intersecting convex sets can be separated from each other by two closed halfspaces @xcite . in contrast , @xcite contains a counterexample to separation of a point and a max - min convex set by max - min hyperplanes ( equivalently , by max - min halfspaces ) .",
