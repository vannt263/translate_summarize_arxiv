    "supernova remnants ( snrs ) are thought as the origin of galactic cosmic rays ( crs ) .",
    "the most popular acceleration mechanism at snr is the diffusive shock acceleration ( dsa ) @xcite . to make the galactic crs , a few tens of percent of the explosion energy of a supernova",
    "is converted to the cr energy @xcite .",
    "recent gamma - ray telescopes , such as _ fermi _ and _ agile _ , suggest that middle - aged snrs interacting with molecular clouds likely emit hadronic gamma - rays , which arise from the decay of @xmath0 produced in inelastic collisions of the accelerated protons with molecular clouds @xcite .",
    "this fact supports that the snrs make the bulk of the galactic crs .",
    "_ fermi _ observations revealed that the gamma - ray spectra of the middle - aged snrs have a broken power law form , that the break photon energies are typically @xmath1110  gev , and that the spectral indices above the break energy are different from each other .",
    "several theoretical interpretations of the gamma - ray observations of middle - aged snrs have been proposed . @xcite and",
    "@xcite have investigated the gamma - ray spectrum from molecular clouds illuminated by crs which have escaped from a nearby snr .",
    "they showed that the spectrum is steeper than predicted by dsa at the shock because of the energy dependent diffusion .",
    "in addition , @xcite showed that the spectrum has a broken power law form due to the finite size of the emission region . on the other hand , @xcite recently proposed a possible explanation .",
    "they claimed that in the partially ionized medium , crs accelerated at the shock has a broken power - law spectrum  above the break energy , the damping of waves that resonantly scatter the crs is significant , making the steeper spectrum than below the break energy .    in this paper",
    ", we propose another explanation for the observed middle - aged snrs interacting with molecular clouds , by reinvestigating the distribution of crs that have escaped from an snr .",
    "so far , the point source approximation has been widely adopted . however",
    ", for snrs interacting with molecular clouds , the extension of the cr sources is important . in section  2 , taking into account the effect of a finite - size source , we first provide the distribution of crs that have escaped from a snr .",
    "then , we consider the dynamical evolution of crs interacting with molecular clouds , because the cr spectrum that has escaped from an snr depends on the time evolution of the maximum energy @xcite . in section  3 and section  4 ,",
    "we provide two models of the evolution of the maximum energy .",
    "the gamma - ray spectra from molecular clouds are calculated in section  5 .",
    "section  6 is devoted to a discussion .",
    "in this section , we derive the distribution of the runaway crs at a given distance @xmath2 from the snr center and at a given time @xmath3 from the explosion time , @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the cr momentum .",
    "we here assume that the system is spherically symmetric and the diffusion coefficient in the interstellar medium @xmath6 is spatially uniform and depends on the cr momentum .",
    "then , we solve the diffusion equation given by @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the source term of crs .",
    "considering the escape process @xcite , the crs with a momentum @xmath5 escape from an snr at @xmath9 .",
    "the green function , that is , the solution in the point source case , * @xmath10 * , is @xcite @xmath11 where @xmath12 and @xmath13 now , taking into account the fact that the crs escape from the snr surface @xcite , the source term is replaced with @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the radius where the crs with momentum @xmath5 escape from the snr .",
    "then , we find the solution to equation  ( [ eq : diffusion ] ) as @xmath16 note that @xmath17 has a spectral break at @xmath18 because @xmath19 for @xmath20 , otherwise @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is obtained from @xmath23 below @xmath22 ( @xmath24 ) , the effect of a finite - size source becomes important .    the observed gamma - ray spectrum should be calculated by the volume - integrated cr spectrum . in the case of the snr - molecular - cloud interacting system ,",
    "the emission region is a dense cloud or cavity wall , whose density is high in the region @xmath25 .",
    "considering the stellar wind before the supernova explosion , the inner radius of the molecular cloud @xmath26 is about a few tens of pc @xcite .",
    "the volume - integrated spectrum of crs in the region @xmath25 at the snr age @xmath27 is calculated as @xmath28 substituting eq .",
    "( [ eq : fext ] ) into the above , we obtain @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the error function .",
    "there are four characteristic momentum regimes determined by the comparison between the distances that crs can reach , @xmath31 and @xmath32 , and by the comparison between @xmath33 and @xmath34 ;    1 .",
    "@xmath35 , 2 .",

    "let us define @xmath39 and @xmath40 as the solutions to the following equations : @xmath41 we may expect @xmath42 as long as the momentum dependence of @xmath34 is weak enough and/or @xmath33 is more important .",
    "then , a significant fraction of crs with energies above @xmath39 leave the molecular cloud , while crs below @xmath40 do not essentially reach the cloud .    furthermore , we approximate @xmath43 and @xmath44 for @xmath45 , and @xmath46 and @xmath47 for @xmath48 . then",
    ", for @xmath49 , we obtain @xmath50 for @xmath51 , we obtain @xmath52 note that there is no break at @xmath53 since the effect of a finite - size source is smeared by spatial integration .",
    "the spectral breaks at @xmath53 and @xmath39 come from the finiteness of the source and the emission regions , respectively . to estimate the values of @xmath39 and @xmath40",
    ", we first assume the diffusion coefficient of the interstellar medium @xmath54 where @xmath55 is constant .",
    "cr propagation models require @xmath56 and @xmath57 as the galactic average value @xcite . assuming that @xmath34 and @xmath58 are constant with @xmath5 ( because @xmath5-dependence of @xmath34 is weak ) , the typical value of @xmath40 is estimated as @xmath59 where we assume @xmath60 , and @xmath39 is obtained by replacing @xmath26 with @xmath61 . although @xmath26 is order of @xmath62 , _ agile _ observations show that a few@xmath63 photons come from molecular clouds interacting with the snr , that is , crs with a few gev energies have to reach the molecular clouds . in order for @xmath40 to be smaller than @xmath11  gev/@xmath64",
    ", @xmath34 should be order of @xmath26 .",
    "therefore , the effect of the finite - size source considered here is important . to estimate the values of those momentum breaks",
    ", we need to specify a model of @xmath15 .",
    "however , properties of particle escape depend on models . as we see in section  4 , when the whole snr shell interacts with the molecular cloud , another momentum break @xmath65",
    "should be introduced , which plays a more crucial role than @xmath40 .    given @xmath15 , @xmath66 , and @xmath67",

    "in this section , we consider the case in which a small part of a snr shell interacts with a molecular cloud . in this case , the molecular cloud affect neither dynamical evolution of the system nor the shock environments to confine crs , so that both @xmath15 and @xmath67 are those for an isolated snr which are obtained from @xcite . here",
    "we briefly summarize the results of @xcite . in the framework of dsa",
    ", crs are scattered by the turbulent magnetic field and go back and forth across the shock front .",
    "once crs reach far upstream where the shock front can not be identified as a plane , the crs can not go back to the shock front , that is , the crs escape from the snr . in the context of dsa ,",
    "the diffusion length of cr is @xmath70 , where @xmath71 and @xmath72 are the diffusion coefficient in the vicinity of the shock and the shock velocity , respectively .",
    "the momentum of escaping crs , @xmath73 , is determined by @xmath74 where @xmath75 is the distance of the escape boundary from the shock front .",
    "we assume the bohm like diffusion coefficient @xmath76 and @xmath77 as a geometrical confinement condition , where we adopt @xmath78 throughout the paper @xcite .",
    "then , we obtain @xmath79 although @xmath80 has not been understood in detail , @xmath73 starts to decrease when the sedov phase begins at @xmath81 .",
    "hence we assume that crs with the knee energy , @xmath82 , escape at @xmath81 .",
    "we adopt a phenomenological approach based on the power - law dependence , @xmath83 where @xmath84 is the snr radius at @xmath81 .",
    "we assume @xmath85 in order to @xmath86 at the end of the sedov phase @xcite . from equations .",
    "( [ eq : pesc1 ] ) and ( [ eq : pesc2 ] ) , we obtain @xmath87 moreover , we assume that the number of crs in the momentum range @xmath88 in the snr is @xmath89 where @xmath90 is the proton mass , and that the cr spectrum at the shock front is @xmath91 .",
    "then , in most of the cases , @xmath67 has a single power - law form as @xmath92 the value of @xmath93 depends on the injection model and ranges from @xmath94 to @xmath95 @xcite . from equation  ( [ eq : pesc2 ] )",
    ", we derive @xmath96 using the sedov solution and equation  ( [ eq : pesc2 ] ) , one finds @xmath97 in this model , @xmath15 , @xmath66 and @xmath67 obey single power laws , respectively , so that @xmath69 is simply given by equations  ( [ eq : f ] ) or ( [ eq : f1 ] ) . for @xmath49 , @xmath98 for @xmath51 , @xmath99 where @xmath100 .",
    "in this section , we consider the case in which the whole snr shell interacts with the molecular clouds or cavity wall which are located at @xmath101 .",
    "once the crs encounter the molecular clouds , they all are expected to escape from the snr because the high - density neutral gas damps plasma waves . in this case , the functional forms of @xmath15 and @xmath67 are different from those given in the previous section . at an early epoch ,",
    "the snr does not interact with the molecular clouds and @xmath73 is again determined by equation  ( [ eq : pesc0 ] ) with @xmath77 .",

    "this means that for @xmath109 , @xmath73 rapidly decreases . in other words , crs with @xmath110",

    "( [ eq : pesc3 ] ) , we find @xmath114 for @xmath110 , the spectrum of runaway crs is the same as cr spectrum at the shock because the crs escape almost at the same time . therefore , in this model , @xmath115 is approximately a broken power law , @xmath116 generally speaking , the spectrum is complicated due to four breaks . however , in our cases , almost all the crs can reach the molecular cloud , where @xmath69 essentially has three breaks at @xmath53 , @xmath65 and @xmath39 . if @xmath117 , then @xmath118 has a spectral break due to the break of @xmath119 [ see equation  ( [ eq : f ] ) ] . keeping these in mind ,",
    "we derive for @xmath120 @xmath121 for @xmath122 , @xmath123 for @xmath124 , @xmath125 for @xmath126 , @xmath127 for @xmath128 and for @xmath129 , @xmath130 note that when @xmath65 is small enough , the model 2 is the same as model 1 except for @xmath40 ( compare equations  ( 23 ) with ( 35 ) , or ( 24 ) with ( 36 ) ) .",
    "in this section , specifying model parameters , we calculate the gamma - ray spectrum from a snr interacting with molecular clouds and compare with observed spectra .",
    "we consider model  2 , because observed spectra have no low - energy cutoff . from equations ( [ eq : rd ] ) , ( [ eq : fp ] ) , ( [ eq : dism ] ) , ( [ eq : pbr12 ] ) , ( [ eq : resc2 ] ) , ( [ eq : tesc2 ] ) , and ( [ eq : nesc2 ] ) , one can calculate the cr momentum spectrum . for simplicity",
    ", we assume that the injection model is the thermal leakage model , that is , @xmath131 @xcite , and @xmath132 and @xmath133 for all snrs . using the code provided by @xcite",
    "( see also @xcite ) , we calculate the spectrum of @xmath0-decay gamma rays .",
    "the normalization of the gamma - ray flux is adjusted to fit the data .",
    "figures  [ fig1 ] , [ fig2 ] , [ fig3 ] and [ fig4 ] are the results for w51c , w28 , w44 and ic  443 , respectively .",
    "table  1 is the list of adopted parameters and calculated break momentums .",
    "we find that for all snrs , the observed gamma - ray breaks can be attributed to the momentum break at @xmath65 . for w51c and ic  443 ,",
    "the model predicts second breaks seen around 30  gev and 15  gev , respectively ( see figures  [ fig1 ] and [ fig4 ] ) . for w51c ,",
    "the break comes from the momentum break at @xmath39 that is the effect of a finite - size emission zone , and for ic  443 , the break comes from the momentum break at @xmath53 that is the effect of a finite - size source .",
    "note that @xmath39 was also predicted by @xcite , while other two breaks , @xmath65 and @xmath53 , are first introduced in this paper . for w28 and w44 ( figures  [ fig2 ] and [ fig3 ] ) , @xmath39 and @xmath53",
    "are much smaller than the threshold of the @xmath0 production , so that the spectrum is the same as that of the point source solution ( equation  [ eq : fpoint ] ) .",
    "our model seems consistent with observations for all the snrs .",
    "the observed data are fitted with the same parameters concerning the escape and the acceleration , @xmath108 , @xmath93 , @xmath134 , and @xmath135 .",
    "hence , all the snrs could have the same source spectrum above @xmath136 , required for explaining galactic crs .",
    "the observed diversity of the gamma - ray spectra comes from five parameters related to cr propagation around snrs ( @xmath55 and @xmath137 ) and/or environments ( @xmath26 , @xmath61 , and @xmath27 ) .    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "for the four snrs detected by _ fermi _ , we have shown that they can be explained by an accelerated - cr spectrum with @xmath138 and the corresponding runaway - cr spectrum with @xmath139 .",
    "it is found that @xmath140 also gives acceptable fits .",
    "those spectral indices are consistent with those of the source spectrum of galactic crs , which is implied from galprop @xcite and others ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , within uncertainties in the cr propagation .",
    "the inferred values are somewhat steeper than that predicted by the classical dsa ( @xmath141 ) , and several mechanisms have been proposed to explain such steeper spectra@xcite . however , our results are based on several approximations , and we have investigated only four middle - aged snrs , so that results on indices are not conclusive yet .",
    "further theoretical and observational studies are obviously required in order to discuss underlying acceleration mechanisms and reveal the link between those middle - aged snrs and observed galactic crs .    in order to fit the data , the parameters concerning the diffusion coefficient of crs just around the snr , @xmath55 and @xmath137 , are different from galactic mean values , @xmath56 and @xmath142 ( see table  1 ) .",
    "possible explanation of these discrepancies is that the runaway crs amplify the magnetic fluctuation , so that the diffusion coefficient in the medium with the high cr density can be different from the galactic average .",
    "the higher the cr density is , the more turbulent magnetic field , and the more frequent the scattering of crs , resulting the smaller diffusion coefficient . on the other hand ,",
    "the magnetic turbulence becomes weak if the neutral particles impedes the magnetic - field amplification .",
    "further studies are needed to understand physics of partially ionized interstellar matter illuminated by crs .",
    "some important processes neglected so far should be mentioned . at first , in ",
    "[ sec:2 ] , the diffusion coefficient of crs in the interstellar medium , @xmath6 , is assumed to be spatially uniform and time - independent .",
    "@xcite demonstrated that crs that have escaped from an snr excite plasma waves and reduce the diffusion coefficient @xcite , which is responsible for non - uniform , time - dependent diffusion coefficient .",
    "secondly , in   [ sec:3 ] and   [ sec:4 ] , we assume the diffusion coefficient just around the shock has a form of eq .",
    "( [ eq : d0 ] ) .",
    "although the magnetic field amplification around the shock is studied by the linear analysis @xcite and many numerical simulations @xcite , the saturation of the magnetic - field amplification and the diffusion coefficient has not yet been understood in detail . finally , in   [ sec:3 ] and   [ sec:4 ]",
    ", we assume that the cr spectrum at the shock has a single power law , @xmath91 , at any time .",
    "however , the situation may not be so simple .",
    "the shock compression ratio decreases as the shock velocity decreases . as a result ,",
    "the spectrum becomes steeper with time @xcite .",
    "in addition , neutral particles have great impacts on the magnetic field and the particle acceleration @xcite . moreover , nonlinear dsa should be considered when crs affect the shock structure @xcite , along with properties of magnetic turbulence in magnetic field amplification  @xcite .",
