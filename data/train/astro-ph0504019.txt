    "recycled pulsars  neutron stars that are thought to have been spun up by the accretion of matter from a binary companion  are interesting objects to study .",
    "in addition to their application as excellent clocks for high - precision timing experiments ( davis et al .  1985 ) , progress in our understanding of their origin and evolution continues to be made by large - area surveys of the radio sky .",
    "following wolszczan s ( 1991 ) discovery of two recycled pulsars at high galactic latitudes , johnston & bailes ( 1991 ) demonstrated that the local observable population of these objects should be isotropic , and that low - frequency ( @xmath5  mhz ) large - area surveys would be an excellent means of probing this population .",
    "this prediction was largely borne out by the discovery of @xmath6 recycled pulsars from a number of large - area surveys undertaken in this frequency range by many groups around the world ( see , e.g. , camilo 1995 for a review ) .",
    "more recently , sensitive surveys at higher radio frequencies ( @xmath7  ghz ) continue to discover millisecond and recycled pulsars in large numbers at intermediate and low galactic latitudes ( edwards et al .",
    "2001 ; faulkner et al .",
    "2004 ) where interstellar propagation effects limit the galactic volume surveyed at lower frequencies .",
    "the 305-m arecibo telescope has played a key role in low - frequency surveys . between 1993 and 1998 ,",
    "the upgrade to the telescope meant that it was often parked at a fixed azimuth for extended periods .",
    "this provided a unique opportunity to survey the sky as it drifts through the stationary telescope beam at the sidereal rate . at 430 mhz ,",
    "the sky coverage for a declination @xmath8 is @xmath9  deg@xmath0 per day . as a number of groups",
    "were interested in drift - scan surveys ( foster et al .",
    "1995 ; camilo et al .  1996 ; lommen et al .",
    "2000 ; mclaughlin et al .  2002 ) , the available sky was divided up into five zones and the zenith angle of the telescope was changed daily to cover each region uniformly .    in this paper ,",
    "we report on an analysis of data in the regions surveyed by the `` space telescope science institute and national astronomy and ionospheric center '' ( stsci / naic ) collaboration .",
    "a preliminary account of this work was given by xilouris et al .",
    "( 2000 ) . in section",
    "[ sec : obs ] , we describe the survey observations and data analysis procedure . the results , follow - up timing and implications of the ten new pulsars found in the survey , including the new binary pulsar j0407 + 1607 , are detailed in sections [ sec : res ] and [ sec : disc ] .",
    ".[tab : strips ] declination strips covered in the stsci / naic survey . for each strip",
    "we list the central zenith angle ( za ) , gain ( @xmath10 ) , system temperature ( @xmath11 ) of the 430-mhz line feed , approximate limiting flux density ( @xmath12 ) , area of sky covered and the number of new and previously known pulsars detected ( new+old ) . [ cols=\"^,>,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     despite this improved approach , small uncertainties in the assumed position resulted in significant covariances between the orbital parameters and position fits in tempo . fortunately ,",
    "as mentioned above , this pulsar was independently discovered by roberts et al .",
    "follow - up 1400-mhz arecibo observations from that survey resulted in a positional determination which was used as a starting point for the final timing analysis .",
    "the final phase - coherent timing solution presented in table [ tab:0407 ] is the result of a simultaneous fit for spin , astrometric and binary parameters .",
    "the observed minus computed toa residuals for this solution are featureless with a root - mean - square value of 16 @xmath13s .",
    "the dm was determined by including 1400-mhz observations of the pulsar with the wideband arecibo pulsar processor ( dowd , sisk & hagen 2000 ) and , as for the other pulsars , keeping all other model parameters constant in the tempo fit .",

    "2002 ) . performing a standard autocorrelation analysis on the pulsed intensity as a function of time and radio frequency ( for details of this technique",
    "see lorimer & kramer 2005 ) we find the characteristic timescale and bandwidth of scintillation to be @xmath18  s and @xmath19  khz respectively",
    ". adopting the expressions given by cordes & rickett  ( 1998 ) for a uniform scattering medium , and taking a distance of @xmath20  kpc derived from the dm and the cordes & lazio ( 2002 ) electron density model , we estimate the transverse speed of psr  j0407 + 1607 to be @xmath21  km  s@xmath22 .",
    "although this result is model dependent , it implies a transverse speed which lies at the low end of the distribution known for millisecond pulsars ( nice & taylor 1995 ) . in future",
    "it should be possible to measure the proper motion of this pulsar directly by extending the existing baseline of timing observations .",
    "the predicted proper motion at this distance is @xmath23  mas yr@xmath22 . through simulations with tempo",
    ", we estimate that a direct proper motion measurement of this magnitude through timing techniques will be possible within 3  yr . the effect of proper motion on the observed semi - major axis should also be measurable on a similar timescale , allowing us to place constraints on the orbital inclination angle in future .",
    "the pspm and aoftm data do not provide any information about the polarisation properties of psr  j0407 + 1607 . to investigate this , in march 2002 , we observed the pulsar for 78  min at 430  mhz using the princeton mark iv data recording system ( stairs et al .",
    "2000 ) in narrow - band ( 5  mhz ) mode .",
    "the mark iv data were coherently de - dispersed off - line and the data were calibrated using observations with a noise diode of known flux density and polarisation .",
    "the total intensity , linear and circularly polarised pulse profiles are shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : pol ] .",
    "relative to the total intensity , we find that both the linear polarisation and modulus of the circularly polarised component have an average value of 13% , typical of other millisecond pulsars ( xilouris et al .",
    "1998 ; stairs , thorsett & camilo  1999 ) . also shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : pol ] is the position angle of the linear polarisation as a function of pulse phase . as for many",
    "other millisecond pulsars the position angle does not follow a smooth s - shape variation expected from the rotating - vector model of radhakrishnan & cooke ( 1969 ) .",
    "a determination of the emission geometry of this pulsar is , therefore , non - trivial .",
    "various observed and derived parameters of the new pulsars are summarised in table  [ tab : derpars ] where we also include estimates of each pulsar s 430-mhz flux density .",
    "these were derived from the pspm profiles using identical procedures to those described by lorimer et al .",
    "( 2002 ) .",
    "in common with results from other arecibo drift - scan surveys ( foster et al .",
    "1995 ; camilo et al .  1996 ; lommen et al .",
    "2000 ; mclaughlin et al .  2002 ) , the new pulsars are relatively faint , nearby objects",
    ". their inclusion in future population syntheses should provide valuable constraints on the low end of the radio pulsar luminosity function . in 1147",
    "deg@xmath0 of sky searched , we detected five recycled pulsars : j0407 + 1607 , j0609 + 2130 , b1534 + 12 , b1913 + 16 and b1937 + 21 .",
    "of the two new discoveries , the binary pulsar j0407 + 1607 is discussed below , while the isolated pulsar j0609 + 2130 was already discussed in detail by lorimer et al .",
    "we simply note here that our detection rate of one recycled pulsar per @xmath24  deg@xmath0 is consistent with that of other arecibo surveys ( see camilo  1995 ) .",
    "the youngest pulsar in our sample , with a characteristic age of 116 kyr is psr  j1905 + 0616 . as noted and discussed by kramer et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , this object lies within the bounds of the egret source 3eg  j1903 + 0550 .",
    "an association is unlikely simply due to the large density of pulsars in this region and hence high probability of a chance aligmnent .",
    "in addition , as noted by kramer et al . , the spin - down energy loss of j1905 + 0616 is not large enough to be a likely source of the gamma - ray emission seen .",
    "psr  j0407 + 1607 is coincident with the unidentified egret source 3eg  j0407 + 1610 ( hartman et al .",
    "1999 ) , a relatively weak gamma - ray source with mean flux @xmath25  erg  @xmath26  s@xmath22 above 100 mev ( assuming a photon spectral index of 2 ) . while the variability index ( see mclaughlin et al .",
    "1996 for a definition ) is only 0.19 , and consistent with other egret sources known to be associated with pulsars , our @xmath27 measurement of j0407 + 1607 implies a rate of loss of spin - down energy @xmath28  erg  s@xmath22 .",
    "this can be used to test the validity of an association with 3eg  j0407 + 1610 by calculating the required efficiency @xmath29 of conversion of the pulsar s spin - down luminosity into gamma rays . at the dm - derived distance of 1.3  kpc , and assuming a gamma - ray beaming fraction of @xmath30 sr , we find an incompatible value of @xmath31 . a much smaller distance and/or beaming fraction would be required so that @xmath32 .",
    "we therefore conclude that psr  j0407 + 1607 is most likely _ not _ the source of the gamma rays from 3eg  j0407 + 1610 .",
    "the orbital parameters of the j0407 + 1607 binary system are consistent with standard models of binary evolution ( see , e.g. , phinney & kulkarni 1994 ) in which the radio pulsar has been spun up by the accretion of matter while its companion star was in a red giant phase .",
    "indeed , the observed orbital eccentricity is in excellent agreement with the prediction from phinney s ( 1992 ) relationship between eccentricity @xmath33 and orbital period @xmath34 .",
    "millisecond pulsar ",
    "white dwarf binaries like psr  j0407 + 1607 make excellent probes of the strong equivalence principle ( sep ) .",
    "the sep states that free fall of a body is completely independent of its gravitational self energy .",
    "if the sep is violated , then the ratio of inertial mass to gravitational mass of a falling body differs from unity by an amount @xmath35 .",
    "as originally proposed by damour & schfer ( 1991 ) , and by analogue with nordvedt s earlier tests of the sep in the earth - moon system ( nordvedt 1968a , b ) , a violation of the sep for a pulsar  white dwarf binary would mean that both objects `` fall '' in the local galactic gravitational field at a different rate . as a result ,",
    "a violation would cause a polarisation of the orbital plane toward and parallel to the centre of the galaxy .",
    "following damour & schfer s early work , wex ( 1997 , 2000 ) derived limits on @xmath35 from an ensemble of binary pulsar - white dwarf systems .",
    "as the figure - of - merit for this calculation is @xmath36 , long - period circular orbit binaries like j0407 + 1607 are particularly important members of the ensemble used in the test .",
    "recently , a robust bayesian analysis by stairs et al .",
    "( 2005 ) which uses all known binary pulsars relevant for this test including j0407 + 1607 find a limit on sep violations of @xmath37 .",
    "this new limit is comparable to the weak - field limits found in the earth - moon system ( nordvedt 1968a , b ) .",
    "the observed mass function of psr  j0407 + 1607 is @xmath38  m@xmath2 . assuming a mass for the pulsar in the range 1.31.6  m@xmath2 , the implied companion mass is 0.2  m@xmath2/@xmath39 , where @xmath40 is the unknown inclination angle between the plane of the orbit and the plane of the sky . from extensive studies of other millisecond pulsar binaries with similar orbital characteristics to j0407 + 1607 ( for a recent review , see van kerkwijk et al .",
    "2005 ) it is most likely that the companion to j0407 + 1607 is a low - mass white dwarf .",
    "an inspection of archival palomar data in the digitized sky survey archive reveals no optical counterpart down to the plate limit ( approximately 19th magnitude ) , with the closest object in the field being 8  arcsec ( @xmath41 ) offset from the radio position given in table  [ tab:0407 ] .    to search for a fainter optical counterpart , the field surrounding psr j0407",
    "+ 1607 was observed on october 2003 with the 2.3-m bok telescope at kitt peak using the steward observatory imaging camera in combination with the harris b and v filters .",
    "four 27-min b and four 20-min v images were obtained under non - ideal seeing ( @xmath42 arcsec ) conditions .",
    "all images were bias - subtracted and flat - fielded using the iraf package . for photometry calibration , we selected all stars in a @xmath43 arcmin box around the pulsar location from the usno - b1.0 catalog .",
    "the detection limit was determined to be magnitude 21 in b. this is in good agreement with the 20.9 magnitude of the star identified as 1061@xmath440042921 in the usno - b1.0 catalogue detected at the noise level in our images .",
    "four 20-min exposures were aligned and added to produce the final v image .",
    "we used the published visual magnitude of the nearby stars sa 94@xmath44171 and gd  71 ( landolt 1992 ) to determine the relationship between instrumental and aperture magnitudes . from this procedure , we estimate a limiting apparent visual magnitude for detection of 23 .    at the nominal distance of @xmath20  kpc ,",
    "our upper limit corresponds to an absolute visual magnitude of at least 12.1 .",
    "assuming the companion to be an he white dwarf , we can use the cooling curves computed by hansen & phinney ( 1998 ) to place a lower limit on the age of the white dwarf companion . from an inspection of fig .  13 in their paper",
    ", our current non - detection constrains the cooling age to be @xmath45  gyr , compatible with the 1.5  gyr characteristic age of j0407 + 1607 .",
