    "since its recent discovery ( belokurov et al . 2006 ) , the botes  i ultrafaint dwarf spheroidal galaxy ( ufd ) has been the subject of a number of investigations , aiming at providing insight into the formation and evolution of this system .",
    "located at 66@xmath02 kpc distance from the sun and with an absolute visual magnitude of @xmath16.3@xmath00.2 mag ( mcconnachie 2012 ) , botes  i is one of the brightest ufds found lurking around the milky way , and one of its closest satellites .",
    "the color - magnitude diagrams reveal that its stellar population is old and metal - poor , with age spread ( if any ) limited to a few billion years ( de jong et al .",
    "2008 ; hughes , wallerstein & bossi 2008 ) .",
    "no hi is detected in or around botes  i to a 3@xmath2 upper limit of 180  m@xmath3 within the optical half - light radius ; the resulting hi mass - to - light ratio is , thus , extremely low , less than 0.002  m@xmath3/l@xmath3 , which makes it one of the most gas - poor galaxies known ( bailin & ford 2007 ) .",
    "whichever mechanisms are responsible for gas removal from botes  i , the absence of gas streams or outflowing gas suggests that they have completed long ago .",
    "botes  i also exhibits extremely irregular density contours ( belokurov et al .",
    "2006 ) , which indicates that it is undergoing tidal disruption .",
    "estimates of the dynamical mass enclosed within the half - light radius ( @xmath4 242@xmath021 pc ; mcconnachie 2012 ) have suggested that this extremely low - luminosity system is possibly the darkest milky way satellite , with @xmath5 2.36@xmath610@xmath7  m@xmath3 , when a stellar velocity dispersion of @xmath8  9.0  km s@xmath9 is adopted ( wolf et al .",
    "however , large uncertainties affect this determination and the mass may be sensibly smaller , with a lower limit of 8.1@xmath610@xmath10  m@xmath3 reported by mcconnachie ( 2012 ) , based on koposov et al.s ( 2011 ) lower value for @xmath11 .",

    "they speculate that this may arise from the velocity anisotropy of the stellar population .    despite its small baryonic mass (",
    "the stellar mass is only 2.9@xmath610@xmath13 m@xmath3 , assuming a stellar mass - to - light ratio of 1 ; mcconnachie 2012 ) , botes  i shows a large star - to - star variation in fe abundances ( norris et al .",

    "our _ classical _ models rest on the following assumptions :    1 .",
    "inflow of gas of primordial chemical composition provides the raw material for star formation ; 2 .",
    "galactic outflows remove gas from the system ; 3 .",
    "the stellar initial mass function ( imf ) is constant in space and time ; 4 .",
    "the finite stellar lifetimes are taken into account ( no _ instantaneous recycling approximation , _ ira , is adopted ) .      for the sake of simplicity ,",
    "the rate of gas infall is parametrized as @xmath16 where @xmath17 , the total amount of matter ever accreted , and @xmath18 , the e - folding time - scale , are free parameters of the models .",
    "a smooth accretion of gas is clearly a rough approximation of the true assembly history of galaxies . according to modern theories of galaxy formation ,",
    "in fact , the mass assembly must proceed through discrete episodes and mergers play a key role ( see e.g. conselice 2012 , for a recent review ) .",
    "however , if most of the mass is gathered early on in gaseous subclumps and the stars form mostly _ in situ _ , the chemical properties predicted for the bulk of the stellar population are expected to be quite robust against the simplified mass assembly history implied by equation  ( [ eq : in ] ) .",
    "the gas is turned into stars following a kennicutt - schmidt law ( schmidt 1959 ; kennicutt 1998 ) : @xmath19 where @xmath20 , the efficiency of the process , is a free parameter of the models . to be precise , the original kennicutt ( 1998 ) law refers to surface densities : @xmath21",

    "we adopt this formulation of the star formation rate , with @xmath26 .",
    "we do not consider a gas density threshold for star formation .",
    "as for the stellar imf , we adopt a kroupa ( 2001 ) imf in the mass range 0.1100 m@xmath3 , unless otherwise stated .",
    "thermal feedback from stars is included by assuming that type ii and type ia supernovae ( sne  ii and sne  ia , respectively ) deposit @xmath27 10@xmath28 erg of energy each into the ism .",
    "the energy injected by a typical massive star via stellar winds during its lifetime ( @xmath29 10@xmath30 erg ; see gibson 1994 , his figure  1 ) is added though it has a negligible effect on the global energy budget . in order to account for radiative energy losses , we assume constant values of the thermalization efficiencies , @xmath31 0.010.1 ( see table  [ tab : mod ] ) .",
    "it is worth stressing that there is not general consensus about these values in the literature ( see e.g. recchi 2014 , for a recent review ) .",
    "furthermore , the heating efficiency is likely to be a time - dependent quantity ( melioli & de gouveia dal pino 2004 ) .    at each time step , we compute the gas thermal and binding energies following bradamante , matteucci & dercole ( 1998 ) .",
    "when the thermal energy of the gas exceeds its binding energy , an outflow develops and the thermal energy of the gas is reset to zero .",
    "the rate of gas loss through the outflow is assumed to be proportional to the star formation rate @xmath32 where @xmath33 is a further free parameter of the models describing the efficiency of the galactic wind . following both theoretical and empirical considerations ( e.g. vader 1986 , 1987 ; recchi , matteucci & dercole 2001 ; martin , kobulnicky & heckman 2002 ) we assume a higher ejection efficiency for the heavy elements freshly synthesised in sn explosions than for the neutral ism ( _ selective winds _ ; marconi , matteucci & tosi 1994 ) ; in particular , we assume @xmath34 2  @xmath35  = 12",

    "a similar conclusion is reached by marcolini et al .",

    ", gas removal ultimately results from ram pressure stripping ( mori & burkert 2000 ) and/or tidal interaction with the milky way ( mayer et al .",
    "we note that our more massive models have low circular velocity , @xmath38 14  km s@xmath9 , 9  km s@xmath9 , that agrees well with the observed values ( 2.49.0  km s@xmath9 , depending on the considered component , see koposov et al .",

    "the cooling time is expected to be ( slightly ) lower than the ( out)flow time and the material entrained in the outflow can possibly leave the galaxy ( see wang 1995 ) .",
    "clearly , the arguments above suffer of important oversimplifications for instance , we do not take into account the role of gas geometry on the development of galactic winds ( the interested reader is referred to recchi & hensler 2013 for a recent reappraisal of this problem ) .",
    "for the purpose of the present work , it suffices to say that in the framework of our classic chemical evolution models the gas entrained in the outflow is assumed to never re - enter the star - forming regions .",

    "one of the most important ingrendients of chemical evolution models are , of course , the stellar yields . in this work ,",
    "we test two different grids of yields for both low- and intermediate - mass stars ( 1  @xmath39/m@xmath40  8) and massive stars ( @xmath41 8  m@xmath3 ) :    1 .   the metallicity - dependent yields from van den hoek & groenewegen ( 1997 ) for single low- and intermediate - mass stars and those from woosley & weaver ( 1995 , their case b ) for core - collapse sne ( our standard choice ) ; 2 .   the metallicity - dependent yields from karakas ( 2010 ) for single low- and intermediate - mass stars and those from kobayashi et al",

    "we adopt the mass assembly and star formation histories of the botes  i candidates and apply the post - processing technique described in romano & starkenburg ( 2013 ) in order to obtain the detailed chemical composition of synthetic botes  i stars in a fully cosmological framework .",
    "we find that for such a small galaxy not all cosmological models are suitable for this post - processing scheme .",

    "chemical inhomogeneities are implemented by taking into account the empirical evidence that a strong correlation exists between the mean linear metallicity @xmath45 and the intrinsic metallicity spread @xmath46 of local group dwarf galaxies and galactic star clusters ( leaman 2012 ) . at each time step , forming stars do not have all the same mean ism metallicity , @xmath45 .",

    "nevertheless , homogeneous models turn out to be very useful : because of the small computational demands , they allow a quick screening of the full parameter space , thus paving the way for more sophisticated , computationally expensive modelling . for the classical dwarf spheroidals and also some ufds of the local group , it has been shown that the position of the peak of the stellar mdf , as well as the shape of its wings and the behaviour of the mean [ @xmath51/fe ] ratio as a function of [ fe / h ] , sensibly constrain the star formation efficiency , gas accretion rate , imf and occurrence of galactic winds in each galaxy ( e.g. lanfranchi & matteucci 2004 ; kirby et al . 2011 ; vincenzo et al .",

    "we consider different amounts of dark matter in the models , ranging from null ( model  boo3 ) to @xmath5210@xmath53  m@xmath3 ( models  boo5boo8 ) . in general , we find that the lower the dark matter content , the higher the probability that sn explosions destroy the system ( this happens when sn explosions unbind all the gas ) , unless extremely low thermalization efficiencies of about 1 per cent are invoked ( cf .",
    "models  boo1 and  boo2 ) .",
    "however , our model  boo3 with zero dark matter content does not undergo disruption .",
    "this is due to the fact that , owing to its extremely shallow potential well , the gas heated by sn explosions escapes the system very early on ( @xmath54  = 275 myr ; see table  [ tab : mod ] , column  12 ) , carrying away a considerable fraction of the thermal energy released by sne before it can accumulate and destroy the system . while our treatment of sn feedback is clearly oversimplified and no firm conclusions can be drawn basing on the results of a single model , our findings provide some food for thought regarding the capability of small stellar systems without dark matter to survive multiple sn explosions .",

    "colour - coding refers to the star formation rate the darker the curve , the higher the star formation rate . it is seen that the ` blobs ' appearing in the density plot are not due to single star formation bursts but , rather , to the coaddition of different models . indeed , each model spans almost the whole metallicity range of actual botes  i stars .",
    "some models can be rejected , as they clearly underestimate the [ mg / fe ] ratio at all metallicities ( see the lower curve in fig .",
    "[ fig : mgfecosmo ] , representative of this category of models ) , but the majority of them predict [ mg / fe ] ratios in reasonable to good agreement with the observations ( e.g. , middle and upper curves in fig .  [",
    "fig : mgfecosmo ] ) .",
    "looking back at the star formation and mass assembly histories predicted by the semi - analytic model , it is seen that :    1 .",
    "models at odd with the observations display large cold gas masses ( of the order of 10@xmath7  m@xmath3 ) and low star formation rates ( @xmath670.001  m@xmath3 yr@xmath9 ) at the epoch of chemical enrichment ; as a consequence , their stellar ejecta are strongly diluted ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : simple ] ) and the predicted mdfs peak at [ fe / h ] values lower than observed .",
    "2 .   a good fit to the observed properties is obtained when accretion and/or loss of matter properly compensate for the star formation activity ; this delicate balance is achieved by a few models .      in figs .",
    "[ fig : inhalpha ] and [ fig : inhother ] we show the behaviour of several abundance ratios as a function of [ fe / h ] predicted by two of our classical models , model  boo5 and model  boo7 ( left and right panels in each figure , respectively ) , when chemical inhomogeneities are implemented following the empirical relation between mean metallicity and intrinsic metallicity spread found for local dwarf galaxies by leaman ( 2012 ; see section  [ sec : inho ] ) .",
    "these two models have been chosen since they predict the lowest ( model  boo5 ) and highest ( model  boo7 ) [ mg / fe ] ratios at any given [ fe / h ] , while their mdfs both agree reasonably well with the observational data .    in model  boo5 the star formation is less efficient and lasts longer than in model  boo7 .",
    "therefore , in model  boo5 the ism gets significantly enriched in iron by sneia , at variance with model  boo7 .",
    "this results in lower element - to - iron ratios for [ fe / h ]  @xmath702.5 for all elements , in better agreement with the bulk of the observations .",
    "a relatively long - lasting star formation seems , hence , favoured in the frame of our models .",
    "also , the spread in the abundance ratios is reasonably well reproduced , with the notable exception of carbon .",
    "it has been suggested ( gilmore et al .",
    "2013 , and references therein ) that this element might suffer a complex evolutionary history , with two distinct enrichment channels active at very low metallicities .",
    "this would explain both the cemp - no and the carbon - normal stars in botes  i. a detailed study of carbon evolution should consider the two different enrichment paths and is beyond the scope of the present paper .",
    "there are a few stars with anomalous abundances in one or more elements other than carbon that can not be explained by our models :    1 .",
    "boo-119 : this star has [ na / fe ]  = 0.73@xmath00.23 , [ mg / fe ]  = 1.04@xmath00.22 , [ ti / fe ]  = 0.80@xmath00.28 ( gilmore et al . 2013 ) .",
    "none of these values can be explained by our models . yet , [ ca / fe ] is normal in this star ( @xmath520.45 dex ) .",
    "boo-127 : our models can not account for the high magnesium - to - iron ratio , [ mg / fe ]  = 0.71@xmath00.09 , measured by feltzing et al . (",
    "2009 ) . however , if [ mg / fe ]  = 0.17@xmath00.18 , as suggested by gilmore et al .",
    "( 2013 ) , or [ mg / fe ]  = 0.11@xmath00.07 ( ishigaki et al .",
    "2014 ) our models can reproduce the data .",
    "the na abundance measured by ishigaki et al .",
    "( 2014 ) for this star , [ na / fe ]  = @xmath140.18@xmath00.15 , is also well explained by the models .",
    "boo-41 and boo-1137 : both have [ ti / fe ]  @xmath71 0.45 dex , well in excess of the values predicted by our models , even when accounting for the fact that the adopted ti yields severely underestimate the trend of [ ti / fe ] versus [ fe / h ] for galactic halo stars ( see romano et al .",
    "2010 , their figure  22 ) .",
    "boo-117 , boo-127 and boo-911 : the nearly solar [ ca / fe ] ratios reported by felzing et al .",
    "( 2009 ) for boo-127 and ishigaki et al .",
    "( 2014 ) for the other two objects can not be explained by our models .",
    "however , higher ratios have been reported , that better match the model predictions .",
    "[ fig : mdfinhom ] shows the mdfs predicted by models  boo 5 and boo7 when chemical inhomogeneities are implemented in the code ( dashed lines ) . adding the inhomogeneities leads to wider theoretical mdfs ( cfr .",
    "[ fig : mdfhom ] ) , that are still broadly consistent with the observed distribution ( grey histogram ) .",
    "we close this section with a note of caution .",
    "combining data sets from different authors , all coming with their different , methodology - dependent systematics , may result in overestimating the intrinsic abundance dispersions , if not even detecting spurious abundance spreads .",
    "the homogeneous analysis of a statistically significant sample of botes  i stars is badly needed to shed light on important issues such as the existence and significance of abundance spreads and the role of sneia in enriching the ism of botes  i , one of the smallest known milky way companions .",
    "the choice of botes  i as a case of study was dictated by several reasons .",
    "first , while it has a total luminosity nearly ten times smaller than the faintest classical dwarfs , it is still one of the brightest among the so - called ufds ( @xmath72=2.8@xmath610@xmath13 m@xmath3 , also in the range of globular clusters ) .",
    "the separation in two classes of the dwarf satellites discovered before and after the advent of the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; york et al .",
    "2000 ) is probably an arbitrary one ( see , e.g. , belokurov 2013 ) ; still we are interested to the chemical evolution of stellar systems that , at face value , have a total stellar mass far too low to retain the sn ejecta ( say , lower than 10@xmath69 m@xmath3 ) . on the other hand , the smaller the total stellar mass of a system , the lower the total number of stars , and , in particular , of stars suitable for chemical analysis ( i.e. red giant branch stars , in the range of distances of dwarf satellites of the milky way ) . in this framework",
    "botes  i appears as a good trade - off system , with the additional advantage of being relatively nearby .",
    "probably , because of the above characteristics it is also among the best studied ufds , in particular from the spectroscopic point of view ( see section  [ sec : data ] )",
    ". hence , relatively abundant observational constraints are available for comparison with chemical evolution models .",
    "finally , the galaxy is completely dominated by very old stars with a small spread in age ( de jong et al .",
    "2008 ; hughes et al . 2008 ) ) , hence the star formation history is quite simple .",
    "we have run and compared different chemical evolution models for botes  i classical models versus models run in a fully cosmological setting , as well as homogeneous versus inohomogeneous models and compared the model predictions with the available observations .    1 .   as for the classical models , we suggest , in agreement with vincenzo et al .",
    "( 2014 ) , that botes  i must have formed through accretion of relatively large amounts of gas ( @xmath7310@xmath7  m@xmath3 ) on very short time scales ( @xmath18  =  50  myr ) and converted into stars less than 1 per cent of its baryons ( see also salvadori & ferrara 2009 ) .",
    "these conditions have to be met in order not to overestimate the metal content of botes  i stars . in the case of the cosmologically - motivated models , lower amounts of diluting gas are needed , because most of the stellar ejecta is stored in a hot ejected component , rather than being mixed directly with the neutral ism .",
    "2 .   at variance with vincenzo et al .",
    "( 2014 ) , we do not find a clear - cut evidence that the gas left over from the star formation process can be expelled from the galaxy through large - scale outflows ; rather , in the classical approach we are left with huge amounts of gas and have to turn to the cosmologically - motivated models to find that the residual gas is most likely stripped by the interaction with the milky way .",
    "though some of the cosmologically - motivated models predict lower than observed [ @xmath51/fe ] ratios in botes  i , the majority of them provide reasonable to good fit to the available data .",
    "looking back at the star formation and mass assembly histories predicted by the semi - analytical model , we find that a delicate balance of mass loss , mass accretion and star formation is needed for the model predictions to agree with the observations .",
    "chemical inhomogeneities are implemented in our code following the empirical relation between mean metallicity and metallicity spread found by leaman ( 2012 ) for dwarf galaxies in the local group . in this framework ,",
    "our capability to reproduce the observed spread in abundance ratios is directly linked to the extent of the variation of the relative yields with metallicity that is expected owing to the adopted stellar nucleosynthesis prescriptions ( see appendix  a ) . 5 .",
    "full ( three - dimensional ) hydrodynamical simulations including stellar feedback and chemical enrichment are needed in order to obtain better insights on issues such as the development of outflows and the establishment of inhomogeneities in botes  i ; we have recently embarked on this kind of computations .    as a final remark",
    ", it is worth stressing that at present high - resolution spectroscopic observations have been obtained only for a small sample of botes  i stars .",
    "this severely hampers our capability of drawing firm conclusions on issues such as the impact of sneia in enriching the ism of botes  i , or the significance of inhomogeneities .",
