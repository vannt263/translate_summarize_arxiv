    "the dilaton in the two formalisms are related by @xcite @xmath94 with @xmath95 defined in ( [ f ] ) . if we ignore the nonperturbative term in the superpotential , then for identical perturbative terms the two formalisms are equivalent .",

    "this is manifest in the classical limit , i.e. for @xmath96 , but also holds true in the general case .",
    "when the nonperturbative terms in the superpotential are included , it is unknown whether the two formalisms are equivalent @xcite .",
    "even with such an equivalence , it may be simpler to build models in one formalism than in the other . in the following subsections many of the results",
    "will be presented in both formalisms . where we consider only the linear superfield formalism .",
    "] however , we will find , in many different cases , that inflation model building is simpler in the linear superfield formalism .",
    "supergravity theories derived from string theory lead to noncanonically normalized kinetic terms . to properly analyze inflation the canonical normalization of the inflaton must be determined .",
    "since the method we will use to build inflation models , to be described in section [ etaprob ] , allows only khler moduli and untwisted matter ( or some mixture thereof ) to be the inflaton , we only consider the canonical normalization of these two types of fields .",
    "the kinetic terms will be given to lowest order in the green - schwarz coefficients .",
    "this is largely unnecessary in the linear superfield formalism since it only requires dropping factors of @xmath97 , factors which have little effect on determining the canonically normalized field . in the chiral superfield formalism ,",
    "however , we must drop factors of @xmath98 .",
    "dropping such factors make determining the canonically normalized field much easier , but make determining flat directions , as we will see in section [ etaprob ] , difficult .",
    "it is usually assumed that matter fields , both untwisted and twisted , have negligibly small values .",
    "we can not necessarily make this assumption for an untwisted matter field when it is the inflaton .",
    "we will , however , always make this assumption for twisted matter .",
    "then , with the khler potential ( [ chikpot ] ) or ( [ kpot ] ) , to lowest order in the green - schwarz coefficients , the kinetic terms for the untwisted matter fields , @xmath29 , are @xmath99 we assume the moduli fields , @xmath27 , are stabilized during inflation ( in section [ modin ] we will see that they are usually stabilized at @xmath100 values ) .",
    "this means that they are effectively constant , their derivatives vanishing , allowing us to ignore the final two terms in ( [ kinterms ] ) .",
    "we also assume that only the inflaton is comparable in size to the moduli fields , the rest of the untwisted matter fields being much smaller and negligible . without loss of generality ,",
    "take the inflaton to be the @xmath101 field , whose kinetic term is then @xmath102 if we ignore the phase , then the canonically normalized inflaton , @xmath103 , is given by @xmath104 where we have used the assumption that the moduli fields are constant .    in the case",
    "where instead a khler moduli field is the inflaton we ignore both twisted and untwisted matter by assuming that they are small , and find , to lowest order in the green - schwarz coefficients , for the kinetic term @xmath105 if we take the real part of @xmath106 to be the inflaton then the canonically normalized inflaton , @xmath103 , is given by @xmath107",
    "string theory places a number of requirements on its effective theory .",
    "we list four that we will require inflation models to abide by .      if we denote both untwisted and twisted matter by @xmath74 , so that @xmath75 , @xmath35 , then modular transformations of the khler moduli and matter fields are defined by @xcite @xmath108 where @xmath109 recall that the @xmath110 are the modular weights and that for untwisted matter fields , @xmath111 , while for twisted matter fields , @xmath112 .. ] the khler potential and superpotential also undergo modular transformations , which are a special case of a khler - weyl transformation @xcite , @xmath113 thus , the superpotential transforms with modular weight equal to 1 .",
    "an important function with modular weight equal to @xmath114 is the dedekind eta function , @xmath115 which tells us that the superpotential transforms as @xmath116 and matter fields transform as @xmath117 .",
    "heterotic string theory is known to be modular invariant to all orders in perturbation theory @xcite .",
    "this means that the effective theory must be as well .",
    "this is assured at tree level since modular transformations are just special cases of khler - weyl transformations and khler - weyl transformations are always symmetries of a tree level supergravity lagrangian @xcite .",
    "field theory loop corrections in general break the modular symmetry , leading to a modular anomaly .",
    "this anomaly is partially canceled by introducing the green - schawz counterterm ( [ vgs ] ) @xcite .",
    "we saw in section [ scalarpots ] that the green - schwarz counterterm is introduced differently in the chiral and linear superfield formalisms . in the chiral superfield formalism , the dilaton , @xmath23 , is modular invariant at tree level , but not so at loop level .",
    "for this reason , the green - schwarz counterterm was introduced so that the combination in ( [ chiy ] ) is modular invariant and the khler potential ( [ chikpot ] ) transforms correctly .",
    "an important advantage of the linear superfield formalism is that the dilaton , @xmath24 , is modular invariant to all orders in perturbation theory .",
    "this allows the green - schwarz counterterm to be introduced as in ( [ ekm ] ) .",
    "as we will see , this will lead to simplifications .",
    "modular invariance also dictates the form of the perturbative term in the superpotential @xcite .",
    "we wrote down its form in ( [ gensp ] ) .",
    "the eta functions in front make sure the superpotential transforms with modular weight 1 , while the eta functions on the end cancel the modular transformations of the @xmath74 s .",
    "massive states in string theory have masses on the order of the string scale ( @xmath118 gev ) . since an effective theory is only relevant far below this scale , all massive fields must be integrated out ( leading to threshold corrections ) .",
    "hence , the effective theory contains only massless fields ( at least , before any fields pick up nonzero vevs ) and can not contain mass terms . from ( [ chipot ] ) or ( [ pot ] )",
    "we see that the superpotential and its derivatives enter the scalar potential squared .",
    "for there to be no dimension two terms in the scalar potential , i.e. no mass terms , each term in the superpotential must be dimension three or greater .",
    "note that this applies only to matter fields , @xmath74 , with moduli not included in the counting .",
    "the method we will use for building inflation models , to be described in section [ etaprob ] , does not allow the dilaton to be the inflaton .",
    "this means that the dilaton must be stabilized , otherwise it can destroy inflation @xcite . by stabilized we mean",
    "that during inflation the dilaton potential must contain a stable minimum .",
    "the method we use to achieve this , known as _ khler stabilization _",
    "@xcite , has been worked out in the linear superfield formalism in some detail @xcite , where it is simpler .",
    "it has also been considered in a chiral superfield formalism without modular invariance @xcite .",
    "we consider only the linear superfield formalism .",
    "we make two further requirements .",
    "first , in the true vacuum the dilaton potential must have a stable minimum with vanishing vacuum energy , and second , the coupling constant for the gauge fields at the string scale , @xmath119 , must take the supersymmetric gut value , @xmath120 .    in the models we will consider",
    "the dilaton dependence during inflation is contained in the overall factor @xmath121 where @xmath122 is the nonperturbative correction in ( [ kpot ] ) . in the true vacuum ,",
    "using gaugino condensates to break supersymmetry and making the usual assumption that all matter fields vanish , we find that the khler moduli are stabilized at the fixed point @xmath123 @xcite .",
    "the scalar potential in the true vacuum is then ( see , for example , @xcite ) @xmath124 where @xmath84 is the @xmath85-function coefficient for the hidden sector condensing gauge group which produces the gaugino condensates , with phenomenologically preferred values @xmath125 @xcite , and @xmath92 was defined in ( [ f ] ) .",
    "finally , the coupling constant for the gauge fields at the string scale , @xmath119 , is given by @xcite @xmath126 where the right hand side is to be evaluated at the true vacuum .",
    "a similar ( and more comprehensive ) analysis of these requirements for the dilaton was made in @xcite , where additional phenomenological constraints were mentioned .",
    "following @xcite we use only the two leading terms for the nonperturbative parameters @xcite , @xmath127 in figure [ plotdil1 ]    ) with a stable minimum at @xmath128 .",
    "( b ) the dilaton potential in the true vacuum ( [ vacpot ] ) with a stable minimum and vanishing vacuum energy at @xmath129 .",

    "in addition to the dilaton , the three khler moduli , @xmath27 , as long as they are not the inflaton , must be stabilized .",
    "in modular invariant theories we are assured that the scalar potential will have stationary points at @xmath123 , @xmath133 .",
    "these two points correspond to fixed points of the modular transformation ( [ modtransf ] ) .",
    "the important question is whether the stationary points are ( stable ) minima .    in the models we will consider the khler moduli dependence is often of the form @xmath134^{-1}=\\left[(t_i+\\bar{t}_i)|\\eta(t_i)|^4\\right]^{-1},\\ ] ] where we have made the usual assumption that the untwisted matter fields , @xmath29 , are negligible compared to the moduli .",

    "only one of these fields will be the inflaton .",
    "the remainder will be given vevs .",
