    "the theoretical description of odd - mass nuclei still remains as a major challenge in nuclear structure as compared to the treatment of even - even nuclei .",
    "nevertheless , odd - mass nuclei provide key information regarding not only odd - even effects associated to pairing correlations but also the  time - odd \" section of the nuclear energy density functional ( edf ) which is of paramount relevance in the dynamical behavior of the nucleus .",
    "in addition , odd - mass nuclei could also be useful to constrain the parameters of energy density functionals ( edfs ) with the aim to reach a reasonable spectroscopic quality .",
    "moreover , the energies , spins and parities of their low - lying one - quasiparticle spectra provide insight into the underlying shell effects .",
    "thus , the properties of odd - mass nuclei and the computational challenge in their evaluation have received renewed attention in recent years ( see , for example , @xcite and references therein ) .    in the context of spontaneous fission @xcite",
    ", it is experimentally observed that the half - lives t@xmath1 of odd - mass nuclei are systematically larger than the ones of their even - even neighbors .",
    "two complementary mechanisms have been proposed to explain this feature : one is the specialization energy @xcite , that modifies the collective potential energy landscape felt by the odd - mass nucleus in its evolution from the ground state to scission as compared to the one of the neighboring even - even companions .",
    "the origin of part of this energy is the assumption that the k quantum number associated with the projection of the angular momentum onto the intrinsic symmetry axis characteristic of any odd - mass quantum state has to be conserved along the fission process .",
    "the reason behind this assumption is that the time scale for fission ( not to be confused with the t@xmath1 value ) is of the order of the one for the strong interaction and , therefore , much shorter than the typical time scales for the electromagnetic processes responsible for the change of the k quantum number .",
    "the second mechanism is the characteristic quenching of pairing correlations caused by the unpaired nucleon that weakens the pairing field strengths , as compared with the fully paired situation , enhancing the collective inertia that strongly depends on the pairing gap .",
    "this enhancement in turn , increases the collective action and , therefore , the spontaneous fission half - life t@xmath1 .",
    "one should also keep in mind , that fission observables are quite sensitive to pairing correlations owing to the strong dependence of the collective inertias on the inverse of the square of the pairing gap @xcite .    within the edf framework , it is customary to describe the transition from a single even - even system to its fragments in terms of several deformation parameters @xcite .",
    "such microscopic ( constrained ) edf calculations already represent a highly demanding computational task .",
    "they are usually carried out using mean - field approximations based on nonrelativistic gogny @xcite , skyrme @xcite and more recently barcelona - catania - paris - madrid ( bcpm ) @xcite as well as relativistic @xcite edfs .",
    "what further complicates the edf description of fission in odd - mass nuclei is the need to consider , for each intrinsic configuration along the fission path , blocked one - quasiparticle wave functions @xcite .",
    "the blocked wave functions break time - reversal invariance which requires the evaluation of time - odd fields .",
    "typically , this requirement represents a factor of two more computing time in the solution of the hartree - fock - bogoliubov ( hfb ) equations as compared to the even - even case where the time - odd fields are zero by construction . on the other hand , due to the ( nonlinear ) self - consistent character of the hfb equations ,",
    "there is no guarantee to obtain the lowest energy solution by blocking the quasiparticle with the lowest one - quasiparticle excitation energy .",
    "therefore , the blocking procedure has to be repeated for several low - lying one - quasiparticle states .    from what has already been mentioned above ,",
    "it is clear that an approximation is required in order to afford the computational cost of the microscopic edf description of fission in odd - mass nuclei . within this context , the equal filling approximation ( efa ) represents a reasonable starting point still preserving time - reversal invariance @xcite .",
    "the efa has been proven to be a fully variational method by recasting it in terms of the language of quantum statistical mechanics and the introduction of a statistical ensemble where one - quasiparticle configurations and their time - reversed companions are present with equal probability @xcite .",
    "one advantage of this point of view is that the results of finite temperature hfb and its extensions to compute collective inertias in the framework of the adiabatic time dependent ( atd ) method @xcite can be used to compute the collective inertias needed to obtain the t@xmath1 values for odd - mass nuclei .",
    "nuclei in the no ( z=102 ) region have attracted considerable attention @xcite thanks to the progress made in the production of super - heavy elements ( see , for example , @xcite and references therein ) but also because of the rich spectroscopic data obtained for them @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we mainly focus on the hfb - efa description of the fission properties in odd - mass nobelium isotopes . to the best of our knowledge",
    "our edf calculations are the first of their kind reported in the literature . for the sake of completeness , we also discuss results for even - even no nuclei .",
    "we have studied the sample of nuclei @xmath0no .",
    "the odd - mass isotopes are considered within the ( constrained ) hfb - efa @xcite while for the even - even ones calculations have been carried out using the standard ( constrained ) hfb framework @xcite .     for the nucleus @xmath3no .",

    "the pairing interaction energy @xmath6 is depicted in panel ( c ) for protons ( dashed lines ) and neutrons ( full lines ) .",
    "the collective gcm ( dashed lines ) and atd ( full lines ) masses are plotted in panel ( d ) . for more details , see the main text . , scaledwidth=46.0% ]    our hfb and/or hfb - efa calculations are based on the parametrization d1 m @xcite of the gogny - edf @xcite .",
    "in previous studies @xcite , we have performed fission calculations for neutron - rich ra , u and pu nuclei as well as for a sample of heavy and super - heavy nuclei for which experimental data exist .",
    "the comparison between the d1s @xcite , d1n @xcite and d1 m @xcite gogny - edfs , with available experimental data and other theoretical results , reveals that the parameter set d1 m represents a reasonable starting point to describe fission in heavy and super - heavy nuclei .",
    "this is quite satisfying as the gogny - d1 m edf does a much better job to reproduce nuclear masses @xcite and , at the same time , seems to keep essentially the same predictive power of the well tested d1s parametrization @xcite to reproduce low - energy nuclear structure data .",
    "however , more work is needed in order to substantiate this conclusion , especially in the case of fission where the d1 m parametrization has been scarcely used .",
    "in particular , in this study we explore , for the first time , the ability of the gogny - d1 m edf framework to capture basic fission properties along the no isotopic chain including not only even - even but also odd - mass nuclei .",

    "for example , the evaluation of the collective inertias relies on approximations that are not fully understood in the finite temperature case which is used to justify the formulas within our efa methodology .",
    "this lack of full understanding leads to phenomenological prescriptions like the one used here to avoid potential divergences when two - quasiparticle energies cross .",
    "another relevant aspect is the kind of treatment used to find the fission path : a dynamical treatment favors stronger pairing correlations than the least energy one employed in the present study and this could substantially change not only the specialization energy but also the collective inertias . finally , the lowering of the first barrier due to triaxiality and its impact on the spontaneous fission life - time in the case of odd - nuclei has still to be elucidated .",
