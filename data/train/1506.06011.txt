    "several studies  @xcite have recently been devoted to the analysis of the ieee  802.11 protocol , both in the unicast and broadcast modes . nonetheless , to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "no model has taken into account the possibility of having buffers to store arriving packets which , due to channel occupancy , can not be transmitted . when using the framework developed in  @xcite , it is impossible to rigorously evaluate the stability of the protocol . in this paper",
    "we use the same key assumption concerning the slots as in  @xcite , but we couple it with a markovian analysis of nodes using the ieee  802.11 back - off with an infinite buffer for the packets .",
    "we discuss how the way of sensing slots on the channel can give rise to two closely related models .",
    "the first one is analyzed in section [ sec : greedy ] and considers the so - called _ greedy mode _ , while the second one in section [ sec : fair ] deals with a _ fair load _ situation . in both cases , ergodicity conditions and the value of the maximum throughput",
    "are obtained .",
    "the waiting time distribution of a packet is tackled in section [ sec : wtg ] .",
    "in contrast to the famous aloha protocol where the back - off does not take into account the activity of the channel , the back - off scheme of ieee  802.11 monitors the channel in order to schedule the transmission of its pending packets . when a node receives a packet to send , it first selects a random back - off number , which indicates the number of mini - slots the node has to wait before transmitting .",
    "a node with a pending packet senses the channel , and decreases its back - off counter by one each time an idle mini - slot is detected .",
    "when its back - off counter reaches the value zero , the node transmits the packet .",
    "the following parameters are ubiquitous in the analytic studies of ieee  802.11 broadcast :    * @xmath1 , the duration of a mini - slot ( ms ) , which is the time needed for a station to sense whether the channel is busy . *",
    "the backoff window size @xmath2 , expressed as a multiple of @xmath1 .",
    "* @xmath3 , the packet duration , a priori larger than @xmath1 .",
    "the three above parameters are really essential in the ieee  802.11 back - off scheme .",
    "they lead to the main assumption that is usually made in the analysis of this scheme ( see@xcite ) , stating that the channel consists in a random succession of _ full slots _",
    "( dedicated to packet transmission ) and _ mini - slots _",
    "( short slots during which the channel is idle ) . to complete the description of the model",
    ", we also need to introduce the following three additional quantities .",
    "* @xmath4 , the poisson arrival rate at a station . *",
    "@xmath5 , the number of stations in the network . *",
    "@xmath6 , the probability that a station will transmit a packet , stressing that this can take place only when its backoff counter has reached zero .",
    "we will return to this parameter later .",
    "this section is devoted to the analysis of the basic component of the network , namely a single station operating in compliance with some of the principles of the ieee  801.11 protocol .",
    "the channel is supposed to be sampled at discrete time instants @xmath7 , so that it is sensed during consecutive time intervals @xmath8 , which are equal either to @xmath3 ( a  _ normal slot _ ) or to @xmath1 ( a  _ mini - slot _ ( see section [ sec : isol ] ) . in some sense , we have thus introduced two embedded time - scales .    in general the selection between these two types of slots",
    "is random : a slot is a normal slot with probability @xmath9 , and a mini - slot with probability @xmath10 .",
    "nonetheless the node is said to be _ greedy _ , since , when the back - off reaches 0 , a transmission takes place in a slot which is then necessarily a normal slot of length @xmath3 .",
    "in particular , this implies that a sequence of slots is not exactly obtained as a pure outcome of repeated bernoulli trials .",
    "now , starting from the basic one - dimensional models proposed in @xcite , we construct a two - dimensional markov chain , taking into account the possibility of waiting queues at the stations .    an arbitrary station ( or node )",
    "will be represented by a stochastic process , which is a two - dimensional random walk @xmath11 , where @xmath7 is an embedded increasing sequence of discrete random times at which the chain is observed .",
    "indeed , at time @xmath7 , @xmath12 stands for the value of the backoff counter and @xmath13 is the number of packets in the waiting queue at a station . the markovian evolution of @xmath14 is described in detail in the next section .",
    "taking into account the definitions given in section [ sec : para ] , the sequence @xmath15 in the so - called _ greedy mode _ satisfies the recursive stochastic relationship @xmath16 +    t{{\\leavevmode\\hbox{\\rm \\small1\\kern-0.35em\\normalsize1}}_{\\{k_{z_i}=0,n_{z_i}>0\\}}},\\ ] ] with @xmath17 where @xmath18 denotes the indicator function and @xmath19 is the event _",
