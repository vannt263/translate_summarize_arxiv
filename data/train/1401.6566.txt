    "as is well known , the most important goal of high energy research is to look for new physics beyond standard model ( bsm ) , and susy may be the most favorable extension of the standard model(sm ) because it can reasonably explain the naturalness problem of higgs and provide a dark matter candidate .",
    "moreover , its existence makes the strong , eletromagnetic and weak interactions to merge into one point at the grand unification scale @xcite .",
    "however , so far , at tevatron and lhc , no susy particles have ever been observed .",
    "one may wonder if the susy model is wrong or should be radically modified .",
    "of course , there is one more possibility that the susy particles have indeed been produced , but are not identified , namely buried in the messy background at hadron colliders .",
    "several authors @xcite notice this possibility and have tried to reanalyze the lhc data and indicated the probability of misidentifying the susy particles .    in the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) and the modified susy models ,",
    "the scalar top quark has two mass eigenstates , @xmath3 and @xmath4 , and the lighter one ( @xmath3 ) is assumed to be the lightest squark .",
    "generally , it is believed that the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) is the colorless neutralino @xmath5 .",
    "the present results of the cms and atlas collaborations for searching scalar top quark can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite , and it is noted that there is still possibility for stop with mass of a few hundreds of gev , e.g. there are windows : @xmath6 gev with @xmath7 , and a heavier stop as @xmath8 .",
    "the literature suggests that considering the 125 gev higgs boson observed at lhc , a sub - tev stop could be allowed by the data @xcite .",
    "it is also widely recognized that the hadron collider is a machine for discovery , whereas the electron - positron collider is for precise measurement and unambiguous confirmation of discoveries .",
    "as long as the susy theory or its modified versions are valid and the stop mass is within the energy ranges of lhc and ilc , the stop pair should be produced at those machines with sufficient detection efficiency . at the hadron colliders ,",
    "the signals of the produced susy particles might be buried in the messy background , so one may turn to the electron - positron collider to search for evidence of their existence .    in literature , it is suggested that the squark @xmath3 is the next - to - lightest supersymmetric particle ( nlsp ) .",
    "if the mass of @xmath3 is not far away from that of lsp , its lifetime could be longer than @xmath9 @xcite , and it can attract a sm quark(anti - quark ) to form a color singlet susy hadron  @xcite : the mesinos after production . for susy mesinos consisting of @xmath3 and a heavy anti - quark @xmath10(q = c ,",
    "b ) , the fragmentation functions were calculable through perturbative qcd , and they were studied by chang et al . @xcite . in their scheme , to reliably determine the initial condition for the evolution differential equation , the sm quark must be heavy so that perturbative qcd can apply .",
    "obviously , the production rate for such processes is much suppressed .",
    "whereas , if the sm constituent quark is light ( u , d , s ) the production rate might be greatly enhanced , however unfortunately then the non - perturbative qcd effects would be dominant , so that the perturbative computation becomes not reliable .",
    "an alternative method for evaluating the production rate of such mesinos is needed .    in this work ,",
    "we focus on the production rate of susy mesino which consists of a heavy scalar quark and a light sm antiquark at @xmath11 colliders .",
    "the production rate of a pair of susy squark - anti - squark at electron - positron collider have been well calculated at the tree - level and loop - level ( see , e.g. @xcite ) , thus the key point is how to calculate the hadronic matrix elements which are fully governed by the non - perturbative qcd . obviously , to directly evaluate the relevant hadronic matrix elements one needs to invoke concrete models . in an interesting scheme we could associate the b - meson production near its threshold which is well measured by cleo  @xcite , belle  @xcite , and babar  @xcite collaborations , with the production of susy mesinos which may be obtained at ilc near their threshold by means of the superflavor symmetry @xcite .",
    "the superflavor symmetry establishes a definite relation between the processes involving heavy mesinos and heavy mesons , where both the mesino and meson contain a heavy constituent and a light quark(anti - quark ) . for the meson case",
    "the heavy constituent is a heavy quark(anti - quark ) of color - triplet(anti - triplet ) fermion @xmath12 or @xmath13 , whereas for the susy mesino case the heavy constituent is a color - triplet(anti - triplet ) scalar . in our earlier work @xcite",
    ", we supposed the heavy constituent to be a heavy diquark ( @xmath14 or @xmath15 ) whose inner structure may manifest as a complicated form factor .",
    "of course , it is more natural to apply the theory to the susy case where the heavy constituent in the mesino is a point - like color - triplet ( anti - triplet ) squark ( anti - squark ) .",
    "once we have the relation , we can associate the production rate of the susy mesinos at ilc with the measured production rates of the b meson at the b - factories or lhcb .    in the heavy flavor mass limit , the qcd contribution in heavy flavor hadron is independent of the heavy flavor s mass and spin .",
    "when we adopt the superflavor symmetry to estimate the production rate of susy mesino , the measured b - meson production rate can be obtained simultaneously .    in the ilc technical design report ( volume ii ) @xcite ,",
    "the top squark @xmath3 is expected to be found as long as @xmath16 . at early stage , ilc will be running at @xmath17 gev with luminosity @xmath18 fb@xmath19 . in this stage",
    ", the @xmath3 mass will be determined to @xmath20 gev and even @xmath21 gev accuracy @xcite .",
    "then its center of mass energy will be upgraded to @xmath20 tev with luminosity @xmath22 fb@xmath19 . at that energy scale",
    ", a susy particle with mass less than @xmath21 tev could be found , and if considering possible r - violation , even heavier susy particles might be observed .",
    "the work is organized as follows : after this introduction where we explicitly introduce our scheme , we formulate the cross sections for susy mesino @xmath23 and heavy sm meson @xmath24 in terms of superflavor symmetry in sec .",
    "ii . in sec .",
    "iii , we present our numerical results along with all input parameters , and we especially show how to associate the mesino production with b - meson at b - factories . the last section is devoted to our conclusion and some discussions .",
    "let us first have a brief review of the superflavor symmetry , and then focus on its application .",
    "georgi and wise extended the heavy quark s spin and flavor symmetry and introduced the superflavor symmetry @xcite .",
    "the superflavor symmetry relates the processes involving a heavy meson made of a heavy quark @xmath25 and a light anti - quark to a heavy fermion ( mesino ) made of a color triplet scalar @xmath26 ( here we suppose it to be a squark ) and a light color anti - triplet quark .",
    "the lagrangian of the heavy triplets with velocity @xmath27 is @xcite @xmath28 putting @xmath29 and @xmath26 altogether into a 5-column vector with a given velocity @xmath27 , one has @xmath30 here",
    "one can write the wavefunctions of the meson and mesino consisting of @xmath31 and @xmath26 as @xmath32 and @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the charge conjugation operator and @xmath35 is the spinor wave function of the @xmath36 bound state .    in the heavy quark effective theory ( hqet )  @xcite , for the transition of @xmath37 , gluons ( or photon ) are exchanged at t - channel and the hadronic transition matrix element can be described by a unique isgur - wise function @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the recoil variable and @xmath40 , @xmath41 are the four - velocities of initial and final heavy mesons . for the production process",
    ", the gluon , photon or @xmath42 ( see in the following ) is exchanged at s - channel and the kinematic region is different as @xmath43 @xcite .",
    "we need to generalize the isgur - wise function to the kinematic region of production , and some discussion about this situation was given in ref .",
    "@xcite .    from the matrix elements of meson and mesino given by georgi and wise @xcite , the corresponding forms at pair production",
    "are @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the isgur - wise function , @xmath46 at zero recoil point .",
    "it is natural to apply the superflavor symmetry to susy hadron production . in the heavy flavor mass limit , in high energy collisions , @xmath47 or stop pairs",
    "are produced , and then @xmath48 and @xmath49 or @xmath3 and @xmath50 hadronize into bound states by attracting antiquark(quark ) from vacuum .",
    "the two different processes ( @xmath51hadron and @xmath52 susy hadron ) can be connected by the superflavor symmetry .",
    "obviously , a heavy quark fragments into a double heavy flavor meson ( for example @xmath53 ) is more suppressed compared with a single heavy meson ( for example @xmath54 ) by a factor of @xmath55 @xcite .",
    "the case of the susy hadron production is similar , i.e. production of mesino @xmath56 is more suppressed than @xmath57 .",
    "a theoretical estimate shows that the so called stoponium can be formed , and the binding energy is about 1 - 3 gev @xcite which is much smaller than the mass of stop and does not affect the phase space of the production .",
    "next we calculate the production rate of @xmath58 near its threshold at ilc , whose low background makes it more advantageous over hadron colliders .      to predict the production rate of the susy mesinos near threshold , one could associate it with the b - meson production near threshold . indeed , we wish to use the data of the b - factory to predict the production rates as @xmath59 where the superscript `` theor '' means the theoretically predicted value and @xmath60 is the measured value at b - factories and @xmath61 is what we expect .",
    "the ratio of @xmath62 can be obtained in terms of the superflavor symmetry , so that one can eventually obtain @xmath61 .",
    "in fact , by the superflavor symmetry we can relate the matrix element @xmath63 to the matrix element @xmath64 , where @xmath65 and @xmath66 are vector currents corresponding to squark - anti - sqaurk and quark - anti - quark productions respectively .",
    "however , there is a serious problem that all the available data about the b - meson productions are not exactly what we need , because the available data are from @xmath67 , namely via the @xmath68 resonances .",
    "instead , we need the data on the direct production of @xmath69 , i.e the contribution of the continuum spectrum near the threshold . the total spectrum on @xmath70 ( defined as @xmath71 ) provided by experimentalists @xcite which is close to 0.3 also can not be used either .    therefore , we can only associate the production rates of mesino with the b - meson production rates , but so far we can not use the data to make a definite prediction yet .",
    "however , we expect our smart experimental colleagues to figure out an elegant way to extract the continuum contribution from the data or directly measure it in the future ( we believe that they will be able to do it ) , then we will obtain more accurate numerical results of the mesino production rate near threshold .",
    "below we will derive the transition amplitudes and cross sections for the processes @xmath11 to @xmath0 and @xmath72 , where @xmath24 and @xmath23 denote the meson and mesino respectively .",
    "for the process @xmath73 at b factories , the collision energy @xmath2 is much less than the mass of @xmath42 , thus the @xmath42 contribution can be safely ignored . by contrast , since in the process @xmath58 , @xmath2 is larger than the mass of @xmath42 , the @xmath42 contribution must also be included .",
    "the differential cross section for b - meson is @xmath74 where only photon contribution is taken into account , and for mesino it is @xmath75 where @xmath76 is the coupling constant between stop and @xmath42 boson , @xmath77 in @xmath78 is the stop mixing angle @xcite , @xmath79 is weinberg angle , @xmath80 is the coupling constant between electron and @xmath42 boson , @xmath81 is the center of mass energy of b factory and @xmath82 is the center of mass energy of ilc .",
    "it is noted that @xmath83 is the spin projections of the electron and position in the initial state and @xmath84 is the spin projections of the produced b mesons or susy mesinos in the final state and @xmath85 is the corresponding final state phase space .",
    ".,scaledwidth=98.0% ]    .,scaledwidth=98.0% ]    fig.[bbmeson ] and fig.[ststbaryon ] show the leading order feynman diagrams for the processes @xmath73 and @xmath58 respectively .",
    "the transition amplitudes , for mesons are @xmath86 and for mesinos are @xmath87\\ , .",
    "\\end{array}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath88 , @xmath89 and @xmath90 are the momenta of the incoming electron and positron , @xmath91 and @xmath92 are the momenta of the outgoing anti - hadron and hadron .",
    "it is noted that the hadronic matrix elements are determined according to the superflavor symmetry as shown in eqs.(5 ) and ( 6 ) .",
    "thus we obtain the cross section for pair productions as @xmath93 the final expression includes the isgur - wise function @xmath94 which determines the hadronic matrix elements and manifests the non - perturbative qcd effects in the hadronization .",
    "as mentioned above , we can not use the data to fix the parameters , so generally we will obtain the values of the isgur - wise function for certain @xmath95 by employing some phenomenological models .",
    "so far , the collider experiments including tevatron and lhc have not set stringent constraints on @xmath96 @xcite yet , and we would assume @xmath96 varying from 200 gev to 500 gev .    in our numerical calculation , @xmath97 gev ,",
    "@xmath98 gev is taken for @xmath99 gev and @xmath100 gev for @xmath101 tev respectively , the running weinberg angle @xmath102 is taken as @xmath103 for @xmath99 gev and @xmath104 for @xmath101 tev , @xmath105 is approximately equal to @xmath106 , the range of mixing angle @xmath107 is uncertain and generally can span in a rather wide range of @xmath108 . following ref .",
    "@xcite , in our computation we take a few special values of @xmath109 as 0 , @xmath110 and @xmath20 .",
    "our results obviously depend on the concrete value of @xmath94 .",
    "we need to extrapolate @xmath38 from a transition region into the annihilation region as @xmath111 , and we can write the isgur - wise function as @xmath112 where the parameters @xmath113 and @xmath114 are calculated in the lattice qcd @xcite .",
    "many authors have calculated the numerical value @xmath38 in different ways@xcite . in their articles",
    "@xmath115 when @xmath116 , and all of their results show that @xmath117 , @xmath118 , @xmath119 and @xmath120 for the processes @xmath121@xcite .",
    "a brief discussion about numerical value of the @xmath94 will be given in the next section .",
    "in tab.[stst500 ] and [ stst1 t ] , we list the production rates of the susy mesinos for various @xmath95-values .",
    ".the cross sections of @xmath122 with the center of mass energy @xmath123=500 gev .",
    "[ stst500 ] [ cols=\"<,<,<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     taking into account of detection efficiency there would be a sufficiently large amount of events to be observed .",
    "following suggestions given in literature , we consider the scalar top quark @xmath3 as the nlsp , thus the mesino which consists of @xmath3 and a sm anti - quark has very distinctive characters .",
    "it is a fermion of baryon number being zero , so it is completely different from the sm baryons .",
    "moreover , as r - parity is conserved , the main decay mode of stop is @xmath124 + sm quark(+others ) where @xmath5 is the lightest susy particle ( lsp ) : the neutralino .",
    "if the mass splitting between stop and neutralino is sufficiently small , the decay channel @xmath125 is restricted by the final state phase space , another probable channel would be @xmath126 which occur via loops . so that it is suppressed .",
    "the main decay mode of the mesino is via the process where @xmath3 transits to @xmath5 by radiating a sm quark which later combines with the constituent anti - quark ( as a spectator ) in the mesino to constitute a sm meson ( either pseudoscalar or vector ) .",
    "thus observable process is that a fermion of @xmath127 transiting to a sm meson plus missing energy .",
    "this signal is very clean and unique , so that from such signal , one can immediately identify the susy mesino . since the stop mesino can be charged ( @xmath3+@xmath128 ) , one can not miss its trajectory .",
    "therefore we expect a stop mesino with a relative long lifetime to be detected at the facilities which will be available in the not - far future .",
    "the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite also suggested that the stoponium may be observed via its decay products @xmath129 and @xmath130 at lhc in the following 14 tev running .",
    "definitely , they are more easily to be observed at ilc due to its clean background .",
    "our numerical computations depend on the the isgur - wise function which manifests the non - perturbative qcd effects .",
    "since the function is phenomenologically introduced it brings up uncertainties to our numerical results .",
    "as we expected , if the continuum contribution to @xmath69 could be extracted from the data or directly experimentally measured , we would be able to greatly reduce the theoretical uncertainties and help to draw definite conclusion .",
    "it is also noted that the updated susy hadron search results given by cms @xcite and atlas @xcite collaborations indicate that susy hadrons lifetimes should be shorter than @xmath131 s if they exist with sub - tev masses .",
    "indeed , if their lifetimes are too short , it is disadvantageous for their detection , but there still is possibility for direct detection of stop mesinos .",
    "we lay hope on the next run of lhc , which may provide information about the susy particles , and look forward to the future ilc , where the susy particles can be better identified .",
    "moreover , the proposed cepc ( circular electron - proton collider ) and the tera z - factory in china might also join the project for searching mesinos .",
