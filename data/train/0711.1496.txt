    "several years ago zamolodchikov and zamolodchikov introduced an integrable @xmath5matrix for massless particles which was associated to the 2dimen - sional o(3 ) non  linear sigma model with a topological @xmath0 term for @xmath2  @xcite .",
    "therefore the 2dimensional o(3 ) sigma model with @xmath2 is possibly gapless .",
    "actually this conclusion was previously achieved by haldane and affleck .",
    "they worked out a low energy description of the 1dimensional chain of quantum half ",
    "integer spin with antiferromagnetic coupling finding that it and the above  mentioned o(3 )",
    "sigma model share the same long distance properties  @xcite .",
    "moreover it was found that antiferromagnetic quantum spin chains are gapless for half ",
    "integer spins  @xcite .",
    "later affleck and haldane  @xcite argued that the critical theory for the half ",
    "integer quantum antiferromagnetic spin chain is the wess ",
    "zumino  witten model with a topological coupling @xmath6 .",
    "this model is the stable fixed point of the 2dimensional o(3 ) sigma model with a vacuum angle @xmath2 .",
    "in addition , two numerical calculations of the partition function for the o(3 ) model in the presence of a @xmath0 term  @xcite yield indications that the theory undergoes a second order phase transition at @xmath2 ( although the two analyses disagree about the universality class ) .    in the present work we introduce a direct numerical method to verify the haldane conjecture for the 2dimensional o(3 ) non  linear sigma model .",
    "the idea is to perform a monte carlo study on the lattice of the mass gap in the model as a function of the @xmath0 parameter and to show that it vanishes at a precise value of @xmath0 , called @xmath7 , which , following haldane , should be @xmath8 .",
    "we overcome the sign problem by simulating the theory at imaginary @xmath0 and analytically continuing the results to the real @xmath0 values . to this end",
    "we introduce a new cluster algorithm that works for imaginary non ",
    "zero theta .",
    "the continuum expression for the action of the model is @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the coupling constant and @xmath11 is the topological charge density .",
    "@xmath12 is a 3component unit vector that represents the dynamical variable at the site @xmath13 .",
    "we have regularized this action on a square lattice by the expression @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the total lattice topological charge and @xmath16 is the lattice topological charge density .",
    "@xmath17 is the inverse bare lattice coupling constant and @xmath18 is the bare vacuum angle . in general , @xmath19 and the point where the lattice regularized model becomes massless",
    "will be called @xmath20 .",
    "the action @xmath21 used in  ( [ latticeaction ] ) is the simplest one on the lattice .",
    "more complicated actions and expansion parameters boast better scaling and asymptotic scaling properties and hence they are more suited for the calculation of masses  @xcite .",
    "however our interest lies only on the vanishing of the mass gap at a particular value of @xmath18 and such a property is clearly unaffected by the slow convergence of the series .",
    "let us discuss the regularization of the topological charge density to be used in our monte carlo simulation .",
    "@xmath23 counts how many times the configuration of spin variables winds around the unit sphere .",
    "hence @xmath23 takes on integer values .",
    "configurations with @xmath24 ( @xmath25 ) winding number are called instantons ( anti  instantons )  @xcite .",
    "we have made use of two different lattice regularizations for the topological charge density .",
    "the first one  @xcite @xmath26 is a symmetrical discretization of the expression for @xmath11 in eq.([continuumaction ] ) .",
    "the second lattice regularization is defined on triangles ( not on single sites ) .",
    "every plaquette of a square lattice can be cut through a diagonal into two triangles .",
    "if we call @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 the fields at the sites of the three vertices ( numbered counter ",
    "clockwise ) of one of these triangles then the fraction of spherical angle subtended by these fields is @xmath30 which satisfies  @xcite @xmath31 where @xmath32 and @xmath33 $ ] .",
    "the sum of @xmath34 over all triangles yields the so  called geometric topological charge  @xmath35 .    in general",
    ", a regularization of @xmath23 does not lead to integer values on a single configuration . to recover integer results for @xmath22 on ensembles of configurations that belong to the same topological sector , we must renormalize this operator .",
    "the lattice and the continuum topological charges are related by  @xcite @xmath36 @xmath37 being the corresponding renormalization constant which is uv finite since the topological charge operator has no anomalous dimensions in the model under study .",
    "@xmath37 can be calculated either in perturbation theory  @xcite or by a non  perturbative numerical method  @xcite .",
    "we have used the latter . in a nutshell",
    "it works in the following way : a classical instanton ( with topological charge + 1 ) is put by hand on the lattice and then 100 updating steps are applied ( we used the heat  bath algorithm on the conventional o(3 ) non  linear @xmath38 model without a @xmath0 term since the renormalization constant to be used in eq.([qlzq ] ) can not depend on @xmath0 ) . after every heat ",
    "bath step the value of @xmath39 is measured and , in order to monitor the background charge and check that it is not varied after the updating step , @xmath39 is measured again after 6  cooling hits . in the calculation of @xmath40 this procedure",
    "was repeated @xmath41 times at @xmath42 and @xmath43 and @xmath44 times for @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "the average of @xmath39 on configurations within the topological sector @xmath24 yields @xmath37 .",
    "the above non  perturbative method is summarized by the expression @xmath47 the restricted path integral runs over all configurations ( fluctuations ) that preserve the background of one instanton . since the geometric charge @xmath35 is + 1 till the background classical configuration is one instanton ( whatever the fluctuations are ) , the expression  ( [ heatingmethod ] ) yields @xmath48 for all @xmath17  @xcite .",
    "the determination of @xmath40 is not so trivial and an example of such an evaluation is shown in fig.[fig1 ] .",
    "measures of @xmath49 on configurations that belong to the topological sector @xmath24 attain to a plateau ( in general after a few heat  bath steps ) and stay on it for the rest of the updating steps .",
    "the height of this plateau is the value of @xmath40 . in table  1",
    "the results for @xmath40 at the values of @xmath17 used in the present work are given .",
    "the relevant consequence of the above considerations for our study is that the vacuum angle @xmath0 is related to the corresponding bare parameter by the expression @xmath50 ( which implies @xmath51 when @xmath35 is used ) .",
    "although the use of the topological charge density @xmath49 requires the knowledge of a renormalization constant , it brings about the advantage that the action @xmath52 in  ( [ latticeaction ] ) can be simulated on the lattice by use of a fast cluster algorithm .",
    "instead when the geometric charge @xmath53 was used , the model was updated by a ( rather slow ) metropolis algorithm .",
    "let us briefly describe the main characteristics of the new cluster algorithm expressly devised for the present work .",
    "the first part of an updating step with the usual wolff algorithm  @xcite for the standard o(3 ) sigma model without a @xmath0 term consists in choosing a random unit vector @xmath54 in such a way that every dynamical field can be split in a component parallel to @xmath54 and the rest , @xmath55 , where @xmath56 denotes the part of @xmath12 orthogonal to @xmath54 .",
    "then the signs of @xmath57 for all @xmath13 are updated  la swendsen  wang as in the ising model  @xcite .    by introducing the above separation for @xmath12 in the expression  ( [ latticeq1 ] )",
    "we can re  write it as @xmath58 where @xmath59 means the site at the position one step forward ( backward ) in the direction `` 1 '' starting from site @xmath13 and the notation @xmath60 stands for the @xmath61 determinant ( the three components for each vector must be unfold along the rows ) @xmath62 in this fashion the theory at each updating step looks like an ising model in the bosom of an external local magnetic field @xmath63 because the expression in eq.([latticeq1bis ] ) is linear in @xmath64 .",
    "recall that all monte carlo simulations have been performed with an imaginary vacuum angle @xmath65 , ( @xmath66 ) . by gathering all contributions of the type shown in eq.([latticeq1bis ] ) that contain @xmath57 at site @xmath13 one can readily derive the effective magnetic field at this site , @xmath67 @xmath68 ( and analogous terms in  ( [ fieldmag ] ) ) are the straightforward generalization of the above definition  ( [ definitiond ] ) when the site is obtained by shifting two steps from the original position  @xmath13 , the first in the direction @xmath69 and the second in the direction @xmath70 .",
    "hence the last step in the updating consists in applying to the above expressions an algorithm valid for the ising model in presence of a magnetic field . in the literature",
    "there are two such algorithms , the lauwers ",
    "rittenberg  @xcite and the wang  @xcite methods .",
    "after testing their perfomances and comparing the corresponding decorrelation times with the usual ( multihit ) metropolis , heat  bath and overheat  bath , we decided for the wang algorithm .",
    "it consists in placing the magnetic field on an extra , fictitious site ( called ghost site ) that couples to every ising spin through the value of @xmath63 . using this coupling on the same footing as all other terms in the action , the fortuin ",
    "kasteleyn clusters  @xcite are arranged by the hoshen ",
    "kopelman algorithm  @xcite and then updated with the usual @xmath71 probability .    following the proof given in  @xcite",
    ", it can be seen that our algorithm also satisfies the detailed balance property .",
    "operators representing physical states can be built out of an arbitrary number of fundamental fields since supposedly the model is not parity invariant for @xmath72 . as the energy gap is given by the mass of a triplet state  @xcite we studied the correlation functions of operators having one o(3 ) index as quantum number , @xmath73 then we calculated the related wall operators by averaging over the @xmath74 coordinate ( as usual @xmath75 is the lattice size ) , @xmath76 for @xmath77 .    to single out the correct parity mixture for the physical particle and to clean the signal from possible excited states , we extracted the triplet mass @xmath78 by using the variational method of ref .",
    "@xcite where the mass is obtained from the exponential decay of the largest eigenvalue of the correlation matrix @xmath79 .",
    "@xmath80 decorrelated propagators were measured for all values of @xmath17 and @xmath18 . in the main plot of fig.[fig2 ]",
    "the results for the triplet mass are shown for four values of @xmath17 .",
    "the extrapolations in this figure were done by using the functional form @xmath81 .",
    "we avoided using a functional form dictated by some theoretical argument , like one that for real or imaginary @xmath18 goes like @xmath82 which is , up to logarithmic corrections , the renormalization group prediction , because such an analytic form implicitly assumes the vanishing of the mass at a precise value of @xmath0 .",
    "instead we made the extrapolations with ratios of polynomials ( which are contemporaneously both simple and very general functional forms ) in order to leave room for any behaviour in the vacuum angle .",
    "the results of the analytic continuations are given in table  1 .",
    "the physical value of @xmath0 where the theory becomes gapless is given by @xmath83 .",
    "the numbers in the last column are in fair agreement with the prediction that the model becomes massless when @xmath0 equals @xmath84 .",
    "similar results ( and @xmath85 ) were obtained from degree  2 or  3 polynomials in @xmath86 , while ratios of higher order polynomials proved to be statistically unlikely ( their @xmath85 was too large ) .",
    "values of @xmath40 and @xmath7 .",
    "the lattice sizes in table  1 were chosen large enough to meet at @xmath87 the condition @xmath88 .",
    "once this inequality holds at @xmath87 , it is amply realized at the values of @xmath18 where the simulations were performed as inferred from fig.[fig2 ] .",
    "this fact warrants the absence of significant finite size effects .      in this case",
    "a metropolis algorithm was used for updating and @xmath89 independent propagators were measured for each value of @xmath0 ( recall that in the present case @xmath90 ) .",
    "we report data for two values of @xmath17 .",
    "they are displayed in the inset of fig.[fig2 ] .",
    "the value of @xmath0 where haldane predicted the closing of the mass gap is indicated with an arrow , @xmath91 .",
    "the numerical results are given in table  2 .",
    "comments similar to the @xmath49 case apply to the extrapolations shown in the figure . again",
    "the results are in fair agreement with the conjecture .",
    "@xmath7 for the operator @xmath53 .    by averaging all results for both topological charge operators and assuming gaussian errors we obtain that the mass gap vanishes at @xmath92 .",
    "we have simulated the o(3 ) non  linear sigma model in 2  dimensions with an imaginary @xmath0 term at several values of the lattice coupling @xmath17 .",
    "the mass gap was measured and extrapolated towards real @xmath0 . in all cases the extrapolation vanished at a value of @xmath0 compatible with the haldane conjecture @xmath2 .",
    "our result is @xmath1 which agrees within errors with the conjecture .",
    "this value seems very robust as it is independent of the topological charge density operator chosen for the simulation .",
    "in particular , an operator @xmath49 that requires a non  trivial renormalization constant leads to the same conclusion than another operator ( the geometric charge @xmath35 ) that does not renormalize .",
    "a new fast cluster algorithm was purposely introduced to simulate the theory with an imaginary @xmath0 term .",
    "it works for the operator @xmath49 . instead , when the geometric topological charge @xmath35 was used , the theory was simulated by a ( rather slow ) metropolis algorithm .",
    "a salient outcome of our work is the good performance of the analytic continuation from imaginary to real @xmath0 .",
    "no theoretical prejudices were assumed in the functional form used in the continuation , apart from the obvious requirement that it is analytic .",
    "this can be justified by a comparison with the phase diagram shown in ref .",
    "@xcite . in the case of the geometrical charge",
    "our largest @xmath17 and @xmath51 ( 1.55 and 3.5 respectively ) are very far from the line of phase transitions ; as for the @xmath49 case , our largest @xmath17 and @xmath93 were 1.75 and 4.1 , which again lie very far from any line of singular points .",
    "the need to perform monte carlo simulations at imaginary values of @xmath0 is actually a blessing in disguise since it forced us to work at very small correlation lengths , as can be clearly seen in fig.[fig2 ] .",
    "had we studied the theory directly at real @xmath0 values , we would have met with severe finite size effects .    a key ingredient for the successful extrapolation was to have got data from simulations within a wide range of ( imaginary ) values of @xmath18 for all @xmath17 , ( @xmath94 $ ] when @xmath49 was used and @xmath95 $ ] for @xmath35 , the difference of intervals being due to the effect of the non  trivial renormalization that must be applied to the former ) .",
    "all that looks encouraging for the numerical studies based on the analytic continuation with respect to a parameter in the theory , such as in qcd with non  zero chemical potential  @xcite .",
    "we thank ettore vicari and adriano di giacomo for a critical reading of a preliminary draft of the paper and giuseppe mussardo for illuminating conversations .",
    "we also want to thank gerrit schierholz for valuable comments .",
