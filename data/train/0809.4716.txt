    "coherence is a defining property of quantum mechanics .",
    "it can be argued that quantum coherence is the property that draws a line between the `` quantum world '' from the `` classical world '' .",
    "but what exactly is coherence ? in physics , the term coherence refers to the property of waves to interfere , showing well known interference patterns .",
    "two waves , depending on their relative phase , can produce a constructive interference , characterized by an enhancement of the amplitude of the wave , or destructive interference , accompanied by a complete suppression of it .",
    "only the relative phase of the two waves makes the difference . to be precise we should therefore speak about phase coherence of quantum states .    by quantum states here we mean states of a quantum system , which in turn can be constituted by more than one quantum object .",
    "the same rules of quantum mechanics that allow us to explain and predict interference of one object with itself , as the case of an electron through a double slit , predict that a system composed by two quantum subsystems can be in a state that has no classical counterpart , being a superposition with a precise phase of two or more quantum states of the whole system .",
    "this property of quantum states goes under the name of entanglement , and entangled states need to be phase coherent . in particular , coherence , as a property of quantum mechanical phenomena , disappears in the classical world , and it is therefore of fundamental interest to study it in theory and experiment .",
    "it is never completely possible to isolate a quantum system from the surrounding world .",
    "the system and its surrounding interact and , as a result , a randomization of the phase of the quantum system takes place , and the initial quantum state ends up in a classical state .",
    "this process is known as decoherence .    only in recent years , thanks to the advances in technology , it has become possible to study quantum effects involving single quantum objects , like single photons , ions , electron spins , etc ... particular attention has been devoted to see coherence , from an experimental point of view , and to understand its limitation .",
    "in fact , though remarkable improvements have been achieved , nowadays , to see coherence , a lot of effort must be spent to understand how to preserve coherence . in the last decades ,",
    "the idea of joining quantum physics laws and information science gave birth to a new and intriguing branch of science , quantum information theory , which studies the possibilities that quantum rules offer to information processing .",
    "in particular , the superposition principle opens the possibility to perform new and fast algorithms .",
    "the physical implementation of quantum information processing represents a challenge because one has to deal with the competition between fast and reliable quantum control , that requires interaction with the outside world , and good isolation of the quantum devices in order to ensure long coherence times .",
    "therefore , it is important to understand theoretically how decoherence happens in the systems under study ( here , solid state systems ) in order to make progress toward this ambitious goal ( i.e. implementing quantum information ) .",
    "classical information is based on binary logic , in which information is encoded in a series of bits ( binary digits ) that can assume only two values , 0 or 1 .",
    "a typical example is a switch , with its two possible states `` on '' and `` off '' .",
    "all classical logical operations can be implemented as algorithms based on one- and two - bit operations , the so - called gates .",
    "the building block of quantum information is the quantum bit , or qubit . using the dirac notation , the two states that characterize the qubit are @xmath0 and @xmath1 and they represent the quantum counterpart of the classical 0 and 1 .",
    "the most important property of a quantum bit is the possibility to be in a coherent superposition state @xmath2 with @xmath3 and @xmath4 complex numbers , characterized by a relative phase and by @xmath5 . according the the postulates of quantum mechanics",
    ", @xmath6 represents the probability for the qubit to be in the state @xmath0 , whereas @xmath7 represents the probability to be in @xmath1 .",
    "this means that if we prepare many copies of the same system in the state @xmath8 , a measurement of the state of the qubit will produce the outcome 0 with rate @xmath6 , and the outcome 1 with rate @xmath7 .",
    "in which case the two logical states are the spin up @xmath9 and the spin down @xmath10 .",
    "the two states @xmath0 and @xmath1 form a basis of the hilbert space @xmath11 of the qubit .",
    "a good example of a qubit is the spin 1/2 . in order to explain the necessity to use complex number @xmath3 and @xmath4 to characterize the state of the qubit",
    ", we describe an interference procedure for a spin 1/2 particle .",
    "suppose we prepare the spin in the state @xmath12 , that is with probability 1 to find it parallel with respect to a certain direction @xmath13 in the space , that we choose as quantization axis .",
    "we then rotate the spin by an angle @xmath14 about an axis perpendicular to @xmath13 , i.e. the @xmath15 axis .",
    "the result is the state @xmath16 we then let the spin cross a region in which there is a magnetic field that points in the positive @xmath13 direction , @xmath17 . due to the presence of the magnetic field ,",
    "the two states @xmath9 and @xmath10 accumulate a relative phase @xmath18 , that depends on the magnitude of the magnetic field and the time @xmath19 spent in the region with the @xmath20 field , and that for simplicity we leave unspecified .",
    "up to an overall phase , the state of the system that comes out from the region with a magnetic field is given by @xmath21 now , we again rotate the spin of @xmath14 about the @xmath15 direction , and obtain @xmath22.\\ ] ] if we now measure the state of the spin , we obtain @xmath9 with probability @xmath23 and @xmath10 with probability @xmath24 .",
    "we clearly see , now , that the relative phase can really affect the state of a quantum system .",
    "this procedure is known as ramsey interference @xcite and it is used in experiments to detect coherent oscillations in the transverse spin component .",
    "decoherence is a consequence of the interaction of the qubit with the surrounding environment . as an instructive example we consider the case in which the environment is constituted by another qubit . for the hamiltonian describing the interaction between the two qubits we choose ( @xmath25 ) @xmath26 where the operator @xmath27 is a two - qubit operator , given by the tensor product of two single - qubit operators , and it acts in the tensor product space @xmath28 .",
    "we note that our general argument does not depend on the specific form of @xmath29 , as long as it describes an interaction between the qubits .",
    "as the initial state for the two qubit system we choose a product state @xmath30 , where the single qubit state is @xmath31 , written in the basis diagonal with respect to @xmath32 , @xmath33 , and @xmath34 .",
    "we let the system evolve according to the unitary evolution generated by the hamiltonian eq .",
    "( [ eq : sysy ] ) for a time @xmath19 , after which we perform a trace operation on the second qubit and have a look how the state of the first qubit evolved during the time @xmath19 in which it has interacted with the second qubit .",

    "it is found to be @xmath37 the state of the two qubit system after a time @xmath19 is given by @xmath38 , with @xmath39 .",
    "after some algebra the state of the first qubit at time @xmath19 is given by @xmath40= \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\begin{array}{cc } 1 & \\cos(jt/2)\\\\ \\cos(jt/2 ) & 1\\end{array } \\right).\\ ] ] the diagonal element of the first qubit density matrix is left unchanged by the interaction with the second qubit , whereas the off - diagonal elements change in time .",
    "the coherence of a state is encoded in the off - diagonal element of the density matrix . after a time @xmath41",
    "the coherence is completely lost ( full decoherence ) . however , due to the smallness of the environment considered , the first qubit periodically recovers its original state .",
    "it is therefore clear that the interaction with the environment strongly affects the qubit coherence .",
    "according to the axioms of quantum mechanics the dynamics of a closed conservative system is described as a unitary time evolution .",
    "in such a picture the system is considered to be decoupled from the surrounding environment , that does not influence at all the dynamics of the closed system . strictly speaking",
    "this is never the case .",
    "however , under certain conditions the coupling to the environment can be considered to be weak , and to a good approximation neglected .    in condensed phases",
    ", the coupling to the environment can be relatively strong , and the system under consideration can not be separated from its surrounding . however , often a rather complex physical situation can be modelled by a system that consists of few dynamical variables in contact with a huge environment , constituted by a very large or even infinite number of degrees of freedom . in this case",
    "the small relevant system alone has to be described as an open system .",
    "generally , an open system is a quantum system @xmath42 which is coupled to an other quantum system @xmath43 called the environment .",
    "it can therefore be thought to be a subsystem of the combined system @xmath44 , which in turn in many cases is considered to be a closed system , governed by hamiltonian dynamics .",
    "the system @xmath42 will in turn change according to its internal dynamics , and as a consequence of the interaction with the environment .",
    "certain system - environment correlations will be established between the two parts and , as a consequence , the dynamics of a quantum open system can not , in general , be described in terms of a unitary time evolution .",
    "denote @xmath45 the hilbert space of the system @xmath42 , and @xmath46 the hilbert space of system @xmath43 .",
    "the dynamics of the combined system @xmath44 takes place in the hilbert space given by the tensor product space @xmath47 .",
    "the total hamiltonian can be chosen to have the general form @xmath48 where @xmath49 describes the evolution of the system @xmath42 alone , @xmath50 is the free hamiltonian of the environment @xmath43 , and @xmath51 describes the interaction between the system and the environment .",
    "usually when speaking about the _ environment _ of the system @xmath42 , the term _ reservoir _ may appear , that refers to an environment with an infinite number of degrees of freedom , such that the frequency modes associated with it form a continuum spectrum .",
    "occasionally the term _ heat bath _ or simply _ bath _ refers to a reservoir which is in thermal equilibrium .",
    "the presence of an environment is meant to model the communication of the open system with the external world .",
    "however the attention is focused on the subsystem under study @xmath42 , and all observations of interest refer to the subsystem @xmath42 .",
    "formally this means that all observables of interest act on the hilbert space @xmath45 . denoting the state of the total system by @xmath52 , the expectation values of all observables",

    "free electrons are introduced by doping the algaas layer with si , which accumulate at the gaas / algaas interface , deep down in the minimum of the vertical potential , that provides strong confinement of the electrons along the growth direction . at the same time , the electrons are free to move along the interface , where they form a two dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) , that can have a high mobility and a relatively low electron density ( typically @xmath138 and @xmath139 ) .",
    "the low density results in a relatively long fermi wavelength ( @xmath140 ) and a large screening length , such that via application of an electric field , obtained through metal gate electrodes on top of the heterostructure negatively charged , the 2deg can be locally depleted .",

    "the lattice phonons do not couple directly to the spin degree of freedom .",
    "however , even without the application of external electric fields , the breaking of inversion symmetry in gaas gives rise to spin - orbit interaction , that couples the spin and the orbital degrees of freedom .",
