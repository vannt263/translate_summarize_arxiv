    "dips have been observed in the x - ray lightcurves of about twenty x - ray binaries .",
    "the characteristics of the dips vary from source to source requiring a number of different explanations for the dips . in many cases ,",
    "dips are explained by absorption of the x - ray source by material passing in front of the source ( white , nagase , and parmar 1995 ) . in some sources",
    ", dips may be due to accretion disk instabilities , which cause the ejection of the inner part of the disk ( belloni et al .",

    "we present an analysis of an x - ray dip observed in the 1996 outburst of 4u  1630 - 47 .",
    "the transient x - ray source 4u  1630 - 47 has been identified as a black hole candidate based on the shape of its x - ray spectrum and the lack of type i x - ray bursts ( parmar , stella , and white 1986 ) .",
    "4u  1630 - 47 is unusual among x - ray transients due to the fact that its outburst recurrence time is relatively short and regular staying between 600 and 700 days ( kuulkers et al .",
    "although optical observations of 4u  1630 - 47 have been made ( parmar et al . 1986 ) , an optical companion has not been identified .",
    "it has been suggested that 4u  1630 - 47 may be a superluminal radio jet source similar to grs  1915 + 105 and gro  j1655 - 40 based on its timing properties ( kuulkers , van der klis , and parmar 1997a ) .",
    "for this reason , it is interesting to compare the properties of the 4u  1630 - 47 dip to the dips in grs  1915 + 105 .    in this paper ,",

    "the results of the analysis are presented , and two possible causes for the dip are considered .",
    "we find that the dip can be explained by absorption of part of the x - ray source . in  4 , we discuss the implications of the dip .",
    "the x - ray transient 4u  1630 - 47 was observed with the _ rossi x - ray timing explorer ( rxte ) ( bradt , rothschild , and swank 1993 ) several times during an outburst which began in march 1996 and lasted for 115  days ( levine et al .",

    "we conclude that the only x - ray dips which occurred during the pointed observations were those observed during the may  3 observation . in this paper",

    "the lightcurves include the combined count rates for five pcus and are background subtracted . during the may  3 observation ,",
    "the non - dip source flux is about 240  mcrab ( 2 - 60  kev ) corresponding to a flux of @xmath0 .",
    "energy spectra have been produced using standard 2 pca data and the version 2.02 response matrix .",
    "this response matrix gives much better fits to the crab for pcus 0 , 2 , 3 , and 4 than for pcu 1 .",
    "also , based on spectral fits to the crab , the response matrix is much better for the top xenon layer than for the other two xenon layers .",
    "thus , only data from the top xenon layers of pcus 0 , 2 , 3 , and 4 has been used in making energy spectra .",
    "a systematic error of 1% is assumed to account for uncertainties in the response matrix ( jahoda et al .",

    "the 2 - 60  kev x - ray flux decreases by a factor of three . here ,",
    "we consider two possible causes for the dips : absorption or ejection of the inner part of the disk via an accretion disk instability .",
    "exponential fits to the lightcurves during ingress and egress of dip 2 have been calculated in order to compare the e - folding times for the three energy bands . for the ingress fits , 23 seconds of data after the start of dip 2 was used , and for the egress fits , 57 seconds of data preceeding the end of dip 2 was used .",
    "table 1 shows the e - folding times and the values of @xmath2 for the six fits . for both ingress and egress",
    ", there is a significant increase in e - folding time with increasing energy , suggesting that dip 2 is due to absorption by an object which has a lower column density at its edges than in its interior .",
    "this result does not appear to be consistent with dip 2 being caused by ejection of the inner disk since it is difficult to see how the soft x - ray emitting region could be ejected before the hard x - ray emitting region . also , it is not clear why the hardest part of the x - ray source would recover first at the end of the dip .",
    "we also find that the egress e - folding times are substantially longer than the ingress e - folding times .",
    "if absorption is the cause of the dip , this result may indicate an asymmetry in the density or the shape of the absorber .",
    "figure 2 shows the relationship between spectral hardness and count rate .",
    "the hardness ratio is constant above about 1500  .",
    "however , as the count rate decreases from its non - dip level , spectral changes become apparent . for intermediate count rates ( 1000  to  1500  ) ,",
    "the spectrum is significantly harder than in its non - dip state , and for count rates below 1000  , the spectrum softens .",
    "the hardness increase at intermediate count rates is consistent with absorption , but inconsistent with ejection of the inner part of the accretion disk .",
    "the softening of the spectrum at count rates below 1000  can be explained by ejection of the inner part of the disk , but can not be explained by a cold absorber covering the entire x - ray source .",
    "however , the softening is consistent with the presence of an extended soft x - ray source and provides motivation for a two component model where one component is absorbed during the dip and a second , softer , extended component is not absorbed during the dip .    for spectral analysis , dip and",
    "non - dip data have been selected from the may  3 observation based on the source intensity during each of the 16  s integrations provided by standard 2 data .",
    "the dip spectrum consists of a 64  s integration and 960  s of data are used for the non - dip spectrum . for the non - dip spectrum",
    ", single component models do not provide acceptable fits : a powerlaw fit gives @xmath3 for 41 degrees of freedom ( dof ) , a fit using a thermal bremsstrahlung model gives @xmath3 for 41 dof , a blackbody disk model gives @xmath4 for 41 dof , and a cut - off powerlaw gives @xmath5 for 40 dof .",
    "an acceptable fit to the energy spectrum is achieved using a model combining a disk - blackbody component ( makishima et al .",
    "1986 ) with a powerlaw component ( @xmath6 for 39 dof ) .",
    "this is consistent with fits to spectra from previous observations of 4u  1630 - 47 ( parmar et al .",
    "1997 ) .",
    "since the data suggests the presence of a soft component that is not absorbed during the dip , we consider a model where flux coming from the outer region of the disk is not affected during the dip and the inner region of the disk is absorbed during the dip .",
    "the radius dividing the unabsorbed and absorbed regions of the disk is one of the free parameters in the model .",
    "the sharp cutoff between the unabsorbed and absorbed regions is an approximation of the actual physical system .",
    "however , the data are not of sufficient quality to distinguish between this model and a more complex model .",
    "since it is not known where the powerlaw component originates , the model allows for part of the powerlaw component to come from the unabsorbed region and part to come from the absorbed region , but it is assumed that the powerlaw index ( @xmath7 ) is the same in both regions .",

    "we assume that @xmath27 is the same for photoelectric absorption and compton scattering . the parameter @xmath29 is fixed so that the x - ray flux from disk radii beyond @xmath30 is negligible .",
    "in all , there are eight free parameters in the model .",
    "the unabsorbed emission from the disk is determined by @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "the parameters @xmath31 , @xmath32 , and @xmath7 specify the emission due to the powerlaw component .",
    "the other free parameters are @xmath26 , @xmath27 , and @xmath33 .",
    "this model has been used to simultaneously fit the dip and non - dip spectra . in calculating the fit ,",
    "the only parameter which is allowed to be different for the two spectra is the column density ( @xmath27 ) of the absorbing material .",
    "this model provides a good fit to the two spectra with @xmath34 for 79  dof .",
    "the fit parameters with their 68% confidence errors are given in table  2 and the fitted spectra are shown in figure  3 .",
    "the extra material absorbing the inner region of the disk is found to have a column density of @xmath35 during the dip and @xmath36 during the non - dip , and the interstellar absorption is @xmath37 .",
    "the non - dip and dip spectra can not be simultaneously fit with a model where @xmath27 is set to zero for the non - dip and @xmath26 is the same for the inner and outer regions of the disk .",
    "past observations of 4u  1630 - 47 show that it is reasonable to think that some portion of the absorption measured in the non - dip spectrum is due to material close to the source since the column density has shown a high degree of variability from observation to observation .",
    "column densities of @xmath38 , @xmath39 , and @xmath40 were measured in three separate observations ( parmar , angellini , and white 1995 , parmar et al .",
    ". it would be reasonable to assume that the lowest of these measurements provides an upper limit on the interstellar absorption , which would make our value of @xmath26 only slightly higher than expected .    above about 13  kev",
    ", the powerlaw component dominates the non - dip and dip spectra and the disk - blackbody component is negligible .",
    "figure  3 shows that the dip flux is lower than the non - dip flux at all energies including the powerlaw dominated region .",
    "thus , if the dip is caused by absorption , then at least part of the powerlaw component must be absorbed . comparing the values of @xmath41 and",
    "@xmath42 indicates that most of the powerlaw component comes from the absorbed region .",
    "further evidence that most of the powerlaw component is absorbed is the fact that if @xmath32 is fixed to zero , and the simultaneous fit is recalculated , the quality of the fit does not change ( @xmath34 for 80  dof ) .",
    "if the only parameter that changes with time is the column density of the absorber , a measured count rate in a particular energy band corresponds to a unique value of @xmath27 , and it is possible to see if variations in the column density can produce the features observed in the lightcurves shown in figure  1 .",
    "figure  4 shows the column density estimates derived from the count rates in the middle and hard bands during the dip .",
    "there is good agreement between the @xmath27 values calculated from the two bands .",
    "the model predicts almost the same flux in the soft band for all values of @xmath27 above about @xmath43 ; thus , for column densities above this level , the soft band flux provides no information and is not shown in figure  4 .",
    "the absorption model predicts that the drop in the column density observed in the middle of dip 2 should produce a 20% increase in the soft band flux .",
    "this is consistent with the observed @xmath44% flux increase .",
    "the model assumes that the intrinsic ( unabsorbed ) intensity of 4u  1630 - 47 remains constant during the dips , and that the observed change in flux is due entirely to variations in the column density . using the non - dip lightcurve with 0.5  s time bins , we find that the source variability is below the 5% level over a time interval comparable to the duration of the dip ( 140  s ) indicating that this assumption is reasonable .",
    "a model where an accretion disk instability leads to ejection of the inner part of the accretion disk has been used to explain the x - ray dips observed in grs  1915 + 105 .",
    "since this is a model which can produce spectrally soft dips , we have considered it as a possible mechanism for the 4u  1630 - 47 dip . based on fits to grs  1915 + 105 spectra , belloni et al .",
    "( 1997 ) found that the inner radius of the accretion disk is larger during dip times than during non - dip times .",
    "we fit the 4u  1630 - 47 non - dip and dip spectra simultaneously using a disk - blackbody plus powerlaw model and requiring the absorption ( column density and absorption edge parameters ) to be the same for the non - dip and dip spectra . for the dip spectrum ,",
    "the disk - blackbody normalization is consistent with zero ( @xmath45 ) , and the powerlaw is the only significant spectral component .",
    "this could be interpreted as meaning that the entire x - ray emitting portion of the disk is ejected during the dip .",
    "however , large residuals are observed near 7  kev for the dip spectrum but not for the non - dip spectrum .",
    "this suggests the presence of an iron k - absorption edge only in the dip spectrum , which supports absorption as the cause of the dip .",
    "the spectrally soft x - ray dips observed in 4u  1630 - 47 are best explained by a model where part of the x - ray source is absorbed , while another part of the x - ray source is unaffected during the dips .",
    "the models used to explain absorption dips in other sources typically place the absorbing material in the accretion disk or in a wind from a high mass companion . in the former case , the dips are probably produced by an accumulation of material where the stream of material from the companion impacts the disk .",
    "this results in dips being observed at certain orbital phases , and most of these sources are described as periodic dippers . in order for dips to be observed , the inclination angle must be relatively high ( @xmath46  degrees ) ( white et al .",
    "strong stellar winds often exist in binaries where the optical companion is an o or b type star . in 4u  1630 - 47 ,",
    "neither the inclination angle nor the spectral type of the companion are known so there is no reason to assume either of these possibilities a priori . in this section",
    ", we discuss the properties of the dip in relation to these two possibilities .",
    "frank , king , and lasota ( 1987 ) ( henceforth fkl ) explain the dips using a model where the stream of material from the companion is thicker than the scale height of the accretion disk so that a fraction of the stream flows above and below the disk . in this model , when the matter from the stream is irradiated by x - rays coming from close to the compact object , ionization instabilities cause the material to separate into a two - phase medium consisting of cold , relatively dense clouds , which are responsible for the dips , in a hot intercloud medium . here , we compare the cloud sizes and densities derived by fkl to estimates for those quantities for the absorber producing the dips in 4u  1630 - 47 . to estimate the absorber velocity , we assume that the absorber is in a circular orbit about a @xmath47 compact object , where the mass estimate comes from assuming that the highest observed flux for 4u  1630 - 47 ( parmar et al .",
    "1995 ) is the eddington luminosity at 10  kpc .",
    "we use @xmath48  cm for the distance from the compact object to the absorber ( fkl ) , where @xmath49 is the binary orbital period in units of days .",
    "if we assume that a typical cloud caused dip  1 , then the cloud diameter is @xmath50  cm . by using the dip  1 duration",
    ", we are assuming that dips 2 and 4 last longer and have higher peak column densities because they are caused by multiple clouds . using standard values for the accretion rate , the fraction of matter in the incoming stream which reaches @xmath51 , and the scale height of the disk given in fkl , the cloud sizes expected from the model of fkl are @xmath52  cm for @xmath53 , and the cloud size estimates agree if the orbital period is near one day .",
    "we can estimate the density of the absorber that produced dip  1 if we assume that the linear size of the cloud along the line of sight is the same as the linear size in the direction perpendicular to the line of sight .",
    "for matter with cosmic abundances , the cloud density is found to be @xmath54  g  @xmath55 . making the same assumptions as above",
    ", the density derived by fkl is @xmath56  g  @xmath55 , and the density estimates agree if the orbital period of the system is near one day , which is consistent with the orbital period derived based on the sizes of the clumps .",
    "we conclude that the characteristics of the dip are consistent with being produced by material in the accretion disk and that the model of fkl may imply that the orbital period of 4u  1630 - 47 is about a day .    finding that 4u  1630 - 47 dips periodically would be evidence that the dips are caused by material in the accretion disk .",
    "the other systems which exhibit periodic dips typically have duty cycles between 10 and 30% .",
    "dips have never been observed before in 4u  1630 - 47 , and the longest continuous observation was a 7 hour @xmath57 observation ( parmar et al .",
    "thus , assuming that x - ray dipping is not a transient phenomenon in 4u  1630 - 47 , the upper limit on the duty cycle is 1% .",
    "recent observations of dips from the superluminal jet source gro  j1655 - 40 indicate that the dips in this source also have a very small duty cycle , 0.2% for 400  s dips every 2.6  days ( kuulkers et al .",
    "most of the systems which exhibit periodic dipping are neutron star x - ray binaries , while gro  j1655 - 40 is securely identified as a black hole system ( orosz and bailyn 1997 ) .",
    "the fact that the dip duty cycle in gro  j1655 - 40 is so different from the neutron star systems suggests the possibility that the difference is related to the nature of the compact object .",
    "the 4u  1630 - 47 duty cycle may be small because the source contains a black hole .    to fit the dip spectrum of 4u  1630 - 47 by absorbing the non - dip spectrum , it is necessary to absorb the powerlaw component .",
    "this is in contrast to the x - ray burster 4u  1624 - 49 ( church and baluciska - church 1995 ) for which the non - dip spectrum is fit with a blackbody plus powerlaw model , and the dip spectrum can be fit by absorbing the blackbody component , but leaving the powerlaw component unaffected . these results probably indicate that the size of the region emitting the powerlaw is larger for 4u  1624 - 49 than for 4u  1630 - 47 and may indicate that the size of the region emitting the powerlaw is larger for neutron star systems than for systems containing black holes .",
    "it would be interesting to compare the spectral evolution of gro  j1655 - 40 during dips to that of 4u  1630 - 47 and 4u  1624 - 49 .",
    "we have also considered the possibility that the 4u  1630 - 47 dip is produced by a wind from a high mass companion . for",
    "4u  1630 - 47 , the relatively sharp transitions between non - dip and dip states , as observed in the lightcurve , and the corresponding variations in the column density indicate that the material producing the dips must be non - uniform in density and/or shape ( i.e. clumpy ) ; however , there is evidence for non - uniformity in stellar winds .",
    "cyg  x-1 is a hmxb where dips with sharp ingresses and egresses ( @xmath58  s ) are observed and attributed to the wind from the high mass companion ( kitamoto et al . 1984 ) .",
    "in addition , nagase et al .",
    "( 1986 ) suggests that stellar winds are likely to be turbulent and that clumping may be caused or enhanced by the x - ray source .",
    "the typical column densities observed for dips in hmxbs are between @xmath59 and @xmath60 ( haberl and white 1990 ; kitamoto , miyamoto , and yamamoto 1989 ) , which are only slightly less than the maximum column density measured for 4u  1630 - 47 .",
    "based on the properties of the dips observed in hmxbs , we can not eliminate the possibility that the 4u  1630 - 47 dip was caused by material in the wind of a high mass companion .",
    "distinguishing between the possible causes of the dip in 4u  1630 - 47 may lead to understanding its outburst recurrence time ( @xmath61 ) .",
    "it has been suggested that @xmath61 may be the orbital period of the system and that outbursts occur near periastron ( parmar et al .",
    "finding that material in a stellar wind was responsible for the dip would indicate the presence of a high mass companion and make it likely that @xmath61 is the orbital period .",
    "alternatively , confirmation of an orbital period near one day suggests similarities between 4u  1630 - 47 and her  x-1 , which has a 1.7  day orbital period and a 35  day on / off cycle . in this picture , @xmath61 is analogous to the 35  day period in her  x-1 , which is explained by accretion disk precession ( crosa and boynton 1980 ) .",

    "( 1997b ) find evidence for a change in @xmath61 from 600 to 690  days for the last three 4u  1630 - 47 outbursts , which suggests that @xmath61 is not the orbital period .",
    "however , the behavior of the x - ray transient gs  0834 - 430 indicates that the possibility that @xmath61 is related to the orbital period should not be completely ruled out ( wilson et al .",

    "<S> an x - ray dip was observed during a 1996 _ rossi x - ray timing explorer observation of the recurrent x - ray transient 4u  1630 - 47 . during the dip , </S>",
    "<S> the 2 - 60  kev x - ray flux drops by a factor of about three , and , at the lowest point of the dip , the x - ray spectrum is considerably softer than at non - dip times . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the 4u  1630 - 47 dip is best explained by absorption of the inner part of an accretion disk , while the outer part of the disk is unaffected . the spectral evolution during the dip is adequately described by the variation of a single parameter , the column density obscuring the inner disk . </S>"
