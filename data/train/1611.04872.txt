    "according to the world health organization ( who ) , epilepsy is a chronic brain disorder characterized by recurrent seizures , which may vary from a brief lapse of attention or muscle jerks to severe and prolonged convulsions .",
    "the seizures are caused by sudden , usually brief , excessive electrical discharges in a group of brain cells ( neurons ) .",
    "epilepsy can be classified according to the portion of the involved neural cortex : the _ focal _ epilepsy seizures are spatially confined either in small part of a lobe or in the whole hemisphere , while the _ generalized _ epilepsy seizures spread in the whole brain . in both cases epileptic seizures are a spontaneous hyper - synchronous activity of clusters of neurons  @xcite .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the human brain is a complex self adaptive system , composed of billion of non - identical neurons , entangled in loops of non - linear interactions , those determining the brain behaviors ; the epilepsy is an example  @xcite . in our perspective , identifying the onset of a neural hyper - synchronization is likely to discover patterns of information expressed by a network of interactions in the space of neurons .",
    "unfortunately , to the best of our knowledge , monitoring the electrical activity of each single neuron is not feasible , but it is possible to capture the electrical activity of the whole brain ( or of a part of it ) .",
    "currently , the standard technique used to record the signals through the positioning of certain number of electrodes on the scalp , is the electroencephalogram ( eeg ) , whose direct observation helps neurologists in diagnosing epilepsy ; the use of methods for the automatic diagnosis is still far from be a reality . in the last decades",
    "several methods have been proposed in literature  linear and non - linear analysis  @xcite , applications of chaos theory  @xcite and dynamical systems modelling  @xcite , but none of them is suitable the intrinsic non - linearity and the non - stationarity of eeg signals request for more suitable methods capable of extracting global information , both structural and functional , characterizing the brain cluster of neurons involved in the hyper - synchronous activity .    to this end , starting from the analysis of the eeg signals we must reconstruct the abstract structural component that represents the interactions among neuronal clusters involved in the brain activity and from the analysis of the evolution of the structural component ( the abstract model of the brain ) based on windows of observations , we must be able to identify the emergence of an hyper - synchronous activity of the brain neurons . in a short communication  @xcite ,",
    "the authors have proposed the use of topological data analysis ( tda for short ) for eeg signals , to characterize the structural component and the emergence of epileptic seizures .",
    "this approach based on tda has been previously introduced within the topdrim project for the analysis of fmri signals  @xcite . in this paper",
    "we describe a method suitable to automatically classify eeg signals that record epileptic seizures from those recording the activity of an healthy brain .",
    "this step is very important and preliminary to reconstruct the abstract structural and functional components of the brain because it allows us to characterize the transition phase from an healthy to an epileptic state of the system .",
    "the proposed method uses the topological data analysis ( tda ) combining two powerful instruments , persistent homology and persistent entropy measure for analysing the set of eeg signals and construct a topological classifier .",
    "tda consists of a set of algorithms for investigating the higher dimensional relations hidden in data sets through the construction of simplicial complex ; it finds its theoretical justification in the branch of mathematics called topology .",
    "the key - concept in tda is the concept of _ persistent homology _ : a procedure for counting , through a process called _ filtration _ , the higher dimensional persistent holes .",
    "tda has been applied in various fields among which computer vision and sensor coverage problem  @xcite , signal analysis  @xcite , biological problems  @xcite and in studying the spreading of contagions in social and biological systems  @xcite .",
    "persistent entropy is a shannon - like entropy for the measurement of the information discovered during the filtration process within the tda .",
    "shannon entropy  @xcite is the well known concept in thermodynamics as well as in information theory .",
    "the contribution of this work is twofold : from the one hand , we describe how the persistent entropy ( pe for short ) can be used to discriminate the epileptic state versus non epileptic states . from the other hand , we conjecture that the vietoris - rips filtration helps to understand which region plays the role of trigger for an epileptic seizure .",
    "the paper is organized as it follows : in section  [ sec : new_paradigm ] we introduce the new paradigm of tda and in section  [ sec : classifier ] the tda - based methodology used for the implementation of the new classifier is explained ; finally in section  [ sec : results ] the results of the work are presented and discussed .",
    "in this section we introduce the tda paradigm as the tool for analysing the eeg data set and discovering elements that are correlated in a given a data - set by @xmath0-relations .",
    "suppose we have a set of points @xmath1 , i.e. data , embedded in a @xmath2-dimensional space @xmath3 and assume that those data were sampled by an unknown @xmath4-dimensional space @xmath5 with @xmath6 , our task is to reconstruct the space @xmath5 from the data set @xmath1 , as it is in solving the inverse problem .",
    "for instance , traditional analysis techniques , such as manifold learning and principal components analysis ( pca )  @xcite , or unsupervised clustering techniques  @xcite , make some fundamental assumptions over the space @xmath5 : it is a manifold ; it is locally euclidean ; its metric is well defined ; it lacks of curvature but it is smooth  @xcite . since",
    "real data - sets are not a vector space they violate those assumptions , as consequence we claim that @xmath7 and @xmath8 have to be reshaped to _",
    "topological spaces_. intuitively a topological space is a set of elements that are equipped with a notion of _ proximity _ parameter that gives rise to a coordinate - free metric . instead of using the points as the vertices of a combinatorial graph to capture local information , in tda",
    "the data set is converted into a topological space to discover the higher dimensional hidden information through the _ filtration _ of a sequence of approximated topological spaces called simplicial complexes .",
    "building a filtration can be seen as wearing a lens for examining the data set ; different lenses , i.e. different filtrations , let extract different information from the topological space . in this paper",
    "we deal with two kinds of filtrations : the _ lower star filtration _ and the _ vietoris - rips filtration _    for the sake of completeness we introduce some formal concepts : a _ topology _ on a set @xmath9 is a subset @xmath10 such that :    * if @xmath11 then @xmath12 ( equivalent to : if @xmath13 then @xmath14 ) * if @xmath15 then @xmath16 * @xmath17    the pair @xmath18 of a set @xmath9 and a topology @xmath19 is a _",

    "a _ filtered simplicial complex _ is a simplicial complex equipped with a filtration .    as the filtration is the lens for reading the data it is worth understanding what kind of information exactly we are looking for .",
    "the answer is : the topological invariants or if you prefer the @xmath4-dimensional holes in the data . during the filtration process",
    "@xmath4-dimensional holes appear and disappear and some of them persist for a certain filtration - time : the short - lived are considered noise while the long - lived are the invariants we are looking for , see . see @xcite and @xcite for an introduction to algebraic topology .",
    "as we mention above , to choose how to build a filtration is very important because it reflexes how data points are converted into the simplicial complexes and thus converting set points into a topological space .",

    "the 10 - 20 refers to the fact that actual distances between electrodes are either @xmath46 or @xmath47 of front - back or right - left distance of the skull ( see figure  [ fig : positions ] ) .",
    "the electrodes are assumed to record the electrical activity of the underlying cortical area that , in turn , is given by the interaction of the activity of all the neurons of that area .",
    "the eeg signals used in this study were collected at the children s hospital boston , and they consists of eeg recordings from pediatric subjects with intractable seizures .",
    "subjects were monitored for up to several days following withdrawal of anti - seizure medication in order to characterize their seizures and assess their candidacy for surgical intervention . from the physionet database we obtained 33 eegs with at least one epileptic event and 33 records of eeg without epileptic events , by looking for patients with the same number of sensors and with recordings of the same length .",
    "each record contains 23 one - dimensional signals with a sampling frequency of 256 hz and of 921600 time points .            upon these data we build to kind of different complexes : the piecewise complexes and the vietoris - rips complexes",
    ".      piecewise linear function ( pl ) is a powerful mathematical tool largely used for approximating signals .",

    "however , the reader can recognize that the epileptic patients are principally characterized by 3 sensors , respectively with ids : 1 , 2 and 5 ( see figure  [ fig : positions ] for matching the positions of the sensors ) . while the healthy patients are strongly characterized by sensor number 2 and also by sensors numbers : 1 , 3 , 7 , 10 and 13 .",
    "a potential interpretation is that , at least for this cohort , the epileptic events are on load of a few cortical columns , while conversely , healthy patients were stressed with stimuli that are recognized by more cortical columns .",
    "we argue this seminal result should be further investigated and if it will be validated it might be used for defining ad - hoc treatment .    as future work we aim to exploit some authors results to characterize the synchronization of n - neurons interaction in term of oscillatory models ( e.g. kuramoto model )  @xcite .",
