    "the recent , first , direct detection @xcite of gravitational waves ( gw ) from a binary black hole merger by advanced ligo @xcite has opened a new window for the investigation of astrophysical compact objects .",
    "the new generation gw detectors advanced ligo and advanced virgo @xcite are also expected to reveal an incoming gravitational transient signal from binary neutron stars ( bns ) coalescence and merger , once their sensitivity at higher frequencies will increase . at design sensitivity , the rate of bns signals detected is predicted to be in the interval ( 0.2 - 200 ) per year @xcite , making them the next target for gw detection .",
    "these expected detections present a unique way to learn about the physics of matter at the extreme conditions present in neutron stars and the eos of nuclear matter above the nuclear density .",
    "fully general relativistic simulations of bns started in 1999 @xcite but it is since the crucial breakthroughs of 2005 @xcite that numerical relativity is the main instrument to study the dynamics of the merger of compact objects .",
    "this has lead to the development of community driven public software like the einstein toolkit @xcite and the lorene library @xcite that allow to openly simulate such systems and in particular bns coalescence and merger @xcite .",
    "simulation of bns mergers , where numerical relativity is almost the only available tool , is one of the main endeavors to study the possible gravitational waveforms that will be discovered by the present detectors .",
    "for this reason there is now a considerable effort ( using both public and private codes ) in analyzing the effect of the eos used to describe matter on the gravitational - wave signal ( see @xcite and reference therein ) , and to explore other directions like incorporating in the codes more microphysical ingredients , such as finite temperature nuclear eoss with neutrino emission @xcite and magnetic fields @xcite , to accurately simulate the physics of the post - merger remnant ( either a ( hyper)massive neutron star ( hmns ) or a black hole ( bh ) surrounded by an accretion disk ) .",
    "however , despite all the progress , numerical modeling of bnss should still be considered an exploratory study due to a number of not completely settled issues .",
    "some of those issues are : the techniques for initial data generation and the determination of their accuracy ; the evolution code convergence properties and the selection of the optimal numerical resolution ; and , more importantly , the choice of an appropriate modeling for the neutron star eos , still unknown from the microphysical and the experimental points of view .",
    "this is reflected by the fact that there is also a lot of effort in trying to develop analytical techniques to compute the gravitational - wave signal ( to be compared and validated by numerical relativity ones ) from the inspiral phase of compact binary mergers @xcite , among which the effective one body ( eob ) @xcite approach was particularly successful .",
    "recently , tidal effects have been included in those analytical models @xcite . from the measurements of tidal effects in the inspiral gravitational signal the eos of the neutron star core",
    "can be distinguished @xcite . to contribute to this task ,",
    "many - orbits ( > 10 ) bns simulations with nuclear eoss have been performed lately , comparing their gravitational signals to various eob formulations with tidal effects and taylor - expanded post - newtonian ( pn ) expressions @xcite .",
    "the latter is challenging , because most of the initial data used are eccentric , and the number of orbits used are not , in any sense , close to the @xmath5 175 orbits that were used in similar studies of binary black hole systems  @xcite .",
    "the present work improves the results of  @xcite focusing on the techniques to extract the gravitational - wave signal from numerical simulations ; the analysis of the eccentricity of the orbits obtained evolving quasi - circular initial data and its impact on the gravitational waveforms ; the dependence of results on the number of simulated pre - merger orbits , and different neutron star eoss .    in detail",
    ", we present new long - term ( up to 16 orbits ) equal - mass bns simulations with four different nuclear eoss , starting with four different values of the interbinary distance @xmath6 ( @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 , and @xmath2 km ) .",
    "the comparison of simulations starting from different initial orbital frequencies is a necessary and fundamental test to evaluate the accuracy of current numerical bns simulations and their ability to model tidal effects . in particular ,",
    "long numerical simulations are needed to construct hybrid analytical - numerical waveforms for gw detectors data analysis where it is important to know how many orbits before merger can be effectively simulated using current numerical methods and resolutions .",
    "the outline of this paper is the following : in section [ sec : setup ] we describe the numerical methods employed in our code and the initial models we choose to evolve . in section [ sec : gw ]",
    "we describe the techniques we tested for extracting , integrating and extrapolating to null infinity the gravitational - wave signal . in section [ sec : eccentricity ]",
    "we briefly comment on the eccentricity of the orbits from the evolution of quasi - circular initial data .",
    "in section [ sec : comparison ] we present our results about the comparison of simulations of the same model starting with different initial frequencies .",
    "finally , in section [ sec : conclusion ] we summarize the main results of the present work .    throughout this paper",
    "we use a space - like signature @xmath10 , with greek indices running from 0 to 3 , latin indices from 1 to 3 , and the standard convention for summation over repeated indices .",
    "the computations are performed using the standard @xmath11 split into ( usually ) space - like coordinates @xmath12 and a time - like coordinate @xmath13 .",
    "our coordinate system @xmath14 ( far from the origin ) has , as it can be checked , almost isotropic coordinates and far from the origin they would have the usual measure unit of `` time '' and `` space '' .",
    "in particular , @xmath13 is time when measured from an observer at infinity .",
    "all computations have been done in normalized computational units ( hereafter denoted as cu ) in which @xmath15 .",
    "we report the radius of the spheres used for gravitational waves extraction in cus .",
    "we used the exact same code setup as our previous study about binary neutron star mergers @xcite , which is why we refer the interest reader to that work and the references within for details of the setup . here",
    "we only summarize for clarity the most important components and numerical algorithms .",
    "a fundamental aspect for us is that this work has been produced using only free , open source software and as such can be reproduced and extended by anyone in the scientific community .",
    "the dynamical evolution of the analyzed models was computed using the einstein toolkit @xcite .",
    "the einstein toolkit is a free , publicly available , community - driven general relativistic ( gr ) code based on the ` cactus ` @xcite computational framework . in particular , we have chosen the eleventh release ( code name `` hilbert '' , et_2015_05 ) .",
    "some local modifications and additions were necessary , all of which are open - source and freely available from the subversion server of the parma university gravity group @xcite , and all of which are planned to be proposed for the next release of the einstein toolkit .",
    "the data are evolved on a cartesian mesh with 6 levels of mesh refinement , each with a double resolution respect to the parent level .",
    "the outer boundary of the grid is set at @xmath16 km from its center , to be able to extract the gravitational signal far from the source .",
    "the standard grid spacing on the innermost level used for this paper is @xmath17 m , which in @xcite we found sufficient to get qualitatively good results .",
    "we used a mirror symmetry across the @xmath18 plane consistent with the symmetry of the problem , in order to reduce the computational costs by a factor two . the grid structure and the code parallelization",
    "are handled by the ` carpet ` code @xcite .",
    "the spacetime metric evolution is performed by the ` mclachlan ` module @xcite , implementing a @xmath11 dimensional split of the einstein equations using the bssn - nok formalism @xcite and solving them with fourth - order finite differences .",
    "the general relativistic hydrodynamics ( grhd ) equations are solved by the module ` grhydro ` @xcite with high resolution shock capturing techniques using the fifth - order weno reconstruction method @xcite and the hlle riemann solver @xcite .",
    "the time integration is performed with a fourth - order runge - kutta method @xcite with a constant courant factor of @xmath19 .",
    "kreiss - olinger dissipation @xcite is applied to the curvature evolution quantities in order to damp high - frequency noise .",
    "we chose in particular the combination of the bssn - nok formulation of the einstein equations and the weno reconstruction method among the possibilities provided by the einstein toolkit because in @xcite we observed that combination of algorithms to enter the convergent regime already at low resolutions , allowing us to obtain reliable results without the need to perform computationally expensive simulations at higher resolution .",
    "our initial data are generated with the open source lorene library @xcite , which is able to compute quasi - equilibrium configurations for binary irrotational neutron stars in quasi - circular orbits .",
    "this is achieved imposing the presence of the helical killing vector @xmath20 . from the imposition of this symmetry",
    "the initial data do not incorporate a radial velocity component coming from the gravitational radiation reaction .",
    "this will lead to the presence of a tangible eccentricity in the stars orbit during their evolution ( see section [ sec : eccentricity ] and ref .",
    "@xcite for more details ) .",
    "the true eos for nuclear matter in an environment similar to a neutron star is still not known , not even assuming a small effect of the temperature , i.e. , a cold neutron star , as expected here for initial data .",
    "we thus have to simulate the effect of different plausible eoss on observable quantities , in the hope to learn about the eos indirectly through these observations .",
    "the four cold eoss for nuclear matter at beta equilibrium that we employed are , in decreasing order of compactness :    * the * apr4 * eos @xcite , obtained using variational chain summation methods with the argonne two - nucleon interaction and including also boost corrections and three - nucleon interactions , * the * sly * eos @xcite , based on the skyrme lyon effective nuclear interaction , * the * h4 * eos @xcite , constructed in a relativistic mean field framework including also hyperons contributions and tuning the parameters to have the stiffest possible eos compatible with astrophysical data , and * the * ms1 * eos @xcite , constructed with relativistic mean field theory considering only standard nuclear matter .",

    "we presented results from numerical simulations of bns mergers using four different nuclear eoss for the ns interior and starting from four different values for the interbinary distance .",
    "we tested different procedures for the extrapolation of the gravitational wave signal @xmath3 , extracted at finite radii , to null infinity .",
    "in particular , we used for the first time in bns simulations the second order perturbative extrapolation of  @xcite , show - casing advantages in reducing the extraction errors with respect to the first - order extrapolation  @xcite .",
    "we also showed that the error of the wave extraction procedure , after the extrapolation , is smaller than the typical numerical errors reported for this kind of bns simulations , even in the first part of the signal .",
    "we proposed a simple procedure to integrate the newman - penrose scalar @xmath3 to obtain the gravitational wave strain @xmath4 , based on applying a high - pass digital filter to @xmath4 after a time - domain integration , instead of filtering @xmath3 before a frequency domain integration , which currently is the most common procedure in numerical relativity @xcite .",
    "our procedure gives the cleanest signal when applying it after the extrapolation formula , whose integral terms introduce additional low - frequency noise .",
    "we computed the small orbital eccentricity due to the quasi - circular initial data for all models , showing a dependence on the ns eos but not being able to show any clear dependence on the starting distance between the stars .",
    "we compared the amplitude of our simulations with a recently developed analytical model for eccentric binaries @xcite , showing good agreement in the first part of the signal .",
    "this is a confirmation of the fact that the gravitational wave amplitude oscillations are really an imprint of the orbital eccentricity and of the quality of the simple , approximate , eccentricity calculation procedure we used .",
    "this result confirms also that initial data eccentricity is , until the very last few orbits , the main source of discrepancy between gravitational waves computed with numerical relativity and point - particle post - newtonian approximations .    in order to understand the relevance of this measured initial data eccentricity , we compared two analytical waveforms at the same pn order , with the same mass and initial frequency of our @xmath30 km models , one with the same eccentricity of our numerical simulations .",
    "their difference in phase is almost always below typical numerical errors in current bns simulations , except for the last orbit of models with the same eccentricity of our more compact ones ( with apr4 and sly eoss ) .",
    "the detectability of their difference in advanced ligo is small , requiring a maximum distance of @xmath31 mpc for its detection at @xmath32 .",
    "this is due to the shortness of current numerical simulations with respect to the whole frequency band of interferometric detectors",
    ". the effect of eccentricity will be more important when longer numerical simulations will be performed for gw detector data analysis .",
    "techniques for reducing initial data eccentricity have been developed by some groups in the last couple of years @xcite . since the recent beginning of the advanced detector era",
    ", we see an urgent need for public low - eccentricity bns initial data in the numerical relativity community .    we compared the results of simulations with the same ns eos and different starting interbinary distance .",
    "their emitted gravitational signals show large phase differences in the last orbits before merger , when aligning them with the standard formula , allowing only for a relative shift in the time variable . when we aligned them allowing for a time dilatation , to account for the longer effective merger time of simulations with @xmath33 km , the remaining phase differences were close to the expected numerical errors .",
    "this effective merger time difference was found to be higher for more compact stars .    investigating the post - merger spectrum",
    ", we found that simulations starting from @xmath30 km have the dominant peak at a somewhat lower frequency ( but still consistent with the error ) than the others , while we found a very good agreement with the results of  @xcite for simulations starting from a distance of @xmath34 km .",
