    "in the last few years , selection techniques at different wavelengths have revealed a variety of , at first glance , different high redshift source populations ( e.g. , steidel et al . 1996 ; 2004 ; smail et al .",

    "highly debated questions are how these objects are linked to each other ; how much they overlap with each other ; and what the evolutionary path is , if any , between them and with the different types of low redshift galaxies .",
    "observations in the local universe are indicating ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ) that the stars in massive early - type galaxies formed in general at high redshift , @xmath8 , with short formation timescales , suggesting high peak star - formation rates ( sfrs ) .",
    "populations of high redshift galaxies , among those mentioned above , having large stellar masses and high sfrs have indeed also been found . however a detailed characterization of the formation of early - type galaxies is still missing .",
    "recently , @xcite presented a technique based on optical / near - ir photometry in the @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath6 bands that , at least to @xmath11 , allows to obtain virtually complete samples of galaxies at redshift @xmath12 , including star - forming and passively evolving galaxies .",
    "this technique is reddening independent for @xmath5 star - forming galaxies , that in @xmath13 samples have sfrs estimated between @xmath14 solar masses per year .",
    "these sfrs require large and possibly uncertain reddening corrections .",
    "the average long - wavelength emission properties of @xmath0 star - forming galaxies ( @xmath15s hereafter ) at @xmath16 have been measured accurately by @xcite , finding that the typical @xmath15 is an ultra luminous infra - red galaxy ( ulirg ) with @xmath17 . as the @xmath0 technique is substantially complete for @xmath5 galaxies , one expect that also submm / mm selected galaxies ( smgs , see blain et al .",

    "we subtracted the correlated skynoise from the surrounding channels .",
    "the outstanding weather conditions  opacity below @xmath43 during 60% of the time  ensured stability and high data quality over the several days in which the data where gathered .",
    "a flux of about 1.31.5  mjy ( significant at @xmath44  level ) is detected in the reference bolometers corresponding to the positions of two of the five @xmath15 galaxies ( obj2742 and obj2426 ; see table  [ tab : bzkprop ] ) .",

    "would require further observations between 24@xmath4 m and 1.2 mm , and especially in the range 60100@xmath4 m rest - frame , that could constrain the temperature of the dust . for @xmath16",
    ", obtaining these data to the required depths is beyond the possibilities of the available observing capabilities .",
    "however , we can derive constraints on the total ir luminosities ( and thus sfrs ) by assuming these 2 detections have ir seds similar to those of well studied @xmath16 populations , i.e. the average @xmath15 galaxies ( daddi et al . 2005 ) or scuba selected galaxies ( chapman et al .",
    "2005 ) , or by assuming that local empirical correlations between mid - ir or submm luminosities and @xmath57 ( e.g. chary & elbaz 2001 ) holds also at @xmath16 .",
    "we find that this suggests ir luminosities in the range of @xmath58@xmath59 , which correspond to sfrs in the range 5001500@xmath60 , the factor of 3 uncertainty being indicative of the range of estimates from the different methods .",
    "we considered the possibility that the detected mm fluxes are due to agn emission .",
    "the submm - to - x - ray spectral slope @xmath61 ( alexander et al . 2003 ) is an indicator of agn activity .",
    "for the two mambo - detected @xmath15s we derive an upper limit of @xmath62 between 850@xmath4 m and 1.2  mm fluxes , that are the factors spanned by the models at the luminosities of our objects . ] that , if compared to fig .  7 in @xcite ,",
    "points toward the starburst part of the diagram occupied , e.g. , by scuba galaxies in hdfn and arp  220 , and exclude both luminous unobscured ( 3c273 ) and obscured quasars .",
    "of course , this does not allow us to completely discard the presence of compton thick agns ( ngc  6240 ) .",
    "however , the lack of any agn features in the uv spectra , together with the reasonable agreement between uv- and far - ir- estimated sfrs , suggest that the far - ir activity of these sources is powered by star formation",
    ".    an interesting result of our observations is indeed that the ir luminosities and related sfrs inferred for our objects from the mm fluxes are in quite a good agreement , at most a factor 23 larger than those estimated from the dust - reddening corrected uv luminosities ( fig .",
    "[ fig : sfr ] , top panel ) .",
    "this agreement , already noticed by @xcite for the typical @xmath15 galaxy , is somewhat surprising .",
    "a fairly different situation seemingly holds for submm / mm selected galaxies ( chapman et al . 2005 ; swinbank et al .",
    "2004 ) and for local far - ir selected ulirgs ( goldader et al .",
    "2002 , with only a notable exception ) , where the observed ir luminosities and far - ir estimated sfrs exceed by 12 orders of magnitude the same quantities estimated from the dust corrected uv luminosities ( fig .",
    "[ fig : sfr ] , top panel ) . extending this comparison further ( fig .",
    "[ fig : sfr ] , bottom panel ) , we notice that @xmath40 galaxies in this paper and in daddi et al .",
    "( 2005 ) are generally brighter in the @xmath6 band ( @xmath63  mag ) than the typical counterparts of mambo galaxies @xcite and scuba sources ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , although they lie at a similar redshift @xmath5 .",
    "the mm / submm fluxes of smgs are instead generally higher than those of @xmath40 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : sfr ] ) .",
    "this implies a significantly different @xmath6-band to submm / mm flux ratio between far - ir selected vs. optically selected @xmath5 galaxies",
    ".    similarities also exist between @xmath15s and far - ir selected populations both in their irregular morphologies ( conselice et al .",
    "2004 ; trentham et al .",
    "1999 ; daddi et al .",
    "2004a ; this paper , see fig .",
    "[ fig : mambob ] ) and in their red observed uv slopes ( i.e. high apparent reddening ; chapman et al .",
    "2005 ; daddi et al . 2004b ; 2005 ; goldader et al . 2002 ; this paper , see table  1 ) . the differences ( submm / mm flux levels , @xmath6-band to submm / mm ratios and @xmath64 to @xmath65 ratios ) and similarities ( morphologies , uv slopes ) are most likely effects induced by the different selection of the samples ( @xmath6-band versus far - ir ) , and can be reasonably understood by assuming that the far - ir emitting region of most smgs is observed behind a thick dust screen , nearly opaque to the optical and near - ir radiation .",
    "this can be fit into an evolutionary scenario in which the starburst galaxies are initially deeply embedded into a large column density of dust , during the submm / mm brightest phase when substantial obscuration of a few magnitudes or more is present even at observed @xmath6-band ( rest - frame @xmath66    for @xmath67 ) . the uv light is almost completely attenuated behind the dust screen so that it is impossible to measure the ongoing sfr from the residual uv light transmitted .",
    "as time passes by , sfr and l@xmath55 are reduced and the dust is diffused and ejected out of the main star - formation regions ( presumably by galactic winds or other kinds of feedback ) , or simply destroyed . thus the resulting galaxy is brighter in the near - ir and transparent enough in the rest frame uv that the transmitted light can account for the ongoing sfr after reddening correction .",
    "the submm brightest phase has presumably a short duration ( @xmath68 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , while the subsequent _ normal _ @xmath15 phase is estimated to last quite longer ( @xmath691  gyr ; daddi et al .",
    "2005 ) , which would explain why smgs have a factor of 10 or more lower spatial density @xcite , while having similar masses ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and perhaps spatial clustering @xcite .",
    "this picture is consistent with the evolutionary scenario proposed by vega et al .",
    "chapman et al .",
    "( 2005 ) also suggest that smgs evolve into near - ir bright galaxies .",
    "we conclude by suggesting that the follow - up of the most uv active @xmath15 could be a promising alternative for finding submm / mm sources , possible complementary to the radio pre - selection method presented by @xcite for a similar redshift range @xmath70 , or the spitzer@xmath71mips pre - selection ( lutz et al 2005 ) .",
