    "a complete scenario for the formation and evolution of multiple - population globular clusters requires the identification of the source(s ) of gas with chemical properties consistent with the observed abundance patterns and out of which second - generation ( sg ) stars might have formed along with models following the dynamics of this gas , the sg formation history and the subsequent early and long - term dynamical evolution of the multiple - population cluster .",

( 2008 ) , we have modelled the formation and dynamical evolution of the sg population forming from the ejecta of first - generation ( fg ) intermediate - mass agb stars ; one of the predictions of our study was that the sg population would form in a compact subsystem concentrated in the inner regions of the fg cluster .",
    "in a subsequent study on the long - term evolution of multiple - population clusters ( vesperini et al . 2013 ) we have shown that some memory of the initial spatial segregation of the sg population should be preserved in many galactic clusters and , indeed , several observational studies ( see e.g. sollima et al . 2007 , bellini et al .",

    "( 2011 ) we have carried out an initial investigation of this issue by combining @xmath0-body and semi - analytical calculations of the disruption of binaries in multiple - population clusters .",
    "our study showed that sg binary disruption rate can indeed be significantly larger than that of fg binaries and that the overall binary disruption rate in multiple - population clusters is larger than that of a single population cluster without the central sg dense subsystem .",

    "( 2010 ) , although based on a small sample of ba stars , suggests that the fraction of sg binaries might indeed be smaller than that of fg binaries .    as for the connection with observational studies , as already pointed out in vesperini et al .",
    "( 2011 ) and further discussed in more detail in this paper , it is important to emphasize the differences between the theoretical predictions concerning the global binary fraction and the local binary fraction measured at different distances from the cluster centre .",
    "specifically , we will show in this paper that even if the global sg binary fraction is smaller than the fg one , the local sg binary fraction measured in the cluster innermost regions may still be larger than the fg one .    in this paper",
