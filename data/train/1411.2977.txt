    "although these data are not likely to be representative of the intrinsic variability properties of these two agn over similar time scales as that covered by the observations of the rest of this sub - sample , omitting these datasets do not change the results ( table[tab : lopluvlinmix ] ) .",
    "figure[fig : lrel ] shows that the single - object @xmath4(optical)@xmath36(uv ) relationships do not fall on top of the best fit to the global relationship ( solid line in figure[fig : lrel ] ) but instead show slight zero - point offsets .",
    "these offsets can be due to , e.g. , ( 1 ) intrinsic differences in the spectral energy distributions between objects , ( 2 ) imperfect host galaxy flux subtraction , ( 3 ) imperfect absolute spectrophotometric calibration , which was performed differently for the optical and uv data , or ( 4 ) uncorrected internal dust reddening in the agn host galaxy that will be different for each object . note that while the former two effects can impact both the zero - point and slope of the native @xmath4(optical ) @xmath3 @xmath4(uv ) relationship , the latter two will not affect the slope of the native relationship .",

    "however , since the ` year5 ' dataset only covers 37 days , while ` year1 ' covers 236 days , the shallower slope may also be related to the time span over which we have simultaneous optical and uv data , in this case .",
    "this is confirmed in figure  [ fig : figb1 ] : we selected from the ` year1 ' dataset subsamples in multiples of 37 days ( i.e. , 37 days , 74 days , and 111 days , respectively ; the time span is not necessarily of contiguous days as time gaps exist ) and measured the slope for each data subset .",
    "we see a clear tendency for a wider range of slopes ( between 0.18 and 0.66 ) for subsets of 37 days than for subsets of 111 days ( slope@xmath10.6 ) .",
    "these results demonstrate that since agn continuum variations are unpredictable , when the slope is determined from data covering relatively short time spans , it can generally not be assumed to be valid at other times . in that case",
    ", the slope distribution is more likely to exhibit a larger dispersion because the data capture individual , shorter time - scale variability events ( that can include either large amplitude changes or none at all ) , typical of seyferts observed over days to weeks . on the other hand ,",
    "the slope measured from data covering a longer time span is more likely to represent the variability characteristics observed over timescales of months to years ( often referred to as ` secular ' ) .",
    "the long - term variations likely correlate with the mean accretion state , which is typically much more stable , over dynamical timescales , or longer .",
    "another potential effect that can alter the slopes of the native , single - object @xmath4(optical)@xmath36(uv ) relationships is if the host galaxy flux contribution , @xmath138 ( table[tab : objects ] , column 5 ) , is mis - estimated .",
    "while the risk is low since we adopt the well - determined host flux measurements of @xcite based on high spatial resolution and high signal - to - noise _ hst _ and ground - based imaging , we test this possibility nonetheless . given the shallow slopes , the only way to get a linear relationship is to assume that the host galaxy flux level of each object is underestimated . to test this , we iteratively subtract an increasing amount of host galaxy flux in addition to that listed in table  [ tab : objects ] until we measure a slope of 1.0 for each source .",
    "we list this additional amount of host galaxy flux needed as @xmath139 in table  [ tab6 ] .",

    "we adopt the standard deviation as the observed scatter for this particular realization .    with 2000 realizations",
    "we obtain a distribution of the estimated scatter with a mean ( i.e. , the most likely scatter ) and standard deviation of @xmath201=0.106@xmath260.009 dex .",
    "this means that the combination of a steep native relationship and an assumed scatter in @xmath0 around the native relationship of @xmath135@xmath10.08dex will result in a typical scatter in the global relationship of @xmath10.11dex , if all agn vary like ngc5548 .",
    "the steep slope of the native relation alone ( i.e. , when @xmath135=0 ) contributes a mean scatter of @xmath202= 0.077dex@xmath260.007dex in the global relationship , entirely consistent with the scatter contributions adding in quadrature .    in reality",
    ", each agn will vary with a different native slope , @xmath32 , and scatter , @xmath135 , and a different @xmath199 around its mean luminosity , @xmath197@xmath4@xmath198 , and will thereby contribute with a higher or lower scatter to the global @xmath0(h@xmath32 ) @xmath3 @xmath4(5100 ) relationship than we estimate for ngc5548 .",
    "there are insufficient data to address the likely distributions of @xmath32 and @xmath135 for the @xmath0(h@xmath32 ) @xmath3 @xmath4(5100 ) relationships of individual agn , but there are indications that @xmath199 is luminosity dependent and therefore lower for quasars ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "although figure[fig : hts ] shows that ngc5548 does not have the most extreme optical variability properties of the rm agn within a single rm campaign , it has exhibited the largest @xmath4(5100 ) differences , @xmath203 , on long time scales @xcite ; a larger @xmath199 will result in larger @xmath203 .",
    "therefore , by adopting the same @xmath199=0.3dex value for all agn in the simulations , we obtain an upper limit on the expected global scatter .",
    "our tests show that as the luminosity distributions narrow to @xmath199 =  0.1dex , the mean scatter @xmath202 approaches 0.085dex , a scatter slightly higher than the assumed scatter in the native relationship , @xmath135 . our analyses also show that as @xmath32 approaches the slope of the global relationship ( i.e. , the agn vary _ along _ the global relationship , as opposed to across it ) , the expected global scatter @xmath202 converges on the assumed value of @xmath135 .",
    "this underscores the importance of further understanding the existing scatter in the single - object relationship and its effect on the global relationship .",
    "our estimates of the expected global scatter of @xmath10.11dex , assuming all agn vary like ngc5548 , is a significant fraction of the observed scatter of 0.13dex determined by @xcite for the empirical global @xmath200 relationship .",
    "we note that while our simulated native relationships do contain a scatter ( or noise ) contribution ( i.e. , @xmath135@xmath1980 ) that can include some measurement uncertainties due to , for example , small inaccuracies in the @xmath0 measurements , the scatter we simulated will not take into account other known sources of scatter in the global @xmath200 relationship due to distance measurements or poorly constrained lags that are included in the scatter measured by bentz et al .",
    "the fact that we can account for a large fraction of the observed global scatter is good news .",
    "understanding the origin of the scatter means that there is a potential for mitigating it ."
