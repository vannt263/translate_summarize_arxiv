    "an enormous amount of papers , both experimental and theoretical , are devoted to the nmr and nqr studies of copper in superconducting yba@xmath4cu@xmath1o@xmath6 layered cuprates . it is considered well known that in non - superconducting materials ( @xmath7 ) nuclei of copper located in the cuo@xmath0 planes experience the influence of a strong internal magnetic field @xmath8 koe which is perpendicular to the @xmath9 axis , and that in superconductors ( @xmath10 ) such field is absent and @xmath11cu(2 ) nuclei with the spin @xmath12 give typical nqr spectra at frequencies of @xmath13 mhz , i.e. , in the same frequency range as that for nqr spectra of two - fold coordinated  chain  copper @xmath11cu(1 ) @xcite .",
    "while studying nmr of thulium in oxygen - deficient tmba@xmath4cu@xmath1o@xmath2 compounds @xcite we have discovered the wide and subtle absorption line ( fig.1 ) which looked like copper nmr line but could not have been attributed to the mentioned cu(2 ) and cu(1 ) centers with @xmath13 mhz and @xmath14 .",
    "we consequently undertook experiments with tmba@xmath4cu@xmath1o@xmath2 samples ( @xmath15 , 0.6 , 0.7 ) in zero external field at t=4.2k , which allowed us to observe a cu(2 ) zfnmr spectrum completely different from those described in the literature .",
    "the results of these experiments are presented in this paper .",
    "the analysis of cu(2 ) spectra of both types corresponding to @xmath16 ( type @xmath17 , @xmath18 mhz ) and @xmath14 ( type @xmath19 , @xmath20 mhz ) shows that each of them belongs to two varieties of cu(2 ) centers , @xmath21 and @xmath22 , possessing different nqr frequencies and that @xmath23 and @xmath24centers differ much in the value of @xmath25 .",
    "similar results are obtained for one yba@xmath4cu@xmath1o@xmath26 sample@xcite .",
    "the tmba@xmath4cu@xmath1o@xmath2 samples used in these experiments were @xmath27-axis - oriented powders mixed with paraffin ( hereafter denoted as tm6+x ) .",
    "they were previously used for tm nmr studies @xcite .",
    "all of them were stored at room temperature for almost 6 years after preparation .",
    "critical temperatures ( t@xmath28=53k , 61k and 64k for @xmath15 , 0.6 and 0.7 , respectively ) were obtained from measurements of the diamagnetic susceptibility at a frequency of 1 khz .",
    "home - built spin - echo nqr spectrometers were used for the cu(2 ) nqr and zfnmr measurements .",
    "examples of the copper nqr spectra in tm6.6 are shown in fig.2 . comparing the non - saturated ( ns ) and saturated ( s ) spectra ( figs.2a , b ) taken at 4.2k with pulse sequence repetition rates of 1 and 200 hz , respectively , one can distinguish two contributions with different spin - lattice relaxation times @xmath29 ( fig.2c ) and separate them ( figs.2d , e ) by using a simple subtraction procedure .",
    "two narrow lines in fig.2e corresponding to the long @xmath30 time are believed to originate from the two - fold coordinated cu(1)@xmath4 sites which belong to  empty chains  surrounded by ",
    "full chains  in the cuo@xmath31 plane @xcite .",
    "the broad spectrum in fig.2d characterized by the short @xmath30 has a two - hump shape typical for the cu(2 ) nqr spectrum of an annealed sample @xcite . in the following it",
    "is denoted as the spectrum of type @xmath19 .",
    "computer simulations have shown that this two - hump spectrum can be described by a sum of four gaussians ( two sites , @xmath32 and @xmath33 , times two isotopes , @xmath34cu and @xmath35cu ) , the amounts of @xmath32- and @xmath33-sites appearing in a ratio of approximately 2:1 independent of the oxygen index @xmath5 .",
    "the parameters of the spectra taken with a fixed pulse separation time @xmath36 are given in table i for three samples studied .",
    "the cu(2 ) zfnmr ( type @xmath17 ) spectra taken at 4.2k with a fixed pulse separation time @xmath37 are shown in fig.3 .",
    "a similar spectrum was observed in tm6.6 at a temperature of 77k ( shown by filled squares in fig.3b ) .",
    "it should be noted here that in our experiments the well pronounced spectra of type @xmath17 were observed only in those tm- and y - compounds which exhibited well pronounced two - hump spectra of type @xmath19 ( fig.2d ) .",
    "an obvious downfall of the spectral intensity at around 98 mhz which looks particularly pronounced at @xmath5=0.7 clearly shows that the zfnmr spectrum is also composed of two contributions , those are the low - frequency fragment ( lff ) at 55 - 98 mhz and the high - frequency fragment ( hff ) at 98 - 135 mhz .    in order to estimate the integrated intensities , @xmath38 and @xmath39 , of the zfnmr ( type @xmath17 ) and nqr ( type @xmath19 ) spectra ,",
    "we have corrected them according to the spin - spin relaxation times @xmath40 measured at the main peaks of the spectra .",
    "all spin - echo decays measured at 4.2k have been found to obey the following formula : @xmath41 . in the series of tm compounds , the longest @xmath40-times were measured for the tm6.6 sample : @xmath40=72 , 64 , 119 , 75 , 43 and 54 @xmath42 at frequencies of 62 , 74 , 87 , 109 , 116 and 124 mhz , respectively ; the values of @xmath43 were found to lie in the range 0.7 - 0.9 . because of the broad frequency range the echo intensity has also been corrected by a factor @xmath44 , one factor @xmath45 due to the nuclear magnetization , the other one due to the precession frequency of the nuclear magnetization .",
    "the @xmath40-correction procedure consisted of four steps : ( i ) fitting the experimental cu(2 ) spectra by a superposition of gaussians ( 6 for type @xmath17 and 4 for type @xmath19 ) ; ( ii ) multiplying intensity of each component by the corresponding factor @xmath46 ; ( iii ) summation of the corrected gaussian lines ; ( iv ) @xmath44 correction .",
    "the resulting spectra are shown by solid lines in fig.4 .",
    "the results of the best fit for the tm6.51 and tm6.6 samples show the lff- and hff - intensities to be in a ratio @xmath47 which allows us to ascribe them , in analogy with the above @xmath19-type spectrum , to the @xmath48- and @xmath49-sites , respectively . in table",
    "ii , the partial ratios @xmath50 and @xmath51 for spectral intensities of the @xmath21- and @xmath22-sites are given along with the ratio @xmath52 .",
    "the absolute values of the signal intensities per 1 gram of material , @xmath38 and @xmath39 , shown in the last column of table ii , are normalized to the intensity of the  ordinary ",
    "cu(2 ) zfnmr spectrum of the tmba@xmath4cu@xmath1o@xmath53 antiferromagnet as observed at t=4.2k in the frequency range from 61 to 123 mhz .",
    "as can be seen from the last column of table ii , the volume fraction of the material contributing to the total cu(2 ) resonance absorption varies from sample to sample being equal to 1.00 , 0.58 and 0.83 in tm6.51 , tm6.6 and tm6.7 , respectively , as compared to tm6.1 .",
    "since the cu(2 ) zfnmr spectrum is certainly produced by a non - superconductor , the question arises : what part of the cu(2 ) nqr signal intensity can be attributed to the superconducting fraction ? to answer this question ,",
    "we have re - measured the ac diamagnetic susceptibility of the tm6+x samples ( x=@xmath54)@xcite at a temperature of 4.2 k. the results of the measurements ( see inset in fig.1 ) clearly show that the superconducting fraction decreases with ageing time ( with no changes in t@xmath55 ) , the tendency being most pronounced for the 60k - superconductors , and that the superconducting fraction of the 6-years old samples under study is quite small , i.e. , 0.05 , 0.05 and 0.15 for tm6.51 , tm6.6 and tm6.7 , respectively .",
    "comparing the latter quantities with the cu(2 ) nqr signal intensities ( 0.79 , 0.42 and 0.73 , respectively ) , one arrives at the conclusion that at least a part of the cu(2 ) absorption observed at 4.2k definitely originates from the non - superconducting material .",
    "this conclusion is also supported by the fact that in one of the samples studied , yba@xmath4cu@xmath1o@xmath26 , which was prepared quite recently , we did not observe a two - hump nqr , nor a zfnmr spectrum@xcite .",
    "in order to clarify the origin of the lff- and hff - spectra , we have tried to fit the cu(2 ) zfnmr in a correct way assuming that the @xmath48- and @xmath49-sites can be characterized by different values of @xmath56 , @xmath25 and @xmath57 ( angle between * h*@xmath58 and the @xmath27-axis ) . prior to fitting the experimental spectra ( fig.3 )",
    "have been @xmath40-corrected by the function @xmath59 , where @xmath60 is the zfnmr spectrum shown in fig.4 by a dotted line , and @xmath61 is the spectrum represented by a solid line .",
    "the spectra of tm6.51 and tm6.6 corrected in this way are shown in fig.5 .",
    "the fitting procedure included numeric diagonalization of the two hamiltonians and calculation of all the transitions probabilities ( @xmath62 ) .",
    "when calculating averaged values of the probabilities in oriented powdered samples , we have taken an orientation of a radiofrequency field with respect to the @xmath27-axis into account ( * h*@xmath63 ) .",
    "in all the cases considered , the lorentzian shape of an individual resonance line was found to fit the experimental data much better than the gaussian one .",
    "two versions of the fit have been considered .",
    "when the angles @xmath57 were allowed to be free , the best fit of the cu(2 ) zfnmr spectrum of tm6.51 was obtained at the following parameters ( see solid line in fig.5a ) : @xmath64 @xmath65 the corresponding parameters for the tm6.6 sample have been obtained as follows ( fig.5b ) : @xmath66 @xmath67 in the second version ( @xmath68 ) both internal fields were assumed to lie in the @xmath69 plane .",
    "the results of this fit for tm6.6 are as follows ( see solid line in fig.5c ) : @xmath70 @xmath71 ( @xmath72 denotes the fixed parameters ) .",
    "the second fit seems to agree with experiment worse than the first one , but this can be due to incorrect intensities of the hff - lines deduced from the t@xmath4-correction procedure .",
    "we believe that at the present stage both versions can be considered satisfactory ; more experimental work is needed to make a choice between them . in both cases the cu(2 )",
    "nmr line in fig.1 has been identified as originating from two groups of @xmath48-lines ( at 58 - 63 mhz and 74 - 79 mhz ) .    then summarizing all experimental facts",
    ", one should adopt that at least a part of the two - hump nqr spectrum , which is supposed to be typical for the annealed 123 superconductors with high t@xmath73s @xcite , and the zfnmr spectrum , which is observed in the 60k - superconductors exhibiting a well pronounced two - hump nqr , are actually representing a non - superconducting material . in what follows ,",
    "we try to speculate about the plausible structure of this material .",
    "it is known that a structural ( chemical ) micro - phase separation takes place in the oxygen - deficient 123 superconductors @xcite .",
    "therefore , one could naturally expect to find the defects of the crystal lattice in the form of layers ( reflecting the basic property of the layered structure itself ) and , following this way , could associate the two types of cu(2 ) spectra with two different non - superconducting micro - phases , i.e. , hole doped ( type @xmath19 ) and non - doped ( type @xmath17 ) layers , forming some kind of stacking sequence along the @xmath27-axis @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the coincidence of the @xmath74-values ( see eqs.(1)-(4 ) and table i ) in the two absolutely different phases lead us to consider that both types of cu(2 ) spectra might originate from the same cuo@xmath75 layers ( bilayers ) .    to make a choice between these two scenarios",
    ", one should use the neutron scattering data which gives a direct information on a magnetic structure of the oxygen - deficient 123 compounds .",
    "the thorough studies of the neutron scattering in yba@xmath76cu@xmath77o@xmath78 @xcite have resulted in a recent observation @xcite of incommensurate magnetic fluctuations peaked at @xmath79 with @xmath80 r.l.u .",
    "it was also found that the dynamical susceptibility @xmath81 at the incommensurate positions first appears at temperatures somewhat above t@xmath73 and then increases on cooling below t@xmath73 , altogether with the suppression of magnetic fluctuations at the commensurate points .",
    "these observations look similar to those for the la@xmath82nd@xmath83sr@xmath84cuo@xmath85 compounds@xcite and thus can be considered as giving evidence for a formation of a static ( or quasi - static ) stripe pattern in the cuo@xmath76 layers .",
    "the layer - by - layer separation scenario seems to be inconsistent with such a stripe model . on the contrary ,",
    "the stripe - like modulation of charge and spin densities in cuo@xmath76 layers resulting in an inequivalency of cu(2 ) sites looks very likely . indeed , analyzing the data of table",
    "ii , one can conclude that there could exist a certain value of @xmath86 ( close to 0.6 ) which corresponds to the following relations : @xmath87 these relations can be understood in the frame of the charge stripe model suggested in @xcite .",
    "a plausible stripe pattern corresponding to the optimally doped cuo@xmath76 planes ( @xmath88 hole per cuo@xmath76 unit ) is shown in fig.6a .",
    "if one takes every third stripe away ( fig.6b ) , the hole concentration @xmath89 becomes @xmath90 . according to the empirical formula @xmath91 , suggested by tallon et al .",
    "@xcite for x@xmath92 the concentration @xmath93 corresponds to @xmath94 0.64 which is close to what is expected for eq.(7 ) to hold .",
    "the magnetic superstructure shown in fig.6b has a period of 18 lattice spacings .",
    "this period and the diagonal direction [ 110 ] of the stripes in fig.6b exactly corresponds to the incommensurate magnetic fluctuations observed in yba@xmath76cu@xmath77o@xmath78 @xcite : the model in fig.6b predicts incommensurate peaks at @xmath79 with @xmath95 . in this stripe pattern , it is easy to distinguish four different cu(2 ) sites which could be identified as sites @xmath96 ( at borders of magnetic stripes ) , @xmath97 ( at centers of magnetic stripes ) , @xmath32 ( at borders of non - magnetic stripes ) , @xmath33 ( at centers of non - magnetic stripes ) . an alternative possibility is to ascribe the @xmath33-sites to copper atoms located at outer borders of the non - magnetic bi - stripes allowing the @xmath32-sites to occupy four lines of coppers inside the bi - stripes . in any case , however , one has a problem to explain why the transferred hyperfine field from the @xmath96-copper spins does not influence the nqr spectrum of the neighboring type-@xmath19 copper centers .",
    "further experimental work is necessary to better understand the allocation of the cu(2 ) centers responsible for the two - hump nqr spectrum .",
    "it is known that the observation of the static stripe - phase order of holes and spins in la@xmath82nd@xmath83sr@xmath84cuo@xmath85 @xcite has appeared possible due to pinning of the stripes by the neodymium impurities .",
    "what could be the reason for stripes to be pinned in non - stoichiometric 123 compounds ?",
    "we believe that the so - called  orthoiii  superstructure in cuo@xmath98 planes could cause pinning of charge stripes in cuo@xmath76 planes since this superstructure has a period ( @xmath99 ) commensurate with the period of the stripe pattern shown in fig.6b . a possibility for the ortoiii to form a stable phase at @xmath100 was proved by the electron @xcite , x - ray and neutron @xcite diffraction measurements . the above oxygen contents appear to be shifted to higher values than that ( @xmath86 ) expected for the condition eq.(7 ) to be fulfilled",
    ". however , the value of @xmath86 may happen to result from an interplay between the orthoiii ordering of cuo@xmath84 layers at @xmath101 and an appropriate hole doping of cuo@xmath76 layers ( @xmath93 per cuo@xmath76 at @xmath102 ) .",
    "experiments with an yba@xmath76cu@xmath77o@xmath103 single crystal @xcite have shown that the orthoiii phase is stable at temperatures below 75@xmath104c .",
    "therefore , the interactions responsible for the formation of the orthoiii phase seem to be rather weak and can be easily disturbed by thermally - activated oxygen diffusion .",
    "this feature of the t-@xmath5 phase diagram allows us to understand why the cu(2 ) zfnmr was observed in our experiments only in those 123 superconductors which were subjected to a very long - term room - temperature annealing .",
    "the cu(2 ) nuclear resonance spectra were studied at liquid helium temperatures in samples of oxygen - deficient 60k - superconductors , tmba@xmath4cu@xmath1o@xmath2 and yba@xmath4cu@xmath1o@xmath26 , stored at room temperature for a long time ( up to 6 years ) .",
    "cu(2 ) zfnmr spectra different from those known so far were observed , indicating the presence of a non - superconducting phase in the superconducting samples .",
    "the quantitative analysis of the copper resonance absorption intensities in different samples lead us to consider that both types of cu(2 ) spectra ( zfnmr at 55 - 135 mhz and at least a part of nqr at 25 - 32 mhz ) might originate from the same non - superconducting cuo@xmath4 layers decorated by the pinned charge stripes .",
