    "these are the lectures notes from a mini - course that i gave at the pcmi graduate summer school in 2015 .",
    "the goal is twofold .",
    "first i would like to introduce to the audience some interesting geometric objects that have representation - theoretic applications , and springer fibers and their generalizations are nice examples of such .",
    "second is to introduce orbital integrals with emphasis on its relationship with affine springer fibers , and thereby supplying background material for b - c .",
    "ng s mini - course on the fundamental lemmas .",
    "the geometric part of these lectures ( everything except  [ s : orb ] ) consists of the study of three types of `` fibers '' : springer fibers , affine springer fibers and hitchin fibers , with increasing complexity .",
    "we will study their geometric properties such as connectivity and irreducible components .",
    "we will construct certain group actions on these varieties , and use the action to study several nontrivial examples .",
    "most importantly we will study certain weyl group actions on the cohomology of these fibers which do not come from actions on the varieties themselves .",
    "the representation - theoretic significance of these three types of fibers and the analogy between them can be summarized in the following table .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     here @xmath0 stands for the affine hecke algebra , while daha stands for the double affine hecke algebra ; @xmath1 denotes an algebraic curve over @xmath2 ; @xmath3 and @xmath4 are the weyl group and extended affine weyl group .    in these lecture notes",
    "we do not try to give complete proofs to all statements but instead to point out interesting phenomena and examples .",
    "we do , however , give more or less complete proofs of several key results , such as    * theorem [ th : spr corr ] ( the springer correspondence ) ; * theorem [ th : ft quot ] ( finiteness properties of affine springer fibers ) ; * theorem [ th : orb coho ] ( cohomological interpretation of stable orbital integrals ) .",
    "the target readers for these lectures are beginning graduate students interested in geometric representation theory .",
    "we assume some basic algebraic geometry ( scheme theory , moduli problems , point counting over a finite field , etc ) though occasionally we will use the language of algebraic stacks .",
    "we also assume some lie theory ( reductive groups over an algebraic closed field and over a local field ) , but knowing @xmath5 and @xmath6 should be enough to understand most of these notes .",
    "the next remark is about the cohomology theory we use in these notes .",
    "since we work with algebraic varieties over a general field @xmath2 instead of @xmath7 , we will be using the tale cohomology with coefficients in @xmath8-adic sheaves ( usually the constant sheaf @xmath9 ) on these varieties .",
    "we denote the tale cohomology of a scheme @xmath1 over @xmath2 with @xmath9-coefficients simply by @xmath10 .",
    "readers not familiar with tale cohomology are encouraged to specialize to the case @xmath11 and understand @xmath10 as the singular cohomology of @xmath12 with @xmath13-coefficients .",
    "perverse sheaves will be used only in  [ ss : spr corr ] .",
    "i would like to thank the co - organizers , lecturers and the staff of the pcmi summer program in 2015 .",
    "i would also like to thank the audience of my lectures for their feedback .",
    "i am especially grateful to jingren chi who carefully read through the first draft of these notes and provided helpful suggestions .",
