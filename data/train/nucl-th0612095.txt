    "the investigation of the single - particle states in the odd - mass deformed nuclei of the @xmath0 mass region ( the heaviest nuclei for which detailed spectroscopic data are available ) shed additional light on the reliability of the predictions of rmf theory on the energies of spherical subshells responsible for magic numbers in superheavy nuclei .",

    "this is a result of the surface vibrations being less collective in deformed nuclei than in spherical ones since they are more fragmented @xcite . as a consequence ,",
    "the corrections to the energies of quasiparticle states in odd nuclei due to particle - vibration coupling are less state - dependent in deformed nuclei .",
    "a proper description of odd nuclei implies the loss of the time - reversal symmetry of the mean - field , which is broken by the unpaired nucleon .",
    "the bcs approximation has to be replaced by the hartree-(fock-)bogoliubov method , with time - odd mean fields taken into account .",
    "the breaking of time - reversal symmetry leads to the loss of the double degeneracy ( kramer s degeneracy ) of the quasiparticle states .",
    "this requires the use of the signature or simplex basis in numerical calculations , thus doubling the computing task .",
    "furthermore , the breaking of the time - reversal symmetry leads to nucleonic currents , which cause _ nuclear magnetism _",
    "the crhb(+ln ) theory @xcite takes all these effects into account .",

    "@xcite ) of the nucleons at the fermi surface @xmath13 . while the experimental density of the quasiparticle levels corresponds to @xmath13 close to one , the low effective mass @xmath14 of the rmf theory @xcite leads to a stretching of the energy scale .",
    "it has been demonstrated for spherical nuclei that the particle - vibration coupling brings the average level density in closer agreement with experiment @xcite .",

    "detailed analysis shows that the discrepancies between experiment and calculations can be traced back to energies of spherical subshells from which deformed states emerge .",

[ z120-sp ] in the present manuscript and fig .  28 in ref .",

    "[ diff - forces ] , one can see that the dd - me2 and dd - me1 parametrizations do not remove the problems of the description of proton @xmath21 state ( fig .",

    "@xcite for more detailed discussion of these states ) .",
    "the measured and calculated energies of the single - particle states at normal deformation provide constraints on the spherical shell gaps of superheavy nuclei .",
    "such analysis restricts the choice of the rmf parametrizations only to those which predict @xmath1 and @xmath2 as shell closures in superheavy nuclei @xcite . in general , since the accuracy of the description of the @xmath27 state is unknown , we can not also exclude the existence of the @xmath4 gap @xcite .",
    "similar analysis to ref .",
    "@xcite in non - relativistic models would restrict the choice of effective forces . however , it is already clear that the ski4 skyrme force which predicts @xmath19 shell gap can be ruled out since it provides poor description of the spin - orbit splittings @xcite .",
    "thus , one can conclude that non - relativistic theories suggest the existence of shell gaps ( not necessary doubly shell closures ) at @xmath28 and @xmath29 ( see ref .",
    "@xcite and references quoted therein ) .",
    "the role of self - consistency effects in the appearance of these shell gaps is discussed in the next section .",
    "self - consistent microscopic calculations find a central depression in the nuclear density distribution @xcite , which generates a wine - bottle nucleonic potential .",
    "the influence of this depression on the shell structure of spherical superheavy nuclei has been studied in ref .",
    "@xcite within the rmf theory without pairing .    the underlying microscopic mechanism for an appearance of this central density depression is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ dens - sys ] .",
    "the starting point of this consideration is the density distribution in @xmath30pb , which is nearly flat in central region of nucleus .",
    "its charge distribution is well described by the rmf theory @xcite .",
    "it is general feature of all nuclear structure models that on going from @xmath30pb to spherical superheavy nuclei in the region around @xmath1 and @xmath2 , the ground state configurations are built first by the occupation of the group of high-@xmath31 subshells ( neutron @xmath22 , @xmath32 , and @xmath33 and proton @xmath34 and @xmath35 ) and then by the occupation of the group of medium-@xmath31 subshells ( neutron @xmath33 and proton @xmath36 and @xmath37 ) , see fig .  [ dens - sys ] .",
    "the high-@xmath31 subshells are localized mostly near the surface , whereas the low-@xmath31 subshells have a more central localization . as a consequence of this grouping of high-@xmath31 and medium-@xmath31 subshells above @xmath30pb",

    ", the density distribution in the central part of nucleus is nearly flat in the latter system .",
    "the magic gaps of the wine - bottle ( the case of central depression in density distribution ) and flat - bottom ( the case of flat density distribution ) nucleonic potentials are different .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ spectra ] , where starting from the ground state configuration of @xmath25120@xmath45 nucleus , having a central depression ( configuration g - s ) , a flatter density distribution in the central part of nucleus is generated by exciting particles from high-@xmath31 subshells to low-@xmath31 subshells ( configuration exc - s ) @xcite . while wine - bottle potential ( conf .",
    "g - s ) is characterized by the large @xmath1 and @xmath2 large gaps , we see the appearance of the @xmath3 proton gap and the shrinking of the @xmath1 shell gap in the flat - bottom potential ( conf .",
    "exc - s ) . to a lesser extend ,",
    "the @xmath2 neutron gap decreases and the @xmath4 gap increases in the latter potential .     system obtained in the rmf calculations with the nl3 force .",

    "solid and open circles indicate the occupied and empty subshells , respectively . in the ground state ,",
    "all subshells below @xmath1 and @xmath4 are fully occupied . in the excited configuration ,",
    "only 12 particles are excited from the subshell @xmath23 : 4 particles still reside in this subshell .",
    "the spherical shell gaps of interest are indicated . from ref .",
    "@xcite ]    due to the isovector force , which tries to keep the neutron and proton density profiles alike , there is a mutual enhancement of the @xmath1 and @xmath2 gaps , both being favored by the wine - bottle potential , and of the @xmath3 and @xmath4 gaps , both favored by the flat bottom potential .",
    "for the same reason the gaps are smaller for the combination @xmath3 and @xmath2 , and the @xmath1 gap does not develop for the @xmath4 systems .",
    "this behavior is not expected to depend much on the density functional chosen ( see discussion in ref .",
    "@xcite ) .    considering that @xmath46 and @xmath8 are the particle numbers which appear as the candidates for magic particle numbers in self - consistent theories , it is clear that the magnitude of the central depression in density distribution is an important factor in defining magic shell gaps in spherical superheavy nuclei .",
    "this magnitude is correlated with effective mass @xmath47 of microscopic theory : more pronounced central depression develops for the density functionals with low effective mass @xcite .",
    "this feature may be understood as follows @xcite . in the surface region",
    ", @xmath47 changes from low value ( @xmath48 ) in the interior to 1 in the exterior .",
    "classically , nucleons with given kinetic energy are more likely to be found in regions with high effective mass than in the regions with low one because they travel with lower speed .",
    "this is reflected by the thomas - fermi expression for the nucleonic density @xmath49^{3/2}$ ] .",
    "the increase of the effective mass in the surface region favors the transfer of mass from the center there , which makes the above discussed polarization mechanism of the high-@xmath31 subshells more effective for functionals with low effective mass .",
    "all experimentally known nuclei with @xmath50 are expected to be deformed @xcite .",
    "the deformation leads to a more equal distribution of the single - particle states emerging from the high-@xmath31 and low-@xmath31 spherical subshells ( see , for example , the nilsson diagrams in figs .",
    "3 - 4 in ref .",
    "@xcite ) than for spherical shape .",
    "thus , the density profile of a deformed nucleus is relatively flat @xcite , strongly resembling the one of phenomenological potentials .",
    "in addition , the density profile variations as a function of particle number are less drastic than in spherical nuclei . these features together with the fact that the single - particle energies of the deformed nuclei in heavy actinide region have been carefully fitted in the phenomenological potentials explains the success of the shell correction method @xcite in the description of known superheavy nuclei . however , this method neglects the self - consistent rearrangement of single - particle levels due to the appearance of a central depression in spherical superheavy nuclei .",
    "thus the predictions of the magic numbers for superheavy nuclei within the shell correction method should be considered with caution .",
    "almost all published self - consistent calculations for superheavy nuclei performed either in an approximate hf+bcs or full hartree - fock - bogoliubov ( hfb ) frameworks show the collapse of pairing at large shell gaps in spherical superheavy nuclei ( see , for example , refs .",
    ". principal shortcoming of these calculations is the fact that neither the bcs nor the hfb wave functions are the eigenstates of particle number operator @xcite .",
    "the best way to deal with this problem would be to perform an exact particle number projection before the variation @xcite , but this is very time - consuming for realistic interactions . in this section",

    "unfortunately , there is no consensus on what value an effective mass should have in self - consistent theories ( see , for example , the discussion in refs .",
