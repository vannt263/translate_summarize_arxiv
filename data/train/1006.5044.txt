    "the distributions of income and wealth have long been found to possess some robust and stable features independent of the specific economic , social and political conditions of the economies . traditionally , the economists have preferred to model the left tail and the mode of the distributions of the workers incomes with a log - normal distribution and the heavier right tail with a pareto distribution . for a detailed survey of the distributions used to fit",
    "the income and wealth data see ref .",
    "however , there have been several studies recently that argue that the left tail and the mode of the distribution fit well with the gamma distribution and the right tail of the distribution follows a power law @xcite .",
    "it has been argued that this feature might be considered to be a natural law for economics @xcite .",
    "the chakraborti - chakrabarti @xcite model ( cc model henceforth ) can explain the gamma - like distribution very well whereas the chatterjee - chakrabarti - manna @xcite model ( ccm model henceforth ) explains the origin of the power law .",
    "both models fall in the category of the kinetic exchange models .",
    "however , the first model assumes a constant savings propensity and the second model assumes an uniformly distributed savings propensity of the agents .",
    "it may be noted that the distribution of the savings factor is exogenous in these models .",
    "it is not derived from any optimization on the agent s part or by some other mechanism .",
    "@xcite considers an exchange economy populated with agents having a particular type of utility function and derives the cc model in the settings of a competitive market . here",
    ", we show that the same methodology could be applied to derive the ccm model and we can explain the savings factor accordingly . a further possibility is also studied where the constancy of the savings propensity over time is relaxed . more specifically , we examine the cases where the savings propensity is dependent on the current money holding of the corresponding agent .",
    "this model , as we shall see , shows self - organization and in some cases , it gives rise to bimodality in the money distribution .",
    "it is well known the models of utility maximization has been severely critisized on the grounds of limitations of computational capability of human beings @xcite .",
    "hence , to model the savings behavior of the agents , we study some simple thumb - rules and derive the distributions of savings therefrom and finally the income / wealth distribution . in particular , we consider the savings propensity as a strategy variable to the agents .",
    "two cases are explored here . in the first case ,",
    "the agents take their savings decisions of their own by reinforcing their choices . in the second case ,",
    "the agents adopt the winning strategy . in all cases , we study the final money distributions .",
    "the plan of this paper is as follows . in section ,",
    "[ sec : cc - ccm ] we explain the savings behavior of the agents using arguments from neoclassical economics . in the next section , we study a self - organizing market where the savings is a function of the current money holding of the corresponding agent . in section [ sec : onetomany ] and [ sec : manytoone ] , we study the savings behavior of the agents where the savings decision follows some very simple thumb - rules . then follows a summary and discussion .",
    "by competitive market we mean a market with atomistic agents who trade with each other knowing that their individual actions can not possibly influence the market outcome ( that implies there is no _ strategic _ interaction between the agents ) .",
    "we assume that markets are always cleared by equating supply and demand ; that is the market is completely free of any friction .",
    "below , we elaborate on the market structure and the behavior of the agents more explicitly .",
    "this model considers homogenous agents characterized by a single savings propensity .",
    "we briefly review the derivation of the model following ref .",
    "the structure of the economy is the following .",
    "it is an exchange economy populated with @xmath0 agents each producing a single perishable commodity .",
    "there is complete specialization in production which means none of the agents produce the commodity produced by another .",
    "money is not produced in the economy .",
    "all agents are endowed with a certain amount of money at the very begining of all tradings .",
    "money can be treated as a non - perishable commodity which facilitates transactions .",
    "all commodities along with money can enter the utility function of any agent as arguments .",
    "these agents care for their future consumptions and hence they care about their savings in the current period as well .",
    "it is natural that with successive tradings their money - holding will change with time . at each time step ,",
    "two agents are chosen at random to carry out transactions among themselves competitively .",
    "we also assume that the preference structure of the agents are time - dependent that is the parameters of the utility functions vary over time ( ref .",
    "@xcite ) . for a detailed discussion on the derivation of the resulting money - transfer equations ,",
    "below , we provide the formal structure and the solution to the model only .",
    "let us assume that at time @xmath1 , agent @xmath2 and @xmath3 have been chosen .",
    "also , assume that agent @xmath2 produces @xmath4 amount of commodity @xmath2 only and agent @xmath3 produces @xmath5 amount of commodity @xmath3 only and the amounts of money in their possession at time @xmath1 are @xmath6 and @xmath7 respectively ( for simplicity , @xmath8 for @xmath9=1,2 ) .",
    "notice that the notion of complete specialization in production process provides the agents with a reason for trading with each other .",
    "naturally , at each time step there would be a net transfer of money from one agent to the other due to trade .",
    "our focus is on how the amounts money held by the agents change over time due to the repetition of such a trading process . for notational convenience ,",
    "we denote @xmath10 as @xmath11 and @xmath12 as @xmath13 ( for @xmath14 ) .",
    "utility functions are defined as follows . for agent @xmath2 , @xmath15 and for agent @xmath3 , @xmath16 where the arguments in both of the utility functions are consumption of the first ( i.e. , @xmath17 and @xmath18 ) and second good ( i.e. , @xmath19 and @xmath20 ) and amount of money in their possession respectively . for simplicity",
    ", we assume that the sum of the powers is normalized to @xmath21 i.e. , @xmath22 . let the commodity prices to be determined in the market be denoted by @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "now , we can define the budget constraints as follows .",
    "for agent @xmath2 the budget constraint is @xmath25 and similarly , for agent @xmath3 the constraint is @xmath26 . in this set - up , we get the market clearing price vector ( @xmath27 ) as @xmath28 for @xmath29 , @xmath30 .    by substituting the demand functions of @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 for @xmath29 , @xmath30 in the money demand functions",
    ", we get the most important equation of money exchange in this model .",
    "to get the final result , we substitute @xmath34 by @xmath35 to get the money evolution equations as @xmath36 where @xmath37 and @xmath38 ( for @xmath9= @xmath2 , @xmath3 ) .",
    "note that for a fixed value of @xmath39 , if @xmath40 is a random variable with uniform distribution over the domain @xmath41 $ ] , then @xmath35 is also uniformly distributed over the domain @xmath42 $ ] . for the limiting value of @xmath39 in the utility function ( i.e. , @xmath43 ) , we get the money transfer equation describing the random sharing of money without savings .    * interpretation of @xmath39 * : here , it is clearly shown that @xmath39 in the cc model is nothing but the power of money in the utility function of the agents and finally this turns out to be the fraction of money holding that remains unaffected by the trading action . however , in this form it can not be directly interpreted as the propensity to save .",
    "below , we try to derive @xmath39 from an utlity maximization problem while retaining the kinetic exchange structure and we show that in this slightly alternative formulation , @xmath39 is indeed the savings propensity as has been postulated .      as is clear from above , in the cc model the savings decision , the market clearence , the prices are all determined at the same instant .",
    "but the savings decision is usually made in separation .",
    "more specifically , we can model the savings decision and the market clearence distinctly .",
    "the ccm model takes into account the heterogeneity of the agents .",
    "in particular , it assumes that it is the savings propensity of the agents which differs from each other . to derive the same , we assume that the agents take decisions in two steps .",
    "first , they decide how much to save and in the second step , they go to the market with the rest of the money and take the trading decisions .    formally , we can analyze a typical agent s behavior at any time step @xmath1 in the following two steps .    1 .   each agent s problem is to make the decision regarding how much to save . for simplicity ,",
    "we assume that the utility function is of cobb - douglas type . briefly",
    ", at time @xmath1 the @xmath44th agent s problem is to maximize @xmath45 subject to @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the amount of money kept for future consumption , @xmath48 is the amount of money to be used for current consumption , @xmath49 is the amount of money holding at time @xmath1 and @xmath50 is the interest rate prevailing in the market which can be assumed to be zero in a conservative framework .",
    "this is a standard utility maximization problem and solving it by lagrange multiplier , we get the optimal allocation for the @xmath44th agent as @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "clearly , this decision is independent of what other agents are doing .",
    "so now the agents will go to the market with @xmath53 only .",
    "2 .   now that each agent has made the savings decision",
    ", they can engage in competitive trade with each other in the fashion descibed in subsection [ sub : cc ] with @xmath54 0 ( but @xmath55 ; it is a mathematical requirement ) .",
    "note that the amount of money used by the @xmath2-th agent is @xmath52 only .",
    "+ the resultant asset exchange equations are those given by the ccm model @xcite .",
    "* interpretation of @xmath57 * : first we recall the solution of the savings decision which is @xmath51 . note that it implies @xmath58    that is @xmath57 is nothing but the proportion of money kept for future usage to the current money holding and this is by definition the savings propensity .",
    "a distinct possibility is that the savings propensity is a function of money - holding itself . to examine that case ,",
    "we need @xmath39:[0,@xmath59)@xmath60[0,1 ] . however , there are two possibilities",
    ". the savings propensity can be an increasing or decreasing function of money - holding .",
    "the simplest forms that we may assume are the following .",
    "@xmath61 with @xmath62 @xmath631 : savings propensity is a decreasing function of money holding .",
    "the restriction on @xmath62 does not allow any agent to have savings propensity equals to 1 .",
    "the system shows self - organization and assumes a stable probability density function in the steady state ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : sav - exp - neg ] where , for purpose of illustration , @xmath62 has been kept constant at @xmath64 ) .",
    "it is seen numerically that as @xmath65 increases the distribution converges to an exponential density function . in the other extreme",
    ", it tends to the cc model with @xmath39 = @xmath62 . for moderate values of @xmath65 ,",
    "the distribution resembles gamma function . for other values of @xmath62",
    "also , the system behaves similarly . note that since @xmath62 is the maximum possible savings propensity , for a very low value of it , the system becomes indistinguishable from an exponential distribution .",
    "while it seems counter - intuitive that savings propensity falls with the money holding , this might in fact be possible since poorer people can not take any chance to gamble whereas richer people can .",
    "2 .   @xmath66 with @xmath67 1 : savings propensity is an increasing function of money holding . the economy again organizes itself and the distribution of money becomes stable over time . however , there is something more .",
    "it is seen numerically that bimodality may apper spontaneously in the density function of money .",
    "[ fig : sav - exp - pos ] . ref .",
    "@xcite discusses such bimodal distribution of wealth ( or money ) .",
    "there a mixture of the agents was used where two classes of agents were characterized by two different and widely separated ( but fixed ! ) savings propensities .",
    "such a segregated population gave rise to bimodal distributions .",
    "however , such segregations are exogenous since the @xmath39s are given from outside the system . here",
    ", however , we have a new model in which savings decision is completely endogenous and the economy organizes itself in such a way that it gives rise to a class of bimodal distributions .",
    "it may be noted that bimodality in the income / wealth distribution has actually been observed in many cases ( see e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "+ it is seen numerically that bimodality appears for @xmath68 and @xmath69 .",
    "another interesting feature of this model is that keeping @xmath62 constant as @xmath65 increases , the monomodal distribution breaks into a bimodal distribution which again becomes a monomodal distribution for even larger values of @xmath65 .",
    "for example , consider fig .",
    "[ fig : sav - exp - pos ] in which the maximum value of @xmath65 considered is 4 . but",
    "as @xmath65 increases further , the distribution again becomes monomodal .",
    "however , it should also be mentioned that if @xmath62 is too large ( for example , if @xmath70 0.97 ) , then the system produces some strange - looking bimodal distributions .",
    "the standard economic paradigm of market clearence via utility maximization has been criticised on the grounds of limitations of computational capability of human beings @xcite .",
    "the main challenge is to derive the homogeneity in savings behavior of the agents from a very simple thumb - rule such that the final distribution of income / wealth looks realistic .",
    "a few realistic components of decision - making are noted in ref .",
    "@xcite    1 .",
    "players develop prefernces for choices associated with better outcomes even though the association may be coincident , causally spurious , or superstitious .",
    "decisions are driven by the two simultaneous and distinct mechanisms of reward and punishment , which are known to operate ubiquitously in humans .",
    "3 .   satisficing or persisting in a strategy that yields a positive but not optimal outcome , is common and indicates a mechanism of reinforcement rather than optimization .",
    "of particular interest is item ( iii ) which goes directly against the derivations stated above ( see section [ sec : cc - ccm ] ) .",
    "to model the savings behavior of the agents , we now make the following assumptions .    1 .   the agents do not perform static optimization .",
    "2 .   there is reinforcement in their decision - making process .",
    "the agents look for better payoffs .",
    "but eventually each of them converges to a single and simple strategy or thumb rule .    to incorporate the three above - mentioned assumptions , we model the agents saving behavior by polya s urn process @xcite .",
    "the model is as follows .",
    "consider the @xmath44th agent .",
    "the choice is binary , he can take any of the two decisions , to consume @xmath71 or to save @xmath72 .",
    "his strategies ( @xmath48 and @xmath73 ) such that @xmath74 and @xmath75 . at each instant",
    ", he chooses the values for @xmath48 and @xmath73 .",
    "define @xmath76 ( @xmath77 ) as the number of times @xmath48 ( @xmath73 ) has been assigned a value of unity in @xmath1 time periods .",
    "the savings propensity at time @xmath1 ( that is @xmath78 ) is defined as the ratio of @xmath77 to @xmath79 .",
    "we can assume that initially @xmath80 and @xmath81 .",
    "the reinforcement mechanism is incorporated by assuming that the probability of choosing @xmath73 = 1 at any time @xmath82 , is simply @xmath78 . basically , it is the polya s urn model and the famous result that follows from it is the following ( ref .",
    "@xcite ) . _",
    "the random variable @xmath78 converge almost surely to a limit @xmath39 .",

    "we shall show that the agents with different savings propensities , can converge to a single value over time .",
    "to model this situation , we assume that the agents treat savings propensity as a strategy which evolves over time .",
    "a very simple rule of evolution is the following .",
    "the winner in any trade retains his strategy whereas the loser adopts the winner s strategy .",
    "note that by winning in a trading action , we simply imply that the agent who gets the lion s share in that particular trading is the winner . since it is a relative term , ( by refering to eqn.[eqn : ccm ] ) winning is determined by the value of the stochastic term @xmath35 . if @xmath91 , then the @xmath2-th agent wins ( in eqn .",
    "[ eqn : ccm ] ) else the @xmath3-th agent wins .",
    "note that the most important support of this type of strategy evolution comes from the third observation by flache and macy @xcite noted in section [ sec : irrational ] .",

    "[ eqn : ccm ] and then the loser adopts the winner s savings propensity .",
    "this process is repeated untill the sytem reaches a steady state _ in terms of savings propensities_. after the whole system becomes steady with the agents with a fixed saving propensity , the system is allowed to evolve further to reach a steady state in terms of money .",
    "let    @xmath96    as the total number of agents remains fixed over time ( recall that @xmath95 has been defined above as the number of agents with a particular savings propensity @xmath57 ) .",
    "the agents only shift from one savings propoensity to another over time .",
    "note that at each ( trading ) time point , the number of agents with a particular savings propensity rises or falls by unity with equal probability ( i.e. depending on whether @xmath91 or not ) or it remains unchanged if its agents are not selected to trade . to put it formally ,",
    "let us assume that the two agents selected two trade have savings propensities @xmath57 and @xmath97 respectively .",
    "then    @xmath98    @xmath99    @xmath100    hence , the number of agents with a particular savings propensity performs a random walk of unit step and also note that the walk is bounded below since @xmath101 for all @xmath2 and also above by eqn .",
