    "to explain the cosmic acceleration found by the observations of type ia supernovae ( sne ia ) in 1998 @xcite , we usually introduce an exotic energy component with negative pressure to the right hand side of einstein equation .",
    "this exotic energy component which consists about 72% of the total energy density in the universe is dubbed as dark energy .",
    "although the cosmological constant is the simplest candidate for dark energy and is consistent with current observations , other possibilities are also explored due to the many orders of magnitude discrepancy between the theoretical estimation and astronomical observations for the cosmological constant .",
    "currently we still have no idea about the nature of dark energy .",
    "in particular , the question whether dark energy is the cosmological constant remains unanswered .",
    "for a recent review of dark energy , please see ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "one way of studying the nature of dark energy is though the observational data .",
    "there are many model - independent studies on the nature of dark energy by using the observational data @xcite .",
    "in particular , one usually parameterizes the energy density or the equation of state parameter @xmath7 of dark energy .",
    "the most used parametrization is the chevallier - polarski - linder ( cpl ) parametrization @xcite with @xmath8 . because of the degeneracies among the parameters @xmath3 , @xmath2 and @xmath0 in the model ,",
    "complementary cosmological observations are needed to break the degeneracies .",
    "the measurement on the cosmic microwave background anisotropy , the baryon acoustic oscillation ( bao ) measurement and the sne ia observations provide complementary data .    on the other hand ,",
    "a minimally coupled scalar field @xmath9 was often invoked to model the quintessence @xcite , and the phantom @xcite . for a scalar field with a nearly flat potential , there exist approximate relations between the equation of state parameter @xmath10 and the energy density parameter @xmath11 @xcite . by using the generic relations",

    "furthermore , @xmath7 can be approximated by the cpl parametrization with @xmath0 expressed as a function of @xmath2 and @xmath13 , so the two - parameter parametrization was reduced to one - parameter parametrization @xcite .",
    "the cpl parametrization with analytical relations among the model parameters helps tighten the constraints on the model parameters .    in this paper , we derive two particular cpl models with @xmath0 proportional to @xmath1 , and study the effects of the degeneracy relations between @xmath0 and @xmath2 by using the following data : the three year supernova legacy survey ( snls3 ) sample of 472 sne ia data with systematic errors @xcite ; the bao measurements from the 6dfgs @xcite , the distribution of galaxies @xcite in the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) and the wigglez dark energy survey @xcite ; the seven - year wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap7 ) data @xcite ; and the hubble parameter @xmath14 data @xcite .",
