    "when carbon nanotubes were discovered more than ten years ago , they were generally looked at as elongated fullerenes.@xcite a tube was described as several carbon rings capped on both ends by half - spherical fullerene fragments . over the years this view changed .",
    "presently , carbon nanotubes are modeled as one - dimensional solids.@xcite a cylindrical unit cell is repeated infinitely along the nanotube axis.@xcite considering single - walled carbon nanotubes as systems with translational periodicity is appropriate for studying their physical properties , because nanotube aspect ratios range from @xmath1 ( refs . and ) .",
    "the caps  normally only present at one end of the tubes  have virtually no effect onto the properties of a tube .",
    "this is the reason why nanotube caps almost disappeared from the literature , after a number of studies on this subject in the earlier nanotube literature.@xcite    recently , however , the attention turned back to nanotube caps in efforts to understand the growth of carbon nanotubes .",
    "single - walled tubes nucleate on a catalyst particle and then normally grow by adding carbon atoms to the base ( root growth mechanism).@xcite miyauchi  _ _ et al.__@xcite pointed out the importance of caps when studying small - diameter tubes grown by chemical vapor deposition ( cvd ) .",
    "they argued that there must be a correlation between the apparent preference for some nanotube chiralities in their growth method and the structures of the nanotube caps at nucleation .",
    "we recently suggested that the caps of carbon nanotubes and their interaction with the catalyst will be the key for controlling the chirality of single - walled carbon nanotubes during growth.@xcite our guiding principle for chirality - selective growth was based on two fundamental concepts : ( i ) one cap can only grow into a unique carbon nanotube and ( ii ) the cap structure can be controlled by epitaxial growth on a metal surface .",
    "in this paper we study the correlation between nanotube caps and the tube that can be attached to it .",
    "we show that the matching nanotube structure is defined by placing six pentagons onto a hexagonal lattice .",
    "moving one of the pentagons creates different caps and hence different tubes in a rational way .",
    "moving one pentagon along the graphene @xmath2 direction changes the nanotube chirality @xmath3 to @xmath4 , moving it along @xmath5 creates the @xmath6 tube .",

    "one pair of adjacent pentagons requires an additional energy of 1.5ev .",

    "carbon caps resemble half - fullerenes .",
    "they are composed of six pentagons and a number hexagons.@xcite the six pentagons are necessary by euler s theorem of closed polyhedra to introduce the necessary gaussian curvature.@xcite there are three methods to represent carbon caps on a flat plane : flattening the cap onto a hexagonal lattice@xcite , unwrapping a half tube with the cap attached to it@xcite , and a network representation based on graph theory@xcite .",
    "we use the flattening method originally suggested by yoshida and osawa@xcite , see also astakhova  _ _ et al.__@xcite .",
    "we found that this method best highlights the pattern of six hexagons and its correlation to the nanotube chiral vector .",

    "the other tubes with only one cap fulfilling the isolated pentagon rule are ( 9,0 ) , ( 9,1 ) , ( 8,2 ) , and ( 6,5 ) ( diameters @xmath12 ) . tubes of these diameters are found , _",

    "this sets the limit for the tube diameters that can form by the standard growth method .",
    "interestingly , for the small - diameter cvd samples there is a marked decrease in the abundance of tubes when going from the isolated pentagon regime [ ( 6,5 ) , ( 8,3 ) , ( 9,1 ) ] to the diameters where only caps with adjacent pentagons exist [ ( 6,4 ) and ( 7,3 ) ] .",
    "we discuss the diameter distribution in these samples in sect .",
    "[ sec_abundance ] .",
    "brinkmann  _ _ et al.__@xcite calculated the number of caps for nanotube diameters up to 20 .",
    "similar numbers as reported by brinkmann and co - workers were obtained by astakhova  _ _ et al.__@xcite for the subset of caps obeying the isolated pentagon rule and tubes up to the ( 10,10 ) nanotube .",
    "with increasing diameter the number of possible caps grows very rapidly following a power - law for caps with two or more adjacent pentagons , see fig .",
    "[ number](a ) ( ref .  ) . in a first approximation one expects a @xmath13 dependence for the number of caps ( including adjacent pentagons ) by the following argument .",
    "the area of the hexagonal lattice where we can place the six pentagons as in fig .",
    "[ cap_55 ] grows as @xmath14 , because the cap hexagon is equal to the circumference of the tube . to specify the cap by the flattening method we select six out of @xmath15 elements ( @xmath16 integer ) .",
    "we show in sect .",
    "[ sec_one_cap ] that specifying the six pentagons fully determines the chirality of the nanotube .",
    "the number of distinct choices for six elements out of @xmath17 is given by the binomial coefficient @xmath18 .",
    "the highest power of this binomial is @xmath19 ; from this we obtain the @xmath13 dependence for the number of carbon caps . as can be seen from the fit in fig .",
    "[ number](a ) the number of caps is proportional to @xmath20 .",
    "there are three obvious reasons why the number of caps is smaller for a given @xmath21 than expected from our argument .",
    "first , the choice of the six pentagons is not independent . by placing the first pentagon",
    "we remove a 60@xmath8 cone from the hexagonal lattice , fig .",
    "[ cap_55](a ) .",
    "the remaining pentagons must not be placed in this area .",
    "this becomes more and more restrictive the more pentagons we specify .",
    "second , two apparently different sets of six pentagons out of @xmath17 enumerated elements can , in fact , correspond to the same geometrical pentagon pattern .",
    "the pattern might be rotated or moved with respect to the hexagonal lattice .",
    "for example , in fig .",
    "[ cap_55](a ) we can rotate the six pentagons by 60@xmath8 degree around the central pentagon ( the cones are rotated together with the pentagons ) .",
    "this is a different subset in the argument outlined above , but the two caps are identical .",
    "third , the cap area is not necessarily quadratic ; it can be rectangular as well [ examples are the ( 8,4 ) caps in fig .  [ different_cuts ] of sect .  [ sec_one_cap ] ] . then , the number of available hexagons is smaller than @xmath17 , which results in a smaller binomial coefficient and hence a smaller exponent for the number of caps over tube diameter .",
    "although we have several arguments why the exponent in fig .",
    "[ number](a ) is smaller than twelve , we can not explain why it is equal to @xmath22",
    ". it would be interesting to explain the exact dependence of the number of caps on tube diameter .    for caps fulfilling the isolated pentagon rule in fig .",
    "[ number](b ) the number of caps is smaller for small diameters than for general caps , but for @xmath23 we recover the power law behavior of fig .",
    "[ number](a).@xcite this is understandable , since for a large cap area ( large tube diameters ) the fraction of caps with adjacent pentagons becomes negligible . for a given nanotube diameter there are fewer caps for armchair and zigzag ( closed symbols ) tubes than for chiral tubes ( open ) .",
    "this is due to the higher symmetry of the achiral tubes , which reduces the choices of caps .",
    "although a given nanotube can have thousands of distinct caps , quite the opposite is true for the inverse problem .",
    "a given cap only fits onto one particular nanotube as we show in the following section .      as we showed in fig .",
    "[ cap_55](a ) and ( b ) a hexagon that includes all six pentagons on the graphene lattice ends up as a closed line around the nanotube circumference . giving the vector around the nanotube circumference , on the other hand , uniquely determines the microscopic structure of the tube ( diameter @xmath21 and chiral angle @xmath24 ) . as is well known an @xmath3 nanotube is obtained by rolling up a graphene sheet along the vector@xcite @xmath25 where @xmath2 and @xmath5 are the graphene lattice vectors .",
    "once the cap hexagon is defined as in fig .",
    "[ cap_55](a ) the edge of this cap fixes the nanotube structure that can be attached to it .    in fig .",
    "[ how_to ] we show the edge construction for a chiral nanotube . in this case",
    "the cap hexagon can not be closed by cutting the shaded areas .",
    "the steps [ dashed lines in fig .",
    "[ how_to](a ) ]",
    "correspond to going twice into the @xmath26 direction of graphene , see fig .",
    "[ how_to](b ) .",
    "the full ( red ) line representing the cap hexagon has a length of @xmath27 . adding the full and dashed lines we obtain a chiral vector @xmath28 , _ i.e. _ , the ( 9,2 ) nanotube as shown in fig .",
    "[ how_to](b ) .",
    "the cap construction by flattening the half sphere onto the graphene lattice involves three steps:@xcite ( i ) define the positions of the hexagons , ( ii ) define the directions of the @xmath29 cones to be cut and ( iii ) define the cap hexagon . which step fixes the nanotube structure ?",
    "the last step  drawing the cap hexagon  is completely arbitrarily and will not change the cap structure . increasing the size of the hexagon by moving the lines in fig .",
    "[ how_to](a ) away from the pentagons , will simply add a tube segment to the cap .",
    "it is also possible to `` rotate '' the hexagon , _",
    "i.e. _ , to change the orientation of the line connecting two pentagons by 60@xmath8 and correspondingly the remaining lines between the other pentagons .",
    "this changes the orientation of the full lines and the steps with respect to @xmath2 and @xmath5 .",
    "adding up the lines and steps one obtains the same chirality .    how abou step ( ii ) of the flattening method ?",
    "can we construct two distinct caps from a given arrangement of pentagons by cutting different segments of the graphene lattice ?",
    "the answer is no as is illustrated for the ( 8,4 ) nanotube in fig .",
    "[ different_cuts](a)-(d ) . cutting different segments of the graphene lattice [ fig .",
    "[ different_cuts](a ) and ( b ) ] results in the same chiral vector .",
    "the construction of the ( 8,4 ) cap in fig .",
    "[ different_cuts](a ) is equivalent to the construction of the ( 9,2 ) cap in fig .",
    "[ how_to](a ) .",
    "the full line has a length of 12@xmath2 and we have four steps along @xmath26 .",
    "this adds up to the ( 8,4 ) nanotube . in fig .",
    "[ different_cuts](b ) we rotated the shaded cones by 60@xmath8 degree . on first sight",
    "the cap looks remarkably different .",
    "the full lines have a length of @xmath30 ( we rotated the cap hexagon together with the shaded cones to keep the full lines parallel to @xmath2 ) .",
    "there are a total of 8 steps ; they are along @xmath31 .",
    "thus , fig .",
    "[ different_cuts](b ) shows a cap for the @xmath32 tube .",
    "this is symmetry equivalent to the ( 8,4 ) nanotube because the @xmath3 and the @xmath33 tube have the same microscopic structure.@xcite in fig .",
    "[ different_cuts](c ) we cut along the armchair instead of the zigzag direction .",
    "once more , we obtain a cap for the ( 8,4 ) nanotube as is shown by the chiral vector in fig .",
    "[ different_cuts](d ) .",
    "the chiral vector of a nanotube is fixed by placing six pentagons onto the graphene lattice , _ i.e. _ , the first step in the construction of the cap .",
    "this topological construction uniquely specifies the structure of the carbon cap and the tube that can be attached to it .",
    "this also determines the formation energy of the cap during nanotube nucleation and the nanotube that finally grows from the carbon nucleus .",
    "we now study how caps for different nanotube are constructed by changing the pentagon pattern .      to create different caps from a starting pentagon pattern we need to move one ( or more ) of the pentagons .",
    "we now show that this creates @xmath34 nanotubes in a rational manner . in fig .",
    "[ how_to](a ) the lines forming the cap hexagon ( full , red ) are parallel to the @xmath2 direction of what later becomes the rolled up graphene sheet . moving one pentagon along @xmath2 we increase the length of the cap hexagon by @xmath2 and introduce an additional @xmath26 step , fig .  [ move](a ) .",
    "thus , the resulting nanotube is given by @xmath35 .",
    "in our example this is the ( 9,3 ) nanotube . for the cap",
    "the @xmath2 direction is fixed with respect to the cap hexagon , not the graphene sheet . at every point of the lattice in fig .",
    "[ move](a ) @xmath2 is parallel to the line defining the cap hexagon . when the direction of the full line changes by 120@xmath8 @xmath2 changes as well",
    ". therefore , the displacement of a pentagon in the directions shown in fig .  [ move](b ) also creates caps for the ( 9,3 ) nanotube .",
    "these are six out of 364 patterns that match the ( 9,3 ) nanotube or five out of 33 if we impose the isolated pentagon rule.@xcite moving the pentagon along @xmath5 results in an additional @xmath26 step , but does not change the length of the hexagonal line .",
    "we thus obtain an @xmath36 cap .",
    "all other displacements can be described as the sum of @xmath2 and @xmath5 displacements .",
    "figure  [ pattern](a ) shows the caps we obtain starting from the ( 9,2 ) .",
    "the displacement of just one pentagon creates a large variety of chiral indices .",
    "some of the caps in fig .",
    "[ pattern](a ) are irregular . by this",
    "we mean that five pentagons are concentrated in one part of the hexagonal lattice , whereas the sixth pentagon is far away from the others .",
    "more regular caps can be constructed by displacing more than one pentagon .",
    "take , for example , the ( 12,2 ) nanotube in fig .",
    "[ pattern](a ) . to construct a regular cap for this tube",
    "we start from the ( 9,2 ) pattern in fig .",
    "[ how_to](a ) .",
    "we take the rightmost pentagon as the first pentagon [ the one we moved around in fig .",
    "[ pattern](a ) ] and then go counterclockwise through the six pentagons ii , iii , iv and so forth . moving one after the other yields the series @xmath37",
    "where the vectors above the arrows indicate the displacement ; the roman numerals count the hexagons .",
    "the resulting ( 12,2 ) cap consists of two columns of pentagons along the armchair direction of graphene .",
    "it looks similar to the ( 8,2 ) pattern in fig .",
    "[ pattern](a ) , but with more space between the armchair columns .    in fig .",
    "[ pattern](b ) and ( c ) we present the caps obtained starting from the ( 5,5 ) and ( 9,0 ) caps and displacing one pentagon .",
    "the high symmetry of the original pentagon patterns is reflected in the chiralities that result from the displacement of one pentagon .",
    "the patterns of five pentagons shown in fig .",
    "[ pattern](b ) and ( c ) in grey ( orange ) have mirror planes .",
    "we thus obtain pentagon patterns that are mirror images of each other when we move the remaining pentagon over the hexagonal lattice .",
    "these mirror images are ( identical ) caps for the same pair of chiral indices .",
    "to highlight this , we always brought the @xmath3 indices back into the standard @xmath38 graphene segment ( @xmath39 ) in fig .",
    "[ pattern](b ) and ( c ) . for example , the series ( 9,1 ) , ( 10,0 ) , ( 10,1 ) and ( 10,2 ) in fig .",
    "[ pattern](c ) is equivalent to ( 9,1 ) , ( 10,0 ) , ( 11,-1 ) , and ( 12,-2 ) , because the @xmath3 and @xmath33 tube are identical . for tubes close to the armchair direction we interchanged @xmath40 and @xmath41 in the left part of fig .",
    "[ pattern](b ) .",
    "this turns a left - handed tube into a right - handed tube ; otherwise the two tubes are identical .",
    "many chiral indices appear in more than one panel of fig .",
    "[ pattern ] .",
    "_ e.g. _ , the ( 8,4 ) and ( 9,4 ) tubes are present in ( a ) and ( b ) and all chiral indices of ( c ) can be found in ( a ) as well . some of the repeated indices correspond to the same pentagon pattern , _",
    "i.e. _ , the same cap , see the ( 10,1 ) caps in fig .",
    "[ pattern](a ) and ( c ) .",
    "most repeated indices , however , describe two distinct caps for one nanotube chirality . for example , the ( 10,0 ) cap in fig .",
    "[ pattern](c ) is very regular and obeys the isolated pentagon rule , whereas the ( 10,0 ) cap in ( a ) contains two adjacent pentagons .",
    "our original motivation for studying nanotube caps was to calculate the formation energies of the caps on catalytic particles.@xcite we found that the two important contributions for the total energy of a nanotube nucleus were the cap formation energy and the carbon - metal binding energy . here",

    "this drop happens exactly at the radius that separates semiconducting nanotubes into tubes with isolated pentagon caps [ ( 6,5 ) , ( 9,1 ) , ( 7,5 ) , and larger ] and tubes that only have caps with adjacent pentagons [ ( 6,4 ) , ( 7,3 ) , and smaller ] , see the chiral indices and the dashed line in fig .",
    "[ abundance ] .",
    "the thermal energy at nucleation was thus too small for the formation of adjacent pentagons , which cost 1.5ev per pair as we showed above .",
    "the formation energy of the tubes with smallest diameters increases further when taking into account the curvature energy of the tube in addition to the energy required for adjacent pentagons .",
    "the ( 6,4 ) cap , for example , contains 30 carbon atoms .",
    "an adjacent pentagon pair thus costs @xmath79mev per atom in the cap . the difference in strain energy between the ( 6,4 ) and the ( 6,5 ) nanotube is @xmath80mev / c ( ref .  ) .",
    "the total energy difference between a capped ( 6,4 ) and ( 6,5 ) nanotube ( neglecting the catalyst ) will thus decrease from @xmath81mev / c for the cap alone to 30mev / c for a long tube where the effect of the adjacent pentagon becomes negligible . from _ ab - initio _ calculations we found a difference in formation energy 100mev / c for the ( 6,4 ) and the ( 6,5 ) cap in good agreement with the estimate given above.@xcite it is , however , important to realize that the dependence of the strain energy on tube diameter will never explain , _",
    "e.g. _ , the low abundance of the ( 9,1 ) nanotube as compared to the ( 6,5 ) , see fig .",
    "[ abundance ] .",
    "these two tubes have exactly the same diameter .",
    "the formation of the nanotube nucleus  the cap on the metal particle  is a limiting step for the growth of a tube .    the line in fig .",
    "[ abundance ] is a guide to the eye .",
    "it is a gaussian with a mean diameter @xmath82 and @xmath83 .",
    "as can be seen , the abundance of tubes follows reasonably well a gaussian distribution for large diameters , but the tail towards small diameters is missing .",
    "in particular , there is a marked asymmetry between the very small or vanishing abundance below 7.2 and the comparatively broad distribution towards the large - diameter end in fig .",
    "[ abundance ] .",
    "the low - temperature cvd experiments confirm the importance of the cap structure and the cap formation energy for the distribution of nanotube chiralities in a sample.@xcite once a cap is formed , it determines the @xmath3 nanotube that grows from it .",
    "this is somewhat similar to the growth of tubes using other nanotubes as a seed.@xcite if the formation energy of a certain cap is larger than the energy available during nucleation , this prevents the growth of the tube corresponding to the cap .",
    "this holds even when the tube itself is otherwise favourable energetically .",
    "in this study we only considered the energy of the cap itself .",
    "the second important contribution to the formation energy during nucleation is the carbon - metal binding energy.@xcite this can , in particular , introduce energy differences between caps of similar diameter and hence similar cap formation energy ( curvature energy ) .",
    "the variations in the total carbon - metal binding energy ( @xmath84ev ) are similar to the energy required for adjacent pentagons ( 1.5ev )",
    ". the carbon - metal binding energy can thus be the origin of the preferential growth of certain chiralities , whereas the adjacent - pentagon energy prevents the growth of tubes with very small diameters .",
    "in summary , we studied the structure and energetics of nanotube caps .",
    "we showed that the arrangement of pentagons in the cap defines the chirality of the tube that matches to it .",
    "moving one ( or more ) pentagons across the hexagonal lattice creates caps for different nanotubes in a rational way .",
    "the isolated - pentagon caps for a ( 10,0 ) nanotube vary in formation energy by @xmath67ev or @xmath85mev / atom . introducing adjacent pentagons",
    "requires an energy of @xmath86ev per pentagon pair .",
    "the large formation energy for two adjacent pentagons explains why tubes with diameters below @xmath87 had a very small yield in low - temperature cvd growth .",
    "our study shows that the structures and energetics of carbon caps on a catalytic particle will be the key for chirality selective growth of single - walled carbon nanotubes .",
    "a nanotube cap on a catalytic particle is the nucleus of a tube and uniquely determines its chirality ."
