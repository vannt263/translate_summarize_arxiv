    "experimental studies of particles invisible decays , i.e. transitions to an experimentally unobservable final state , played an important role both in development of the standard model ( sm ) and in constraining its extensions @xcite .",
    "it is worth it to remember the determination of the number of lepton families in the sm through the precision measurements of the @xmath11 decay rate . in recent years , searches for",
    "invisible particle decays have received considerable attention .",
    "one could mention experiments looking for extra dimensions with invisible decay of positronium ( ps=@xmath12 bound state ) @xcite , baryonic number violation with nucleon disappearance at sno @xcite , borexino @xcite , and kamland @xcite , see also ref.@xcite , electric charge nonconserving electron decays @xmath13 @xcite , neutron - mirror neutron oscillations at psi @xcite and the ill reactor @xcite , neutron disappearance into another brane world @xcite , and motivated by various models of physics beyond the sm searches for invisible decays of @xmath14 mesons at e949 @xcite , @xmath15 and @xmath16 mesons at bes @xcite , heavy @xmath17 meson decays at belle @xcite , babar @xcite , bes @xcite and invisible decays of the upsilon(1s ) resonance at cleo @xcite .",
    "there are also proposals for new experiments to search for electric charge nonconservation in the muon decay @xmath18 @xcite , and mirror - type dark matter through the invisible decays of orthopositronium in vacuum @xcite .    in the standard model",
    "there are several canonical examples of pure leptonic processes involving the muon , the electron and the corresponding neutrinos which are connected by the crossing symmetry : i ) the decay of muon @xmath0 , ii ) the inverse muon decay @xmath1 , and iii ) the annihilation of a muon and an electron into two neutrinos , @xmath2 .",
    "although the first two reactions have been observed and measured since long ago , the third process , resulting in the invisible final state , has never been experimentally tested .",
    "it may go either directly , or , at low energies , via the annihilation of a muon and an electron from an atomic bound state , called muonium ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "muonium is a particularly interesting system for high precision tests of the sm and searches for new physics .",
    "many interesting experiments performed or planned with muonium were motivated by tests of bound state qed in measurements of the muonium hyperfine splitting @xcite and 1s-2s interval @xcite , searches for the lepton number violation in muonium to antimuonium conversion @xcite , tests of fundamental symmetries , such as cpt @xcite , probe of antimatter gravity in the free gravitational fall of muonium @xcite , and other areas of research @xcite .",
    "as far as the muonium invisible decay is concerned , there are several interesting motivations for the experiment searching for the decay @xmath7 to be performed .",
    "first , the decay is predicted to exist in the sm at the experimentally achievable today level .",
    "hence , the observation of the process @xmath19 for the first time would be an interesting test of the sm .",
    "second , the decay may occur in some low - mass dark matter scenarios , most of which require coupling between the sm and hidden sectors .",
    "for instance , we show that in the mirror matter model such coupling could significantly enhance the @xmath7 decay rate , thus making it very attractive for direct high sensitivity searches .",
    "if the @xmath7 decay is observed at a rate higher than the sm prediction , it would be a strong evidence for the existence of new physics beyond the sm .",
    "in this paper we obtain the first limit on the decay @xmath7 and show that it could be significantly improved in a new proposed high - statistics and low - background experiment .",
    "we also show that the expected level of the experimental sensitivity allows for the observation of this decay mode for the first time at a rate predicted by the sm .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we briefly review the standard model decay rate of muonium and phenomenology of the muonium to antimuonium conversion . in sec .",
    "iii the exact mirror model , the effect of oscillation of ordinary muonium to the mirror one , and its experimental consequences are discussed .",
    "the first limit of the branching fraction for the decay @xmath7 is obtained from available experimental data in sec .",
    "the experimental technique and the preliminary design of the experiment , detector components , simulations of the signal and background sources , as well as the expected sensitivity are discussed in detail in sec.v .",
    "section vi contains concluding remarks .",
    "the muonium atom consits of a positive muon and an electron , which are leptons from two different generations . to our current knowledge",
    "these are particles without any known internal structure .",
    "this makes muonium an ideal system for testing qed and fundamental symmetries in physics , and allows us to calculate muonium properties to very high accuracy within the framework of the bound state qed .",
    "for example , for the hyperfine structure the theoretical predictions and measurements agree substantially better than for hydrogen atoms @xcite .",
    "as discussed previuosly , muonium atom , similar to the lightest known exotic hydrogen - like atom positronium , is bounded by the electromagnetic ( e - m ) interaction .",
    "however , differently from positronium the muonium can not self - annihilate through the e - m interaction because it would violate the lepton number conservation .",
    "instead , the sm allows the self - annihilation of muonium into neutrino pair through the lepton number conserving weak interaction . at the current level of experimental and theoretical precision",
    "these are the only interactions present in the muonium system .    in the sm muonium",
    "is unstable mainly due to the decay of muon @xmath21 .",
    "its decay rate in vacuum coincides with those of the muon decay given by @xmath22 here @xmath23 is the fermi constant and @xmath24 are the proton and muon masses , respectively . in matter , muonium is typically formed in the singlet or triplet state , with the total angular momentum equal 0 or 1 , respectively .",
    "the sm predicts direct annihilation of the triplet muonium , @xmath25 bound state , into neutrino antineutrino pair @xmath26 with a very small decay rate .",
    "the corresponding branching fraction @xmath27 is calculated to be @xcite @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the fine - structure constant , and @xmath30 is the electron mass .",
    "this result was further confirmed in @xcite .",
    "the singlet muonium can not decay into two ( massless ) neutrinos , as it contradicts to momentum and angular momentum conservation simultaneously .",
    "very interesting feature of muonium is the possibility of conversion(or oscillation ) into its antiatom , i.e. the @xmath31 bound state @xcite .",
    "this reaction violates the conservation of lepton flavor numbers by two units ( @xmath32 ) that makes searches for the @xmath33 conversion especially interesting due to experimental observations of lepton flavor violation in neutrino oscillations .",
    "the existence of muonium to antimuonium conversion is predicted in different extensions of the sm . the simplest way to understand",
    "the phenomenology of @xmath33 conversion is the use of the effective four fermion interaction of the @xmath34 type @xcite , namely @xmath35 where @xmath36 is a coupling constant characterizing the strength of a new flavor violating interaction . in the absence of an external magnetic field",
    "the muonium and antimuonium have the same ground - state energy levels .",
    "flavor violating interaction ( 3 ) would cause a splitting of their energy levels by amount @xcite @xmath37 here @xmath38 is the principal quantum number of the muonium atom and @xmath39 is the bohr radius of the muonium .",
    "numerically , for the ground state of muonium @xmath40 @xmath41    the @xmath33 conversion is analogous to the @xmath42 mixing .",
    "if a muonium atom is formed at @xmath43 in vacuum , it could oscillate into an antimuoniumm atom .",
    "for a small @xmath44 value the probability of the oscillation is represented in the form @xcite @xmath45 here @xmath46 is the muon decay width .",
    "the total conversion probability after integration over time is equal to @xmath47 the best current experimental limit on the @xmath20 conversion leads to bound @xmath48 @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that in the presence of external electromagnetic fields or collisions with residual gas molecules the @xmath33 transitions become suppressed .",
    "the idea that along with the ordinary matter may exist its exact mirror copy is an old one @xcite . this new hidden gauge sector is predicted to exist if parity is the unbroken symmetry of nature , for an excellent review see ref .",
    "@xcite . in accordance with this idea each ordinary particle of the sm has a corresponding mirror partner of exactly the same mass as the ordinary one . in the modern language of gauge theories , the mirror particles are all singlets under the standard @xmath49 gauge interactions @xcite .",
    "hence , they couple to the ordinary particles either by gravity or by other very weak forces . in this model",
    "the parity is conserved because the mirror particles have the right - handed ( v+a ) mirror weak interactions while the ordinary particles experience the usual left - handed weak interactions .",
    "mirror matter is dark in terms of the sm interactions , and could be a good candidate for dark matter , see , e.g. , refs.@xcite .",
    "for instance , it is argued that annual modulations of the signal observed by the dama collaboration are caused by the mirror dark matter scattering in their detector @xcite .",
    "the gauge group of our world and mirror world is assumed to be @xcite @xmath50 where the sm gauge group @xmath51 coincides with the mirror world gauge group @xmath52 .",
    "the interaction between our and mirror sectors could be transmitted by some gauge singlet particles interacting with both sectors .",
    "such kind of interaction could explain the baryon asymmetry of the universe @xcite , some fraction of dark matter in the universe @xcite , and can also results in the particle mixing and oscillation between the ordinary and mirror sectors .",
    "any neutral , elementary or composite particle , in principle , can have mixing with its mirror duplicate , such as photon - mirror photon @xcite , neutrino - mirror neutrino @xcite , etc . which can be experimentally tested .",
    "for example , the neutron - mirror neutron mixing via a small mass term @xmath53 proposed in @xcite , results in ordinary neutron anomalous disappearance , in addition to their decays or absorption due to sm interactions . at present , there are performed and proposed searches for mirror matter via the invisible decay of orthopositronium in vacuum @xcite , through neutron - mirror neutron oscillations @xcite , and via higgs- mirror higgs mixing at lhc @xcite .    as mentioned previously , in a mirror world model",
    ", there must exist the mirror muonium which is the bound state of a mirror muon @xmath54 and a mirror positron @xmath55 with the same mass and decay width as the ordinary muonium .",
    "we could assume the existence of a ( super)weak interaction invariant under the gauge group @xmath56 , which allows transitions between the ordinary and mirror muonium .",
    "such effective interaction can be written in a form analogous to @xmath57 where @xmath58 is a coupling constant characterizing the strength of the @xmath59 transition , and @xmath60 and @xmath61 are the mirror electron and muon fields , correspondingly .",
    "the interaction leads to conversion of ordinary muonium to mirror muonium , as schematically illustrated in fig .",
    "[ muoni ] .",
    "the double degeneracy between mass eigenstates of ordinary ( @xmath62 ) and mirror ( @xmath63 ) muonium is broken when a small mixing is included.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    the interaction breaks the degeneracy between @xmath62 and @xmath63 states , so that the vacuum energy eigenstates are @xmath64 and @xmath65 , which are split in energy by @xmath66 given by an expression similar to , see fig.[muoni ] .",
    "the interaction eigenstates are maximal combinations of mass eigenstates which implies that @xmath62 oscillates into @xmath63 .",
    "thus , a system which is pure muonium at @xmath67 will develop an admixture of mirror muonium at a later time .",
    "in closed analogy with the case of muonium antimuoniumm conversion one can find that the probability of seeing the system in vacuum decay as mirror muonium @xmath68 rather than as ordinary muonium @xmath69 is given by @xmath70 where @xmath71 , or @xmath72 ev , and @xmath73 is any additional splitting of @xmath62 and @xmath63 , by external electromagnetic fields .",
    "a detailed discussions of the effects of collisions and external fields on oscillation probability of a similar system , positronium , can be found in ref.@xcite .",
    "estimating @xmath74 by using ( 9 ) results in the integral probability of muonium to mirror muonium conversion determined by ( for @xmath75 ) @xmath76 because mirror muonium decays into a mirror electron , positron , and neutrinos the experimental signature of the @xmath59 conversion is the invisible decay @xmath7 of the ordinary muonium in vacuum .",
    "current bounds on coupling constant @xmath58 are rather weak .",
    "for @xmath77 the branching fraction of the ordinary muonium decay into invisible mirror state is @xmath78 , which is seven orders of magnitude higher than those predicted by the sm branching fraction of eq.(2 ) .",
    "thus , we see that in the mirror model it is possible to have nonzero conversion of our muonium to mirror muonium .",
    "the signature of such conversion is the decay @xmath7 and , moreover , it is possible to expect some enhancement of this decay rate . similar to the @xmath79 conversion , the probability @xmath80 can be affected by an additional splitting of @xmath62 and @xmath63 states due to an external electric or magnetic field @xcite .",
    "it might also be suppressed , if there is a high collision rate of muonium atoms with the cavity walls or residual gas molecules in the experiment .",
    "note that some extensions of the sm allow the @xmath7 decay .",
    "for instance , in the model with the additional sterile neutrino , interaction @xmath81 results in invisible muonium decays into sterile neutrino @xmath82 .",
    "however , constraints obtained from the agreement between the measured and predicted properties of the @xmath83 decay @xcite lead to a strong bound @xmath84 on sterile neutrino decay width , which makes it not very exciting for further consideration .",
    "consider now bound on the invisible decay of the @xmath62 state , which can be obtained from existing experimental data .",
    "if an exotic @xmath7 decay exists , it would contribute to the total muonium decay rate : @xmath85 and , hence decrease the determined muonium lifetime @xmath86 .    in order to estimate the allowed extra contribution of @xmath87 to eq.([rate ] ) , and to obtain the limit on the branching fraction @xmath8 , we use the results on precision measurements of the positive muon lifetime reported by the mulan collaboration @xcite . in these measurements",
    "two different targets were used in the detector to stop muons . for the first one , the magnetized ferromagnetic alloy target ( ak-3 ) ,",
    "the dominant population was stopped @xmath88 s , and the corresponding muon decay lifetime was measured to be @xcite @xmath89 for the second one , the quartz ( sio@xmath90 ) target , the dominant species were muonium atoms formed by stopping muons 90% of the time , and the muon lifetime was found to be @xcite @xmath91 it is important to note , that in the framework of the sm the possible lifetime difference between the muonium atom in the quartz target and free muon in vacuum was estimated to be negligible , of the order of 1 part per billion @xcite . by comparing the measured muonium decay rates from eq.([tauak ] ) and eq.([tauq ] ) , and assuming that the fraction of triplet muonium state in the quartz target is 3/4 , one finds that the upper limit on the branching fraction of the decay @xmath7 is @xmath92 at the 90 % c.l .. there are still six orders of magnitudes difference between the limit of eq.([muon ] ) and the sm prediction ( 2 ) .",
    "note that the obtained result can not be used to constrain @xmath59 oscillations in vacuum because of their high collisional suppression in the quartz target .",
    "in the next section we show how the limit of eq.([muon ] ) can be significantly improved in the new proposed experiment .",
    "the decays @xmath7 are rare events and their observation presents a challenge for the detector design and performance . here",
    ", we focus mainly on discussions of the experimental setup to search for the decay @xmath7 in vacuum , which is also sensitive to the muonium - mirror muonium conversion .",
    "the similar setup without vacuum requirements is simpler , it would provide better sensitivity and can be used for the first observation of the decay @xmath7 and search for new exotic channels of this decay mode which are not affected by the presence of matter of external fields .",

    "the part of the spectrum above @xmath173 1 mev is calculated from the michel spectrum convoluted with the ecal ( gaussian ) energy resolution .",
    "the peak around @xmath123 mev is from the fraction of decay positrons ( @xmath169 ) with energy below of a few mev that are stopped in the cavity , i.e. either in the target or in the cavity walls , and annihilate into 2 or 3 photons .",
    "the low energy tail below 1 mev is described by a function @xmath174 , which is a sum of two distributions of the annihilation energy in the ecal normalized to the same number of positrons annihilated in the cavity .",
    "the function @xmath175 is an experimentally measured distribution taken from the experiment on @xmath176 @xcite for positrons annihilated in the sio@xmath90 target , which did not take into account the annihilation photon absorption in the cavity walls .",
    "the function @xmath177 is taken from the proposal @xcite and corresponds to the simulated energy deposition in the ecal minus energy absorbed in the cavity walls .",

    "the first one is related to the relatively long muon lifetime and the corresponding ecal signal integration time . indeed , to get the branching ratio @xmath191 , the ecal gate duration @xmath192 , and hence the dead - time per trigger , has to be @xmath193 in order to avoid background from the muon decays outside the gate .",
    "the best sensitivity is expected at integration gate @xmath194s ; however , further , more complicated analysis compromising the level of this background and increasing of the pileup noise might be necessary .",
    "the pileup energy , which corresponds to energy deposited in the bgo ecal by an additional undetected and uncorrelated particle , increases values of the ecal pedestals .",
    "the amount of additional energy in each bgo counter can be measured with the random trigger @xcite . in the ps experiment @xcite , for orthopositronium lifetime in the sio@xmath90 aerogel target of 132",
    "ns the ecal gate duration @xmath195 was chosen to be @xmath196 .",
    "this resulted in distribution of the sum of pedestals of all ecal counters corresponding to the efficiency of  zero  signal detection as a function of the energy threshold . in order to keep the energy threshold as low as possible an algorithm to sum up the energy of all the ecal crystals",
    "can be employed by exploiting the granularity of the calorimeter and fixing a zero energy threshold for each individual crystal .",
    "taking into account the ecal granularity , the effective ecal energy threshold can be significantly reduced from 80 kev , used to define the signal range for the @xmath197 decay @xcite , to about 20 kev having the overall signal efficiency above 95% @xcite . in the proposed experiment",
    "the longer gate will lead to an increase of the pileup and pick - up electronic noise and hence to the overall broadening of the signal range , approximately by a factor @xmath198 and , hence to an increase of the effective energy threshold roughly up to @xmath199 kev@xmath200 kev .",
    "another limitation factor is related to the dead time of eq.([dur ] ) and , hence to the maximally allowed muon counting rate , which according to eq.([dur ] ) has to be @xmath201 to avoid significant pileup effect . to minimize dead time ,",
    "one could impose a time structure on the continuous beam by using a fast beam chopper operating in a `` muon on request '' mode @xcite , and a first - level trigger rejecting events with the ecal energy deposition greater than @xmath127 and , hence , run the experiment at the rate @xmath202 . assuming this rate , we anticipate @xmath117 @xmath88 on target and production of about @xmath203 muonium atoms during 6 months of running time for the experiment .",
    "out of them , about @xmath204 @xmath62 s decay in the target , while about @xmath205 @xmath62 s leave the target surface and decay in vacuum . for counting signal rate of @xmath206 per incident muon . assuming beam intensity of @xmath207/s at @xmath208 efficiency",
    ", it would require 1 week to accumulate one signal event .",
    "in the background free experiment one could expect a sensitivity in the @xmath209 decay branching ratio of the order of @xmath210 assuming that in eq.([br ] ) @xmath211 . for @xmath62 s that decay in vacuum ,",
    "the sensitivity is @xmath212 in the presence of background and in accordance with the sm prediction , the expected number of observed events in the signal region @xmath213 kev is @xmath214 out of which 18.4 events represent conservatively estimated overall background from table 1 . taking into account , one can see that the observation of the @xmath7 decay with about 5 @xmath215 significance could be possible .",
    "the statistical limit on the sensitivity of the proposed experiment to search for the decay @xmath7 due to transition into the hidden sector is proportional to @xmath216 and is set by its value , see .",
    "thus , to improve the sensitivity of larger amount of muonium atoms decaying in vacuum is required . therefore , the improvement of the efficiency for thermal @xmath63s production is crucial for further searches .",
    "note , that in the case of the signal observation , to cross - check the result , one could replace the target with another one of the same density , but not capable of muonium producing , and run the experiment with suppressed @xmath62 decays , see e.g. , ref.@xcite . in this case",
    "the distribution of the energy deposition in the ecal , shown in fig.[spect ] would contain mainly events from the decays @xmath110 and the signal from the decays @xmath7 should disappear . in the case of observation of a higher than predicted @xmath7 decay rate ,",
    "there is another important cross - check .",
    "namely , as discussed in sec . 3 , one could slightly modify the experimental conditions without affecting the background , e.g. by increasing either the magnetic field in the cavity or the number of muonium collisions with residual gas molecules by increasing the gas pressure @xcite .",
    "these would suppress the muonium - mirror muonium oscillations , and the observed signal should vanish .",
    "the performed analysis gives an illustrative correct order of magnitude for the sensitivity of the proposed experiment .",
    "the simulations are performed without taking into account such effects as , e.g. pileup , and may be strengthened by more accurate and detailed monte carlo simulations of the concrete experimental setup .",
    "due to its specific properties , muonium is an important and interesting probe of the sm and physics beyond the sm both from the theoretical and experimental view points . in the sm",
    ", the invisible decay @xmath4 of muonium atoms into two neutrinos is expected to be a very rare process with the branching fraction predicted to be @xmath217 with respect to the ordinary muon decay rate .",
    "this process has never been experimentally tested . using the reported experimental results on precision measurements of the positive muon lifetime by the mulan collaboration",
    ", we set the first limit @xmath6 , while still leaving a big gap of about six orders of magnitude between this bound and the predictions .    to improve substantially the sensitivity",
    ", we proposed to perform an experiment dedicated to the search for the @xmath7 decay .",
    "the key point for the experiment is the presence of energy release from the annihilation of the low energy decay positrons in the detector .",
    "a feasibility study of the experimental setup shows that the sensitivity of the search for this decay mode in branching fraction @xmath218 at the level of @xmath9 could be achieved .",
    "thus , the sm prediction for the @xmath93 decay to exist at the level of @xmath219 , could be experimentally tested for the first time .",
    "we point out that the @xmath7 decay rate could be enhanced by non - sm contributions .",
    "for instance , in the framework of the mirror matter model if the coupling strength between @xmath62 and @xmath63 is large enough , say @xmath220 , the decay @xmath7 could occur at a rate as high as the sm one .",
    "if the proposed search results in a substantially higher branching fraction than the sm predictions , say @xmath10 , this would unambiguously indicate the presence of new physics . a result in agreement with the sm prediction",
    "would provide a theoretically clean check of the pure leptonic bound state annihilation through charged current weak interactions , and provide constraints for further attempts beyond the sm .",
    "the preliminary analysis shows that the quoted sensitivity could be obtained with a detector optimized for several of its properties .",
    "namely , i ) the primary beam and the entrance aperture size , ii ) the efficiency of the muonium production in the target and in vacuum , iii ) the material composition and dimensions of the target and vacuum cavity , iv ) the efficiency of the veto counters s@xmath121 , and v ) the pileup effect and zero - energy threshold in the ecal are of importance .",
    "we believe our proposal , when paired with an existing bgo calorimeter , provides interesting motivations for the experiment on the search for the @xmath7 decay to be performed in the near future . this low - energy experiment might be a sensitive probe of new physics that is complementary to collider experiments .",
    "for example , it could also significantly improve the recently obtained modest bounds on the @xmath221 decay @xcite , pushing it down to the region @xmath222 .",
    "a bound in this region will be of interest for several extensions of the standard model , see e.g. , ref .",
    "the required high numbers of muonium atoms can be presently produced at psi @xcite , or could be available from high intensity muon beams at future facilities such as the prism source at j - parc @xcite , the project x at fnal @xcite , or the neutrino factory @xcite . + * acknowledgments *    we thank p. crivelli , d. gorbunov , f. guber , a. ivashkin , a. rubbia , v. samoylenko and d. sillou for discussions . the help of d. sillou and a. korneev in calculations is gratefully acknowledged .",
