    "classification problem is one of the most important tasks in time series data mining . a well - known 1-nearest neighbor ( 1-nn ) with dynamic time warping ( dtw )",
    "distance is one of the best classifier to classify time series data , among other approaches , such as support vector machine ( svm ) @xcite , artificial neural network ( ann ) @xcite , and decision tree @xcite .    for the 1-nn classification ,",
    "selecting an appropriate distance measure is very crucial ; however , the selection criteria still depends largely on the nature of data itself , especially in time series data .",
    "though the euclidean distance is commonly used to measure the dissimilarity between two time series , it has been shown that dtw distance is more appropriate and produces more accurate results .",
    "sakoe - chiba band ( s - c band ) @xcite originally speeds up the dtw calculation and later has been introduced to be used as a dtw global constraint .",
    "in addition , the s - c band was first implemented for the speech community , and the width of the global constraint was fixed to be 10% of time series length .",
    "however , recent work @xcite reveals that the classification accuracy depends solely on this global constraint ; the size of the constraint depends on the properties of the data at hands . to determine a suitable size , all possible widths of the global constraint",
    "are tested , and the band with the maximum training accuracy is selected .    ratanamahatana - keogh band ( r - k band ) @xcite has been introduced to generalize the global constraint model represented by a one - dimensional array .",
    "the size of the array and the maximum constraint value is limited to the length of the time series .",
    "and the main feature of the r - k band is the multi bands , where each band is representing each class of data . unlike the single s - c band",
    ", this multi r - k bands can be adjusted as needed according to its own class warping path .",
    "although the r - k band allows great flexibility to adjust the global constraint , a learning algorithm is needed to discover the best multi r - k bands . in the original work of r - k band ,",
    "a hill climbing search algorithm with two heuristic functions ( accuracy and distance metrics ) is proposed .",
    "the search algorithm climbs though a space by trying to increase / decrease specific parts of the bands until terminal conditions are met .",
    "however , this learning algorithm still suffers from an overfitting phenomenon since an accuracy metric is used as a heuristic function to guide the search .    to solve this problem ,",
    "we propose two new learning algorithms , i.e. , band boundary extraction and iterative learning .",
    "the band boundary extraction method first obtains a maximum , mean , and mode of the paths positions on the dtw distance matrix , and the iterative learning , band s structures are adjusted in each round of the iteration to a silhouette index @xcite .",
    "we run both algorithms and the band that gives better results . in prediction step ,",
    "the 1-nn using dynamic time warping distance with this discovered band is used to classify unlabeled data .",
    "note that a lower bound , lb_keogh @xcite , is also used to speed up our 1-nn classification .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section 2 gives some important background for our proposed work . in section 3 ,",
    "we introduce our approach , the two novel learning algorithms .",
    "section 4 contains an experimental evaluation including some examples of each dataset .",
    "finally , we conclude this paper in section 5 .",
    "our novel learning algorithms are based on four major fundamental concepts , i.e. , dynamic time warping ( dtw ) distance , sakoe - chiba band ( s - c band ) , ratanamahatana - keogh band ( r - k band ) , and silhouette index , which are briefly described in the following sections .",
    "dynamic time warping ( dtw ) @xcite distance is a well - known similarity measure based on shape .",
    "it uses a dynamic programming technique to find all possible warping paths , and selects the one with the minimum distance between two time series . to calculate the distance",
    ", it first creates a distance matrix , where each element in the matrix is a cumulative distance of the minimum of three surrounding neighbors .",
    "suppose we have two time series , a sequence @xmath0 of length @xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) and a sequence @xmath3 of length @xmath4 ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "first , we create an @xmath1-by-@xmath4 matrix , where every ( @xmath6 ) element of the matrix is the cumulative distance of the distance at ( @xmath6 ) and the minimum of three neighboring elements , where @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "we can define the ( @xmath6 ) element , @xmath9 , of the matrix as :    @xmath10    where @xmath11 is the squared distance of @xmath12 and @xmath13 , and @xmath9 is the summation of @xmath14 and the the minimum cumulative distance of three elements surrounding the ( @xmath6 ) element .",
    "then , to find an optimal path , we choose the path that yields a minimum cumulative distance at ( @xmath15 ) , which is defined as :    @xmath16    where @xmath17 is a set of all possible warping paths , @xmath18 is ( @xmath6 ) at @xmath19 element of a warping path , and @xmath20 is the length of the warping path .    in reality , dtw may not give the best mapping according to our need because it will try its best to find the minimum distance .",
    "it may generate the unwanted path .",
    "for example , in figure [ flo : dtw1 ] @xcite , without global constraint , dtw will find its optimal mapping between the two time series .",
    "however , in many cases , this is probably not what we intend , when the two time series are expected to be of different classes .",
    "we can resolve this problem by limiting the permissible warping paths using a global constraint .",
    "two well - known global constraints , sakoe - chiba band and itakura parallelogram @xcite , and a recent representation , ratanamahatana - keogh band ( r - k band ) , have been proposed , figure [ flo : dtw2 ] @xcite shows an example for each type of the constraints .    [",

    "in this work , we propose a new efficient time series classification algorithm based on 1-nearest neighbor classification using the dynamic time warping distance with multi r - k bands as a global constraint .",
    "to select the best r - k band , we use our two proposed learning algorithms , i.e. , band boundary extraction algorithm and iterative learning .",
    "silhouette index is used as a heuristic function for selecting the band that yields the best prediction accuracy .",
