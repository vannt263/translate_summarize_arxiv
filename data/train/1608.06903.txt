    "in reliability optimization and life testing experiments , many times the tests are censored or truncated when failure of a device during the warranty period may not be counted or items may be replaced after a certain time under a replacement policy . moreover ,",

    "this distribution with a simple expression and nice reliability properties , is derived from the generalized lindley distribution as proposed by zakerzadeh and dolati  @xcite , which is again a generalization of the lindley distribution as proposed by lindley  @xcite . the ll distribution exhibits bath - tub failure rates and has increasing generalized failure rate ( igfr ) .",

    "although stochastic comparisons of order statistics from homogeneous populations have been studied in detail in the literature , not much work is available so far for the same from heterogeneous populations , due to its complicated nature of expressions .",
