    "astrophysical observations , such as the mass and the radius of dense stars , may in turn also impose constraints on the equation of state of deconfined quark matter .    we will focus on static spherically symmetric stars which are described by the tolman - oppenheimer - volkov equations . at low densities , up to a few times nuclear density @xmath0 , matter consists of interacting hadrons .",
    "theoretical models for this state have to start from various assumptions , as for the included states and their interactions . naturally , the results for the hadronic equation of state become notably model dependent at densities exceeding approximately @xmath1 .",
    "this is reflected in uncertainties of the predictions for the shell structure of neutron stars , cf .",
    "@xcite . at some higher energy density ,",
    "hadronic matter undergoes a phase transition or a crossover to a quark - gluon plasma ( at high temperatures ) , or a color - superconducting state ( at low temperatures ) .",
    "then the system can be described directly in terms of the fundamental degrees of freedom  quarks and gluons .",
    "notwithstanding , the coupling strength is still large in the regime of physical interest , and perturbative qcd is not reliable or , at least , the calculations have to be interpreted very carefully .",
    "calculations based on various effective theories , on the other hand , rest again on assumptions which seem hard to control a priori .",
    "non - perturbative results have been obtained from first principles by lattice qcd computations at zero chemical potential and temperatures up to a few times the transition temperature @xmath2 . at low temperatures and for non - zero chemical potential @xmath3 , as relevant for dense stars ,",
    "monte - carlo calculations are , however , hampered by the sign problem .",
    "several approaches to cope with it have been proposed only recently .",
    "the available results still have rather large uncertainties , and they do not yet cover the range of temperatures and chemical potential required in the present context .",
    "this makes worthwhile an approach which extrapolates , with as few assumptions as possible , lattice qcd data from zero chemical potential to @xmath4 . in the following",
    "we will outline a thermodynamical quasiparticle model , which can be derived in a series of approximations .",
    "for the sake of simplicity we consider , for the moment being , a macroscopic system described by a scalar field theory .",

    "the truncation of a resummation scheme based on 2-point functions is delicate because of gauge invariance .",

    "the predictive power of the approach becomes obvious by noting that the dependance of the coupling on @xmath41 and @xmath3 is completely governed by the requirement of thermodynamic consistency @xcite : maxwell s relation , @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the particle density , implies @xmath44 while nonlinear in @xmath45 ( the coefficients @xmath46 and @xmath47 are lengthy integral expressions ) , the partial differential equation is linear in the derivatives .",

    "a similar observation was made in the htl quasiparticle approach @xcite .",
    "the characteristic line emanating from @xmath2 is naturally related to the critical line @xmath55 enclosing the hadronic phase .",
    "the comparison , in figure [ fig : char ] , of our result for the curvature of the critical line at @xmath56 , which can be calculated in lattice qcd @xcite , is a nontrivial and successful test of the extension of the quasiparticle approach to @xmath4 .",
    "the quark number susceptibility @xmath57 is another quantity which has been computed on the lattice . as a second derivative of the pressure",

    "[ fig : chi_eqp ] ]    -3 mm    finally , as a direct confirmation of our mapping procedure , the quasiparticle model can also successfully describe the available lattice data for @xmath58 with @xmath59 flavors @xcite .",
    "it should be noted , however , that these direct calculations are so far restricted to small lattice sizes , resulting in still rather large uncertainties . with these supporting arguments",
    "we consider our results from the extrapolation of the lattice data at @xmath56 ( with controllable small uncertainties ) as a realistic estimate for the equation of state at not too small temperatures .    at low temperatures",
    ", matter will undergo a transition to a color - superconducting state , with a different quasiparticle structure than presumed in our quasiparticle approach .",
    "nonetheless , pairing affects the thermodynamic bulk properties only at the relative order of @xmath60 , where the estimated gap @xmath61mev is comfortably smaller than the chemical potential .",
    "therefore , our equation of state is a reasonable approximation even at small temperatures ( maybe except for the pressure where it becomes very small ) .",
    "relevant for the following discussion is the equation of state in the form @xmath62 , at @xmath63 .",
    "although both the pressure and the energy density    deviate sizably from their ideal values , cf .",

    ", at small temperatures .",
    "[ fig : e(p ) ] ]    the same linear form , with @xmath65 , follows in the familiar mit - bag approach where @xmath66 ( @xmath67 is @xmath3 or @xmath41 , and @xmath68 is some constant ) .",
    "although this parameterization of the pressure is clearly in contradiction with the thermodynamic lattice results , the bag model relation for @xmath62 serves as a standard to compare our results with .",
    "we note in passing that a linear relation between @xmath69 and @xmath70 , with a slope @xmath71 is to be expected since both quantities scale with the forth power of either @xmath3 or @xmath41 .",
    "causality requires furthermore @xmath72 .",
    "we find @xmath73 , as a sign of the seen interaction effects , and @xmath74 .",
    "although there exist some lattice data for two light and one heavier quark , they still have larger uncertainties than for the case @xmath75 considered so far .",
    "nevertheless , based on the available data we can point out some interesting implications . from the universality of the scaled pressure @xmath76 for various numbers of flavors ,",
    "as observed on the lattice @xcite , we can expect that also at @xmath50 the results do not change much besides a scaling from the different number of degrees of freedom in the physical case . on more general grounds we expect an approximately linear relation for @xmath62 for large ranges of the pressure .",
    "this expectation is confirmed by analyzing the available data , and approximating the lepton component in @xmath77 equilibrated matter by an ideal gas .",
    "the results for @xmath78 , in particular , are found to be rather insensitive even under large arbitrary variations of the values @xmath79 and @xmath80 which parameterize @xmath81 .",
    "the slope parameter is found to be constrained by @xmath82 .",
    "the value of @xmath83 , on the other hand , is in our approach directly linked to the transition temperature , @xmath84 .",
    "since @xmath85mev is measured on the lattice , we have a definite prediction for the absolute scale in the equation of state .",
    "our estimate , @xmath86mev , is substantially larger than the typical value of the bag constant obtained from fitting hadron spectra , @xmath87mev .    for a linear equation of state ,",
    "the tolman - oppenheimer - volkov equations imply a scaling property for the total mass and the radius of the star , @xmath88 the effects of deviations of @xmath89 from 3 being small , cf .",
    "figure [ fig : mr rel ] ,      we pointed out @xcite the possibility of the existence of very dense and compact objects , @xmath90 and @xmath91 km , composed mainly of quark matter .",
    "similar values for the maximal mass and radius were found in a perturbative approach with a physically motivated choice of the renormalization scale @xcite . in a schwinger - dyson approach @xcite , @xmath92 and @xmath93 km were obtained .",
    "it is interesting to compare these values with the mass and the radius of the object rxj1856 : @xmath90 and @xmath91 km @xcite , which are not compatible with any hadronic equation of state .",
    "the precise values for @xmath94 and @xmath95 are , however , still under debate ; for a recent discussion , we refer to @xcite .    taking into account the effects of the hadronic crust of the star , its properties become sensitive to details of the hadronic equation of state , and of the transition . for a strong first order transition ,",
    "as suggested in @xcite , a new branch in the mass - radius diagram could exist , see figure [ fig : new branch ] .",
    "the observation of so - called twins , as emphasized in @xcite , could be an exciting astrophysical indication of the existence of a non - hadronic phase in the center of neutron stars . + * acknowledgements * the work of a.  p.  is supported by bmbf ."
