    "the pulsar system psr b1259@xmath263 was discovered at parkes in 1989 and comprises a 47.76 ms radio pulsar orbiting a massive star ( ls 2883 ) in a highly elliptical ( @xmath8 ) orbit with a period of @xmath9 years @xcite .",
    "recent optical spectroscopy @xcite yields an updated distance estimate to this source of @xmath10 kpc , in reasonable agreement with the dispersion measure ( dm ) derived distance of 2.7 kpc using the ne2001 model @xcite , so we adopt @xmath11 kpc .",
    "the companion shows evidence for an equatorial disk in its optical spectrum , and has generally been classified as a be star @xcite .",
    "the pulsar comes within @xmath12 au of its companion star at periastron , which is roughly the size of the equatorial disk @xcite .",
    "the orbital plane of the pulsar is believed to be highly inclined with respect to this disk and so the pulsar crosses the disk plane twice each orbit , just before and just after periastron @xcite .",
    "shock interaction between the relativistic pulsar wind and the wind and photon field of the be star is believed to give rise to the variable unpulsed x - ray emission observed throughout the orbit @xcite and the unpulsed radio and tev @xmath1 rays observed within a few months of periastron @xcite .    at energies around 1 gev ,",
    "the energetic gamma - ray experiment telescope ( _ egret _ ) provided only an upper limit for the 1994 periastron passage ( @xmath13 @xmath14 s@xmath15 for e @xmath0 300 mev , 95% confidence , @xcite ) . in tev",
    "-rays the system was detected during the 2004 and 2007 periastron passages and flux variations on daily timescales were seen for energies @xmath16 0.38 tev in 2004 @xcite .    for the 2010/2011 passage the time of periastron",
    "@xmath4 was on 2010 december 15 .",
    "by comparison to previous passages , the unpulsed radio and x - ray emission was expected to start rising in mid 2010 november peaking around @xmath17d in the pre - periastron phase and reaching another peak around @xmath18d in the post - periastron phase . by 2011 april",
    "these emissions are expected to go back to their levels when the pulsar is far from periastron .",
    "@xcite reported the first discovery of gev -ray emission from this system which was detected during the first disk passage .",
    "a flaring gev -ray activity during the second disk passage was reported in @xcite and in @xcite .",
    "recently @xcite reported with further details the gev -ray activity from this system .",
    "we have assembled a multiwavelength campaign to monitor the system in radio , optical , x - rays , gev , and tev -rays during the 2010/2011 periastron passage .",
    "here we describe the _ fermi_-lat detection of psr b1259@xmath263 in the @xmath19 mev range .",
    "we also present a preliminary analysis of a portion of the radio and x - ray data to determine if there was any anomalous multiwavelength behavior compared to previous periastron passages .",
    "we have analyzed lat data over the entire time period from the beginning of the _ fermi _ mission ( 2008 august 4 ; at which time the pulsar was nearing apastron ) through periastron up until 2011 april 22 which is after the passage of the pulsar through the dense equatorial wind of the massive star .",
    "full analyses and interpretation of the multiwavelength data are deferred to subsequent papers .",
    "analysis of the _ fermi _ lat data was performed using the _ fermi _ science tools 09 - 21 - 00 release .",
    "the high - quality `` diffuse '' event class was used together with the p6@xmath20v3@xmath20diffuse instrument response functions . to reject atmospheric -rays from the earth s limb , we selected events with zenith angle @xmath21 .",
    "we performed standard binned maximum likelihood analysis using events in the range 0.1100gev extracted from a 20@xmath22 region centered on the location of psr  b1259@xmath263 .",
    "the model includes diffuse emission components as well as @xmath1-ray sources within 20@xmath23 of the source ( based on an internal catalog created from 18 months of lat survey data ) .",
    "the galactic diffuse emission was modeled using the ` gll\\_iem\\_v02 ` model and the isotropic component using ` isotropic\\_iem\\_v02 ` . to better constrain the diffuse model components and the nearby sources , we first generated a model using two years of data between 2008 august 4 and 2010 august 4 , a period during which the pulsar was far away from periastron .",
    "we fixed spectral parameters of all the sources between 5@xmath23 and 15@xmath23 from the source , and left free the normalization factor of all the sources within 5@xmath23 that were flagged as variable source in the 1fgl catalog @xcite .",
    "normalizations for the diffuse components were left free as well . for this time period ,",
    "the source was not detected with the lat and we place a 95% upper limit on the photon flux above 100 mev f@xmath24 assuming a power law spectrum with a photon index @xmath25 .",
    "the results of this fit were used to constrain the background source model for analyses on shorter timescales starting in november 2010 . in the source model ,",
    "the normalization of the isotropic component was fixed to the 2-year value , while the normalization for the galactic diffuse component and three variable sources were left free .",
    "we searched for -ray emission from this source on daily and weekly time scales during the first disk passage ( mid november to mid december 2010 ) .",
    "no detection at the level of 5@xmath26 was observed from the source on these time scales .",
    "integrating from @xmath27d ( the typical start of enhanced x - ray and unpulsed radio flux ) to periastron yielded a clear detection of excess -ray flux from the source with a test statistic ( ts ) of @xmath28 which corresponds to a detection significance of @xmath295@xmath26 @xcite . to estimate the duration of this enhanced emission and to get the best fit for the spectrum we looked at the cumulative ts as a function of time for integrations starting at @xmath27d ( figure [ fig : ts ] ) .",
    "inspection of this plot reveals that the ts drops monotonically for integrations ending after @xmath30d , so we use this as the end of the integration for this initial period of detected @xmath1-ray flux . for the rest of the paper we will refer to this period as the `` brightening '' .",
    "+ during the brightening , the detected -ray signal was in the energy range 0.11 gev and no significant emission was detected above 1 gev .",
    "the spectrum in the energy range 0.1 - 1 gev is best described by a simple power law with photon index @xmath31 with average photon and energy fluxes of f = @xmath32 and f = @xmath33 respectively . because of the low signal - to - noise ratio during this period spectral fits to an exponentially cutoff power law were not constraining .",
    "this period is shown as the shaded region on the top panel of figure [ fig : lat_lc ] , which shows the -ray flux in weekly time bins in the period @xmath34d to @xmath35d .",
    "at about @xmath36d the source brightened rapidly , reaching a flux that was @xmath37 times higher than the integrated flux measured during the first disk passage ( figure [ fig : lat_lc ] ) .",
    "this flare lasted for about 7 weeks .",
    "the spectrum during this period ( @xmath36d to @xmath38d ) is best described by a power law with exponential cutoff .",
    "the best - fit result is obtained for a photon index @xmath39 = ( 1.4 @xmath40 ) and a cutoff energy e@xmath41 = ( 0.3 @xmath42 ) gev .",
    "the average photon and energy fluxes above 100 mev during this period are f@xmath43 ( @xmath44 10@xmath45 and g@xmath46 respectively .",
    "+ in addition to the significant difference in flux and spectral shape between the brightening and the flare periods , the weekly time bins show clear evidence for a change in the photon index for a power - law fit on these time scales ( bottom panel of figure [ fig : lat_lc ] ) .",
    "the phonon index softens from 22.5 during the brightening to a value of 3.5 around the peak of the flare .",
    "after that , the index hardens over the rest of the flare period to its values during the brightening .",
    "+ the top panel of figure [ fig : lat_lc_flare ] shows -ray flux as a function of time in 1-day time bins during the flare .",
    "the daily source flux during this period is variabile at the 99.9% confidence level according to the method outlined in @xcite .    during this strong - variability flaring period the source flux varied by a factor of 23 on daily time scales .",
    "the previous upper limits from _",
    "egret _ are fully consistent with the flux observed by during the same orbital phase @xcite . at the time of the bright emission seen by _",
    "fermi _ , which was well above the sensitivity level of _ egret _ , _ egret _ was pointed elsewhere .",
    "to search for evidence of -ray pulsations from psr b1259@xmath263 , we have constructed a radio ephemeris using observations from the 64-m parkes telescope .",
    "using tempo2 @xcite , we fitted a timing model to 45 toas covering the range 2007 oct 6 through 2011 january 16 . using this ephemeris , we folded lat photons in the interval 2008 august 4 through 2010 august 4 , a total of 24 months of observation , all well away from the flaring region near periastron where non - pulsed -ray emission is observed .",
    "we found no statistically significant indication of a pulsed -ray signal from this source .",
    "the pulsed flux upper limit depends on the unknown pulse shape and assumed spectrum .",
    "we therefore use the continuum upper limit on the energy flux above 100 mev of g@xmath47 erg @xmath14 s@xmath15 in our comparisons with the rest of the -ray pulsar population .    comparing this pulsar to the rest of the lat - detected pulsars",
    ", we find that most detectability metrics predict that this should be a -ray pulsar .",
    "although the characteristic age of 333 kyr is fairly large , the spin period is short for a middle - aged pulsar and thus at a distance of 2.3 kpc the @xmath48 of 8.2@xmath49 erg s@xmath15 and magnetic field at the light cylinder of 2.9 @xmath50 g are well within the range where -ray pulsations are typically detected @xcite .",
    "if we assume that the beaming factor @xmath51 is 1 , then the -ray efficiency of the pulsar is less than 0.7% , which is considerably lower than the 10% efficiencies that are typical in this @xmath48 range .",
    "determining whether this pulsar is intrinsically under - luminous in the -ray band or if the low -ray luminosity is simply a geometric effect will require detailed modeling that includes geometrical information from radio polarization measurements .",
    "we have also searched for -ray pulsations during the brightening and flare periods where continuum -ray emission was detected .",
    "no pulsations were detected in these intervals .",
    "this is consistent with this -ray emission originating from the intrabinary shock , which is well outside the light cylinder of the pulsar and thus is not expected to be modulated at the spin period .",
    "pulsed emission was monitored at parkes to look for changes in the dm and rotation measure ( rm ) and determine the duration of eclipse of the pulsed signal .",
    "pulses disappeared on @xmath52d and reappeared on @xmath53 . in the @xmath54 weeks leading up to the disappearance of the pulse , significant changes in the dm were observed .",
    "the system was monitored at frequencies between 1.1 and 10 ghz using the atca array .",
    "twelve observations spanning @xmath55d to @xmath56d were collected .",
    "unpulsed transient radio emission was detected throughout the periastron passage with a behavior similar to that seen in previous observations @xcite , as shown in figure [ fig : radio - xray - flux ] .",
    "x - ray observations of during this passage demonstrated the repeatability of the 1 - 10 kev light curve as shown in figure [ fig : radio - xray - flux ] . as with the periastron passage of 2004 , observed a rapid x - ray brightening starting at @xmath57d .",
    "these observations confirmed the spectral hardening preceding the pre - periastron flux rise .",
    "similarly to previous periastron passages ( see for example @xcite and references therein ) , observations with , and showed a rise of x - ray flux after periastron .",
    "emission from the system is produced in the interaction of the pulsar wind with the stellar wind of the companion star .",
    "observations in radio , x - ray and tev @xmath1-ray bands @xcite revealed a characteristic variability of this emission during the periods of periastron passage .",
    "detection of the 0.1 - 10 gev band @xmath1-ray emission around periastron was not unexpected .",
    "however , _ fermi _ observations reveal puzzling behavior of the source , which was not predicted in any model of @xmath1-ray emission from this system .",
    "an unexpected strong flare , visible only in the gev band was observed some 30 days after the periastron passage and after the neutron star passage of the dense equatorial wind of the massive star .    during this flare",
    "the source was characterized by an extremely high efficiency of conversion of pulsar spin - down power into @xmath1-rays .",
    "the highest day - average flux was f@xmath58 @xmath59 s@xmath60 with a spectral index of @xmath61 .",
    "this corresponds to an isotropic @xmath1-ray luminosity of @xmath62  erg  s@xmath15 , nearly equalling the estimated total pulsar spin down luminosity @xmath63  erg s@xmath15 @xcite .",
    "this is illustrated in figure [ fig : synch ] where the horizontal red line shows the flux which would be produced when 100% of the spin - down power is converted into radiation emitted within one decade of energy , not taking into account possible beaming effects .",
    "broadband spectra of emission around periastron are shown in figure [ fig : synch ] .",
    "strong increases in gev flux and changes in -ray spectrum during the flare were not accompanied by noticeable spectral variations in the x - ray band .    several possible mechanisms of production of 0.1 - 10  gev @xmath1-ray emission from the system were previously discussed : synchrotron , inverse compton ( ic ) , bremsstrahlung , or pion decay emission @xcite .",
    "electrons with energies @xmath64  tev produce synchrotron emission in the energy range @xmath65\\left[e_e/10^{14}\\mbox { ev}\\right]^2 $ ]  ev .",
    "alternatively , electrons with energies @xmath66  gev could produce @xmath1 quanta with energies @xmath67 ^ 2 $ ]  ev via ic scattering of be star photons .",
    "bremsstrahlung emission in the gev band could be produced by the gev electrons .",
    "finally , the dense equatorial stellar wind could provide a sufficiently dense target for proton - proton interactions followed by decays of neutral pions into photons .",
    "figure [ fig : synch ] shows example model fits to the persistent emission data .",
    "the model shown in the upper panel assumes that high - energy particles escape with the speed of the stellar wind , as in the model of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "slow escape of the high - energy particles leaves enough time for the efficient cooling of electrons via ic and/or bremsstrahlung / coulomb loss mechanisms . in the lower panel ,",
    "high - energy particles are assumed to escape with the speed @xmath68  cm s@xmath15 , as in the model of @xcite . in this case",
    "only synchrotron cooling is efficient .",
    "the code used for the calculations is described in @xcite .    in general , the flare could be explained either by anisotropy of the @xmath1-ray emission , or by an abrupt change of physical conditions in the emission region or by the appearance of a new emission component .",
    "several possible sources of anisotropy are present in the system : relativistic beaming of the @xmath1-ray emitting outflow from the system @xcite , anisotropy of pulsar wind , or anisotropy of radiation field of the massive star .",
    "the model for the flare spectrum ( cyan data points ) shown in the lower panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : synch ] assumes a particular type of anisotropy which could appear at the high - energy end of the synchrotron spectrum , at the energies at which the synchrotron cooling distance is comparable to the gyroradius . in such a situation",
    "the electron distribution could not be isotropized within the synchrotron cooling time scale .",
    "the assumpiton that highest energy electrons with anisotropic initial velocity distribution cool before being isotropized , results in the increase of apparent luminosity by a factor @xmath69 where @xmath70 is the solid angle into which most of the highest energy synchrotron power is emitted .",
    "another possibility to explain the flare is considered in the model shown in the upper panel of fig . [ fig : synch ] .",
    "it iassumes a local increase of the density of stellar wind by a factor of @xmath71 which results in the increase of the bremsstrahlung component of emission spectrum .",
    "clarification of the physical mechanism of the puzzling flare discovered by _",
    "fermi _ requires more complete view of the properties of the flare , including information on system behaviour in optical and tev bands and on orbit - to - orbit variations of the gev flaring pattern .",
