    "the higgs boson plays a fundamental role in unified theories of weak , strong , and electromagnetic interactions @xcite .    the klein - gordon equation arising in relativistic physics and , in particular , general relativity and cosmology , as well as , in more recent quantum field theories , is a covariant equation that is considered in the curved pseudo - riemannian manifolds .",
