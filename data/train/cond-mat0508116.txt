    "recently it has been proposed @xcite that in spin - orbit coupling ( soc )  systems one may use an electric field to generate transverse spin currents in the absence of external magnetic fields .",
    "it has been argued @xcite that such a spin hall effect ( she ) is _ intrinsic _ , contributed by _ all _ the electrons below the fermi energy , and the corresponding spin currents are `` dissipationless ''  as in contrast to the dissipative longitudinal charge currents which are only contributed by the electrons close to the fermi energy and are strongly subjected to scattering effects .",
    "the original proposals for the she are for the disorder - free cases.mnz,sinova1 in the two - dimensional ( 2d ) electron gas described by the rashba model,@xcite it was shown based on a perturbative approach @xcite that the shc is precisely cancelled by the vertex correction once the disorder is turned on . on the other hand , the vertex correction is found to vanish @xcite for the three - dimensional ( 3d ) p - doped semiconductors described by the luttinger model @xcite so that the shc is still finite in the presence of weak disorder .",
    "numerical calculations @xcite of the shc seem to support such perturbative results of the distinct behavior for two models in the thermodynamic limit .    experimentally the signatures of spin polarization have been observed recently in 2dhg system @xcite and 3d n - doped semiconductors,@xcite which have generated a lot of excitement concerning whether they are due to the intrinsic she mentioned above or some extrinsic effect.@xcite bernevig and zhang",
    "have shown that the vortex correction does vanish in the 2dhg @xcite and 3d n - doped semiconductor @xcite systems .",
    "furthermore , the mesoscopic she in the 2dhg is also found to be present based on the nonequilibrium green function method @xcite and landauer - bttiker formula with attached leads,@xcite similar to ( with larger magnitude than ) the mesoscopic she found in the 2d rashba model.@xcite but it is still unclear whether the bulk she in the 2dhg can survive in the thermodynamic limit beyond the perturbative approach .    in this paper , we perform numerical calculations for the 2dhg in the presence of disorder . we first show that the bulk shc calculated from the kubo formula is indeed robust against the disorder in extrapolation to the thermodynamic limit , which is consistent with the vertex correction calculation.@xcite it is also similar to the behavior for the luttinger model,@xcite but is in opposite to that  of the 2d rashba model.@xcite but when we perform a laughlin s gedanken `` gauge experiment''on a belt - shaped sample to probe the spin transfer / accumulation due to the she , we obtain a null result due to the anticrossing between energy levels , which is quite similar to what has been previously seen in the 2d rashba model.@xcite we point out that the absence of edge states in the 2dhg system causes the general level repulsion with the turn on of disorder , which leads to the disappearance of the net spin hall accumulation in an open system . furthermore , at zero disorder case , energy levels do cross each other and we find an oscillating spin - density - modulation at the sample boundary after an adiabatic insertion of a flux quantum in the above - mentioned laughlin s gauge experiment .",
    "however , the corresponding net spin transfer is only about one order of magnitude smaller than what is expected from the calculated bulk shc .",
    "we discuss the `` conflicting''results of a finite shc but without an intrinsic spin accumulation in the 2dhg , and point out that the underlying reason can be attributed to the violation of the spin conservation law in such a soc system , where the shc is no longer an unambiguous quantity for describing the spin transport .",

    "[ fig : level_pure ] .",
    "one may imagine changing the flux @xmath86 adiabatically from @xmath98 to @xmath68 to follow the corresponding change of the system .",
    "generally there are two possibilities for the evolution of the ground state with the electrons filled below the fermi energy @xmath38 .",
    "if each single electron state always anti - crosses with other states ( level repulsion ) , it will eventually return to the original state after the insertion of one flux quantum of @xmath99 sufficiently slow ( i.e. , adiabatically such that there is no quantum transition to other levels during this operation ) ; on the other hand , if a level crossing occurs for single electron states during the adiabatical increase of @xmath100 then the original ground state generally will evolve into a different state through the change of the single state occupation number , even though the single electron energy spectrum must remain the same after the insertion of one flux quantum .    a slow increase of the flux @xmath86 is equivalent to applying a weak electric field along the @xmath87 direction:@xmath101then the _ intrinsic _ charge / spin hall effect due to an electric field in belt - shaped system will lead to the transfer of charge / spin along the @xmath102-axis during the flux insertion . if there is to be charge / spin accumulation at the open edges [ fig . [",
    "fig : geometry](a ) ] , it means that the ground state should not return to the original one after the adiabatic flux insertion , which is the essence of laughlin s gauge experiment for the iqhe system .",
    "therefore , the level crossing of single electron states serves as a necessary condition for the existence of _ intrinsic _ spin transfer / accumulation for a she system . as clearly shown in fig .",
    "fig : level_pure , which is determined on an @xmath103 lattice , the single electron energy levels do simply cross in the pure 2dhg system .",
    "the resulting net spin transfer will be analyzed in the following section .      in this section ,",
    "we calculate the spin transfer induced by tuning the flux @xmath105 from @xmath98 to @xmath68 in the pure case ( @xmath29 ) . starting from the periodic bc ( @xmath93 ) ,",
    "the momentum @xmath106 along @xmath87 direction is a good quantum number . and",
    "due to the open boundary along the @xmath102 direction , the electron states form a mini - band structure which is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : band_o ] and can be denoted as @xmath107 , where @xmath108 is the index of the mini - bands .",
    "if we choose an arbitrary fermi energy @xmath38 , the ground state corresponds to that all the single particle states below @xmath38 are occupied , whereas unoccupied above @xmath38 .",
    "so the spin density along @xmath88 direction ( labelled by @xmath109 ) at the initial state can be defined by @xmath110when one inserts the flux adiabatically from zero to @xmath86 , the state @xmath111 , for @xmath112 and @xmath113 , the corresponding energies of the states will increase and decrease , respectively , which is illustrated by arrows in fig .",
    "fig : band_o .",

    "[ fig : spin_dis](a ) . here",
    "@xmath117 is almost sample - size independent at the edge , whereas it reduces monotonically with the sample size in the bulk .",

    "similar results with smaller magnitude are also obtained for an electron spin-@xmath121 rashba model as shown in fig .",
    "fig : spin_dis(b ) for comparison .",

    "( [ electric ] ) , but the magnitude of the total ( integrated ) @xmath122 at one edge is much less than one spin quantum , which is in sharp contrast to the large bulk shc ( the calculated @xmath123 , that suggests a total spin transfer of @xmath124 spin quanta ) .",
    "this large discrepancy between two approaches indicates that the shc is no longer an unambiguous quantity for measuring the spin transport even in the pure case . in the following we",
    "further explore the disorder case .",
    "now we consider the disorders effect .",
    "[ fig : level ] shows the results for a chosen disorder configuration with @xmath125 in a @xmath126 lattice .",
    "a careful examination of the energy levels reveals that each eigenstate goes up and down , making several large angle turns due to backward scattering .",
    "these energy levels never cross with each other , except for at @xmath127 and @xmath128 , where two levels become exactly degenerate ( kramers degeneracy ) .",
    "then if one follows any kramers degenerated pair of states starting from @xmath127 to @xmath129 , one will always go back to exactly the same pair of states .",
    "namely , after the adiabatic insertion of one flux quantum , all states evolve exactly back to the starting states .    for comparison with the @xmath130 case , in fig .",
    "[ fig : scattering](a ) we combine an enlarged plot of two adjacent energy levels in fig.fig:scattering together with the pure case , where the solid lines are for the disordered case and the dashed lines are for the clean case . in the pure case , an electron at the state @xmath131 ( @xmath132 ) will finally evolve to @xmath133 ( @xmath134 ) with increasing flux due to the level crossing .",
    "however , in contrast to the level crossing in the pure system , two energy levels , @xmath135 in the disordered system generally show a level repulsion as one increases the flux @xmath100 to evolve into the final states of @xmath134 and @xmath136(b ) .",
    "we have done similar calculations at different lattice sizes , such as @xmath137 , @xmath138 and @xmath139 .",
    "the results are all similar except that the `` gaps '' characterizing the level repulsion decrease with the lattice size , which are roughly proportional to @xmath140 . according to the discussion in sec .",
    "[ sec : gelc ] , the adiabatic insertion of the flux @xmath92 will not generate true spin transfer or accumulation as the ground state simply evolves back after a flux quantum insertion .",
    "in fact , we have checked various weak disorder strengths and always found the same generic result .    therefore ,",
    "we conclude that there is no intrinsic spin hall accumulation ( spin transfer ) for the 2dhg system in the disorder case .",
    "this conclusion is in sharp contrast to the calculated shc at small @xmath82 in sec . [",
    "sec : shc ] , which remains finite and close to the value of the pure case when the disorder is weak .",
    "according to the discussion at the beginning of sec .",
    "[ sec : sa ] , these two approaches , for a bulk system on a torus or as an open system with two edges , are not necessarily in accordance with each other , because the spin current continuity equation is broken .",
    "for example , a backward scattering of an electron by an impurity shown by fig . [ fig : scattering](b ) can simultaneously change the sign of its momentum _ as well as _",
    "its spin direction due to the soc .",
    "then one can find that the spin current is still additive ( same sign ) in this scattering process , which contributes to the shc accordingly , but there should be no true spin transfer taking place because of the backward scattering of the spin carrier  electron which moves back in direction after the scattering .      to further understand the condition for the presence of level crossing in the disordered case , we apply an external magnetic field perpendicular to the 2d sample ( with a flux strength @xmath141 per plaquette ) and repeat the above calculation .",
    "we find that most of the `` gaps '' still behave as @xmath140 , similar to those in the non - magnetic - field case . these are bulk states .",
    "but we can also identify a few levels whose level - repulsion `` gaps '' reduce exponentially with @xmath37 with the increase of the sample size .",
    "for example , such kind of `` gap '' at @xmath126 lattice size is about @xmath142 of the one at @xmath143 lattice size , an exponential dependence on system length .",
    "we show some of these `` level crossings '' in fig .",
    "[ fig : mag_level ] with the same parameters as in fig .",
    "[ fig : level ] .",
    "the `` gaps '' in fig .",
    "fig : mag_level are much smaller than the ones in fig .",
    "[ fig : level ] and hard to distinguish with the naked eye .",
    "the exponential decaying form of the gaps indicate the existence of level crossings in the thermodynamic limit in the presence of a perpendicular magnetic field , which corresponds to an iqhe . then a net charge ( spin )",
    "is transported from one edge to the other correspondingly.@xcite    we have also systematically compared the spatial distribution of electron density @xmath144 of the states in the 2dhg system with and without the presence of a perpendicular magnetic field .",
    "it is found that the level crossing only occurs for the edge states .",
    "physically this is because in the thermodynamic limit the distance between two edge states in the opposite sides of the sample goes to infinity , which makes the scattering between them vanishes exponentially .",
    "thus the absence of level crossing ( and the intrinsic spin hall transfer ) in the 2dhg system can be attributed to the fact that there do not exist any edge states in such a system in the absence of perpendicular external magnetic fields .",
    "in the present work , we have numerically calculated the shc through the kubo formula at different lattice sizes and impurity strengths . a reasonable finite - size scaling",
    "analysis shows that the bulk shc remains finite in the thermodynamic limit in the disordered 2dhg up to a critical disorder strength @xmath145 .",
    "this result is consistent with the perturbative calculation based on the vertex correction.@xcite    however , we have also found the strong evidence that the net spin hall accumulation or spin transfer disappears in the disordered case based on a numerically performed laughlin s gauge experiment .",
    "we have interpreted the conflicting results of the shc and direct spin accumulation calculations as due to the fact that the spin is not conserved in an soc system and there is no longer a conservation law to govern the spin current .",
    "therefore the shc is no more a unique quantity to characterize the spin transport , where electron spin can relax and vanish in the bulk without being transported across the sample by a transverse electric field .    by comparing with the case in the presence of an applied perpendicular magnetic field , which is in the iqhe regime ,",
    "we have shown that the absence of an intrinsic spin transfer ( accumulation ) can be related to that there are no edge states in the 2dhg system , in contrast to the iqhe case .",
    "we further address the validity of the above adiabatic argument in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "it is noted that since an intrinsic spin transfer ( accumulation ) is always _ absent _ in a finite size system according to the above argument , it is very hard to imagine that such an effect could be restored as an _ intrinsic _ one by the landau - zener tunnelling kubo1 between two anticrossing levels in the thermodynamic limit . of course",
    ", the landau - zener tunnelling between the level repulsion gaps in the large sample size limit ( the level repulsion gap vanishes in a @xmath140 fashion , with the _ same _ rate as the average level spacing vanishing in this limit ) can still contribute to _ dissipative _ transport currents , and similar to the conventional charge transport , one may expect a dissipative spin transport term appearing , besides the null _ intrinsic _ spin transfer . here the dissipative spin transport is qualitatively different from the true level crossing with edge states . at a finite @xmath82 , in the longitudinal channel , the so - called thouless conductance  term can be obtained based on the sensitivity of the energy level to the threading flux , giving rise to a finite @xmath146,@xcite which is subject to the detailed scattering mechanism as contributed by the levels near the fermi energy . in the present soc system , a dissipative spin hall transfer related to this longitudinal conductance is indeed possible , which similarly involves only the states near the fermi energy .",
    "we note that such a dissipative term may also be important for the spin - polarization measured experimentally@xcite .",
    "the vanishing spin transfer revealed through laughlin s gedanken gauge experiment for the present 2dhg and 2d electron rashba model@xcite under an adiabatic procedure may be a generic behavior for a metallic system.@xcite it would be interesting to directly probe this property for more soc systems , including the 3d luttinger model , although numerically it is more challenging for the latter as it is much harder to do the finite - size scaling for the level repulsion gaps in a 3d system .",
    "finally , it is interesting to note that several recent papers have studied topological she in insulating electron systems with soc.@xcite in these models , it becomes clear that bulk intrinsic shc can result in spin transfer and accumulation , with the presence of spin - polarized edge states , which is associated with a topological invariant .",

    "<S> on the other hand , energy levels do cross each other , which results in an oscillating spin - density - modulation at the sample boundary after the insertion of one flux quantum in the belt - shaped system . </S>",
    "<S> but the corresponding net spin transfer is only about one order of magnitude smaller than what is expected from the bulk shc . </S>",
    "<S> these apparently contradictory results can be attributed to the violation of the spin conservation law in such a system . </S>",
    "<S> we also briefly address the dissipative fermi surface contribution to spin polarization , which may be relevant to experimental measurements . </S>"
