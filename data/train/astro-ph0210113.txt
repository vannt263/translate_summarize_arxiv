    "the mass of the central black hole ( bh ) is of paramount importance in theoretical models of agn . in particular",
    ", the dependence of bh mass ( @xmath0 ) on global host galaxy properties provides clues to the role of bhs in galaxy formation and evolution .",
    "dynamical determination of @xmath0 in agn is difficult because of the bright nuclear emission .",
    "the main method that has proved to be successful for agn is the time - consuming reverberation mapping of broad emission lines . only for a few quasars and seyfert galaxies @xmath0",
    "is thus known ( e.g. kaspi et al . 2000 ; wandel 2002 ) .",
    "reverberation mapping can not obviously be employed for bl lac objects because they lack prominent broad emission lines .",
    "the discovery of a correlation between @xmath0 and the bulge luminosity in nearby early - type galaxies ( e.g. magorrian et al .",
    "1998 ) offered a new tool for evaluating @xmath0 ( see merritt & ferrarese 2001 ) .",
    "this correlation has been applied so far for nearby quasars ( mclure & dunlop 2001 ) and bl lacs ( treves et al .",
    "2002 ) .",
    "recently , a tighter correlation was found relating @xmath0 with the stellar velocity dispersion @xmath1 of the bulge in nearby inactive galaxies ( gebhardt et al .",
    "2000 ; ferrarese & merritt 2000 ) .",
    "this relationship clearly demonstrates a connection between bhs and bulges of galaxies and has spurred substantial effort in theoretical modelling ( e.g. silk & rees 1998 ; hhnelt & kauffmann 2000 ) .",
    "the relationship predicts more accurately @xmath0 , but requires the measurement of @xmath1 in agn host galaxies that is difficult , in particular for objects at high redshift and with luminous nuclei . on the other hand ,",
    "bl lacs have relatively fainter nuclei than quasars , and for low redshift bl lacs this measurement can be secured with a single spectrum observable with a medium - sized telescope .    we have carried out medium resolution optical spectroscopy of the host galaxies of nearby ( z @xmath8 0.2 ) bl lac objects to derive @xmath1 and to determine @xmath0 .",
    "here we present results based on a sample of 7 bl lacs including 2 lbls ( 3c 371 and pks",
    "2201 + 04 ) and 5 hbls ( see also falomo , these proceedings ; and full discussion in falomo , kotilainen & treves 2002 ) , for all of them , high quality images have been obtained either from the ground ( falomo & kotilainen 1999 ) or with hst ( urry et al . 2000 ; falomo et al .",
    "2000 ) . from these images , the characterization of the host galaxies and the nuclear luminosity can be obtained . in falomo , kotilainen & treves ( in prep . )",
    ", we shall discuss the implications of the results of the full sample of 11 bl lacs for the unified models of radio - loud agn .",
    "the observations were obtained using the 2.5 m nordic optical telescope ( not ) equipped with alfosc .",
    "spectra were secured using two grisms to cover the spectral ranges 4800  5800   ( setup a ) and 5700  8000   ( setup b ) at 0.54   pixel@xmath2 and 1.3   pixel@xmath2 dispersion , respectively .",
    "this allows us to measure the absorption lines of h@xmath9 ( 4861  ) , mg i ( 5175  ) , ca e - band ( 5269  ) , na i ( 5892  ) and the tio + cai ( 6178  ) , tio + fei ( 6266  ) and other absorption line blends from the host galaxies at a spectral resolution r @xmath103000 .    the chosen grisms combined with a 1  slit yield a spectral resolution for @xmath1 measurement of @xmath1060  80 km s@xmath2 , which is adequate for the expected range of @xmath1 in luminous ellipticals ( e.g. djorgovski & davis 1987 ; bender , burstein & faber 1992 ) such as the hosts of bl lacs .",
    "in addition , we acquired spectra of bright stars of type g8-iii to k1-iii , that exhibit low rotational velocity ( v@xmath3@xmath11 20 km@xmath12 ) to be used as templates of zero velocity dispersion . furthermore , spectra of the well studied nearby elliptical galaxy ngc 5831 were secured to provide a test of the adopted procedure to derive @xmath1 .    during the observations , seeing ranged between 1  and 1.5 .",
    "the slit was centered on - target or positioned 1  away from the nucleus and the 1d spectrum was extracted from an aperture of 3  - 5   diameter , in all cases within the effective radius of the host galaxy . in one case ( mrk 180 ) ,",
    "spectra with the slit both on - target and off - centered by 1  were taken but no significant difference was found in the shape of the spectral features .    the stellar velocity dispersion @xmath1 was determined using the fourier quotient method ( e.g. sargent et al .",
    "the spectra were normalized by subtracting the continuum , converted to a logarithmic scale and multiplied by a cosine bell function that apodizes 10% of the pixels at each end of the spectrum .",
    "all regions affected by emission lines ( see fig .",
    "1 ) have been masked in the analysis . finally",
    ", the fourier transform of the galaxy spectra were divided by the fourier transform of template stars and @xmath1 was computed from a @xmath13 fit with a gaussian broadening function ( see e.g. bertola et al . 1984 ;",
    "kuijken & merrifield 1993 ) .",
    "the @xmath14 scatter of the @xmath1 results using different template stars was typically @xmath1010 km@xmath12 and can be considered as the minimum uncertainty of the measurement .    for three objects",
    "we have spectra in both spectral ranges .",
    "the resulting values of @xmath1 are in good agreement , ensuring sufficient homogeneity of data taken with different grisms and/or resolution .",
    "note , however , that there is a tendency for the red grism ( lower resolution ) data to result in slightly larger value of @xmath1 .",
    "for the nearby elliptical ngc 5831 we obtained @xmath1 = 167@xmath155 and 185@xmath1510 km s@xmath2 for the setup a and b , respectively , in good agreement with previous measurements ( @xmath16 = 168 km s@xmath2 ; prugniel et al .",
    "1998 ) . in fig .",
    "1 we show the spectrum of the bl lac object pks 2201 + 04 , observed in both spectral ranges .    since early - type galaxies exhibit gradients in velocity dispersion ( e.g. fisher , illingworth & franx 1995 ) , the measured value of @xmath1 depends somewhat on the distance of the galaxies and the aperture size ( see falomo et al .",
    "2002 for details ) .",
    "the individual measurements of corrected @xmath1 are given in table 1 .",
    ".velocity dispersion and bh masses of bl lacs .",
    "[ cols= \" < , < , < , < , < , < \" , ]     barth , ho & sargent ( 2002 ) have recently reported a similar systematic study of @xmath1 in 11 bl lac objects , six of which are common with our sample .",
    "there are some discrepancies for individual bl lacs , most notably for mrk 501 and i zw 187 , for which they derive @xmath1 = 372@xmath1518 and 171@xmath1512 km s@xmath2 , respectively .",
    "these differences are most likely related to the method of deriving @xmath1 ( fourier quotient vs. direct fitting ) and the different wavelength range used .",
    "the average values of @xmath1 , however , are in good agreement in the two samples .",
    "we have adopted the relationship between @xmath0 and @xmath17 found for nearby early - type galaxies based on optical spectroscopy ( merritt & ferrarese 2001 ) : @xmath0 = 1.48@xmath150.24 @xmath3 10@xmath5 ( @xmath1/200 km s@xmath2)@xmath18 [ m@xmath19 .",
    "we assume that this relationship is also valid for bl lacs .",
    "this is consistent with imaging studies of bl lacs ( falomo & kotilainen 1999 ; urry et al .",
    "2000 ; falomo et al 2000 ) , indicating that all bl lacs are hosted by giant ellipticals .",
    "the derived values of @xmath0 are reported in table 1 , where the errors are the composition in quadrature of uncertainties in @xmath1 and in the merritt & ferrarese ( 2001 ) relationship .",
    "using instead the gebhardt et al .",
    "( 2000 ) relationship tends to yield slightly lower values of @xmath0 but does not substantially modify our main conclusions .",
    "the values of @xmath0 ( table 1 ) span a factor @xmath1020 from 5 x 10@xmath4 m@xmath6 for pks 2201 + 04 to 9 x 10@xmath5 m@xmath6 for mrk 501 , with a median value of 4 x 10@xmath5 m@xmath6 .",
    "these values are in good agreement with those derived by barth et al .",
    "( 2002 ) .",
    "as mentioned above , @xmath0 is also correlated with the bulge luminosity of the host galaxy .",
    "@xmath0 was calculated following the relationship by mclure & dunlop ( 2002 ) : log @xmath0 = 0.50@xmath150.05 m@xmath20  2.91@xmath151.23 [ m@xmath21 .",
    "the corresponding values of @xmath0 are given in table 1 .",
    "for most sources the difference of @xmath0 derived with the two methods is within the estimated uncertainty .",
    "the average values of @xmath0 derived , respectively , from @xmath1 and the host luminosity are : @xmath8log@xmath22 = 8.62 @xmath15 0.23 and @xmath8log@xmath23 = 8.66 @xmath15 0.25 .",
    "the measurements of @xmath1 combined with the effective radii of the host galaxies can be used to estimate the mass of the hosts through the relationship ( bender et al .",
    "1992 ) : @xmath24=5@xmath25/g .",
    "this dynamical mass ( table 1 ) is in the range of 1  4 x 10@xmath26 m@xmath6 .",
    "the ratio between @xmath0 and @xmath24 is in the range of 0.5  3.6 @xmath3 10@xmath7 , with average @xmath27/@xmath28 = 1.4 @xmath3 10@xmath7 .",
    "this is in good agreement with values derived for both agn and inactive galaxies ( @xmath27/@xmath28 = 1.2 @xmath3 10@xmath7 ; mclure & dunlop 2001 ; merritt & ferrarese 2001 ) .    according to the unified model of radio - loud agn ( e.g. urry & padovani 1995 ) , bl lacs are drawn from the population of fr i radio galaxies viewed along the jet axis .",
    "it is therefore interesting to compare orientation - independent properties of bl lacs and radio galaxies .",
    "the largest comparison sample with available measurements of @xmath1 , effective radii and surface brightness is that of 73 low redshift radio galaxies by bettoni et al .",
    "( 2001 , 2002 ) . in fig .",
    "2 , we compare the distribution of the bh masses of the bl lacs and the radio galaxies from bettoni et al .",
    "the close similarity of the distributions in these samples implies that the distributions of @xmath0 in bl lacs and radio galaxies are indistinguishable , consistent with both types of agn belonging to the same parent population , observed from different orientation angles ( see also barth et al .",
    "additional support to this view is given by the similarity of bl lacs and radio galaxies on the fundamental plane ( see e.g. falomo , these proceedings ; barth et al .",
    "however , due to the small number statistics of the bl lacs , and the incompleteness of the samples , this result can not yet be considered conclusive .",
    "furthermore , there is a clear dearth of bl lacs with the largest @xmath0 ( @xmath29 10@xmath30 m@xmath6 ) , consistent with bl lac hosts being biased toward less massive and less luminous host galaxies than radio galaxies ( e.g. urry et al .",
