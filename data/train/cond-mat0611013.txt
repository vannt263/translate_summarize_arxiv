    "spin - orbit interaction ( soi ) in semiconductors attracts much attention , since it makes possible to control electron spins without magnetic field , a goal of spintronics @xcite .",
    "soi is very small in a vacuum , since its strength is inversely proportional to the dirac gap creating electron - positron pairs @xmath0 @xmath1 ev .",
    "in contrast to a vacuum , soi is largely enchanced for electrons in semiconductors , since the corresponding energy of creating electron - hole paris is given by the band gap @xmath2 ev @xcite .",
    "this is why sois play important roles in spintronics .",
    "sois have been shown to generate spin currents perpendicular to bias current , a phenomenon called spin hall effect ( she ) , which is expected to be a useful tool for creating spin polarized current .",
    "she is explained as a result of spin dependent sccaterings through impurity potential by dyakonov and perel @xcite , and independently by hirsch @xcite and zhang @xcite .",
    "meanwhile , other scenarios are proposed for @xmath3type bulk semiconductors described by luttinger hamiltonian @xcite , and for @xmath4type two dimensional semiconductors with the rashba type soi @xcite .",
    "in addition to the rashba soi @xcite , dresselhaus soi @xcite is also shown to generate spin current in exactly opposite direction to the one which the rashba soi gives @xcite .",
    "these transverse spin currents have been expected to generate opposite out - of - plane spin accumulations at the lateral edges of sample , analogously to hall effect ; longitudinal current induces charges with opposite signs at the transverse edges .",
    "this theoretical prediction was confirmed in the recent experiments @xcite .",
    "several theoretical studies suggest that the spin accumulation are caused by three sois @xcite .",
    "the rashba soi @xcite and the dresselhaus soi @xcite are shown to cause opposite spin accumulations at lateral edges . recently ,",
    "et al_. @xcite have shown that the soi coming from the edge potential can induce the spin accumulation as well . here , a question arises , as to how these three sois determine spin density . as far as authors are aware , no calculation including all three types of sois has been published .    in this paper we study the effects of three sois on spin accumulation in a two dimensional electron system ( 2des ) .",
    "spin density is calculated analytically for the soi from edge potential , and numerically for the rashba and the dresselhaus sois .",
    "finally we investigate the effects of all sois .",
    "all sois are shown to generate opposite out - of - plane spin accumulations at the lateral edges .",
    "we also find that the rashba and the dresselhaus sois are competitive , as is the case for she .",
    "the soi from the edge potential is shown to generate similar acuumulation to the experiment @xcite .",
    "for each sois we discuss precisely the mechanism of spin accumulation .",
    "schematic figure of the system .",
    "a two dimensional system is sandwiched between two contacts . @xmath5 and @xmath6 are chemical potentials and we assume @xmath5 > @xmath6.,width=226 ]",
    "we consider a ballistic 2des with two reflectionless contacts , illustrated in fig.[fig : system ] .",
    "it means that electrons injected from one contact move freely without scatterings in the 2des , and enter the other contact without reflections . in our setup , electrons are confined in @xmath7 @xmath8 direction by edge potential @xmath9 @xmath10 .",
    "although the edge potential profile in a real system is like @xmath11 in fig.[fig : edgepotential](a ) , considering the edge potential like @xmath12 in fig.[fig : edgepotential](b ) is enough to understand the spin accumulation observed in the experiments .",
    "it is because the spin accumulation occurs only in the vicinity of the edges , and as far as the edge spin polarization is concerned , there is no essential difference between these two potentials .",
    "we assume @xmath12 to be harmonic potential to make calculation easier . in this model ,",
    "hamiltonian for electrons compose of free electron part @xmath13 and the sois part @xmath14 .",
    "hamiltonian for free electrons is given by     ( a ) the edge potential in real systems : @xmath11 is zero in the center and gradually increases toward the edges .",
    "( b ) the edge potential in our study : considering only the edge effect , width=321 ]    @xmath15    where @xmath16 is momentum , @xmath17 is effective mass of electrons ( in our work , we choose gaas as the host of the electronic syetem , i.e. @xmath18 ) , @xmath19 is a harmonic oscillator frequency .",
    "we assume that the confining potential @xmath20 is so strong that all electrons are in the lowest energy state in @xmath21 direction .",
    "hamiltonian for the sois consists of three parts , @xmath22 where @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 are respectively the soi from the edge potential , the rashba soi , and the dresselhaus soi .",
    "@xmath26 is pauli matrix , @xmath27 is lande factor ( @xmath28 in gaas ) , @xmath29 is planck constant divided by @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 characterize the strength of the rashba and the dresselhaus sois , @xmath33 is @xmath34 ev in gaas .",
    "hereafter we take @xmath21 axis as the spin quantization axis .",
    "in this section , we calculate spin density in @xmath21 direction @xmath35 which was detected in the experiments @xcite .",
    "to investigate the effects of each sois precisely , we divide this section into three subsections .",
    "firstly we study the effect of only the soi from the edge potential , and secondly the rashba and the dresselhaus sois , and finally , all of them .",
    "all calculations are done assuming zero temperature .      in the case of the soi from the edge potential ,",
    "hamiltonian is given , @xmath36     spin density and electron density are plotted as a function of x for fermi energy @xmath37 mev , @xmath38 mev , @xmath39 mev .",
    "up - spin ( down - spin ) electrons accumulate in @xmath40 @xmath41 @xmath7 direction .",
    "@xmath42 is the characteristic length of the harmonic oscillator.,width=226 ]    here , we can replace @xmath43 and @xmath44 respectively , by @xmath45 ( @xmath46 for up - spin , @xmath47 for down - spin ) and @xmath48 , since these two operators commute with @xmath49 . before diagonalization , we rewrite hamiltonian to see how the edge potential works on electrons through soi , @xmath50 the second term represents harmonic potential depending on spin and wavenumber .",
    "up- and down - spin electrons with the same wavenumber @xmath51 feel different potential effectively .",
    "for example , for up - spin ( down - spin ) electron with @xmath52 , its potential minimum shifts to @xmath40 @xmath41 @xmath7 direction .",
    "this hamiltonian can be easily diagonalized and eigenstates and energies are given by @xmath53 where @xmath54 and @xmath55 are wavefunctions of the harmonic oscillator for band index @xmath56 and of spin part .",
    "as we can see easily , the center of density profile shifts depending on the electron spin in @xmath21 direction and the wavenumber in y direction .",
    "up- and down - spin states are energetically degenerate . using these wavefunctions ,",

    "electrons with energy @xmath61 have negative wavenumber , and contribute to spin accumulation at zero temperature . by assuming @xmath62 , we obtain analytical expression of spin density in the linear response regime , @xmath63 where @xmath64 is fermi wavenumber of band index _",
    "n _ given by @xmath65 in this expression , @xmath66 represents that up - spin ( down - spin ) electron accumulates in @xmath40 @xmath41 @xmath7 direction , so contributions from two states @xmath67 result in opposite spin accumulations . of course , the summation for band index _",

    "the spin density profile depends on the lande factor @xmath68 . in the case",
    "@xmath69 , spin density profile is opposite to the result in fig.[fig : cond2 ] .",
    "we also plot the spin density , as a function of the strength of the harmonic potential with keeping fermi energy constant in fig.[fig : edge1 ] .",
    "the width of the spin density and the number of its oscillations are characterized by the wavefunctions of electrons in the highest band . in the strong trapping limit ,",
    "only electrons in the lowest subband generate the spin accumulation with the narrow width and a small number of oscillations .",

    "we expect non - zero spin density in applied electric field as in the previous section .",
    "a calculation for spin density @xmath35 is the same as eq@xmath80 . to see the effects of two sois ,",
    "the spin density is plotted in fig.[fig : rashdre ] , as a function of the rashba strength with keeping the dresselhaus strength constant , since the rashba strength can be tuned by gate voltage @xcite . from fig.[fig : rashdre ] , two sois are shown to generate competitive result , that for @xmath81 ( @xmath82 ) , the spin density at the edges is up - spin - like ( down - spin - like ) in @xmath83 direction , and down - spin - like ( up - spin - like ) in @xmath84 direction . in the case @xmath74 , the effects of two sois cancel out each other and the spin density is exactly zero in the entire region .",
    "spin polarization at the peak is about @xmath85 .",
    "this accumulation is obviously caused by two sois , but how the sois work physically is unclear .",
    "such a difficulty comes from the fact that electron spins are not conserved . to see how",
    "the sois change electron spin states , we derive dynamical force acting on electrons in @xmath7 direction , given by @xmath86,h]$ ] @xcite , @xmath87 the second term shows that the rashba and the dresselhaus sois cancel out in the case @xmath88 . in quantum mechanics , the force is hard to deal with , so we calculate back an effective potential from @xmath89 , just as in classical mechanics , giving a spin dependent effective potential , @xmath90 from this expression , it is clear that the second term determins the profile of spin density .",

    "this figure looks similar to the previous result ( fig.[fig : rashdre ] ) , but , even in the case @xmath88 , the spin density is not zero .",

    "one of the most characteristic results is that the signs of spin accumulation from the edge potential is opposite depending on the lande factor @xmath68 .",

    "all three sois were shown to induce opposite spin accumulations at the lateral edges , which was observed in the experiments .",
    "we also showed that the rashba and the dresselhaus sois produce competitive results .",
    "especially when the strength of both sois are equal , their effects cancel each other . in that case , the spin accumulation caused by the soi from the edge potential remains , and the analytical expression was obtained for the spin density .",
