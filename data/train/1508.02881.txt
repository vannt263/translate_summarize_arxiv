    "dark matter in the form of dark atoms can be a viable solution to the current experimental puzzle .",
    "even stable electrically charged particles can exist hidden in such atoms , bound by ordinary coulomb interactions ( see @xcite and references therein ) . stable particles with charge -1",
    "are excluded due to overproduction of anomalous isotopes of hydrogen . however , for negatively doubly charged particles the constraints are much weaker and this possibility remains open .",
    "there are several models where heavy stable -2 charged species @xmath3 can emerge naturally :    * ac - leptons , from theories beyond the standard model , based on the approach of almost - commutative geometry @xcite .",
    "* technileptons and anti - technibaryons in the framework of walking technicolor ( wtc ) @xcite . *",
    "stable  heavy quark clusters \" @xmath4 formed by anti-@xmath5 quark of a 4th generation @xcite .",
    "all these models predict also corresponding + 2 charge particles .",
    "if these positively charged particles remain free in the early universe , they can recombine with ordinary electrons in anomalous helium , which is strongly constrained in terrestrial matter .",
    "therefore a cosmological scenario should provide a mechanism which suppresses anomalous helium .",
    "there are three possible mechanisms that can provide a suppression :    * the abundance of anomalous helium in the galaxy may be significant , but in terrestrial matter a recombination mechanism could suppress it below experimental upper limits @xcite .",
    "this possibility requires a new u(1 ) gauge symmetry which materialises as a long range interaction among dark matter particles mediated by a dark photon . * free positively charged particles",
    "are already suppressed in the early universe and the abundance of anomalous helium in the galaxy is negligible @xcite . * excessive positively charged particles are created in deficit relative to excessive negatively charged particles and bind with them in neutral atom - like states @xcite .",
    "these three possibilities correspond to three different cosmological scenarios of dark atoms .",
    "the first one is realized in the scenario with ac leptons , forming neutral ac atoms @xcite .",
    "the second assumes a charge asymmetry of the @xmath3 which forms the atom - like states with primordial helium @xcite . in the third case , which can be realized in wtc ,",
    "the excess of positively charged technibarions @xmath6 is much smaller , than the excess of negatively charged @xmath7 , so that all the free @xmath6 are captured by @xmath7 in ( @xmath8 ) neutral bound states @xcite . in wtc",
    "( see  @xcite and references therein for a review ) new stable species ( techniquarks and technileptons ) that transform under nontrivial representations of the su(2 ) electroweak group , participate in sphaleron processes that eventually determine the relative abundance between baryons and -2 charged species  @xcite .",
    "after formation during the standard big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) era , @xmath9 screens the @xmath3 charged particles in composite @xmath10 _ @xmath11",
    "_ `` atoms '' @xcite . in all the models of @xmath11",
    ", @xmath3 behaves either as a lepton or as a specific  heavy quark cluster \" with strongly suppressed hadronic interactions .",
    "however @xmath11 is a strongly interactive massive particle ( simp ) due to the @xmath9 nucleus .",
    "the cosmological scenario of the @xmath11 universe involves only one parameter of new physics i.e. the mass of o@xmath12 .",
    "such a scenario is insensitive to the properties of @xmath3 ( except its mass ) , since the main features of the @xmath11 dark atoms are determined by their nuclear interacting helium shell . in terrestrial matter",
    "such dark matter species are slowed down and can not cause significant nuclear recoil in the underground detectors , making them elusive in direct wimp search experiments ( where detection is based on nuclear recoil ) such as cdms , xenon100 and lux .",
    "the positive results of dama and cogent experiments ( see @xcite for review and references ) can find in this scenario a nontrivial explanation due to a low energy radiative capture of @xmath11 by intermediate mass nuclei  @xcite .",
    "this can explain the negative results of the xenon100 and lux experiments .",
    "the rate of this capture is proportional to the temperature : this leads to a suppression of this effect in cryogenic detectors , such as cdms .",
    "ohe collisions in the central part of the galaxy can potentially lead to ohe excitations and de - excitations with pair production in e0 transitions that can explain the excess of the positron - annihilation line , observed by integral in the galactic bulge @xcite .",
    "one should note that the nuclear physics of ohe is in the course of development .",
    "the basic feature that determines the elastic ohe - nuclei interactions is an electric dipole potential due to the ohe s charged constituents .",
    "this potential requires a specific quantum mechanical analysis  @xcite .",
    "the lack of a coulomb barrier seems to lead inevitably to overproduction of anomalous isotopes @xcite .",
    "however one should study precisely how quantum tunneling is modified in this case .",
    "it has been shown @xcite that a two - component dark atom scenario is also possible and can be naturally realized in the framework of wtc , where both stable doubly charged technileptons @xmath7 , playing the role of @xmath3 , and positively doubly charged technibaryons @xmath13 are present .",
    "the two - component dark matter scenario is realised by having an abundance of @xmath7 , which binds with @xmath14 , and a much smaller excess of @xmath6 , that binds with @xmath7 , forming a wimp - like @xmath15 component of dark matter . in the framework of wtc",
    ", @xmath6 can be metastable , with a dominant decay channel to a pair of positively charged leptons .",
    "we argued in @xcite that even a @xmath16 fraction of such positively charged techniparticles with a mass of @xmath17 tev and a lifetime of  @xmath18 , decaying to @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 , can potentially provide an explanation for the observed excess of cosmic ray positrons , while being compatible with the observed gamma - ray background .",
    "the anomalous excess of high - energy positrons in cosmic rays was first observed by pamela @xcite and was later confirmed by ams-02 @xcite .",
    "these results generated widespread interest , since the corresponding effect can not be explained by positrons of only secondary origin and requires primary positron sources , e.g. annihilations or decays of dark matter particles .",
    "recently the ams-02 collaboration has reported new results on positron and electron fluxes in cosmic rays  @xcite and positron fraction  @xcite .",
    "these measurements cover the energy range @xmath19 gev for electrons and @xmath20 gev for positrons and provides important information on the origins of primary positrons in the cosmic rays .",
    "in particular , the new results show for the first time , that the positron fraction no longer exhibits an increase with energy above @xmath21 gev . the possibility of explaining the cosmic positron excess by decays of @xmath13 particles , comprising the tiny wimp - component of dark matter in the considered scenario , was discussed in detail in  @xcite . here",
    "we make a blind search within the whole parameter space and we find the optimal values that give the best possible fit to both ams-02 data on cosmic positron flux and fermi / lat data on diffuse gamma - ray flux  @xcite .",
    "the paper is organised as follows : in section  [ fluxcalc ] we briefly discuss the high - energy positron abundance in cosmic rays and the calculation of cosmic positron and gamma - ray fluxes from decays of dark matter particles and in section  [ fitting ] we search for the best - fit parameter values and discuss the prospects of positron anomaly explanation in the framework of the considering model .",
    "we conclude in section  [ concl ] .",
    "the abundance of high - energy positrons in cosmic rays ( also known as  positron anomaly \" ) , which was first observed by heat  @xcite and was later confirmed by various experiments , such as atic  @xcite , ams-01  @xcite , fermi  @xcite , pamela  @xcite and ams-02 @xcite , can be a possible astrophysical manifestation of metastable dark matter .",
    "alternative explanations of this phenomenon include old supernova remnants  @xcite ans pulsars  @xcite . here",
    "we are going to consider the case where an unstable , though long - living , doubly - charged heavy particle @xmath6 , which is part of a tiny ( @xmath22 ) wimp - like component of dark matter @xmath15 , decays as @xmath23 in principle with different relative probabilities .",
    "all decay modes produce positrons and photons either directly or through decay cascades .",
    "photons appear in leptonic decays as final state radiation ( fsr ) , arising from @xmath24 decays to hadrons and from inverse compton scattering ( ics ) on the interstellar electromagnetic background .",
    "the latter processes are not taken into account in this work , since their contribution was found to be subdominant @xcite . since there is no production of antiprotons in our scenario , diffuse gamma background gives the most stringent constraints .",
    "+ here we shall briefly remind the calculations of positron and gamma - ray flux , done in @xcite .",
    "the positron flux can be estimated as @xmath25 here @xmath26 is the speed of light , @xmath24 is the lifetime of @xmath13 , @xmath27 is the local number density of @xmath13 particles with @xmath28 being the fraction of dark matter in the form of @xmath15 , @xmath29 is the mass of @xmath13 , @xmath30 is the mass of the positron , @xmath31 is the number of positrons produced in a single decay ( obtained using pythia 6.4  @xcite ) , @xmath32 s@xmath33gev@xmath33 is the average energy loss rate and the factor    @xmath34     + takes into account effectively the finite size of the magnetic halo ( @xmath35 , @xmath36 ) , @xmath37 is the characteristic diffusion length , @xmath38 denotes a heaviside step - function ( see  @xcite for details )",
    ". here we will be interested in energies @xmath39 , where the effects of solar modulation are negligible @xcite .",
    "the spectrum of secondary positron was taken from  @xcite",
    ".    for gamma rays produced by @xmath13 decays in our galaxy , the flux arriving at the earth is given by @xmath40 where we use an isothermal number density distribution @xmath41 . here",
    "@xmath42 and @xmath43 are respectively the distances from the earth and the galactic center .",
    "we obtain the averaged flux over the solid angle @xmath44 corresponding to galactic lattitudes @xmath45 and galactic longitude @xmath46 . out of our galaxy decays of @xmath13",
    "are homogeneously distributed over the universe and should also contribute to the observed gamma - ray flux .",

    "the total gamma - ray flux arriving at the earth is @xmath54 in @xcite we showed that the considered model can in principle accommodate nicely the ams-02 data on positron abundance in cosmic rays @xcite , being consistent with the fermi / lat data on diffuse gamma - ray background ( inclusive photon spectrum ) @xcite . in the following section we find the best fit parameters , taking into account the latest relevant data from ams-02 @xcite and fermi / lat @xcite .",
    "in order to find the best possible fit for the data we vary four parameters : the mass of the decaying particle @xmath55 , it s lifetime @xmath24 and two values of branching ratios @xmath56 and @xmath57 ( the third one is automatically fixed by @xmath58 ) . to find the parameter values which provide the best fit of the positron flux data and",

[ positronflux ] ) , @xmath63 is the ams-02 statistical error , @xmath64 is a set of fermi / lat igrb data points ( @xmath65 - we choose only data points in the high - energy region , where the fermi / lat data give the most stringent limit on the predicted gamma - ray flux ) , and @xmath66 stands for the predicted gamma - ray flux ( see eq .",
    "[ gammaflux ] ) .",
    "@xmath67 corresponds to the fermi / lat statistical error , and @xmath68 is a heaviside step function ( it excludes the contribution of the points where @xmath69 ) . to simplify this analysis",
    "we evaluate the minimal value of @xmath70 for each value of mass @xmath55 in the range @xmath71 ( with a @xmath72 step ) . once the mass is fixed , the parameters we scan over are @xmath73 .",
    "the number of statistical degrees of freedom is @xmath74",
    ". the lower limit on the mass value comes from the search for long - lived doubly charged particles at the lhc  @xcite .",
    "the rest of the model parameters can have any reasonable value ( branching ratios should have a positive value up to 1 and the lifetime should be around @xmath75 s ) . by using the aforementioned method",
    "we obtain for each value of @xmath13 mass the set of optimal parameters that fit the observational data in the best way . to probe whether or not a particular scenario can provide a good agreement with the experimental data , we treat @xmath70 as a common @xmath76 statistical test and use the pearson s chi - squared test .",
    "the results of our analysis are presented in fig .",
    "[ chi2new ] .",
    "as it can be seen the best possible scenario takes place at @xmath77 for @xmath78 .",
    "however , it is clear that the obtained parameters provide a not - so - good description of experimental data due to the constraints , following from fermi / lat data . for this set of parameters ,",
    "we show respectively in fig .",
    "[ positrons ] and [ gammaray ] the predicted positron fraction and gamma - ray background , compared to the experimental data .    despite the fact that the fit is not good , there are ways that can alter the picture and render the considered scenario viable .",
    "one possibility is that fsr production can turn out to be suppressed in the case of two identical particle final state ( like @xmath0 ) , compared to the case , where two non - identical particles ( like @xmath79 ) are created , as it was assumed in our calculations .",
    "a second way out is related to the current uncertainties of the cosmic - ray propagation model , that includes errors of diffusion coefficients , unaccounted effects such as re - acceleration and choice of source distribution and halo geometry .",
    "a rough estimate shows ( see fig .",
    "[ chi2without ] ) that each of the two proposed ideas applied to the considered model , can significantly reduce the @xmath70 value for a considerable range of @xmath13 masses .",
    "however , a more detailed study and better understanding of the uncertainties of cosmic rays propagation is required in order to clarify the viability of the considered @xmath13 decay model .",
    "in addition , one should note that inverse compton scattering processes were not taken into account and their contribution into diffuse gamma - ray flux can also affect slightly the fit .",
    "if the standard model can serve as a guiding theory for the explanation of the dark matter puzzle , there is no reason , why dark matter must be a single particle  @xcite .",
    "multi - component dark matter with components that contribute different amounts to the total dark matter abundance is a possible scenario .",
    "there can easily be a dark matter realization where a dominant simp - like component like @xmath80 is accompanied by a small wimp - like component @xmath15 .",
    "this can be particularly interesting because there have been several issues with the validity of the cold collisionless dark matter paradigm recently .",
    "the core vs cusp problem in dwarf galaxies , the number of satellite galaxies and the  too big to fail problem \" might be manifestations of the fact that dark matter might be warmer than what was thought until now ( see e.g.  @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "a two component dark matter scenario can in fact resolve the aforementioned issues .",
    "the scenario considered here involves a form of neutral @xmath11 dark atoms made of stable heavy doubly charged particles and primordial he nuclei bound by ordinary coulomb interactions .",
    "this scenario can be realized in the framework of minimal walking technicolor , where an exact relation between the dark matter density and baryon asymmetry can be naturally obtained .",
    "strict conservation of technilepton charge together with approximate conservation of technibaryon charge results in the prediction of two types of doubly charged species with strongly unequal excess , i.e. dominant negatively charged technileptons @xmath7 and a strongly subdominant component of technibaryons @xmath6 , bound with @xmath7 in a sparse component of wimp - like dark atoms ( @xmath81 ) .",
    "direct searches for wimps put severe constraints on the presence of this component .",
    "however we have demonstrated in  @xcite that the existence of a metastable positively doubly charged techniparticle , forming this tiny subdominant wimp - like dark atom component and satisfying the direct wimp searches constraints , can play an important role in the indirect effects of dark matter .",
    "we found that decays of such positively charged constituents of wimp - like dark atoms to leptons @xmath82 can explain the observed excess of high energy cosmic ray positrons , while being compatible with the observed gamma - ray background .",
    "these decays are naturally facilitated by gut scale interactions .",
    "the best fit of the data takes place for a mass of this doubly charged particle around 1 tev or below making it accessible in the current run of lhc .",
    "our refined best fit analysis of the recent ams-02 and fermi / lat data presented here , can provide a crucial test for the decaying dark atom hypothesis especially since lhc in its second run will be able to probe the parameter space where this dark atom model is viable .",
