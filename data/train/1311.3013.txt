    "paper , collapse occurs at positive integer multiples of @xmath12 , hence the name : _ fast - collapsing theories_.    our result is weakened in the sense that the background theory of knowledge is weakened .",
    "the schema @xmath13 ( @xmath14 denotes universal closure ) is weakened by adding the requirement that @xmath15 not be nested deeper in @xmath7 than in @xmath16 ( the unrestricted schema @xmath17 is preserved , but the knower is not required to _ know _ it ) ; the schema @xmath18 is forfeited entirely ; and a technical axiom called assigned validity ( made up of valid formulas with numerals plugged in to their free variables ) is added to the background theory of knowledge .    on the bright side , our result is stated in a more general way ( we mention in passing how the full unweakened result could also be so generalized , but leave those details for later work ) . casually , our main theorem has the following form :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ a truthful knowing agent whose knowledge is sufficiently `` generic '' can be taught its own truthfulness and still remain truthful .",
