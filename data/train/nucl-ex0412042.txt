    "in the recent years , there have been a number of experimental and theoretical studies aimed at understanding the effects of large deformations in the case of light - mass nuclei .",
    "the very elongated prolate or triaxial shapes were deduced from the spectra of the giant dipole resonance ( gdr ) from the decay of @xmath0ti@xmath1  @xcite and @xmath5sc@xmath1  @xcite .",
    "the results were consistent with predictions of the lsd ( lublin - strasbourg drop ) model  @xcite , in which the large deformations are ascribed to the jacobi shape transition .",
    "the large deformations were also indicated by the measurement of energy spectra and angular distributions of the light charged particles ( lcp ) originated from the decay of @xmath6ti@xmath1 @xcite as formed in two fusion reactions @xmath7o",
    "+ @xmath8si  @xcite and @xmath9s + @xmath10c  @xcite .",
    "in addition , a number of superdeformed bands of discrete @xmath11-ray transitions were discovered in selected @xmath12 nuclei belonging to this mass region ( e.g.  @xcite ) . in this paper , we focus on the measurement of the lcp spectra in coincidence with evaporation residues ( er ) for the reaction @xmath2al  +  @xmath3f at a bombarding energy of @xmath13(@xmath2al )  =  144  mev . in the following sections the experimental setup , the data analysis and the discussion of the preliminary results are presented .",
    "the experiment was performed at the vivitron tandem facility of the ires strasbourg ( france ) , using the multidetector array icare and a large volume ( 4@xmath144@xmath15 ) bgo detector . the @xmath0ti@xmath1 compound nucleus ( cn )",
    "was populated by the @xmath2al  +  @xmath3f reaction at the 144  mev bombarding energy of the aluminium beam .",
    "the inverse kinematics reaction was chosen to increase the residual nuclei velocity in order to resolve the highest @xmath16 ( the slowest evaporation residues ) produced in the reaction .    a fluorine target ( lif : 150 @xmath17g/@xmath18 of f , 55 @xmath17g/@xmath18 of li ) on a thin carbon backing ( 20 @xmath17g/@xmath18 )",
    "the excitation energy of the @xmath0ti nuclei was 85  mev and the maximum angular momentum @xmath1935",
    "@xmath20 .",
    "high - energy @xmath11-rays from the gdr decay were measured using the bgo detector .",
    "the heavy fragments were detected in six gas - silicon telescopes ( ic ) , each composed of a 4.8  cm long ionization chamber with a thin mylar entrance window followed by a 500  @xmath17 m thick surface barrier silicon detector .",
    "the ic were located at @xmath21 in three distinct reaction planes .",
    "the in - plane detection of coincident lcp s was done using ten triple telescopes ( 40  @xmath17 m si , 300  @xmath17 m si , 2  cm csi(tl ) ) placed at forward angles ( @xmath22 ) , eighteen two - element telescopes ( 40  @xmath17 m si , 2  cm csi(tl ) ) placed at forward and backward angles ( @xmath23 ) with @xmath24 angular step , and finally four other ic telescopes located at the most backward angles ( @xmath25 ) .",
    "the opening angle of the detectors was @xmath26 .",
    "the ic were filled with isobutane at a pressure of 40.5  mbar for the forward angles and of 49.6  mbar in backward angles , thus allowing for simultaneous measurement of both heavy and light fragments .",
    "the energy calibrations of various telescopes of the icare multidetector array were done using radioactive @xmath27th and @xmath28am @xmath4-particle sources in the  mev energy range and elastic scattering of 45  mev @xmath29b , 53  mev @xmath7o and 144  mev @xmath2al from @xmath30au target .",
    "in addition , the @xmath10c(@xmath7o,@xmath4)@xmath31mg@xmath1 reaction at 53  mev was used to provide known energies of @xmath4-particles feeding the @xmath31 mg excited states , thus allowing for an accurate calibration of the backward angle detectors .",
    "exclusive energy spectra of the @xmath4-particles emitted in the laboratory frame at the angles @xmath32 in coincidence with @xmath16  =  18 , 19 , 20 measured by ionization chamber located at @xmath33 are shown in fig .  1 by the solid points .",
    "all measured spectra have the expected maxwellian shape with an exponential fall - off at high energy .",
    "the dashed and solid lines are the results of statistical - model calculations .",
    "the analysis of lcp data has been performed using cacarizo , the monte carlo version of the statistical - model code cascade  @xcite , which is based on the hauser - feshbach formalism  @xcite .",
    "the compound nucleus decays are followed step - by - step and evaporated lcp s and neutrons are recorded in an event file .",
    "the main practical advantage of the code is that the effective experimental geometry ( solid angle and position ) of the icare detectors is taken into account in the calculation of the charged particle energy spectra",
    ". therefore one can , on the event - by - event basis , convert the calculated energies into the laboratory frame for an easier comparison of the calculated and measured spectra .",
    "the sensitivity of various parameters for the statistical description , as the nuclear level densities and barrier transmission probabilities , has been discussed in detail in ref .  @xcite . in the calculations ,",
    "the transmission coefficients @xmath34 of all competing evaporation channels have been evaluated with optical model parameters for spherical nuclei  @xcite .",
    "the choice of the transmission coefficients is of particular importance in the near - barrier region , where they define the emission probability of low - energy particles . above the barrier ,",
    "the kinetic energy of lcp is higher than the potential barrier and the choice of @xmath34 parameterizations is less important ( see ref .",
    "the high - energy part of @xmath4-particle spectra depends on the available phase space , which is obtained by the statistical model from the spin - dependent level density .",
    "the level density is calculated using the rotating liquid drop model ( rldm )  @xcite and can be changed using the deformability parameters .",
    "larger deformations lower the yrast line , what increases the level density at higher available excitation energy of the final nucleus after @xmath4 emission , thus reduce @xmath4-particle energies . in the code",
    ", the yrast line is parameterized with deformability parameters @xmath35 and @xmath36 : @xmath37 with @xmath38  @xcite , where @xmath39 is the effective moment of inertia , @xmath40  =  ( 2/5 )  @xmath41 is the rigid body moment of inertia of the spherical nucleus and @xmath42 is the radius parameter ( set to 1.3 fm in the present calculations ) .    for the calculations ,",
    "two different deformation sets are applied with different yrast line shape parameterizations .",
    "2 illustrates the yrast line for a spherical rigid body and the two yrast lines used in present calculations : for shapes following the rldm predictions ( spherical up to @xmath43  =  24  @xmath20 and nearly spherical above ) and for very elongated prolate shapes ( @xmath35  =  4.7@xmath44 , @xmath36  =  1@xmath45 ) .",
    "the latter values of the deformability parameters are taken from the previous studies on the @xmath6ti nucleus @xcite .",
    "the angular momentum distribution used in the statistical - model calculation is dependent on the diffusivity parameter @xmath46@xmath43 and the critical angular momentum for fusion @xmath47 .",
    "for the final calculations the value of @xmath46@xmath43  =  1 is used  @xcite and the value of @xmath4835  @xmath20 is deduced from the fusion cross section data  @xcite .    the dashed lines in fig .  1",
    "show the energy spectra of @xmath4-particles predicted by cacarizo assuming the rldm yrast line .",
    "it can be observed that average energies of @xmath4-particles measured in coincidence with all er ( @xmath16  =  18 , 19 , 20 ) are systematically lower than predicted .    the solid lines in fig .  1",
    "illustrate the calculations of cacarizo , which were obtained using the yrast line deformability parameters corresponding to large prolate deformations ( such yrast line corresponds , on average , to the yrast line of a rigid body with the deformation parameter @xmath49 ) . as can be seen , such parameterization results in a very good overall reproduction of the spectral shapes of the @xmath4-particles detected in coincidence either with @xmath16  =  18 or with @xmath16  =  19",
    ".    however , the spectra associated with @xmath16  =  20 are in disagreement with the calculations . in order to improve the agreement , an even more deformed yrast line ( rather unrealistic ) would be required .",
    "one should note here , that the condition for the @xmath4-particle and the @xmath16  =  20 residue to belong to the same event induces a severe narrowing of the available phase space to only the highest angular momenta of cn .",
    "this might suggest indeed the occurence of very elongated shapes around @xmath43  =  30  @xmath20 , as expected for the jacobi shape transition , confirming the gdr results of ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "however , a more refined analysis , including also a consistent treatment of the energy spectra of the protons , the lcp angular correlations and the high - energy @xmath11-ray spectra , will have to be undertaken in order to confirm such hypothesis .",
    "this work was partially supported by the polish committee for scientific research ( kbn grant no . 2 p03b 118 22 ) and by the exchange programme between the _ institut national de physique nuclaire et de physique des particules , @xmath50 _ , and polish nuclear physics laboratories .",
