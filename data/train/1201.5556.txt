    "the andr - oort conjecture asserts that every irreducible component of the zariski closure of a set of special points in a shimura variety is a special subvariety",
    ". there has been remarkable progress on this conjecture recently .    in the late 1990 s ,",
    "edixhoven proved the conjecture for hilbert modular surfaces and products of modular curves assuming the generalized riemann hypothesis ( grh ) in  @xcite and  @xcite .",
    "both proofs exploit the galois action on special points and use geometric properties of hecke correspondences . in the special case of a product of two modular curves ,",
    "andr  @xcite gave a proof without assuming grh .",
    "these methods were extended in  @xcite by edixhoven and yafaev to prove the conjecture for curves in general shimura varieties containing infinitely many special points all lying in the same hecke orbit .",
    "subsequently , yafaev  @xcite also proved the conjecture for general curves assuming grh .",
    "recently , klingler , ullmo and yafaev have announced a proof of the full andr - oort conjecture assuming grh , see  @xcite and  @xcite .",
    "their methods use a combination of the methods of edixhoven and yafaev and equidistribution results of clozel and ullmo  @xcite established by methods from ergodic theory .    for a more detailed exposition of results concerning the andr - oort conjecture for shimura varieties , we refer to the survey article of noot  @xcite .",
    "_ drinfeld modular varieties _ are a natural analogue of shimura varieties in the function field case .",
    "they can be interpreted as moduli spaces for drinfeld @xmath0-modules over a global function field @xmath1 of a given rank  @xmath2 with @xmath3-level structure , where @xmath0 is the ring of elements of @xmath1 that are regular outside of a fixed place @xmath4 and @xmath5 is a compact open subgroup with @xmath6 the ring of adeles of @xmath1 outside @xmath4 .",
    "one can define _ special subvarieties _ of a drinfeld modular variety  @xmath7 parametrising drinfeld @xmath0-modules of rank @xmath2 in analogy to the case of shimura varieties . for each finite extension @xmath8 of @xmath1 of degree @xmath9 with only one place above @xmath4 and integral closure @xmath10 of @xmath0 in @xmath8 , the restriction of drinfeld @xmath10-modules to @xmath0",
    "gives a morphism from the moduli space of drinfeld @xmath10-modules of rank  @xmath11 ( with a certain level structure ) to @xmath12 defined over @xmath8 .",
    "these morphisms are analogues of morphisms induced by a shimura subdatum . a special subvariety  @xmath13 is defined to be a geometrically irreducible component of a hecke translate of the image of such a morphism .",
    "special point _ is a special subvariety of dimension  @xmath14 .",
    "in fact , we can interpret each special subvariety  @xmath13 as a geometrically irreducible component of a _ drinfeld modular subvariety _ which is the union of galois conjugates of @xmath13 over the corresponding extension  @xmath8 of @xmath1 .",
    "a drinfeld modular subvariety  @xmath15 is the image of the composition of an above morphism defined by the restriction of drinfeld  @xmath10-modules to @xmath0 with a morphism given by a hecke correspondence .",
    "such a composition , called _ inclusion morphism _",
    ", is associated to an extension @xmath16 of the above type and an @xmath6-linear isomorphism @xmath17 encoding the involved hecke correspondence .",
    "we say that @xmath8 is the _ reflex field _ of @xmath15 and its geometrically irreducible components .",
    "in  @xcite , pink constructs the _ satake compactification _  @xmath18 of a drinfeld modular variety  @xmath19 .",
    "it is characterized up to unique isomorphism by a certain universal property .",
    "if @xmath3 is sufficiently small in a certain sense , there is a natural ample invertible sheaf  @xmath20 on @xmath18 .",
    "this allows us to define the _ degree _ of a subvariety of @xmath19 as the degree of its zariski closure in @xmath18 with respect to  @xmath20 .",
    "the degree of a subvariety can be seen as a measure for the `` complexity '' of the subvariety .",
    "the following analogue of the andr - oort conjecture was formulated by breuer in  @xcite :    [ conj*:ao ] let @xmath7 be a drinfeld modular variety and @xmath21 a set of special points in @xmath12 .",
    "then each irreducible component over  @xmath22 of the zariski closure of @xmath21 is a special subvariety of  @xmath12 .",
    "breuer  @xcite proved this analogue in two cases .",
    "firstly , when the zariski closure of @xmath21 is a curve , and secondly when all special points in  @xmath21 have a certain behaviour at a fixed set of primes .",
    "earlier in  @xcite , he proved an analogue of the andr - oort conjecture for products of modular curves in odd characteristic .",
    "these proofs use an adaptation of the methods of edixhoven and yafaev in  @xcite , @xcite and  @xcite .",
    "the results are unconditional because grh holds over function fields .    in this thesis ,",
    "we extend the arguments of breuer using an adaptation of the methods of klingler and yafaev in  @xcite .",
    "our main result is the following theorem :    [ th*:main ] conjecture  [ conj*:ao ] is true if the reflex fields of all special points in  @xmath21 are separable over  @xmath1 .    since the reflex field of a special point in a drinfeld modular variety",
    "@xmath19 is of degree  @xmath2 over @xmath1 , special points with inseparable reflex field over @xmath1 can only occur if @xmath2 is divisible by @xmath23 .",
    "so theorem  [ th*:main ] implies    conjecture  [ conj*:ao ] is true if @xmath2 is not a multiple of @xmath24 .",
    "we need to show that a geometrically irreducible subvariety  @xmath25 of @xmath19 containing a zariski dense subset of special points with separable reflex field over @xmath1 is a special subvariety .",
    "an induction argument shows that it is enough to show the following crucial statement :    [ th*:reduced ] let @xmath21 be a set of drinfeld modular subvarieties of @xmath12 of dimension  @xmath26 whose union is zariski dense in a subvariety @xmath27 of dimension  @xmath28 which is defined and irreducible over @xmath1 .",
    "then , for almost all @xmath29 , there is a drinfeld modular subvariety @xmath30 of @xmath12 with @xmath31 .    in  @xcite , klingler and yafaev",
    "perform the same induction , however they work with special subvarieties instead of certain unions of their galois conjugates ( drinfeld modular subvarieties in our case ) .    in the proof of this statement , we can assume w.l.o.g . that    * @xmath3 is sufficiently small such that the degree of subvarieties of @xmath7 is defined , and * @xmath25 is _ hodge generic _ ,",
    "i.e. , no geometrically irreducible component of @xmath25 is contained in a proper drinfeld modular subvariety of @xmath12 .",
    "we give a classification of the drinfeld modular subvarieties of  @xmath12 and then use it to show the following unboundedness result :    [ th*:unbounded ] if @xmath21 is an infinite set of drinfeld modular subvarieties of @xmath12 , then @xmath32 is unbounded as @xmath15 varies over @xmath21 .",
    "note that , for a special subvariety  @xmath13 which is a geometrically irreducible component of a drinfeld modular subvariety  @xmath15 , the union of the galois conjugates of @xmath13 over its reflex field is equal to @xmath15 .",
    "therefore , @xmath32 measures both the degree of  @xmath13 and the number of galois conjugates of @xmath13 .",
    "so our unboundedness statement tells us that it is not possible that in an infinite family of special subvarieties @xmath13 , the degrees and the number of galois conjugates of @xmath13 are both bounded .",
    "since we can exclude this case , we only need an adaptation of the galois - theoretic and geometric methods in  @xcite and do not need equidistribution results as in  @xcite .",
    "we deduce a geometric criterion for @xmath25 being equal to  @xmath12 .",
    "it is a key ingredient of our proof of theorem  [ th*:reduced ] and says that @xmath25 is equal to the whole of @xmath12 provided that @xmath25 is contained in a suitable hecke translate  @xmath33 of itself .",
    "a similar geometric criterion appears in the proof of klingler and yafaev in the classical case .",

    "the proof of this theorem is based on two results :    zariski density    we define the @xmath42-orbit of a geometric point @xmath43 to be the smallest subset of @xmath44 containing @xmath45 which is invariant under @xmath46 and @xmath47 . we show that the @xmath42-orbit of an arbitrary point @xmath48 is zariski dense in the geometrically irreducible component of @xmath12 containing @xmath45 provided that @xmath49 is chosen such that the cyclic subgroup of @xmath39 generated by the image of @xmath50 is unbounded .    a result of pink  ( * ? ? ? * theorem 0.1 ) on the galois representations associated to drinfeld modules implies that the image of the arithmetic tale fundamental group of a geometrically irreducible component of @xmath25 is open in @xmath51 , see theorem 4 in  @xcite .",
    "here we need our assumption that @xmath25 is hodge - generic .",
    "our final step of the proof of theorem  [ th*:reduced ] consists of an induction which uses a hecke correspondence with specific properties . by induction",
