    "@xmath11rb atoms laser cooled with a magneto - optical trap are transferred to an optical dipole trap at 1560 nm , that uses a 4 mirror optical resonator to enhance the laser intensity @xcite .",
    "the atoms are trapped at the crossing of two cavity arms with a waist of 100 @xmath15 m .",
    "the ensemble is evaporatively cooled by decreasing the intensity of the dipole trap till a temperature of 10 @xmath15k is reached for 5@xmath3010@xmath45 atoms in a cloud with 1/@xmath46 radius of 50 @xmath15 m . in the last operation before starting the ramsey interrogation the atoms are optically pumped in the @xmath7 state . the sequence to prepare the ensemble in the initial state , which corresponds to the dead time @xmath43 in the atomic clock sequence , lasts 1.9 s.",
    "the measurement of @xmath20 is based on the dispersion caused by the trapped atoms on a far off - resonance optical probe .",
    "the probe beam has a waist of 47 @xmath15 m matched to the size of the atomic cloud .",
    "it is phase modulated at a frequency of 3.853 ghz and frequency referenced at 3.377 ghz on the red of the the f=1@xmath47f=2 transition ; these conditions produce a symmetric mixing of the @xmath7 and @xmath8 states because of probe induced spontaneous emission , thus avoiding a vertical offset when the bloch sphere contracts . in this way",
    ", each sideband mainly probes the population of one of the two levels , with the same magnitude and opposite sign for the couplings .",
    "we cancel the probe induced light shift and the related decoherence by precisely compensating the effect of the carrier with that of the sidebands ; the cancellation is obtained by setting a modulation depth of @xmath48 for the phase modulation .",
    "the differential light - shift on the d2 line from the dipole trap at 1560 nm was compensated with light blue detuned from the @xmath49 transitions at 1529 nm . when the total power of the probe is set to 480 @xmath15w",
    ", it causes the decay of the atomic coherence with a lifetime of 2.85 @xmath15s ; in the experiment here reported the interrogation pulses , obtained using an amplitude electro - optic modulator , have been set to last 60 ns .",
    "each pulse determines then a 2% destructivity of the ensemble coherence , and a snr of 20 for the @xmath20 measurement on the initial sample of 5@xmath3010@xmath45 atoms .",
    "the population imbalance read - outs have been normalized to the signal when all atoms were repumped to the state f=2 .",
    "the 6.835 ghz frequency used to coherently manipulate the atomic spin is generated by a frequency chain based on a spectra dynamics dlr-100 system as a frequency reference .",
    "the dlr-100 relies on an ultra - low noise 100 mhz quartz , locked at low frequency to the 10@xmath50 harmonic of a frequency doubled 5 mhz quartz to further improve the phase noise .",
    "the 100 mhz signal is multiplied to 7 ghz and then mixed with a tunable synthesizer at 165 mhz to obtain the signal resonant with the transition between the @xmath51 and @xmath8 state .",
    "the noise added by the microwave pulses to the measurement of @xmath20 is negligible for our weak probe , and its control well below the atomic quantum projection noise level has already been shown in @xcite .",
    "frequency noise is added to the lo signal using a frequency modulation port on the synthesizer , with a conversion factor set to 200 hz / v@xmath52 .",
    "the noise signal for the demonstration of the clock using the pll sequence is generated with a signal generator , which produces white frequency noise with a spectral density of 2.7@xmath3010@xmath53 hz@xmath54/hz ; this signal is low pass filtered at 1.85 khz before being added to the lo .",
    "the result is a rms phase drift of 430 mrad over 10 ms for the lo .",
    "the atomic populations on the @xmath7 and @xmath8 states determine a differential phase shift of the probe sidebands . as a consequence",
    ", the probe beam is modulated in amplitude , and the modulation signal is detected by a photodiode ( 1591nf , new focus ) , amplified ( two hmc716lp3e , hittite ) and demodulated ( zx05 - 73c - c+ , minicircuits ) . the electronic integration of this signal during the 60 ns interrogation pulse produces a voltage proportional to the average atomic population difference during the probing .",
    "such a voltage is digitized by a 14 bit resolution analog - to - digital converter embedded in the microcontroller unit ( mcu ) used to control the feedback loop ( aduc841 , analog devices ) . in the experiments implementing the phase lock between the lo and the atomic superposition the mcu controls the phase actuator , a 6 bits step phase shifter with a range of 2@xmath5 ( rfpsht0204n6 , rf - lambda ) .",
    "the total delay for the feedback is approximately 150 @xmath15s depending on the calculation time of the mcu .",
    "when running the clock based on the pll technique , the mcu acts as well on a frequency actuator , which is the frequency modulation input on the 165 mhz synthesizer .",
    "the feedback controller we propose for the clock exploiting the phase lock between the lo and the atomic superposition state consists of a cycle divided in three main steps : in the first one , successive correlated interrogations with probe interval t are realized on the same coherent atomic ensemble , and feedback on the lo phase is applied .",
    "the control law is @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the estimated phase difference between the lo and the atoms at the i-_th _ cycle and @xmath57 is the phase of the lo only .",
    "the values of @xmath58 are saved in the feedback controller and typically a gain @xmath59 is chosen .",
    "the second step consists in the final phase readout : at the end of the n-_th _ interrogation interval of duration t , a destructive measurement @xmath31 of the phase is performed , with the highest possible precision .",
    "the saved phase shifts on the lo and @xmath31 are used to reconstruct the full phase drift between the lo and the atoms in the total interrogation time , equal to t@xmath29=n@xmath30 t .    in the third step ,",
    "one then performs feedback on the frequency as in a conventional atomic clock @xmath60 where @xmath61 and @xmath62 is the clock cycle .",
    "in addition , the phase shift set by the feedback controller on the lo is reset to zero @xmath63 the cycle then repeats .",
    "the important feature of the feedback controller is that the feedback actions on the lo oscillator phase during the interrogation time are saved .",
    "they are then used with the output of the final precise measurement to determine the total phase drift .",
    "there is no drawback from the uncertainty of the weak measurements , since any feedback errors are detected with the precise final measurement at the end .",
    "as already remarked , in the experimental demonstration of the clock operation , we adopted the same probe for the intermediate and the final measurements ."

    "<S> the dashed black line lies a factor 3 below the red curve , and is the optimum level for 9 consecutive uncorrelated ramsey measurements with duration t each and the same total cycle time . </S>",
    "<S> ( bottom ) the grey triangles represent the ratio of the allan deviation for the two clocks ; the solid and dashed lines correspond to the factors 9 and 3 from the top plot.,width=325 ]    the phase lock can be performed as long as the coherence of the state is maintained . for integration times longer than the coherence lifetime of the trapped ensemble , the atomic phase is lost and our locking scheme becomes again a frequency lock , like when the quantum superposition is destroyed by the detection . in our experiment , </S>",
    "<S> the coherence lifetime is limited to 20 ms by the dephasing in the optical dipole trap . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , trapped induced dephasing of the atomic state can be suppressed for @xmath11rb as reported in @xcite , whereas in an optical lattice it is strongly reduced with the choice of light at the magic wavelength @xcite . in the original proposal to lock the local oscillator phase on the atomic phase @xcite , frequency feedback on the local oscillator after each weak @xmath20 measurement </S>",
    "<S> is performed . </S>",
    "<S> this scheme leads to a longer effective interrogation time , but to a snr given by the weak measurements , which is lower than that of a measurement at the quantum projection noise and beyond . </S>",
    "<S> our protocol can overcome this limit , and reach projection limited readout while keeping an extended interrogation time , thanks to the feedback on the lo phase .    in the phase lock sequence , </S>",
    "<S> several effects must be considered to maximize the snr of the last measurement while maintaining a high accuracy on the total phase drift over the increased interrogation time : the rotations operated on the bloch sphere must be fast , the measurement induced decoherence limited , and the phase shifter used for the correction accurate . </S>",
    "<S> the decoherence related to the repeated interrogations of the relative phase can be strongly reduced by the use of an optical cavity to enhance the probe interaction with the atomic ensemble @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> an optimized clock configuration would consist in a two atomic ensembles using the same lo : the first ensemble provides the information to implement the phase feedback algorithm on the lo ; the resulting corrected phase for the lo stays in the inversion region for a much longer period , and this prestabilized lo is used to interrogate the master ensemble with the standard ramsey sequence . </S>",
    "<S> this scheme avoids the requirement of a trade - off between the number of intermediate measurements and the snr of the final measurement by separating the two problems . </S>",
    "<S> it also removes the systematics imposed by the intermediate coherent manipulations and measurements of the atomic state , which now affects only the first ensemble . </S>",
    "<S> the solution promises the same benefits foreseen for the phase reconstruction schemes proposed in @xcite , but using only a single additional ensemble .    in an atomic clock </S>",
    "<S> the phase lock between the lo and the atomic superposition state can reduce the dick effect @xcite , _ </S>",
    "<S> i.e. _ the aliasing of the clock oscillator , thanks to the longer interrogation time . however , the most important advantage of the scheme is the reduction of the decoherence related to the local oscillator , which translates to a lower white noise frequency for a fixed detection noise . </S>",
    "<S> the noise reduction can be exploited to lower the lo stability requirements to the benefit of other parameters , like portability of the experimental setup , for mobile or spatial applications , or viceversa , to remove the limitation set by the lo to reach ultimate performances .    </S>",
    "<S> for example , the interrogation interval in the best available optical clocks @xcite is limited to @xmath44 s by the quality of the local oscillator ; this limitation is not fundamental , and our method could increase the interrogation interval and hence the sensitivity in a way at best proportional to the number of coherence preserving interrogations . </S>",
    "<S> los with higher coherence will reduce the number of intermediate operations required to obtain a given clock interrogation interval . </S>",
    "<S> the latter will then be limited by other effects : practically , a first limit is set by the vacuum quality , which can reduce the ensemble coherence via background collisions , but extremely long trapping lifetimes have been already reached for trapped atoms [ 39 ] . </S>",
    "<S> ultimately , with the combination of existing techniques and the method presented in this paper , the 110 mhz excited states lifetime expected for alkaline earth - like atoms could be reached , which motivates the search for transitions with a lower linewidth @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> phase locking the lo to the atomic state preserves classical correlations in time against the decoherence by the local oscillator . </S>",
    "<S> the technique and the related enhancement factor could thus be combined with spin squeezing , which improves the clock sensitivity by introducing quantum correlations between the particles to go below the standard quantum limit @xcite . more generally , </S>",
    "<S> increasing the interrogation time using minimally destructive measurements and feedback on the phase could be applied to other atomic interferometers , such as atomic inertial sensors , where for example the phase of the interrogation lasers could be locked to the phase evolution of matter waves .    in conclusion , using a coherence preserving detection we tracked the phase evolution of an atomic collective superposition , and we reproduced it on a classical replica by introducing feedback to implement a pll . </S>",
    "<S> phase locking a classical oscillator to an atomic superposition state can be a key technology to improve the sensitivity of systems where the atomic phase evolution is used to improve the quality of the classical counterpart , such as in atomic interferometers or frequency combs @xcite , whenever the main decoherence source is determined by the classical subsystem . </S>",
