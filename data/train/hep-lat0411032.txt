    "once upon a time , several blind men from a hindustan village touched different parts of an elephant s body and , judging from their perceptions , quarreled about what the whole creature might look like . in a similar way",
    ", we explore color confinement by isolating different aspects of the phenomenon , and build our limited experience into various model schemes .",
    "the moral from the ancient parable teaches us that it is vitally important to unify all different views before we can appreciate the whole beauty of the beast .",
    "the aspirations of this contribution are more modest .",
    "i will concentrate on common points of two seemingly unrelated pictures of color confinement .",
    "the former assumes that confinement arises due to the condensation of a particular type of topological excitations , so called center vortices ( for a review see @xcite ) , in the qcd vacuum ; while the latter is the gribov - horizon scenario in coulomb gauge , which has been advocated by gribov @xcite and zwanziger @xcite .",
    "i will first briefly introduce the idea of the gribov - horizon scenario , then formulate a simple criterion of confinement for static color charges in coulomb gauge , discuss how the fulfillment of this criterion depends on presence / absence of center vortices , and finally present results for the coulomb energy of a pair of static charges .",
    "i will present a subset of our numerical results , details , as well as some analytic insights on the connections between center vortices and the gribov horizon , can be found in recent publications @xcite .",
    "in coulomb gauge , the hamiltonian of qcd has the following form @xcite : @xmath0 a prominent role in this expression is played by the faddeev  popov operator @xmath1 which enters both the interaction kernel @xmath2 and the jacobian factor @xmath3 @xmath4^{a , b}_{x , y } , \\qquad { \\cal{j}}\\equiv\\det\\left[m(a)\\right].\\ ] ] it is well - known since the seminal paper of gribov @xcite ,",
    "that coulomb - gauge fixing in a non - abelian theory is a difficult problem .",
    "the transversality condition @xmath5 does not fix the gauge completely .",
    "gribov @xcite suggested to restrict integration over configurations to the so - called gribov region ( gr ) , defined as the subspace of transverse gauge fields for which the faddeev  popov operator is positive , and which are therefore local minima of the functional @xmath6=\\int dx\\left[^g \\mathbf{a}^a(x)\\right]^2,\\qquad \\mbox{where}\\qquad{}^ga_i = g^{-1 } a_i g + g^{-1}\\partial_i g.\\ ] ] the boundary of this region is called the gribov horizon .",
    "however , there exist gauge orbits which intersect the gribov region more than once ; the next step @xcite then is to restrict fields to the fundamental modular region ( fmr ) , the set of absolute minima of the functional ( [ functional ] ) .",
    "both the gr and the fmr are bounded in every direction and convex .",
    "the essence of the gribov - horizon confinement scenario can be phrased in a simple way : the dimension of gauge - field configuration space is huge , so it is reasonable to expect that most configurations are located close to its boundary ( the horizon ; in a similar way , the volume measure @xmath7 of a @xmath8-dimensional sphere is peaked at its surface ) .",
    "the interaction kernel @xmath2 , which determines the interaction energy of static color sources , contains the inverse of the faddeev ",
    "popov operator , which is strictly zero on the horizon and near - zero close to the horizon .",
    "a high density of configurations near the horizon can thus lead to a strong enhancement of the coulomb interaction energy , and hopefully cause color confinement .",
    "let us consider a single static color charge , which can be written in coulomb gauge as @xmath9=\\psi^\\alpha(x)\\psi_0[a],\\ ] ] where @xmath10 is the color index for a point charge in color group representation @xmath11 , and @xmath12 is the coulomb - gauge ground state .",
    "the excitation energy of this state , above the ground state , is given by @xmath13 and is proportional to @xmath14 the quantity @xmath15 is the color coulomb self - energy of unscreened color charge and is expected to be both ultraviolet and infrared divergent in a confining theory .",
    "the uv divergence can be regulated by a lattice cut - off , however , the quantity must still be divergent at infinite volume , even after lattice regularization , due to ir effects .    on a lattice , one can express ( [ e ] ) through eigenstates of the faddeev ",
    "popov operator @xmath16 simply as ( assuming that @xmath17 is invertible , i.e.  excluding its zero modes ) @xmath18 and @xmath19 is the lattice 3-volume . in su(2 )",
    "lattice gauge theory , the link variables can be expressed as @xmath20 and the lattice faddeev ",
    "popov operator @xmath21 - \\delta_{x , y-\\hat{k } } b_k(x )     -   \\delta_{y , x-\\hat{k } } b_k(y ) \\right\\}\\\\     & - & \\epsilon^{abc } \\sum_{k } \\left\\ { \\delta_{x , y-\\hat{k } } a^c_k(x ) - \\delta_{y , x-\\hat{k } } a^c_k(y )   \\right\\}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] ( @xmath22 denote lattice sites at fixed time ) is a @xmath23 sparse matrix with @xmath24 linearly independent eigenstates .",
    "if we denote @xmath25 the number of eigenvalues in the range between @xmath26 and @xmath27 , we can introduce , on a large lattice , the density of states @xmath28 . then , as @xmath29 , @xmath30 a ( necessary )",
    "condition for confinement can now be formulated : _ the excitation energy @xmath15 of a static , unscreened color charge is divergent if , at infinite volume ,",
    "it is interesting to check whether the above condition is fulfilled in various ensembles of lattice configurations .",
    "first , at zero - th order in the gauge coupling , the faddeev  popov operator is simply a lattice laplacian and its eigenstates are just plane waves .",
    "one can easily verify that , in this case , @xmath32 the excitation energy is ir finite and the confinement criterion is not met .",
    "one needs some mechanism of enhancement of @xmath33 and @xmath34 in the region of small @xmath26 values .",
    "i  will argue that such an enhancement exists in full lattice configurations , and is provided by center vortices .",
    "center vortices are identified by fixing to an adjoint gauge , and then projecting link variables to the @xmath35 subgroup of su(@xmath36 ) @xcite .",
    "the excitations of the projected theory are known as p - vortices . in the direct maximal center gauge ( dmcg ) in su(2 ) @xcite one fixes to the maximum of @xmath37 \\right\\vert^2,\\ ] ] and center projects by @xmath38.\\ ] ] a lot of evidence has been accumulated that center vortices alone reproduce much of confinement physics , for a review see @xcite .    we have determined the density of states @xmath33 and the mean value of the lattice laplacian @xmath34 in three ensembles of lattice configurations :    1 .",
    "full configurations , @xmath39 , 2 .",
    "`` vortex - only '' configurations , @xmath40\\rbrace$ ] , and 3 .",
    "`` vortex - removed '' configurations , @xmath41 .    [ cols=\"^,<,^ \" , ]     the effect of vortex removal is illustrated in lower lines of data points of figure [ fig6 ] .",
    "removing center vortices also removes the confining property of the color coulomb potential . since the potential , in coulomb gauge , is sensitive to the interaction kernel @xmath2 in the hamiltonian ( [ hamiltonian ] ) , and the kernel in turn to the density of near - zero eigenvalues of the faddeev ",
    "popov operator , this result again confirms the observation of the previous section : removal of center vortices alters the density quite drastically .",
    "we also note that the confining property of the color coulomb potential is tied to the unbroken realization of a remnant global gauge symmetry in coulomb gauge .",
    "this connection was studied in detail in ref .",
    "it was demonstrated there on a few examples ( deconfined phase in pure gauge theory , pseudo - confinement phase of the gauge  fundamental - higgs theory ) that confinement in the color coulomb potential is not identical to confinement in the static interquark potential , and center symmetry breaking , spontaneous or explicit , does not necessarily imply remnant symmetry breaking .",
    "results of our numerical simulations suggest an appealing picture : the low - lying eigenvalues of the faddeev  popov operator in coulomb gauge tend towards zero as the lattice volume increases .",
    "the density of the eigenvalues goes as a small power of @xmath26 , and this , together with a similar behavior of the average laplacian , @xmath34 , assures the infrared divergence of the energy of an unscreened color charge . also , due to the enhancement of near - zero modes of the faddeev ",
    "popov operator , the coulomb energy of a pair of color charges rises linearly with their separation .",
    "both facts support the ideas of the gribov - horizon confinement scenario .",
    "the constant density of low - lying eigenvalues can be attributed to the vortex component of gauge - field configurations . a thermalized configuration in a pure gauge theory factors into a confining piece ( the vortex - only part ) , and a piece which closely resembles the lattice of a gauge  higgs theory in the higgs phase ( the vortex - removed configuration ) .",
    "this establishes a firm connection between the center - vortex picture and the gribov - horizon scenario .",
    "this connection is exemplified also by the fact that vortex removal removes the color coulomb string tension of the color coulomb potential .",
    "it is also consistent with recent investigations of gattnar et al .",
    "@xcite in landau gauge .    in this talk , i covered results of our numerical investigations .",
    "related analytical developments were omitted : ( i ) thin center vortices lie on the gribov horizon ; ( ii ) the gribov horizon is a convex manifold in lattice configuration space and thin center vortices are conical singularities on that manifold ; ( iii ) the coulomb gauge is an attractive fixed point of a more general gauge condition , interpolating between the coulomb and landau gauges .",
