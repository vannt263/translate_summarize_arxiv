    "formation and evolution of galaxies are affected by their environment , particularly when they are embedded in clusters .",
    "we may see such effect strikingly in brightest cluster galaxies ( bcgs ) , which are defined as the brightest galaxies among the member galaxies in a cluster .",
    "the luminosities of bcgs are 10 times larger than those of typical normal field galaxies , and the masses of bcgs are about @xmath2 m@xmath3 , comparable to those of galaxy groups .",
    "bcgs are not drawn from the same luminosity function as other cluster member galaxies , suggesting that they have a distinctive formation history @xcite .    according to @xcite ,",
    "the following three models are proposed to explain the origin of bcgs : ( 1 ) star formation from cooling flows expected in the centers of clusters @xcite ; ( 2 ) galactic cannibalism or the accretion of existing galaxies through dynamical friction and tidal stripping @xcite ; and ( 3 ) galaxy merging in the early history of the formation of clusters @xcite . in the cooling flow model ,",
    "intra - cluster gas gradually condenses at the high density center of clusters and form bcgs , creating a large number of new stars .",
    "therefore , the evolution of bcgs follows that of their host clusters .",
    "we would distinguish the galactic cannibalism model and the galaxy merging model mentioned above by the formation epoch of bcgs . a number of small galaxies existing within an evolved cluster form a bcg in the galactic cannibalism model .",
    "on the other hand , in the galaxy merging model , bcgs are formed during collapse of clusters as expected in hierarchical cosmological models and have earlier origin than their host clusters , contrary to the other two models .",
    "the observational properties of bcgs and their host clusters were studied by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "they found that the optical luminosity of a bcg is positively correlated with the x - ray luminosity and hot gas temperature of its host cluster .",
    "@xcite observed faint envelopes around 27 cd galaxies , and found that the luminosity of a cd envelop is correlated with the x - ray luminosity of its host cluster .",
    "these correlations are evidence of a close connection between a bcg and its host cluster . in this paper",
    ", we explore correlations between observational parameters of bcgs and clusters , using recent x - ray data and focusing on new types of parameters with particular interest on their evolutionary link .",
    "we adopt @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and @xmath6 km s@xmath7 mpc@xmath7 for our study .",
    "besides using observed x - ray parameters of clusters directly , we employ the parameters defined in the fundamental plane of x - ray clusters proposed by @xcite .",
    "they analyzed the relations among the central gas density @xmath8 , the core radius @xmath9 , and the temperature @xmath10 .",
    "these data ( @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 ) lie on a plane ( the fundamental plane ) in three dimensional space .",
    "three axes ( @xmath14,@xmath15 , and @xmath0 ) of the fundamental plane are written as functions of @xmath8 ( @xmath16 g @xmath17 ) , @xmath9 ( mpc ) , and @xmath10 ( kev ) .",
    "the equations of these three parameters are @xmath18 , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 .",
    "the scatter of the @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and @xmath0 are @xmath21 , @xmath22 , and @xmath23 , respectively .",
    "thus , the data distribute on the @xmath24 plane .",
    "we especially focus on the parameter @xmath0 , which is the major axis of data distribution .",
    "@xcite point out that the parameter @xmath0 is regarded as an indicator of cluster age . according to the virial equation",
    ", the relation between the virial mass @xmath25 , the virial radius @xmath26 , and the virial temperature @xmath27 _ at the time of cluster collapse _ is written as @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the mean molecular weight , @xmath30 is the hydrogen mass , @xmath31 is the boltzmann constant , @xmath32 is the gravitational constant , and @xmath33 is a fudge factor , which typically ranges between 1 and 1.5 .",
    "we emphasize that @xmath26 is the virial radius _ when the cluster collapsed_. since clusters continue growing , present @xmath34 is different from @xmath26 . however , if the structure of the core region is preserved during cluster evolution , the typical core radius of a cluster @xmath9 will reflect the @xmath26 as is shown by @xcite .",
    "assuming that the gas temperature @xmath10 and the core radius @xmath9 are proportional to @xmath27 and @xmath26 , respectively , @xmath25 is written as @xmath35 . from @xmath36 , we obtain @xmath37 substituting @xmath9 and @xmath10 written as a function of the fundamental parameters , @xmath38 is described as @xmath39 since @xmath14 has only a small scatter , @xmath38 mainly depends on the parameter @xmath0 .",
    "the virial density of a cluster should be proportional to the critical density of the universe at the epoch when the cluster collapsed in the spherical collapse model .",
    "this is the reason why the parameter @xmath0 is regarded as an indicator of cluster age after the collapse .",
    "we focus on the position of a bcg in a cluster in addition to the optical luminosity of a bcg .",
    "fig.[fig : f1 ] shows the digitized sky survey image of a496 and a3667 .",
    "overlaid contours are _",
    "rosat_/pspc image of 0.12.0 kev band .",
    "the bcg of a496 , which is a typical cd galaxy , mcg@xmath4002 - 12 - 039 , is located at the peak of the x - ray emission . on the other hand ,",
    "the bcg of a3667 is located at some distance from the x - ray peak .",
    "we expect the offset of the bcg from the peak of the cluster x - ray emission to indicate how the cluster is close to the dynamical equilibrium state .",
    "@xcite proposed a classification scheme of clusters , in which clusters are categorized by the presence or absence of a cd galaxy which is giant elliptical galaxy with an extended envelop .",
    "since cd galaxies are usually located at the center of regular , compact clusters , significant fraction of bcgs is classified as cd galaxy .",
    "clusters containing cd galaxies are classified as x - ray dominant ( xd ) ; and those without cd galaxies are classified as non - x - ray dominant ( nxd ) .",
    "the x - ray emissions of xd clusters are strongly peaked on the cd galaxy , while those of nxd clusters are not associated with any individual galaxy .",
    "@xcite argues that this classification represents the state of cluster evolution .",
    "the offset of the bcg from the peak of the cluster x - ray emission might be regarded as a measure for the xd or nxd categorization .",
    "we can evaluate this quantitatively .",
    "note , however , that bcgs are not necessarily cds under our definition .",
    "we selected 61 @xmath41 nearby clusters from the highest x - ray flux galaxy cluster sample ( hiflugcs ) compiled by @xcite , and 27 @xmath42 distant clusters , which are gravitational lensing clusters , from @xcite .",
    "@xcite collected the gas temperatures from the literature .",
    "@xcite determined the gas temperatures from the x - ray spectra obtained with _",
    "asca_. central gas densities and core radii were determined from the _",
    "rosat_/pspc images by @xcite and from the _",
    "rosat_/hri images by @xcite .",
    "they fitted surface brightness profiles with the conventional @xmath43 model , @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the distance from the cluster center and @xmath43 is a fitting parameter .",
    "we determined the position of the x - ray peak by analyzing _",
    "rosat_/pspc data for nearby cluster sample and _ rosat_/hri data for distant cluster sample .",
    "hri images were extracted from screened event files by selecting the pulse height ( pi ) range of 19 ch .",
    "the hri images were binned with bin size of 2@xmath46 and smoothed by a gaussian kernel of @xmath47 816@xmath46 .",
    "the pspc images were extracted for pi range of 12200 ch ( energy range : 0.12.0 kev ) , binned with 4@xmath46 , and smoothed by a gaussian of @xmath48 . the correction for telescope vignetting was not applied to either of the two images .",
    "we define the central position of the image bin with maximum x - ray intensity as the position of the x - ray peak . in some images where bright x - ray point sources are present , we excluded regions around the sources to explore the x - ray peak .    positional uncertainties of the x - ray peak are determined by combining the error due to counting statistics and telescope pointing accuracy . in order to estimate the error due to counting statistics , we divided the original event list for each source into two part and repeated the same procedure , extraction and peak search , as mentioned above .",
    "the difference between the x - ray peak positions determined from two halves can be used as an estimate of the error due to counting statistics .",
    "the average statistical errors @xmath49 are @xmath50 for pspc and @xmath51 for hri . on the other hand ,",
    "aspect errors @xmath52 which are determined by the attitude control of _ rosat _  are estimated from the difference between the position of an x - ray point source in the image , which is optically identified , and the same obtained from an optical data base .",
    "the average aspect errors are @xmath53 for pspc and @xmath54 for hri .",
    "if we take the positional error as @xmath55 , it corresponds to @xmath5618 kpc at the average redshift of nearby cluster sample and @xmath5675 kpc at the average redshift of distant cluster sample .",
    "the position of bcgs were taken from the nasa / ipac extragalactic database ( ned ) .",
    "we identify the bcg as the galaxy whose optical magnitude is the brightest among the cluster members .",
    "the search radius of a bcg is 15@xmath57 from the x - ray peak , which corresponds to 1.2 mpc at the redshift of 0.05 . because the positional error of the bcgs obtained from ned is typically about 0.5@xmath46 , the error of the offset of the bcg from the x - ray peak",
    "is dominated by @xmath49 .    in this paper",
    ", we also see the correlation of the optical b - band magnitude of the bcg to other parameters for 26 nearby clusters .",
    "these b - band magnitudes are taken from `` the third reference catalogue of bright galaxies '' by @xcite .",
    "note that 21 nearby clusters and 5 distant clusters are not included in our analysis because of the lack of positional information of the bcg .",
    "the number of clusters remained are 40 and 22 , for the nearby and the distant samples , respectively .",
    "the average redshifts are 0.05 and 0.3 , and the standard deviations of the redshift distribution are 0.02 and 0.1 for each sample .",
    "we examine the relations between the properties of bcgs and those of their host clusters .",
    "we employ the parameter @xmath0 of the fundamental plane of x - ray clusters and the hot gas temperature to represent properties of cluster hot gas .",
    "the offset from the x - ray peak and the optical absolute magnitude are used to describe the properties of bcgs .",
    "the relations between the offset of the bcg from the x - ray peak and the parameter @xmath0 is shown in fig.[fig : f2 ] . filled squares and open squares represent nearby clusters and distant clusters , respectively .",
    "the offset of the bcg is larger for the smaller @xmath0 .",
    "the correlation coefficient is @xmath58 , @xmath59 , and @xmath60 for nearby , distant , and all clusters , respectively . on the other hand ,",
    "the correlation of the bcg offset to another fundamental plane parameter @xmath15 is weaker , as shown in fig.[fig : f3 ] .",
    "the correlation coefficient is 0.27 , 0.30 and , 0.33 for each data set , respectively .",
    "as mentioned in section 2 , clusters distribute on the y - z plane .",
    "these results imply that z is more important than y when we consider the bcg offset .",
    "that is the second reason for us to focus on the parameter z. we also investigated the correlation of the bcg offset to the observational quantities @xmath8 , @xmath9 , and @xmath10 , obtaining the correlation coefficients of @xmath61 , 0.67 , 0.49 for all the data , respectively . because the parameters of the fundamental plane are the products of these quantities , it is not surprising to get similar level of the correlations to these quantities .",
    "it is noted that the hot gas temperature @xmath10 depends almost only on the parameter @xmath15 ( @xmath62 ) , though we will not employ the parameter @xmath15 in the following subsections .",
    "considering the positional errors of the offset estimated in section 4 , these correlations are not so tight especially for the distant clusters .",
    "however , the offset of the bcg is larger for the smaller @xmath0 cluster . in order to test the significance of this trend",
    ", we divide the sample into two groups ; one is the large @xmath0 clusters ( @xmath63 ) , and the other is the small @xmath0 clusters ( @xmath64 ) .",
    "kolmogorov - smirnov test shows the probability that two groups have the same offset distribution are 0.0010 , 0.023 , and 0.00014 for the nearby , the distant , and all the clusters , respectively .    some of the large @xmath0 clusters in our sample are cooling flow clusters , which are well relaxed and",
    "often show the central excess emission .",
    "we may have to consider the influence of the central cool component on our results .",
    "@xcite examined the nature of clusters , which have the central excess considering the inner cool component in addition to the outer component .",
    "they showed that the inner components also satisfy the same relations of the fundamental plane , though their values of @xmath0 are systematically larger than those of the outer components .",
    "therefore , for some of the large @xmath0 clusters in which the cool component is significant , the value of @xmath0 in fig.[fig : f2 ] may shift to larger @xmath0 side if we consider this component . on the other hand ,",
    "if the cool component reflects a local phenomenon , such as agn activities , the ignorance of the component is justified in our study of the global properties of clusters .",
    "if parameter @xmath0 represents the age of the cluster since its formation , as mentioned in the previous section this correlation indicates the offset of the bcg is smaller in an aged cluster that spends long time after its formation .",
    "if the offset of the bcg reflects deviation from the dynamical equilibrium state of the cluster , as is often assumed , this might be a natural result .",
    "however , it should be noted that the parameter @xmath0 is derived only from the x - ray properties and its interpretation by @xcite is a theoretical one . the negative correlation shown here would be an observational support for their interpretation of the parameter @xmath0 based on galaxy distributions .    in fig.[fig",
    ": f4 ] , we show some images of individual clusters marked in fig.[fig : f2 ] . the clusters ( a ) a754 and",
    "( b ) a2256 are small z clusters .",
    "these are typical irregular clusters , and cluster merging might be undergoing . the cluster ( c ) a3562 and ( d ) a3558 have intermediate @xmath0 value .",
    "the x - ray morphology of these clusters is relatively regular , though some irregularity remains at their central regions .",
    "the clusters ( e ) a2029 and ( f ) ngc5044 are large @xmath0 clusters , and have regular morphology even at the central region , indicating that these cluster are well relaxed system .",
    "we expect that small z clusters can evolve into large z clusters through dynamical relaxation .",
    "the time scale of the evolution is difficult to evaluate , however , we can provide its rough estimate by comparing the crossing time of a cluster galaxy and the offset of the bcg observed .",
    "the crossing time @xmath65 of a cluster galaxy is written as @xmath66 where @xmath45 is the distance from a cluster galaxy to cluster center , @xmath67 is the radial velocity , and @xmath68 is the radial velocity dispersion .",
    "therefore , the evolution time scale of about 1 gyr is implied .",
    "investigation of a large number of distant clusters with _ chandra _  or _ xmm - newton _  might enable us to study whether the offset of the bcg is larger for distant clusters .",
    "we next examine the correlation between the hot gas temperature and the optical magnitude of the bcg .",
    "as mentioned in section 4 , we restrict the data of 26 nearby clusters here . as shown in fig.[fig : f5 ] , it is found that the bcgs are brighter in higher gas temperature clusters with a correlation coefficient of 0.52 . a similar correlation",
    "was found by @xcite , though the scatter of the optical absolute magnitude is 0.35 in their case , smaller than ours ( 0.62 ) .",
    "simple arguments based on virial theorem suggest that the mass of a cluster is simply related to the cluster temperature as @xmath69 .",
    "thus , the correlation shown in fig.[fig : f5 ] implies that the optical magnitude of the bcg may also be correlated with the mass of a cluster .",
    "fig.[fig : f6 ] shows the relation between the optical magnitude of the bcg and the total mass of cluster .",
    "the total mass is the integrated mass within the radius of 5 mpc .",
    "although the correlation is weaker than that to the temperature ( correlation coefficient is 0.43 ) , larger mass clusters are tend to have brighter bcgs .",
    "this suggests that larger bcgs are formed in the clusters that have deeper potential .",
    "note that some authors found the similar correlation between the x - ray luminosity , which is related to the cluster temperature , and the optical magnitude of the bcg ( e.g * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite , however , show that this correlation disappears at @xmath41 , although they use the k - band magnitude of the bcg .",
    "the b - band magnitude is related to the star formation in bcgs .",
    "the correlation between the b - band magnitude and the cluster temperature may suggest another possibility that more stars are formed in the bcg of higher temperature cluster .",
    "we need further investigation for this correlation .      in fig.[fig :",
    "f7 ] , the optical magnitude of the bcg is plotted against the parameter @xmath0 .",
    "there is not a significant correlation between these two parameters .",
    "the correlation coefficient is 0.10 .",
    "the parameter @xmath0 is interpreted as an indicator of cluster age .",
    "thus , this result suggests that the optical magnitude of the bcg is not mainly determined by the age of their host clusters . among the three models on the origin of the bcg mentioned in @xcite , the cooling flow model and the galactic cannibalism model expect that the extreme luminosity of the bcg is mainly governed by the evolution of their host clusters . on the other hand , in the galaxy merging model",
    ", the huge bcg luminosity is determined in the early history of the cluster evolution .",
    "the result here is more favorable to the galaxy merging model than the other two models .      as shown in section 2 , the parameter @xmath0",
    "is closely related to the virial density of a cluster .",
    "we therefore expect similar correlations when we employ the virial density as a parameter instead of parameter @xmath0 . under the assumption that the virial radius and virial temperature are proportional to the core radius and gas temperature ,",
    "we can obtain the virial density from observable quantities . from equation ( 1 ) , and @xmath70 we obtain @xmath71 where @xmath72 and @xmath73 are assumed following @xcite . in fig.[fig : f8 ] , the offset and optical magnitude of the bcg are plotted against the virial density .",
    "the correlation coefficients are -0.54 and 0.06 for the offset and optical magnitude of the bcg , respectively , confirming that the virial density acts similarly as the parameter @xmath0 .",
    "we have investigated the properties of bcgs and their host clusters .",
    "the offset of the bcg from the x - ray peak has a negative correlation to the parameter @xmath0 of the fundamental plane of x - ray clusters .",
    "because the parameter @xmath0 is interpreted as an indicator of cluster age since its collapse , and the offset of the bcg from the cluster center can be regarded as a good measure of deviation from the dynamical equilibrium state of a cluster , this correlation tracks the evolution history of the sample clusters .",
    "furthermore , since the interpretation of the parameter @xmath0 as the cluster age by @xcite is theoretical one regarding the hot gas properties of clusters , the correlation to the offset of the bcg is an observational support to their interpretation .",
    "we also find a correlation between the cluster temperature and the optical magnitude of the bcg for nearby clusters , as was found by @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "there is not a significant correlation among the optical magnitude of the bcg and the parameter @xmath0 .",
    "what do these results imply on the origin of bcgs ?",
    "the offset of the bcg from the x - ray peak surely reflects deviation from the dynamical equilibrium state of the cluster and decreases according to the cluster evolution , which is tracked by the parameter @xmath0 . on the other hand",
    ", the optical luminosity of the bcg does not have significant correlation to the parameter @xmath0 .",
    "these two facts favors the view that the large luminosity of the bcg is determined prior to or during the early history of cluster formation .",
    "if the large luminosity of the bcg is mainly acquired in the course of cluster evolution , we expect some correlation between the optical luminosity of the bcg and the parameter @xmath0 . among the three models mentioned in @xcite , therefore",
    ", the galaxy merging model in the early history of cluster formation is more favorable than the cooling flow model or the galactic cannibalism model .",
    "the cooling flow model implies the formation of new stars , but there is a weak evidence for the star formation by cooling flow @xcite .",
    "furthermore , recent x - ray observations by _ xmm - newton _  showed that the x - ray emission from cooler gas is much lower than expected from standard cooling flow models @xcite .",
    "this might imply that there is a heating mechanism that prevents the icm from radiative cooling . on the other hand , detailed study of the galactic cannibalism model",
    "shows that expected amount of accreted luminosity falls short by an order of magnitude to account for the bcg luminosity , since the dynamical friction time scales of galaxies are too long @xcite .",
    "as demonstrated by @xcite with his n - body simulation of a cluster in a hierarchical cosmological model , central galaxy is formed through the merger of several massive galaxies early in the cluster s history .",
    "if we consider that the total mass of a cluster reflects the initial fluctuation of the universe , it may not be strange that larger bcgs are formed at the bottom of deeper potential of cluster size .",
    "since the significant fractions of bcgs are cd galaxies , the luminosities of cd galaxies should be also determined prior to or during the early history of cluster formation .",
    "however , @xcite suggests that the extended envelop of a cd galaxy is not created by the galaxy merging in the early history of cluster formation .",
    "the envelop might be formed by different process like a tidal stripping .",
    "if bcgs have an earlier origin than their host clusters , we might have a chance to observe a luminous galaxy which was formed before cluster collapse and their host clusters are not formed yet .",
    "@xcite found x - ray overluminous elliptical galaxies ( olegs ) with _ rosat _ , which are luminous galaxies comparable to cd galaxies , but have no detectable galaxies around them .",
    "olegs thus might be a candidate of such pre - bcg galaxies .",
    "although extended envelops are not also detected in olegs , the envelop might be formed when an oleg evolves into a cluster of galaxies .",
