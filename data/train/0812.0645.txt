    "the transfer of a quantum state from one place to another is an important task in quantum information processing .",

    "the anisotropy and magnetic field effects on the entanglement transfer in two parallel heisenberg spin chains was later investigated in ref .",
    "@xcite . for the simple cases where each chain only has two spins",
    ", it was determined that perfect entanglement transfer can be realized between spin pairs by adjusting the magnetic field strength and the anisotropy parameter .    in this paper",
