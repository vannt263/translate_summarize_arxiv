    "the knowledge of the epoch when galaxies formed , that is when they formed the bulk of their stars , is a major cosmological question .",
    "the detection of such primordial galaxies would give constraints on their formation , their chemical evolution or the formation of large scale structures .",
    "all the attempts to detect these galaxies at redshifts @xmath4 by detecting the ly@xmath5 emission line , either by visible and ir spectroscopy ( koo & kron 1980 , schneider et al .",
    "1991 , thompson & djorgovski 1995 ) , narrow band imaging ( de propris et al .",
    "1993 , parkes et al . 1994 ) or perot - fabry ( thompson et al . 1995 ) have failed , while the ly@xmath5 flux of a @xmath6 galaxy , @xmath7  erg  @xmath8  s@xmath9 ( thompson & djorgovski 1995 ) , should have been easily observed with 3.6 m telescopes . only recently , hu ( 1998 ) reported the detection of  emitters at redshifts as high as 4.5 .",
    "however , it is now known that even small amounts of dust can absorb the great majority of the ly@xmath5 photons by resonant scattering ( charlot & fall 1993 ) .",
    "the most promising method to observe these galaxies seems to use the lyman break at 912   .",
    "this break is present in all kinds of galaxies , for all reasonable stellar formation scenarii ( bruzual & charlot 1993 ) , and is observed in the visible range for @xmath10 .",
    "the first very high redshift galaxies have been observed through multi band imaging , with broad filters located on each side of the lyman break at @xmath11 , selected using color criteria , and several of the candidates have recently been spectroscopically confirmed with the keck telescope ( steidel & hamilton 1992,1993 , steidel et al .",
    "1995 , pettini et al .",
    "the average projected density of these objects is expected to be 0.5  gal  arcmin@xmath12 at @xmath13 and @xmath14 ( steidel et al .",
    "1995 ) .    in this paper ,",
    "we present the results of the search for very high redshift galaxies ( @xmath15 ) , using the same technique , but with an original instrumental setup : we have designed multi band filters , with three narrow ( @xmath16   ) bands , placed so that they avoid the most prominent night sky emission lines .",
    "this disposition and the very high transmission ( above 95% ) of the filters compensate the narrowness of the bands , and reduces by a factor of three the amount of data to reduce , as well as telescope observing time .",
    "observations are described in sect .",
    "[ data ] , and our detections are discussed in sect .",
    "we have observed the field # f of the calar alto deep imaging survey ( hippelein et al .",
    "1995 ) , centered at position 13h 47 m 42.1s @xmath17 3735.6(j2000 ) .",
    "the cadis fields have been selected for being empty of bright stars or galaxies .",
    "observations were carried at the eso 3.6 m telescope at la silla between the 2nd and the 5th of april 1997 , with efosc .",
    "the tektronik ccd has a 0.61  pixel size .",
    "we have taken two exposures of the field : one in the standard @xmath18 filter , so that we could locate precisely the objects and measure their magnitude , and one with the 3-band filter , to detect their lyman edge .",
    "the full instrumental setup and properties are described in boulesteix et al .",
    "( 1997 ) . in short",
    ", the three bands have been designed to avoid the most prominent night sky emission lines ( 5700   , 6003   ) , so that the background noise is significantly reduced .",
    "the bandpass of the multi - band filter is shown on the left part of fig .",
    "[ filter ] , while the right part of this figure gives the transmission of the @xmath18 filter .",
    "we both show the transmission of the optical device ( filter + prisms or @xmath18 filter ) , and the curve obtained when including the transmissions of the prisms , the multi - band filter and the broad band filter that is used to avoid transmission outside the desired wavelength range ( due to residual transmission of the multi band filter below 4450     and above 5600   ) , and efosc and ccd efficiencies .",
    "we have checked that the optical device does not induce any distorsion from center to edge of the field , neither in photometry nor in the relative locations of the three images of a given object .",
    "the separation of the images in the 3 bands of our filter , 2.7 , has been calculated to avoid crowding with the closest objects on the sky and is close to the limit resolution of the telescope and seeing .",
    "it assures an almost gaussian image without overlap of the images .",
    "the average projected density of galaxies with apparent magnitude below @xmath19 is given by the integration of the differential magnitude - number counts of field galaxies given by e.g. le  brun et al .",
    "( 1993 ) : @xmath20 in very good agreement with those obtained by metcalfe et al .",
    "( 1991 ) , smail et al .",
    "( 1995 ) or driver et al .",
    "this gives an average distance between galaxies of about 10 .",
    "thus , with the two extreme images separated by 5.8 , we avoid crowding in a large majority of cases .",
    "the flat fields were made by averaging all the exposure in the same filter ( @xmath18 or multi - band ) , and the final image was reconstructed by using the shift - and - add procedure .",
    "the total exposure time is thus 2 hours in the @xmath18 band and 10 hours in the multi - band filter and the final field of view , reduced by vignetting and shift - and - add procedure , is 450square .",
    "detection of the objects on the @xmath18 exposure was carried using the sextractor software ( bertin & arnouts 1996 ) .",
    "thus , knowing the position of all the objects on the field , we have performed aperture magnitude , in a 2  box , of the three images of each object on the 3-band filter exposure , at the expected location of each image .",
    "we have verified on objects for which the three images were detected that our expectation of the location of the images was correct .",
    "photometric and flux calibrations were made in the @xmath18 band using the field ser  1 ( tyson 1988 ) , and the calibration of the multi - band filter exposures was made using the spectrophotometric standard star kopff  27 ( stone 1977 ) .    for our search of very high redshift galaxies , we have selected objects with apparent magnitude in the range @xmath21 .",
    "the lower limit corresponds to objects for which the three images are severely blended ( due to the large pixel size ) , and the upper limit to the limiting magnitude of the @xmath18 image .",
    "thereafter , we have selected , among the 352 objects in this magnitude range , those for which the image quality was good enough to perform photometry of the three images .",
    "we note however that blending of objects with each other was in our case less a crucial problem than the blending between the three images of an individual object due to the large pixel size of the efosc ccd .",
    "we then come up with a list of 88 objects , for which we could perform efficient photometry .",
    "we have thus verified , using kolmogorov - smirnov test , that this selection did not introduce any bias in the spatial distribution of the objects , and in fact neither the abscissa nor ordinate distribution of the selected objects do deviate significantly from an uniform distribution .    among these objects , four show image neither in the intermediate nor in the bluer band , and are thus candidates for being galaxies in the redshift range @xmath22 , and four more show only two images in the two redder bands , thus being potentially at redshifts in the range @xmath1 .",

    "[ cands ] presents the four galaxies candidates at redshifts @xmath52 , both in r band and in the multi - band filter image . for these four objects ,",
    "the flux in the intermediate band is at least 3.7 times smaller than expected , if the flux had a flat distribution .",
    "the main concern in such a photometric study is the possible contamination by lower redshift objects , whose spectra show strong features ( e.g. ellipticals ) , that can produce the same effects that very high redshift galaxies . thus , in the same way as steidel et al .",
    "( 1995 ) , we have simulated the evolutions of the colors of different standard types of galaxies for all redshifts between 0 and 5 .",
    "the results for the colors relevant for the high redshift objects ( namely @xmath53 vs @xmath54 ) are given in fig .",
    "[ col_hz ] .",
    "we have included in the simulations the effect of the absorption by the intergalactic medium ( the so - called forest ) , following the prescription of madau ( 1995 ) , specifically his figure 3 . as can be seen from this figure ,",
    "the universe is transparent above the redshifted wavelength of the  line , and totally opaque below the redshifted lyman limit .",
    "the absorption between these values is very uncertain , due to the statistical fluctuation of the number of absorbers toward a particular sightline .",
    "we thus have performed several simulations with various values and form of the intergalactic absorption .",
    "we show two of them , corresponding to the average and highest transmission curve .",
    "as can be seen , the only effect of a stronger forest absorption is to make all objects redder in @xmath54 , but does not modify by a significant amount the @xmath53 , since both bands are affected in the same proportion .",
    "thus , the value of @xmath53 alone can be used to detect very high redshift galaxy candidates , since a galaxy of any type at lower redshift can not reproduce the observed colors . as well , faint m stars do not have colors compatible with those of high redshift galaxies .",
    "thus , in the hypothesis that these objects are at redshift above 4.5 , objects h1 and h2 are located 3.6  apart from each other ( see upper panel of fig .  [ cands ] ) .",
    "this represents a projected separation of @xmath3  kpc , and we would thus see a close pair of primordial galaxies . we have drawn the galaxy density map in the field .",
    "this is shown on fig .",
    "[ dens ] , together with the location of all our high redshift candidates .",
    "as can be seen , the pair h1/h2 is located on the edge of an overdensity , which is significant at @xmath55 level .",
    "no other high redshift candidate is detected in the same area of the field , due to useless photometry , and they could belong to a very high redshift structure .    in the hypothesis that these objects are at redshifts around 4.6 , and correcting the fact that we considered only 88 objects among the 352 that we detect in the apparent magnitude range @xmath56 $ ] , we come to a projected density of 0.7 object per square arcminute .",
    "this value is very close to the one derived by steidel et al .",
    "( 1995 ) at redshifts around 3.2 , thus involving no strong evolution of the projected density of galaxies between @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "we note however that , due to cosmological evolution , this leads to strong change in the physical density , but that mirales & pello ( 1998 ) have recently shown that the density of high redshft objects could be as high as 50 times higher than the one derived by steidel et al .",
    "( 1995 )      intermediate panel of fig .",
    "[ cands ] shows the images of object l3 , which is likely to be a galaxy with redshift in the range @xmath59 .",
    "again the color - color plot ( @xmath60 vs @xmath54 for this redshift range , fig .",
    "[ col_lz ] ) shows that no lower redshift objects can reproduce the observed colors , and that the @xmath60 value alone can discriminate high redshift objects .",
    "the only possible exception is object l4 , which has colors compatible at slightly more than @xmath61 with lower redshift ellipticals at @xmath62 or @xmath63 .",
    "this experimental setup also has the capability to bring out objects with other kinds of spectral feature , in particular emission lines . in our sample of faint galaxies",
    ", we have found one such object , labeled e1 in table  [ cand ] .",
    "the flux in the intermediate band is about 3 times greater than in other bands ( including the r band ) .",
    "it is thus likely that this object shows a strong emission line in the wavelength range 48555065   .",
    "unfortunately , there is no way to distinguish between the various lines , and this object could either be a emitting object at @xmath64 , or a local dwarf object ( @xmath65 ) at @xmath66 which shows strong oii emission .",
