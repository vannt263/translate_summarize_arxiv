    "x - ray surveys most directly trace accretion onto supermassive black holes and hence provide our best window on black hole evolution . some primary observational goals of x - ray studies include the measurement of supermassive black hole properties ( such as number density and accretion rates ) versus redshift and the determination of the nature of the host galaxies .",
    "since much of the accretion power in the universe may be absorbed by substantial neutral hydrogen column densities ( e.g. , fabian & iwasawa 1999 ) , the challenge is to construct a _",

    "the census is well underway for unobscured sources ( i.e. , quasars with broad emission lines and big blue bumps ) , but the obscured population is not well - characterized , except for the relatively rare radio galaxies .    a fundamental goal of the _ chandra x - ray observatory _ was to resolve the hard ( @xmath12  kev ) x - ray background ( xrb ) into discrete sources . at these energies",

    "2001 ; cowie et al .  2002 ; rosati et al .  2002 ) with the main uncertainty being the normalization of the xrb itself .",
    "the cdf - n exposure has recently been extended to a second megasecond .    although with the _ chandra _ and _ xmm - newton observatories _ there has been rapid improvement in our ability to detect hard x - ray sources at the faintest fluxes , our efforts to understand in detail the nature and evolution of the sources creating the hard xrb are still in the early stages .",

    "the hard to soft x - ray flux ratios of the latter sources suggest that the sources are highly absorbed systems whose high column densities could effectively extinguish the optical , ultraviolet , and nir continua from the agn and render traditional identification techniques ineffective .    based on the colors ,",

    "2001 ) . however , a very intriguing possibility suggested by haiman & loeb ( 1999 ) is that some of the optically faint sources may instead be low luminosity quasars at very high redshifts ( @xmath35 ) , since cold dark matter models can allow a large number of such high - redshift agn .    the @xmath0  ms _ chandra _ exposures have also resolved @xmath36% of the soft ( @xmath13 ) xrb into discrete sources ( b01 ; rosati et al .",

    "the large numbers of detections are understandable since we now have the sensitivity to detect the most luminous ( @xmath38  erg  s@xmath39 ) x - ray binaries and supernova remnants at @xmath40 .",
    "agn may cease to dominate the x - ray number counts at extremely faint fluxes ( e.g. , moran , lehnert , & helfand 1999 ) in a manner analogous to the dominance of star forming galaxies rather than agn at very faint radio fluxes ( e.g. , richards  2000 ) .    in this paper",

    "was created for each night in @xmath4 and @xmath5 and divided by the tessellated surface .",
    "the fringe frame was scaled to the background level in each chip and subtracted to remove the fringing .",
    "next , a separate median flat was generated for each dither pattern to remove flattening variations caused by flexure in the instrument .",

    "stars brighter than 19th magnitude are saturated in most of the science images making comparisons to the usnoa-2 difficult .",

    "this initial solution was applied to the science frames , and stars appearing within @xmath65 of the same position in at least four images were identified .",

    "the solid line is the track expected for a power - law source with varying photon index @xmath175 .",
    "a single photon index can not simultaneously match both the hard and soft x - ray colors , and a strong break from harder to softer spectra is required as the energy increases .",

    "[ fig15 ] that the x - ray colors of the sources are reasonably well - described by this type of model and that most of the sources lie within the @xmath194 to @xmath195 tracks .",
    "the fact that the dashed line in fig .",
    "[ fig15 ] is nearly vertical shows that absorption effects have little consequence above 2  kev but produce significant flux suppressions below 2  kev .    in fig .",

    "nearly all have @xmath196 .",
    "the stars are the softest x - ray sources , as is well - known .",
    "the remaining sources span a wide range of hardness , from very hard to comparable to that of the broad - line agn .",
    "the line - of - sight column densities for these latter sources are only loosely related to the optical spectral characteristics ; this is likely due to different viewing angles for agn leading to different x - ray and optical obscurations .",
    "based on the distribution of the counts ratios of the broad - line agn in fig .",
    "[ fig16 ] , we adopt an intrinsic @xmath16 in the absence of absorption in the subsequent discussion .",
    "we now use the @xmath16 input spectrum to investigate the range of intrinsic column densities @xmath17 ( i.e. , the column densities in the rest - frame of each source ) that produce the absorption . in fig .",
    "[ fig17 ] we plot ( @xmath13  kev counts)/(@xmath12  kev counts ) versus redshift for the @xmath13  kev and @xmath12  kev deep subsamples .",

    "we do not show any curves after compton thickness effects become important . at @xmath15",
    "the sources in the sample appear to be well - described by the @xmath197 curves . at @xmath155",
    "there are only a small number of spectroscopically unidentified sources which potentially could have column densities much in excess of @xmath198 .",
    "such sources may be very optically faint and thus preferentially lack redshifts .    in fig .",
    "[ fig18 ] we plot the deduced intrinsic @xmath17 values for the individual sources in the @xmath12  kev selected bright and deep subsamples with either spectroscopic or photometric redshifts .",

    "as expected , the broad - line agn ( denoted by a second larger symbol ) have comparatively low @xmath17 values .",
    "our description is simple , and we caution that when sources get absorbed by material that is almost or fully compton - thick , other components could take over to determine the spectral shape , including scattering of x - rays around the absorber , multiple lines - of - sight through the absorber , circumnuclear starburst emission , etc . these effects will tend to give more flux at low energies than would be expected from the simple model .",
    "thus , column densities can be underestimated , with the underestimation factor getting larger as the column density gets larger .",
    "consequently , there could still be some compton - thick sources in our sample , even if we do not recognize them as such .",
    "this is an interesting issue , and in the next section we examine whether the xrb _ requires _ contributions from a population of compton - thick sources .",
    "an important question is how much of the very high energy ( @xmath199  kev ) xrb our current sample has resolved , and hence how much light might still be needed from compton - thick sources . in fig .",
    "[ fig19 ] we plot the total xrb contributions from the @xmath12  kev deep subsample ( thick solid line ) , computed for each source assuming an intrinsic @xmath16 power - law together with an optical depth determined from the ( @xmath13  kev)/(@xmath12  kev ) counts ratio .",
    "the dashed ( boldt 1987 ) and dotted ( gruber et al .  1984 ; gruber 1992 ; fabian & barcons 1992 ) lines show the xrb measurements obtained by _ heao - a_. the deep subsample produces about 87% of this background at 3  kev and 57% at 20  kev .",
    "however , if the _ chandra _ data were renormalized at 3  kev to the higher _ asca _ or _ bepposax _ measurements ( the latter , taken from vecchi et al .  1999 , are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig19 ] by the dot - dashed line ) , then the shape of the combined contributions from the _ chandra _ sources matches fairly well that of the observed xrb ( thin solid line ) at both energies .",
    "thus , whether the match to the high energy xrb requires either a substantial population of as - yet undetected compton - thick sources or some change in the spectral shape of the current sources from the simple power - law dependence clearly depends critically on how the low energy and high energy xrb measurements tie together ( see also fabian , wilman , & crawford 2002 for a theoretical discussion ) .      since the translation of observed _ chandra _ counts to flux depends on the assumed spectral shape , the computation of the intrinsic rest - frame x - ray luminosities using the intrinsic @xmath16 spectrum and the inferred rest - frame @xmath17 values requires a recomputation of the b01 fluxes , followed by a correction for the opacity ( which reduces the observed flux ) and a @xmath200 @xmath21-correction .",
    "it turns out that all of these effects are small in the @xmath12  kev band , and the final @xmath12  kev luminosities that we calculate only differ from those which would be computed directly with the b01 fluxes and a zero @xmath21-correction by an average factor of 0.83 with a weak redshift dependence .",
    "this factor is similar to the 0.85 constant factor used by barger et al .",
    "( 2001a ) to empirically correct their @xmath12  kev luminosities for these effects .    in fig .  [ fig20 ]",
    "we show our rest - frame opacity - corrected and @xmath21-corrected @xmath12  kev luminosities versus redshift for the @xmath12  kev bright and deep subsamples with spectroscopic identifications . figure  [ fig20 ] shows very little evolution in the maximum x - ray luminosities with decreasing redshifts until @xmath22 , at which point the volume becomes too small to probe effectively very high luminosity sources .",
    "if there were considerable evolution of the maximum luminosities , as is seen in the optical , then we would not have detected any high luminosity sources at low redshift .",
    "there has been some discussion in the literature about rare finds of high - redshift type ii quasars ( e.g. , norman et al .",
    "2002 ; stern et al .",
    "we note that at @xmath201  erg  s@xmath39 and @xmath202 we also find two such non - broad - line systems , objects 184 and 287 from table  1 , both of which are narrow ly@xmath10 emitters . at @xmath203 we also see two such systems , objects 69 and 280 in table  1 , both of which have [ neiii ] and [ nev ] emission ; 280 also has narrow balmer emission lines .",
    "however , we stress that high - redshift type ii quasars are by no means responsible for producing the bulk of the xrb at these energies ( see   [ seczdist ] ) .",
    "because the optical depth effects are much larger at low energies , the corrections described above depend sensitively on the choice of intrinsic spectrum ; thus , we have not attempted to calculate intrinsic rest - frame @xmath13  kev luminosities . instead , in fig .",

    "1999 ) , so any source more luminous than this is very likely an agn .    below @xmath205  erg  s@xmath39 the sources could be more ` typical ' galaxies whose x - ray emission is dominated by a population of x - ray binaries , hot interstellar gas , or a low - luminosity agn .",
    "we detect 18 low - luminosity sources in the @xmath13 deep subsample , which corresponds to a surface density of @xmath206  deg@xmath68 .",
    "these sources contribute a very small fraction ( approximately 3% ) of the total @xmath13  kev light in the deep subsample and are not a significant contributor to the xrb .",
