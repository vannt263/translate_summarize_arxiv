    "the cold dark matter ( cdm ) paradigm ( cole et al . 2005 and references therein ) has led to a successful explanation of the large - scale structure in the galaxy distribution on scales 0.02 @xmath1 0.15h mpc@xmath2 .",
    "the cdm power spectrum on these scales derived from large redshift surveys such as , for instance , the anglo - australian 2-degree field galaxy redshift survey ( 2dfgrs ) , is also consistent with the lyman-@xmath3 forest data in the redshift range @xmath4 ( croft et al .",
    "2002 ; viel et al .",
    "2003 ; viel , haehnelt & springel 2004 ) .    in spite of these impressive successes ,",
    "there are still discrepancies between simulations and observations on scales @xmath5 1 mpc , extensively discussed in the recent literature .",
    "we may mention the sharp central density cusp predicted by simulations in dark matter halos and confirmed by the rotation curves of low surface brightness galaxies ( de blok et al .",
    "2001 ) or in bright spiral galaxies ( palunas & williams 2000 ; salucci & burkert 2000 ; gentile et al .",
    "moreover , deep surveys ( @xmath6 ) , such as the las campanas infrared survey , hst deep field north and gemini deep deep survey ( gdds ) are revealing an excess of massive early - type galaxies undergoing `` top - down '' assembly with high inferred specific star formation rates relative to predictions of the hierarchical scenario ( glazebrook et al .",
    "2004 ; cimatti , daddi & renzini 2006 ) .",
    "one problem that requires closer examination concerns the large number of sub-@xmath7 subhalos present in simulations but not observed ( kauffmann , white & guiderdoni 1993 ; moore et al . 1999 ; klypin et al .",
    "this is the case of our galaxy or m31 , although there is mounting evidence for a large number of very low mass dwarfs ( belokurov et al .",
    "2006 ) . however , it is still unclear whether the cdm model needs to be modified to include self - interacting ( spergel & steinhardt 2000 ) or warm dark matter ( bode , ostriker & turok 2001 ; coln , avila - reese & valenzuela 2000 ) or whether new physical mechanisms can dispel such discrepancies with the observations .",
    "for instance , gas cooling can be partly prevented by photoionization process which may inhibit star formation in the majority of subhalos ( bullock , kravtsov & weinberg 2001 ) .",
    "this `` missing satellite problem '' remains an ideal framework to test cosmological models . during the past years ,",
    "different methods have been employed in order to study the gravitational potential of groups or clusters of galaxies , for instance through their x - ray lines emission of hot gas in the intra - cluster medium or through lensing considerations . however , while lensing directly probes the mass distribution in those objects , the other methods rely more often than not on strong hypotheses on the dynamical state of the gas and interactions between baryons and dark matter .",
    "for example , the gas is supposed to be in hydrostatical equilibrium in the gravitational potential well created by dark matter halo , while spherical symmetry is assumed . in this paper",
    ", we study the effects induced by substructures on the deflection potential of dark matter halos in the strong lensing regime .",
    "the presence of substructures follows from the capture of small satellites which have not yet been disrupted by tidal forces and/or suggests that the relaxation of halos is not totally finished .",
    "ray - tracing through n - body cosmological simulations suggest that substructures should have a significant impact on the formation of giant arcs . at clusters of galaxies",
    "scales , some results indicate that lensing optical depths can be enhanced ( bartelmann , steinmetz & weiss 1995 ; fedeli et al .",
    "2006 ; horesh et al . 2005 ; meneghetti et al .",
    "2007a ) whereas some other recent studies suggest that the impact on arc occurence frequency should only be mild ( hennawi et al .",
    "2007 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the presence of substructures changes the properties of strongly lensed images to a point that could lead to misleading inferred cluster mass properties if not properly accounted for ( meneghetti et al .",
    "2007b ) . assuming a one - to - one association of cluster subhalos in the mass range @xmath8 and galaxies , natarajan , de lucia & springel ( 2007 ) used weak lensing techniques and found the fraction of mass in such subhalos to account for @xmath9 of the total cluster mass , thus in good agreement with predictions from simulations ( moore et al .",
    "1999 ) .",
    "likewise , at the scales of galaxies , strong lensing events have long been involving multiple quasars for which the impossibility of resolving the size or shape of the lensed images brought the attention toward flux ratios of conjugate images as a probe of subtructures .",
    "depart from flux ratios expectations from a simple elliptically symmetric potential is often interpreted as a signature for local potential perturbations by substructures ( brada et al .",
    "2002 ; dalal & kochanek 2002 ; brada et al .",
    "2004 ; kochanek & dalal 2004 ; amara et al .",
    "it is unclear whether anomalous flux ratios actually probe `` missing satellites '' ( keeton , gaudi & petters 2003 ; mao et al .",
    "2004 ; macci et al .",
    "2006 ) . due to the small source size in the case of lensed qsos , sensitivity to microlensing events due to stars in the lens galaxy",
    "makes the interpretation less obvious .",
    "astrometric perturbations of multiple quasars have also been considered ( chen et al .",
    "2007 ) despite substantial observational limitations .",
    "presumably the best way out would be to consider extended sources like qsos observed in vlbi or lensed galaxies that will be sensitive to a narrower range of scales for the pertubing potential and thus easier to interprete .",
    "new methods for inverting potential corrections that needed on top of a smooth distribution were proposed ( koopmans 2005 ; suyu & blandford 2006 ) but are not guaranteed to converge in all practical cases and seem to depend on the starting smooth distribution .",
    "one interesting alternative approach is to treat all deviations from a circularly symmetrical potential as small perturbations ( alard 2007 , 2008 ) defining the location where multiple extended images will form .",
    "two perturbative fields , @xmath10 and @xmath11 , can then be defined to characterize deflection potential of lenses as a function of the azimuthal angle @xmath12 , near the einstein radius .",
    "they respectively represent the radial and azimuthal derivative of the perturbated potential ( see eq .",
    "( [ equ5 ] ) below ) .",
    "alard ( 2008 ) showed that these two fields have specific properties when one substructure of mass @xmath13 of the total mass is positioned near the critical lines .",
    "for instance , the ratio of their _ angular _ power spectra at harmonic number @xmath14 is nearly @xmath15 .",
    "we will investigate the detailed properties of these perturbative fields by considering more realistic lenses such as dark matter halos extracted from cosmological simulations . in order to control all the free parameters ( mass fraction , and shapes of subtructures for instance ) and to study their relative impact on arc formation",
    ", we will also generate different families of toy halos .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section 2 we present our lensing modelling ; section 3 first sketches the pertubative lens solution and applies it to our simulated lenses for validation against a ray tracing algorithm ; section 4 presents our main results on the statistics of perturbations , while the last section wraps up .",
    "halos formed in cosmological simulations tend to be centrally cuspy ( @xmath16 ) and are generally not spherical , but have an triaxial shape .",
    "the triaxiality of these potential lenses is expected to increase significantly the number of arcs relative to spherical models ( oguri , lee & suto 2003 and references therein ) , and must be taken into account in numerical models .",
    "thus , apart from dark matter halos extracted from cosmological simulations , we consider in this work typical lenses modelled by of a dark matter halo of total mass @xmath17 with a generalized hernquist density profile ( hernquist 1990 ) :    @xmath18    where @xmath19 is the value of the scale radius , @xmath20 a triaxial radius defined by    @xmath21    and @xmath22 and @xmath23 the minor : major and intermediate : major axis ratio respectively .",
    "we decided to use an hernquist profile for practical reasons .",
    "however , for direct comparison with common descriptions of halos from cosmological simulation in the literature , the hernquist profile is related to an nfw profile ( navarro , frenk & white , 1996 ; 1997 ) with the same dark matter mass within the virial radius @xmath24 defines the sphere within which the mean density is equal to 200 times the critical density . ] . moreover",
    ", we also impose that the two profiles are identical in the inner part ( @xmath25 ) which can be achieved by using relation ( 2 ) between @xmath19 and the nfw scale radius @xmath26 in springel , di matteo & hernquist ( 2005 ) . by convention",
    ", we use the concentration parameter @xmath27 in the following to characterize the density profile of our lenses .",
    "for example , for typical lens at a redshift @xmath28 , we use @xmath29 kpc which corresponds to a nfw profile with @xmath30 ( or equivalently @xmath31 kpc , @xmath32 kpc ) and is consistent with values found in previous cosmological n - body simulations at the specific redshift and in the framework a the @xmath33cdm cosmology ( bullock et al . 2001 ; dolag , bartelmann & perrotta 2004 )",
    ".    axis ratios of each lens are randomly determined following shaw et al . 2006 : @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "these values are in good agreement with previous findings from cosmological simulations ( see for instance warren et al .",
    "1992 ; cole & lacey 1996 , kasun & evrad 2005 ) .",
    "finally , it is worth mentioning that each halo is made of @xmath37 particles corresponding to a mass resolution of @xmath38 .",
    "however , we impose a troncation at a radius of value @xmath39 mpc .",
    "numerical n - body simulations show that dark matter halos contain a large number of self - bound substructures , which correspond to about 10 - 20% of their total mass ( moore et al .",
    "1999 ) . in the following ,",
    "the number of substructures n@xmath40 in the mass range @xmath41  @xmath41+@xmath42 is assumed to obey ( moore et al . 1999 ; stoehr et al . 2003 ) @xmath43 the normalization constant @xmath44 is calculated by requiring the total mass in the clumps to be @xmath45 of the halo mass and by assuming subhalos masses in the range @xmath46",
    " @xmath47 m@xmath48 .",
    "the minimum number of particles in the substructures is about @xmath49 , while the more massive ones have @xmath50 particles .",
    "substructures are distributed according to the ( normalized ) probability distribution @xmath51 , where @xmath52 is assumed to have an hernquist profile of concentration @xmath53 , which yields the probability to find a clump at a distance @xmath54 within the volume element @xmath55 . while the abundance of subtructures in halos of different masses has recently been extensively quantified in cosmological simulation",
    "( see for instance vale & ostriker 2004 ; kravtsov et al . 2004 ; van den bosh et al .",
    "2007 ) , their radial distribution is less understood . however , some studies seem to suggest their radial distribution is significantly less concentrated than that of the host halo ( ghigna et al .",
    "1998 , 2000 ; coln et al . 1999 ; springel et al . 2001",
    "; de lucia et al . 2004 ; gao et al . 2004 ; nagai & kravtsov 2005 ; macci et al . 2006 ) . we will use either @xmath56 in good agreement with those past investigations , or @xmath57 for comparison .",
    "the stripping process caused by tidal forces seems to reduce the density of a clump at all radii and , in particular , in the central regions , producing a density profile with a central core ( hayashi et al .",
    "this process was further confirmed by simulations which found that the inner structure of subhalos are better described by density profiles shallower than nfw ( stoehr et al .",
    "however , other simulations seem to indicate that the central regions of clumps are well - represented by power law density profiles , which remain unmodified even after important tidal stripping ( kazantzidis et al . 2004a ) .",
    "this effect may be enhanced when star formation is taken into account since dissipation of the gas ( from radiative cooling process ) and subsequent star formation lead to a steeper dark matter density profile due to adiabatic contraction . to test the importance of these differences from the point of view of arcs formation , we allow for both of these possibilities : we simulate halos with clumps having a central core @xmath58 , where @xmath59 defines a core radius , or a central cusp ( hernquist profile ) and study how our resulting arcs would change from one option to the other .",
    "it is worth mentioning that each subhalo concentration parameter is obtained using relation ( 13 ) in dolag et al .",
    "( 2004 ) within the @xmath33cdm cosmology .",
    "however , to avoid spurious effects due to the lack of resolution , all subhalos represented by less than 200 particles will have a concentration parameter value corresponding to that of an halo made of exactly 200 particles ( i.e @xmath60 ) . for core profiles",
    ", we follow hayashi et al .",
    "( 2003 ) and take a core of size @xmath61 .    finally , recent cosmological simulations suggest that subhalos tend to be more spherical than their host ( pereira et al .",
    "2008 ; knebe et al .",
    "2008 ) and this effect can also be enhanced if halos are formed in simulations with gas cooling ( kazantzidis et al .",
    "moreover , the distribution of the major axes of substructures seems to be anisotropic , the majority of which pointing towards the center of mass of the host ( aubert , pichon & colombi 2004 ; pereira et al .",
    "although shapes and orientations of subhalos provide important constraints on structure formation and evolution , we have not studied their relative influence in this work .",
    "we reasonably think that modelling substructures by either triaxial shapes of spherical shapes wo nt lead to any significant differences in our results .",
    "table 1 summarizes our different samples of lenses . from a statistical point of view , each sample involves one hundred realizations of halos following the above described methodology . lenses are assumed to be at a typical redshift @xmath28 .",
    "they share a common total mass of @xmath62 and are thus described by an hernquist profile of concentration @xmath63 . the sample a represents our reference catalogue in which all halos have no substructure . for each of them ,",
    "we introduce a fraction of subtructures ( @xmath64 ) by removing some background particles so that both the total mass and the density profile of the initial halo are conserved .",
    "these halos are classified in catalogues b and c according the definition of inner density profile ( ip ) of clumps .",
    "for example , each halo from samples b1 and b2 have 15% of substructures with an inner profile represented by a cusp ( hernquist profile ) .",
    "their radial distribution ( rd ) within the halo is left as a free parameter .",
    "we consider two possibilities , @xmath65 as suggested by numerical simulations , and @xmath66 , which is the concentration parameter of the whole halo .",
    "finally , lenses catalogues c1 and c2 have substructures represented by a core profile with @xmath65 and @xmath66 respectively .",
    "in addition , lensing efficiency depends on the relative distance between lenses and sources .",
    "the efficiency of the lens is scaled by the critical density @xmath67 where @xmath68 , @xmath68 and @xmath69 are the angular diameter distances between the observer and the source , between the observer and deflecting lens and between the deflector and the source respectively .",
    "when the surface mass density in the lens exceeds the critical value , multiple imaging occurs . in order to account this effect which , for a given lensing halo , implies a different einstein radius for a different source redshift",
    ", we consider the redshift distribution of sources taken from the cosmos sample of faint galaxies detected in the acs / f814w band ( leauthaud et al .",
    "it is well represented by the following expression @xmath70 with @xmath71 and @xmath72 ( gavazzi et al .",
    "2007 ) .",
    ".samples of lenses ( see details in the text ) .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     in closing , for the sample @xmath73 , mean errors between predicted contours from the perturbative method and ray - tracing solution are @xmath74 , @xmath75 and @xmath76 for isophotes @xmath77 , @xmath78 and @xmath79 respectively .",
    "the structuration of matter on galactic scales remains a privileged framework to test cosmological models .",
    "in particular , the large number of dark matter subhalos predicted by the @xmath33cdm cosmology is still a matter of debate . in this paper , potential signatures of substructures in the strong lensing regime",
    "were considered .",
    "this investigation makes use of the perturbative solution presented by alard ( 2007 , 2008 ) , in which small deviations from the `` perfect ring '' configuration are treated as perturbations . in this framework ,",
    "all informations on the deflection potential are contained in two one - dimensionnal fields , @xmath10 and @xmath11 which are related to the radial expansion of the perturbed aspherical potential .",
    "the analysis of the properties of these two fields via their harmonic decomposition represents a simple and efficient way to track back possible signatures of subtructures . for instance , the perturbative method offer a simple and clear explanation of the multiplicity of the images . as shown in alard ( 2008 ) , the unperturbed image is a long arc for a cusp caustic configuration , but when a substructure is introduced near the arc , this latter is broken in 3 images .",
    "this effect is also illustrated in the present work in the example shown in the figure ( [ fig_s2 ] ) .",
    "basically the breaking of the image and the change in image mutiplicity is due to the perturbative terms introduced by the substructure on the field @xmath11 . in the case of a circular source with radius @xmath80",
    ", the image is broken when @xmath81 .    in this paper",
    ", lenses were modelled either by dark matter halos extracted from cosmological simulations or via toy models .",
    "the advantage of toy models is to reach a higher resolution and to allow us to study the influence of free parameters such as the inner profiles of substructures which are expected to play a central role here .",
    "we have first estimated the accuracy of the perturbative predictions by comparing the mean error between predicted contours images and theoretical ones derived via ray - tracing .",
    "we found that in general , the relative mean error is @xmath13 of the einstein radius ( @xmath82 ) when different impact parameters configurations and different source redshifts are considered .",
    "we also found that both resolution limitation and ray - tracing procedure lead to a systematic error of @xmath83 .",
    "furthermore , although the accuracy of this approach for elliptical lenses is demonstrated in alard ( 2007 ) , we have checked and shown in the present study that the method works for the range of ellipticities derived from realistic 3d dark matter halos .",
    "this implies that the numerical evaluation of the coefficient of the perturbed potential , @xmath84 and @xmath85 at the einstein radius is accurate enough to carry a statistical investigation .",
    "we have generated several mock catalogues of lenses in which all objects have a total mass of @xmath62 and are at redshift @xmath28 .",
    "this value is motivated by comparison with observational surveys , and is close to where the strong lensing efficiency of clusters is the largest for sources @xmath86 ( li et al .",
    "the first catalogue represents our reference sample since all lenses are modelled by dark matter halos without substructures . in the other ones ,",
    "substructures are described by either a cusp profile or a core profile .",
    "their radial distribution is also a free parameter and we have used @xmath87 and @xmath88 .",
    "our statistical investigation involves a monte - carlo draw : the ellipticity of host halos , position of substructures , sources redshift for instance are randomly derived according to specific distributions .",
    "we found that the harmonic power spectra of @xmath84 and @xmath85 tend to develop a tail towards the large harmonics when substructure are accounted for .",
    "this effect is more pronounced when substructures have a cusp profile .",
    "several improvements of the present investigation are envisioned since the ultimate goal of the method is to provide a clear estimate of the amount of substructures in observations .",
    "* statistically , the properties of the cross - power spectrum of @xmath85  and @xmath84  will be instructive .",
    "a clear characterisation of the covariance of these fields observed in fig .",
    "[ fig_champs ] along with the result of alard ( 2008 ) upon which , as high multipole order @xmath14 , about the same power is contained in each of the fields , would allow us to reduce the dimensionality of the problem and perhaps only consider either @xmath84  or @xmath85 . * in this vein",
    ", it remains to be shown to which extent the statistical properties of @xmath84  and @xmath85  can be approximated as gaussian random fields .",
    "if so , the realization of mock giant arcs would be greatly simplified . concerning this point ,",
    "the number of experiments of the present work must be increased to provide a clear diagnostic . *",
    "a natural extension of this work would be to consider more realistic lenses while taking into account the dynamics of substructures inside the host halo , its connection to cosmology via the expected statistical distribution of substructures ( see e.g. pichon & aubert 2006 ) , as well as star formation mechanisms .",
    "indeed , stripping proccesses caused by tidal forces may lead to more complex structures .",
    "for instance , the study of some merger events in the phase - space ( radial velocity versus radial distance ) reveals the formation of structures quite similar to caustics generated in secondary infall models of halo formation ( peirani & de freitas pacheco 2007 ) . on the other hand , cooling processes and subsequent star formation may lead to steeper dark matter profile due to adiabatic contraction .",
    "then , such processes should have an impact in the amplitude of high orders of our study .",
    "* obviously a perturbation of the simple circularly symmetrical case needs not lie in the same lens plane as the main deflecting halo .",
    "uncorrelated halos superposed along the line of sight to the background source may well introduce perturbations on top of substructures belonging to the main halo .",
    "this will contribute to some additional shot noise background in the power spectra of @xmath84  and @xmath85 , which has to be quantified and subtracted off using ray - tracing through large simulated volumes .",
    "this work is beyond the scope of the present analysis .",
    "* on the path to a possible inversion yielding @xmath84  and @xmath85  from observed arcs shapes and locations , several unknowns left on the rhs of eq .",
    "have to be controlled and will need to be fitted for in a non - linear way in order to attempt a reconstruction of fields @xmath84  and @xmath85 .",
    "in addition , we only have considered a simple representation of the background source",
    ". a lumpier background source will translate into a less regular arc with some small scale signature in the observable quantities such as @xmath89 .",
    "however , the replication of these internal fluctuations along the arcs and , possibly , in the counter image , as well as the information contained in the various isophotes could allow us to reconstruct @xmath84 and @xmath85 directly from the observations . in this respect , alard ( 2008 ) provides a general inversion method when two circular sources are considered for instance .    to conclude , the upcoming generation of high spatial resolution instruments dedicated to cosmology ( _ e.g. _  jwst , dune , snap , alma ) will provide us with an unprecedented number of giant arcs at all scales .",
    "the large samples expected will make standard lens modellings untractable and require the development of new methods able to capture the most relevant source of constraints for cosmology . in this respect , the perturbative method we present here may turn out to be a promising research line .",

    "<S> we present a statistical study of the effects induced by substructures on the deflection potential of dark matter halos in the strong lensing regime . </S>",
    "<S> this investigation is based on the pertubative solution around the einstein radius ( alard 2007 ) in which all the information on the deflection potential is specified by only a pair of one - dimensional functions on this ring .    using direct comparison with ray - tracing solutions </S>",
    "<S> , we found that the iso - contours of lensed images predicted by the pertubative solution is reproduced with a mean error on their radial extension of less than @xmath0  in units of the einstein radius , for reasonable substructure masses . </S>",
    "<S> it demonstrates the efficiency of the approximation to track possible signatures of substructures .    </S>",
    "<S> we have evaluated these two fields and studied their properties for different lens configurations modelled either through massive dark matter halos from a cosmological n - body simulation , or via toy models of monte carlo distribution of substructures embedded in a triaxial hernquist potential .    </S>",
    "<S> as expected , the angular power spectra of these two fields tend to have larger values for larger harmonic numbers when substructures are accounted for and they can be approximated by power - laws , whose values are fitted as a function of the profile and the distribution of the substructures .    </S>",
