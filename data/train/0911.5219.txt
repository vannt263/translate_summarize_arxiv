    "the electromagnetic field of a nucleus which is moving at relativistic velocities can be approximated by a flux of quasi - real virtual photons using the weizscker - williams approach  @xcite .",

    "the long - range electromagnetic interactions are separated from the otherwise indistinguishable hadronic interactions by requiring impact parameters  @xmath5 larger than the sum of the nuclear radii  @xmath6 of the beam ions . due to the large lorentz - boosts of the beam particles , it is possible to study photonuclear reactions as well as photon - photon interactions at high energies in upcs  @xcite .",
    "the photoproduction of vector mesons is a typical process in upcs .",

    "the scattering can be described in terms of soft pomeron exchange .",
    "the cross section is strongly enhanced at low transverse momenta @xmath9 of the produced meson , because the @xmath7@xmath8  pair couples coherently to the entire nucleus . for these coherent processes",
    "the cross section depends on the nuclear form factor @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the squared four - momentum transfer to the target nucleus . for larger @xmath12  the @xmath7@xmath8  pairs couple to the individual nucleons within the target nucleus resulting in a smaller cross section which scales approximately with the mass number  @xmath13 modulo corrections for the nuclear absorption of the meson .    because of the intense photon flux in the case of heavy beam ions ,",
    "the photoproduction of vector mesons may be accompanied by coulomb excitation of the beam particles .",

    "they have an acceptance close to unity for the neutrons originating from nuclear dissociation of the beam ions .",
    "the second trigger detector system used to select upc events is the central trigger barrel ( ctb )  @xcite .",
    "it is an array of 240 plastic scintillator slats that surrounds the tpc and provides information about the charged - particle multiplicity .",
    "two basic types of trigger algorithms are used : the `` topology '' trigger requires a low overall charged - particle multiplicity and subdivides the ctb into four azimuthal quadrants .",
    "events with coincident hits in the left and right quadrants are recorded thereby selecting roughly back - to - back pion pairs .",
    "the top and bottom quadrants are used to veto cosmic rays which otherwise could be reconstructed as unlike - sign particle pairs with zero transverse momentum and rapidity .",
    "since there is no requirement on the energy deposit in the zdcs , the `` topology '' data mainly contain exclusively produced vector mesons .",
    "in contrast to this the `` minimum bias '' trigger selects upc events , where both beam ions dissociated by requiring coincident energy deposits in the zdcs in addition to a low total charged - particle multiplicity in the ctb .    in the offline analysis two- and four - prong events",

    "a low overall charged - track multiplicity is required .",

    "there are at least three models that describe the production of @xmath0 mesons in ultra - peripheral collisions : the model of klein and nystrand  ( kn )  @xcite uses the vector dominance model  ( vdm ) for the virtual photon and a classical mechanical approach for the scattering on the target nucleus , based on data from @xmath29 experiments .",

    "the flight path @xmath49 of the produced @xmath3  is much smaller than the impact parameter so that the @xmath3  decays at two well - separated points in space - time .",
    "this means that the amplitudes overlap and interfere only _ after _ the decay and that the interference must involve the @xmath50  final state .",
    "interference is only possible , if the final state wave function is entangled , nonlocal , and not factorizable into individual @xmath51  wave functions .",

    "the deviation of the @xmath11 distribution from the exponential shape due to the interference effect is parameterized by the function @xmath57 which is determined from the ratio of the simulated @xmath11 spectrum with and without interference .",
    "the measured spectral modification parameter of @xmath58% shows that the interference is significant  @xcite , which means that the @xmath50  final state wave function retains amplitudes for all possible @xmath3  decays , long after the decay occurred .",
