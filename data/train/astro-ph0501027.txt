    "in recent years , the advent of improved infrared instrumentation on large , 810 m class , telescopes has opened a window on rest - frame optical observations of high redshift galaxies , and revived interest for this historically well  studied wavelength regime .    the easy access from the ground to the optical emission from local celestial bodies ( stars , hii regions , galaxies , etc . )",
    "has led to the development and definition of a series of tracers of the physical and chemical conditions of these objects .",
    "of immediate relevance for complex systems like galaxies are the nebular emission lines , stellar and interstellar absorption lines , and broad  band features like the 4000    break .",
    "the 4000    break , for instance , is an estimator of a stellar population s mean age ( e.g. , kauffmann et al . 2003 ) , while absorption lines have been widely employed to measure velocity dispersions within the stellar systems . among all optical tracers of physical and chemical conditions",
    ", however , the lion s share goes to the nebular emission lines . the gas ionized by young , massive stars produces optical emission lines from a number of chemical elements , and with a fairly large range of intensities ;",
    "these have been ` calibrated ' to ` measure ' :    * star formation rates ( sfr ; from [ oii ] , h@xmath0 , ... ) ; * gas chemical abundances ( o , n , s , ... ) ; * dust reddening ( e.g. , from the balmer series ) ; * diagnostics of star  formation feedback , and , in general , ionization conditions ( [ oi ] , [ nii ] , [ sii ] , ... ) .",
    "the applicability of any such indicator for investigations at cosmological distances depends on the redshift range under consideration , and the number of lines that can be accessed .",
    "the [ oii](@xmath13727   ) emission line is sufficiently blue to be observable in the optical window up to redshift less or about 1.5 ; however , this line alone ( with no other information at shorter or longer wavelengths ) can only provide a highly uncertain estimate of the distant galaxies sfrs ( see next section , and , e.g. , hammer et  al .",

    "new infrared instruments are providing more leverage , by allowing investigators to access a larger suite of restframe optical emission lines , from [ oii](@xmath13727   ) to [ nii](@xmath16584   ) , up to , for some lines , redshift z@xmath23 .",
    "multiple emission lines from the same cosmological object afford better estimates of dust reddening , gas chemical abundances , etc .",

    "last , but not least , once the james webb space telescope is on orbit , from its vantage point above the atmosphere it will provide an unobstructed view of the earliest galaxies , detecting h@xmath0 up to z@xmath36.5 , and , potentially , as high as z@xmath340 ( depending on sensitivity and whether ionizing objects exist at such high redshifts ) .",
    "redshift z=6.5 corresponds to an epoch when the universe was 6% of its current age ( for a @xmath4cdm cosmology ) .",
    "given that the high  redshift ` frontier ' employs tools derived from the more accessible low ",
    "redshift universe to understand the evolution of galaxies , it is worth revisiting the strengths and limitations of some of these tools , and whether more investigation is needed in some areas .",
    "for instance , recent studies have re - iterated the limitations of the well  known and well  established ` strong line method ' for chemical abundance measurements in metal  rich environments",
    "( garnett et  al .  2004 ) .    in this talk",
    "i concentrate on the sfr indicators accessible in the optical regime , highlighting recent progress in the area ; i connect these optical indicators to those at other wavelengths , suggesting where additional investigation may be needed .",
    "the basic questions that come to mind when using sfr indicators at optical or other wavelengths are : are they consistent with one another ? what level of ` uncertainty ' each of them carries , and what factors produce such uncertainty ?    at optical wavelengths , the two most widely employed sfr tracers are : the balmer lines emission ( h@xmath0 , h@xmath5 , ... ) and the [ oii](@xmath13727   ) doublet line emission . both are measures of ` instantaneous ' star formation , as the gas is excited by the ionizing photons of the short  lived o and early  b stars . the intensity of both balmer and [ oii ] lines is affected by dust extinction  the h@xmath0 less than the bluer h@xmath5 and [ oii ]  , and by changes in the upper end mass of the stellar initial mass function ( imf , which affects the number of ionizing photons available to excite the gas ) .",
    "the intensity of the balmer lines is additionally affected by the stellar absorption of the underlying galaxy stellar population  again the h@xmath0 at a lower level than h@xmath5 .",
    "in contrast , the [ oii ] is affected by the gas metallicity and , potentially , by its ionization conditions ( but , see , kewley et  al .",
    "2004 , who find no such influence for galaxies with o / h@xmath68.5 ) .",

    "gonzalez et  al .",
    "2003 , hopkins 2004 .    combined , the above effects impact sfr estimates from factors of a few to orders of magnitude , depending on the regime where the measurement is performed",
    "this is easily seen in the case of dust extinction .",
    "local starburst galaxies cover a wide range of dust attenuation values ; even uv  selected starbursts can show extinctions as high as a@xmath74.5  mag , with a loose trend for more actively star  forming galaxies to have higher extinctions ( figure  1 , left ; see , also , wang & heckman 1996 , sullivan et  al .",
    "2001 , perez ",
    "gonzalez et  al .",
    "if such a highly extincted galaxy is mistakenly corrected for a lower extinction value , e.g. , a@xmath71  mag ( the value derived for disks , kennicutt 1983 ) , the derived sfr(h@xmath0 ) will underestimate the actual one by a factor of 14 !",
    "how common are such galaxies ? from the h@xmath0 luminosity function of perez  gonzalez et  al .",
    "( 2003 ) , an l@xmath8(h@xmath0 ) galaxy in the local universe has a@xmath923  mag , thus galaxies with heavily extincted ionized gas are not a rarity in our cosmological neighbourhood .",
    "how this translates to higher redshifts is still unclear , although there are suggestions that overall extinctions are decreasing at constant sfr in high - redshift galaxy populations ( adelgerber & steidel 2000 ) .",
    "extinction correlation carries down to the ` quiescent ' star - forming galaxy regime , with a trend that is resemblant of the starburst galaxies one ( figure  1 , right ) .",
    "the fact that more actively star  forming galaxies and regions have , on average , larger dust extinction values is a consequence of the schmidt - kennicutt law ( galaxies / regions with larger gas surface densities show larger specific sfrs , e.g. , kennicutt 1998 ) combined with the mass  metallicity relation ( see , also , tim heckman s contribution to this conference ) .",

    "2002 ; elmegreen , this conference ) .",
    "if variations do exist , they are likely a second  order effect at least for what concerns sfr measurements .",
    "the comparison between sfr(ir ) and sfr(h@xmath0 ) for a sample of local galaxies by kewley et  al .",
    "( 2002 ) supports such statement .",
    "sfr(ir ) is the star formation calculated from the galaxies far  infrared emission , which is due to dust heated mainly by the stellar non  ionizing radiation ( uv , optical , etc . ) .",
    "thus , two different aspects of the stellar bolometric luminosity , the non  ionizing and the ionizing ones , determine sfr(ir ) and sfr(h@xmath0 ) , respectively . the tight agreement between sfr(ir ) and sfr(h@xmath0 ) , within @xmath210% , over 4 orders of magnitude ( kewley et  al .",
    "2002 ) is supportive of a relatively constant upper - end of the imf",
    ".    the impact of the underlying stellar absorption can be quite significant on the balmer emission lines , for two reasons : 1 )  since ew@xmath14(h@xmath0)@xmath3ew@xmath14(h@xmath5 ) , the intrinsically weaker h@xmath5 line emission will be proportionally more ` depressed ' by the underlying absorption than the h@xmath0 , altering measurements of dust reddening ; 2 )  in galaxies where the star formation intensity is proportionally a small fraction of the overall stellar emission , the ew@xmath14(h@xmath0 ) can be a significant fraction of the ew@xmath15(h@xmath0 ) , thus leading to underestimates of the emission fluxes .",
    "measurements of local star  forming galaxy populations indicate values of ew@xmath14(h@xmath0)@xmath236    ( kennicutt 1992 , calzetti et  al .",
    "1994 , charlot et  al .  2002 , rosa - gonzalez et  al .",
    "2002 ) , with the smaller value more commonly applicable to starburst galaxies .",
    "these studies demonstrate that once the effects of dust extinction and underlying stellar absorption are controlled , the h@xmath0 emission is a reliable indicator of instantaneous sfr , and existing calibrations ( kennicutt 1998 ) are sufficiently accurate for most purposes . for sfr([oii ] ) , there are additional effects to consider : the dependence on metallicity and , potentially , on the ionization conditions , but these can be ` calibrated ' in samples of local galaxies ( kewley et  al .",
    "2004 ) or empirical approaches can be adopted ( kennicutt 1998 , rosa - gonzales et  al .",
    "problems arise when only a limited amount of information , e.g. , just one or two adjacent emission lines , is available , as often is the case for samples at cosmological distances . in these cases ,",
    "the unknown dust extinction and underlying stellar absorption corrections can lead to two effects : 1 )  underestimates of the actual sfrs by a factor of a few , up to an order of magnitude , depending on the nature of the sample and the restframe wavelength region investigated ; 2 )  increase in the dispersion of the sfr distribution of the sample by at least a factor of 2 ( rosa  gonzales et  al .",
    "the optical sfr indicators discussed above measure the presence and amount of ionizing stars in galaxies , which are typically short  lived ( t@xmath1610@xmath17  yr ) . some of the other widely used sfr indicators at shorter or longer wavelengths probe star formation over longer timescales , typically 100  myr or longer .",
    "this is the case , for instance , of the restframe uv emission ( where uv is intended here as the stellar emission between 1000    and 3000   ) .",
    "while the uv emission is well correlated with the ionized line emission in starburst galaxies ( and thus both represent reliable tracers of current sfr ) , there is increasing evidence that the uv of quiescent star  forming galaxies traces recent , but not current , star formation , and can not be directly used as an ` instantaneous ' sfr indicator ( kong et  al .  2004 ,",
    "calzetti et  al .",
    "2005 ) .",
    "another popular sfr indicator is the one derived from a galaxy s far infrared emission , sfr(ir ) . as mentioned in the previous section ,",
    "the far infrared emission in a galaxy is from dust heated mainly by the non  ionizing stellar radiation .",
    "one of the standing questions is how much of the ir radiation from a galaxy is contributed by current or recent star formation , and how much by the general stellar radiation field .",
    "the answer to this question can affect the empirical calibration of sfr(ir ) .",
    "addressing some of those questions is one of the purposes of projects like sings ( the spitzer infrared galaxies survey , one of the spitzer legacy projects ; p.i . :",
    "r.  kennicutt ; see j.d .",
    "smith s contribution to this conference ) .",
    "the unprecedented angular resolution afforded by spitzer together with observations at multiple wavelengths of local galaxies is enabling this project to shed light on the merits and problems of common ( and uncommon ) sfr indicators , for use on galaxies at cosmological distances .",
