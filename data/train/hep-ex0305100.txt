    "the babar collaboration has recently reported  @xcite evidence for a new narrow resonance with a mass near 2.32  gev / c@xmath3 , which decays to @xmath19 .",
    "the babar data are consistent with the identification of this state as one of the four lowest - lying members of the @xmath15 system with orbital angular momentum @xmath16 , and provisionally it has been named the @xmath20 meson",
    ". a natural candidate would be the @xmath21 @xmath15 meson with spin - parity @xmath17 , but other possibilities , including exotic states , are not ruled out . in this paper , we report on a search for the @xmath20 meson , as well as other , possibly related states , in data collected with the cleo ii detector in symmetric @xmath1 collisions at the cornell electron storage ring , at center - of - mass energies @xmath22  gev .",
    "the spectroscopy of @xmath23-wave @xmath15 mesons is summarized in ref .",
    "prior to the observation of the @xmath20 , theoretical expectations  @xcite were that : ( 1 ) all four states with @xmath16 are massive enough that their dominant strong decays would be to the isospin - conserving @xmath24 and/or @xmath25 final states , ( 2 ) the singlet and triplet @xmath26 states could mix , and ( 3 ) in the heavy quark limit , the two states with @xmath27 would be narrow while the two with @xmath28 would be broad , where @xmath29 is the sum of the strange quark spin and the orbital angular momentum .",
    "existing experimental evidence  @xcite for the narrow @xmath30 and @xmath31 mesons which decay dominantly to @xmath25 and @xmath24 respectively , and the compatibility of the @xmath31 with the @xmath32 assignment as @xmath33 support this picture .",
    "the observation by babar @xcite of the new state at a mass of 2.32 gev is surprising because : ( 1 ) it is narrow ( with intrinsic width @xmath34mev ) , ( 2 ) it has been observed in the isospin - violating @xmath35 channel , and ( 3 ) its mass ( @xmath36}\\;$]mev / c@xmath3 ) is smaller than most theoretical predictions for a @xmath37 @xmath15 state that could decay via this channel .",
    "however , points ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) would be obvious consequences of the low mass , since the @xmath38 decay modes are not allowed kinematically .",
    "we also note that at least two theoretical calculations  @xcite prior to the @xmath4 observation had suggested that , in the heavy quark limit , the @xmath28 states with @xmath17 and @xmath18 could be thought of as chiral partners of the @xmath39 and @xmath40 mesons , and thus would be relatively light . in one model  @xcite it was proposed that the mass splittings between the @xmath37 and @xmath41 states of heavy flavored mesons could be as small as 338 mev / c@xmath3 , which is near the @xmath42 mass splitting of @xmath43mev / c@xmath3 measured by babar .    since the initial observation , a number of explanations have appeared  @xcite . cahn and jackson  @xcite",
    "apply non - relativistic vector and scalar exchange forces to the constituent quarks .",
    "barnes , close and lipkin  @xcite consider a quark model explanation unlikely and propose a @xmath24 molecular state .",
    "similarly , szczepaniak  @xcite suggests a @xmath44 atom . also going beyond a simple quark model description , van beveren and rupp  @xcite present arguments for a low mass @xmath37 @xmath15 state based on a unitarized meson model , by analogy with members of the light scalar meson nonet .",
    "bali  @xcite reports on lattice qcd calculations that predict signficantly larger @xmath45 meson mass splittings than what has been observed for the @xmath46 splitting .    on the contrary , bardeen , eichten and hill  @xcite couple chiral perturbation theory with a quark model representation in heavy quark effective theory , building on the model described in ref .",
    "they infer that the @xmath20 is indeed the @xmath37 @xmath15 state expected in the quark model , predict the existence of the @xmath18 partner of this state with a @xmath47 mass splitting equal to the @xmath45 mass splitting , and compute the partial widths for decays to allowed final states .",
    "godfrey  @xcite and colangelo and de  fazio  @xcite find that the radiative transistion of the @xmath20 should be significant if it is indeed a @xmath15 state .",
    "the goals of the analysis presented here are to use cleo data to provide independent evidence regarding the existence of the @xmath20 , to shed additional light on its properties , and to search for decays of other new , possibly related states . in particular , we address the following questions .",
    "are the electromagnetic decays @xmath48 or @xmath49 observable in light of the isospin suppression of the strong decay to @xmath50 ?",
    "are other strong decays observable such as @xmath51 , or the isospin - conserving but okubo - zweig - iizuka ( ozi ) suppressed  @xcite decay @xmath52",
    "? if the @xmath20 is the expected @xmath37 @xmath15 state , might the remaining @xmath18 state also be below threshold for decay to @xmath25 , as suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite , and thus be narrow enough to be observable in its decays to @xmath51 , @xmath48 or @xmath53 ?    this article  @xcite is organized as follows . after describing the detector and data set in section  [ s - detector ] ,",
    "we summarize the reconstruction of the @xmath54 decay channel in section  [ s - conf ] , including efforts to understand and exclude contributions from known background processes .",
    "we then report in section  [ s - searches ] on searches for other possible decay channels as described in the preceding paragraph . in section  [ s - observe ] , we report on the appearance of a statistically significant signal in the @xmath2 channel at a mass of 2.463 gev / c@xmath3 , not compatible with a kinematic reflection of the @xmath4 .",
    "we describe a quantitative analysis of the signals in the @xmath55 and @xmath2 channels , leading us to infer the existence of two distinct states . based on this conclusion ,",
    "we discuss the properties of these two states in section  [ s - properties ] , after which we summarize the principal results of the analysis .",
    "the analysis described here is based on 13.5  fb@xmath0 of @xmath1 collision data collected between 1990 and 1998 .",

    "the tracking system was comprised of a six - layer straw tube chamber just outside of a 3.2 cm radius beryllium beam pipe , followed by a 10 layer hexagonal cell drift chamber and a 51 layer square cell drift chamber , immersed in a @xmath56 t magnetic field generated by a superconducting solenoid . in 1995 ,",
    "the beam pipe and straw tubes were replaced by a 2.0 cm radius beam pipe plus three layers of silicon strip detectors each with double - sided readout , and a helium - propane gas mixture replaced the argon - ethane mixture previously used in the main drift chamber .    beyond the tracking system , but within the solenoid ,",
    "were also located a 5 cm thick plastic scintillation counter system for time - of - flight measurement and triggering , and a barrel calorimeter consisting of 6144 tapered csi(tl ) crystals 30 cm in length , arrayed in a projective geometry , with their long axis oriented radially with respect to the @xmath1 interaction point .",
    "an additional 1656 crystals were deployed in two end caps to complete the solid angle coverage .",
    "the excellent energy and angular resolution of the calorimeter is critical for the reconstruction of @xmath57 decays as well as single low - energy photons such as those emitted in the @xmath58 transition .",
    "the search for the @xmath60 was carried out by reconstructing the @xmath19 state , using the @xmath61 channel with @xmath62 .",
    "charge conjugation is implied throughout this article .",
    "pairs of oppositely charged tracks were considered as candidates for the decay products of the @xmath63 if the specific ionization ( @xmath64 ) was measured in the main drift chamber to be within 2.5 standard deviations of the expectation for a kaon , and if the invariant mass of the @xmath65 system was within @xmath66mev / c@xmath3 of the @xmath63 mass . a third track with @xmath64 consistent with the expectation for a pion was combined with the @xmath65 system to form a @xmath67 candidate with mass @xmath68 . to improve resolution",
    "we adjust the momenta of the three particles subject to the constraint that their trajectories intersect at a common point corresponding to the decay point of a @xmath39 meson .",

    "clusters of energy deposition in the calorimeter unassociated with charged particle interactions were identified as potential photon candidates . to be considered as candidates for the photons from @xmath71 decay , clusters with energy greater than 100 mev located in the central region of the calorimeter ( @xmath72 , where @xmath73 is measured with respect to the beam axis ) were selected .",

    "being considered as a photon candidate , we additionally required that the lateral profile of energy deposition in the calorimeter be consistent , at the @xmath77 confidence level , with expectations for photons .",
    "this requirement removes spurious photon candidates that are mainly due to inelastic interactions of charged hadrons or long - lived neutral hadrons .",
    "the peak in the @xmath75 distribution for photon - pairs accompanying a @xmath67 candidate with @xmath78 between 1.9565 and 1.9805 gev / c@xmath3 has @xmath79mev / c@xmath3 in our data , consistent with expectations from the monte carlo simulations . once identified as a @xmath80 candidate , the directions and energies of the two photons are adjusted with a kinematic fit to reconstruct to the known value  @xcite for the @xmath80 mass @xmath81 .    to suppress combinatoric backgrounds",
    ", we further required that the momentum of the @xmath5 candidate be greater than @xmath82gev / c .",

    "the other feature of note in the spectra is the sharp signal from @xmath94  @xcite near the kinematic threshold .",

    "thus , we confirm the existence of a peak in the @xmath87 mass spectrum that can not be explained as reflections from decays of known particles .",
    "our measurements of the mean mass difference and width of the peak are consistent with the values obtained by babar  @xcite for the @xmath4 .",

    "consequently , observation of one or both of these channels would be interesting .",
    "on the other hand , if neither channel is seen , this would not be too surprising since these are electromagnetic decays , and the @xmath87 decay , while isospin violating , is not as severely phase - space suppressed as in the case of the corresponding decay of the @xmath40 where the electromagnetic decay dominates .",
    "the babar data show no evidence for either channel , however no upper limits were reported on the branching ratios for these channels .    with regard to strong decays , the @xmath106 final state",
    "is kinematically allowed and isospin conserving , but would be suppressed by the ozi rule .",
    "this is in contrast to the @xmath87 channel for which one mechanism would be decay to a @xmath39 plus a virtual @xmath109 , with production of the @xmath80 via @xmath109-@xmath80 mixing  @xcite .",
    "however , angular momentum and parity conservation forbid the decay of a @xmath37 state to three pseudoscalars .",
    "thus , observation of the @xmath106 channel would be strong evidence against the interpretation of the @xmath20 as a @xmath37 meson .",
