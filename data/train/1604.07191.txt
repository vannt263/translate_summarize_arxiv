    "we calculate the photon flux in an angular region of @xmath109 ( corresponding to @xmath110 wide channel waveguide ) along an appropriate pairs of signal and idler emission angles .",
    "simulations have been carried out for generation of maximally entangled photon pairs for a pump wavelength of 405 nm , pump beam waist , @xmath105 , signal emission angle , @xmath111 and waveguide parameters as : waveguide length = 10 mm ; depth = @xmath112 .",
    "we optimize the signal wavelength and idler emission angle for slant grating angle , @xmath113 which dictates the conservation of transverse phase matching function of process 1 .",
    "thus the conservation of transverse qpm condition of process 1 for signal wavelength , @xmath114  nm corresponds to @xmath115 .",
    "now , we chose the qpm grating period of first grating = @xmath116 , period of second grating = @xmath117 and slant grating angle , @xmath118 so that the qpm conditions for both the processes can be simultaneously satisfied and the polarization entangled photon pairs appear with maximum probability along the pair of angles ( @xmath119 ) = ( @xmath120 ) corresponding to the pair of wavelengths ( @xmath121 ) = ( 807   nm , 813.02  nm)(see fig .

    ". it can be seen that by changing the pump wavelength to 406 nm entangled photon pairs can be generated with maximum efficiency for the wavelength pair of ( @xmath121 ) = ( 808.92  nm , 815.01  nm ) at a different angle pair of ( @xmath119 ) = ( @xmath122 ) .",
    "thus by using a narrow band wavelength filter at the signal wavelength of 808.92 nm , we can obtain entangled photon pairs at the output with e@xmath1230.96 for a filter bandwidth of 0.1 nm .",
    "it is worth noting here that even by changing the pump wavelength by 1 nm maximally polarization entangled state can still be generated along the different pair of emission angles",
    ".    it may be worth mentioning here that the entangled photons pairs can also be generated for higher emission angles with larger tunability of generated photon pairs by changing the grating periods but at a cost of efficiency of generated photon pairs .",

    "it can be clearly seen from fig .",
    "[ fig:7 ] that the photons are maximally entangled for different pump wavelength at different emissions angles exhibiting the tunability of the design .",
    "it is worth to emphasize here that in the case of channel waveguides , in view of the phase matching condition any change in pump wavelength by as much as 0.1  nm leads to reduction in spdc process and does not lead to generation of maximally entangled photon pairs .",
    "figure  [ fig:8 ] shows a possible implementation of the proposal in integrated optic form . at the end of the planar waveguide section channel waveguides",

    "the output of the channel waveguides can be coupled to optical fibers for further processing .",
    "depending on the pump wavelength different wavelength pairs of entangled signal and idler wavelengths will exit from different pairs of channel waveguides .",
