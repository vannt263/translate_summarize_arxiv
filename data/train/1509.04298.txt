    "computational devices based on the laws of quantum mechanics hold promise to speed up many algorithms known to be hard for classical computers @xcite .",
    "the implementation of a full scale computation with existing technology requires an outstanding ability to maintain quantum coherence ( i.e. isolation from the environment ) without compromising the ability to control the interactions among the qubits in a scalable way . among the most successful paradigms of quantum computation",
    ", there is the `` circuit model '' , where the algorithm is decomposed into an universal set of single- and two - qubit gates @xcite , and , to some extent , the so - called adiabatic quantum computation ( aqc ) @xcite where the output of the algorithm is encoded in the ground state of an interacting many - qubit hamiltonian .",
    "a different approach @xcite is based on the use of always - on interactions , naturally occurring between physical qubits , to accomplish the computation .",
    "compared to the circuit model , this scheme has the advantage of requiring minimal external control and avoiding the continuous switch off and on of the interactions between all but two qubits ; while compared to aqc it has the advantage of being faster , being based on the non - equilibrium evolution of the system . quantum computation with",
    "always - on interactions is accomplished by combining the natural couplings with a moderate external control , e.g. with a smooth shifting of zeeman energies @xcite , via feedforward techniques @xcite , using measurement based computation @xcite or quantum control @xcite .",
    "most of these approaches are based on the assumption that the natural couplings are fixed by nature and not tunable , while local interactions can be modulated with external fields .",
    "however , the amount of external control required can be minimized if the couplings between the qubits can be statically tuned @xcite , e.g. during the creation of the quantum device .",
    "the recent advances in the fabrication of superconducting quantum devices has opened up to the realization of interacting quantum networks . in a superconducting device ,",
    "the qubits are built with a josephson tunnel element , an inductance and a capacitor @xcite , while local operations and measurements are performed by coupling the qubit to a resonator @xcite .",
    "the interactions can be designed using lithographic techniques by jointly coupling two qubits via a capacitor @xcite or an inductance @xcite , and can be modeled via an effective two - body hamiltonian @xmath0 @xcite , where @xmath1 are the pauli matrices . because of the flexibility in wiring the pairwise interactions among the qubits , it is possible to arrange them in a planar graph structure , namely a collection of vertices and links , where the vertices correspond to the qubits and the links correspond to the 2-body interactions between them .",
    "moreover , thanks to the development of three - dimensional superconducting circuits @xcite , it may be possible in the near future to wire also non - planar configurations , namely a general qubit _",
    "network_.    motivated by the above arguments , we consider the question whether it is possible to encode a quantum algorithm into the unmodulated dynamics of a suitably large quantum network of pairwise interacting qubits .",
    "this would be extremely interesting , as it would enable quantum computation by simply `` waiting '' , without the need of continuously applying external control pulses or measurements .",
    "even when sequential operations can not be avoided , our scheme can enable the _ in - hardware _        implementation of recurring multi - qubit operations of a quantum algorithm ( see e.g. fig.[fig : circuit ] ) , such as quantum arithmetic operations @xcite , and possibly also the quantum fourier transform or error correcting codes @xcite .",
    "we focus on two - body interactions , since they are the most common in physical setups , and we consider an enlarged network where auxiliary qubits enrich the quantum dynamics .",
    "the important question analyzed in this paper is the following : given a target unitary operation @xmath2 on a given set of qubits @xmath3 , we consider an extended network @xmath4 where @xmath5 is a set of auxiliary qubits ( _ ancillae _ ) , and we ask whether it is possible to engineer the pairwise interactions in @xmath4 , modeled by the time - independent hamiltonian @xmath6 , such that @xmath7 after some time @xmath8 ( @xmath9 may be an extra unitary operation on the auxiliary space ) .",
