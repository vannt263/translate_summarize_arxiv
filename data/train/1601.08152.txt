    "since lawson @xcite constructed closed embedded minimal surfaces of arbitrary genus in the round three - dimensional sphere , many ingenious ways of producing an abundance of closed embedded minimal hypersurfaces in general riemannian manifolds have been discovered .",
    "+ a few remarkable examples show how powerful and diverse these methods can be .",
    "while hsiang and lawson @xcite have found all homogeneous minimal hypersurfaces of the round spheres in all dimensions , hsiang @xcite ( and hsiang - sterling @xcite ) discovered infinitely many embedded non - totally geodesic hyperspheres in round spheres of certain dimensions ( in particular , in four dimensions ) .",
    "kapouleas showed how to construct closed embedded minimal surfaces in three - manifolds with a generic metric by gluing and desingularization methods ( see @xcite for a survey of these methods ) . based on a min - max theory for the area functional developed by almgren",
    ", pitts @xcite and schoen and simon @xcite proved that every @xmath0-dimensional closed riemannian manifold contains at least one embedded minimal hypersurface ( containing possibly a singular set of codimension seven ) .",
    "the basic idea is to apply the min - max variational approach to one - parameter families of sweep - outs of the ambient manifold by closed hypersurfaces .",
    "more recently , by using @xmath1-parameters sweep - outs , marques and neves @xcite proved that under the assumption of positiveness of the ricci curvature , these ambient spaces contain in fact infinitely many embedded minimal hypersurfaces ( which are , as in the previous result , smooth in low dimensions ) .",
    "a broad overview of these methods and of many of their intriguing applications are provided in the icm lectures by marques @xcite and , with more emphasis on mix - max techniques , by neves @xcite .",
    "+ a different task is to understand the geometric and topological properties of this variety of examples . for instance , the construction by kapouleas - yang @xcite yields sequences of minimal surfaces with uniformly bounded area and unbounded genus .",
    "simon and smith @xcite ( see also colding and de lellis @xcite ) have proven that their min - max method applied to sweep - outs of the three dimensional sphere , endowed with an arbitrary riemannian metric , by one - parameter families of two dimensional spheres produces an embedded minimal two - sphere . still in three dimensions",
    ", ketover @xcite proved that the genus of the min - max surface is controlled in an effective way by the genus of the surfaces in the sweep - outs ( see also the previous work by de lellis and pellandini @xcite ) . + more generally , one could be interested in understanding the general properties of the set of embedded minimal hypersurfaces in a given manifold .",
    "for example , it has been shown by choi and schoen @xcite that in an ambient three - manifold with positive ricci curvature , the set of all embedded minimal surfaces with genus bounded by a fixed constant is compact in the strongest sense .",
    "+ in addition to the most basic topological and geometric properties of closed minimal hypersurfaces , there is an important analytic quantity , the ( morse ) index .",
    "roughly speaking , the index of a minimal hypersurface counts the maximal number of directions the hypersurface can be deformed in such way that its volume is decreased .",
    "in many situations , the index of a minimal hypersurface controls its topology and geometry .",
    "the following examples are good illustrations of this phenomenon .",
    "schoen and yau @xcite proved that an embedded closed orientable stable (= index zero ) minimal surface in an orientable three - manifold with positive scalar curvature is necessarily a two - sphere . in these ambient manifolds , chodosh , ketover and mximo @xcite",
    "have recently proved that the set of closed embedded minimal surfaces with bounded index can not contain sequences of surfaces with unbounded area or genus ( see also the work of the second - named author for the case of bumpy metrics @xcite ) .",
    "going beyond three - dimensions , the compactness result of the third - named author @xcite ( and later extended in the joint paper @xcite ) is key in proving that , when the ambient @xmath0-manifold has positive ricci curvature and @xmath2 , the set of closed embedded minimal hypersurfaces with a fixed bound on their index and volume contains only finitely many diffeomorphism types ( more general results have been recently obtained by buzano and the third - named author @xcite , see also @xcite ) .",
    "there are even cases where closed minimal hypersurfaces can be classified by their index : urbano @xcite proved that the only embedded minimal surfaces of the three - sphere that have index at most five are the totally geodesic equators and the clifford tori .",
    "this contribution turned out to be crucial in the proof of the willmore conjecture by marques and neves @xcite .",
    "in fact , it is expected that the index of a hypersurface obtained by min - max methods is bounded from above by the number of parameters of the family of sweep - outs considered and , under extra assumptions , is equal to such number . a significant contribution to this conjecture",
    "has been very recently presented in @xcite .",
    "as the above examples show , this type of results provide a very important tool to understand the min - max hypersurfaces , especially in higher dimensions .",
    "+ in this article , we shall be concerned with the general problem of comparing two different `` measures of complexity '' of a minimal hypersurface inside a positively curved riemannian manifold . in this respect",
    ", it has been conjectured that the index controls the basic topological invariants of minimal hypersurfaces in an effective way .",
    "[ indconj][schoen , marques - neves@xcite ] let @xmath3 be a closed riemannian manifold with positive ricci curvature .",
    "there exists a positive constant @xmath4 such that , for every closed embedded minimal hypersurface @xmath5 , the following inequality holds @xmath6    in fact , we expect a similar conclusion to hold , under the very same assumptions on the ambient manifold , not only for @xmath7 but for all betti numbers of @xmath5 , namely we expect the morse index of @xmath5 to be bounded from below by a positive constant times the sum of the betti numbers of the hypersurface in question .",
    "however , we remark that this assertion is actually _ equivalent _ to the aforementioned conjecture unless the dimension of the ambient manifold is greater or equal than five .",
    "notice that some positiveness assumption on the curvature is essential , as the manifolds @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is an orientable surface of arbitrary genus @xmath10 with a metric of constant gaussian curvature @xmath11 , have non - positive sectional curvature and contain stable minimal surfaces of genus @xmath12 . +",
    "a particular example of an ambient manifold for which this conjecture has been already verified is the round sphere @xmath13 ( of arbitrary dimension ) .",
    "the result is due to savo ( see @xcite and theorem [ thmsavo ] below )",
    ". roughly speaking , savo s approach to the problem was to use each harmonic one - form on a minimal hypersurface @xmath5 to produce a set of functions that generate variations that decrease the area of the hypersurface ( in mean ) .",
    "then it was argued that if the index of @xmath5 were too small compared to its first betti number (= dimension of the space of harmonic one - forms , by hodge s theorem ) , one would reach a contradiction .",
    "+ savo s work was preceded by the work of ros ( see @xcite and references therein for partially similar contributions ) . considering flat three dimensional tori",
    ", ros observed that , when a harmonic one - form on a closed minimal surface is viewed as a vector field of @xmath14 along the surface , its coordinates have the behaviour described above .",
    "in particular , he proved that the index of such surfaces is bounded from below by an affine function ( whose coefficients do not depend on the particular surface ) of their first betti numbers ( see theorem 16 in @xcite ) . in @xcite ,",
    "urbano used essentially the same method to prove the analogous result for closed minimal surfaces inside the product of the unit circle with a two - dimensional sphere of radius greater or equal than one .",
    "+ the aim of the present paper is to extend this approach to other positively curved ambient manifolds , and to give a unified method to address the above conjecture within this framework .",
    "we work in the most general setting : given an ambient manifold @xmath3 that lies isometrically inside some euclidean space @xmath15 ( for some @xmath16 big enough ) and a minimal embedded hypersurface @xmath5 inside of it , we consider two kinds of test functions constructed from a harmonic one - form on @xmath5 , both inspired by the works of ros and savo , both dependent on the specific isometric embedding of the ambient manifold in the euclidean space ( see proposition [ propomega ] and proposition [ propomegan ] in section 3 ) .",
    "in particular , we obtain the following result .",
    "[ thma ] let @xmath3 be a riemannian manifold that is isometrically embedded in some euclidean space @xmath15 .",
    "let @xmath17 be a closed embedded minimal hypersurface of @xmath3 . + assume that for every non - zero vector field @xmath18 on @xmath5 , @xmath19 dm\\\\          > \\int_{m } \\left[(|ii(\\cdot , x)|^2 -|ii(x , n)|^2 ) + ( |ii(\\cdot , n)|^2-|ii(n , n)^2|)|x|^2\\right]dm           \\end{gathered}\\ ] ] where @xmath20 denotes the riemann curvature tensor of @xmath21 , @xmath22 denotes the second fundamental form of @xmath21 in @xmath15 and @xmath23 is a local unit normal vector field on @xmath5 .",
    "+ then @xmath24    see sections 2 and 3 for more details , and also for the precise geometric meaning of the inequality . + specializing the above result , we were able to check that the conjecture quoted above is true in a number of ambient spaces .",
    "in particular , we prove the conjecture for the projective spaces @xmath25 endowed with their standard metrics . together with the round sphere , these spaces comprise all compact rank one symmetric spaces , i.e. , all compact symmetric spaces with positive sectional curvature ( see @xcite ) .",
    "any closed , embedded minimal hypersurface of a compact rank one symmetric space is such that its first betti number is bounded from above by a constant times its index .",
    "the constant depends only on the dimension of the ambient manifold .",
    "as we shall see in subsection [ subs : rankone ] proving the index conjecture for @xmath26 turns out to be rather subtle , as one needs to handle ( in fact : to rule out ) the borderline case when equality holds in .",
    "this requires a delicate _ ad hoc _ argument , which is presented in appendix [ app : borderline ] .",
    "+ going beyond highly symmetric examples and the positive ricci curvature assumption , we also verified that the same control of the first betti number by the index also holds for minimal surfaces in sufficiently pinched convex hypersurfaces of the euclidean spaces ( theorem [ thmellip ] ) , in three - manifolds that satisfy a pinching condition for the scalar curvature ( theorem [ thmpinch3 ] ) and in the product of circles with spheres of any dimension ( theorem [ thmprod ] ) .",
    "in fact , our methods also allow to prove the index estimate for products of spheres @xmath27 unless both factors have dimension equal to two ( theorem [ thmspheres ] ) .",
    "+ furthermore , we would like to point out that when @xmath28 and @xmath29 , the area estimate of choi - wang @xcite and choi - schoen @xcite coupled with our upper bound on the first betti number yields an effective affine area bound on any minimal surface in @xmath30 solely in terms of the index .",
    "+ we conclude this introduction with a few remarks .",
    "firstly , we observe that if the pinching condition in proposition [ propmain ] holds for certain ambient manifolds @xmath3 in @xmath15 , then it will also hold , possibly with a slightly larger @xmath31 , for small @xmath32 perturbations of @xmath3 in @xmath33 , @xmath34 .",
    "this in particular shows that the method is flexible enough to deal with isometric embeddings that are definitely not `` rigid '' nor very symmetric , which seems to be a new and peculiar feature of our approach . secondly , although the methods used in this paper indicate that , under certain curvature conditions of the ambient manifold , the topology of a minimal hypersurface contributes to its index , the converse is not true .",
    "for example , the infinitely many embedded minimal three - spheres in the round four - sphere discovered by hsiang have uniformly bounded area but their indexes are not uniformly bounded ( this fact can be seen as consequence of the the third - named author s compactness theorem @xcite , see @xcite for further discussion and generalizations ) . finally , the case of the complex projective space ( see theorem [ thm : compl ] ) has special interest , since it shows that our results are somehow peculiar to the codimension one scenario as there are plenty of algebraic curves of any genus in the complex projective space that are area - minimising .",

    "<S> by extending and generalising previous work by ros and savo , we describe a method to show that in certain positively curved ambient manifolds the morse index of every closed minimal hypersurface is bounded from below by a linear function of its first betti number . </S>",
    "<S> the technique is flexible enough to prove that such a relation between the index and the topology of minimal hypersurfaces holds , for example , on all compact rank one symmetric spaces , on products of the circle with spheres of arbitrary dimension and on suitably pinched submanifolds of the euclidean spaces . </S>",
    "<S> these results confirm a general conjecture due to schoen and marques - neves for a wide class of ambient spaces . </S>"
