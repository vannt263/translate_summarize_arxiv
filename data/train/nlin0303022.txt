    "synchronization plays an important role both for understanding of cooperative behavior in natural networks of oscillators  @xcite and for various engineering applications  @xcite . recently a significant interest in understanding and theoretical description of synchronization regimes among the oscillators with chaotic behavior is perceived , see for example recent books and reviews  @xcite .",
    "various types of chaos synchrony , whose description may require different theoretical frameworks , were found in natural systems and specified . these types of synchrony include identical synchronization  @xcite , generalized synchronization  @xcite and phase synchronization  @xcite .",
    "the framework of generalized synchronization was proposed as an attempt to extend the classical theory of forced synchronization of a periodic oscillator , initiated by the works of van der pol  @xcite , andronov and witt  @xcite , to the case of directionally coupled chaotic oscillators .",
    "this framework defines synchronization as the onset of conditional stability of a chaotically driven oscillator , and as the existence of a functional relation that maps the chaotic trajectory of driving oscillator into the trajectory of driven oscillator  @xcite . in the case of invertible dynamics of driving system",
    "such functional relation is usually substituted with a function that maps the state of driving system into the state of response one when these states are measured simultaneously .",
    "rigorous mathematical results indicate that , depending on the strength of conditional stability , the synchronization function can be differentiable or non - differentiable  @xcite . in many experimental studies researcher needs to establish the fact of chaos synchronization when direct analysis of conditional stability is hardly possible .",
    "in such a situation the detection of generalized chaos synchrony characterized by a non - differentiable function , which due to dense wrinkles , cusps and finite number of points appears as a thick and fuzzy set , may seem to be impossible  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we show that detectability of the non - differentiable synchrony can be significantly improved and become feasible if one explores synchronization function taking into account additional points on sufficiently long intervals of the driving trajectory preceding to the current state .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec2 ]",
    "we discuss the idea of such detectability and evaluate the improvement using numerical analysis of a simple example .",
    "section  [ sec3 ] develops a theoretical arguments explaining the mechanism behind the detectability improvement .",
    "section  [ sec4 ] discusses possible effects caused by small additive noise in the data .",
    "summary of the results and possible applications are discussed in the conclusion .",
    "to illustrate the idea of detectability enhancement we first consider an example of a drive - response system which was proposed and studied in  @xcite . in this example generalized baker map",
    "@xmath0    @xmath1    where @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and @xmath4 , drives a system of the form    @xmath5    here parameter @xmath6 defines the properties of the response behavior . consider the systems dynamics within the parameter interval @xmath7 . in this case response system ( [ mapy ] ) is conditionally stable .",
    "the dynamics of driving system ( 1 ) is invertible and according to the theory ( see , for example  @xcite ) there exists a continuous function @xmath8 , where @xmath9 . due to the specific form of the driving and response systems function @xmath10 , in our case ,",
    "is independent of @xmath11 . indeed , given the value of @xmath12 all previous values of this variable can be found from equation ( [ mapx1 ] ) , when one iterates this one - dimensional map backward in time , and these values are independent of @xmath11 . therefore , function @xmath10 can be plotted as a graph in the variables plane @xmath13 .",
    "the example of non - differentiable function @xmath10 computed with @xmath14 is shown in fig .",
    "it is clear from the shape of the function that , in practical situation with a similar function , the existence of the function can not be revealed from such a plot because the states of response system measured for nearby states of driving system can be very disperse .",
    "this situation can make one to believe that the onset of non - differentiable generalized synchronization is practically undetectable .",
    "the statements on such practical undetectability are usually made when one analyses only relation between simultaneous states in the attractors of driving and response systems .",
    "one may ask a question if additional information about the chaotic trajectory can help to resolve the complexity of this functional relation ? and if the answer is yes , what properties of the non - differentiable function can be improved ?",
    "computed with @xmath14.,width=283 ]    to illustrate positive answer to the first question we adopt the approach developed in  @xcite and consider the additional information about the driving chaotic trajectory @xmath15 using its symbolic description .",
    "now we define the state of the driving system as the value of @xmath16 and the symbolic sequence @xmath17 $ ] generated in the next consecutive iterations towards @xmath18 . in the considered example symbols @xmath19 can be easily defined from the evolution of variable @xmath20 . if @xmath21 , then @xmath22 . if @xmath23 , then @xmath24 . from the data generated by the maps ( 1 ) , ( [ mapy ] ) we can examine synchronization function in a new form",
    "@xmath25 which is defined as a mapping @xmath26,x^{(1)}_{n - m } ) \\rightarrow y_n$ ] .",
    "in order to illustrate the improvement of the modified synchronization function @xmath25 with the increase of @xmath27 we plot @xmath28 versus @xmath26,x^{(1)}_{n - m})$ ] for two fixed symbolic sequences that differ by two most recent symbols .",
    "the cases of @xmath29 and @xmath30 are presented in fig .",

    "we studied how the complex image of synchronized attractors in the space of a drive - response system converges to a `` good '' simple function with the increase of @xmath27 .",
    "we analyzed the sets of attractor points conditioned by all possible symbolic masks @xmath31 of various lengths @xmath27 .",
    "for each mask of preceding symbols @xmath32 $ ] we computed the best polynomial fitting function @xmath33 of order 30 using singular value decomposition ( svd ) algorithm , and studied the dependence of mean squared error ( @xmath34 ) , averaged over all masks of length @xmath27 , on the value of @xmath27 .",
    "this dependence computed for four different values of @xmath6 is shown in fig .",

    "[ fig3 ] that @xmath34 decreases exponentially fast when @xmath27 increases . approximating this dependence with exponential , @xmath35",
    "one can find the rate of convergence @xmath36 .",
    "figure  [ fig4 ] shows how the convergence rate @xmath36 evolves with the change of parameter value @xmath6 .",
    "the absolute value of @xmath36 decreases as the value of @xmath6 grows .",
    "this indicates that for higher values of @xmath6 the synchronization function becomes more complex  @xcite and its detection with a given resolution requires more information on the driving trajectory then for lower values of @xmath6 .     on the length @xmath27 of the preceding masks @xmath37.,width=283 ]",
    "one can easily check that when @xmath38 , the conditional dynamics of response system ( [ mapy ] ) approaches the threshold of instability and , as the result , synchronization terminates and function @xmath10 disappears .",
    "the plot of @xmath36 vs @xmath6 reflects this fact and one can see from fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] that convergence rate @xmath36 tends to zero as @xmath38 .",
    "it can be shown that the linear dependence of @xmath36 on @xmath39 is due to the fact that the response system in this example is a linear system and @xmath40 is the contraction rate of its phase volume .     on the value of coupling parameter",
    "@xmath6 plotted in the logarithmic scale.,width=283 ]    to get a better view on the function improvement , examine how additional symbolic information collected along the driving trajectory changes the shape of the whole synchronization function .",
    "one way of taking such symbolic information into account is to compute the integer value out of binary symbolic mask @xmath37 and , then , supplement this integer with the fractional value given by @xmath16 .",
    "note that in our case @xmath41 .",
    "computing the integer part we assume that the most resent symbol @xmath42 of mask @xmath37 is the most significant bit . as the result",
    "we obtain the decimal values of the form @xmath43 .",
    "every decimal value is considered as a new argument of the modified synchronization function @xmath25 .",
    "figure  [ fig5 ] presents such a function plotted for three different values of @xmath27 .",
    "one can see that for large @xmath27 ( @xmath44 ) , the overall shape and complexity of the function remains about the same , but the interval of the argument increases in size by factor @xmath45 .",
    "this indicates that there exists some kind of self - similarity of the non - differentiable synchronization function , and the enhanced detectability is the result of more precise evaluation of the state of the driving system .",
    "it is important to note that the precision of the state evaluation increases with @xmath27 despite the fact the values of variable @xmath46 are measured with the same precision as before .",
    "plotted versus a new variable @xmath47 that contains symbolic information about the driving trajectory .",

    "the example considered above clearly indicates that the functional relation between the synchronized system becomes more apparent when length of driving trajectory taken for the analysis increases . in order to examine which properties of the non - differentiable function change and simplify the detection of the functional relation we present the following theoretical analysis .",
    "in this section we shall concentrate on systems with a unidirectional coupling ( or systems with a skew product structure ) of the form : @xmath49 these equations determine a map @xmath50 generating a dynamical system . the first subsystem is called the driving system , the second subsystem is called the response system and @xmath51 is a parameter that controls the coupling strength .",
    "the fact of synchronization in this systems means that there is a region of parameter values @xmath51 in which , for any initial conditions @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 where @xmath55 ( @xmath56 ) .",
    "loosely speaking , this means that , for any initial conditions , the distance between the states of the slave subsystem goes to zero with time .",
    "we assume for the sake of definiteness , that in the system ( [ definition ] ) one has @xmath57 and @xmath58 , and that @xmath59 is continuous and @xmath60 is a homeomorphism .",
    "since we study dissipative systems we also assume that there exists a ball of dissipation @xmath61 , i.e. @xmath62 for any @xmath63 , where @xmath64 is a region in @xmath51-space ( in which the system ( [ definition ] ) exhibits synchronization ) . without loss of generality",
    "we assume that @xmath65 , i.e. @xmath66 is a rectangle , where @xmath67 ( resp .",
    "@xmath68 ) is a ball in x - space ( resp .",
    "y - space ) .",
    "denote by @xmath69 the maximal attractor in @xmath66 , i.e. @xmath70 .    through this section we shall assume that one - to - one globally stable generalized synchronization occurs in @xmath66 , i.e. the condition ( [ distgoestozero ] ) satisfy when @xmath52 and @xmath53 are arbitrary points in @xmath66 .",
    "it was shown in  @xcite that under these conditions there is a continuous functional dependence between @xmath71 and @xmath72components of orbits while the system is in synchronized region . to obtain more detailed characteristics about this functional dependence",
    "we need an additional assumption .",
    "assume that @xmath73 .",
    "of course the parameter @xmath6 is a function of @xmath51 . for the sake of simplicity",
    ", we assume that @xmath74 . thus , @xmath75 it follows that @xmath76 , @xmath77 .",
    "let us draw the attention on the fact that the smaller @xmath51 is , the greater the coupling strength .    assumption ( [ ms3 ] ) implies that @xmath78 goes to zero exponentially fast , and this fact allows one to prove that function @xmath79 is hlder continuous provided that the functions @xmath60 and @xmath59 have good smooth properties , or at least they are lipschitz - continuous .",
    "so we assume that : @xmath80 . here",

    "our goal is to understand what happens if one tries to study the dependence between the @xmath72coordinate of the orbit at iteration @xmath94 and the @xmath71coordinate at the moment @xmath95 , for @xmath96 . in other words",

    "given the backward orbit @xmath114 , the dynamics on @xmath93 is defined by the sequence of operators @xmath115 acting on @xmath93 .",

    "one can write @xmath145 let @xmath146",
    ". then  ( [ eq6 ] ) implies @xmath147 thus , if @xmath148 is small enough then @xmath119 is large enough because of  ( [ set ] ) .",
    "therefore , @xmath149 , @xmath150 , and the statement of theorem  [ theorm2 ] holds .",
    "@xmath151    hence , we have shown that while the hlder exponent remains the same as for @xmath152 , the hlder constant @xmath153 given by formula ( [ m - constant ] ) can be as small as we wish provided that points on the graph of the function @xmath10 are close enough . in the numerical example presented in sec .",
    "[ sec2 ] the closeness of driving trajectories was achieved by selecting the trajectories with the same symbolic sequence @xmath154 .",
    "the studies presented in sections  [ sec2 ] and  [ sec3 ] deal with the detectability issues of non - differentiable ( wrinkled ) synchronization function when data , acquired from drive and response system , are not contaminated by noise . in a realistic situation external noise is always present in the data .",
    "taking into account the complexity of fine structure typical for wrinkled synchronization functions one may expect that even a very small noise in the data ruins the detectability of synchronization .",
    "we studied the noise impact using the numerical example considered in section  [ sec2 ] .",
    "we examined how the convergence of wrinkled function @xmath25 to a polynomial function is effected by external noise .",
    "the behavior of synchronized systems can be influenced by a noise in many different ways .",
    "for example , stochastic forces , applied to response and/or drive system , destroy the functional relation between the systems independently of the complexity of the function shape .",
    "the level of destruction in this case will significantly depend upon the dynamical properties of the coupled systems .    to be specific",
    "we will examine only the case when the synchronization function exists , but the data representing this function are contaminated with a noise added to the measurements .",
    "namely , when one deals with the data @xmath155 and @xmath156 , where @xmath12 and @xmath28 are generated by equations ( 1),([mapy ] ) , and the independent noisy components @xmath157 and @xmath158 are white gaussian noise with variances @xmath159 and @xmath160 , respectively . in the numerical analysis we will also assume that symbolic sequences of driving trajectory are detected correctly .",
    "we found that @xmath157 and @xmath158 influence the convergence properties differently . to illustrate it , consider , first , the cases when only one source of noise in present .",
    "figure  [ fig6 ] shows the effect of noise occurred in the measurements of the response system ( @xmath161 and @xmath162 ) for different values of variance @xmath160 .     on the mask length",
    "@xmath27 computed for @xmath14 and four different values of variance @xmath160 of the noise added to @xmath28 data.,width=283 ]    noise of this type sets a limit on the precision of the function resolution , see fig .",
    "the numerical analysis shows that the limit is @xmath163 .",
    "this result is quite predictable .",
    "indeed , noise in the response system destroys the function by scattering points along @xmath72-variable and makes a thick object ( a fuzzy layer)instead of the graph @xmath25 .",
    "the thickness of the layer is characterized by the level of noise , namely by @xmath160 .",
    "it is clear that , the size of the thickness ( along @xmath72- variable ) does not change under the transformations applied to the data representing driving trajectory . since our method is not designed to locate the function inside this fuzzy layer , we can not expect the accuracy ( in terms of @xmath164 ) be better than @xmath160 .     on @xmath27",
    "computed for @xmath14 and four different values of variance @xmath159 of the noise added to @xmath12 data.,width=283 ]    when noise occur in the measurements of driving variable ( @xmath165 and @xmath166 ) the conversion process has a different dynamics , see fig .",
    "now the graph of the function in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] is transformed into a thick layer due to scattering of data points along variable @xmath71 .",
    "however , as it follows from fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] that thickness does not limit the precision of function evaluation .",
    "this effect can be understood from the considerations presented in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] and fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] . indeed , the increase of trajectory length in the analysis of the function is equivalent to rescaling of the function argument , while the overall shape of the function does not change , see fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] . while the interval of the argument values increases with the trajectory length as @xmath45 the @xmath71-size of the think layer remains unchange . as the result",
    "the increase of @xmath27 , in this case , improves the precision function detection .     on the trajectory length @xmath27 computed for three different n.,width=283 ]    the effects induced by additive noise in the data is summarized in fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] where the dependence of @xmath34 versus @xmath27 is shown for three different situation of noise ( @xmath161 , @xmath162 ) , ( @xmath165 , @xmath166 ) and ( @xmath165 , @xmath162 ) .",
    "these plots are computed for the coupling strength @xmath14 .",
    "the results indicate that if the level of noise in the data is small a non - differentiable function is detectable with some accuracy limited by the noise variance .    in this analysis we assumed that symbolic sequence representing the driving trajectory",
    "is detected correctly .",
    "we expect that when the symbolic sequence contains errors , then , the function can be severely damaged and , the improvement of function detection can fail .",
    "we believe that the use of a noise reduction technique on the data before the computation of @xmath34 versus @xmath27 plots can be very beneficial in this case .",
    "a simple numerical example and rigorous theoretical analysis show that , despite complex shapes of non - differentiable synchronization functions , the existence of such a function can be detectable in practical situation .",
    "this can be achieved by considering this function not as a function of the current state of driving system , but as a function of the state , in which the driving system has been a few steps ago .",
    "thanks to the contracting properties caused the dissipation in the driving system the nearby trajectories disperse far away from each other in the previous times .",
    "this effect can be used as a `` magnifying glass '' in the detection of non - differentiable synchronization function that contains multiple wrinkles and cusps .",
    "it is shown that , although the `` magnified '' function in this analysis remains non - differentiable , the amplitude of these wrinkles and cusps gets smaller as the delay increases .",
    "the results presented in this paper are in agreement with the recent study on detecting of generalized synchrony made by he , zheng and stone  @xcite . their study based on a different technique that involves the analysis of drive and response trajectories in the embedded phase spaces and takes into account @xmath167 preimages for each trajectory point .",
    "the use of the preimages in this case also acts as a `` magnifying glass '' in detecting of the wrinkled synchronization function .    in the example considered in section  [ sec2 ] ,",
    "the synchronization function depends only on the @xmath46variable , which is the coordinate that always represents a stable direction in @xmath168 .",
    "stable and unstable direction in the @xmath168-space in this driving system are fixed and do not dependent on @xmath168 .",
    "therefore , the differential of this map is a constant matrix . in a more general situation , this is not the case , and the synchronization function must depend on both `` stable '' and `` unstable '' coordinates .",
    "nevertheless , it is possible to understand ( although it is not so simple to prove ) that the dependence on the unstable coordinate is non - essential in the hyperbolic situations .",
    "the simplest way to be convinced is to remember that for hyperbolic attractor there exists a local hlder - continuous change of variables such that in new variables the stable and unstable directions are along the coordinate lines ( planes ) and the situation becomes very similar to the example considered .",
    "we examined the influence of external noise on the function improvement .",
    "we found that noise in the data acquired from the response system sets a limit for the accuracy of the function approximation and , as the result , after some critical value of @xmath27 the further increase of delay becomes useless .    to conclude we would like to emphasize that , although we apply our study to the theory of chaos synchronization , the data analysis method and theory developed here can be useful for other applications .",
    "such applications include prediction of chaotic dynamical behavior in time and space and other studies associated with various types of prediction . the use of hybrid , `` continuous - symbolic '' representation of the chaotic trajectories enables one to take into account additional information about the trajectory in a compact way .",
