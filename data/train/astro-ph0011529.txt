    "the halo mass for a quasar of luminosity @xmath46 is found by equating the observed number of quasars brighter than @xmath46 to @xmath47 , where @xmath48 is the fraction of halos hosting active quasars . because of the exponential shape of the eps mass function for rare halos , our inferred halo mass depends only logarithmically on @xmath48 , and we conservatively adopt @xmath49 . in the case of sdss 1044 - 0125 , one bright quasar was found within a @xmath50 deg@xmath51 survey area at redshift @xmath52 ; from this we infer @xmath53 , with a corresponding velocity dispersion of @xmath54 .",
    "it is interesting that the values of @xmath28 and @xmath55 we obtain for sdss 1044 - 0125 are in good agreement with their relation measured in local galaxies ( gebhardt et al .",

    "note that we adopt the most optimistic assumptions regarding the bh growth ; in reality the growth of each seed bh may be limited by its fuel reservoir .",
    "also , the central bhs may not get incorporated into a single supermassive bh during galaxy mergers ( hut & rees 1992 ) ; however , for exponential growth , the final bh mass tends to be dominated anyway by the first seed to have formed .    in summary ,",
    "our model for the assembly of bhs has four free parameters : @xmath58 , @xmath56 , @xmath68 , and @xmath37 .",
    "although the values of these parameters are apriori uncertain , their `` natural '' choices are as follows : ( i ) if the seed bhs are the remnants of massive stars , then their characteristic mass is @xmath69 ; ( ii ) a necessary requirement for star  formation is efficient cooling ; in a metal  poor primordial gas with no @xmath70 molecules , this implies a minimum virial temperature of @xmath71k for progenitor halos with seed bhs , corresponding to a minimum velocity dispersion @xmath72 ; ( iii ) if the gas accretes to a non  rotating bh through a steady thin disk , then the radiative efficiency , @xmath73 ; and ( iv ) for high fueling rates bright quasars would naturally shine close to their limiting luminosity , implying @xmath74 .",

    ", the number of progenitors increases , peaking at @xmath79 , and then decreasing again as the typical progenitors are broken up into halos with @xmath80 .",
    "the top right panel shows the contribution of progenitors from each redshift to the final bh mass , and demonstrates that the bulk of the bh mass is contributed by seeds from @xmath81 .",
    "this redshift is considerably higher than the peak at which most progenitors form . the increased time available between higher redshifts and @xmath0 ( shown explicitly in the bottom right panel )",
    "makes the contribution from the first few progenitors dominant .",
    "next , we search for general combinations of @xmath56 , @xmath68 , @xmath37 , and @xmath58 that yield the required bh mass for the sdss quasar .",
    "we solve equation  ( [ eq : mbh ] ) with its left hand side set to @xmath82 , and the halo mass set to @xmath83 at @xmath0 , as discussed above . for a given pair of @xmath84 , we then find @xmath37 as a function of @xmath68 by a newton  rhapson method .",

    "the high value applies if the limiting mass for a progenitor halo is determined by feedback from the uv background following the reionization epoch ( thoul & weinberg 1996 ; navarro & steinmetz 1997 ; haiman , madau & loeb 1999 ) ; and the low value applies before reionization if sufficient @xmath70 exists to allow cooling in small halos ( haiman , abel & rees 2000 ) .",
    "the long  dashed curve demonstrates the effect of increasing the typical seed mass to @xmath88 , corresponding to remnants of very massive metal - free population iii stars ( vmos ; bond , arnett & carr 1984 ; see also schneider et al .",
    "the dot  short  dashed curve describes the case where the observed emission from sdss 1044 - 0125 is beamed into a tenth of its sky , so that its true bh mass is reduced by a factor of 10 and the halo abundance is increased by the same factor . finally , the dot  long  dashed curve shows results for the fiducial model in the case of the exceptionally bright @xmath89 quasar pss1347 + 4956 .",
    "we have searched through the list of known @xmath7 quasars and found this object ( bh mass of @xmath90 , and a host halo mass of @xmath91 ( @xmath92 , assuming no beaming or lensing ) to provide the second strongest constraint after sdss 1044 - 0125 .",
    "a handful of other bright @xmath7 quasars follow closely behind .",
    "figure  [ fig : known ] leads to two interesting conclusions .",
    "first , the set of rather standard values , @xmath93 , @xmath76 , @xmath94 , and @xmath95 , yields the required bh mass of sdss 1044 - 1215 .",
    "the corresponding progenitor halos have cooling times much shorter than the dynamical time , and could withstand photo - ionization heating by the intergalactic uv background ( e.g. thoul & weinberg 1996 ; navarro & steinmetz 1997 ) . in such halos",
    "there is no obvious obstacle to the formation of massive stars , which could leave behind the required @xmath96 seed bhs .",
    "second , the inferred values of @xmath37 are relatively high , suggesting that bhs must radiate close to their eddington limit .",
    "lower values of @xmath37 are allowed if @xmath97 ; however , such low values of @xmath68 would not account for the total energy output of quasars given the observed mass density of their remnants ( e.g. ho & kormendy 2000 ; salucci et al .",
    "1999 ; fabian 2000 ) .",
    "the radiative efficiency may in fact approach a value as high as @xmath98 for a maximally rotating kerr bh .      in anticipation of future results from the sdss survey as well as from deeper surveys of high@xmath29 quasars ,",
    "we ask : _ what is the highest plausible value of @xmath28 that should be anticipated for a quasar around a redshift @xmath29 in a given area on the sky ? _ to answer this question , we compute the mass of the central bh in the most massive dark halo that could be found in a representative survey area of 10 deg@xmath51 and redshift bin @xmath99 around different redshifts . for our set of fiducial parameter values",
    "we take @xmath93 , @xmath100 , @xmath101 , and @xmath95 . in figure",
    "[ fig : future ] , the solid curve in the lower panel shows the maximum allowed quasar bh mass in this model as a function of redshift . in the upper panel ,",
    "we show the corresponding apparent @xmath102 magnitude with the corresponding k  correction ( elvis et al . 1994 ) . in our fiducial model ,",
    "equation  ( [ eq : mbh ] ) leads to an unphysically large bh mass , in excess of the observed halo mass . in figure",
    "[ fig : future ] we do not allow the bh mass to exceed @xmath103 .",
    "this additional constraint appears as the break occurring at @xmath79 ; bhs below this redshift are assumed conservatively to have consumed _ all _ the available gas in their host halo .",
    "figure  [ fig : future ] also shows the maximum allowed bh mass and the corresponding minimum apparent magnitude , in variants of our fiducial model : examples in which @xmath58 is either increased to @xmath104 or decreased to @xmath105 ( dotted and short  dashed curves ) , and a model in which the typical seed mass is increased to @xmath88 ( long  dashed curves ) .",
    "long  dashed curves show the results when we allow bhs to consume only 1% of the available gas in its host halo . finally , the dot  short  dashed curves that bracket our fiducial model assume survey areas of 0.1 deg@xmath51 and 1000 deg@xmath51 .",
    "we find that the survey area enters only logarithmically into our constraints .",
    "however , the allowed bh mass and the resulting apparent magnitude , are strong functions of redshift . at its planned sensitivity , the _ next generation space telescope ( ngst ) _ will have a detection threshold of @xmath10632 mag in the @xmath107 m range ( with @xmath108 hours of integration and s / n=10 ) .",
    "the assumed survey size of 0.1 deg@xmath51 can be covered by 23 images taken by _",
    "ngst _ in a total observation time of 2.3 days .",
    "the proposed _ prime _ survey plans to map an area of @xmath109 deg@xmath51 to @xmath110 . at a limiting magnitude of @xmath111 , future surveys can yield strong constraints on the growth of supermassive black holes , as they can map out the `` brightest quasar '' envelope shown in figure  [ fig : future ] out to @xmath112 .",
    "existing data on high - redshift quasars implies that bhs as massive as @xmath113 were assembled when the universe was only a tenth of its present age .",
    "figure 2 shows that the massive bh inferred for sdss 1044 - 0125 at @xmath0 can grow in hierarchical galaxy formation models with plausible parameter values for the initial seed mass ( @xmath96 ) , the minimum velocity dispersion of collapsed objects that harbor such a seed ( @xmath114 ) , the radiative efficiency ( @xmath115 ) , and the luminosity in eddington units ( @xmath116 ) .",
    "figure 3 illustrates the upper envelope of plausible luminosity values for high - redshift quasars that might be found in future surveys .",
    "there are several caveats to the constraints we derived .",
    "first , beaming or lensing may affect the apparent magnitude of some of the brightest and highest redshift quasars ( barkana & loeb 2000b ) .",
    "second , we have assumed that @xmath37 and @xmath68 maintain the same values during the luminous quasar phase and the main growth phase of the bh mass .",
    "it is possible , however , that @xmath68 is negligibly small during the early growth phase of the bh , and high during the luminous quasar phase ( e.g. haehnelt & rees 1993 ) .",
    "this would be equivalent to a corresponding increase in the seed bh mass in our model .",
    "multiple seeds per halo which eventually coalesce are also equivalent to a single massive seed with the sum of their masses . finally , although a recent cosmological simulation finds good agreement with the press ",
    "schechter mass function for the lowest halo masses of interest here at @xmath117 ( jang - condell & hernquist 2000 ) ; the accuracy of this ansatz still remains to be tested over a wider range of redshifts and halo masses , where there might be systematic deviations ( jenkins et al .",
    "2000 ; sheth & tormen 2000 ) .",
    "recently , various modifications to the standard @xmath38cdm model have been proposed because of a potential conflict between theory and observations on small spatial scales ( e.g. , kamionkowski & liddle 2000 ; bode , ostriker & turok 2000 ; barkana , haiman & ostriker 2000 , and references therein ) .",
    "our constraints are expected to tighten significantly in such models , since they generically reduce small scale power and thus eliminate potential hosts of seed bhs at high redshifts .",
