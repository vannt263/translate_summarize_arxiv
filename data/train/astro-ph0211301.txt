    "the agn unified model proposes that seyfert 2 ( s2 ) galaxies are basically the same class of object as seyfert 1 ( s1 ) galaxies but viewed from a different direction .",
    "direct evidence supporting this picture came from spectropolarimetric observations that showed broad , polarized permitted lines in many s2s , indicating that the broad - line region ( blr ) characteristic of s1 is obscured from direct view , visible only in reflected light .",
    "many other s2s , however , failed to show any signs of broad emission lines in their polarized flux spectra , suggesting that either the blr could not exist , or other extranuclear factors ( obscuration , starburst , geometry ... ) had rendered the polarization signals too weak to be detectable .",
    "we carried out a large spectropolarimetric survey of s2s from the cfa and 12@xmath0 m samples to identify those s2s with and without hblrs .",
    "to illustrate their similarities and differences , we compared various observational properties among the hblr , non - hblr s2s and s1s .",
    "properties examined included indicators of agn strength , such as [ o iii ] @xmath15007 , hard x - ray ( 2 - 10 kev ) , radio ( 20 cm ) , and mid - infrared ( 25 @xmath0 m ) luminosities , and various probes of obscuration , such as the balmer decrement , x - ray column density , hard x - ray to [ o iii ] flux ratio , and fe k@xmath2 equivalent width .",
    "we also compared their far - infrared luminosity , which is a good tracer of star forming activity .",
    "our analysis showed the following : i ) by various measures , the obscuration of hblr and non - hblr s2s appears to be the same .",
    "ii ) star formation appears to be similar for all 3 seyfert types .",
    "iii ) not only are hblr s2s stronger than non - hblr s2s , they are comparable in a lot of ways to s1s .",
    "iv ) non - hblr s2 properties , on the other hand , generally do not match well with those of hblr s2s or s1s .",
    "these results imply that : i ) hblrs are visible largely because their agns are intrinsically more powerful , not because of lower obscuration or reduced host starlight contamination , and ii ) non - hblr s2s maybe too weak to represent real hidden s1s , and hblr s2s may be the only true counterparts to normal s1s ."

    "<S> based on the analysis of a large spectropolarimetric survey of seyfert 2 galaxies ( s2s ) from the cfa and 12@xmath0 m samples conducted mostly at lick and palomar observatories , it is shown that s2s with hidden blr ( hblrs ) are intrinsically more powerful than non - hblr s2s . </S>",
    "<S> the positive detection of blr in hblr s2s appears to be due largely to the intrinsic strength of the hidden agn nucleus rather than the lower level of nuclear obscuration or reduced dominance of circumnuclear starburst . </S>",
    "<S> the hblr s2s , on average , share many similar large - scale characteristics with seyfert 1 galaxies ( s1s ) , as would be expected if the unified model is correct , while the non - hblr s2s generally do not . </S>",
    "<S> these results strongly suggest that not all s2s are intrinsically similar in nature , and the hblr s2s may be the only true counterparts to normal s1s . </S>"
