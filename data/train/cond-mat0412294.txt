    "electrorheological ( er ) fluids  @xcite have received much attention due to the potential application of the rapid field - induced aggregation  @xcite and the large anisotropy  @xcite , and they are actually a suspension in which the induced dipole moment can order the suspended polarizable particles into columns under the application of a strong electric field .",
    "tao and jiang examined the temporal evolution of three - dimensional structure in er fluids by using a computer simulation  @xcite . for a wide range of the ratio of the brownian force to the dipolar force ,",
    "the er fluid was found  @xcite to have a rapid chain formation followed by aggregation of chains into thick columns which has a body - centered tetragonal ( bct ) lattice structure , and the peierls - landau instability of single chains helps formation of thick columns .",
    "an er fluid can turn into an er solid as the external field exceeds a critical field .",
    "for the er solid , it is known that its ground state is a bct lattice .",
    "one  @xcite proposed that a structure transformation of the er solid from the bct lattice to some other lattices can appear when a magnetic field is simultaneously applied perpendicular to the electric field and the particles have magnetic dipole moments .",
    "then , this proposal was verified experimentally and a structure transformation from the bct lattice to the face - centered cubic ( fcc ) lattice was observed indeed  @xcite .",
    "recently , lo and yu have also shown that an alternative structure transformation from the bct structure to the fcc can appear under the application of electric fields only  @xcite .",
    "finite - frequency responses of nonlinear dielectric composite materials have also attracted much attention both in research and industrial applications during the last two decades  @xcite .",
    "in particular , when a composite containing nonlinear dielectric particles embedded in a linear ( or nonlinear ) dielectric host medium is subjected to a sinusoidal alternating current ( ac ) electric field , the dielectric response of the composite will , in general , consist of ac fields at frequencies of higher - order harmonics  @xcite . in experiments , a convenient method of probing the nonlinear characteristics of the composite is to measure the harmonics of the nonlinear polarization under the application of a sinusoidal electric field  @xcite . in this case",
    ", the strength of the nonlinear polarization should be reflected in the magnitude of the harmonics . from the theoretical point of view",
    ", the perturbation expansion  @xcite and self - consistent methods  @xcite can be used for extracting such kind of harmonics .    in this work , to investigate the lattice effect on the nonlinear ac responses , we shall use the ewald - kornfeld formulation  @xcite to derive the local electric fields and induced dipole moments in the er solid which is subject to a structure transformation due to external fields , and then perform the perturbation expansion method to obtain their fundamental and third - order harmonics . to this end",
    ", it is shown that the fundamental and third - order harmonics are sensitive to the degree of anisotropy of er solids .",
    "thus , by measuring the nonlinear ac responses , it seems possible to perform a real - time monitoring of the structure transformation of er solids .",

    "iii , we numerically investigate these harmonics under different conditions , which is followed by a discussion and conclusion in sec .",
    "let us start by considering the ground state of an er solid , namely a bct ( body - centered tetragonal ) lattice , which can be regarded as a tetragonal lattice , plus a basis of two particles each of which is fixed with a point dipole at its center .",
    "one of the two particles is located at a corner and the other one at the body center of the tetragonal unit cell .",

    "as @xmath4 varies , the volume of the unit cell keeps the same , @xmath5 consequently , the degree of anisotropy of the tetragonal lattice is measured by how @xmath4 is deviated from unity .    in case of an @xmath6directed external electric field",
    "@xmath7 the dipole moments @xmath8 are perpendicular to the uniaxial anisotropic axis .",

    "we are now in a position to do some numerical calculations to discuss the effect of the degree of anisotropy @xmath4 on the harmonics of the local electric fields and induced dipole moments . without loss of generality ,",
    "take @xmath82 , @xmath83 ( dielectric constant of silicone oil ) , and @xmath84 for numerical calculations , where @xmath85 denotes the dielectric constant of free space .",
    "in fact , here @xmath86 corresponds to the dilute limit .",
    "nevertheless , it would be realizable as the particles can have a ( solid ) hard core and a relatively soft coating ( by long polymer chains , etc . ) to avoid aggregation .",
    "thus the model of a soft sphere with an embedded point dipole can be used . in this case , the many - body ( local field ) effects are important , while the multipolar effects can be neglected .",
    "this is exactly part of the emphasis in the present work . on the other hand , for a higher @xmath45 ,",
    "similar results can be achieved indeed , as expected .    in fig .  1",
    ", we investigate the dependence of the local - field factor@xcite on the degree of anisotropy @xmath4 .",
    "increasing @xmath4 causes @xmath38 ( or @xmath87 to increase ( or decrease ) .",
    "also , a plateau is shown at @xmath88 , which actually includes the transformations ranging from the bcc ( @xmath33 ) lattice to the fcc ( @xmath89 ) .",
    "accordingly , similar plateau occurs at all other figures ( see figs .  2  and  3 ) .",
    "figure  2 displays the fundamental and third - order harmonics of the local electric field and induced dipole moment , as a function of the degree of anisotropy @xmath4 for different @xmath90 for the transverse field case .",
    "it is found that increasing @xmath4 causes both the fundamental and third - order harmonics of the local electric field to decrease .",
    "accordingly , the fundamental harmonics of the induced dipole moment is caused to decreasing as well .",
    "however , the third - order harmonics of induced dipole moment is caused to increase as @xmath4 increases .",
    "note the three curves in fig .",
    "1(c ) are overlapped .",
    "similarly , we also investigate the harmonics of the local electric field and induced dipole moment in fig .  3 , but for the longitudinal field case .",
    "in contrast to the transverse field case ( fig .",
    "2 ) , the exactly opposite effects have been shown for the longitudinal field case ( fig .",
    "3 ) , due to the opposite dependence of @xmath4 on @xmath91 and @xmath92 see fig .  1 .",
    "again , the three curves in fig .",
    "1(c ) are overlapped .",
    "both figures  2  and  3 show that the harmonics are strongly dependent on the nonlinear response of the suspended particles .",
    "moreover , increasing the nonlinear response @xmath90 leads to an increase in the harmonics .",
    "this is in agreement with the results of our recent work  @xcite .",
    "in addition , we also studied the effect of volume fraction @xmath45 , and found that increasing the volume fraction can enhance the harmonics too ( no figures shown here ) .",
    "to understand the results , we resort to the spectral representation approach  @xcite .",
    "let s start by denoting @xmath93 , and then the local electric field given by eq .",
    "( [ et ] ) admits e_1=e_0+e_0 , where the residue @xmath94 and the pole @xmath95 as @xmath96 @xmath97 tends to @xmath98 which produces the known value for an isolated particle .",
    "the substitution of the present model parameters yields @xmath99 and hence we have e_1=e_0+e_0 . [ spr ] based on this equation , it is apparent to see that increasing @xmath91 or @xmath100 causes the electric field to decrease .",
    "in addition , we have shown that increasing @xmath4 causes @xmath101 ( or @xmath37 ) to increase ( or decrease ) , see fig .  1 .",
    "also , a plateau was shown at @xmath102 , which actually includes the transformations ranging from the bcc ( @xmath33 ) lattice to the fcc ( @xmath89 ) .",
    "because of the dependence of the harmonics on @xmath35 , similar plateau have already been shown in figs .  2  and  3 , too . as a matter of fact ,",
    "the effective linear dielectric constant mainly contributes to the magnitude of the fundamental harmonics of the induced dipole moment or local electric field . in the meantime , because of the existence of weak nonlinearity , the nonlinear polarization just has a perturbation effect , which can be neglected when compared to the linear part . since the spectral representation approach is a different way of formulating the linear local electric field , to some extent , it can be used to explain the fundamental harmonics of the local electric field and hence those of the induced dipole moment which are displayed in fig .  2(a , c ) and fig .",
    "3(a , c ) . based on eq .",
    "( [ spr ] ) ( namely , an expression obtained from the spectral representation approach ) , it is convenient for us to understand that a decrease ( or increase ) of @xmath4 should lead to an increase of the local electric field for transverse ( or longitudinal ) field cases . in this connection , for transverse ( or longitudinal ) field cases , the fundamental harmonics of the local electric field and hence corresponding induced dipole moment should increase as @xmath4 decreases ( or increases ) .",
    "this has also been displayed in fig .",
    "2(a , c ) ( or fig .",
    "3(a , c ) ) .",
    "the explanation on the third - order harmonics of the local electric field and induced dipole moment seems to be more complicated .",
    "nevertheless , since the strength of the nonlinear polarization of nonlinear materials should be reflected in the magnitude of the high - order harmonics of local electric fields and induced dipole moments , the effective nonlinear part in the effective nonlinear dielectric constant should be expected to determine the magnitude of the third - order harmonics .",
    "it appears that the third - order harmonics of the local electric field show a behavior similar to its fundamental harmonics .",
    "however , inverse behavior occurs to the third - order harmonics of the induced dipole moment .",
    "this difference would possibly be due to the nonlinearity fluctuation which might arise from the long - range interaction .",
    "this interaction existing in the system is explicitly evaluated in the current paper , by using the ewald technique .",
    "here some comments are in order . in this work ,",
    "we have used the ewald - kornfeld formulation to derive the local electric fields and induced dipole moments in a rigorous manner , in an attempt to take into account the lattice ( local - field ) effect on the nonlinear ac responses of er solids under structure transformations .",
    "in fact , we presented an ( approximate ) effective medium theory ( emt ) for considering the local - field effect on the electrorotation and dielectric dispersion spectra of colloidal particles or biological cells in the previous paper  @xcite .",
    "however , we were unable to study the detailed structural information via the emt .",
    "in the present paper , we have considered the local - field effect in a rigorous manner , based on the ewald - kornfeld formulation which is quite different from the emt .",
    "we have considered the fundamental and third - order harmonics . as a matter of fact",
    ", it should be straightforward to investigate the higher - order ( e.g. , fifth - order , seventh - order , etc . ) harmonics by keeping more terms in eq .",
    "( [ taylor - e ] ) . due to the virtue of symmetry ,",
    "the odd - order harmonics appear only .",
    "in fact , the even - order harmonics can also be induced to occur due to the coupling between the ac and dc external fields  @xcite .",
    "since the second - order harmonics can often be of several orders of magnitude larger than the third - order , it is of value to discuss the lattice effect on the nonlinear ac responses by applying an ac field coupling with a dc field , in order to investigate the second - order harmonics . finally , this work can be extended to polydisperse er solids  @xcite in which the permittivities of particles can possess a distribution , or to a system  @xcite where anisotropies of material and geometry are caused to exist due to fabrication methods or field effects . on the other hand ,",
    "the nonlinear response of composites to ac fields will become more complicated when the ac field contains different basic frequencies or different magnitudes of external fields at different basic frequencies  @xcite .    our former work  @xcite covers a wider range of the degree of anisotropy @xmath4 .",
    "however , the explicit form of the local field-@xmath4 relation was lacking . by invoking a lattice structure ( which exists in er solids ) , this can be achieved , as evident in this work . in detail , in ref .",
    "@xcite we used an effective medium theory to derive effective ( anisotropic ) dielectric constants , based on the maxwell - garnett approximation .",
    "in contrast , in the current paper , the ewald technique is used to derive the effective dielectric constants , by including the long - range interaction explicitly ( which was , however , lacking in ref .",
    "@xcite ) . in this sense , for treating er solids with lattice structures , the present derivation of the effective dielectric constants should be expected to be more accurate .",
    "interestingly , some result of the current paper was also predicted in ref .",
    "for instance , as @xmath4 decreases , for longitudinal ( or transverse ) field cases @xmath37 ( or @xmath101 ) is caused to increase ( or decrease ) , thus yielding an increasing ( or decreasing ) third - order harmonics of the induced dipole moment , see fig .",
    "3(d ) ( or fig .",
    "2(d ) ) . here",
    "@xmath37 ( or @xmath101 ) corresponds to @xmath103 ( or @xmath104 ) of ref .",
    "it is worth to mentioning that a different normalization factor ( i.e. , @xmath105 ) was used in ref .",
    "@xcite .    to sum up , based on the ewald - kornfeld formulation , we have investigated the nonlinear as responses of an er solid with nonlinear spherical particles embedded in a linear host fluid , and found that the fundamental and third - order harmonic ac responses are sensitive to the degree of anisotropy within the er solid .",
    "our results have been well understood through the spectral representation theory .",
    "thus , by measuring the nonlinear ac responses of er solids , it seems possible to perform a real - time monitoring of structure transformations .",
