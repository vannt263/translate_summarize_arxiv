    "the electron - proton collider hera ended its data taking on june 30 , 2007 . over its lifetime of more than 15 years of operation",
    ", it has allowed each experiment , h1 and zeus , to collect an integrated luminosity of about @xmath2 and @xmath3 in positron - proton and electron - proton collisions respectively in the first phase ( hera-1 ) from 1992 to 2000 . in the second phase ( hera-2 ) from 2003 to 2007 , the positron and electron samples have increased by a factor of @xmath4 and @xmath5 respectively .",
    "in addition , spin rotators installed at the h1 and zeus interaction regions have provided longitudinal electron and positron polarization at hera-2 .",
    "the results reviewed in the talk concern both the electroweak ( ew ) measurements in the standard model ( sm ) and searches beyond the sm .",
    "they are based either on the dominant inclusive deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) processes of neutral and charged current interactions or on rare exclusive processes such as single @xmath6 and lepton pair productions .",
    "the advantage in the former case is high statistics and in the latter case clean and well defined final states .",
    "while the emphasis is put on presenting the latest results , some early results are also shown in a few cases in order to illustrate the progress that has been made over the years and the impact of the increased data samples .",
    "at hera , both the neutral current ( nc ) and the charged current ( cc ) interactions can be studied . the cross sections of these processes may be written in the following simplified form : @xmath7 where @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the fine structure constant and fermi constant for electromagnetic and weak interactions respectively , @xmath10 and @xmath11 are vector and axial - vector couplings of the @xmath12 boson to light quarks @xmath13 @xmath14 , @xmath15 is the polarization value of the electron beam , @xmath16 is the four - momentum transfer squared , @xmath17 the propagator mass of the @xmath6 boson , and @xmath18 are the structure function terms for nc and cc processes respectively , which provide the primary constraint on the parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) of the proton .    in nc interactions at high @xmath16 ,",
    "when @xmath12 exchange and @xmath19 interference become increasingly important , the nc cross section depends both on @xmath10 and @xmath11 and on the beam polarization @xmath15 . however , these dependencies can not be factorized , contrary to the @xmath15 dependence of the cc cross section .",
    "in addition , from the @xmath16 dependence and the normalization of the cc cross section , one can determine the propagator mass of the @xmath6 boson and the fermi constant @xmath9 respectively .",
    "the first evidence of the massive @xmath6 boson at hera was obtained from the observed deviation of the cc cross section from a linear dependence on the beam energy based on the very first data of the h1 collaboration taken in 1993 corresponding to an integrated luminosity of @xmath20  @xcite .",
    "the electron beam of @xmath21 in collision with the proton beam of @xmath22 resulted in a center of mass energy @xmath23 of @xmath24 . and from 1998 on , the proton beam energy was also increased to @xmath25 resulting in @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "] this is equivalent to an electron beam with energy of almost @xmath28 hitting a fixed target .",
    "the first quantitative determination of the propagator mass of the @xmath6 boson , @xmath29 , was derived from the @xmath16 dependence of the cc cross section @xmath30 with an @xmath31 data sample of @xmath32  @xcite .",
    "together with the nc cross section @xmath33 , it was shown that the @xmath16 dependence of the nc and cc cross sections are very different . at low @xmath16",
    "the electromagnetic interaction is much stronger than the weak interaction .",
    "the difference diminishes , however , as @xmath16 increases , and the cross sections become comparable when @xmath16 values reach the @xmath6 and @xmath12 boson mass squared , demonstrating the ew unification in dis .    the propagator mass determination in the space - like regime at hera is complementary to other measurements using time - like production of @xmath6 bosons at the tevatron and at lep and constitutes an important experimental consistency check of the sm .    based on an @xmath31 ( @xmath34 ) sample of @xmath35 ( @xmath36 ) , h1 has performed a similar determination of the @xmath6 propagator mass : @xmath37 ( @xmath38 ) , where the first error is statistical and the second systematic  @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to note that the precision is better with the @xmath31 data , albeit with a smaller integrated luminosity .",
    "this is because the @xmath39 ( @xmath40 ) exchange probes mostly the @xmath41 ( @xmath42 ) quark in the proton resulting in a much larger cc cross section in @xmath31 interactions .    with an increased @xmath34 data sample of @xmath43 taken in 1994 - 1997 by zeus , a simultaneous fit of @xmath17 and @xmath9",
    "was performed resulting in @xmath44 , where the three errors correspond to the statistical , systematic and pdfs uncertainty respectively  @xcite .",
    "when fixing @xmath9 to the world average value  @xcite , zeus obtained @xmath45 , where the last error from the pdfs dominates over the statistical and other systematic errors .    in all above results , the correlation between the ew parameters with the pdfs was not fully taken into account .",
    "a first analysis which considered such a correlation was performed by h1 , using the complete high @xmath16 nc and cc cross section data and all available low @xmath16 data from hera-1  @xcite .",
    "the result on the propagator mass was @xmath46 , where the first error is experimental and the second the model uncertainty  @xcite . within the sm , a much more precise @xmath6 mass determination , @xmath47 ,",
    "was obtained using the sm constraint between @xmath17 , @xmath9 and other ew parameters @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the mass of the @xmath12 boson , and @xmath50 represents radiative corrections which contain among others a quadratic top quark mass term and a logarithmic higgs mass term  @xcite .",
    "the ten - fold increase of the @xmath31 data from hera-2 should substantially improve the final precision of the @xmath6 mass determination from hera .      using the same hera-1 data sample ,",
    "h1 has also performed a combined ew - pdf fit in which the four light quark couplings @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 and @xmath54 to @xmath12 have been determined taking into account their correlation with the pdfs  @xcite .",
    "the resulting precision is comparable with those from cdf and the combined lep / sld ew fit .",
    "in addition , the hera data can resolve the sign ambiguity seen in some of the other determinations .",
    "the polarized electron beam at hera-2 is expected to give additional sensitivity to these couplings in particular the vector couplings . indeed , including new preliminary nc cross section measurements based on part of the analyzed hera-2 data , a new fit has substantially improved the precision  @xcite .",

    ", additional differences in the cross sections between the left - handed polarization ( @xmath55 ) and the right - handed polarization ( @xmath56 ) are expected for the weak interaction of @xmath12 exchange .",

    "the curves describe the theoretical predictions in nlo qcd as obtained in pdf fits to the h1 inclusive data and to the inclusive and jet zeus data , respectively .",
    "both fits have been performed using the unpolarized hera-1 data . ]",
    "nc interactions at high @xmath16 at hera provide an important test of the sm at the high energy frontier .",
    "indeed , the sm @xmath16 spectrum is expected to be modified if the interacting electron and quark have a finite size : @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the electron or quark form factor , @xmath62 being the mean squared radius of the ew charge distribution .",
    "assuming a point - like electron , i.e. setting @xmath63 as it has been well constrained elsewhere  @xcite , and using the full hera ( preliminary hera-2 and published hera-1 ) data , an upper limit on the radius of the light @xmath41 and @xmath42 quarks , @xmath64 , at @xmath65 cl has been derived by h1  @xcite .",
    "the limit @xmath66 from zeus is similar  @xcite .",
    "new interactions between @xmath67 and @xmath13 involving mass scales @xmath68 above the center of mass energy can also modify the sm nc cross section at high @xmath16 via virtual effects .",
    "such interactions can be modeled as four - fermion contact interactions as an effective theory by additional terms in the sm lagrangian @xmath69 where the sum runs over electron and quark helicities and quark flavors . in eq.([lci ] ) , only vector currents are considered as strong limits have already been placed on scalar and tensor contact interactions . the coupling @xmath70 may be written as @xmath71 , where the coefficient @xmath72 may take the values @xmath73 or zero . in the hera contact interaction analyses ,",

    "the numbers at the right and left margins are the corresponding lower limits on the mass scale @xmath75 ( @xmath76 ) and @xmath77 ( @xmath78 ) respectively . ]",
    "according to eq.([xscc ] ) , the cc cross section of purely weak interactions is expected to have a linear dependence on the beam polarization @xmath15 .",
    "the ( preliminary ) measurements of the total cc cross section for @xmath79 and inelasticity @xmath80 with polarized hera-2 data are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ccxs ] together with the corresponding cross sections of the published hera-1 data with unpolarized beams  @xcite .",
    "the measurements are in good agreement with the expected linear dependence .    in the sm ,",
    "only the left - handed @xmath6 boson participates in the weak interaction , and the corresponding cross sections thus vanish for @xmath81 ( @xmath34 ) and @xmath82 ( @xmath31 ) .",
    "the production of right - handed cc would result in a deviation from zero at these polarization values .",
    "the contribution of a right - handed cc can be derived from linear fits to the measured cross sections and from extrapolating the results of the fits to @xmath83 .",

    "both h1 and zeus have performed their first search using the data of 1992 of less than @xmath84  @xcite .",
    "indeed , the hera @xmath85 collider is an ideal machine to look for resonant production of new particles ( lqs , squarks ) , which couple via yukawa couplings directly to a lepton and a parton , up to the center of mass energy .",
    "-channel virtual exchange of new particles coupling to lepton - quark pairs . ]",
    "this is in contrast to the pair - production in @xmath86 at the lep or in @xmath87 at the tevatron collider , in which case the mass reach for a direct search is up to half of the center of mass energy .",
    "the search for the first generation lqs considers its decay into an electron and a quark or into a neutrino and a quark .",
    "these lq decays lead to final states identical to dis events .",
    "one can not distinguish them on an event by event basis , but has to rely on different angular distributions , e.g.  flat for scalar lqs and steeply falling for dis events .",
    "in the history of the hera running , one of the most exciting moments happened in 1997 when both h1 and zeus reported an excess of high @xmath16 events based on their 1994 - 1996 data of less than @xmath3  @xcite . the excess generated in a short period of time a huge number of speculations on possible new physics including resonant production of lqs or squarks .",
    "however , the later high statistics data samples collected by both experiments did not confirm the excess , and constraints on lq production were derived .",
    "an example for the existing constraints using the full hera data sample from h1 on a scalar lq , which decays exclusively into an electron and a quark , is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : lq ]  @xcite .",
    "the new preliminary limit significantly improves the previous limit from hera-1  @xcite . for moderate yukawa coupling values @xmath88 of about @xmath89",

    "of a first generation leptoquark coupling to @xmath90 ( @xmath91 ) . ]",
    "searches for lqs coupling to first and second generation fermions have also been performed  @xcite . in this case",
    ", the final state lepton is different from the incident electron ( lepton flavor violating processes ) , and the searches are thus essentially background free .",
    "the corresponding constraints are also more stringent than those on the first generation lqs .    in supersymmetric ( susy ) models where",
    "the so - called @xmath92-parity ( @xmath93 ) is not conserved , squarks could be resonantly produced at hera similar to lqs .",
    "in addition to the lq - like decays , squarks also undergo decays into gauginos ( the supersymmetric partners of gauge bosons ) .",
    "a dedicated search requires a large number of final states to be analyzed .",
    "this has been pioneered by h1 in  @xcite , where the full hera-1 data have been used to set constraints on susy models .",
    "a similar analysis looking for the susy partner of the top quark has been performed by zeus  @xcite .",
    "the observed replication of three fermion families suggests the possibility that these fermions may be composite particles , consisting of combinations of more fundamental entities .",
    "the observation of excited states of leptons or quarks would be a clear signal that these particles are composite rather than elementary .",
    "at hera , excited electrons , quarks and neutrinos ( @xmath94 ) with masses up to the kinematic limit of the center of mass energy could be produced directly via @xmath95-channel exchange of a gauge boson .",
    "the full hera @xmath0 data sample collected by h1 has been used to search for excited electrons via the decays @xmath96 , @xmath97 and @xmath98  @xcite .",
