    "within a last decade , a series of remarkable force - extension experiments was performed using atomic force microscopy ( afm ) .",
    "these experiments show that the elastic response of a single molecule is clearly related to the internal structure of the molecule .",
    "force - extension profiles of single molecules such as dna , rna , synthetic polyelectrolytes , giant protein titin and chromatin fibers @xcite show characteristic saw - tooth patterns , which are interpreted as successive unfolding of internal domains .",
    "this is in agreement with theoretical studies@xcite and computer simulations @xcite predicting that step - wise unfolding pattern can be seen from the unfolding of pearl necklace of polyelectrolytes in a poor solvents@xcite and protein models @xcite .    in some polymer systems ( specially , biopolymers and proteins )",
    ", the intra - chain self - assembly produces secondary or tertiary structures and the elastic response reflects this structural hierarchy@xcite .",
    "the afm experiments show that a series of partial unfoldings of those collapsed structure occurs by applying an external force .",
    "when the elastic energy gain is comparable with increase of the potential energy , the extension increases abruptly by @xmath1 .",
    "the resulting force - extension profile is rich and reflects the domain size responding to the applied force .",
    "information on the sequence of the linear structure reveals on the force - extension curve . in this sense",
    "it is interesting to trace back the particular sequence structure of a given chain from the measured elastic response .    in our previous study@xcite",
    ", we minimized the free energy at the given force ( which mimics a constant force measurement experiments ) .",
    "the obtained minimum corresponds to the ground state or to the metastable states . at several characteristic values of force ,",
    "segments of linear chain in the collapsed phase unfold in the pattern of `` plateaus '' in @xmath0 curve .",
    "however , these `` plateaus '' often correspond to the multiple conformational transitions going through different extensions @xmath2 if domains have similar binding energies . therefore sequence information is partly washed away under the constant force measurements .",
    "another experimentally common , yet theoretically more challenging , set up of afm measurement is performed by imposing the distance and measuring the restoring force .",
    "typically , the force - extension profile has a saw - tooth pattern .",
    "each time an internal domain is pulled out , the contact with cantilever becomes loose resulting in a big drop of the measured force .",
    "hence , this sequence information is more directly accessible by force - extension measurement when the distance is imposed",
    ". then an arising question is , if it is possible to recover the information about the sequence of polymer from force - extension profiles .",
    "for this purpose , we present theoretical frame work how to `` read '' the sequence information from the elastic response . we demonstrate the mapping of the force - extension profiles to the sequence information under the controlled displacement .",
    "we show that it is feasible to extract the composition of block sizes to some extent while the order of arrangement of those blocks still remains to be answered .",
    "we consider a polymer chain of @xmath3 monomers , one end of which is fixed at a reference point ( i.e. @xmath4 ) and the other end is brought to the distance @xmath2 from the reference point .",

    "we assume that hydrophobic segments @xmath11 have a tendency to collapse into a compact globule of radius @xmath12 and these unit globules are not further stretchable .",
    "these single block globules can merge together into a larger globule leaving the connecting hydrophilic segments as loops on the surface of the large globule .",
    "the optimal conformation of the chain is obtained from the minimum free energy under the given extension @xmath2 .",
    "the free energy consists of the two main contributions , the interaction energy of the collapsed h - blocks ( globules ) and the elastic part of the p - blocks ( strings ) . for simplicity , here we assume that p - block strings have the elastic properties of ideal gaussian chain ( later we discuss more realistic langevin chain model ) . for the chain of length @xmath9 and size @xmath13 ,",
