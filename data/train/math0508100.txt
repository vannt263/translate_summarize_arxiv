    "asymptotic expansions are generally easier to define ( via _ feynman diagram _ techniques ) than the partition functions @xmath37 themselves . even when the partition functions can be defined , the asymptotic expansions is a numerically useful way to approximate them .    in @xcite",

    "in other words , the sequence @xmath59 of complex numbers grows exponentially with respect to @xmath0 , and the exponential growth - rate is proportional to the volume of a hyperbolic knot .",
    "one can define the volume function @xmath60 of every representation @xmath61 , see @xcite , and @xmath62 is exactly the value of this volume function with @xmath63 being the discrete faithful representation of the knot group .",
    "the idea of the generalized volume conjecture ( formulated in part by gukov in @xcite ) is that we should use other representations of the knot complement in @xmath64 . for @xmath2 nearby @xmath4 , in a small neighborhood of @xmath63",

    "the generalized volume conjecture for @xmath2 sufficiently close to @xmath4 may now be stated as follows .    if @xmath70 is sufficiently close to @xmath71 then @xmath72 and if @xmath73 , then @xmath74 where @xmath75 are some nonzero constants .",

    ", we will refer to the parameter @xmath2 in the generalized volume conjecture as _ the angle _ , making contact with standard terminology from hyperbolic geometry .",
    "there are two rather independent parts in the volume conjecture :    * to show that the limit exists in , * to identify the limit with the volume of the corresponding dehn filling .    at the moment",
    ", the generalized volume conjecture is known only for the @xmath78 knot and certain values of @xmath2 ; see murakami , @xcite .",
    "one may further ask what happens to the generalized volume conjecture when the angle @xmath2 is small . for @xmath79 ,",
    "it is natural to define @xmath80 to be the _ trivial _ representation .",
    "then for @xmath2 small enough , there is a unique ( up to conjugation ) _ abelian _ @xmath81 representation @xmath82 that satisfies .",
    "abelian representations have @xmath83 volume ( see eg , @xcite ) . on the other hand , for small enough @xmath2",
    ", we have @xmath84 . thus theorem [ thm.11 ]",
    "implies that    for every knot @xmath5 there exists an open neighborhood @xmath34 of @xmath35 , such that for @xmath85 , we have : @xmath86    in other words , theorem [ thm.11 ] settles the generalized volume conjecture for small complex angles .",
    "our next result states that the volume conjecture can only be barely true .    for every knot @xmath5 and every fixed integer @xmath87 @xmath88",

    ".    for every knot @xmath5 there exist a neighborhood @xmath92 of @xmath93 such that when @xmath94 is rational and not equal to @xmath71 , then @xmath95      our next theorem is an upper bound for the generalized volume conjecture .",
    "let @xmath96 denote the real part of @xmath2 .",
    "for every knot @xmath5 with @xmath97 crossings and every @xmath98 , we have @xmath99      when @xmath100 , the upper bound in theorem [ thm.up ] is not optimal , and does not reveal any relationship between the @xmath101 and hyperbolic geometry .",
    "our next theorem fills this gap .    for every knot @xmath5 with @xmath97 crossings",
    "we have @xmath102 where @xmath103 is the volume of the _ regular ideal octahedron_see @xcite .",
    "using an ideal decomposition of a knot complement by placing one octahedron per crossing , it follows that for every knot @xmath5 with @xmath97 crossings , we have @xmath104 where @xmath105 is the hyperbolic volume of the knot complement . on the other hand ,",
    "if the volume conjecture holds for @xmath100 , then @xmath106 one may ask whether ( and therefore , whether the bound in theorem [ thm.4 ] ) is optimal .",
    "this may be a little surprising , since it involves all knots ( and not just alternating ones ) and their number of crossings , an invariant that carries little known geometric information .",
    "in conversations with i.agol and d.thurston , it was communicated to us that the upper bound in is indeed optimal .",
    "moreover a class of knots that achieves ( in the limit ) the optimal ratio of volume to number of crossings is obtained by taking a large chunk of the following _ weave _ , and closing it up to a knot : @xmath107 the complement of the weave has a complete hyperbolic structure associated with the _ square tessellation _ of the euclidean plane : @xmath108 optimality follows along similar lines as the appendix of @xcite , using a stronger estimate for the lower bound of the volume of haken manifolds , cut along an incompressible surface : if m is a hyperbolic finite volume 3-manifold containing a properly imbedded orientable , boundary incompressible , incompressible surface @xmath109 , then @xmath110 where @xmath111 stands for volume , and the @xmath112 terminology are defined in @xcite .",
    "the proof of this stronger statement ( of agol-dunfield-storm-w.thurston @xcite ) uses , among other things , work of perelman .",
    "the reader may compare with the following result of agol-lackenby-d.thurston @xcite : if @xmath5 is an alternating knot with a planar projection having @xmath113 twist , then @xmath114 where @xmath115 is the volume of the regular ideal tetrahedron .",
    "moreover , the class of knots obtained by dehn filling on the _ chain link _ has asymptotic ratio of volume by twist number equal to @xmath116 .",
    "the corresponding tessellation of the euclidean plane is given by the _ star of david_.    so far , we have formulated a generalized volume conjecture for @xmath2 near @xmath83 and @xmath2 near @xmath117 , using representations near the trivial or near the discrete faithful .",
    "how can we connect these choices for other complex angles @xmath2 ?",
    "a natural answer to this question requires analyzing asymptotics of solutions of difference equations with a parameter .",
    "this is a different subject that we will not discuss here ; instead we will refer the curious reader to @xcite , and forthcoming work of the first author . for a further discussion , see also section [ sec.physics ] .      in section [ sub.complex ]",
    "we show that weak convergence plus uniform boundedness implies strong convergence .",
    "thus the strong convergence of theorems [ thm.11 ] and [ thm.1 ] follows from the weak convergence of theorems [ thm.mmr ] and [ thm.zrat ] , plus uniform bounds .",
    "uniform bounds for the colored jones function require large cancellations . in order to control these cancellations",
    ", we use the cyclotomic expansion of the colored jones function of a knot , which is recalled in section [ sec.fti ] . an important point about this expansion",
    "is that its kernel can absorb the exponential bounds of the coefficients of the cyclotomic functions ; see sections [ sec.estimates ] and [ sec.allorders ] .    using a state - sum formula for the colored jones function , we give in section [ sec.boundsjones ] bounds for the degrees and coefficients of the @xmath0-th colored jones polynomial .",
    "the result is also of independent interest .",
    "the important point is that the local weights in the state - sum formula ( i.e. , the entries of the @xmath118-matrix ) are laurent polynomials , given by some ratio of @xmath119-factorials . a priori , the bounds of the @xmath0-colored jones function are not good enough to deduce the bounds for the @xmath0-th cyclotomic function . however , in section [ sec.boundscyclotomic ] , we use a lemma on the growth - rate of the number of partitions of an integer , in order to deduce the desired bounds for the cyclotomic function . as a corollary",
    ", we can deduce the upper bound of theorem [ thm.up ] .    in the independent section [ sec.hypgeom ] ,",
    "we give a better bound for the growth - rate of the entries of the @xmath118-matrix .",
    "the important point is that these entries are ratio of @xmath120 @xmath119-factorials , and each @xmath119-factorial grows exponentially with rate given by the lobachevsky function .",
    "the @xmath119-factorials are arranged in such a way to deduce that the exponential growth - rate of the entries of the @xmath118-matrix is given by the volume of an ideal octahedron .",
    "together with our state - sum formulas for the @xmath0-th colored jones polynomial , it results in the upper bound of theorem [ thm.4 ] .",
    "we discuss in section [ sec.cyclotomic ] the proof of theorems [ thm.near1 ] and [ thm.near2 ] .    in section [ sec.qholonomic ]",
    "we discuss bounds on the degrees and coefficients of @xmath119-holonomic functions .",
    "earlier work of the authors implies that the colored jones and the cyclotomic functions of a knot are @xmath119-holonomic .",
    "in section [ sec.physics ] we discuss some physics ideas related to the various expansions of the colored jones function .",
    "finally , in the appendices we establish the volume conjecture for the borromean rings using estimates obtained in the proofs of the main results . at the time when the first draft of this paper was written ( 2004 ) , this was the only hyperbolic link for which the volume conjecture is established .",
    "since then the volume conjecture has been proved for several other hyperbolic links , see eg .",
