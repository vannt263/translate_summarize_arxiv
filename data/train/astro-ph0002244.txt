    "a key problem in studies of objects emitting most of their energy in the fir / submm is to establish the relative importance of highly obscured active galactic nuclei ( agn ) and starburst activity . in particular",
    ", it is important to know if it is still possible to hide an agn , contributing significantly to the bolometric emission , when optical to mid - ir spectroscopy and imaging reveal only a starburst component .",
    "several pieces of evidence suggest that most cosmic agn activity is obscured .",
    "most , and possibly all , cores of large galaxies host a supermassive black hole ( @xmath3@xmath4@xmath5 ; e.g. richstone et al .",
    "@xcite ) . to complete the formation process in a hubble time",
    ", accretion must proceed at high rates , producing quasar luminosities ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "however the observed black hole density is an order of magnitude greater than that expected from the observed quasar light , assuming accretion efficiency of 10% , suggesting that most of the accretion history is obscured ( e.g. fabian & iwasawa @xcite , and references therein ) .",
    "it is estimated either that 85% of all agns are obscured ( type 2 ) or that 85% of the accretion history of an object is hidden from view .",
    "in addition , the hard x - ray background ( @xmath7 ) requires a large population of obscured agns at higher redshifts ( @xmath8 ) since the observed spectral energy distribution can not be explained with the continua of quasars , i.e. un  obscured ( type 1 ) agns ( comastri et al .",
    "@xcite , gilli et al .",

    "@xcite , blain et al . @xcite and references therein ) are candidate to host the missing population of type 2 agns .",
    "however , mid - ir iso spectroscopy has recently shown that ulirgs are mostly powered by starbursts and that no trace of agns is found in the majority of cases ( genzel et al .",
    "@xcite ; lutz et al .",
    "@xcite ) . yet",
    ", the emission of a hidden agn could be heavily absorbed even in the mid - ir .",
    "indeed , the obscuration of the agn could be related to the starburst phenomenon , as observed for seyfert 2s ( maiolino et al .",
    "fabian et al . ( @xcite ) proposed that the energy input from supernovae and stellar winds prevents interstellar clouds from collapsing into a thin disk , thus maintaining them in orbits that intercept the majority of the lines of sight from an active nucleus .",
    "in this paper , we investigate the existence of completely obscured agns and the starburst - agn connection through observations of ngc 4945 , one of the closest galaxies where an agn and starburst coexist .",

    "the dust lane has a sharp southern edge which is not very evident in the color map and can be explained by saturated absorption : background h and k emission becomes completely undetectable and the color is dominated by foreground stars . therefore , the sharp k edge is evidence for a region with such high extinction that it is not detected even in the near - ir . with this dust distribution ,",
    "the observed morphology in the continuum images is the result of an extinction gradient in the direction perpendicular to the galactic disk .",

    "indeed , in the r image , significant emission is detected only in the wind - blown cavity which presents a clear conical morphology with well defined edges and apex lying @xmath40 from the k peak .",
    "due to the above mentioned reddening gradient , the apex of the cone gets closer to the nucleus with increasing wavelength ( compare with r band and pa@xmath41/h@xmath20 images  see below ) .    the continuum - subtracted paschen @xmath41 image ( fig .",

    "dust extinction strongly affects the @xmath1  morphology making very difficult to trace the ring and locate its center ; a likely consequence is the apparent misalignment between the galaxy nucleus and the ring center .",
    "the observed ring of star formation is similar to what has been found in other starburst galaxies ( cf .",
    "moorwood @xcite ) .",
    "the starburst ring could result from two alternative scenarios : either the starburst originates at the nucleus , and then propagates outward forming a ring in the galactic disk ; or the ring corresponds to the position of the inner lindblad resonance where the gas density is naturally increased by flow from both sides ( see the review in moorwood @xcite ) .",
    "panel b shows the continuum - subtracted h@xmath20 image which traces the edges of the wind - blown cavity .",
    "as expected , the morphology is completely different from that of @xmath1  which traces mainly starburst activity .",
    "note the strong h@xmath20 emission close to the nucleus at the apex of the cavity with an elongated , arc - like morphology .",
    "the @xmath2  flux in a @xmath42 aperture centered on the k band peak is 1.1@xmath43@xmath34@xmath36@xmath37@xmath35  and corresponds to @xmath44 of the total integrated emission in the nicmos field of view .",

    "we remark that contamination of @xmath2  emission by @xmath46@xmath472.112@xmath48is unlikely since the line was detected neither by koornneef ( @xcite ) nor by moorwood & oliva ( @xcite ) and from their spectra we can set an upper limit of 5 - 10%  to the @xmath46/@xmath2  ratio .",
    "panel c in figure [ fig : line ] shows that the equivalent width of @xmath1  is up to 150200  in the star forming regions , but much lower in the wind - blown cavity . since",
    "near - ir continuum emission within the cone is not significantly higher than in the surrounding medium , the low equivalent width within the cone is due to weaker @xmath1  emission , the likely consequence of low gas density .",

    "the @xmath0$]/@xmath1  ratio is much higher than in the rest of the starburst region .",
    "the @xmath0 $ ]  emission likely originates in radiative supernova remnants ( snrs ) . in the dense nuclear region of ngc4945 the radiative phase of the snrs will be short , and hence the @xmath0 $ ]  emission will be much more strongly affected by the stochastic nature of supernova explosions in the starburst ring than @xmath1 .",
    "the regions of high @xmath0$]/@xmath1  ratios thus simply trace recent supernova activity .",
    "a lower limit and a reasonable estimate of reddening can be obtained from the h ",
    "k color image in the case of foreground screen extinction . in this case , the extinction is simply @xmath50 where the color excess is given by the difference between observed and intrinsic colour , @xmath51 and the @xmath52 coefficients represent the wavelength dependence of the extinction law ; @xmath53 .",
    "we have assumed @xmath54 ( @xmath55 ) and @xmath56 .",
    "spiral and elliptical galaxies have average intrinsic colours @xmath57 with 0.1@xmath58  dispersion ( hunt et al .",
    "@xcite ) and the color correction due to the non - standard filters used by nicmos is negligible ",
    "@xmath59 instead of 0.22 . in the region of the @xmath1  ring , the average color @xmath60 yields @xmath61 , in fair agreement with the estimate @xmath62 from the balmer decrement presented below . in knot",
    "b @xmath63 yields @xmath64 , while in knot c @xmath65 yields @xmath66 .",
    "a different reddening estimate can be derived from the analysis of hydrogen line ratios .",
    "we can estimate the reddening to `` knot b '' and `` knot c '' by using the images and spectra published by moorwood et al .",
    "( @xcite ) .",
    "the inferred reddening ( assuming an intrinsic ratio pa@xmath41/h@xmath41=0.18 , and @xmath67 , @xmath68 ) is @xmath69=3.2 for knot b and @xmath69=3.8 for knot c. we can also estimate a lower limit to the reddening on the @xmath1  ring .",
    "considering a region @xmath70 aligned along the galactic plane , including all the stronger @xmath1  emission , we find @xmath71 which corresponds to @xmath62mag , a value in agreement with the estimate given by moorwood & oliva ( @xcite ) , @xmath72 , from the @xmath73/@xmath74  ratio in a @xmath75 aperture centered on the ir peak .",
    "we note that the first approach measures the mean extinction of the starlight , while the second one measures the extinction toward the hii regions .",
    "therefore , these @xmath69  estimates indicate that in the case of knot c the star light and the emitting gas are located behind the same screen .",
    "conversely , knot b has a lower extinction and must therefore be located in front of the screen hiding the star light .",
    "a likely interpretation is that knot c is located within the galactic plane on the walls of the cavity farthest from us .",
    "whereas knot b is located above the galactic plane , toward the observer    it appears that the hypothesis of screen extinction can provide reasonable results .",
    "of course the true extinction , i.e. the optical depth at a given wavelength , is larger if dust is mixed with the emitting regions .",
    "however , it should be noted that the case in which dust is completely and uniformly mixed with the emitting regions does not apply here because the observed color excesses are larger than the maximum value expected in that case ( @xmath76 ) .      a straight computation of the co stellar index as + @xmath77 , where @xmath78 and @xmath79 are the magnitudes in the co and k filters , is hindered by the high extinction gradients .",
    "therefore we have corrected for the reddening using the prescription described above : @xmath80 where , as above , the @xmath52 coefficients represent the wavelength dependence of the reddening law .",
    "the correction is @xmath81 which is important since the expected co index is @xmath82 .",
    "the `` corrected '' photometric co index map is displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : line]e .    as a check , in the central @xmath83",
    "we derive a photometric co index of 0.18 which is in good agreement with the value 0.22 obtained from spectroscopic observations by oliva et al .",
    "( @xcite ) , when one takes into account the uncertainties of reddening correction .    in the central region",
    "there are three knots where the co index reaches values @xmath84 aligned along the galactic disk .",
    "however , we do not detect any clear indication of dilution by a spatially unresolved source , that would be expected in the case of emission by hot ( @xmath85 ) dust heated by the agn .",
    "there are regions close to the location of the h@xmath20o maser where the co index is as low as 0.08 but that value is still consistent with pure stellar emission or , more likely , with an imperfect reddening correction .",
    "the nicmos observations presented in this paper were aimed at detecting near - ir traces of agn activity in the central ( @xmath86 ) region of ngc 4945 .",
    "indeed , recent nicmos studies exploiting the high spatial resolution of hst show that active galactic nuclei are usually characterized by prominent point sources in k , detected e.g. in the seyfert 2 galaxies circinus ( maiolino et al .",
    "@xcite ) and ngc 1068 , and the radio galaxy centaurus a ( schreier et al .",
    "ngc 4945 does not show any point - like emission at the position of the nucleus ( identified by the @xmath87  maser ) and the upper limit to the nuclear emission is @xmath88 .",
    "we also do not detect any dilution of the co absorption features by hot dust emission , as observed in many active galaxies ( oliva et al .",
    "@xcite ) . from the analysis of the co index image , non - stellar",
    "light contributes less than @xmath89 thus providing a tighter upper limit than above .",
    "the lack of a point source in the ground based l and n observations also places upper limits on the mid - ir emission , though less tight due to the lower sensitivity and spatial resolution ( @xmath90 and @xmath91 ) .",
    "finally , type 2 agns are usually characterized by ionization cones detected either in line images or in excitation maps , i.e. ratios between high and low excitation lines ( usually @xmath92 $ ]  and @xmath93 ) revealing higher excitation than the surrounding medium . in ngc 4945 the equivalent width of @xmath1  and the @xmath1/@xmath2   ratio indeed show a cone morphology but the behaviour is the opposite of what expected , i.e. the excitation within the cone is lower than in the surroundings and the h@xmath20/pa@xmath41 ratio increases up to @xmath94 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : line]d ) . two processes could be responsible for the enhanced @xmath2  emission  either shocks caused by the interaction between the supernova - driven wind and the interstellar medium or exposure to a strong x - ray dominated photon flux emitted by the agn .",
    "but in any case there is absolutely no indication of the strong uv flux which produces `` standard '' agn ionization cones .",
    "we find , therefore , no evidence for the expected agn markers in our nicmos data .",
    "although no trace of its presence has been found in these data , the existence of an obscured agn in the nucleus of ngc 4945 is unquestionably indicated by the x - rays ( iwasawa et al .",
    "@xcite , done et al .",
    "recent , high signal - to - noise observations by bepposax ( guainazzi et al .",
    ", @xcite ) have confirmed the previous indications of variability from ginga observations ( iwasawa et al .",
    "@xcite ) : in the 13 - 200 kev band , where the transmitted spectrum is observed , the light curve shows fluctuations with an extrapolated doubling / halving time scale of @xmath95 .",
    "these time scales and amplitudes essentially exclude any known process for producing the high energy x - rays other than accretion onto a supermassive black hole .    making",
    "the 3@xmath96@xmath34@xmath35  observed in the 2 - 10@xmath12  band with bepposax would require about 10000 of the most luminous x - ray binaries observed in our galaxy ( e.g. scorpio - x1 ) and only a few of this objects are known .    alternatively ,",
    "very hot plasma ( @xmath97 a few @xmath12 ) , due to supernovae , has been observed in the 2 - 10@xmath12  spectrum of starburst galaxies , but at higher energies ( @xmath98 ) the emission is essentially negligible ( cappi et al .",
    "@xcite ; persic et al .",
    "@xcite ) ; whereas the emission of ngc4945 peaks between 30 and 100@xmath12 . also , given that the x - ray emission is observed through a gaseous absorbing column density of a few times @xmath99@xmath36@xmath37 , both the 10000 superluminous x - ray binaries and the very hot sn wind should be hidden by this huge gaseous column .",
    "it is very difficult to find a geometry for the gas distribution that could produce this effect .",
    "we therefore conclude that the presence of an agn provides the only plausible origin of the hard x - ray emission .",
    "the above considerations combined with the absence of any evidence for the presence of an agn at other wavelengths has important consequences irrespective of the relative , and unknown , contributions of the starburst and agn to the total bolometric luminosity .",
    "this is illustrated below by considering the extreme possibilities that the luminosity is dominated either by the starburst or the agn .",
    "most previous studies have concluded that the fir emission in ngc 4945 can be attributed solely to starburst activity ( e.g. koornneef @xcite , moorwood & oliva @xcite ) without invoking the presence of an agn .",
    "we note that , on average , active galaxies are characterized by @xmath100 ratios much larger than starbursts and this fact was sometimes invoked to discern starbursts from agns ( see the discussion in genzel et al .",
    "@xcite ) . in this",
    "regard , ngc 4945 has a starburst - like ratio : @xmath101 ( from observed @xmath1  with @xmath69=15mag ) .",
    "this is similar to the value for the prototypical starburst galaxy m82 ( @xmath102 , rieke et al .",
    "@xcite ) , suggesting that the fir emission of ngc 4945 may arise from the starburst .",
    "genzel et al .",
    "( @xcite ) showed that , when considering the reddening correction derived from the mid - ir  usually much larger than from the optical and near - ir  the observed h line emission from the starburst translates into an ionizing luminosity comparable to the fir luminosity . indeed ,",
    "if in ngc 4945 the bulk of h emission is hidden by just @xmath69=45mag , @xmath103 and the observed starburst activity is entirely responsible for the fir .",
    "although all the bolometric luminosity could be generated by a starburst it is also possible to construct starburst models which are consistent with the observed near infrared properties but generate a much lower total luminosity .",
    "it is important to recall that @xmath104 represents the ratio between star formation rates averaged over two different timescales , i.e. @xmath105yrs and @xmath106yrs , respectively .",
    "therefore , this ratio strongly depends on the past star formation history .",
    "for example , objects which have not experienced star formation in the past @xmath107yrs will emit little @xmath74 , but significant fir radiation .",

    "we have considered two extreme cases of star formation history .",

    "panel 1 shows the evolution of the ionizing photon rate ( @xmath112 ) as a function of time after the beginning of the burst .",
    "the shaded region limits the values compatible with the observations ; @xmath112  is estimated from the total @xmath1  flux in the nicmos images ( @xmath113 ) , dereddened with @xmath114mag and @xmath115mag and converted using case b approximation for h recombinations .",
    "panel 2 gives the equivalent width of @xmath74  ( @xmath116 ) ; the observed value outlined by the shaded area is a lower limit for the starburst models and was derived by rescaling the observed @xmath1flux and dividing by the flux observed in the same aperture with the f222 m filter .",
    "panel 3 is the evolution of the supernova rate ( snr ) .",
    "estimates of snr from radio observations suggest values @xmath117 ( koornneef @xcite ) , @xmath118 ( forbes & norris @xcite ) , down to 0.05@xmath119@xmath35 ( moorwood & oliva @xcite ) . the shaded region covers the 0.01 - 0.4@xmath119@xmath35  range .",
    "panel 4 is the mechanical luminosity produced by the supernovae .",
    "finally , panels 5 and 6 give the k - band and bolometric luminosity , respectively .",
    "the allowed range for the k monochromatic luminosity is given by the total observed flux in a @xmath42 aperture centered on the k peak where photospheric emission from supergiants is known to dominate ( oliva et al .",
    "the upper and lower limits represent the values obtained after dereddening by @xmath114mag and @xmath115mag .",
    "the upper limit to the bolometric luminosity is the _ total _ ngc 4945 luminosity derived from iras observations ( rice et al .",

    "the thin dotted line represents the time at which the properties of the instantaneous burst meet the observational constraints .",

    "it is clear from the figure that an instantaneous burst of @xmath121 is capable of meeting all the observational constraints .",
    "it reproduces the correct supernova rate and k band luminosity and its bolometric luminosity dominates the total bolometric luminosity of the galaxy .",
    "conversely the continuous burst fails to reproduce the snr and k luminosity . just considering these two models alone it is tempting to infer that the starburst powers the bolometric emission of ngc4945 .",
    "however , the instantaneous and continuous sfr are two extreme and simplistic cases .",
    "more realistically the sf history is more complex since bursts have a finite and limited length or are the combination of several different events .",

    "the starburst model meets all the observational constraints : @xmath112  is provided for by the continuous burst while snr and k luminosity come from the instantaneous burst .",
    "the important difference with respect to the single instantaneous burst is that the bolometric luminosity of the burst is now @xmath124 of the total bolometric luminosity of the galaxy .",
    "the mechanical luminosity injected by the sn in the `` instantaneous '' burst ( which dominates also in the double burst model ) is @xmath125 over @xmath126 .",

    "as shown in the next section , the observed ( @xmath131/@xmath132 ) ratio of ngc 4945 is equal to that of a `` normal '' agn in which the @xmath131  is reprocessed uv radiation .",
    "if the @xmath131  in ngc 4945 is actually dominated by the starburst , therefore , it is clear that the agn must be strongly deficient in uv relative to x - rays .    in this starburst - dominant scenario for ngc4945 , with the black hole mass inferred from the @xmath87  maser measurements ( greenhill .",

    "though a careful treatment requires a full radiation transfer calculation , this simple plot demonstrates that ( i ) the redder color of ngc 4945 with respect to circinus can be explained with extra absorption and ( ii ) that this is not energetically incompatible with the observed fir luminosity , i.e. the absorbed mid - ir emission re - radiated in the fir does not exceed the observed points .    if the fir emission is powered by the agn this is uv radiation re - processed by dust .",

    "this is in contrast with the standard unified model of agn where ionizing radiation escapes along directions close to the torus axis .",
    "if the agn is embedded in a thick dusty medium then two effects will contribute to its obscuration .",

    "( @xcite ) compared mid - ir spectra of ultra luminous iras galaxies ( ulirgs , see sanders & mirabel @xcite for a review ) with those of agn and starburst templates .",
    "they concluded that the absence of high excitation lines ( e.g. @xmath163 $ ] ) and the presence of pah features undiluted by strong thermal continuum in ulirgs spectra strongly suggest that the starburst component is dominant .",
    "they also show that , after a proper extinction correction , the observed star formation activity can power fir emission . in their papers , ngc 4945 is classified as a starburst because of its mid - ir properties but , as shown in the previous section , ngc 4945 could also be powered by a highly obscured agn and the same scenario could in principle apply to all ulirgs .",
    "their bolometric emission can be powered by an active nucleus completely obscured even at mid - ir wavelengths .",
    "the same argument could be used for the sources detected at submillimeter wavelengths by scuba which can be considered as the high redshift counterpart of local ulirgs .",
    "if they are powered by hidden active nuclei then their enormous fir emission would not require star formation rates in excess of @xmath176 ( e.g. hughes et al .",
    "@xcite ) , and this would have important consequences for understanding the history of star formation in high redshift galaxies .",
    "in addition , it is well known that in order to explain the x - ray background a large fraction of obscured agn is required",
    ". however gilli et al .",
    "( @xcite ) have shown that , in order to reconcile the observed x - ray background with hard x - ray counts , a rapidly evolving population of hard x - ray sources is required up to redshift @xmath177 .",
    "no such population is known at the moment and the only class of objects which are known to undergo such a rapid density evolution are local ulirgs ( kim et al .",
    "@xcite ) and , at higher redshift , the scuba sources ( smail et al .",
    "scuba sources are therefore candidates to host a population of highly obscured agns .",
    "almaini et al .",
    "( @xcite ) suggest that , if the sed of high redshift agn is similar to those observed locally , one can explain 1020% of the 850@xmath48  scuba sources at 1 mjy",
    ". this fraction could be significantly higher if a large population of agn are compton thick at x - ray wavelengths .",
    "trentham , blain & goldader ( @xcite ) show that if the scuba sources are completely powered by a dust enshrouded agn then they may help in explaining the discrepancy between the local density in super massive black holes and the high redshift agn component ( see also fabian & iwasawa @xcite ) .",
    "establishing the nature of scuba sources could be extremely difficult if the embedded agns are like ngc4945 , i.e. completely obscured in all directions , because they would then not be identifiable with the standard optical / ir diagnostics .",
    "incidentally , this fact could possibly account for the sparse detections of type 2 agns at high redshifts ( akiyama et al .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "the best possibility for the detection of ngc4945-like agns is via their hard x - ray emission but , unfortunately , the sensitivity of existing x - ray surveys is still not high enough to detect high @xmath178 agn and the low spatial resolution makes identifications uncertain in the case of faint optical / near - ir counterparts .",
    "moreover , hard x - rays alone are not enough to establish if the agn dominates the bolometric emission .",
    "our new hst nicmos observations of ngc 4945 , complemented by new ground based near and mid - ir observations , have provided detailed morphology of the nuclear region . in @xmath1",
    ", we detect a 100pc - scale starburst ring while in @xmath2  we trace the walls of a conical cavity blown by supernova driven winds .",
    "the continuum images are strongly affected by dust extinction but show that even at hst resolution and sensitivity , the nucleus is completely obscured by a dust lane with an elongated , disk - like morphology .",
    "we detect neither a strong point source nor dilution in co stellar features , expected signs of agn activity .",
    "whereas all the infrared properties of ngc 4945 are consistent with starburst activity , its strong and variable hard x - ray emission can not be plausibly accounted for without the presence also of an agn .",
    "although the starburst must contribute to the total bolometric luminosity we have shown , using starburst models , that the actual amount is dependent on the star formation history . a major contribution from the agn",
    "is thus not excluded .",
    "irrespective of the assumption made , however , our most important conclusion is that the observed variable hard x - ray emission combined with the lack of evidence for reprocessed uv radiation in the infrared is incompatible with the `` standard '' agn model .",
    "if the agn dominates the bolometric luminosity , then its uv radiation must be totally obscured along all lines of sight .",
    "if the starburst dominates then the agn must be highly deficient in its uv relative to x - ray emission .",
    "the former case clearly raises the possibility that a larger fraction of ulirgs than currently thought could actually be agn rather than starburst powered .",

    "<S> however , the absence of any signature other than in the hard x - rays implies that , in both scenarios , the agn is non - standard : if it dominates , it must be obscured in all directions , conversely , if the starburst dominates , the agn must lack uv photons with respect to x - rays .    </S>",
    "<S> an important conclusion is that powerful agns can be hidden even at mid - infrared wavelengths and , therefore , the nature of luminous dusty galaxies can not be always characterized by long - wavelength data alone but must be complemented with sensitive hard x - ray observations . </S>"
