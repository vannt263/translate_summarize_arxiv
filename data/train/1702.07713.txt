    "in anechoic environments , audio source separation with a microphone array can be achieved by beamforming and post - filtering @xcite . on the other hand , in reverberant environments , reverberation causes significant degradation in the quality and intelligibility of the beamformer output , especially if the room impulse responses ( rir ) are not taken into account or are not known precisely .",
    "this is a serious limitation because in practice , rirs are usually not known with precision and they can vary wildly with respect to the positions of the microphone / source pair .",
    "a related problem addressing reverberation without explicit rir knowledge is called blind dereverberation @xcite . a successful class of methods for blind dereverberation fall under the framework of multi - channel linear prediction ( mclp ) @xcite .",
    "these methods require a microphone array and employ linear prediction to extract information about the properties of reverberation . in this paper",
    ", we propose to employ mclp , which is primarily used for single source dereverberation , as a pre - processing step in source separation .",
    "we show theoretically and demonstrate numerically that such a scheme not only dereverberates the sources but also helps in the subsequent separation .    in order to make this statement more precise ,",
    "let us briefly discuss an mclp formulation . consider an array of microphones , recording a source in a reverberant room .",
    "recent mclp formulations @xcite select one of the microphones as the reference and use delayed versions of the whole set of observations to linearly predict the reference signal .",
    "the residual of prediction , which may also be interpreted as the ` innovations ' component , forms the dereverberated estimate of the source . in our scenario",
    ", we have multiple sources recorded with a microphone array and we would like to separate and dereverberate the sources . for this , suppose we apply mclp for each possible choice of the reference microphone .",
    "if we have @xmath0  microphones in the array , this results in @xmath0 hopefully dereverberant but mixed observations .",
    "we say ` hopefully dereverberant ' because the use of mclp has previously been considered and justified solely for the case of a single source @xcite .",
    "further , even if the mclp outputs thus obtained are dereverberated , in order to achieve separation , we have to know the relation between the recordings . in this paper , we show that , under a mild assumption on the rirs , mclp actually suppresses reflections other than the direct source and preserves the phase of the direct source .",
    "therefore , the mclp preprocessing step essentially reduces the reverberant separation problem to an anechoic one .",
    "this greatly simplifies the separation step because we can now use the known array geometry to estimate the direction of arrival and perform separation using this estimate .",
    "we argue that this effect is not dependent on the following doa estimation and separation algorithms . in that sense , the proposed mclp stage complements currently available source separation algorithms , improving their performance .",
    "consequently , we do not have any reservations about which method to use following the mclp stage .",
    "nevertheless , for the sake of completeness , we include a brief description of the geometric source separation ( gss ) algorithm @xcite followed by a post - filter .",
    "literature on dereverberation / source separation with a microphone array is vast . here",
    ", we focus on blind methods for dereverberation and source separation for arrays with a known geometry .    for source separation ,",
    "provided the directions of arrival ( doa ) of the sources are known , and reverberation is limited , beamformers like the minimum variance distortionless response ( mvdr ) beamformer , along with a post - filter @xcite can be effective . in mvdr ,",
    "one aims to minimize the energy of the reconstructed signals , while preserving the signals from the doas .",
    "however , reverberation causes a source to contribute to different directions , reducing the effectiveness of such approaches .",
    "geometric source separation ( gss ) @xcite addresses this problem by also enforcing statistical independence of the reconstructed sources .",
    "this is achieved by selecting the beamformer weights so as to minimize a cost function that consists of the sum of a term imposing geometric constraints based solely on the array geometry and a term that promotes the statistical independence of the sources ( motivated by blind source separation techniques @xcite ) . in practice ,",
    "gss outputs are still reverberant for moderate to highly reverberant rooms .",
    "gss has been complemented with a post - filter in @xcite to devise a high performance source - separation method that can operate in real time .",
    "an alternative approach , based on the assumption that the activity of the different sources do not overlap in the time - frequency domain @xcite , has been proposed in @xcite .",
    "however , the model in @xcite assumes that the room impulse responses are relatively short , compared to the analysis window size used in the stft .    despite its simplicity , blind dereverberation is a challenging problem due mainly to the characteristics of room impulse responses . for a general overview and discussion of relatively recent methods ,",
    "we refer to the edited book @xcite . here , we focus on a successful class of methods that can be collected under the heading ` multichannel linear prediction ' ( mclp ) , as they are more directly related to the content of our work .",
    "these methods usually fit in a schema as follows .",
    "given multiple observations @xmath1 , for @xmath2 , one of the observations is chosen as the reference .",
    "then , this reference observation is linearly predicted by the delayed version of all of the observations .",
    "once the linear prediction coefficients are determined , this information has been used differently in prior work .",
    "for instance , in @xcite , the authors use the coefficients to estimate the power of late reverberations , which are subsequently reduced by spectral subtraction . in more recent work",
    "@xcite , the residual of linear prediction is taken as the dereverbed audio signal .",
    "prior work also differentiates based on the criteria used for determining the weights used in linear estimation . in @xcite , the authors propose to select the linear estimation weights so as to minimize the energy of the residual . in @xcite ,",
    "the source signal is modeled as a time - varying gaussian process and the weights are selected so as to maximize the likelihood of such a model .",
    "more recently , @xcite employ a sparsity- based model in the time - frequency domain and select the weights so that the residual minimizes a sparsity promoting cost function .    an interesting approach that employs mclp to achieve suppression of late reverberation and source separation",
    "is presented in @xcite .",
    "the authors use mclp to suppress late reverberation , using a statistical framework similar to that in @xcite .",
    "in contrast to @xcite , a time - varying scenario with multiple sources is considered and the mclp weights are determined along with the statistics of the late reverberant part of the sources in an iterative manner .",
    "our proposal in this paper is of a complementary nature and is likely to improve the performance of existing separation algorithms .",
    "we present an inventive way to employ mclp as a pre - processing step for blind source separation using a microphone array .",
    "we show theoretically that , under certain assumptions , such a pre - processing step converts the reverberant source separation problem into a non - reverberant one , which in turn can be solved by existing methods such as @xcite outlined above .",
    "such an approach is inherently different than previous uses of mclp which aim to dereverb a single source as in @xcite .",
    "our proposal also differs from that of @xcite because @xcite requires the source statistics to cancel the late reverberation and thus resorts to a joint estimation of the linear prediction weights and source statistics .",
    "this approach in @xcite requires an iterative procedure and is handled with an em algorithm .",
    "in contrast , we propose to employ the mclp step once , in order to reduce the reverberant problem to an approximately non - reverberant one .",
    "in addition to theoretical justification , we demonstrate the validity of the claims using real recordings . for the sake of completeness",
    ", we include a description of gss along with a simple post - filter , to be applied following the mclp step , in order to achieve separation .",
    "however , after mclp , other methods that assume short rirs , or operate under a free propagation model may also be used , as noted above .",
    "sequences and continuous functions of time are denoted with a small letter as in @xmath3 or @xmath4 , respectively .",
    "the dft and stft of sequences are denoted with a capital letter as @xmath5 and @xmath6 respectively  which one is referred to will be clear from the context .",
    "the @xmath7-transform of sequences are denoted with calligraphic letters as in @xmath8 .",
    "we refer to @xmath8 as ` causal ' if it is a polynomial of @xmath9 . for a causal @xmath8 ,",

    "throughout the paper , we are interested in far - field processing .",
    "thus , the distance of the source to the microphones is assumed to be significantly greater than the array size .",
    "our proposed formulation / algorithm is in the stft domain .",
    "however , for simplicity of exposition , we first introduce a model in the continuous - time domain and then present an approximation of this model in the stft domain .",
    "we introduce the time - domain model in three stages , where complexity increases with each stage .",
    "we start with the case of a single source , single microphone . in the second stage , we consider the single source , multiple microphone case . finally , we discuss the multiple source , multiple microphone case , which is the main scenario of interest in this paper .      for a given microphone - source pair ,",

    "the observation @xmath14 can be approximated as , @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the room impulse response ( rir ) for the given source - microphone positions .",
    "now suppose that the distance from the source to the microphone is @xmath17 meters and the speed of sound in the environment is @xmath18 m / sec .",
    "then , the acoustic signal emitted by the source reaches the microphone after a delay of @xmath19 seconds .",
    "we declare the _ distance compensated room impulse response _ ( dcir ) to be @xmath20 notice that for practical purposes , we can work with the dcir instead of the rir for a single microphone - source setup . for multiple microphones or sources ,",
    "we need to take into account relative distances , as discussed next .",
    "consider a setup consisting of a microphone array and a source as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : setup ] .",

    "notice that @xmath27 may be positive or negative , i.e. , may represent an advance or delay .",
    "finally , let the dcir from the source to the @xmath22 microphone be denoted as @xmath28 .",
    "then , we model the observation at the @xmath22 microphone , namely @xmath1 , as , @xmath29 the far field assumption amounts to the following : if the distance of the source to the center of the array is @xmath17 , then the distance of the source to the @xmath22 microphone is approximately @xmath30 . under the far - field assumption",
    ", the described model preserves the ability of the array to differentiate different directions .",
    "we next add another layer to this model by considering multiple sources .",
    "suppose now that there are @xmath12 sources and @xmath0 microphones .",
    "let the @xmath31 source signal be denoted by @xmath32 . also , let the unit vector in the direction of the @xmath31 source be denoted by @xmath33 . for the @xmath22 microphone , positioned at @xmath21 , we set @xmath34",
    ". finally , let @xmath35 denote the dcir between the @xmath31 source and the @xmath22 microphone .",
    "then , we model the observation at the @xmath22 microphone as , @xmath36 notice that , the absolute delay from the @xmath31 source is not included in the model",

[ item : contained ] if the support of @xmath48 is contained in the support of @xmath49 , then @xmath50 where @xmath5 denotes the dft of @xmath48 . b.   if the support of @xmath48 is significantly larger than the support of @xmath49 , then @xmath51 for some @xmath52 , where @xmath53 denotes convolution with respect to the time variable @xmath54 , defined as @xmath55 we remark that @xmath52 is not necessarily the stft of @xmath48 , but is chosen so as to make the approximation as close as possible ",

    "therefore , the model introduced in can be approximated in the stft domain as @xmath59    such a model is preferred over the time domain model because prior or penalty functions that enforce ( structured ) sparsity of the audio signals are typically defined in the stft ( or some other time - frequency ) domain . if we use the time domain convolutional model in an iterative algorithm , we have to work in the time domain to undo the effects of reverberation , and the stft domain to take advantage of the signal prior . switching from the time domain representation to the stft representation at each iteration increases the computational cost significantly . working with a convolutional model directly in the stft domain , such as , allows to carry out the iterations in the stft domain , eliminating the need to apply the forward and inverse stft operations at each iteration .",
    "in this section , we discuss the implications of using multi - channel linear prediction ( mclp ) as a preliminary step for the source separation problem . we derive conditions under which mclp transforms the original blind separation / dereverberation problem to a non - blind one .",
