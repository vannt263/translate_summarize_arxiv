    "the effects of lattice vibrations on the electronic properties of metals is a well studied branch of condensed matter physics .",
    "these effects include specific heat enhancements , strong thermal contributions to the electrical resistivity , and in some materials , superconductivity at low temperatures .",
    "there remain , however , some outstanding problems in the field . for example",
    ", the extensive studies of small polaron formation , based on the model from the pioneering work of holstein  @xcite , have given a very precise understanding of systems with one or two electrons present , but there are no comparable results for systems with a finite electron density .",
    "there are also many strongly correlated electron systems , such as heavy fermions or valence fluctuations systems , where there is known to be strong coupling between the electrons and the lattice vibrations , in addition to the strong inter - electron interactions .",
    "the interplay of phonon and electron effects in these systems has not received much attention .",
    "the reason for the lack of progress with these problems is due to the fact there are no reliable calculational techniques in the strong coupling regime , where standard perturbational methods break down .",
    "some non - perturbational techniques have been developed and successfully applied to strongly correlated impurity models but in general these can not be extended to models of lattice systems .",
    "however , with the introduction of dynamical mean field theory ( dmft )  @xcite , it has proved possible to extend some of these non - perturbative techniques to a wide class of lattice models .",
    "this approach exploits the fact that certain infinite dimensional lattice models can be mapped onto effective impurity models , together with a self - consistency condition  @xcite .",
    "the calculations for the effective impurity models can be carried out using an appropriate non - perturbative method and iterated until self - consistency is achieved . though the method is exact in the large dimensionality limit for an appropriately scaled model  @xcite , the method can be applied to a much wider class of models and there is evidence that it provides a very good first order approximation for three dimensional systems .",
    "( it clearly breaks down for one - dimensional systems but one - dimensional systems are a class apart . )",
    "not all techniques for solving strongly correlated impurity models can be used for the effective impurity models generated through the application of dmft .",
    "the methods must be able to handle the dynamical properties of the impurity models , which rules out techniques such as the bethe ansatz .",
    "the method which has been used most extensively for this type of calculation is the quantum monte carlo method ( qmc ) .",
    "this approach , however , does have the drawback of not being capable of being applied to the very low temperature regime . a method which can be used at @xmath0 is the numerical renormalization group approach ( nrg ) .",
    "as developed originally by wilson for the kondo model  @xcite it was used only for the calculation of thermodynamic quantities but the approach was extended later to the calculation of the dynamic properties of impurity models  @xcite , which is required to be able to use the method in conjunction with dmft for lattice models . the dmft approach together with the nrg has been applied to the half - filled hubbard model to study the metal - insulator transition at @xmath0  @xcite , and these calculations have recently been extended to finite temperatures  @xcite .",
    "our goal is to extend this approach to include the effects of coupling to local lattice modes , and address some of the outstanding questions concerning the interplay of strong correlation and strong electron - phonon interactions .",
    "the results should provide some insights into the physics of systems such as heavy fermions , valence fluctuators , manganites , and the cuprate high temperature superconductors .",
    "in this paper we perform nrg calculations solely for an impurity model with a coupling to a local phonon mode .",
    "this is a necessary first step to the eventual aim of incorporating the self - consistency constraint of the dmft and the application to models for lattice systems .",
    "we introduce the impurity model in the next section .",
    "the model we study is a single impurity anderson model  @xcite with a linear coupling to a local phonon mode , as in the the holstein model  @xcite .",
    "we will refer to this model as the anderson - holstein ( a - h ) model .",
    "the corresponding hamiltonian for the model is @xmath1 which describes an impurity d level @xmath2 , hybridized with conduction electrons of the host metal via a matrix element @xmath3 , with an interaction term @xmath4 between the electrons in the localized f ( or d ) state , where @xmath5 is the occupation number of this state which is linearly coupled to a local oscillator of frequency @xmath6 .",
    "a very similar model which does not have the interaction term @xmath4 , but does not quite correspond to the a - h model with @xmath7 as the electrons are spinless , has been studied previously  @xcite . both the model with spin and the spin - less model can be solved exactly in the case of one electron only in the system@xcite .",
    "as the interaction @xmath4 does not come into play in this situation the results of both models are essentially equivalent . however , there is no exact solution for the many - electron case even for the spin - less model and @xmath7 .",
    "we will solve the model  ( [ ah ] ) using the numerical renormalization group method .",
    "we will briefly outline the general nrg scheme which is applicable to any impurity model with local interactions and coupling to local bosonic or fermionic fields  @xcite .",
    "the conduction band of the model is logarithmically discretized and mapped onto a semi - infinite linear chain coupled to the impurity at one end such that the hopping matrix elements along the chain fall off exponentially ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "the many - body states and energy levels are calculated iteratively starting from the impurity adding an extra site of the chain in each step .",
    "after about 5 - 6 steps , the number of states has to be truncated to the 300 - 800 lowest ones depending on the application in each step .",
    "this method has been generalized to the calculation of dynamic as well as static properties  @xcite . in applying this approach to the model with phonons ( eq .  ( [ ah ] ) ) ,",
    "a truncation of higher - energy steps is already necessary at the initial step .",
    "the probability distribution function of finding @xmath9 excited phonons in the system has a clear maximum around @xmath10 , as can be read off equation  ( [ atlim ] ) , and falls off rapidly for larger values of @xmath9 .",
    "so it is sufficient to keep only states with @xmath11 where we have chosen an initial @xmath12 .",
    "we have used the discretization parameter @xmath13 , and kept at least 600 states in each iteration ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) .    to calculate the spectral function on the real axis , we need the fourier transform of the double - time one - electron green s function for the local d - electron .",
    "we use this in the standard form , @xmath14 where we have taken the hybridization function @xmath15 to be independent of @xmath16 , corresponding to wide conduction band with a flat density of states .",
    "the self - energy @xmath17 will be calculated , as in reference  @xcite , from the ratio of two green s functions . due to the additional interaction term with the phonon",
    "there are two contributions so that @xmath18 , with @xmath19 where @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the higher order green s functions , @xmath22 details of the derivation of this result from the equations of motion are given in the appendix a. in appendix b , more details regarding the calculation of @xmath23 are presented .",
    "we will also calculate the spectral density of the green s function of the phonon mode , @xmath24 .",
    "this can be expressed in terms of the local charge susceptibility , @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the non - interacting phonon propagator , and @xmath27 with @xmath28 is the local dynamic charge susceptibility .",
    "it will be useful in interpreting the numerical results to compare them with results from perturbation theory in the relevant regimes .",
    "we will set up the general perturbational approach in this section and give specific results later .",
    "starting from expression for the partition function @xmath29 in the form , @xmath30 where @xmath31 is this usual time - ordering operator and @xmath32 is the interaction part of the hamiltonian ( including the hybridization term ) in the interaction representation with @xmath33 as the imaginary time variable and @xmath34 , and @xmath35 denotes a thermal expectation value with respect to the non - interacting part of the hamiltonian .",
    "we can remove explicitly the phonon operators and rewrite ( [ pf ] ) as @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the purely fermionic interaction part of the hamiltonian ( [ ah ] ) and @xmath38 is an additional retarded local fermionic interaction due to the elimination of the phonon terms , which is given by @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the non - interacting phonon green s function in the imaginary time form .",
    "details of this derivation are given in appendix c.    it will be convenient to convert this expression to a path integral over fermionic grassmann variables and integrate out the conduction electrons .",
    "we can then write ( [ pf ] ) in the form , @xmath41 where @xmath42^{-1}f_{\\sigma}(\\tau')+u    n_{\\uparrow}(\\tau)n_{\\downarrow}(\\tau)\\\\    & + { \\lambda^2\\over 2}\\int_0^{\\beta}d\\tau ' d^0(\\tau-\\tau')(\\sum_{\\sigma }    n_\\sigma(\\tau ) -1)(\\sum_{\\sigma ' } n_{\\sigma'}(\\tau ' )",

    "this gives a convenient way of generating the perturbation theory and feynman diagrams for this green s function .",
    "in the limit @xmath48 such that @xmath49 remains finite the effective interaction becomes an instantaneous one equal to @xmath50 .",
    "this interaction term can be absorbed into the standard anderson model with the terms linear in @xmath51 being absorbed by modifying @xmath52 , and the remaining part by changing @xmath4 to @xmath53 . in this way of taking the limit @xmath54 , the ratio @xmath55 .",
    "but there is also a high frequency regime of interest in which both @xmath6 and @xmath56 are large such that @xmath57 .",
    "for this parameter range it is convenient to apply the canonical transformation @xmath58 with @xmath59 given by @xmath60 which is a displaced oscillator transformation such that @xmath61 @xmath62 where @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",
    "the exponential term in the phonon operators , which multiplies the hybridization term , arises because a cloud of phonons may be created or absorbed when the f - electron occupation changes , due to the coupling to the lattice .",
    "if we take the expectation value of this hamiltonian in the zero phonon state @xmath65 then , as @xmath66 , the effective resonance width becomes @xmath67 . for @xmath68 or 3",
    ", this would amount to a significant narrowing of the resonance for the non - interacting model .",
    "this exponential renormalization factor is a common feature of strongly coupled electron - phonon problems but , as was shown in earlier work of hewson and newns  @xcite for the spinless model , this resonance narrowing does not in general occur in the strong coupling regime for this model , but only in a certain parameter regime .    in the zero hybridization limit for the transformed hamiltonian in equation ( [ aht ] )",
    "the electrons and phonons become decoupled .",
    "however in this limit the calculation of the green s function in terms of the original f - electron operators is not trivial , as it involves the unitary transformation @xmath59 but it can be evaluated exactly by using the well known techniques for calculating the expectation values of exponentials with a linear combinations of bose creation and annihilation operators  @xcite .",

    "carried out to order @xmath73 , and analytically continued to real frequency @xmath16 , we obtain @xmath74 where @xmath75 and @xmath76 are the bose - einstein and fermi - dirac distribution functions .",

    "the expression for the narrowing involving the soft phonon mode , @xmath136 with @xmath137 gives a better fit to data .    in the results for the asymmetric model the low energy phonon mode does not develop , and there is no narrow resonance at the fermi - level other than the original kondo peak in the case @xmath122 at zero or small phonon coupling . in the large @xmath90 regime ( @xmath138 ) in the two cases studied there is either a broad peak below the fermi - level corresponding to double occupation , or one above the fermi - level corresponding to zero occupation . for asymmetric conditions the double and zero occupied states are not equally likely , and the local level position @xmath139 for @xmath140 acts like a magnetic field on the isospin suppressing the ` kondo ' resonance .",
    "the same behaviour is observed in the negative-@xmath4 anderson model without phonons .",
    "our conclusions are very much in line with those of hewson and newns in their study of the spinless model  @xcite .",
    "a direct comparison with their work is not possible because no @xmath132-term can be induced by the phonons in the spinless case .",
    "their conclusion was that a significant narrowing of the local resonance could only be induced by strong phonon coupling if the impurity level lies at , or very close to the fermi - level ( intermediate valence regime ) , when the zero or single occupation states of the local level have the same energy , this closely resembles the situation in the model with spin , but in terms of doubly - occupied and the empty states .",
    "we have surveyed the physically interesting parameter regimes of the model using the nrg , and related our results to atomic limit calculations and perturbation theory .",
    "the relevant parameter regime for magnetic impurities systems is expected to be large @xmath4 , with a phonon coupling such @xmath141 , and @xmath142 .",
    "we have taken a relatively large value of @xmath6 ( @xmath143 ) in order to see the features in the spectrum clearly and save computational time ( see appendix b ) , but results for smaller values of @xmath6 were found to be qualitatively similar .",
    "dynamical response functions for impurity systems are difficult to observe experimentally , so it would be interesting to calculate the effects of the phonon coupling on the thermodynamic behaviour which could be more readily compared with experiment .",
    "this we propose to do for a separate publication . as a more realistic model for magnetic impurities",
    "we also intend to include a direct coupling of the phonon mode to the hybridization term , because this term should be rather sensitive to local lattice vibrations .",
    "having taken the first step of calculating the dynamic properties of the impurity model with phonons , we now propose to extend these calculations to lattice models within the framework of the dynamical mean - field theory .",
    "these calculations should be particularly relevant to high-@xmath144 superconductors where recent photoemission experiments give evidence of strong electron - phonon coupling  @xcite .",
    "the electron - lattice coupling is also known to be important for the manganites  @xcite .",
    "the calculation could be extended to a model for these systems by including a coupling to a local spin  @xcite , which would require only a generalization of the impurity part of the hamiltonian .",
    "the calculation could also be extended to include a dispersive phonon mode .",
    "this would require the introduction of a second chain of states , but then only a lower proportion of states could be kept in each iteration .",
    "we wish to thank to the epsrc for the support of a research grant ( gr / j85349 ) , and the newton institute , cambridge , where this work was initiated during their six - month programme on ` strongly correlated electron systems ' .",
    "we also thank simon bradley for his work in the development stage of the nrg program and ralf bulla for helpful discussions .",
    "we can use the standard equation of motion for the fourier transform of the double - time green s function , @xmath145_\\eta \\rangle+\\langle\\langle [ a , h]_{-},b    \\rangle\\rangle_{\\omega}\\ ] ] to derive the expression for the self - energy given in equation  ( [ eq : sigma ] ) , we choose @xmath146 and @xmath147 and @xmath148 as these are fermion operators .",

    "to evaluate the green s function @xmath21 , and hence the self - energy @xmath166 , we need to calculate the matrix elements of the operator @xmath167 .",
    "we can classify the states according to total charge and total spin quantum numbers @xmath168,@xmath169 and @xmath170 , and an additional index @xmath171 or @xmath172 , and we define reduced matrix elements using the wigner - eckart theorem in the usual way .",
    "the bose operators only enter explicitly in the calculation at the impurity site .",
    "let the basis states used for this calculation be denoted by @xmath173 where @xmath9 denotes the occupation number for the bose states , and @xmath172 is an additional index .",
    "after diagonalization the exact eigenstates at the impurity site can be written in the form @xmath174 , where @xmath171 no longer denotes the number of bosons , which are not conserved by the interaction term , so @xmath171 is a general index .",
    "we need the reduced matrix elements between these eigenstates , @xmath175 .",
    "if @xmath176 then @xmath177 as latexmath:[$\\langle q , s , n , r||f^{}_\\sigma    deduce the values of @xmath175 after diagonalization at the impurity site .",
    "once we have these initial values the equations at all later steps will take the same form as those for @xmath179 .",
    "the spectral density @xmath180 of the green s function @xmath181 is given by @xmath182 where @xmath183 and @xmath29 is the partition function .",
    "when expressed in terms of reduced matrix elements it takes exactly the same form as the spectral density for @xmath184 except that the reduced matrix element @xmath175 replaces @xmath179 . +",

    "the number of eigenstates of an impurity site coupled to a local phonon mode ( the atomic limit  ( [ atlim ] ) ) , is already infinite .",
    "so a cutoff of higher - energy states is already necessary at the initial step of the nrg procedure .",
    "the probability distribution function to find @xmath9 excited phonons in the system has a clear maximum around @xmath10 , as can be read off equation  ( [ atlim ] ) , and falls off rapidly for larger values of @xmath9 .",
