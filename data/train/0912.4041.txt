    "since their discovery  @xcite in 1985 , fullerenes have been the subject of intense studies , both experimentally and theoretically .",
    "these clusters have been identified as roughly spherical carbon `` cages '' .",
    "the fullerene family includes molecules ranging from the ( probably unstable ) @xmath0 to fullerenes which contain hundreds or even thousands of carbon atoms .",
    "the most stable fullerenes are the soccer ball - like @xmath1 ( also known as _ buckyball _ ) and the @xmath2 .",
    "all fullerenes have in common the same principal structure : they are composed of @xmath3-hybridized carbon atoms , therefore being closely related to graphite . however , since they are not planar , they ca nt be made up entirely of hexagons .",
    "the spherical structure is typically achieved by insertion of pentagons .",
    "also carbon nanotubes  @xcite , discovered 1991 , have a similar structure ",
    "the main difference to fullerenes is the enormous aspect ratio ( length vs. diameter ) .",
    "nanotubes can be interpreted as rolled - up graphite sheets , where the precise procedure of rolling - up decides about the electronic structure of the nanotubes ( metallic or semiconducting ) .",
    "so in the absence of defects , nanotubes are composed entirely of hexagons  except the caps which close the tubes .    in the language of classical geometry",
    ", fullerenes can be described as polyhedrons , so euler theorem applies : for an arbitrary polyhedron with @xmath4 vertices , @xmath5 edges and @xmath6 faces , the euler characteristic @xmath7 is an invariant , for all simple polyhedrons , @xmath8 . from this theorem",
    "it can be deduced that any structure which is topologically equivalent to a sphere and only composed of @xmath9 hexagons , @xmath10 pentagons and @xmath11 heptagons must fulfill @xmath12 with arbitrary @xmath9 .",
    "so all fullerene molecules will contain exactly 12 pentagons ( unless there are heptagons present to compensate for a higher number of pentagons ) .",
    "therefore , @xmath13 is indeed the smallest possible fullerene , composed of 12 pentagons and no hexagons at all .",
    "since pentagons induce stress , structures which contain adjacent pentagons show reduced stability ( _ isolated pentagon rule _ , ipr ) .",
    "obviously , for less then @xmath14 atoms there is no possibility to avoid this occurrence , and also for @xmath15 atoms no structure exists which fulfills the ipr . in perfect icosahedral @xmath16 two pentagons",
    "are always separated from each other by one hexagon , this is the most stable configuration , followed by the rugby - ball like @xmath17 which again fulfills the pentagon rule .",
    "further increasing the number of atoms does not enhance stability .",
    "multiple adjacent hexagons show a graphite - like structure that is more severely disturbed by the pentagons the bigger the molecule gets .",
    "so the yield of those fullerenes ( for example at arc discharges ) is again much smaller than that of @xmath16 or @xmath17 .",
    "a natural tool to study the dynamics of fullerene systems is molecular dynamics ( md ) , where the equations of motion for the nuclei are integrated numerically@xcite .",
    "the most important difference between various types of md simulations is the way to implement the interaction between the nuclei .    depending on whether the electronic structure is simulated by ab - initio methods@xcite , tight - binding methods  @xcite or by more or less elaborate force fields , the accessible system sizes and simulation times vary dramatically .",
    "while there is a wide variety of force - field approaches , certain forms are particularly well - suited for the simulation of ( hydro-)carbon systems : building on the approach of abell and tersoff@xcite , donald w. brenner has developed a potential@xcite for hydrocarbons that is closely related to the potentials obtained in the embedded atom methods ( eam ) .",
    "it contains empirical parameters which were fitted to reproduce the properties of hydrocarbons as well as those of carbon in diamond and graphite .",
    "its first use was the study of chemical vapor deposition , but found widespread use in various simulations of carbon - based materials .",
    "this potential has been incorporated in the brennermd code@xcite , which was used for the simulations of sec .",
    "[ sec : simulation ] .",
    "md studies of fullerenes by now encompass a broad range of topics , among others    * studies of nanotube growth@xcite , * charge structure of nanotube growth from small clusters@xcite , * nanotube cap formation and energetics  @xcite , * reactive collision of graphite patches@xcite which lead to formation of the nuclei of nanotube , nanocage and other structures , * collisions between fullerenes@xcite and between fullerenes and other molecules@xcite , * the impact of fullerenes on graphite materials  @xcite , * formation of diamond crystallites inside nested carbon fullerenes.@xcite    a more comprehensive overview has been given elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "most interesting in the context of the present article are those studies which deal with formation and fragmentation of fullerenes or fullerene - like structures .    fullerene stability and fragmentation mechanism have been investigated with a variety of computational methods  @xcite , in particular with tight - binding methods .",
    "there @xmath18 turned out to be stable against spontaneous disintegration for temperatures up to @xmath19@xcite .",
    "similar results have been obtained for other @xmath20-systems.@xcite .",
    "most common fragmentation products are dimers , rings and chains ; the fragmentation temperature first increases linearly with cluster size , but becomes nearly constant for fullerenes composed of 60 or more atoms .",
    "other simulations@xcite find structural changes in @xmath21 and c@xmath22 between @xmath23 and @xmath24 and bond breaking around @xmath19 .",
    "for the melting and evaporation of @xmath13 , @xmath16 and @xmath25 one finds@xcite a transition from the low - temperature solid to a floppy  pretzel phase  , melting at about @xmath26k and conversion to carbon chain fragments when increasing the temperature to @xmath27k .",
    "a notable feature of disintegration is the ejection of small clusters@xcite ( in particular @xmath28 , sometimes also @xmath29 ) already below the melting temperature .",
    "similar results for desintegration and cage formation have been obtained using the tersoff@xcite or brenner@xcite potential .",
    "when , studying fullerene formation and using monocyclic , bicyclic , and tricyclic rings as precursors@xcite , the most efficient temperature for the formation of the cage - shaped structure from a ring is about 3000 k. also the growth process of higher fullerenes through adduction of small carbon clusters and carbon atoms has been studied@xcite : in this case small clusters and single atoms easily adsorb on the surface of fullerene cages which have defects , on collisions at thermal velocities ; during an annealing process , the attached clusters are soon incorporated into the network of the fullerene cages .    summarizing these results , most studies find that during the annealing process , one has a sequence of typical steps :    * for very high temperatures , one has a gas of single atoms or dimers .",
    "+ * when cooling down , the dimers tend to form chains that stay short first , but grow to length of @xmath30 atoms below @xmath31k .",
    "this phase ( `` pretzel phase''@xcite ) can be interpreted as liquid - like . + * below @xmath32k most chains begin to form vaguely spherical structures where most atoms establish an additional bond to reach carbon s favored coordination number of three . in particular , hexagons , which are sign of locally graphite respectively fullerene - like structures , form . +",
    "* the precise transition temperature for the change to fullerenes of course depends on the model employed for interaction , but the growth and removal of defects seem to be most efficient around @xmath33",
    ". +    the resulting structures are typically graphite- or fullerene - like with lots of defects .",
    "the number of defects can be reduced by slow annealing , and it has been possible ( e.g. by isolating a fullerene precursor ) to obtain perfect fullerene molecules in some simulations .",
    "all these simulations still have a severe drawback , the times accessible by these simulations are still short compared to the timescales relevant for most physical processes relevant for the formation of fullerenes , which is supposed to happen at @xmath34 .",
    "simulations , however , can reach in the case of rather small systems with severely restricted types of force fields at most @xmath35 . in the present paper",
    "we address the question , whether this shortcoming can be compensated by the choice of an appropriate annealing strategy .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : after the introduction to fullerenes ( sec .",
    "[ ssec : intro_fullerenes ] ) and corresponding molecular dynamics simulations ( sec .",
    "[ ssec : intro_moldyn ] ) , we turn to the basic simulation setup , described in section  [ sec : simulation ] .    our analysis tools are described in section  [ sec : analysis ] , where we discuss distribution of coordination number in sec .",
    "[ ssec : analysis_coord ] and polygon numbers in sec .",
    "[ ssec : analysis_polygon ] . in sec .",
    "[ sec : results ] we present and discuss our results ; in sec .",
    "[ sec : summary ] we summarize them and give a brief outlook .",
    "even with modern computing power , the times accessible to md simulations are still short compared to the timescales relevant for most physical processes to be studied by this method .",
    "this also applies to the formation of fullerenes , which is supposed to happen at @xmath36 while simulations are typically limited to @xmath37 , since one elementary md step corresponds to @xmath38 . at best ( studying small systems with cheap and thus severely restricted types of force fields )",
    "one can reach @xmath35 .",
    "one might expect that this shortcoming can be partially compensated by the choice of an appropriate annealing strategy , e.g. if repeated heating - cooling cycles can significantly improve the fullerene yield  and this is the main question to be studied in this article .",
    "we have simulated the annealing of carbon gas from @xmath27k to room temperature .",
    "the simulations have been performed using the brennermd code@xcite , which makes use of langevin dynamics , employing the fungimol graphical user interface@xcite .",
    "an example for such type of simulation is shown in fig .  [ fig1:annealing ] ( 4024 carbon atoms in a box of @xmath39 with a simulation time of @xmath40ps ) .",
    "the cooling was done in decrements of @xmath41 with 5000 thermalization timesteps of @xmath42 length in between .",
    "so the total simulation lasted @xmath43 plus a few femtoseconds of initialization steps without thermostat .",
    "the typical stages discussed in sec .  [ ssec : intro_moldyn ] are clearly visible here : the dimer stage , the liquid - like chain phase , the emergence of triple - bound atoms which tend to form planar structures and thus the formation of fullerene - like structures .",
    "of course many defects occur even in the graphite- or fullerene - like structures ; a significant amount of atoms is still contained in long chains even after cooling to room temperature .",
    "these chains have ( at least for even numbers of atoms ) higher ground - state energy than ring - based structures ( including graphite , graphene and fullerenes ) , but they seem to form easier and are favorable at high temperatures due to entropic reasons .    during the annealing process they should convert to smaller rings , but here this is often impossible because of the rapid cooling process .",
    "there are some similarities to the formation of an amorphous state via rapid cooling . if  in a very similar setup ",
    "the monotonic decrease of temperature is replaced by repeated heating an cooling cycles , the final state typically looks like the one illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : simex_heatcool ] .     atoms ) [ fig : simex_heatcool],width=294 ]    one still has a considerable amount of long chains , but now they are wound up and enclosed by roughly fullerene - like graphitic cages .",
    "the resulting structures can be interpreted as partially frozen droplets with a solid shell , but a liquid core .      in order to characterize the influence of annealing strategies in a systematic way",
    ", we have repeatedly performed several simulations , employing different annealing strategies . in all these simulations",
    "the system consists 720 carbon atoms , initially distributed on a simple cubic lattice in a box of @xmath44 .",
    "all simulations start with some initialization steps at @xmath45 and end at the same final temperature @xmath46 . in all cases ,",
    "the total simulation time was @xmath47 ( 600000 timesteps of @xmath42 ) .",
    "data were collected at the beginning of the simulation and every @xmath48 thereafter .",
    "seven different annealing strategies have been employed , which are also depicted in fig .",

    "2 .   after the same initialization period as in @xmath56 , the system is rapidly cooled ( @xmath57 every @xmath58 steps ) down to @xmath59 at which the system remains for @xmath60 steps .",
    "this process ( rapid cooling by @xmath61 in @xmath48 , followed @xmath62 at constant temperature ) is repeated until @xmath63 is reached ; afterwards rapid cooling is continued down to @xmath46 .",

    ", the temperature is rapidly ( @xmath65 in @xmath66 ) raised to @xmath59 and lowered again down to @xmath64 .",
    "this heating - cooling cycle is repeated in total eight times ; afterwards the system is further cooled down ( @xmath57 in @xmath66 ) to @xmath46 .",
    "4 .   after an initialization period of @xmath67 steps ( @xmath68 ) , the system is rapidly ( @xmath57 in @xmath66 ) cooled down to @xmath69 , heated to @xmath70 , cooled to @xmath71 , heated to @xmath72 , cooled to @xmath73 and so on , until , after heating from @xmath74 to @xmath75 the system is cooled down to @xmath46 .",

    "in this article we focus on two characteristic quantities : the distribution of coordination numbers and types of polygons present in the system .",
    "the coordination number @xmath84 ( number of direct neighbors ) is characteristic for the phase of carbon .",
    "a gas of carbon atoms has @xmath85 , for carbon dimers one has @xmath86 .",
    "carbon chains and isolated rings have @xmath87 . for the @xmath3-hybridized carbon atoms in graphite , graphene , nanotubes and fullerenes",
    "one has @xmath88 , while diamond structures are characterized by @xmath89 .",
    "the bond length of @xmath3-hybridized carbon in graphite layers is @xmath90 , for @xmath91-hybridized atoms in diamond one has @xmath92 .",
    "the carbon - carbon bond lengths in @xmath16 are @xmath93 for adjacent hexagons and @xmath94 in pentagons .",
    "similar values one has to expect in other fullerenes or nanotubes . therefore setting up",
    "a threshold of @xmath95 for the carbon - carbon bond seems to be a reasonable choice . in our simulations",
    ", bonds are attached to all pairs of atoms that have a distance smaller than the threshold @xmath96 .",
    "while other values for this threshold have some influence on the results , this effect is small within reasonable limits .",
    "we will use a normalized coordination number count @xmath97 where @xmath98 is the number of atoms with coordination number @xmath84 and @xmath99 is the total number of atoms .      also the number of polygons present in the system is characteristic .",
    "fullerenes are mostly composed of hexagons and several pentagons , whereas pure carbon nanotubes as well as graphite and carbon fibers are made from hexagons only .",
    "heptagons may break the convexity of fullerene structures , they repeatedly appear as defects during cooling processes .",
    "simulations will be characterized by the normalized number of polygons @xmath100 the polygon type can be pentagons ( @xmath101 ) , hexagons ( @xmath102 ) , or heptagons ( @xmath103 ) .",
    "the number of polygons is normalized to the graphene limit of hexagons , which is @xmath104 if there are @xmath99 atoms .    in order to determine the number polygons of length @xmath105",
    ", we use a ring number algorithm which is built on a tree - search as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : treesearch ] .",
    "the idea is as follows . for each atom",
    "the algorithm checks whether it is part of a ring of length @xmath105 ( @xmath106 ) .",
    "the algorithm is repeated for the various values of @xmath105 and for all atoms .",
    "starting from the initial atom , the list of nearest neighbor ( n.n . )",
    "atoms is determined .",
    "list contains those atoms which are not further away from the reference atom than the threshold for the bond length .    in turn , for each atom in the n.n .",
    "list the corresponding n.n .",
    "list is generated .",
    "the procedure is repeated @xmath105 times .",
    "the resulting structure can be regarded as a graph with atoms as nodes and bonds as edges .",
    "so , roughly speaking , for each particle all possible paths of length @xmath105 starting from the selected atom and leading in each step to one of the nearest neighbors of the current atom , are determined . from all these paths , those for which starting and end point coincide ( closed paths ) are selected .",
    "next we eliminating those structures , in which bonds are repeatedly traversed ( as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : falsepolygons]a and [ fig : falsepolygons]b ) .",
    "when all particles have been checked , the resulting number of detected closed paths of length @xmath105 equals @xmath107 times the number of polygons in the system , since each atom of a polygon is used as initial atom and for each atom there are two possible paths , one clockwise , the other one counter - clockwise .",
    "the goal of this paper is to reveal the details of the polygon formation in order to develop an improved annealing strategy . to this end ,",
    "md simulations for the different annealing strategies presented above are performed and analyzed . in all simulations ,",
    "the total number of atoms , initial and final temperatures , as well as the total number of md steps is the same .    in figs .",
    "[ klfig : results]a and  [ klfig : results]b the final results are summarized in form of the normalized coordination number count and the normalized number of polygons for the various annealing strategies",
    ". an interesting observation of fig .",
    "[ klfig : results]b is the fact that the ratio of the number of hexagons to pentagons and heptagons is almost the same in all cases . an exception is strategy @xmath108 , in which the polygon yield is negligibly small in any case .    a comparison of fig .",
    "[ klfig : results]a and  [ klfig : results]b reveals that the polygon yield is roughly proportional to the number of atoms with coordination number 3 .",
    "this implies that polygons are not formed as isolated rings , but rather immediately as locally connected planar structures .",
    "the ranking of the annealing strategies in view of the polygon yield is @xmath108 , @xmath109 , @xmath110 , @xmath111 , @xmath112 , @xmath83 , @xmath113 .",
    "the most ineffective strategy of all is clearly @xmath108 with almost no polygons , but long chains instead .     for @xmath114",
    "after annealing runs @xmath109 to @xmath83 ; ( b ) number of polygons ( pentagons p , hexagons h , heptagons 7 ) , normalized to the graphene limit , for annealing runs @xmath109 to @xmath83,width=321 ]    the expression @xmath115 could be expected to characterize the number of fullerenes present in a system , provided all carbon atoms are precisely bounded to three other atoms .    in our simulations , however , we find the number of heptagons to be typically larger than the number of pentagons . at second",
    "thought , this should not really be surprising since in the `` chain phase '' the formation of longer rings is more likely than the formation of shorter ones",
    ". it shows , however , that we are still quite far from a system which only contains fullerenes .    : ( a ) temperature progression ; ( b ) normalized coordination number count ; ( c ) normalized number of polygons.,width=321 ]    : ( a ) temperature progression ; ( b ) normalized coordination number count , ( c ) normalized number of polygons.,width=321 ]    : ( a ) temperature progression ; ( b ) normalized coordination number count , ( c ) normalized number of polygons.,width=321 ]    according to fig .",
    "[ klfig : results ] the strategy @xmath108 has a very poor polygon yield , while the opposite is true for the best strategy @xmath113 , although the two annealing strategies look fairly similar .",
    "the only but crucial difference is that in the first case the heating - cooling cycles operate between 3000  k and 6000  k , while in second case the temperatures are 2000  k and 5000  k. there are two effects which are expected to be responsible for that :    * in the temperature range of @xmath116 lies the crossover temperature @xmath117 , at which the number of atoms with coordination number 3 start to dominate over those with coordination number 2 . in this range",
    "the formation of graphite- or fullerene - like structures seems to be most efficient .",
    "* at the same time the heating - cooling cycles of @xmath113 do not exceed ( contrary to the @xmath108 ) the onset temperature @xmath118 of polygon formation . as we see in fig .",
    "[ klfig : resultst6 ] , the system reacts almost instantaneously on temperature changes , therefore , heating above @xmath118 would break up the elementary building blocks of the polygons .",
    "[ klfig : resultst2 ] contains the the detailed time evolution of the normalized coordination count and the normalized number of polygons during the anealing process for strategy @xmath110 , in which a stepwise cooling is performed with five intermediate temperatures , such that the system is almost in thermodynamic equilibration at the intermediate temperatures .",
    "based on the results in fig  [ klfig : resultst2]a we define regions in which atoms of a specific coordination number dominate .",
    "we conclude that atoms with coordination number 2 dominate already at @xmath119  k down to @xmath120  k. from @xmath120  k down to a crossover temperature @xmath121  k , atoms with coordination number 2 predominate , while below @xmath117 atoms of coordinations number 3 are in the majority . in the observed temperature range",
    ", we found almost no atoms with coordination number 4 , the prerequisite for the diamond structure .",
    "the onset of polygon formation , according to fig  [ klfig : resultst2]b , takes place at about @xmath122  ps , while the formation of atoms with coordination number 3 is roughly at @xmath123  ps .",
    "the polygon formation happens right after the cooling from @xmath120  k to @xmath124  k , while the formation of atoms with coordination number 3 takes place later at the same temperature .",
    "hence , the polygons are formed first as ringlike structures before they combine locally to form planar structures .",
    "interestingly , the opposite is the case if the system is cooled more rapidly without reaching thermodynamic equilibrium , as is observed in fig .",
    "[ klfig : resultst5 ] .",
    "the onset of polygon formation in fig  [ klfig : resultst5 ] is at a significant lower temperature than in fig .",
    "[ klfig : resultst2 ] , due to the inertia of the system .",
    "interestingly , the simulation time before polygon formation sets in is the same in both cases .",
    "the comparison of coordination number count in both strategies reveals that the system passes through comparable phases , i.e. the depletion of isolated atom , the formation of dimers , the increasing and decreasing number of atoms in chains , followed by the gradual formation of atoms with coordination number 3 .",

    "the number of atoms with coordination number 2 is reduced by the same amount .",

    "only marginally changes the results , so for this particular strategy we seem to have reached a plateau .",
    "we have simulated the structures resulting from annealing a hot carbon gas with different strategies , i.e. different forms of temperature evolution .",
    "the structures have been analyzed with respect to the coordination number count and the number of pentagons , hexagons and heptagons .",
    "we have found the yield of fullerene - like structures to be quite sensitive to the strategy employed . thus the fullerene yield can either be significantly enhanced or almost reduced to zero by appropriate annealing strategies .",
    "the best strategy included several heating - cooling cycles , operating below the fullerene disintegration temperature ( corresponding to the onset temperature of polygon formation ) , but encompassing the crossover temperature between double- and triple - bonded atoms    since timescales in md simulations are short compared to those of most physical processes , an optimized annealing strategy can be an important means to obtain more realistic results for md simulations of fullerene formation .",
    "alternatively , repeated heating - cooling cycles which , performed in the optimal temperature window , gave the best fullerene yield , might also occur ( on larger timescales ) in nature and enhance the fullerene yield e.g. in soot .    while some scrutinized strategies were obviously superior to uniform annealing",
