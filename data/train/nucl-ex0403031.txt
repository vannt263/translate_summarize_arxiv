    "jet studies are of great importance for understanding au+au collisions at rhic and the properties of the high density matter which result from them .",
    "it is essential to understand how the medium does or does not modify jet yields and jet shapes @xcite .",
    "the results from d+au and p+p collisions provide the baseline for medium modification studies in au+au collisions . for these simpler systems",
    ", jets can be examined in great detail via full jet reconstruction .",
    "in contrast , full jet reconstruction is not practical in au+au collisions , so the comparisons with au+au must be done using inclusive particle yields and di - hadron and n - hadron correlations .",
    "this study presents the first full jet reconstruction at rhic and reports @xmath0 distributions from p+p collisions and @xmath2 measurements in p+p and d+au collisions .",
    "@xmath0 characterizes the transverse shape of a jet .",
    "@xmath2 measures the transverse momentum of a parton within a nucleon or nucleus , and its growth from p+p to nuclear collisions is believed to contribute to the cronin effect @xcite .",
    "comparisons are also made to @xmath0 and @xmath2 results inferred from di - hadron correlations .",
    "the star detector is well suited for investigating jet production at rhic , due to the complete @xmath3 coverage and large @xmath4 coverage of the tpc and emc .",
    "the star barrel emc data used in this study provide neutral energy including @xmath5 decay photons .",
    "the barrel emc during the 2003 rhic run measured neutral energy in the range @xmath6 .",
    "the 2400 towers each covered an angular area of @xmath7 .",
    "the barrel emc was read out in minimum bias events .",
    "it was also used to trigger on `` high tower '' events , where one of the towers was above a certain energy threshold , e.g. @xmath8 gev .",
    "this `` high tower '' triggered event sample contains a much larger fraction of jets than the minimum bias event sample .",
    "this analysis uses two different algorithms that reconstruct a jet by capturing the spray of fragmenting particles in a geometric cone .",
    "one centers the cone on the most energetic hadrons in the event , while the other optimizes the cone direction to maximize the included energy .",
    "care must be taken when reconstructing jets in d+au collisions , to ensure that an algorithm is robust at high multiplicity .",
    "measurement of jet energy requires corrections for charged particle energy deposition in the emc , for the finite efficiencies of the tpc and emc , and for the unmeasured energy carried by long - lived neutral particles ( @xmath9 , @xmath10 , ... ) .",
    "it is also possible for the jet reconstruction algorithm to miss soft particles .",
    "the total energy scale correction applied is about @xmath11 for minimum bias events , and @xmath12 for `` high tower '' events , and is derived from pythia monte carlo simulations .",
    "a sample of pythia events processed by the star detector simulator was analyzed in the same fashion as the data . for jets with measured @xmath13 gev ,",
    "the pythia simulations compare well with the data .",
    "understanding the higher @xmath14 jet distributions is still in progress , though low to moderate @xmath15 jets dominate average quantities such as @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "0.50    0.8    jet @xmath0 distributions for two hadron @xmath18 thresholds .",
    "histograms are pythia monte carlo events processed by the star detector simulator . the pythia curve for hadron @xmath19",
    "gev / c has been arbitrarily normalized for comparison purposes .",
    "the component of the hadron momentum perpendicular to the jet thrust axis is given by :    @xmath20    where @xmath21 and @xmath22 represent the momentum of the hadron and jet , respectively .",
    "the formula shows that while @xmath23 is related to the fragmentation of the jet and dependent on the jet thrust axis , it is not dependent on the jet energy scale .",
    "figure 1 shows the @xmath23 distributions from jets in p+p collisions with observed @xmath24 gev , for both the monte carlo and the min bias data . for hadron @xmath19 gev / c , the data and the monte carlo",
    "agree within 4% .",
    "for charged hadrons with @xmath19 gev / c , @xmath25 mev / c .",
    "0.8    the di - jet opening angle is one of the basic observables obtained from di - jet events . for di - jets , @xmath26 in leading order qcd .",
    "gluon radiation broadens @xmath27 , which is measured by the per - parton root mean square @xmath28 . when reconstructing di - jets , one `` trigger '' jet with observed @xmath29 gev is reconstructed from both neutral and charged hadrons using the high tower which triggered the event .",
    "this establishes the di - jet energy scale , but also restricts the jet to positive @xmath4 , due to the barrel emc acceptance .",
    "the other `` away '' jet is reconstructed using charged particles only , allowing the `` away '' jet to range @xmath30 .",
    "this mixes both symmetric and asymmetric partonic collisions into the sample , just as in high-@xmath18 inclusive yields .",
    "the left panel of figure 2 shows the di - jet @xmath27 distribution for p+p collisions . for these reconstructed p+p di - jets ,",
    "the corrected jet energy scale is @xmath31 gev . using the jet energy scale and the overall detector resolution obtained from pythia simulations , the intrinsic @xmath32 gev / c .",
    "the right panel of figure 2 shows the star p+p di - jet @xmath33 compared with world data @xcite .",
    "the left panel of figure 3 shows the di - jet @xmath27 distribution for d+au collisions .",
    "taking @xmath34 , we find the @xmath35 gev / c in d+au collisions .",
    "the major systematic uncertainties are the jet energy scale in p+p and d+au , the detector resolution , and treatment of the background in the di - jet @xmath27 distributions .",
    "the present uncertainties are conservative estimates , and the capability exists at star for future improvement of all the @xmath1 measurements .",
    "a complementary di - hadron analysis at star correlates high @xmath15 photons measured with the emc and charged particles found in the tpc .",
    "photons provide significant advantages since the high tower trigger selects the events of interest .",
    "the right panel of figure 3 shows the results for d+au collisions with two different thresholds for the trigger photon @xmath15 .",
    "the di - hadron correlation strength increases and the width narrows as the trigger photon @xmath15 is increased .",
    "the increased @xmath14 also permits higher associated particle thresholds , which reduces the background . when applied to au+au collisions",
    ", this technique will provide much cleaner separation of jet - like correlations from anisotropic flow ( @xmath36 ) compared to previous studies with charged trigger particles @xcite .",
    "the di - hadron analysis finds that preliminary values for @xmath37 mev / c and @xmath38 gev / c , where @xmath39 , the average fragmentation fraction of the trigger photon , is estimated to be the range @xmath40 . within present systematic uncertainties ,",
    "the jet analysis results and the di - hadron results agree . for additional details ,",
    "see @xcite .    0.8",
    "jets have been reconstructed in both p+p and d+au collisions .",
    "the p+p jets have been used to measure both @xmath23 and @xmath1 .",
    "the @xmath23 results agree with the monte carlo simulation studies .",
    "the d+au @xmath41 value , though having large uncertainty , is in line with the expectation from previous experiments @xcite indicating that @xmath41 is substantial compared with @xmath42 .",
    "the @xmath43 and @xmath44 results from full jet reconstruction agree well with similar measurements using di - hadron correlations .",
    "in addition to reducing uncertainties , future analysis will focus on jet and di - jet cross sections in p+p and d+au collisions , as well as @xmath45 for jets ( partons ) .",
