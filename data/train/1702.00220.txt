    "a polycrystalline sample of the non - magnetic lapd@xmath0ge@xmath0 was also prepared in a home built mono arc furnace .    to confirm the phase purity of grown crystal ,",

    "but , for @xmath20  [ 001 ] , @xmath21 shows an upturn at @xmath13 .",
    "such a feature observed in some antiferromagnets is generally attributed to a reduction in electron density caused by the opening of a gap ( superzone gap ) in the fermi surface at @xmath13 when the magnetic periodicity is incongruent with the periodicity of the chemical unit cell .",
