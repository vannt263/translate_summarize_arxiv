    "the magnetic phase is also suppressed by @xmath0 in the @xmath8-fvh model . in addition , the phase boundaries converge to the same values when temperature decreases .",
    "the present work has studied the fermionic version of the classical van hemmen model @xcite for sg in the presence of a transverse magnetic field @xmath0 .",
    "the goal is to verify how the interplay between charge and spin fluctuations can affect the magnetic ordering in this particular model .",
    "it should be mentioned that the knowledge of such interplay can also be quite useful in further applications for studying the disordered magnetism when other physical processes are present ( see , for instance , ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "the mentioned fermionic version has been formulated in two versions . in the first one , the so called @xmath8-fvh , the two nonmagnetic eigenstates of the operator @xmath90 ( defined in eq .",
    "( [ eqs ] ) have been eliminated .",
    "therefore , the corresponding thermodynamics obtained is exactly the same one obtained by a previous quantum formulation of the van hemmen model given in ref .",
    "@xcite . on the contrary , when the four original eigenstates are preserved ,",
    "the solution for both saddle point order parameters , the sg ( @xmath64 ) and the magnetization ( @xmath65 ) one , indicates that not only the phase diagram but also the nature of the phase transitions are deeply affected when the chemical potential @xmath1 and/or @xmath0 are varied .",
    "for instance , the mixed phase fm+sg can be suppressed as well as there is onset of tricritical and triple points by increasing @xmath1 and/or @xmath0 .",
    "in fact , the role of @xmath0 as responsible for the suppression of the fm+sg phase has already been found in ref .",
    "remarkably , in the present problem , the same result can be obtained by varying only @xmath1 , or in other words , only by changing the average occupation of sites @xmath75 .",
    "therefore , one can say that the thermodynamics derived from van hemmen model is either sensitive to a spin flipping mechanism provided by @xmath0 as well a dilution one provided by @xmath1 .",
    "surely , when both mechanisms are combined , the complexity of the phase diagram is even more intense as can be illustrated by a first order phase transition between the pm and sg ( or fe ) phases with the presence of tricritical and triple points .    to conclude ,",
    "we have shown in this work that mechanisms such as dilution and quantum spin flipping given by @xmath1 and @xmath0 , respectively , are sources of quite non - trivial effects in the fermionic van hemmen model .",
    "more precisely , those effects indicate that the existence of magnetic phases and the nature of its boundaries in that model are extremely sensitive to the redistribution of charge provided by @xmath1 and @xmath0 .",
    "it should be emphasized that thermodynamics in the present work could be derived without the use of sophisticated mathematical techniques such as the replica method .",
    "it is well known that in the case of sg first order phase transitions , the use of this method implies in considerable difficulties as , for example , location of first order phases boundary @xcite .",
    "this work was partially supported by the brazilian agencies cnpq and capes .",
    "the landau expansion of the grand canonical potential ( eq .",
    "( [ potential ] ) ) in powers of @xmath65 and @xmath64 is given by @xmath91 where @xmath92 @xmath93 and @xmath94 the second order phase transition from the paramagnetic phase to the sg one ( to the fe phase ) occurs when @xmath95 ( @xmath96 ) and @xmath97 .",

    "<S> @xmath2 @xcite and @xmath3 @xcite are physical systems in which disorder combined with rkky and kondo interaction is responsible by the onset of a complex scenario . </S>",
    "<S> their phase diagrams display a glassy state , ferromagnetism and a region dominated by the kondo effect . </S>",

    "<S> the ising part of the model represents an intersite interaction between localized f - spin operators . </S>",
    "<S> it is precisely in the spin - spin ising coupling @xmath4 that various types of randomness have been tested trying to represent the effects of the disorder in the @xmath5 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , the random coupling @xmath4 has been chosen as the sherrington - kirkpatrick ( sk ) model @xcite or as the hopfield model @xcite . however , </S>",
    "<S> none of the choices previously mentioned were entirely satisfactory to describe how the glassy state in the @xmath5 is replaced by an inhomogeneous ferromagnetism when the temperature is decreased @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> very recently , a new approach has been proposed for the problem discussed above , this approach uses the random coupling @xmath4 as that one introduced in the van hemmen ( vh ) model @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this model was originally conceived to study the spin glass ( sg ) problem with classical ising spin variables . </S>",
    "<S> the results indicated that the vh type of randomness in the kil model is more adequate than those ones used in sk or hopfield models to reproduce some aspects of the experimental phase diagram of the @xmath5 @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> the improvement obtained using the coupling @xmath4 given as the vh model to study the @xmath5 suggests the usefulness of this kind of randomness could be more general . </S>",
    "<S> in other words , it could also be used when it is present in other quantum process than the kondo effect . in this case , models with one type of fermions could be built by adding to the vh ising term , for instance , a hopping , a pairing coupling @xcite or a transverse magnetic field . </S>",

    "<S> the natural tool to obtain the thermodynamics is the functional integral formalism with grassmann fields . </S>",
    "<S> a peculiarity of this representation is that @xmath6 acts in a space with four eigenstates . among them , there are two which are nonmagnetic @xcite . therefore , we calculate the grand partition function for two situations . in the first one , here called @xmath7 fermionic van hemmen ( @xmath7-fvh ) model , the four states are preserved . </S>",
    "<S> for this particular model , the chemical potential @xmath1 appears as an important parameter in the problem . in the second one , the @xmath8 fermionic van hemmen ( @xmath8-fvh ) model , introduces a restriction , what allows considering only the two magnetic states @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> the presence of an additional transverse magnetic field @xmath0 in the fisg model also introduces important changes in the pm / sg phase boundary . </S>",
    "<S> the first order part of that phase boundary is diminished when @xmath0 increases @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the proper understanding of the vh model in a fermionic formulation can be important not only as a sg problem itself but also as something useful for applications as pointed out above and very recently discussed in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> it should also be mentioned that the vh model with an additional transverse magnetic field @xmath0 has already been studied . however , in a formulation where the classical ising spin variables were replaced by pauli matrices @xcite . in this formulation </S>",
    "<S> one can observe important consequences for the phase diagram produced by the presence of @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> the obtained phase diagram shows that the increase of @xmath0 destroys the sg , the ferromagnetic ( fm ) and the mixed ( fm+sg ) phases found in the classical phase diagram . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , this kind of formulation is not able to capture the consequences for the phase diagram when both charge and spin fluctuations are affected by @xmath0 .    </S>",
    "<S> this paper has the following structure . in the second section , </S>",
    "<S> the model is introduced and the grand canonical potential is derived . in the third section , </S>",
    "<S> several phase diagrams are constructed with particular attention for the effects of @xmath0 and @xmath1 by solving the equations for the order parameters . </S>",
    "<S> the last section is dedicated to the conclusions . </S>"
