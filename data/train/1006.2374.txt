    "* sle and its conformal markov property . * oded schramm s sle processes introduced in @xcite have deeply changed the way mathematicians and physicists understand critical phenomena in two dimensions .",
    "recall that a chordal sle is a random non - self - traversing curve in a simply connected domain , joining two prescribed boundary points of the domain .",
    "modulo conformal invariance hypotheses that have been proved to hold in several cases , the scaling limit of an interface that appears in various two - dimensional models from statistical physics , when boundary conditions are chosen in a particular way , is one of these sle curves .",
    "for instance , in the ising model on a triangular lattice , if one connected arc @xmath9 of the boundary of a simply connected region @xmath10 is forced to contain only @xmath11 spins whereas the complementary arc @xmath12 contains only @xmath13 spins , then there is a random interface that separates the cluster of @xmath11 spins attached to @xmath9 from the cluster of @xmath13 spins attached to @xmath12 ; this random curve has recently been proved by chelkak and smirnov to converge in distribution to an sle curve ( sle@xmath14 ) when one lets the mesh of the lattice go to zero ( and chooses the critical temperature of the ising model ) @xcite .",
    "note that sle describes the law of one particular interface , not the joint law of all interfaces ( we will come back to this issue later ) . on the other hand , for a given model",
    ", one expects all macroscopic interfaces to have similar geometric properties , i.e. , to locally look like an sle .",
    "the construction of sle curves can be summarized as follows : the first observation , contained in schramm s original paper @xcite , is the `` analysis '' of the problem : assuming that the two - dimensional models of statistical physics have a conformally invariant scaling limit , what can be said about the scaling limit of the interfaces ?",
    "if one chooses the boundary conditions in a suitable way , one can identify a special interface that joins two boundary points ( as in the ising model mentioned above ) .",
    "schramm argues that if this curve has a scaling limit , and if its law is conformally invariant , then it should satisfy an `` exploration '' property in the scaling limit .",
    "this property , combined with conformal invariance , implies that it can be defined via iterations of independent random conformal maps . with the help of loewner s theory for slit mappings ,",
    "this leads naturally to the definition of the ( one parameter ) family of sle processes , which are random increasing families of compact sets ( called loewner chains ) , see @xcite for more details .",
    "recall that loewner chains are constructed via continuous iterations of infinitesimal conformal perturbations of the identity , and they do not a priori necessarily correspond to actual planar curves .",
    "a second step , essentially completed in @xcite , is to start from the definition of these sle processes as random loewner chains , and to prove that they indeed correspond to random two - dimensional curves .",
    "this constructs a one - parameter family of sle random curves joining two boundary points of a domain , and the previous steps shows that if a random curve is conformally invariant ( in distribution ) and satisfies the exploration property , then it is necessarily one of these sle curves .",
    "one can study various properties of these random loewner chains .",
    "for instance , one can compute critical exponents such as in @xcite , determine their fractal dimension as in @xcite , derive special properties of certain sle s  locality , restriction  as in @xcite , relate them to discrete lattice models such as uniform spanning trees , percolation , the discrete gaussian free field or the ising model as in @xcite , or to the gaussian free field and its variants as in @xcite etc .",
    "indeed , at this point the literature is far too large for us to properly survey here . for conditions that ensure that discrete interfaces converge to sle paths ,",
    "see the recent contributions @xcite .",
    "* conformal markov property for collections of loops . * a natural question is how to describe the `` entire '' scaling limit of the lattice - based model , and not only that of one particular interface . in the present paper , we will answer the following question : supposing that a discrete random system gives rise in its scaling limit to a conformally invariant collection of loops ( i.e. , interfaces ) that remain disjoint ( note that this is not always the case ; we will comment on this later ) , what can these random conformally invariant collections of loops be ?",
    "more precisely , we will define and study random collections of loops that combine conformal invariance and a natural restriction property ( motivated by the fact that the discrete analog of this property trivially holds for the discrete models we have in mind ) .",
    "we call such collections of loops conformal loop ensembles ( cle )",
    ". the two main results of the present paper can be summarized as follows :    [ mainresults ]    * for each cle , there exists a value @xmath15 $ ] such that with probability one , all loops of the cle are sle@xmath1-type loops .",
    "* conversely , for each @xmath15 $ ] , there exists exactly one cle with sle@xmath1 type loops .",
    "in fact , these statements will be derived via two almost independent steps , that involve different techniques :    1 .",
    "we first derive the first of these two statements together with the uniqueness part of the second one .",
    "this will involve a detailed analysis of the cle property , and consequences about possible ways to `` explore '' a cle . here",
    ", sle techniques will be important .",
    "we derive the existence part of the second statement using clusters of poisson point processes of brownian loops ( the brownian loop - soups ) .    in the end",
    ", we will have two remarkably different explicit constructions of these conformal loop ensembles cle@xmath1 for each @xmath6 in @xmath16 $ ] ( one based on sle , one based on loop - soups ) .",
    "this is useful , since many properties that seem very mysterious from one perspective are easy from the other .",
    "for example , the ( expectation ) fractal dimensions of the individual loops and of the set of points not surrounded by any loop can be explicitly computed with sle tools @xcite , while many monotonicity results and fkg - type correlation inequalities are immediate from the loop - soup construction @xcite .",
    "one illustration of the interplay between these two approaches is already present in this paper : one can use sle tools to determine exactly the value of the critical intensity that separates the two percolative phases of the brownian loop - soup ( and to our knowledge , this is the only self - similar percolation model where this critical value has been determined ) .    in order to try to explain the logical construction of the proof ,",
    "let us outline these two parts separately in the following two subsections .",
    "let us now describe in more detail the results of the first part of the paper , corresponding to sections [ s.2 ] through [ s.8bis ] .",
    "we are going to study random families @xmath17 of non - nested simple disjoint loops in simply connected domains .",
    "for each simply connected @xmath10 , we let @xmath18 denote the law of this loop - ensemble in @xmath10 .",
    "we say that this family is * conformally invariant * if for any two simply connected domains @xmath10 and @xmath19 ( that are not equal to the entire plane ) and conformal transformation @xmath20 , the image of @xmath18 under @xmath21 is @xmath22 .",
    "we also make the following `` local finiteness '' assumption : if @xmath10 is equal to the unit disc @xmath23 , then for any @xmath24 , there are @xmath25 almost surely only finitely many loops of radius larger than @xmath26 in @xmath27 .",
    "consider two simply connected domains @xmath28 , and sample a family @xmath29 according to the law @xmath30 in the larger domain @xmath31 .",
    "then , we can subdivide the family @xmath32 into two parts : those that do not stay in @xmath33 , and those that stay in @xmath33 ( we call the latter @xmath34 ) .",
    "let us now define @xmath35 to be the random set obtained when removing from the set @xmath33 all the loops of @xmath27 that do not fully stay in @xmath33 , together with their interiors .",
    "we say that the family @xmath18 * satisfies restriction * if , for any such @xmath33 and @xmath31 , the conditional law of @xmath34 given @xmath35 is @xmath36 ( or more precisely , it is the product of @xmath18 for each connected component @xmath10 of @xmath35 ) .",
    "when a family is conformally invariant and satisfies restriction , we say that it is a conformal loop ensemble ( cle ) .",
    "the goal of the paper is to characterize and construct all possible cles .",

    "let us for instance consider @xmath10 to be the upper half - plane @xmath37 .",
    "a first step in our analysis will be to prove that for all @xmath38 , if @xmath27 is a cle , then the conditional law of the unique loop @xmath39 that surrounds @xmath40 , conditionally on the fact that @xmath41 intersects the @xmath42-neighborhood of the origin , converges as @xmath43 to a probability measure @xmath44 on `` pinned loops '' , i.e. , loops in @xmath37 that touch the real line only at the origin .",
    "we will derive various properties of @xmath44 , which will eventually enable us to relate it to sle .",
    "one simple way to describe this relation is as follows :    [ t1 ] if @xmath27 is a cle , then the measure @xmath44 exists for all @xmath38 , and it is equal to the limit when @xmath43 of the law of an sle@xmath1 from @xmath42 to @xmath45 in @xmath37 conditioned to disconnect @xmath40 from infinity in @xmath37 , for some @xmath15 $ ] ( we call this limit the sle@xmath1 * bubble measure * ) .",
    "this shows that all the loops of a cle are indeed in some sense `` sle@xmath1 loops '' for some @xmath6 .",
    "in fact , the way in which @xmath44 will be described ( and in which this theorem will actually be proved ) can be understood as follows ( this will be the content of proposition [ p44 ] ) in the case where @xmath46 : consider @xmath47 the lowest point on @xmath48 \\cap \\gamma ( i)$ ] , and @xmath49 the unbounded connected component of the domain obtained by removing from @xmath50 $ ] all the loops of the cle that intersect @xmath51 . consider the conformal map @xmath52 from @xmath49 onto @xmath37 with @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "then , the law of @xmath55 is exactly @xmath56 .",
    "( sketch).,width=480 ]    theorem [ t1 ] raises the question of whether two different cle distributions can correspond to the same measure @xmath44 .",
    "we will prove that it is not possible , i.e. , we will describe a way to reconstruct the law of the cle out of the knowledge of @xmath44 only , using a construction based on a poisson point process of pinned loops :    [ t2 ] for each @xmath15 $ ] , there exists at most one cle such that @xmath44 is the sle@xmath1 bubble measure .    in a way",
    ", this reconstruction procedure can be interpreted as an `` excursion theory '' for cles .",
    "it will be very closely related to the decomposition of a bessel process via its poisson point process of excursions .",
    "in fact , this will enable us to relate our cles to the random loop ensembles defined in @xcite using branching sle processes , which we now briefly describe . recall that when @xmath57 , @xmath58 is a random simple curve from one marked boundary point @xmath59 of a simply connected domain @xmath10 to another boundary point @xmath60 . if we now compare the law of an sle from @xmath59 to @xmath60 in @xmath10 with that of an sle from @xmath59 to @xmath61 in @xmath10 when @xmath62 , then they clearly differ , and it is also immediate to check that the laws of their initial parts ( i.e. , the laws of the paths up to the first time they exit some fixed small neighborhood of @xmath59 ) are also not identical .",
    "we say that sle@xmath1 is not target - independent .",
    "however , a variant of sle(@xmath6 ) called sle(@xmath6 , @xmath63 ) has been shown by schramm and wilson @xcite ( see also @xcite ) to be target - independent .",
    "this makes it possible to couple such processes starting at @xmath59 and aiming at two different points @xmath60 and @xmath61 in such a way that they coincide until the first disconnection point .",
    "this in turn makes it possible to canonically define a conformally invariant `` exploration tree '' of sle ( @xmath6 , @xmath64 ) processes rooted at @xmath59 , and a collection of loops called conformal loop ensembles in @xcite .",
    "it is conjectured in @xcite that this one - parameter collection of loops indeed corresponds to the scaling limit of a wide class of discrete lattice - based models , and that for each @xmath6 , the law of the constructed family of loops is independent of the starting point @xmath59 .",
    "the branching sle ( @xmath65 ) procedure works for any @xmath66 $ ] , but the obtained loops are simple and disjoint loops only when @xmath57 . in this paper , we use the term cle to refer to any collection of loops satisfying conformal invariance and restriction , while using the term cle@xmath1 to refer to the random collections of loops constructed in @xcite .",
    "we shall prove the following :    [ t3 ] every cle is in fact a cle@xmath1 for some @xmath0 $ ] .",
    "let us stress that we have not yet proved at this point that the cle@xmath1 are themselves cles ( and this was also not established in @xcite )  nor that the law of cle@xmath1 is root - independent .",
    "in fact , it is not proved at this point that cles exist at all .",
    "all of this will follow from the second part .",
    "we now describe the content of sections [ s.2bis ] to [ s.4 ] .",
    "the brownian loop - soup , as defined in @xcite , is a poissonian random countable collection of brownian loops contained within a fixed simply - connected domain @xmath10 .",
    "we will actually only need to consider the outer boundaries of the brownian loops , so we will take the perspective that a loop - soup is a random countable collection of simple loops ( outer boudaries of brownian loops can be defined as sle@xmath67 loops , see @xcite ) .",
    "let us stress that our conformal loop ensembles are also random collections of simple loops , but that , unlike the loops of the brownian loop - soup , the loops in a cle are almost surely all disjoint from one another .",

    "conformal invariance : the measure @xmath75 is invariant under any moebius transformation of the unit disc onto itself .",

    "we will work with the usual definition ( i.e. , the usual normalization ) of the measure @xmath70 ( as in @xcite  note that there can be some confusion about a factor @xmath80 in the definition , related to whether one keeps track of the orientation of the brownian loops or not ) . since we will be talking about some explicit values of @xmath2 later",
    ", it is important to specify this normalization . for a direct definition of the measure @xmath70 in terms of brownian loops , see @xcite .        as mentioned above , @xcite pointed out a way to relate brownian loop - soups clusters to sle - type loops : two loops in @xmath72 are said to be adjacent if they intersect .",

    ".    it therefore follows from our markovian characterization that @xmath27 is a cle@xmath1 ( according to the branching sle(@xmath91 ) based definition in @xcite ) for _ some _ @xmath0 $ ] .",
    "we will in fact also derive the following correspondence :    [ kappacorrespondence ] fix @xmath90 $ ] and let @xmath72 be a brownian loop - soup of intensity @xmath2 on @xmath23 .",

    "is obtained for exactly one value of @xmath90 $ ] in theorem [ kappacorrespondence ] , we immediately get thanks to theorem [ t3 ] that the random simple loop configurations satisfying the conformal restriction axioms are precisely the cle@xmath1 where @xmath0 $ ] , which completes the proof of theorem [ mainresults ] and of the fact that the following three descriptions of simple loop ensembles are equivalent :    1 .",
    "the random loop ensembles traced by branching schramm - loewner evolution ( sle@xmath1 ) curves for @xmath6 in @xmath7 $ ] .",
    "2 .   the outer - cluster - boundary ensembles of brownian loop - soups for @xmath93 .",
    "3 .   the ( only ) random loop ensembles satisfying the cle axioms .    let us now list some further consequences of these results .",
    "recall from @xcite that the hausdorff dimension of an sle@xmath1 curve is almost surely @xmath94 .",
    "our results therefore imply that the boundary of a loop - soup cluster of intensity @xmath95 has dimension @xmath96 note that just as for mandelbrot s conjecture for the dimension of brownian boundaries @xcite , this statement does not involve sle , but its proof does .",
    "in fact the result about the dimension of brownian boundaries can be viewed as the limit when @xmath97 of this one .",
    "furthermore we may define the _ carpet _ of the cle@xmath1 to be the random closed set obtained by removing from @xmath23 the interiors ( i.e. the bounded connected component of their complement ) of all the loops @xmath98 of @xmath27 , and recall that sle methods allowed @xcite to compute its `` expectation dimension '' in terms of @xmath6 .",
    "the present loop - soup construction of cle@xmath1 enables to prove ( see @xcite ) that this expectation dimension is indeed equal to its almost sure hausdorff dimension @xmath99 , and that in terms of @xmath2 , @xmath100 the critical loop - soup ( for @xmath5 ) corresponds therefore to a carpet of dimension @xmath101 .",
    "another direct consequence of the previous results is the `` additivity property '' of cle s : if one considers two independent cle s in the same simply connected domain @xmath10 with non - empty boundary , and looks at the union of these two , then either one can find a cluster whose boundary contains @xmath102 , or the outer boundaries of the obtained outermost clusters in this union form another cle .",
    "this is simply due to the fact that each of the cle s can be constructed via brownian loop soups ( of some intensities @xmath103 and @xmath104 ) so that the union corresponds to a brownian loop - soup of intensity @xmath105 .",
    "this gives for instance a clean direct geometric meaning to the general idea ( present on various occasions in the physics literature ) that relates in some way two independent copies of the ising model to the gaussian free field in their large scale limit : the outermost boundaries defined by the union of two independent cle@xmath14 s in a domain ( recall @xcite that cle@xmath14 is the scaling limit of the ising model loops , and note that it corresponds to @xmath106 ) form a cle@xmath107 ( which corresponds to `` outermost '' level lines of the gaussian free field , see @xcite and to @xmath108 ) .      in order to put our results in perspective",
    ", we briefly recall some closely related work on conformally invariant structures .    there exist several natural ways to construct conformally invariant structures in a domain @xmath10 .",
    "we have already mentioned the brownian loop - soup that will turn out be instrumental in the present paper when constructing explicitely cles .",
    "another natural conformally invariant structure that we have also just mentioned is the gaussian free field .",
    "this is a classical basic object in field theory .",
    "it has been shown ( see @xcite ) that it is very closely related to sle processes , and that one can detect all kinds of sles within the gaussian free field .",
    "in particular , this indicates that cles ( at least when @xmath109 ) can in fact also be defined and found as `` geometric '' lines in a gaussian free field .",
    "a number of discrete lattice - based models have been conjectured to give rise to conformally invariant structures in the fine - mesh limit .",
    "for some of these models , these structures can be described by random collections of loops .",
    "we have already mentioned that smirnov @xcite has proved this conjecture for some important models ( percolation , ising model  see also @xcite for some other cases ) . those models that will be directly relevant to the present paper ( i.e. , with disjoint simple loops ) include the ising model and the discrete gaussian free field level lines ( @xcite ) .",
    "the scaling limits of percolation and of the fk - model related to the ising model give rise to interfaces that are not disjoint .",
    "these are of course also very interesting objects ( see @xcite for the description of the percolation scaling limit ) , but they are not the subject of the present paper .",
    "conjecturally , each of the cles that we will be describing corresponds to the scaling limit of one of the so - called @xmath110 models , see e.g. @xcite , which are one simple way to define discrete random collections of non - overlapping loops .",
    "in fact , if one starts from a lattice - based model for which one controls the ( conformally invariant ) scaling limit of an observable ( loosely speaking , the scaling limit of the probability of some event ) , it seems possible ( see smirnov @xcite ) to use this to actually prove the convergence of the entire discrete `` branching '' exploration procedure to the corresponding branching sle(@xmath65 ) exploration tree .",
    "it is likely that it is not so much harder to derive the `` full '' scaling limit of all interfaces than to show the convergence of one particular interface to sle .",
    "another quite different family of discrete models that might ( more conjecturally ) be related to the cles that we are studying here , are the `` planar maps '' , where one chooses at random a planar graph , defined modulo homeomorphisms , and that are conjecturally closely related to the above ( for instance via their conjectured relation with the gaussian free field ) .",
    "it could well be that cles are rather directly related to random planar maps chosen in a way to contain `` large holes '' , such as the ones that are studied in @xcite .",
    "in fact , cles , planar maps and the gaussian free field should all be related to each other via liouville quantum gravity , as described in @xcite .",
    "note finally that conformal field theory , as developed in the theoretical physics community since the early eighties @xcite , is also a setup to describe the scaling limits of all correlation functions of these critical two - dimensional lattice models .",
    "this indicates that a description of the entire scaling limit of the lattice models in geometric sle - type terms could be useful in order to construct such fields .",
    "cle - based constructions of conformal field theoretical objects `` in the bulk '' can be found in benjamin doyon s papers @xcite .",
    "it may also be mentioned that aspects of the present paper ( infinite measures on `` pinned configurations '' ) can be interpreted naturally in terms of insertions of boundary operators .",

    "let us for instance consider the chordal exploration . because of @xmath70 s scaling property , the @xmath70-mass of the set of loops of half - plane capacity ( which scales like the square of the radius ) larger than @xmath178 should decay as @xmath521 . in particular , in the discrete exploration , the average number of exploration steps where one removes a set @xmath522 with half - plane capacity larger than @xmath118 is equal ( in the @xmath43 limit ) to @xmath523 times the average number of exploration steps where one removes a set with half - plane capacity larger than one .",
    "readers familiar with lvy processes will probably have recognized that in the @xmath43 limits , the capacity jumps of the chordal exploration process will be distributed like the jumps of a @xmath524-stable subordinator .",

    "in fact , the rest of this part of the paper ( until the constructive part using brownian loop - soups ) has two main goals : the first one is to show that the cle definition yields a description of the pinned measure @xmath70 in terms of sle@xmath1 for some @xmath15 $ ] . the second one is to prove that the pinned measure @xmath70 characterizes the law of the entire cle and also to make the connection with sle(@xmath145 ) .",

    "hence , putting our various equations together ( definitions of @xmath1168 , @xmath1191 , @xmath1190 , and the relation between @xmath6 and @xmath335 ) , we get that on the set of times where @xmath1192 , @xmath1193 this continuous driving function @xmath1194 defines a loewner chain , but it is not clear whether this chain is almost surely generated by a path . however , on those time - intervals where @xmath1195 , the law of @xmath1196 is ( locally ) absolutely continuous to that of a standard brownian motion , and the loewner chain is therefore tracing streches of simple paths during these intervals .",
    "in fact , each of these intervals correspond to a _ simple loop _ traced by the sle(@xmath145 ) loewner chain .",
    "we can say that the positive excursions of @xmath566 correspond to anti - clockwise loops while the negative ones correspond to clockwise loops .",
    "we have already mentioned that such chordal sle(@xmath145 ) chains are of particular interest because of the following properties @xcite : they are target - independent , and if @xmath1197 , then the process locally continues exactly as an sle@xmath1 targeting @xmath1198 .",
    "this makes it is possible ( see @xcite ) to construct a branching sle(@xmath1199 ) process whose law is invariant under conformal automorphisms of @xmath37 that fix the origin .",
    "in fact , it is also possible to define a radial version of the sle(@xmath145 ) process ( see @xcite ) in order to also explore the connected components that are `` cut out '' without having a point on the boundary of @xmath37 .",
    "this can be either defined using a `` radial - chordal '' equivalence ( like that of sle(6 ) ) or viewed as a rather direct consequence of the target - independence of the ( chordal ) sle(@xmath145 ) ( just interpreting the past of the sle as new boundary points ) .",
    "the obtained set is then dense in the upper half - plane , and it is therefore possible to define the family of all loops that are traced in this way : these are exactly the cle@xmath1 defined in @xcite . in particular , for any given choice of the root ( say at the origin i.e. , the sle(@xmath145 ) is started from @xmath1200 ) , any given @xmath40 in the upper half - plane is almost surely surrounded by an ( outermost ) loop in this cle@xmath1 , and we will denote it by @xmath1201 .    let us make the following simple observation that will be useful later on : suppose that @xmath1202 and @xmath1203 are two points in the upper half - plane , and that the ( random ) time @xmath1014 at which this ( branching ) sle(@xmath145 ) process separates @xmath1202 from @xmath1203 is finite",
    ". then , there are two possible ways in which this can happen :    * either @xmath1014 is the end - time of an excursion of @xmath566 , where the sle traced a closed loop that surrounds one of the two points but not the other . * or the sle has not yet traced a closed loop that surrounds one of the two points and not the other , but the loewner chain traced by the paths nevertheless separates the two points from one another .",
    "this can for instance happen if the sle(@xmath145 ) touches the boundary of the domain at a limit time that occurs after the tracing of infinitely many small loops ( recall that the sle(@xmath145 ) is not a simple path ) .",
    "the definition of sle(@xmath145 ) clearly shows that it is possible to reconstruct the process @xmath1156 starting from a poisson point process of ( positive ) bessel excursions @xmath1163 of the corresponding dimension .",
    "more precisely ( for the symmetrized bessel process ) , one defines also an i.i.d .",
    "family @xmath1204 ( with @xmath1205 ) of `` random signs '' and then defines @xmath566 by concatenating the excursions @xmath1206 .",
    "each individual excursion corresponds to a pinned loop @xmath1207 in the upper - half plane .",
    "in fact , this pinned loop is an sle excursion , and one has tossed the fair coin in order to decide whether to trace it clockwise or anti - clockwise . hence , an sle(@xmath145 ) defines the same poisson point process of pinned loops @xmath1208 with intensity @xmath70 as in section [ onepoint ] .",
    "but there is a difference in the way this poisson point process is used in order to construct the `` composition '' of the corresponding conformal maps @xmath1209 . here",
    ", one does not compose the conformal maps @xmath1209 that are normalized to have real derivative at @xmath438 .",

    "the point is therefore only to check that the effect of all these additional `` moebius rotations '' remains under control ( in other words , that it tends to @xmath45 when @xmath1091 , uniformly with respect to @xmath42 ) . but as we shall now see , this follows from the same arguments that allow us to define symmetrized bessel processes ( respectively symmetric @xmath287-stable processes ) as almost sure limits of processes obtained by the cut - off of all bessel excursions of small height or length ( resp .",
    "the cut - off of all jumps of small size ) i.e. , it is a straightforward consequence of the fact that @xmath526 : for each @xmath423 , we define @xmath1223 and @xmath1226 as before , and choose @xmath1234 in such a way that @xmath1235 .",
