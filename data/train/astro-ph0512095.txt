    "3.9 cm    * 4u  1538 - 52 * : the photon index , fluorescent iron - line flux , cut - off energy and the e - folding energy measured with the average spectrum taken over 23 ks does not show any substantial variation along the orbit .",
    "this suggests that the continuum x - ray spectrum of the pulsar is hardly affected during its revolution along the orbit .",
    "but we detected a notably smooth variation in n@xmath4 with orbital phase , increasing gradually by an order of magnitude as the pulsar approaches eclipse ( near phases 0.3 and 0.5 ; as measured from the periastron passage , fig .",
    "1 ) . at orbital phases",
    "far from the eclipse , the column density has a value of @xmath0 1.5 @xmath13 10@xmath14 h atoms @xmath15 .",
    "we compare the observed column density profile with a model estimated by assuming a spherically symmetric castor , abbott & klein ( cak 1975 ) wind from the companion star .",
    "the velocity profile of the wind is : @xmath16 = @xmath17@xmath18 , where @xmath17 : terminal velocity of the stellar wind , r@xmath19 : radius of the companion and r : radial distance from the centre of the companion star .",
    "the column density profiles were derived using a numerical integration along the line of sight from the pulsar to the observer for three different inclination angles of 65@xmath20 , 75@xmath20 and 85@xmath20 respectively . with a mass - loss rate of @xmath010@xmath21 m@xmath22 yr@xmath3 and v@xmath23 @xmath01000 km s@xmath3 ,",
    "the model calculations of n@xmath4 for different inclination angles when superposed on the observed values show fairly reasonable agreement ( fig .",
    "1 ) , indicating that a spherically symmetric stellar wind from the companion star may produce the observed orbital dependence of the column density for certain range of the orbital inclination .",
    "* gx  301 - 2 * : in most cases , the spectrum was fitted well with the pcam .",
    "the average values of the free parameters measured here over the full binary orbit ; viz .",
    "photon index , e - folding energy and cut - off energy follow the general trend which were earlier measured only in some phases of the binary period ( white et al .",
    "1983 , orlandini et al .",
    "but the variation of n@xmath7 & n@xmath8 with orbital phase was not smooth .",
    "the values were very high with a large variation throughout the binary orbit ( from 10@xmath14 to 10@xmath24 atoms @xmath15 ) , indicating a clumpy nature of the stellar wind ( fig .",
    "it is also seen from fig .",
    "2 that the covering fraction ( c.f . , defined as norm2/[norm1+norm2 ] ) remains substantially high almost throughout the orbit .",
    "this means that there is dense and clumpy material present all through . as in the case of 4u  1538 - 52",
    ", we compared the measured values of column densities with a model variation using a cak wind .",
    "the model values were of the order of 10@xmath14 to 10@xmath25 atoms @xmath15 ( fig .",
    "the peak between phases 0.1 and 0.2 was expected since the line of sight passes through the densest parts of the wind during these phases .",
    "thus it is clear that the observed variation in column density can not be explained by a spherically symmetric cak wind only , indicating probably strong inhomogeneties in the wind .",
    "now , as can be seen from fig .",
    "2 , the two iron lines included in our model show large increase in flux near periastron ( phase @xmath0 0.9 ) and a possible small increase near phase 0.1 ( at least for 1996 , filled squares ) .",
    "the peak near periastron is not very evident in the 1996 data due to the lack of enough observations , though an increasing trend can possibly be inferred .",
    "moreover , the equivalent width of the 6.4 kev iron - line showed a correlation with @xmath9 , suggesting that most of it is produced by the local clumpy matter surrounding the neutron star ."
