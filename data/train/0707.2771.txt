    "in many starburst , in interacting and in merging galaxies , a substantial fraction of star formation is concentrated in a number of compact ( @xmath0 10 pc ) , young ( a few 10@xmath1 yr ) and massive ( @xmath2 ) stellar clusters ( superstar clusters ; sscs ) .",
    "these entities may represent the dominant mode of star formation in these galaxies ( mccrady et al .",
    "2003 ; whitmore 2006 ) and if held by gravity they also represent the earliest stages of globular cluster evolution ( muoz - tun et al .",
    "2004 ) . their large uv photon output and their powerful , high velocity gaseous outflows ( the star cluster winds )",
    "are now believed to be the major responsible agents for the large - scale structuring of the interstellar medium ( ism ) and for the dispersal of heavy elements within their host galaxies and the intergalactic medium ( igm ) .",
    "m82-a1 is one of these sscs in the galaxy m82 ( smith et al .",
    "2006 ) , with a half - light radius @xmath3  pc , an age , @xmath4  myr , an uv photon output @xmath5",
    "s@xmath6 , and a mass , @xmath7 if one assumes an imf with a salpeter slope and 0.1 and 100 as the lower and upper mass cutoffs .",
    "stellar evolution synthesis models ( such as starburst 99 ; see leitherer et al .",
    "1999 ) predict an average mechanical energy input rate for m82-a1 equal to @xmath8 erg s@xmath6 .",
    "given such a large energy deposition rate , it seems surprising that m82-a1 is , after such an evolution time , still surrounded by a compact hii region , with a radius @xmath9pc , a density @xmath10 @xmath11 , a metallicity @xmath12 times solar and a total mass of only 5000 m@xmath13 , instead of having produced a large - scale superbubble .",
    "note that a similar argument can be made for many of the sscs embedded in the 150 pc nuclear region of m82 ( see de grijs et al .",
    "2001 ; melo et al . 2005 ) as well as for a number of the extragalactic hii regions ( kewley & dopita , 2002 ; dopita et al .",
    "2005 ) .",
    "smith et al .",
    "2006 suggested that the hii region associated to m82-a1 may result from the photoionization of a 4.5  pc shell blown into the ism by the central cluster .",
    "however as the observed size of the hii region is not consistent with the standard bubble model ( see weaver et al . 1977 ; bisnovatyi - kogan & silich 1995 and references therein ) , they assumed that the kinetic energy of the photoionized shell represents only a small fraction ( @xmath14 ) of the mechanical energy , @xmath15 , released inside the cluster and that the high pressure of the ambient medium has reduced the expansion velocity to 30 km s@xmath6 , the fwhm of the observed emission lines .",
    "this scenario , although intuitively correct , rises several questions .",
    "first , the spectro - photometric age of the cluster , @xmath16  myr ( smith et al .",
    "2006 ) , is inconsistent with the kinematic age of the shell ( @xmath17 ) even if one assumes 30 km s@xmath6 as the expansion speed throughout its evolution , @xmath18  yr .",
    "second , if the matter injected by supernovae and stellar winds is accumulated inside the hii radius , @xmath9  pc , then the gas number density should be , @xmath19 @xmath11 , where @xmath20 is the mean mass per ion , and a wind terminal speed @xmath21 km s@xmath6 was assumed .",
    "this density is an order of magnitude larger than that found in the hii region .",
    "note also that only a small fraction , @xmath22 , of this gas could be photoionized by m82-a1 and thus in this interpretation , a good fraction of the mass supplied by supernovae explosions and stellar winds is hidden somewhere within the 4.5  pc volume .",
    "these arguments imply that the cluster and hii region parameters are not consistent with the wind driven bubble model .    in order to have a consistent model , here we look at the detailed hydrodynamics of the gas reinserted by winds and supernovae within the cluster volume .",
    "the original adiabatic star cluster wind model , proposed by chevalier & clegg ( 1985 ) , described the various assumptions that have been used by all followers .",
    "assumptions such as the equal spacing between sources within the ssc volume and the fact that random collisions of the ejecta from nearby stellar winds and supernova explosions , were to result into a full thermalization of the matter reinserted by the evolving sources . under such conditions , the pressure of the thermalized matter would exceed that of the surrounding ism and the injected gas would be accelerated to leave the cluster with a high velocity , while establishing a stationary wind .",
    "for this to happen the gas has to acquire a particular velocity distribution , increasing almost linearly with radius from the stagnation point , the place where the gas velocity is equal to 0 km s@xmath6 , which occurs at the cluster center , to the sound speed , @xmath23 , that should occur at the cluster surface .",
    "out of the cluster , pressure gradients would allow the wind to reach its terminal speed ( @xmath24 @xmath25 ) .",
    "the observed parameters of sscs ( ho 1997 ; whitmore , 2003 ; turner et al . 2003 , 2004 ;",
    "pasquali et al .",
    "2004 ; melo et al . 2005 ; walcher et al .",
    "2005 ; martn hernndez et al . 2005 ; thompson et al . 2006 ; larsen , 2006 and references therein ) led us however , to re - analyze the original adiabatic model of chevalier & clegg ( 1985 ) and realize that in the case of massive and compact star clusters , radiative cooling may crucially affect the internal structure and the hydrodynamics of the flow ( silich et al .",
    "2004 ) . in a more recent communication , tenorio - tagle et al . ( 2007 ) have shown that if the mechanical luminosity of a cluster exceeds a critical value ( the threshold line ) , then a bimodal hydrodynamic solution for the matter reinserted by winds and sne is established . in such cases ,",
    "the densest central regions within the cluster volume undergo strong radiative cooling , what depletes the energy required to participate in the cluster wind .",
    "this also moves the stagnation radius , @xmath26 , out of the cluster center and promotes the accumulation and the re - processing of the enclosed matter , into further generations of stars ( tenorio - tagle et al .",
    ". meanwhile , the matter injected between the stagnation radius and the cluster surface is still able to drive a stationary wind .",
    "this however , cools rapidly at a short distance from the cluster surface and becomes exposed to the uv radiation escaping the cluster .",
    "wnsch et al .",
    "( 2007 ) has also shown that the location of the threshold line that separates clusters evolving in the bimodal regime from those with the stagnation point at the star cluster center , which are thus able to eject all of the deposited mass out of the cluster , can be well approximated by simple analytic expressions .",
    "this is also the case for the position of the stagnation radius , the radius that defines the amount of matter accumulated and ejected from a cluster in the bimodal regime . making use of these relationships and our semi - analytic code ( silich et al . 2004 ) ,",
    "here we propose another interpretation of smith s et al .",
    "( 2006 ) observations of m82-a1 , based on our bimodal solution .",
    "our model assumes that m82-a1 is embedded into a high pressure ism , the thermal pressure in the core of m82 ( @xmath27  @xmath11 k ) , which is much larger than that found in the disks of normal galaxies ( @xmath28  @xmath11 k , see , for example , slavin & cox , 1993 ) .",
    "our final suggestion is that m82-a1 is a good example of a cluster evolving in the catastrophic cooling regime and that a high pressure ism is what rapidly confines its wind , leading to its associated compact hii region .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we formulate our model , discuss the input physics and some approximations used in section 3 to develop a set of analytic equations which allow us to derive an approximate value of the heating efficiency required by the parameters of the m82-a1 cluster and its associated hii region .",
    "we confirm the analytic result by means of semi - analytic calculations in section 4 where we also thoroughly discuss the structure of the outflow driven by m82-a1 . in section 5",
    "we discuss the possible impact of m82-a1 , if immersed into different ism environments .",
    "in section 6 we summarize and discuss our results .",
    "the properties of m82-a1 and in particular its mass and expected mechanical energy input rate and the size and mass of its associated hii region , lead almost unavoidably to the conclusion that the cluster must be embedded into a high pressure region which has managed to confine the cluster wind .",
    "this implies a rapid hydrodynamic evolution which has caused the decay of the outer shock , inhibiting the formation of an outer shell of swept up matter and the built up of a superbubble ( as otherwise described in weaver et al .",
    "1977 ) . instead , a standing reverse shock sitting near the cluster surface , decelerates and thermalizes the outflow increasing its thermal pressure .",
    "the shocked gas then slows down while it cools and is displaced away from the cluster , as fresh wind matter enters the shock .",
    "the shocked gas thus recombines at a small distance behind the reverse shock and becomes exposed to the uv radiation from the cluster , forming a stationary hii region .",
    "note that upon cooling the shocked wind gas ought to undergo a rapid condensation to counterbalance the lost of temperature ( from the post - shock temperature to the assumed photoionization temperature @xmath2910@xmath30 k ) and be able to keep a pressure similar to that of the surrounding ism ( @xmath31 ) . in this model",
    "the hii region associated to the central cluster results from the photoionization of three different regions . the central zone within @xmath26 where the injected matter cools in a catastrophic manner .",
    "a second photoionized zone is generated within the free wind region as this gas cools suddenly to @xmath32k and finally , the shocked wind gas that has more recently being able to cool down from the high temperatures acquired after crossing the reverse shock .",
    "other wind material that experienced earlier the same evolution is steadily pushed out of the standing ionized outer shell by the newly incoming material , what allows for its recombination , its further cooling by radiation and to be further condensed so that its pressure remains equal to @xmath31 .",
    "major restrictions to the model arise from the pressure balance between @xmath31 and the wind ram pressure .",
    "this defines the position of the standing reverse shock , the size of the cooling distance that the shocked gas ought to travel before becoming exposed to the cluster uv radiation and which together with the available number of photons , defines also the size of the outer hii region , which must agree with the observations .",
    "here we show that to set @xmath33 in agreement with the observations , the location of @xmath34 and the size of its cooling distance imply that m82-a1 must be experiencing a bimodal hydrodynamic solution . in the bimodal regime",
    ", strong radiative cooling largely diminishes the cluster thermal pressure within the densest central zones .",
    "this leads to the accumulation of the matter reinserted within the cooling volume , reducing the amount of mass that a cluster returns to the ism .",
    "this also results into a slower acceleration of the matter injected in the outer segments of the cluster ( @xmath35 ) , what leads to a reduced terminal speed of the resultant wind ( see tenorio - tagle et al .",
    "2007 ; wnsch et al . 2007 ) . as shown below",
    ", these considerations allow us to predict which is the heating efficiency , or the fraction of the total energy input rate that is used to produce the wind of m82-a1 and which is the structure acquired by the outflow .    to derive an analytic expression for the position of the stagnation point , wnsch et al .",
    "( 2007 ) used the mass conservation law together with the fact that the density at the star cluster surface scales almost linearly with that at the stagnation point .",
    "they found that for star clusters with a given radii @xmath36 , the location of the stagnation radius depends on the excess star cluster mechanical luminosity above the critical value , @xmath37 : @xmath38^{1/3 } ,        \\\\[0.2 cm ]        \\label{eq1b }        & & \\hspace{0.0 cm } l_{crit } = \\frac{3 \\pi \\eta \\alpha^2 \\mu_i^2 r_{sc } v^4_{a\\infty } }        { 2 \\lambda_{st } }        \\left(\\frac{\\eta v^2_{a\\infty}}{2 }   - \\frac{c^2_{st}}{\\gamma-1}\\right ) , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath39 is the heating efficiency or fraction of the deposited kinetic energy that after full thermalization is not immediately radiated away , and thus is instead evenly spread within the star cluster volume , causing the overpressure that drives the wind ( stevens & hartwell 2003 , melioli & de gouveia dal pino 2004 ) . here",

    "note also that the density and the temperature at the stagnation radius are related by the equation ( see silich et al .",

    "interior to @xmath26 , cooling dominates over the heating provided by stellar winds and supernovae .",
    "the injected matter there cools down rapidly and is unavoidably reprocessed into new generations of stars supporting a low level of star formation as the parent cluster evolves ( see tenorio - tagle et al .",
    "2005 ) .",
    "the outer cluster zone , @xmath48 , is filled with hot thermalized ejecta unable to radiate away all of its thermal energy within a dynamical time scale , and thus capable of moving out of the cluster composing a stationary wind .",
    "the amount of mass reinserted by the cluster wind is ( wnsch et al .",
    "2007 ) : @xmath49 outside the cluster there is a free wind region ( @xmath50 ) bound by the standing reverse shock at a radius @xmath34 .",
    "the free wind is also able to cool rapidly , loosing its thermal pressure while becoming easy target of the cluster uv radiation field and thus forming another component of the hii region associated to the cluster . at the reverse shock the ejected material , which streams with its terminal velocity @xmath51 , is decelerated and re - heated .",

    "outside @xmath63 , the wind gas is photoionized by the uv radiation produced by the star cluster , forming a standing photoionized shell , with a pressure identical to that of the ism .",
    "note that the location of the various disturbances depends only on the assumed value of @xmath31 and on the terminal speed of the cluster wind . in this way , the density of the wind at the shock radius , @xmath64 , is @xmath65 where @xmath66 , the wind ram pressure , is equal to @xmath31 . in the strongly radiative case",
    "the terminal speed of the wind , @xmath51 , falls below the adiabatic value .",
    "nevertheless , one can use the adiabatic relation between @xmath51 and @xmath44 , the sound speed at the stagnation point ( see cant et al .",

    "this implies a completely different result from what one would expect from an adiabatic model , as a low heating efficiency leads to a bimodal hydrodynamic solution and with it to a low mass deposition rate into the ism with a much reduced outflow velocity .    furthermore , to match the observed parameters of m82-a1 and its associated hii region , our results lead also to a high pressure environment able to confine the cluster wind by setting a reverse shock close to the star cluster surface . in this way",
    "the outflow is thermalized , what leads to temperatures near the top of the interstellar cooling curve and thus to a rapid cooling of the strongly decelerated outflow .",
    "the wind becomes then target of the cluster uv radiation , composing a narrow standing outer shell of photoionized gas with the shocked wind matter that continuously traverses the reverse shock .",
    "our calculations lead to three hii region components associated to m82-a1 : a central component where the deposited matter cools catastrophically and does not participate in the wind .",
    "a section of the free wind region which , upon expansion , is also able to cool rapidly . and the outer stationary shell of shocked wind matter , which defines the observed size of the associated hii region .",
    "note that , given the densities in the latter component , this ought to be the one producing the most intense emission lines , while the second component is to produce a broad (   2 @xmath51 ) low intensity emission line component , similar to that detected in ngc 4214 - 1 ( see ho & filippenko 1996 ) , able to enhance , as in the case of m82-a1 , the width of the observed lines",
    ".      note that in the case of very young sscs ( a few myrs old ) their mass is usually derived from the intensity of their optical emission lines , emanating from their associated compact hii regions and thus through a measure of the available uv photon flux , an assumed imf and stellar synthesis models ( melo et al .",
    "2005 , smith et al .",
    "2006 ) . in the light of the models here",
    "presented , this implies both that young sscs are embedded into a high pressure ism and also that their heating efficiency ought to be rather small for their winds to be pressure confined in the immediate neighborhood of the clusters , and thus present an associated low mass and compact hii region .",
    "note also that the two different populations of massive and compact clusters ( gyr old and very young clusters ) present a similar range of masses as well as a similar size distribution",
    ". this can be explain if most of the mass reinserted by stellar winds and supernova explosions during the early evolutionary stages ( which may amount to 30 per cent of the @xmath118 released during the first 50 myr of evolution ) is not returned to the ism but rather re - processed in situ into further stellar generations .",
    "this would allow sscs to keep most of their mass ( and size ) as they age and are able to avoid their dispersal .",
    "this also implies that a large fraction of the low mass stars presently observed in old compact and massive stellar clusters might have formed from the matter injected by massive stars . in this respect",
    "our bimodal model provides the hydrodynamical ground to a self - enrichment scenarios . in these ,",
    "for example , the abundance anomalies observed in globular clusters may result from the enrichment of the proto - stellar gas during the earlier stages of their evolution ( see , for example , prantzos & charbonnell , 2006 ; decressing et al .",
    "2007 for a comprehensive discussion of different aspects of this problem ) .",
    "our solution also suggests that the metallicity of the compact hii regions associated with the intermediate age ( 5  myr - 10  myr ) massive clusters should be super - solar and variable with time .",
    "we thank our anonymous referee for valuable comments and suggestions .",
