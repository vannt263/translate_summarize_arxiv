    "today , laser cooling of atoms is widely used in experiments where high precision spectroscopy or precise control of the atomic motion is required .",
    "a large variety of schemes has been developed and applied to suit atoms with specific level structures and for obtaining particular temperature ranges @xcite . in general , the lower the wanted temperature , the more sensitive does the light scattering process has to be on the velocity of the atom . for the most simple laser cooling scheme relying on the doppler shift of an optical transition , doppler laser cooling ,",
    "this means the narrower the linewidth of the optical transition , the lower the obtainable temperature .",
    "however , since the maximum cooling force in the doppler cooling scheme is dependent on the photon scattering rate , narrow linewidth transitions will lead to longer cooling times than wider transitions .",
    "the aim of the present study is to show that by driving , with two step - wise near - resonant laser fields , a three - level ladder system having an intermediate metastable level and a dipole emitting upper level , it is indeed possible to obtain both short cooling times and at the same time low temperatures through changes of the laser parameters .",
    "the present results concern in particular alkali - like ions ba@xmath0 , sr@xmath0 , or ca@xmath0",
    "@xcite , but also contain information relevant for doppler cooling of alkali - earth metal atoms using intercombination lines  @xcite .",
    "in addition to the excellent laser cooling properties , the presented scheme has the major advantage that individual ions can be detected by dipole emitted light from the upper level to the ground level at a wavelength being the sum of those of the two excitation fields . by the appropriate choice of laser parameters , a large scattering rate can be obtained , which can lead to an essentially background - free detection as it has been demonstrated experimentally recently @xcite .",
    "previously , ladder- ( or cascade- ) schemes have been studied in  @xcite in the prospect of two - photon two - color doppler cooling on narrow lines like demonstrated experimentally in  @xcite on alkaline - earth metals using an intercombination line . in these studies , the excited state of a laser - driven transition",
    "is coupled by a second laser to an upper more stable level . in the present study ,",
    "the excited metastable level is coupled to a higher short - lived level , to enhance its coupling with the ground state .",
    "such an excitation scheme is used for example for sideband cooling , but while sideband cooling processes have already been studied theoretically  @xcite and experimentally  @xcite in the low saturation regime , the purpose of the present study is to go beyond the low saturation regime and to consider doppler cooling in the regime where the sidebands are not resolved , as considered experimentally previously  @xcite .",
    "our analysis applies to any atomic system that can be described by the ladder scheme depicted on fig .",

    "the considered atomic system is composed by three electronic levels which are coupled by laser fields , according to the ladder - scheme depicted in fig .  [ fig_ladder ] .",
    "state @xmath1 is the ground state , @xmath2 is metastable , and the excited state @xmath3 decays radiatively into @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "this configuration of levels occurs , for instance , in alkaline - earth atoms such as sr and ca , rare - earth atoms like yb and in alkali - like ions with a metastable @xmath4-orbital , such as hg@xmath0 , yb@xmath0 , ba@xmath0 , sr@xmath0 , or ca@xmath0 . in these last cases ,",
    "the relevant levels can be identified with the states @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",

    "the relaxation operator @xmath33 describes the radiative processes .",
    "the response of the atomic system to laser excitation is revealed by the occupation probabilities of the atomic levels , which can be monitored by the number of scattered photons .",
    "detection of the atoms is made on the transition with the highest fluorescence rate @xmath34 ( branching ratio @xmath35 for the ions mentioned above ) which lies in the blue domain ( @xmath36 nm ) .",
    "for the excitation scheme discussed in the following , this allows for photon detection without scattered light background since the excitation wavelengths lie in the red and near infra - red domain ( @xmath37 nm ) .",
    "this major advantage does not hold for hg@xmath38 nor yb@xmath0 for which the excitation and emission wavelengths are very close . in the following ,",

    "it should be noted that the dipole ( strong ) and the quadrupole ( weak ) couplings differ by some orders of magnitude .",
    "nevertheless , powerful lasers in the red and near infra - red domain are now widely available and , assuming proper focussing of the laser beam , rabi frequencies of the order of 1 mhz can be reached on the quadrupole transition .",
    "to give an idea of the feasible rabi frequencies , let us mention that , for ca@xmath0 , 200 mw of laser power at 729  nm focussed on a waist radius of 50 @xmath39 m results in @xmath40 mhz  @xcite .",
    "in this section we look for the solutions of eq .",
    "( [ eq_master ] ) when the motion of the particle can be neglected . for numerical applications and when approximations are needed in analytical expressions , parameters leading to a strong driving of the @xmath41 transition with reduced sensitivity to doppler shift are chosen ( @xmath42 ) .",
    "furthermore , to remain close to experimental conditions , we do not require excessively large rabi frequency on the @xmath43 transition and assume @xmath44 .    in order to get some insight in the problem",
    ", the dressed state picture of the system can be of help in the limiting case where the weak coupling beam can be considered as a probe of the atom dressed by the photons of the strong transition . in this picture , the @xmath2 state is broadened and shifted by the strong coupling @xmath18 . for negative detuning @xmath45",
    "we expect the @xmath43 transition resonance to be shifted to @xmath46 .",
    "this is confirmed on fig .",
    "[ fig_popls ] where the lineshape of the excitation probability in the @xmath2 state @xmath47 shows a maximum very close to this value .",
    "increasing the detuning @xmath45 decreases the light - shift as well as the power - broadened linewidth of the @xmath48 transition , resulting in an increase of the maximum of @xmath49 for constant coupling strength @xmath18 .    in an experiment ,",
    "the measured signal is proportional to the probability @xmath50 to be in the @xmath3 state .",
    "its dependance with the detuning @xmath45 does not follow the same rule as @xmath49 and fig .",
    "[ fig_popls ] clearly shows that a maximum excitation probability can be reached for a good choice of this detuning .",

[ eq_popp ]",
    "can be connected to the dressed state picture if one keeps in mind that for @xmath55 , @xmath56 .    in the limit where",
    "@xmath57 , the condition for maximum occupation probability of the @xmath3 state , and thus for maximum fluorescence signal , can also be derived analytically from eq .",
    "[ eq_popp ] . in first order in @xmath58 ,",
    "this maximum is found for @xmath59 this correction to the light - shift can be omitted in the evaluation of the maximum population @xmath60 as it adds a correction in second order in @xmath58 , which is negligible for the set of parameters of interest . for @xmath61 ,",
    "this maximum is @xmath62 this last equation rules the maximum scattering rate , observed when the detuning of the weak transition is adjusted to the light - shift induced by the strong coupling . assuming this detuning @xmath63 is adjusted , for each rabi frequency @xmath17 ( which is experimentally the limiting factor ) there is an optimal set ( @xmath64 ) which maximises @xmath60 .",
    "this optimal set can be found numerically but better understanding can be gained in the particular case of large detunings @xmath65 for which the light - shift can be approximated by the simple form @xmath66 . with this simplification ,",
    "the optimal set is described by the analytic expression : @xmath67 which corresponds to the maximum population @xmath68 this expression is simplified in @xmath69 if @xmath70 is negligible compared to @xmath71 .",
    "equation ( [ eq_popt ] ) confirms the dependance of the maximum population @xmath60 with @xmath72 , observed on fig .",
    "[ fig_popls ] .",

    "this factor is of the order of 0.75 for ba@xmath0 and 0.95 for ca@xmath0 and sr@xmath0 .",
    "since the previous equations show that different values of @xmath72 result only in a variation of the maximum population ( eq .  [ eq_popt ] ) and optimal set of parameters to reach it ( eq .  [ eq_opt ] ) , @xmath72 is fixed to 1 in the following .",
    "this simplification results mainly in a slight underestimation of the number of scattered photons but allows to handle more general equations .    beside the dependance on the branching factors ,",
    "it is worth noting that the optimal population given in eq .",
    "[ eq_popt ] behaves like @xmath73 , and not like @xmath74 , as a simple two level picture would have suggested .",
    "this linear behaviour is confirmed by numerical calculations , even out of the range of the simplifying approximation @xmath75 .",
    "this is illustrated on fig .",
    "[ fig_optp ] where the probabilities of occupation of the three levels , derived from eq .",
    "[ eq_master ] with no approximations , are plotted for different values of @xmath17 . for each detuning on the strong transition @xmath45",
    ", the weak transition detuning is adjusted to the light - shift due to the strong coupling : @xmath55 . for a given value of @xmath18",
    ", these curves confirm an optimum value for @xmath45 which maximises the resonance value @xmath60 .",
    "the numerical results also confirm the linear dependance of the maximal population with @xmath17 and obey the simplified analytic solution given in eq .",
    "[ eq_popt ] to better than 3% .",
    "following eq .",
    "[ eq_opt ] , the optimum of @xmath45 is expected to behave like @xmath76 . this",
    "is also confirmed by the numerical results which show that the simplified equation eq .",
    "[ eq_opt ] reproduces numerical observation for optimal @xmath45 to better than 7% for the value of @xmath17 chosen for this figure .",
    "we can compare this result with the case where the strong coupling is maximum ( @xmath77 ) .",
    "then @xmath78 and in the regime described by @xmath79 , the maximum of @xmath60 is @xmath80 .",
    "for the realistic conditions we are concerned with ( namely @xmath81 ) , the maximum population in @xmath3 and thus the maximum number of scattered photons is smaller by a factor proportional to @xmath82 to what can be expected for large detuning @xmath45 ( see eq .",
    "[ eq_popt ] for comparison ) .    to know if the ladder - scheme can result in enough scattered photons to be efficiently detected , it is useful to compare this scheme with the one usually used for detection and doppler cooling of the considered trapped ions @xcite .",
    "it consists in the excitation on the @xmath83 and @xmath41 transitions , the last one being required for repumping ions decayed in the metastable state .",
    "this system forms a @xmath84-scheme and solving the optical bloch equations for this system , one can show that the maximum occupation probability in the @xmath3 state is close to 20 % .",
    "the parameters chosen for fig .",
    "[ fig_optp ] show a maximum close to 2 % for the ladder - scheme .",
    "the complete absence of background signal due to scattered light largely compensates a reduction of absolute fluorescence signal by an order of magnitude .",
    "furthermore , an occupation probability of the excited state as high as 10 % can be found by numerical calculations with rabi frequencies on the weak transition of 7 mhz .",
    "these are achieved by tight focussing of laser power superior to 500 mw .",
    "the linewidth @xmath85 of the fluorescence resonance profile with the laser detuning @xmath63 and its dependance on the two couplings can be also studied numerically .",
    "this study gives evidence for two different types of behaviour for this linewidth ( see fig .",
    "[ fig_widthp ] ) : when @xmath18 is small compared to @xmath45 , the linewidth has a constant value , which increases linearly with @xmath17 .",
    "once @xmath86 , the linewidth grows with @xmath18 and becomes independent on @xmath17 . to reflect this behaviour in the analytic expression of the resonance linewidth",
    ", we first assume that @xmath17 is the smallest parameter of the problem ( @xmath87 ) , to extract a limit linewidth we call @xmath88 ( fwhm ) : @xmath89 this expression is simplified in the regime where @xmath90 and can be written like : @xmath91 then , we assume that the increasing weak transition coupling power broadens this limit linewidth , resulting in the effective linewidth @xmath85 @xmath92 for strong saturation ( @xmath93 ) , @xmath94 tends to the maximum value of @xmath95 , and @xmath96 . for low saturation",
    ", the limit linewidth behaves like @xmath97 and tends to 0 , the main contribution to the linewidth is then due to the weak coupling : @xmath98 .",
    "this dependance of @xmath85 with @xmath99 is shown on fig .",
    "[ fig_widthp ] for different values of @xmath17 and a far detuned strong coupling laser @xmath100 .",
    "the comparison between eq .",
    "[ eq_geff ] and the exact fwhm of the resonance profile of @xmath52 with @xmath63 , calculated numerically , shows a very good agreement as long as @xmath17 remains weak compared to @xmath101 .",
    "when this approximation is not valid , the methods used above result in an overestimation of the linewidth for @xmath102 ( dash - dotted line of fig .  [ fig_widthp ] ) .",
    "these curves show that the effective linewidth of the excitation scheme can be adjusted continuously by the ratio @xmath99 . when this ratio is chosen to optimize the maximum of @xmath52 ( see eq .",
    "[ eq_opt ] ) , the effective linewidth can be evaluated through eq .",
    "[ eq_geff ] . for @xmath103 , @xmath104 and @xmath105 .",
    "this value gives the lower boundary for an estimation of the effective linewidth when parameters are set to optimise the excited population .",
    "so far we have neglected the effect of the center - of - mass motion on the atomic dynamics . in the following ,",
    "the considered atoms are trapped in a harmonic potential , like in @xcite , their motion is periodic and can give rise to sidebands @xcite . to quantify the efficiency of the proposed two - step doppler cooling , we assume that the effective linewidth @xmath85 is larger than the frequencies of oscillation @xmath106 of the ions in the trap .",
    "practically , it means that the sidebands are not resolved in the absorption spectra and from the point of view of laser - atom interactions , the atoms can be considered as free @xcite .",
    "furthermore , we also assume that the recoil frequency @xmath107 ( @xmath108 being @xmath12 or @xmath14 ) is smaller than the effective linewidth @xcite and that the frequencies of oscillation are high enough so that the root mean square of the velocity @xmath109 is not significantly changed during one oscillation period . within these boundary conditions , the effect of the atom motion can be taken into account in the master equation ( eq .  [ eq_master ] ) and its stationary state solution ( eq .  [ eq_popp ] ) by the doppler effect which shifts the detuning from @xmath45 to @xmath110 and @xmath63 to @xmath111 .    to simplify the notations",
    ", we consider a one dimensional problem , extrapolation to three dimensions being obvious .",
    "we assume that the two lasers propagate along the same axis , so @xmath112 is the velocity along that axis and the positive sign is defined with respect to @xmath113 .",
    "consequently , the projection @xmath114 is positive ( negative ) if the laser on the strong transition copropagates ( counterpropagates ) with the laser on the weak transition . by definition",
    ", @xmath115 is always positive .    for travelling waves , the radiative force @xmath116 leading to doppler cooling results from momentum transferred to the atom by photons on absorption / emission cycles .",
    "it is exactly the gradient of the atom - light interaction potential @xcite given in eq .",
    "[ ham ] : @xmath117 . using the relations induced for the stationary state density matrix by the master equation",
    ", one can show that this definition is equivalent to @xmath118 . in the simplifying case where the decay from @xmath3 to @xmath119 is neglected ( @xmath120 ) , the radiative force is @xmath121 this is exactly the result one would obtain by analogy with a two level system where the momentum transferred on each absorption / emission cycle is @xmath122 ( when averaged on several cycles ) and where the number of cycles per unit time is the excited state scattering rate @xmath21 times the probability to be in this excited state @xmath52 .",
    "the introduction of the effective momentum @xmath123 as the momentum transferred to the atoms is very significant .",
    "it demonstrates that the role of the coupling on the strong transition is not only to shorten the lifetime of the metastable state @xmath2 , which would be independent on the relative direction of the two lasers .",
    "this sensitivity of the cooling process to the relative direction of propagation has been experimentally demonstrated in @xcite .",
    "@xmath124 can be split in a constant force @xmath125 , which acts on an immobile atom and in a velocity dependent force @xmath126 , responsible for the cooling process . for trapped particles , @xmath125 shifts the center of the trajectory by @xmath127 and",
    "is not involved in the cooling .",
    "the cooling force , proportional to @xmath128 can be considered as a damping force @xmath129 only at first order in @xmath112 ( _ i.e. _ for @xmath130)@xcite .    in the approximation where @xmath17 is the smallest relevant coupling parameter ,",
    "the analytic expression of the slope of @xmath52 with @xmath112 is simple enough to give an insight to the dependence of @xmath131 with the coupling parameters : @xmath132 first , one can check that for negative detuning @xmath45 and negative relative detuning @xmath133 , the @xmath131 coefficient is positive and damping effectively takes place .",
    "secondly , the particularity of the regime of large detunings @xmath45 and low saturation ( @xmath134 ) for the strong transition is revealed by eq .",
    "[ eq_beta ] . indeed , in this limit , the detuning @xmath63 ( which is very close to @xmath135 ) , is negligible compared to @xmath45 and then , only @xmath115 controls the slope of @xmath52 with @xmath112 .",
    "it means that the velocity dependance of the force is proportional to @xmath136 , and that , at first order in @xmath112 , the efficiency of the strong coupling is not reduced by the doppler effect .",
    "nevertheless , the relative direction of the two lasers remains relevant for the effective momentum @xmath137 transferred to the atoms as the ratio between the sum and the difference of the two wavevectors @xmath115 and @xmath114 is equal to 11.9 for ca@xmath0 , 4.4 for sr@xmath0 and 1.9 for ba@xmath0 .",
    "when the light - shift becomes non - negligible compared to @xmath45 , the slope becomes steeper for copropagating lasers .",
    "however , the major effect of the relative direction of propagation remains the size of the effective momentum @xmath137 . in the following ,",
    "we consider only the case where the two lasers are copropagating and call @xmath138 the maximum effective momentum .",
    "[ fig_beta ] shows the damping coefficient @xmath131 for two different values of @xmath17 , in a regime where the effective linewidth depends on @xmath17 .",
    "the efficiency of the damping shows a maximum , which corresponds to a minimum of the cooling time , for detuning @xmath139 increasing with the linewidth of the signal .",
    "numerical results show that , for fixed rabi frequency on the weak transition @xmath17 , @xmath131 is maximised and so the cooling time minimised for @xmath140 close to its optimum defined to reach maximum fluorescence ( see eq .",
    "[ eq_opt ] ) . in practice ,",
    "maximising the fluorescence rate also results in reducing the cooling time and this optimum condition was used for plots on fig .",
    "[ fig_beta ] .",
    "the curves show that , with this condition , the maxima of the damping are very close and that the advantage of an increase in @xmath17 is mainly to broaden the frequency range where damping is efficient .    the temperature reached by doppler cooling results from the equilibrium between the damping due to the momentum transfer and the diffusion induced by spontaneous emission . by conservation of energy ,",
    "the scattered photons have the momentum @xmath138 and by analogy with two - level systems , the diffusion coefficient is @xcite @xmath141 and the temperature reached is @xmath142 .",
    "numerical calculations show that the minimum temperature @xmath143 is reached for @xmath144 like expected by analogy with a two level system .",
    "they also show that the relevant parameter for the strong coupling is the ratio @xmath145 since for identical ratio , different values of @xmath45 or @xmath18 give the same results .",
    "the minimum temperature @xmath143 is plotted on fig .",
    "[ fig_td ] versus @xmath99 , for the wavelengths of ca@xmath38 and with copropagating lasers .    like the effective linewidth",
    ", the limit temperature can be adjusted continuously down to few @xmath39k by the choice of @xmath140 , the lowest temperature being controlled by @xmath17 . as a comparison ,",
    "the limit temperature reached by doppler cooling on the allowed dipole @xmath83 transition on ca@xmath0 ions is 0.55 mk .",
    "contrary to a two - level system , the doppler limit temperature can be lowered , but to the detriment of the fluorescence rate .",
    "nevertheless , as low temperatures can be reached by continously reducing the effective linewidth , the cooling process can be started with a high damping factor , resulting in a total cooling time shorter than if the cooling process would be made permanently on a very narrow transition . as for the capture range , defined by the velocity for which the cooling force is maximal , numerical results confirm the intuitive idea that it increases with the effective linewidth @xmath85 , which in practice , increase with @xmath146 and/or @xmath17 ( see part [ sec_width ] ) .",
    "it is possible to reach a broad capture range at the same time as keeping a high damping factor and fluorescence rate by incresing @xmath146 and obeying the optimum condition defined in [ sec_popp ] ( eq .",
    "[ eq_opt ] ) .",
    "this is shown on fig .",
    "[ fig_capture ] where the dependence of the effective force @xmath147 with the root mean square velocity is plotted for the condition leading to the minimum doppler limit , @xmath148 . within the assumption defined at the beginning of this section , this effective force can be approximated by @xmath149 .    the lowest temperatures shown on fig .",
    "[ fig_td ] have only a theoretical meaning as , in practice , for reaching these temperatures , the effective linewidth of the system must be reduced and reach values smaller than the recoil and the oscillation frequencies .",
    "then , to make predictions , other mechanisms than the doppler cooling have to be taken into account , as the well known sideband cooling which will not be developed here but for which efficiency has been experimentally demonstrated @xcite .",
    "we have studied a two - step photoexcitation process in a ladder - system with a metastable intermediate state , as can be found _",
    "e.g. _ in alkaline - earth atoms and in alkali - like ions . in case of ca@xmath0 , sr@xmath0 and ba@xmath0",
    ", the two excitation wavelengths belong to the red or infrared domain whereas the scattered photons lie in the blue domain , which offers the possibility of fluorescence detection without stray light background .",
    "our numerical and analytical studies show that this excitation process can be a powerful alternative for the detection of ions or readout of their internal state .",
    "indeed , the number of photons can easily reached a tenth of what is expected from direct excitation on a dipole allowed transition and the absence of background signal due to scattered light can compensate this lower signal .",
    "furthermore , we demonstrate that two - step doppler cooling can efficiently take place and that resolution of oscillation sidebands is not required to reach temperatures lower than 100 @xmath39k . the width of the resonance profile and the doppler limit temperature can be varied continuously by tuning the power and/or detuning on the dipole allowed transition .",
    "this cooling mechanism can be of great interest for traps with low oscillation frequencies or with geometry leading to a high stray light level like microtraps .",
