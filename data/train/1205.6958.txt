    "accretion of gas onto the central supermassive black hole is one of the fundamental astrophysical processes responsible for high - efficient energy release in active galactic nuclei ( agns ) . according to the difference in the luminosity",
    ", agns are classified into two types , low - luminosity agns ( llagns ) and high - luminosity agns ( hlagns ) .",
    "the llagns show hard power - law x - rays and/or radio jets ; while the hlagns are characterized by the big blue bump around uv waveband , soft x - ray excess , fe @xmath6 lines at about 6.4 kev , the power - law x - rays with photon index @xmath7 and cutoff at about a few of @xmath8 .",
    "it is speculated that the different characteristics of llagns and hlagns are caused by different accretion mechanism at different accretion rates , in a similar way to black hole x - ray binaries .",
    "the accretion in llagns is via an advection dominated accretion flow ( adaf ) ( ichimaru 1977 ; narayan & yi 1994 , 1995a , 1995b ) , in which most of the accretion energy is stored in the gas as entropy and only a small fraction is radiated in hard x - rays(see kato , fukue & mineshige 2008 for a review ) . while in hlagns ,",
    "the common accepted accretion model is a hybrid accretion disk , i.e. , a cool disk is embedded in a hot corona .",
    "the optical to uv emission is from the optically thick and geometrically thin accretion disk ( e.g. , shakura & sunyaev 1973 ; lynden - bell & pringle 1974 ) and the hard x - ray is from compton scattering of the soft photons from the disk by the hot electrons in the optically thin corona with @xmath9 .",
    "observations show that the x - ray luminosity contributes a large fraction to the bolometric luminosity in hlagns .",
    "this can be seen from individual spectra ( e.g. elvis et al.1994 ; ho 2008 ) .",
    "the hard x - ray bolometric correction , which is defined as the ratio of bolometric luminosity to @xmath2 luminosity , is typically around @xmath10 with eddington ratio above 0.1 , while below 0.1 it is typically @xmath11 ( vasudevan & fabian 2009 ) , which confirms the importance of x - ray radiation in llagns",
    ". fits to the x - ray spectra of hlagns by comptonization model yield an electron temperature of @xmath12k in the optically thin hot corona ( e.g. liu et al . 2003 ) .",
    "a question arises as , how can the gas in the corona retain at so high a temperature when continuously radiates strong x - rays in hlagns ? where is the heating energy from ?",
    "theoretically , gas accreted from interstellar medium or secondary is cold . in the way of accretion to the central black hole , some of the gas evaporates to the corona and then accretes inward in the corona . in hlagns",
    ", gas is dominantly accreted via a thin disk , only a small fraction of gas is accreted in the hot corona . therefore , the energy released in the corona through accretion is much smaller than that in the disk .",
    "this implies that the radiation from the hot corona is much weaker than that from the disk in a steady disk - corona flow . with strong radiation in x - rays",
    "as observed in hlagns , the corona is over - cooled in a thermal timescale and collapses to the disk unless there is other energy supply to the corona besides the viscous heating .",
    "recent investigations on the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) in hlagns found that the bolometric correction increases with increasing eddington ratio @xmath13 ( @xmath14 ) , whereas independent on the black hole mass ( vasudevan & fabian 2007 , 2009 ; lu & yu 1999 ; wang et al .",
    "2004 ; liu et al .",
    "this correlation provides clues and constraints to possible heating mechanisms to the disk corona in hlagns .    in this work ,",
    "we study the corona flow at high accretion rates in the frame of disk corona evaporation / condensation model . by inclusion of additional heating to the corona , we investigate the detailed interaction , i.e. the mass and energy exchange between disk and corona , we self - consistently determine the corona structure and disk radiation features .",
    "the spectrum from the disk and corona is calculated by monte carlo simulations .",
    "comparing the spectrum with observational features , we discuss the possible heating mechanism in hlagns .",
    "our aim is to interpret the sed and its correlation with eddington ratio .",
    "hlagns include radio - loud and radio - quiet seyfert 1s and qsos .",
    "since the radio - loud agns are assumed to be powered by the jet and the beaming effect will dilute the x - ray radiation from the central accretion engine , here we focus on accretion mechanism for the radio - quiet agns .",
    "most narrow line seyfert 1s are also radio - quiet hlagns . however , since they accrete at rate near eddington accretion rate and the character of their spectra ( e.g. soft x - ray excess and steeper / softer hard x - ray emission ) are dramatically different from other hlagns , they are not include here and will be investigated in the future work .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we present the model .",
    "the numerical results are shown in the section 3 .",
    "section 4 and section 5 are the discussion and conclusion , respectively .",
    "the disk evaporation model was proposed by meyer & meyer - hofmeister ( 1994 ) for dwarf novae and developed to black hole binaries by meyer , liu & meyer - hofmeister ( 2000a ) . in this model ,",
    "an optically thin , hot corona is assumed to lie above a thin disk .",
    "vertical conduction is important since the disk temperature is much lower than that of the corona .",
    "as the corona radiates inefficiently , the conductive heat accumulates downwards and at the transition layer it heats up some cool gas until an equilibrium density is reached so as to radiate completely the conductive flux .",
    "the evaporated gas is then accreted through the corona to the central black hole .",
    "such a corona is heated up by viscosity and the accretion is supplied by mass evaporation from the disk .",
    "further investigations on effects of decoupling between ions and electrons and compton cooling in the corona ( liu et al .",
    "2002a ) , the magnetic pressure ( meyer - hofmeister & meyer 2001 ; qian , liu & wu 2007 ) , the change of viscosity parameter ( qiao & liu 2009 ) and the possible condensation are included .",
    "the model has been successfully used to interpret the state transition and observational features in low / hard state of the black hole binaries .",
    "as the disk corona is independent on the black hole mass , it is also applied to agns in explaining different types of spectra and the absence of the broad line region in llagns ( liu et al . 2009a ) .",
    "nevertheless , when it is compared with observations in hlagn , we find that in the corona strong compton cooling leads to the corona so weak that it can not produce the hard x - ray as high as observed .",
    "there must be other energy sources besides the viscous heating for the corona .",
    "there are some pioneer works assuming that a certain fraction of local gravitational energy is liberated directly in the corona ( e.g. nakamura & osaki 1993 ; haardt & maraschi 1991 , 1993 ) , particularly in the frame of a magnetized disk corona ( e.g. , di matteo 1998 ; di matteo , celotti , & fabian 1999 ; miller & stone 2000 ; merloni & fabian 2002 ; liu et al . 2002b , 2003 ; kawanaka , kato , & mineshige 2008 ; cao 2009 ) .",
    "in these investigations it is demonstrated that the corona can indeed produce as strong x - ray as observed in hlagns if a large fraction of accretion energy is released in the corona .",
    "nevertheless , the mass exchange between the two - phase accretion flows was not taken into account . here",
    "we consider both radiation and mass coupling between disk and corona and study the detailed vertical structure of the coronal flow above a thin disk supposing some fraction ( @xmath1 ) of the gravitational energy is added into the corona .",
    "the corona can be described by the following equations .",
    "equation of state @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the molecular weight assuming a standard chemical composition ( @xmath17 ) for the corona .",
    "here we assume @xmath18 , which is strictly true only for a pure hydrogen plasma .",
    "equation of continuity @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the radial component of velocity , @xmath21 is the isothermal sound speed , @xmath22 is the angular component of velocity . here ,",
    "the partial derivative of mass flux with respect to radius is approximated as , @xmath23 , where @xmath24 depends on the net mass gain / loss rate through the radial boundaries ( meyer - hofmeister & meyer 2003 ; liu et al . 2004 ) . in this work",
    ", @xmath25 is taken for the case that no mass enters through the outer boundary and all the mass flowing in the corona is contributed by the evaporation ( meyer et al .",
    "2000a ) .",
    "equation of the @xmath26-component of momentum is @xmath27    in the hot corona , because of heavier mass of ions than that of electrons , the viscous heating raises the ion temperature first and ions are cooling by coulomb collision with electrons and both radial and vertical advection .",
    "here we do nt include direct heat to electrons .",
    "the ion thermal conduction is not taken into account because of the long mean free path compared to the vertical scale height of the corona .",

    "liu et al . ( 1995 ) showed that the coronal temperature increases from effective temperature to @xmath73 k in a very thin layer of nearly constant pressure .",
    "its physics is described by the balance between thermal conduction and radiation loss .",
    "so a relation can be established between temperature and heat flux which can be scaled according to the pressure . combining with shmeleva - syrovatskii relation as @xmath74 ( shmeleva & syrovatskii 1973 ) ,",

    "we then calculate the spectrum from such a disk and corona for given structure .    in the corona ,",
    "the emissions are from bremsstrahlung radiation and inverse compton scattering of disk photons . for bremsstrahlung cooling spectrum ,",

    "since we focus on hlagns , of which the accretion rate is very high and the disk is the dominant accretion flow , the soft photons for inverse compton scatter are supplied by the thin disk blackbody radiation .",
    "however , the ones from bremsstrahlung emission are neglected because of similar energies to the electrons and can not gain much from compton scattering ( done 2010 , done et al .",
    "we compute the compton spectrum by monte carlo simulation .",
    "the accretion flow consists of a cold disk in the middle and hot corona above / below . at each radius ,",
    "the cold disk emits black body radiation with the temperature @xmath60 as shown in the model equation ( [ e : teff ] ) .",
    "the soft photons from the local disk transverse through the hot corona .",
    "since the hot corona is optically thin , some of the soft photons pass through it without scattering , some of them are scattered by the electrons in the corona .",
    "we calculate the energy spectra of photons that emerge from the corona .",
    "the method of monte carlo simulation used in our paper is essentially the same as that described by pozdnyakov et al.(1977 ) . in the code",
    ", we introduce the weight @xmath88 to efficiently calculated the effects of multiple scattering .",
    "firstly , we set initial weight @xmath89 for a given soft photon from the cold disk .",

    "the value of @xmath91 is the transmitted portion and is recorded to calculate the penetrate spectrum .",
    "the remaining weight @xmath92 is the portion that undergoes more than one scattering .",

    "is fixed to be 0.3 .",
    "first , we set @xmath103 , meaning @xmath104 , which is the case that the corona is heated by only viscous friction .",
    "we calculate the corona structures at @xmath105 for @xmath106 and @xmath107 as shown in the fig.[fig : f=0.0 structure ] , here @xmath108 which is the total accretion rate . comparing the results in two panels ,",
    "we find that the vertical profiles of the coronal quantities are similar for different accretion rates . from the lower boundary upwards , the pressure ( @xmath109 ) and the vertical mass flow ( @xmath110 ) decrease dramatically in a thin layer .",
    "the downward heat flux ( @xmath111 ) increases in this layer until a maximum is reached and then decreases along @xmath26 and can be neglected on the upper boundary .",

    "these typical features in disk corona , which are also shown in earlier works ( e.g. meyer et al .",

    "the results are shown in fig.[fig : evap - rate - huadd0.0 ] .",
    "similar to the previous works ( e.g. liu at al .",
    "2002a ) , the coronal accretion rate increases toward the central black hole , reaches a maximum at a few hundred schwarzschild radius and then drops very quickly in the inner region because of strong inverse compton scattering , i.e. a large fraction of the corona gas condensing onto the disk near the black hole . comparing the three evaporation curves for accretion rate , @xmath124=0.02 ,  0.2 and 0.4",
    ", we find that the maximum evaporation rate decreases with increasing accretion rate and the corona gas begins condensing at outer regions for higher accretion rate .",
    "the temperature in electrons , as shown in fig.1 , is lower at higher accretion rates .",

    "qiao & liu ( 2009 ) investigated the influence of viscosity parameter @xmath102 in the corona and suggested that the coronal radiation is largely enhanced when viscosity increases .",

    "1988 ; honma , matsumoto & kato 1991 ; szuszkiewicz & miller 1998 ; see however , hirose et al.(2009 ) who claimed no instability by local radiation - hydrodynamical simulations ) . however , if a fraction of accretion energy is liberated in the corona or the outflow the disk can be stable ( nakamura & osaki 1993 ; svensson & zdziarski 1994 ) .",
    "the magnetic heating to the corona discussed here is helpful to stabilize the disk , though @xmath1 is not large enough .      in our corona , we assume that all of the viscously dissipated energy heats ions only .",
    "however , direct heating to the electrons can also increase the corona emission . according to the detailed modeling to sgr a * ( yuan et al .",
    "2003 ) , a significant fraction of the viscously dissipated energy should heat electrons directly .",
    "such a result was later supported by the numerical simulation done by sharma et al .",
    "nevertheless , this effect is negligible if much larger additional heating to the corona is assumed . when a strong disk exists under a corona as in luminous agn , a small fraction of disk accretion energy transported to coronal electrons can dominate the coronal heating .",
    "for instance , assuming @xmath210 and @xmath156 , the additional heating to the corona is 0.02 ( in unit of eddington luminosity ) ; while the accretion rate in the corona , as shown in fig.4 , is @xmath211 to @xmath212 in the major radiation region , which produces viscous heat of @xmath211 to @xmath212 ( in unit of eddington luminosity ) .",
    "even if all of this viscous heating directly goes to electrons , it is much smaller than the additional heating 0.02 .",
    "the ratio is in the range of 0.5% to 5% .",
    "this ratio is nearly the same for a higher @xmath1 since the accretion rate in the corona increases with increasing @xmath1 . for an accretion rate",
    "higher than 0.2 , the ratio is smaller , which can be derived from the accretion rate of corona shown in the right panel of fig.4 .",
    "therefore , the neglect of viscous heating directly to electrons is a reasonable approximation .",
    "when the accretion is greater than @xmath213 , the line driven wind and radiation pressure driven wind will be important , which results in the accretion rate decreasing with the decrease of radius as @xmath214 ( @xmath215)(see proga et al .",
    "2000 ; ohsuga et al .",
    "it is clear that with wind loss the soft - photon field becomes weaker than the case without winds .",
    "therefore , the compton cooling is weaker , leading to less condensation .",
    "when the system reaches equilibrium , the spectrum can be harder .",
    "this is the case without additional energy input . in this work",
    ", an additional energy is added into the corona and we find that the larger the @xmath1 is , the harder the spectrum is .",
    "since @xmath216 , the energy generating rate @xmath217 is still dominated by the innermost region .",
    "thus , the wind loss causes a decrease of disk luminosity and hence a harder spectrum .",
    "however , if wind mass loss is very significant , there could be no longer optically thick disk and the effects are large .",
    "a corona lying above a cool disk can illuminate the disk , which increases the energy density of soft photons , leading to stronger coronal radiation .",
    "this effect can be significant in the case of a strong corona above a truncated disk .",
    "however , for a relatively weak corona above a strong disk , as the case of hlagns , the effect of irradiation is unimportant .",
    "we estimate this effect as follows .",
    "photons emitted from corona are roughly isotropic , about half of which go down to a slab - like disk , irradiating the disk .",
    "the irradiating flux is ,    @xmath218    where @xmath59 is albedo which is usually taken as 0.15 ( e.g. zdziarski et al .",
    "this flux is scattered / absorbed in the disk and eventually re - emitted , contributing to the soft photon field .",
    "the ratio of this illuminating flux to the disk radiation , @xmath219 , is @xmath220 this ratio reaches 1 when @xmath221 , indicating that the irradiation becomes dominant only when a large fraction of accretion energy is released in the corona .",
    "therefore , we do nt include the irradiation in this work in order to make the numerical calculations simple .",
    "hirose , krolik & stone ( 2006 ) performed the shearing box numerical simulation with radiative transport , focusing on the vertical structure of the standard thin disk around @xmath222 ( @xmath223 ) .",
    "they found that there is actually very little dissipation in the coronal region as the corona is magnetically dominated .",
    "consequently , the corona is too weak to explain the hard x - ray emission observed in agns . the disk corona evaporation / condensation model without additional",
    "heating gives similar results as mhd simulation ( for details see meyer - hofmeister , liu , & meyer 2012 ) .",
    "when a corona is heated only by viscous dissipation within the corona , efficient inverse compton scattering of the disk photons leads to over - cooling of the corona . as a consequence ,",
    "part of the coronal gas condenses into the disk , leaving a very weak corona .    to prevent the corona from collapsing ,",
    "we assume a fraction of accretion energy is transported from the disk and release into corona in this paper , which appears conflict with the mhd simulation results .",
    "we note that in mhd simulation of hirose et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , it was presumed that the disk is dominated by gas pressure , which is reasonable for studying the vertical structure of black hole x - ray binaries in about @xmath222 .",
    "however , we are investigating the inner region of agn disk , where the disk is radiation - pressure dominant .",
    "recently , blaes et al.(2011 ) simulated such kind of accretion flow and found that the thermodynamics of a radiation - pressure dominant disk differs significantly from that envisaged in standard static models of accretion disks . in radiation - dominant plasma ,",
    "the buoyant motions become significant for the overall energetics of the plasma .",
    "the photons outward advection becomes comparable to radiative diffusion , and the associated vertical expansion work balances vertical heat transport and dissipation . at the present stage ,",
    "it is not clear how much discrepancy exists between mhd simulation and our results .",
    "based on the thermal stability analysis presented in yuan ( 2003 ) , luminous hot accretion flow ( lhafs , yuan 2001 ) could also have a two - phase structure .",
    "yuan & zdziarski ( 2004 ) calculated the emitted luminosity from such kind of two - phase accretion flow and found that it can produce x - ray luminosity as high as @xmath224 eddington luminosity .",
    "this is an alternative model for agns with intermediate spectrum and eddington ratio . in our work",
    ", we aim at more general case for hlagns with luminosity up to eddington value , and calculate the broad waveband spectra from both the disk and corona .",
    "we applied the disk evaporation model to the high - luminosity agns . to explain the typical spectra of hlagns ,",
    "we conclude that there should be additional heating to the corona to prevent it from over - cooling by strong inverse compton scattering .",
    "we assume that a fraction of gravitational energy ( @xmath1 ) is liberated in the corona and calculate the corona structure .",
    "then the spectrum from the disk and corona is calculated by monte carlo simulation .",
    "we find that the hard x - ray is dominated by compton cooling and the photon index for hard x - ray in @xmath225 is @xmath226 .",
    "for a given accretion rate , @xmath161 and @xmath227 decrease with increase of @xmath1 . we discuss a possible mechanism for the presumed heating to the corona , that is , the magnetic heating .",
    "with equipartition of magnetic energy to the gas energy in the disk , we derive the fraction of accretion energy stored in magnetic field . assuming this energy is released in the corona",

    "<S> we investigate the accretion process in high - luminosity agns ( hlagns ) in the scenario of the disk evaporation model . </S>",
    "<S> based on this model , the thin disk can extend down to the innermost stable circular orbit ( isco ) at accretion rates higher than @xmath0 ; while the corona is weak since part of the coronal gas is cooled by strong inverse compton scattering of the disk photons . </S>",
    "<S> this implies that the corona can not produce as strong x - ray radiation as observed in hlagns with large eddington ratio . </S>",
    "<S> in addition to the viscous heating , other heating to the corona is necessary to interpret hlagn . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> , we assume that a part of accretion energy released in the disk is transported into the corona , heating up the electrons and thereby radiated away . </S>",
    "<S> we for the first time , compute the corona structure with additional heating , taking fully into account the mass supply to the corona and find that the corona could indeed survive at higher accretion rates and its radiation power increases . </S>",
    "<S> the spectra composed of bremsstrahlung and compton radiation are also calculated . </S>",
    "<S> our calculations show that the compton dominated spectrum becomes harder with the increase of energy fraction ( @xmath1 ) liberating in the corona , and the photon index for hard x - ray(@xmath2 ) is @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss possible heating mechanisms for the corona . combining the energy fraction transported to the corona with the accretion rate by magnetic heating </S>",
    "<S> , we find that the hard x - ray spectrum becomes steeper at larger accretion rate and the bolometric correction factor ( @xmath4 ) increases with increasing accretion rate for @xmath5 , which is roughly consistent with the observational results . </S>"
