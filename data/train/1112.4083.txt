    "nonlinear dynamics of josephson junction arrays ( jjas ) has been a subject of extensive experimental and theoretical research @xcite . the resistively and capacitively shunted junction ( rcsj ) model of these arrays",
    "is described by the discrete sine - gordon ( dsg ) equation which is ubiquitous in nonlinear physics @xcite . among the actively discussed problems for the jja dynamics the problem of the topological soliton ( fluxon ) response to the time - periodic bias , including the fluxon depinning , remains to be important .",
    "properties of the small rf - biased josephson junctions have been extensively studied both experimentally ( starting from the pioneering papers of shapiro @xcite ) and theoretically ( with the focus on the phase - locking @xcite and chaotic regimes @xcite ) . in particular , the rf - biased josephson junctions have been used as a voltage standard @xcite .",
    "it is well - known @xcite that a fluxon in a jja is pinned due to the peierls - nabarro ( pn ) potential , unless a sufficiently strong bias is applied . while the depinning of nonlinear excitations under the dc bias has been studied relatively well ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite ) , the problem of the ac depinning remains scarcely studied .",
    "the problem of ac fluxon depinning can be split into two cases : the symmetric and asymmetric depinning .",
    "the former case normally corresponds to the single harmonic driven systems , particularly being investigated in connection to the domain wall depinning in disordered systems @xcite . in the latter case , a temporarily asymmetric ( but with zero mean value ) ac drive is applied . here",
    "asymmetric drive means that the symmetry of the driving function is lowered , for instance , by applying a biharmonic signal .",
    "more details will be given in the next section .",
    "this phenomenon is based on the so - called _ ratchet _ effect , which is a unidirectional unbiased transport induced by symmetry breaking and nonlinearity @xcite .",
    "the mechanism of the phenomenon is based on the breaking of the symmetries connecting orbits with opposite velocities in the phase space @xcite and on the phase locking of the particle dynamics to the external drive @xcite .",
    "the rectification due to unbiased and temporarily asymmetric drive ( normally biharmonic , consisting of a sinusoidal signal and its overtone ) has been studied theoretically @xcite and experimentally @xcite in rf - biased small josephson junctions .",
    "also , the biharmonic drive has been used for chaos supression ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "the experimental observation of the fluxon ratchet in josephson junctions has been reported in several papers .",
    "thus , fluxon ratchet in long josephson junctions ( ljj ) embedded in the inhomogeneous magnetic field that emulates spatially asymmetric sawtooth ratchet potential have been observed @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite the spatial asymmetry has been achieved by injecting external bias in a way that an effective asymmetric potential is created .",
    "the fluxon ratchet has also been observed in a jja where spatial symmetry was broken by introducing spatial modulation of the coupling energy @xcite .",
    "an interesting application of the fluxon ratchet effect as a fluxon pump has been suggested in ref .",
    "finally , the experimental observation of the fluxon ratchet in an annular ljj due to temporal asymmetry ( biharmonic rf bias ) has been reported @xcite .",
    "it should be emphasized , that the fluxon ratchet due to temporal asymmetry has not yet been investigated experimentally in discrete systems .",
    "the ratchet phenomena have already been studied theoretically for the nonlinear excitations in different discrete media including jjas for both the spatial @xcite and temporal symmetry @xcite breakings . in particular ,",
    "the difference of the ratchet motion in discrete and continuous systems has been highlighted ( e.g. , the devils staircases and the non - zero depinning threshold @xcite ) .",
    "nevertheless , the transition from a pinned to a running state in ac - driven ratchets requires a special investigation . also , it is worthwhile to note that finding mobile fluxons in the limit of small coupling constants ( @xmath0 ) is an interesting challenge on its own",
    ". therefore , addressing the above questions is the main aim of this paper .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ model ] , we present the model . in the next section",
    "it is explained how the mode - locked solutions are computed and how their properties are investigated .",
    "linear stability of the single - harmonically driven jja is briefly discussed in section [ 1harm ] .",
    "asymmetric fluxon depinning under the biharmonic drive is described in section [ 2harm ] .",
    "finally , section [ conc ] contains the main conclusions of the paper .",
    "in this paper , we discuss the dynamics of an array of parallelly shunted and ac - biased small josephson junctions within the rcsj model .",
    "this system is described by the ac - driven and damped discrete sine - gordon ( dsg ) equation , which can be written in a dimensionless form as follows @xmath1 here @xmath2 corresponds to the phase difference of the wave functions at the @xmath3th junction , @xmath4 is the discrete laplacian .",
    "the coupling constant @xmath5 measures the discreteness of the array , where @xmath6 is the magnetic flux quantum , @xmath7 is inductance of an elementary cell , and @xmath8 is the critical current of an individual junction .",
    "the dimensionless dissipation parameter is then @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the resistance of an individual junction , and the time is normalized to the inverse josephson plasma frequency @xmath11 with @xmath12 being the junction capacitance .",
    "finally , @xmath13 , @xmath14 is an external bias , which has a zero mean value [ @xmath15 , applied to each junction of the array . in the following ,",
    "we assume @xmath16 to be of the form @xmath17 notice that the superposition of the two harmonics makes the periodic force to be asymmetric in time for almost all values of @xmath18 , a feature which can be used to break the temporal symmetry of the system ( more details will be given below ) .",
    "only the circular arrays with are to be considered , therefore the periodic boundary conditions apply : @xmath19 , @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is an integer constant that stands for the net number of fluxons trapped in the array .",
    "further on only the case of one fluxon ( @xmath22 ) will be considered .    in jjas",
    "the topological solitary waves have the physical meaning of trapped magnetic flux quanta ( fluxons ) and the average voltage drop reads @xmath23 if the fluxon is moving with a non - zero net velocity then @xmath24 and @xmath25 otherwise .    the experiments with annular jjas have been performed for typical lengths @xmath26 ( see refs .",
    "@xcite ) . in the following ,",
    "we consider the case of an array with @xmath27 junctions subjected to periodic boundary conditions ( annular array ) unless stated otherwise",
    ".    the unidirectional fluxon motion can take place either on regular trajectories ( limit cycles ) or on chaotic trajectories . further on we will refer to the trajectories with @xmath24 as to the _ transporting _ ones , while the trajectories with @xmath25 will called _ non - transporting _ trajectories .",
    "obviously , only the transporting trajectories are of interest within this paper .",
    "the regular transporting trajectories correspond to the limit cycles of eq .",
    "( [ 1 ] ) , which are mode - locked to the frequency of the external bias . on this orbit ,",
    "the average kink velocity is expressed as @xmath28 , where the winding numbers @xmath29 and @xmath30 are integer . in the resonant regime",
    ", the fluxon travels @xmath29 sites during the time @xmath31 , so that , except for a shift in space , its profile is completely reproduced after this time interval ( in the pendulum analogy , this orbit corresponds to @xmath29 full rotations of the pendulum during @xmath30 periods of the external drive ) .",
    "the voltage drop in an annular jja ( with one fluxon in it ) is related to the average fluxon velocity @xmath32 by the equation @xmath33 @xcite .    according to ref .",
    "@xcite , in order to obtain the directed fluxon motion , all symmetries that relate two fluxons with opposite velocities should be broken .",
    "it happens if the following inequality is true : @xmath34 .",
    "the bias ( [ 2 ] ) satisfies it , but in the strictly hamiltonian case ( @xmath35 ) an additional condition is necessary : @xmath36 .",
    "in order to understand better the depinning transition , we focus first on the regular mode - locked solutions ( limit cycles ) of the driven dsg equation . the fluxon periodic orbit is computed by finding zeroes of the map @xmath37 where the vector @xmath38 consists of the dynamical variables @xmath39 .",
    "the operator @xmath40 stands for the integration of the equations of motion ( [ 1 ] ) during the time @xmath41 and afterwards the shift of the final solution by @xmath29 sites forward if @xmath42 or backward if @xmath43 .",
    "the case @xmath44 corresponds to the fluxon pinned to a lattice site .",
    "a fixed point of the map ( [ map ] ) is a mode - locked solution @xmath45 which reproduces itself after the time @xmath46 with the space shift by @xmath29 lattice sites backward or forward .",
    "next , we substitute the expansion @xmath47 into eq .",
    "( [ 1 ] ) . for the case of _ standing _ fluxon ( @xmath44 ) after keeping only the linear terms , we obtain the following set of linear odes with periodic coefficients : @xmath48\\varepsilon_n~,~~ n=1,2,\\ldots , n.\\ ] ] the map @xmath49=   { \\hat m}(t ) \\left [ \\begin{array}{c } \\vec{\\varepsilon}(0 ) \\\\ { \\dot { \\vec \\varepsilon}}(0)\\end{array } \\right ] \\ ] ] is constructed from the solutions of the system ( [ a3 ] )",
    ". it relates the small perturbations @xmath50 at the time moments @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "the @xmath53 floquet ( monodromy ) matrix @xmath54 contains all the necessary information about the linear stability of the system .",
    "if this matrix has at least one eigenvalue with @xmath55 ( @xmath56 ) , then the system is unstable .",
    "if for all eigenvalues @xmath57 , the system is stable .",
    "it is well - known @xcite that these eigenvalues come in quadruples , so that if @xmath58 is an eigenvalue , then @xmath59 , @xmath60 and @xmath61 ( here @xmath62 , see , for example , refs .",
    "@xcite ) are also eigenvalues .",
    "thus , the floquet multipliers lie either on the circle of the radius @xmath10 ( will be referred to as a _",
    "@xmath10-circle _ throughout the paper ) or may depart from it after collisions . the notable difference of the ac - driven case from the dc - driven ( autonomous ) case is the absence of the degeneration with respect to time shifts , which manifests itself in the absence of the eigenvalue @xmath63 @xcite .    with the help of the newton - raphson iterative method it is possible to compute numerically the respective mode - locked limit cycle for the given period @xmath46 with a desired computer precision .",
    "for details one might consult ref .",
    "the advantage of this approach is that not only attractors , but also repellers , can be computed .",
    "also , wrong conclusions which can be made due to sensitivity to initial conditions can be avoided .    in this paper",
    ", we plan to compute the mode - locked limit cycle that corresponds to the standing fluxon and to path - follow it while a control parameter is changed until the cycle becomes unstable or completely disappears . by monitoring the moduli of the floquet",
    "eigenvalues @xmath64 one can obtain the information about the underlying bifurcations and , consequently , about the depinning transition .",
    "before investigating the problem of the directed fluxon motion under the influence of a biharmonic signal ( [ 2 ] ) we briefly consider the case of a single harmonic drive when @xmath65 .",
    "it is of interest to investigate the stability of a mode - locked state that corresponds to a standing fluxon .",
    "the existence of the non - zero peierls - nabarro ( pn ) potential causes fluxon pinning to the lattice @xcite . intuitively , it is not hard to understand that on the parameter plane @xmath66 one can draw a curve that separates the area where only the stable mode - locked standing fluxons exist ( the pinning area ) from the are where mobile fluxons , both chaotic and regular , coexist together with the standing fluxons ( the transporting area ) .",
    "this curve should exist as a dependence @xmath67 where for a given @xmath68 only pinned mode - locked states exist if @xmath69 .",
    "if @xmath70 , the dynamics appears to be more complex including diffusively moving fluxons , mode - locked moving fluxons or chaotic dynamics of the whole array when individual fluxons can not be identified .",
    "the latter case corresponds to the _ non - existing _ area and will not be discussed in this paper . in the limit @xmath71 ,",
    "the effects of discreteness disappear , thus @xmath72 should decrease . on the other hand ,",
    "the decrease of @xmath68 means that the pn barrier becomes stronger and thus a larger amplitude is necessary to overcome it . as a result , @xmath72 increases when @xmath73 .",
    "the exit from the pinning area [ below the curve @xmath74 can lead to different scenarios depending on the direction of the exit .",
    "the issue of discrete kink unlocking ( depinning ) in the dsg lattice has been studied in ref .",
    "@xcite , but for the parameter ranges which are different from ours .",
    "we are dealing with large bias amplitudes and small couplings .",
    "especially it is useful to focus on the floquet analysis of pinned fluxon states in the limit of small ( @xmath0 ) couplings .",
    "also , this section will make more clear the presentation of the original results in the next sections .    the behavior of the floquet eigenvalues ( computed as described in sec .",
    "[ floquet ] ) is shown in detail in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] . in panels ( a)-(b ) , their evolution as a function of the coupling constant @xmath68 is given starting from the anticontinuum ( @xmath75 ) limit .",
    "note that the eigenvalues are placed on the complex plane symmetrically with respect to the real axis , thus we limit ourselves with the eigenvalues lying in the upper half - plane ( @xmath76 ) .",
    "the bias amplitude now is @xmath77 , so that the excitations on the fluxon background can be treated as small . in the anticontinuum limit ,",
    "all the eigenvalues sit in one point and with the growth of @xmath68 they separate forming two distinct groups : the modes associated with the linear spectrum ( josephson plasmons ) and the internal mode(s ) .",
    "the plasmon band extends linearly with @xmath68 according to the dispersion law @xmath78 due to finiteness of the array , the wavenumber @xmath79 attains only discrete set of values @xmath80 , @xmath81 .",
    "the localized eigenmode detaches itself from the linear band : as it is well known in the discrete klein - gordon theory @xcite , the internal mode is soft , so that it detaches from the linear band into the gap . in panels ( c)-(l ) of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , the shapes of the eigenvectors @xmath82 ( both real and imaginary parts ) are shown for the parameter values @xmath77 and @xmath83 .",
    "these eigenvectors are ordered from top to bottom according to the decrease of @xmath84 . from the shape of the eigenvectors",
    "one can conclude that all of them , except one , are delocalized and therefore they are associated with the linear spectrum .",
    "the eigenmode in fig .",
    "[ fig1](f ) has a clear localized structure . in our case",
    ", the fluxon state is locked to the external drive with the frequency @xmath85 which lies in the gap of the spectrum ( [ wl ] ) . only the overtones",
    "@xmath86 can lie in the linear spectrum : @xmath87 , therefore the excited linear modes satisfy the condition @xmath88 , @xmath89 .",
    "the increase of @xmath68 widens the linear spectrum and , as a result , the respective eigenvalues spread around the @xmath10-circle .",
    "the collisions of the eigenvalues at @xmath90 with the highest ( @xmath91 ) linear mode are marked by the vertical red lines at @xmath92/4 $ ] and @xmath93/4 $ ] .",
    "they correspond to the parametric resonances of this mode with the external drive : @xmath94 and @xmath95 .",
    "collisions at @xmath96 marked by the blue lines at @xmath97/4 $ ] and @xmath98/4 $ ] and correspond to the main resonances @xmath99 and @xmath99 .",
    "the internal mode evolution with varying @xmath68 can be clearly seen due to its nonlinear behavior as a function of @xmath68 , as compared to the linear evolution of plasmon modes .",
    "after interactions with the linear spectrum ( marked by the avoided crossings ) , the internal mode hits the real axis at @xmath96 , thus signaling the resonance with some overtone of the driving frequency .",
    "after that the eigenvalue increases extremely fast [ note the almost vertical growth of @xmath64 in fig .",
    "[ fig1](b ) ] , leaves the @xmath10-circle and finally exits the unit circle .",
    "we conclude that the disappearance of the standing mode - locked fluxon takes place via the tangential ( saddle - node ) bifurcation .",
    "the excitation of the fluxon along the destabilizing direction in the phase space leads to _ chaotic _ fluxon diffusion with the net zero velocity .    while the previous investigation took place at rather small amplitudes for which the excitation on the fluxon background can be considered as small ,",
    "now we focus on the evolution of the floquet eigenvalues as a function of the driving amplitude for the fixed value of coupling @xmath83 . as one",
    "can see in fig .",
    "[ fig1](m - n ) , the eigenvalue that corresponds to the localized mode moves on the @xmath10-circle in the direction opposite to the motion of the linear band . after following the respective eigenvalue as a function of @xmath100",
    ", we see that it collides with its complex conjugated counterpart at @xmath90 ( see the resulting `` bubble '' in the @xmath101 dependence ) , continues its motion along the @xmath10-circle , then interacts with the eigenmodes of the linear spectrum and finally collides with its complex conjugate counterpart on the real axis but at @xmath96 .",
    "next , the modulus of this eigenvalue grows fast and finally exceeds the unit circle .",
    "again , the standing mode - locked fluxon state disappears via the tangential bifurcation .",
    "the unstable eigenvector is again spatially localized ( see the inset in fig .",
    "[ fig1]n ) .",
    "the perturbation of the kink in the unstable direction leads to the growth of a localized oscillation on the kink background that results in the kink - antikink pair birth and eventual destruction of the one - soliton state .",
    "other scenarios are also possible .",
    "similar investigation for the case @xmath102 shows that the system can undergo additional bifurcations and a new standing mode locked fluxon can appear with a slightly different shape .",
    "however , the final disappearance of the standing kink goes similarly to the above scenario via the tangential bifurcation . in this case",
    ", the time evolution of the unstable fluxon turns into chaotic diffusive jumps of the kink backward and forward with the net zero velocity .",
    "the main conclusion of this subsection is that standing mode - locked fluxon states disappear via a tangential bifurcation , when the driving amplitude @xmath100 or the coupling constant exceeds some critical value .",
    "the resulting dynamics can either lead to fluxon chaotic diffusion or to chaotic motion of the whole lattice and consequent fluxon destruction .",
    "our analysis with @xmath103 and @xmath104 has shown that the size effects are insignificant : the critical values at which the tangential bifurcation takes place differ very slightly .",
    "the instability evolves via the excitation of a localized internal mode .",
    "this is in accordance with the previous results @xcite on the internal mode role in the kink mobility .",
    "more details on the kink response to the single harmonic ac drive ( including the kink dynamics ) can be found in ref .",
    "in particular , it has been shown that in the unlocking limit the kink dynamics shows the type - i intermittency .",
    "now we focus on the main task of this paper , namely on the studies of the fluxon motion when the bias ( [ 2 ] ) is biharmonic ( @xmath105 ) . here and further on , we take @xmath106 unless stated otherwise .",
    "according to the previous studies @xcite , the fluxon motion becomes unidirectional due to the symmetry breaking and its average velocity depends solely on the system parameters . also , from those papers we already know that critical parameter values should exist above which the applied external bias overcomes the forces of pinning and the fluxon starts to propagate .",
    "in particular , such critical values exist for the amplitudes of the external drive @xmath107 and the phase shift @xmath18 .    including the second harmonic in the bias ( [ 2 ] ) , we add the third parameter ( the phase shift @xmath18 ) into consideration and consequently we must think about the existence diagram in the three - dimensional parameter space @xmath108 .",
    "however , since the average voltage drop satisfies @xmath109 , it is possible to construct the existence diagram on the plane @xmath110 .",
    "this diagram for the existence of moving fluxon states is shown in fig .",
    "the numerical experiment has been performed as follows : the pinned state with the fluxon oscillating around its center of mass has been continued with small increase of @xmath100 or @xmath68 until this state loses stability and starts to propagate .",
    "transporting trajectories are mostly chaotic , but regular mode - locked trajectories may also exist . these trajectories will be analyzed in detail in the next subsections .",
    "as one can see , similarly to the case of the single harmonic drive , there exists a curve @xmath111 ( shown by markers ) that separates the pinned and transporting parts of the diagram . in the area down and to the left from the curve @xmath112 , there are only mode - locked standing fluxons and no mobile fluxons exist ( @xmath113 ) for any @xmath114 .",
    "the area to the right side of the curve corresponds to the situation where moving fluxons     at @xmath115 for @xmath116 ( @xmath117 ) , @xmath85 ( @xmath118 ) and @xmath119 ( @xmath120 ) .",
    "solid lines are used as a guide for an eye ( see text for details ) .",
    "the upper and lower insets show the time evolution of the central junction for @xmath121 , @xmath85 , @xmath115 and @xmath122 , @xmath123 ( lower inset ) and @xmath124 , @xmath125 ( upper inset ) .",
    "different colors correspond to different initial times : @xmath126 ( black ) and @xmath127 ( blue ) . ]    ( @xmath128 ) exist for some values of @xmath18 .",
    "obviously , in the continuum limit @xmath71 , the critical depinning amplitude tends to zero , while in the anticontinuum limit @xmath73 , it is necessary to increase the driving amplitude in order to unlock the fluxon .",
    "at some point the critical drive is too strong and the fluxon is destructed due to the fluxon - antifluxon pair creation and the chaotic dynamics of the whole lattice .",
    "an example of such a pinned mode - locked trajectory is shown in the lower inset of fig .",
    "note that the pinning to the lattice is independent on the initial conditions .",
    "for example , in this figure two trajectories with the initial times @xmath126 and @xmath129 are shown . also , the scenario is the same for other values of initial time @xmath130 , the initial fluxon position , and different initial kicks .",
    "the examples of transporting chaotic trajectories with different initial times ( @xmath126 and @xmath129 ) are illustrated by the upper inset of fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] . independently of the initial conditions at @xmath131 , the system settles on the chaotic attractor that corresponds to the directed fluxon motion with the same average velocity ( in this case @xmath132 ) .",
    "note that the principal characteristics of the @xmath133 dependence remain qualitatively the same for different values of @xmath134 .",
    "it has been shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that the ratchet fluxon motion is well pronounced in the frequency range @xmath135",
    ". the peierls - nabarro frequency ( which equals the frequency of the internal mode @xcite ) at @xmath83 ( according to the relation @xmath136 , @xmath137 , see ref .",
    "@xcite ) equals @xmath138 .",
    "thus , for small couplings the working frequency range lies below all characteristic system frequencies . among the other system parameters the coupling constant and dissipation depend on the physical characteristics of the specific array and",
    "therefore they can not be changed easily in the experiment .",
    "consequently , we are left with the bias parameters @xmath100 and @xmath18 which can be tuned at will .",
    "therefore it would be of interest to study the depinning process as a function of @xmath18 ( with other parameters fixed ) and the same for @xmath100 .",
    "the following subsections will be devoted to this task .",
    "for continuous ratchets it was shown previously @xcite that the average kink velocity is proportional to @xmath139 , so that , provided the respective symmetries are broken , the directed motion can occur for arbitrary small values of the driving amplitudes . for the dsg equation , the dependence of the average kink velocity on the driver amplitudes is not a smooth monotonic function of @xmath107 , but a complex function that either entirely or partially consists of plateaux of different lengths that correspond to mode - locked fluxon states . at @xmath140",
    "this dependence resembles closely a `` devil s staircase '' , while this resemblance disappears when @xmath68 is decreased leaving only isolated islands of regular motion @xcite .    in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , the dependence of the floquet eigenvalues on the driving amplitude is shown for different values of @xmath68 .        comparing figs .",
    "[ fig1](m - n ) and [ fig3](a - b ) , we observe the close similarity in the floquet eigenvalue behavior in the single harmonic and biharmonic biased cases .",
    "it appears also that independently on the coupling strength , the loss of stability of the limit cycle appears through a collision of two eigenvalues at @xmath96 and the departure of one of the eigenvalues out of the unit circle [ see the inset in fig .",
    "[ fig3](b ) ] that signals a tangential bifurcation taking place at some critical value of the driving amplitude . this critical value decreases with the growth of @xmath68 .",
    "note that the critical value of the bias amplitude is approximately two times smaller than in the single harmonic case because now the bias consists of two harmonics with the amplitude @xmath100 . in panels ( a - b )",
    ", it should be noted that before the tangential bifurcation several period - doubling bifurcations take place that can easily be identified by the bubble - like deviations on the dependence @xmath141 from the value @xmath142 .",
    "the amplitude of these deviations does not exceed the value @xmath143 and they decrease with @xmath68 , so that the limit cycle remains stable . at higher @xmath102 , the largest bubble corresponds to a pair of eigenvalues colliding away from the real axis ( that corresponds to the hopf bifurcation ) . for even higher @xmath144 ,",
    "again a bubble associated with the period - doubling bifurcation can be seen .",
    "although for the given range of parameters these bifurcations do not cause instability of the limit cycle , the increase of @xmath134 or decrease of @xmath145 may change the nature of the depinning transition .",
    "the computations have been performed for different values of @xmath18 and the dependencies @xmath146 appear to be rather similar since the curves of different colors almost coincide .",
    "the only difference lies in the different critical values of @xmath100 , when the tangential bifurcation takes place , however these differences are rather small .",
    "the unstable eigenvector , shown in the inset of panel ( d ) has a pronounced localized asymmetric shape .",
    "the eigenvectors that correspond to the opposite ( with respect to the shift @xmath147 ) values @xmath148 and @xmath149 are related to each other approximately by the inversion @xmath150 , where @xmath12 is an arbitrary constant that appears because eqs .",
    "( [ a3 ] ) are linear .",
    "this means that the unstable perturbation drives the fluxon in the opposite directions for @xmath18 and @xmath151 , respectively .",
    "the behavior of the eigenvalues in the parameter space @xmath108 has very complicated structure .",
    "in particular , it is possible that for some values of @xmath18 , the standing fluxon states can exist after the tangential bifurcation shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] . for the sake of brevity",
    ", we are going to refer to it as to the _ first _ tangential bifurcation .",
    "indeed , such an example is given by fig .",
    "after the firts tangential bifurcation , the standing solution ( limit cycle ) becomes unstable at @xmath152 and soon disappears but reappears back after another tangential bifurcation . in the short interval between these bifurcations , a chaotic moving fluxon appears",
    "the further increase of the driving amplitude leads to the hopf bifurcation ( collision of two eigenvalues on the complex plane ) and to the eventual departure of two eigenvalues out of the unit circle .",
    "this instability leads to formation of a large localized excitation on the fluxon and the eventual creation of fluxon - antifluxon pairs .",
    "thus , it is possible to pass from the pinned area to the non - existing area ( where no fluxons exist due to chaos ) omitting the transporting area ( where the moving fluxons exist ) .    , @xmath115 , @xmath122 , @xmath148 .",
    "panels ( c ) and ( d ) give details in interval @xmath153 @xmath154 . ]",
    "this bifurcation analysis explains the non - monotonous behavior of the average velocity dependence on the bias amplitude for small @xmath68 ( see fig .",

    "@xcite ) , when the intervals of zero and non - zero fluxons velocities interchange with the growth of @xmath100 .",
    "the directed fluxon transport in the continuous sine - gordon model shows @xcite that the dependence of the average fluxon velocity ( and , consequently , the voltage drop ) behaves as @xmath155 $ ] . as it has been shown in ref .",

    "the type - i intermittency in the depinning transition for the single - harmonically driven kinks has been observed in ref .",

    "a typical period - doubling route to chaos takes place and the standing fluxon becomes quasiperiodic and later chaotic . with decrease of @xmath18 ,",

    "these dynamical pictures bear a significant difference , although they look similar . in the first case ,",
    "the standing fluxons are always regular and the transporting trajectory is chaotic with long regular intervals where dynamics is very close to the periodic one with the period @xmath239 . in the depinning scenario , driven by the period - doubling bifurcations",

    "[ fig8](b ) .",
    "as @xmath18 decreases into the chaotic region , the peaks that correspond to the @xmath244 contribution get smeared out and only the @xmath245 peaks survive [ see panel ( c ) ] . after the further decrease of @xmath18 the subharmonic peaks become even less pronounced .",
    "in this paper , we have studied the fluxon dynamics in a highly discrete annular josephson junction array driven by the asymmetric periodic bias current with the zero mean value .",
    "it is already well - known that this bias ( consisting of a cosine harmonic and its second overtone ) leads to a _ directed _ fluxon motion which is manifested by the non - zero voltage drop .",
    "it is interesting to note that for the strongly discrete jja the ratchet transport is mainly chaotic , while the non - transporting states are regular .",
    "thus , the chaotic dynamics can be identified experimentally directly from the iv curves .",
    "we mainly focus on the depinning process of the fluxon in the limit of the weak coupling between the neighboring junctions ( @xmath0 ) .",

    "in fact , this diagram can be treated as the projection of a more complicated three - dimensional parameter space @xmath108 on the plane @xmath66 .",
    "we have investigated the depinning of the initially standing mode - locked fluxon state not far from the critical line @xmath203 by analyzing its floquet spectrum .",
    "the depinning occurs through chaotization of the mode - locked state .",
    "the mechanisms of chaotization are diverse and depend on the initial position of the non - transporting limit cycle in the parameter space @xmath108 .",
    "the most common depinning scenario occurs through the type - i intermittency which evolves after the tangential bifurcation destroys a standing fluxon limit cycle .",
    "this scenario is ubiquitous when approaching the @xmath203 curve from below by increasing the bias amplitude @xmath100 .",
    "another scenario develops through a sequence of period - doubling bifurcations .",
    "it happens slightly above the @xmath203 curve when @xmath18 is varied .    finally , we would like to point out some further research directions .",
    "the main difficulty in studying the kink dynamics in strongly discrete systems is the lack of an adequate analytical approximation . as a result",
    ", we are forced to work with numerical methods .",
    "the existing approximate theories are based on the perturbations of the continuum models where kinks are treated as point particles ( maybe with the internal mode taken into account ) in the pn potential .",
    "this approach works relatively well if @xmath140 but breaks if @xmath0 . an important tool that could help to obtain the @xmath203 curve analytically is the melnikov criterion .",
    "however , the effectively use of it requires the explicit expressions for the stable and unstable manifolds in order to build the melnikov function .",
    "for example , successful implementation of the melnikov method used in ref .",
    "@xcite utilizes the collective coordinate approximation which is not applicable in our case .",
    "performing the same for the case of small @xmath68 in our opinion is an important challenge .    in summary",
