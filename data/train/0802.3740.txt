    "recent experimental and theoretical investigations in the close - to - neutron - drip line region above the doubly magic @xmath1 nucleus have revealed many intriguing issues concerning some newer aspects of nuclear structure and empirical / realistic n - n interaction in such exotic environments .",
    "decrease in the spin - orbit interaction at n - z=32 above the z=50 , n=82 double shell closure @xcite , anomalously low excitation energy ( 282 kev ) of the first 5/2@xmath6 state in the @xmath7 compared to its position in @xmath8 ( 962 kev ) @xcite , anomalously low b(@xmath9 ) value in @xmath10 @xcite , the question of appearance of deformation and the locus of transition from single particle to collective behaviour , as well as the evolution of collectivity in these neutron - rich nuclei above @xmath1 core and the role therein of the number of valence neutrons and protons , are some of the structure issues being studied recently .",
    "the question of reduced neutron - neutron pairing in the exotic n - rich environment @xcite above n=82 @xcite , and modification of the empirical / effective two - body matrix elements ( tbmes ) in the valence space ( @xmath11 , @xmath12 ) above the @xmath1 core for shell model applications , are also of current interest .",
    "moreover nuclei with 50@xmath13z@xmath1356 and 82@xmath13n@xmath1388 lie on or close to the path of the astrophysical r - process flow .",
    "thus the knowledge of the structure , particularly the binding energies , low - lying excited states and @xmath14-decay rates of these nuclei at finite temperatures , are important ingredients for investigation in the nucleosynthesis scenario . however , many of these important nuclei are yet to be studied experimentally . for example",
    ", the even - n neutron - rich sn isotopes are the classical `` waiting point '' nuclei in the a=130 solar system abundance peak under typical r - process conditions . with respect to the r - process",
    ", @xmath15 is an important waiting -point nucleus for moderate neutron densities to drive the r - process flow beyond a@xmath16130 peak @xcite .",
    "some spectroscopic information , such as binding energy and low -lying spectrum exist only for the @xmath17 .",
    "recently , the @xmath14-decay half lives via delayed neutron emission have been measured for @xmath18 to @xmath2 nuclei @xcite .",
    "their production rates and lifetimes are small .",
    "this provides severe limitations in acquiring spectroscopic information on them .",
    "therefore , reliable theoretical calculations and their comparisons with the hitherto available experimental data on the binding energies , level spectra , electromagnetic properties and @xmath14 -decay rates are not only important for extending our knowledge of n - n interaction and nuclear structure in the exotic n - rich environment , but they also provide very useful ingredients for reviewing the problems related to the nuclear astrophysics in general .    theoretical studies in the framework of nuclear shell model ( sm ) have been done @xcite recently for these nuclei above the @xmath1 core in the valence space consisting of @xmath19 and @xmath20 orbitals . these sm calculations using realistic @xcite and empirical @xcite interactions in this valence space yield remarkably good results for some of the isotopes of sn , sb , te , i , xe , cs . the empirical smpn @xcite interaction , applied for all the nuclei in the range 134 @xmath13 a @xmath13 138 and @xmath21z@xmath22 are found to be highly successful @xcite in predicting particularly the ground state spin - parities , binding energies , level spectra and electromagnetic transition probabilities . in a recent work",
    "@xcite we have identified that a mild collectivity appears in the @xmath23 @xcite nuclei with n = 84 and 85 , respectively .",
    "the spectra of @xmath4 @xcite , @xmath5 @xcite and @xmath24 @xcite also showed good vibrational characteristics . because of the computational limitations we then studied the evolution of collectivity in the odd - a nuclei for n=84 - 87 with particle - rotor model @xcite and indicated the role played by the valence protons and neutrons in them .",
    "the role of the valence protons and neutrons have been also studied in the context of the structure of @xmath25 and @xmath26 @xcite .",
    "it has been found that the single particle behaviour persists for nuclei with neutrons only in the valence space up to at least n=87 .",
    "the calculated results for the spectroscopic information on @xmath27sn , sb isotopes have been reported already in ref.@xcite .",
    "the present work is motivated to discuss the results of untruncated shell model calculations over the @xmath28 valence space on the spectroscopic properties of the a=138 even - even isobars and to study the evolution of collectivity in these nuclei using the code oxbash @xcite .",
    "it is expected to reveal the role of valence nucleon species on the evolution of collectivity .",
    "the other motivation is to compare the results of sm calculations with smpn interaction @xcite with those with the cd - bonn potential based realistic cwg @xcite interaction used in this region .",
    "the theoretical results have also been compared with the experimental data , wherever available .",
    "we have then compared the two sets of two -body interaction matrix elements to gain insight in to the n - n interaction for this n - rich environment .",
    "the calculations were carried out in the z50n82 model space with the smpn @xcite and cwg hamiltonians @xcite using the code oxbash @xcite .",
    "we started @xcite our shell model calculations for the @xmath2 nucleus in a slightly truncated space excluding the intruder @xmath29 neutron orbital .",
    "this was done on the observation of very small ( 2 - 5% ) contributions of particle - partitions involving this orbital in the @xmath30 wavefunctions .",
    "no signature of any collective feature of the states was found with the increasing neutron number in the n=84 - 88 isotopes of sn .",
    "shell model results with the smpn ( 1 + 2 ) body hamiltonian were encouraging for these n - rich sn isotopes .",
    "it was noted that an estimate @xcite of the energy of the first @xmath31 excited state in @xmath15 was at 600 kev .",
    "the calculated result for this was at 578 kev .",
    "similarly , the systematically estimated @xcite energy value of the 11/2@xmath6 level in @xmath32 was @xmath33 600 kev and the calculated value was 550 kev .",
    "the estimated @xcite energy of the second 5/2@xmath6 level in @xmath34 was also closer to the calculated result at 773 kev .    with the availability of the window version of the oxbash @xcite and nushell@msu @xcite codes , it became possible for us to perform untruncated shell model calculations including the @xmath35 orbital , for all the a=138 isobars with six valence particles in the large basis space of 76 single particle states mentioned above .",
    "the effect of the inclusion of this intruder orbital in the model space has been presented in table i. it shows the importance of the full basis calculation .",
    "substantial changes in the ground state binding energy and excitation energies of the yrast levels in the spectrum of @xmath2 can be noted .",
    "although the average percentage changes in the absolute binding energies of the states are @xmath36 , the resultant effect on the excitation energy spectrum is dramatic .",
    "wave function compositions of the states for both the calculations are also given in the table .",
    "comparison of the wave functions of the same state of the two calculations shows that they do not differ much .",
    "this is reflected in the b(@xmath37 ) values of the two calculations , they differ , but not drastically . the results in table i are from the sm calculations with the smpn interaction .      in figs .",
    "1 - 4 experimental energy values of different states ( yrast 2@xmath6 , 4@xmath6 , 6@xmath6 ) for the even - even isotonic series of n=70 - 80 , 84 - 88 and isotopic series of z= 50 - 60 are plotted . as for @xmath15 and @xmath2 , experimental level energy values",
    "are not available , we have plotted the predicted values from our calculations using smpn ( fig.1 ) and cwg ( fig.2 ) . calculated energies for the first @xmath31 levels ( e(@xmath38 ) ) in @xmath39 , using smpn fit nicely in the systematics for n@xmath4082 ( fig.1 ) .",
    "the e(@xmath38 ) values calculated for sn isotopes above n=82 decreases with increasing neutron number .",
    "but the predicted e(@xmath38 ) values from the calculations using the cwg hamiltonian , deviate sharply from the systematics for n@xmath41 ( fig.2 ) .",
    "however these values agree with the feature observed for even - even ( e - e ) sn isotopes below the @xmath1 core .",
    "for cwg , the e(@xmath38 ) excitation energies for all the even - even sn isotopes with n@xmath42 84 are almost constant similar to those below n=82 .",
    "only difference is that the bunching of e(@xmath38 ) values now occur at around 750 kev for n@xmath4284 instead of 1200 kev for n@xmath1382 .",
    "it thus seems that the cwg tbmes still carry the characteristic features of the not - so - neutron - rich domain below n=82 .",
    "but the smpn incorporates features of the exotic n - rich domain above the @xmath1 core in some of its important tbmes appropriate for describing low - lying states for nuclei in this region , and its prediction for low energy eigenvalues seems to be more reliable , as is evidenced by the trend in the systematics .",
    "similar observation is made from the figs .",
    "3a , b showing the variation of the ( @xmath43 and e(@xmath44 ) ) of the isotopic series of z=50 to 60 with neutron numbers ranging from 70 to 88 .",
    "3a,3b show the results for sn with n=86 and 88 from smpn and cwg calculations , respectively .",
    "the experimental energies of sn isotopes stand out from the rest of the nuclei for n@xmath4582 with nearly constant values of e@xmath46 and e(@xmath44 ) from n=70 to 80 with a very slow increasing trend with decreasing neutron number .",
    "in contrast , for other isotopic series e@xmath47 and e@xmath48 energies increase slowly with increasing neutron number and become largest at n=82 and then decrease again for n@xmath4082 . but for n@xmath41 , the variation as predicted with both smpn and cwg changes dramatically .",
    "the smpn results totally match with the local systematics .",
    "the cwg still retains the near constancy but with much reduced values , with a slight increasing trend with increasing neutron number .",
    "it seems that for n@xmath4582 , the sn isotopes were different from the rest due to their strong z=50 proton shell closed structure . but",
    "above @xmath49 , the z=50 closure becomes weak and the special feature disappears .",
    "this feature is corroborated by both theoretical results .",
    "however cwg results for sn show that the variations of experimental e@xmath47 and e@xmath48 with neutron number have opposite slopes for n@xmath4082 compared to smpn behaviour .",
    "fig 4 shows the variation of e@xmath46 , e(@xmath44 ) and e(@xmath50 ) for n=84 , 86 and 88 for z=50 - 60 .",
    "the results from smpn and cwg ( for n=86,88 ) are shown in the figure .",
    "how the results match with the systematics of the isotones and also with the trend of n=84 are evident .",
    "the smpn results fit smoothly in the trend and also follow more closely the trend set by @xmath17 . for the cwg results",
    ", z=50 proton shell closure seems to prevail in a comparatively stronger way .",
    "we now address the issue of the evolution of collectivity in the even - even @xmath51 isotopes using smpn @xcite and cwg interactions from b.a .",
    "et al._@xcite . in table",
    "ii , energies , wavefunctions and b(e2 , @xmath52 ) have been compared for the yrast 0@xmath6 and 2@xmath6 states of the three sn isotopes .",
    "as pointed out , the e(2@xmath53 ) value decreases with increasing neutron number for smpn , but remains almost constant for the cwg hamiltonian .",
    "structure of these states including the b(e2,0@xmath54 ) values , as shown in table ii , as well as the r@xmath55 values suggest that in the calculations using cwg , the @xmath39 isotopes show a trend of gradual onset of collectivity .",
    "this is demonstrated by the mild increase in configuration mixing in the wavefunctions compared to the smpn case and an increasing trend in the b(e2 , @xmath52 ) values .",
    "the r@xmath56 value is also close to 2 ( r@xmath56=1.78 ) for @xmath2 with cwg .",
    "but with smpn , results are different , ( @xmath57 multiplet configuration is dominant for the two states in all these isotopes .",
    "the value of r@xmath56 is 1.70 for @xmath2 with smpn .",
    "although the e@xmath58 ) values are relatively smaller than those predicted by cwg , the structure of the wavefunctions and the b(e2 , @xmath59 ) values show the characteristics of single particle behaviour .",
    "this is a feature already observed experimentally in the n - rich @xmath10 isotope @xcite .",
    "the anomalously low b(e2 , @xmath60 ) value found in this nucleus compared to that expected from the phenomenological modified grodzin formula ( b(e2 , @xmath60 ) @xmath61 ) has drawn the attention of the community @xcite .",
    "_ @xcite have traced this anomalous behaviour in the te isotopes to a reduced neutron pairing above the n=82 shell gap .",
    "this is consistent with the reduced diagonal n - n tbmes of the smpn interaction @xcite discussed in section iii of this paper .",
    "it seems to be a unique feature observed in neutron - rich nuclei . in this domain",
    "compratively lower value of e(@xmath38 ) does not necessarily lead to a larger b(e2 ) value indicating collectivity .",
    "@xmath10 probably was the first nucleus for which this feature was identified @xcite . interestingly",
    ", similar behaviour is also seen near the n=20 shell closure for neutron - rich mg and ne isotopes and also in the odd - a @xmath62 isotopes @xcite .    despite being a singly closed shell nucleus , in @xmath63 ,",
    "the e@xmath46 is 885 kev , much lower than that in the well deformed @xmath64 ( e@xmath46=1369 kev ) .",
    "but the b(e2 , @xmath65 ) in @xmath66 is only @xmath16 13 w.u compared to @xmath16 21 w.u . for @xmath64 @xcite .",
    "it has been pointed out in one of the recent work @xcite that there are indications that the appearance of collectivity in the yrast levels occurs for nuclei with more than one neutron and proton in the valence space above the @xmath1 core .",
    "but it is still not very clear how the onset and evolution of collectivity in these n - rich nuclei exactly depend on the number of valence neutrons and protons .",
    "so a microscopic investigation using shell model is indeed necessary and useful .",
    "we have studied the locus of evolution @xcite of collectivity as a function of neutron and proton numbers .",
    "our observation regarding this issue of evolution of collectivity in the low - lying yrast states in all the nuclei in range ( z=50 - 56 , n=82 - 88 ) above the @xmath1 core has been reported in ref .",
    "it is found that for nuclei with more than one neutron and one proton in the valence space , mild deformation appears at n=84 , 85 , i.e. even before n=87 , and deformation / collectivity grows with increasing n and z.    shell model results for the @xmath67 nuclei have already been discussed elsewhere @xcite .",
    "these odd - odd isobars have excitation spectra , which are characteristic of spherical nuclei .    here",
    "the results for only the even - even a=138 isobaric series above the @xmath1 core have been presented .",
    "the nuclei considered are @xmath2 ( @xmath68=+3.0 ) with 6 neutrons , @xmath4 ( @xmath68=+1.0 ) with 4 neutrons and 2 protons , @xmath5 ( @xmath68=-1.0 ) with 2 neutrons and 4 protons and finally , @xmath69 ( @xmath68=-3.0 ) with 6 valence protons .",
    "untruncated shell model calculations for 6 valence nucleons in this large basis space usually involve matrices of large dimensions , especially for nuclei having both neutrons and protons with comparable numbers or for those having relatively more neutrons ( because of the @xmath70 orbital ) .",
    "the dimensions of the matrices involved for different yrast ( j@xmath71,t ) - states of a particular a=138 isobar are shown in table iii .",
    "calculations for @xmath4 with 2 protons and 4 neutrons involve matrices of largest dimensions for a particular spin state .      for all these a=138 nuclei , except @xmath2 ,",
    "excitation spectra are known .",
    "calculated energy eigenvalues of the level spectra using both smpn and cwg hamiltonians are compared with the experimental data in figs.(5 - 8 ) . calculated energy values of the levels with the smpn hamiltonian are in excellent agreement with experimental ones up to the highest observed level in @xmath4 ( fig.6 ) and @xmath5 ( fig.7 ) ( including the non - yrast levels in @xmath5 , not shown in the figure )",
    "the agreement for cwg results is also very good in both the cases but all the energy eigenvalues of the excited states are systematically underpredicted by about 100 - 150 kev .",
    "the calculations remove the ambiguity of the spin - parity assignment of the second 8@xmath6 state in @xmath4 . from the observed as well as the calculated spectra of @xmath4 and the consideration of the @xmath72 = @xmath73 value",
    ", the spectrum appears to be vibrational .",
    "but closer inspection reveals that the spacing between yrast levels ( e@xmath74 - e@xmath75 ) increases , although not exactly proportional to i ( or from the plot of @xmath76 vs i(i+1 ) ( not shown ) ) . thus @xmath4 is not a strongly deformed nucleus but lies in the transitional region between spherical @xmath10 and prolate deformed @xmath77 @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to mention here that the @xmath78 spectrum shows a kind of regularity @xcite , and the spectrum of @xmath24 was interpreted as characteristic of a spherical vibrator resulting from a weak interaction of the @xmath4 core with the odd proton .",
    "we may thus term the spectrum of @xmath4 as almost vibrational .",
    "spectrum of @xmath5 is similar to @xmath4 but the regularity mentioned for @xmath4 is not clearly present in @xmath5 .",
    "however from the consideration of the spectrum in @xmath79 @xcite and our recent work @xcite , we may also term the spectrum of @xmath5 as almost vibrational . for @xmath69 ( fig.8 ) , predictions for the energy values of the level spectra are also remarkably good , though the spacings between the @xmath80 , @xmath81 and @xmath82 levels are not very accurately reproduced .",
    "but it is remarkable that for @xmath2 , where experimental level scheme is not known , the two results differ dramatically ( fig.5 ) .",
    "the first three excited states 2@xmath6 , 4@xmath6 , 6@xmath6 , as discussed in section a , appear at about double excitation energies in the calculation with the cwg hamiltonian .",
    "there is a large energy gap @xmath16 2 mev between the 6@xmath53 and 8@xmath53 states for smpn calculation . but",
    "this gap is only about 0.8 mev for cwg results .",
    "this energy gap of about 0.6 - 0.8 mev between @xmath50 and @xmath83 states also exists in the experimental as well as calculated spectra of @xmath84 for both the interactions . in the calculated spectrum of @xmath69 , for both the interactions ,",
    "this gap is @xmath85 .",
    "thus the large gap between these states appears only with the smpn hamiltonian for @xmath2 .",
    "these gaps primarily indicate that the states below and above these gaps necessarily belong to different mulitiplets .",
    "each state belong predominantly to a particular muliplet .",
    "this can be understood well by viewing the occupancy plots in figs .",
    "for example , in @xmath2 , @xmath86 configuration can couple to @xmath87 .",
    "thus for generating the 8@xmath6 state a pair of neutrons must be promoted to a higher lying single particle orbital creating the energy gap .",
    "this gap for the collective almost vibrational nuclei @xmath88 also indicates the dominance of multiplets in the compositions of the wave functions of these vibrational states . at higher spins the agreement between two calculations improves .",
    "the ground state binding energies and spin parities are important observables particularly for application in the nucleosynthesis calculation .",
    "comparison of binding energies calculated for these nuclei using two interactions are shown in the table iv .",
    "the smpn results show good agreement with experimental data @xcite for te , xe and ba isotopes .",
    "the cwg results consistently show over binding for these nuclei , particularly with increasing proton numbers .",
    "but for sn isotope , the smpn shows some over binding .",
    "this was also noted in our previous work @xcite , where we have suggested a systematic correction for neutron - rich species . after introducing that correction for the sn isotopes using the binding energy of @xmath15 from smpn , the results for @xmath2 matches with those from cwg .",
    "the experimental binding energy value for @xmath2 is still not available .",
    "the binding energies for @xmath15 and @xmath4 are obtained from systematics and therefore may have substantial errors .",
    "moreover , it is important to note that cwg predicts a @xmath89 ground state ( b.e=- 55.503 mev ) instead of the observed @xmath90 in @xmath91 .",
    "smpn correctly predicts @xcite the ground state spin - parity in it with the binding energy value of -50.867 mev , which compares very well with the measured value of -50.849(17 ) mev @xcite .",
    "the smpn set of 2-body matrix elements can also reproduce rather well the 6@xmath92 isomer in @xmath26 @xcite .",
    "interestingly , no other interaction that we have used , _ viz .",
    "_ , kh5082 , cw5082 , cwg .. etc",
    ". , usually used in this valence space , can reproduce the isomeric nature of the @xmath93 level with a half life of @xmath94 3 minutes and even the 3@xmath92 ground state is not reproduced in some of these calculations .    for cwg , this deficiency for nuclei with more valence protons than neutrons ,",
    "can perhaps be attributed to the over binding of some of the most important @xmath95 tbmes ( to be discussed in section iii ) .",
    "similarly , in smpn , some important diagonal @xmath96 tbmes still show slight over binding .",
    "better prediction by smpn is definitely due to the fact that at least some of its important tbmes contain empirical information appropriate to this exotic neutron - rich locality .",

    "this means n=82 shell closure still prevails in a strong way with increasing proton number , but the z = 50 shell closure appears to be much weaker with the same number of valence neutrons .",
    "it is indeed satisfactory to note that the vibrational structure in @xmath88 is excellently reproduced in the shell model calculations . in order to show explicitly the amount of configurations contributing less than 1% in building the yrast states in these a=138 isobars , we compare in figs .",

    "b(e2 ) values for @xmath88 , given in table vi are in the range 15 - 20 w.u . , consistent with the characterization of their spectra as vibrational .",
    "so these comparisons clearly indicate that as far as the proton - proton two - body matrix elements are concerned , these two interactions have over all similar performances , except for the over binding of the @xmath95 tbmes in cwg , affecting the binding energies ( with respect to the @xmath1 core ) of the states .",

    "comparison of the predictability of a realistic hamiltonian over a model space , as well as its correlation with an empirical hamiltonian with good predictive power over the same model space can help understanding how realistically various nucleon - nucleon correlations have been taken in to account in obtaining the realistic hamiltonian .    for microscopic understanding of the available data on the structure of these very n - rich nuclei ,",
    "one finds spherical shell model calculations very suitable for this region and thus needs appropriate nuclear hamiltonian .",
    "available kh5082 and cw5082 hamiltonians and very recently effective interaction derived from cd - bonn potential are being used . in our earlier work",

    "as mentioned above , our earlier studies showed that cw5082 is reasonable for n@xmath4584 .",
    "so we started with cw5082 and modified it as far as practicable with the limited experimental data available at that point of time .",
    "the motivation for these changes was also clearly stated in ref .",
    "all the single particle energies ( spes ) of the valence orbitals in the cw5082 were replaced by experimentally determined ones , except the @xmath120 and @xmath35 spes ( table vii ) .",

    "26 tbmes of cw5082 interaction were changed using the data on the binding energies of the ground states and low - lying spectra of the a=134 isobars of sn , sb and te nuclei only and not any other nuclei above the core .",
    "it should be noted that these a=134 nuclei provide information on the neutron - neutron ( @xmath96 ) , proton - neutron ( @xmath121 ) and proton - proton ( @xmath95 ) tbmes , respectively .",
    "modified cw5082 was named as smpn and have been used for shell model calculations for almost all neutron - rich nuclei above @xmath1 core in the range 134@xmath13a@xmath13138 .",
    "some of the results have been presented in @xcite .",
    "it should be mentioned that the new interaction predict better results , compared to cw5082 and other interactions being used in this region , for n@xmath4584 nuclei too .",
    "the relevant spes and tbmes of cw5082 , cwg @xcite and smpn are compared in tables vii and viii , respectively .",
    "it was already pointed out by chou and warburton @xcite that a glaring deficiency in kuo - herling interaction , which is the basic ingredient of cw5082 , is that the neutron - neutron j=0 tbmes are too attractive .",
    "so for an approximate adjustment of this defect those tbmes were multiplied by 0.6 in kh5082 and cw5082 @xcite .",
    "six diagonal @xmath96 tbmes with ( j@xmath71 , t ) = ( 0@xmath6,1 ) of smpn are further reduced by about 50% compared to those of cw5082 .",
    "the reduction of these tbmes , the so - called pairing terms were obtained @xcite by adjusting them to reproduce the binding energy of @xmath17 .",
    "corresponding tbmes of cwg are relatively overbound .",
    "the neutron - neutron j=0 tbmes , the pairing terms , are indeed different from those expected from standard pairing interaction .",
    "but in view of the consistently improved predictability of smpn for the binding energies , level spectra and other spectroscopic properties for almost all the n - rich nuclei in the range 134@xmath13a@xmath13138 as delineated in the present work and elsewhere @xcite , it may be reasonable to conclude that the @xmath122 pairing terms are indeed reduced in this neutron -rich environment .",
    "moreover , slight over binding of the ground states of sn isotopes above @xmath1 as obtained with the smpn hamiltonian suggests further reduction of these matrix elements , which may be due to increasing a or uncertainties in some of the spes .",
    "this reduction of the @xmath96 pairing terms observed @xcite from the shell model applications is consistent with the recent observations @xcite .",
    "three other modified diagonal @xmath96 tbmes with ( @xmath123,t)=(2@xmath6 , 4@xmath6 , 6@xmath6,1 ) are also given in the table .",
    "tbmes @xmath124 have the same phases for all the three interactions , but their magnitudes in smpn are larger than the corresponding values in cw5082 and cwg .",
    "this is because we have assumed purer multiplet structure for 2@xmath6 to 6@xmath6 and also for @xmath125 of @xmath17 , while adjusting the tbmes to reproduce the experimental level scheme .",
    "diagonal @xmath126 of smpn is out of phase with that of cw5082 and cwg .",

    "the cwg tbme with j=6 has much smaller magnitude compared to that for the other two interactions .",
    "comparison of the binding energies and spectra for @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath69 clearly suggests that these most important @xmath128 tbmes are indeed overbound in case of the cwg interaction .",

    "our comparison of the calculated results for the @xmath139 , @xmath140 and @xmath141 level energies with the local systematic trends reveal the evolution of the shell structure below and above the z = 50 , n = 82 shell closure .",

    "the smpn results fit nicely to the systematics of the nuclei ( z=52 - 60 ) above @xmath1 core . for neutron number @xmath142 , the @xmath143 ( z=50 ) isotopes have a special status due to its semi- shell closed structure . but for increasing neutron number ( @xmath41 ) , the z=50 shell closure weakens and @xmath143 isotopes behave very similar to the other z=52 - 60 nuclei . but with cwg , the weakening is not much dramatic , sn isotopes ( n=86,88 ) still retain some speciality , although to a lesser extent . which picture is correct and represent the real situation can only be resolved by experimental data . comparing the structure of the states in @xmath69 with six valence protons with that of the @xmath2 with the same number of neutrons",
    ", it is found that the protons in this valence space are more efficient in generating configuration mixing .",
    "this is essentially due to close spacing between @xmath144 single particle orbitals that permits @xmath95 residual interaction to scatter easily protons to various single particle states .",
    "this comparison also indicates that the increasing neutron number weakens z=50 shell closure in a stronger way than an equal number of protons can do to the n=82 shell closure .    the results for the spectra and binding energies of the ground states of @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath69 , when compared more precisely show that smpn predictions are more close to the experimental data .",
    "this better predictability of the smpn interaction over the cwg may be attributed to the fact that smpn incorporates in some of its important tbmes , the special features of the n - n interaction in the exotic n - rich environment above the @xmath138sn core .",

    "<S> large basis untruncated shell model calculations have been done for the a=138 neutron -rich nuclei in the @xmath0 valence space above the @xmath1 core . </S>",
    "<S> two ( 1 + 2 ) -body nuclear hamiltonians , viz . , realistic cwg and empirical smpn in this model space have been used . </S>",
    "<S> calculated ground state binding energies , level spectra and other spectroscopic properties have been compared with the available experimental data . </S>",
    "<S> importance of untruncated shell model calculations in this model space has been pointed out . </S>",
    "<S> shell model results for the very neutron rich sn isotope ( @xmath2 , </S>",
    "<S> n / z=1.76 ) of astrophysical interest for which no spectroscopic information except @xmath3 -decay half life is available , have been presented . </S>",
    "<S> shell structure and evolution of collectivity in the even - even a=138 isobars have been studied as a function of valence neutron and /or proton numbers . </S>",
    "<S> calculations done for the first time , reproduce remarkably well the collective vibrational states in @xmath4 and @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> comparison of some of the important two - body matrix elements of the empirical smpn , cw5082 and the realistic cwg interactions has been done . </S>",
    "<S> these matrix elements are important for ground state binding energies and low - lying spectra of nuclei in this region . </S>",
    "<S> consideration of the predictability of the two interactions seems to suggest that , in order to incorporate the special features of the n - n interaction in such exotic n - rich environment above the @xmath1 core , the use of local spectroscopic information from the region might be essential . </S>"
