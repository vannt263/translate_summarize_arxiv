    "over the past few years , an impressive convergence of observational facts have led cosmologists to search for alternative cosmologies . among these facts ,",
    "the most ramarkable finding surely comes from distance measurements of type ia supernovae ( sne ia ) that suggest that the expansion of the universe is speeding up , not slowing down @xcite .",
    "such a result , when combined with the latest cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) data and clustering estimates , seems to provide a compelling evidence for a non - zero cosmological constant @xmath4 @xcite .    on the other hand",
    ", it is also well known that the same welcome properties that make models with a relic cosmological constant ( @xmath4cdm ) our best description of the observed universe also result in a serious fine tuning problem @xcite .",
    "the basic reason is the widespread belief that the early universe evolved through a cascade of phase transitions , thereby yielding a vacuum energy density which is presently 120 orders of magnitude smaller than its value at the planck time .",
    "such a discrepancy between theoretical expectations and empirical observations contitutes a fundamental problem at the interface uniting astrophysics , cosmology and particle physics . in the last years",
    ", several attempts have been done in order to alleviate the cosmological constant problem .",
    "for example , in the so - called dynamical @xmath5 scenarios ( or deflationary cosmology ) , the cosmological term is a function of time and its presently observed value is a remnant of the primordial inflationary / deflationary stage @xcite .",
    "other examples are scenarios in which the evolution of classical fields are coupled to the curvature of the space - time background in such a way that their contribution to the energy density self - adjusts to cancel the vacuum energy @xcite , as well as some recent ideas of a su(2 ) cosmological instanton dominated universe @xcite . at least in the two latter exemples ,",
    "an interesting feature is a power - law growth for the cosmological scale factor @xmath6 , where @xmath1 is determined by observational data and takes values within the interval @xmath7 . a linear evolution of the scale factor is also supported in some alternative gravity theories , e.g. , non - minimally coupled scalar - tensorial theories @xcite , as well as in standard model with a specially chosen equation of state @xcite .",
    "the motivation for seriously investigating these power - law scenarios comes from several considerations .",
    "for example , for @xmath8 such models do not suffer the horizon problem .",
    "moreover , the scale factor in such theories does not constrain the matter density parameter and , therefore , they are free of the flatness problem .",
    "there are also observational motivations for considering power - law cosmologies . for @xmath8 , the predicted age of the universe",
    "is @xmath9 , i.e. , at least @xmath10 greater than the prediction of the flat standard model ( without cosmological constant ) , thereby making such a universe confortably in agreement with the recent age estimates of globular clusters and high-@xmath11 redshift galaxies @xcite .",
    "recently , it was shown that such models are also compatible with the currently data of sne ia for a power index @xmath2 @xcite ( see , however , @xcite for a discussion involving sne ia and primordial nucleosynthesis constraints ) .    in this paper",
    "we explore the prospects for constraining the power - law index @xmath1 from the angular size measurements of high-@xmath11 milliarcsecond radio sources .",
    "we also study the influence of this dimensionless parameter on the minimal redshift at which the angular size of an extragalactic source takes its minimal value .",
    "for the sake of simplicity and also motivated by the latest results of cmb analyses we focus our attention on flat scenarios . we show that a good agreement between theory and observation is possible if @xmath12 at @xmath13 c.l . with the characteristic lenght of the sources of the order of @xmath14 pc ( for @xmath15 ) .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section ii some basic assumptions and distance formulas are presented .",
    "the dependence of the minimal redshift @xmath3 on the index @xmath1 is studied in section iii . in section",
    "iv we analyse the constraints from angular size data on this class of cosmologies and compare them with other independent limits . in section v our main conclusions are presented .",
    "let us now consider the flat friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) line element @xmath16,\\ ] ] where @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 are dimensionless comoving coordinates and @xmath20 is the cosmological scale factor .",
    "we study a general class of power law cosmology in which the scale factor is given in terms of the arbitrary dimensionless parameter @xmath21 @xmath22    the expansion rate of the universe is described by the hubble parameter , @xmath23 while the _ present _ expansion rate is defined by a hubble _ constant _ , equal in this model to @xmath24 ( here and subsequently the subscript  o \" refers to its present value ) . by comparing the above expression with some recent estimates of the age parameter , it is possible to obtain directly limits on the dimensionless parameter @xmath1 .",
    "for example , by assuming @xmath25 gyr as a median value for the age estimates of globular clusters and using @xmath26 , in accordance with the final results of the _ hubble space telescope _",
    "key project @xcite , we find @xmath27 .    as usual , the scale factor and the redshift are related by @xmath28 while the dimensionless hubble parameter now takes the form @xmath29    from the above equations , it is straightforward to show that the comoving distance @xmath30 for flat geometries is given by @xmath31,\\ ] ] which , in the limit @xmath32 , reduces to @xmath33    the angular size redshift relation for a rod of intrinsic lenght @xmath34 is easily obtained by integrating the spatial part of eq .",
    "( 1 ) for @xmath17 and @xmath19 fixed @xcite .",
    "one finds @xmath35},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the characteristic lenght @xmath34 is measured in parsecs ( for compact radio sources ) and the characteristic angular scale @xmath36 is given in milliarcsecond ( mas ) .",
    "as is well known , the existence of a critical redshift @xmath3 on the angular size - redshift relation may be qualitatively understood in terms of the cosmological expansion .",
    "the light observed today from a source at a given redshift @xmath11 was emmited when the object was closer ( for a detailed discussion see @xcite ) .",
    "although nearby objects are not affected , a fixed angular size of extragalactic sources at high-@xmath11 is seen iniatially decreasing to a minimal value , say , @xmath3 , and afterwards increasing to higher redshifts .",
    "although this minimal redshift test can not discriminate by itself among different cosmological models ( different scenarios may predict the same @xmath3 values ) @xcite , a precise determination of @xmath3 or , equivalently , the corresponding minimal angular size value @xmath37 , may constitute , when combined with other cosmological tests , a powerful tool to check the validity of realistic world models .",
    "such an effect was first predicted by hoyle @xcite , originally aiming at distinguishing the steady state and einstein - de sitter cosmologies .",
    "later on , the accumulated evidence against the original version of the steady state model have put such a scenario aside , and more recently the same is occurring with the theoretically favoured critical density frw model @xcite .    0.1 in    the redshift @xmath3 at which the angular size takes its minimal value is the one cancelling out the derivative of @xmath18 with respect to @xmath11 . from eq .",
    "( 7 ) , we find @xmath38 which provides @xmath39 in the limit @xmath40 .",
    "such a value is similar to the one predicted by an open frw model with the matter density parameter of the order of @xmath41 ( see table 1 of @xcite ) as well as to the one predicted by a flat model with cosmological constant and @xmath42 ( see table 1 of @xcite ) . in fig .",
    "1 we show the diagram @xmath3 as a function of the dimensionless parameter @xmath1 .",
    "clearly , from the above equation , @xmath3 is an increasing function of @xmath1 .",
    "note still that for values of @xmath43 the minimal redshift takes small values ( @xmath44 ) , which is not observed from the current data . as expected , for @xmath45 the standard prediction , @xmath46 , is readily recovered .",
    "in this section we study the constraints on the parameter @xmath1 from the angular size measurements of high-@xmath11 milliarcsecond radio sources .",
    "to place such constraints we use the @xmath47 data compiled by gurvits _",
    "this data set , originally composed by 330 sources distributed over a wide range of redshift ( @xmath48 ) , was reduced to 145 sources with spectral index between @xmath49 $ ] and total luminosity @xmath50 w / hz in order to minimize any possible dependence of the angular size on the spectral index and/or linear size on luminosity @xcite .",
    "this new subsample was distributed into 12 bins with 12 - 13 sources per bin . in our analysis",
    "we assume that possible evolutionary effects can be removed from this sample since compact radio jets are ( i ) typically less than 100 pc in extent , and therefore , their morphology and kinematics do not depend considerably on the intergalactic medium and ( ii ) they have ages of the order of years , i.e. , much smaller than the cosmological scale of time @xmath51 @xcite .",
    "this particular data set has been extensively used in the recent literature , with several authors aiming mainly at constraining different quintessence scenarios @xcite .    0.1 in    to determine the confidence regions in the plane @xmath52 we use a @xmath53 minimization for the range of @xmath1 and @xmath54 spanning the interval [ 0,1 ] and [ 0.01,2 ] , respectively @xmath55^{2}}{\\sigma_i^{2}}},\\ ] ] where @xmath56 is given by eq .",
    "( 7 ) and @xmath57 stands for the observed values of the angular size with errors @xmath58 of the @xmath59 bin in the sample .",
    "figure 2 shows a log - log plot of the angular size versus redshift for power - law cosmologies with some selected values of the dimensionless parameter @xmath1 . for the sake of comparison , the current favoured cosmological model ,",
    "namely , a flat scenario with @xmath60 of the critical energy density dominated by a cosmological constant ( @xmath4cdm ) is also shown . in fig .",
    "3 we show the contours of constant likelihood ( 68% and 95% ) in the plane @xmath61 .",
    "note that the data set allows a large interval for the parameter @xmath1 , which shows the impossibility of placing very restrictive constraints on the index @xmath1 from the current @xmath62 data . from this analysis",
    "we obtain @xmath63 and @xmath64 ( @xmath65 pc ) as the best fit values .",
    "this particular value of @xmath1 is very close to the one obtained in sec .",
    "ii by using recent age estimates of globular clusters and also supports the idea of a strictly linear evolution of @xmath20 ( i.e. , @xmath66 ) . in fig .",
    "4 , by marginalising over the characteristic angular scale @xmath54 , we show the normalised likelihood curve ( @xmath67 ) as a function of the parameter @xmath1 .",
    "the best - fit value for this parameter corresponds to the maximum value of the likelihood function @xmath68 as can be seen from that figure , the likelihood is a sharply function of @xmath1 with its maximum value centered at @xmath63 .",
    "we also obtain @xmath69 within @xmath13 c.l . and",
    "@xmath70 within @xmath71 c.l ..    0.1 in    at this point , it is also interesting to compare our results with some other independent constraints on the power - law index @xmath1 .",
    "for example , dev _ et al . _",
    "@xcite used sne ia data to show that a good agreement between these data and the class of power - law cosmologies studied here is possible for values of @xmath72 . for a open scenario a study of the statistical properties of gravitational lenses provided @xmath73 at 68% c.l . while the predicted number of lensed quasars for the same sample implied @xmath74 @xcite .",
    "age estimates of high-@xmath11 galaxies require a lower limit of @xmath75 @xcite .",
    "all these determinations agree satisfactorily with the limits obtained from the analysis presented in this paper .    0.1 in",
    "we have studied some properties of the angular size - redshift relation in a general class of power - law cosmologies in which the scale factor is expressed as a function of an arbitrary dimensionless parameter @xmath1 .",
    "we have investigated the influence of this parameter on the redshift @xmath3 at which the angular size takes its minimal value . moreover , by using measurements of the angular size for a large sample of milliarcsecond compact radio sources we also have placed new constraints on the power - law index @xmath1 . in particular , after marginalising over the characteristic angular scale @xmath54 we have found @xmath76 at 68% c.l .",
    ", a result that agrees very well with other independent determinations based on different methods .",
    "we emphasize that if a definitive agreement between the contraints derived from classical cosmological tests and primordial nucleosythesis could be shown , this class of power - law cosmologies would constitute an interesting alternative to the standard cosmology .",
