    "a study of the ( static ) inner fission barrier heights @xmath0 of even - even nuclei is motivated by the importance of this quantity for several physical phenomena .",
    "many heavy nuclei decay by spontaneous fission , and the size of the fission barrier is a measure for the stability of a nucleus reflected in the spontaneous fission lifetimes of these nuclei  @xcite .",
    "the probability for the formation of a superheavy nucleus in a heavy - ion - fusion reaction is also directly connected to the height of its fission barrier  @xcite .",
    "the height @xmath0 is a decisive quantity in the competition between neutron evaporation and fission of a compound nucleus in the process of its cooling .",
    "the large sensitivity of the cross section @xmath1 for the synthesis of the fissioning nuclei on the barrier height @xmath0 stresses a need for accurate calculations of this value .",
    "for example , a change of @xmath0 by 1 mev changes the calculated survival probability of a synthesized nucleus by about one order of magnitude or even more  @xcite .",
    "the population and survival of hyperdeformed states at high spin also depends on the fission barriers  @xcite .",
    "in addition , the @xmath2process of stellar nucleosynthesis depends ( among other quantities such as masses and @xmath3-decay rates ) on the fission barriers of very neutron - rich nuclei  @xcite .    during the last decade",
    "the role of triaxiality in the region of the saddle point of fission barriers has been recognized and tested in many theoretical frameworks .",
    "it was found that the height of the barrier is reduced when triaxial shapes are allowed  @xcite .",
    "however , this lowering strongly depends on the proton and neutron numbers and on the model employed .",
    "the investigations of inner fission barriers with triaxiality included are available within the frameworks of the microscopic+macroscopic method  @xcite , the extended thomas - fermi plus strutinsky integral  @xcite , and non - relativistic energy density functionals based on skyrme  @xcite and gogny  @xcite forces .",
    "covariant density functional theory ( cdft )  @xcite is an approach alternative to the above mentioned non - relativistic methods .",
    "built on lorentz covariance and the dirac equation , it provides a natural incorporation of spin degrees of freedom  @xcite and an accurate description of spin - orbit splittings  @xcite ( see also fig . 2 in ref .",
    "@xcite ) , which has an essential influence on the underlying shell structure .",
    "lorentz covariance of the cdft equations leads to the fact that time - odd mean fields of this theory are determined as spatial components of lorentz vectors and therefore coupled with the same constants as the time - like components  @xcite which are fitted to ground state properties of finite nuclei .",
    "in addition , pseudo - spin symmetry finds a natural explanation in the relativistic framework  @xcite . over the years a large variety of nuclear phenomena",
    "have been successfully described within the cdft ( see ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) .    however , the progress in the study of the fission barriers within cdft has been slower than in its non - relativistic counterparts .",
    "inner fission barriers in several nuclei have been calculated in the axially symmetric relativistic mean field ( rmf ) + bcs approach in refs .",
    "@xcite . however , these investigations employ the constant gap approximation in the bcs part .",
    "our recent study of pairing schemes used for the calculations of fission barriers clearly shows that this approximation leads to unphysical results for the fission barriers  @xcite .",
    "thus , the results of these works have to be treated with a caution .",
    "fission barriers have also been studied in axially symmetric rmf calculations within the bcs approximation using an effective density - dependent zero - range force in the pairing channel ; this force represents a much more realistic approximation for pairing @xcite .",
    "recently also relativistic hartree - bogoliubov ( rhb ) calculations with the gogny force d1s and with @xmath4-forces in the pairing channel have been carried out  @xcite for a study of fission barriers with axial symmetry .",
    "unfortunately , axially symmetric calculations can not be directly compared with experimental data since , as has been shown in non - relativistic calculations  @xcite , the lowering of fission barriers due to triaxiality is significant and can reach 3 - 4 mev in some nuclei . at present , no systematic studies of the effects of triaxial degrees of freedom on the height of inner fission barriers are available in the covariant density functional theory ; this degree of freedom has only been studied in specific nuclei such as @xmath5hs @xcite and @xmath6pu @xcite within the rmf+bcs approach as well as @xmath6pu @xcite within the rhb approach .",
    "thus , the main goal of the current manuscript is to perform a systematic investigation of the inner fission barriers within the triaxial rmf+bcs approach , and for the first time to confront these important experimental quantities with cdft in a systematic way .",

    "@xcite that the schematic rotational correction based on the belyaev moment of inertia  @xcite frequently used in the literature gives a reduction of the fission barrier height which is appreciably larger than the one due to angular momentum projection .",
    "based on these results , no rotational corrections are taken into account in our calculations . a similar approach has been used in the very successful calculations of ref .",
    "@xcite .    in the current investigation",
    "we do not consider the outer fission barriers .",
    "however , this restriction has its own merits .",
    "the inner barriers are generally better measured than the outer ones , and they are certainly more important for the @xmath2 process , since they determine thresholds . furthermore , spontaneous fission lifetimes tend to be dominated by the inner barrier , even if occasionally an outer barrier can have a crucial effect if it is wide enough .",
    "the consideration of only inner fission barriers allows us to restrict our calculations to reflection symmetric shapes , because the odd - multipole deformations ( octupole , etc . )",
    "do not play a role in the inner fission barrier of the actinides and superheavy nuclei @xcite .",
    "however , the analysis of the symmetric fission pathway , which is the lowest in energy in heavy actinide nuclei such as some fm isotopes ( see refs .",
    "@xcite ) , is also possible in the current framework .",
    "the rmf+bcs equations are solved in the basis of an anisotropic three - dimensional harmonic oscillator in cartesian coordinates characterized by the deformation parameters @xmath62 and @xmath63 and the oscillator frequency @xmath64 mev ( see refs .",

    "the deformation parameters of the oscillator basis @xmath62 and @xmath63 are selected to be close to expected values @xmath65 and @xmath66 of constrained solution ; this improves the convergence and minimizes the computational time .",
    "the truncation of the basis is performed in such a way that all states belonging to the shells up to @xmath67 fermionic shells and @xmath68 bosonic shells are taken into account .",
    "the computational time increases considerably with the increase of @xmath67 but it is much less dependent on @xmath68 .",
    "thus , special attention has been paid to the selection of @xmath67 of the basis to be chosen for a systematic study of fission barriers for the nuclei of interest , which provides at the same time a reasonable numerical accuracy in the predictions of the physical observables .",
    "the selection of the truncation scheme was guided by the detailed analysis of the convergence performed in axially symmetric rmf+bcs and rhb calculations of ref .",
    "@xcite . in this reference ,",
    "extensive tests of numerical convergence have been performed in the spherical , normal - deformed and superdeformed ( @xmath69 ) minima in the rmf calculations without pairing on the example of the nuclei @xmath70u and @xmath71 with @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",
    "contrary to the previous studies of the convergence in the rmf framework which were based on the comparison of the @xmath67 and @xmath74 results , the exact  solution ( extending the calculations up to @xmath75 ) has been defined .",
    "then it was shown that the binding energies and inner fission barriers for @xmath76 and @xmath77 were described with an accuracy of approximately 200 kev and 100 kev , respectively , as compared with the exact solution .",
    "therefore , the systematic calculations in the present manuscript have been carried out with @xmath78 and @xmath79 .",
    "this selection of the basis is in line with our previous convergence tests in different mass regions ( see , for example , ref.@xcite ) which clearly show that at large deformations full convergence of the binding energies is reached at larger values of @xmath80 than at lower deformations .",
    "in addition , they show that larger sizes of the basis ( larger @xmath80 and @xmath81 values ) are needed for the nuclei with larger proton @xmath48 and neutron @xmath47 numbers ( see refs.@xcite ) .    of course , as long as the same number of fermionic shells @xmath80 and the same deformation of the basis @xmath62 is used , calculations with the axial code should give identical results to those obtained with the triaxial code at @xmath82 .",
    "in fact for nuclei under study we find agreement with an accuracy of approximately 50 kev throughout the deformation range of interest , which is caused by small differences in the mesh points of the gaussian integrations for the matrix elements . as a result for axially symmetric shapes ,",

    ", triaxial rmf+bcs calculations are more computationally demanding than the ones performed in the triaxial skyrme edf with bcs approximation of ref .",
    "this is also a reason why we treat the pairing channel in the present triaxial rmf calculations in the bcs approximation despite the fact that triaxial cranked relativistic hartree+bogoliubov approach has been developed in the end of nineties  @xcite and successfully applied to the description of rotational structures in the pairing regime in different mass regions @xcite .",
    "the rmf+bcs calculations are less time - consuming than the rhb calculations .",

    "@xcite because here the effective pairing window is quite small being around 7 mev . on the other hand , the dependence of the pairing strength on @xmath80 increases with the increase of @xmath83 .",
    "this can be understood in the following way : an increase of @xmath80 brings more single - particle states into the pairing window thus effectively requiring the decrease of pairing strength in order to keep the pairing gap fixed .",

    "these energies depend only weakly on @xmath80 in the case of prescription of ref.@xcite because of the small effective pairing window .",
    "however , similar to the pairing strengths the dependence of pairing energies on @xmath80 increases significantly with increasing @xmath97 .",
    "the origin of this feature is the same as in the case of the pairing strengths ; it is discussed above .",
    "note , however , that the dramatic changes in the pairing energy can not be seen directly in the change of the energy , because they are compensated to some extent by the fact that larger pairing seen in pairing energies causes a wider distribution of the occupation probabilities @xmath98 around the fermi surface .",

    "somewhat different values of @xmath99 at lower @xmath80 values are due to the fact that at these values of @xmath80 the effects of the truncation of basis in the particle - hole channel have not been eliminated ( see sect .  [ trun - ph ] for detail ) .    in figs .",
