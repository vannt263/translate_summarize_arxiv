    "communication over rapidly time - varying channels where the receiver is unable to estimate the channel state is a challenging task . in particular , for a mobile receiver the estimation may become difficult and the limits of information transfer in this scenario is vital when the channel becomes non - coherent . in this paper",
    "we study the capacity of the non - coherent rayleigh fading mimo channel to identify the limits of information transfer with no csi at both ends .",
    "one of the important problems in information theory is that of computing the capacity of a given communication channel , and finding the optimal input distribution that achieves capacity .",
    "the capacity problem is addressed by maximising the mutual information , a concave function subject to some constraints on the channel input distribution . for discrete finite - size input alphabets ,",
    "this is a finite dimensional problem and all the input constraints are such that they define a compact , convex set , where the optimisation is straightforward .",
    "however , for continuous input channels , neither the continuity of the objective function , nor the compactness of the constraint set is now obvious , and the optimisation for capacity is considered a difficult problem",
    ".    a large amount of literature has appeared in the area of multi - antenna wireless communications over the past decade .",
    "much of the interest was motivated by the work in which shows a potential increase in the channel capacity using multiple antennas for both transmitting and receiving .",
    "the capacity of the mimo channel , when neither the transmitter nor the receiver has csi , has traditionally been considered an open and difficult problem . in this paper",
    ", we provide an upper bound on the non - coherent rayleigh fading mimo channel capacity for any receive antenna number at any snr and elaborate on the discrete nature of the optimal input .",
    "the mimo channel capacity derived in @xcite , is based on the assumptions that i ) the channel matrix elements are independent and _ _ circularly symmetric _ _ is said to be circularly symmetric if for any deterministic @xmath1 , the distribution of random variable @xmath2 is identical to the distribution of @xmath3 .",
    "] complex gaussian ; ii ) the noise at different receive antennas are independent and white and ; iii ) the csi is perfectly known at the receiver but not to the transmitter .",
    "the main result is linear capacity growth with the minimum number of transmit and receive antennas .",
    "also @xcite shows that the optimum input distribution which achieves this channel capacity is circularly symmetric complex gaussian which maximises the channel output entropy when the csi is known .    the capacity evaluation using monte carlo method when the receiver csi is perfectly known is shown in @xcite .",
    "the results extends telatar s work @xcite and provides accurate numerical results .",
    "furthermore @xcite shows the use of _ water filling _ on the input gaussian vector when receiver and transmitter csi is available at the both transmitter and receiver .",
    "the increase in capacity is significant for small number of antennas and at low snr . at high",
    "snr the fading is less destructive and the water filling solution does not provide a considerable gain over the capacity with csi at the receiver only .",
    "the non - coherent channel capacity of the time selective rayleigh fading channel is studied in @xcite .",
    "upper and lower bounds on the capacity at high snr for single antenna systems is shown , and derived a lower bound on the capacity with multi - antennas .",
    "abou - faycal , trott and shamai @xcite investigated the single input single output ( siso ) discrete time memoryless rayleigh fading channel , proving that the capacity achieving distribution is discrete with a finite number of mass points .",
    "in addition , taricco @xcite showed the capacity supremum and confirmed that the attainable input distribution is discrete in agreement with abou - faycal s results . a general channel model is considered in @xcite ignoring the structure of the channel .",
    "conversely in @xcite , the channel is assumed to have only additive noise , and in @xcite , the channel is assumed to have both additive and multiplicative noise . in @xcite",
    "it is shown that under a peak power constrained input , the capacity achieving input distribution is discrete , and attempts to make a case for the argument that continuous capacity achieving distributions are actually anomalies , and for most channels the optimal input distribution is discrete with a finite number of mass points .",
    "similar work is reported by marzetta and hochward @xcite in non - coherent rayleigh fading mimo channels using a block fading model over a coherence interval of @xmath4 symbol periods .",
    "they characterised a certain structure of the optimal input distribution and computed the channel capacity with reduced complexity . the coherence capacity with channel coherence time @xmath4",
    "is used as the upper bound .",
    "also , it is shown that the non - coherent channel capacity approaches the coherent capacity as @xmath4 becomes large where the optimal input is approximately independent complex gaussian .",
    "zheng and tse @xcite extended this work and specifically computed the asymptotic capacity at both high and low snr in terms of @xmath4 and the number of transmit and receive antenna elements .",
    "the suggested input is to transmit orthogonal vectors on a certain number of transmit antennas with constant equal norms .",
    "they also claim that having more transmit antennas than receive antennas does not provide any capacity gain at high snr , while having more receive antennas yield a capacity gain .",

    "this double logarithmic bahavior is a good example to visualise the low capacity available with no csi compared to the coherent capacity given for mimo @xcite and siso @xcite systems respectively .    in this paper",
    "we address the non - coherent uncorrelated rayleigh fading mimo channel and show a capacity supremum optimising the mutual information under average power constrained input for any snr .",
    "the contributions of the paper as follows :    1 .",
    "we provide the mutual information of the non - coherent rayleigh fading mimo channel in simple form using output differential entropies .",
    "2 .   we optimise the mutual information using lagrange optimisation method and show a capacity supremum for a given number of receive antennas at any snr .",
    "we show the asymptotic analysis of the capacity supremum with double logarithmic behavior at high snr , similar to the results shown in @xcite and conjecture the discrete nature of the optimal input .",

    "<S> this paper investigates the limits of information transfer over a fast rayleigh fading mimo channel , where neither the transmitter nor the receiver has the knowledge of the channel state information ( csi ) except the fading statistics . </S>",
    "<S> we develop a scalar channel model due to absence of the phase information in non - coherent rayleigh fading and derive a capacity supremum with the number of receive antennas at any signal to noise ratio ( snr ) using lagrange optimisation . also , we conceptualise the discrete nature of the optimal input distribution by posing the optimisation on the channel mutual information for @xmath0 discrete inputs . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we derive an expression for the asymptotic capacity when the input power is large , and compare with the existing capacity results when the receiver is equipped with a large number of antennas .    channel capacity , mutual information , rayleigh fading , upper bound , siso , mimo , lagrange optimisation . </S>"
