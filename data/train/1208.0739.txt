    "in the present paper , we used a graphene nanoribbon ( gnr ) that has @xmath0 @xmath1 in width and an atomic layer in thickness .",
    "the dna strand is considered as a ribbon wrapping the gnr .",
    "the pitch along the axis of helical dna is @xmath2 , the width of dna strand is @xmath3 . following previous work @xcite ,",
    "the system is depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] .",
    "( color online ) the scheme of agnr - dna based biosensor model.,width=207 ]    in this model , the effective dielectric constant of dna and surrounding medium is given @xmath4 here @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the dielectric constants of dna and solution , respectively , and @xmath7 is the ratio of dna - covered surface area per total surface area of the gnr . using the model of the model of helical ribbon for dna , the expression of the ratio @xmath7 is obtained as a function of structural parameters of dna and gnr @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the straight length in a period of dna . @xmath9 is approximately calculated by the following expression @xmath10    for our calculation , it is assumed that dna is a spring .",
    "it is easy to see that a position in @xmath11 axis is indicated @xmath12    the total potential of dna is generally presented by @xcite @xmath13 in which @xmath14 is the bending potential , @xmath15 is the torsional potential , and @xmath16 is the gravitational potential .",
    "@xmath16 can be ignored in nanoscale systems .",
    "the forms of @xmath14 and @xmath15 are performed @xmath17 here @xmath18 is the young s modulus , @xmath19 is the shear modulus , @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the second moments of area of the spring , @xmath22 is the straight length of the spring , @xmath23 and @xmath24 are the initial curvature and torsion of the spring , respectively .",
    "@xmath25 and @xmath26 are calculated via other quantities @xmath27    note that in a period , @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 , combining these parameters and eq.([eq:3 ] ) , @xmath25 and @xmath26 can be rewritten @xmath31 substituting eq.([eq:8 ] ) into eq.([eq:6 ] ) , one finds the total potential @xmath32 in the case of equilibrium system , minimizing the total potential energy of dna yields @xmath33 as a result , we finally obtain the expression of ratio @xmath7 @xmath34 here @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath3 are @xmath37 , @xmath38 and @xmath39 nm , respectively , for b dna ; and @xmath40 @xmath1 , @xmath41 @xmath1 , and @xmath42 @xmath1 for z dna @xcite .",
    "we will consider a model of two - dimensional exciton formed by electron and hole .",
    "the interaction of electron - hole pair is known as the attractive coulomb potential .",
    "the exciton hamiltonian has the form @xcite @xmath43 here @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 are the effective masses and positions of the electron and hole , respectively , @xmath48 represents the coulomb interaction between the electron and hole .    introducing the coordinate of center of mass @xmath49 and the relative @xmath50 position @xmath51 for the motion in the x - y plane , the reduced mass of electron - hole pair @xmath52",
    ", the transformed hamiltonian reads @xmath53 by using the separation of variables and solution of the wannier model have been applied to the 2d semiconductor systems @xcite and agnr systems @xcite , the exciton energy levels are give by @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the exciton energy , @xmath56 is the band gap , @xmath57 is the relative dielectric constant , @xmath58 is integers , and @xmath59 is the wave vector that is obtained in the calculation due to the form of the envelope function @xmath60 . the second term is the binding exciton energy , denoted by @xmath61 .",
    "since the motion of the center of mass is extremely small , so we can approximate @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",
    "it is remarkable that the binding exciton energy is quite sensitive to the effect of the external fields .",
    "if the external interactions have larger energies than the exciton energy , the state of exciton can be broken . in terms of the 3d materials",
    ", @xmath61 is not large enough to observe in the room temperature",
    ". therefore , one only reports the existence of the exciton effects in low temperatures .",
    "however , in the low dimensional systems , the exciton effect can be observed in @xmath64 @xmath65 because the quantum confinement creates an increase of overlap of wavefunctions .",
    "it means that the coulomb interactions and the binding exciton energies are boosted .",
    "it can be easily realized that for the first exciton state of 2d materials ( @xmath66 ) , @xmath61 is four times larger than that of 3d materials .    for gnr system , we have another approximation .",
    "the influence of edge effects on interactions is neglected . from this , the binding exciton energy of gnr can be calculated by the effective masses and the effective dielectric constant of medium .",
    "the larger dielectric constant is , the smaller @xmath61 is .",
    "it is essential to note that our gnr has a finite width but an infinite length . in the ref .",
    "@xcite , authors pointed out the energy gap as a function of the number of carbon atoms across their width , namely , @xmath67 . for @xmath68 , @xmath69 , @xmath70 ,",
    "the energy gap is quite small , so gnrs can be metallic ribbons . for other value of @xmath67 ,",
    "the magnitudes of the energy gap are larger .",
    "thus , these types of gnrs are able to be sgrs .",
    "an additional point is that the increase of the gnr width causes the decrease of energy gap .    despite of non - stopping attempt of gnrs studies , manufacturing gnrs in the sub-10 nm regime",
    "is a challenging problem .",
    "the cutting - edge breakthoughs proved that one can produce agnrs with ultrasmooth edges and the width below 10 nm @xcite , particularly the ultranarrow width of agnrs down to 6 nm @xcite , 2 - 3 nm @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , authors used various chemical approaches to make the width of gnrs down to 1 - 2 nm . therefore , it is possible to fabricate a type of sensor involving narrow width of agnrs less than 3 nm .",
    "as mentioned above , dna under the critical conditions has structural transformations .",
    "it can be explained by the interactions between negative surface charges of dna and cations of solution . for different types of dna ,",
    "the critical concentrations of the same cation undergoing the b - z structural transition have deviation @xcite .",
    "another interesting point is that the higher valence cation is , the lower critical concentration is .",
    "when the structural transition occurs , the dna area covering gnr changes . as a consequence , the ratio @xmath7 and the effective dielectric constant @xmath57 vary .",
    "it leads to the change of the exciton binding energy .",
    "it is basis in order to apply to design biosensor that can detect the relatively low concentration of high - valent metal caution below the cell scale of biology in blood or in biological cell .",
    "[ fig:2 ] presents the width - dependent dielectric constants of dna in the form of b and z. in the calcualtion , the dielectric constant of dna and water are @xmath71 @xcite and @xmath72 @xcite , respectively .",
    "it is important to note that when exciton effects and optical properties of the systems are calculated , the gnr should be semiconductor . the number of unit cells across the gnr width should be the form of @xmath73 or @xmath74 , here @xmath75 is an integer .",
    "therefore , the width of gnr has to be discrete value instead of continous value .",
    "( color online ) effective dielectric constant of dna and medium as a function of the agnr width.,width=340 ]    then , the exciton binding energy shift @xmath76 at @xmath77 can be obtained @xmath78 here @xmath79 and @xmath80 are the effective dielectric constant when dna is taken the form of b and z , respectively .",
    "we have @xmath81 in the b - z structural transition in fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] , where @xmath82 is the rest mass of electron .",
    "( color online ) @xmath81 in the b - z structural transition as a function of the agnr width.,width=340 ]    in fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] , @xmath81 in the case of the number of the unit cells across the width @xmath83 or @xmath84 is in the same curve .",
    "however , when we insert the effective mass of exciton of agnr @xcite into the expression of @xmath76 and plot it in fig .",
    "[ fig:4 ] .",
    "( color online ) the shift of exciton binding energy in the b - z structural transition as a function of the agnr width.,width=340 ]    as we can see , the curves corresponding to @xmath83 and @xmath84 are separated .",
    "a simple reason is that the effective mass of exciton depends on the agnr width .",
    "suppose that the periodic conditions are applied in agnr , the band structure of agnr is similar to the band structure of swcnt with the diameter equal to the width of agnr .",
    "thus , the larger the width is , the smaller the effective mass is .",
    "the effective mass goes to zero when the width goes to infinity .",
    "the gnr infinite width means that gnr is graphene .",
    "@xcite confirmed that the effective masses of electrons and holes of monolayer graphene are zero .",
    "the simple explaination has aggreement with the computational results in @xcite in terms of qualitative analysis .",
    "the discrepancy between theoretical calculation and simulation calculation @xcite is due to the edge effect of agnrs . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:4 ] , when increasing the width of agnrs , the curves of in the case of 3p and 3p + 1 are closer and closer",
    ". the boundary conditions will disappear if the agnr width is large enough .",
    "a remarkable point is that in the simulation calculations is larger than that of theoretical calculations .",
    "the exciton binding energy in simulation is approximately proportional to @xmath85 but eq.4 points out that the energy is inverse proportional to @xmath86 .",
    "it shows that the screening effect of electron in agnrs is weak and plays an important role in the exciton binding energy .",
    "it also means that the exciton binding energy is much less dependent of environment @xcite .    in order to compare the exciton binding energy shift of agnrs @xcite with that of cnts ,",
    "the values are chosen with the agnr width nearly equal to cnt s diameter .",
    "@xmath76 in the agnr case is slightly smaller than that of cnt case .",
    "gnrs can be considered as unzipped cnts .",
    "it results that there are some similarities with the excitonic behavior in cnts and gnrs . in the presence of magnetic field or electric field ,",
    "the exciton binding energy and band gap of two carbon prototypes depend strongly on the fields @xcite",
    ". however , gnrs has characteristic properties , such as gnrs becomes a half - metallic material when in - plane external electric is applied @xcite , or there are spin polarization at the edge atoms of zigzag gnrs @xcite .",
    "the behaviors pave the way for unexpected applications and new generation devices .    on the other hand , advanced techniques allow controlling effectively edge modifications of gnrs due to their planar structure .",
    "some recent theoretical studies have investigated the optical properties of new type configuration of gnrs , so - called chevron - type gnrs ( cgnrs ) @xcite .",
    "it is shown that the exciton binding energy of cgnrs is greater than that of regular gnrs .",
    "the result may lead to the increase of sensitivity of agnrs based sensors .",
    "the combination between dna and gnr is very interesting problem that sparks new studies in the future . by using a simple model for dna",
    ", we have investigated the environment - dependent properties of biosensor .",
    "we showed the expression of effective dielectric constant of medium .",
    "in addition , we demonstrated that it is possible to record the b - z structural transition via the change of the exciton binding energy .",
    "our biosensor has good behavior when the width of agnr is small .",
