    "chiral symmetry breaking @xmath7 and its restoration , with @xmath8 light quark flavours , has been a milestone in our present understanding of the quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) phase diagram and hadronic physics under extreme conditions of temperature @xmath0 and baryon density , as those produced in heavy - ion and nuclear matter experimental facilities such as rhic , cern ( alice ) and fair .",
    "lattice simulations support that deconfinement and chiral restoration take place very close to one another in the phase diagram . in the physical case @xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) and for vanishing baryon chemical potential ,",
    "they point towards a smooth crossover transition at pseudocritical temperature @xmath11 145 - 165 mev @xcite , the results being fairly consistent with the @xmath3 universality class @xcite , which would hold for two light flavours in the chiral limit @xmath12 .",
    "the crossover nature of the transition means in particular that there is no unique way to identify the transition point , the most efficient one in lattice being the scalar susceptibility peak position , rather than the vanishing point for the quark condensate @xmath13 , the order parameter , which decreases asymptotically with @xmath0 for @xmath14 .",
    "the equivalence with the @xmath15 breaking pattern for @xmath16 led to early proposals of @xmath17 meson degeneration (  chiral partners \" ) at chiral restoration @xcite which in its simplest linear realization takes place through the @xmath18-component of the @xmath3 field @xmath19 acquiring a thermal vacuum expectation value and mass both vanishing at the transition in the chiral limit . degeneration in the vector - axial vector sector ( @xmath20 and @xmath21 states ) as a signature of chiral restoration has also been thoroughly studied @xcite .",
    "nowadays , we know that the @xmath18 state is well established as a @xmath22 scattering broad resonance for isospin and angular momentum @xmath23 , known as @xmath24 @xcite , which is then difficult to accommodate as an asymptotically free state , like in the linear model . precisely , one of our main conclusion here will be that this asymptotic description is not needed .",
    "in fact , in order to study chiral partner degeneration in the scalar - pseudoscalar sector , it is more appropriate to analyze the corresponding current correlation functions @xcite which can be derived from a chiral effective lagrangian without introducing explicitly a particle - like @xmath18 degree of freedom .",
    "the scalar and pseudoscalar susceptibilities in terms of the corresponding qcd @xmath25 currents are given by :    @xmath26}=\\int_e{d^4x \\left[\\frac{\\delta}{\\delta s(x)}\\frac{\\delta}{\\delta s(0)}z[s , p]\\bigg\\vert_{s = m_q , p^a=0}\\right]},\\label{chisdef}\\\\   \\chi_p ( t)\\delta^{ab}&=&\\int_e{d^4x \\langle { \\cal t } p^a ( x ) p^b ( 0 )   \\rangle_t}\\equiv \\delta^{ab } \\int_e{d^4x k_p ( x)}= \\int_e{d^4x \\left[\\frac{\\delta}{\\delta p^a(x)}\\frac{\\delta}{\\delta p^b(0)}z[s , p]\\bigg\\vert_{s = m_q , p^a=0}\\right]},\\label{chipdef}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath27 is the quark field , @xmath28 and @xmath29 are respectively the pseudoscalar current and its correlator , the euclidean measure @xmath30 with @xmath31 and @xmath32 denotes a thermal average . for @xmath1 , parity invariance of the qcd vacuum ( @xmath33 ) and isospin symmetry have been used . in the above equation , @xmath34 $ ]",
    "is the qcd generating functional with scalar and pseudoscalar sources @xmath35 coupled to the massless lagrangian in the light sector as @xmath36 , so that @xmath37 $ ] is the qcd partition function .",
    "thus , should the scalar and pseudoscalar currents become degenerate at chiral restoration , @xmath5 and @xmath4 would meet at that point .",
    "since @xmath2 is expected to increase , as a measure of the fluctuations of the order parameter , at least up to the transition point , it seems plausible that they meet near the transition . in an ideal @xmath3 pattern ,",
    "the matching should take place near the maximum of @xmath2 .",
    "since @xmath38 has the quantum numbers of the pion field @xmath39 , its correlators , like @xmath29 , are saturated by the pion state at low energies .",
    "let us first review the prediction arising from the low - energy theorems of current algebra , equivalent to the leading order ( lo ) in the low - energy expansion of chiral lagrangians . at that order",
    ", one has @xmath40 ( from pcac theorem ) with @xmath41 and where @xmath42 and @xmath43 are the pion decay constant and mass respectively , so that @xmath44 from eq.([chipdef ] ) , being @xmath45 the pion propagator in momentum space @xmath46 and @xmath47 the matsubara frequency with integer @xmath48 .",
    "thus , the pseudoscalar correlator , saturated with the dominant pion state , is just proportional to the pion propagator at this order .",
    "in addition , to lo the euclidean propagator is just the free one @xmath49 ( interactions are suppressed at low energies ) with @xmath50 , so that using also the gell - mann - oakes - renner ( gor ) relation @xmath51 , valid at this order , we would get @xmath52 , as a first indication of the relation between the pseudoscalar susceptibility and the quark condensate at the lo given by current algebra .",
    "the latter result can actually be obtained formally as a ward identity ( wi ) from the qcd lagrangian @xcite , in connection with the definition of the quark condensate for lattice wilson fermions @xcite . however",
    ", both sides of the identity suffer from qcd renormalization ambiguities , so that this wi is formally well - defined only for exact chiral symmetry @xcite .",
    "it is therefore interesting to study , and so we will do in the next section , how this identity is realized within chiral perturbation theory ( chpt ) @xcite , which describes the low - energy chiral symmetry broken phase of qcd in a model - independent framework where symmetry breaking is realized non - linearly and pions are the only degrees of freedom in the lagrangian .",
    "the previous current - algebra results are actually just the lo in the chpt expansion in powers of a generic low - energy scale @xmath53 , denoting pion momenta or temperature , relative , respectively , to @xmath54 1 gev and @xmath55 .",
    "these are nothing but indicative natural upper limits for the chiral expansion in terms of scattering ( typical resonance scale ) and thermodynamics ( critical phenomena ) respectively , although both are treated on the same foot in the chiral expansion .",
    "in particular , the lo prediction for @xmath1 is temperature independent , so it is not obvious that it can be simply extrapolated as , say , @xmath56 .",
    "actually , all the quantities involved change with temperature due to pion loop corrections , namely @xmath57 , @xmath58 and @xmath59 @xcite .    similarly , from eq.([chisdef ] ) , one can relate @xmath2 with the propagator of a `` @xmath18-like state '' such that it couples linearly to the external scalar source @xmath60 in an explicit symmetry - breaking term @xmath61 . without further specification about its nature and its coupling to other physical states such as pions ,",
    "one already gets @xmath62 , suggesting a growing behaviour inversely proportional to @xmath63 as the sigma state reduces its mass to become degenerate with the pion .",
    "we also recall that the problem of @xmath64 degeneration has been studied in nuclear matter at @xmath65 in @xcite , to linear order in nuclear density . in that work ,",
    "current algebra is assumed to hold through pcac in the operator representation and other low - energy theorems such as gor , which as discussed in the previous paragraphs , leads to the pseudoscalar correlator @xmath29 being directly proportional to the pion propagator .",
    "the authors in @xcite work within low - energy models at finite density for which this pcac realization holds , so that by including the proper finite - density corrections to @xmath66 , which carries out all the density dependence of @xmath67 through an in - medium mass , and to @xmath68 , the relation @xmath52 is found to hold in the nuclear medium .",
    "this result provides another supporting argument for the relation between the condensate and the pseudoscalar susceptibility and represents an additional motivation for our present chpt analysis , where we do not need to make any assumption about the validity of current algebra .",
    "the next to leading order ( nlo ) corrections to @xmath1 can be obtained systematically and in a model - independent way within chpt , where one can also calculate the scalar susceptibility @xmath2 to a given order only in terms of pion degrees of freedom .",
    "the price to pay is that we expect to reproduce only the behaviour of @xmath69 for low and moderate temperatures .",
    "however , since @xmath1 is dominated by pions , whose dynamics are well described through chpt , we expect to obtain a reasonable qualitative description of its @xmath0 behaviour , whereas standard chpt misses the peak structure of @xmath2 near the transition .",
    "we note in turn that the lo for @xmath2 vanishes , unlike that of @xmath1 .",
    "the chpt nlo result for @xmath70 can be found in @xcite .    for @xmath71",
    "we consider the effective lagrangian @xmath72 , where @xmath73 , including their dependence on the pseudoscalar source @xmath74 as given in @xcite .",
    "we follow similar steps as in @xcite , now for the pseudoscalar correlator @xmath29 .",
    "the lo comes from @xmath75 only and reproduces the current - algebra prediction .",
    "the nlo corrections to @xmath29 are of the following types :    * the nlo corrections to the pion propagator @xmath76 , which come both from @xmath75 one - loop tadpole - like contributions @xmath77 and from tree level @xmath78 constant terms , * pion self - interactions @xmath79 in @xmath75 contributing as @xmath80 , * crossed terms @xmath81 giving @xmath82 multiplied by a nlo contribution , * @xmath83 terms giving rise to a contact contribution proportional to @xmath84 .    the final result for the pseudoscalar correlator in momentum space for euclidean four - momentum @xmath53",
    "can be written as :    @xmath85    where subleading terms are labeled by their @xmath86 dependence .",
    "the nlo propagator includes wave function and mass renormalization ( at this order in chpt there is no imaginary part for the self - energy ) :    @xmath87    where the lo propagator corresponds to @xmath88 and is temperature independent .",
    "@xmath42 and @xmath43 are the lagrangian pion mass and decay constant , related to the vacuum ( @xmath65 ) physical values @xmath89 mev , @xmath90 93 mev , by @xmath91 corrections @xcite .",
    "the constant @xmath92 in eq.([kp ] ) is temperature independent and is a finite combination of low - energy constants ( lec ) of @xmath78 @xcite . in the chpt scheme",
    ", the divergent part of the @xmath78 lec cancels the loop divergences from @xmath75 such that pion observables are finite and independent of the low - energy renormalization scale . to nlo in chpt all the pion loop contributions in eq.([kp ] ) are proportional to the tadpole - like contribution @xmath93 with the thermal function :    @xmath94    which is an increasing function of @xmath0 for any mass .",
    "thus , the pion thermal mass in the nlo propagator is given at this order by @xmath95 $ ] and is finite and scale - independent .",
    "the same holds for @xmath96 $ ] and for @xmath97 $ ] @xcite .",
    "note that @xmath98 decreases with @xmath0 a factor of 3 slower than the condensate @xmath13 .",
    "in addition , to this order it holds @xmath99 .",
    "that is , the gor relation is broken at finite temperature to nlo by the same @xmath65 terms , given in @xcite .",
    "gor holds to nlo only in the chiral limit , including temperature effects @xcite .",
    "the constant @xmath100 in eq.([kp ] ) includes both lec contributions and loop functions and the same happens with the wave function renormalization constant @xmath101 .",
    "both are divergent , but the combination @xmath102 turns out to be finite and scale - independent . note that if we replace @xmath103 in the last term in eq.([kp ] ) , which is allowed at this order since @xmath104 is of nlo , that combination is precisely the one multiplying the nlo propagator , i.e , it is the @xmath0-dependent residue at the @xmath105 pole ( when the euclidean propagator is analytically continued to the retarded one ) . that finite residue , being finite , has to be then a combination of the finite observables involved .",
    "actually , it happens to be :    @xmath106    thus , the expression in eq.([residue ] ) represents the residue of the nlo @xmath67 correlator ( [ kp ] ) at the thermal pion pole .",
    "note that by showing explicitly that the residue can be expressed as ( [ residue ] ) we obtain that the thermal part of the pseudoscalar susceptibility @xmath5 is the same as that in @xmath107 , since @xmath108 , so that    @xmath109    now , since @xmath110 , at the nlo order we are working , we can replace in eq.([kpcond ] ) @xmath111 so that we get @xmath112 .",
    "furthermore , the constant @xmath92 appearing in eq.([kp ] ) contains precisely the lec combination that combines with that in the residue ( [ residue ] ) to give the same scaling law , now including the @xmath65 part .",
    "thus , our final result for the pseudoscalar susceptibility in chpt to nlo ( finite and scale - independent ) is :    @xmath113+{{\\cal o}}(f^{-2 } ) = -\\frac{{\\langle \\bar q q \\rangle_t}^{chpt}}{m_q}+{{\\cal o}}(f^{-2 } ) , \\label{chipchpt}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where the first term inside brackets is the lo current - algebra @xmath114 and @xmath115 , @xmath116 are renormalized scale - independent lec @xcite .",
    "therefore , we have obtained the wi connecting @xmath68 and @xmath1 to nlo in model - independent chpt , including finite-@xmath0 effects .",
    "furthermore , the @xmath117 dependence cancels in @xmath118 , where only meson parameters show up . to this order ,",
    "@xmath119 so that the lec dependence also disappears . recall that @xmath116 comes from a contact term in @xmath78 and is therefore another source of ambiguity in the nlo condensate @xcite .",
    "note also that , unlike the approach followed in @xcite , we have arrived to the result ( [ chipchpt ] ) without relying on the validity of current algebra , which actually holds only in chpt to the lowest order .",
    "actually , as explained , our result takes into account nlo corrections to @xmath120 through gor breaking terms , both at @xmath65 and @xmath121 , which turn out to be crucial to obtain the correct scaling law given in eq.([chipchpt ] ) .",
    "we can draw some important conclusions from the previous results .",
    "first , @xmath5 scales like the order parameter @xmath68 , instead of the much softer behaviour @xmath122 .",
    "this scaling suggests a chiral - restoring nature for the pseudoscalar susceptibility , although we can not draw any definitive conclusion about chiral restoration just from our standard chpt analysis , which makes sense only at low @xmath0 .",
    "its behaviour for higher @xmath0 approaching the transition should be considered merely as indicative extrapolations , pretty much in the same way as the chpt prediction for the vanishing point of the quark condensate is just a qualitative indication that the restoring behaviour goes in the right direction .",
    "for this reason , in the following we will complement our standard chpt calculation with a direct lattice data analysis , and later on with a unitarized study which , as we will see , incorporates the relevant degrees of freedom to achieve a more precise description near the transition point .",
    "one can actually observe a clear signal of a critical chiral - restoring behaviour for @xmath1 , consistent with our previous chpt result , in the lattice analysis of euclidean correlators , which determine their large - distance space - like screening mass @xmath123 in different channels @xcite . from eq.([chipdef ] ) we expect @xmath124 with @xmath125 the pole mass associated to @xmath126 in a general parametrization of the form @xmath127 with @xmath128 @xcite . here",
    ", @xmath129 would correspond to the thermal euclidean propagator and @xmath130 to the retarded minkowski one setting the dispersion relation . assuming a soft temperature behaviour for @xmath131 , which is plausible below @xmath55 ( for instance , @xmath132 for the nlo chpt propagator in eq.([nloprop ] ) ) we",
    "can then explain the sudden increase of @xmath133 observed in this channel @xcite since we expect that ratio to scale like @xmath134^{1/2}\\sim \\left[{\\langle \\bar q q \\rangle}_0/{\\langle \\bar",
    "q q \\rangle_t}\\right]^{1/2}$ ] .",
    "we show in fig.[figlat ] ( left panel ) these two quantities .",
    "the correlation between them is notorious , given the uncertainties involved , and the mentioned increase is clearly observed .",
    "data are taken from the same lattice group and under the same lattice conditions @xcite .",
    "note that in lattice works @xmath135 is subtracted from @xmath136 in order to avoid renormalization ambiguities . estimating the @xmath65 condensates from nlo chpt , , due to the vanishing of the lo , than in @xmath1 , @xmath68 . ]",
    "this subtraction gives a 6% correction and , from the lattice values , it is about a 15% correction near @xmath55 .",
    "apart from the screening versus pole mass and the strange condensate corrections , one should not forget about the typical lattice uncertainties , like resolution , choice of action , staggered taste breaking and large pion masses @xcite .    , where @xmath137 with @xmath138 , for the lattice data in @xcite ( masses ) and @xcite ( condensate ) with the same lattice action and resolution and @xmath139 mev .",

    ", this behaviour is observed in lattice data . in fig.[figlat ] ( right panel ) we plot the subtracted condensate , expected to scale as @xmath142 according to our previous chpt and lattice analysis , versus @xmath143 , both from the lattice analysis in @xcite .",
    "the @xmath65 values are taken from chpt .",
    "the current degeneration is evident , not only at the critical point but also above it , where those two quantities remain very close to one another .",
    "recall that both the analysis of the correlation between screening masses and inverse rooted condensate and that of scalar versus pseudoscalar ( condensate ) susceptibilities , although elaborated from available lattice data , has not been presented before , to the best of our knowledge .",
    "as commented above , this analysis has been motivated by our chpt results in section ii and it gives strong support to the scalar - pseudoscalar degeneration pattern at the transition , as well as providing a natural explanation for the behaviour of lattice masses in this channel .",
    "since the scalar susceptibility is dominated by the @xmath23 lightest state , which does not show up in the chpt expansion , let us consider its unitarized extension given by the inverse amplitude method ( iam ) @xcite which generates dynamically in @xmath25 the @xmath24 and @xmath145 resonances and has been extended to finite temperature in @xcite .",
    "thus , before proceeding to derive the unitarized susceptibility in section [ sec : unisus ] , let us review briefly here , for the sake of completeness , some of the more relevant aspects of the thermal iam , particularly in the scalar channel .",
    "we refer to @xcite for a more detailed analysis .",

    "the @xmath0-dependent corrections to the scattering amplitude comes from the internal loop matsubara sums in the imaginary - time formalism of thermal field theory .",
    "the external pion lines correspond to asymptotic @xmath65 states .",
    "the thermal amplitude is defined after the application of the @xmath65 lsz reduction formula , which allows to deal just with thermal green functions .",
    "after the matsubara sums are evaluated , the external lines are analytically continued to real frequencies .",
    "the full result for the thermal amplitude to nlo in chpt is given in @xcite .",
    "the scattering amplitude can be projected into partial waves @xmath146 in the reference frame @xmath147 where the incoming pions 1,2 are at rest with the thermal bath , so that @xmath148 .",
    "the nlo partial waves have the generic form ( we drop in the following the @xmath149 indices for brevity ) @xmath150 where @xmath151 is the @xmath152 tree - level @xmath0-independent scattering amplitude from @xmath75 and @xmath153 is @xmath154 including the tree level from @xmath78 plus the one - loop from the diagrams in fig.[figfeyn ] .",

    "actually , @xmath177 decreases very slightly with @xmath0 for the relevant temperature range .",
    "hence , the @xmath0-dependent contribution of the real part of @xmath173 is almost negligible compared to its @xmath65 part , due to the large @xmath20 mass value .",
    "the latter gives roughly the @xmath65 rho mass , so the real part of the denominator of @xmath178 behaves dominantly as @xmath179 . in particular ,",
    "the tadpole contributions of diagrams ( d ) , ( e ) in fig.[figfeyn ] are suppressed in this channel typically by @xmath180 .",
    "however , the thermal effect in @xmath181 is much more sizable , increasing with @xmath0 .",
    "its dominant contribution comes from the imaginary part of the amplitude .",
    "the imaginary part of the @xmath178 denominator at the pole behaves like @xmath182 and , up to @xmath183 100 mev @xmath184 , which for @xmath185 near the real axis comes essentially from diagram ( a ) in fig.[figfeyn ] ( which would give the only imaginary part for real @xmath156 ) so the broadening can be explained just by thermal phase space increase up to that temperature . note that , although this effect is formally @xmath186 , it activates below the transition because of the relative small value of @xmath187 . above that",
    ", there is an additional increase of the effective @xmath188 coupling with @xmath0 @xcite , to which tadpoles contribute , which explains a further increase of the width .",
    "this behaviour is represented in figure [ figpoles ] .",
    "observe the softer behaviour of the mass as compared to the width in this channel , and the correlation with the real and imaginary parts of the amplitude at the pole position .    in the scalar - isoscalar channel ,",
    "the one we are interested in here , the behavior is remarkably different .",
    "we rather talk of a broad resonance pole , since @xmath175 and @xmath176 are comparable , so that the @xmath24 pole is away from the real axis .",
    "as a consequence , all thermal contributions from diagrams ( a)-(e ) in fig.[figfeyn ] to @xmath173 become complex at the pole and the real and imaginary parts of the pole equations do not have the simple form of a bw resonance .",
    "in addition , due to the lower value of @xmath189 as compared to the @xmath20 case , the thermal dependence is much more stronger , both for the real and imaginary parts , and all contributions from those diagrams become equally relevant . in particular , the tadpoles in diagrams ( d ) , ( e ) in fig.[figfeyn ] now come into play .",
    "the numerical solution of the pole equations show that @xmath177 in this channel decreases significatively , while @xmath190 increases up to @xmath183 120 mev and decreases from that point onwards , as seen in fig.[figpoles ] .",
    "note that this non - monotonic behaviour for @xmath176 can not be explained now just in terms of phase space or vertex increasing . on the other hand ,",
    "a possible interpretation of the decreasing @xmath191 is a chiral restoring behaviour . actually , in fig.[figpoles ] ( a ) we also represent @xmath192 , which would correspond to the self - energy real part of a scalar particle with energy squared @xmath162 and @xmath193 , exchanged between the incoming and outgoing pions .",
    "this @xmath18-like squared mass not only drops faster but it develops a minimum at a certain temperature , which as we will see below corresponds to a maximum in the scalar susceptibility . in the @xmath20 channel",
    ", there is almost no numerical difference between @xmath191 and @xmath194 .",
    "thus , a qualitative explanation for the @xmath190 change from a increasing to a decreasing behaviour in the scalar channel would be the influence of the strong mass decreasing of the decaying state .      in order to establish a connection between the scalar susceptibility and the scalar pole , we construct a unitarized susceptibility by saturating the scalar propagator with the @xmath24 thermal state and assuming that its @xmath195 mass does not vary much with respect to the pole mass .",
    "thus , we identify the pole of a scalar state exchanged in pion scattering with the thermal pole in the scalar channel discussed in the previous section .",
    "therefore , we have : @xmath196 where we have normalized to the @xmath65 chpt value , since we are demanding that all our @xmath65 results match the model - independent chpt predictions .",
    "this normalization compensates partly the difference between the @xmath195 and pole masses . under this approximation ,",
    "the self - energy real part is the squared scalar mass @xmath197 , as discussed in the previous section , and the self - energy imaginary part vanishes at @xmath195 .",
    "the quark condensate can not be extracted directly from the unitarized susceptibility .",
    "however , we can obtain an approximate description by assuming that the relevant temperature and mass dependence , as far as the critical behaviour is concerned , comes from pion loop functions as @xmath198 and @xmath199 , with @xmath200 .",
    "this @xmath201 dependence holds actually to nlo chpt , as in eq.([g1 ] ) .",
    "then , from eq.([chisdef ] ) , since @xmath202 , we get @xmath203 with @xmath204 a suitable low-@xmath0 scale below which we use directly nlo chpt , which has a better analytic behaviour near @xmath65 .",
    "the @xmath205 function is obtained from the @xmath0 dependence of @xmath2 in eq.([susunit ] ) .",
    "our theoretical results based on effective theories are plotted in fig.[figsusc ] .",
    "first , chpt to nlo gives an increasing @xmath4 , intersecting @xmath5 at @xmath206 , where @xmath207 .",
    "once again , this result should be considered just as an extrapolation of the model - independent expressions for @xmath4 and @xmath5 beyond their low-@xmath0 applicability range . with this caution in mind ,",
    "standard chpt supports the idea of partner degeneration . actually , near the chiral limit @xmath208 , where critical effects are meant to be enhanced , the degeneration point @xmath209 , approaching the chiral restoration temperature in that limit .",
    "( right).,width=377 ]    we also plot @xmath210 in fig.[figsusc ] .",
    "the result agrees with standard chpt at low @xmath0 and improves remarkably the behaviour near the transition .",
    "it actually develops a maximum at @xmath211 157 mev .",
    "we show for comparison the lattice data of @xcite .",
    "furthermore , approaching the chiral limit by taking the @xmath212 mev poles from @xcite gives a vanishing @xmath213 at @xmath211 118 mev and hence a divergent @xmath214 from eq.([susunit ] ) at @xmath55 .",
    "thus , we get , at least qualitatively , the @xmath55 reduction and stronger @xmath2 growth near the chiral limit expected from theoretical @xcite and lattice @xcite analysis . the clear improvement of the unitarized approach with respect to the standard chpt one for the scalar susceptibility is essentially due to the introduction of the thermal @xmath24 state , whose importance in this case is clearly seen from the dependence @xmath215 , rather than to an enlargement of the applicability range in the unitarized approach .",
    "actually , even within the unitarized description , we should be cautious when extrapolating it to near @xmath55 since we may be strictly beyond the effective theory range .",
    "the resulting @xmath216 is plotted in fig.[figsusc ] with @xmath217 12 mev . between 10 - 60 mev . ]",
    "the critical behaviour is again nicely improved compared to the chpt curves and is in better agreement with lattice data in that region .",
    "in addition , we obtain once more a scalar - pseudoscalar intersection near the @xmath2 peak and hence of chiral restoration .",
    "the corresponding @xmath216 near the chiral limit ( @xmath212 mev ) is much more abrupt , vanishing and meeting @xmath2 at @xmath55 as expected .",
    "recall that in the above unitarized analysis , we are not performing a fit to lattice points .",
    "we just use the same lec which generate the @xmath65 physical @xmath24 , @xmath20 states @xcite and then provide our results for the susceptibility and condensate .",
    "the theoretical uncertainties in the lec , as well as the lattice errors already discussed should be taken into account for a more precise comparison .",
    "besides , our effective theory analysis is not expected to reproduce the chiral restoration pattern above @xmath55 . in any case , apart from the important consistency obtained for chiral restoration properties , such as the @xmath2 peak and the @xmath218 matching , an important point we want to stress is the crucial role of the @xmath219 state to describe the scalar susceptibility . since @xmath215 , this observable is much more sensitive to this broad state , so that a physically realistic description , including its thermal effects , turns out to be essential . this may not be the case for other thermodynamical observables , for which other approaches may provide a much better description .",
    "for instance , the hadron resonance gas ( hrg ) framework gives very accurate results compared to lattice data @xcite and particle distributions @xcite below the transition , by including all known hadronic states as free particles in the partition function , often including small interaction corrections . within the hrg approach ,",
    "hadron interactions are generically encoded in the resonant states .",
    "this framework works for most thermodynamic quantities , which are obtained , by construction , as monotonic functions of @xmath0 , and generally increase with the mass of the states considered .",
    "for instance , the scalar susceptibility within that approach would increase with @xmath0 , as it happens for other quantities such as the trace anomaly .",
    "thus , the effect of a properly included broad @xmath18 @xmath0-dependent state arising from pion scattering in order to describe chiral restoring properties such as the susceptibility peak , is once more highlighted .",
    "in fact , the @xmath18 state is just not included in many hrg works @xcite or , at most , considered as a bw state @xcite with its @xmath65 mass and width , which , as we have commented above , does not provide an entirely adequate description .",
    "finally , let us comment that apart from higher mass states , inclusion of higher order interactions may also be important for certain hadronic observables .",
    "for instance , including @xmath220 interactions in the vector channel are essential to describe properly the dilepton spectra @xcite .",
    "summarizing , we have analyzed the scalar - pseudoscalar @xmath3-like current degeneration pattern at chiral symmetry restoration , from lattice simulations and effective theory analysis .",
    "the pseudoscalar susceptibility scales as the quark condensate , which we have explicitly shown in chpt to nlo at low temperature , and becomes degenerate with its  chiral partner \" scalar susceptibility close to the scalar transition peak .",
    "the lattice data and the unitarized chpt analysis support this picture and are well accounted for by the dominant physical states : pions and the @xmath24 scalar resonance generated in pion scattering at finite temperature . in turn , we have provided a natural explanation for the sudden growth of lattice masses observed in the pseudoscalar channel . although we have restricted here , for simplicity , to the @xmath16 case , the analysis can be extended to @xmath221 , where the role of other scalar states such as the @xmath222 can also be studied @xcite .",
