    "since their discovery in 1963 by muller , oort , & raimond , the nature of the high  velocity hydrogen clouds ( hvcs ) has remained a mystery .",
    "hvcs are clouds that deviate from galactic circular rotation by as much as several hundred kilometers per second .",
    "although astronomers have speculated about the origin of hvcs since their detection , no single explanation has encompassed the vast quantity of data that has been collected on the clouds ( see wakker & van woerden 1997 , hereafter wvw97 , and references therein ) . particularly important is the lack of agreement on a characteristic distance for the clouds , because most of the relevant physical parameters depend on distance to one order or another . in the 1970s ,",
    "a well  defined subset of the clouds was identified as a tidal stream associated with the magellanic clouds ( mathewson , cleary , & murray 1974 ) , but since then no consensus has arisen regarding the nature of the remaining clouds which constitute the majority of hvcs .    in this paper , we suggest that the hvcs represent infall of the intergalactic medium onto the local group .",
    "previous authors have explored the possibility that the hvcs are infalling primordial gas ( oort 1966 , 1970 ) and have associated the hvcs with the local group ( verschuur 1969 ; kerr & sullivan 1969 ; arp 1985 ; bajaja , morras , & pppel 1987 ; arp & sulentic 1991 ) , but subsequent observations always produced fundamental difficulties for the particular models considered . here , we assemble evidence based on new general  purpose surveys of atomic hydrogen gas by stark et al .",
    "( 1992 ) and by hartmann & burton ( 1997 ) , and on the hvc surveys by hulsbosch & wakker ( 1988 ) and by bajaja et al .",
    "( 1985 ) , and consider theoretical arguments in the context of modern cosmology .",
    "we argue that the clouds are matter accreting onto the local group of galaxies .",
    "their velocities would thus largely reflect the motion of the clouds in the gravitational potential of the local group and the motion of the lsr about the galactic center .",
    "we suggest that the clouds represent the building blocks from which the local group was assembled and that they continue to fuel star formation in the disk of the milky way .",
    "the evidence is presented as follows . in section 2",
    ", we review some of the observed properties of the high  velocity clouds , and indicate those which are not consistent with a galactic origin for the hvcs . in section 3 , we detail the observations entering our analysis . in section 4 , we discuss the stability of the hvcs against gravitational collapse and against galactic tidal forces , and suggest that these considerations imply that the most of the clouds are extragalactic at distances typical of the local group .",
    "the stability criteria imply , however , that the largest clouds are nearby and possibly are interacting with the milky way . in section 5 ,",
    "we discuss three individual clouds , one of which must be beyond the disk of the milky way , and two others that appear to be associated with m31 and m33 , suggesting that at least some of the hvcs may be extragalactic .",
    "we identify a subset of the hvcs centered near the barycenter of the local group , and show that its kinematics as well as that of the entire hvc ensemble are well described as being at rest with respect to the local  group standard of rest ( lgsr ) ; the kinematics are thus inconsistent with a galactic origin .",
    "the entire hvc ensemble is also shown to exhibit an angular  size / velocity relation consistent with membership in the local group . in section 6 ,",
    "we simulate the accretion history of the local group and show that the simulation accounts for the observed distribution and kinematics of the hvc ensemble .",
    "the agreement between the simulation and the observations supports inferences about similarities between the local group hvcs and the ly@xmath13 absorbing clouds observed toward quasars .",
    "we show that the velocity extrema observed for the hvcs are consistent with their membership in the local group . in section 7",
    ", we discuss the distances and abundances of the hvcs in the context of the local group hvc hypothesis , and show that the hypothesis is consistent with all of the observations made to date .",
    "we review extragalactic hi searches for hvcs which have revealed clouds with properties similar to those we derive , in about the expected numbers . in section 8 ,",
    "we discuss the implied mass accretion rate , and implications for the chemical evolution of the disk of the the milky way .",
    "we also present evidence for the galactic fountain in low ",
    "velocity hi which suggests that the hi disk of the milky way is not in hydrostatic equilibrium . in section 9 ,",
    "we conclude by discussing predictions and future tests of the model , and summarize the principal arguments made in this paper .",
    "hvcs are hi clouds with radial velocities inconsistent with circular or near  circular rotation about the galactic center , and in this and other regards unlike most of the hi making up the galactic disk .",
    "perhaps the most useful kinematic definition is that of the `` deviation velocity '' introduced by wakker ( 1991 ) , indicating the degree to which a cloud deviates from a reasonable circular  rotation model .",
    "we note the following general properties of hvcs other than those which are part of the magellanic stream ( see wvw97 for a thorough review ) :    \\(1 ) hvcs have lsr radial velocities as extreme as @xmath14 .",
    "the most extreme radial velocity consistent with circular rotation is about @xmath15 .",
    "\\(2 ) hvcs have both positive and negative radial velocities , but clouds with positive radial velocities are distributed differently on the sky than clouds with negative velocities .",
    "\\(3 ) two hvc complexes ( the magellanic stream and complex c ) are contiguous structures covering thousands of square degrees on the sky .",
    "most hvcs , however , have angular extents of a few square degrees or less .",
    "individual clouds separated by several or tens of degrees are often separated in velocity by hundreds of kilometers per second . except for the magellanic stream ,",
    "the largest cloud complexes tend to lie at positive latitudes in the first and second galactic quadrants ; these include the well known complexes a , c , and m , which have received the most observational attention .",
    "we refer to these clouds as the northern hemisphere clouds and find them to be the nearest examples of the hvc phenomenon ( see  [ sec : bighvcs ] .",
    "\\(4 ) hvcs have a narrow range of internal velocity dispersions , centered near 13 ( see section 4 ) .",
    "\\(5 ) hvcs have low dust  to  gas ratios , at least a factor of three below that of normal galactic clouds ( wakker & boulanger 1986 ) .",
    "\\(6 ) measured heavy ",
    "element abundances are all well below solar values .",
    "although few metallicities are available , those measured are also significantly subsolar .",
    "\\(7 ) distance measurements to the clouds have been largely indeterminate , although several recent observations in the direction of northern hemisphere clouds suggest a distance of about 5 kpc for complex a ( van woerden et al . 1998 ) as well as for complex m ( danly , albert , & kuntz 1993 ) .    clearly , any explanation of the nature and origin of the hvcs must account for these observed properties .",
    "previous explanations fall into two broad categories : galactic and extragalactic . in the first general discussion of the nature of the hvcs , oort ( 1966 )",
    "realized that if the clouds are self ",
    "gravitating then they must have distances on the order of a mpc .",
    "in galactic models , of which the most popular is the galactic fountain ( shapiro & field 1976 ; bregman 1980 ) , the hvcs would be too near to be bound by their own gravity and , because of their large internal velocity dispersions , would be transient objects with typical lifetimes @xmath16 y. it is difficult to understand in the galactic fountain context why the clouds would not be metal rich or how their vertical velocities would be greater than 70 to 100 .",
    "extragalactic models , on the other hand , generally require hvcs to be gravitationally stable for periods comparable to a hubble time , and to be metal poor ( though not necessarily with zero metallicity ) .",
    "our analysis relies principally on the catalogue of hvcs compiled by wakker & van woerden ( 1991 , hereafter wvw91 ) and on the new leiden / dwingeloo survey of hi of hartmann & burton ( 1997 , hereafter ld ) .",
    "the wvw91 compilation is based largely on data from the hi survey of hulsbosch & wakker ( 1988 ) , made with the dwingeloo 25m telescope over the northern sky at 1intervals covering lsr velocities from @xmath17 to @xmath18 with a velocity resolution of 8.25 , together with data from the hi survey of bajaja et al .",
    "( 1985 ) , made with the villa elisa 100foot telescope over declinations only accessible from the southern hemisphere , at somewhat coarser resolution and somewhat lower sensitivity .",
    "the wakker & van woerden catalogue also includes data from a number of other observational programs covering specific hvcs in enhanced detail .",
    "the leiden / dwingeloo hi survey of hartmann & burton ( 1997 ) utilized the dwingeloo 25m telescope to observe the sky at declinations north of @xmath19 , at the relatively high resolutions of 05 in angle and 1 in velocity , covering the velocity range @xmath20 .",
    "although the velocity coverage of the ld survey is less than that of wvw91 , few hvcs have been found beyond the negative  velocity range of the ld survey , and none beyond the positive  velocity edge .",
    "the sidelobe response has been removed from the ld data by subtracting , from each spectrum , the simulated sidelobe response of a modeled telescope antenna to a full  sky hi map ( hartmann 1994 ; hartmann et al .",
    "although the survey was motivated by problems pertaining to the milky way , it is useful for some hvc studies too .",
    "when smoothed to the resolution of the hulsbosch & wakker data , the sensitivity of the ld data is similar ; its superior spatial and velocity resolution makes it particularly useful for obtaining observational parameters of some of the hvcs .",
    "the ld survey has not , however , been analyzed for high  velocity emission in the detail of wvw91 .",
    "we also utilize the bell telephone laboratories hi survey of stark et al .",
    "( 1992 , hereafter btl ) , which was the first northern hemisphere hi sky survey with full beamwidth sampling and low sidelobe response .",
    "although the rather coarse ( 2 ) angular resolution is not particularly well  suited to investigations of most hvcs , the velocity resolution of 5 is not a disadvantage in global hvc studies because most hvc lines are considerably broader than this .",
    "the btl and ld surveys have similar noise levels when convolved to the same resolution .",
    "although possible sidelobe contamination is not particularly worrisome for hi features with velocities beyond those of conventional galactic emission , low sidelobe response is useful for studying those hvcs seen at high galactic latitudes within the velocity range of galactic plane hi .",
    "we checked the reality of weak features by making cross comparisons between the btl and ld surveys .",
    "we begin our analysis by calculating the characteristic self - gravitating distances for the hvcs . as mentioned above , oort ( 1966 ) noted that self - gravitating hvcs imply that the hvcs are at a distance of @xmath21 mpc .",
    "giovanelli ( 1979 ) , using better hi data , argued that the virial distances would place many hvcs outside the local group . here , we revisit the calculation with new data and include the presence of dark matter in our analysis .",
    "if the hvcs are objects nearly as old as the universe , they must be gravitationally and tidally stable for a hubble time . a self  gravitating",
    "cloud obeys the relationship    @xmath22    where @xmath23 is the mass in neutral hydrogen , @xmath24 is the hydrogen / total mass ratio , and @xmath25 is the gravitational radius of the cloud . because hvcs are not sites of star formation nor has co ever been found associated with them ( wakker et al .",
    "1997 ) , the inequality in equation ( 1 ) is reversed for hvcs . the equation can therefore be used to estimate an upper limit to the distance of an hvc , assuming that it is self  gravitating :    @xmath26    where @xmath27 is the observed fwhm of the hi emission from a cloud , measured in , @xmath28 is the peak hi brightness temperature , measured in k , and @xmath29 is the solid angle projected by the cloud in square degrees ; the coefficient includes a 40% correction by mass for helium .",
    "stable clouds must also be able to withstand the shear of the galactic tidal field ; this consideration yields a lower limit to the distance of an hvc :    @xmath30    this implies , in terms of observables :    @xmath31    where @xmath32 is the distance to the cloud and @xmath33 is the circular speed of the galaxy at the distance of an hvc . if one assumes that @xmath34 for @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is the distance where the rotation curve becomes keplerian , and that @xmath37 for @xmath38 , then for @xmath36 = 100 kpc , equation ( 4 ) becomes    @xmath39    for @xmath40 100 kpc , and where equation ( 4 ) holds for @xmath41 100 kpc . for @xmath42 ,",
    "only the gravitational distance is important , because clouds that are not gravitationally stable are also not tidally stable .    if @xmath24 is sufficiently small that either dark matter or ionized gas dominates the mass of an individual hvc , that is , if the mass of the cloud is given by @xmath43 independent of its distance , then the tidal criterion becomes a criterion on the angular size of an hvc :    @xmath44    for @xmath45 100 kpc , and    @xmath46    for @xmath47 100 kpc , assuming a rotation curve flat to 100 kpc .",
    "an additional useful relation is the crossing time , @xmath48 , for the cloud , defined as the timescale for which a cloud would double in size if it were not self gravitating :    @xmath49    where @xmath50 is the distance to the cloud in kpc .",
    "we first consider the statistics of the clouds to determine mean observational quantities , @xmath28 , @xmath51 , and @xmath27 .",
    "we use the wvw91 compilation because of the better spatial resolution compared to the btl catalogue .",
    "however , the line width is not explicitly given and must be estimated from the total flux and @xmath52 .",
    "histograms of these quantities are given in figure  [ fig:3wakker ] .",
    "the statistical properties are given in table 1 .",
    "we have checked the distribution of these quantities with the btl compilation and find good agreement between the two catalogues given their differences between them .",

    "if @xmath67 and the clouds were self - gravitating at this distance , they would , on average , be part of the hubble flow , they would not exhibit the velocity cutoff described in  [ sec : extrema ] , and they would also not exhibit the overwhelmingly negative observed velocities relative to the lgsr .",
    "a mean distance of 6@xmath24 mpc is also an order of magnitude larger than the distance to m31 for values of @xmath24 near unity , and much larger than the 1.5 mpc radius at which the clouds are turned around from the hubble flow in the simulations ( see figure  [ fig : arrowc ] ) .",
    "if the hvcs are extragalactic , we expect that they contain copious amounts of dark matter . observations of galaxies and cluters suggest that the baryon / dark matter ratio is roughly 0.1 ( fukugita , hogan , & peebles 1997 ) . if hvcs are fair samples of material from which galaxies are made",
    ", then we expect that @xmath68 .",
    "this implies that their true distance is @xmath69 0.5 - 1.0 mpc .",
    "using the mean cloud values , at a typical distance of 1 mpc the typical diameter of an hvc is about 28 kpc , a large value , but comparable to the value we obtain for complex h in  [ sec : hulsbosch ] . at a distance of 1 mpc ,",
    "the hvcs have a typical neutral hydrogen mass of @xmath70 , a value close to the hi mass of complex h , a total neutral gas mass of @xmath71 , and a total mass of @xmath72 .",
    "the mean hi density ( @xmath73 ) of a typical cloud is then @xmath74 .",
    "a mean density this small might require some clumpiness for the cloud to remain neutral even in the metagalactic radiation field ( see   [ sec : ionization ] ) .",
    "the typical derived hvc properties are summarized in table 3 .",
    "although for most hvcs the tidal  stability distance is less than the self  gravitating distance , the opposite is the case for the largest hvcs .",
    "furthermore , for these largest hvcs , the conditions imposed by equations ( 6 ) and ( 7 ) are so severe that all clouds with angular sizes greater than about 100 sq deg can not be tidally stable at any reasonable distance . equation ( 7 ) can be rewritten , for example , as @xmath75 where @xmath76 is the linewidth measured in units of 20 ; figure  [ fig:3wakker ] shows that this quantity is generally of order unity . thus any cloud with an angular size @xmath77",
    "60 sq deg will be tidally unstable for any distance @xmath78 2 mpc .",
    "complexes a , c , and m , the three main structures comprising the northern hemisphere grouping , are all larger than this : complex c , for example , covers 1814 sq deg .",
    "all three of these complexes in the northern hemisphere grouping therefore are tidally unstable for any reasonable distance if they are self - gravitating",
    ". the gravitational  binding distance , @xmath55 , is moreover quite small for the largest clouds . for complex a , which has a mean @xmath27 of @xmath7940 , and a mean @xmath28 of 1.0 k , @xmath80 kpc .",
    "that is , this cloud can not be more than 85 kpc distant even if it is self  gravitating by its gas content alone ( @xmath67 ) ; if it contains substantial amounts of ionized gas or dark matter , it is probably substantially closer than 85 kpc . for values of @xmath24 in the range 0.1 to 0.2 ,",
    "complex a would have a maximum distance of @xmath81 to 15 kpc . if complexes c and m , together with a , are all part of a single general grouping , then this distance would be consistent with the two measured absorption ",
    "line distances to the hvcs by danly et al .",
    "( 1993 ) and by van woerden et al .",
    "this distance is also consistent with the large total angular extent of this structure , nearly 180 .",
    "if the mean diameter typical of hvcs is about 28 kpc , and if this structure is a typical hvc , then its distance would be @xmath82 kpc , since it subtends more than 2 radians .",
    "we conclude then that the northern hemisphere complex probably has a mean distance of @xmath79 10 to 15 kpc , an extent of @xmath79 25 kpc , is being tidally sheared , and traverses a range of distances from the sun , including some which are evidently as near as several kpc .",
    "these considerations suggest that the hvc complexes a , c , and m , which have been the most studied of the hvcs because of their large angular extent and location at declinations accessible from northern hemisphere telescopes , are atypical because they are so close ; moreover they appear to be interacting with the milky way .",
    "the proximity to these clouds might also explain why distance determinations to the northern hemisphere grouping have been so discrepant , with most absorption  line measurements giving only upper limits : the material is probably strung out over a large range of distances because of its intrinsic size and the tidal shearing .",
    "there are two other complexes with angular sizes in excess of 1000 sq deg : the outer arm complex and the magellanic stream .",
    "the tidal and gravitational binding considerations discussed above apply equally well to these complexes if they are self  gravitating . in the case of the outer arm , it is not clear whether it is really a collection of hvcs , or part of the normal structure and dynamics of the outermost milky way . in any event , it must be tidally unstable if it is self  gravitating , and both it and the magellanic stream have self - gravitating distances @xmath78 100 kpc , possibly considerably less than this .",
    "it might even be that the magellanic stream is not gas tidally disrupted from either the milky way or the lmc , but rather an hvc that has become entrained in the tidal field of the lmc / milky way system .    for clouds with angular sizes between @xmath79 100 and 1000 sq deg ,",
    "the gravitational binding distance is greater than that for the three largest clouds complexes , and such clouds would be expected to be more distant than complex a. complex h , which we discuss in detail in ",
    "[ sec : features ] has @xmath51 = 250 sq deg , @xmath55 = 580 @xmath24 kpc , and @xmath56 = 190 @xmath61 kpc .",
    "if complex h is typical of other hvcs , and @xmath24 is about 0.1 , then @xmath83 = 60 kpc , and its distance would be close to the value of 50 kpc value determined from kinematic considerations in  [ sec : hulsbosch ] .",
    "it seems , therefore , that the stability argument yields some information about distances , and that this information is consistent both with direct distance measurements , in the case of the nearby northern hemisphere clouds , with inferences from the kinematics in the case of complex h , and with cloud properties statistically inferred from numerical simulations .",
    "we consider here three individual clouds seen in the second quadrant of galactic longitude which suggest that at least some of the hvcs must be extragalactic .",
    "longitude  velocity plots of hi lying near the galactic equator show that most of the gas in the milky way is in nearly ",
    "circular orbits about the galactic center .",
    "figure  [ fig : lvhulsbos ] shows such a plot for ld  survey data over the longitude range @xmath84 , averaged over @xmath85 10 .",
    "negative velocities in the longitude range = 0 180correspond to gas at distances greater than @xmath86 , under the assumption of circular rotation ; near  circular orbits are suggested by the approximately sinusoidal contours of the hi , especially at the lower contour levels .",
    "the most distant gas would contribute the lowest contours , at velocities near 170  sin@xmath10 , corresponding to a distance of about 37 kpc from the galactic center , if @xmath87 220 ( or to a distance of about 27 kpc if the rotation curve were to become keplerian at the last measured point about 20 kpc from the center ) .",
    "gas with rotation velocities in excess of @xmath88 can not be in circular rotation anywhere in the milky way .",
    "for @xmath89 220 , kinematic distances are increased .",
    "[ htpb ]    -0.2 in    figure  [ fig : lvhulsbos ] also shows emission , however , from an hi structure , in the longitude range @xmath90 110to 135 , extending to velocities as high as 240 , well beyond the most extreme circular  rotation speeds permitted .",
    "a map of this hvc material is shown in figure  [ fig : hulsbos ] , which integrates all of the hi emission beyond the range of normal circular velocities , from @xmath91 .",

    "complex h is quite large , with an angular extent of @xmath92 25 .",

    "velocity centroid of the brightest part of the emission is 200 ; if this characterizes the systemic velocity of complex h , and if the higher velocities are due to the velocity dispersion of the hi , the distance from the galactic center would be about 85 kpc for a flat rotation curve ( 43 kpc assuming that the rotation curve becomes keplerian at @xmath93 kpc ) . in any event , complex h is quite large , with an angular extent of about 25and a radial velocity that places it beyond @xmath79 50 kpc from the center , under any reasonable galactic rotation curve .",
    "[ htpb ]    -0.2 in    because complex h lies directly in the plane , it is at a minimum distance of 40 kpc from the galactic center , whether or not its radial velocity corresponds to circular motion .",
    "if the complex were at distances smaller than 40 kpc ( that is , if the velocity of the cloud has a substantial non  circular component ) , then the velocity difference between the complex and the ambient galactic disk gas would range from 30 to 200 , producing a huge region of highly shocked gas .",
    "no major disturbance in the hi images of this part of the disk is apparent , however .",
    "one would also expect strong radio  continuum and x  ray emission , and other indicators of strong shocks , but no such shock tracer is evident over the region . h@xmath13 or other optical emission would be expected at least at the higher latitudes where the extinction is relatively low , because the high velocity of complex h relative to the ambient gas would be comparable to that of the jets from young stars , which are all strong optical emitters ( lada 1985 ) .",
    "there is no indication that the emission from the disk is anomalous , supporting the conclusion that the complex lies beyond the gaseous disk of the milky way .",
    "the large angular size of complex h implies that , if it is at a distance of 50 kpc from the sun , then it has a diameter of about 20 kpc and an hi mass of about 9@xmath64 , using the total hi flux seen in figure  [ fig : hulsbos ] , an enormous gas structure by galactic standards ; the mass would scale with the square of the distance . using equation ( 2 ) of  4",
    ", the distance of the cloud would be 1.0  @xmath24 mpc if it were self  gravitating , where @xmath24 is the ratio of neutral gas / total mass of the structure .",
    "thus @xmath24 would have to be @xmath79 0.1 if complex h were self gravitating , a value similar to that deduced in  4.1 for the ensemble of hvcs .      the argument supporting a large distance for complex h",
    "is more difficult to apply to hvcs located out of the galactic plane .",
    "the constraint that complex h lies beyond the outer edge of the gaseous disk is not applicable to most hvcs because they are largely identified out of the galactic plane .",
    "for example , another hvc with a substantial deviation velocity is seen in figure  [ fig : lvhulsbos ] near @xmath94 , @xmath95 ; this is the aci knot in the anticenter complex , most of which extends beyond the borders of figure  [ fig : lvhulsbos ] .",
    "the aci concentration is centered only about 10below the galactic plane and , as complex h , shows no association with any disturbance in the conventional gaseous disk .",
    "however , because it does not lie directly in the galactic plane , the constraint on the distance to the aci knot is weaker than for complex h.    there have been several suggestions of evidence for interactions of hvc material with the conventional gaseous disk in some of the northern  hemisphere clouds which were argued in  [ sec : bighvcs ] to be relatively local , but none for the hvcs which we argue are dispersed throughout the local group (  [ sec : lgkinematics ] ) .",
    "burton ( 1997 ) discussed two general observational constraints on the distances of high and intermediate ",
    "velocity clouds .",
    "the  scale  height constraint \" recognizes the measured half ",
    "thickness of the hi gaseous disk , which is well  established by the observations to be about 120 pc ; if hvcs were a general property of the disk  halo transition region , they would have to be confined to @xmath96 pc to be consistent with the measured thickness ; otherwise , hvcs would have to occur beyond the disk  halo interface , typically at large enough distances that their existence does not contaminate the scale  height measurement .",
    "the bright emission feature evident in figure  [ fig : hulsbos ] at @xmath97 represents hi in the disk of m31 .",
    "could it be that complex h is part of a tidal tail extending toward andromeda ?",
    "we used the btl and ld surveys to map the hi emission in the general region around m31 , but found no hvc feature continuous or nearly continuous in position and velocity comparable to the magellanic stream .",
    "we did , however , find the remarkable hi halo seen in figure  [ fig : m31 ] as it appears in the ld survey , approximately centered on m31 , which we discuss below as the m31 cloud . in this figure ,",
    "m31 itself is the bright spot in the central region of the cloud , some 2 in extent ; m33 is the bright feature at @xmath98 , @xmath99 .",
    "the gaseous disk of the milky way contributes the emission along the top edge of the figure .",
    "the m31 cloud is also seen in the btl survey and a small portion of it occurs in the wvw91 catalogue .",
    "-0.2 in    the extent of the emission surrounding the direction to m31 is about 14 .",
    "if the m31 cloud were at the distance of m31 , its diameter would be about 170 kpc and its mass about @xmath100 . the velocity extent of the cloud is 145 @xmath101 ; it is therefore not centered on the systemic velocity of m31 ( @xmath102 ) , but emission from the cloud does blend with the lower  absolute  velocity side of m31 .",
    "the apparent blending may , however , be fortuitous : there is no direct evidence for an interaction between the hi cloud and m31 , nor is there direct evidence that the cloud and m31 are at the same distance . because the m31 cloud does not connect smoothly with complex h , either spatially or kinematically",
    ", it appears likely that the m31 cloud and complex h are unrelated .",
    "the positional coincidence of the m31 cloud with m31 is striking , however , as is the blending in velocity . not only",
    "is the m31 cloud nearly centered on m31 itself , its position angle on the sky as well as its inclination ( if the cloud is disk - like ) are both similar to those of m31 .",
    "these morphological similarities make it reasonable to ask if the cloud is somehow associated with the galaxy .",
    "it seems unlikely that the m31 cloud is part of a very extended gaseous disk of m31 , because the cloud has a less extreme systemic velocity than the galaxy proper , and extends well beyond the minor axis on one side of the galaxy , which would not be the case if it were in normal galactic rotation .",
    "furthermore , there is no evidence for the cloud in maps made in the velocities between @xmath103 and @xmath104 , corresponding to velocities from the approaching , southeast part of the m31 disk .",
    "although the m31 cloud is superimposed on m31 on the sky , there is no clear evidence for an _ interaction _ with the galaxy .",
    "nevertheless the location and morphology of the m31 cloud remain striking .",
    "davies ( 1975 ) found a compact hvc in close positional proximity to m31 which he argued is likely to be associated with that galaxy , despite its different velocity .",
    "the davies cloud , with an angular extent of only 05 , is within about 15 of the center of m31 , but has an lsr velocity of @xmath105 , as close to the systemic velocity of the galaxy as the m31 cloud . at the distance of m31",
    ", the davies cloud would have a mass of 4.7 @xmath106  and a diameter of 5 kpc .",
    "close to m33 , wright ( 1974 , 1979 ) found an hvc in the velocity range @xmath107 ; the cloud is shown in figure  [ fig : m33_m31 ] as it appears in the ld survey .",
    "m33 itself is the bright object at @xmath108 , @xmath109 ; wright s cloud is the extended hook  shaped object to the right of , and slightly below , that galaxy .",
    "the detailed maps which wright made of this cloud did not allow him to ascertain whether there is , or is not , any connection between m33 and this very  high  velocity cloud of hi . at the distance of m33 the cloud would have an hi mass of @xmath110  and a diameter of 70 kpc .",
    "-0.2 in    figure  [ fig : m33_m31 ] also shows several other hvc patches that appear as a broken chain of emission along the line between m31 and m33 , suggesting some sort of tidal streamer .",
    "these patches emit most strongly in the velocity range @xmath111 to @xmath112 , that is , within about 50 to 70 of the systemic velocity of m33 , @xmath113 .",
    "the characteristic velocity of wright s cloud differs from the systemic velocity of m33 by about the same amount that the velocity of the m31 cloud differs from the systemic velocity of m31 .",
    "we have so far established that at least one hvc is extragalactic , and that there are a number of hvcs plausibly associated with the most massive members of the local group .",
    "all of the emission seen in figure  [ fig : m33_m31 ] at @xmath114 , with the exception of that from the disks of m31 and m33 , is contributed by hvcs , suggesting that the entire region is replete with these objects .",
    "figure  [ fig : hvcbary ] shows the high  velocity emission from a larger region of the ld survey , @xmath115 , @xmath116 , centered approximately on the direction of the barycenter of the local group .",
    "emission from the gaseous disk of the milky way is seen as the band running along the top of the image from @xmath117 to @xmath118 .",
    "all of the remaining emission is due to hvcs .",
    "some of the smaller hvcs pervading this larger region are not catalogued by wvw91 because of the more complete spatial sampling of the ld survey .",
    "-0.2 in    -0.2 in    hvcs are not uniformly distributed on the sky , and wakker s ( 1991 ) figure 2 , ( reproduced here as figure  [ fig : aitoff ] ) , demonstrates this well  known , important point .",
    "-0.2 in    -0.2 in    the figure shows hi column  density contours of the hvcs catalogued through 1990 .",
    "wakker identifies 10 distinct populations but , for the purposes of our discussion , identification of four major hvc groupings suffices to encompass most of the hvcs over the entire sky .",
    "these are : ( 1 ) the magellanic stream ( indicated by ms in figure  [ fig : aitoff ] ) ; ( 2 ) the northern hemisphere clouds ( @xmath119 ; @xmath120 ) comprising complexes a , c , and m ) ; ( 3 ) the local  group barycenter clouds ( @xmath121 ; @xmath122 ) comprising complexes g , h , and achv ; and ( 4 ) the local  group antibarycenter clouds ( @xmath123 ; @xmath124 ) comprising the hvc complexes wa , wb , wc , and wd discovered by wannier & wrixon ( 1972 ) and wannier , wrixon , & wilson ( 1972 ) at moderate positive  velocity deviation values , and the ep clouds ( see references in wvw91 ) at extreme positive  velocity deviations .",
    "each of these major groupings of hvcs has a distinct kinematic signature .",
    "the magellanic stream is a narrow streamer running through the south galactic pole and the magellanic clouds , and is contiguous over hundreds of degrees on the sky over a wide range of velocities .",
    "the northern hemisphere clouds are also contiguous in space and velocity , but the clouds have a narrower velocity extent than the ms .",
    "these clouds , which are the most extensively studied of all hvc groupings , all have negative velocities , with velocities traceable into the ivc regime or even into the regime of conventional galactic  disk kinematics .",
    "the local  group barycenter clouds comprise the clouds seen in the general direction of the massive local group galaxies , and all have negative velocities relative to the lsr .",
    "the local  group antibarycenter clouds all have positive velocities relative to the lsr .",
    "the clouds constituting this grouping are situated approximately opposite to the direction of the barycenter of the local group .",
    "they do not form well  defined streamers : the individual members of this grouping are spatially distinct , relatively small in extent , and with modest kinematic gradients . unlike the northern hemisphere clouds , both the barycenter and the antibarycenter groupings are characterized by clouds with radial velocities that vary greatly from cloud to cloud over the spatial extent of the entire grouping . in what follows ,",
    "we eliminate the magellanic stream clouds from the statistics of the hvcs , because their origin is known and is evidently distinct from that of the other clouds .",
    "we consider first the local  group barycenter clouds .",
    "an estimate of the positional centroid of this grouping from figures  [ fig : hvcbary ] and [ fig : aitoff ] yields @xmath125 , @xmath126 .",
    "this centroid is remarkably close to the projected barycenter of the local group calculated by einasto & lynden - bell ( 1982 ) to be at @xmath127 , @xmath128 , and well within the error ellipse of their estimate .",
    "the angular extent of the barycenter grouping is approximately a steradian , roughly what one would expect if the volume of the local group were filled with these clouds .",
    "but if these clouds are related to the local group , they must then share its kinematics .",
    "the mean velocity , velocity extent , and the velocity centroid of the ensemble of hvcs provide a good test of which frame of reference is most relevant .",
    "imagine a frame of reference moving at constant velocity relative to the barycenter of a group of objects such as the hvcs . in this moving frame , the mean velocity of the ensemble will be shifted , but the velocity dispersion will remain unchanged . on the other hand , in a reference frame that is rotating with respect to the barycenter of the ensemble and offset from it ,",
    "the observed velocity dispersion will be increased ; there may be also be a shift in the mean velocity , depending on the distribution of the ensemble on the sky , although such a shift would tend toward zero for full  sky coverage .",
    "consider , for example , the radial velocities of globular clusters relative to the local standard of rest and relative to the galactic  center standard of rest ( gsr ) .",
    "clearly , the velocity dispersion of the ensemble of globular clusters should be smaller when measured relative to the gsr , and there would be no shift in the mean velocity .",
    "transformation from lsr to gsr coordinates is achieved by subtracting the motion of the lsr , 220 sin @xmath10 cos @xmath129 , from the lsr velocity of each globular cluster . using the compilation of harris ( 1996 ) , we find that the globular clusters have a dispersion of 134 and a mean velocity of 9 @xmath53 12 relative to the lsr ; relative to the gsr , the dispersion is 119 with a mean of 3 @xmath53 11 , as expected .",
    "-1.7 in    -3.0 in 3.4 in -0.2 in    if we now consider the system of hvcs in the same way , the change in the velocity dispersion is even more dramatic ; the results are shown in figure  [ fig : hvclsr ] .",
    "the dispersion of the complete hvc ensemble is 159 relative to the lsr ; relative to the gsr , it falls to 101 .",
    "the mean velocity in both cases is , however , significantly different from zero : @xmath130 , measured with respect to the lsr , and @xmath131 measured with respect to the gsr .",
    "these values suggest that the gsr inertial frame is more appropriate than the lsr frame , and that both the gsr and lsr frames are moving at constant velocity relative to the barycenter of the hvcs .",
    "this result is at variance with a galactic origin for the hvcs .",
    "if hvcs originated in the galactic disk , then the velocity dispersion of the hvc ensemble would be lower in the lsr frame because the gas would conserve angular momentum .",
    "if the hvcs originated in the galactic center , the mean velocity of the ensemble would be zero .",
    "evidently , the entire milky way is moving toward the barycenter of the hvcs .",
    "if so , then the velocity centroid of the local group barycenter clouds should reflect the motion of the milky way toward the local group barycenter , which is given by einasto & lynden - bell ( 1982 ) as @xmath132 relative to the lsr .",
    "we define the barycenter clouds as all of the hvcs within an ellipse centered on @xmath133 , @xmath134 , with a major and minor axis of 60and 30 , respectively , and where the major axis is tilted by 30counterclockwise from = 0 .",
    "some 96 of the clouds catalogued by wvw91 fall within this ellipse .",
    "relative to the lsr , the mean velocity of these clouds is @xmath135 ; relative to the gsr , the mean velocity is @xmath136 . if we now subtract the motion of the gsr relative to the local  group standard of rest ( lgsr ) , the mean velocity of the local  group barycenter clouds becomes @xmath137 , suggesting that the lgsr is a reference frame more appropriate to the local  group barycenter clouds than either the gsr or the lsr reference frames .",
    "we note , however , that although the change of coordinate systems produces a considerable lowering of the mean velocity of the local  group barycenter hvcs , the mean is still marginally negative .",
    "furthermore , the antibarycenter clouds , which are on the opposite side of the milky way from m31 , also have a negative mean velocity relative to the gsr and to the lgsr of @xmath138 and @xmath139 , respectively .",
    "it is reasonable to ask why reduction to the lgsr does not produce a zero mean velocity if it is the non  translating inertial reference frame , and , furthermore , why the clouds that are approximately opposite on the sky to the barycenter clouds are moving more rapidly toward the barycenter of the local group than the barycenter clouds themselves .",
    "we note in this regard that a non  zero mean velocity of the hvcs relative to the barycenter would occur if the entire cloud ensemble were either expanding or contracting ; a negative mean velocity implies infall , as first accounted for in the model of bajaja et al .",
    "second , if the milky way is itself falling toward the barycenter of the local group as postulated by kahn & woltjer ( 1959 ) , because the milky way lies between the antibarycenter clouds and the barycenter , the antibarycenter clouds would be accelerated both toward the milky way @xmath140 toward the barycenter of the local group , with the sign and relative magnitude consistent with the observed mean radial velocities . in ",
    "[ sec : dynamics ] , we discuss a model for the dynamics of the hvcs in the local group that reproduces the observed negative mean lgsr velocities in both the barycenter and antibarycenter cloud groupings . in this model ,",
    "the hvcs are fragments remaining from the ( continuing ) formation of the local group , falling towards its center of gravity .",
    "no cloud is catalogued in the wvw91 compilation with a positive velocity higher than @xmath141 , and no cloud with a negative velocity lower than @xmath14 , even though the useful velocity range of the principal surveys contributing to that catalogue is @xmath17 to @xmath18 .",
    "this limitation on the velocity extent of the hvc ensemble suggests that the hvcs constitute a gravitationally bound system of clouds rather than a collection of objects more or less randomly distributed in extragalactic space , which would not show such cutoff velocities .",
    "one can not use either the value of the velocity dispersion or the values of the velocity extrema to differentiate between a galactic and an extragalactic origin , because both origins encompass the observed values , but it is reasonable to ask what sort of mass would keep the clouds bound in the local group hypothesis . for a radius of 1.5 mpc ,",
    "( see  [ sec : dynamics ] below ) the measured one  dimensional velocity dispersion of 106 gives a mass of @xmath142 for a virialized ensemble of objects .",
    "this mass is close to the mass of @xmath143 obtained from the timing argument by kahn & woltjer ( 1959 ) .",
    "imagine that all of the hvcs ( again excluding the magellanic stream ) comprise a single class of extragalactic objects .",
    "if the clouds have a uniform set of properties , such as a single power ",
    "law size distribution independent of their location in the local group , then the nearer clouds would have , on average , a larger angular extent than the more distant ones . in that case , it should be possible to distinguish kinematically the nearer clouds from the more distant ones .",
    "we note first that most of the luminous mass in the local group is concentrated in m31 and the milky way , and that these two galaxies are approaching each other at a velocity of 123 .",
    "relative to the gsr , one would then expect that the clouds closest to the milky way would have velocities closest to 0 .",
    "if the hvcs are falling toward the local group barycenter , then those clouds with the most negative velocities with respect to the gsr would be the most distant ; in the terms of the present analysis , these would correspond to clouds on the far side of m31 , approaching both m31 @xmath140 the barycenter .",
    "increasing distance would correspond roughly to increasingly negative velocity with respect to the gsr .",
    "we therefore would expect a significant correlation between angular size and gsr velocity .",
    "-0.2 in    the angular size , @xmath51 , tabulated by wvw91 , plotted against gsr velocity , with clouds collected in bins 50 wide , is shown in figure  [ fig : sizevel ] .",
    "the error bars give the statistical uncertainty of the mean in each bin . except for the highest positive velocities ( which represent very few clouds in any case )",
    ", there is a good correlation between angular size and gsr velocity in just the sense expected if the hvcs were associated with the local group .",
    "the slope of the distribution depends in detail on the dynamics of the local group , the distribution of hvc sizes , and the trajectories of the individual clouds , as discussed in some additional detail below .",
    "it is difficult to see how a galactic origin for the hvcs could produce this correlation ; there is no such correlation in a plot of @xmath51 versus @xmath144 .",
    "the continuing accretion of gas and dark matter onto galaxies and groups is an inevitable prediction of all hierarchical models of the formation of structure in the universe . according to these models , gravitational fluctuations in the dark matter first collapse to form small , bound objects .",
    "if the velocity dispersion in these `` mini  halos '' exceeds 10 , then they are able to accumulate baryons ( ikeuchi 1986 ; rees 1986 ; bond , szalay , & silk 1988 ; babul & rees 1992 ; miralda - escude & rees 1993 ; kepner , babul , & spergel 1997 ) . these mini",

    "pressure stripping ; it is also not clear whether tidal forces will destroy the mini  halos .",

    "the fate of the dark matter will depend upon the mean density in these small halos .",

    "the dynamics of the local group is probably rather simple : more than 98% of the mass of the local group is contributed by m31 and its satellites and by the milky way and its satellites ( raychaudhury & lynden - bell 1989 , hereafter rl ) .",
    "thus the dynamics of the local group can be approximated as a two  body problem , with m31 and the milky way approaching each other on nearly radial orbits ( einasto & lynden - bell 1982 ) .",
    "the gravitational effects of neighboring galaxies complicates this simple two - body interaction .",
    "the neighboring galaxies exert a net force on the local  group barycenter that produces a bulk flow of the entire local group and , in addition , exert a tidal force that compresses and shears the local group . while the bulk flow is probably primarily due to distant mass concentrations such as the great attractor and the coma cluster , the tidal force is primarily due to neighboring galaxies .",

    "on the other hand , if shock ionization is responsible for the emission from the a , c , and m complexes , the smaller h@xmath13 intensitites may be the result of lower velocities relative to the ambient halo gas than is the case for the magellanic  stream clouds .",
    "in any event , we expect most of the remaining hvcs to exhibit lower  intensity h@xmath13 emission than either set of detections because nearly all of them would be either farther away from the source of leakage radiation or in a much lower ",

    "if the hvcs are galactic , then they would have abundances that are at least solar . in a galactic  fountain model , for example , gas ejected from the inner galaxy would have abundances greater than solar because the galactic metallicity gradient implies high metallicity in the inner galaxy .",
    "gas that is simply ejected vertically and falls back vertically does not attain high velocities relative to the lsr .",
    "furthermore , if the source of the fountain is gas ejected into the corona by massive stars and supernovae , this gas should be metal enriched , even at the solar circle .    in the local  group infall model , on the other hand",

    "this characteristic metallicity is poorly known , but is probably significantly greater than the primordial abundance . in poor groups ,",
    "x - ray observations imply metallicities @xmath198 solar ( davis et al .",
    "this non  primordial abundance likely represents the chemical pollution of the intergalactic gas .",
    "asca observations of rich clusters find metal abundances of roughly half the solar abundance ( mushotzky et al .",
    "1996 ) . based upon the large metal abundances seen in intercluster gas , renzini ( 1997 ) suggested that the metal abundance of the intergalactic medium has today reached 1/3 of the solar value .",
    "thus , even though we identify the hvcs as gas clouds which are falling into the local group for the first time , their phenomenological association with ly@xmath13 absorbers suggests that their metallicities would be subsolar , with values of @xmath187 0.1 to 0.3 solar , but not primordial .",
    "abundance measurements from absorption  line studies show , on the other hand , that hvcs always have metallicities significantly less than solar , generally @xmath199 solar ( savage et al . 1993 ; lu , savage , & sembach 1994 ; sembach et al .",
    "1995 ; sembach & savage 1996 ; lu et al . 1997",

    "however , because some lines are saturated , and because observed lines may not always be the dominant ionization stage , it is not always possible to obtain reliable metallicities from the observations .",
    "furthermore , abundances of some species may be depleted onto grains , further complicating metallicity determinations .",
    "however , analyses of the iras and cobe data bases ( wakker & boulanger 1986 ; schlegel , finkbeiner , & davis 1997 ) suggest that the dust abundances in the northern hemisphere complex are at least three times lower than the locally determined value . also ,",
    "because the hvcs are observed primarily at high galactic latitudes , if they were galactic then the hvcs should be more like the warm diffuse clouds where the gas  phase depletions are considerably smaller .",
    "thus depletion onto dust grains would be minimal because there is little dust on which to deplete the gas , and because the hvcs would , in any event , correspond to interstellar clouds where the depletion is already relatively minimal .",
    "alternatively , the iras non - detections of hvcs may result from dust temperatures lower than those typically found in the galactic plane ; in that case , heating by the interstellar radiation field implies distances of at least 10 kpc from the galactic plane ( wakker & boulanger 1986 ) , a value consistent with the local group hypothesis .",
    "one hvc was measured to have an s / h ratio of 0.25 solar ( lu et al .",
    "1997 ) , which should represent its true metallicity , because sulfur is not readily depleted onto grains and because the sii transition observed should be the dominant ionization stage of the ion .",
    "conclude that this metallicity suggests a magellanic cloud origin , even though the hvc in question is not part of the magellanic stream .",
    "the metallicity is reasonably consistent with the local  group hypothesis , but inconsistent with a galactic origin .",
    "complex c in the northern hemisphere grouping exhibits a mgii line with an abundance of 0.10 solar and another , higher  velocity component ( associated with cloud 84 in the wvw91 catalogue and presumably not part of the northern hemishere cloud ) , with an abundance of 0.06 solar ( bowen & blades 1993 ; bowen et al .",
    "1995 ; wvw97 ) .",
    "sembach & savage ( 1996 ) give somewhat different abundances , an order of magnitude lower in the case of cloud 84 , but always well below solar values .",
    "for mgii the ionization correction should not cause significant uncertainty , although sembach & savage point out that the results may be affected by dust depletion .",
    "the expected depletion for magnesium in warm halo gas is , however , only about a factor of three on average ( sembach & savage 1996 ) ; these two clouds may be reasonably considered to be metal deficient even for halo gas , contrary to expectations if the gas originated in a galactic fountain .",
    "we therefore find that of two lines of sight with three individual hvcs , there are metal deficiencies of as much as a factor of twenty , and that no line of sight has abundances that even approach solar values .",
    "if hvcs are indeed characteristically extragalactic , and are the leftover building blocks from which the local group formed , similar entities would be expected to be observed toward other galaxy groups . because the details of the distribution would depend on the dynamics of the particular galaxy group being observed ,",
    "the detailed spatial and kinematic patterns of the local group would not be preserved .",
    "the general properties of the hvc phenomenon would , however , be preserved out to the hubble  flow turnaround radius of the galaxy group in question , and might be observable with radio interferometers or , in some nearby groups , with single dishes . as we discuss below , such clouds have apparently been detected .",
    "we first consider the sensitivity of the vla and of single dishes for a search for extragalactic hvcs .",
    "for the vla , the brightness sensitivity is greatest in the most compact configuration , the d  array ; maximum sensitivity is attained when the velocity channels are the broadest . if we assume that the channels are 20 wide , equal to the mean linewidths of the hvcs in table 1 , and that all 27 antennas are used for an integration time of 8 hours ( a single earth ",
    "rotation synthesis ) , we obtain an rms brightness sensitivity of 0.12 k. a detection with this many pixels and a single velocity channel requires a minimum signal - to - noise ratio of 5 @xmath193 , or an equivalent mean column density of @xmath200 2 in a synthesized beam with a diameter of 44 .",
    "this estimate is a lower limit to the detectable column density because it assumes observing at the zenith , 100% system efficiency , and natural weighting .",
    "we now further assume that we are trying to detect an hvc system identical to the one we associate with the local group , with a turnaround radius of 1.5 mpc and a mean hvc diameter of 28 kpc .",
    "the primary beam ( i.e. field of view ) is 30 ; a cluster of local  group hvcs would have to be at a distance of 340 mpc to fill this primary beam .",
    "the synthesized beam ( resolution element ) at this distance is 73 kpc , diluting the signal by a factor of 6.7 and raising the minimum detectable column density by the same factor .",
    "thus , one would detect hvcs with a mean @xmath201 2 ; figure  [ fig : columndens ] shows that there are only two galactic hvcs with such large column densities .",
    "the detection threshold would increase if the clouds just fill the synthesized beam , which would occur for a system at a distance of 130 mpc , but , at that distance , one would decrease the total number of clouds in the primary beam by a factor of 6.7 . given the frequency distribution of column densities shown in figure  [ fig : columndens ] , we find that only 5.5% of the hvcs have @xmath202 2 , and only 2.0% have @xmath203 2 , a more realistic detection limit . if another system at a distance of 130 mpc has the same number of clouds as the local group , some 550 , one would expect to detect only 5 clouds at a threshold column density of @xmath204 2 , and only 2 clouds at a threshold of @xmath205 2 .",
    "all extragalactic searches have , however , focused on galaxies with distances less than 130 mpc .",
    "in such nearby searches , the significance of a detection in a single pixel is not substantially increased unless a large fraction of the surface area of an hvc is at a column density much above the mean . in that case",
    ", one might be able to detect the higher  column  density parts of an hvc with lower sensitivity observations , yielding a size smaller than that of the cloud as a whole .",
    "spatial averaging could also increase the significance of a detection . on the other hand , the smaller area covered by the primary",
    "beam means that there is a decreasing probability of intersecting a single cloud ( @xmath206 ) , such that the probability of detecting a cloud in a cluster at a distance of 13 mpc , for example , is 0.05 at a column density of @xmath207 2 , if the clouds are uniformly distributed within the turnaround radius .",
    "the detection probability increases with the square of the distance and is further increased if the distribution of hvcs is not random but shows some concentration in the deeper parts of the potential well , close to the most massive galaxies in the cluster . in that case ,",
    "a good strategy would involve targeted searches near massive galaxies in poor groups .",
    "the detection probability is also enhanced to the degree that the wvw91 compilation is incomplete . for most searches to date , we estimate that the probability of a detection with a radio interferometer of a single hvc like those in the local group is generally less than unity , but probably more than @xmath79 0.1 , depending on the galaxy  cluster environment and its distance , suggesting that some extragalactic hvcs might already have been detected . in any event",
    ", we expect that interferometric searches would rarely detect more than one cloud in the primary beam for nearby objects , and no more than a few clouds at large distances .    for single  dish searches ,",
    "the brightness sensitivity is much greater than with an interferometer , but at distances greater than 3 mpc an hvc would be unresolved with a 25m dish .",
    "a 5 @xmath193 detection of a cloud with a mean column density of @xmath208 2 at 3 mpc requires about 1/2 hour of on  source integration time with a sensitive system , or a total of about 1 hour in real time .",
    "such an observation would detect any cloud in the wvw91 compilation .",
    "however , the surface filling fraction of those clouds is only 5% ; about 20 hours of observing would be necessary to find one cloud at a distance of 3 mpc .",
    "most small groups of galaxies lie at greater distances , and although the probability of intersecting a cloud goes up as the square of the distance , the signal from a single cloud is decreased by the same factor , and one detects only the higher  column  density hvcs for a fixed integration time . as with interferometers ,",
    "the detection probability depends on the unknown degree of clustering of the hvcs , and on the incompleteness of the wvw91 compilation . with a small ( 25m to 50m ) antenna",
    ", one expects that a detection would be manifested as an asymmetric wing on an hi line profile .",
    "bates & maddalena ( 1996 ) searched for high  velocity wings using the nrao 43m telescope and found such wings toward 8 of the 23 galaxies observed .",
    "further analysis and interferometric observations are required to determine whether this gas is like the local  group hvc ensemble , but their observations suggest that single dishes might be able to detect extragalactic hvc candidates . the newly",
    " upgraded 300m arecibo telescope affords approximately the same column ",
    "density sensitivity as smaller dishes , but has a much smaller beam which would resolve hvcs out to distances of about 30 mpc .",
    "however , one still expects only a few detections in 20 hours of observation because of the expected small surface  filling fraction of the hvcs .",
    "we therefore conclude that detection of hvc analogues in other systems should be possible with a good search strategy and a sufficient investment of observing time .",
    "several published hi searches have turned up clouds which resemble what we expect for extragalactic hvcs .",
    "observations by van der hulst & sancisi ( 1988 ) toward the giant sc galaxy m101 showed two clouds superimposed on the disk with radial  velocity differences of 130 and 160 from normal galactic rotation .",
    "the masses of those clouds are @xmath110 and @xmath209 and the diameters are 16 kpc and 5 kpc , respectively , for h@xmath210 = 75 mpc@xmath7 .",
    "van der hulst & sancisi argued that the m101 hvcs must be completely different from even the largest and most massive of the milky way hvcs , if the latter are objects in the galactic halo at distances less than 10 kpc .",
    "the very large kinetic energy ( @xmath211 erg ) of the m101 clouds relative to the host galaxy implies that they are being accreted by the galaxy rather than being expelled .",
    "the mass and diameter of the larger m101 cloud is comparable to the mean value given in table 3 for the local group hvcs , and is thus consistent with its being an hvc similar to those inferred in this paper .",
    "furthermore , the similarity in the velocities of the two clouds discovered by van de hulst & sancisi suggest that they might be fragments of a single object falling onto m101 .",
    "kamphuis & briggs ( 1992 ) found two hvcs toward the galaxy ngc  628 with masses of @xmath212   and @xmath213 ( for h@xmath210 = 75 mpc@xmath7 ) in the outer parts of the ngc  628 disk which they , too , attribute to accretion .",
    "the mean diameters of these clouds are 38 kpc and 47 kpc , respectively ; the respective peak hi column densities are @xmath214 and @xmath215 2 , values within the range of what is observed for the local  group hvcs .",
    "a third , smaller hvc is argued to be possibly related to one of the larger clouds .",
    "more recently , schulman et al . ( 1996 ) detected and mapped an extragalactic hvc toward ngc 5668 with the vla . using a simple rotational model for the hi in ngc 5668 , the authors identified hi emission that is kinematically distinct from the galaxy itself and found a cloud beyond the optical disk of the galaxy , extending in fact even beyond the outer edge of the hi disk .",

    "several of these ( in particular those of taylor et al .",
    "1995 ) show no direct spatial or kinematic connection with the target galaxy",
    ". the others may be extragalactic analogs of complex c , which we argued above is probably being tidally disrupted as it is being accreted by the milky way .",
    "we predict that observations in fields adjacent to other massive galaxies will also turn up hi clouds with properties similar to those given in table 3 , at about the rate determined by the detectability criteria above .",
    "several cogent arguments have been offered against the extragalactic origin of hvcs ( see wvw97 and references there , especially giovanelli 1977 and 1981 , and verschuur 1975 ) .",
    "these arguments include the following : ( 1 ) the kinematics of galaxies in the local group do not match the hvc kinematics ; ( 2 ) if the hvcs are bound , then either they extend beyond the local group or else some 90% of their mass is in a form other than neutral hydrogen ; ( 3 ) no explanation is available for the multi  phase nature of the hvcs , in particular , for the cold gas seen in the hvc cores ; ( 4 ) the small velocity gradients seen in the clouds remain enigmatic ; and ( 5 ) analogous systems of clouds are not detected near external galaxies .",
    "these criticisms were made when the observational situation was much less mature than it is now .",
    "specifically , the sky north of @xmath219 is now quite uniformly surveyed in the hi line , over the velocity range which encompasses the hvc phenomenon .",
    "there is observational evidence for anomalous ",
    "velocity structures in the vicinity of external galaxies , and the astrophysical context now encompasses the idea of galaxy growth through accretion of relatively modest clouds which may contribute dark and ionized matter as well as the observed neutral gas .",
    "it seems that the earlier arguments against the extragalactic hvc origin do not pertain for the local group infall hypothesis which we have discussed here .",
    "@xmath220 we showed in  5 and  6 that the kinematics of infalling gas does , in fact , match the observed hvc kinematics .",
    "@xmath220 we indicated in  4 that there is roughly 10 times more dark matter than luminous gas associated with each hvc , the same ratio of dark matter to matter accounted for as in galaxies and on cosmological scales .",
    "@xmath220 we argued in  6 that gas in dark matter halos with velocity dispersions of 10 to 30 will form a two  phase structure as the denser gas in the dark ",
    "matter cores cools and is shielded from the intergalactic ionization field .",
    "@xmath220 we showed in  6 that the small velocity gradients occur because the hvcs are gravitationally focused into large  scale filaments .",
    "@xmath220 we pointed out in  6 that quasar absorption  line studies do , in fact , reveal clouds with hi column densities of @xmath221 to @xmath222 2 , namely the lyman ",
    "limit systems associated with galaxy groups , and in  7 that hi analogues have been detected toward a number of other galaxies through 21cm aperture synthesis .",
    "if the milky way and m31 are accreting material in the form of hvcs , it is possible to estimate the infall rate from the simulation discussed in  [ sec : simulation ] , normalized by the total hvc mass currently observed .",
    "the results of this estimate are shown in figure  [ fig : accrete2 ] .",
    "the accretion rate is determined by assuming that any cloud in the simulation that passes within 100 co  moving kpc of the center of either the milky way or m31 is ultimately absorbed by that galaxy .",
    "this is a gross simplication of the accretion process , but it is nonetheless useful to explore the accretion history in the simulation .",
    "-0.2 in    the upper panel of figure  [ fig : accrete2 ] shows that accretion is rapid early on , reaching a peak at about 30 times the current rate for the milky way within a billion years after the beginning of the simulation .",
    "although the accretion rate for m31 is about twice that of the milky way in the first few billion years , the rates at the present epoch are nearly equal .",
    "about half of the mass accreted by the milky way falls onto it during the first 2 billion years .",
    "using the direct normalization from the simulation , the present  day accretion rate shown in figure  [ fig : accrete2 ] for the milky way is 7.5 y@xmath7 , corresponding to a neutral  gas accretion rate of about 1.2 y@xmath7 .",
    "another way to estimate the accretion rate is by comparison with the observed hvcs .",
    "figure  [ fig : accrete2 ] shows that roughly 30% of the total mass accreted by the milky way has been acquired during the past 9 billion years .",
    "as mentioned in  6 , this mass is approximately equal to the mass currently observed in hvcs , and is about 25% of the original inventory .",
    "there are 518 hvcs in the wvw91 compilation that are not part of the magellanic stream .",
    "comparison of the compilation with maps made from the ld survey revealed a number of small clouds not in the wvw91 catalogue because they lie between the grid points of the coarser surveys ; the incompleteness , however , probably changes the total number by less than a factor of two .",
    "thus the total mass in hvcs at the present time is contributed by @xmath791000 clouds with a mean mass of @xmath223 , or @xmath224 .",
    "roughly 50% of the total accreted over the past 12 billion years corresponds to an average rate of 12.5 y@xmath7 .",
    "figure  [ fig : accrete2 ] indicates that there have been about 2 e  folding times in the past 12 billion years .",
    "the present  day total accretion rate should be about 1/e of the average rate of about 4.6 y@xmath7 , or a neutral  gas accretion rate of @xmath79 0.8 y@xmath7 , in reasonable agreement with the accretion rate given above .",
    "we should not take these numbers as more than rough estimates , in view of the uncertainties and simplifications present in the simulation .",
    "the gas accretion rate , for example , would be significantly larger if a large quantity of ionized gas were associated with the hvcs .",
    "it is worth noting in this context that lacey & fall ( 1985 ) and blitz ( 1997 ) have argued that the short ( 2 to 5 @xmath63 y ) molecular  gas depletion time for the milky way could be compensated with gas infall equal to the net rate of gas conversion into stars , some 1 to 3 y@xmath7 .",
    "the gas accretion rate we infer for the hvcs is within this range , and could provide the fuel for the continuing star formation in the milky way and in spiral galaxies in general .",
    "the most frequently discussed origin for the hvc phenomenon is the `` galactic fountain '' proposed by shapiro & field ( 1976 ) and elaborated by bregman ( 1980 ) and others . in the galactic ",
    "fountain model , gas is heated by supernova explosions in the disk to temperatures of @xmath225 k , convects to the galactic corona where it radiatively cools , and then falls back to the disk as high  velocity gas . to explain the high velocities observed at latitudes away from the zenith",
    ", bregman requires a radial outflow which conserves angular momentum ; this outflow can not account for radial velocities larger than about @xmath226 , yet many hvcs are observed with higher velocities .",
    "the galactic  fountain model makes several other predictions about the nature of the hvcs ( see wakker & bregman 1990 ) : the hvcs would be metal rich because the gas is largely ejected from the inner galaxy ( @xmath227 ) ; their characteristic distances would be between 0 and 10 kpc from the galactic plane ; and their vertical velocities would be less than 70 to 100 .",
    "the predictions of the galactic fountain model are not consistent with many of the observations of the ensemble of hvcs .",
    "the hvcs observed to date all have substantially subsolar abundances and at least two have subsolar metallicities ( see  [ sec : chemistry ] ) .",
    "if the heavy elements in the clouds were bound into dust grains in clouds at distances less than 10 kpc , then the hvcs would have been detected in the iras 60 band , but they were not detected ( wakker & boulanger 1986 ) .",
    " line observations towards agns imply that the filling fraction for hvcs at column densities as low as @xmath228 2 is a factor of 1.5 to 2.0 greater than that found in emission in wvw91 ( murphy et al .",
    "1995 ; bowen et al .",
    "excluding the magellanic stream and the outer arm complex , this implies a surface filling fraction of 20% down to these low column densities , yet only two lines of sight have yielded positive absorption ",
    "line detections of the dozens ( or more ) stars towards which high  velocity absorption has been sought .",
    "this result is difficult to understand if the characteristic distance to an hvc is only a few kpc . finally , many hvcs have vertical velocities that exceed 100 .",
    "one of the attractions of the galactic fountain model is that it seems naturally to fit into a coherent picture for the dynamics of the interstellar medium .",
    "supernovae eject significant amounts of mass into the ism and drive gas upwards through chimneys ( heiles 1990 ) .",
    "mckee ( 1993 ) estimates an outflow rate of several solar mass per year .",
    "mass balance seems to require that this gas is somehow returned to the disk .",
    "-0.2 in    is there evidence for the existence of a galactic fountain ?",
    "we carried out a decomposition of the individual spectra of the ld survey into velocity components , identified from intensity maxima in each spectrum , and selected according to a minimum velocity width .",
    "this selection tends to bias the resulting component list against high  velocity emission .",
    "figure  [ fig : fountain ] summarizes the results of the decomposition and was produced by marking with a dot each velocity component in the list at a given galactic latitude , independent of its longitude .",
    "the plot is therefore a latitude  velocity plot of hi velocities which accentuates the emission observed at low velocities .",
    "the dominant feature in figure  [ fig : fountain ] is the nearly vertical band of emission , but note that the emission near 0 toward both galactic poles is negative , smoothly increasing to slightly positive values near the galactic equator .",
    "gas near zero is overwhelmingly local , but in a static hi layer , the velocities would be precisely zero at latitudes away from the galactic equator .",
    "( at @xmath229 , the galactic rotation along the long lines of sight intercepted would introduce some non  zero velocities , slightly positive when averaged over the longitude range of the ld survey . ) .",
    "an error in the determination of the lsr would have a different signature , resulting in deviations of equal magnitude but opposite signs in the two galactic hemispheres .",
    "rather , figure  [ fig : fountain ] suggests that the gas is falling toward the plane in both hemispheres .",
    "the predominance of negative velocities toward the poles has been known for many years ( see e.g. weaver 1974 ; kulkarni & fich 1985 ; lockman & gehman 1991 ) .",
    "we note that the deviation from zero velocity is quite symmetric with respect to the galactic plane , implying that the gas motions are both systematic and quite general .",
    "-0.2 in    if the motions implied by figure  [ fig : fountain ] represent vertical infall onto the galactic plane , then the velocities should show a sin@xmath129 dependence which other systematic motions would not show .",
    "figure  [ fig : fountfit ] shows the mean of the velocity components , averaged over all longitudes at each latitude of the ld survey , for the local gas , which is obtained by restricting the calculation of the mean to an lsr velocity range within @xmath53 20 of zero .",
    "superimposed on the data is the least ",
    "squares fit @xmath230 .",
    "deviations from the fit are generally less than 1 , showing that a sine curve is a good description of the data ; such a functional form implies vertical infall .",
    "the ld survey is not an all  sky survey , however , so we checked the eventual effect of the incomplete sky coverage on the figure  [ fig : fountfit ] curve by making latitude ",
    "velocity plots separately in different longitude ranges .",
    "although the ld coverage in the first quadrant is complete in both longitude and latitude , and quite incomplete in the third and fourth quadrants , the general shape and magnitude of the curve shown in figure  [ fig : fountfit ] is present in all quadrants , implying that the motion seen in the figure is a general property of the local gas .",
    "the results imply that the entire hi layer is collapsing toward the equator at a velocity of 6.3 , out to a distance of at least several hundred pc , i.e. the radial distance probed at @xmath231 .",
    "this is an average gas motion ; although there may be local deviations , the local hi layer is apparently not in hydrostatic equilibrium .",
    "we propose that the inflow toward the plane of the hi layer is a manifestation of the galactic fountain ; but rather than velocities of tens up to 100 , the returning flow evidently does not exceed the sound speed of the material in which it is embedded .",
    "thus the returning gas , once it has become neutral , does not have a vertical velocity in excess of about 10 .",
    "the infall velocity is regulated by mass conservation at different heights above the plane and by the requirement that the gas motions not be supersonic , at any @xmath232height .",
    "furthermore , the data suggest that the motions are almost entirely in @xmath232 , as suggested originally by shapiro & field ( 1976 ) , without a large radial component .",
    "we estimate the mass infall rate , d@xmath233/d@xmath234 , from @xmath235 , where @xmath236 is the mean density of the neutral gas , @xmath237 its mean infall velocity , and @xmath238 the area of the milky way onto which the gas falls .",
    "@xmath239 is well determined toward the galactic poles and has an average value of @xmath240 2 ( kulkarni & fich 1985 ) .",
    "we take @xmath236 as @xmath241 , where @xmath242 is the total thickness ( i.e. twice the scale height ) of the hi layer , a loosely defined concept unless the emission is deconvolved into separate components ( see e.g. falgarone & lequeux 1973 ; lockman & gehman 1991 ) . if we take @xmath242 to be twice the scale height in units of 1 kpc , and if we assume that what we observe locally is representative of the infall out to a distance of 10 kpc from the galactic center , then , correcting for helium , @xmath243 my@xmath7 .",
    "if most of the hi seen toward the galactic poles is the cold hi component , then @xmath244 pc ( falgarone & lequeux 1973 ; lockman & gehman 1991 ) , and @xmath245 my@xmath7 .",
    "if the galactic fountain returns gas to radii as large as 15 kpc , or about twice the sun s distance from the center , @xmath246 increases by a factor of 2.3 .",
    "thus for the expected range of hi scale height and radius over which the galactic fountain operates , the expected infall rate from figure  [ fig : fountfit ] is several my@xmath7 .",
    "however , unlike the detailed fountain models proposed to date , the observations imply that the return flows are subsonic and almost entirely normal to the plane .",
    "we now compare the measured mass infall rate with the estimated mass injection rate into the galactic halo by supernovae . taking all of the phases of hi into account , and extrapolating to a radius of 10 kpc ,",
    "( heiles ( 1990 ) obtained a mass injection rate of 1.7 my@xmath7 , in agreement with our estimated infall rate of 2.1 my@xmath7 .",
    "mckee ( 1993 ) found a similar mass injection rate of several my@xmath7 .",
    "thus even though the hi layer is evidently not in hydrostatic equilibrium , the total gas layer in the disk and corona appear to be in steady  state dynamical equilibrium .",
    "the above analysis has implications for understanding the evolution of the galactic disk .",
    "the constant rain of high  velocity clouds implies that the disk experiences episodic accretion of gas . the relatively weak galactic fountain discussed above implies slow radial mixing of metals .",
    "the combination of these two effects would lead to a chemically inhomogeneous interstellar medium , with large radial metallicity gradients .",
    "there is , in fact , evidence for significant chemical inhomogeneities in the galactic disk .",
    "edvardsson et al .",
    "( 1993 ) carried out a high  resolution study of disk stars , finding both a remarkably small scatter in [ @xmath13/fe ] at fixed age and galactic distance , and a relatively large scatter in [ fe / h ] at fixed age .",
    "their study also confirmed the classic g  dwarf problem .",
    "they suggest that these trends reflect the combination of episodic accretion and relatively inefficient mixing .",
    "friel & janes ( 1993 ) found a large spread in metallicity at fixed age , also consistent with the combination of episodic accretion and slow mixing .",
    "the chemical  evolution models of pilyugin & edmunds ( 1996 ) confirm that this combination accounts for the observed metallicity trends .",
    "observations of chemical abundances in orion also appear to confirm the combination of episodic accretion plus local enrichment scenario .",
    "meyer et al . ( 1994 ) argue that the low oxygen abundance in orion , some 40% of the solar value , suggests recent infall . the cunha & lambert ( 1992 , 1994 ) studies of ob associations found evidence for local self ",
    "enrichment of this gas .",
    "most cosmologists believe that galaxy formation is a hierarchical process : galaxies grow by accreting small clouds of gas and dark matter .",
    "this process is a continuing one and we expect that galaxies and groups are currently accreting new clouds .",
    "we simulated this process for the local group and found that properties of the accreted clouds are similar to certain properties of the high  velocity  cloud phenomenon ( excluding the magellanic stream hvcs ) :    @xmath220 most of the hvcs are located either near the general direction of m31 , towards the barycenter of the local group , or in the antibarycenter direction , some 180from the direction of m31 ( see figure  [ fig : lb ] ) .",
    "@xmath220 hvcs have chemical abundances similar to that of intra  group gas , and different from the abundances characteristic of the inner galaxy .",
    "if hvcs were ejected from the inner galaxy as part of a galactic fountain , then their metal abundance would exceed the solar value , and this is not observed .",
    "@xmath220 hvcs have an angular  size / velocity relation that is consistent with the clouds being nearly self  gravitating , and at a distance of @xmath247 kpc .",
    "if the local  group hvc hypothesis discussed in this paper is correct , then studies of hvcs can directly probe the process of galaxy formation .",
    "the validity of this hypothesis can be tested by a number of future observations :    @xmath220 most observations of nearby galaxies would not have detected the gas clouds that are equivalent to the hvcs . moreover , many hi maps of external galaxies extend just beyond the holmberg radius .",
    "our discussion would have the typical hvc located nearly a mpc from the galactic center .",
    "it will be interesting to test our hypothesis with deep hi observations of isolated groups and filaments , searching for hi clouds associated with groups , rather than with individual galaxies .",
    "@xmath220 lyman ",
    "limit clouds , which are seen in absorption towards distant quasars , have column densities similar to those of the hvcs .",
    "observations of nearby lyman  limit and lyman@xmath6 systems show that they are not all associated directly with individual galaxies , but rather with groups of galaxies ( oort 1981 ; stocke et al .",

    "; rauch , weymann , & morris 1996 ) . in the scenario outlined in this paper",
    ", we expect that these clouds would have properties similar to those of the local hvcs .",
    "thus , it would be interesting to use stis to look for lower  column  density high  velocity hi clouds , which would correspond to the lyman@xmath248 clouds .    @xmath220 the simulations predict large amounts of gas accreting onto m31 and the local group from the region of space beyond m31 , under the gravitational attraction of both m31 and our own galaxy . because this gas is several mpc away",
    ", the gas clouds are expected to have small angular sizes and relatively low column densities .",
    "deep hi observations in the m31 direction should be able to detect this gas .",
    "the hypothesis central to this paper , namely that hvcs are at distances of around 1 mpc , would be falsified by the detection of absorbtion in an hvc seen against stars in the milky way halo in the direction of m31 or in the anti  m31 direction . on the other hand , further measurements of low levels of h@xmath13 emission towards these hvcs will strengthen the case for their extragalactic nature .",
    "we have had useful conversations with many people about this work in the last year and a half ; it is difficult to do justice to all of them .",
