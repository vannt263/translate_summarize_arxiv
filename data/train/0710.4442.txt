    "the data on the glitch healing parameter , @xmath0 , provide the best tool for testing the starquake ( ruderman 1972 ; alpar et al 1996 ) and vortex unpinning ( alpar et al 1993 ) models of glitch generation in pulsars .",
    "both of these mechanisms of glitch generation , in fact , consider nss , in general , a two component structure : a superfluid interior core surrounded by a rigid crust ( in the present study we shall use the term ` envelope ' which includes the solid crust and other interior portion of the star right up to the superfluid core ) . in the starquake model , @xmath0 is defined as the fractional moment of inertia , i.e. the ratio of the moment of inertia of the superfluid core , @xmath21 , to the moment of inertia of the entire configuration , @xmath22 , as ( pines et al 1974 ) @xmath23 recently , crawford & demiaski ( 2003 ) have collected the all measured values of the glitch healing parameter @xmath0 for crab and vela pulsars available in the literature and found that for 21 measured values of @xmath0 for crab glitches , a weighted mean of the values yields @xmath24 , and the range of @xmath25 encompasses the observed distribution for the crab pulsar . in order to test the starquake model for the crab pulsar ,",
    "they have computed @xmath0 ( as given by eq.(1 ) ) values for seven representative eoss of dense nuclear matter , covering a range of neutron star masses .",
    "their study shows that the much larger values of @xmath26 for the crab pulsar is fulfilled by all the six eoss ( out of seven considered in the study ) corresponding to a ` realistic ' neutron star mass range @xmath27 .",
    "by contrast , a weighted mean value of the 11 measurements for vela yields a much smaller value of @xmath28 and the all estimates for vela agree with the likely range of @xmath2 .",
    "thus , their results are found to be consistent with the starquake model predictions for the crab pulsar .",
    "they have also concluded that the much smaller values of @xmath2 for the vela pulsar are inconsistent with the starquake model predictions , since the implied vela mass based upon their models corresponds to a value @xmath29 for @xmath2 , which is too low as compared to the ` realistic ' ns mass range .",
    "thus , in the literature , the starquake is considered as a viable mechanism for glitch generation in the crab and the vortex unpinning , the another mechanism , is considered suitable for the vela pulsar , since it can avoid some other problems associated with the starquake explanation of the vela glitches ( see , e.g. crawford & demiaski ( 2003 ) ; and references therein ) .",
    "however , it seems surprising that if the internal structure of nss are described by the same two component conventional models ( as mentioned above ) , different kinds of glitch mechanisms are required for the explanation of a glitch !",
    "furthermore , it also follows from the above discussion that the main reason for not considering the starquake , the feasible mechanism for glitch generation in the vela , lies in the fact that there exists none of the sequence of ns models in the literature which could explain simultaneously , on the basis of starquake model , both the extreme limiting cases of glitch healing parameter , @xmath0 , corresponding to the vela ( @xmath2 ) and the crab ( @xmath1 ) pulsars in the range @xmath30 for the ` realistic ' ns mass values for both the pulsars . the present study , therefore ,",
    "deals with the construction of such models    we assume that _ all _ the nss belong to the same family of ns sequence which terminates at the _ maximum _ value of mass .",
    "certainly , this _ maxima _ should correspond to an _ upper bound _ on ns masses . in order to construct such a sequence",
    ", we have to set the extreme causal eos ( in geometrized units ) , @xmath31 ( where @xmath32 is the pressure and @xmath33 the energy - density ) to describe the core .",
    "firstly , because various observational studies like - the gamma - ray burst data , x - ray burst data and the glitch data etc . , and their explanation ( see , e.g. lindblom 1984 ; cottam et al 2002 ; datta & alpar 1993 ) favour the stiffest eoss .",
    "the latest estimate of the moment of inertia for the crab pulsar ( based upon the ` newest ' observational data on the crab nebula mass ) rules out most of the existing eoss of the dense nuclear matter , leaving only the stiffest ones ( bejger & haensel 2002 ; haensel et al 2006 ) . secondly ,",
    "because of the fact that the ` real ' eos of the dense nuclear matter beyond the density range @xmath34 are largely unknown due to the lack of knowledge of nuclear interactions ( see , e.g. dolan 1992 ; and references therein ; haensel et al 2006 ) , and the various eoss available in the literature ( see , e.g. arnett & bowers 1977 ) for ns matter represent only an extrapolation of the results far beyond this density range .",
    "though , the status of the ` real ' eos for ns matter is not certain , one could impose some well - known physical principle , independent of the eos , such as the ` causality condition ' ( @xmath31 ) throughout the core of the star beyond a fiduciary density , @xmath35 , at the core - envelope boundary to ascertain a definite upper bound on ns masses ( see , e.g. , rhoades & ruffini 1974 ; hartle 1978 ; lindblom 1984 ; friedman & ipser 1987 ; kalogera & baym 1996 ) . in this connection",
    "this is also to be pointed out here that the maximum mass for _ any _ eos describing the core , beyond the density @xmath35 , with a subluminal sound velocity turns out to be less than that of the upper bound obtained by using the extreme causal eos ( see , e.g. , haensel et al 2006 ) .",
    "the envelope of our models ( below the density @xmath35 at the core - envelope boundary ) may be characterized by the well - known eos of classical polytrope @xmath36ln@xmath37ln@xmath38 ( where @xmath39 denotes the density of the rest - mass and @xmath40 is a constant known as the adiabatic index ) for different values of the constant @xmath41 and 2 respectively .",
    "the reason for considering the polytropic eos for the entire envelope lies in the fact that with this eos , our models yield an upper bound on ns masses _ independent _ of the value of @xmath40 , and this upper bound ( for a fiduciary choice of @xmath35 ) is found fully consistent with those of the values cited in the literature ( kalogera & baym 1996 ; friedman & ipser 1987 ) .",
    "thus , the choice of the said polytropic eos for the entire envelope may be regarded entirely equivalent to the choice of the various eoss like wff ( wiringa , fiks & fabrocini 1988 ) , fps ( lorenz , ravenhall & pethick , 1993 ) , nv ( negele & vautherin 1973 ) , or bps ( baym , pethick & sutherland 1971 ) in an appropriate sequence below the density range @xmath35 , adopted by various authors in the conventional models of nss ( see , e.g. , kalogera & baym 1996 ; friedman & ipser 1987 ) , so that the constant @xmath40 appearing in the polytropic eos may be looked upon as an ` average ' @xmath40 for the density range below @xmath35 , specified by the sequence of various eoss in the conventional models of nss .",
    "the choice of the constant @xmath42 and 2 thus become obvious , since this choice can cover almost the entire range of density discussed in the literature for ns matter which is also applicable for the envelope region - the polytropic eos with @xmath43 represents the eos of extreme relativistic degenerate electrons and non - relativistic nuclei ( chandrasekhar 1935 ) , @xmath44 represents the well - known eos of non - relativistic degenerate ` neutron gas ' ( oppenheimer & volkoff 1939 ) , and @xmath45 represents the case of extreme relativistic baryons interacting through a vector meson field ( zeldovich 1962 ) ( the value of @xmath46 is also possible for some eos describing the ns matter , e.g. , malone , johnson & bethe 1975 ; clark , heintzmann & grewing 1971 , however , the results obtained in this paper remain unaffected for the choice of @xmath46 ) , and the outcome of this study ( in terms of explaining the glitch healing parameter for various pulsars and predicting the upper bound on the compactness of nss ( since the upper bound on mass is independent of the value of @xmath40 ) ) would finally decide , among the chosen values , the ` appropriate ' value of @xmath40 for the ns envelope .",
    "the validity of assuming the extreme causal eos in the core and a polytropic eos in the envelope of the present models , in view of the various modern eos of dense nuclear matter , is also discussed in the last section of the present paper .",
    "we have noted that in all conservative models of nss , the choice of the core - envelope boundary , @xmath47 ( corresponding to a density denoted by @xmath35 ) , is somewhat _ arbitrary _ in the sense that there are no criteria available for the choice of a particular matching density , @xmath35 , below which the eos of the ns matter is assumed to be known and unique .",
    "one can freely choose somewhat lower values of @xmath35 ( which will increase the core size ) to obtain higher values of @xmath0 ( see , e.g. shapiro & teukolsky 1983 ; datta & alpar 1993 ) .",
    "to avoid such a procedure , we choose the core - envelope boundary of our models on the basis of the ` compatibility criterion ' which asserts that for an assigned value of the ratio ( @xmath48 ) of central pressure , @xmath49 , to central energy - density , @xmath50 , the compactness parameter @xmath51 ; total mass to radius ratio in geometrized units ) of any _ regular _ configuration should not exceed the compactness parameter @xmath52 of the homogeneous density sphere , in order to assure the compatibility with the hydrostatic equilibrium ( negi & durgapal 2001 ; negi 2004a ) .",
    "this criterion is capable of constraining the core - envelope boundary of any physically realistic ns model . a combination of this criterion with those of the observational data on the glitch healing parameter and the recently estimated minimum value of the moment of inertia for the crab pulsar ( based on the newly estimated ` central value ' of the crab nebula mass @xmath53 in the time - dependent acceleration model ) , @xmath54 ;",
    "where @xmath55 g@xmath56 ( bejger & haensel 2003 ) can provide the desired ns models discussed above , since both the theory ( criterion ) and the observations ( stated above ) are being used to construct the ns models .",
    "since we are using geometrized units ( i.e. @xmath57 , where @xmath58 represent the universal constant of gravitation and @xmath59 is the speed of light in vacuum ) , the metric for spherically symmetric and static configurations can be written in the following form @xmath60 where @xmath61 and @xmath62 are functions of @xmath63 alone .",
    "the oppenheimer - volkoff ( o - v ) equations ( oppenheimer & volkoff 1939 ) , resulting from the einstein field equations for systems with isotropic pressure @xmath32 and energy - density @xmath33 can be written as @xmath64/r(r - 2 m ) \\\\",
    "\\nu'/2 & = & - p'/(p + e )   \\\\",
    "m'(r ) & = & 4\\pi e r^2 \\,;\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the prime denotes the radial derivative and @xmath65 represents the mass contained within the radius @xmath63    @xmath66    the coupled eqs.(3 - 5 ) are solved for the model ( supplemented by the boundary conditions : @xmath67 , @xmath68 , @xmath69 at @xmath70 ) by considering the eos , @xmath31 , in the core and choosing various values of @xmath40 in the polytropic envelope for various assigned values of @xmath48 such that for each value of @xmath48 , the compactness ratio of the whole configuration always turns out to be less than or equal to the compactness ratio of the corresponding sphere ( with the same @xmath48 ) of the homogeneous density distribution and should not exceed the _ exact _",
    "absolute upper bound on compactness ratio of nss compatible with causality and pulsational stability ( see , e.g. negi 2004b ) .",
    "the fulfillment of both of the conditions stated in the last sentence is usually called the ` appropriate ' fulfillment of ` compatibility criterion ' .",
    "we find that this condition is uniquely fulfilled by all the models corresponding to an envelope with @xmath41 and 2 respectively , if the _",
    "minimum _ value of the ratio of pressure to energy - density , @xmath71 , at the core - envelope boundary reaches about @xmath72 .",
    "the results of this study are presented in tables 1 - 2 and fig.1 for the value of matching density , @xmath73 , i.e. about 3.55 times the nuclear saturation density ( note that the particular choice of @xmath35 used here turns out to be a consequence of the constraints ( i ) and ( ii ) mentioned in the abstract of the present study , and therefore , does not represent a fiduciary quantity as discussed in the next section ) .",
    "it is seen that the models become pulsationally stable up to the maximum value of mass @xmath74 and radius , @xmath75 .",
    "the minimum radius results for the model with a @xmath45 envelope thus maximizes the compactness ratio for the stable configuration , @xmath76 , as shown in tables 1 - 2 .",
    "this behaviour indicates that among various values of @xmath40 chosen in the envelope for the density range right from 3.55 times the nuclear saturation density up to zero at the surface , the ` average ' value of @xmath40 is appropriately described by a polytropic index @xmath77 .",
    "this fact will also follow from some special features of the model with @xmath45 envelope discussed in the next section .",
    "the binding energy per unit mass @xmath78 ; where @xmath79 is the rest - mass ( see , e.g. shapiro & teukolsky 1983 ) ] also approaches a maximum for about 0.3201 for the maximum value of mass up to which the configurations remain pulsationally stable .",
    "however , for the @xmath80 envelope model the binding energy reaches a maximum beyond the maximum value of mass .",
    "for slowly rotating configurations like the crab and the vela pulsars ( rotation velocity about 188 and 70 rad sec@xmath81 respectively ) the moment of inertia may be calculated in the first order approximation that appears in the form of the lense - thirring frame dragging - effect . for crab and vela pulsars ,",
    "the first - order effects turn out to be about 1 - 2% ( other effects like mass shift and deformation from spherical symmetry due to rotation represent second - order effects which are significant for the case of millisecond pulsars . for crab and vela like pulsars ,",
    "the second - order effects turn out to be about @xmath82 or even lower ; see , e.g. arnett & bowers 1977 ; crawford & demiaski 2003 .",
    "therefore , these effects can be safely ignored when studying the macroscopic parameters of the slowly rotating pulsars as carried out in the present paper ) .",
    "these effects are reproduced by an empirical formula that is based on the numerical results obtained for thirty theoretical eoss of dense nuclear matter . for nss , the formula yields ( bejger & haensel 2002 ) @xmath83    where @xmath84 is the compactness ratio measured in units of @xmath85 , i.e. @xmath86 only static ( non - rotating ) parameters of the spherical configuration appear in the formula .",
    "equation ( 6 ) is used , together with coupled eqs.(3 - 5 ) , to calculate the fractional moment of inertia given by eq.(1 ) and the moment of inertia of the entire configuration for an assigned value of the matching density , @xmath35 .",
    "the results of the calculations are presented in table 3 and figs . 2 - 3 .",
    "it is seen from table 3 that among all models corresponding to different values of @xmath40 in the envelope , the lower limits of both the observational constraints for the crab pulsar , @xmath1 and @xmath87 , are appropriately satisfied by the @xmath45 envelope model . since this particular model yields a unique value of matching density , @xmath88 g @xmath89 , for the last two constraints in such a manner that the constraint @xmath90 is appropriately fulfilled by all stable ns models corresponding to the @xmath44 and 2 envelopes for another constraint @xmath1 as shown in table 3 and figs.2 - 3 respectively ( the model with a @xmath80 envelope",
    "is ruled out since it always yields stable models with @xmath91 ) .",
    "another special feature of the @xmath45 envelope model lies in the fact that it yields somewhat wider range of glitch healing parameter , @xmath92 , for the stable models as compared to the @xmath44 envelope model which yields this parameter in the range @xmath93 for stable models as shown in fig.2 and tables 2 - 3 .",
    "furthermore , the @xmath45 envelope model yields somewhat higher value of maximum surface redshift , @xmath94 , for the vela pulsar ( @xmath13 ) and somewhat lower value of minimum surface redshift , @xmath7 , for the crab pulsar ( @xmath95 ) simultaneously , as compared to the @xmath44 envelope model as shown in tables 2 - 3 .",
    "thus provides somewhat wider range of lower and upper bounds on the energy of a gravitationally redshifted radiation from the surface of the vela and the crab pulsars respectively . and above all",
    ", the compactness maximizes , @xmath76 , for the @xmath45 envelope model in the stable sequence of ns models as shown in tables 1 - 2 and fig.1 .",
    "this special feature of the model is also discussed in section 2 .",
    "the above - mentioned features indicate the appropriateness of the @xmath45 envelope model and thus emerges an important consequence of this study which states that the envelope of ` real ' nss may be well approximated by an eos of classical polytrope with ` average ' value of polytropic index , @xmath96 , closer to 1 .    for the minimum value of @xmath97 , table 3 yields @xmath98 for the @xmath45 envelope model and from table 2 , on the basis of @xmath45 envelope model",
    ", we obtain the minimum values of mass , @xmath8 , and surface redshift , @xmath99 , for the crab pulsar .",
    "on the other hand , for the maximum value of @xmath13 which belongs to the vela pulsar , table 3 and fig.3 yield @xmath100 corresponding to the @xmath45 envelope model and table 2 and fig.2 yield the maximum values of mass , @xmath101 , and surface redshift , @xmath94 , for the vela pulsar ( note that the upper weighted mean value of @xmath102 for the vela pulsar , table 2 and fig.2(for the @xmath45 envelope model ) yield the maximum value of mass , @xmath103 , and surface redshift , @xmath104 , for the vela pulsar .",
    "obviously , these values are much closer to the values corresponding to the maximum value of @xmath105 for the vela pulsar ) .",
    "however , for the observational constraint of the ` central ' weighted mean values of @xmath106 for the crab and @xmath18 for the vela pulsar , table 2 and fig.2 ( for the @xmath45 envelope model ) yield the slightly increased values of mass , @xmath17 , and the surface redshift , @xmath16 , for the crab and somewhat decreased values of mass , @xmath107 , and surface redshift , @xmath108 , for the vela pulsar respectively . for these central weighted mean values of @xmath0 , tables 2 - 3 and fig.3 yield for the @xmath45 envelope model , the moment of inertia @xmath109 for the crab and @xmath110 for the vela pulsar respectively . for the lower weighted mean value of @xmath111 corresponding to the vela pulsar , tables 2 - 3 and fig.2 yield ( for the @xmath45 envelope model ) the minimum values of mass , @xmath112 , and surface redshift , @xmath113 , whereas table 3 and fig.3 yield a minimum value of moment of inertia , @xmath114 , for the vela pulsar .",
    "apart from the models of the crab and vela pulsars , let us consider two of the main findings related to the extraordinary gamma - ray burst of 5 march 1979 : ( i ) it gives the only reliable estimate of the surface redshift , @xmath115 ( after taking due account of thermal blueshift ) , associated with the supernova remnant n49 in the large magellanic cloud ( see , e.g. higdon & lingenfelder 1990 ; douchin & haensel 2001 ; and references therein ) , and ( ii ) the implied peak luminosities of the repeating burst grb790305b correspond to an energy of @xmath116 ergs , which is possible only when a starquake releases at least @xmath117 of the ns gravitational binding - energy of @xmath118 ergs ( higdon & lingenfelder 1990 ) .",
    "in order to reproduce both of these findings , one would require a ns model compatible with starquake model predictions that could also account for a surface redshift @xmath119 .",
    "both of these requirements are , in fact , fulfilled by our models . for the case of the @xmath45 envelope model",
    ", we get from tables 2- 3 and fig . 2 - 3 the central value of surface redshift @xmath120 for a mass @xmath121 with @xmath122 .",
    "the binding energy corresponding to this case is obtained as @xmath123 ergs which is capable of releasing @xmath124 ergs of energy required for the latter burst .",
    "this study constructs the stable sequences of ns models terminate at the value of maximum mass , @xmath125 , independent of the eoss of the envelope , for the matching density , @xmath88 g @xmath89 , at the core - envelope boundary .",
    "this value of ` matching density ' is a consequence of the observational constraints @xmath97 and @xmath126 ( associated with the crab pulsar ) imposed together on the @xmath45 envelope model and in this sense does not represent a fiduciary quantity .",
    "the upper bound of the surface redshift , @xmath127 ( corresponding to a @xmath128 value @xmath129 ) , however , belongs to the model with a @xmath45 envelope which is consistent with the absolute upper bound on the surface redshift of ns models compatible with causality and pulsational stability ( negi 2004b ) .",
    "this special feature , together with some other remarkable ones , discussed in the present study underline the appropriateness of the @xmath45 envelope model .    since among the variety of modern eoss discussed in the literature , the upper bound on ns mass compatible with causality and dynamical stability can reach a value up to @xmath130 ( in this category , the sly ( douchin & haensel 2001 ) eos yields a maximum mass of @xmath131 , whereas the bgn1 ( balberg & gal 1997 ) and the apr ( akmal et .",
    "al . 1998 ) eoss yield the maximum masses of @xmath132 and @xmath133 respectively ( see , e.g. haensel et al 2006 ) ) . in view of this result ,",
    "the model - independent maximum mass , @xmath134 , obtained in this study may be regarded as good as those obtained on the basis of modern nuclear theory .",
    "in addition to this result , the appropriate sequences of stable ns models obtained in this study can explain the glitch healing parameter , @xmath0 , of any glitching pulsar , provided the weighted mean values of @xmath0 lie in the range @xmath135 .",
    "this finding also reveals that if the starquake is considered to be a viable mechanism for glitch generation in all pulsars , then the envelope of ` real ' nss may be well approximated by a polytropic eos corresponding to a polytropic index , @xmath96 , closer to 1 .",
    "for the value of matching density , @xmath88 g @xmath89 , the @xmath45 envelope model yields the minimum values of mass @xmath136 and surface redshift @xmath7 for the crab ( @xmath97 ) and the maximum values of mass @xmath101 and surface redshift @xmath94 for the vela pulsar ( @xmath137 ) .",
    "the minimum mass and surface redshift for the crab pulsar are slightly increased up to the values @xmath17 and @xmath16 respectively , if the ` central ' weighted mean value of @xmath106 and the moment of inertia @xmath138 are also imposed on these models . however , for the ` central ' weighted mean value of @xmath139 corresponding to the vela pulsar , the maximum mass and surface redshift are somewhat decreased to the values @xmath140 and @xmath108 respectively .",
    "this value of mass and surface redshift for the vela pulsar can further decrease up to the values @xmath112 and @xmath113 respectively , if the lower weighted mean value of @xmath141 for the vela pulsar is imposed .",
    "these results predict the upper and lower bounds on the energy of a gravitationally redshifted electron - positron annihilation line in the range of about 0.309 - 0.315 mev from the crab and in the range of about 0.425 - 0.439 mev from the vela pulsar respectively .    for a comparison , if the observational constraint of the minimum value of @xmath142 ( the value of moment of inertia for the crab pulsar obtained earlier by bejger & haensel ( 2002 ) , on the basis of the constant - acceleration model for the crab nebula ) together with @xmath97 is imposed on the models studied in the present paper , the @xmath45 envelope model yields the value of matching density , @xmath143 g @xmath89 .",
    "this value of @xmath35 yields a model - independent upper bound on ns mass @xmath144 .",
    "this value of maximum mass , however , represents an ` average ' of the maximum ns masses in the range @xmath145 obtained by kalogera & baym 1996 ( and references therein ) on the basis of other eoss for ns matter , fitted to experimental nucleon - nucleon scattering data and the properties of light nuclei . for this lower value of matching density ,",
    "the @xmath45 envelope models yield the minimum value of mass @xmath146 for the crab ( @xmath97 ) and the maximum value of mass @xmath147 for the vela pulsar ( @xmath13 ) .",
