    "in condensed matter physics systems with strongly interacting quantum mechanical degrees of freedom , it is often a challenge to explain physical phenomena from a truly first principle atomistic point of view . in systems where there are high energy scales well separated from a low - energy sector ,",
    "effective low - energy theories offer the advantage of a reformulation of the problem with an exponentially smaller hilbert space .",
    "a well known and topical example where such an approach is used is in the derivation of an effective spin - only model starting from a hubbard model describing electrons hopping on a lattice .",
    "it is commonly accepted that the low - energy magnetic excitations of a hubbard model with a large coulomb repulsion @xmath9 are easier to investigate within an effective spin hamiltonian .",
    "@xcite generally speaking , the only requirement to be able to derive an effective model is to have a small parameter , which is @xmath10 in the previous example , where @xmath11 is the nearest - neighbor hopping constant .    in many magnetic materials",
    ", the ground state degeneracy of the otherwise free magnetic ions can be partially lifted by electrostatic and covalent interactions due to the surrounding atoms @xmath12 the so called crystal field effect . in a number of situations , the energy scales associated with the spin - spin interactions are much smaller than the energy gap between the single - ion ground state and the excited crystal field states .",
    "in such cases , one can , as a first approximation , often neglect the high energy states and reduce the relevant hilbert space to a much smaller subspace of low energy states . in this paper",
    ", we discuss the quantitative validity of an effective low - energy theory description of a model inspired by the phenomena displayed by the disordered liho@xmath5y@xmath6f@xmath7 magnetic material when subject to an external magnetic field @xmath3 applied perpendicular to the ising direction of the ho@xmath8 magnetic moments .",
    "the liho@xmath5y@xmath6f@xmath7 magnetic material exhibits many interesting magnetic behaviors.@xcite the magnetic properties of liho@xmath5y@xmath6f@xmath7 are due to the ho@xmath8 ions .",
    "the single - ion ground state of ho@xmath8 is a doublet , while the first excited state is at @xmath13 k above the ground state.@xcite the most relevant interactions between the magnetic ho@xmath8 ions are magnetic dipole - dipole interactions.@xcite since the maximum strength of the dipolar interactions is for nearest neighbor separation and is approximatly 0.31 k , collective behavior in this material occurs at temperatures less than o(1 k ) where only the ground doublet is significantly thermally populated .",
    "consequently , the cooperative phenomena and the low temperature properties of this material in zero applied magnetic field should be well captured by an effective model with spin-@xmath14 degrees of freedom.@xcite for example , in zero applied magnetic field , the system can be recast as a diluted dipolar ising model with the low - temperature phase being either a ferromagnet or a spin glass depending on the concentration @xmath15 of magnetic ions.@xcite on the other hand , for @xmath16 and with a magnetic field @xmath3 applied perpendicular to the crystallographic ising @xmath17axis direction , lihof@xmath7 has been advocated as one of the rare physical realization  @xcite of the transverse field ising model ( tfim).@xcite yet , it is only relatively recently that a somewhat rigorous justification of a tfim description of lihof@xmath7 in nonzero @xmath3 has been put forward.@xcite however , over the past twenty years , and until very recently , several experimental studies had found the behavior of liho@xmath5y@xmath6f@xmath7 ( @xmath18 , @xmath19 ) paradoxical , as we now discuss .",
    "one may have naively expected that the application of a transverse magnetic field in liho@xmath5y@xmath6f@xmath7 would allow to explore the physics of the tfim in either a diluted ferromagnet or a spin glass , depending on the concentration @xmath15 .",
    "however , the situation for @xmath18 is quite a bit more complicated.@xcite for example , for @xmath20 , liho@xmath21y@xmath22f@xmath7 displays a conventional spin glass phase transition  @xcite with a nonlinear magnetic susceptibility , @xmath23 , diverging at the spin glass transition temperature , @xmath24 , as @xmath25 as in ordinary spin glass materials.@xcite however , as @xmath3 is increased from zero , @xmath26 becomes steadily less singular , and there appears to be no @xmath4induced quantum critical phase transition between a paramagnet and a spin glass state.@xcite this puzzling experimental behavior had been tentatively interpreted as due to a 1@xmath27 order transition near the @xmath28 quantum phase transition.@xcite however , very recent and independent theoretical investigations  @xcite have instead proposed that the microscopic origin of the `` quenching '' of the paramagnetic to spin glass transition as @xmath3 is turned on is due to the generation of random fields that destroy the spin glass phase .    the authors of ref .",
