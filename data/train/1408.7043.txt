    "<S> we present numerical results of electric conductivity @xmath0 of a fluid obtained solving the relativistic transport boltzmann equation in a box with periodic boundary conditions . </S>",
    "<S> we compute @xmath0 using two methods : the definition itself , i.e. applying an external electric field , and the evaluation of the green - kubo relation based on the time evolution of the current - current correlator . </S>",
    "<S> we find a very good agreement between the two methods .    </S>",
    "<S> we also compare numerical results with analytic formulas in relaxation time approximation ( rta ) where the relaxation time for @xmath0 is determined by the transport cross section @xmath1 , i.e. the differential cross section weighted with the collisional momentum transfer . </S>",
    "<S> we investigate the electric conductivity dependence on the microscopic details of the 2-body scatterings : isotropic and anisotropic cross - section , and massless and massive particles . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the rta underestimates considerably @xmath0 ; for example at screening masses @xmath2 such underestimation can be as large as a factor of 2 . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we study a more realistic case for a quark - gluon system ( qgp ) considering both a quasi - particle model , tuned to lqcd thermodynamics , as well as the case of a pqcd gas with running coupling . </S>",
    "<S> also for these cases more directly related to the description of the qgp system , we find that rta significantly underestimate the @xmath0 by about a @xmath3 . </S>"
