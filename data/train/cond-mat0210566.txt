    "simple fluids are classical systems in which chemically inert particles interact through a pairwise potential .",
    "the main features of the potential are the hard - core repulsion and the short - ranged attraction which give rise to thermal phase transitions .",
    "for example , noble gases and alkali metals are often modeled as simple fluids .",
    "moreover , attraction between particles promotes cluster formation .",
    "it is then sensible to look for a relation between thermodynamics and the morphology of a fluid in terms of clusters . in particular , a geometric interpretation of the liquid - gas phase transition is an important issue in statistical mechanics . to put it more",
    "precisely , there are two main issues : firstly to understand condensation as the sudden formation of a macroscopic cluster , and secondly to describe the morphology of the fluid at the critical point with a view to infer its thermodynamic properties .    to begin",
    ", it must be said that a geometric description of a fluid is outside the scope of thermodynamics .",
    "in addition to standard tools of thermal statistical physics , one has to define what is a cluster . at first sight",
    ", it may seem obvious to define a cluster as a set of particles close to each other and far from other clusters .",
    "however , this definition becomes quite ambiguous at high density , even below the critical density .",
    "therefore , more sophisticated definitions of clusters were introduced , giving the geometric description of simple fluids a long and rich story .",
    "this article presents a comprehensive review of proposed definitions of clusters , with a view to establish a relation between thermodynamics and a geometric description of the fluid .",
    "however , the reader will see that this purpose will take us beyond this particular topic . on the one hand ,",
    "our aim is to outline the main features of these various clusters .",
    "in particular , we highlight the hypotheses on which their definitions are built , in order to discuss their physical relevance .",
    "indeed , some of these definitions were designed as mathematical tools to study thermodynamic properties .",
    "however , these clusters are often used in literature as though one could observe them experimentally . on the other hand",
    ", we clarify the relations between these definitions by following a chronological order so as to avoid frequent misunderstandings . hence",
    ", we develop a new point of view about the kertsz line associated with the coniglio - klein clusters . from this standpoint",
    ", we present a recent approach in terms of self - bound clusters that provides a physical interpretation of the liquid - gas phase transition and suggests the existence of a percolation line in the supercritical phase of simple fluids .",
    "this article is aimed not only at readers interested in fundamental aspects of the relation between thermodynamics and geometry , but also at experimentalists who deal with clusters in various fields of physics . in particular , we think of physicists who search for vestiges of phase transitions in small systems like atomic nuclei , and aggregates .",
    "the plan of the review is as follows . in section [ sec : thermo ]",
    ", we recall the definition of a simple fluid and describe its typical phase diagram .",
    "section [ sec : liquidgas ] is devoted to definitions of clusters based on the `` perfect gas of clusters model '' developed in appendix [ sec : pgc ] .",
    "section [ sec : lattice ] discusses microscopic definitions of clusters proposed in the framework of the lattice - gas model by means of percolation theory . in section [ sec : self ] , we are interested in self - bound clusters defined by energetic criteria .",
    "we present the correspondence between the phase diagram and their cluster size distribution , in the framework of the lattice - gas model , and by using numerical simulations of a lennard - jones fluid .",
    "finally , section [ sec : conc ] contains a summary and we close by discussing several open questions .",
    "a simple fluid is a classical system composed of @xmath0 structureless particles of mass @xmath1 , interacting through a two - body additive central potential @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the distance between particles @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "the potential must have a repulsive hard - core and a short range attraction that vanishes faster than @xmath6 to ensure the thermodynamic limit to exist in three dimensions @xcite .",
    "the lennard - jones potential , for instance , satisfies these conditions : @xmath7\\ ] ] where the two constants @xmath8 and @xmath9 fix the energy and length scales respectively .",
    "the hamiltonian of the fluid is the sum of a kinetic and an interaction energy term : @xmath10 where @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the position and momentum coordinates of the @xmath13 particle , and @xmath14 . in the canonical ensemble , for a given volume @xmath15 and temperature @xmath16 ,",
    "the partition function of the fluid is given by @xmath17 where @xmath18 , @xmath19 is the boltzmann s constant and @xmath20 the planck s constant .",
    "integrations over the momentum coordinates are straightforward and allow us to write the partition function as @xmath21 where @xmath22 and @xmath23 equation ( [ long ] ) defines the thermal wavelength .",
    "the thermodynamics of the fluid is then determined by the behaviour of the configuration integral @xmath24 in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "the typical phase diagram of the system is shown in fig . [ fig1 ] . in the @xmath25 diagram",
    ", coexistence curves separate the plane into three regions corresponding to the solid , liquid , and gas states .",
    "the liquid - gas coexistence curve stops at the critical point ( @xmath26 ) . crossing this curve ,",
    "the system undergoes a first order phase transition signaled by a latent heat and the coexistence of a low density phase , the gas , and a high density phase , the liquid . in other words , compressing a gas at constant temperature @xmath16 below the critical temperature @xmath27 , a first drop of liquid appears when , in the phase diagram , one reaches the liquid - gas coexistence curve at the pressure @xmath28 , at the corresponding density @xmath29 .",
    "this phenomenon is called `` condensation '' . on the other hand , just at the critical point , a continuous phase transition occurs , while the compressibility and the specific heat diverge .",
    "the critical behaviour is known to be in the universality class of the ising model ( see for instance @xcite ) . in the @xmath30 diagram , above the bell - shaped liquid - gas coexistence curve , there is one single fluid phase called the `` supercritical phase . ''",
    "because the thermodynamic properties of the system vary smoothly along any path that does not cross a coexistence curve , it is possible to pass continuously from the gas to the liquid phase by following a path such as the dashed line shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] .",
    "plan ( left ) and the @xmath30 plan ( right ) , where @xmath31 , @xmath16 and @xmath32 are respectively the pressure , temperature and density of the system .",
    "the solid , liquid and gas phases are respectively noted @xmath33 , @xmath34 , and @xmath35 .",
    "the critical point is c. the dashed line with the arrow represents a path in the phase diagram that does not lead to singularities of the partition function . _",
    "_ ]    in the gas , liquid , and supercritical phases , the system is homogeneous , density is uniform on average",
    ". however , attractive interaction between particles contributes to forming localized morphological structures , the clusters .",
    "it must be emphasized that in order to study the morphology of a fluid , we need to give a definition of clusters in addition to standard thermodynamic tools .",
    "indeed , the partition function depends only on the sum of the two - particle interactions , without discerning if a particle belongs to a cluster or not .",
    "in other words , one could arbitrary distribute the @xmath0 particles among a set of clusters , while the partition function and all the thermodynamic properties would not be altered .",
    "of course , the choice of the definition of clusters has no influence on the thermodynamic behaviour of the fluid , but depends on the problem we want to study .    historically , the first motivation for studying the morphology of a fluid was to interpret condensation as the sudden formation of a macroscopic cluster . at that time , the purpose was especially to determine thermodynamic quantities with the help of `` effective '' clusters used as a convenient and powerful tool .",
    "these first definitions of clusters are based on the `` perfect gas of clusters model '' .",
    "the basic idea is to assume that an imperfect fluid made up of interacting particles can be considered as a perfect gas of clusters at thermodynamic and chemical equilibrium : clusters do not interact with each other and do not have any volume . we shall discuss the validity of the perfect gas of clusters approximation at the microscopic level when we tackle the problem of self - bound clusters in section [ these ] .    let us suppose we deal with a collection of non - interacting clusters , without knowing how we can build them as sets of interacting particles .",
    "clusters of given size @xmath33 are characterized by their mass @xmath36 , a chemical potential @xmath37 , and a partition function @xmath38 .",
    "we show in appendix [ sec : pgc ] that the pressure , the density , and the cluster size distribution , that is the mean number of clusters of size @xmath33 , are respectively given by @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the fugacity and @xmath41 the particle chemical potential .",
    "the equation of state of the fluid can be obtained by eliminating @xmath42 in the pressure expression with the help of eq .",
    "( [ fbr ] ) .",
    "it is interesting to write eq .",
    "( [ fbp ] ) as a function of the cluster size distribution given by eq .",
    "( [ nsf ] ) : @xmath43 equation ( [ egp ] ) shows strikingly that the imperfect fluid can be seen as a perfect gas composed of @xmath44 non - interacting clusters .",
    "according to eqs .",
    "( [ fbp])-([nsf ] ) , thermodynamic quantities , as well as the cluster size distribution , are completely determined by the partition function of the clusters .",
    "now , two points of view can be considered . in the pioneer theory of condensation proposed by mayer and his collaborators in 1937",
    ", clusters result from an exact enumeration of all the possible combinations of interacting particles ( sec . [",
    "sec : mayer ] ) .",
    "it is equivalent to giving a formal expression of @xmath45 that is impracticable to handle for large size clusters . on the other hand , frenkel , band ( sec .",
    "[ sec : frenkel ] ) , and fisher ( sec .",
    "[ sec : fisher ] ) propose a phenomenological expression of the partition function @xmath45 , and assume that clusters do not interact whatever the density .",
    "mayer s theory of condensation is described in many textbooks of statistical physics ( see for example @xcite ) and in mayer s articles @xcite . here",
    ", we just want to show how mayer clusters can be seen as a particular case of the perfect gas of clusters model .",
    "originally , this theory was intended to express the exact equation of state of a real fluid , made up of interacting particles , as a series expansion in the density . to this end",
    ", mayer decomposes the partition function ( [ e3 ] ) into the sum over all the possible partitions of particles into independent mathematical clusters .",
    "the first step is to introduce a function of the potential that is significant only if particles are close to each other : @xmath46 the function @xmath47 is bounded everywhere , unlike the potential @xmath2 , and tends to @xmath48 when @xmath3 becomes large compared to the interaction range . using this function as a small parameter , one can write the configuration integral ( [ zn ] ) as a diagrammatic expansion by associating an @xmath0-particle graph with each term .",
    "a graph consists of vertices and bonds : to each particle corresponds a vertex , and the function @xmath49 is represented by a bond connecting vertices @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "a set of pair by pair connecting vertices is called a `` mayer cluster '' . each graph , or term of the expansion ,",
    "is characterized by a cluster size distribution .    by collecting the terms having the same cluster size distribution , one",
    "obtain a new expression of the partition function that can be simplified by moving over to the grand canonical ensemble . in the thermodynamic limit",
    ", pressure and density are eventually written as series expansion in the fugacity . as a result , calculations lead to the expressions ( [ fbp ] ) and ( [ fbr ] ) , in which @xmath50 is replaced by @xmath51 , where coefficients @xmath52 are the so - called `` cluster integrals '' introduced by mayer , and @xmath53 is the thermal wavelength of the particle defined by eq .",
    "( [ long ] ) .    in order to locate the condensation point , that is the density at which a macroscopic cluster appears",
    ", we have to examine the cluster size distribution given by eq .",
    "( [ nsf ] ) . at a given temperature , the behaviour of the coefficients @xmath52 for @xmath54 shows that with increasing density , @xmath55 becomes non - zero when @xmath56 .",
    "a macroscopic cluster appears , and mayer identifies this particular density @xmath57 with the density of condensation .",
    "however , yang and lee @xcite proved that mayer s theory is exact in the gas phase , for @xmath58 , but can not be carried forward into the liquid phase .    by definition ,",
    "mayer clusters form a perfect gas of clusters and are designed to evaluate thermodynamic quantities . yet",
    ", it can be shown that @xmath52 , and therefore the cluster size distribution , may be negative in certain thermodynamic conditions . there",
    "then appears to be no physical interpretation of these clusters @xcite .",
    "in contrast to mayer s theory , the basic idea of frenkel s model @xcite is to use directly the perfect gas of cluster model by choosing a phenomenological expression of the partition function of clusters .",
    "afterward , this model was modified to allow for the volume of the clusters @xcite , but attraction between clusters was still overlooked .    by disregarding the degrees of freedom associated with the particles , frenkel assumes the clusters of size @xmath33 to be compact and writes their potential energy @xmath59 , for @xmath33 sufficiently large , as the sum of a bulk and a surface term @xmath60 where @xmath61 and @xmath62 are the bulk and surface potential energy by particle respectively .",
    "frenkel does not take into account the entropy of the clusters and infers the partition function by integrating over the position and momentum coordinates of the center of mass of the cluster : @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the thermal wavelength of a cluster of size @xmath33 ( see eq .",
    "( [ long ] ) ) . according to eq .",
    "( [ nsf ] ) , the frenkel cluster size distribution is given by @xmath65 with @xmath66 the function @xmath67 depends on the temperature and the density through @xmath42 .",
    "the function @xmath68 is independent of the density and always less than 1 . for a given temperature @xmath16 , @xmath68",
    "is fixed , the cluster size distribution depends on density only through @xmath69 .",
    "when @xmath70 , @xmath71 decreases exponentially for @xmath54 : there is no macroscopic cluster , this corresponds to the gas phase . for @xmath72",
    ", @xmath71 decreases as long as @xmath33 is smaller than a particular size , and then increases exponentially : a macroscopic cluster appears , which indicates the formation of the liquid phase .",
    "the density at the condensation point is then @xmath73 such that @xmath74 .",
    "the results of frenkel s phenomenological model are for the most part the same as those of the mayer s theory of condensation .",
    "the main advantage is that frenkel clusters do not have the pathology of the mayer clusters : the cluster size distribution ( [ fbns ] ) is positive whatever the temperature and density .",
    "however , this model does not allow one to locate the critical point and describe the morphology of the fluid in this state .      as frenkel s model , fisher s droplet model @xcite",
    "is based on the perfect gas of clusters approximation .",
    "however , fisher writes the partition function of the clusters of size @xmath33 with the help of additional features : he allows for the entropy of the clusters , clusters are not assumed to be compact , and a corrective term varying like @xmath75 is added to the free energy of the clusters of size @xmath33 , in addition to the surface and volume terms .    here , we shall not follow fisher s original calculations @xcite .",
    "we rather propose a simplified and more direct way of calculating the partition function of clusters of size @xmath33 @xcite .",
    "let us first write the free energy of the clusters of size @xmath33 .",
    "the mean internal energy and entropy of a cluster of size @xmath54 , with a mean surface area @xmath76 , are written as the sum of a surface and volume term : @xmath77 where @xmath78 and @xmath79 are the volume energy and entropy by particle respectively , and @xmath80 and @xmath81 , the surface energy and entropy by particle .",
    "fisher does not assume the clusters to be compact and introduces a parameter @xmath9 to characterize the mean surface of the clusters of size @xmath33 : @xmath82 the surface of a three - dimensional cluster should lie between the surface of a compact object ( @xmath83 ) and the surface of a chain ( @xmath84 ) .",
    "values of @xmath9 less than @xmath85 are interpreted by fisher as an effective evaluation of the interaction between clusters .",
    "fisher also adds to the free energy a corrective logarithmic term which has no obvious physical interpretation @xcite .",
    "the weight of this term is given by a second parameter @xmath86 .",
    "we shall see later that this term plays a crucial role in this model .",
    "the free energy @xmath87 of a cluster of size @xmath33 is then given by @xmath88 the term proportional to @xmath89 results from the integration over the position of the center of mass of the cluster and @xmath90 is a constant .",
    "the partition function of a cluster of size @xmath33 is eventually given by @xmath91 on the basis of the `` perfect gas of clusters model '' presented in appendix [ sec : pgc ] , the pressure , density , and the cluster size distribution are written as @xmath92 where @xmath93 following fisher , we have introduced the series @xmath94 in eq .",
    "( [ fpkt ] ) and we define the derivative of order @xmath95 by @xmath96 the condensation point is determined by the appearance of a macroscopic cluster .",
    "according to the value of @xmath68 , two cases are possible : if @xmath97 , as in frenkel s model , the density of the condensation point @xmath57 is given by @xmath74 , that is @xmath98 . on the other hand , if @xmath99 , the cluster size distribution increases when @xmath72 and the series ( [ fpkt ] ) and ( [ fro ] ) , which give the pressure and density , diverge .",
    "therefore , condensation only happens when @xmath97 , that is for @xmath100 .",
    "this upper limit on the condensation temperature is interpreted as the critical temperature .",

    "it has to be pointed out that the relation between a power law cluster size distribution and the critical opalescence , observed at the critical point , is not clear today . a cautionary remark : this phenomenon , due to the divergence of the density fluctuations , is explained by thermodynamics without any reference to a geometric description of the fluid @xcite .",

    "from now on , our purpose is to define clusters as self - bound sets of particles . a typical physical situation in which it is relevant to introduce `` self - bound clusters '' is the fragmentation of a piece of matter ( such as an atomic nucleus , an atomic aggregate , or a liquid droplet ) @xcite . in particular , a question of interest is the existence of _ physical _ clusters in a dense medium , before fragmentation occurs .",
    "this topic seems to contrast strongly with the discussion of the last sections .",
    "yet , we shall see how such clusters can shed some light on the geometric interpretation of the liquid - gas phase transition .",
    "self - bound clusters would be stable if they were isolated from each other . in a dense medium , their definition can not rest only on a criterion of proximity in configurational space .",
    "such a definition would make no allowance for the relative motion of the particles . at high temperature ,",
    "two particles that strongly interact are close to each other at a given time . because of their high velocities",
    ", they may quickly move away from each other .",
    "a definition of clusters that takes into account the relative velocities of the particles corrects this inadequacy .    in section [ defself ] , we present two definitions based on energetic criteria which allow us to identify self - bound clusters in a fluid knowing the positions and velocities of the particles .",
    "the first definition is global and based on minimizing the interaction energy between clusters .",
    "the second one is a local energetic criterion of bond activation .",
    "next , we show that coniglio - klein clusters are self - bound on average .",
    "this crucial link between thermodynamics and the morphology of a fluid in the lattice - gas model will provide a geometric interpretation of the liquid - gas phase transition in terms of _ physical _ clusters .",
    "this point will be developed in section [ these ] for a lennard - jones fluid .        at very low density ,",
    "clusters are naturally defined as sets of particles that strongly interact with each other and do not interact ( or only very loosely ) with particles belonging to other clusters .",
    "this is the domain of validity of the perfect gas of clusters model .    in a dense fluid , by an argument of continuity , self - bound clusters can be defined by the partition of particles that minimizes the interaction energy ( in absolute value ) between clusters , or equivalently that minimizes the sum of the clusters internal energies . indeed , the total energy @xmath212 of the system divided in an arbitrary partition of clusters can be written @xmath213 where @xmath214 is a sum over all the clusters , and @xmath215 , @xmath216 , and @xmath217 are respectively the number of particles , the internal energy , and the velocity of the center of mass of cluster @xmath26 . the term @xmath218 is the interaction energy between clusters @xmath26 and @xmath219 .",
    "we then have to find the partition of clusters that minimizes @xmath220 this minimization problem has an exact , but not necessarily unique , solution .",
    "when the number of particles is small enough to enumerate all the possible partitions , a solution can be found easily .",
    "otherwise , we can use two different methods for finding an optimal solution .",
    "the first one was proposed by dorso and randrup @xcite .",
    "it is based on an optimization procedure called `` simulated annealing '' @xcite : consider an arbitrary partition of clusters @xmath31 , a particle is randomly chosen and transferred from its original cluster @xmath26 to another cluster @xmath221 .",
    "of course , the particle remains at the same position in the fluid but we decide that it now belongs to another cluster .",
    "we obtain a new partition @xmath222 .",
    "the variation of the total internal energy between the two partitions is @xmath223 where @xmath224 and @xmath225 are respectively the internal energies of clusters @xmath26 and @xmath221 after the particle has been transferred . if @xmath226 , the partition @xmath222 is accepted . if @xmath227 , the partition @xmath222 is accepted with the probability @xmath228 , where @xmath229 is a control parameter .",
    "the value of @xmath230 is progressively decreased until there is no more modification of the cluster partition on a given number of attempts . as usual with metropolis methods , the total internal energy of the final partition may be only a local minimum .    a second method , denoted  bfm  ( for binary fusion method ) has been developed by puente @xcite : initially",
    ", we suppose that there are only monomers in the fluid .",
    "the multiplicity , which is the number of clusters , is maximal , that is @xmath231 .",
    "then , at each iteration we merge the two clusters that provide the lowest value of the function @xmath232 ( see eq .",
    "( [ ranec ] ) ) .",
    "the multiplicity is then reduced by one at each iteration .",
    "therefore , at the first iteration a dimer is built , at the second either another dimer or a trimer , and so on .",
    "the process stops when the total internal energy can not be reduced any more .",
    "this deterministic method follows a certain trajectory in the phase space of the partitions of clusters that does not necessarily lead to the optimal partition . on the other hand ,",
    "the simulated annealing method can probe the phase space in a probabilistic way , which depends on arbitrary chosen parameters ( like the number of metropolis trials or the way @xmath230 decreases ) . according to their authors ,",
    "these two procedures provide clusters that are stable against particle emission .",
    "the definition of stability against particle emission is presented at the beginning of appendix [ stabhill ] .    by means of numerical simulations of a lennard - jones fluid",
    ", puente @xcite has shown that the simulated annealing and the bfm methods produce very similar cluster size distributions , but the last one is 10 - 20 times faster for the system considered .",
    "however , it has to be noted that both of these methods are very time consuming and can not be used in practice for large systems made up of more than ( say ) @xmath233 particles .",
    "the definition of clusters proposed by hill @xcite rests on a bond activation between pairs of particles . at a given time ,",
    "two particles @xmath4 and @xmath5 , of respective velocities @xmath234 and @xmath235 , are linked if their relative kinetic energy @xmath236 is lower than the negative of their attractive interaction energy @xmath2 : @xmath237 in other words , there is a bond between two particles if they are close enough to each other in the phase space , and not only in the configurational space .",
    "a hill cluster is by definition a set of particles connected by bonds two by two .",
    "when the positions and velocities of the particles are known , for instance by means of molecular dynamics simulations @xcite , this local definition is completely deterministic and does not depend on adjustable parameters .",
    "it has to be noticed that the hill s criterion can be used as well with monte - carlo calculations , although the velocities of the particles are not provided .",
    "indeed , we checked by means of molecular dynamics simulations that mean cluster size distributions are not modified when we replace the velocity of each particle , provided by molecular dynamics simulations , with velocity components taken at random from a gaussian distribution characterized by the temperature of the system @xcite .",
    "as far as mean cluster size distributions are concerned , position - velocity correlations are irrelevant and monte - carlo calculations can be used by allocating to each particle a velocity from a gaussian distribution . of course , time dependent properties and dynamics of the self - bound clusters are investigated only by molecular dynamics simulations .",
    "a question that naturally arises at this point is the comparison between the global ( simulated annealing and bfm ) and the local ( hill ) criterion . performing molecular dynamics calculations with a lennard - jones fluid , campi and his collaborators",
    "@xcite have found that the cluster size distributions obtained with these three definitions are very similar . to quote hill @xcite :  a cluster is [  ] a fairly definite physical concept so that all physically reasonable definitions should lead to rather similar predictions of the cluster size distribution .",
    " however , for a system of @xmath233 particles , hill s criterion is 300 times faster to implement and can be used in practice for much larger systems , as we shall see in section [ these ] .    because it is arduous to carry out an analytical approach by using the hill s criterion",

    "however , following kranendonk and frenkel @xcite , we note that its location for extreme values of the volume fraction , where @xmath9 is the diameter of the particles . ]",

    "indeed , the percolation line starts at @xmath272 , predicting the existence of a percolating cluster in vacuum , and goes to the unphysical value @xmath273 , greater than the close packing volume fraction .",
    "in contrast , monte - carlo simulation predictions show that the percolation line _ starts _ very close to the critical point and goes through the supercritical phase as in the case of a lennard - jones fluid @xcite . according to @xcite",
    ", the prolongation of the percolation line under the coexistence curve should be taken with caution .",

    "ever since mayer proposed his theory of condensation in 1937 , the correspondence between thermodynamics and the morphology of simple fluids in terms of clusters has attracted a lot of interest . in this last section ,",
    "we summarize the various stages of this research area , and close by mentioning some open questions .",
    "initially , the purpose was to introduce clusters as tools in order to calculate the thermodynamic quantities of a classical fluid , and in particular to study the liquid - gas phase transition and the critical point .",
    "to this end , condensation is defined as the formation of a macroscopic cluster . by considering a real fluid as a gas of non - interacting clusters",
    ", one can write the equation of state of the system as a function of the cluster size distribution .",
    "consequently , the mean cluster size varies like the compressibility and then should diverge at , and only at , the thermodynamic critical point .",
    "this is the case by construction for fisher droplets which provide a morphological description of the critical point . but",
    "these phenomenological non - interacting clusters can not be identified as sets of particles in the fluid .",
    "the next step was to find a microscopic definition of clusters that behave like fisher droplets .    in the lattice - gas model",
    ", the problem amounts to finding a definition of clusters that produces a percolation threshold at the critical point .",
    "ising clusters , defined by the simple criterion of proximity in real space , do not fulfill this condition . in contrast , coniglio - klein clusters , whose definition is based on the mathematical work of fortuin and kasteleyn , are explicitly designed to this end . but",
    "this is not the end of the story : coniglio - klein clusters exhibit a percolation behaviour not only at the critical point , but also along the so - called `` kertsz line '' which goes through the supercritical region of the phase diagram . within the context of the perfect gas of clusters model ,",
    "this percolation line should imply forbidden thermodynamic singularities .",
    "however , because coniglio - klein clusters do not form a perfect gas of clusters , there is no valid reason for eliminating the kertsz line .",
    "it remains to give a physical interpretation of this percolation line .",
    "this is what campi and krivine have done by showing that coniglio - klein clusters are self - bound on average .",
    "this interpretation in terms of self - bound clusters opens up a new field of investigation .",
    "self - bound clusters can be studied in the more realistic framework of a lennard - jones fluid .",
    "it is interesting to notice that these clusters were introduced not to provide a correspondence between thermodynamics and geometry , but rather to describe processes like the fragmentation of a piece of matter",
    ". nevertheless , self - bound clusters strikingly present the morphological manifestations associated with the liquid - gas phase transition , and therefore can be considered as the microscopic physical counterparts of the phenomenological fisher droplets .",
    "what is more , self - bound clusters give rise to a percolation line in the supercritical phase .",
    "an important open question , which arises from their definition based on physical grounds , is whether this line could be observed in real fluids .",
    "various real systems behaving like simple fluids can be used to search for signals of the self - bound clusters and the percolation line .",
    "for example , the effusion of a fluid through a pin hole allows one to infer the cluster size distribution from the mass yield of escaped clusters with a given velocity .",
    "hence , the presence of clusters ( dimers and trimers ) was found in the gas phase at very low density @xcite .",
    "however , this kind of experiment seems to be inappropriate to explore a fluid at high density , in the region of the percolation line . on the other hand , experiments dealing with binary fluids ( which belong to the universality class of the @xmath275 ising model @xcite )",
    "were performed to give a morphological description of the critical point in terms of clusters @xcite .",
    "the relationship between these clusters , defined from persistent density fluctuations and the self - bound clusters is not yet understood .",
    "very recently , a sharp decrease of @xmath276 ion mobility in a mixture of isobutyric acid and water has been ascribed to a percolation line of `` dynamic clusters '' which starts at the critical point @xcite . at first glance ,",
    "the vertical position of this curve in the phase diagram would suggest a closer connection with configurational clusters ( see fig . 5 in @xcite ) .",
    "however , the slope of the percolation line of the self - bound clusters may depend on the system considered .",
    "the question of whether these `` dynamic clusters '' are self - bound , still awaits an answer .    from a rather different perspective , the relation between clustering and thermodynamics is critical to the determination of the phase diagram of small systems , like atomic nuclei and aggregates @xcite . in a first approximation ,",
    "the nuclear interaction can be seen as a two body potential with a repulsive hard - core and a short - ranged attraction . by disregarding quantum effects at high enough energy , hot nuclear matter",
    "is thought to behave like a classical simple fluid ( @xcite , and references therein ) .",
    "a crucial question which then arises is whether traces of a liquid - gas phase transition can be observed in an atomic nucleus @xcite ?",
    "a direct observation of such a signal is of course quite arduous in a small system , and today there is still no conclusive answer to this question .    to explore the phase diagram of nuclear matter ,",
    "atomic nuclei are heated and compressed by collisions at high bombarding energy ( about 100 mev / nucleon ) with other nuclei . as a result ,",
    "an excited nucleus expands and breaks into fragments which can be detected using @xmath277 multidetectors ( see references in @xcite ) .",
    "basically , only the fragment size and the kinetic energy distributions can be directly measured .",
    "the challenge is then to infer the thermodynamical state of the system before fragmentation occurs from these two distributions which characterize the asymptotic fragments .    to this end",
    ", several theoretical approaches have been proposed .",
    "`` statistical equilibrium models '' , like the smm @xcite and the mmmc @xcite models , assume that at a given stage of the expansion the system is an ensemble of non - interacting spherical fragments . using the perfect gas of clusters model , and some elements of nuclear physics , these models have been successful in describing the observed fragment size distributions @xcite . however , the kinetic energies are too low compared to experimental data , and worst of all , the strongly restrictive hypotheses of the perfect gas of clusters prevent exploration of the high density region of the phase diagram . on the other hand , classical molecular dynamics simulations of the expansion and fragmentation of a small system allow one to investigate the whole phase diagram @xcite . in this way",
    ", it has been shown that self - bound clusters in the hot and dense fluid are the precursors of the observed fragments @xcite .",
    "in particular , self - bound clusters in the initial system and asymptotic fragments have the same size distribution .",
    "the initial thermodynamic state could be deduced from the measured quantities by using the correspondence between the phase diagram and the self - bound cluster size distribution at equilibrium @xcite .",
    "it must be emphasized that various experiments of fragmentation of atomic nuclei and atomic aggregates @xcite exhibit a percolation behaviour of the fragment size distribution ( u - shapes , power law , and exponentials at respectively low , intermediate , and high energy ) .",
    "finally , beyond the framework of simple fluids , attractive colloidal suspensions display aggregation and dynamic behaviours that could be understood in terms of self - bound clusters . compared with atoms ,",
    "colloidal particles have larger sizes , a slower diffusion , and a range of attraction much smaller than the hard - core diameter @xcite .",
    "these features contribute to form morphological structures that can be visualized by using microscopic imaging @xcite .",
    "we are not aware of a microscopic theoretical description of these clusters .",
    "what is more , percolation lines are frequently observed in attractive colloidal suspensions .",
    "according to the particular physical situation , the percolation threshold is associated with a sharp change in the following quantities @xcite : i ) electrical conductivity in water - in - oil microemulsions @xcite , ii ) viscosity of triblock copolymer micellar solutions @xcite ,",
    "iii ) elastic modulus of dispersions of silica spheres grafted with polymer chains @xcite , and iv ) correlation functions , measured by dynamic light scattering , of dispersions of silica spheres coated with stearyl alcohol @xcite .",
    "it is worth noting that in all these cases the percolation line passes in the vicinity of the critical point .",
    "therefore , clustering seems to be intimately related to the dynamic properties of complex fluids .",
    "clearly , more work is needed in this direction .",
    "i am deeply grateful to my collaborators xavier campi and hubert krivine . during the writing of this article ,",
    "i have benefited from fruitful discussions with antonio coniglio to whom i am thankful .",
    "i wish also to thank donald sprung for making useful remarks about the manuscript .",

    "let us consider a set of non - interacting clusters that do not have any volume .",
    "the @xmath71 indistinguishable clusters of size @xmath33 form a chemical species characterized by their mass @xmath36 , their chemical potential @xmath278 and the partition function @xmath38 .    in the canonical ensemble , at constant volume and temperature ,",

    "equations ( [ moka1])-([moka4 ] ) clearly show that in a perfect gas of clusters model , geometric and thermodynamic quantities must diverge at the same points of the phase diagram .",
    "in particular , the second moment of the cluster size distribution diverges like the compressibility .",
    "to begin , we define the stability against particle emission .",
    "the separation energy @xmath313 is the energy of a particle @xmath4 calculated in the center of mass system of the cluster @xmath314 to which it belongs .",

    "let us now show that probabilistic hill clusters are stable on average against particle emission in the lattice - gas model @xcite .",
    "to this end , we evaluate the average sign of the separation energy . for large enough clusters ,",
    "the velocity of the center of mass can be neglected .",
    "the relative kinetic energy of a particle is then equal to @xmath319 , where @xmath320 is randomly given by the maxwell distribution of variance @xmath321 .",
    "first consider the case of a particle interacting with only one other particle of the cluster .",
    "its separation energy is then given by @xmath322 because the particle belongs to the cluster , we have by definition of a hill s bond @xmath323 . now",
