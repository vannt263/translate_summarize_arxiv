    "in a previous communication  @xcite we used a modified scaling variable @xmath0 and fit for modifications to the grv94 leading order pdfs such that the pdfs describe both high energy low energy e/@xmath23 data . in order to describe low energy data down to the photoproduction limit ( @xmath40 ) , and account for both target mass and higher twist effects , the following modifications of the grv94 lo pdfs are need :    1 .",
    "we increased the @xmath32 ratio at high @xmath30 as described in our previous analysis  @xcite .",
    "2 .   instead of the scaling variable @xmath30 we used the scaling variable @xmath41 ( or = @xmath42 ) .",
    "this modification was used in early fits to slac data  @xcite .",
    "the parameter a provides for an approximate way to include @xmath43 target mass and higher twist effects at high @xmath30 , and the parameter b allows the fit to be used all the way down to the photoproduction limit ( @xmath28=0 ) .",
    "3 .   in addition",
    "as was done in earlier non - qcd based fits  @xcite to low energy data , we multiplied all pdfs by a factor @xmath44=@xmath28 / ( @xmath28 + c ) .",
    "this was done in order for the fits to describe low @xmath2 data in the photoproduction limit , where @xmath45 is related to the photoproduction cross section according to @xmath46 4 .",
    "finally , we froze the evolution of the grv94 pdfs at a value of @xmath47 ( for @xmath48 ) , because grv94 pdfs are only valid down to @xmath49 gev@xmath29 .    in our analyses ,",
    "the measured structure functions were corrected for the bcdms systematic error shift and for the relative normalizations between the slac , bcdms and nmc data  @xcite .",
    "the deuterium data were corrected for nuclear binding effects  @xcite .",
    "a simultaneous fit to both proton and deuteron slac , nmc and bcdms data ( with @xmath50 only ) yields a=1.735 , b=0.624 and c=0.188 ( gev@xmath29 ) with grv94 lo pdfs ( @xmath51 1351/958 dof ) .",
    "note that for @xmath0 the parameter a accounts for @xmath43 target mass and higher twist effects .",
    "in this publication we update our previous studies ,  @xcite which were done with a new improved scaling variable @xmath1 , and fit for modifications to the more modern grv98 lo pdfs such that the pdfs describe both high energy and low energy electron / muon data .",
    "we now also include nmc and h1 94 data at lower @xmath30 . here",
    "we freeze the evolution of the grv98 pdfs at a value of @xmath53 ( for @xmath54 ) , because grv98 pdfs are only valid down to @xmath53 gev@xmath29 .",
    "in addition , we use different photoproduction limit multiplicative factors for valence and sea .",
    "our proposed new scaling variable is based on the following derivation . using energy momentum conservation",
    ", it can be shown that the factional momentum @xmath55 = @xmath56 carried by a quark of 4-mometum @xmath57 in a proton target of mass m and 4-momentum p is given by @xmath55 = @xmath58^{1/2})]$ ] , where    @xmath59+[(q^2+m_f{^2}-m_i{^2})^2   + 4q^2(m_i{^2}+p_{t}^{2})]^{1/2}.$ ]    here @xmath60 is the initial quark mass with average initial transverse momentum @xmath61 and @xmath62 is the mass of the quark in the final state . the above expression for @xmath55",
    "was previously derived  @xcite for the case of @xmath63 .",
    "assuming @xmath64 we use instead :    @xmath65^{1/2})+ax)$ ]    here @xmath62=0 , except for charm - production processes in neutrino scattering for which @xmath62=1.5 gev . for @xmath1 the parameter a is expected to be much smaller than for @xmath0 since now it only accounts for the higher order ( dynamic higher twist ) qcd terms in the form of an @xmath66 target mass term ( the effects of the proton target mass are already taken into account using the exact form in the denominator of @xmath1 ) .",
    "the parameter b accounts for the initial state quark transverse momentum and final state quark @xmath67 @xmath68 ( originating from multi - gluon emission by quarks ) .    using closure considerations  @xcite ( @xmath69the gottfried sum rule )",
    "it can be shown that , at low @xmath2 , the scaling prediction for the @xmath70 quark part of @xmath26 should be multiplied by the factor @xmath44=[1-@xmath71(@xmath28)][1+m(@xmath28 ) ] where @xmath52 = 1/(1+@xmath28/0.71)@xmath72 is the proton elastic form factor , and m(@xmath73 is related to the magnetic elastic form factors of the proton and neutron . at low @xmath2 , [ 1-@xmath71(@xmath28 ) ] is approximately @xmath28/(@xmath28 + c ) with @xmath74 ( versus our fit value c=0.18 with grv94 ) . in order to satisfy the adler sum rule",
    "@xcite we add the function m(@xmath28 ) to account for terms from the magnetic and axial elastic form factors of the nucleon ) .",
    "therefore , we try a more general form @xmath75=[1-@xmath71(@xmath28)][@xmath28+@xmath76/[@xmath28 + @xmath77 , and @xmath78=@xmath28/(@xmath28+@xmath79 ) . using this form with",
    "the grv98 pdfs ( and now also including the very low @xmath30 nmc and h1 94 data in the fit ) we find @xmath80=0.419 , @xmath81=0.223 , and @xmath82=0.544 , @xmath83=0.431 , and @xmath79=0.380 ( all in gev@xmath29 , @xmath51 1235/1200 dof ) .",
    "as expected , a and b are now smaller with respect to our previous fits with grv94 and @xmath0 . with these modifications ,",
    "the grv98 pdfs must also be multiplied by @xmath84=1.011 to @xmath85 to the slac @xmath86 data .",
    "the fit ( figure [ fig : f2fit ] ) yields the following normalizations relative to the slac @xmath86 data ( @xmath87=0.986 , @xmath88=0.964 , @xmath89=0.984 , @xmath90=1.00 , @xmath91=0.993 , @xmath92=0.977 , and bcdms systematic error shift of 1.7).(note , since the grv98 pdfs do not include the charm sea , for @xmath93 gev@xmath29 we add charm production using the photon - gluon fusion model in order to fit the very high @xmath94 hera data .",
    "this is not needed for any of the low energy comparisons but is only needed to describe the highest @xmath94 hera electro and photoproduction data ) .",
    "comparisons of @xmath95 using these modified grv98 pdfs to other data which were @xmath96 @xmath97 in the fit is shown in figures [ fig : predict ] and [ fig : predictd ] . from duality",
    "@xcite considerations , with the @xmath1 scaling variable , the modified grv98 pdfs should also provide a reasonable description of the average value of @xmath26 in the resonance region . figures [ fig : predict](a ) and [ fig : predictd](a ) show a comparison between resonance data ( from slac and jefferson lab , or parametrizations of these data  @xcite ) on protons and deuterons versus the predictions with the standard grv98 pdfs ( lo ) and with our modified grv98 pdfs ( lo+ht ) .",
    "the modified grvb98 pdfs are in good agreement with slac and jlab resonance data down to @xmath98 ( although resonance data were not included in our fits ) .",
    "there is also very good agreement of the @xmath95 of our modified grv98 in the @xmath99 limit with photoproduction data on protons and deuterons as shown in figure [ fig : predict](b ) and [ fig : predictd](b ) . in predicting the photoproduction cross sections on deuterium",
    ", we have applied shadowing corrections  @xcite as shown in figure [ fig : predictd](c ) .",
    "we also compare the @xmath95 with our modified grv98 pdfs ( lo+ht ) to a few representative high energy ccfr @xmath24 and @xmath25 charged - current differential cross sections  @xcite on iron ( neutrino data were not included in our fit ) . in this comparison",
    "we use the pdfs to obtain @xmath45 and @xmath100 and correct for nuclear effects in iron  @xcite . the structure function @xmath101 is obtained by using the @xmath102 fit from reference  @xcite .",
    "there is very good agreement of our @xmath95 with these neutrino data on iron .    in order to have a full description of all charged current @xmath24 and @xmath25 processes , the contribution from quasielastic scattering  @xcite",
    "must be added separately at @xmath103 .",
    "the best prescription is to use our model in the region above the first resonance ( above @xmath104=1.35 gev ) and add the contributions from quasielastic and first resonance  @xcite ( @xmath104=1.23 gev ) separately .",
    "this is because the @xmath105 and @xmath104=1.23 gev regions are dominated by one and two isospin states , and the amplitudes for neutrino versus electron scattering are related via clebsch - gordon rules  @xcite instead of quark charges ( also the v and a couplings are not equal at low @xmath104 and @xmath2 ) . in the region of higher mass resonances ( e.g. @xmath104=1.7 gev )",
    "there is a significant contribution from the deep - inelastic continuum which is not well modeled by the existing fits  @xcite to neutrino resonance data ( and using our modified pdfs should be better ) . for nuclear targets ,",
    "nuclear corrections  @xcite must also be applied .",
    "recent results from jlab indicate that the fe / d ratio in the resonance region is the same as the fe / d ratio from dis data for the same value of @xmath55 ( or @xmath1 ) .",
    "the effects of terms proportional to the muon mass and @xmath106 and @xmath107 structure functions in neutrino scattering are small and are discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite . in the future",
    ", we plan to investigate the effects of including the initial state quark @xmath61 in @xmath1 , and institute further improvements such as allowing for different higher twist parameters for u , d , s , c , b quarks in the sea , and the small difference ( expected in the adler sum rule ) in the @xmath44 factors for axial and vector terms in neutrino scattering .",
    "in addition , we can multiply the pdfs by a modulating function  @xcite a(w,@xmath28 ) to improve modeling in the resonance region ( for hydrogen ) by including ( instead of @xmath108 ) the resonance data  @xcite in the fit .",
    "we can also include resonance data on deuterium  @xcite and heavier nuclear targets in the fit , and low energy neutrino data .",
    "note that because of the effects of experimental resolution and fermi motion  @xcite ( for nuclear targets ) , a description of the average cross section in the resonance region is sufficient for most neutrino experiments .",
    "in leading order qcd ( e.g. grv98 lo pdfs ) , @xmath26 for the scattering of electrons and muons on proton ( or neutron ) targets is given by the sum of quark and anti - quark distributions ( each weighted the square of the quark charges ) : @xmath109\\\\ 2xf_1(x ) & = & f_2(x ) ( 1 + 4mx^2/q^2 ) / ( 1+r_{world}).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here , @xmath102 is parameterized  @xcite by : @xmath110 where @xmath111 . the @xmath102 function provides a good description of the world s data in the @xmath112 and @xmath113 region .",
    "note that the @xmath102 function breaks down below @xmath114 .",
    "therefore , we freeze the function at @xmath115 and introduce the following function for @xmath27 in the @xmath116 region . the new function provides a smooth transition from @xmath115 down to @xmath99 by forcing @xmath27 to approach zero at @xmath99 as expected in the photoproduction limit ( while keeping a @xmath117 behavior at large @xmath2 and matching to @xmath102 at @xmath115 ) .",
    "@xmath118    in the comparison with ccfr charged - current differential cross section on iron , a nuclear correction for iron targets is applied .",
    "we use the following parameterized function , @xmath119 ( fit to experimental electron and muon scattering data for the ratio of iron to deuterium cross sections ) , to convert deuterium structure functions to ( isoscalar ) iron structure functions  @xcite ; @xmath120    for the ratio of deuterium cross sections to cross sections on free nucleons we use the following function obtained from a fit to slac data on the nuclear dependence of electron scattering cross sections  @xcite . @xmath121",
    "this correction is only valid in the @xmath122 region . in neutrino scattering",
    ", we use the same nuclear correction factor for @xmath45 , @xmath100 and @xmath101 .",
    "the @xmath32 correction for the grv98 lo pdfs is obtained from the nmc data for @xmath123 . here , eq .",
    "[ eq : nucl - d ] is used to remove nuclear binding effects in the nmc deuterium @xmath26 data .",
    "the correction term , @xmath124 is obtained by keeping the total valence and sea quarks the same . @xmath125 where the corrected @xmath32 ratio is @xmath126 .",
    "thus , the modified @xmath127 and @xmath128 valence distributions are given by @xmath129 the same formalism is applied to the modified @xmath127 and @xmath128 sea distributions .",
    "accidently , the modified @xmath127 and @xmath128 sea distributions ( based on nmc data ) agree with the nusea data in the range of @xmath30 between 0.1 and 0.4 .",
