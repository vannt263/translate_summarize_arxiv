    "the melnikov method provides tools to determine the persistence of periodic orbits and homoclinic / heteroclinic connections for planar regular systems under non - autonomous periodic perturbations  @xcite .",
    "this persistence is guaranteed by the existence of simple zeros of a certain function , the subharmonic melnikov function and the melnikov function , respectively . in this work",
    "we extend these classical results to a class of piecewise smooth differential equations generalizing a mechanical impact model . in such systems",
    ", the perturbation typically models an external forcing and , hence , affects a second order differential equation .",

    "+ the unperturbed system is defined in two domains separated by a switching manifold where the impacts occur , and possesses one hyperbolic critical point on either side of it .",

    "connect both hyperbolic points , and surround a region completely covered by periodic orbits including the origin . in the second one , we introduce an energy dissipation at the impacts , which is modeled by an algebraic condition that forces the solutions to undergo a discontinuity every time they cross the switching manifold .",
