    "the galaxies in clusters , however , constitute a very small fraction of the gravitational mass of the entire cluster due to the presence of dark matter .",
    "recent high - resolution n - body / hydrodynamical simulations have strongly suggested that dark halos of cluster scales are described by a family of fairly universal density profiles .",
    "navarro , frenk & white ( 1996,1997 , hereafter nfw ) proposed a profile : @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the critical density of the universe at @xmath4 , and @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the concentration parameter and the scaled radius whose explicit fitting formulae as a function of the halo mass @xmath7 and cosmological parameters are found in navarro , frenk & white ( 1997 ) .",
    "this enables one to predict the profiles of the gas and the x - ray surface brightness .",
    "our previous work ( makino , sasaki & suto 1998 , hereafter paper i ) examined the case of the nfw profile proposed , and found that the resulting gas density profile is very close to the empirical model ( [ eq : betaprofile ] ) .",
    "higher - resolution n - body simulations by fukushige & makino ( 1997 ) , however , indicate that the inner density profile of the halo is much steeper than the nfw profile above .",
    "this conclusion was confirmed later by a series of systematic n - body simulations by moore et al .",
    "evans & collett ( 1997 ) show that under some constraints the density profile @xmath8 becomes the stationary solution to the collisionless boltzmann equation .",
    "furthermore , in paper i we assumed the isothermality and the possible effect of the temperature profile was neglected .",
    "the present paper explores these effects in more details and provides several useful working formulae for the x - ray surface brightness profiles as well . in what follows",
    "we describe various theoretical formulation and do not attempt to compare with real observational data .",
    "the comparison with observations in this context has been performed by makino & asano ( 1998 ) , tamura ( 1998 ) , xu et al .",
    "( 1998 ) and markevitch et al . (",
    "while all of their results indicate that the current observational data are consistent with the predictions in the universal density profile , the current data quality in the spatial resolution of x - ray surface brightness and temperature profiles is not sufficient in distinguishing from the empirical @xmath0-model in an unambiguous manner . in this respect ,",
    "upcoming x - ray missions including axaf and xmm should definitely provide us the data suitable for that purpose .",
    "this is mainly why we do not attempt any tentative comparison with the currently available data , but rather present various theoretical predictions which will be useful for future data analysis .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows ; in  2 we describe a new series of analytical solutions for a family of density profiles of dark matter halos generalizing paper i. then we examine effects of self - gravity of the gas in  3 , and non - isothermality by adopting polytropic equation of state in  4 . finally  5 is devoted to discussion and conclusions .",
    "we generalize the nfw profile ( [ eq : nfwprofile ] ) , and consider a family of density profiles describing the dark matter halo : @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the dimensionless radius in units of the characteristic scale @xmath6 .",
    "then the total mass of dark matter halo within the radius @xmath11 is given by @xmath12 with @xmath13 if one neglects the gas and galaxy contributions to the gravitational mass , the gas density profile @xmath14 in hydrostatic equilibrium with the above dark matter potential satisfies @xmath15 where @xmath16 and @xmath17 denote the mean molecular weight of the gas ( we adopt 0.59 below ) and the proton mass , and we assume that the gas temperature @xmath18 is constant over the cluster ( non - isothermal cases are considered in  4 ) .",
    "equation ( [ eq : equilib ] ) can be formally integrated to yield @xmath19 where @xmath20 note that @xmath21 is @xmath22 in terms of the parameter @xmath23 defined in paper i. also @xmath21 is rewritten as @xmath24 in terms of the virial temperature defined as @xmath25 with @xmath26 being a fudge factor ( see paper i ) .    with the density profile of the form ( [ eq : haloprofile ] ) ,",

    "substituting the isothermal density profiles ( [ eq : fx ] ) and ( [ eq : largefx ] ) , equation ( [ eq : sx ] ) reduces to @xmath69 where @xmath70 , and @xmath71 \\over \\sqrt{x^2-\\phi^2 } } ~dx .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] throughout the present paper we consider the x - ray bolometric emissivity , and truncate the gas density at @xmath72 , i.e. , @xmath73 at @xmath74 in evaluating the surface brightness to avoid unphysical divergence .",
    "this is because @xmath75 is typically larger than the virial radius and the gas profile should not be extended at the larger scale .",
    "we integrate equation ( [ eq : sphidef ] ) numerically for @xmath76 , ( 1.0 , 10.0 ) , ( 1.6 , 10.0 ) , and ( 1.6 , 20.0 ) , and the results are plotted in figure [ fig : sphiprof ] .",

    "due to the strong concentration of the dark matter halo in the present models , the resulting gas density profiles are also more concentrated than the conventional @xmath0-model .",
    "in fact , the deviation from the @xmath0-model becomes more appreciable for a larger @xmath45 .",
    "rather we find that the following generalized shape : @xmath80^\\eta } \\ ] ] with @xmath81 provides an excellent fit for @xmath82 and @xmath83 in the range of @xmath84 where @xmath85 .",
    "provided that the assumption of the isothermal gas is valid for actual clusters , our fitting formulae above can be used directly to probe the shape of the dark matter halo ; fitting the observed x - ray surface brightness to equations ( [ eq : sfit ] ) to ( [ eq : paramfiteta ] ) would result in the values of @xmath45 , @xmath6 and @xmath21 from the three fitted parameters @xmath86 , @xmath87 and @xmath88 .",
    "in addition if the gas temperature @xmath18 is measured from x - ray spectroscopic observations , the concentration parameter @xmath5 is determined via equation ( [ eq : bdef ] ) .",
    "incidentally let us note that our fitting formulae ( [ eq : sfit ] ) are not unique in the sense that the three parameters @xmath89 , @xmath87 and @xmath88 are correlated and written in terms of the two independent parameters @xmath45 and @xmath21 .",
    "in particular , @xmath89 and @xmath87 are strongly correlated , and we would obtain an equally good fitting formula by changing these two appropriately . on the other hand , @xmath88 is relatively insensitive to the choice of @xmath89 or @xmath87 .    applying the procedure described above to three lensing clusters ( a2163 , a2218 and rx j1347.5 - 1145 ) , makino & asano ( 1998 ) showed that the dark matter profile with @xmath90 is consistent with the _ rosat _ hri x - ray surface brightness profiles , and that @xmath91 is preferred in order for the x - ray mass estimate to be consistent with their giant arcs .",
    "tamura ( 1998 ) also reached the similar conclusion on the basis of asca / rosat observation of a1060 .",

    "we plot the gas density profiles including the effect of self - gravity in figure [ fig : rhomgasgravprof]a . with increasing the gas fraction or @xmath98 ,",
    "the gas density profile becomes steeper at large radii where the self - gravity of gas becomes significant compared with that of dark matter and confines the gas itself more strongly .",

    "so the gas fractions of clusters in the present models increase roughly in proportional to @xmath108 in the inner region . for larger @xmath108 , on the other hand ,",
    "the behavior is sensitive to the values of @xmath21 and @xmath98 .",

    "also note that the gas mass fraction does not level off anywhere . since the gas mass fraction provides an important constraint on the density parameter @xmath112 ( e.g. , white et al . 1993 ) , this indicates the need for the quantitative comparison on the basis of the numerical integration of the above equation . as discussed in  6 ,",
    "this methodology is feasible under the generalized halo potential model .",
    "in the discussion above , we have assumed the isothermal gas distribution .",
