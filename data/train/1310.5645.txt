    "during the late 1990ies several massless and massive two - loop calculations in quantum chromodynamics reached a complexity , see e.g. @xcite , which made it necessary to introduce new functions a systematic manner to represent the analytic results in an adequate form .",
    "dilogarithms , polylogarithms @xcite and nielsen integrals @xcite with complicated arguments did not allow to perform further calculations .",
    "due to this harmonic sums , resp .",
    "specific types of mellin transforms , were independently introduced in @xcite and @xcite as the basic building blocks . shortly after the harmonic polylogarithms over the alphabet @xmath0 were found @xcite .",
    "these are iterated integrals of the volterra - type having been studied by poincar @xcite more than 100 years before .",
    "physics expressions , such as massless and massive wilson coefficients in the asymptotic region to 2-loops , can be expressed in terms of harmonic sums only @xcite .",
    "this also applies to the 3-loop anomalous dimensions @xcite .",
    "however , in the calculation of the massless 3-loop wilson coefficients in deep - inelastic scattering @xcite , resp .",
    "the massive case @xcite , generalized harmonic sums , also called s - sums @xcite , emerge at least in intermediate results . for massive 3-loop graphs @xmath1 and @xmath2 root of unity weights contribute . at the side of the nested sums they belong to the cyclotomic harmonic sums @xcite .",
    "furthermore , root - valued letters occur in the alphabets of iterated integrals @xcite .",
    "they correspond to binomially - weighted generalized cyclotomic sums . finally ,",
    "also elliptic integrals emerge in the calculation of massive feynman diagrams @xcite .",
    "special numbers are associated to the above nested sums in the limit @xmath3 and the iterated integrals for @xmath4 . in the simplest case",
    "these are the multiple zeta values ( mzvs ) @xcite .",
    "it is obvious , that more structures are expected to contribute calculating feynman diagrams at even higher loops and for more legs . in this article",
    "we give a brief survey on the structures having been found so far .",
    "the _ method _ to unravel these structures consists in applying modern summation techniques to the multiply nested sums , through which the corresponding feynman diagrams are represented , and to solve them in difference fields using the algorithms @xcite being encoded in the mathematica - package sigma @xcite .",
    "harmonic sums obey quasi - shuffle algebras @xcite as harmonic polylogarithms obey shuffle algebras .",
    "these are implied by their multiplication relations at equal argument @xmath19 resp . @xmath20 .",
    "the shuffle product is given by the sum of all permutations of indices of the two sets , which preserve the original ordering . in case of the quasi - shuffle ( stuffle @xcite ) algebras",
    "additional terms occur , cf .  @xcite .",
    "the product of two harmonic polylogarithms is thus given by @xmath21 the stuffle and shuffle relations imply relations between the harmonic sums and harmonic polylogarithms , respectively , which do not depend on their arguments @xmath19 and @xmath20 and are called algebraic relations @xcite . both these algebras can also be applied to the multiple zeta values .",
    "their action is not identical .",
    "the algebraic relations are not the only relations of the harmonic sums or polylogarithms .",
    "other relations concern the argument of these quantities and are sometimes only valid for sub - classes of indices .",

    "the denominators @xmath41 and @xmath42 appearing in the harmonic polylogarithms form the first two cyclotomic polynomials @xcite . one may extend the alphabet in allowing all cyclotomic polynomials @xcite .",

    "a few early examples of mellin transforms of cyclotomic polylogarithms were given in @xcite .",
    "iterating these letters one forms the cyclotomic polylogarithms which obey a shuffle algebra . applying the mellin transform ( [ eqmel ] )",
    "one obtains combinations of the cyclotomic harmonic sums and the associated constants . as an extension of the normal harmonic sums ,",

    "they have been studied for cyclotomy @xmath60 in @xcite .",
    "generalized harmonic sums are defined by @xcite @xmath61 the corresponding iterated integrals are built over the alphabet @xmath62 . to also associate the constants , i.e. the sums in the limit @xmath3 , one has to restrict the range of weights @xmath63 accordingly to obtain convergent expressions . in intermediate physics results ,",
    "however , divergent sums for @xmath64 do occur and have to be dealt with @xcite .",
    "known examples refer to alphabets @xmath65 .   in some applications the weights @xmath66 are general real numbers .",
    "one may generalize the sums ( [ eq3 ] ) introducing cyclotomic denominators @xcite @xmath67 with @xmath68 also these sums are related to the corresponding polylogarithms by the inverse mellin transform .",
    "the elements of both spaces obey ( quasi)shuffle relations and a series of structural relations which were worked out in ref .",
    "@xcite . an even wider class of special numbers is associated to the generalized ( cyclotomic ) harmonic sums and polylogarithms . a convenient way to work with these and the more special functions being listed above is provided by the mathematica - package harmonicsums @xcite .",
    "in case of some feynman diagrams @xcite contributing to the massive wilson coefficient for the structure function @xmath69 at higher scales of @xmath70 at 3-loop order further extensions of weighted generalized cyclotomic sums occur  : @xmath71 \\nonumber\\\\ & & + \\frac{\\zeta_2}{2 } \\int_0 ^ 1 dx \\frac{(-x)^n-1}{x+1 } \\sqrt{\\frac{x}{8+x}}\\left[{\\rm h}^*_{12}(x ) -2 { \\rm h}^*_{13}(x)\\right ] + c_3 \\int_0 ^ 1 dx \\frac{(-8x)^n-1}{x+\\frac{1}{8 } } \\sqrt{\\frac{x}{1-x}}~ , \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath72 the iterated integrals @xmath73 are defined here on the interval @xmath74 $ ] .",
    "the new element consists in binomial @xmath75 terms emerging both in the numerators and denominators of the finite nested sums . about @xmath76",

    "( [ eq : bins1 ] ) .",
    "nested binomial sums , weighting generalized cyclotomic sums , lead to square - root values letters .",
    "one may now imagine that mellin convolutions of these quantities do also emerge , as it happens already for ordinary harmonic polylogarithms .",
    "let us consider a simple case of this kind  : @xmath77\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] it involves the elliptic integrals @xmath78 on the other hand , the mellin transform of @xmath79 yields the following simple expression .",
    "@xmath80(n ) = \\int_0 ^ 1 dx x^n t(x ) = \\frac{4^{2n}}{\\displaystyle \\binom{2n}{n}^2   ( n+\\tfrac{1}{2})^2}~.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] higher powers of the binomial @xmath81 emerge in mellin space , which are seemingly one source of elliptic integrals in @xmath20-space .",
    "one has to contest , that the @xmath19-space expression is more simple here .",
    "in mellin space one may thoroughly perform the solution of the qcd evolution equations analytically , cf .",
    "e.g. @xcite .",
    "the convolution of the wilson coefficients with the evolved parton distribution functions is given by a simple product .",
    "this representation is therefore preferred in fitting the non - perturbative parton distribution functions . on the numerical side only one final contour integral around the singularities of the problem has to be performed .",
    "this requests the analytic continuation of the variable @xmath19 in the nested sums to @xmath82 . observing the crossing relations of the respective process the analytic continuation proceeds either from the even _ or _ the odd values of @xmath19 .",
    "first the singularities in the complex plane have to be determined . for the harmonic sums and cyclotomic harmonic sums",
    "the singularities are located at the non - positive integers and one obtains meromorphic functions .",
    "this is not necessarily the case for generalized sums since they may diverge in some cases exponentially as @xmath3 .",
    "whenever an asymptotic expansion exists , it can be calculated analytically @xcite and thus be given at arbitrary precision in principle .",
    "starting with this representation , the shift - property of the nested sums for @xmath83 allows to arrive at any non - singular point in the complex plane using a thoroughly analytic representation to be evaluated numerically .",
    "physical quantities like the massless and the known massive wilson coefficients and massive operator matrix elements @xcite possess regular asymptotic representations . for these quantities",
    "a corresponding representation is therefore possible .",
    "this also applies for the wilson coefficients of the drell - yan process , hadronic higgs - boson production @xcite and time - like quantities @xcite .",
    "furthermore , precise representations can be derived also in case cross sections are given numerically only , cf .",
    "the mathematical functions expressing feynman diagrams in @xmath19-space form a hierarchy starting with rational functions , harmonic sums , followed by generalized harmonic sums , cyclotomic sums , their generalization , binomially weighted generalized cyclotomic sums , etc . accordingly , the corresponding iterated integrals and special numbers are organized .",
    "the relations of the different quantities can be illustrated by figure  1 @xcite .",
