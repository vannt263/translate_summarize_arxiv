    "the phenomenon of metal - insulator transition in solids has been a subject of great interest for over five decades and still continues to be a subject of intense research activity@xcite .",
    "the phenomenon has been observed in a large number of insulators and semiconductors as the lattice is compressed@xcite .",
    "thus a basic theoretical model for studying the metal - insulator transition has been the study of electronic properties of a solid whose lattice constant is varied . for odd number of electrons per cell , this is a well - known problem first analyzed by mott@xcite . here",
    "a metal to insulator transition occurs on lattice expansion due to electron - electron interactions . for even number of electrons per cell , at a given lattice",
    "constant the solid can be a metal or an insulator depending on the band structure .",
    "in this situation the change of lattice constant leads to movement of band edges , which can lead to opening or closing of the energy gap between the valence and conduction bands .",
    "mott @xcite pointed out that even for such a transition , the electron - hole correlations play an important role .",
    "he argued that a low density of electrons and holes can not exist , as in this situation the screening is weak and electrons and holes would pair up to form excitons . over the years the conditions for formation of excitons and possibilities of intervening exciton - condensed phases have been studied by a number of authors @xcite-@xcite . from these studies",
    "a complex scenario for transition from insulator to metal phase emerges under different conditions of band closing .    in this work we theoretically study metal - insulator transition in tetrahedral semiconductors si , gaas and insb under lattice change maintaining the diamond structure . for these solids ,",
    "the metallic phase occurs both under compression as well as expansion . here",
    "we focus on the transition on expansion , where the metal phase results due to the closing of the hybridization gap . as is well known that at equilibrium lattice constant the s- and p - states mix and give rise to a hybridization gap with four bonding s - p states below the gap and four antibonding states above the gap , which results in an insulating state @xcite . on expansion",
    ", the s - p hybridization weakens and the band gap closes resulting in the atomic like ordering of bands which consists of partly filled p - like band at large atomic separations .",
    "however , at the band picture level , a new scenario for the transition emerges . the metal phase does not occur immediately following the band closing , but requires a considerable further expansion .",
    "the results show that the insulating phase is separated from the metal phase by a substantial range of lattice constant over which the system is an insulator with zero band gap .    in this paper , we present detailed band structure calculations for the above materials .",
    "we give simple physical arguments based on symmetry and tight - binding considerations to understand the peculiar existence of the zero- gap insulating phase over a rather wide range of lattice parameter .",
    "all the calculations are done within the density functional formalism with local density approximation@xcite .",
    "thus the electron - hole correlation effects mentioned above have not been incorporated in the calculation yet .",
    "we also present calculations of some dielectric properties .",
    "we have chosen to examine the behavior of the imaginary part of the zero - wavevector dielectric function , @xmath4 .",
    "on the metallic side ^ ( ) = 4 ^ ( ) where @xmath5 denotes the real part of frequency dependent conductivity . on the insulating side",
    ", @xmath4 behaves at low frequencies ( allowing for lifetime to the electronic states ) as , ^ ( ) = a the constant @xmath6 is seen to be proportional to the static dielectric constant @xmath7 by dispersion relation .",
    "thus on each side of the transition , coefficients of the main @xmath8-dependent term show critical behavior . for a continuous transition one may hope to find some universal relation between these critical behaviors .",
    "accordingly , on the metal side we have calculated the dc conductivity and find its critical behavior as the transition is approached . on the insulating side we have calculated the band gap and the imaginary part of the frequency - dependent dielectric function at zero wavevector . from this",
    "we obtain the critical behaviour of the dielectric constant .    the paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    ", we describe the calculational procedure for the various quantities computed here .",
    "this is followed by a section containing results and their interpretation .",
    "finally we close the paper with a discussion of the results , some speculations and concluding remarks .",
    "for calculating the band structure , we use the full potential linearized augmented plane wave(fp - lapw ) method @xcite with the wien code @xcite",
    ". the essential features of the calculational procedure are : ( i ) the unit cell is divided into two parts , atomic spheres and interstitial regions .",
    "the basis set is built by functions which are atom - like wavefunctions within atomic spheres , and plane waves in the interstitial regions .",
    "the kohn - sham orbitals of dft are now expanded in terms of this basis set .",
    "( ii ) a modified tetrahedron method is used to do integrations over the brillouin zone .    these eigenenergies and eigenfunctions",
    "are used to calculate the band parameters and response functions mentioned above . on the metallic side",
    ", we calculate the dc conductivity , @xmath9 , using the formula _",
    "dc = e^2 3 _ n , k v^2_n , ( e_n , - e_f ) where @xmath10 is the energy eigenvalue and @xmath11 , is the velocity for the eigenstate with quantum numbers @xmath12 .",
    "@xmath0 denotes the transport relaxation rate , which is taken to be state- independent here .    on the insulating side",
    ", we calculate the energy gap and the imaginary part of the zero - wavevector dielectric constant , @xmath13 as function of frequency , @xmath8 . for a crystalline solid ,",
    "the dielectric constant is a matrix of the form , @xmath14 , where @xmath15 and @xmath16 are reciprocal lattice vectors .",
    "however , here we calculate only the diagonal part corresponding to @xmath17 , which amounts to neglecting the local effects .",
    "the diagonal part is expected to contain the more significant aspects of the critical behavior . for @xmath18 , @xmath13",
    "is obtained from , ^ ( ) = 4 e^2 m^2 ^2 _ , i , f |<i,|p_x|,f>|^2 f_i ( 1 - f_f ) 1 ( e_f - e_i - ) ^2 + ^2 where @xmath19 denotes the @xmath20-component of momentum operator , and @xmath21 denotes the occupation number of the state @xmath22 .",
    "note that we have allowed for a finite lifetime , @xmath23 , to the transition between the states @xcite , which changes the usual @xmath24-function to the lorentzian . using dispersion relations ,",
    "we can obtain in principle , the real part of the dielectric function as well from this calculation .",
    "but since our calculations are limited to a small range in frequency , we are able to obtain information only about the static dielectric constant .",
    "we first present the results for gaas .",
    "for the sake of simplicity these results do not include the effects of spin - orbit interaction(so ) @xcite .",
    "fig.1 shows the band structure plots for four values of the lattice constant , @xmath25 .",
    "since we are discussing the situation at zero temperature , we take the zero of energy to be the highest occupied level , labelled as @xmath26 . fig .",
    "1(a ) corresponds to equilibrium lattice constant @xmath27 .",
    "as @xmath25 is increased , the direct gap begins to decrease , closing at @xmath28 , which is shown in panel ( b ) .",
    "the next panel ( c ) shows the band structure at @xmath29 .",
    "one notes here that though there is considerable movement of bands , the fermi level @xmath26 remains stuck at @xmath30 .",
    "this situation continues till @xmath31 , where the lowest conduction band touches @xmath26 at @xmath32 as shown in fig .",
    "thus the system persists as a zero - gap insulator over the lattice constant range from @xmath28 to @xmath33 .",
    "thereafter the system becomes metallic with density of states at @xmath26 rising rapidly . in fig .",
    "2 , we show the plots of the density of states ( dos ) at 4 corresponding values of the lattice parameter . in fig",
    ". 2(b ) and ( c ) the dos around @xmath26 is nonzero but too small to be seen in the figures .",
    "these plots further confirm the zero band gap state persisting in the entire region from @xmath28 to @xmath33 .",
    "3 shows band structure results for si for four values of lattice constant . fig .",
    "3(a ) shows the results for the equilibrium lattice constant @xmath34 . here",
    "the smallest band gap is between the valence band at @xmath0 and the conduction band around x in @xmath0-x direction . in fig .",
    "3(b ) at @xmath35 , one sees that the direct gap at @xmath0 becomes the smallest . with further expansion at @xmath36 , the direct gap closes as seen in fig .",
    "thereafter the system stays in the zero gap state till @xmath37 , where the conduction band at l touches @xmath26 as seen in fig .",
    "the density of states for si on lattice expansion shows behavior similar to that of gaas and hence is not shown here .",
    "the calculation confirms that the zero gap condition occurs over the range @xmath38 to @xmath39 in this case .",
    "we now provide some arguments that enable us to understand this peculiar behavior in terms of the symmetry of the structure and the symmetry of the atomic orbitals involved in the formation of the relevant bands .",
    "we present these arguments in terms of tight - binding ( tb ) considerations @xcite . for gaas ,",
    "the unit cell has two atoms per cell to be denoted as @xmath40 and @xmath25 , each with a tetrahedral surrounding of the unlike atoms . for si ,",
    "the two atoms are identical but are taken to belong to different sublattices @xmath40 and @xmath25 . for a reasonable description of the band structure of these solids",
    "we require a minimum of eight orbitals , one s- and three p - orbitals of each c and a atoms .",
    "these are labeled as : @xmath41 , and @xmath42 . for details",
    "we refer to the book by harrison@xcite .    using the tb method we can easily understand the degeneracies of the eight bands at symmetry points like @xmath0 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 and in symmetry directions like @xmath45 etc .",
    ", as due to symmetry the tight - binding hamiltonian matrix@xcite is simplified and is reducible . at @xmath46point , we have two s - type levels @xmath47 and two p - type levels @xmath30 each with a degeneracy of three .",
    "these eight levels along with their degeneracies denoted by d , are given by@xcite @xmath48^{\\hf } \\ ; d=1 \\\\ e_p^{1,2}(\\gamma_{15 } )   & = & { \\ep^c_p + \\ep^a_p \\over 2 } \\pm \\big [ \\big ( { \\ep^c_p - \\ep^a_p \\over 2 } \\big ) ^2 + 16 m_{xx}^2 \\big ] ^{\\hf } \\ ; d=3 \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] at @xmath43 point , we have four hybridized @xmath49 levels and two p - type levels of degeneracy two each corresponding to orbitals @xmath50 and @xmath51 , given by @xmath52^{\\hf } \\;\\ ; d=1 \\\\ e_{sp}^{3,4 } & = & { \\ep^a_s + \\ep^c_p \\over 2 } \\pm \\big [ \\big ( { \\ep^c_p - \\ep^a_s \\over 2 } \\big)^2 + 16 m_{sp}^2 \\big ] ^{\\hf } \\;\\ ; d=1 \\\\ e_p^{1,2 } & = & { \\ep^c_p + \\ep^a_p \\over 2 } \\pm \\big [ \\big ( { \\ep^c_p - \\ep^a_p \\over 2 } \\big ) ^2 + 16 m_{xy}^2 \\big ] ^{\\hf } \\;\\ ; d=2\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath53 denote the energies of the four atomic levels involved , and m s denote the combinations of matrix elements between orbitals on the neighboring atoms .",
    "the tb parameters @xmath54 etc .",
    "are taken from ref.@xcite .",
    "qualitatively the band structures of gaas and si obtained by using tb method are similar to that shown in figs . 1 and 3 respectively and",
    "therefore are not shown here .    for si ,",
    "the four sp - levels become a set of two degenerate levels at x point . along the @xmath55 line",
    ", we have a set of four @xmath49 hybridized levels made up from orbitals @xmath56 and @xmath57 , which have been labelled @xmath58 , @xmath59 , @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
    "the other four orbitals @xmath62 form a set of two doubly degenerate levels labelled as @xmath63 and @xmath64 . a very similar structure exists for l point and on the @xmath65 line . here again the two s - orbitals hybridize with two linear combinations of p - orbitals ( the combination which points along the cube diagonal for each a and c atoms ) to give rise to a set of four sp - hybridized levels .",
    "the remaining four p - orbitals with combinations that point in the two perpendicular directions to the cube diagonal , then split into a set of two doubly degenerate levels .",
    "since these features of the bands are a result of basic lattice symmetry , this degeneracy structure is seen in the full calculation shown in figs . 1 and 3 .",
    "further note that the bands @xmath58 and @xmath60 have an upward curvature , while the bands @xmath60 and @xmath61 have downward curvature with @xmath66 . similarly the bands @xmath64 and @xmath63 curve downwards and upwards respectively .",
    "we can now discuss the relative positioning of these eight bands as the lattice constant is changed .",
    "it suffices to consider the ordering of levels along the symmetry directions @xmath55 and @xmath65 and at the symmetry points @xmath0 , @xmath43 and @xmath32 . at the equilibrium lattice",
    "constant , two bonding sp - hybridized bands @xmath58 and @xmath59 and doubly degenerate bonding p - band @xmath64 are below @xmath26 and the remaining antibonding bands @xmath60 and @xmath61 , and the degenerate band @xmath63 are above @xmath26 . at @xmath0 , @xmath59 and",
    "@xmath61 bands become degenerate respectively to @xmath67 and @xmath68bands giving rise to two three fold degenerate levels @xmath30 . for gaas",
    ", the band gap at @xmath0 is between triply degenerate @xmath30 level and a @xmath60-level @xmath47 .",
    "for si at equilibrium the band gap is indirect between @xmath67 and @xmath69 bands , but after a stretching up to @xmath70 the same ordering as in gaas happens at @xmath0 as seen in fig .",
    "3(b ) . for subsequent expansion both",
    "the solids show same band movements .",
    "as the lattice is expanded , @xmath47 and @xmath30 levels approach each other and at some point they touch leading to a zero gap situation at @xmath0 where one now has a four - fold degeneracy . on further expansion , the band @xmath59 shifts downwards , while the @xmath60 band sticks to @xmath30 to maintain the degeneracy to three . since @xmath59 band and @xmath64 bands curve downwards , while @xmath60 curves upwards , four full bands stay below @xmath26 and the four full bands above .",
    "for some range of lattice expansion this situation persists as the @xmath60 band remains above @xmath30 .",
    "thus the system stays in the zero - gap insulating state . during this range of lattice expansion @xmath60",
    "band shows little movement around @xmath0 but @xmath59 band moves down considerably .",
    "note the ordering of bands at @xmath0 has changed ; both @xmath47 levels are below @xmath26 now . in this situation",
    "the bands have assumed the ordering that one would expect from atomic picture , i.e. the two s - like bands below the two p - like bands .",
    "the metallic state is reached on further expansion when the @xmath60 band bends downwards along @xmath65 line to cross @xmath26 . at this point",
    "an electron like fermi surface near l and a hole like fermi surface around @xmath0 begin to build up leading to a rapid increase in density of states at @xmath26 .",
    "note that the zero - gap state results because the degeneracy at @xmath30 levels has to be maintained at 3 due to the symmetry .",
    "we next give the results for insb , whose optical gap is rather small ( 0.23ev ) .",
    "one therefore expects this peculiar behaviour to occur at smaller expansions which are experimentally feasible .",
    "its band structure at the equilibrium lattice constant @xmath33 is shown in fig .",
    "4(a ) . as in reference 22",
    ", we also find it to have a vanishing gap at the @xmath46point . including spin - orbit coupling",
    "also does not lead to a gap @xcite .",
    "however , the expansion leads to similar zero gap state which persists upto @xmath71 .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "again the metal phase occurs when the conduction band dips to fermi level at the l point , where the gap in equilibrium was 1.4 ev . curiously in si and gaas also , the gap at l point has approximately the same value when the gap at @xmath46point closes . in spite of the small direct band gap in insb , the metallization occurs at about @xmath1 expansion and in this respect it is no different from si or gaas .",
    "it is interesting to note that in si the zero gap state persists for only @xmath72 expansion but in gaas as well as in insb , it lasts over @xmath1 expansion .",
    "this can be attributed to the nature of bonding of these solids ; bonding in si is purely covalent , while in gaas and insb it has some ionic character @xcite .",
    "we have also calculated the band gaps for both gaas and si at lattice parameter values close to @xmath73 and @xmath74 respectively at which their direct gaps vanish . its plot with @xmath75 ( fig .",
    "5 ) shows that the gap variation with lattice parameter is approximately linear in this region .",
    "next we present the calculation of some dielectric properties . figs .",
    "6(a ) and 6(b ) show plots of @xmath4 with @xmath8 for a number of values of @xmath25 close to the transition in gaas and si respectively .",
    "one can see that these plots are linear in the small frequency range(@xmath76 ) with the slopes rising as the transition is approached . in fig .",
    "7 we present a plot of the slope @xmath6 of curves in fig .",
    "6(a ) , which is proportional to static dielectric constant @xmath77 , with @xmath78 . the static dielectric constant is seen to exhibit power law with @xmath78 and diverges as @xmath79 .",
    "_ s t^- the exponent @xmath80 is found to be 1.8@xmath81 for both si and gaas .    on the metal side we have calculated the static conductivity @xmath82 around the transition point and have plotted it with @xmath78 in fig.8(a ) and 8(b ) .",
    "this data can again be fitted to a power law in @xmath78 , where now @xmath83 and @xmath84 denotes the lattice constant at which the system becomes a metal . _",
    "dc t^b the values of the exponent are @xmath85 for gaas and @xmath86 for si . on the basis of this calculation",
    "we can not claim them to be equal , but the calculations are quite limited by numerical accuracy in the regime of small conductivities as counting of small density of states in the brillouin zone is prone to errors .",
    "interestingly these exponents are equal within numerical accuracy to the values obtained for these exponents for csi , which undergoes a continuous metal - insulator transition on lattice compression @xcite .",
    "it is clear from the above analysis that the insulator metal transition and associated peculiar behaviour on lattice expansion results from the features of band structure at points @xmath0 , x and l which are basically governed by the symmetry of the underlying lattice and the symmetry of s and p orbitals .",
    "we expect all s - p bonded tetrahedral semiconductors to show this behaviour . further we emphasize that the transition will occur irrespective of the exchange - correlation potential used , as it is symmetry driven , apart from slight differences in the values of transition point lattice parameters @xmath87 and @xmath84 @xcite . the zero gap state over an extended range of lattice constants is admittedly somewhat hypothetical , as it is based on the assumption that the diamond structure is maintained on expansion . with the weakening of the hybridization , it is not clear if the tetrahedral symmetry would be the preferred one .",
    "however , these peculiar band effects may underlie interesting physics arising from electron - electron interaction and electron - lattice interaction .",
    "we discuss some of these issues below .",
    "an important issue is the role of electron - hole interactions as mentioned in the introduction , which may lead to a new exciton - condensed ground states in systems with small or zero band gaps @xcite .",
    "we first discuss the situation from the insulating side , where knox @xcite argued , that when the binding energy , @xmath88 , of the exciton becomes larger than the energy gap , @xmath89 , there would be a spontaneous formation of excitons .",
    "the binding energy of the exciton is given by , @xmath90 units of rydbergs , where @xmath91 denotes the reduced mass of the electron hole pair in units of electron mass .",
    "when the energy gap is an indirect one , @xmath77 remains finite as the gap closes and the @xmath88 can become larger than @xmath89 resulting in an exciton - condensed phase which is a charge or spin density wave @xcite-@xcite .",
    "however , in the present case the concerned gap is a direct one , which also leads to the divergence of @xmath77 due to different symmetry of the bands across the gap at the @xmath0-point .",
    "thus @xmath89 and @xmath88 both tend to zero as the gap closes .",
    "if one assumes @xmath92 , it is seen that the spontaneous formation of excitons can occur only if @xmath93 .    in the calculations described above",
    ", we have obtained the variations of both @xmath77 and @xmath89 with reduced lattice parameter , @xmath78 .",
    "this yields @xmath94 for both si and gaas . thus the exciton phase does not occur in these materials according to knox criterion .",
    "the possibility of the existence of the exciton instability for the direct gap case has been examined further by going beyond rpa @xcite-@xcite .",
    "inclusion of hartree fock corrections @xcite or the contribution of excitons themselves @xcite to polarisability does not alter the result that the exciton instability does not occur in this situation .",
    "though the knox criterion for the occurrence exciton - condensed state is not satisfied here , we believe that the stability of the zero gap state needs to be examined further , as due to its high polarizability it would be susceptible to other instabilities . distortions of the jahn - teller type that lift the degeneracy of the touching bands at @xmath46point are possible , but their precise nature would depend upon the electron - phonon interaction .",
    "the instability towards distortion is quite evident if we examine the situation from metallic side . here",
    "the electron and hole fermi surfaces are separated by a vector @xmath95 . under conditions of proper nesting",
    "this state could be unstable to a distorted metal state with wavevector @xmath96 .",
    "this matter is under further investigation .",
    "we conclude by remarking that the band structure calculations on tetrahedral semiconductors reported here are indicative of an unusual insulator to metal transition in which there is an intermediate zero - gap state over a considerable stretch of lattice parameter .",
    "several factors like stability of symmetry with expansion , electron - electron interactions and electron phonon interactions would modify the picture given by these calculations .",
    "we feel that there is a good possibility of observing some of these peculiar features , particularly the ones associated with the zero - gap state in insb .",
    "finally we also obtain some common dielectric behaviour in this class of solids .",

    "<S> the solids become metallic at an expansion of @xmath1 to @xmath2 when an electron fermi surface around l - point and a hole fermi surface at @xmath3-point develop . </S>",
    "<S> we provide an understanding of this behavior in terms of arguments based on symmetry and simple tight - binding considerations . </S>",
    "<S> we also report results on the critical behavior of conductivity in the metal phase and the static dielectric constant in the insulating phase and find common behaviour . </S>",
    "<S> we consider the possibility of excitonic phases and distortions which might intervene between insulating and metallic phases . </S>"
