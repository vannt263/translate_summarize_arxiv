    "since 1987 , several globular cluster surveys ( see review by f. camilo and papers by a. possenti , s. ransom and j. hessels , these proceedings ) have confirmed that most of the binary millisecond pulsars ( msps ) in globular clusters ( gcs ) have low - mass white dwarf companions and nearly circular orbits , as observed in the galactic disk .",
    "this is an important confirmation of the evolutionary scenarios proposed by alpar  et  al .",
    "( 1982 ) for the formation of msps .    in gcs , _",
    "exchange encounters _ , which only have a significant probability of occurring in dense stellar environments , occasionally exchange one of the components of a binary system with a typically more massive star .",
    "the exchanges may occur during encounters with either other binaries or with isolated stars . in gcs",
    "such encounters can place isolated neutron stars into binaries with a main sequence ( ms ) star which eventually evolves , `` recycles '' the neutron star , and finally forms a msp@xmath0wd binary system .",
    "such a process explains the anomalously large numbers of msps in gcs ( by mass ) when compared to the galaxy .",
    "if the companion to the low - mass ms star is a previously recycled neutron star , we observe `` irregular '' eclipsing binary pulsars ( see review by p. freire ) .",
    "in this paper we present some preliminary results on a new , unique binary millisecond pulsar , psr  j0514@xmath04002a ( henceforth ngc  1851a ) in the globular cluster ngc  1851 .",
    "this has been found in a new , sensitive 327-mhz survey of globular clusters carried out using the giant metrewave radio telescope ( gmrt ) , at khodad near pune , india .",
    "( 0,2.8 ) ( 0.1,-2.2 )",
    "our use of a low radio frequency for the present pulsar survey is to be contrasted with most recent pulsar surveys , which are carried at higher radio frequencies .",
    "this survey is aimed at faint pulsars with steep spectra , which are unlikely to be detectable in a high - frequency survey .",
    "this particular survey benefits from the large gain of the central array of the gmrt , 4.6  k / jy when used in the phased array mode of the array combiner ( gupta et al .",
    "2000 , prabu 1997 ) .",
    "this produces a beam on the sky with a diameter of about 3 arcminutes .",
    "the number of spectral channels across the available 16-mhz band is 256 .",
    "the sampling time used is 258@xmath3s , each observation consisting of a pair of 72-minute scans containing 2@xmath4 samples . after this time ,",
    "the 14-antenna central array is re - phased using a reference source .",
    "we observed a set of 16 gcs in february 2003 .",
    "the data were written to tape at the gmrt and taken to mcgill university , where they were processed using the borg ( a 104-node beowulf cluster available there for pulsar processing ) running the presto software package ( ransom 2001 ) .",
    "one of the gcs observed was ngc  1851 .",
    "its distance ( @xmath5 ) from the sun is about 12.6  kpc ( cassisi , de santis , & piersimoni 2001 ) , and its galactic coordinates are @xmath6 ( harris 1996)harris / mwgc.dat for an updated version of the table of globular cluster parameters presented in this paper ] .",
    "it is a relatively bright globular cluster ( @xmath7 ) with a very condensed core ( @xmath8 , where @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the tidal and core radii ) .",
    "it is among the ten clusters in the galaxy with the highest central luminosity density ( @xmath11 ) .",
    "( 0,3.5 ) ( -0.3,-0.5 )    in the first scan for ngc  1851 , taken on the 10 of february 2003 , we detected a clear pulsed signal with a period of 4.991 ms ( see figure 1 ) and a dm of 52.15(10 )  @xmath12pc .",
    "analysis of the rotational periods using tempo proved most surprising : the best - fit model ( see figure 2 ) indicates @xmath13 , the most eccentric orbit of any known binary pulsar and many orders of magnitude more eccentric than the typical msp orbit ( for this and following quantities , the number in parenthesis indicates the @xmath14 uncertainty , which we conservatively estimate to be ten times the formal value computed by tempo , as there is still no phase - coherent timing solution for this pulsar ) .",
    "the orbital period @xmath15 is 18.7850(8 ) days , and the semi - major axis of the orbit projected along the line - of - sight ( @xmath16 ) is @xmath17 light seconds .",
    "this implies a minimum companion mass of 0.9  m@xmath2 , assuming a pulsar mass of 1.35  m@xmath2 ( for the median of expected inclinations , 60@xmath18 , the companion mass is 1.1  m@xmath2 ) .",
    "the epoch of periastron @xmath19 is mjd = 52984.46(2 ) , the longitude of periastron @xmath20 is @xmath21 and the rotational period @xmath22 is 4.990576(5 ) ms .",
    "imaging with the gmrt , made during the search and confirmation observations , has shown that the pulsar is located very near the centre of the cluster ( see figure 3 ) , just ouside the 0.06-arcminute core .",
    "the estimated flux density at 327  mhz is about 3.4@xmath230.4 mjy .",
    "( 0,5.0 ) ( -0.1,-1.0 )",
    "all known eccentric ( @xmath24 ) binary pulsars in the disk of the galaxy have relatively massive companions .",
    "this varied set of companions includes blue giants , other neutron stars and heavy wds .",
    "blue giants live only a few myr which is probably not long enough to allow the sustained mass accretion required to spin up a pulsar companion to millisecond spin periods .",
    "this is in accordance with the observations , where the pulsars with massive companions have rotational periods of tens or hundreds of milliseconds .",
    "in addition , the second supernova event , where the giant becomes a massive compact object , is likely to make the orbit significantly eccentric , presuming the binary survives .",
    "since both stars are now compact , tidal circularization is henceforth impossible .",
    "the prolonged episode of stable mass accretion needed to spin up a neutron star to millisecond periods is only possible from evolved lower - mass ms stars .",
    "such large timescales allow effective tidal orbit circularization as well .",
    "this process likely created the msp currently in ngc  1851a , although with a presently unknown low - mass wd companion .",
    "some msp @xmath25 low - mass white dwarf systems found in gcs , like psr  b1802@xmath007 ( @xmath26ms , @xmath27days , @xmath28 , damico et al .",
    "1993 ) can become mildly eccentric due to interactions with other objects in the cluster ( rasio and heggie , 1995 ) .",
    "this is almost certainly not the origin of the present ngc  1851a binary system since its eccentricity is probably too high to be explained by this mechanism .",
    "we are therefore lead to the conclusion that after recycling , ngc  1851a exchanged its former low - mass companion with a more massive object .",
    "this is the first system presenting clear evidence of such a process . a massive star ( the pulsar s present companion ) passed within a distance smaller than about four times the separation of the components of the previous binary system , a not uncommon event in the dense environment of a gc .",
    "the most likely outcome from such an event is the formation of a slightly tighter eccentric binary system containing the two more massive objects ( hut 1996 ) .",
    "the companion of ngc  1851a has a minimum mass of 0.9m@xmath2 and its nature is as yet unclear , it could be either a compact or extended object .",
    "in ngc  1851 , a cluster with an age of @xmath299gyr ( salaris & weiss 2002 ) where 1-m@xmath2 stars are now leaving the main sequence , such objects should be readily detectable by the hst . because of the lengthy episode of msp recycling that preceded its formation , the present ngc  1851a binary system is very likely to be a few gyr younger than the cluster in which it lies .",
    "mathieu , meibom and dolan ( 2004 ) have determined that , for the open cluster ngc  188 ( with an age of 7 gyr and a stellar population similar to that of gcs ) , binary systems containing ms stars with orbital periods larger than 15 days have not yet had time to circularize .",
    "therefore , the observed eccentricity of the ngc  1851a system does not rule out the possibility of the companion being an extended object .",
    "in fact , partial and/or irregular `` eclipses '' from an extended object such as a ms star may explain the apparent flux variability from ngc  1851a .",
    "we have discovered a remarkable 5-ms binary pulsar , the first to be found in the gc ngc  1851 and the first pulsar to be discovered with the gmrt .",
    "its orbit is the most eccentric known for any system containing a pulsar , while its rotational period is much shorter than that of any other pulsar in an eccentric binary system .",
    "this combination of characteristics indicates that , after becoming an msp by accreting matter from a low - mass companion star , this neutron star has almost certainly exchanged it for its present , significantly more massive companion .",
    "this is the most effective way of forming a binary system containing a millisecond pulsar and a black hole , provided black holes exist in gcs .",
    "follow - up studies of this object will allow us to determine the nature of the companion and hopefully measure the masses of both components of this binary system ."
