    "quantum entanglement  @xcite plays an important role in both the foundations of quantum physics and quantum - information processing  @xcite .",
    "moreover , various entangled states have been produced in many experiments for different goals when studying various nonclassical phenomena and their applications  @xcite .",
    "thus , entanglement is a quantum resource , and how to measure and detect entanglement is very crucial for both theoretical investigations and potential practical applications .    for a system of two spin-1/2 particles or a composite system of a spin-1/2 and a spin-1 ,",
    "there are operationally computable entanglement measures such as concurrence  @xcite and negativity  @xcite , but no universal measures have been found for general many - body systems . to overcome this difficulty ,",
    "entanglement witnesses are presented to detect some kinds of entanglement in many - body systems  @xcite .",
    "now it is believed that spin squeezing  @xcite may be useful for this task  @xcite . in a general sense ,",
    "spin - squeezing parameters are multipartite entanglement witnesses . for a class of many - particle states",
    ", it has been proved that the concurrence is linearly related to some squeezing parameters  @xcite .",
    "in fact , spin - squeezing parameters  @xcite could be calculated also in a simple operational fashion , which characterizes multipartite quantum correlations beyond the pairwise entanglement .",
    "another important reason for choosing spin - squeezing parameters as indicators of multipartite correlations is that spin squeezing is relatively easy to generate  @xcite and measure experimentally  @xcite .    besides being a parameter characterizing multipartite correlations , spin squeezing is physically natural for controlling many - body systems .",
    "it is difficult to control a quantum many - body system since its constituents can not be individually addressed . in this sense , one needs to use collective operations , and spin squeezing is one of the most successful approaches for controlling such systems .",
    "for example , creating spin squeezing of an atomic ensemble could result in precision measurements based on many - atom spectroscopy  @xcite .",
    "therefore , we can also regard spin squeezing as a quantum resource since for more than two particles it behaves as two - particle entanglement in controlling and detecting quantum correlations . on this quantum resource",
    ", we need to further consider the effects of decoherence  @xcite .",
    "thus , it is important to study the environment - induced decoherence effects on both spin squeezing and multipartite entanglement  @xcite . a decaying time evolution of the spin squeezing under decoherence  @xcite can be used to analyze whether this quantum resource is robust .",
    "in this article we address this problem by calculating three spin - squeezing parameters for a spin ensemble in a collective excited state .",
    "we study the time evolution of spin squeezing under local decoherence , acting independently and equally on each spin . here , the irreversible processes are modelled as three decoherence channels : the amplitude damping , pure dephasing and depolarizing channels .",
    "we find that , similar to the sudden death of pairwise entanglement  @xcite , spin squeezing can also suddenly vanish with different lifetimes for some decoherence channels , showing in general different vanishing times in multipartite correlations in quantum many - body systems .",
    "thus , similar to the discovery of pairwise entanglement sudden death ( esd )  @xcite , the spin - squeezing sudden death ( sssd ) occurs due to decoherence .",
    "we will see that for some initial states , the sssd never occurs under the amplitude - damping channel .",
    "we also give analytical expressions for the vanishing time of spin squeezing and pairwise entanglement .",
    "the esd has been tested experimentally  @xcite and we also expect that the sssd can also be realized experimentally .    this article is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we introduce the initial state from the one - axis twisting hamiltonian and then , in sec .",
    "iii , the decoherence channels . in sec .",
    "iv , we list three parameters of spin squeezing and discuss the relations among them . for a necessary comparison , the concurrence is also calculated .",
    "we also study initial - state squeezing . in sec .",
    "v , we study three different types of spin squeezing and concurrence under three different decoherence channels .",
    "both analytical and numerical results are given .",
    "we conclude in sec .  vi .",
    "we consider an ensemble of @xmath0 spin-1/2 particles with ground state @xmath1 and excited state @xmath2 this system has exchange symmetry , and its dynamical properties can be described by the collective operators @xmath3 for @xmath4 here , @xmath5 are the pauli matrices for the @xmath6th qubit . to study the decoherence of spin squeezing , we choose a state which is initially squeezed . one typical class of such spin - squeezed states is the one - axis twisting collective spin state  @xcite , @xmath7 which could be prepared by the one - axis twisting hamiltonian @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the _ one - axis twist angle _ and @xmath10 is the coupling constant . for this state , it was proved  @xcite that the spin squeezing @xmath11  @xcite and the concurrence @xmath12",
    "@xcite are equivalent since there exists a linear relation @xmath13 between them .",
    "physically , they occur and disappear simultaneously . the spin squeezing of this state can be generated and stored in , e.g. , a two - component bose - einstein condensate  @xcite .",
    "the initial state has an obvious symmetry resulting from eq .",
    "( [ initial ] ) , the so - called even - parity symmetry , which means that only even excitations of spins occur in the state . since @xmath14 define an angular - momentum spinor representation of so(3 ) , the general definitions of spin squeezing for abstract operators @xmath15 and @xmath16 can work well by identifying @xmath17 with the highest weight @xmath18 , which corresponds to the collective ground state @xmath19 indicating that all spins are in the ground state .",
    "the symmetric space is generated by the collective operator @xmath20 acting on the collective ground state .",
    "here , @xmath21 . in others",
    "words , the state is in the maximally symmetric space spanned by the dicke states .",
    "so , the @xmath0 spin-1/2 system behaves like a larger spin-@xmath17 system .",
    "it can be proved that any pure state with exchange symmetry belongs to the above - mentioned symmetric space , but for mixed states the state space can be extended to include a space beyond the symmetric one  @xcite . in the following discussions , we focus on such an extended space .",
    "in fact , after decoherence , not only the symmetric dicke states are populated , but also states with lower symmetry .",
    "so , it is not sufficient to describe the system in only ( @xmath22-dimensional space .",
    "although the maximal symmetry is broken , the exchange symmetry is not affected by the decoherence as each local decoherence equally acts on each spin .",
    "in other words , a state with exchange symmetry does not necessarily belong to the maximally symmetric space .",
    "with only the exchange symmetry , from eq .",
    "( [ qqq ] ) ,  the global expectations or correlations of collective operators are obtained as @xmath23_{+}\\rangle & = & \\frac{n(n-1)}{4}\\langle \\lbrack \\sigma _ { 1x},\\sigma _ { 2y}]_{+}\\rangle .",
    "\\label{s5}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] furthermore , it follows from eq .",
    "( [ square4 ] ) that @xmath24 . \\label{square3}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] these equations show the relations between the global and local expectations and correlations , which are useful in the following calculations .",
    "having introduced the initial state , now we discuss three typical decoherence channels : the amplitude - damping channel ( adc ) , the phase - damping channel ( pdc ) , and the depolarizing channel ( dpc ) .",
    "these channels are prototype models of dissipation relevant in various experimental systems .",
    "they provide `` a revealing caricature of decoherence in realistic physical situations , with all inessential mathematical details stripped away ''  @xcite .",
    "but yet this `` caricature of decoherence '' leads to theoretical predictions being often in good agreement with experimental data .",
    "examples include multiphoton systems , ion traps , atomic ensembles , or a solid - state spin systems such as quantum dots or nv diamonds , where qubits are encoded in electron or nuclear spins .    here",
    ", we briefly describe only a few of such implementations .",
    "the adc is defined as @xmath25 where @xmath26 are the kraus operators , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , and @xmath29 is the damping rate . in the bloch representation , the adc squeezes the bloch sphere into an ellipsoid and shifts it toward the north pole .",
    "the radius in the @xmath30 plane is reduced by a factor @xmath31 , while in the @xmath32 direction it is reduced by a factor @xmath33 .",
    "the adc is a prototype model of a dissipative interaction between a qubit and its environment .",
    "for example , the adc model can be applied to describe the spontaneous emission of a photon by a two - level system into an environment of photon or phonon modes at zero ( or very low ) temperature in ( usually ) the weak born - markov approximation .",
    "the adc can also describe processes contributing to @xmath34 relaxation in spin resonance at zero temperature .",
    "note that by introducing an `` upward '' decay ( i.e , a decay toward the south pole of the bloch sphere ) , in addition to the standard `` downward '' decay , the adc can be used to describe dissipation into the environment also at finite temperature .",
    "the adc acting on a system qubit in an unknown state @xmath35 can be implemented in a two - qubit circuit performing a rotation @xmath36 of an ancilla qubit ( initially in the ground state ) controlled by the system qubit and followed by a controlled - not ( cnot ) gate on the system qubit controlled by the ancilla qubit  @xcite .",
    "the parameter @xmath37 is simply related to the probability @xmath38 in eq .",
    "( [ adc ] ) .",
    "the ancilla qubit , which models the environment , is measured after the gate operation .",
    "the adc - induced sudden vanishing of entanglement was first experimentally demonstrated for polarization - encoded qubits  @xcite .",
    "for this reason let us shortly describe this optical implementation of the adc .",
    "it is based on a sagnac - type ring interferometer composed of a polarizing beam splitter and a half - wave plate at an angle corresponding to the parameter @xmath38 in eq .",
    "( [ adc ] ) .",
    "the beam splitter separates an incident beam ( being in a superposition of states with horizontal , @xmath39 , and vertical , @xmath40 , polarizations ) into spatially distinct counter propagating light beams .",
    "the @xmath41 component leaves the interferometer unchanged .",
    "but the @xmath42 component is rotated in the wave plate , which corresponds to probabilistic damping into the @xmath41 component . then , at the exit from the interferometer , this component is probabilistically transmitted or reflected from the beam splitter .",
    "so it is cast into two orthogonal spatial modes corresponding the reservoir states with and without excitation .",
    "the action of the adc can be represented by an interaction hamiltonian  @xcite : @xmath43 , where @xmath44 ( @xmath45 ) and @xmath46 ( @xmath47 ) are annihilation ( creation ) operators of the system and environment oscillators , respectively . in more general models of damping ,",
    "a single oscillator @xmath46 of the reservoir is replaced by a finite or infinite collection of oscillators @xmath48 coupled to the system oscillator with different strengths ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) . for the example of quantum states of motion of ions trapped in a radio - frequency ( paul ) trap ,",
    "the amplitude damping can be modeled by coupling an ion to the motional amplitude reservoir described by the above multioscillator hamiltonian  @xcite .",
    "the high - temperature reservoir is possible to simulate by applying ( on trap electrodes ) a random uniform electric field with spectral amplitude at the ion motional frequency  @xcite .",
    "the zero - temperature reservoir can be simulated by laser cooling combined with spontaneous raman scattering  @xcite .",
    "the pdc is a prototype model of dephasing or pure decoherence , i.e. , loss of coherence of a two - level state without any loss of system s energy .",
    "the pdc is described by the map @xmath49 and obviously the three kraus operators are given by @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the identity operator .",
    "for the pdc , there is no energy change and a loss of decoherence occurs with probability @xmath52 as a result of the action of the pdc , the bloch sphere is compressed by a factor @xmath53 in the @xmath30 plane .    in analogy to the adc , the pdc can be considered as an interaction between two oscillators ( modes ) representing system and environment as described by the interaction hamiltonian : @xmath54  @xcite . in more general phase - damping models , a single environmental mode @xmath46 is usually replaced by an infinite collection of modes @xmath55 coupled , with various strengths , to mode @xmath44 .",
    "it is evident that the action of the pdc is nondissipative .",
    "it means that , in the standard computational basis @xmath56 and @xmath57 , the diagonal elements of the density matrix @xmath35 remain unchanged , while the off - diagonal elements are suppressed .",
    "moreover , the qubit states @xmath56 and @xmath57 are also unchanged under the action of the pdc , although any superposition of them ( i.e. , any point in the bloch sphere , except the poles ) becomes entangled with the environment .",
    "the pdc can be interpreted as elastic scattering between a ( two - level ) system and a reservoir .",
    "it is also a model of coupling a system with a noisy environment via a quantum nondemolition ( qnd ) interaction .",
    "note that spin squeezing of atomic ensembles can be generated via qnd measurements  @xcite .",
    "so modeling the spin - squeezing decoherence via the pdc can be relevant in this context .",
    "the pdc is also a suitable model to describe @xmath58 relaxation in spin resonance .",
    "this in contrast to modeling @xmath34 relaxation via the adc .    a circuit modeling the pdc can be realized as a simplified version of the circuit for the adc , discussed in the previous subsection , obtained by removing the cnot gate  @xcite .",
    "then , the angle @xmath37 in the controlled rotation gate @xmath36 is related to the probability @xmath38 in eq .",
    "( [ pdc ] ) .",
    "the sudden vanishing of entanglement under the pdc was first experimentally observed in ref .",
    "this optical implementation of the pdc was based on the same system as the above - mentioned sagnac interferometer for the adc but with an additional half - wave plate at a @xmath59 angle in one of the outgoing modes .",
    "some specific kinds of pdcs can be realized in a more straightforward manner .",
    "for example , in experiments with trapped ions , the motional pdc can be implemented just by modulating the trap frequency , which changes the phase of the harmonic motion of ions  @xcite ( for a review see ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the definition of the dpc is given via the map @xmath60 where @xmath61 are the kraus operators . by using the following identity @xmath62we",
    "obtain @xmath63 where @xmath64 .",
    "we see that for the dpc , the spin is unchanged with probability @xmath65 or it is depolarized to the maximally mixed state @xmath66with probability @xmath52 it is seen that due to the action of the dpc , the radius of the bloch sphere is reduced by a factor @xmath33 , but its shape remains unchanged .    formally , the action of the dpc on a qubit in an unknown state @xmath35 can be implemented in a three - qubit circuit composed of two cnot gates with two auxiliary qubits initially in mixed states @xmath67 which model the environment .",
    "qubit @xmath68 controls the other qubits via the cnot gates  @xcite .",
    "the dpc map can also be implemented by applying each of the pauli operators @xmath69 $ ] at random with the same probability . using this approach , optical dpcs",
    "have been realized experimentally both in free space  @xcite and in fibers  @xcite , where qubits are associated with polarization states of single photons . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the dpc was implemented by using a pair of equal electro - optical pockels cells .",
    "one of them was performing a @xmath70 gate and the other a @xmath71 gate .",
    "the simultaneous action of both @xmath70 and @xmath71 corresponds to a @xmath71 gate .",
    "the cells were driven ( with a mutual delay of @xmath72 ) by a continuous - wave periodic square - wave electric field with a variable pulse duration @xmath73 , so the total depolarizing process lasted 2@xmath73 for each period .",
    "analogous procedures can be implemented in other systems , including collective spin states of atomic ensembles .",
    "the coherent manipulation of atomic spin states by applying off - resonantly coherent pulses of light is a basic operation used in many applications  @xcite .",
    "we must admit that the standard methods enable rotations in the bloch sphere of only classical spin states ( i.e. , coherent spin states ) .",
    "nevertheless , recently  @xcite an experimental method has been developed to rotate also spin - squeezed states .",
    "it is worth noting that in experimental realizations of decoherence channels ( e.g , in ion - trap systems  @xcite ) , sufficient resources for complete quantum tomography are provided even for imperfect preparation of input states and the imperfect measurements of output states from the channels .",
    "now , we discuss several parameters of spin squeezing and give several relations among them .",
    "to compare spin squeezing with pairwise entanglement , we also give the definition of concurrence .",
    "we notice that most previous investigations on esd of concurrence were only carried out for two - particle system rather than for two - particle subsystem embedded in a larger system . for the initial states , spin - squeezing parameters and concurrence",
    "are also given below .",
    "there are several spin - squeezing parameters , but we list only three typical and related ones as follows  @xcite : @xmath74 here , the minimization in the first equation is over all directions denoted by @xmath75 perpendicular to the mean spin direction @xmath76 ; @xmath77 is the minimum eigenvalue of the matrix  @xcite @xmath78 where @xmath79 is the covariance matrix and @xmath80 $ ] with @xmath81 is the global correlation matrix .",
    "the parameters @xmath82 and @xmath83 were defined by kitagawa and ueda @xcite , wineland _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , and tth _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , respectively . if @xmath84 @xmath85 spin squeezing occurs , and we can safely say that the multipartite state is entangled  @xcite . although we can not say that the squeezed state via the parameter @xmath86 is entangled , it is indeed closely related to quantum entanglement  @xcite .      we know from sec",
    ".  ii.a that the initial state has an even parity and that the mean spin direction is along the @xmath32 direction . during the transmission through all the three decoherence channels discussed here , the mean spin direction does not change . for states with a well - defined parity ( even or odd )",
    ", the spin - squeezing parameter @xmath11 was found to be @xcite @xmath87 then , the parameter @xmath88 given by eq .",

    "we now express the squeezing parameters in terms of local expectations and correlations , and also examine the meaning of @xmath94 , which will be clear by substituting eqs .",
    "( [ qqq ] ) and ( [ square4 ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ zzz ] ) , @xmath95 thus , the parameter @xmath94 is simply related to the correlation @xmath96 along the @xmath32 direction .",
    "a negative correlation @xmath97 is equivalent to @xmath98 it is already known that the spin - squeezing parameter @xmath99 can be written as @xcite @xmath100 where @xmath101 is the correlation function in the direction perpendicular to the mean spin direction .",
    "so , the spin squeezing @xmath102 is equivalent to the negative pairwise correlations @xmath103  @xcite .",
    "thus , from the above analysis , spin squeezing and negative correlations are closely connected to each other .",
    "the parameter @xmath104 indicates that spin squeezing occurs along the @xmath32 direction , and @xmath105 implies spin squeezing along the direction perpendicular to the mean spin direction .",
    "furthermore , from eq .",
    "( [ xixixi ] ) , a competition between the transverse and longitudinal correlations is evident .    by substituting eqs .",
    "( [ s6 ] ) and ( [ square2 ] ) to eq .",
    "( [ xixi1 ] ) , one can obtain the expression of @xmath11 in terms of local correlations @xmath106 and @xmath107 as follows : @xmath108 the second equality in eq .",

    "( [ qqq ] ) , ( [ square3 ] ) , and ( [ zzzz ] ) , one finds @xmath109 thus , we have reexpressed the squeezing parameters in terms of local correlations and expectations .      in order to characterize spin squeezing more conveniently , we define the following squeezing parameters : @xmath110 this definition is similar to the expression of the concurrence given below .",
    "spin squeezing appears when @xmath111 , and there is no squeezing when @xmath112 vanishes .",
    "thus , the definition of the first parameter @xmath113 has a clear meaning , namely , it is the _ strength _ of the negative correlations as seen from eq .",
    "( [ perp ] ) .",
    "the larger is @xmath114 , the larger is the strength of the negative correlation , and the larger of is the squeezing .",

    "@xcite .    here , we give a few comments on the spin - squeezing parameter @xmath118 , which represents a competition between @xmath11 and @xmath119 : the state is squeezed according to the definition of @xmath120 if @xmath121 .",
    "we further note that  @xcite @xmath122 where @xmath123 is the linear entropy of one spin and it can be used to quantify the entanglement of pure states  @xcite .",
    "so , there is a competition between the strength of negative correlations and the linear entropy @xmath124 in the parameter @xmath125 and @xmath126 implies the appearance of squeezing .",
    "it has been found that the concurrence is closely related to spin squeezing  @xcite .",
    "here , we consider its behavior under various decoherence channels .",

    "to summarize , for a spin ensemble in a typical spin - squeezing initial state under three different decoherence channels , we have studied spin squeezing with three different parameters in comparison with the pairwise entanglement quantified by the concurrence .",
    "when the subsystems of the correlated system decay asymptotically in time , the spin - squeezing parameter @xmath175 also decays asymptotically in time for all three types of decoherence .",

    "@xcite , the method developed in this article can be readily applied to study spin squeezing under these decoherence channels .",
    "our investigations show the widespread occurrence of sudden death phenomena in many - body quantum correlations .",
    "since there exists different vanishing times for different squeezing parameters , spin squeezing offers a possible way to detect the total spin correlation and their quantum fluctuations with distinguishable time scales .",
