    "the ultimate reason why the quantum theory gives rise to a host of puzzling and fascinating phenomena is because many - particle quantum systems are defined in a high - dimensional and abstract configuration space .",
    "for example , in a system of identical particles , only those wave functions whose probability density in the configuration space remains unchanged under permutations of particles are acceptable .",
    "when this happens , it is said that the system has exchange interaction .",
    "one consequence of the exchange interaction is the pauli repulsion , that forces electrons to avoid common positions . + a typical scenario for discussing exchange and tunneling",
    "is shown in the scheme of .",
    "two electrons with the same energy and opposite momentum are injected simultaneously from two different sources . during the interaction with a tunneling barrier , the initial one - particle state in the physical space splits into a transmitted and a reflected part . at the final time , transmitted and reflected components coincide in the same spatial region and the pauli repulsion becomes relevant . within the ( landau )",
    "fermi liquid theory @xcite , the type of scattering experiments depicted in are analyzed by assuming that the ( quasi - particle ) electrons are described by a one - particle mono - energetic scattering state @xcite .",
    "the creation and annihilation operators in the second quantization formalism provide a very elegant and powerful formalism to construct the slater determinant combination .",
    "the ( anti - symmetrical ) initial many - electron state with one electron at each side of the barrier is defined by @xmath0 .",
    "the scattering theory for mono - energetic states predicts that the probability of finding one electron on the left and one electron on the right of the barrier is :    @xmath1    where the upperindex @xmath2 indicates scattering formalism .",
    "equivalently , the probability of finding both electrons on the left is : @xmath3 and both electrons on the right is : @xmath4    the explicit computation of these probabilities is done in [ app0 ] .",
    "the scenario shown in can also be interpreted as a type of two - particle interference hong - ou - mandel ( hom ) experiment analyzed some time ago for photons @xcite .",
    "the same scattering formalism ( with the proper commutations properties for the creation and annihilation operators ) has been also used to successfully analyze this type of hom experiments for electrons @xcite . + in order to properly explain the motivation and originality of the present work , we differentiate three basic steps in the computation of ( two or many - particle ) scattering processes .",
    "the first step is the definition of the initial state .",
    "the second is the computation of its time - evolution .",
    "the third step is providing observable results .",
    "each one of these steps has its own conceptual and practical difficulties . in this work",
    ", we will not discuss the difficulties related to the last step , i.e. the measurement of the electrons after being scattered .",
    "we will assume a simple position measurement of electrons at the final time .",
    "the difficulties in the second step are mainly due to the many - body problem . from a computational point of view , the solution of the wave function associated to a large amount of interacting identical electrons in the high - dimensional configuration space is totally inaccessible .",
    "approximations are mandatory .",
    "one example is the computations of the evolution of the many - body wave function through the so - called _ time - dependent variational principle_. this approach have been widely applied in the literature for _ fermionic molecular dynamics _ @xcite .",
    "another example is the full configuration interaction procedure that is able to solve the many - body time evolution by an ( infinite ) linear combination of slater determinants made up from one - particle basis states .",
    "a much simpler approximation is based on the concept of quasi - particles .",
    "it has been shown that a unique slater determinant of one - particle wave functions is still able to capture most of the physics of quantum many - body problems @xcite .",
    "the concept of one - particle wave function that still captures many - body correlations has been deduced by oriols et al .",
    "@xcite through the use of the conditional wave function . strictly speaking ,",
    "such quasi - particle states are no longer interpreted as a mathematical base of the system , but as a close representation of the _ physical _ wave function .",
    "+ we discuss now the first step , i.e. the definition of the initial state .",
    "let us notice that in many experiments the difficulties of the first step simply disappear because the system departs from equilibrium ( i.e. the initial state is the minimum energy ground state ) . in other types of experiments ,",
    "some controlled preparation of the initial state is possible .",
    "for example , by measuring the system at the initial time , the wave function collapses into an eigenstate of the measured eigenvalue .",
    "unfortunately , the definition of the initial state is not so obvious in most scattering experiments .",
    "for example , in mesoscopic physics , the battery imposes far from equilibrium conditions and there is no controlled preparation of the initial state . in principle",
    ", one can expect some type of localization of the initial state because of the decoherence effects in the leads .",
    "on the other hand , it seems reasonable to expect that the initial quasi - particle wave packet has either positive or negative momentum ( to be able to travel from the battery till the device active region ) . clearly , the initial state has to be defined somewhere between two limits .",
    "the first limit is assuming that the ( quasi-)electrons are described by point - like states in real space ( very narrow wave packets ) .",
    "this limit seems quite unphysical .",
    "the other limit is describing ( quasi-)electrons by point - like states in the momentum space ( infinitely space extended wave packets ) .",
    "this second limit has been demonstrated to be very successful in the literature .",
    "the celebrated scattering probabilities presented above in equations , and fit within this second limit .",
    "however , due to the uncertainty principle , a perfectly defined momentum implies an infinitely extended wave function in real space .",
    "therefore , it seems reasonable to expect that the initial state is some type of intermediate state between a point - like state in real space and point - like state in momentum space ( probably , quite close to the typical point - like states in momentum state , but not exactly identical to them ) . in the context of scattering in mesoscopic physics , similar ideas",
    "have been discussed previously by landauer and martin @xcite . finally , let us notice that in many scenarios associating initial states to mathematical basis can be misleading .",
    "for example , in the context of rutherford scattering , van boxen _",
    "noticed that one must take care in calculating observables using only these basis states , because they can present misleading results when comparing to experiment.@xcite + with this motivation , our work analyzes the mentioned two - particle scattering experiment using general localized time - dependent wave packets as initial one - particle states .",
    "we compute the probability of detecting two electrons at the same side of the barrier from the anti - symmetric ( slater determinant ) solution of the time - dependent schrdinger equation in the configuration space .",
    "we anticipate that in many scenarios ( double and single barrier ) the probability of finding two identically injected electrons at the same side of the barrier differs from zero ( contrarily to what is found in expressions , and for time - independent scattering eigenstates ) .",
    "our results are in qualitative agreement with the recent experiment of bocquillon _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , where unexpected non - zero probabilities of detecting both electrons at the same side of the barriers were obtained .",
    "they used single - electron sources in order to ensure that two spatially localized wave packets with disjoint support were prepared at the initial time .",
    "in addition , non - zero probabilities were also found when beams of electrons were used by liu _",
    "_ in a similar experiment @xcite , our work suggests that these non - zero probabilities are not due to experimental spurious effects . , but due to the fundamental wave packet nature of the electrons present in such experiments .",
    "let us mention that the concept of quasi - particle wave packets was used by kohn et al .",
    "@xcite some years ago when analyzing the effect of the physical borders on localized ( not infinite ) systems .",
    "for the same reason , it is interesting to notice the work of loudon @xcite who studied the role of the exchange interaction on the scattering probabilities from a slater - determinant of quasi - particle wave packets .",
    "+ finally , let us clarify that in time - independent computations of scattering processes , as the ones in expressions , and , the difficulties of step two to determine the time evolution disappear ( or equivalently the difficulties about the initial state and its evolution are packed simultaneously ) .",
    "there are , however , several argumentations in the literature in favor of time - dependent formalisms with wave packets to properly treat quantum transport .",
    "vignale and di ventra argue that the landauer - bttiker approach is unable to capture all many - body correlations @xcite .",
    "the works of kurth et al .",
    "@xcite and niehaus and co - workers @xcite ( among many others @xcite ) show how the static density functional theory ( dft ) needs to be generalized to the time - dependent dft to properly account for non - equilibrium quantum transport .",
    "varga showed that the nonequilibirum greens functions approach coupled to static dft is not in agreement with experiments , while the time - propagation of time - dependent dft wave packets provides better results @xcite .",
    "konpka and bokes developed a mixed basis set using stroboscopic wave packets and localized atomic orbitals to deal with interacting fermions @xcite .",
    "many techniques for quantum transport with wave packets have been developed by kramer et al .",
    "finally , the work of godby and co - workers show how the ( kohn - sham ) exchange - correlation potential of the time - dependent dft can be deduced from physical quasi - particle wave packets @xcite .    after this introduction , in we define the general expressions for the probabilities of detecting two electrons . in",
    ", we generalize the previous two - electron probabilities towards many - particle probabilities . in , numerical test for typical tunneling scenarios with symmetric or non - symmetric potentials are presented . among others , to go beyond the fermi liquid picture of ( non - interacting ) electrons , we include a subsection where coulomb interaction among the electrons in a two - particle system is included . additionally , a single barrier potential , which is a physical system closer to the hom experiments mentioned above , is also analyzed numerically .",
    "in all the five scenarios discussed in we obtain clear non - zero probabilities of detecting two electrons at the same side of the barrier .",
    "conclusions are summarized in . in [ app0 ] we develop the two - particle probabilities from the scattering formalism with mono - energetic initial states . in [ app1 ]",
    "we deduce explicitly the two - particle probabilities for wave packet of arbitrary shapes . finally , in [ app2 ] , we explicitly deduce the generalization of the previous two - particle probabilities to many - particle probabilities for tunneling scenarios with a large number of correlated electrons described by arbitrary wave packets .     and from the right @xmath5 of a scattering barrier .",

    "we consider two particles injected from two different sources and impinging upon a tunneling barrier as indicated in figure  [ fig1 ] . in order to simplify the discussion ,",
    "we consider electrons with identical spin orientations . each one is individually defined in a 1d physical space .",
    "the two - particle quantum system can be defined by the ( orbital ) wave function @xmath7 in the 2d configuration space .",
    "such wave function is the solution of the many - particle ( non - relativistic ) schrdinger equation : @xmath8 \\phi , \\label{eq-2dexact}\\ ] ] where @xmath9 is the electron mass and @xmath10 takes into account the two - particle coulomb interaction between the electrons and also the one - particle interaction between one electron and a tunneling barrier .",

    "identical conditions for @xmath15 which is localized at the right . additionally , according to the type of hom experiment discussed here ,",
    "both wave packets have opposite ( central ) momentum so that they impinge upon the barrier after a while , as depicted in figure [ fig1 ] . by construction",
    ", the time evolution of @xmath17 using equation preserves the initial norm and the initial ( anti)symmetry of the wave function .",
    "+ let us notice why it is reasonable to expect non - zero probability for finding both electrons at the same side of the barrier .",
    "the reason is quite simple and intuitive .",
    "pauli principle forbids two fermions being at the same position with the same state @xcite .",
    "however , a pertinent question appears : _ when is reasonable the assumption that the reflected and transmitted states are exactly identical ?",
    "_ certainly , both transmitted and reflected states are identical when only one state is available in the spatial region where they coincide .",
    "this restriction on the available states is evident when the initial state has a unique ( well - defined ) energy @xmath18 i.e. a mono - energetic state .",
    "then , because of the elastic nature of the interaction with the barrier ( i.e. energy conservation ) , only one state at the right of the barrier and one at the left with the same energy @xmath18 ( and the pertinent momentum going outside from the barrier ) are available at the final time",
    ". nevertheless , as stated previously , we require a superposition of mono - energetic eigenstates ( i.e. a wave packet ) to describe an initial state with a spatially localized support outside of the barrier region .",
    "then , in principle , there is the possibility of different time - evolutions for the transmitted and reflected components . in such time - dependent scenarios ,",
    "one can expect probabilities different from zero ( as mentioned before ) as indicated in figures [ fig1](c ) and [ fig1](d ) .",

    "as mentioned in the text , the probability in is just the determinant of the following matrix , @xmath129    @xmath343    where the complex value @xmath125 is a correlation function between single - particle wave packets defined in equation , that we rewrite here as :    @xmath344    where @xmath345 is equal to the reflection coefficient for scattering states @xmath346 if the initial wave packet was at the right of the barrier or equal to @xmath347 if it was at the left side . + a general matrix @xmath105 is defined as positive - semidefinite ( or sometimes nonnegative - definite ) matrix if the scalar product with any vector @xmath348 is always non - negative .",
    "i.e. @xmath349 .",
    "the necessary and sufficient condition to assure that the @xmath134-matrix in is a positive - semidefinite matrix is that the principal minors of the @xmath134-matrix are all non - negative @xcite .",
    "in fact , the first minor represents the probability of having one electron at the right side of the barrier , the second represents the probability of having two electrons and so on .",
    "therefore , by construction these minors are all non - negative and our matrix is a positive - semidefinite matrix .",
    "hence , their eigenvalues are all real and non - negative , since the determinant of the @xmath134-matrix is equal to the product of its eigenvalues .",
    "next step is to rewrite the @xmath134-matrix as follows    @xmath350    where @xmath351 .",
    "we have used the property @xmath128 . using the previous expression",
    "we can show the following identity :    @xmath352    where @xmath353 is just the squared identity matrix of dimension @xmath354 and @xmath355 the inverse matrix of @xmath356 . since the determinant of the second matrix in the left - hand side of expression is just the determinant of the @xmath134-matrix ( see equation ) ,",
    "we obtain    @xmath357    since the matrix @xmath358 is positive - semidefinite , the last term of expression must be non - negative    @xmath359    in addition , the last term on the left in equation must be also positive , because the inverse of a positive - semidefinite matrix is also a positive - semidefinite matrix @xcite and , by definition , we know that it accomplishes @xmath349 for any vector @xmath348 ( for example , @xmath360 ) .",
    "therefore , equation can only fluctuate between 0 and 1 . in this way",
    ", we have proven that    @xmath361    from equation it is trivial to derive equation in the text , being able to compare probabilities with different number of involved electrons .",
    "+ the equality in occurs only when the correlation of the @xmath110-th electron with all the others wave packets is zero , @xmath362 for all @xmath363 . in this case",
    "@xmath364 and the @xmath134-matrix is    @xmath365    whose determinant is @xmath366 . on the contrary , @xmath367 when ,",
    "for example , the @xmath110-th electron and one particular @xmath368-th electron satisfy @xmath369 for all @xmath370 ."
