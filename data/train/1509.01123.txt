    "in the past two decades , consensus problems in multi - agent systems have gained increasing attention in various research communities , ranging from formation of unmanned air vehicles to data fusion of sensor networks , from swarming of animals to synchronization of distributed oscillators @xcite .",
    "the main objective of consensus problems is to design appropriate protocols and algorithms such that the states of a group of agents converge to a consistent value ( see @xcite for a survey of this prolific field ) . in many distributed consensus algorithms ,",
    "the agents update their values as linear combinations of the values of agents with which they can communicate : @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the value of agent @xmath3 and @xmath4 for every discrete time instant @xmath5 represents a _ stochastic _ matrix , i.e. , @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "the states of agents following such linear averaging algorithms tend to get closer over time .",
    "the problem of characterizing the complete sequence of matrices @xmath8 for consensus is however known to be notoriously difficult @xcite .",
    "a moderate goal would be to determine whether the system ( [ 1 ] ) converges to a state of consensus for all sequences of matrices @xmath8 in a certain set @xmath0 .",
    "remarkably , blondel and olshevsky in a recent work @xcite presented an explicit combinatorial condition , which is both necessary and sufficient for consensus of ( [ 1 ] ) in that sense .",
    "this condition , dubbed `` avoiding sets condition '' , is easy to check with an algorithm and thus the consensus problem is decidable .",
    "while most existing works are concerned with global consensus ( namely , all the agents reach a common state ) , in varied real - world applications , there may be multiple consistent states as agents in a network often split into several groups to carry out different cooperative tasks .",
    "typical situations include obstacle avoidance of animal herds , team hunting of predators , social learning under different environments , coordinated military operations , and task allocation over the network between groups .",
    "a possible solution is given by the cluster ( or group ) consensus algorithms @xcite , where the agents in a network are divided into multiple subnetworks and different subnetworks can reach different consistent states asymptotically . evidently , cluster consensus is an extension of ( global ) consensus .",
    "various sufficient conditions and necessary conditions ( although much fewer ) for cluster consensus have been reported in the literature for discrete - time systems @xcite , simple first- or second - order continuous - time systems @xcite , and high - order dynamics @xcite , to name a few . however , most of these conditions rely on either complicated linear matrix inequalities or algebraic conditions involving eigenvalues of the system matrices , which are in general difficult to check .",
    "elaborate algebraic necessary and sufficient conditions have also been obtained for multiconsensus problems , which appear to be a wider class of cluster consensus @xcite .    with the above inspiration",
    ", we aim to work on efficiently verifiable conditions for cluster consensus by extending the results in @xcite for global consensus , which are highly non - trivial .",
    "the main contribution of this paper is to establish a combinatorial necessary and sufficient condition which guarantees the cluster consensus of system ( [ 1 ] ) under some common assumptions ( such as the self - loops and the inter - cluster common influence ) .",
    "some of the previous convergence criteria can be quickly reproduced from our results .",
    "it is noteworthy that the authors in @xcite showed that , under some mild assumptions , the cluster consensus of ( [ 1 ] ) can be achieved provided the graphs associated with @xmath8 contain cluster - spanning trees .",
    "interestingly , our result implies that the cluster - spanning trees condition is essentially necessary .",
    "in this section , some definitions and lemmas on graph theory and matrix theory are given as the preliminaries .",
    "we refer the reader to the textbooks @xcite for more details .",
    "let @xmath9 be a directed graph of order @xmath10 with the set of vertices @xmath11 and the set of edges @xmath12 .",
    "for a stochastic matrix @xmath13 ( namely , @xmath14 and @xmath15 for all @xmath16 ) , a corresponding directed graph @xmath17 can be constructed by taking @xmath18 , and @xmath19 . given a subset @xmath20 , denote by @xmath21 the set of out - neighbors of @xmath22 in @xmath23 , i.e. , @xmath24 .",

    "this is also referred to as _ intra - cluster synchronization _ in @xcite , where the cluster consensus requires additionally the separation of states of agents in different clusters .",
    "nevertheless , the inter - cluster separation can only be realized by incorporating adapted external inputs .",
    "* definition 2 . * @xcite a stochastic matrix @xmath47 is said to have _ inter - cluster common influence _ if for all @xmath35 , @xmath48 is identical with respect to all @xmath44 .",
    "* remark 2 .",
    "* since the entries on each row of @xmath47 sum up to one , the above statement automatically holds for @xmath49 if @xmath47 has inter - cluster common influence .",
    "therefore , @xmath48 depends only on @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "this ( and some closely related variants ) is a common assumption for cluster consensus problems ; see e.g. @xcite .",
    "it is direct to check that if @xmath52 and @xmath53 have inter - cluster common influence with respect to the same clustering @xmath32 , so does @xmath54 .    to analyze the cluster consensus of the multi - agent system ( [ 2 ] ) , we will need to estimate some characteristics of infinite product of stochastic matrices . for a stochastic matrix @xmath13",
    ", we define the cluster ergodicity coefficient with respect to a clustering @xmath32 as @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the @xmath3th row of @xmath47 and @xmath57 represents the 1-norm of vector .",

    "suppose that @xmath30 .",
    "we first recall a useful lemma ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* , lem 1.1 ) ) : for any stochastic matrix @xmath13 and @xmath66 , @xmath67 it follows immediately from ( [ 5 ] ) that @xmath68    denote by @xmath69 and @xmath70 for @xmath71 . hence , @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",
    "fix @xmath74 and @xmath75 . for any @xmath76 ,",
    "we have @xmath77 since @xmath52 has inter - cluster common influence .",
    "accordingly , @xmath78 in view of this relation , we obtain @xmath79    therefore , @xmath80 where the first term on the right - hand side is exactly @xmath81 , while the second term on the right - hand side equals @xmath82 by employing ( [ 5 ] ) .",
    "this completes the proof .",
    "for a compact set @xmath0 of @xmath38 stochastic matrices , we have the following assumptions :    * assumption 1 .",
    "* for all @xmath84 , @xmath85 for @xmath86 .",

    "* there exists some @xmath90 such that @xmath91    * assumption 4 . * for each @xmath84 , @xmath47 is a doubly stochastic matrix , namely , @xmath92 .",
    "* remark 3 .",
    "* the positive diagonal condition in assumption 1 is widely adopted in the existing consensus algorithms , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "it reflects the `` self - confidence '' that agents give positive weights to their own states when updating @xcite , and is also naturally satisfied by any algorithm producing the sampling of a continuous - time process .",
    "the undirected graph condition in assumption 2 plays an important role in a range of consensus problems , where information exchange goes in both directions @xcite .",
    "instances of stochastic matrices with uniformly bounded positive entries ( assumption 3 ) have been extensively investigated in discrete - time consensus with time - varying topologies @xcite . if @xmath0 is finite , this condition is automatically satisfied .",
    "the doubly stochastic property in assumption 4 is important for many cooperative control problems including distributed averaging , optimization , and gossiping @xcite .",
    "a characterization of directed graphs with doubly stochastic adjacency matrix was provided in @xcite .",
    "a key step towards our main result is the following equivalence lemma , which characterizes the cluster consensus set under the above assumptions , and can be seen as a `` clustering '' version of lemma 2.8 @xcite .",
