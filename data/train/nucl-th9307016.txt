    "the skyrme model is a classical non - linear field theory of interest both for itself and because it is a model of qcd in the limit of a large number of colors ( @xmath1 ) @xcite .",
    "it has been studied extensively in the baryon number one and number two sectors @xcite .",
    "recent results for baryon number two ( @xmath2 ) @xcite have shown that careful treatment of the non - linear nature of the equations and of quantum corrections ( finite @xmath1 effects ) , lead to a very good description of the nucleon - nucleon static potential .",
    "one finds one pion exchange , mid - range attraction , a tensor force and short range repulsion , all in substantial agreement with phenomenological potentials , and even with phase shifts @xcite . the next step is the consideration of non - static effects . here",
    "there has been less work @xcite and no systematic study .",
    "in this paper we present the analysis and results of a systematic study of the kinetic energy in the @xmath2 skyrmion system .",
    "we do so in the context of the product ansatz .",
    "this has the advantage of relative algebraic simplicity and of explicit identifiability of the collective coordinates .",
    "its main disadvantage is that it is a poor approximation to the @xmath2 exact solution at small skyrmion separation .",
    "for example , the product ansatz can not model the lowest energy @xmath2 static solution of the skyrme lagrangian in which the baryon density has toroidal symmetry and the identity of the individual skyrmions is completely lost . for the static nucleon - nucleon interaction ,",
    "the product ansatz is particularly dangerous because that interaction is extracted by subtracting two large numbers to get a relatively small one , and even moderate errors in configurations get greatly magnified .",
    "that is why finding the mid - range attraction between nucleons waited for a full solution of the non - linear equations . for the non - static terms",
    "there is no corresponding subtraction and we might expect the product ansatz to be more reliable . however even here",
    "it is far from perfect .",
    "for example we find kinetic energy terms that are embarrassingly large , yet violate parity and particle interchange symmetry .",
    "these are artifacts of this ansatz , that has both these diseases .",
    "such terms would not be present in an exact calculation .",
    "nevertheless , as a first orientation , we calculate in the product ansatz .    in the product ansatz",
    ", the @xmath2 skyrmion system is represented by two @xmath3 skyrmions separated by a distance @xmath4 .",
    "each of these two skyrmions can also be rotated in iso - spin space . for the static system ,",
    "the energy of the @xmath2 state depends on @xmath4 and on the relative iso - spin orientation of the two skyrmions . to study non - static effects",
    ", we make each of these three collective vector coordinates , @xmath4 , and the iso - angle of each skyrmion , time dependent .",
    "now the kinetic energy can depend on any combination of the relative skyrmion velocity and the two angular velocities .",
    "clearly there are no terms in the kinetic energy linear in velocity .",
    "since the skyrme lagrangian is quadratic in time derivatives , the kinetic energy is only bilinear in the velocities . in principle",
    "all possible terms connecting velocities can occur in the kinetic energy , and since there are three vector velocities , the mass matrix will be nine by nine .",
    "the elements of this mass matrix depend on @xmath4 ( both its magnitude and direction ) , and the relative iso - spin orientation of the two skyrmions , and are calculated as integrals over the single skyrmion profile functions .",
    "there are many terms in the expansion of the kinetic energy in the relative iso - orientation .",
    "we find that terms have a steep hierarchy in size with relative iso - orientation , the terms that are independent of orientation being the largest .",
    "we also find , as mentioned above , that not all terms that violate parity and exchange symmetry are zero , due to the faults of the product ansatz .",
    "there are many terms in our expansion . in this paper",
    "we present the algebraic form for all of them but only discuss the largest ones .",
    "after the mass matrix has been constructed , it has to be inverted to pass from a velocity to a canonical momentum form so that a quantum mechanical hamiltonian can be constructed .",
    "we do not carry out that step here and only mention that attention to the requirements of matrix inversion are called for .",
    "we have recently demonstrated @xcite the role that the transformation from velocities to momenta plays in getting the correct sign for the nucleon - nucleon spin - orbit interaction .    in sec .",
    "[ sec:2 ] we define notation , and substitute the @xmath2 product ansatz with time dependent collective coordinates in the skyrme lagrangian .",
    "we then develop the expansion of the terms in the kinetic energy . in sec .",
    "[ sec:3 ] we present the algebraic structure of the results of that expansion .",
    "section [ sec:4 ] discusses and presents graphically the behavior of some of the leading terms in our expansion .",
    "section [ sec:5 ] presents some conclusions .",
    "finally some technical details are given in the appendix .",
    "the main purpose of this paper is to present the full expansion of the kinetic energy both in systematic algebraic form , and as calculated results .",
    "we leave the use of these forms and results in particular physics problems to further publications .",
    "the skyrme model lagrange density can be written as @xcite @xmath5^{2 } \\nonumber\\\\&&+\\frac{f_{\\pi}^2 m_{\\pi}^2}{4 } [ \\mbox{tr}(u+u^{\\dagger})-4 ] ,   \\label{eq : lag}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath6 is the left sugawara variable for the meson field @xmath7 which is a unitary @xmath8 matrix .",
    "there are only three parameters in the lagrangian , @xmath9 , the pion mass , @xmath10 , the pion decay constant , and @xmath11 , a dimensionless constant normally adjusted to give the correct nucleon - delta mass splitting .",
    "it is worth noting that the skyrme lagrangian is quadratic in time derivatives .",
    "the model has a topologically conserved quantum number that skyrme identified as the baryon number , @xmath12 . since the equations of motion derived from ( [ eq : lag ] ) are highly nonlinear , it is not possible , in general , to obtain exact analytical solutions .",
    "the standard time - independent solution to the classical field equations for @xmath3 is the defensive hedgehog , where the pion field points radially outward , @xmath13 the baryon number of this state is given by @xmath14 .",
    "this solution breaks translational invariance , as well as the @xmath15 spin - iso - spin symmetry .",
    "if we perform a global su(2 ) iso - rotation on the state , @xmath16 we obtain a state of the same energy .    for the @xmath2 system , the product ansatz in which @xmath7 is written as a product of two single skyrmions",
    "is often used .",
    "the product ansatz is a poor approximation to the exact solution at short distances but it is expected to be valid when the two skyrmions are far apart .",
    "the advantage of using this ansatz is that , with it , the collective coordinates can be easily identified .",
    "we write @xmath7 for the skyrmion - skyrmion system as @xmath17 with @xmath18 and @xmath19 where @xmath20 and @xmath21 are both single skyrmion solutions , @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the positions of the two skyrmions with a relative distance r. finally @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the @xmath8 iso - rotation matrices for the two skyrmions .",
    "it is often convenient to work with the so - called sugawara variables of a @xmath8 matrix @xmath26 ( which can be @xmath7 , @xmath27,@xmath28 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath29 or @xmath30 ) instead of the matrix itself .",
    "the left sugawara variable is defined as @xmath31 while the right one is @xmath32 the two sets of the sugawara variables are related , @xmath33 it can be shown that both @xmath34 and @xmath35 are traceless .",
    "we can , therefore , express these variables in terms of their three independent components @xmath36 and",
    "@xmath37    it is easy to show that for @xmath7 given in ( [ eq : prdtansatz ] ) : @xmath38 \\tilde{u}_{1}^{\\dagger}.\\ ] ] using the trace formulas @xmath39 and @xmath40[{\\vec}{\\tau}\\cdot{\\vec}{c},{\\vec}{\\tau}\\cdot{\\vec}{d } ] \\right ] = 8({\\vec}{a}\\cdot{\\vec}{d})({\\vec}{b}\\cdot{\\vec}{c})- 8({\\vec}{a}\\cdot{\\vec}{c})({\\vec}{b}\\cdot{\\vec}{d})$ ] , we find for the kinetic energy density @xmath41 where @xmath42 and @xmath43 if we use the hedgehog form for @xmath20 and @xmath21 , we find @xmath44 where @xmath45 and @xmath46 and @xmath47 . in the following",
    "we will use @xmath48 to represent the relative translational velocity .",
    "the quantities @xmath49 and @xmath50 are iso - rotational velocities expressed in terms of the right sugawara variables of the iso - rotation matrices . for isolated skyrmions ,",
    "they are related to the spin operators of the individual skyrmions upon quantization by the relation @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the momenta of inertia for a single skyrmion .",
    "since the iso - rotation matrices @xmath29 and @xmath30 are global rotations , we have for the spatial components of the single skyrmion sugawara variables @xmath53 where @xmath54 and @xmath55 are the wigner @xmath56 functions for @xmath29 and @xmath30 and in terms of the components of the @xmath8 matrix @xmath57 , they are given by @xmath58 it is easy to verify that for single hedgehog skyrmions @xmath20 and",
    "@xmath21 , we have @xmath59 where @xmath60 s , @xmath61 s and @xmath62 s are scalar functions given by @xmath63 in terms of the hedgehog profile function @xmath64 as defined in ( [ eq : profile ] ) and its derivative @xmath65 .    substituting eqs.([eq : hg1]-[eq : hg4 ] ) into ( [ eq",
    ": kt ] ) , we obtain for @xmath66 a sum of terms that are quadratic in the velocity vectors @xmath67 and @xmath50 with coefficients that depend on @xmath68 and the relative iso - rotation matrix @xmath69 .",
    "the kinetic energy is given by the integral over the kinetic energy density @xmath70 the three dimensional integral over all the terms in the expansion of @xmath66 can be reduced to a two dimensional integral by virtue of the axial symmetry around the axis connecting the centers of the two skyrmions .",
    "the integrands of these three dimensional integrals are all of the form @xmath71 where each @xmath72 is a component of the vector @xmath73 and @xmath74 is a non - negative integer .",
    "@xmath75 depends on @xmath76 and the angle @xmath77 between @xmath73 and @xmath4 .",
    "it is easy to see that @xmath78 where we use the notation @xmath79 it can also be shown that @xmath80 and similar relations for integrals over @xmath71 with @xmath81 .",
    "we use these relations to write the kinetic energy as a sum of scalar functions of the velocities , the unit vector @xmath82 of the relative separation of the two skyrmions and of the vector that specifies their relative iso - orientation .",
    "there have been a number of papers dealing with various selected terms in the kinetic energy .",
    "oka and odawara _ et al _ @xcite have studied the inertial parameters for translational motion only by neglecting the time - dependence of iso - rotations of the two skyrmions .",
    "riska and his co - workers @xcite have investigated terms in the kinetic energy that couple the translational velocity with the isorotational velocities and that contribute to the spin - orbit interaction when projected onto nucleon - nucleon states .",
    "a similar study was done by otofuji _",
    "et al _ @xcite .",
    "however , our recent work @xcite has shown that a proper treatment of the spin - orbit interaction requires inversion of the mass matrix before projecting it onto nucleon states .",
    "this can not be done when terms that couple the translational velocity with the isorotational velocities are studied alone . in this work",
    ", we present a complete analysis of the kinetic energy within the product ansatz by expanding it in a set of rotational invariant quadratic functions of the translational and iso - rotational velocities and evaluating all coefficients in the expansion .",
    "the expansion can be conveniently divided into two groups .",
    "the first group , @xmath83 , contains terms involving a set of functions defined over the translational and iso - rotational velocity vectors .",
    "the second group , @xmath84 , is a linear combination of another set of functions defined over the three distinct doublets of the three velocity vectors . in both groups , we order terms by their irreducible representations under the relative skyrmion - skyrmion iso - orientation , @xmath85 .",
    "the terms quadratic in @xmath86 and @xmath87 we call @xmath88 ( for two ) , and those quartic we call @xmath64 ( for four ) .",
    "the @xmath88 s are the set of four dimensional harmonic polynomials of degree two and the @xmath64 s of degree four .",
    "they correspond to the symmetric representations of @xmath15 , @xmath89 and @xmath90 , respectively . since they are the symmetric representation , they have spin equal to iso - spin ( @xmath91 ) , with @xmath88 corresponding to @xmath92 and @xmath64 to @xmath93 .",
    "the symmetric representations of @xmath15 , @xmath94 , may be further distinguished by their grand - spin or @xmath95-spin , @xmath96 , where @xmath95 takes on the values @xmath97 .",
    "this then gives for @xmath88 a scalar term , @xmath98 , a vector term , @xmath99 , and a rank two term @xmath100 .",
    "for the forms quartic in @xmath85 , there are @xmath101 , @xmath102 , @xmath103 , @xmath104 , and @xmath105",
    ". matrix elements of operators of the @xmath64-type vanish between two nucleon states .",

    "the term in @xmath145 is a pure iso - kinetic energy .",
    "since for an individual skyrmion an iso - rotation is equivalent to a spin rotation , this term goes over to the kinetic energy of a freely rotating skyrmion for large @xmath115 .",
    "there @xmath145 is equal to twice the moment of inertia @xmath146 .",
    "all this is seen in fig .  5 where we also see that there is more sensitivity to the pion mass than in the @xmath125 terms , but mostly at small distances where the product ansatz is not to be trusted .",
    "we find that @xmath147 , @xmath148 , and @xmath149 are all quite small except at very small @xmath115 .",
    "@xmath150 , @xmath151 , @xmath152 , and @xmath153 are all of moderate size beyond 1 fm , and show interesting @xmath115 dependence and some sensitivity to the pion mass ( see figs .",
    "@xmath154 ( see fig .",
    "8) is a wrong parity term that is comparable with @xmath150 , @xmath151 , @xmath152 , and @xmath153 .",
    "the next term that is significant beyond 1 fm is @xmath155 .",
    "it is one of the few quartic terms in @xmath85 that is large ( see fig .",
    "it is also remarkably sensitive to the inclusion of a pion mass term .",
    "the remaining quartic terms are small as are the greek letter terms .",
    "the largest of these are @xmath156 and @xmath157 , which we show in fig .",
    "we now turn to the terms in @xmath117 . in these terms",
    "two kinds of velocities are coupled .",
    "we consider first @xmath158 and @xmath159 . again",
    "the contribution with @xmath160 can be obtained from the first by exchanging one and two with the understanding that terms that violate parity are also odd under the interchange .",
    "we find that @xmath161 and @xmath162 are zero .",
    "these terms would violate parity since @xmath118 and @xmath119 behave oppositely under parity .",
    "we find that @xmath163 is relatively large ( see fig .",
    "it is the term principally responsible for iso - spin independent spin - orbit coupling .",
    "it has been calculated before @xcite but our result is about as twice as large as reported there .",
    "more importantly even though we obtain the same sign for @xmath163 as reported in @xcite , a careful conversion from a velocity to a canonical momentum form leads to the correct sign for the spin - orbit interaction , as we have shown in our recent work @xcite .",
    "@xmath164 , @xmath165 and @xmath166 are very small , but @xmath167 and @xmath168 are large at small @xmath115 , and parity violating ( see fig .",
    "@xmath169 , @xmath170 , @xmath171 , @xmath172 and @xmath173 are moderately large , but not as large as @xmath163 , and contribute to the iso - spin dependent spin - orbit interaction ( see figs .",
    "1315 ) .",
    "@xmath174 , @xmath175 and @xmath176 are very large parity violating terms that decay slowly with @xmath115 ( see figs",
    ".  1617 ) .",
    "they are troublesome .",
    "all of the @xmath177 terms ( quartic in @xmath85 ) are essentially zero outside 1 fm . of the greek letter terms ,",
    "@xmath178 , @xmath179 and @xmath180 are parity conserving and large , while @xmath181 and @xmath182 are large , slowly decreasing with @xmath115 and parity violating ( see figs .",
    "1820 ) .",
    "all of the @xmath183 terms ( quartic in @xmath85 ) are very small outside of 1 fm .",
    "finally we consider @xmath117 with @xmath184 and @xmath185 .",
    "we find @xmath186 , @xmath187 , @xmath188 , @xmath189 , @xmath190 , @xmath191 , @xmath192 , @xmath193 , @xmath194 , and @xmath195 all to be very small .",
    "we find @xmath196 , @xmath197 , @xmath198 and @xmath199 to be large ( see figs .  2122 ,",
    "@xmath198 is not plotted since it is equal to @xmath200 as expected from permutation symmetry ) .",
    "they also decay very slowly for large @xmath115 .",
    "analysis shows that they go like @xmath0 for large @xmath115 in the case of zero pion mass .",
    "the remaining terms in @xmath201 and all the terms in @xmath202 ( quartic in @xmath85 ) are small outside 1 fm .",
    "@xmath203 , @xmath204 and @xmath205 are very large and exhibit considerable sensitivity to pion mass ( see fig .",
    "23 , @xmath205 is not plotted since it is equal to @xmath206 as expected from permutation symmetry ) .    and",
    "@xmath207 are large and parity violating ( see fig .",
    "24 , only @xmath208 is plotted since @xmath209 , thus violating permutation symmetry as well ) .",
    "again all the quartic terms , @xmath210 , are small .",
    "in this paper we present a systematic development of the kinetic energy of the @xmath2 skyrmion system starting from the product ansatz .",
    "although this ansatz has serious shortcomings , it provides a useful starting point for a first orientation to the velocity dependent terms in the skyrme energy .",
    "it is particularly easy to identify the collective degrees of freedom in the product ansatz and therefore to make them time dependent . furthermore the problems of the product ansatz in calculating the static energy of the @xmath2 system , namely the subtraction of large numbers to get a small one , are not present in the kinetic energy .",
    "the full kinetic energy of the @xmath2 skyrmion system is a rich and complex expression .",
    "there are three dynamical velocities that enter , the relative velocity of the two skyrmions and the rotational velocity of each .",
    "we have not considered the trivial overall translational velocity of the entire system .",
    "the kinetic energy is bilinear in the velocities and all possible couplings among the three velocity vectors enter , so that the mass matrix is nine by nine .",
    "the kinetic energy is a scalar function of the velocities , the relative separation vector of the two skyrmions and of the vector that specifies their relative iso - orientation .",
    "it is convenient to classify the dependence on iso - orientation in terms of irreducible tensors of definite degree in the relative orientation , @xmath85 .",
    "call that degree @xmath211 .",
    "( it is in fact the @xmath15 quantum number , see appendix ) . we find terms with @xmath212 . the terms with @xmath213 correspond to no iso - orientational dependence and lead to iso - spin independent contributions to the kinetic energy of two nucleons . the terms with @xmath214 lead to kinetic energy terms for two nucleons that have an iso - spin dependence of the form @xmath215",
    "we find that , in general , the @xmath214 terms are smaller for the two skyrmion system than the @xmath213 terms .",
    "the @xmath216 terms are smaller still and have vanishing matrix element in the two nucleon system , but will couple with deltas .",
    "we find that there are some non - zero terms in the expansion of the kinetic energy that are not even under parity and are not symmetric under interchange of the two skyrmions .",
    "these terms are pathological artifacts of the product ansatz that would not be present in an exact calculation .",
    "some of these terms are quite large and fall off very slowly with the separation of the skyrmions , particularly in the case of zero pion mass .",
    "these large terms are particularly worrisome and give an ominous sense of the limits of the product ansatz calculation .",
    "our major purpose is to give a full and systematic discussion of the two skyrmion kinetic energy to serve as a foundation for any discussion of non - static terms in the two skyrmion and two nucleon interaction .",
    "here we only present the full algebraic development of the kinetic energy and some result for the largest terms with their dependence on the relative separation of the skyrmions .",
    "there are many applications of these results that come to mind .",
    "for example the leading non - static contribution to the energy of two nucleons is the spin - orbit interaction .",
    "it arises from the terms in the kinetic energy that couple the relative velocity and the total rotational velocity . to go from these terms to a nucleon - nucleon spin - orbit interaction in a hamiltonian require that the mass matrix be inverted before projecting on nucleon states .",
    "we have recently shown that doing this yields an iso - spin independent spin - orbit interaction of the correct magnitude and sign as well as explaining the relatively small size of the iso - spin dependent spin - orbit interaction @xcite .",
    "there are many more non - static terms in the nuclear force that invite study .",
    "there is also the opportunity to go beyond the product ansatz . here",
    "the problem of defining collective variables comes up .",
    "we are studying this difficult issue .",
    "a starting point , pursued with considerable success in the static energy studies , is to start with the kinetic energy in the two skyrmion channels with reflection symmetry .",
    "this is easily done in the product ansatz and we are studying the advantages of this approach for an exact treatment .    in summary , we have studied the kinetic energy of the @xmath2 skyrmion system in the product ansatz in a systematic expansion in the collective velocitites .",
    "this is a first step in adding non - static corrections to the recent success for the static nucleon - nucleon interaction @xcite calculated in an approach based in non - perturbative qcd .",
    "this research was supported in part by a grant from the u. s. national science foundation .",
    "the expansion of the kinetic energy is a sum of terms quadratic in the translational and isorotational velocities .",
    "the coefficients depend only on the relative isorotation @xmath69 .",
    "since @xmath217 is unitary , the @xmath218 s satisfy @xmath219 the operators @xmath220 form an @xmath15 algebra .",
    "the @xmath221 s generate an @xmath222 subalgebra .",
    "the casimir operator of @xmath15 is @xmath223 and its eigenvalue is @xmath224 .",
    "the casimir operator of the @xmath222 subalgebra is @xmath225 with eigenvalue @xmath226 .",
    "it is easy to show that the following polynomials in the four components of @xmath85 , spherical harmonics of @xmath15 , carry irreducible representations of the group chain @xmath227 :                        the @xmath236 polynomials are quadratic in @xmath85 and carry the irreducible representations @xmath237 of @xmath227 .",
    "they are linear combinations of the matrix elements of the wigner function @xmath238 .",
    "the @xmath239 polynomials are quartic in @xmath85 and carry the irreducible representations @xmath240 of @xmath227 .",
