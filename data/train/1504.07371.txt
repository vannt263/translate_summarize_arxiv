    "<S> another arena of major importance is high - temperature superconductivity , where the nature of magnetic excitations has been intensively debated . </S>",
    "<S> the key point is whether fractional spin excitations , spinons with @xmath0 , are present and essential @xcite , or whether a description in terms of magnons or triplons with integer spin @xmath1 is appropriate @xcite .    theoretically , the physics of undoped cuprates is closely related to the antiferromagnetic @xmath0 heisenberg model on the two - dimensional ( 2d ) square lattice @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this paradigmatic unfrustrated model is known to display long - range nel order with finite sublattice magnetization at zero temperature @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the well - understood low - energy excitations are gapless magnons as enforced by goldstone s theorem @xcite .    remarkably , the magnetic excitations at high energies are understood less well . </S>",
    "<S> but they have come into focus recently due to remarkable experimental progress in resolution @xcite and in the direct excitation at high energies @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> conventional spin - wave ( magnon ) theory in powers of @xmath2 @xcite fails to agree quantitatively with unbiased quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) simulations @xcite and high - order series expansions about the ising limit @xcite . even in third order in @xmath2 , the approach based on magnons yields only a weak dip of the dispersion of about @xmath3 at @xmath4 compared to its value @xmath5 while series expansion and qmc yield about @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> inelastic neutron scattering ( ins ) finds @xmath7 in deuterated copper formate @xcite . in analogy to the similar feature in the dispersion of excitations in @xmath8he @xcite we call this dip ` roton minimum ' .    </S>",

    "<S> the magnons at lower energies would result as confined states of spinon pairs @xcite while the spinons are deconfined at least at certain points in the brillouin zone ( bz ) at higher energies .    the ambiguity between excitations having fractional or integer spin arises in gapless systems because without gap it is an ill - posed problem to determine the content of quasi - particles . </S>",
    "<S> this was for instance seen in one - dimensional ( 1d ) spin chains @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> but in contrast to the 2d case , where magnons are the established goldstone modes above the long - range ordered ground state , the 1d heisenberg chain is known to display fractional massless spinons @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> we provide a quantitative description of the low- and the high - energy part of the dispersion in terms of magnons . </S>",

    "<S> this interaction induces a higgs resonance built from two - magnon states , also addressed as longitudinal magnon @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> thereby , significant weight in the three - magnon continuum is shifted towards lower energies and it can also be seen as magnon - higgs continuum . </S>",
    "<S> these scattering states depress the single magnon states and reduce their energy yielding the roton minimum . in this way , this dip in the dispersion is a fingerprint of strong scattering between magnons and the damped higgs mode .    _ 2d heisenberg model  </S>",

    "<S> remarkably , the cst data at @xmath46 yields a sizable roton minimum of 7% , and the extrapolation to @xmath74 yields 8% . in view of the uncertainties of all approaches , also the high - energy part of the dispersion including the roton minimum is quantitatively reproduced by the cst in terms of magnons .    </S>",
    "<S> _ discussion  _ as long as there are processes linking states with a single elementary excitation , i.e. , a quasi - particle , to states with two or three quasi - particles , the quasi - particles decay into continua of two or three quasi - particles @xcite . for collinear nel order </S>",
    "<S> , the hamiltonian allows only for decay into three quasi - particles . </S>",
    "<S> generally , this hybridization lowers the energy of single quasi - particle states . </S>",
    "<S> a well - studied example is the spin ladder with reflection symmetry where the number of triplons ( the elementary excitations ) can only change by an even number @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the triplon dispersion is pressed down by the three - triplon continuum . in asymmetric spin ladders without reflection symmetry </S>",
    "<S> the single triplon states hybridize already with two - triplon continua . due to the larger phase space of two - triplon states this decay channel </S>",
    "<S> has a larger impact @xcite which is a general feature @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that one must understand the multi - magnon continuum above the single magnon state in order to quantitatively assess the magnon dispersion in general and the roton minimum in particular .    </S>",
    "<S> in gapless systems such as the 2d heisenberg model the continua start just above the single - magnon energies because multi - magnon scattering states can be built from the single magnon and one or two magnons arbitrarily close to @xmath75 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the crucial impact of the continua nearby in energy is mainly driven by the low energy physics defined by terms of low scaling dimension . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the scaling dimension is an appropriate criterion even for a calculation concerned with the high - energy roton minimum .    </S>",
    "<S> the energy lowering due to the hybridization with three - magnon states is less effective as argued in the analogous system of spin ladders . </S>",
    "<S> but an attractive interaction among the magnons shifts spectral weight to lower energies and enhances the impact of the magnon decay . </S>",
    "<S> the marked roton minimum indicates that this is a very important aspect . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , the term @xmath76 contains the attractive interaction @xmath77 between the @xmath78 and @xmath79 magnons living on the @xmath12 ( @xmath80 ) and the @xmath13 sublattice ( @xmath81 ) , respectively @xcite .    . </S>",
    "<S> dotted black line : without interaction , dashed blue line : bare interaction , solid red line : renormalized interaction . </S>",
    "<S> the curves are computed for @xmath82 using the matrix elements of the @xmath46 system and broadened by @xmath83 . </S>",
    "<S> the dispersion is interpolated smoothly , the interaction in a piecewise constant way . ]    the crucial effects of the magnon - magnon attraction are depicted in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : higgs ] where we computed the longitudinal dynamic structure factor @xmath84 in the two - magnon @xmath85 channel without and with ( renormalized ) interaction . </S>",
    "<S> the cst - renormalization of the observable is not included to focus on the pronounced interaction effects . </S>",
    "<S> the attraction leads to a shift of spectral weight to lower energies and , strikingly , to the formation of a resonance which we identify as the higgs resonance . </S>",
    "<S> the position of the resonance at @xmath4 is found to be lower than the one at @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> this is in line with the argument that the single - magnon dispersion is pushed to lower energies more strongly at @xmath4 than at @xmath5 leading to the roton minimum because due to the higgs resonance the decay of a single magnon not only comprises the decay into three rather independent magnons , but also the decay into two constituents : magnon plus higgs resonance . in accord with previous studies </S>",
    "<S> @xcite this is an efficient mechanism to lower the magnon dispersion and to induce the roton minimum .    </S>",
    "<S> the renormalization of the interaction in the cst flow enhances the effect of the attraction further . </S>",
    "<S> though this effect is small in absolute terms it makes itself felt in the size of the roton dip . </S>",
    "<S> if we switch off the flow of the particle conserving interactions , i.e. , without renormalization of the magnon - magnon interaction , the dip of the roton minimum is reduced to @xmath86 . </S>",
    "<S> this also explains why the third order calculation in @xmath2 yielded only a small dip although some interaction effect was included ( diagram ( k ) in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) . still , the roton minimum is insufficiently captured . </S>",
    "<S> note that the renormalization of the interaction can be as large as @xmath87 for certain momenta @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> we emphasize that our line shapes in the longitudinal channel agree remarkably well with the experimental data , see figs .  2c and 2 </S>",
    "<S> g in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this holds for the position of the higgs resonances and for the relative heights . investigating the experimental transverse dynamic structure factor ( figs .  </S>",
    "<S> 2b and 2f in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) one finds pronounced peaks at @xmath4 and at @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> we attribute both of them to magnons and the smaller weight at @xmath4 , combined with a continuum tail , to strong magnon - higgs scattering . </S>",
    "<S> this also shifts the dispersion to lower energies at @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> hence , the roton minimum in the magnon dispersion is a fingerprint of the higgs mode and of strong magnon - higgs scattering .    </S>",
    "<S> _ summary  </S>",
    "<S> _ for the @xmath0 heisenberg antiferromagnet on the square lattice , this letter provides a fully consistent and quantitative picture in terms of magnons which describes the low- and the high - energy physics on equal footing . </S>",
    "<S> it is achieved by extending the approach of continous unitary transformations to continuous similarity transformations . in momentum space , </S>",
    "<S> the flow of the renormalized couplings is closed by the truncation at the level of terms with scaling dimension 2 .    </S>",
    "<S> the striking agreement of our findings with the experimental results @xcite underlines the validity of the magnon quasiparticle picture for long - range ordered quantum magnets at all energies . in this way </S>",
    "<S> , the importance of a significant attractive interaction between magnons of different @xmath88 is established . </S>",
    "<S> this interaction induces a resonance corresponding to the longitudinal magnon or higgs resonance of the symmetry broken phase . </S>",
    "<S> the decay of a magnon into three magnons is strongly enhanced because it is effectively a decay into a magnon and a higgs resonance . </S>",
    "<S> the roton minimum is the fingerprint of this mechanism .    </S>",
    "<S> further studies should address other response functions providing predictions to spectroscopic experiments . </S>",
    "<S> we highlight that the developed approach is applicable to a humongous variety of long - range ordered phases . </S>",
    "<S> it will help to identify their dynamical properties and eventually their instabilities and ensuing transitions towards other exotic quantum phases .    </S>",
