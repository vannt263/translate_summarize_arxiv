    "all our ground ",
    "state wfs give the peak position at about @xmath103  mev which is very close to all experimental findings .",

    "however , for energies @xmath107  mev the error bars in  @xcite are large . on the contrary ,",
    "the @xmath88 ( ) wf , where we have equal weights of @xmath66 and @xmath67 configurations in , leads to an excellent agreement with the shape of the shimoura  _ et  al .",

    "data . finally , the @xmath89 ( ) wf leads to results which are significantly different from those obtained with @xmath88 ( ) .",
    "this may be related to the fact that the corresponding difference in the relative sign of the @xmath66 and @xmath67 components of the wf leads to a change of the internal geometry of the system , and the @xmath108 value in particular , as it is seen from table  [ tab : wfs ] .",
    "thus there exists a sensitivity to the relative sign of the two components in the wf and not only to their weights . in conclusion",
    "we state that this kind of analysis , when applied to a reliable set of experimental emd data , would give valuable information concerning the relative role of the @xmath66 and @xmath67 configurations in the ground state .",
    "[ [ section-1 ] ]    the existing experimental data on are scarce . even such a fundamental quantity as the binding energy is characterized by large uncertanties .",

    "several experiments have indeed confirmed a state around 2  mev in which is assigned having spin  parity @xmath112  @xcite .",
    "however , in order to reproduce the large size and narrow momentum distributions , a large @xmath64wave component is needed in the ground state of  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath64wave potential fitted in  @xcite to reproduce the binding energy , with the known position of the @xmath113 state , leads to an @xmath64wave bound state in which is clearly not observed .",
    "this problem may be connected with the fact that the nucleus has no closed neutron @xmath68shell ( see  @xcite ) and this effect has not been taken into account in  @xcite .",
    "recent experiments still indicate the presence of a low  lying virtual @xmath64wave state in  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , studies of the isobaric analog state of give an @xmath64wave spectroscopic factor of @xmath114  % in the ground state  @xcite which is supported by conclusions made in other experiments  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath73 component of our model wf provides @xmath64motion between all the particles , and we used the @xmath33 component to include some @xmath115motion .",
    "however , since the @xmath33 component leads to a very broad distribution of strength the shape will mainly be determined by the @xmath73 component .",
    "the emd energy spectrum for has recently been measured by labiche _",
    "et  al . _",
    "this experiment was performed at 35  mev / a . in their analysis",
    "the energy spectrum was modeled using the breit  wigner shape with parameters @xmath116  mev and @xmath117  mev , see fig .  2 in  @xcite .",
    "we prefer to compare theory and experiment using strength functions which facilitates comparison with emd cross sections for other nuclei and at other beam energies as well .",
    "we therefore extracted the dipole strength function from the emd spectrum of ref .",

    "[ fig : be14peak ] .",
    "note that the shape of this strength function is very different from those of strength functions of other borromean halo nuclei .",
    "it should also be mentioned that in the experiment  @xcite only and neutrons were detected .",
    "therefore , we should consider the strength function up to the threshold at 3.2  mev because above this energy other reaction channels are open .    in a first step of the analysis we use the position of the peak to check the binding energy . if the ground  state wf has an appreciable @xmath73 weight then ,",
    "as mentioned above , the peak should be positioned at approximately @xmath106 .",
    "as can be seen from fig  [ fig : be14peak](a ) the experimental spectrum would correspond to a binding energy of @xmath118  mev , considerably lower than the tabulated value of 1.34  mev .",
