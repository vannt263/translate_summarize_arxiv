    "scenario  i : : :    as proposed by slater  @xcite and stoner  @xcite , band theory alone    was argued to account for itinerant ferromagnetism . due to the pauli    principle , electrons with parallel spins can not come arbitrarily close    to each other ( `` pauli '' or `` exchange hole '' ) , and , thus , a    ferromagnetic alignment of the electron spins reduces the total    coulomb energy with respect to the paramagnetic situation ( `` exchange    field energy '' ) .",
    "scenario  ii : : :    as emphasized by van vleck  @xcite , electronic correlations are    important in narrow - band materials . due to the strong    electron - electron interaction , charge fluctuations in the atomic    @xmath3  shells",
    "are strongly suppressed ( `` minimum polarity    model '' ) .",
    "the atomic magnetic moments arise due to the local coulomb    interactions ( in particular , hunds - rule couplings ) and the electrons    motion through the crystal may eventually align them at low enough    temperatures .    in principle , such a dispute can be resolved in natural sciences .",
    "the corresponding theories have to be worked out in detail , and their results and predictions have to be compared to experiments .",

    "it calls for a theory of correlated electrons , i.e. , a genuine many - body problem has to be solved .",
    "it was only recently that reliable theoretical tools became available which allow to elucidate scenario  ii in more detail  @xcite .    a first step in this direction was the formulation of appropriate model hamiltonians which allowed to discuss matters concisely , e.g. , the hubbard model  @xcite .",

    "recently , gebhard s approach was generalized by us to the case of multi - band gutzwiller wave functions  @xcite .",
    "thereby , earlier results by bnemann and weber  @xcite , based on a generic extension of the gutzwiller approximation  @xcite , were found to become exact in infinite dimensions  @xcite .    as shown in sect .",

    "self - consistency is usually reached rather quickly , i.e. , @xmath177 is found after three to five iterations .",
    "the global minimum , @xmath178 is found by a search through the space of the external variational parameters keeping the average @xmath3 and @xmath151 occupations .",
    "this search can be sped up by first optimizing with respect to the most important external variational parameter which is the isotropic exchange splitting  @xmath179 , putting the difference to zero as a first approximation .    in a second step ,",
    "the anisotropy of the exchange splitting is investigated ,",
    "i.e. , we introduce @xmath180 and @xmath181 in the minimization procedure , keeping @xmath182 at the value of @xmath183 obtained in the first optimization step .",
    "the searches for @xmath183 , and for @xmath184 and @xmath185 can be carried out starting with @xmath172 .",

    "typical energy gains are ( in mev ) :    e_0^bare - e_0^bare(_d^opt ) & & , + e_0^bare(_d^opt ) - e_0^bare(_e_g^opt,_t_2g^opt ) & & , + e_0^bare(_e_g^opt,_t_2g^opt ) - e_0^opt(_e_g^opt,_t_2g^opt ) & & .",
    "the energy gains from the variations of @xmath187 and @xmath188 are of the order of @xmath189 .",
    "[ compexp ]    the results for nickel of our dft - based gutzwiller calculations agree best with experiment when we choose the following values of the interaction parameters : @xmath190@xmath191 , @xmath192@xmath193 with @xmath194  @xcite . the width of the @xmath3  bands is predominantly determined by @xmath159 ( essentially the hubbard  @xmath80 ) via the values of the hopping reduction factors @xmath195 .",
    "the exchange splittings and , consequently , the magnetic moment are mainly governed by  @xmath161 and to some extend also by  @xmath159 .",
    "the racah parameter  @xmath161 causes the hunds - rule splitting of the @xmath196 multiplets ; in the hole picture , @xmath196 is the only many - particle configuration which is significantly occupied ( by @xmath197  electrons ) , while @xmath198  electrons are in @xmath199 , @xmath200  electrons are in @xmath201 , and @xmath202  electrons have @xmath10  or @xmath11  character .    in our present study , the parameter  @xmath161",
    "is found to be rather small ( @xmath203 ) compared to  @xmath159 in order to reproduce the measured spin - only moment  @xmath204 .",
    "larger values of  @xmath161 move the minimum of the total energy curve @xmath205 vs.  magnetization  @xmath206 to values of @xmath207@xmath208 .",
    "there are two points to discuss here .",
    "the first concerns the large value of  @xmath159 , which seems incompatible with the position of the satellite peak in the photo - emission data at about @xmath209 below the fermi energy  @xmath137  @xcite .",
    "model calculations for this many - body excitation peak use values of @xmath210@xmath211",
    ". however , these models use single of few @xmath3  band models , excluding hybridization with the 4@xmath10 , 4@xmath11 bands , see , e.g. , ref .  @xcite .",
    "when , in our calculation , the hybrization effects are switched off , and only the @xmath3  band contribution to the total energy matters , we also find that values of @xmath212@xmath213 agree best with experiment , and @xmath214 would be way out of a reasonable range of parameter values .",
    "the second point concerns the shape of the total energy curve @xmath215 at large values of  @xmath206 in the limit of strong ferromagnetism . in this limit",
    ", the increase of the magnetic moment is fed from the @xmath3  admixture in the majority 4@xmath10 , 4@xmath11 bands .",
    "compared to analogous curves obtained from sdft , the curvature at large  @xmath206 values is much smaller in our results .",
    "we presume that the larger sdft curvature is related to the balance between 4@xmath10 , 4@xmath11 and 3@xmath3 electrons .",
    "it is well known that this balance in a delicate manner determines the stability of transition metals as well as of noble metals ; see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite , and the discussion of this problem in ref .",
    "the balance between 4@xmath151 and 3@xmath3 electrons is the more influenced the larger the exchange splitting fields are because the minority band 3@xmath3  level is shifted towards the 4@xmath10 , 4@xmath11 levels and the majority band 3@xmath3  level is shifted away . only in first order of the splitting energy",
    ", we can expect that no change in the overall 4@xmath10 , 4@xmath11 population happens , as is imposed by the choice of our 4@xmath10 , 4@xmath11 chemical potentials .",
    "presently , the flow between 4@xmath10 , 4@xmath11 and 3@xmath3 electrons can not be described with our model hamiltonian as the electron - electron interaction within the 4@xmath10 , 4@xmath11 shell and between 4@xmath151 and 3@xmath3 is not included .",
    "the exchange splittings not only determine the magnetic moment but also influence strongly the shape of the single - particle bands in the vicinity of @xmath137 ( not the overall bandwidth ) . for the detailed comparison with photo - emission data we have thus either chosen calculations with small @xmath161 values ( @xmath203 ) , where the minimum of @xmath215 yields @xmath216 , or , for larger @xmath161  values , with a fixed moment constraint , using the experimental spin - only moment of @xmath204 .",
    "the resulting quasi - particle bands do not differ much from each other .",
    "there is however a tendency that values @xmath217 and larger appear to agree somewhat better with the bulk of the photo - emission data .    generally , the gutzwiller results agree much better with experiment than the sdft results . for example , this is the case for , ( i ) , the value for the quasi - particle density of states at the fermi energy ( @xmath218 vs.  @xmath124 states/(ev atom ) ) , ( ii ) , the positions of individual quasi - particle energies , ( iii ) , the values of the exchange splittings , ( iv ) , their @xmath139-@xmath140  anisotropy , and , ( v ) , the @xmath164  ratio of the @xmath3  part of the magnetic moment ( @xmath219 vs.  @xmath220 ) . as a consequence of the small @xmath12  exchange splitting",
    ", the @xmath221 state lies _ below _",
    "@xmath137 and , thus , the fermi surface exhibits only _",
    "one _ hole ellipsoid around @xmath138 , in nice agreement with experiment .",
    "the large anisotropy of the exchange splittings is a result of our ground - state energy optimization , which allows @xmath181 and @xmath180 to be independent variational parameters .",
    "we find @xmath222 .",
    "note that these values enter @xmath172 and are renormalized by factors @xmath223 , @xmath224 , when @xmath186 is reached .",
    "this also implies that the width of the majority spin bands is about 10% bigger than that of the ( higher lying ) minority spin bands .",
    "it causes a further reduction of the exchange splittings of states near @xmath137 , especially for those with strong @xmath139 character .",
    "note that this band dispersion effect causes larger exchange splittings near the bottom of the @xmath3  bands , e.g. , @xmath225 splitting of @xmath226 and @xmath227 splitting of @xmath228 .",
    "there , however , the quasi - particle linewidths have increased to @xmath229 and @xmath230 , respectively  @xcite , so that an exchange splitting near the bottom of the @xmath3 bands could , so far , not be observed experimentally .    the large anisotropy may originate from peculiarities special to ni with its almost completely filled @xmath3  bands and its fcc lattice structure .",
    "near the top of the @xmath3  bands , the @xmath139  states dominate because they exhibit the biggest hopping integrals to nearest neighbors , @xmath231 .",
    "the @xmath140  states have @xmath232 to nearest neighbors , and @xmath233 to next - nearest neighbors ; the latter are small because of the large lattice distance to second neighbors",
    ". the @xmath140  states also mix with the nearest - neighbor @xmath139  states with @xmath234-type coupling .",
    "therefore , the system can gain more band energy by avoiding occupation of anti - bonding @xmath139  states in the minority spin bands via large values of @xmath181 , at the expense of allowing occupation of less anti - bonding @xmath140 states via small @xmath180  values .",
    "this scenario should not apply to materials with a bcc lattice structure which have almost equal nearest and next - nearest neighbor separations .",
    "since the bands in nickel are almost completely filled , the suppression of charge fluctuations actually reduces the number of atomic configurations where the hunds - rule coupling is active .",
    "it is also in this respect that nickel does not quite reflect the generic situation of other transition metals with less completely filled @xmath3  bands .",
    "the results for nickel presented here must be seen as preliminary inasmuch some important interaction terms were not yet included ; see sect .",
    "[ critics ] .",
    "however , the present study already shows that the gutzwiller - dft is a working approach .",
    "it should allow us to resolve many of the open issues in itinerant ferromagnetism in nickel and other transition metals .",
    "which scenario for itinerant ferromagnetism in transition metals is the correct one ?",
    "band theory along the lines of slater and stoner could be worked out in much detail whereas a correlated - electron description of narrow - band systems was lacking until recently .",
    "our results for a two - band model and for nickel show that the van - vleck scenario is valid .",
    "band theory alone does not account for the strong electronic correlations present in the material which lead to the observed renormalization of the effective mass , exchange splittings , bandwidths , and fermi surface topology .",
    "moreover , charge fluctuations are indeed small , and large local moments are present both in the paramagnetic and the ferromagnetic phases .",
    "roughly we may say that the electrons motion through the crystal leads to a ferromagnetic coupling of pre - formed moments which eventually order at low enough temperatures . in this way",
    ", strong itinerant ferromagnets resemble ferromagnetic insulators as far as their low - energy properties are concerned : spinwaves exist which destroy the magnetic long - range order at the curie temperature .",
    "our present scheme allows us a detailed comparison with data from refined photo - emission experiments on nickel which are currently carried out  @xcite . it should be clear that our approach is applicable not only to nickel but to all other itinerant electron systems .",
    "despite all recent progress much work remains to be done .",
    "the present implementation of the gutzwiller - dft needs to be improved by the inclusion of more orbits , their mutual coulomb interaction terms , and the spin - orbit coupling .",
    "ultimately , some of the principle limitations of our variational approach will have to be overcome by a fully dynamic theory .",
    "most probably , such a theory will require enormous numerical resources such that a fully developed gutzwiller - dft will always remain a valuable tool to study ground - state properties of correlated electron systems .",
