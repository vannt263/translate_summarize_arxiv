    "sgra@xmath1 , the unusual radio source in the galactic center ( gc ) , which was long suspected to be the central massive black hole ( bh ) of the galaxy , is now securely identified with the @xmath2 dark compact mass that was detected dynamically by ir observations of stars following a keplerian velocity field ( eckart & genzel @xcite ; ghez et al .",
    "the identification is based on the non - thermal spectrum of sgra@xmath1 ( e.g. serabyn et al .",
    "@xcite ) , on its compactness ( rogers et al .",
    "@xcite ) , on its lack of detected motion ( backer & sramek @xcite ; reid et al .",
    "@xcite ) and on its position within @xmath3 ( @xmath4 in the gc ) of the dynamical center of the galaxy ( eckart & genzel @xcite ; ghez et al .",
    "the nominal position of sgra@xmath1 relative to the stars was established by aligning the radio and ir grids to within @xmath5 ( @xmath6 error ) using 4 maser giants in the inner @xmath7 of the gc ( menten et al .",
    "recent measurements of the acceleration vectors of three stars very close to the bh provide another dynamical method for localizing the bh and constrain the center of acceleration to be inside an elongated @xmath8 ( @xmath9 error ) region offset by @xmath10 from the nominal position of sgra@xmath1 ( ghez et al .",
    "neither of these positions coincide with any observed ir point source .",
    "the extreme under - luminosity of the bh across the spectrum poses a challenge to theoretical accretion models ( e.g. narayan et al .",
    "@xcite ) and motivates the continuing effort to detect , localize and measure the flux of the bh in bands other than the radio .",
    "a precise determination of the bh position is also relevant for solving the orbits of stars near the bh , which can be used to measure the bh mass @xmath11 and the distance to the gc @xmath12 ( jaroszynski @xcite ; salim & gould @xcite ) and to search for general relativistic effects ( jaroszynski @xcite ) .",
    "the bh will not lie exactly at the dynamical center of the stellar cluster due to its brownian motion . a detection of this offset , which is expected to be of order few mas ( bahcall & wolf @xcite ) , can be used to estimate @xmath11 and to probe the stellar potential and the formation history of the system .",
    "gravitational lensing of background stars by the bh offers another , independent way for localizing the bh , which is free of assumptions about @xmath11 , @xmath12 or the distribution of stars around the bh .",
    "the bh lies on the line connecting the two images of any background source it gravitationally lenses , and so the intersection of these lines fixes its position . the most reliable way to identify lensed image pairs is by their spectra , which should be identical up to differences caused by non - uniform extinction . at present spectra",
    "are available for all stars brighter than @xmath13 mag , but only for a few stars fainter than @xmath14 mag .",
    "no spectral identification of lensing has been reported yet .",
    "however , it is possible to use astrometric and photometric data to search statistically for the signature of lensing .",
    "this is motivated by rough estimates that suggest that there are several hundreds of distant background stars within @xmath15 of sgra@xmath1 ( alexander & loeb @xcite ) .    a point mass lens is assumed here since the total stellar mass around the bh on the scale of interest is very small compared to @xmath11 .",
    "the possibility of one of the images being amplified by a star near the bh ( alexander & loeb @xcite ) is neglected .",
    "the two gravitationally lensed images of a background source lie on one line with the point mass lens and the source , one on either side of the lens .",
    "the angular distances of the images from the lens , @xmath16 , and that of the source , @xmath17 , are related by @xmath18 ( @xmath19 by definition ) , where @xmath20 is the einstein angle , @xmath21 , @xmath11 is the mass of the bh and @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 are the lens - source , observer - lens and observer - source distances , respectively .",
    "the images are magnified by @xmath25 ( e.g. schneider , ehlers & falco @xcite ) .",
    "it then follows that the ratios of the angular distances , the projected radial and transverse velocities and the fluxes of the two images obey the relations @xmath26 where the velocities are measured relative to the lens .",
    "these constraints can be used to test whether two point sources are a pair of lensed images using astrometric and photometric data .",
    "the challenge lies in detecting a small number of true image pairs among the @xmath27 observed stars against the combinatorial background of the @xmath28 possible pairs in the presence of measurement errors .",
    "the constraints on the lensed image pair can be expressed more robustly in terms of the projections @xmath29 where @xmath30 and @xmath31 stands for the two - component vectors similarly constructed from @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 , with the signs chosen so that @xmath35 for a lensed image pair .",
    "the definition of @xmath36 utilizes the fact that stellar positions are the best measured quantity in the data analyzed here . in the presence of measurement errors eq .",
    "[ eq : c ] is replaced by a score function ,    @xmath37    where @xmath38 is the error in @xmath36 due to the measurement errors .",
    "the smaller the score , the more likely it is that the two stars are a lensed image pair .",
    "it is not known how many lensed image pairs there are among the stars observed near the bh , if any , and so the search for the position of the bh and for the lensed image pairs has to be conducted simultaneously by looking for deviations from a random ( unlensed ) stellar field .",
    "this proceeds by enumerating over all possible locations for the bh around the nominal origin within a specified search field , which is very small compared to the entire stellar field ; recalculating @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 relative to the trial bh location ; calculating @xmath42 for each of the possible pairs @xmath43 ; sorting the scores ; calculating the likelihood @xmath44 for the best @xmath45 scores under the assumption of a random distribution ; and finally , identifying the position of the bh as that with the _ minimal _ likelihood ( ml ) in random .",
    "the choice of the best @xmath45 scores minimizes the number of dependent pairs in random draws .",
    "dependent pairs , such as @xmath43 and @xmath46 , increase the noise because they can not both be lensed image pairs .",
    "formal confidence limits on the ml position are calculated in the same way as for maximal likelihood parameter estimation .",
    "the probability distribution function ( pdf ) of the best @xmath45 scores and their likelihood in unlensed data are estimated directly by monte - carlo ( mc ) simulations .",
    "the simulations consist of re - shuffling the actual data by rotating each stellar position and velocity vector by random angles and by randomly permuting the fluxes among the stars .",
    "in addition , the entire data is randomly shifted within the search field to avoid biases with respect to the nominal origin .",
    "this procedure conserves the averaged radial density distribution , velocity field and luminosity function while randomizing any angular correlations .",
    "some of the pairs are filtered out to further suppress the combinatorial noise .",
    "a fraction of the stars have spectral type identification and line - of - sight velocity measurements .",
    "pairs whose stellar types ( early or late type ) are discrepant are not compared , and so are stars whose line - of - sight velocities @xmath47 are discrepant by more than @xmath48 . in addition , only pairs with @xmath49 are considered .",
    "this is necessary for avoiding pairs whose distance from the center is too small relative to the astrometric errors to allow a reliable test of co - linearity , or pairs whose einstein angle clearly exceeds the upper limit @xmath50 for a source at infinity , based on estimates of the bh mass , @xmath51 ( genzel et al .",
    "@xcite ) and the distance to the gc , @xmath52 kpc ( reid @xcite ) . in practice , the results do not depend strongly on the exact filtering criteria as long as the search field is not too large .",
    "the random probability for finding a ml smaller than that found in the data is @xmath53 , where @xmath54 is the probability of any _ given _ position in the search field to have a likelihood @xmath55 , which is calculated from the random pdf , and where @xmath56 is the size of the enumeration over the bh position .",
    "the actual value of @xmath56 is much smaller than the search field grid size ( here @xmath57 ) because nearby locations are not independent due to the smoothing effect of the measurement errors ( fig .",
    "[ fig : shift ] ) .",
    "however , it can be estimated by @xmath58 , the mc median of the likelihood probabilities @xmath59 in randomly re - shuffled fields constructed from the data .",
    "inspection of the likelihood plot in fig .",
    "[ fig : shift ] suggests that there are of order @xmath60 resolution elements in the search field , in agreement with the mc estimate @xmath61 .",
    "the analysis is based on the compilation of genzel et al .",
    "( @xcite ) , which includes all available astrometric observations of stars in the inner @xmath62 of the gc .",
    "the compilation lists the stellar positions at a common epoch , proper and radial velocities , when available ( error weighted averages if more than one measurement exists ) , k - band magnitudes and spectral types , when known .",
    "the positions are the best measured quantity .",
    "individual errors are quoted only for the velocities .",
    "genzel et al .",
    "( @xcite ) estimate a typical astrometric error of @xmath63 mas ( random and systematic ) .",
    "magnitudes are accurate to better than @xmath64 mag for stars with @xmath65 mag , while fainter magnitudes are listed without errors to @xmath64 mag precision .",
    "a magnitude uncertainty of @xmath66 mag is assumed here for all stars .",
    "the sample is augmented by 20 stars observed by ghez et al .",
    "( @xcite ) that were not included in the compilation because of their uncertain velocity measurements , bringing the total to 295 stars . of these ,",
    "116 stars have a complete set of measurements ( position , proper velocity and magnitude ) and are used in the analysis .",
    "the results presented here are based on @xmath67 mc runs with filtering criteria @xmath68 ( a @xmath69 margin above the maximal value of @xmath20 ) and @xmath70 .",
    "the latter corresponds to a chance co - linearity probability of @xmath71 ( hence the importance of using the additional constraints on the velocities and fluxes ) . figure  [ fig : pdf ]",
    "compares the random pdf with the approximating polynom that is used for calculating the likelihood , with the distribution of the best @xmath45 scores in one of the randomly re - shuffled realizations , with the scores at the nominal origin and with those at the most likely bh location .",
    "figure [ fig : shift ] shows the likelihood across the @xmath72 search field . the position of the ml at @xmath73 , @xmath74 relative to the nominal origin lies within the error region on the center of acceleration ( ghez et al .",
    "@xcite ) and is @xmath75 away from the nominal origin .",
    "the ml has a random probability of @xmath76 .",
    "the position of the ml is insensitive to moderate changes in @xmath77 , @xmath78 , or to whether the three innermost stars are included in the data set or not , or to higher assumed values of @xmath79 up to @xmath80 mag , which may better describe the errors in the flux ratio given the patchy nature of the extinction in the inner gc ( blum , sellgren & depoy @xcite ) .",
    "however , @xmath81 increases when larger errors are assumed .",
    "the results are sensitive to the values adopted for the velocities .",
    "90 stars of the compiled data were observed with the keck telescope at high resolution ( @xmath82 mas ) over a baseline of 2 yr ( ghez et al .",
    "the ml analysis of the original keck data has a global minimum at the edge of the search field and only a weak local minimum near @xmath83 .",
    "the difference is due to the compiled velocities , which are the average of the high resolution , short baseline astrometry and of lower - resolution , longer baseline astrometry .    [",

    "the results of simulations with mock stellar fields with properties similar to those of the data ( fig . [ fig : shift ] ) confirm that the ml analysis has a high rate of success in finding the position of the bh with as few as 3 image pairs in the data .",

    "the results of the combined search for a lensing signal and for the bh are intriguing because the most likely bh position coincides with the center of acceleration and because of the low random probability of the lensing signal .",

    "many of the lensed image pair candidates listed in table  [ tbl : pairs ] have small amplifications , @xmath100 , with a 2 mag average difference between the two images , and so none of the second images have spectral identifications . until deeper stellar spectroscopy is available , the statistical analysis could be improved if individual errors were made available for all the measured quantities .",
