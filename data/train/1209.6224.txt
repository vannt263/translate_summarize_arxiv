    "the interaction between a non - magnetic metal with a magneto - dielectric material has also recently been discussed @xcite .",
    "these studies illustrate that the magnetic properties can significantly influence in the casimir pressure .",
    "theoretical and experimental studies also show that it is possible to obtain the repulsive casimir force in such systems @xcite , and the results could provide possible solutions to handle the stiction and adhesion problems found in mems / nems devices . in terms of theory , the calculations depend substantially on the model that describes the dielectric function of metals .",

    "the fm material is taken to be fe described via a dielectric and magnetic response properties .",
    "we utilize the lifshitz theory to examine the role of the separation , temperature , and thickness of the substrate .",
    "we also investigate the influence of the magnetic response of the fm and show that in most cases its contribution is relatively small compared to the one from the dielectric response .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : sec .",
    "ii presents the detailed expressions and calculations of the thermal casimir interactions .",
    "the results and discussions are mentioned in sec .",
    "finally , sec .",
    "iv presents the conclusions .",
    "here we calculate the casimir force between the graphene sheet and a substrate in vacuum at a separation @xmath1 .",
    "the force per unit area at temperature @xmath2 is given as @xcite    @xmath3    where @xmath4 is the plank constant , @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the reflection coefficients corresponding to the transverse magnetic ( tm ) and transverse electric ( te ) field modes .",
    "the reflection coefficients for the substrate are given as @xcite @xmath7 where @xmath8    it is important to note that @xmath9 is the wave vector component perpendicular to the plate , @xmath10 is the speed of light , @xmath11 is the matsubara frequencies .",
    "the response properties of the metal are characterized by the dielectric function @xmath12 and the permeability function @xmath13 which are frequency dependent along the imaginary axis ( @xmath14 ) .",
    "we use the drude model @xmath15 and the plasma model @xmath16 to describe the dielectric function of metals @xcite @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the plasma frequency and the damping parameter is @xmath19 . at room temperature ,",
    "the @xmath20 term of the casimir - lifshitz force in the metallic system is dominant .",
    "this reason allows us to consider the contribution of the static magnetic permeability @xmath21 on the casimir force . for higher orders of @xmath22",
    ", one should put @xmath23 @xcite .",
    "both models lead to @xmath24 .",
    "however , we can obtain two different expressions of @xmath25 when applying these two models @xcite @xmath26 here @xmath27 and @xmath28 are the te reflection coefficients corresponding to the drude and plasma model , respectively .    for graphene ,",
    "the reflection coefficients are found to be @xcite @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the 2d conductivity described via the the kubo formalism @xcite @xmath31    the first term in eq.([eq:6 ] ) corresponds to the intraband contribution , while the second term corresponds to the interband contribution . at low temperatures ,",
    "the graphene conductivity @xmath32 approaches to the universal value @xmath33 .",
    "( color online ) the normalized graphene conductivity @xmath34 vs frequency at given temperatures.,width=340 ]    using eq.([eq:5 ] ) and eq.([eq:6 ] ) the tm reflection coefficient of graphene is given by @xmath35    the equation suggests @xmath36 . in the same way , it can be found the expression of @xmath37    @xmath38    where @xmath39 is the thermal wavelength in most materials .",
    "the explicit expression of @xmath37 shows that it is susceptible to temperature .",
    "@xmath37 is nonzero only because of the intraband component of the graphene conductivity .",
    "the first matsubara frequencies @xmath40 are approximately 0.027 , 0.162 , and 0.325 @xmath41 corresponding to the temperature 50 , 300 and 600 @xmath42 , respectively . as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig:6 ] , for @xmath43 , it is possible to substitute @xmath44 for @xmath32 in eq.([eq:5 ] ) to calculate the reflection coefficients and the higher order terms in the casimir - lifshitz force formula .",
    "in this section , we consider the casimir interactions between graphene and a fe metal plate .",
    "the parameters of fe are @xmath45 @xmath41 , @xmath46 @xmath41 , and @xmath47 @xcite . as discussed in previous part @xmath48 , the tm contribution to the @xmath20 term of the casimir force",
    "is given    @xmath49    the expression above is identical to the term with @xmath20 in the casimir force between two metals .",
    "the sum of the @xmath50 is much smaller than that of the metallic system due to the presence of the low graphene conductivity @xcite . as a result , the @xmath20 term is the dominating term .",
    "now , to calculate the contribution of the te mode @xmath51 with @xmath20 , it is necessary to choose a good model for fe .",
    "both the plasma @xcite and drude model @xcite , however , has been widely used to compute the casimir interaction and fit with experimental data .",
    "determining an accuracy of two models as compared to measurement data has been a controversial issue . in the following work ,",
    "we utilize the plasma model to calculate the interactions .",
    "the expression of @xmath51 is expressed by @xmath52    note that @xmath51 is a unique term affected by the magnetic property of the ferromagnetic substrate . in fig.[fig:7 ] , the ratio @xmath53 is less than 0.75 @xmath54 for distances @xmath1 in the range from 0 to 1 @xmath55 at given temperatures .",
    "it indicates that the effect of @xmath56 on the casimir force can be neglectable .",
    "for this reason , fe can be treated as a regular non - magnetic metal @xmath57 .    for a finite - thickness iron slab @xmath0 ,",
    "the reflection coefficients of the metal material are modified as follows @xcite    @xmath58    ( color online ) the ratios of @xmath59 and @xmath60 at 50 , 300 , and 600 @xmath42 as a function of separation distance @xmath1.,width=336 ]    to study the influence of thickness on the casimir force , we rewrite eq.([eq:1 ] ) in the following way @xmath61 here @xmath62 is the sum of all @xmath50 terms and is thickness - dependent . because @xmath63 , so @xmath64 . from this , the expression of @xmath65 is in eq.([eq:15 ] ) and is independent of @xmath0 .",
    "the component force @xmath51 is weaker than that for the thick plate and one can consider @xmath66 .",
    "therefore , only @xmath62 is sensitive to a variation of subtrate thickness .",
    "( color online ) the casimir pressures corresponding to the approximate and full expression at different temperatures . here",
    "@xmath67.,width=340 ]    figure [ fig:7 ] shows that the thickness of the fe slab does not influence much the casimir forces . at the same temperature ,",
    "the separation between the two curves corresponding to the finite plate and the semi - infinite plate is small . in bulk materials ,",
    "a reduction of the thickness gives rise to a small decrease of the casimir force .",
    "the thermal wavelength of graphene is @xmath68 @xmath69 at room temperature . at distances beyond the thermal wavelength of a system",
    ", the contribution of the sum of @xmath50 terms can be ignorable .",
    "in the investigated range , the influence of @xmath62 is not significant .",
    "this finding suggest that since graphene is a two dimensional monolayer material , it significantly interacts only with the nearest interface layers of the bottom substrate .",
    "graphene s effect on layers separated by a sufficient number of layers is negligable .",
    "the fe slab with @xmath70 nm has more layers than that which are meaningful .",
    "another interesting special feature is that at large distance limit ( @xmath71 ) the contribution of @xmath62 to the total casimir force is minor .",
    "it can be explained that the @xmath43 terms provide weak force components due to the presence of the small universal conductivity in the reflection coefficients .",
    "it is important to note that a universal graphene conductivity is a main reason for less than 2 @xmath54 difference as one compares the dispersion force between two graphene sheets with @xmath72 @xcite .",
    "it demonstrates that the approximate formula for the casimir interaction equivalent to the @xmath20 term of the casimir - lifshitz expression in this regime is @xmath73 . in fig.[fig:2 ] , we plot the normalized casimir force with the full expression ( see eq.([eq:1 ] ) ) and the approximate expression .",
    "the @xmath74 term is dominant and can replace the full expression of the casimir interaction when @xmath75 @xmath55 for 300 @xmath42 .",
    "the critical @xmath76 of fe is 1043 @xmath42 . at @xmath77 ,",
    "the magnetic properties of the ferromagnetic material nearly vanish .",
    "spins in the fe slab are rearranged so that @xmath57 at all frequencies .",
    "nevertheless , the dielectric function is not affected by the directions of spins .",
    "therefore , the plasma frequency and damping parameter are unchanged by temperature increases at @xmath78 .",
    "if we consider the casimir interaction between fe and another metal , the phase transition leads to a significant change in the mutual interaction @xcite .",
    "the fact that graphene is quite transparent with the presence of the magnetic properties , the dispersion force may not be modified .",
    "a notable point is that the formula in eq.([eq:6 ] ) was used for pure graphene with the chemical potential @xmath79 .",
    "if @xmath80 , the graphene conductivity has to be rewritten in the form of @xcite @xmath81    the first two terms are known as the intraband conductivity , another is the interband component .",
    "eq.([eq:11 ] ) shows that the intraband contribution of @xmath82 still induces a non - zero value of @xmath37 .",
    "obviously , the graphene conductivity is strongly susceptible to the chemical potential . the chemical potential of a graphene sheet can be controlled by using an applied electric field @xmath83",
    "@xcite    @xmath84    here @xmath85 is the fermi distribution function , @xmath86 is the fermi velocity",
    ".    other ways to modulate @xmath87 are an applied magnetic field @xcite and chemical doping . using a magnetic field also varys the expression of graphene conductivity and creates landau energy levels .",
    "in the limit of extremely low chemical potential , @xmath37 is represented as eq.([eq:7 ] ) . for @xmath88 , the expression of the te reflection coefficient with @xmath20",
    "is written by @xmath89    ( color online ) the casimir forces at the case with and without taking into account the magnetic properties at @xmath90 @xmath41.,width=332 ]    in fig.[fig:3 ] , the casimir interactions are calculated at low temperatures ( @xmath91 @xmath42 ) and @xmath92 @xmath41 with and without the magnetic properties . unlike the case of a pristine graphene sheet ( @xmath93 @xmath41 ) , the influence of permeability of fe on the dispersion force is noticeable at 10 @xmath42 .",
    "the properties , however , have much less effect on the casimir force at temperatures greater than 50 @xmath42 .",
    "the majority of @xmath94 comes from the interband conductivity of graphene . at 10 @xmath42",
    ", the contribution of the intraband on the casimir force can be considerable to that of the interband conductivity .",
    "however , as temperature increases the interband contribution increases substantially , and causing a decrease in the contribution from intraband . for this reason ,",
    "the magnetic properties nearly disappear at @xmath95 @xmath42 .",
    "to investigate further the casimir force dependence on chemical potential , we consider the fluctuation interactions at @xmath96 @xmath69 and various temperatures versus @xmath87 shown in fig.[fig:4 ] .",
    "@xmath97 changes from 0.018 to 0.034 at @xmath98 @xmath42 and from 0.045 to 0.064 at @xmath99 @xmath42 when @xmath87 varys in the regime below @xmath100 @xmath41 .",
    "in addition , at higher temperatures , the curves of @xmath97 is of the linear form .",
    "( color online ) the casimir pressures as a function of chemical potential.,width=347 ]    it is remarkable that fe is not a superconducting material , so iron has no temperature phase transition as temperature decreases to 10 @xmath42 .",
    "alternatively , the universal value of conductivity @xmath44 also demonstrates that even if temperature is 0 @xmath42 , graphene still does not change phase and properties .",
    "when design and manufacturing of micro and nano devices and components , it is important and necessary to understand the loading and effects of related forces on the systems and its components , especially the nanoscale surface forces such as casimir and the van der waals . in this study ,",
    "a comprehensive investigation and discussion of the casimir interaction between graphene and fm materials is presented .",
    "we discussed about the casimir force which is a function of the graphene conductivity and the permeability constant of @xmath101 .",
    "it was shown that the conductivity of graphene heavily depends on the chemical potential which again has a large impact on the dispersion force and causes a difference between non - magnetic and magnetic calculations at the ultra - low temperature .",
    "in other cases , there is no effect of the magnetic properties on the casimir force .",
    "one can apply a bias electric field to a graphene sheet to tailor the chemical potential of graphene in order to control the magnitude of the casimir force . according to our numerical results , the force between a graphene layer and the semi - infinite metal is smaller than the interaction between two metals in @xcite because the conductivity of metals is higher than that of graphene .",
    "the numerical results also demonstrated that the thickness of a metal slab had a minor influence on the casimir force .",
    "the investigation and above findings about the casimir force in this study would lead to useful information and effective solutions for design and manufacturing of micro and nano devices where graphene and fm metal materials are utilised , especially in the areas of micro and nano machining , fabrication , manipulation , assembly and metrology .",
