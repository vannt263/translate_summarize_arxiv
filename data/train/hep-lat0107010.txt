    "the structure of hadrons differs profoundly from that of other familiar many body systems . unlike electrons in atoms or nucleons in nuclei , quarks are confined in the nucleon . whereas photons can be subsumed into the coulomb potential in atomic physics and pions",
    "can be subsumed into the nucleon - nucleon potential in nuclear physics , gluons are essential degrees of freedom in light hadrons that carry half the momentum and have important nonperturbative topological excitations . since nonperturbative qcd is presently intractable analytically , the goal of this work is to use lattice field theory to solve qcd with controlled errors to provide a quantitative understanding of the rich quark and gluon structure of the nucleon and to obtain insight into how qcd actually works to produce this structure .",
    "decades of high energy scattering experiments have now provided detailed experimental knowledge of the light cone distributions of quarks and gluons in the nucleon , so this work addresses the use of lattice qcd to understand the observed distribution of the quark density and helicity . using the operator product expansion",
    ", it is possible to calculate moments of quark distributions , and i will discuss here the first calculations in full qcd@xcite . a major puzzle in the field has been the fact that quenched calculations of these moments , which ignore quark - antiquark excitations of the dirac sea , disagree with experiment at the 20 - 50% level .",
    "i will show that contrary to some conjectures , at the quark masses accessible in practical calculations , including quark loops does not alter the results significantly .",
    "rather , i will argue that the physical origin of the discrepancy with experiment has been incorrect extrapolation to the physical quark mass , and will show how extrapolation incorporating the leading non - analytic behavior required by chiral symmetry produces consistent results for the moments of quark distributions .",
    "in addition , we have also compared full qcd results with configurations that have been cooled to remove all the gluon contributions except for those of instantons and shown that the qualitative behavior of the moments is reproduced by the instanton content of the gluon configurations .",
    "@xmath0    by the operator product expansion , moments of the following linear combinations of quark and antiquark distributions in the proton @xmath1 are related to the following matrix elements of twist-2 operators @xmath2}\\gamma_5 i   d^{\\mu_2 } \\cdots i d^{\\mu_n\\ } } \\psi}{ps } & = & 2 \\langle x^{n-1}\\rangle_{\\delta q}\\ , ms^{[\\alpha}p^{\\{\\mu_1]}p^{\\mu_2}\\cdots p^{\\mu_n\\ } } \\nonumber.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here , @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 denotes the momentum fraction carried by the quark , and @xmath6 and @xmath7 $ ] denote symmetrization and antisymmetrization respectively .",
    "we note that odd moments @xmath8 are obtained from deep inelastic electron or muon scattering structure functions @xmath9 or @xmath10 , even moments of @xmath11 are determined from @xmath12 , and these moments are proportional to the quantities @xmath13 and @xmath14 defined in ref.@xcite .",
    "in addition , @xmath15 also determines the quantity @xmath16 @xmath17 } \\cdots id^{\\mu_n\\}}\\psi | ps\\rangle = \\frac{1}{n } { d_n s^{[\\sigma}p^{\\{\\mu_1]}\\cdots p^{\\mu_n\\}}}\\ ] ] even moments @xmath18 are obtained from deep inelastic neutrino scattering , and in addition , a variety of other processes have contributed to what is now a detailed empirical knowledge of the quark and antiquark distributions in the nucleon .",
    "we will subsequently compare our results with moments calculated from the cteq , mrs , and grv global fits to the world supply of data .",
    "proton matrix elements of the operators in eq.[mom2 ] are calculated by evaluating the connected and disconnected diagrams shown in fig .",
    "[ hadrmatrelem ] . note that both the connected and disconnected diagrams each receive contributions from quarks and antiquarks .",
    "depending on the moment , by eq.[mom1 ] , the sum of the diagrams yields either the sum or difference of the moments of the quark and antiquark distributions . in the past",
    ", there has been some confusion on this point : because the connected diagrams are called the valence quark distribution and experimentalists define the valence quark distribution as the difference between the quark and antiquark distributions , the connected contributions have erroneously been compared only with the difference between the empirical quark and antiquark distributions . because it is technically much more difficult to evaluate the disconnected diagrams , our present calculations only include connected diagrams .",
    "fortunately , the disconnected diagrams are flavor independent , so they cancel out of the difference between up and down quark distributions .",
    "hence , in table [ tab - summary ] , we compare lattice calculation of the difference between connected diagrams for up and down quarks with the corresponding difference of moments of experimental data for the sum or difference of quark and antiquark distributions .",
    "@xmath19    @xmath20    on the lattice , connected diagrams are evaluated by calculating a three point function in which a source creates a state with the quantum numbers of the proton , the operator acts on this state , and a sink finally annihilates the state . because evolution in imaginary time filters out the ground state , when the operator is sufficiently far from both the source and sink , it acts in the ground state and produces the desired ground state matrix element .",
    "as the time at which it acts approaches either the source or sink , it sees excited state contaminants , yielding a central plateau corresponding to the physical matrix element and exponential contaminants at the edges . obviously , it is beneficial to optimize the overlap of the source with the ground state to maximize the plateau region and minimize the effect of the excited state contaminants at the edges .    in this work , connected diagrams were calculated using sequential propagators generated by the upper two components of the nucleon source @xmath21 . the overlap with",
    "the physical proton ground state was optimized using wuppertal smearing @xcite to maximize the overlap @xmath22 .",
    "figure  [ overlap ] shows that varying the smearing reduced @xmath23 by over 4 orders of magnitude , yielding an overlap with the physical ground state of approximately 50% .",
    "dirichlet boundary conditions were used for quarks in the t - direction .    the resulting plateaus for four operators that could be measured in a proton with zero three - momentum are shown in fig .  [ newfigs1 ] .",
    "here one observes both a statistically well determined central plateau region and the effectiveness with which the excited state contaminants have been reduced by the optimized source .",
    "the continuum operators defined above are approximated on a discrete cartesian lattice using representations of the hypercubic group that have been chosen to eliminate operator mixing as much as possible and to minimize the number of non - zero components of the nucleon momentum .",
    "the operators we have used are shown in table  1 , where we have indicated whether the spatial momentum components are non - zero and whether mixing occurs .",
    "note , no@xmath24 indicates a case in which mixing could exist in general but vanishes perturbatively for wilson or overlap fermions and no@xmath25 indicates perturbative mixing with _ lower _ dimension operators for wilson fermions but no mixing for overlap fermions . because the statistical errors are much larger for sources projected to non - zero momentum , the moments corresponding to operators requiring non - zero momentum are presently not well determined .    to convert from lattice regularization at the scale of the inverse lattice spacing @xmath26 to the continuum @xmath27 scheme at momentum scale q",

    "@xmath31    the moments listed in table 1 were calculated @xcite on @xmath32 lattices for wilson fermions in full qcd at @xmath33 using 200 sesam configurations at each of 4 @xmath34 and at @xmath35 using 100 scri configurations at 3 @xmath34 .",
    "they were also calculated with two sets of 100 full qcd configurations cooled with 50 cooling steps and in quenched qcd at @xmath36 using 200 configurations at each of 3 @xmath34 .",
    "typical linear chiral extrapolations for operators calculated with nucleon momentum equal to zero are shown in figure  [ fig - full ] for full and quenched calculations of @xmath37 and @xmath38 , showing agreement within statistical errors . to avoid finite volume errors at the lightest quark mass ,",

    "this qualitative agreement between cooled and uncooled results occurs at light quark mass for all the twist-2 matrix elements we calculated and demonstrates the degree to which the instanton content of the configurations and their associated zero modes dominate light hadron structure @xcite .",

    "there is strong evidence that the physical origin of these discrepancies is the inadequate treatment of the pion cloud in the nucleon that has been necessary because of limited computational resources . by necessity ,",
    "present calculations are restricted to quark masses that are so heavy that the pion mass is above 600 mev and the pion cloud surrounding the nucleon is strongly suppressed .",
    "physical quantities like the nucleon magnetic moment and axial charge clearly depend strongly on the pion current , and should therefore be very sensitive to the absence of the full pion cloud . furthermore , because of the rapid , nonlinear variation from the chiral logs arising from goldstone boson loops , it is clear that a linear extrapolation is completely inadequate to describe the correct chiral physics .    in a recent work@xcite , also discussed by a. thomas at this conference , we have shown that chiral extrapolation incorporating the leading non - analytic behavior from chiral perturbation theory can systematically resolve the discrepancies in the moments @xmath42 using the formula : @xmath43 + b_n m_{\\pi}^2 \\label{chiral_ext}\\ ] ] the coefficient of the leading non - analytic behavior @xmath44 is determined from chiral perturbation theory .",
    "the parameter @xmath45 specifies the scale above which pion loops no longer produce rapid variation .",
    "it corresponds to the upper limit of the momentum integration if one applies a sharp cutoff in the loop integral and physically corresponds to the inverse size of the quark core of the nucleon that serves as the source for the pion field . as shown in ref @xcite , the value @xmath46 mev , which is consistent with the value required to extrapolate the nucleon magnetic moment and with chiral nucleon models , extrapolates the world s supply of lattice data to the experimental values of @xmath47 , @xmath48 , and @xmath49 . in fig",
