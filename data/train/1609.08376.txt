    "it is important to give a non - perturbative definition of chiral gauge theories . recently ,",
    "grabowska and kaplan constructed a @xmath1-dimensional domain - wall lattice formulation of chiral gauge theories  @xcite .- dimensional domain - wall formulation related to their formalism , see  ref .",
    "@xcite ] more recently , they proposed a @xmath0-dimensional lattice formulation on the basis of the so - called chiral overlap operator which is derived from the above domain - wall formulation  @xcite .",
    "their @xmath0-dimensional formulation contains left and right - handed fermions and , in the tree - level approximation , the left - handed component couples only to the original gauge field and the right - handed component couples only to a gauge field evolved by the gradient flow  @xcite for infinite time .",
    "the right - handed weyl fermion is called the fluffy mirror fermion or fluff . okumura and  suzuki",
    "@xcite argued that the fermion number anomaly in this formulation possibly has phenomenological implications for the strong cp problem , the baryogenesis , and the dark matter problem .",
    "they also conjectured the form of the classical continuum limit of the fermion number anomaly , but the explicit calculation was not carried out in  ref .",
    "@xcite .    in the present paper",
    ", we complete the calculation of the classical continuum limit of the fermion number anomaly in the formulation of  refs .",
    "@xcite ; the correct expression turns out to be more complicated than the simple expression conjectured in  ref .",
    "rather unexpectedly , we find that the anomaly contains a term which is not lorentz invariant .",
    "the term is proportional to the gauge anomaly coefficient and thus the fermion number anomaly in this lattice formulation automatically restores the lorentz invariant form when and only when the anomaly cancellation condition is met .",
    "the physical meaning of our this finding is not immediately obvious ; however , remembering that the fermion number anomaly is a very basic property of chiral gauge theories and any sensible formulation of chiral gauge theories must fail when the anomaly cancellation condition is not met , our finding appears interesting and quite suggestive .",

    "we note that @xmath36 is a dimension  @xmath0 gauge invariant local polynomial of  @xmath2 and  @xmath3 .",
    "then by examining the above properties , we find that the most general form of  @xmath36 is given by @xmath50   + \\frac{1}{2 } d_2\\ , \\partial_\\mu \\operatorname{tr}\\left[c_\\nu \\left\\{f_{\\mu\\nu } + f_{\\star\\mu\\nu}\\right\\}\\right ]   \\notag\\\\&\\qquad + \\text{(lorentz symmetry violating part ) } ,   \\label{eq : a_l - gl}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath51   - b\\ , \\partial_\\mu \\operatorname{tr}\\left[c_\\nu \\mathcal{d}_\\rho c_\\sigma    + c_\\nu \\mathcal{d}_{\\star\\rho } c_\\sigma\\right]\\right\\ }   \\label{eq : a_l^chi}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath52 $ ] and  @xmath53 $ ] .",
    "the coefficients @xmath54 , @xmath55 , and  @xmath56 can not be determined from the above argument alone . in the first line of  eq .",
    ", @xmath57   arises from the parity - odd part and the other terms from the parity - even part .",
    "the second term  @xmath58 $ ] is proportional to the gauge anomaly coefficient and thus it vanishes for anomaly - free cases .",
    "the following explicit calculation shows that  @xmath59 in the third term . as we will show below",
    ", there actually exists a lorentz symmetry violating term in  @xmath36 .",
    "note that , generally speaking , the restoration of the lorentz symmetry is not automatic with the lattice regularization .",
    "let us describe how the explicit calculation of  @xmath36 proceeds .",
    "we first note @xmath60 in this expression , we use @xmath61 from eq .  , we have @xmath62 e^{ipy / a } f(y)\\notag\\\\   & = e^{ipx / a } \\gamma_5   \\sum_y \\left[i \\sum_\\mu \\gamma_\\mu ( s_\\mu - iaq_\\mu )   - \\sum_\\mu ( c_\\mu - 1 ) - ar - ma\\right]\\!\\!(x , y)\\ , f(y ) , \\label{eq:(3.11)}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath63 @xmath64 and  @xmath65 are defined similarly . thus @xmath37 can be written in terms of operators @xmath66 , @xmath67 , @xmath64 , and  @xmath65 .",
    "next , we expand @xmath37 into the power series of the lattice spacing @xmath5 up to  @xmath68 , noting that @xmath69 . for this , we need the following expansions : @xmath70    carrying out the explicit calculation , we find that only four covariant derivatives with same spacetime indices appear in the lorentz symmetry violating terms .",
    "therefore , with taking into account the above properties of the fermion number anomaly , the lorentz symmetry violating part in the general form   must be @xmath71 ,   \\label{eq : a_l - lv}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with a to be determined coefficient  @xmath72 .",
    "then , the explicit tedious expansion of  @xmath36 can be exactly combined into the form of  eqs .   and  .",
    "after this calculation , we finally obtain @xmath73   + d'_1 \\partial_\\mu \\operatorname{tr}\\left[c_\\mu c_\\mu c_\\mu\\right ] ,   \\label{eq : a_l - result}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath74 is given by  eq .   with the correct overall factor , and",
    "the coefficients are @xmath75 and @xmath59 as mentioned above , where @xmath76 in the integrals in eq .   and",
    "eq .  , indices @xmath77 and  @xmath78 are arbitrary as long as they differ from each other .",
    "the coefficients @xmath79 and  @xmath80 as the function of  @xmath81 are plotted in  figs .",
    "[ fig : lsd5 ] and  [ fig : lvd5 ] . as already announced , the last term in  eq .",
    "is not lorentz invariant .",
    "however , this term is proportional to the gauge anomaly coefficient .",
    "thus , in anomaly - free chiral gauge theories , this lorentz symmetry violating term ( and the second term of  eq .  ) vanishes ; only @xmath57 provides the fermion number anomaly .    ]    ]",
    "in the present paper , we computed the classical continuum limit of the fermion number anomaly in the lattice formulation of chiral gauge theories by grabowska and kaplan .",
    "the anomaly consists of two parts : one is the parity - odd part being proportional to the epsilon tensor , @xmath57 .",
    "the other is the parity - even part which is proportional to the gauge anomaly coefficient .",
    "the latter contains even a lorentz symmetry violating term . in anomaly - free cases ,",
    "only the former  @xmath57 contributes which is lorentz invariant .",
    "it appears quite interesting and suggestive that the lorentz symmetry and the gauge anomaly are linked in this way in this lattice formulation on the basis of the fluffy mirror fermion .",
