    "the central region of the nearby barred seyfert 1 galaxy ngc1097 displays a number of intriguing morphological and kinematic features . at @xmath5 kpc , an almost circular ring - like feature marks the transition between the prominent @xmath6 kpc galactic bar and the relatively diffuse region interior to the ring .",
    "the bar hosts two prominent dust lanes , both originating at around the corotation radius of the bar @xcite , cutting through the inner ring and transforming into nuclear spirals that continue down to @xmath7 pc distance from the active nucleus @xcite .",
    "the dust lanes are accompanied by diffuse ionized gas revealing clear kinematic signatures of bar - induced gas inflow over the entire face of the galaxy @xcite .",
    "neutral gas and ionized gas data cubes @xcite have confirmed the ` abundant ' presence of these two phases of the interstellar medium across the central kpc radius .",
    "however , interferometric molecular gas maps show emission confined to the nuclear ring and the central 2 - 3 hundred parsecs radius @xcite",
    ". moreover , @xcite showed that the bulk of the interstellar gas at the centre of ngc1097 ( like in many other galaxies ) is in the molecular phase , and therefore , a detailed analysis of the central gas concentration needs to account for the different physical conditions .",
    "the interplay between the different phases provide crucial clues to understanding the energies involved in redistributing the gas in a way that leads to the observed phase transition efficiencies .",
    "the discovery of broad ( @xmath8 km / s ) double - peaked h@xmath9 emission lines by @xcite makes ngc1097 also an ideal laboratory for studying the fate of the gas accumulated in the centers of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) . at a distance of 14.5 mpc ( i.e. , @xmath10 pc/ )",
    ", this galaxy is also suitable for high - resolution studies of the physical processes that cause the material / fuel to loose its angular momentum and fall toward the agn ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "although it is straightforward to transport gas down to the central kpc and induce enhanced star formation , it is more difficult to make the gas reach smaller scales ( few pc ) required to fuel an agn . in rotating systems",
    ", perturbations can cause the potential to become non - axisymmetric , and torques exerted by the subsequent non - axisymmetric features are able to drive material toward the centre @xcite .",
    "@xcite have argued that magnetic stress may aid the infalling gas to complete the last few parsecs down to the central supermassive black hole ( smbh ) .    to build a realistic scenario for the fate of the gas that is piling up around an agn to eventually fuel it",
    ", one has to make a detailed analysis of the distribution and kinematics of multiple phases of the interstellar gas in the region of interest .",
    "based on ionized gas kinematic maps ( van de ven & fathi 2010 , hereafter * vdvf * , and piol - ferrer et al .",
    "2013 ) , we have derived a concise picture for ngc1097 , according to which , the gravitational perturbation that once gave rise to the formation of the prominent bar drives the evolution of structure inside the bar as well as the outer spiral arms .",
    "the outer spiral arms are confined between the corotation radius and reach beyond the outer lindblad resonance radius of the main galactic bar .",
    "the circumnuclear ring once formed at the location of the outer inner lindblad resonance @xcite , and has likely migrated toward the centre of the galactic gravitational potential @xcite . inside the ring ,",
    "the non - circular velocities are consistent with the presence of two spiral arms ( in morphology ) .",
    "the nuclear arms are well disguised in optical images , and several image - enhancement techniques have led different authors to argue for a different number of arms ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and vdvf ) .",
    "most of the disagreements concern the inner @xmath11 pc , where increased dust content may have distorted both images and kinematic measurements in the optical and near infrared .",
    "here we present a quantitative analysis of the kinematics of the densest molecular gas within the central kpc radius of ngc1097 based on atacama large millimeter / sub - millimeter array observations of hydrogen cyanide , hcn(43 ) ( proposal 2011.0.00108.s , pi : kohno ) .",
    "we compare the alma kinematic data with a dynamical model that we have previously constructed based on two - dimensional spectroscopic data of ionized gas .",
    "ngc1097 was observed with alma on november 5 and 6 , 2011 , with 14 and 15 antennas , respectively . our band 7 observations targeted the hcn(43 ) line at rest frequency of 354.505 ghz with the original channel spacing of 488.28125 khz .",
    "to increase the signal strength , the data were binned by a factor 20 , leading to an effective channel width of 9.77 mhz ( @xmath12 ) .",
    "the primary beam was @xmath13 with a synthesized beam of @xmath14 ( @xmath15 pc ) and at @xmath16 position angle , sampled at @xmath17/pix .",
    "all data specifications are described in @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig:1 ] shows the integrated intensity map of hcn(43 ) with the velocity moment maps and models , described below . at this resolution",
    "the spiral arms are difficult to see in the integrated intensity map , which sums all velocities , but are easier to detect in the kinematics .",
    "the hcn(43 ) kinematics were derived in two ways .",
    "simple first moment map ( intensity - weighted mean velocity map ) was cross checked with gaussian fitting to each individual spectrum .",
    "we found no significant signatures of non - gaussianity , however , the gaussian fits resulted in a generally noisier velocity field .",
    "we use the moment 1 maps and exclude all pixels for which the corresponding spectrum amplitude - over - noise @xmath18 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] ) .",
    "we find almost no signal outside the area illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] at lower @xmath19 values .",
    "this confirms that the dense gas is confined to a small region around the agn in ngc1097 @xcite .",
    "the ratio between the einstein coefficient and collisional rates for the hcn(43 ) transition results in an estimated critical density of a few times @xmath20 to @xmath21  with a small dependency on temperature .",
    "our calculation is conformal with previously reported densities of @xmath22  at 40 k kinetic temperature ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "such high densities are also consistent with the deep obscuration expected toward the center of a galaxy ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "to constrain the large scale gas kinematics , we have used a mosaic of fabry - perot interferometric observations at 083 spatial sampling , covering a @xmath23 field at 15  spectral resolution @xcite . to further look into the central few 100 parsecs",
    ", we used  two - dimensional velocity field , at 01 spatial sampling and 85  spectral resolution , from the gemini south telescope s integral field unit , covering the inner @xmath24 @xcite .",
    "the combination of the two sets of data is imperative , as they present a coherent dynamical model for ngc1097 from @xmath25 kpc down to @xmath11 pc from its central smbh .",
    "we assume that the galactic disc is predominantly rotating and apply the prescription used in vdvf to quantify the velocity field shown in the top middle panel of fig .  [ fig:1 ] .",
    "we divide the observed velocity field into concentric rings , each containing @xmath26 pixels ( this sets the limit for the innermost radius to @xmath27 pc ) .",
    "we fix the inclination at @xmath28 and apply a @xmath29 minimization to obtain the central coordinates @xmath30 , systemic velocity @xmath31 and position angle pa of the disc . after fixing these parameters",
    ", we make the final @xmath29 fit to the desired modes ( here up to and including 3rd order ) of the fourier decomposition mathematically formulated as @xmath32 \\sin i .",
    "\\label{eq : vlos}\\ ] ]    we apply eq .",
    "( [ eq : vlos ] ) to the hcn(43 ) velocity field and find an agreement between the kinematic and photometric center to within one pixel ( see fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] ) .",
    "each ring is populated at more than 225 degrees , hence , we ensure that we do not need to assume any level of symmetry in the observed non - circular motions .",
    "we derive a systemic velocity of @xmath33  and the kinematic position angle of @xmath34 . in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] we illustrate the different stages of the fits described here , and a three - fold symmetry can be found in the non - circular velocity field ( as predicted for this region in ngc1097 by vdvf ) .",
    "the avreage final residual velocities are 10 , indicating that we have reproduced 95% of the observed velocity features with the fourier decomposition method .",
    "fitting gaussians to each spectrum gives us the average velocity uncertainty for all the pixels at 15 .",
    "these errors are used to derive the uncertainties for the derived kinematics by means of monte carlo simulations .",
    "repeated application to the gaussian - randomized velocity field yields the uncertainties on the fourier parameters .",
    "our simulations show that the average rotation curve uncertainty is 20% ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "similarly , the higher fourier term uncertainties have been calculated , and we plot the first , second and third fourier terms of the hcn(43 ) data together with those derived from the gmos data in fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] .",
    "or @xmath35 terms ( see eqs  ( a12 ) and ( a13 ) in vdvf).,scaledwidth=49.0% ]",
    "the ionized gas velocity fourier terms were modeled by vdvf , who constrained the detailed structure of the nuclear spiral arms and the associated gas inflow from kinematic data ( solid curves in the lower panels of fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] ) .",
    "their nuclear spiral structure is consistent with a weak perturbation in the gravitational potential due to a two - arm logarithmic spiral ( in morphology ) with a pitch angle of @xmath36 derived directly from the fourier expansion of the model velocity field .",
    "similarly large pitch angles in the very central parts of galaxies have also been modeled by @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the innermost @xmath11 pc radius of the data points analyzed by vdvf displayed the largest errors in the third fourier terms , as a consequence of dust contamination .",
    "we test the effect of beam smearing on the derived kinematic parameters by artificially smoothing by a factor two , and find that the fourier terms remain virtually unchanged .",
    "a notable effect of beam smearing is that it may lead to incorrect kinematic center , which in turn may cause uncertainties in the third fourier terms .",
    "@xcite found that smearing of 10could produce up to 10  third fourier terms .",
    "this is less than our error bars . in light of these tests and",
    "following the discussion in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter 2 ) , it unlikely that the innermost values would be affected by beam smearing .    in fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] , we overplot the alma hcn(43 ) velocity fourier components on those derived from the gmos data .",
    "the top panel reveals a very good agreement between the rotation curve ( @xmath37 in eq  1 ) of the hcn(43 ) and that of the h@xmath9 gas in the central 200 pc .",
    "hence , due to the agreement of their overall kinematics , the bulk rotation of the dense gas is co - planar to the ionized interstellar gas .",
    "further light can be shed on the dynamical behaviour of the hcn(43 ) by considering the higher fourier terms .",
    "[ fig:3 ] illustrates the analytic spiral model that has lead to the kinematic derivation of the pitch angle of the nuclear spirals with associated gas inflow rates ( vdvf and * ? ? ?",
    "a simple overplot of the alma data ( filled circles ) displays the striking agreement between the relatively non - contaminated hcn(43 ) kinematic behaviour and the model predictions . _",
    "the analytic spiral model predicts the hcn(43 ) velocity fourier terms down to @xmath27 pc . _    besides the @xmath38 and @xmath39 fourier terms in the velocity field , the non - circular motions also contain marginal @xmath40 terms .",
    "vdvf argued that the @xmath40 terms in the h@xmath9 were most likely due to dust contamination and possible shocks associated with the gas streaming along the nuclear spiral arms ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "this seems to be confirmed here with the hcn(43 ) second terms consistent with zero inside 100 pc radius .     as a function of radius for the hcn(43 ) emitting gas at @xmath22 ( solid curve ) . for comparison",
    ", we also illustrate this parameter for the ionized gas ( dotted curve ) and the molecular counterparts at lower densities ( dashed curve).,scaledwidth=49.0% ]",
    "we use the derived @xmath42 curve to measure the dynamical mass , assuming a thin disc model and velocity uncertainties of @xmath43 .",
    "we derive the mass within the central 100 pc to @xmath44 m@xmath2 , and inside the 40 pc radius , @xmath45 m@xmath2 .",
    "these masses are based on velocity measurements well outside the sphere of influence of the smbh ( @xmath46 pc , * ? ? ?",
    "even so , in theory , a significant contribution from the smbh is expected on the rotating velocities at 40 pc radius .",
    "however , the synthesized beam size of the alma data almost entirely smears out the effect of the smbh at this radius , and therefore , a rotation curve at higher spatial resolution is needed to measure the dynamical mass of the smbh .",
    "furthermore , it should be noted that our mass estimate from the observed cold molecular gas rotation curve are not corrected for the contribution of non - cirular motions in the @xmath42 curve ( see fig .  3 in vdvf ) .",
    "thus , these are likely lower mass limits .",
    "the prescription for deriving mass inflow rates along the nuclear spirals has been presented in vdvf .",
    "they combined the resulting inflow velocity corresponding to the model spiral arm parameters , with the gas density in the spiral arms inferred from  emission line ratios .",
    "they calculated the ionized gas inflow rate as a function of radius , reaching @xmath47 m@xmath2yr@xmath3  at a distance of 100 pc from the central smbh .",
    "the inflow rate was later refined by @xcite who used co gas measurements to derive one order of magnitude higher molecular gas inflow rate for a marginally stable disc model . using this formalism",
    ", @xcite derived the co gas inflow of @xmath48m@xmath2yr@xmath3  at 100 pc radius .    as we compare the hcn(43 ) kinematics with our previous results for ionized and co gas ( vdvf , * ? ? ? * ) , we set the sound speed at @xmath49  and derive the dense gas scale height ( fig .",
    "[ fig:4 ] ) using the observed epicyclic frequency .",
    "we then use the kinematic parameters from the analytic spiral model to trace the gas inflow down to the resolution limit ( @xmath27 pc ) .",
    "the data set at hand does not allow investigating density difference between the nuclear spiral arms and the inter - arm region in ngc1097 .",
    "we assume @xmath50 overdensity , similar to the upper limit of the observed value from the  doublet , and in agreement with numerical simulations @xcite .",
    "we derive the hcn(43 ) inflow rate of @xmath48 m@xmath2yr@xmath3  at 100 pc , and @xmath1 m@xmath2yr@xmath3  at 40 pc from the smbh ( see fig .  [ fig:5 ] ) .",
    "the marginal stability criterion of @xcite ensures that if the gas reaches higher densities , it will be confined to a thinner disc .",
    "hence , changing the gas density by two orders of magnitude will not change the mass inflow rate ( fig .",
    "[ fig:4 ] ) .",
    "however , accounting for the minimum density variation ( arm versus inter - arm ) derived from the  line ratios ( i.e. , @xmath51 ) , the inflow rate would decreased by a factor 2 ( fig .",
    "[ fig:5 ] ) .",
    "the critical value @xmath52 for the transition between liner and sy1 galaxies was found by @xcite with over three orders of magnitudes distribution .",
    "the value that we have calculated here for the dense gas streaming , at 40 pc distance from the smbh in ngc1097 corresponds to @xmath53 @xmath54 , where the eddington accretion rate is onto a smbh mass of @xmath55 m@xmath2  ( based on the central stellar velocity dispersion adopted from * ? ? ?",
    "* and the @xmath56@xmath57 relation of tremaine et al .",
    "2002 ) .",
    "changes the inflow rate as illustrated by the sold and dashed curves.,scaledwidth=49.0% ]",
    "we have presented a detailed kinematics analysis of the dense interstellar gas in the circumnuclear region of the nearby seyfert  1 galaxy ngc1097 .",
    "we used alma band  7 high - resolution observations of the hcn(43 ) emission line , which is postulated to trace @xmath22  at 40 k kinetic temperature .",
    "while visual signatures of a rotation pattern dominate the observed velocity field , we have successfully applied fourier decomposition of the velocity field to unveil the kinematic signatures of two prominent spiral arms ( in morphology ) .",
    "the number of nuclear spiral arms in ngc1097 has been subject to a controversy and in the past years it has been clear that the presence of strong obscuration by dust at the very centre of this galaxy has complicated matters .",
    "we argue here that using velocity information from the hcn(43 ) clarifies matters in an unprecedented way .",
    "we have found a striking agreement between the kinematics of the hcn(43 ) and an analytic spiral model that we previously build using ionized gas kinematic data at similar spatial resolution .",
    "the new alma data confirm that the spiral arms have pitch angle of @xmath58 , down to @xmath41 pc from the smbh in ngc1097 .",
    "we note that some studies have found that the hcn molecule could arise from radiation and vibrational excitation @xcite .",
    "the relative contribution of the radiation pumping could then decrease the gas density with which the hcn is associated , and we note that an assumed density decrease by two orders of magnitudes will yield @xmath59 . for a thin disc , we have then measured the mass inside the 100 pc radius to be @xmath44 m@xmath2 , and inside the 40 pc radius , @xmath45 m@xmath2 . the derived mass at 40 pc agrees with the @xmath60 m@xmath2 , derived from the observed line flux following the procedure described in @xcite .",
    "we have used a constant arm versus inter - arm overdensity of 10% and kinematically derived a dense gas inflow of @xmath48 m@xmath2yr@xmath3  at 100 pc and @xmath1 m@xmath2yr@xmath3  at 40 pc radius . in combination with our previously derived values from the ionized and co gas ,",
    "we calculate a molecular and ionized gas infall of @xmath61 m@xmath2yr@xmath3  at 100 pc and @xmath4 m@xmath2yr@xmath3  at 40 pc distance from the central smbh of ngc1097 .",
    "this inflow corresponds to @xmath62 onto a black hole in ngc1097 with a mass of @xmath55 m@xmath2 . from the current data ,",
    "it is not clear how much , if any at all , of the observed hcn(43 ) is radiationally excited by the active nucleus . in the presence of radiational excitation , the dense gas scale height that we present here will be lower limits .",
    "notwithstanding , the gas inflow rates remain unchanged .",
