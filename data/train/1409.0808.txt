    "the concept of a quantum weak value , introduced in 1988 by aharonov , albert , and vaidman @xcite , has allowed the development of novel and important experimental techniques to study quantum systems  @xcite .",
    "the amplification of small signals beyond technical noise @xcite , the direct determination of quantum states @xcite and geometric phases  @xcite , and the characterization of the nonclassical behavior of quantum systems @xcite are a few examples of its usefulness ( check @xcite for a more extensive list of applications ) . together with the new interferometric concept , the original paper and some follow - ups also suggested that weak measurements could lead to a new interpretation of quantum phenomena .",
    "these somewhat controversial ideas , however , were the target of lots of discussions as can be seen in the comments following the 1988 original paper  @xcite .    recently , a new set of proposals and experiments has revived some of this controversy by suggesting even more radical ways of reinterpreting quantum mechanics @xcite .",
    "for instance , in a recent theoretical work , aharonov _ et al .",
    "_ argued that a particular weak measurement setup for photons allowed one to state that `` in the curious way of quantum mechanics , photon polarization may exist where there is no photon at all '' @xcite .",
    "the idea was reinforced both in a _ news _ & _ views _ article of nature physics  @xcite and in an experiment performed with neutrons  @xcite .",
    "the first discusses the results of @xcite concluding that `` polarization could be effectively isolated from the photons carrying it '' , while the second implements an equivalent interferometer to the one proposed in @xcite and argues that `` the experimental results suggest that the system behaves as if the neutrons go through one beam path , while their magnetic moment travels along the other '' @xcite .",
    "the phenomenon was nicknamed `` quantum cheshire cat '' , in a reference to the cat that is separated from its grin in the novel _",
    "alice s adventures in wonderland _ , by lewis carroll .    according to @xcite , in order to obtain a weak value one must interact the system to be measured with a continuous degree of freedom described by a wavefunction , which will act as a quantum pointer . before the interaction , the system is pre - selected in a known state @xmath0 and , after interacting with the pointer , a post - selection is made on a specific state of the measured system @xmath1 , finally preparing the pointer in a state that depends on both @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "given the weakness of the interaction , the wavefunction of the pointer is displaced by a small amount to which the weak value is proportional .",
    "most of the controversy in trying to extract a new interpretation out of weak measurements lies in the attempt to attach physical reality to the otherwise mathematically defined weak values . in @xcite ,",
    "the continuous degrees of freedom acting as quantum meters are not considered in the construction of the argument for the new interpretation . in the present work",
    "we show that by taking these degrees of freedom into account , both the theoretical predictions and experimental results that motivated the somewhat unusual `` cheshire cat '' interpretation can be explained as simple quantum interference where no detachment between the photon and its polarization or between the neutron and its magnetic moment is actually required .",
    "we begin by quickly revisiting the proposal of @xcite , then we proceed to explain it with standard quantum mechanics interference and we finally show how a similar approach also explains the experiment described in  @xcite .",
    "in @xcite , the authors base their proposal in the interferometer shown in figure [ fig : interf ] which is designed to prepare the photon in state @xmath2 and post - select it in state @xmath3 , both specified below : @xmath4 and @xmath5 correspond to the photon being in each arm of the interferometer shown in figure [ fig : interf ] , and @xmath6 and @xmath7 represent its horizontal and vertical polarization components .",
    "the left and right circular polarization states can be written as @xmath8 and these are the eigenstates of the `` spin '' angular momentum operator for the photon .    in order to do the desired pre- and post - selection , beam splitters ( bs@xmath9 and bs@xmath10 ) , a half - wave plate ( hwp ) , a phase shifter ( ps ) and a polarizing beam splitter ( pbs )",
    "are placed and adjusted in a way that a photon on the state @xmath3 right before hwp will always click at detector d@xmath9 ; if it is in any state orthogonal to @xmath3 , it necessarily clicks elsewhere .",
    "the adjustments of the devices are described in @xcite .    ) with polarization @xmath11 , right after which we have the state @xmath2 from eq .",
    "( [ psi ] ) , called _ pre - selection state_. after reflection from mirrors on both arms @xmath12 and @xmath13 , we want to make the _ post - selection _ of the state @xmath3 from ( [ phi ] ) on detector d@xmath9 .",
    "a half - wave plate ( hwp ) interchanges @xmath11 and @xmath14 polarizations on arm @xmath12 and a phase shifter ( ps ) adds a specific phase right after it , so that , after a second beam splitter ( bs@xmath10 ) and a polarizing beam splitter ( pbs ) that transmits only horizontal polarization , we assure that d@xmath9 will always click for @xmath3 and never click for any state orthogonal to it.,title=\"fig:\",width=377 ] +    after being prepared in the state @xmath2 , the photon interacts with devices positioned in both interferometer paths .",
    "these devices act as probes and can perform either projective measurements ( also called `` strong '' ) or weak measurements .",
    "although in @xcite the authors considered them as quantum devices , the description of their quantum state is not included in the paper .",
    "we will explicitly represent their quantum states here , though , as this is the essential piece for describing the phenomenon as quantum interference . in arm",
    "@xmath12 there is a polarization detector whose quantum state @xmath15 changes to @xmath16 if a photon of polarization @xmath17 propagates through that arm , or stays at @xmath15 if a photon propagates through arm @xmath13 .",
    "meanwhile , in arm @xmath13 there is a quantum device to measure the presence of the photon , i.e. a device whose quantum state @xmath18 changes into @xmath19 if a photon propagates through that arm , or stays at @xmath18 if a photon propagates through arm @xmath12 . in the proposal of @xcite the probe of arm",
    "@xmath12 is a combination of birrefringent materials that produces a positive horizontal displacement for a photon with polarization @xmath20 and a negative horizontal displacement for a photon with polarization @xmath21 .",
    "the pointer state @xmath15 of the device is thus associated to the center of the beam in the horizontal direction .",
    "the probe in arm @xmath13 is a glass sheet that displaces the photon beam up .",
    "the pointer state @xmath18 of the device is thus associated to the center of the beam in the vertical direction .",
    "if the beam displacements produced by the measurement devices are greater than the beam diameter , then we have a projective measurement where we can associate the vertical displacement with the photon path and the horizontal displacement with the polarization of the photon propagating through arm @xmath12 . if the beam displacements are much smaller than the beam diameters , then we are in the weak measurements regime . in this case",
    "we have , for instance , @xmath22 with @xmath23 , as opposite to @xmath24 for a projective measurement .",
    "after the interaction with the measurement devices in each path , the composite state of the photon and the pointers is @xmath25.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] note that the changes in the state of the pointer are only defined by the shapes of the wavefunctions of the probes and by their displacements and , therefore , are unaffected by global phases and normalization factors .",
    "for that reason we have just added a factor @xmath26 which accounts for these global factors ( normalization and phase ) but does not influence by any means the overall analysis .    to make a post - selection of the results only for photons that leave the pbs in direction to d@xmath9 means to project the above state ( [ interaction ] ) on @xmath3 from ( [ phi ] ) .",
    "we end up with the following quantum state for the pointers @xmath27.\\ ] ] note that in the state ( [ projection ] ) there is entanglement between the pointers , meaning that there are quantum correlations between the measurement devices placed in arms @xmath12 and @xmath13 , even though they have never interacted directly with each other @xcite .",
    "if the devices make projective measurements , there are three possibilities for each photon : either the photon has an up displacement greater than the beam diameter or the photon has a positive ( negative ) horizontal displacement greater than the beam diameter . in these cases ,",
    "if one assumes a real trajectory for the photon , the first situation is compatible with propagation through arm @xmath13 , and the second ( third ) is compatible with propagation through arm @xmath12 and polarization @xmath20(@xmath21 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "when the measurement devices interact weakly with the photon , producing vertical and horizontal displacements much smaller than the beam diameter , such assumptions about past trajectories of the photon simply can not hold true anymore due to the quantum interference between the different possible paths .",
    "in fact , it is well known that attributing physical reality to the past of quantum particles inside interferometers leads to paradoxes @xcite . however , that is exactly what the authors of @xcite do when they extend the interpretation used in the projective measurements to the weak interaction case .",
    "they consider that if the average vertical displacement of a set of photons is the same as the displacement of the wavefunction of one photon eventually propagating through arm @xmath13 , then this indicates that the photons had propagated through this arm . in the same way",
    ", they also assume that if the average horizontal displacement of a set of photons is the same of the wavefunction of one photon eventually propagating through arm @xmath12 with polarization @xmath20 , then there is a @xmath20 polarization in arm @xmath12 .",
    "this is the origin of the paradox when concluding that `` the photon is in the left arm ( ... ) while the angular momentum is in the right arm '' @xcite .",
    "as we show in the following , there is no such paradox if we describe the phenomenon as simple quantum interference .",
    "let us now explicitly describe the pointers as suggested in @xcite , which will be the transversal beam profiles of the photon in the fashion of a bialynicki - birula  sipe photon wave function @xcite in the paraxial regime . in this regime ,",
    "the beam propagation is highly directional , such that its state can be written as the product of a transversal function in the @xmath28 plane ( with @xmath29-dependent parameters ) and a function that describes its evolution while propagating in the @xmath29 direction @xcite .",
    "the beam polarization can also be treated as an independent parameter in this regime .",
    "we may consider that the transversal properties of the beam do not vary much with the propagation through the interferometer , such that the transversal wave function can be written as a function only of the transversal components @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "in the proposal of @xcite , @xmath15 corresponds to a wave function @xmath32 and @xmath18 corresponds to @xmath33 , such that @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath19 correspond to the same functions displaced by @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 , respectively .",
    "hence , by defining @xmath39 , the state ( [ projection ] ) is described by the transversal wave function : @xmath40,\\ ] ] where @xmath41 again is a normalization factor that depends on how much the components of ( [ wavefunction ] ) overlap with each other and on the shape of @xmath42 . if the detector d@xmath9 is a screen sensitive to the photon position , after many runs we can build the distribution @xmath43 on it .",
    "the pattern showed will depend on how orthogonal these three displaced functions above are , and how their overlap creates interference . in a",
    "( projective ) measurement regime , the interaction displaces each term above the beam radius , such that their overlap is negligible and there is no interference .",
    "each part of the function is then identifiable on the screen , offering trustworthy information about the measured quantities .",
    "this behaviour is clear when we realize that , without significant overlap of the pointer states , that is for instance @xmath44 , the probability density is approximately @xmath45 can not be approximated by ( [ prob - dens ] )  it may even look like the same function displaced by some other amount .",
    "but , as we discussed before , the reason of the paradoxes in @xcite is to consider that the resultant displacement may be read as a measurement in the ordinary sense .",
    "using the approximations @xmath46 and @xmath47 in ( [ wavefunction ] ) , we end up with @xmath48    according to the arguments of @xcite , this result is compatible with the situation where the photon is measured in the left arm of the interferometer ( the beam was displaced up by @xmath38 ) and , at the same time , there is positive angular momentum on the right arm of the interferometer ( the beam was displaced sideways by @xmath36 ) .",
    "however , as pointed out in our calculations , the probability of finding the photons at this particular range of positions can be interpreted as simple interference .",
    "note that any quantum continuous variable could have been used as a probe .",
    "the photon wavefunction is a particularly effective example because it fulfils both the superposition principle and the approximations discussed above .",
    "also note that the same holds true for the schrdinger wavefunction .",
    "actually , our treatment is suitable to describe even the light intensity distribution on the detector if classical electromagnetic waves are sent through the interferometer .    to make this issue clearer , in figure [ fig :",
    "graf](a ) we plot @xmath49 , which is the component of the photon wavefunction that comes from the arm @xmath13 in ( [ wavefunction ] ) , with @xmath32 being a gaussian function with width @xmath50 centred at zero . in figure",
    "[ fig : graf](b ) we plot @xmath51 , which is the component of the photon wavefunction that comes from arm @xmath12 in ( [ wavefunction ] ) .",
    "we can see that for @xmath52 the major contribution to the wavefunction of ( [ wavefunction ] ) comes from @xmath53 .",
    "but the term @xmath51 interferes destructively with @xmath53 for negative @xmath30 and constructively for positive @xmath30 , resulting in an overall positive displacement in the horizontal direction for the wavefunction even if this term is small , as can be seen in [ fig : graf](c ) . a similar argument",
    "was used in @xcite to present a classical explanation of the experimental results of @xcite . in @xcite",
    "the authors performed experiments with a nested mach - zehnder interferometer and concluded that `` the photons tell us that they have been in the parts of the interferometer through which they could not pass '' @xcite . but again , this odd conclusion was achieved through the attribution of a physical reality to the weak value of a weak measurement .     and ( b ) @xmath54 $ ] , for @xmath55 and @xmath56",

    "@xcite was similar to the theoretical proposal of @xcite and is depicted in figure [ fig : experim ] . after going through the first beam splitter and the spin rotators ,",
    "the neutron is prepared in the state @xmath58 and @xmath5 represent the neutron states in the corresponding interferometer arm and @xmath59 are the eigenvectors of the neutron @xmath30-component spin operator .",
    "there is a spin analyzer before d@xmath9 , such that the detection of a neutron in d@xmath9 is associated to the projector @xmath60 where @xmath61 is a controllable phase .",

    "magnetic fields are applied in the interferometer paths to produce a small rotation of the neutrons spin .",
    "the phase @xmath61 of the projectors from ( [ pi1 ] ) and ( [ pi2 ] ) is varied and it is observed if the detection counts in d@xmath9 and d@xmath10 depend or not on @xmath61 . when no magnetic field is applied , there can be no interference since the spin states in each path are orthogonal for the state ( [ psin ] ) , so the counts on both detectors should not depend on @xmath61 .",
    "when a magnetic field is applied in path @xmath12 changing the neutron spin state from @xmath20 to @xmath65 with @xmath66 , the @xmath21 component of the wavefunction of this path can interfere with the wavefunction of path @xmath13 , such that the counts in both detectors should depend on @xmath61 .",

    "all these predictions are confirmed by the experiments @xcite .",

    "in contrast to that , a small magnetic field has on average a significant effect only in path @xmath12 , while it has none in path @xmath13 .",

    "@xcite suggest a potential use of the quantum cheshire cat . in @xcite , the authors state : `` suppose that we wish to perform a measurement in which the magnetic moment plays the central role , whilst the charge causes unwanted disturbances .",
    "the question that arises is whether it might be possible to remove this disturbance , in a post - selected manner , by producing a cheshire cat where the charge is confined to a region of the experiment far from the magnetic moment . '' in the last paragraph of the discussion in @xcite there is an analogous proposal . in our framework , though , it is clear that disturbances in any degree of freedom of either the pre- or the post - selection state will change the final state of the pointer , due to a change of the amplitude or phase of each component in ( [ projection ] )  and therefore ( [ approx ] ) will be different . the randomness of these disturbances leads to decoherence of the pointer state , therefore messing up the results .    in our opinion ,",
    "the paradoxical conclusions that a photon may be separated from its polarization @xcite or that a neutron can be separated from its spin @xcite presented as the ` quantum cheshire cat ' effect are one more apparent paradox that arises whenever we attribute physical reality to quantum superposition states , for instance when describing a quantum particle inside an interferometer prior to its detection @xcite .",
    "recent works have also discussed the quantum cheshire cat , specifically the results of denkmayr _ et al .",
    "naive interpretations of delayed choice experiments @xcite or quantum erasers @xcite lead to similar apparent paradoxes .",
    "as we have shown here , the predictions of @xcite and the experiments of @xcite can be understood as simple quantum interference , with no separation between the quantum particles and their internal degrees of freedom , and we hope our results provide a better understanding of the phenomenon reinforcing that no interpretation more strange than standard quantum mechanics is required .",
