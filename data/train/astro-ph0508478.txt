    "coronal mass ejections ( cmes ) are one of the most spectacular phenomena in the solar corona .",
    "cmes show some kind of association with various forms of solar activities ; 40% of cmes were associated with flares , but more than 70% were associated with eruptive prominence or disappearing filaments ( munro et al . 1979 ; webb & hundhausen 1987 ; see kahler 1992 for review ) .",
    "on the other hand , observations with soft x - ray telescope ( sxt ) aboard _ yohkoh _ revealed that formations of giant arcades are associated with filament eruptions that are not associated with flares ( tsuneta et al .",
    "1992 ; hiei et al .",
    "1993 , hanaoka et al . 1994 ; mcallister et al .",
    "although such arcades are usually not recognized as flares because of their weak x - ray intensity , they have arcade structures with expanding cusp - shaped loops ( helmet streamer ) , which is very similar to flares . from this and other evidence ( e.g. yamamoto et al .",
    "2002 ) it has been argued that their mechanism is the same as that of flares ; magnetic reconnection .",
    "considering these observations , shibata ( 1996 ; 1999 ) suggest that cmes , filament eruptions , flares / giant arcades can be understood in a unified view : mass ejection and magnetic energy release via magnetic reconnection ( fig .",
    "[ flmo ] ) .",
    "although each cme shows different , complex structure , many of them have a typical structure , so called `` three - part structure '' , which consists of a bright core , a surrounding cavity , and a slightly bright outer edge ( illing & hundhausen 1985 ) . a prominence surrounded by dark cavity",
    "is often observed inside a helmet streamer in the pre - eruption stage , and this structure appears to swell once an eruption starts .",
    "this scenario is thought to be a simple interpretation of the formation of a three - part cme ( see hundhausen 1999 for review ) . on the other hand , lin et al .",
    "( 2004 ) developed a semi - analytical reconnection model of a cme and explained three - part structure formation .",
    "on the other hand , _ coronal dimmings _ explained as the euv or sxr decrease , are often observed around post - erupting loops ( sterling & hudson 1997 ; zarro et al . 1999 ) .",
    "the observation with coronal diagnostic spectrometer ( cds ) aboard solar and heliospheric observatory ( soho ) showed that dimming was caused not by the decrease in temperature but by the decrease in plasma density ( harrison & lyons 2000 ) .",
    "this results indicate that the mass which existed there in the pre - eruption stage are lost .",
    "furthermore , harra & sterling ( 2001 ) showed blue - shifted motion coincided with coronal dimming in the cds observations , and therefore , suggested the lost mass is supplied to the cme . on the other hand ,",
    "reconnection inflow can rarefy the inflow region ( tsuneta 1996 , nitta at al . 2001 ) .",
    "it remains unclear which mechanism causes the dimmings .    in this paper",
    "we propose a new model that explains the formation of the three - part structure of cmes and the mechanism of dimmings self - consistently .",
    "we performed 2.5-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) simulations of a coronal mass ejection associated with a giant cusp - shaped arcade , where 2.5-d means that three vector components are included but the space is two dimension .",
    "the numerical results are compared with the observations of cmes and associated phenomena in order to clarify their evolution processes .    before describing the numerical model in detail",
    ", it would be better to discuss the situation of the problem .",
    "in solar flares , magnetic energy is thought to be converted into kinetic and thermal energies by magnetic reconnection . in the corona , because the thermal conductivity is very high , thermal energy is conducted very rapidly along the field lines .",
    "when the conducted thermal energy heats the dense chromospheric plasma ( or nonthermal electrons collide to chromospheric plasma ) , the gas pressure increases suddenly .",
    "the pressure gradient generates upward flow to the corona , and the flare loop is filled by the plasma comes from the chromosphere .",
    "this process is called as chromospheric evaporation ( hirayama 1974 ) .",
    "the flare loops filled by the hot dense plasma loses energy by radiation .",
    "there are three key physical processes for energy balance : conduction , radiation , and reconnection .",
    "the time scales of conductive cooling , radiative cooling , and reconnection heating are @xmath0 @xmath1 and @xmath2 respectively , where @xmath3 is the boltzmann constant , @xmath4(@xmath5 cgs ) is heat conduction coefficient along magnetic field @xcite , @xmath6 is the radiative loss function ( raymond , et al . 1976 ) .",
    "the time scale of reconnection heating is derived from poynting flux of inflow region . in the condition of giant arcade in quiet region",
    "( @xmath7 @xmath8 , @xmath9 k , @xmath10 cm , @xmath11 g , @xmath12 cm s@xmath13 , and @xmath14 erg @xmath15 s@xmath13 ; yamamoto et al .",
    "2002 ) , @xmath16 sec , @xmath17 sec , and @xmath18 sec .",
    "since @xmath19 is much longer than @xmath20 , we can neglect the effect of radiative cooling for this reconnection problem . though @xmath21 is also longer than @xmath20 at the initial state , the effect of conduction",
    "can not be neglected because the temperature increases due to reconnection heating , so that @xmath21 becomes comparable to or even shorter than @xmath20 .",
    "although magnetic reconnection coupled with heat conduction is important for solar flares , mhd simulations for such a problem are performed by only few researchers because of its numerical difficulty ( yokoyama & shibata , 1997,1998 , 2001 , chen et al .",
    "these authors adopted antiparallel field for initial magnetic configuration .",
    "for the comparison with observations , however , we have to perform simulations in more realistic conditions . in our simulation , we adopted initial magnetic filed configuration of chen and shibata ( 2000 ) and include the effect of heat conduction and discuss what difference the effect makes .",
    "the initial results of this study have already been published in shiota et al .",
    "( 2003 ) .",

    "the numerical results of the conductive case are compared with _",
    "observations in  4 .",
    "finally , summary and discussions are given in  5 .",
    "we perform simulations with a multi - step implicit scheme ( hu 1989 ) for two cases : a case without heat conduction ( case a ) and a case with heat conduction ( case b ) .",
    "two - and - a - half dimensional time - dependent resistive mhd equations considered in this study are as follows : @xmath22 @xmath23 @xmath24 @xmath25 where @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 is magnetic resistivity , the quantity @xmath29 and @xmath30 are the dimensionless heat conduction function and its coefficient .",
    "the seven independent variables are the plasma density ( @xmath31 ) , temperature ( @xmath32 ) , velocity ( @xmath33 ) , magnetic flux function ( @xmath34 ) , and perpendicular component of magnetic field ( @xmath35 ) .",
    "the seven variables normalized with the characteristic values of giant arcades are used in the equations ( [ eqco ] ) - ( [ eneq ] ) .",
    "the characteristic values of length , density , and temperature are obtained from the yohkoh observations ( see yamamoto et al . 2002 ) , which are @xmath36 cm , @xmath37 g @xmath8 ( i.e. , @xmath38 @xmath8 ) , and @xmath39 k , respectively . the unit of velocity is @xmath40 where @xmath3 is boltzmann constant and @xmath41 is the mass of hydrogen atom . the unit of magnetic field strength is chosen as @xmath42 the parameter @xmath43 is the ratio of gas to magnetic pressure at the surface of the flux rope ( magnetic configuration is descried in next subsection ) .",
    "@xmath43 is chosen to be 0.01 .",
    "the unit of time becomes @xmath44 , where @xmath45 is the local alfvn velocity around the flux rope ( @xmath46 km s@xmath13 ) and @xmath47 s.    in only case b , we assume anisotropic spitzer type heat conduction , @xmath29 and @xmath30 in equation ( [ eneq ] ) are written as follows : @xmath48 @xmath49    the resistivity(@xmath28 ) is taken as an anomalous type as follows : @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the ( relative ion - electron ) drift velocity , and the dimensionless parameters are assumed as @xmath52 , and @xmath53 . it is known that the anomalous resistivity may be caused by plasma instabilities ( coppi & friedland 1971 ) in localized region , and localized resistivity triggers fast reconnection ( ugai & tsuda , 1977 ) .",
    "the simulation box ( @xmath54 , @xmath55 ) is discretized by @xmath56 grid points , which are distributed non - uniformly in the @xmath57-direction and uniformly in the @xmath58-direction . the left ( @xmath59 ) , the right ( @xmath60 ) , and the upper boundaries ( @xmath61 ) are free boundaries where the plasma , magnetic field , and waves could pass through freely . the bottom of the simulation box is a line - tying boundary where all quantities , except for @xmath32 , are fixed outside of the emerging flux region ( described in section [ efr ] ) .",
    "@xmath32 is determined by extrapolation , i.e. , the value was specified to be the same as that at its neighboring point .",
    "initial magnetic field configuration is shown in figure [ init ] .",
    "we adopt this configuration to mimic a cross section of the arcade and the flux rope shown in figure [ flmo ] .",
    "this configuration is presented by three separate current elements ( see chen & shibata 2000 ) : a line current contained within flux rope ( which determines @xmath62 ) , its image current below the photosphere ( which determines @xmath63 ) , and four line currents just below the photosphere ( which determines @xmath64 ) .",
    "potential field created by those currents are expressed as follows : @xmath65 [ ( x-0.3)^2+(y+0.3)^2]}{[(x+1.5)^2+(y+0.3)^2][(x-1.5)^2+(y+0.3)^2]}},\\ ] ] @xmath66 @xmath67 @xmath68 where @xmath69 is the height of the flux rope and @xmath70 is the radius of the flux rope , which determine the configuration of magnetic field . in this study",
    ", we set @xmath71 and @xmath72 .",
    "the coefficient @xmath73 in the formula ( [ psif ] ) represents the strength of background field .",
    "this is determined by trial and error in order to guarantee that the flux rope center approximately keeps stable for long enough time . in this study , it is set to be 0.2534 .",
    "this physical meaning is as follows .",
    "if we remove the flux rope , the magnetic field configuration are potential quadrupole field , produced by the four line currents and the image current below the photosphere .",
    "this configuration makes a null point above the photosphere .",
    "if we set at the null point a flux rope whose radius is infinitesimal , the configuration is in unstable equilibrium .",
    "however in the simulation , the flux rope has a finite radius and therefore , we have to seek the solution very near to equilibrium .    to satisfy the force balance within the flux rope , a perpendicular magnetic component ( i.e. , @xmath35 ) was introduced inside the flux rope :",
    "@xmath74 other quantities are set to be uniform ; @xmath75@xmath76 .",
    "statistical studies by feynman & martin ( 1995 ) show that reconnection favorable emerging flux is correlated well with cmes .",
    "the meaning of reconnection favorable is that the orientation of newly emerging flux is opposite to that of pre - existing large scale coronal magnetic field . with numerical simulations ,",
    "chen & shibata ( 2000 ) confirmed the discovery of feynman & martin ( 1995 ) that such emerging flux can trigger a cme .    in this study , we adopt one case of chen - shibata model , in which newly emerging flux appears just below the flux rope .",
    "the emerging process was realized by changing the magnetic field at the bottom boundary within @xmath77 .",
    "time evolutions of density and temperature distributions in cases a and b are shown in figures [ casea ] and [ caseb ] , respectively .",
    "the dynamical evolutions of both cases are almost the same as that of case a in chen & shibata ( 2000 ) .",
    "magnetic reconnection occurs between the newly emerged flux and magnetic field just above it , which leads to partial magnetic cancellation , and hence the decrease in magnetic pressure .",
    "the magnetized plasma at both sides ( left and right to the magnetic null point [ x point ] ) moves inward .",
    "then magnetic field lines at both sides are pushed in , and therefore a current sheet is formed near the x point .",
    "the current density inside of the sheet increases nearly exponentially .",
    "when the condition equation ( [ anomal ] ) is satisfied , anomalous resistivity sets in and fast reconnection occurs .",
    "the upward outflow associated with reconnection pushes the flux rope up .",
    "the clearest difference between two cases is the difference in density and temperature distributions within the reconnection outflows ( see figures [ casea ] and [ caseb ] ) . in both cases ,",
    "the plasma that passes through the reconnection region ( the x point ) is heated very much by joule heating .",
    "however , in case b , because the heat conduction function become much larger in high temperature region , the heat is conducted along the field lines .",
    "therefore , the temperature in reconnection region and within the reconnection outflows in case b becomes lower than that in case a. the gas pressure at the reconnection region balances with the gas and magnetic pressure outside the current sheet .",
    "magnetic field strength and gas pressure at outside of the current sheet are almost the same in both cases .",
    "therefore , plasma density at reconnection region in case b become higher .",
    "it is found that global dynamics of the two cases are almost the same .",
    "figure [ rec](a ) shows trajectories of the flux ropes and the x points , and figure [ rec](b ) shows reconnection rates , in both cases .",
    "a little difference of dynamics is caused by the difference in the time evolutions of reconnection rate .",
    "reconnection rate is defined as the reconnected magnetic flux per unit time and equals to the electric field @xmath78 in the diffusion region , i.e. , @xmath79 where @xmath80 and @xmath81 are magnetic flux function and current density at the x point , respectively , @xmath82 and @xmath83 are velocity and magnetic field of inflow region , respectively , and @xmath84 is the width of the current sheet . the reconnection rate in case a saturated earlier than in case b. why reconnection rate in case a lower than in case b ?",
    "current density distribution at @xmath85 in both case are displayed in figure [ xp ] .",
    "it is found that the current density at the x point in case b is larger than that in case a and the width of the current sheet in case b is thinner than that in case a. the reason is as follows : in the diffusion region , plasma is heated by magnetic energy dissipation , and gas pressure are increased there .",
    "the enhanced gas pressure balances the magnetic pressure in the inflow region . in case b ,",
    "the heat of the inside plasma is conducted along the field lines , and therefore the inside pressure becomes less than that in case a. as the sheet is pressed more and more , the magnetic dissipation ( plasma heating ) becomes larger , and then the gas pressure balances magnetic pressure in the outside region . in other words ,",
    "the compressibility is enhanced in case b. this is the reason why the reconnection is faster in case b. this results are consistent with sato et al .",

    "yokoyama & shibata ( 1998 , 2001 ) performed mhd simulationeach of magnetic reconnection coupled with heat conduction . considering the energy balance between the conduction cooling and the reconnection heating ,",
    "they derived a temperature scaling law of the top of a flare loop ; @xmath86 where @xmath87 and @xmath31 are magnetic field strength and density in the inflow region , and @xmath88 is the half length of the loop which is comparable to the height of the x point .",
    "we applied the scaling law to our numerical results .",
    "however , in our simulation non - uniform magnetic field is assumed for the initial condition , in contrast to that anti - parallel uniform magnetic field is used in yokoyama - shibata s numerical simulation .",
    "it is not easy to define a typical value of magnetic filed strength here , so we take the average one in the inflow region . because of non - uniform magnetic field , the average magnetic field strength depends on the area we choose as the inflow region .",
    "we chose several cases ( cases a , b , and c , as shown in figure [ tscl]c ) of the definition of the inflow regions .",
    "we tabulate the results for the definition of the inflow regions in table 1 .",
    "the values @xmath89 and @xmath90 in table 1 are the averages of magnetic field and density in each inflow region on the side of the x point @xmath91 at @xmath85 ( fig .",

    "we calculate the theoretical temperature predicted by yokoyama - shibata s scaling law .",
    "it is found that the temperatures predicted by yokoyama - shibata s scaling law are roughly consistent with our results .",
    "the temperature of the loop tops may be determined by the condition just outside of the x point .",
    ".temperature derived from yokoyama - shibata scaling law [ cols= \" < , < , < , < , < \" , ]     from figures [ slow ] and [ slow2 ] , it is found that these slow shocks continue to propagate around the flux rope , the shock fronts form spiral patterns ( white and gray lines in fig . [ slow2 ] ) .",
    "these slow shocks correspond to the two discontinuities nearest to the flux rope in figure [ tra ] .",
    "why the slow shock structure around flux rope has not been found so far ?",
    "most of reconnection studies until now adopted anti - parallel magnetic field for initial condition .",
    "figure [ slowm ] is a schematic pictures of the results of the simulation . in the anti - parallel case , the results of reconnection forms slow shocks as shown in upper right panels of figure [ slowm ] .",
    "the slow shocks propagate along field ( along the current sheet ) . on the other hands , in our numerical simulation",
    ", initially current sheet does not exist .",
    "the field above the flux rope are closed . because the slow shock propagates along the closed field , the spiral patterns are formed .",
    "we can see the region where the density decreases ( rarefaction ) around the flux rope and the cusp - shaped loop in both cases , just outside the slow shocks discussed above .",
    "why does the rarefaction occur ?    in order to examine the motion of the plasma we calculate the divergence of the velocity at @xmath85 ( fig .",
    "[ div ] ) .",
    "figure [ div]a shows div @xmath92 with gray scales where the white indicates divergence ( expansion ) and the black indicates the opposite ( compression ) . in order to clarify the mass motion ,",
    "the velocity is divided into two components which are parallel and perpendicular to the magnetic field , shown as follows ,",
    "@xmath93 @xmath94 we also calculate the divergence of the two components of the velocity ( fig .",
    "[ div ] b and c ) .",
    "when fast reconnection starts , upward and downward directed reconnection outflows are generated .",
    "the upward one collides with the flux rope and compresses the magnetic field ( region 1 displayed in fig .",
    "[ div]b ) .",
    "since this compression causes a magnetic pressure increase and leads to flow along the field lines .",
    "in fact , the region 1 shows divergence in figure [ div]b .",
    "the magnetic pressure increase in region 1 pushes the flux rope up .",
    "the rise motion of the flux rope compresses the magnetic loops above it , and leads to the magnetic pressure increase .",
    "in addition , because the magnetic field strength in the initial condition decreases as @xmath95 , the magnetic pressure decreases very rapidly . as the flux rope rises higher , the magnetic pressure inside the flux rope becomes larger than that in the ambient plasma , which leads to the expansion to the direction perpendicular to the magnetic field of the structure ( region 2 displayed in fig .",
    "[ div]b ) .",
    "this expansion is caused by the magnetic field and therefore occurs only in the region where magnetic fields are dominant .",
    "in fact , the boundary between divergence and convergence is located quite near the boundary plasma @xmath96 as shown in figure [ div]a . above the region plasma @xmath97 ,",
    "convergence is present because the plasma is swept up .",
    "on the other hand , fast reconnection generates reconnection inflows on both sides of the reconnection region .",
    "the reconnection inflow causes the expansion of the magnetic field , and therefore the expansion of the plasma in the perpendicular direction ( region 3 displayed in fig .",
    "[ div]b ) .",
    "the expansion causes a decrease of pressure , and hence plasma flows in along the field lines .",
    "in fact , region 3 shows convergence in figure [ div]c .",
    "additionally , this converging flow causes the expansion in region 4 in fig .",
    "[ div]c note that we can see a converged layer on the inner boundary of region 4 in figures [ div]a and [ div]c .",
    "this corresponds to the slow shock discussed in the previous section .",
    "these rarefaction mechanisms work simultaneously . the plasma , which flows into the reconnection region and the slow shocks , flows out partly upward and the rest flows out downward .",
    "the mass which previously existed in the rarefied regions goes partly to the cme and the the rest to the cusp - shaped loop .",
    "we synthesized soft x - ray images from the density and temperature in the numerical results .",
    "( lower panels of figure [ casea ] and [ caseb ] ) these images were produced by taking account of the filter response function of the soft x - ray telescope ( sxt ) aboard _ yohkoh _ ( tsuneta et al . 1991 ) .",
    "seen in figure [ casea ] , the density of the reconnection outflow is very low because the temperature is very high in case a. therefore , the high temperature regions in the flare loop are observed as cavities .",
    "such a flare loop have never been observed in _ yohkoh _ observations , while the appearance of loop in case b is consistent with observations ( for example fig .",
    "[ obs ] ) .",
    "the results of adiabatic case are quite different from the real corona .",
    "therefore , we compared the results of case b with _ yohkoh_/sxt observations , in order to provide new interpretations of observed features .",
    "figure [ obs ] shows the giant arcade ( helmet streamer ) formation on 1992 january 24 which was reported by hiei et al .",
    "( 1993 ) . the event is thought to be face - on observation of giant arcade ( although it has a little orientation , see shiota et al .",
    "2003 ) . in this event , after a y - shaped structure ( fig [ obs]b and c ) is ejected , a cusp - shaped arch is formed , and then the arch seems to grow larger and larger .",
    "these evolution in the event is consistent with our numerical results ( fig .",
    "[ caseb ] ) . in the numerical results ,",
    "after a y - shaped structure is ejected , a cusp - shaped loop seems to grow larger and larger .",
    "therefore , shiota et al . (",
    "2003 ) suggest that the y - shaped structure in the event may correspond to the slow and fast shocks associated with magnetic reconnection .",
    "it is known that a slow shock associated with magnetic reconnection is dissociated into a conduction front and an isothermal slow shock in solar flares ( forbes et al .",
    "1989 ; yokoyama & shibata 1997 ) . on the other hand , because the temperature of arcades is not as high as that of flares , the slow shock is dissociated slightly under the condition of arcades ( see shiota et al .",
    "2003 ) .",
    "what is the outer boundary of the flux rope in the numerical results ? in figures [ slow ] , the boundary is found to be a weakly current density enhanced layer , which corresponds to weak slow shocks ( see  [ sss ] ) .",
    "these slow shocks propagate along the field lines from the x point , along either side of the flux rope , and finally collide with each other above the flux rope .",
    "therefore , the plasma and current densities are weakly enhanced just above the flux rope ( figure [ slow ] ) . after the interference",
    ", the shock waves also continue to propagate along the field lines .",
    "the flux rope continues to expand as it rises ( see fig .",
    "[ slow2 ] and fig .",
    "[ div]a ) , and the inner boundary of the expansion corresponds to the slow shocks ( figure [ slow2 ] ) . if the simulation is performed for longer time , the slow shocks will continue to propagate , producing second interference point below the flux rope .",
    "these processes will produce shell - like structures of around the flux rope ( fig .",
    "[ three]a ) .",
    "many cmes show their complicated structure in soho / lasco observation ( cremades & bothmer 2004 , fig .",
    "[ three]b ) .",
    "this process may explain such complicated structures of cmes .",
    "recent observations reveal that solar flares often occur associated with the decrease of soft x - ray and euv intensity , that is so - called _ dimming _ ( sterling & hudson 1997 ; zarro et al .",
    "hudson ( 1996 ) showed that , also in the giant arcade on 1992 january 24 , dimming occurred in the regions above the cusp - shaped arcades ( shown in fig .",
    "[ obs2 ] ) .",
    "soho observations indicated that the dimming is caused by the decrease in the plasma density not by the decrease in temperature ( harrison & lyons 2000 ) .",
    "furthermore , harra & sterling ( 2001 ) showed blue - shifted motion coincided with coronal dimming in the cds observations , and therefore , suggested the lost mass is supplied to the cme , while the mechanism has not been confirmed . especially , the strong dimming is often observed in both sides of flare / giant arcades ( sterling & hudson 1997 ; hudson 1996 ) , hereafter we call such strong dimming as twin dimming    we can see that the density around the flux rope and the cusp - shaped loop decreases in the simulation .",
    "the decrease in density is observed as soft x - ray dimming ( fig .",
    "[ caseb ] ) .",
    "the dimming can be seen in both side of the x - ray arcade in the simulation , and these positions are consistent with those of twin dimming in observations .",
    "therefore , soft x - ray twin dimming may correspond to the rarefaction in the simulation . as discussed in section 3.3 , the rarefaction caused by reconnection inflow and the expansion of the flux rope .",
    "however , the expansion occurred mainly above the flux rope .",
    "therefore the rarefaction in both side of the loop ( i.e. twin dimming ) are mainly caused by reconnection inflow .      from the point of view of cme structure ,",
    "the numerical results provide some new interpretations .",
    "figure [ mod ] shows global structure seen in the results , which is very consistent with the `` three part structure '' observed in many cmes . according to the numerical results ,",
    "the core consists of the flux rope and slow shocks , the cavity corresponds the ` dimming ' region around the flux rope which connected to the twin dimming regions , and the front loop corresponds to the region compressed by the forward fast shock ( fig .",
    "[ mod ] ) . in this results ,",
    "the loop in front of the cme is very weak and not a shock , because density is not stratified owing to the absence of the gravity . in another case of our numerical result including gravity ( see shiota et al . 2004 )",
    ", the wave grows to a shock easily .",
    "lin et al . (",
    "2004 ) modeled a cme with semi - analytic reconnection model and explained the `` three part structure '' of cme as a separatrix bubble .",
    "they discussed , in the paper , that the leading edge of three - part structure corresponds to the separatrix connected to the reconnection region . as they mentioned in the paper ,",
    "their model is not realistic therefore more detailed computation is required .",
    "our results can be applied the requirements , and suggest new interpretations ( fig . [ three ] and [ mod ] ) successfully .      in some large arcade flares ( and some giant arcades )",
    ", we can see often backbone - like features , which may be a series of brighter features on the top of each loop in the arcade in soft x - ray images ( sakurai et al .",
    "1992 ) while loop top bright features at the loop top are also observed in some compact flares , which are called as ` feldman blob ' ( see acton et al .",
    "in the event on 1992 january 24 , the top of the cusp - shaped loop is brighter than other region of the loop ( figure [ obs]d , e , and f ) .",
    "on the other hand , calculated x - ray images show brighter feature on the top of the cusp - shaped loops .",
    "the brighter feature is formed by the compression in the fast shock formed by the collision of the downward reconnection outflow .    in order to compare the numerical result with sxt observations more directly , we calculated 3-dimensional views of the numerical results , assuming that the numerical results distributed uniformly to the perpendicular direction .",
    "we apply the same way to calculate a 3-dimensional views as used in forbes & acton ( 1996 ) .",
    "the calculated images are shown in figure [ 3da ] .",
    "however , the effect of gravity ( density stratification ) is not included in our numerical simulations . if the effect of gravity is included , the density in upper corona becomes much smaller than thiese results .",
    "the soft x - ray intensity is proportional to @xmath98 , the brightness of the feature in upper corona becomes much smaller .",
    "in fact , the center of the y - shape is located at twice of the scale height , the intensity of the y - shape is negligible . therefore , we synthesized 3-dimensional soft x - ray images , in which the y - shape is removed ( the lower right two panels of fig .",

    "the position of the dimming regions are consistent with that of the rarefaction in the numerical results .",
    "since the rarefaction occurs in the region outside the slow shocks , the inner boundary between the `` dimming '' and `` non - dimming '' regions may be slow shocks associated with the reconnection .",

    "the top of cusp - shaped loops in an arcade is brighter than other regions , which looks like a backbone of the arcade .",
    "such a feature is reproduced in the numerical simulation , which indicates that the backbone feature corresponds to the fast shock created by the collision between the reconnection outflow and the arcade .",

    "the numerical results indicate that complex structures around a cme core may be formed by these slow shocks .",
