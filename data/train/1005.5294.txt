    "malin1 is one of the most unusual galaxies known to date .",
    "the galaxy was accidentally discovered in the course of a systematic survey of the virgo cluster region designed to detect extremely low - surface brightness ( lsb ) galaxies ( bothun et al .",
    "according to observational characteristics , malin1 remains unique among other known galaxies .",
    "radial extent of its stellar disc in the @xmath2 passband reaches out @xmath360@xmath4 or @xmath390 kpc ( adopting distance @xmath5=366 mpc and scale 1.51 kpc/1@xmath4 from the nasa / ipac extragalactic database ( ned ) ) and the disc scale length is about 45@xmath4 or 68 kpc ( bothun et al .",
    "deep @xmath6-band data show even larger radial size of the disc  about @xmath7 or 120 kpc  and somewhat smaller scale length value ",
    "33@xmath4 or 50 kpc ( moore & parker 2006 ) .",
    "therefore , malin1 possesses the largest stellar disc of any known spiral galaxy .",
    "the disc is of extremly low surface brightness  extrapolated central surface brightness is @xmath8/@xmath9 ( bothun et al .",
    "1987 ) , @xmath10/@xmath9 ( moore & parker 2006 ) .",
    "malin1 has a very low brightness , but due to its enormous size the galaxy s total optical luminosity is high : @xmath11 ( pickering et al .",
    "1997 ) . based on these characteristics ,",
    "malin1 is often considered as a prototypical giant low surface brightness ( lsb ) galaxy .",
    "malin1 is among the most gas - rich galaxies known to date : m(hi)@xmath12m@xmath13 ( pickering et al .",
    "1997 ) or @xmath14m@xmath13 ( matthews , van driel & monnier - ragaigne 2001 ) .",
    "the hi disc of the galaxy demonstrates strong non - circular motions and is strongly warped ( pickering et al .",
    "1997 ; lelli , fraternali & sancisi 2010 ) .",
    "recent analysis of a hubble space telescope @xmath15-band image suggests that malin1 has a normal barred inner spiral disc embedded in a huge diffuse lsb envelope ( barth 2007 ) .",
    "based on previously published photometric characteristics and hi kinematics , seigar ( 2008 ) derived a possible mass profile for malin1 .",
    "he concluded that the galaxy is baryon dominated in the centre ( out to @xmath1610 kpc ) and , probably , has parameters typical of normal galaxies ( of course , excluding giant low - surface brightness envelope ) .",
    "recently lelli et al .",
    "( 2010 ) ( see also sancisi & fraternali 2007 ) presented the similar results using their re - analysis existing hi data . the models by seigar ( 2008 ) and lelli et al .",
    "( 2010 ) are based on published hi observation by pickering et al .",
    "but these hi data are strongly affected by beam smearing and , as a result , no reliable kinematics inside central 15 kpc are currently available .    in order to investigate stellar kinematics of malin1",
    ", we have performed spectroscopic study of the galaxy with the russian 6-m telescope .",
    "detailed discussion and results of modeling will be published later . in this letter , we present the most surprising result of our observations  the discovery of the galaxy ( malin1b ) that probably interacts with malin1 .",
    "the spectroscopic data were obtained with the 6-m telescope of the special astrophysical observatory of russian academy of sciences ( sao ras ) on march 30/31 2009 .",
    "we observed malin1 with the multi - mode focal reducer scorpio ( afanasiev & moiseev 2005 ) in the long - slit mode with the spectral resolution about @xmath17 in the wavelength range 5500 - 6550 that corresponds to 5080 - 6050 in the galaxy rest frame .",
    "the studied spectral range contains numerous absorption features ( mgi , fe , etc . ) produced by old stellar population .",
    "the possible contribution of weak emission lines was insignificant .",
    "the slit , which length is about 6 arcmin , has been placed on the galaxy nucleus at p.a.=55@xmath18 ( see fig .  1 ) .",
    "the slit width was @xmath19 with the spatial sampling @xmath20 .",
    "we took in total 7200 sec exposure under atmospheric seeing @xmath21 .    for data reduction and analysis we used programmes and algorithms briefly described in zasov et al .",
    "the line - of - sight velocity and stellar velocity dispersion profiles for the stellar components have been estimated by cross - correlating galactic spectra binned along the slit with a template star hd  10380 ( k3  iii ) spectra from the library miles ( sanchez - blazquez et al .",
    "we applied 2 - 3 pixels binning along the slit to provide a sufficient signal - to - noise ratio , the resulting sampling was 070 for the inner part of the galaxy and 105 for several external points .",
    "the results are presented in fig .  2 .",
    "at @xmath22 the slit crosses the nucleus of small companion galaxy ( malin1b ) .",
    "2 shows that this region is kinematically decoupled from the malin1 s rotation curve : it has an invert radial velocity gradient and a distinct peak at the velocity dispersion profile .",
    "from our spectrum we determined the following parameters of the main galaxy ( malin1 ) : the heliocentric systemic velocity v@xmath23=24775@xmath110 km / s and the central velocity dispersion @xmath24=192@xmath113 km / s .",
    "both values are in good agreement with previously published results ( table  1 ) .    the companion galaxy",
    " malin1b  has coordinates @xmath25(2000)=12@xmath2636@xmath2758.@xmath2889 and @xmath29(2000)=+14@xmath1819439 and is located about 9@xmath4 sw from the main galaxy nucleus ( fig .  1 ) .",
    "the systemic radial velocity of the companion is v@xmath30=24840@xmath112 km / s , the velocity difference with malin1 is 65@xmath116 km / s , the projected distance is 14 kpc .",
    "outer elliptical isophotes of malin1b are disturbed and elongated to the north - north - east ( fig .  3 ) .",
    "the mean axial ratio the isophotes is @xmath31 , the position angle of the major axis is p.a.=79@xmath18 @xmath1 3@xmath18 , and the major axis is about 3@xmath4 or 4.5 kpc .",
    "the surface brightness distribution of malin1b looks usual for early - type spiral galaxies ( fig .",
    "3 ) . in the framework of two - component model",
    "the bulge - to - disk ratio is @xmath32 .",
    "this value is typical for the s0-sa galaxies ( e.g. simien & de vaucouleurs 1986 ) .",
    "the observed luminosity of malin1b measured within @xmath33 is about 1/10 of the malin1 luminosity within the same isophote .",
    "the total luminosity of the companion @xmath34 or @xmath35 ( assuming @xmath36 for an s0 galaxy ) .",
    "the observed central velocity dispersion of malin1b is @xmath24=97@xmath120 km / s and the galaxy parameters satisfy the faber ",
    "jackson relation .",

    "4 shows the large - scale spatial environment of malin1 .",
    "as one can see , the galaxy is located in a relatively low - density region , near the end of an elongated structure , that is probably a filament of the large scale structure ( lss ) . therefore , malin1 is within the environment typical for lsb galaxies .",
    "for example , rosenbaum & bomans ( 2004 ) and rosenbaum et al .",
    "( 2009 ) concluded that the lsb galaxies appear to favour the edges of filaments .",
    "this conclusion supports the idea that lsb galaxies were formed in the voids of the lss without many galaxy interactions . only in this case",
    "the low - density primordial fluctuations could survive .",
    "then the galaxy would have migrated to the edges of the filaments due to gravitational infall .",
    "there is another point of view about the origins of lsb galaxies .",
    "some authors suggested a possible link between giant low - surface brightness galaxies and ring galaxies formed as a result of a head - on collision with a massive flyby intruder ( e.g. , mapelli et al .",
    "2008 ) . smoothed shell - like structures at large radii can be also produced by mergers between a disc - like galaxy and elliptical one ( pierani et al .",
    "2010 ) .",
    "the collisional scenario is very attractive because malin1 has a normal inner stellar disc and a normal bulge ( barth 2007 ) .",
    "moreover , its extended stellar and gaseous discs can be considered as collisional rings at the late stage of their evolution .",
    "mapelli et al .",
    "( 2008 ) presented a model that matches in general the global photometry of malin1 .",
    "unfortunately , such a model needs the intruder with mass that is comparable with the total mass of the main galaxy or only a few times less .",
    "malin1b looks too small and unsufficiently massive to produce an extended ring - like structure .",
    "it could have been more massive originally but has been tidally stripped during the interaction with malin1 .",
    "but to our mind , its position and relative velocity favour a close orbit rather than a flyby at escape speed that is commonly preassumed when one considers a collisional origin of ring - like galaxies ( lynds & toomre 1976 ; hernquist & weil 1993 ; horellou & combes 2001 ) .",
    "nevertheless malin1b could cause the appearance of a single dusty spiral arm in malin1 that has been recently revealed ( moore & parker 2006 ) .",
    "this type of structure is often considered as the result of an interaction with a satellite on a retrogade orbit ( athanassoula 1978 ) .",
    "malin1b could also produce two - armed structure and trigger a bar instability in the inner disc of malin1 .",
    "the inner spiral structure is definitely seen in the hubble space telescope @xmath15-band image ( figs .",
    "1,2 of barth 2007 ) and the bar can be clearly recognized by analysing the surface brightness distribution of malin1 ( fig .  3 of barth 2007 ) .",
    "but we definitely need a more massive companion to support the scenario by mapelli et al .",
    "( 2008 )    the nearest bright galaxy with known redshift is sdssj123708.91 + 142253.2 with @xmath41 ( table  1 ) .",
    "the galaxy is located at the projected distance of 3.9 arcmin or 350 kpc far from malin1 and has an apparent magnitude @xmath42 .",
    "the velocity difference between this galaxy and malin1 is rather small  132@xmath129 km / s .",
    "we can use parameters of the collisional model presented by mapelli et al .",
    "( 2008 ) to check the galaxy sdssj123708.91 + 142253.2 as a candidate for being a possible intruder .",
    "the ratio of the malin1 and `` intruder '' optical luminosities ( that is about @xmath43 in the @xmath44-band ) is in agreement with the value of the mass ratio of target and intruder galaxies in the model under discussion .    the collisional model ( mapelli et al .",
    "2008 ) suggests an impact at an inclination angle of @xmath45 with respect to the angular momentum axis of the target ( malin1 in our case ) . according to moore & parker ( 2006 )",
    "the inclination angle of a stellar disc of malin1 is @xmath46 .",
    "then the direction of intruder motion would have an inclination angle to the line of sight between @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "let us choose the largest value of the angle for further estimates .",
    "the initial position and the velocity ( with respect to the centre - of - mass of the progenitor of the ring galaxy ) for the intruder adopted by mapelli et al .",
    "( 2008 ) are @xmath49 kpc , @xmath50 km / s .",
    "it implies that the intruder radial velocity would be of @xmath51  km / s at the projected distance @xmath52 kpc .",
    "both estimates mean that it takes the intruder about 1  gyr ( @xmath53 ) to get there , providing a very small impact parameter and a flyby as suggested by mapelli et al .",
    "( 2008 ) .",
    "our simple velocity estimate for the intruder is in agreement with the data presented here .",
    "moreover , current location of the galaxy sdssj123708.91 + 142253.2 maintains the idea for the closest passage to happen 1  gyr ago that is also in accordance with the model by mapelli et al .",
    "( 2008 ) . but",
    "this otherwise attractive scenario has one serious drawback .    the model by mapelli et al .",
    "( 2008 ) predicts the existence of strong non - circular motions that could be associated with the expansion velocity of the old ring and/or with the fallback of a part of the ejected matter towards the centre .",
    "the strength of non - circular motions can be quantified by the ratio of radial and tangential velocities of gas .",
    "simulations show that there is a region in the outer part of the galaxy ( @xmath167080 kpc far from the center ) where radial velocities are comparable with tangential ones ( fig .  12 of mapelli et al . 2008 ) .",
    "however , the analysis of hi data ( to be discussed in a forthcoming paper ) shows that possible radial motions are smaller ( see also lelli et al .",
    "namely , the radial component of non - circular gas motions in the galaxy outskirts have a maximal values about @xmath54 of rotation velocities .",
    "moreover , the azimuthal distribution of non - circular motions is more complex than simple inflow / expansion pattern predicted by numerical simulations .    in any case",
    ", the structure of malin1 seems more complex than predicted from mapelli et al .",
    "( 2008 ) model because the real situation should include two events : a possible strong head - on collision with a massive companion ( sdssj123708.91 + 142253.2 ) and a current interaction with smaller malin1b galaxy .",
    "thus , we do not reject the collisional model of malin1 but it definitely needs to be refined , as far as , new observational data are urgently needed .",
    "in this letter we present the results of spectroscopic observations of the galaxy malin1 and its newly discovered companion malin1b .",
    "our main conclusions are    1 .",
    "malin1 is currently undergoing a minor merger with a relatively small companion galaxy .",
    "this galaxy is at the projected distance of 14 kpc and shows a small velocity difference with malin1 systemic velocity ( @xmath55v=65 km / s ) .",
    "2 .   accreting companion might be responsible for the main morphological features in the central part of malin1 .",
    "it could produce a two - armed inner structure and trigger the bar instability ( fig .  1 ) .",
    "also , one can relate this companion with one - armed spiral pattern in malin1 disc ( see fig .  4 in moore & parker 2006 ) .",
    "malin1 is in a relatively low - density large scale spatial environment that is typical for lsb galaxies .",
    "we discuss the possible origins of malin1 global structure due to a bygone head - on collision with a massive intruder ( mechanism proposed by mapelli et al .",
    "available data do not contradict this scenario ( for instance , we even identified possible intruder galaxy sdssj123708.91 + 142253.2 ) but more detailed simulations and new observational data are needed for definite conclusions .",
    "the research is partly based on observations made with the nasa / esa hubble space telescope , and obtained from the hubble legacy archive , which is a collaboration between the space telescope science institute ( stsci / nasa ) , the space telescope european coordinating facility ( st - ecf / esa ) and the canadian astronomy data centre ( cadc / nrc / csa ) .",
