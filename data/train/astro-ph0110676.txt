    "the analysis of the comoving star - formation rate  ( sfr ) density as a function of redshift has been the subject of much recent work .",
    "the onset of large redshift surveys at @xmath3 ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) and @xmath13 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) has allowed the volumetric emission of luminosity in different bands to be traced with redshift .",
    "in particular from these studies there is now good evidence for a rise in star - formation rate  by a factor of about 8 between @xmath14 and @xmath0 @xcite and either a @xmath4 decline @xcite or plateau @xcite .",
    "most measurements of the sfr to date have been based on some type of _ luminosity density _ which is thought on theoretical and/or empirical grounds to trace the star - formation rate .",
    "this use of luminosity per unit volume reflects an attempt to decouple the stellar history of the universe from its dynamical history .",
    "other statistical measures such as object counts versus luminosity or redshift are affected by the changes in the number of galactic objects by merging as well as evolution of stellar populations .",
    "in contrast , the change in the light budget per unit volume is only affected by the stellar production in that volume regardless of the changes in the number of objects .",
    "thus , for example , it makes sense to compare the total production of stars with the total metal abundance today @xcite .",
    "popular tracers of star - formation rate  include : the uv 15003000  continuum ( @xcite ; @xcite ) ; the radio continuum @xcite ; emission in the h@xmath15 and h@xmath16 lines @xcite , and ; other line emission such as ly@xmath15 @xcite or oii @xcite . the far - ir thermal dust emission has also been used to trace star - formation rate   @xcite although so far without the benefit of redshift information .",
    "all these measures have in common the use of some kind of luminosity per unit volume whose change is proportional to the star - formation rate   ( with corrections ) .",
    "the debate over the @xmath4 slope reflects the uncertainty in the dust correction to the uv continuum measurements , which are the easiest to measure at high redshift but most affected by dust .",
    "the other indicators are harder to measure and are affected by small number statistics .    in this paper , we present new constraints on the history of star formation based on the ensemble stellar populations of relatively nearby present day galaxies ( @xmath17 ) .",
    "the concept is to use the average spectrum of nearby galaxies to constrain the earlier history of star formation leading up to that stellar population .",
    "the average spectrum contains absorption features for stars of all ages and probes look - back times of 0.210 gyr . with the advent of the large galaxy redshift surveys , such as the two - degree field galaxy redshift survey ( 2dfgrs ) and the sloan digital sky survey main galaxy sample ( sdss - mgs ) ,",
    "it has become feasible to combine the spectra of @xmath18@xmath19 galaxies to form very high signal - to - noise intermediate resolution spectra that represent the average emission of the universe at various redshifts ( @xmath20 ) .",
    "effectively , the surveys can be regarded as having a series of apertures on the cosmic background emission rather than apertures on individual galaxies .",
    "what is novel about this method is that it is not based on any luminosity output with time of the universe , unlike all the other indicators discussed above .",
    "the method uses an integral over the star - formation historyrather than attempting to track the derivative ( the sfr ) and uses the whole visible spectrum at intermediate resolution . perhaps the nearest approach to this in the past has been the work of @xcite who used the color distribution of @xmath21 galaxies to derive their star - formation histories which were then combined to form a cosmic star - formation history .",
    "recently , @xcite estimated the global sfr density from star - formation history  measurements of the local group .",
    "the problem here is that the local group sfr may not represent the cosmic mean and is subject to large cosmic variations such as recent `` mini - bursts '' of star formation in the milky way .",
    "an advantage of this kind of ` fossil cosmology ' approach over the direct measurement is a reduced sensitivity to extinction .",
    "young stars are born in dusty regions , this plagues the direct measurement approach . when they age they migrate out of such regions and contribute to the older stellar populations we observe .    in this paper",
    ", we describe the application of this method to 166000 spectra in the redshift range 0.030.25 from the 2dfgrs  @xcite .",
    "the plan of this paper is as follows . in section",
    "[ sec : data ] we describe the 2dfgrs  data and our methods for combining the spectra . in section  [ sec : scenarios ] we describe our analytic models for cosmic star - formation scenarios . in section  [ sec : results ] we describe our fitting procedure and the best - fit models . in section  [ sec : biases ] we discuss the impact of possible biases on our results from aperture effects and luminosity selection .",
    "finally in section  [ sec : conc ] we give our conclusions .",
    "the 2df galaxy redshift survey is a magnitude - limited spectroscopic survey @xcite using the anglo - australian observatory s 2df facility which is capable of observing up to 400 galaxies simultaneously @xcite .",
    "the magnitude limit of the survey is an extinction - corrected @xmath22  of 19.45 selected from the automated plate measuring ( apm ) galaxy catalogue ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . by the end of the 2dfgrs   survey ( 2002 january ) ,",
    "up to 250000 unique galaxy redshifts are expected to have been measured .",
    "the survey covers approximately 2000 deg@xmath23 of sky distributed between the ngp and sgp in high - galactic latitude fields .",
    "a full description of the survey geometry is given by @xcite .    in 2001 june ,",
    "about 173000 unique galaxy redshifts had been measured .",
    "this is the sample used in the analysis presented in this paper .",
    "the spectra are observed through a fixed @xmath24-fiber aperture and the wavelength coverage varies only slightly from observing run to run , consistently covering the range 37007860   with a 2.1-pixel resolution fwhm of 9.0 .",
    "all the spectra in the survey have been eyeballed and assigned a quality @xmath25 from 1 to 5 @xcite : 1 , no identifiable redshift ; 2 , a possible redshift ; 3 , a 90% reliable redshift ; 4 , a 99% reliable redshift ; 5 , a 99% reliable redshift with a high - quality spectrum .",
    "the survey is considered to consist of those galaxy spectra with @xmath26 ( approximately 92% of galaxies observed ) .",
    "these galaxies have a median redshift of about 0.11 and the typical spectral signal - to - noise ratio at the survey limit is about 10 per pixel .",
    "we construct our ` cosmic spectra ' in redshift slices @xmath27 by applying an instrument response correction , de - redshifting to the rest frame and summing up all the @xmath26 spectra in the interval @xmath28 .",
    "the galaxies are scaled to match their measured @xmath22  luminosity by comparison with an integration of the @xmath22  filter curve over the measured spectrum ( in the observed frame ) .",
    "the scaling allows for the fact that the fibres sample only a fraction of a galaxy s light and for extinction and exposure - time variations between observations . a maximum scaling",
    "is allowed ( as a function of apparent magnitude ) to avoid adding excessive noise from poor - quality spectra .",
    "this scaling limit is only applied to 5% of the data .",
    "finally the cosmic spectrum is normalized to a mean of unity over a set wavelength range  to re - iterate , our method of analysis uses spectral features not absolute luminosities other than for the weighting of the galaxy spectra .",
    "this spectrum represents the spectral emission per unit volume in the @xmath29 interval down to the limiting magnitude of the survey . as a result of the @xmath22@xmath30 limit of the 2dfgrs , the",
    "corresponding limiting absolute luminosity will be higher at higher redshifts .",
    "this exclusion of lower luminosity galaxies is a possible source of bias .",
    "this is quantified in section  [ sec : biases ] .",
    "the instrument response correction consists of applying the average 2df spectral response as given by @xcite .",
    "only a simple scaling is applied for light lost outside the fixed angular size fiber aperture which again is another potential source of bias to be discussed in section  [ sec : biases ] .",
    "examples of cosmic spectra , at a series of redshifts , are shown in figure  [ fig : averaged - spectra ] .",
    "as might be expected from a broad star - formation history , the average emission from the universe looks remarkably like an sb  sbc galaxy spectrum @xcite .",
    "first we must decide how best to parameterize cosmic star - formation histories .",
    "we use two different families of parameterization .",
    "the first is a physically motivated parameterization , using an infall model to describe star formation as a function of time and timescales .",
    "the second is a purely empirical model , which describes star formation as a series of power laws with redshift .",
    "this facilitates direct comparisons with the literature .",
    "for the cosmology we consider two types , both constrained to be flat in accord with the cosmic microwave background data @xcite :    1 .   the emerging standard cosmology ( which we denote @xmath311 ) , which has cosmological parameters",
    "@xmath32 @xmath33  @xmath34 ( 0.70,0.3,0.7 ) ] .",
    "these parameters are the current best constraints from a variety of observations @xcite .",
    "2 .   a longer - age cosmology ( which we denote @xmath312 ) with @xmath32 ( 0.55,0.2,0.8 ) .",
    "these parameters have been adjusted on the longer age side to the margins of consistency with modern limits .    for galaxies at @xmath35 with @xmath36 ,",
    "these cosmologies give ages of 11.0 and 15.7gyr , respectively .    given a star - formation history  and a cosmology we can compute spectra using standard evolutionary synthesis codes .",
    "we used the pegase code @xcite .",
    "both parameterizations require an initial - mass function ( imf ) and we choose the @xcite power law slope with stellar mass in the range 0.1120m@xmath37 .",
    "we have also investigated the @xcite imf over the same mass range .",
    "we also have choices to make on metallicity evolution and dust extinction . for the former",
    ", the enrichment of the inter - stellar medium is determined using the calculations of @xcite within the pegase code . for the dust extinction ,",
    "the prescription for an inclination - averaged disk geometry is used .",
    "however , the choice of extinction , e@xmath38 , makes negligible difference to the results in this paper for two reasons : ( a ) we are only determining the relative sfr as a function of time or redshift , i.e. , not comparing predicted luminosity with luminosity density , and ; ( b ) the robust results are primarily constrained using high - pass filtered spectra which are insensitive to the extinction model .",
    "we note that there will be a second - order effect from any systematic variation of extinction with spectral type and/or luminosity .",
    "the first parameterization is a natural scenario .",
    "star formation starts at @xmath39 .",
    "gas falls into sufficiently dense regions to form stars with an infall timescale @xmath40 : @xmath41 the gas in these regions forms stars at a rate ( @xmath42 ) proportional to the amount of gas available with a star - formation timescale @xmath43 : @xmath44 this parameterization is readily implemented in the pegase population synthesis code @xcite .",
    "the code includes recycling of ejecta into the inter - stellar medium ( ism ) and consistent evolution of the metallicity . an analytical approximation to the star - formation rate",
    "can be determined assuming an instantaneous - recycling approximation ( @xmath45 is the mass fraction of stars that are _ not _ returned to the ism ) .",
    "using this prescription the star - formation rate  evolves as @xmath46 for @xmath47 , the solution for the star - formation rate  with time is given by @xmath48 with initial condition @xmath49 at @xmath50 .",
    "the normalization is such that the total mass of gas available is unity .",
    "this parameterization is useful in that it is physically motivated and that it allows for a rise at early times and a fall at late times of the universal star - formation rate .",
    "the deviation between the approximation and the code becomes apparent when recycling from lower mass stars becomes significant .",
    "an example is shown in figure  [ fig : example - scenario ] with @xmath51 and 0.8 for the recycling approximation .",
    "= 9.2 cm      in the second parameterization we empirically make the star - formation rate  a function of redshift . in particular , we make the star - formation rate  between @xmath52 ( our choice of formation redshift ) and @xmath0 proportional to @xmath53 and between @xmath0 and @xmath14 proportional to @xmath54 , with matched sfr at @xmath0 .",
    "this form allows us to make a comparison of the best - fitting parameters with previous studies which measure star - formation rate  with redshift via luminosity densities .",
    "in particular we can compare the value of @xmath16 defined and measured by @xcite as well as other measurements of the variation of the comoving sfr density with redshift ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the total amount of star formation ( @xmath55 ) between @xmath52 and @xmath14 as a fraction of the mass available was normalized to a range of values from @xmath56 to @xmath57 ( the sfr normalization ) .",
    "in other words , the mass of gas available for star formation is unity and the @xmath55 is the total mass of stars formed since @xmath58 .",
    "this can be greater than unity because of recycling of material back into the inter - stellar medium .",
    "higher @xmath55 values result in higher average metallicity because the fusion products released into the ism by supernovae are more abundant relative to the remaining gas .",
    "the 2dfgrs  data were divided into 14 redshift bins between @xmath59 and @xmath60 , each containing about 12000 spectra .",
    "half the redshift bins were below @xmath61 ( the median redshift of the survey ) .",
    "the lower and higher groups of 7 redshift bins were considered separately and together to test the robustness to varying aperture and selection effects ( see section  [ sec : biases ] for a further discussion of this ) .    for each redshift bin ,",
    "the spectra were divided into ten positional bins based on their coordinates ( 4 regions in the ngp and 6 in the sgp ) . a normalized average spectrum was calculated and the positional bins were used to estimate the uncertainties .",
    "this spectrum represents the total optical emission of all galaxies in the volume of the redshift shell down to the 2dfgrs  magnitude limit .",
    "the absolute magnitude limit is fainter than or about @xmath62 out to a redshift of 0.2 ( the depth is discussed further in section  [ sec : biases ] ) .    to flux - calibrate the spectra they were divided by the 2df response function of @xcite before coadding the fluxes at their rest wavelengths .",
    "spectra contribute to the final spectrum in proportion to their @xmath22  luminosity .",
    "in addition , the averaged spectra were smoothed and resampled to match approximately the much lower 20   resolution of the spectral library @xcite used by the population - synthesis code .",
    "to evaluate the ` goodness of fit ' between a star - formation scenario and the 2dfgrs  data , we compare the spectrum from each redshift bin with the appropriate model spectrum ( at the same age ) from the scenario .",
    "fiber spectra are known to be difficult to flux accurately so it is desirable to develop methods which are insensitive to small spectrophotometric uncertainties .",
    "the first method we used was to allow for the possibility of spectrophotometric calibration errors by including a correction function before evaluating the fit .",
    "this was to account for spectrophotometric discrepancies between the 2df response curve used to calculate the average spectra and the true average 2dfgrs  response .",
    "we used a fourth order polynomial with _ observed _",
    "wavelength for this spectrophotometric correction , the coefficients being determined by ratioing the model and data spectra ( excluding the strongest emission lines as per the fitting ) .",
    "an important point is that the correction is constrained to be the same function at all redshifts , thus the degeneracy between the spectrophotometric correction and the model fitting is partially broken because of the range of redshift covered ( 0.030.25 ) .",
    "typically in our fitting we find this spectrophotometric correction to be of the order 510% change in the response function of @xcite  for the best - fitting models ( within 3@xmath63 ) .",
    "these values represent the rms relative difference over the wavelength range between the polynomial correction and a constant value ( representing changes in the relative , not absolute , spectrophotometry ) .",
    "since the response function was measured from standard stars observed during a single hour , such a difference could arise from : ( i ) unaccounted for , reduction or throughput discrepancies between extended and point sources , and/or ; ( ii ) variations in the instrument response over the 2dfgrs  survey time .",
    "= 9.2 cm = 9.2 cm    in evaluating the fit between a model spectrum and a 2dfgrs  data spectrum , we compare the low - pass and high - pass information separately to form two figures of merit ( foms ) from the normalized spectra .",
    "this is illustrated in figure  [ fig : example - fitting ] .",
    "the normalization is to set a mean of unity over the rest - wavelength range 41006200 , with the lower limit being just above the 4000   break and the upper limit being just in the detected range for galaxies with @xmath60 .",
    "both the normalized model spectrum and normalized data spectrum are smoothed using a top - hat function of width 200  ( 10 sampling points ) .",
    "the original spectra are divided by the smoothed spectra to produce the high - pass spectra . fom",
    "a is the reduced @xmath64  value from the difference between the low - pass spectra and fom  b is is the reduced @xmath64  value from the high - pass spectra .",
    "this high - pass fom  b is thus robust against any large - scale errors in the spectrophotometry and in fact we find fom  b is negligibly different whether we include a spectrophotometric correction or not . fom  b places more reliable constraints on the best - fit star - formation scenarios",
    "since it is less affected by the systematic uncertainties of spectrophotometry and extinction . fom  a",
    "is an independent check : our aim is to get consistent histories from both the low - pass ( continuum ) and high - pass ( absorption line ) information . from the best - fit star formation",
    "we can obtain a range of probable spectrophotometric corrections that were used to determine the mean and uncertainty in the @xmath22  k - corrections of the galaxy spectra @xcite .    in order to determine the uncertainties in our set of spectra we take the empirical approach of dividing up the survey into ten separate , approximately - equal sky areas .",
    "we compute the mean spectrum separately for each area and use the variance between them to set out errors as a function of wavelength .",
    "the rms errors computed this way are around 0.21% for the high - pass spectrum and 13% for the low - pass spectrum .",
    "an additional uncertainty of 1.5% per wavelength bin is added in quadrature to account for intrinsic model inaccuracies due to , for example , the signal - to - noise ratio of the spectra in the input atlas .",
    "this uncertainty value was chosen so that the reduced @xmath64  values for the best - fit star - formation scenarios were approximately unity .",
    "for a given star - formation scenario , we average the fom values over all the redshift bins .",
    "we calculate the figure - of - merit quantities by summing over all wavelengths except near strong nebular emission lines ( oii 3727 ; oiii 5007 ; h@xmath15 6563 ; nii 6583 ; sii 6716 & 6730 ) .",
    "we do this because our goal is to calculate the star - formation history  from the stellar emission only .",
    "the nebular - line emission is a measure of the instantaneous star - formation rate  in hii regions , but the pegase code uses over - simple assumptions to translate star - formation rate  to a set of line ratios . since understanding ionization levels and interpreting line ratios are complex subjects , and",
    "since the current strength of emission lines does not constrain past star formation rates , we choose not to use this information .",
    "in addition the emission lines will be contaminated by active galactic nuclei in a few percent of our galaxies , so ignoring the lines will minimize the bias this causes .",
    "= 9.2 cm = 9.2 cm    for the fitting procedure we calculate a grid of model values , @xmath65 for the physical parameterization and @xmath66 for the empirical parameterization .",
    "we estimate that after our data processing there are approximately 20 degrees of freedom for fom  a ( about 22 independent wavelength points ) and 200 degrees of freedom for fom  b. the minimum @xmath67 value was about unity for both figures of merit using the uncertainties described above .",
    "we believe the additional uncertainty of 1.5% necessary to obtain a suitable @xmath64  value reflects the remaining imprecision of the model spectra , as these types of models were conceived originally to model galaxy colors . improved , higher - resolution models will be required in future work .",
    "we proceed to interpret the star - formation laws of the best - fitting models .",
    "we note that the best fit matches the data to about 2% rms , so in absolute terms we are accounting for the volumetric light emission very well .",
    "the problem remains that the high - pass data are much better than the current state of the art in population synthesis modeling .    in order to estimate the confidence limits on the foms ( @xmath68 ) , we investigated the variation of the best - fit parameters using monte carlo simulations .",
    "it is not sufficient to apply the standard confidence limits because of correlated uncertainties between different wavelength points .",
    "the investigation included using the spectra from the ten positional bins separately , applying random errors of 1.5% , using different redshift ranges ( e.g. , 0.030.11 , 0.110.25 ) and varying the dust extinction in the models .",
    "as expected , fom  b is fairly robust and we use @xmath69 for the 3@xmath63 ( 99.73% ) confidence limit . fom",
    "a is strongly affected by using different positions on the sky and different redshift ranges .",
    "this is principally due to spectrophotometric uncertainties , and we use @xmath70 for the 3@xmath63 limit ( when plotting contours using the full redshift range ) . in neither case is the fom significantly affected by changes in the dust extinction used in the model .",
    "this is not surprising for fom  b since it is determined from high - pass spectra .",
    "a spectrophotometric adjustment is applied to the data before determining the foms and therefore fom  a is principally sensitive to variations over ranges of 200  ( the smoothing length ) , such as the 4000  break , and is less sensitive to extinction .",

    "this is 2.7@xmath104kpc which is comparable to a typical large disk scale length of 3@xmath104kpc @xcite . in practice ,",
    "the effective aperture is more like 3.4@xmath104kpc ( @xmath105 ) as the median observation seeing was about @xmath106 .",
    "thus it is reasonable that the effect of aperture bias will be much smaller for @xmath107 as we are sampling more than half the total light of galaxies .",
    "the data allow for a further test of this because of its own internal seeing variations .",
    "spectra taken in bad atmospheric seeing are a rough proxy for spectra taken through a larger aperture , as the object is smeared out over a disk about the size of the seeing disk . as a test of this , we chose a sample of about 1500 galaxies ( @xmath108 ) that had measured spectra taken both in relatively good seeing ( @xmath109 ) and in poor seeing ( @xmath110 ) such that the difference in representative aperture was greater than a linear factor of 1.5 for each galaxy with @xmath26 for both spectra . with this sample , we measured the change in equivalent width ( ew ) of a number of lines between the larger representative aperture and the smaller aperture . in some individual spectra ,",
    "the sky subtraction was inadequate for accurate ew measurement .",
    "therefore , measurements for which the reduced counts were too low or contaminated by sky - emission lines were excluded .",
    "for further robustness , the galaxies were divided into subsamples of ten as a function of redshift and the median change in ew of each group was determined .",
    "the results are shown in figure  [ fig : change - ew - lines ] .",
    "similar results were obtained if a weighted mean ( by counts ) was used rather than a median .",
    "= 9.2 cm    there is _ no evidence _ for any aperture effect in terms of the average change of ew for the galaxies in this sample given a difference in representative aperture with a linear factor in the range 1.52.3 .",
    "we can not rule out a small aperture effect on the measured cosmic spectra particularly for @xmath111 where the test sample is small .",
    "how do the measured cosmic spectra vary as a function of redshift due to selection effects , aperture effects , if any , and evolution ?",
    "figure  [ fig : ew - lines ] plots the equivalent width of o ii , h@xmath112 , ch , oiii , mgi and nai as a function of redshift for a complete sample and for a volume - limited sample .",
    "these measurements were made on luminosity - weighted , averaged spectra determined from redshift bins of mostly 0.005 in extent . to interpret this figure",
    ", we first consider the volume - limited sample ( diamonds ) .    1 .   in the redshift range 0.050.2",
    ", we expect aperture effects to be minimal . therefore , the change in ew in this range could be primarily due to evolution and the changes agree qualitatively with a @xmath113 scenario",
    ". it is not possible to make an accurate comparison due to the lower resolution of the model spectra .",
    "however , qualitatively they agree well : decrease in nebular - line emission between @xmath114 and 0.05 ; increase in ch absorption ew ; less increase in mgi and nai absorption and , not surprisingly , the h@xmath112 absorption decreases due to a lower fractional contribution of a stars .",
    "the solid lines in figure  [ fig : ew - lines ] are fits to these changes : with the @xmath115 for the emission lines , and @xmath116 for the others .",
    "these constitute a detection of cosmic evolution .",
    "however , we can not unambiguously separate cosmic sfr evolution from galaxy - population evolution and so we have not used these measurements to constrain the cosmic sfr in this paper .",
    "2 .   in the redshift range 0.020.05 ,",
    "the change in ew for most of the lines levels off or reverses direction .",
    "as described above , we expect the evolutionary changes to continue from @xmath35 to 0.02 .",
    "our interpretation is is that at low redshift the fiber aperture will only see a small part of the galaxy which for a blue - targeted sample is biased towards more recent star formation ",
    "thus , the nebular - line emission is higher and the ch absorption is lower .",
    "we note that for an individual extended spiral galaxy , a 2df - fibre spectrum could be biased towards more quiescent regions ( e.g. , the bulge ) or more star - forming regions . here",
    ", we are strictly refering to the average effect on the measured cosmic spectrum ( the _ median _ bias may still be towards the bulge ) .",
    "we note also that the nebular - line emission may be more sensitive to aperture and selection effects ( and we ignore them in the fitting ) than features at other wavelengths derived from older stellar populations .",
    "= 15.0 cm    considering the all - selection sample ( crosses ) from figure  [ fig : ew - lines ] , it is clear that luminosity - selection bias is having a more significant effect than aperture bias , i.e. , the difference between not including and including the lower luminosity galaxies in the cosmic spectrum is larger than the difference between using small and large physical apertures on a volume - limited sample given the above interpretation .",
    "this is most evident for the o ii and oiii emission lines showing that the less - luminous galaxies contain a higher fraction of recent star formation .",
    "the 2dfgrs  is a magnitude limited sample so the luminosity cutoff will rise with redshift .",
    "this is illustrated in figure  [ fig : sel - ap ]  at @xmath35",
    "we are probing 1.5 magnitudes fainter than the schechter luminosity function break @xmath62 . for a schechter function with a faint end slope of @xmath1171.19 ( the 2dfgrs  value found by * ? ? ?",
    "* ) this will encompass about 70% of the light at @xmath35 , 95% at @xmath118 but only 20% at @xmath114 .",
    "it should be noted that all magnitude - limited samples are dominated by @xmath119 galaxies .",
    "this is a conspiracy between the volume probed and the shape of the schechter function ( e.g. , see * ? ? ?",
    "* for a discussion of this ) .",
    "other studies of luminosity density evolution via flux - limited samples will also be affected by this dominance of @xmath62 galaxies , so the comparison of our results in section  [ sec : results - sub ] is consistent .",
    "if we consider our divided redshift ranges 0.030.11 and 0.110.25 : for the lower range , the luminosity selections are less significant ( the measured cosmic spectrum samples a significant range of the galaxy luminosity function ) but the aperture effects may be biasing the averaged spectra towards more recent star formation ; for the higher range , the aperture effects are less significant but the selection function is clearly missing a higher fraction of recent star formation from the lower luminosity galaxies .",
    "however , in general , we have found the results to be robust against choice of redshift range chosen : lower , higher or combined . in any case , the contours in figures  [ fig : ti - versus - ts][fig : alpha - versus - r-2 ] take account of the variation in best - fit parameters between the lower and higher redshift ranges .",
    "we have developed a method of determining relative cosmic star - formation history  based only upon the spectral information .",
    "we find consistent results between both low - pass and high - pass spectral information and between physical and empirical parameterizations of the star - formation law .",
    "if we assume the following : ( a ) the averaged 2dfgrs  spectra ( @xmath120 in the range 0.030.25 ) represent the galaxy population as a whole ; ( b ) the stellar populations can be approximated by one chemical evolution scenario , and ; ( c ) the imf , the pegase models and the cosmology are sufficiently accurate ; then we can reach the following conclusions .    1 .",
    "the present day ` cosmic spectrum ' is well determined at @xmath121 and can only be fit with models incorporating consistent chemical evolution .",
    "constant metallicity is strongly ruled out .",
    "the final metallicity averaged on the luminosity is around solar ( @xmath1220.04 ) .",
    "the star - formation timescale is longer than , or approximately equal to , the infall timescale of gas assembly .",
    "the significant majority of nearby galaxies ( weighted by their luminosity ) have @xmath123 , where @xmath58 is the redshift that star formation began .",
    "there was a peak in cosmic star - formation rate  density in the past , which was a factor of at least three times the present day rate . with the physical parameterization",
    ", the peak occurs between @xmath124 and @xmath125 ( using limits of @xmath126 and @xmath127myr ) . with the empirical parameterization ,",
    "the peak occurs at @xmath0 or @xmath52 ( with a instantaneous rise in the sfr at @xmath52 ) .",
    "strong _ upper limits _ on star formation at high redshift ( @xmath15 ) can be obtained if we take inputs on the value of low - redshift star formation ( @xmath16 ) from other studies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . if we take @xmath100 ( i.e. , at least 8 times the sfr at @xmath0 relative to @xmath14 ) , then @xmath96 ( salpeter imf , @xmath311 ) .",
    "these values are consistent with the no dust extinction sfr models of @xcite and rule out the test case of a much larger sfr density at high redshift with a dust opacity that increases rapidly with redshift ( their figure  7 , which has @xmath128 and @xmath129 ) .",
    "the test case is also not consistent with our results for @xmath312 which has @xmath130 for @xmath100 .",
    "this upper limit corresponds to a maximum of 65% and 55% of the stars forming at @xmath4 in @xmath1311 and @xmath312 , respectively .",
    "correspondingly , if we take @xmath132 then , a maximum of 80% and 75% formed at @xmath4 . note that if there is any significant star formation prior to @xmath52 , this will lower the value of @xmath15 ( or @xmath16 ) required to give a suitable model fit to the present - day cosmic spectrum .",
    "alternatively if we take the view that star formation was either constant or declining at high redshift ( i.e. @xmath93 ) then we infer a rise in sfr to redshift unity , @xmath94 , consistent with studies of luminosity density evolution .",
    "7 .   from the 2mass-2dfgrs  measurement of @xmath11",
    ", @xcite concluded that their results were `` only consistent with recent determinations of the integrated cosmic star formation if the correction for dust extinction is modest . '' here we find again that there can not be massive amounts of star formation concealed at high redshift by dust extinction .",
    "@xcite s analysis compares the @xmath133 and @xmath134 luminosity density derived from 2dfgrs   redshifts and 2mass photometry with semi - analytic models of galaxy / star - formation to derive an integrated stellar mass density today .",
    "our method derives the star - formation history empirically using 2dfgrs  spectra and redshifts .",
    "8 .   from the @xmath22  luminosity density of @xcite and computing the mass - to - light and sfr - to - light ratios from the pegase scenarios",
    ", we estimated the present - day stellar - mass density and sfr density .",
    "restricting the models to good fits with @xmath135 and @xmath136 , there is still significant degeneracy particularly with metallicity .",
    "for cosmology @xmath311 with the @xcite imf , @xmath137 is in the range 0.00200.0062 and @xmath138  is in the range 0.0240.065 @xmath139 , and with the @xcite imf , @xmath137 is in the range 0.00130.0033 and @xmath138  is in the range 0.0120.055 @xmath139 .",
    "for cosmology @xmath312 , the mass - to - light ratios increase and the values for @xmath137 are increased by a factor of about 1.2 .",
    "the sfr - to - light ratios remain approximately the same .",
    "these results are consistent with the stellar - mass density derived by @xcite  and with other derivations of the local sfr density ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "finally , we compare our results with two different compilations of cosmic sfr based on the rest - frame uv luminosity - density technique and with a compilation of various other techniques .",
    "the @xmath15-@xmath16 empirical parameterization was fitted to the data sets after converting to cosmology @xmath311 .",
    "the various contours are shown in figure  [ fig : contours - all ] with full references quoted in the caption .",
    "for the first uv compilation , we took the 10 data points with error bars from figure  9 of @xcite and calculated formal confidence boundaries in @xmath15 versus @xmath16 .",
    "the no extinction and extinction corrected data were considered separately .",
    "this compilation promotes a high value of @xmath140 with @xmath15 depending on extinction .    for the second uv compilation",
    ", we took 9 data points with error bars from figure  13 of @xcite for the 2800  luminosity density excluding those used in the first compilation .",
    "a minimum error of 0.07 in the log was used to calculate the boundaries .",
    "this compilation promotes `` a gradual decline '' in the uv luminosity density for @xmath141 with @xmath142 .      a precise interpretation of figure  [ fig : contours - all ] depends on the the accuracy of the errors used in the analysis . given the analysis presented here , the two uv compilations ( taking either extinction model from the first ) are consistent at the 3@xmath63 level with @xmath9 and @xmath144 , but not quite consistent at the 2@xmath63 level .",
    "our results are independently consistent with these ranges of values but do not constrain the region further .",
    "thus , evolutionary synthesis applied to the 2dfgrs - measured cosmic spectra ( @xmath1450.25 ) is in concordance with the best - fit results obtained from a variety of rest - frame uv luminosity - density measurements ( @xmath1464.5 ) .      with this technique of primarily using the ` high - frequency ' spectral information",
    ", there are still significant degeneracies in determining the cosmic star - formation history .",
    "however , combined with luminosity - density methods and with further improvements , there is the potential to obtain more accurate star - formation scenarios and to discriminate between imfs and cosmologies .",
    "for example , the separation of galaxies into groups with similar star - formation history  may help break the degeneracy , i.e. , reducing the merging of features between young and old populations .",
    "in addition , it may be possible to improve the fit to the spectra by combining models with different chemical evolution scenarios , e.g. , weighted combinations of spectra with different @xmath147 .",
    "future large surveys such as the sdss main galaxy sample will provide a consistency check with the 2dfgrs  spectra ( selected with different effective wavelengths , 6200  versus 4700 , magnitude limits and aperture diameters , see figure  [ fig : sel - ap ] ) . with the 2dfgrs   spectra ( resolution 89 ) , and especially so with the sdss spectra ( 34 )",
    ", it is apparent that higher spectral resolution population synthesis models ( @xmath1482  in the optical wavelength range ) are needed to maximize the scientific potential of these data sets .",
    "work is currently underway for this purpose .",
    "both galaxy surveys can also be used to measure the slope of luminosity density variation with redshift in the local universe which provides another star formation estimate from the same survey .",
    "this can done by either by using k - corrections and determining the luminosity function in the rest frame or by determining the luminosity function in observed wavelength , i.e. , the extra - galactic background light per unit redshift .",
    "these measurements can be used to apply further constraints on the cosmic star - formation scenarios and the absolute cosmic comoving star - formation rate  density ."
