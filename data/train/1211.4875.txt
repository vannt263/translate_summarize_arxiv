    "the dwarf spheroidal galaxies ( dsph ) surrounding the milky way ( mw ) are the galaxies studied in better detail than any other ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for a recent review ) , yet many fundamental questions about their nature remain unanswered .",
    "are they the most dark matter dominated galaxies we know of , as their large apparent dynamical mass - to - light ratios would suggest , or is tidal disruption a contributing factor ? what drives the observed variety of star formation and chemical enrichment histories ?",
    "were dsphs born as we see them today or are they the descendants of larger and intrinsically different systems ?",
    "the evolution of small systems such as dwarf galaxies is likely to be particularly suspectible to the environment that they have experienced as well as being influenced by their own low potential well .",
    "however , the relative importance of both these factors has yet to be established .    among the mw satellites ,",
    "an example of a dsph whose evolution may have been strongly affected by the environment is given by carina .",
    "this galaxy is the one `` classical '' dsph where most hints of tidal disruption have been found , such as the presence of probable members",
    "well beyond the nominal tidal radius , a rising velocity dispersion profile and a velocity shear reminiscent of tidally disrupted dwarf galaxies ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) . however , no report of such kinematical features is given in @xcite and @xcite , so that the hypothesis of tidal disruption awaits confirmation .",
    "carina is a particularly interesting object among the local group dwarf galaxies also because it is the only clear example of a galaxy with well - separated star formation episodes , visible as distinct main - sequence turn - offs ( msto ) in the colour - magnitude diagram ( e.g. * ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the effects of its unique sfh can be traced in its chemical evolution as well @xcite .",
    "it is unclear at present whether the influence of the mw may have induced the main sf episodes ( e.g. see simulations by * ? ? ?",
    "* ) as episodic sfhs can be qualitatively explained also by models of low mass dsphs treated in isolation ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "another feature that can provide information on the evolution of a small galaxy is the spatial distribution and kinematics of its stellar population mix .",
    "negative age and metallicity gradients are found in several of the local group dsphs , both around the mw @xcite and in isolation ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; the latter finding suggests that internal effects are the main drivers in setting up the observed gradients . in carina",
    ", indications of an age gradient have been found from the spatial distribution of red clump ( rc ) stars as compared to horizontal branch ( hb ) stars @xcite .",
    "although this is similar to the behaviour of other mw dsphs with multiple stellar components , for carina there have been no findings of different kinematics among the stars belonging to different age / metallicity ranges ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , unlike what observed in fornax , sculptor and sextans @xcite .",
    "interestingly , it has been shown that strong interaction with the mw is a viable mechanism for erasing differences in the kinematics of multiple stellar components @xcite .",
    "several of the observed properties of carina could therefore be explained in a framework of strong interaction with the mw .",
    "it is then particularly interesting to fully characterize the stellar population of this object and to put on a secure ground the possible existence of tidal features .",
    "here we present results from a deep , wide - area photometric survey of carina , which yields major improvements with respect to previous studies of the morphology and spatial distribution of carina s stellar population mix .",
    "deep optical photometry covering the carina dsph was obtained using the ctio 4-m mosaic  ii camera over 6 nights in december 2007 , as part of observing proposal 2007b-0232  ( pi : m. mateo ) .",
    "observations in the b and v bands were obtained in 8 pointings around the centre of carina , covering a total area of @xmath02 deg@xmath1 .",
    "the observing strategy was to obtain multiple long  ( @xmath0600s ) exposures for each pointing , which have been stacked together to obtain deep photometry .",
    "in addition , short  ( 30s ) exposures were also obtained , to sample bright stars that are saturated in the deep images . to ensure accurate photometric calibration of the data set ,",
    "observations of landolt standard fields  @xcite were made , covering a range of airmass and colour .",
    "first stage image processing steps included standard bias and overscan - correction , trimming to the reliable active detector area , and flatfielding via creation of master flats from a dithered set of b - band and v - band twilight sky exposures .",
    "the flatfielding step also corrects for internal gain variations between the detectors .",
    "prior to deep stacking of the individual exposures , detector - level catalogues were generated for each science image to refine the astrometric calibration and also to assess the data quality .",
    "for astrometric calibration , a zenithal polynomial projection @xcite was used to define the world coordinate system .",
    "a third - order polynomial includes all the significant telescope radial field distortions leaving just a six - parameter linear model per detector to completely define the astrometric transformations .",
    "the twomicronall sky survey ( 2mass ) point - source catalogue @xcite was used for the astrometric reference system .",
    "the common background regions in the overlap area from each image in the stack were used to compensate for sky variations during the exposure sequence and the final stack included seeing weighting , confidence ( i.e. variance ) map weighting and clipping of cosmic rays .",
    "catalogues for each deep stacked image were then generated using standard aperture photometry techniques ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) and cross - matching with published photometry of carina @xcite was used to directly photometrically calibrate the central fields .",
    "outlying fields were calibrated with respect to the central region using the overlaps between adjacent pointings .",
    "while the exact age of carina s sf episodes varies among the various works in the literature , there is consensus about carina experiencing at least three main sf episodes : an `` ancient '' one , around 11 - 13 gyr ago ; a main episode at intermediate ages ( around 2.5 - 4 gyr ago * ? ? ?",
    "* but @xmath27 gyr ago according to hurley - keller et al .",
    "1998 ) , after a long quiescent period ; a relatively recent episode , @xmath31 gyr ago ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the way these `` ancient '' , `` intermediate - age '' and `` young '' stellar components are spatially distributed has not been studied in detail yet .",
    "notably , notwithstanding its complex sfh , carina has a very narrow red giant branch ( rgb ) .",
    "this makes photometry of rgb stars unsuitable for exploring the existence of age gradients in this galaxy , even though such spatially extended data - sets exist ( @xmath210deg@xmath4 * ? ? ?",
    "indications for a negative age gradient in carina were found by @xcite over a relatively small radial range ( 30 ) , using photometry down to @xmath21mag below the hb .",
    "the shallow photometry allowed only the use of indirect age indicators for tracing the gradient , i.e. the rc for the young / intermediate - age stars and the hb for the ancient stars .",
    "figure  [ fig : cmd ] shows the colour - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) resulting from our photometric survey , split over a selection of elliptical radii @xmath5 .",
    "this spatially extended photometric data - set reaches down to @xmath22 magnitudes below the oldest msto , allowing us to trace possible age gradients _ directly _ from the presence or absence of the mstos belonging to the various sf episodes _ and _ over a large area .    in the innermost region ( r @xmath6 10 ) all the main features of the carina stellar population are present : the thin rgb , the rc , the red and blue hb , the ancient msto and sub - giant ( sgb ) , the intermediate - age msto and sgb , and younger ms stars at @xmath20 and 21@xmath7 _ v _",
    "@xmath7 23 ( for a detailed discussion on the various features of the cmd see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . at larger radii ( 10@xmath6_r_@xmath6 25 ) the young stars are barely visible , while the features containing intermediate - age and ancient stars are still well populated . in the outer parts ( _ r_@xmath8 25 ) ,",
    "the msto of the intermediate - age population disappears , while the ancient stars are still visible , as witnessed by the presence of the old msto and sgb .",
    "the above direct detection of an age gradient in carina , as traced from msto stars , confirms the early findings of @xcite and extends them over a much larger radial range .",
    "we note that the presence of a sizeable population of ancient msto stars in the last two panels of figure  [ fig : cmd ] ( _ r_@xmath8 25 ) shows that carina extends well beyond its nominal king tidal radius ( @xmath928.8 , * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter ih95 ) .",
    "this puts on a secure ground the conclusions by @xcite based on the spatial distribution and kinematics of a smaller sample rgb stars .",
    "both the presence of the age gradient and the large extent of carina are also illustrated by figure  [ fig : lf ] , where we compare to a control field the luminosity function ( lf ) in bins of @xmath5 of stars in the region of the ms , msto and sgb . owing to the large extent of carina",
    "it is difficult to accurately identify a region containing only contaminants ( i.e. mw stars and unresolved galaxies ) to use as a control field .",
    "we chose to use a sub - region of the outermost pointing on the north - east ( see figure  [ fig : fov ] ) because it has the lowest density of objects among the various pointings ; the significantly different shape of the control field lf from the two outer elliptical zones confirms that it mostly contains contaminants and demonstrates the presence of appreciable numbers of carina members out to 1 degree radius .",
    "furthermore , the similarity of the lfs of the two outer zones and the absence of obvious intermediate - age and young stars beyond @xmath225 strongly suggest this extended structure is made up primarily of ancient stars .",
    "figure  [ fig : fov]a illustrates the spatial distribution of the overall carina stellar population after applying magnitude cuts of b@xmath625.1 , v@xmath625.5 - corresponding to @xmath250% completeness levels - to counter the variable depth of the pointings due to differences in total exposure time . to minimize the presence of contaminants , we isolate the main features of carina s overall stellar population on the cmd via selection in magnitude and color .",
    "figure  [ fig : fov]b , c , d show how the spatial distribution varies with age .",
    "the isodensity contours in each panel were derived from maps of stellar counts ( hess diagrams ) on a 2 @xmath10 2 pixel grid , from which we subtracted the density of contaminants , @xmath11 .",
    "this was calculated as the median of the pixel values in the control field ( shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fov ] and discussed in [ sec : cmds ] ) .",
    "the iso - density contours are then plotted in units of noise ( @xmath12 ) , which we determine as the r.m.s . of the pixel values in the contaminant - substracted control field .",
    "should the derived @xmath11 be overestimated because of a leakage of carina s stars , the main effect will cause carina to appear smaller than it is and to underestimate the significance of the contours ; hence the extent of carina found here shold be considered as a `` lower limit '' and the significance of the outer contours as conservative .",
    "figure  [ fig : fov]a shows that the main body of carina appears of regular morpology , although with slightly boxy iso - density contours , out to _ r_@xmath218 - 20 @xmath2 0.6 - 0.7 r@xmath13 . beyond this radius ,",
    "the contours become elongated and distort , with very extended tails emerging from both sides of the main body and a well - defined over - density of stars at ( @xmath14,@xmath15)@xmath2(@xmath1660,@xmath1630 ) . the much larger number statistics of this study with respect to studies in the literature",
    "makes it possible to observe isophote elongation and twists ; these had not be detected in previous , shallower photometric surveys of carina , even though optimized to minimize the contamination from mw stars ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "fitting of ellipses as function of @xmath5 to the map of stellar counts confirms the change in shape and orientation of the contours , yielding a p.a . and ellipticity @xmath17 that are constant around a p.a .",
    "@xmath18 53.5@xmath191.0 and @xmath20 0.29@xmath190.01 at @xmath21 18 , and then increase , yielding a p.a.@xmath18 62.5@xmath190.5 and @xmath20 0.35@xmath190.02 at @xmath22 18 ; the latter values tend to the literature values of p.a.@xmath1865@xmath195 , @xmath200.33@xmath190.05 @xcite .",
    "we note also the presence of a break in the surface number count profile of carina s stars lying along the projected major axis of the system ( figure  [ fig : dens ] ) .",
    "the break occurs in both n - e and s - w halves of the galaxy at around 20from the center , where the iso - density contours start becoming elongated , and at a similar radial distance to that found by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* e.g. ) in shallower samples .",
    "the youngest carina stars do not extend as far out as the intermediate - age and ancient ones , but signs of isophote elongation are arguably also visible in the spatial distribution of these stars ( figure  [ fig : fov ]  b ) .",
    "this would set the last pericentric passage less than 1 - 2 gyr ago .",
    "the intermediate - age and ancient population both show distorted outer isophotes ( figure  [ fig : fov ]  c , d ) . notably , as visible in the figure and confirmed by ellipse fitting of the hess diagrams , the shape parameters of the contours are subtly different for these two stellar populations of different ages and may impact on models trying to reconstruct the orbital history of carina .",
    "we have used ctio / mosaic  ii photometry to study the morphology and spatial distribution of carina s stellar population mix .",
    "the combination of wide - area and photometric depth , reaching down to @xmath22  mag below the oldest msto , allows for a direct detection of an extensive age gradient in carina , traced from the presence / absence of the mstos belonging to the various sf episodes .",
    "we find a clear presence of ancient msto stars at @xmath23 25 , which demonstrates that carina extends well beyond its literature nominal tidal radius , confirming results from previous works .",
    "the increased number statistics from this study reveals the existence of faint features such as isophote elongation and twists , that could not be detected in previous shallower photometric surveys .",
    "such features are even visible when separating the stars in age .",
    "we confirm the presence of a clear break in the surface brightness profile at radii @xmath820 and observe an over - density of stars in the s - w half of carina , at @xmath270 from the center .",
    "features such as breaks in the surface brightness profile , together with variations in the elongation and direction of the isophotes , have been detected in other objects that are good candidates for ongoing tidal distruption such as ngc205 and m32 @xcite , and are predicted by n - body simulations of tidally disrupted dwarf galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these morphological traits strongly suggests that carina is being tidally disrupted .    at a distance of @xmath2100kpc the low galactocentric line - of - sight velocity of carina ( @xmath27 km / s ) places it either close to apocenter or pericenter .",
    "given the signs of tidal disturbance and the current best estimate of the proper motion @xcite , carina is most probably close to apocenter with an orbital period of between 1 - 2 gyr and hence the last pericentric passage likely occurred @xmath61 gyr ago .",
    "the presence of signs of tidal disruption at apocenter is consistent with the timescales from the simulations of @xcite , where tidal tails can remain clearly visible at projected radii larger than the break radius until up to @xmath215 dynamical crossing times , i.e. between 1 - 2 gyr in this case .",
    "the existence of signs of tidal disruption complicates the interpretation of the observed age gradient , as it is not obvious whether it was ( in part ) already in place before carina was tidally disturbed .",
    "related questions are whether carina showed distinct kinematic signatures for the different populations prior to tidal interactions and how these may have been affected by close pericentric passages .",
    "this also impacts on the derived dark matter content and distribution . treated as an isolated equilibrium system , carina has a large dynamical mass - to - light ratio ( e.g. m / l@xmath24100 ( m / l)@xmath25 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , as do most other `` classical '' dsphs .",
    "an attempt to model carina as a tidally perturbed system was made by @xcite , who found that the surface brightness and internal kinematic properties of carina are compatible with a mass - follows - light model still containing large amounts of dark matter ( m / l@xmath240 ) .",
    "the 2d distribution resulting from such model is remarkably regular , in contrast with what is observed here over the same spatial region .",
    "however , it should be considered that the best model of @xcite was aiming at reproducing the spatial distribution from the data available at the time , too shallow to reveal the signs of tidal distorsion seen in our survey .",
    "knowledge of the distorted structure of the galaxy from this deep survey , combined with the extensive spectroscopic data - sets present in the literature ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , should provide important constraints for assessing the impact of tidal disruption on the derived mass - to - light ratio - and dark matter content .",
    "tidal disruption of dwarf galaxies has been detected in some m  31 satellites ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , around the mw , apart from the clear case of sagittarius , the quest has proven difficult due to the combination of the large extent on the sky of mw dsphs and their low surface brightness .",
    "the question therefore remains if tidal disruption is common among the mw dsphs and ultra - faint dwarfs , or whether carina belongs to a `` minority '' of tidally disrupted objects such as the sagittarius dwarf @xcite .",
    "hints of tidal disruption have been found in some of these other systems , e.g. ursa  minor ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , leo  i @xcite , ursa  major  ii @xcite .",
    "in contrast , draco , the only other dsph surveyed with photometric data as deep and wide - area as those used here , shows a `` flawless '' , regular morphology @xcite and an enourmous m / l @xmath2300 @xcite .",
    "the research leading to these results has received funding from the european union seventh framework program ( fp7/2007 - 2013 ) under grant agreement number pief - ga-2010 - 274151 .",
