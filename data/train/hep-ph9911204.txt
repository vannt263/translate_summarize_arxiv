    "first , let me recall the reasons why we wish to consider chiral quark models with non - local regulators ( see also the contribution by bojan golli and georges ripka to these proceedings ) :    1 .",
    "non - locality arises naturally in several approaches to low - energy quark dynamics , such as the instanton - liquid model @xcite or schwinger - dyson resummations @xcite . for the discussions of various `` derivations '' and applications of non - local quark models see , _ e.g._,@xcite .",
    "hence , we should cope with non - local regulators from the outset .",
    "non - local interactions regularize the theory in such a way that the anomalies are preserved @xcite and charges are properly quantized . with other methods , such as the proper - time regularization or",
    "the quark - loop momentum cut - off @xcite the preservation of the anomalies can only be achieved if the ( finite ) anomalous part of the action is left unregularized , and only the non - anomalous ( infinite ) part is regularized .",
    "if both parts are regularized , anomalies are violated badly @xcite .",
    "we consider such a division artificial and find it quite appealing that with non - local regulators both parts of the action can be treated on equal footing .",
    "3 .   with non - local interactions",
    "the effective action is finite to all orders in the loop expansion ( @xmath1 expansion ) . in particular ,",
    "meson loops are finite and there is no more need to introduce extra cut - offs , as was necessary in the case of local models @xcite . as the result , non - local models have more predictive power .",
    "4 .   as bojan golli",
    ", georges ripka and wb have shown @xcite , stable solitons exist in a chiral quark model with non - local interactions without the extra constraint that forces the @xmath2 and @xmath3 fields to lie on the chiral circle .",
    "such a constraint is external to the known derivations of effective chiral quark models .",
    "the empirical values of the low - energy constants @xmath4 and @xmath5 of the effective weak chiral lagrangian are better reproduced within the non - local model @xcite compared to the conventional njl model .    in view of these improvements",
    "it becomes important to look at all other applications of effective quark models and compare the predictions of non - local and local versions .",
    "in this talk we will present results for the vector - meson correlators .    = 11 cm    [ analyt ]    the basic object of our study is the meson correlation function , defined as @xmath6 where @xmath7 denotes the time - ordered product , and @xmath8 describes a color - singlet quark bilinear with appropriate lorentz and flavor matrix , _",
    "e.g. _ in the @xmath9-meson channel we have @xmath10 .",
    "the tensor structure can be taken away , with @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is a tensor in the lorentz and isospin indices , and @xmath13 is a scalar function .",
    "the powerful feature of @xmath13 is its analyticity in the @xmath14 variable , which will be used shortly . in figure 1",
    "we display various regions in the complex @xmath14 plane : the positive real axis is the physical region , with poles and cuts corresponding to physical states in the particular channel .",
    "in that physical region we have ( for certain channels ) direct experimental information .",
    "far to the left , at the end of the negative real axis , is the deep - euclidean region , where perturbative qcd and its operator product expansion can be applied .",
    "there is yet another region , close to @xmath15 on the negative real axis : the _ shallow - euclidean _ region .",
    "this is the playground of the effective chiral models .",
    "indeed , the most successful attempt to derive such a model from qcd , namely , the instanton - liquid model , has a natural limitation to that region of momenta @xcite .",
    "more to the point , we believe that all effective chiral quark models should be used _ in and only in _ the shallow euclidean domain .",
    "there have been many attempts , however , to apply such models directly to the physical region . in our opinion",
    "these are doomed to fail because of the lack of confinement , which is a key player in the physical region . with unconfined quarks ,",
    "the unphysical @xmath16 continuum obstructs any model calculation for @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the `` constituent '' quark mass .",
    "for these reasons of principles we always remain with the model at low negative @xmath14 @xcite , and compare to the data via the dispersion relation which holds for the _ physical _ correlator . in other words ,",
    "we bring the physical data to the shallow euclidean region via the dispersion relation .",
    "this is similar in spirit to the qcd sum rule approach , where one compares the physical spectrum to the deep euclidean region via ( borelized ) dispersion relation ( see figure 1 ) .",
    "the correlators considered here satisfy the twice - subtracted dispersion relation @xmath19 where @xmath20 , and @xmath21 are subtraction constants .",
    "relation ( [ disprel ] ) holds for the _ physical _ correlators , and does not in general hold for the correlators evaluated in models @xcite . for some channels ( vector channels )",
    "@xmath22 is obtained directly from experiment , in other channels we have indirect information only , _",
    "e.g. _ from qcd  sum rules .",
    "let us take the @xmath23-meson channel , where @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "the spectral strength in related to the ratio @xmath26 known very accurately from experiment .",
    "the spectral strength peaks at the position of the @xmath23-meson pole , and at large @xmath27 assumes the perturbative - qcd value . for our task",
    "it is more convenient to use the simple pole+continuum parameterization of @xmath28 , such as used _",
    "e.g. _ in qcd  sum rules . in a given channel",
    "the fit has the form @xmath29 where @xmath30 is known from perturbative qcd , and @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 are chosen such that the experimental data are reproduced . in the @xmath9-channel we have @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , and @xmath37 @xcite .",
    "since all our calculations will be done in the leading-@xmath38 level , we drop the @xmath39 correction in @xmath30 .    with the parametrization ( [ fitrho ] ) we readily obtain from ( [ disprel ] ) @xmath40 on the other hand",
    ", @xmath41 can be calculated directly in chiral quark models in the shallow euclidean space .",
    "we denote this model correlation @xmath42 as want to compare it somehow to @xmath43 .",
    "one possibility is to fourier - transform to coordinate space @xcite . here",
    "we apply a simpler method , which relies on just taylor - expanding @xmath43 and @xmath44 in the @xmath45 variable . for the phenomenological correlator we get from eq .",
    "( [ rhophen ] ) @xmath46 , \\label{rhophexp}\\ ] ] whereas for the model correlator we can write @xmath47 with the expansion coefficients @xmath48 yet to be determined .",
    "we can now compare the coefficients @xmath49 and @xmath48 , and form a set of `` sum rules '' . with two subtractions in ( [ disprel ] )",
    "we can start at @xmath50 : @xmath51 , @xmath52 . with the explicit form ( [ rhophexp ] ) this gives @xmath53 sum rules for higher values of @xmath54 are sensitive to the details of the phenomenological spectrum , hence are not going to be of much help .    in some channels",
    "the coupling constant @xmath31 is not well known .",
    "we can then eliminate it from eqs .",
    "( [ cqsr ] ) to obtain @xmath55 sum rules ( [ cqsr ] ) or ( [ cqsr2 ] ) can be used to verify model predictions for meson correlators .",
    "the model evaluation of meson correlators is well known . at the leading-@xmath38 level one",
    "has    the diagrams with the dashed line occur only if the coupling constant @xmath56 is non - zero in a given channel .",
    "this is the case of the of the @xmath57 and @xmath58 channels . in the vector channels they may or may not be present , depending on whether we allow for explicit vector interactions between the quarks .",
    "we first consider the @xmath9-channel in the local njl model with the proper - time regularization @xcite .",
    "after some simple algebra we get @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the constituent quark mass generated by the spontaneous breaking of the chiral symmetry , and @xmath61 is the proper - time cut - off , adjusted such that the pion decay constant has its experimental value , @xmath62 .",
    "here we work in the strict chiral limit , with the current quark mass set to zero .",
    "the results for sum rules ( [ cqsr2 ] ) are shown in table [ rhonjl0 ] .",
    "we can see that the ratios of phenomenological to model coefficients @xmath63 and @xmath64 are larger than @xmath65 , and increase rather rapidly with increasing @xmath60 .",
    "thus the sum rules ( [ cqsr ] ) favor lower values of @xmath60 .",
    "however , even for such low values as @xmath66 the ratios @xmath67 and @xmath68 are still significantly above @xmath65 .",
    "we conclude that the model is far from satisfying the sum rules ( [ cqsr ] ) .",
