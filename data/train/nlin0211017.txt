    "coherent quantum transport on a mesoscopic scale is the origin of many intriguing transport phenomena in complex systems @xcite .",
    "the somewhat vague attribute `` complex '' summarizes a multitude of more specific physical situations : complex dynamics can be generated by disorder , by many - particle interactions , and by dynamical chaos , to name a few .",
    "arguably one of the most prominent and most fundamental coherence effects in complex quantum transport is anderson localization @xcite , the quantum suppression of conductance across a disordered , quasi one - dimensional solid - state lattice .",
    "viewed as a scattering problem , it essentially manifests itself in exponentially small transmission probabilities from input to output of the sample , as a consequence of multiple scattering events ( with finite reflection and transmission coefficients ) at randomly placed scattering sites along the lattice .",
    "this naturally generates a multitude of transmission amplitudes which have to be summed up coherently on output .",
    "if their individual phases have been randomized by the disordered lattice potential , they will tend to interfere destructively . in terms of electronic eigenfunctions ,",
    "anderson localization enforces their exponential localization on the lattice domain .",
    "the degree of localization is characterized by the localization length @xmath0 , which should be compared to the sample size @xmath1 , in order to allow predictions on the conductance across the sample @xcite .",
    "complexity is brought about in this problem by two components : ( a ) the large number of interfering transmission amplitudes , and ( b ) the disordered lattice potential which breaks the translational invariance ( which otherwise would reduce the complexity introduced by ( a ) through some kind of bragg condition ) .    as mentioned before",
    ", complexity can have different causes , and therefore a random potential is not necessary to enforce vanishing total transition amplitudes or exponentially localized eigenfunctions  any mechanism which equidistributes the phases of the individual interfering amplitudes will do .",
    "in particular , dynamical chaos can substitute for disorder in quantum systems with a well - defined classical counterpart , and more generally , if such an analogy is unavailable , deterministic quantum systems with largely broken symmetries or non - perturbatively coupled degrees of freedom ( displaying quantum chaos ) can replace the simple scenario of a disordered lattice ( there is a caveat concerning the dimensionality of the dynamics , but we shall restrain here to effectively one - dimensional systems ) @xcite . the only further ingredient required for such systems to mimic anderson",
    "s scenario is a sufficiently high density of states , such that a sufficient number of transition amplitudes can interfere . at the quantum - classical interface",
    ", this corresponds to sufficiently small values of the effective planck constant @xmath2 , which is determined ( via the uncertainty principle ) by the comparison of @xmath3 to the typical scales of the given problem , measured in canonical action - angle variables @xcite .    besides simple billiard shaped cavities , which are of some relevance in the context of microdisc lasers @xcite , strongly perturbed atomic @xcite and molecular @xcite systems are perfect candidates to study signatures of anderson localization in quantum systems without disorder .",
    "the simplest ( though realistic ) representative of the latter is the hydrogen atom exposed to electromagnetic fields @xcite , with the atom initially prepared in a rydberg level of principal quantum number @xmath4 , and a driving field frequency @xmath5 near resonant with the atomic transition @xmath6 , i.e. , within the microwave range .",
    "such choice of the relevant parameters satisfies both general requirements stated above : on the one hand , the ionization potential of a rydberg state @xmath7 ( we neglect the angular degree of freedom in our present treatment ) requires the ( net ) absorption of approximately @xmath8 photons to establish a transition to the atomic continuum .",
    "if , much as in the solid - state problem , each atomic bound state @xmath9 ( with energy @xmath10 ) which is quasi resonantly coupled to the initial state ( i.e. , @xmath11 , @xmath12 integer , and @xmath13 the detuning from resonance ) plays the role of a single scatterer of the lattice , then a large number of transition amplitudes between @xmath7 and the continuum become available ( notice that emission events will eventually couple states with @xmath14 as well ) .",
    "this number rapidly increases with @xmath15 , which therefore plays the role of the `` atomic sample size '' , in analogy to the length @xmath1 of a solid - state sample @xcite . on the other hand , due to the nonlinearity of the coulomb potential , the detuning @xmath16 , which determines the coupling strength between quasi resonantly coupled states ,",
    "will be effectively randomized ( much alike the simple generation of random numbers by a mod operation @xcite ) , and this accounts for randomizing the phases of the various transition amplitudes which mediate the ionization process @xcite .",
    "consequently , the general scenery for anderson localization to occur  this time on the energy axis rather than along the lattice  is set .",
    "in addition , a perfect classical analogue exists for the driven hydrogen atom : it is well - established that ionization is brought about by classical chaos , in the specified parameter range , since the quasi resonant coupling of sequences of rydberg states described above destroys the good quantum numbers of the problem , which is synonymous to nonintegrability on the classical level @xcite .",
    "indeed , the above analogy between charge transport through disordered solids and the ionization of rydberg states by microwave fields has been identified approximately 20 years ago @xcite .",
    "baptized `` dynamical localization '' ( to stress its origin in dynamical chaos rather than in disorder ) it has been qualitatively demonstrated by several independent experimental groups , on various atomic species @xcite .",
    "a theoretical framework  known as `` photonic localization theory '' @xcite  which relies on an ingenious mixture of crude approximations on the atomic side and deep physical intuition on the statistical side , provides explicit expressions for the mean of the localization length @xmath17 and for the sample size @xmath18 where the factor in parenthesis in ( [ samplelength ] ) accounts for a shift of the ionization threshold to the finite value @xmath19 , induced by experimentally unavoidable stray electric fields @xcite .",
    "@xmath20 and @xmath21 are the frequency and amplitude scaled with respect to the classical kepler frequency , and to the coulomb field amplitude along the unperturbed classical rydberg orbit , respectively @xcite .",
    "according to the scaling theory of localization @xcite , @xmath0 fluctuates around @xmath22 for different realizations of the sample , at finite @xmath15 , and tends to the non - fluctuating , sample independent value @xmath22 only for @xmath23 , with the statistical distribution of @xmath0 completely determined by the localization parameter @xmath24 by virtue of this last expression , different realizations of the same value of @xmath25 can be realized , at fixed @xmath26 , by simultaneously tuning @xmath27 and @xmath28 over a finite interval . since , for an exponentially localized wave function on the energy axis , the population close to threshold is @xmath29 , the `` atomic conductance '' @xmath30 , and this is nothing but the total transition probability to the atomic continuum , should then reflect the fluctuations of @xmath31 in _ exponentially enhanced _ fluctuations via @xmath32 consequently , anderson localization of the electronic bound - space population of a periodically driven rydberg state implies large scale fluctuations of @xmath30 and also of the total ionization yield , under changes of @xmath28 , at fixed values of @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "this latter prediction has been verified in a recent publication @xcite on the conductance of periodically driven one - dimensional rydberg states of atomic hydrogen .",
    "more precisely , @xcite demonstrated the lognormal distribution of @xmath30 ( which follows from a normal distribution of @xmath31 , via ( [ atcond ] ) ) , and the approximately linear dependence of @xmath33 on @xmath34 @xcite , for the single value @xmath35 of the principal quantum number .",
    "however , the following highly relevant questions remained unaddressed :    * sample size @xmath15 and localization parameter @xmath25 explicitely depend on @xmath26 , and therefore on @xmath36 ( the latter relation is a direct consequence of the scale invariance of the classical equations of motion of the driven rydberg electron @xcite ) . in the light of our qualitative discussion above , @xmath15 and therefore @xmath26 must not be too small for the anderson picture to prevail in the atomic ionization process , since otherwise not enough transition amplitudes with quasi random phases will contribute to the total ionization yield . hence , are we able to detect significant deviations from the predictions of anderson s model in the atomic problem , for smaller values of @xmath26 ? * which are the smallest values of @xmath26 for which the dominant signatures of anderson localization remain detectable in the ionization process ? * can we confirm the linear dependence of @xmath33 on @xmath34 for variable values of @xmath26 ? *",
    "under which conditions are the predicted fluctuations of the atomic conductance experimentally observable ?",
    "the present contribution attempts to answer these questions .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : section [ theory ] summarizes our theoretical / numerical approach to the atomic problem at hand , and introduces our definition of the atomic conductance . in section [ atomfluct ]",
    "we investigate the statistical properties of the atomic conductance , and particularly their dependence on the principal quantum number @xmath26 , which explicitely enters equations  ( [ locallength]-[lparameter ] ) .",
    "section [ conclusions ] concludes the paper , with a discussion of the experimental implications of our results .",
    "the hamiltonian of a hydrogen atom exposed to an electromagnetic field polarized along the @xmath37-axis reads , in atomic units : @xmath38 here , the dipole approximation in the velocity gauge was used , we dropped the ponderomotive energy shift , assumed an infinite mass of the nucleus , and neglected relativistic effects @xcite . in the following ,",
    "we shall furthermore restrict configuration space to the single dimension defined by the field polarization axis , which results in the hamiltonian @xmath39 this approximation was chosen to keep the numerical effort necessary for sampling sufficient statistical data within reasonable bounds , and is also justified for atoms initially prepared in extremal parabolic states which are quasi one - dimensional eigenstates of the unperturbed hydrogen atom @xcite .",
    "even for real three - dimensional atomic initial states with low angular momentum quantum numbers has this one - dimensional model been shown to yield quantitatively satisfactory results , within a certain parameter regime @xcite .",
    "nonewithstanding , an extension of our present work to the real three - dimensional world remains clearly desirable and will bear further surprises , but is at present an extremely expensive enterprise which saturates the largest computer facilities currently available . for the time being , despite their restricted range of predictive power , our subsequent results exhibit enough novel phenomena which shed new light on the atomic ionization process , and indicate the road to follow in future 3d calculations .    in order to extract ionization yields from the time - periodic hamiltonian ( [ hamilton6 ] )",
    ", we exploit the floquet theorem and diagonalize the floquet hamiltonian @xmath40 in a sturmian basis , after complex dilation @xcite .",
    "this provides direct access to the poles of the resolvent of @xmath41 , and hence an exact representation of the green s function and of the associated time evolution operator of our problem .",
    "the latter finally leads ( after an average over the initial phase of the driving field ) to the following expression for the atomic ionization yield @xmath42 as a function of the interaction time @xmath43 @xcite : @xmath44 the sum runs over a single floquet zone of length @xmath45 on the energy axis @xcite , the @xmath46 represent the ionization rates of individual floquet eigenstates @xmath47 of the atom in the field , and the @xmath48 are their weights in the decomposition of the atomic initial state @xmath7 over the floquet basis . note that for @xmath49 approximately @xmath50 floquet states contribute with non - vanishing @xmath48 to the sum in ( [ ionprob ] )",
    "therefore , we are in a situation which is profoundly different from the single - state approximation familiar from the ionization of atoms ( initially prepared in their ground state ) by intense optical fields @xcite .    from ( [ ionprob ] ) , we can now derive a definition of the atomic conductance @xmath30 , in terms of the spectral information obtained from the diagonalization of @xmath51 , as the average ionization rate at @xmath52 @xcite : @xmath53 in order to render @xmath30 dimensionless , we divided by the average level spacing @xmath54 of the floquet eigenvalues .",
    "furthermore , since in the atomic problem there is no incoming particle flux as in the solid - state transmission problem , it is reasonable to take the derivative at @xmath52 , in the above expression .",
    "note that the right - hand - side of ( [ atomconduct1 ] ) is strongly reminiscent of landauer s formula for the conductance across a disordered sample @xcite , if we identify the floquet rates @xmath46 with matrix elements of the transition matrix in the solid - state problem .",
    "indeed , such an identification can be justified more formally , as we shall show elsewhere @xcite .",
    "we have now set the scene for our statistical analysis of the atomic conductance . to gain a qualitative impression of the phenomenon we are dealing with ,",
    "let us first focus on the parameter dependence of the ionization yield , equation  ( [ ionprob ] ) , of the initial state @xmath55 , for two different values @xmath56 and @xmath57 , and an interaction time @xmath58 @xcite",
    ". shows our numerical result , within the interval @xmath59 $ ] ( 500 equidistant values of @xmath28 were found sufficient to resolve all structures of the signal ) . for @xmath56 ,",
    "the ionization yield is typically very small , close to zero , but is locally strongly enhanced ( by orders of magnitude ) , at apparently random values of @xmath28 .",
    "also for @xmath60 the yield exhibits large fluctuations , however around a clearly finite average value larger than zero , and of the same order of magnitude as the average ionization probability .",
    "both cases are reminiscent of conductance fluctuations through disordered solid - state samples , in the localized ( @xmath56 ) and in the diffusive ( or delocalized , @xmath61 ) regime , respectively @xcite .",
    "note that the observed fluctuations occur on a scale @xmath62 , i.e. @xmath63 is a _",
    "function of @xmath28 on scales @xmath64 or smaller @xcite . for @xmath65 ,",
    "this corresponds to a typical frequency window of approximately @xmath66 , on which the fluctuations should be detectable , rather than on scales smaller by one order of magnitude , as considered in @xcite .    to deduce the @xmath28-dependence of the atomic conductance from the yield displayed in figure  [ fig1 ] , we still need to extract the average level spacing @xmath54 from the raw numerical data .",
    "since not all eigenstates @xmath47 of @xmath51 actually contribute to the ionization of @xmath7 , we have to account for the relative weight @xmath48 of the individual floquet eigenstates in our definition of @xmath54 .",
    "one way of doing so is to estimate the number of effectively contributing floquet states as @xmath67 , via the shannon entropy @xmath68 @xcite .",
    "another way @xcite is to assume that as many floquet states contribute to the ionization dynamics as there are quasi resonantly coupled unperturbed states between the atomic initial state and the continuum threshold , i.e. @xmath15 ( see equation  ( [ samplelength ] ) above ) .",
    "both estimates consistently provide similar results , i.e. , @xmath69 as illustrated in figure  [ fig2 ] , in the localized as well as in the delocalized regime ( note that , more precisely , @xmath70 in the localized regime , and @xmath71 in the delocalized regime , what is consistent with the interpretation of @xmath15 as the atomic sample size ) .",
    "we checked that this remains true for all values of @xmath26 considered hereafter , and that the statistical properties of @xmath30 are insensitive to the definition of @xmath54 we choose , except for an irrelevant offset .",
    "therefore , all subsequent results are presented with the convention @xmath72 .    with this definition ,",
    "we show the @xmath28-dependence of the atomic conductance in figure  [ fig3 ] , for two values of @xmath73 , as well as for the two values of the localization parameter already employed in figure  [ fig1 ] .",
    "clearly , the erratic fluctuations of @xmath63 carry over to the atomic conductance .",
    "note that in the localized regime ( @xmath74 ) the fluctuations manifest on a _ logarithmic _ scale ( @xmath75 is plotted vs. @xmath28 on the left column of figure  [ fig3 ] ) , whereas the fluctuations of @xmath30 are of the same order of magnitude as its average value , in the delocalized regime ( @xmath60 , right column of figure  [ fig3 ] , @xmath30 is plotted vs. @xmath28 ) .",
    "furthermore , the scale @xmath76 of the fluctuations clearly becomes finer as the principal quantum number @xmath26 is increased from @xmath77 to @xmath55 , an observation which is consistent with the increased density of states as one approaches the ionization threshold .",
    "it should be stressed here that such large fluctuations , especially those in the localized regime , are truely remarkable , since they manifest in a quantity which represents a weighted _ average _ over the entire floquet spectrum , according to equation ( [ atomconduct1 ] ) . in an experiment with , say , @xmath78 , and a carrier frequency of approximately @xmath79 , a detuning of approximately @xmath80 can enhance the ionization yield from virtually zero to more than @xmath81 ! it has been shown earlier @xcite that specific , _ individual _ floquet eigenstates of the atom in the field may exhibit large scale , erratic fluctuations of their ionization rates under changes of some control parameter , for instance of @xmath28 . here , it is the conspiracy of the distribution of the weights @xmath48 and rates @xmath46 over the entire spectrum which produces a similar effect !",
    "let us now proceed to a first quantitative test of photonic localization theory . if the atomic localization parameter @xmath25 defined in ( [ lparameter ] )",
    "indeed plays the same crucial role as in the solid - state problem , then @xmath82 should decrease linearly with increasing @xmath83 , by virtue of ( [ lparameter],[atcond ] ) .",
    "shows our numerical result , for different values of @xmath26 .",
    "apparently , the solid - state prediction is almost perfectly followed for the largest principal quantum number ( i.e. , the largest individual values of @xmath22 and @xmath15 in ( [ locallength],[samplelength ] ) ) . on the other hand , the smaller @xmath26 , and , hence , the smaller @xmath22 and @xmath15 , the larger are the deviations from the linear dependence .",
    "this , however , can be readily understood since the deviations systematically ( for all values of @xmath26 ) occur for localization parameters ( small @xmath25 , large @xmath84 ) which correspond to average localization lengths @xmath85 ( down to @xmath86 , for @xmath87 and @xmath77 ) .",
    "then , according to the simple picture developed in the introduction , no more than two bound states of the atom are efficiently coupled by the driving field , and it does not make any sense to speak of an electronic wave function which is exponentially localized over quasi resonantly coupled bound states on the energy axis . as a matter of fact , it is rather surprising that the linear behaviour is observed in figure  [ fig4 ] for values of @xmath22 as small as 3 or 4 , since the assumptions @xcite for the derivation of ( [ locallength ] ) imply @xmath88 .",
    "a further quantitative test of the analogy between atomic and solid - state transport problem is the statistical distribution of the atomic conductance sampled over different values of @xmath28 , for fixed @xmath25 .",
    "figures [ fig5 ] and [ fig7 ] show histograms of @xmath75 , for @xmath89 , respectively , and @xmath90 ( for each histogram , approx .",
    "@xmath91 resonances with nonvanishing weights @xmath48 contribute to @xmath92 values of @xmath30 ) .",
    "systematically , the lognormal fits of the histograms obtained from our data improve as @xmath26 is increased , in particular in the wings of the distributions . for small @xmath25 , low values of @xmath26 tend to induce a sharp cut - off at small conductances , what we attribute once more to the increasing `` granularity '' of the ionization process as @xmath26 decreases",
    ". for principal quantum numbers @xmath93 , however , the distributions of the atomic conductance are well fitted @xcite by the lognormal prediction derived from the anderson model .    for given @xmath26 and growing @xmath25 , the distribution of @xmath75 shifts to larger values , as visible , e.g. , in figures  [ fig7 ] and [ fig9 ] , for @xmath55 , and also from figure  [ fig4 ] .",
    "furthermore , as already could be expected from the comparison of the @xmath28-dependence of the atomic conductance for @xmath56 and @xmath61 ( figure  [ fig3 ] ) , the lognormal fit ceases to be a good approximation of the histograms for too large values of @xmath25 . as evident from figure  [ fig9 ] ,",
    "the distribution starts to get asymmetric at @xmath61 , and is clearly not lognormal any more for @xmath94 .",
    "this transition from the localized to the delocalized ( or diffusive @xcite ) regime is even more pronounced in figure  [ fig10 ] , where we plot the histogram of @xmath30 rather than of @xmath95 : with @xmath25 increasing from @xmath96 to @xmath97 , the distribution shifts to larger values , broadens , and develops a large gap at @xmath98 .",
    "still , a gaussian distribution of @xmath30 as observed for diffusive transport in the solid - state transmission problem @xcite can not be established here .    finally , we examined the variances of @xmath75 as obtained from our numerical data , for different values of @xmath26 .",
    "the result is shown in figure  [ fig11 ] . whereas localization theory suggests a linear dependence @xmath99 @xcite",
    ", our data appear to support this expectation only within a finite interval of @xmath100 , which furthermore depends on @xmath26 , and can be roughly confined by the limits @xmath101 . for small values of @xmath102 ,",
    "the variance systematically drops faster than linearly , and it turns out that its overall dependence on the average conductance is best fitted by a quadratic law , for all @xmath26 . once again , we attribute this deviation from the solid - state picture to the finite size effect which already manifested itself in the dependence of @xmath103 on @xmath83 , and in the distribution of @xmath75 , for small values of @xmath25 . for too small localization lengths , the distribution of @xmath75 is not lognormal any more .",
    "deviations notably occur in the wings , and we can not expect a linear variation of @xmath33 in this parameter regime .",
    "on the other extreme , at large localization parameters , the variance saturates , in accordance with our observations in figures  [ fig3 ] , [ fig4 ] , and [ fig10 ] , as well as with general expectations for diffusive transport in disordered solids @xcite .",
    "to summarize , we can now respond to the questions we formulated at the beginning of this paper .",
    "our above results demonstrate that the essential statistical features of the conductance across an anderson - localized solid - state sample indeed carry over to the fully deterministic ionization process of quasi one - dimensional hydrogen rydberg states under microwave driving , where dynamical chaos substitutes disorder . in response to our first introductory question",
    ", we do observe important amendments to the solid - state picture ( which implicitly always assumes a localization length much larger than the typical distance between neighbouring lattice sites ) imported to the atomic realm by photonic localization theory .",
    "these amendments directly originate  via the atomic sample size @xmath15 , equation  ( [ samplelength ] )  in the finite size of @xmath36 . however , they do neither affect the monotonous decrease of the mean atomic conductance with the inverse of the localization parameter ( figure  [ fig4 ] ) , nor the large - scale fluctuations of @xmath30 , for different realizations of @xmath25 .    a rough estimate allows an answer to our second question : figures [ fig9][fig11 ] suggest that the transition from localized to diffusive transport sets in at @xmath104 .",
    "furthermore , we have seen that deviations from the exponential dependence of @xmath82 on @xmath83 get manifest for @xmath105 .",
    "considering the monotonous decrease of @xmath106 with decreasing @xmath25 ( figure [ fig4 ] ) as the most robust signature of localization , we therefore require that the minimum value of @xmath26 permits localization lengths @xmath107 at @xmath108 . by virtue of ( [ locallength]-[lparameter ] ) , this implies @xmath109 ( with @xmath110 ) , and is consistent with earlier numerical results @xcite for smaller values of @xmath111 . on the other hand , however , the exponentially enhanced fluctuations of the atomic conductance , as the actual , quantitative fingerprint of anderson localization in our driven atomic system , do fully prevail only for @xmath112 ( figures  [ fig5]-[fig9 ] , see also @xcite ) .",
    "the reply to our third question directly follows from our discussion of figure  [ fig11 ] above , which suggests a smooth transition from lognormally distributed atomic conductances for sufficiently large localization lengths and principal quantum numbers , to more coarse - grained distributions with larger variances .",
    "taking into account the perturbative coupling limit defined by small values of @xmath113 , it should be possible to derive an approximate analytical expression for the general behaviour of @xmath33 with @xmath100 .    finally , we verified that the fluctuations displayed in figure  [ fig3 ] remain essentially unaffected if we average over a finite window of @xmath27 ( and , hence , of @xmath25 ) , at any given value of @xmath28 .",
    "we assumed a relative error of @xmath114 in the experimental calibration of the field amplitude experienced by the atoms , which is state of the art in laboratory experiments @xcite .",
    "therefore , exponentially large fluctuations of the atomic conductance in the localized regime should be observable via measurements of the ionization yield at sufficiently short interaction times ( see figures  [ fig1 ] and [ fig3 ] ) .",
    "importantly , such experiments must be performed _ below _ the ionization ( i.e. , delocalization ) threshold , as immediately apparent from figure  [ fig1 ] . since , so far , most experimental evidence in support of dynamical localization in periodically driven atoms is based on measurements of the ionization threshold @xcite , which does nt prove more than a monotonous decrease of the average conductance with decreasing @xmath25 , the crucial experimental test of anderson localization in driven atomic systems is yet to be performed .",
