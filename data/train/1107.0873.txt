    "<S> two - particle correlation triggered by high- particles allows us to study hard scattering phenomena when full jet reconstruction is challenging . </S>",
    "<S> an analysis of the first alice pp data where charged and neutral particles isolated or not are used as trigger particles is presented . the two - particle correlation between the trigger ( @xmath0 ) and the associate ( @xmath1 ) particles </S>",
    "<S> is studied as a function of the imbalance parameter @xmath2=-@xmath3 and interpreted in terms of jet fragmentation function .    </S>",
    "<S> two - particle correlation measurements provide a suitable tool to study the jet properties in proton - proton and heavy - ion collisions  @xcite where the full jet reconstruction is challenging and even impossible for jet- below about 50  gev / c . </S>",
    "<S> such a measurement can be further improved if the trigger particle is isolated . ultimately , selecting a direct photon as the trigger particle would provide the optimum choice since the direct photon sets the reference of the @xmath4 type of hard scattering kinematics and balances the jet emitted in the opposite azimuthal direction . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , while purely hadronic observables are strongly biased with respect to surface emission , photons can sample the entire collision volume . </S>",
    "<S> however , identifying direct photons is quite challenging because of their scarcity and the overwhelming contribution of hadron decay - photons , mainly from @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> applying isolation criteria ( select trigger particles spatially isolated ) is the traditional approach to enrich the data sample with hadrons sampling a large fraction of the parton momentum from which they fragment .    </S>",
    "<S> we have studied the two - particle correlation with the alice experiment  @xcite at lhc in proton - proton collisions at @xmath6@xmath7  tev . </S>",
    "<S> the experimental technique consists in tagging events with a leading trigger and measuring the distribution of charged hadrons associated to this leading trigger from the same event . </S>",
    "<S> such a measurement requires to reconstruct charged tracks and identify neutral particles with good momentum / energy resolution . in alice , the electromagnetic calorimeters , phos </S>",
    "<S> ( @xmath8 and @xmath9 = 100@xmath10 ) and emcal ( @xmath11 and @xmath12 = 100@xmath10 ) , allow us to measure and identify photons and neutral mesons with high efficiency and resolution . </S>",
    "<S> particles in the calorimeters are detected as clusters of adjacent hit calorimeter cells . </S>",
    "<S> the central tracking system ( its and tpc ) , covering the pseudo - rapidity @xmath13 and the full azimuth  @xcite , is used for charged track measurements , and contributes to the single particle jet events identification by applying the isolation technique . </S>",
    "<S> two different types of trigger particle have been selected for the correlation study : ( i ) charged triggers are selected as the charged track with the highest transverse momentum among all the tracks in the event , ( ii ) neutral cluster triggers are defined as the calorimeter cluster with the highest energy among all detected clusters and among all the charged tracks detected in the same trigger hemisphere . at this early stage of the analysis , </S>",
    "<S> no particle identification has been applied yet on the calorimeters data , thus the cluster sample may contain a sizable fraction of charged particles which develop a shower in the calorimeters or high-@xmath14 @xmath15 from which two decay photons merge into a single cluster . </S>",
    "<S> a monte - carlo study based on the pythia  @xcite event generator indicates that the dominant contribution to the selected neutral cluster triggers is due to merged  @xmath5 in the region which could be statistically reached with the data available for our study . </S>",
    "<S> the results which will be discussed are the azimuthal correlation between the two particles , and the per - trigger conditional yield of charged hadrons as a function of the imbalance variable @xmath2= -@xmath16 , where @xmath17 denote the amplitude of the transverse momenta of the trigger and associate particle , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the azimuthal correlation ( @xmath18 ) between the trigger particle and the associate particles with transverse momentum threshold of  @xmath19gev/@xmath20 and @xmath21 for different trigger bins is shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : clusterdphi ] . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting distribution is finally corrected for the two - particle pair efficiency . </S>",
    "<S> the structure of the azimuthal correlations show consistent results independent on the trigger type and of the calorimeter for the cluster triggers ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : clusterdphi ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the main feature of these distributions is the typical 2-jets structure with a near side ( @xmath22 ) and away side ( @xmath23 ) peak . </S>",
    "<S> the peaks become stronger when the trigger- increases reflecting the increasing multiplicity of fragmented hadrons for increasing jet energies ( on average the leading particle of a jet carries about 50% of its energy at lhc energy regime ) . </S>",
    "<S> the 2-jet structure sits on top of a flat background which originates from the correlation of the trigger particle with particles from the underlying event ( all particles which do not originate from a hard scattering process ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the per - trigger conditional yield as a function of the variable @xmath2is used to study the away side jet fragmentation function . </S>",
    "<S> the accuracy of this description depends on how well the trigger particle momentum approximates the jet momentum . </S>",
    "<S> the measured @xmath2distribution contains contributions from away side jet fragmentation signal as well as background . to estimate this background </S>",
    "<S> , one assumes that the associate particles distribution from underlying events is isotropic in the full azimuth angle . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the background level can be calculated from the transverse azimuthal region where the jet signal is minimum . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting @xmath2signal distributions after underlying event background subtraction for different bins exhibits remarkable uniformity of the slope . in order </S>",
    "<S> to quantity this feature , an exponential function ( dn / d@xmath2@xmath24 ) is fitted to the @xmath2distribution in the range @xmath25 @xmath2  @xmath26 , the fitting parameter @xmath27 stands for the inverse @xmath2  slope . figure  [ fig : xeslope ] shows the evolution of the inverse @xmath2  slope as a function of the mean trigger obtained from alice data . </S>",
    "<S> the slopes extracted using charged and neutral triggers approach to each other with rising . </S>",
    "<S> this behavior is expected as high cluster triggers are mainly merged @xmath5while low clusters are dominated by single decay photon clusters from @xmath5 </S>",
    "<S> .    slope as a function of the mean trigger   for charged and neutral triggers in pp collisions at @xmath6  = 7 tev.__,scaledwidth=90.0% ]    slope as a function of the mean trigger   for charged and neutral triggers in pp collisions at @xmath6  = 7 tev.__,scaledwidth=90.0% ]    similar measurements performed at phenix  @xcite conclude that the @xmath2distribution is not sensitive to the away side jet fragmentation function because the trigger particle carries only a small fraction of the full jet energy (  = @xmath28 ) . </S>",
    "<S> this conclusion is confirmed by our measurement where the measured inverse slope is in the region where one expects ( yellow band ) the @xmath2  slope when the trigger particle samples the jet momentum at  @xmath29 . </S>",
    "<S> the next step of the analysis consists in selecting isolated trigger with the goal to enrich the trigger sample with single hadron jet events or direct photon (  @xmath30 ) . to select isolated particles , </S>",
    "<S> one studies the charged hadronic activity around the trigger candidate , i.e. , calculating the sum of the transverse momentum of all charged hadrons inside a cone with radius @xmath31 rad around the trigger candidate and tags the trigger to be isolated if the sum is less than 10  % of the trigger s transverse momentum . </S>",
    "<S> the azimuthal correlation obtained with an isolated trigger ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : ictrigdphi ] ) , compared to the one without isolation , shows an apparent single jet structure with , by construction , the absence of the near side peak whereas the away side peak remains present . </S>",
    "<S> the slight difference in the away side peak intensity before and after isolation can be explained by a bias which is different in the case with and without isolation . from a monte - carlo study based on the pythia event generator </S>",
    "<S> we have demonstrated that non - isolated triggers carry on average 50% of the jet energy while isolated triggers carry on average 80% of the jet energy . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , for the same trigger , the isolated one will sample a lower energy jet compared to the non - isolated trigger . the resulting inverse @xmath2  slope parameter @xmath27 obtained by the exponential fitting for the non - isolated and isolated triggers </S>",
    "<S> are presented in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : icslope ] as a function of the trigger transverse momentum . </S>",
    "<S> one observes that the @xmath27-value is generally higher for the isolated triggers than for the non - isolated triggers . </S>",
    "<S> the data points are also compared with prediction of a simple fragmentation model based on parent - child relation  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the slope approaches the region where one expects @xmath27 to represent the slope of the true fragmentation function for quarks and gluons ( blue band defined by  @xmath32 ) .    </S>",
    "<S> slope as a function of the mean trigger   for non - isolated and isolated charge triggers in pp collisions at @xmath6  = 7 tev.__,scaledwidth=85.0% ]    slope as a function of the mean trigger   for non - isolated and isolated charge triggers in pp collisions at @xmath6  = 7 tev.__,scaledwidth=85.0% ]    the results demonstrated that two particle correlation is a suitable tool to study jet properties , where two particle correlations show a di - jet structure and the isolated trigger - hadron correlations make a better description of the away side jet fragmentation . </S>",
    "<S> the future study will focus on the identified particle correlations which has potential to distinguish the quark jets ( direct photon trigger ) and gluon jets ( @xmath5trigger ) . </S>"
