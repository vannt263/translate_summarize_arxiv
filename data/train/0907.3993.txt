    "the design of dynamical systems in which the motion is both aperiodic and stable has been an objective of a number of recent studies @xcite .",
    "one realization of this goal is in strange nonchaotic attractors ( snas ) that can be created in quasi  periodically driven systems @xcite . in such systems which have been known for over twenty years now @xcite",
    ", the attractor has a fractal geometry , and this results in the dynamics being aperiodic .",
    "the lyapunov exponents of the drive system are nonpositive : this lead to a lack of sensitivity to initial conditions , and thus to the synchronization of orbits @xcite .",
    "achieving quasiperiodicity is simple in principle , but difficult in practice .",
    "quasiperiodic modulation requires that the system be driven either through a single source that has an irrational frequency ( for maps ) , or with two sources whose frequencies are incommensurate ( for flows ) .",
    "experimental uncertainties are usually larger than the precision with which rational or irrational numbers can be measured , and therefore finding or creating snas in practical situations has proved to be difficult , except for isolated experiments @xcite . if strange nonchaotic dynamics is to be taken seriously , it is necessary to ask if such behaviour can arise in the absence of strict quasiperiodicity . in particular , most physical , biological and engineering systems will not be quasiperiodic , so it is natural to ask whether snas can arise in situations where the underlying system is autonomous , or has other time dependence .",
    "earlier studies have addressed this issue @xcite with varying degrees of success .",
    "the use of an external noise source typically has the effect of smearing out attractor structure and gives effective lyapunov exponents that are nonnegative . as a result the dynamics",
    "is neither truly strange nor truly nonchaotic @xcite .",
    "the recent suggestion by wang @xcite , that additive noise alone can be used to induce robust snas in both maps and flows appears to ensure that the attractors so created share the mathematical properties of snas formed by other bifurcation routes @xcite .",
    "the approach taken in the present paper pursues a different route .",
    "we show that by using parametric modulation based on deterministic pseudorandom dynamics , it is possible to create dynamical attractors that are stable , nonchaotic and aperiodic , and which will appear strange on any measurable timescale . in this context",
    "the term ` strangeness ' refers purely to the geometry , while stability refers to the fidelity in signal reproduction or tracking @xcite , an issue that , for instance , underlies schemes for encryption and communication .",
    "our procedure for the creation of such aperiodic nonchaotic attractors ( anas ) relies on the use of binary random numbers to modulate the dynamical system between two dynamical states , a stable fixed point and a chaotic attractor . by suitably designing the drive dynamics ,",
    "it is possible to ensure that the asymptotic dynamics of the driven system has ( a ) a negative largest lyapunov exponent , and ( b ) nontrivial and complicated geometry on spatial scales that are determined by the ( essentially ) experimental resolution .",
    "we show that such attractors can be created in both discrete - time autonomous maps as well as flows , and further present an experiment based on electronic circuits to support our findings .",
    "this suggests that anas could have potential application in practical situations where aperiodic dynamics is desirable , as for example in chaotic communications . at the same time , these attractors have differences from those created by quasiperiodic driving and other methods @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that dichotomous driving has been used before in both numerical @xcite as well as experimental @xcite studies , although the motivation there was to study noise  induced transitions between different states or attractors .    in the following section we discuss the design of anas in the driven hnon map and the driven lorenz system using a deterministic feedback shift",
    "register to generate a pseudorandom drive @xcite . in sec",
    "[ sec - cs ] we discuss similar driving mechanism using chaotic sequence from a chua circuit .",
    "the study of such attractors and their proper characterization is discussed in sec  [ sec - char ] , where we show the geometric differences between anas and comparable snas . in sec  [ sec - exp ]",
    "we present an experimental realization of such attractors using electronic circuits , and conclude in sec  [ sec - dis ] with a discussion and summary of our results .",
    "consider a dynamical system ( with one freedom and a single parameter for simplicity , but with obvious extension to higher dimensions and to the case of several parameters ) [ drive - scheme ] x f(x , b ) , that is modulated through the output of a binary drive sequence ( strings of 0 s and 1 s ) @xmath0 as [ xeq ] x_n+1 = f(x_n , b_1+z_n(b_2-b_1 ) ) .",
    "depending on the value of @xmath1 , the system parameters thus switch between @xmath2 and @xmath3 , giving a dichotomous modulation that is , nevertheless , deterministic .",
    "one standard way of achieving this is to use a linear feedback shift register ( lfsr)@xcite that generates a pseudo - random bit sequence @xmath4 through a delay mapping of the general form [ lfsr ] z_n+1 = _ i=1^n a_iz_n+1-i  , where @xmath5 is also a binary variable . for a specific choice of nonzero @xmath5 s for a given @xmath6 ( the  tap sequence \" ) ,",
    "the dynamics is on an attractor with period @xmath7 - 1 .",
    "the analog generalization ( namely , the analog feedback shift registers ( afsr ) ) @xcite uses the same coefficients in a continuous mapping [ afsr ] z_n+1 = - _",
    "i=1^n a_iz_n+1-i , to generate a pseudorandom sequence of 0 s and 1 s .",
    "this dichotomous drive is , importantly , a dynamical system and the drive sequence is an _ attractor _ of the dynamics .",
    "the sequence is optimal if arbitrarily long sequences of either 0 or 1 occur .",
    "the theory of lfsrs ( and thus of afsrs ) is well - developed and minimal tap sequences that produce the longest possible ( namely 2@xmath8 - 1 ) period pseudorandom sequences are easily available @xcite . for sufficiently large @xmath6",
    ", the period of the pseudorandom sequence can quickly exceed the age of the universe at any realistic sampling rate .",
    "designing aperiodic but nonchaotic dynamics in @xmath9 is straightforward : for instance if @xmath2 corresponds to a case of , say , superstable dynamics , and @xmath3 to the case of chaotic dynamics in the system ( eq .",
    "[ xeq ] ) , the resultant dynamics in the driven system will be aperiodic but will rapidly be attracted to the superstable orbit whenever there is a `` gap '' , namely a string of 0 s",
    ". the lyapunov exponent will consequently be negative and as a result trajectories with arbitrary initial conditions will synchronize .",
    "special attention should be given when choosing the tap sequence @xmath6 .",
    "it must be large enough such that the recurrence time , namely @xmath10 is much longer than the time - scales used for simulations . for smaller @xmath6 ,",
    "the recurrence also become short , and since the afsr dynamics is periodic , the system dynamics will go to a periodic attractor .    any other random sequence will also serve the purpose , but lfsrs or afsrs offer a practical advantage over other pseudo random number generators ( prngs ) .",
    "the shift registers are maximally stable @xcite : being attractors of the dynamics their stability and controllability  unlike that of stochastic sequences or prngs  is more easily ensured .",
    "furthermore , since feedback shift registers are dynamical systems as well , the entire drive ",
    "response system can be represented as a delay dynamical system .",
    "we discuss representative examples below .",
    "the hnon map @xcite is a well studied two dimensional iterative dynamical system , given by the following equations [ hen1 ] x_n+1 & = & 1 + x_n^2 + y_n , + y_n+1 & = & x_n .",
    "[ hen2 ] for certain choice of @xmath11 and for a certain range of initial condition , the system exhibits chaotic or fixed point or periodic behaviour ( see fig .  [",
    "fig1]a ) .    applying",
    "the strategy discussed above produces attractors which are both nonchaotic and essentially strange . in the hnon map , at @xmath12 the dynamics",
    "is chaotic and at @xmath13 the dynamics goes to a fixed point ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1]a ) . combining eq .",
    "( [ afsr ] ) and eqs .",
    "( [ hen1]-[hen2 ] ) , we get the following equations for the drive  response system @xmath14 . \\label{henafsr2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] if we choose @xmath13 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 , then depending on whether @xmath1 is @xmath17 or @xmath18 , the quantity @xmath19 will take values of either @xmath20 or @xmath21 . as a result",
    "the dynamics hops between two different states such that the global dynamics is stable and nonchaotic .",
    "the lyapunov exponent for the global dynamics is given by @xmath22 .",
    "[ fig1](b ) shows the attractor in phase space .",
    "clearly the attractor looks geometrically strange ; the dynamics is aperiodic and nonchaotic .",
    "the same strategy can be applied to a flow : switching the dynamics between a fixed - point or limit  cycle and a chaotic attractor can result in such strange dynamics in a modulated lorenz system @xcite , @xmath23 which has the parameter @xmath24 changing in a time ",
    "dependent manner through the variable @xmath25 , [ zeta ] ( t)=z_n  nt ( n-1 ) . as in the mapping in sec  [ henon ] above , @xmath0 is the output of an afsr ( eq .  [ afsr ] ) and the switch duration @xmath26 is an additional parameter in the problem : it is the time for which a trajectory is switched into either of the states . in the present problem",
    "we have taken @xmath26 to switch into either of the states to be equal , but one can choose mismatched @xmath26 s .    the attractor shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] is the result of the dynamics hopping between parameter values @xmath27 and @xmath28 . at the latter value",
    "the attractor is chaotic with the characteristic butterfly structure about two symmetric unstable fixed points @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "for @xmath27 the system has two symmetrical attractive fixed points at @xmath31 and @xmath32 . when the parameter switches between the values , the dynamics alternates between the stable and the unstable fixed point dynamics , resulting in the structure visible in fig .",
    "a sequence generated from a chaotic signal can also generate aperiodic nonchaotic dynamics .",
    "for instance , consider the chua oscillator @xcite which is described by the following sets of equations @xmath33 where @xmath34 is given by , @xmath35    for certain choice of the parameter @xmath36 , a chaotic `` double scroll '' attractor is obtained ( see fig .  [ fig3]a ) .",
    "we extract an indicator sequence of binary numbers from this chaotic attractor ( see fig .  [",
    "fig3]b ) using the prescription that whenever the trajectory is on the left ( resp .",
    "right ) scroll , the indicator sequence is taken as 1 ( resp . 0 ) .",
    "this gives a drive signal which is piecewise constant , which upon application to the lorenz system discussed in sec  [ l - s ] yields an attractor ( see fig .  [ fig4 ] ) that is very similar to that obtained via deterministic dichotomous driving .",
    "the main feature that both these drive signals share is that they have long periods when the drive is on the stable attractor , and this suffices to ensure that the eventual dynamics is aperiodic , and that the attractor has a complicated geometry and a nonpositive largest lyapunov exponent .    in the following section ,",
    "we characterize these attractors via measures used in the study of snas .",
    "computation of the largest lyapunov exponent shows that these attractors are nonchaotic . however , since the attractors are geometrically strange only over finite resolution , they differ in the qualitative and quantitative aspects of their local fluctuation properties @xcite from other similar attractors such as snas .    finite  time lyapunov exponents ( ftles ) @xcite are local estimates for the rate of divergence between nearby trajectories , and",
    "explicitly depend both on the time interval @xmath26 over which they are measured as well as the initial conditions . by computing @xmath37 for a large number of initial points in the phase space , one can obtain the stationary distribution , p ( , )",
    "& = & _ + & & ( , + d ) . for snas",
    "this is typically broad and non - gaussian @xcite , although the mean of the distribution , namely the asymptotic lyapunov exponent , is negative .",
    "the ftle distribution for anas is purely gaussian : see figs .",
    "[ fig5]((a ) and ( b ) ) for the driven hnon and lorenz systems .",
    "this follows from the pseudo - random nature of the driving which switches the dynamics between a regular and a chaotic state .",
    "correlations die out rapidly and the ftles satisfy the central limit theorem . as a result",
    "the distribution is a gaussian whose spread is a function of the length of the trajectory @xcite .",
    "the contrast between anas and snas is also evident in the fourier spectrum @xcite . upon computing the time - dependent partial fourier sum @xcite [ spectra ] x(,n )",
    "n=1^n x_n^i2n , at irrational frequency @xmath38 the golden mean ratio , @xmath39 , the scaling relation @xmath40 is observed . for noisy motion , @xmath41 , and",
    "the spectrum is continuous . for periodic motion @xmath42 and",
    "the spectrum is discrete . for singular continuous spectrum ( as in snas @xcite ) the scaling exponent satisfies @xmath43 @xcite .",
    "here we find that the fourier sum obeys scaling , with an exponent slightly greater than unity ; see figs .",
    "[ fig6]((a ) and ( b ) ) .",
    "this implies that the dynamics in these attractors is typically noisy unlike snas where the dynamical correlation persists over long times due to intermittency . for nonchaotic attractors in the hnon and the lorenz systems",
    ", we find the exponents @xmath44 and @xmath45 respectively .",
    "[ fig6]((c ) and ( d ) ) shows the respective spectral trajectories in the complex plane ( re @xmath46,im @xmath46 ) .",
    "a detailed characterization of the nature of dynamics can be obtained from measures based on recurrences @xcite .",
    "recurrence plots ( rps ) are defined for a given trajectory @xmath47 through the matrix @xmath48 where @xmath49 is a predefined threshold , @xmath50 the heaviside function and @xmath51 the maximum norm . the maximum norm ( also called infinity norm ) of a vector @xmath52 of length @xmath6",

    "then , the values `` 1 '' and `` 0 '' are depicted as black and white dot in a two  dimensional plot , providing a visual representation of the system dynamics . the rps exhibit characteristic large scale and small scale patterns ( called _ typology _ and _ texture _ respectively ) ; these have been comprehensively reviewed recently @xcite .",
    "the selection criteria for the threshold @xmath49 is discussed in details in a review by marwan @xcite . here",
    "we take @xmath49 in units of the standard deviation @xmath55 of the trajectory .    in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] , we compare the rps for a sna in the quasiperiodically forced henon map @xcite and the ana for the modulated hnon map .",
    "it is clear that the rp of ana ( fig .",
    "[ fig7](b),(d ) ) consists of more isolated correlated points and short diagonal segments depicting short - range correlations . on the other hand , the rp for sna ( fig .",
    "[ fig7](a),(c ) ) has a larger distribution of longer diagonal line segments implying that correlation persists over long times  a signature of quasiperiodic driving .",
    "in the electronic experiments reported here we have designed a circuit that essentially obeys the lorenz equations @xcite and permits one of the parameters to be switched between two values .",
    "the typical parameters for the butterfly attractor are @xmath56 , @xmath57 and in our circuit the value of @xmath24 may be switched between 28 and 7 ( as in fig .  [ fig4 ] ) .",
    "the switching of @xmath24 is controlled by a chaotic pulse generated from a chua circuit @xcite : @xmath24 = 28 if the drive signal has value 1 , else @xmath24= 7 ( and the drive signal has the value 0 ) .",
    "the experimental circuit of the pulse driven lorenz oscillator is shown in fig .",
    "a chua circuit is designed using two op - amps ( u1-u2 : @xmath58741 ) , capacitors c1 and c2 , inductor l1 with a leakage resistance r8 and other resistances r1-r7 .",
    "it generates a chaotic double scroll for choice components noted in the circuit diagram .",
    "the dynamics of the chua circuit can be controlled by varying r1 resistance keeping other components fixed . the double - scroll chaos from the chua circuit",
    "is then applied to a schmitt trigger circuit designed by using op - amp u3 , an inverting amplifier u4 and associated resistances r9-r13 .",
    "the output from u3 and u4 are used to control the analog switches u5a and u6a respectively to allow continuity of either r16 or r17 in the lorenz circuit .",
    "the lorenz circuit is implemented using two analog multipliers u7-u8 , and three op - amps ( u9-u11 : @xmath58741 ) , capacitors c3-c5 and resistances r14-r21 . the choice of resistances r16 and r17 made the selection of @xmath24-value between 7 ( @xmath59 ) and 28 ( @xmath60 ) respectively .",
    "the other parameter of the lorenz circuit are decided as @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "the analog switches are in on state if their control pulse at vc terminal is positive .",
    "so the analog switch u5a is in on state when the output of u3 is positive but u6a is in off state .",
    "alternately , the analog switch u6a is in on state and u5a is in off state when the output of u3 is negative but inverted by the u4 to make the control pulse positive at the vc terminal of u6a .",

    "two identical lorenz oscillators are controlled by the chaotic pulse generated from a single chua oscillator .",
    "the components of the lorenz oscillators are carefully chosen with 1@xmath63 tolerance so that both the oscillators are almost identical .",
    "synchronization of two the nonchaotic lorenz circuit is now investigated , the circuit scheme of which is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig11 ] .",
    "we observe that the output voltage of the lorenz oscillators , os-1 and os-2 , are completely synchronized .",
    "the oscilloscope pictures of the two time series from the oscillators are shown in green and blue in fig .",
    "[ fig12 ] for comparison .",
    "the time series plotted one against the other , is shown as a thick line , confirms complete synchronization of the two oscillators ( within experimental bounds ) .",
    "the width of the synchronization manifold is due to natural parameter mismatch between the two designed lorenz oscillators ; this is unavoidable in experiments .",
    "motion that is both stable and aperiodic is ubiquitous in natural systems @xcite .",
    "the manner in which such dynamics can be created is therefore of interest .",
    "one class of attractors that have these features has been known for some time now , but a quasiperiodic drive is essential for their creation @xcite and thus these appear to be somewhat exceptional .",
    "an area where these considerations are potentially important is in the dynamics of biological systems .",
    "although not manifestly periodic , several biological phenomena are stable , at least in a homeostatic sense @xcite .",
    "thus it is a moot question whether aperiodic but nonchaotic attractors are responsible for such stability .    on snas",
    "there is a delicate balance between global stability : as was established by sturman and stark @xcite there is an unstable set embedded within the attractor .",
    "the design strategy that we have enunciated in the present work keeps this feature in mind : the scheme we have proposed here is to modulate system parameters in such a manner as to achieve global stability while ensuring local instability .",
    "this method of dichotomous modulation creates attractors which are nonchaotic and have a fractal geometry on experimentally accessible timescales .",
    "we have recently shown @xcite that snas created via quasiperiodic forcing are a manifestation of weak generalized synchronization , and that similar stable attractors can be created by chaotic forcing @xcite .",
    "the parametric modulation used in the present case retains the skew - product structure of the dynamical system .",
    "the formation of these stable attractors can in some sense be seen as an instance of generalized synchronization @xcite .",
    "the attractors created via such parameter modulation are quite distinct from snas .",
    "the gaussian nature of the ftle distribution shows that the dynamics is not intermittent . from the spectral properties",
    "it is evident that unlike snas , the power spectrum varies as @xmath64 , which occurs when the motion is random or chaotic .",
    "our system being nonchaotic , the randomness in the motion comes from the stochastic nature of the modulation .",
    "this is confirmed by looking at the correlation properties via recurrence plots , which shows similiar behaviour to that of random or chaotic dynamics .",
    "the aperiodic nonchaotic attractors can be realized in an experimental setup . as an example , we construct an electronic circuit experiment wherein a chua double scroll attractor is used to drive a lorenz attractor .",
    "the experiment closely matches the simulation result , and by experimentally constructing an auxiliary system @xcite we demonstrate that for a given drive sequence , trajectories with different initial states synchronize rapidly on the anas .",
    "this demonstrates the possibility of creating  or using  such dynamics in practical applications @xcite .",
    "furthermore such a realization shows the robustness of the proposed design scheme against external noise ."
