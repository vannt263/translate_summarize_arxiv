    "the precise determination of the main physical parameters of galactic open clusters plays a central role in the study of the stellar structure and evolution . with accurate photometric data , and",
    "once the external variables such as reddening are corrected for , the cluster distances , ages and chemical abundances can be inferred from the study of the photometric colour - magnitude and colour - colour diagrams .",
    "this work is part of a programme aimed to produce accurate and homogeneous dating for a sample of young galactic clusters by means of ccd strmgren @xmath0 photometry .",
    "the use of isochrone fitting in the @xmath6 plane of the @xmath7 photometric system is an adequate tool to obtain accurate cluster ages .",
    "the range of variation of the @xmath8 index along the b - type sequence amounts to more than one mag .",
    ", being significantly larger than most commonly used photometric colours",
    ". moreover , the @xmath8 index is less affected by reddening , and allows an efficient segregation of emission - line stars .",
    "ngc 663 is a moderately rich open cluster in cassiopeia , located in the perseus galactic arm .",
    "it is thought to be the core of the cas ob8 association .",
    "a remarkable characteristic is that it contains one of the largest fractions of be stars among all galactic clusters .",
    "more than 30 be stars have been detected so far among its b star sequence , and at least 30 per cent of all early b cluster members are known to be be stars @xcite .",
    "the accurate age determination of clusters with a high be star content is a key element of the on - going discussion about the evolutionary status of be stars .",
    "@xcite proposed that the be phenomenon is an evolutionary effect which appears at the end of the b stars main sequence lifetime .",
    "the main argument in favour of this hypothesis is their preliminary finding , based on an inhomogeneous set of age determinations from the literature , that clusters with high be star content have ages in the interval 1325 myr , while no  or very few  be stars are found in clusters younger than 10 myr .",
    "hence , the accurate determination of the age of ngc 663 is an important issue in this discussion .",
    "ngc 663 has been the subject of many photometric studies in the past .",
    "photoelectric @xmath9 photometry was obtained by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "strmgren @xmath7 and crawford ",
    "barnes h@xmath10 photometry was presented by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the former also obtained infrared @xmath11 photometry .",
    "recent studies based on ccd photometry in the johnson @xmath9 and cousins @xmath12 systems include those of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "photometric h@xmath13 surveys aimed to detect new be stars have been conducted by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the cluster physical parameters determined in the above studies show an important dispersion . a reason for this could be the strongly variable reddening across the cluster area ( e.g. @xcite ) which makes the determination of the intrinsic magnitudes and colours more difficult .",
    "the published distance moduli range from 11.4 mag .",
    "( 1.9 kpc , @xcite ) to 12.25 mag .",
    "( 2.8 kpc , @xcite ) .",
    "the determined ages range from 9 myr .",
    "@xcite to 2025 myr .",
    "@xcite .    in this work we present ccd @xmath0 photometry for stars in the central area of ngc 663 and a precise determination of the cluster main physical parameters .",
    "a detailed study of the cluster be star population will be presented in a forthcoming paper .",
    "ccd photometry of ngc 663 was obtained on the nights 20 to 22 november 1998 at the 1.52-m .",
    "telescope of the observatorio astronmico nacional , located at the calar alto observatory ( almera , spain ) .",
    "the chip employed was the tektronics tk 1024 ab , with a size of 1024x1024 pixels .",
    "the 04 unbinned pixels provide a field size of 69x69 .",
    "two slightly overlapping fields near the cluster centre were observed to cover the cluster central region .",
    "observations were done through the four strmgren @xmath7 and crawford narrow and wide h@xmath10 filters , every field being sequentially measured through the six filters .",
    "three different exposure times were used with each filter , in order to ensure a wide range of stellar magnitudes .",
    "exposure times in each filter were selected so that a b type star produces approximately equal count rates through all filters .",
    "employed exposure times are presented in table [ t1 ] .",
    "the list of all observations is presented in table [ t2 ] .",
    ".exposure times with the different filters used , in seconds . [ cols=\"<,>,>,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     in fig .",
    "[ f4 ] we present the intrinsic @xmath6 diagram for b stars .",
    "each star has been dereddened on the basis of its position within fig .",
    "[ f3 ] , and using the reddening values in table [ t6 ] . to obtain the distance we have fitted to the @xmath6 diagram the zams as presented in table vi of @xcite .",
    "we found the best fitting at a distance modulus of 11.6 mag . to estimate the error of this determination we have also represented in fig .",
    "[ f4 ] , as dotted lines , the zams shifted by distance moduli of 11.4 and 11.8 respectively .",
    "we find that the 11.6 value produces a distinctly better fitting than the two latter ones , and hence we give the value of @xmath14 mag . as the distance modulus of ngc 663 .",
    "this value is in good agreement with the recent determinations based on ccd photometry .",
    "age determination has been done by isochrone fitting to the upper main sequence . in the @xmath7 system , for early - type stars",
    "the @xmath15 colour and the @xmath8 index are temperature indicators , and hence both @xmath16 and @xmath6 planes are observational hr diagrams . following the discussion in @xcite we consider the isochrone fitting to the @xmath6 diagram as more precise and reliable , for the following reasons : i./ the range of variation of the @xmath8 index along the b - type sequence is more than ten times larger than the range of variation of @xmath15 , providing much better discrimination between isochrones of similar ages ; ii./",
    "the @xmath8 index is less affected , by a factor of 5 , by interstellar reddening ; iii./ the @xmath6 plane allows an efficient segregation of emission line stars .    as a first approach , in fig .",
    "[ f5 ] we compare the b star sequence of ngc 663 in the @xmath6 plane with that of @xmath17 and @xmath18 persei .",
    "photometric data for @xmath17 and @xmath18 per have been obtained from cf02 .",
    "the turn - off of both sequences are clearly seen , and from them it is apparent that ngc 663 is significantly older than @xmath17 and @xmath19 persei .",
    "five ngc 663 stars are distinctly outside the cluster sequence .",
    "star w4 lies at the left of the cluster turn - off , close to the zams , and it is hence a cluster blue straggler .",
    "its spectral type , derived from its @xmath20 index , is b1v .",
    "this star is also a @xmath10 cephei pulsating variable @xcite .",
    "its position in the photometric diagram is close to w161 , another main sequence blue straggler already noted by @xcite , but outside the field observed in this study .",
    "the other four stars are in an horizontal sequence with @xmath21 between @xmath226 and @xmath225 magnitudes .",
    "they are stars w40 ( bd + 60 343 ) , w44 ( bd + 60 339 ) , w54 ( bd + 60 333 ) and w86 ( bd + 60 331 ) .",
    "all of them are supergiants .",
    "they will not be considered for isochrone fitting in the @xmath23 plane since the @xmath8 index defines different effective temperature scales for main sequence and supergiant stars . in cf02",
    "there is a detailed discussion on this subject .    in fig .",
    "[ f6 ] we present the @xmath6 sequence together with isochrones with ages of @xmath24 7.3 , 7.4 and 7.5 years .",
    "the isochrones have been computed with the evolutionary models of @xcite , and transformed to the observational plane by means of the relations obtained by @xcite .",
    "practically all stars at the cluster turn - off lie between the @xmath24 7.4 and 7.5 isochrones .",
    "most stars are located on the 7.5 isochrone , but a significant number , 5 stars , are at the left , making the 7.4 isochrone better for defining the lower envelope of the stellar sequence .    in order to use the supergiant stars to further restrain the age determination , in fig .",
    "[ f7 ] we present the @xmath16 photometric diagram .",
    "@xmath25 is a measure of the paschen continuum slope , which is correlated with effective temperature for stars of all luminosity classes . in this plane",
    "the four supergiants are closer to the @xmath24 7.4 years isochrone than to the 7.5 one .",
    "their positions even suggest a still younger age .",
    "however , for the reasons discussed above , the error in the position of a star in the @xmath26 plane is likely to be affected by much bigger errors , and hence we give a higher weight to the age determination through the @xmath6 plane .    from all this discussion we finally adopt an age of @xmath27 years ( @xmath5 myr ) .",
    "the quoted error is higher than the one we estimated in our age determination of the @xmath17 and @xmath18 persei clusters in cf02 .",
    "the reason for this is the more variable and clumpy nature of the interstellar reddening in the ngc 663 field , which makes the reddening determination more imprecise and the sequences in the intrinsic photometric planes more disperse .",
    "@xcite proposed that the be phenomenon is an evolutionary effect , appearing at the end of the main sequence lifetime of a be star .",
    "they based their conclusion in the analysis of the frequency of be stars in clusters of different ages .",
    "they found that in clusters younger than 10 myr be stars are lacking or very scarce .",
    "the maximum be star frequency occurs in clusters in the 1325 myr age interval .",
    "the main sequence lifetime of a b2 star ",
    "the subtype in which the be star frequency reach its maximum  is 26 myr .",
    "the lack of be stars in the youngest clusters indicates that a be star can not be a young object , but an object close to the end of its life in the main sequence .",
    "however , the above results were drawn from inhomogeneous sets of data from the literature .",
    "in particular , published ages are often affected by important uncertainties .",
    "the accurate and homogeneous dating of young open clusters with different be star content is hence a key issue to check the evolutionary hypothesis for the be phenomenon .",
    "the obtained age and associated error safely exclude an age lower than 10 myr , and places ngc 663 in the age interval ( 1325 myr ) where the maximum be star frequency occurs .",
    "a similar result was obtained in cf02 for the clusters @xmath17 and @xmath18 persei , which also have a high be star content . on the other hand , in a recent paper , @xcite failed to find any be star in the younger cluster trumpler 24 .",
    "the results of this work , together with the two referred to above , are pieces of evidence supporting the view that the be star phenomenon is an evolutionary effect appearing at the second half of the main sequence lifetime of a b star .",
    "we have presented ccd @xmath0 photometry for stars in the central area of ngc 663 .",
    "we have obtained the cluster astrophysical parameters from the analysis of the b type star range .",
    "the reddening is highly variable , with values ranging from @xmath28 in the central part to @xmath2 in the south - east .",
    "the distance modulus is found to be 11.6@xmath290.1 mag .",
    "( 2.1 kpc ) , and the age @xmath27 years ( @xmath5 myr ) .    a detailed analysis of the be star population of ngc 663 ,",
    "the distribution of be stars along the main sequence and their frequency as a function of the spectral subtype will be presented in a forthcoming paper .",
