    "quantum statistics is an important aspect of quantum mechanics and it lays down the rules for identifying different classes of particles . in three dimensions , the exchange of two particles in a quantum system can result in a phase change of either 0 or @xmath6 for the wave function , leading to bosons and fermions .",
    "the scenario is very different in two - dimensions ( 2d ) and it is well known that such quantum systems give rise to anyonic quasiparticle excitations.@xcite these anyons are observed as excitations , localized disturbances of the ground state in systems with topological order .",
    "rich behavior emerges especially for non - abelian anyons , for which the exchange of two anyons is described by a unitary matrix.@xcite    models of interacting non - abelian anyons draw motivation from quantum spin models , and in particular the heisenberg model , which has been studied for a wide range of lattices including one - dimension ( 1d ) chains and ladders of @xmath2 spins .",

    "this has generated interest since it can be used for topological fault - tolerant quantum computation.@xcite    interactions between non - abelian anyons can be modeled by generalizations of the spin-1/2 heisenberg model .",

    "the structure of the rest of the paper is as follows : section  [ model ] begins with a brief introduction of non - abelian anyons and introduces our model . in section  [ isolated_rungs ] , we discuss the strong rung coupling limit drawing analogy with the spin ladder models , listing out all the possible quantum states and the phase diagram for the model under study . in section [ coupled_rungs ] , we list all the phases that arise for weakly coupled rungs .",
    "the subsequent sections are dedicated to the discussion of all these phases .",
    "section [ sec : effpaired ] discusses the hard - core boson models and section [ sec : effgolden ] describes the golden chain phases . in section [ sec : efftj ] , we analyse the effective @xmath14 models for two and three - leg ladders , presenting the numerical results for the same .",
    "we extend the phenomenon of spin - charge separation to ( doped ) ladders of fibonacci anyons . in section  [ fm_rungs ] , we introduce a new model of heavy and light fibonacci anyons that is obtained for certain density regimes when the rung couplings are fm .",
    "we conclude by summarising our results in section  [ conclude ] .",
    "in this paper we focus on fibonacci anyons that are described by the @xmath3 theories . @xmath7 chern - simons theories@xcite are so - called quantum deformations of the @xmath2 algebra .",

    "this braiding is performed by the unitary braid matrix @xmath57 ( see eq .  ( [ eq : braid ] ) ) .",
    "once the particles are nearest neighbours along the path they can interact with the same term as discussed above in sec .",

    "<S> furthermore , these systems have been doped with holes to study @xmath0@xmath1 models of @xmath2 spin-1/2 . </S>",
    "<S> their anyonic counterparts can be built from non - abelian anyons , such as fibonacci anyons described by @xmath3 theories , which are quantum deformations of the @xmath2 algebra . </S>",
    "<S> inspired by the physics of @xmath2 spins , several works have explored ladders of fibonacci anyons and also one - dimensional ( 1d ) @xmath0@xmath1 models . here </S>",
    "<S> we aim to explore the combined effects of extended dimensionality and doping by studying ladders composed of coupled chains of interacting itinerant fibonacci anyons . </S>",
    "<S> we show analytically that in the limit of strong rung couplings these models can be mapped onto effective 1d models . </S>",
    "<S> these effective models can either be gapped models of hole pairs , or gapless models described by @xmath0@xmath1 ( or modified @xmath0@xmath1@xmath4 ) chains of fibonacci anyons , whose spectrum exhibits a fractionalization into charge and anyon degrees of freedom . </S>",
    "<S> the charge degrees of freedom are described by the hardcore boson spectra while the anyon sector is given by a chain of localized interacting anyons . by using exact diagonalizations for two - leg and three - leg ladders , </S>",
    "<S> we show that indeed the doped ladders show exactly the same behavior as that of @xmath0@xmath1 chains . in the strong ferromagnetic rung limit , </S>",
    "<S> we can obtain a new model that hosts two different kinds of fibonacci particles - which we denote as the _ heavy _ @xmath5 s and _ light _ </S>",
    "<S> @xmath5 s . </S>",
    "<S> these two particle types carry the same ( non - abelian ) topological charge but different ( abelian ) electric charges . once again , we map the two - dimensional ladder onto an effective chain carrying these heavy and light @xmath5 s . </S>",
    "<S> we perform a finite size scaling analysis to show the appearance of gapless modes for certain anyon densities whereas a topological gapped phase is suggested for another density regime . </S>"
