    "the study of additive representations as sums of squares of primes goes back to the work of hua  @xcite .",
    "define the sets @xmath12 hua proved that all sufficiently large integers @xmath13 can be expressed as sums of five primes and that `` almost all '' integers @xmath14 , @xmath9 , can be expressed as sums of @xmath15 squares of primes .",
    "let @xmath16 denote the number of positive integers @xmath14 , with @xmath17 , that can not be represented as sums of @xmath15 squares of primes . as was observed by schwarz @xcite , hua s method yields the bounds @xmath18 for any fixed @xmath19 .",
    "since the late 1990s , a burst of activity has produced a series of successive improvements on these two bounds , culminating in the estimates ( see harman and kumchev @xcite ) @xmath20 for any fixed @xmath21 .    in the present note ,",
    "we study the additive representations of a large integer @xmath0 as the sum of three , four or five `` almost equal '' squares of primes . given a large integer @xmath14 , @xmath22 , we are interested in its representations of the form @xmath23 where @xmath24 . the first to consider this question were liu and zhan @xcite , who showed under the assumption of the generalized riemann hypothesis ( grh ) that all sufficiently large @xmath13 can be represented in the form with @xmath5 and @xmath25 for any fixed @xmath26 .",
    "shortly thereafter , bauer @xcite proved that the same conclusion holds unconditionally for @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is a ( small ) absolute constant .",
    "bauer s method is a variant of a method introduced by montgomery and vaughan @xcite to study the exceptional set in the binary goldbach problem .",
    "thus , the value of @xmath29 in bauer s result is at the same time quite small and rather difficult to estimate explicitly . in 1998 ,",
    "liu and zhan @xcite made an important breakthrough in the study of the major arcs in the waring ",
    "goldbach problem , which allowed them , among other things , to give a simpler proof of bauer s result with the explicit value @xmath30 .",
    "their work was followed by a series of successive improvements on the value of @xmath29 :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ [ cols=\"<,^ , < \" , ]",
    "let @xmath0 be a large integer with @xmath6 and let @xmath31 .",
    "we set @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "then the set @xmath34 contains @xmath35 integers @xmath36 satisfying @xmath37 since @xmath38 , it follows from theorem [ thm2 ] that there is an @xmath39 that can be represented as @xmath40 hence , @xmath0 can be represented @xmath41 this establishes theorem [ thm1 ] .",
    "this proof shares many features with the proofs of theorems [ thm4 ] and  [ thm5 ] , so we set the initial stages in more generality than is needed for theorem [ thm3 ] itself . for @xmath22 and a large @xmath42 , we set @xmath43,\\ ] ] and we consider the sum @xmath44 similarly to , we have @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the exponential sum from section [ sec2 ] ( with the summation range @xmath47 replaced by @xmath48 when @xmath49 ) and the sets @xmath50 and @xmath51 are defined in and . in particular , we introduce ( _ via _ ) a parameter @xmath52 , which will be specified shortly . )    when @xmath10 , proposition [ prop1 ] with @xmath53 yields @xmath54 provided that @xmath55 .",
    "furthermore , using lemma [ lem4.4 ] and ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 2 ) ( instead of lemmas [ lem4.1][lem4.3 ] above ) , we can show as in section [ sec4.1 ] that @xmath56 provided that @xmath57 .",
    "let @xmath58 and @xmath59 using bessel s inequality , and , we obtain @xmath60 in particular , we have @xmath61 for all but @xmath62 values of @xmath0 with @xmath63 . combining , and , we conclude that @xmath64 for all but @xmath62 values of @xmath65 with @xmath63 .",
    "theorem [ thm3 ] follows from and  .",
    "we start from with @xmath66 , @xmath67 , @xmath68 , and @xmath69 . with these choices , it is not difficult to generalize the argument of proposition [ prop1 ] to show that @xmath70 here , @xmath71 and @xmath72 are @xmath15-dimensional variants of the singular series and the singular integral from section [ sec5 ] which satisfy the bounds @xmath73 whenever @xmath14 . on the other hand , by and ,",
    "@xmath74 combining and  , we obtain @xmath75 provided that @xmath76 since our choice of @xmath52 and @xmath77 satisfies this inequality , this completes the proof of the theorem .",
    "the proof of the first part of theorem [ thm4 ] follows the same script as that of theorem [ thm3 ] , so we only outline the necessary modifications . first , in place of  , we have @xmath78 this suffices to establish an appropriate version of for all but @xmath79 values of @xmath0 with @xmath80 .",
    "we also need to be more careful when we approach the required version of . a slight variant of the proof of proposition [ prop1 ] yields ( see the treatment of the major arcs in @xcite , especially , the way ( * ?",
    "* lemma 1 ) is applied in the proof of lemma 4 of that paper ) @xmath81 it is important that holds under the same restrictions on @xmath77 and @xmath52 as in section [ sec5 ] , and it is to maintain those restrictions that we need the more subtle arguments from @xcite . here , @xmath82 is a three - dimensional singular integral similar to @xmath83 above , and @xmath84 is a partial sum of the singular series @xmath85 for sums of three squares of primes . unlike the case",
    "@xmath86 , this partial singular series poses some technical difficulties , but those have been resolved in prior work on the waring ",

    "* lemma 8.8 ) and harman and kumchev ( * ? ? ?",
    "* lemma 7 ) ) .",
    "in particular , by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* lemma 7 ) , we have @xmath87 for all but @xmath88 values of @xmath89 with @xmath63 .",
    "this suffices to complete the proof of  .    to establish the second part of theorem [ thm4 ]",
    ", we have to make similar adjustments to the proof of theorem [ thm2 ] . leaving the sieve part of the argument unchanged ,",
    "we then obtain a version of with @xmath90 and complete the proof of the theorem .",
    "we conclude this paper with some remarks on the possibilities for further improvements on some of our theorems .    1 .",
    "the most attractive ( but also most challenging ) direction for further progress involves the restriction @xmath7 in theorem [ thm2 ] . in our work , that restriction is forced upon us by the assumption near the end of section [ sec2 ] that @xmath91 . in our arguments , we require that @xmath92 in several places in section [ sec4.1 ] and that @xmath93 to ensure that hypothesis ( iii ) in section [ sec5 ] holds .",
    "either of those upper bounds on @xmath52 in combination with the requirement @xmath91 restricts @xmath77 to the range in theorem [ thm2 ] .",
    "however , as explained below , the constraint @xmath93 can be eliminated , though at a considerable cost in terms of added complexity to the already involved argument in section [ sec5 ] . since some bounds for `` long '' quadratic weyl sums over primes do not yet have analogues for sums over short intervals , it is possible that the restriction @xmath92 in lemmas [ lem4.3 ] and [ lem4.4 ] can also be relaxed .",
    "it seems that if one succeeds to relax that restriction , one should be able to reach values of @xmath77 below @xmath94 .",
    "a possible improvement on theorems [ thm2 ] and [ thm4 ] , one which does not require new exponential sum bounds , concerns the exponents @xmath95 and @xmath96 in those results .",
    "those exponents are determined by the choice @xmath90 in section [ sec6 ] , which is made in accordance with the restriction @xmath97 in hypothesis ( iii ) above . since that restriction",
    "is imposed more for convenience than out of necessity , it is possible to dispense with it and to increase the value of @xmath52 in the proof of theorem [ thm2 ] , at least when @xmath77 is close to @xmath98 .",
    "that should result in sharper bounds and may even close the small gap between our results with @xmath99 and .",
    "we chose not to pursue this possibility here , because the omission of the assumption @xmath97 from hypothesis ( iii ) unleashes a tidal wave of technical complications on the major arcs , with very little potential return . for a glimpse of those complications ,",
    "the reader can compare the treatments of the major arcs in the papers of harman and kumchev @xcite .",
    "it is also possible to achieve small improvements on the estimates in theorems [ thm3 ] and [ thm4 ] when @xmath100 . in this range",
    ", those theorems claim their respective bounds with @xmath101 , a value obtained by applying an exponential sum estimate of liu and zhan ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 2 ) .",
    "it is possible to modify the sieve argument in section [ sec6 ] so that it can be applied when @xmath102 and @xmath103 .",
    "( when @xmath102 , the latter condition implies @xmath104 , so this should not lead to major arc troubles . )",
    "one should then be able to leverage the modified sieve construction into a larger choice of @xmath52 , and hence , stronger upper bounds .",
    "we did not pursue this path , because we wanted to keep the combinatorial argument in section [ sec6 ] relatively simple .",
    "however , taken on its own , the work involved in such an improvement should not be prohibitive , and we hope to see this minor flaw of our theorems corrected in the future .",
    "this paper was written while the second author was visiting towson university on a scholarship under the state scholarship fund by the china scholarship council .",
    "he would like to take this opportunity to thank the council for the support and the towson university department of mathematics for the hospitality and the excellent working conditions .",
    "the first author thanks professors jianya liu and guangshi l and shandong university at weihai for their hospitality during a visit to weihai in august of 2011 , when a portion of this work was completed . furthermore",
    ", both authors would like to express their gratitude to professors liu and l for several suggestions and comments on the content of the paper .",
    "last but not least , we would like to thank professor trevor wooley for suggesting the question answered in theorem [ thm5 ] ."
