    "ic 443 is the best - studied case of supernova remnant - molecular cloud interaction .",

    "i is associated with the bright northeastern filaments and extends across the entire southern hemisphere of the remnant with velocities up to 100 km s@xmath4 ( giovanelli & haynes 1979 ) .",
    "ic 443 has unusual morphology ; the optical and radio morphology is shell - like , but it extends eastward beyond the main shell ( referred to the  northeastern arm \" ) .",
    "the optical emission shows radial filaments with different curvature in the southwest , and the x - ray emission appears both at the interior of the shell and at the edge of the shell ( petre et al . 1988 ; rho et al .",
    "a superposition with another snr g189.6 + 3.3 has been suggested ( asaoka & aschenbach 1994 ) .",
    "the presence of h@xmath6 line emission along the southern ridge strongly suggests that the supernova shock wave is interacting with the molecular cloud ( burton et al .",

    "a near - infrared line of [ fe  ii ] ( 1.64@xmath0 m ) is detected from the northeastern shell , 30 times as strong as that of br@xmath13 , which is much stronger than seen in galactic h  ii regions .",
    "the strong [ fe  ii ] line is produced not only by efficient excitation of fe but also by grain destruction ( graham et al .",
    "1987 ) .",
    "infrared emission from supernova remnants , including ic 443 , is not well understood .",
    "iras observations show bright emission from ic 443 , which was interpreted as thermal continuum emission from heated small and large dust grains ( arendt 1989 ; saken et al .",
    "1992 ; braun & strom 1986 ) .",
    "however , recent iso observations show no continuum between 5 - 14@xmath0 m with a noise level of 0.2@xmath2@xmath14 erg s@xmath4 @xmath15 sr@xmath4 ( cesarsky et al .",

    ", the observed mid - infrared spectrum of the shocked gas is dominated by rich emission lines of h@xmath6 .",
    "iso sws observations of the northeastern filaments ( oliva et al .",
    "1999a ) also showed detections of rich emission lines , not molecular but ionic lines such as [ ne  ii ] , [ fe  ii ] and [ si  ii ] .",
    "previous interpretations of the iras 12 and 25@xmath0 m emission are different , based on differences between the iso sws and isocam results . in particular , oliva et al .",
    "( 1999a ) suggested that 25@xmath0 m iras emission is virtually all ionized ion lines , while cesarsky et al ( 1999 ) claimed that shocked h@xmath6 lines ( at least at the southern region ) are dominant .",
    "this is due to limited field of view of iso observations toward ic 443 , and also due to limited spatial resolution of the iras image .    in this paper , we present j , h , and k@xmath1 imaging from the two micron all sky survey ( 2mass , skrutskie et al .",

    "we employ diagnostics for rating the cooling in atomic or molecular shocks , and compare the line brightnesses with j and c shock models .    while previous near - infrared imaging and spectroscopic observations were limited to a part of the supernova remnant , the 2mass image offers a global view of the emission , and it provides a means to understand the surrounding ism environment .",
    "ic 443 is the first such example , and we expect other supernova remnants will be revealed in the near - infrared light using 2mass .",

    "the image resolution is typically 3.5@xmath19 , twice the camera resolution , and the data are sampled with 1@xmath19 per pixel .    a total of twenty - four 2mass atlas images in each band covering the  1@xmath20 region around ic 443 were combined to produce the large mosaic shown in figure 1 .",
    "the mosaic was constructed by first combining in the declination direction the three atlas images ( per band ) that fall in the same 2mass tile into individual strips .",
    "eight such strips were formed in each band .",

    "the background levels in each pixel of the eight strips were then adjusted using the intensity offsets in the approximately 1@xmath16 ra overlap region between tiles .",
    "surface brightness profiles in figure 2 show the resultant background fluctuation in the right ascension direction , and the average surface brightnesses over a 1 arcmin@xmath22 area for a representative position from the northeastern rim for j and h bands and from the southern ridge for k@xmath1 band are also shown .",
    "the 2mass flux calibrations for each band were 7.46@xmath23jy / dn , 5.75@xmath23jy / dn and 7.12@xmath23jy / dn , for j , h and k@xmath1 , respectively .",

    "we noticed that the j : h ratio of [ fe  ii ] lines is largely based on the line ratio of [ feii](1.25@xmath0m)/[feii](1.64@xmath0m)=1.35 , set entirely by the atomic data due to both lines having the same upper energy level ( see nussbaumer & storey 1988 ) .",

    "note however , the observed surface brightness of [ si  ii ] is consistent with those in hartigan model ( 1991 ) , as discussed before .",
    "the difference is due to metal abundance since the hartigan models used higher abundances of si ( 3.23@xmath45 ) while the hm model used a smaller value of 3.6@xmath23 .",

    "<S> we present near - infrared j ( 1.25@xmath0 m ) , h ( 1.65@xmath0 m ) , and k@xmath1 ( 2.17@xmath0 m ) imaging of the entire supernova remnant ic 443 from the two micron all sky survey ( 2mass ) , and infrared space observatory ( iso ) lws observations of [ o  i ] for 11 positions in the northeast . </S>",
    "<S> near - infrared emission from ic 443 was detected in all three bands from most of the optically bright parts of the remnant , revealing a shell - like morphology , with bright k@xmath1 band emission along the southern ridge and bright j and h along the northeastern rim . </S>",
    "<S> the total luminosity within the 2mass bands is 1.3@xmath2 10@xmath3 erg s@xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> these data represent the first near - infrared images that are complete in coverage of the remnant .    </S>",
    "<S> the color and morphological structure are very different between the northeastern and southern parts . </S>",
    "<S> j and h band emission from the northeast rim is comparably bright and can be explained mostly by [ fe  ii ] line emission . </S>",
    "<S> the hydrogen recombination lines , p@xmath5 and br10 , should also be present in the broad - band images , but probably contribute less than 10% of the j and h band fluxes . </S>",
    "<S> strong [ o  i ] ( 63@xmath0 m ) lines were detected crossing the northeastern rim , with the strongest line in the northeastern shell where the near - infrared emission shows filamentary structure . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , the southern ridge is dominated by k@xmath1 band light exhibiting a clumped and knotty structure . </S>",
    "<S> a two excitation temperature model derived from previous iso and ground - based observations predicts that h@xmath6 lines can explain most of k@xmath1 band and at least half of j and h band emission . </S>",
    "<S> hence , the prominent broad - band color differences arise from physically different mechanisms : atomic fine structure lines along the northeastern rim and molecular ro - vibrational lines along the southern ridge . </S>",
    "<S> shock models imply a fast j - shock with v@xmath1 @xmath7 100 km s@xmath4 and 10@xmath8n@xmath9 @xmath810@xmath10 @xmath11 for the northeastern rim and a slow c - shock with v@xmath1 @xmath7 30 km s@xmath4 and n@xmath9 @xmath7 10@xmath12 @xmath11 for the southern ridge , respectively .    </S>",
    "<S> the shocked h@xmath6 line emission is well known from the southern sinuous ridge , produced by an interaction with dense molecular clouds . </S>",
    "<S> the large field of view and color of the 2mass images show that the k@xmath1 band emission extends to the east and the northeast , suggesting that the interaction extends to the inner part of the northeastern shell . </S>",
    "<S> our new co map of the inner part of the northeast quadrant shows good correspondence with the k@xmath1-band map . </S>",
    "<S> the co lines are broad , confirming that the k@xmath1-band emission is due to shocked h@xmath6 .    </S>",
