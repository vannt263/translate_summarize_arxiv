    "experimental observation of polariton bose - einstein condensates ( bec ) has been reported in several different systems @xcite . in all of these cases ,",
    "the ground state is populated by relaxation from an excited state , rather than populating the ground state resonantly . a different approach to creating bec in a polariton system proposed by eastham and phillips @xcite ,",
    "does not involve dissipation or inelastic scattering .",
    "instead the condensation occurs as a result of the coherent dynamics of a specific coupled photon - exciton system . in general the proposed dynamical condensation",
    "could be implemented in any system of discrete atomic - like states which are dipole - coupled to a long - lived mode of the electromagnetic field .",
    "we consider the practical aspects of implementing this proposal in semiconductor systems .",
    "the proposed experiment involves two stages , which are separated in time and can be regarded as independent .",
    "the first stage is the creation of a tailored exciton population in the inhomogeneously - broadened exciton line using a controlled pump pulse . for certain population profiles there",
    "is then a second stage , in which the photon - mediated interactions between the localized excitons lead to condensation .",
    "more specifically , the normal modes of a population of dipole - coupled localized excitons obey an equation [ ( [ eq : normalmodes ] ) ] , which is essentially the cooper equation of bcs theory .",
    "it predicts that steps in the energy - dependent exciton population result in new collective modes , leading to condensation .",
    "the theoretical requirements for the condensation stage are described by the equation ( @xmath2 ) @xmath3}{\\lambda_{\\mathbf{k}}-e } de=0.\\ ] ] this equation determines the complex normal - mode frequencies @xmath4 of the electromagnetic field , in a planar microcavity containing an ensemble of localized dipole oscillators .",
    "these normal modes are approximately plane waves , with in - plane wavevector @xmath5 .",
    "@xmath6 is the frequency of the bare cavity mode , whose imaginary part @xmath7 describes the cavity losses .",
    "the localized exciton states are assumed to be two - level systems , which can be either unoccupied or occupied .",
    "@xmath8 is the normalized distribution of the energies of these transitions , and @xmath9 is their area density .",
    "their average occupation at energy @xmath10 is @xmath11 .",
    "adiabatic rapid passage allows the creation of tailored population profiles @xmath11 , with an energy resolution set by the duration of the pump pulse  @xcite .",
    "the coupling @xmath12 is the matrix element for a transition from the unoccupied to the occupied state , assumed to be a constant for simplicity . in the dipole",
    "gauge its explicit form is @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the dipole moment of the transition , @xmath15 its energy , and @xmath16 the effective width of the cavity .",
    "a typical value for a semiconductor in the bandgap region is @xmath17 , corresponding to an electron moving approximately @xmath18 @xcite . for @xmath19 and @xmath20",
    "this gives an estimate @xmath21 .",
    "a solution to ( [ eq : normalmodes ] ) with @xmath22 corresponds to an exponentially growing normal mode , which leads to a large population .",
    "thus the presence of such solutions implies a dynamical phase transition from an exciton population to a non - equilibrium condensate .",
    "the character of this condensate depends on that of the unstable normal mode . if it is essentially a pure electromagnetic field mode we have a photon condensate , i.e. a laser .",
    "if it has a significant excitonic polarisation component then we have condensation of coupled light - matter states .",
    "close to a condensation threshold the imaginary part of ( [ eq : normalmodes ] ) is a gain - loss equation for the growth rate of the mode : @xmath23 $ ] .",
    "the energy range of the optically - active localized states is approximately the inhomogeneous linewidth @xmath24 , so typically @xmath25 .",
    "thus a necessary condition for condensation is , up to numerical factors of order one , @xmath26 .",
    "a second requirement comes from the real part of ( [ eq : normalmodes ] ) , which determines the shifting of the normal mode energies due to the exciton population .",
    "large shifts indicate a significant exciton component , and hence distinguish exciton - photon condensation from lasing",
    ". for realistic @xmath11 and @xmath8 equation ( [ eq : normalmodes ] ) gives shifts of order @xmath27 .",
    "thus if we require energy shifts of order @xmath28 , as well as the gain - loss criterion to be satisfied , we have @xmath29 .    an energy shift greater than the inverse of the exciton s decoherence time implies an excitonic component to the condensate .",
    "we hope to achieve somewhat larger shifts , of order @xmath30 .",
    "this is about one order of magnitude smaller than the vacuum rabi splittings now routinely observed , and is a reasonable benchmark for a new exciton - photon coupling phenomenon . assuming an inhomogeneous linewidth also of order @xmath30 , and taking the estimate of the coupling strength above , gives an order - of - magnitude estimate of the total area density required near the field antinodes as @xmath31 .",
    "the previous demonstration of lasing in very similar vertical cavity surface - emitting structures @xcite indicates that the required physical rgime should be accessible .",
    "stranski - krastanow ( s - k ) dots are limited in density by the requirements of the growth mode , and usually are strongly inhomogeneously broadened , which reduces the spectral density .",
    "we have therefore considered a system based on a `` poor '' quantum well , in which alloy and thickness fluctuations localise the nominally 2d states into quantum dots ( qd ) .",
    "the key issues here relate to the dipole coupling strength , density of dots , and proof of their behaviour as isolated two - level systems .",
    "the sample consists of eight 3.8 nm layers of in@xmath0ga@xmath1as with gaas barriers , grown by molecular beam epitaxy on an insulating gaas substrate .",
    "microphotoluminescence ( @xmath32pl ) collects pl from an area @xmath33 and resolves emission from individual localised states , as shown in figure  [ fig1 ] . by modelling the pl as a superposition of lorentzians in a gaussian distribution we estimate the total density of states ( in eight layers ) to be at least 10@xmath34 ( figure  [ fig1](b , c ) )",
    "this system therefore appears capable of satisfying the density requirement implied in section  [ sec : theoreticalreq ] .",
    "a further important feature of the pl evidence is that the total inhomogeneous linewidth of 10mev is very well suited to the proposed cavity bec experiment , and is narrower than typically found for high density ( @xmath35 ) s - k dot samples .",
    "[ fig2 ]    resonant rayleigh scattering ( rrs ) is sensitive to localisation , and for 2d states shows enhancement by a factor up to 100 on resonance  @xcite .",
    "however , as localisation increases , the intensity of the rrs signal decreases and becomes broader , as the rrs efficiency depends on the ratio between the homogeneous and inhomogeneous broadening of the transitions  @xcite .",
    "the weak enhancement in the present samples ( figure  [ fig2](a ) ) is consistent with a high degree of localisation .",
    "the electron - hole correlation length @xmath36 is given by @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is the diamagnetic shift and @xmath32 the reduced exciton mass  @xcite .",
    "the diamagnetic coefficient of one state measured using magneto - optical @xmath32pl @xcite is found to be 20.1  @xmath32ev  t@xmath39 in the faraday geometry and 7.6  @xmath32ev  t@xmath39 in voigt , shown in figure  [ fig3 ] .",
    "we estimate the extent of the _ e - h _ correlation length to be approximately 7 nm and 4 nm respectively . as",
    "this is a simple model , these values are consistent with those of localised states in qds .",
    "electron microscopy of a qd system with similar composition shows the qds are of length 40 - 100 nm and width 20 - 30 nm ; these states have similar diamagnetic shifts to those measured in the present work  @xcite .",
    "pl emission from a @xmath40 region at six different energies . ]    pl emission from a @xmath40 region at six different energies . ]    [ fig4 ]    @xmath32pl emission maps at six photon energies are shown in figure  [ fig4 ] for a @xmath40 region indicating elongation of the emitting regions in the @xmath41 $ ] direction .",
    "the combination of these experiments indicates that the localised states in narrow in@xmath0ga@xmath1as / gaas quantum wells are promising candidates for the proposed dynamically - driven bec , as they have a high density of discrete localised states distributed over a suitably narrow energy range .",
    "we have outlined the theoretical origin of the requirements for a suitable system in which to realise the proposed condensation scheme .",
    "narrow in@xmath0ga@xmath1as / gaas quantum wells show a suitably high density of localised states to offer a good system for attempted observation of the dynamically - driven bec .",
