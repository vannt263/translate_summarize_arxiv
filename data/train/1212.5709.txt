    "although the standard model(sm ) is in spectacular agreement with the results of most terrestrial experiments , it is certainly incomplete",
    ". apart from theoretical considerations , such as the hierarchy problem , origin of electric charge quantization , and the near miss \" for gauge unification in the sm , several observations point to the need for physics beyond the standard model ( bsm ) . the observation of neutrino oscillations has revealed that neutrinos have non - zero masses and that lepton flavors are mixed@xcite .",
    "in addition , precisely cosmological observations have confirmed the existence of non - baryonic cold dark matter : @xmath2 @xcite . together with the cosmic baryon asymmetry",
    ", these important discoveries can not be accommodated in the minimal sm without introducing extra ingredients .",
    "perhaps the most attractive approach towards understanding the origin of small neutrino masses is using the dimension - five weinberg operator @xcite : @xmath3 which comes from integrating out some new super - heavy particles . a simple way to obtain the operator in eq .",
    "( 1 ) is through the type - i seesaw mechanism @xcite , in which three right - handed neutrinos @xmath4 having large majorana masses but no sm charges are introduced . through yukawa interactions of the @xmath4 with the sm leptons ,",
    "the three active neutrinos then acquire tiny majorana masses as given by the type - i seesaw formula : i.e. , the mass matrix of light neutrinos is given by @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the mass matrix for the light neutrinos ; @xmath7 is the dirac mass matrix linking the left - handed light neutrinos to the @xmath4 , and @xmath8 is the mass matrix for the @xmath4 .",
    "variations of this idea , including the type - ii @xcite and type - iii @xcite seesaw mechanisms have been widely discussed in the literature .",
    "seesaw mechanisms are among the most natural ways to generate tiny neutrino masses , and they can be embedded into more fundamental frameworks such as grand unified theories or string theory .",
    "a salient feature of the seesaw mechanism is that leptogenesis @xcite can work well to account for the matter - antimatter asymmetry of the universe .",
    "a lepton asymmetry is dynamically generated by the cp - violating , and out - of - equilibrium decays of right - handed neutrinos and then converted into a baryon asymmetry via @xmath9 violating sphaleron interactions@xcite that exist in the sm .",
    "however seesaw mechanisms typically lose direct testability on the experimental side . a direct test of seesaw mechanism would involve the detection of these heavy seesaw particles at a collider or in other neutrino experiments as well as the measurement of their yukawa couplings with the electroweak doublets . in the canonical seesaw mechanism ,",
    "heavy seesaw particles turn out to be too heavy , i.e. , @xmath10 @xmath11 , to be experimentally accessible .    in view of the prospects for probing new tev scale physics ,",
    "it is interesting to ask how one might lower the conventional see - saw scale to an experimentally accessible one . indeed",
    ", there exist many approaches to lower the seesaw scale @xcite , but these may seem unnatural . in this paper",
    "we propose a new tev - scale seesaw mechanism .",
    "a guiding principle in constructing this framework is invoke as few new degrees of freedom as possible within the context of the seesaw mechanism while addressing the cosmic matter content and yielding some degree of testability . in doing so",
    ", we seek to explore features that might be generically present in uv complete theories .    to this end , we work in the framework of two higgs doublet model ( 2hdm ) with a @xmath0 gauge symmetry .",
    "the second higgs doublet @xmath12 rather naturally gets a vacuum expectation value ( vev ) through its interaction with the sm higgs boson in the presence of an additional sm singlet scalar @xmath13 .",
    "we first show that its vev can be relatively small . through an appropriate choice of @xmath0 charges for the sm fields as well as the @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and @xmath4 ,",
    "we obtain neutrino masses through the standard see - saw mechanism but allowing @xmath1 yukawa couplings between the light sector and tev - scale @xmath4 .",
    "we show that properties of the massive @xmath14 associated with the spontaneously broken @xmath0 are compatible with present phenomenological constraints , while the new sm gauge singlets required for anomaly cancellation may provide a viable cold dark matter candidate .",
    "constraints on the model from lepton flavor violation decays are studied .",
    "the model may also generate the matter - antimatter asymmetry of the universe through flavor - dependent leptogenesis .    in principle",
    ", this scenario contains several ingredients that should lead to experimental signatures : new tev - scale degrees of freedom , including the @xmath4 , @xmath14 , and dark matter fields ; @xmath1 yukawa couplings in the neutrino sector , implying the possibility of significant charged lepton flavor violation ; and several new scalar degrees of freedom that can mix with the sm higgs .",
    "we find , however , that in the absence of additional lepton flavor symmetries most of the dynamics associated with neutrino mass generation , leptogenesis , and production of the dark matter relic density will be generally difficult to test experimentally .",
    "the magnitude of the neutrino yukawa couplings directly relevant to the leptogenesis lepton asymmetry must be smaller than necessary for observable signatures in the next generation of charged lepton flavor violation searches , assuming an anarchical yukawa matrix structure .",
    "the coupling of the @xmath14 boson to sm particles is suppressed by a tiny @xmath15 mixing angle .",
    "the mixing of the new scalar singlet with the sm higgs , which governs the dark matter annihilation cross section , must be sufficiently small to ensure a dark matter relic density consistent with observation , making its impact on higgs phenomenology at the large hadron collider unlikely to be observable . in the absence of additional flavor symmetries in the lepton sector ,",
    "the only possible experimental signature of this scenario would be a spin - independent signal in dark matter direct detection searches . even this signal would not in itself distinguish this scenario from others that lead to a similar signature .",
    "in short , it is possible that new tev scale physics may be responsible for three of the strongest motivations for extending the sm yet may remain hidden from view .",
    "moreover , unlike many other tev scale bsm scenarios that require additional symmetries in order to suppress experimental signatures , the present scenario would require adoption new symmetries or structure in order to allow for effects at the observable level .",
    "our discussion of the model and these features is arranged as follows : in section ii we give a brief introduction to the model .",
    "we study neutrino masses , lepton flavor violation and dark matter phenomenology in sections iii and iv .",
    "section v is devoted to flavor - dependent leptogenesis .",
    "we summarize in section vi .",
    "our purpose is to explain the tiny but non - zero neutrino masses , dark matter and the cosmic baryon asymmetry _ via _ tev - scale new physics .",
    "to do so in a minimal manner , we extend the sm with three right - handed majorana neutrinos @xmath16 , one extra higgs doublet @xmath17 and one scalar singlet @xmath13 . from the standpoint of the see - saw mechanism , sufficiently small dirac masses @xmath18 for tev scale @xmath19 and @xmath1 yukawa couplings can arise if the vev of @xmath17 is small and solely responsible for a non - vanishing @xmath18 . ensuring",
    "that the sm higgs doublet @xmath20 does not contribute to @xmath18 in this case requires imposition of an additional symmetry .",

    "@xcite . in the present context",
    ", the generation of the neutrino dirac mass in the type - ii global @xmath0 entails an additional , explicit breaking of the symmetry as one may see from the set of possible yukawa interactions : @xmath22 given the @xmath0 charges of the @xmath4 and @xmath20 , the second term explicitly breaks the symmetry as does the third term if @xmath12 is uncharged . for the type - ii global @xmath0 , for which one must include an explicit symmetry - breaking term in the potential to generate the dark matter mass",
    ", it would be unreasonable not to include both of the symmetry breaking terms in eq .",

    "( [ lyukae ] ) , while the third term needed for the tev - scale seesaw mechanism is allowed .",
    "however , the most general scalar potential also includes operators that are invariant under the new @xmath0 but also provide a mechanism for decay of the pseudo - goldstone boson , thereby precluding its viability as a dark matter particle .",
    "consequently , we focus our attention on the local @xmath0 scenario , for which both a viable dark matter particle and tev - scale seesaw mechanism appears possible without the introduction of explicit symmetry - breaking terms .    for the local @xmath0 case , the neutral component @xmath25 gets a small vacuum expectation value(vev ) through its coupling with the sm higgs and is solely responsible for the origin of dirac neutrino mass matrix .",

    "it is interesting to ask whether nature may have generated both neutrino mass and the matter content of the universe at the tev scale .",
    "if so , then one would anticipate signatures in experiments sensitive to bsm physics at this scale .    in this paper",
    ", we have analyzed a simple bsm scenario that can account for dark matter , baryogenesis , and neutrino mass with new tev scale degrees of freedom and shown that , nonetheless , the experimental signatures are likely to be sparse at best . we have made no attempt to alleviate the higgs mass fine tuning problem , though it is possible that an embedding of this scenario in a u.v .",
    "complete model may do so . in this minimal scenario , a neutrinophilic 2hdm with a local u(1)@xmath223 symmetry ,",
    "the second higgs doublet is entirely responsible for neutrino mass .",
    "its vev can be naturally small , allowing for @xmath1 yukawa couplings , tev - scale right - handed neutrinos , and the possibility of observable clfv .",
    "the associated flavor - dependent low - scale ( non - resonant ) leptogenesis can account for the cosmic baryon asymmetry , while the fermions needed for anomaly cancellation provide a suitable dark matter candidate .    despite having the ingredients for a plethora of experimental signatures , we find that simultaneously solving the neutrino mass , dark matter , and baryon asymmetry problems implies that most distinctive features of this scenario ( apart from a non - distinctive spin - independent direct detection signal ) would be out of reach in the foreseeable future in the absence of additional lepton flavor symmetries .",
    "this situation contrasts with a variety of other bsm scenarios , for which new symmetries must be imposed in order to suppress otherwise large deviations from the sm that are inconsistent with observation . in short , nature s solutions to some of the key problems at the interface of particle physics and cosmology",
    "may lie at the tev scale , yet either remain hidden from view or point to an even more complex flavor problem .",
