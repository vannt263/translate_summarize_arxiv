    "for over a decade extensive research has been undertaken on negative refractive indexed metamaterials  @xcite both in the microwave and optical regimes .",
    "the research in optical metamaterials has been stimulated by the possibility of light manipulation methods and potential applications .",
    "most of the experimental work with metamaterials utilizes the plasmonic resonance in metallic structures embedded into a host dielectric .",
    "the disadvantage of this type of metamaterial arises from the high loss value that results from an induced plasmonic resonance in the optical range .",
    "currently , the reduction or compensation of these losses has been the the focus of intensive research .",
    "conceptually , the compensation of losses can be achieved in two ways .",
    "first , by adding gain into a host material containing the metallic nanostructures .",
    "second , by adding a gain material into the nanostructures themselves . in this paper , we consider the optical pulse dynamics in a negative index metamaterial using both types of loss compensation techniques .",
    "to understand the general features of the pulse dynamics in such a system we consider a simplified mathematical model .",
    "the propagation of an electromagnetic wave in matter is described by the system of maxwell s equations : @xmath0 by choosing a system of coordinates in such a way as to assume that a wave propagates in the @xmath1-direction , the magnetic field is oriented in @xmath2-direction , @xmath3 , and the electric field is oriented in the @xmath4-direction , @xmath5 , we transform the system of vector equations  ( [ vector : maxwell ] ) into a system of scalar equations : @xmath6 we start our analysis of the system from the initial case of an electromagnetic wave as it propagates through a nanostructured host dielectric without a gain material .",
    "we also assume that all resonances of the host material are far from the resonances of the metallic nanostructures . in this case ,",
    "@xmath7 and @xmath8 can be represented in the standard form through the medium polarization , @xmath9 , and the magnetization , @xmath10 : @xmath11    to close the system of equations we need to add material equations that describe the interaction of @xmath9 and @xmath10 with an electromagnetic wave .",
    "the total medium response can be represented as sum of the responses from the nanostructures and the gain material : @xmath12 and @xmath13 . to describe such an interaction",
    ", we consider the simplified model represented by distributed linear electric and magnetic resonators .",
    "the plasmonic oscillations result in an oscillation of the polarization described by following equation  @xcite : @xmath14 here @xmath15 is the effective plasma frequency , @xmath16 is the frequency of the dimensional quantization that results from the geometry of the resonator , and @xmath17 accounts for losses . in the popular fishnet structures the dielectric permittivity is negative in operating frequency range . in this case",
    "we can choose @xmath18 .",
    "to describe the magnetic response we assume that a magnetic resonator in a leading order operates as an @xmath19-circuit  @xcite .",
    "this allows us to write a partial differential equation that relates the magnetization and the magnetic field as follows  @xcite : @xmath20 where @xmath21 , @xmath22 are effective inductance and capacity , @xmath23 is a tompson frequency , @xmath24 is a dissipative constant , and @xmath25 describes coupling of nanoresonator with external magnetic flux  @xcite .    the system  ( [ scalar : maxwell ] ) , ( [ b : and : d : general ] ) , ( [ polarization_eqn ] ) , ( [ magnetization_eqn ] ) is a generalization of the well known maxwell - lorentz system of equations , which describes the resonant interaction of an electromagnetic field with a system of linear oscillators that responds only to the electric component of incident light .",
    "this system has played a fundamental role in understanding the interaction of light with resonant atoms  @xcite .",
    "the host material is characterized by the dielectric permittivity , @xmath26 , and the magnetic permeability , @xmath27 . for most materials",
    "the permeability in the optical range is @xmath28 , that is , @xmath29 .",
    "now , by taking the fourier transform of the equations in  ( [ scalar : maxwell ] ) and substituting in the expressions for @xmath30 and @xmath31 we obtain the following equations for fourier components @xmath32 and @xmath33 in terms of @xmath34 and @xmath35 : @xmath36    in order to describe the response from the nanostructures we introduce both an effective dielectric and a magnetic susceptibility .",
    "we consider here the case of a `` diluted '' metamaterial when near neighbor interactions of the nanostructures are much weaker than their interaction via the electromagnetic field . the nanostructure contribution to the effective permittivity and permeability",
    "can be obtained from equations  ( [ polarization_eqn ] ) and  ( [ magnetization_eqn ] ) by applying the fourier transform , that is , @xmath37      ultrashort optical pulses are well described by a slowly varying envelope approximation .",
    "this approximation allows one to simplify the system  ( [ scalar : maxwell ] ) , ( [ b : and : d : general ] ) , ( [ polarization_eqn ] ) , ( [ magnetization_eqn ] ) by representing @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 in the following form : @xmath44 where @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 are slowly - varying functions of @xmath49 and @xmath1 .",
    "it should be noted that the constant @xmath50 stands for the projection of the wave vector on @xmath1 axis , and that it can be both positive and negative for positive and negative index materials respectively .",
    "since the width of wave packet is much less than carrier frequency , the inequalities @xmath53 and @xmath54 still hold . by expanding the expression in the square brackets in equations  ( [ fourier : slow : e ] ) we obtain @xmath55 & \\approx & k^2_0 + 2k_0 k+k^2 - \\frac{(\\omega^2_0 + 2 \\omega_0 \\omega + \\omega^2)}{c^2 } [ n^2_0 ( \\omega_0 )   \\nonumber \\\\ & + & \\left[\\frac{\\partial n^2}{\\partial \\omega}\\right]_{\\omega_0 } \\omega + \\frac{1}{2 } \\left[\\frac{\\partial^2 n^2}{\\partial \\omega^2}\\right]_{\\omega_0 } \\omega^2],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath56 is a square of the effective complex index of refraction .",
    "note that in the above when we divide both sides by @xmath50 the expansion in the fourier domain is of second order , where the second order contribution comes from @xmath65 term . in our further analysis",
    "we will ignore this dispersive term by dropping this second order term .",
    "thus , we have the following slowly - varying governing equations for the system : @xmath66    it follows from equations  ( [ svepa : h ] ) that the magnetic field is proportional to the electric field .",
    "therefore , it is sufficient to analyze only the equation for electric field .",
    "also , note that if the carrier frequency is in the frequency range that determines a positive real value for the phase , then @xmath67 and the imaginary coefficients will all have a sign opposite that which that they are for the case when @xmath68 .",
    "as noted in the previous section , the metallic nanoresonators are lossy . to compensate for these losses",
    "we propose that active atoms be embedded in the dielectric host medium or into nanostructures .",
    "it should be noted that here we consider coherent amplification , where the coherent state of the atomic ensemble is preserved during transition from an excited to a ground state .",
    "the atomic inclusions that we consider here will be two - level , that is , they have an excited and a ground state . in the case",
    "when amplifying atoms are included to host dielectric , the polarization , @xmath69 , is represented as polarizability , @xmath70 , of a two - level single multiplied by atomic density , @xmath71 : @xmath72 .",
    "the bloch equations , which describe the interaction of polarizability and population difference , @xmath73 , of two - level atoms with the electric field is given in the slowly - varying envelope approximation as : @xmath74 where @xmath75 is the carrier frequency , @xmath76 is the frequency corresponding to the transition between the excited and ground state , @xmath77 is the dipole moment .",
    "we consider the case when the spectral pulse width , @xmath78 , is within the negative index frequency , @xmath79 , domain and that the pulse width , @xmath80 , is smaller than the characteristic time of the atomic polarization relaxation , @xmath81 . in an experimental situation , @xmath82  @xcite ,",
    "the value of @xmath81 varies in a broad range . for @xmath83 ions in a glass matrix at room temperature ,",
    "@xmath84 and @xmath85 for @xmath86 at @xmath87  @xcite .",
    "we consider the situation when all these requirements are fulfilled and coherent amplification takes place .    to fulfill these requirements and select an optimal value for the carrier frequency we analyze the dispersion relation  ( [ dispersion : law ] ) .",
    "the negative index property is determined by the magnetic response of the metamaterial .",
    "the parameter @xmath88 determines the strength of this response and therefore controls the negative index property .",
    "this parameter depends on the design of the nanostructure .",
    "the case of a double split ring was considered in  @xcite , and from these papers it follows that the value of @xmath88 can be chosen from the interval @xmath89 $ ] . in real experimental situations of doubly resonant metamaterials ,",
    "the values of @xmath16 and @xmath90 are close . in the case of a fishnet structure",
    "there is no resonance in the electric response and @xmath16 can be chosen to be zero @xmath18  @xcite . in our study",
    "we chose @xmath91 and all the frequencies are normalized relative to @xmath90 .",
    "thus we chose @xmath92 , @xmath93 , @xmath94 and the dissipative constants were chosen as @xmath95 and @xmath96 .",
    "this choice of parameters approximately corresponds to the case of silver .",
    "the value of @xmath17 is taken from  @xcite and the value of @xmath24 was extracted from experimental results presented in  @xcite .",
    "the functions @xmath97 and @xmath98 are presented in figure  [ dispersion : relation ] .",
    "the function @xmath97 is negative on the interval @xmath99 $ ] .",
    "the function @xmath98 is positive , which corresponds to the presence of losses , and has a flat local minima around @xmath100 . the neighborhood of this flat local minima of @xmath98 and interval of negative values for @xmath97 overlap .",
    "if the carrier frequency , @xmath75 , is chosen near this local minima then the effect of dispersion of dissipation can be neglected . since @xmath101 ,",
    "the phase velocity is negative , while on the other hand the group velocity , @xmath62 , is positive @xmath102 for this interval of frequencies .",
    "therefore , the phase and group velocities are oppositely directed for @xmath75 selected as described above .",
    "if the resonant frequency of the active atoms is close to such an @xmath75 , the material possesses the negative index property and the dispersion of losses can be neglected .",
    "the balance between coherent amplification and dissipation leads to the formation of a stationary optical pulse .",
    "the shape and velocity of such pulse can be found using technique suggested in  @xcite . in the following dimensionless variables : @xmath103 , @xmath104 , @xmath105 , @xmath106 , @xmath107",
    "we can obtain the following governing equations for the system @xmath108 where @xmath109    by examining the behavior of the system near the excited state , @xmath110 , we will be able to study the linear behavior of the front .",
    "the system of equations near the excited state has the following approximation in the comoving system of coordinates @xmath111 , @xmath112 :    @xmath113    where @xmath114 .",
    "taking the fourier transform of this system gives us the dispersion relation : @xmath115 thus , near the excited state an amplitude of the electric field can be approximated as @xmath116 where @xmath117 is the phase of the integral .",
    "we are interested in the behavior of the traveling wave solution for large distances so as to determine solitary wave solutions .",
    "the method for determining this type of a solution for integrals of this form is the stationary phase technique .",
    "the phase , @xmath118 , has a fixed point at : @xmath119 .",
    "that is , @xmath120 for these values of @xmath121 we see that the phase has the following forms : @xmath122 thus , we see that when the positive square root is chosen the solution will grow exponentially for large @xmath1 , which can not occur , and thus the contribution from this term must be zero . for the second stationary point",
    "there is an exponential decay , which implies that we will have a strong dependence on @xmath1 . in our traveling wave solution",
    ", the shape of the pulse for large @xmath1 should be determined by @xmath123 , and therefore this strong dependence of @xmath1 must be eliminated .",
    "thus , we need the following to hold : @xmath124im@xmath125\\sqrt{\\beta } - \\gamma=0 , $ ] that is , @xmath126 ^ 2}\\\\ v_{fr}=\\frac{4 \\mathrm{im } [ i\\sqrt{1+i\\delta}]^2}{4\\mathrm{im } [ i\\sqrt{1+i\\delta}]^2+\\gamma^2 } \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    using this expression for @xmath127 and substituting in @xmath128 into the phase of the integral in expression  ( [ e : integral ] ) we see that near the excited state the electric field can be approximated as follows : @xmath129 z ) }",
    "i(z ) , \\label{formoffront}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath130 is the integral of higher order terms from the expansion of the phase around that stationary point @xmath128 .",
    "note that @xmath131= \\lambda \\beta_{cr}+ 2 \\mathrm{re}[i\\sqrt{1+i\\delta}\\sqrt{\\beta_{cr}}]$ ] .",
    "let us use the following notation to simplify this expression : @xmath132 , which allows us to simplify this term : @xmath133= \\frac{\\lambda \\gamma^2 - 4\\gamma \\delta '' \\delta'}{4(\\delta')^2}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] also note that if @xmath134 , i.e. if the coefficient in front of the polarization in the first equation in the system of governing equations is not complex , and if we ignore detuning , @xmath135 , then the phase will be zero . also , note that the form of the front depends on @xmath136 , which is determined by the initial condition for the electric field .",
    "in addition , we see that the shape of the pulse is determined by the variable @xmath123 , and the imaginary part of @xmath128 , that is the shape of the pulse is proportional to @xmath137im@xmath138\\tau ) = \\exp(-(2(\\delta')^2/\\gamma ) \\tau)$ ] .",
    "we also see that because @xmath128 is complex this solution will oscillate in @xmath123 with period determined by re@xmath139 $ ] .",
    "thus , as we have noted before , when @xmath140 the phase is zero , and no oscillations exist . when numerical computations are performed this can be observed .",
    "we have obtained two very important pieces of information from the linear analysis .",
    "firstly , we have determined the velocity , @xmath141 , of the front , and for this reason we are now able to solve the ordinary differential equation determined by moving into a co - moving frame of coordinates .",
    "secondly , we now know that the front oscillates as it propagates , so that before we move into the co - moving frame we must express the electric field and polarization envelopes as : @xmath142 and @xmath143 . plugging these into eqs .",
    "( [ dimensionless : pde ] ) gives us the following system in the co - moving frame @xmath144    @xmath145    near @xmath110 we can observe that : @xmath146 with the velocity determined by our previous analysis and recall that @xmath147 the characteristic equation for the above system is degenerate .",
    "to see this , let us look at the simpler case when @xmath135 , that is , when the carrier frequency is equal to the transition frequency of the atomic inclusions .",
    "for this case we have the following ode @xmath148 which is degenerate with solutions of the form : @xmath149 note that to solve the nonlinear ode we need both @xmath150 and @xmath151 .",
    "if we can determine @xmath152 from the initial condition given for @xmath153 , then we know @xmath151 . unfortunately , the above linear analysis does not allow us to do this because the characteristic equation is degenerate and our solution near the excited state does not allow us to simply express @xmath152 in terms of the @xmath150 .",
    "however , if we look at the linearization around @xmath154 , the ground state , we see that : @xmath155 and using the velocity computed in the previous analysis our characteristic equation tells us that @xmath156 can be expressed as : @xmath157 where @xmath158    since we are analyzing the behavior of the front near the ground state we know that the shape of the pulse must decay exponentially here , and therefore @xmath159 .",
    "thus , @xmath160 thus , given a choice for @xmath150 we see that : @xmath161 and we are able to numerically solve the nonlinear ordinary differential equation .",
    "these solutions can be seen in figs .",
    "( [ electricfield : ode])-([population : ode ] )            to match the asymptotic behavior let us write the form of the solution near the excited state in the form : @xmath162 this asymptotic form must match the condition obtained using the stationary phase technique .",
    "since the position of the solution described by the stationary phase technique is described through z while the position of the front solution given by the ode solution is determined through the shift variable @xmath163 , by comparing the asymptotic of these two equations we will be able to express @xmath163 as a function of z.    thus , if we add a shift term , @xmath163 to the ode solution we can compare asymptotic : @xmath164 thus , @xmath165 the position of the front is given by @xmath163 while the width of the pulse is given by @xmath166 .",
    "since the transition from the stable to unstable states takes place on the order @xmath167 this implies that @xmath166 is of order @xmath167 .",
    "on the other hand , @xmath163 the position of the pulse is dependent on the size of the incident pulse , @xmath168 , that is @xmath169 .",
    "since the initialization is small this means that @xmath163 is large .",
    "thus , @xmath170 and @xmath171 from this we see that @xmath172 and @xmath163 , the shift variable , can be determined iteratively .",
    "let us return to the dimensionless system of partial differential equations  ( [ dimensionless : pde ] ) .",
    "to solve this system numerically we use a strang splitting method , where we have a step that solves the ordinary differential equations , and we have a separate step that solves the partial differential dimensionless maxwell s equation .",
    "the ordinary differential equation step is solved using midpoint method , and the partial differential equation step is solved using the maccormack method . at the boundary we consider a small gaussian pulse @xmath173 and we also assume that the system is initially in the excited state , @xmath174 .",
    "the result of the numerical computations can be seen in fig .",
    "( [ intensity : numerical ] ) .    as was noted in the section on linear analysis and in the previous section",
    ", the pulse should oscillate as in moves through the medium . in the numerical computations",
    "this does occur , and the period of these oscillations if given by the phase of the approximation of the front given in the expression  ( [ formoffront ] ) .",
    "a comparison of the velocity computed analytically and the velocity of the pulse generated by the system numerically can be seen in fig .",
    "( [ analytic : numerical : complexzero ] ) .",
    "another approach toward loss compensation in materials with embedded nanostructures is to add the amplification capability directly into the nanostructures .",
    "there are two main motivations in favor of this approach .",
    "first , the small size of the nanostructures will induce highly intense local electric fields that result from the interaction of the nanostructures with an external electromagnetic field .",
    "this strong local field will enable a strong response from the gain material if it is inserted directly into a nanostructure . secondly",
    ", since the nanostructures are the source of loss , the losses in the system occur on the scale of a nanostructure . in the case that was considered in the previous subsection ,",
    "the loss was compensated by a gain material distributed over the entire host medium .",
    "thus , a strong loss occurred on the scale of a nanostructure , while the compensatation acted on a mean - field scale .",
    "the scales of loss and loss compensation are not in agreement when performed in this way . a more appropriate way to compensate for loss would not only balance the gain and loss of energy , but would also match the scales of these two procedures .",
    "we propose that this can be achieved by embedding a gain material directly into the nanostructures , and in this subsection we focus on modeling such a method of loss compensation .    in our analysis",
    "we consider the simplest case where nanostructure in a leading order can be viewed as an @xmath19 circuit .",
    "we consider nanostructures that produce spatially homogeneous effective local fields .",
    "this simplification allows us to avoid a consideration of the spatial dynamics for a local field , and to take into account only temporal dynamics .",
    "the external electric field generates a current in the @xmath19 circuit .",
    "the current in turn establishes a local electric field across a `` capacitor '' .",
    "thus , if we place active atoms or quantum dots in the part of the structure that is responsible for the electric capacity , we will be able to utilize the strong local electric field and directly compensate for loss .",
    "we first derive an equation that describes the oscillatory processes in an @xmath19 circuit that contains active atoms in the capacitor . in the ideal case without losses ,",
    "the potential difference at the capacitor can be expressed in the form : @xmath175    here @xmath176 is potential difference on the inductance and @xmath177 is the electromotive force due to magnetic flux variations through the area of the @xmath19 circuit",
    ". we can express @xmath176 via the electric field , @xmath178 , and the polarization of the medium , @xmath179 , inside the capacitor : @xmath180 here @xmath77 is the size of the gap in a @xmath19 circuit , @xmath178 is the electric field induced by charges at the edges of a @xmath19 circuit , and @xmath181 is the polarization of the medium inside the capacitor .",
    "the electric field in the capacitor is @xmath182 where @xmath183 is the area of the metallic plates formed at the end of the @xmath19 circuit .",
    "taking into account the expression for @xmath42 , we see that the expression for @xmath184 has the following form : @xmath185    the potential difference on the inductance and the electromotive force can be expressed as : @xmath186 which means that the equation describing this @xmath19-circuit reads @xmath187 that is , @xmath188 recall that the capacity is given by : @xmath189 , which allows us to make the following substitution : @xmath190 from the expression for thompson s frequency , @xmath191 , we obtain system of equations @xmath192 if we consider a system with loss we add the potential drop due to resistance , @xmath193 , to the system and the governing equations will read : @xmath194 we know that the polarization effects due to the presence of active atomic inclusions has the form : @xmath195 where @xmath196 is the density of the atomic population , @xmath197 is an off - diagonal element of the density matrix and @xmath198 is the dipole moment . since these atoms are contained within the capacitor , we can express the atomic density as : @xmath199 where @xmath200 is the population and @xmath201 is the volume of the capacitor .",
    "thus , the polarization term that comes from atomic inclusions placed inside the capacitor of the @xmath19 circuit can be expressed as : @xmath202 since the size of the `` capacitor '' is small it follows that the polarization contribution is quite large . recalling that the magnetization , @xmath10 , can be expressed as a function of the current in the @xmath19-circuit , @xmath203 the material equation determined by these nanostructures with inclusions placed inside the capacitor is therefore :    @xmath204    where @xmath205 , @xmath206 , and @xmath207 .",
    "now , as in the previous case we will be considering structures responding as an @xmath19-circuit to the magnetic field and these structures can have a resonant response to external electric field .",
    "the polarization effects comes from plasmonic oscillations and the geometry of the nanostructures : @xmath208 where @xmath42 is the external electric field , @xmath209 is the polarization contribution from the nanostructures , @xmath210 is the losses due to plasmonic oscillations , @xmath16 is the frequency of the dimensional quantization that comes from the geometry of the resonator , and @xmath15 is the plasma frequency .    now that we have the material equations for this case we need to derive the slowly - varying envelope equations . from eq .",
    "( [ magnetization : comp ] ) , we take the fourier transform to see that : @xmath211 thus , @xmath212 and we see that the effective permeability of the system , @xmath213 , is the same as in the case of mean - field amplification . by taking the fourier trasform of eq .",
    "( [ polarization : nano ] ) we obtain @xmath214 to see that the effective permittivity , @xmath215 , is also the same as that for mean - field amplification , which is determined by the nano - structures . recalling the fourier transform of maxwell s equations we have : @xmath216 where @xmath35 comes from the nanostructures .",
    "note that the polarization effects from the active atoms interact mainly with the local electric field inside the capacitor , which is much stronger than the external electric field .",
    "thus , we have @xmath217\\hat{e}&= & -\\frac{i 4\\pi \\omega^2 k \\omega^2_t \\alpha}{c(\\omega^2_t -\\omega^2 -i\\omega \\gamma)}\\hat{p}_a \\\\",

    "we now add to these slowly - varying equations those for the polarization and relative atomic population as determined in the previous case .",
    "the difference we must keep in mind is that these amplifying structures are embedded into the nano - structures , and therefore the electric field in these equations is the local electric field rather than the external .",
    "the slowly - varying governing equations for the amplifying material : @xmath221 where as before @xmath76 corresponds to the transition frequency and @xmath75 is carrier frequency .",
