    "until popularized by morris and thorne @xcite the idea of spacetime wormhole introduced in the 1930s by einstein and rosen @xcite was considered non - physical and largely as a fantasy .",
    "although all kinds of spherically / cylindrically symmetric metrics known to date were tried the wormhole concept was shadowed by the required negative total energy . while it was easy to resort to quantum field theoretical negative energy for remedy the absence of large scale quantum systems persisted as another serious handicap . for such reasons relying on classical physics and searching for support within",
    "this context seems indispensable . even to minimize the negative ( exotic ) energy the idea of thin - shell wormhole ( tsw ) was developed ( see @xcite and those cited therein ) . by construction in all these studies",
    "the otherwise non - traversable wormhole throat that connects two different universes has circular topology .    in this study",
    "we add oblateness as a new degree of freedom represented by the parameter @xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) and show that for certain range of @xmath1 total energy becomes positive to avoid exotic sources .",
    "this happens in the zipoy - voorhees - weyl ( zvw ) spacetime @xcite with a quadrupole moment @xmath3 , where @xmath4mass of the bumpy object ( or the black hole ) .",
    "naturally for @xmath5 one recovers the spherical schwarzschild geometry .",
    "it should be supplemented that integrability and chaotic behaviours of the zvw spacetime still is not well understood @xcite .",
    "asymptotically flat , rotating zvw metric was discovered by tomimatsu and sato ( ts ) @xcite , which similar to its static predecessor remains from physics stand point yet unclear .",
    "once the problem of gravitational wave detection is overcome we expect that non - kerr ( i.e. , @xmath6 ) multipoles of the entire ts family can be detected .",
    "we note also that non - asymptotically flat extension of zvw metric is also available whose physics is yet to be understood 7 .",
    "herein we concentrate on the static zvw metric in general relativity and construct thin - shell wormhole ( tsw ) in this spacetime .",
    "we should add that in the context of the modified theories of gravity , previously , there were some attempts to introduce thin - shell wormhole supported by positive / normal matter @xcite . from this token",
    "it was realized that the normal matter is possible only for the exotic branch solution of the einstein - gauss - bonnet field equation @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "construction of tsw in zvw spacetime is carried out in section ii .",
    "integration of the total energy is achieved in section iii .",
    "stability analysis follows in section iv and conclusion in section v completes the paper .",
    "the two parameter zvw spacetime in the prolate spheroidal coordinates is described by the line element@xmath7 in which @xmath8where @xmath9 and the range of coordinates are @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 $ ] and @xmath13 .",
    "we note that @xmath2 such that @xmath14 corresponds to a flat spacetime and with @xmath5 one finds the schwarzschild black hole solution with the horizon located at @xmath15 . for the case",
    "@xmath6 the hypersurface @xmath15 is a true curvature singularity ( naked singularity ) 9 .",
    "as we shall see , the asymptotic behaviour of the zv spacetime for @xmath16 and @xmath17 is of our interest .",
    "it can be seen from ( 1 ) that , in the limit @xmath18 it becomes@xmath19which after a redefinition of @xmath20 and @xmath21 the line element becomes@xmath22which is flat .",
    "construction of thin - shell wormhole ( tsw ) follows the standard procedure of cutting and pasting @xcite .",
    "we consider two copies of zvw spacetime and we remove from each @xmath23 in which @xmath24 constant outside the singularities / horizons .",
    "we should comment here that the minimality conditions of hochberg and visser @xcite which is also known as _ the generalized flare - out conditions _ in static wormholes do not apply in the present case of tsw @xcite . at the throat",
    "two spacetimes are identified to make a complete manifold .",
    "we introduce next the induced coordinates @xmath25 on the wormhole s throat with its proper time @xmath26 .",
    "the two coordinates are related by@xmath27so that induced metric on the throat @xmath28 reads @xmath29 .\\]]the israel junction conditions @xcite on @xmath28 take the form ( @xmath30 ) @xmath31 in which @xmath32 stands for a jump across the hypersurface .",

    "we observe that for @xmath17 there exists regions that @xmath79 becomes positive .",
    "this is seen clearly in fig . 1 . also in the interval on which @xmath80 the weak and strong energy conditions are satisfied .",
    "we note that , in fig .",
    "1 the energy density @xmath78 is shown in terms of @xmath52 and @xmath51 but only @xmath52 is variable and @xmath51 is fixed for a specific tsw .",
    "this means that at the throat @xmath81 and only @xmath52 and @xmath82 are variable .",
    "as one sees from ( 18 ) , there is angular symmetry and as a result , not only @xmath78 but also @xmath83 and @xmath77 are only functions of @xmath84 in addition , @xmath83 is a constant function of @xmath52 .",
    "therefore once we set the radius of the throat i.e. , @xmath85 our energy momentum tensor s components are left with the only variable @xmath84 hence , depending on @xmath52 , the energy density of the tsw i.e. @xmath78 is locally positive or negative .",
    "this is what we see in fig . 1 . of course , the situation is completely different for @xmath83 and @xmath77 which are positive for entire domain of @xmath84    in addition to the energy conditions we are mainly interested in the total energy supporting the tsw given by @xmath86which simplifies to @xmath87 in eq .",

    "2 we plot @xmath89 versus @xmath45 and @xmath1 with fixed value of mass @xmath60 fig .",
    "3 reveals more details .",
    "these plots overall show that tsw  supported by normal matter is possible provided @xmath90 .",
    "that explains also why given ordinary matter alone in schwarzschild spacetime with @xmath91 there was no such traversable wormhole . in this regard",
    "let us add that even an arbitrarily small energy condition violation is considered respectable @xcite .",
    "in this section we apply the small velocity perturbation on the shell under the condition that the eos of the tsw after the perturbation is same as its eos at its static equilibrium .",
    "this is possible if the perturbation process occurs slow enough in which all the intermediate states can also be considered as static equilibrium points .",

    "4 and 5 we plot @xmath96 in terms of @xmath45 and @xmath52 for the initial values @xmath97 and @xmath98 respectively , and @xmath99 .",
    "as one can see in both cases the velocity does not get zero , which means that the throat does not go back to its initial position .     versus @xmath45 and @xmath52 with @xmath100 @xmath101 and @xmath102 the velocity never vanishes which is an indication of instability of the throat under the small velocity perturbation.,width=302 ]     plot of @xmath96 versus @xmath45 and @xmath52 with @xmath103 @xmath104 and",
    "@xmath102 the velocity fails to vanish which amounts to instability of the throat under the small velocity perturbation.,width=302 ]",
    "we considered the possibility of having physical wormhole solution in einstein s general relativity which is supported by normal matter and the energy conditions are satisfied .",
    "our emphasis is on einstein s general relativity instead the modified theories such as the lovelock theory . in such theories",
    "there were attempts to find such physical wormholes @xcite with non - physical solution and it was shown that a tsw supported by positive energy was possible . in this context we have shown that tsws with oblate sources can be employed to admit an overall physical ( i.e. non - exotic ) matter even in einstein s general relativity . as we have depicted in figures , for @xmath90",
    "not only the total energy of the wormhole is positive but also the wecs and secs are satisfied for limited @xmath52-interval , which increases for larger @xmath105 certain range of deviation from spherical symmetry can be chosen from the total energy integral to render this possible . locally it can easily be checked from eq .",
    "( 16 ) for @xmath106 , for instance , that we have a negative energy density , however , this is compensated within the total energy expression .",
    "it is also expected that once the metric and the surface energy - momentum become time dependent energy conservation on the thin shell will not be valid any more .",
    "another important aspect concerning tsws which has not been discussed here is their stability against perturbations .",
