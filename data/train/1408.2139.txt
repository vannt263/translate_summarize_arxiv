    "the totally asymmetric simple exclusion process ( tasep ) is one of the most studied models in non - equilibrium statistical mechanics and a paradigm for driven diffusive collective transport . in this",
    "stochastic process particles hop uni - directionally on a one - dimensional lattice subject to the constraint that each site can contain only a single particle . originally introduced to model kinetics of biopolymerization @xcite , variants have since been used to describe many different biological , physical and socioeconomic transport processes  @xcite and a rich theoretical literature has also developed ( see e.g. ,  @xcite ) .    in the standard continuous - time tasep",
    "the dynamics are markovian and the waiting times between jump attempts of a particle have an exponential distribution .",
    "the times of attempted jumps then form a poisson process and one can think of poisson clocks that ring after exponential times to indicate the next jump attempt . depending on the application",
    ", these clocks can either be attached to particles ( such as in the case of molecular motors ) or attached to lattice sites or bonds ( such as for networks of server queues ) .",
    "as long as the processes all have the same rate , these two interpretations are equivalent in the markovian case .",
    "we consider , in this paper , the effect of generalized waiting - time distributions with finite mean ( fixed to unity throughout ) .",
    "to avoid degeneracies , we assume that the waiting times have non - zero variance and that the associated renewal process of attempted jump times is ergodic .",
    "an example of such dynamics has been studied recently in @xcite where non - poisson clocks with heavy - tailed waiting time distributions of pareto type were attached to particles . for heavy tails with infinite variance ,",
    "very long waiting times can be sampled leading to a condensation phenomenon where particles form a macroscopic jam .",
    "in particular , it was observed in  @xcite that an increase in the coefficient of variation of the waiting time distribution leads to a reduced stationary current .",
    "in contrast , in the present contribution we are chiefly interested in cases where the variation is smaller than for the exponential distribution , leading to correlated stationary states and increased currents as illustrated in figure  [ fig : tagged ] .",
    "this is important to understand collective transport dynamics of motors or particles with internal degrees of freedom leading to non - exponential waiting times , see e.g. ,  @xcite and note that the last of these works provides numerical evidence for an increase in maximal current .",
    "specifically we focus on studying the fundamental diagrams of such non - markovian models , i.e. , the stationary current as a function of the particle density for periodic boundary conditions in the limit of large system size .",
    "this is the most important characteristic of a driven diffusive system which essentially fully determines its behaviour on macroscopic scales through conservation laws ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , the well - known phase diagrams for open boundary systems are determined by steady state selection from the fundamental diagram @xcite .",
    "an exact calculation requires knowledge of the stationary state , which is not available for general non - markovian versions of tasep . however , our main result is that , to a very good approximation , the fundamental diagram is determined by three characteristics of the waiting time distribution : the mean ( set to unity ) , the mean of the residual waiting time distribution ( which fixes the slope of the fundamental diagram at high and low densities and is essentially equivalent to the variance of the distribution ) and a third order moment of the distribution ( which characterizes the deviation from the maximal possible current in the system ) .",
    "we have tested this claim for a large class of different waiting time distributions , including @xmath0-distributions and pareto distributions , as well as uniform and simple bimodal distributions for which we do not present data here .",
    "our main example for the purpose of a simple presentation is a family of exponential distributions with a delay time @xmath1 $ ] , which has a characteristic unimodal structure and interpolates between the markovian case ( @xmath2 ) and the deterministic case ( @xmath3 ) where all hop attempts are fully synchronized .",
    "our approach applies to non - poissonian jump processes being attached to particles , as well as to lattice sites .",
    "the latter exhibits a particle - hole symmetry and is therefore simpler to study , so we illustrate our approach for this case ( i.e. , clocks fixed to sites ) and then explain how it can be modified to study the particle - based model .    in a broader context ,",
    "there are also discrete - time versions of the tasep which are often used in models of pedestrian or vehicular traffic and are known to lead to similar correlations and modified fundamental diagrams . in these models",
    "all particles try to update their position after each time step in an order determined by the current update scheme , e.g. , parallel update or shuffled update @xcite .",
    "different implementations lead to different dynamics but often the update rules are artificial and are chosen essentially ad hoc in order to introduce observed correlations and produce realistic fundamental diagrams ( see e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "our approach provides a natural framework to achieve similar fundamental diagrams in the often more realistic case of continuous - time dynamics .",
    "in particular , it turns out that one limiting case of the particle - based model is the frozen shuffle update @xcite where the update order is set randomly in the beginning of the simulation and remains fixed .",
    "this furnishes a theoretical explanation of the approach of the fundamental diagram to an asymmetric triangular shape .",
    "we conclude this introductory section by remarking that although single - particle non - markovian dynamics ( as relevant for describing the dynamics of individual motors  @xcite ) has been studied within the mathematical framework of renewal processes or continuous - time random walks  @xcite , there is to our knowledge no general analytical description for non - markovian many - particle systems and we thus hope our results will be of wider interest .",
    "one similar non - markovian model worth mentioning here is the recently - studied zero - range process with an additional stochastic activity variable attached to each site @xcite  this can also be mapped to a type of non - markovian tasep .",
    "non - markovian dynamics are also of recent interest in dynamics of interacting neurons @xcite and in the context of polymer growth @xcite .",
    "the rest of the paper is structured as follows .",
    "after introducing the framework in section  [ s : def ] , we present our main results in section  [ s : results ] before discussing generalizations and further questions in section  [ s : discussion ] .",
    "we consider a one - dimensional lattice @xmath4 of @xmath5 sites with periodic boundary conditions , and denote a configuration of the tasep by @xmath6 corresponds to the absence or presence of a particle , respectively .",
    "in the site - based model , we associate independent jump processes to sites @xmath7 , each represented by an increasing sequence of positive times @xmath8 denotes the time of the @xmath9-th jump attempt at site @xmath7 .",
    "we assume the @xmath10 to be renewal processes ( see e.g. , @xcite ) , so that the waiting times @xmath11 are independent and identically distributed random variables ; we denote a generic copy by @xmath12 and its distribution by @xmath13 our main example throughout is a delayed exponential distribution @xmath14 with delay @xmath15 .",
    "note that for @xmath2 waiting times are simply exponentially distributed ( markovian case ) , and that we choose the exponential tail such that the mean @xmath16 for all @xmath15 . for @xmath17 ,",
    "the pdf in ( [ eq : fdelta ] ) converges to @xmath18 which corresponds to a deterministic limit @xmath19 .",
    "so this family interpolates between the markovian and the deterministic case . as further examples we also consider gamma and pareto distributed waiting times @xmath20 both parametrized in order to have normalized mean with @xmath21 and @xmath22 . at jump times",
    "@xmath23 , if there is a particle at site @xmath7 it jumps to @xmath24 provided this site is currently empty , otherwise the configuration @xmath25 is not updated . in formulae , @xmath26 for all @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "here we use the common notation @xmath29 for the configuration just before the jump , and @xmath30 for the configuration where a particle moved from @xmath7 to @xmath24 .",
    "the model can be defined analogously with jump processes @xmath31 attached to particles with index @xmath32 rather than sites .",
    "note that , unless we are in the markovian case , this is not equivalent to the site - based model .",
    "the latter exhibits a particle - hole symmetry and is simpler to analyze , so will be our main focus in the following with the particle - based model discussed briefly at the end .",
    "a standard way to quantify the dispersion of samples of a probability distribution is the coefficient of variation @xmath33 , defined as the ratio of standard deviation and expectation .",
    "since we normalize the expectation to @xmath34 , we have @xmath35 for the family ( [ eq : fdelta ] ) of delayed exponentials .",
    "this equals @xmath34 for the markovian case and vanishes as @xmath17 corresponding to a deterministic update after one unit of time . for heavy - tailed pareto distributions",
    "this can also be larger than @xmath34 as is mentioned later in the discussion .",
    "another very important characteristic of renewal processes is the residual lifetime @xmath36 which is the long - time limit of the remaining time until the next jump attempt .",
    "intuitively , this corresponds to the time until the next jump when observing the process at a ` random ' time , which is equivalent to a stationary observation of this quantity .",
    "the distribution of @xmath37 can be computed explicitly @xcite using ( [ eq : dwelldist ] ) , @xmath38 for exponential @xmath12 this is simply equal to the waiting time distribution @xmath39 , corresponding to the memory - less property of markov processes . for the distribution ( [ eq : fdelta ] ) we get for the expected residual lifetime @xmath40 with @xmath41 in the markovian case as expected . in the deterministic limit @xmath17",
    "this converges to the minimal value @xmath42 , corresponding to the average of a uniform random variable on @xmath43 $ ] which is the interval between two jump events . for any mean-@xmath34 distribution with positive variance",
    "the expected residual lifetime is larger than @xmath42 .",
    "it can also be larger than the markovian value @xmath34 or even diverge due to heavy tails , as is discussed later for pareto distributions .",
    "note that , since we standardize the mean , @xmath44 and the variation coefficient @xmath33 and @xmath45 are not independent .",
    "however , it is still useful to consider both in order to predict the shape of fundamental diagrams .    in general",
    ", to avoid degeneracies we assume the renewal processes @xmath10 to be stationary and ergodic , i.e. , waiting times have a continuous distribution with positive variance , and the time of the first jump attempt @xmath46 is distributed as @xmath37 independently for each @xmath7 , to ensure stationarity .",
    "we denote by @xmath47 the number of successful jumps per lattice site up to time @xmath48 .",
    "then , if we fix @xmath49 particles on the periodic lattice with @xmath50 sites , we have @xmath51 \\label{eq : jln}\\ ] ] for the average stationary current . here",
    "the expectation is w.r.t .",
    "the time evolution of the process started in the stationary state , and convergence holds as a result of the standard renewal theorem ( see e.g. ,  @xcite ) .",
    "we are interested in the thermodynamic limit @xmath52 and in the markovian case this is simply given by the stationary expectation of the jump rate .",
    "for translation invariant systems , the stationary state @xmath53 is known to factorize with bernoulli marginals @xmath54 ( see e.g. ,  @xcite ) .",
    "therefore @xmath55 which is the established fundamental diagram for the standard tasep . in the non - markovian case , the stationary state @xmath56 for @xmath57 exhibits non - trivial correlations ( cf",
    ".  figure  [ fig : tagged ] ) , and analytic characterizations of the @xmath56 are not available to our knowledge .",
    "existence and uniqueness of stationary states , and in particular ergodic convergence , are interesting mathematical problems and current work in progress .",
    "heuristically , a temporal correlation length @xmath58 induced by the waiting time distribution is proportional to the inverse coefficient of variation . with",
    "normalized mean we get @xmath59 for the distribution ( [ eq : fdelta ] ) , which is equal to @xmath34 in the markovian case and diverges as @xmath17 .",
    "since these time correlations are finite , we expect the process to be ergodic and to converge to the unique stationary distribution @xmath56 .",
    "indeed , measurements of fundamental diagrams from monte carlo simulations shown in figure [ fig : fd ] support this .",
    "in the limit of low and high density , the slope of the fundamental diagram can be understood by the expected jump rate of a single particle or vacancy , respectively . in large systems",
    "@xmath60 the arrival time of an isolated particle on a site @xmath7 is effectively independent of the renewal process @xmath10 .",
    "so the holding time for the particle at this site will be given by the residual lifetime @xmath37 , leading to an average jump rate of @xmath61 .",
    "this is confirmed in figure [ fig : fd ] for the distributions ( [ eq : fdelta ] ) , where we see that @xmath62 in the deterministic limit @xmath17 the fundamental diagram approaches the limiting triangle . in this case , there are no blocked jump attempts for densities @xmath63 since particles are separated by holes and move in synchrony like a single particle ( cf .  figure  [ fig : tagged ] ) . for densities",
    "@xmath64 the same argument holds for holes by symmetry of the dynamics and particle positions are highly correlated so as to maximize the current .",
    "all simulation results have been checked to be robust in the system size and we keep @xmath65 for all simulation data presented .    for intermediate range values",
    "@xmath22 we expect a competition between current maximization and entropic fluctuations reminiscent of the classical paradigm of gibbs measures in statistical mechanics , with the current playing the role of negative energy . in the site - based process",
    ", maximization of the current @xmath66 over a unit time interval ( [ eq : jlt ] ) is essentially equivalent to maximizing the expected instantaneous current given by @xmath67 which is simply the total jump rate in the markovian case .",
    "therefore , we can estimate the fundamental diagram by a stationary expectation w.r.t .",
    "@xmath56 without taking holding times into account .",
    "this is not possible for the particle - based model as we discuss later .",
    "note that we omit the prefactor @xmath68 in the function @xmath69 and focus only on the @xmath25-dependent part , since this simplifies the presentation .",
    "our main hypothesis is that we can approximate a grand - canonical version of @xmath56 by a tilt @xmath70 of the grand - canonical markovian distribution @xmath71 , where the chemical potential @xmath72 is the usual conjugate parameter to @xmath73 .",
    "then we have @xmath74 where @xmath75 is the effective inverse ` temperature ' conjugate to @xmath76 , and @xmath77 denotes expectation w.r.t .  the distribution @xmath71 .",
    "in other words , we use the known @xmath71 as the reference distribution at infinite temperature ( @xmath78 ) , and for finite temperature we re - weight configurations according to their instantaneous current ( [ eq : opti ] ) .",
    "the associated free energy @xmath79 can be computed using the transfer matrix @xmath80 , see e.g.  @xcite , section 5.1 .",
    "specifically , @xmath81 is given by the trace @xmath82 and hence , taking the @xmath83 limit , the free energy is determined by the largest eigenvalue of @xmath84 as @xmath85 the stationary current and the density as a function of the chemical potential are then given by @xmath86 evaluation provides lengthy formulae that can also be solved for @xmath87 which we do not display here .",
    "the maximal current at density @xmath42 ( corresponding to @xmath88 ) is given by the simple expression @xmath89 and it remains to fix the parameter @xmath90 as a function of the delay @xmath76 .",
    "fitting @xmath90 with ( [ eq : mc ] ) to simulation data provides a perfect match for the full fundamental diagram , as is shown in figure [ fig : fdpa ] ( left ) for delayed exponential and in figure [ fig : fdvar ] ( left ) for pareto distributions .",
    "the observed fit values can be supported by the following heuristics .",
    "the correlation dependent part of the maximal current is given by the correlation function @xmath91 taking values in @xmath92 .",
    "properly normalized and interpreted as the parameter of a geometric distribution counting the number of correlated neighbouring sites , this induces a spatial correlation length @xmath93 since the spatial and the temporal correlation length @xmath58 ( [ eq : theta ] ) are finite , the large scale behaviour of the non - markovian generalization should exhibit kpz scaling like the usual tasep @xcite .",
    "the correlation lengths should therefore be related as @xmath94 which is confirmed to good approximation in figure [ fig : fdpa ] ( right ) for different distributions . since the temporal correlation @xmath58 is fully determined by properties of the renewal process ,",
    "this relation ( with normalization given by the markovian case ) provides a method to predict the parameter @xmath90 which characterizes the spatial correlation , without having to fit to data .",
    "note that an increase in spatial correlation lengths in general also leads to increased finite size - effects .",
    "however , since we consider periodic boundary conditions and the current is a self - averaging observable , those effects are still negligible for the system size of @xmath95 which we present simulation data for .    due to ( [ eq : varres ] ) the residual lifetime",
    "@xmath45 fully determines the temporal correlation length ( [ eq : theta ] ) for waiting time distributions with standardized mean .",
    "so if ( [ eq : scaling ] ) were to hold strictly , the fundamental diagrams should depend only on the first and second moment of the waiting time distribution and therefore be fully determined by @xmath45 .",
    "while this is true close to the deterministic limit where higher order cumulants of the waiting time distribution become negligible , we can see in figure [ fig : fdvar ] ( left ) that for larger variation coefficients this is not the case ( as to be expected ) .",
    "the larger the higher order moments , the lower we expect the maximal current to be due to enhanced fluctuations .",
    "this is confirmed in figure [ fig : fdvar ] ( right ) where we plot the variation coefficient , @xmath96 of the residual lifetime as a function of the mean @xmath45 for different distributions .",
    "@xmath97 corresponds to a particular moment of third order , and we see that it is inversely correlated to the maximal current , which takes the lowest values for pareto distributions .",
    "close to the deterministic limit with @xmath98 the fundamental diagrams and @xmath97 essentially coincide for all the distributions .",
    "even though our main focus of presentation was on enhanced current for waiting time distributions which are more regular than the exponential distribution , our theory also works well for reduced currents due to heavy tails . using the general formula ( [ eq : resdist ] )",
    "we can compute @xmath99 analogously to ( [ eq : res ] ) .",
    "note that for @xmath100 , @xmath45 is greater than the markovian value of 1 , leading to a suppression of the current ( negative values of @xmath90 ) .",
    "in fact , due to the heavy tail , ( [ eq : partr ] ) holds only for @xmath101 and @xmath102 diverges for @xmath103 . according to our theory",
    "the fundamental diagram should essentially vanish for such parameter values , which is confirmed by the lowest data points on the left panel of figure [ fig : fdvar ] .",
    "the current is greatly reduced due to jamming events which have been studied in detail in @xcite . already for @xmath76 close to but greater than @xmath42 the empirical average is increasingly dominated by extreme values of the sample resulting from large fluctuations of the current , which requires a much more careful averaging and increased sample size than for higher values of @xmath76 .",
    "this already becomes visible , near the maximal current , for data with @xmath104 which we show in figure [ fig : corr ] ( right panel ) , where the error bars are still of the order of the symbol size .",
    "if the renewal processes of jump times @xmath31 are attached to particles with indices @xmath32 , the system loses the particle - hole symmetry and fundamental diagrams are no longer symmetric .",
    "an isolated single particle will then jump with an average rate @xmath34 , whereas a single hole will have average waiting time @xmath105 completely analogously to the bond - based model .",
    "our first main result ( [ eq : result1 ] ) on the asymptotic behaviour of the fundamental diagram can be directly adapted to give @xmath106 this is well confirmed by simulation data as shown in figure [ fig : corr ] .",
    "the maximal current at density @xmath107 for @xmath17 can alternatively be explained by realizing that the update order of the particles will be frozen on a very long time scale .",
    "therefore particles can form long - lived blocks where they move essentially in parallel one after the other within one unit of time . to achieve maximal current",
    ", these blocks have to be separated by an empty site .",
    "since the update order is a uniform permutation due to independence of the renewal processes , the average block length is @xmath108 which leads to a maximal current at density @xmath109 . in this",
    "limit our model is equivalent to the tasep with frozen shuffle update studied in @xcite .",
    "note that in the bond - based model the update order of neighbouring particles changes all the time even in the limit @xmath17 , so the formation of long lived blocks is not possible .",
    "due to these blocks in the particle - based model , our simplified ansatz for the stationary distribution @xmath56 can not be applied and a more detailed analysis including jump times is necessary .",
    "one possible approach is to describe the dynamics of inter - particle distances as a zero - range process , which is a standard mapping for the markovian tasep ( see e.g.  @xcite ) that also applies for the particle - based non - markovian model .",
    "the zero - range process is basically a system of queues in tandem , which have been studied for non - exponential arrival and service time distributions .",
    "this leads to approximate formulae in terms of laplace transforms of jump time statistics @xcite ; a thorough investigation of this approach is the subject of current work in progress .",
    "note that , for the bond - based model , departure and arrival processes of consecutive queues would be correlated and results in @xcite do not apply .    in summary , we have demonstrated a method to derive macroscopic transport properties , in the form of the fundamental diagram , for non - markovian exclusion processes .",
    "the asymptotic results ( [ eq : result1 ] ) involving residual lifetimes are of a very general nature and can be applied directly to other driven diffusive systems , including also partially asymmetric dynamics .",
    "the applicability of our ansatz ( [ eq : tilt ] ) for the intermediate regime will depend on details of the model and may have to be adapted with an enlarged state space .",
    "however , the underlying principle of a description of correlated stationary states on the basis of maximization of the instantaneous current should apply in a very general sense .",
    "we have thus reported here a first step towards a broader understanding of the large - scale dynamics of non - markovian driven diffusive systems which is highly relevant in applications and poses very interesting theoretical questions for future research .",
