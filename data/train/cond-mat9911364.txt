    "recently there has been a considerable interest in the magnetization process of one - dimensional quantum spin systems . extending the lieb - schultz - mattis theorem,@xcite oshikawa _",
    "et al._@xcite gave a necessary condition for the appearance of the magnetization plateau as @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the magnitude of the spin , @xmath11 is the periodicity of the magnetic ground state in the thermodynamic limit , and @xmath12 is the magnetization per site .    as a simple case ,",
    "the @xmath0 spin chain with single ion anisotropy in a magnetic filed @xmath13 , @xmath14 has been studied .",
    "here @xmath15 is the @xmath0 spin at the @xmath16-th site , and @xmath17 is the magnetization @xmath18 .",
    "hereafter , we define the saturation magnetization as @xmath19 . in this model , a magnetization plateau can appear at @xmath2 ( @xmath20 ) .",
    "for @xmath21 ( @xmath0 heisenberg model ) , a magnetization plateau does not appear.@xcite on the other hand for large @xmath22 , the spin of each site tend to have @xmath23 for @xmath2 , and a magnetization plateau appears .",
    "@xcite checked that a magnetization plateau appears for @xmath24 .",
    "sakai and takahashi @xcite studied the model with the numerical diagonalization calculation using the phenomenological renormalization group ( prg ) analysis , and found that the transition point is @xmath25 .",
    "they concluded this point as the berezinskii - kosterlitz - thouless ( bkt ) transition @xcite point , that is , the plateau and the no - plateau transition point .",
    "although the prg analysis is a powerful method to study the second order phase transition , this is not sufficient for the bkt transition because of the singular behavior of the energy gap and of the logarithmic size dependence of excitation energies .",
    "thus we think that it is worthwhile to reexamine this problem by use of another numerical approach .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows . in the next section",
    ", we consider an effective continuum model in order to investigate the mechanism of the appearance of the @xmath2 magnetization . in section 3",
    ", we show the numerical method and the results with the numerical diagonalization data . to study the system , we firstly consider the finite - size behavior with conformal field theory and the renormalization group analysis .",
    "next , using them , we determine the boundary of the plateau and the no - plateau regions , and also check the critical behavior .",
    "last section is devoted to summary and discussion .",
    "for the magnetization @xmath2 , the effective continuum model describing the low energy physics is given by @xcite @xmath26     \\nonumber \\\\    & & + v_{s}y_{\\phi}\\int \\frac{{\\rm d}x}{2\\pi}\\cos\\sqrt{2}\\phi , \\label{eq : sg}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath27 is the momentum density conjugate to @xmath28 , @xmath29 = i\\delta(x - x')$ ] , @xmath30 is the sound velocity of the system .",
    "the dual field @xmath31 is defined as @xmath32 .",
    "the correlation exponents of several operators are governed by the coupling @xmath33 and the scaling dimension of the operator @xmath34 is @xmath35 .",
    "thus the second term in the hamiltonian ( [ eq : hamiltonian ] ) is relevant for @xmath36 and irrelevant for @xmath37 .",
    "the one - loop renormalization group equations of this model are given by @xmath38 where @xmath39 is an infrared cutoff .",
    "these are the recursion relations of kosterlitz .",
    "@xcite the renormalization group flow is shown in figure 1 . in the region",
    "a , the coupling @xmath33 renormalized to a finite value and @xmath40 to zero ; the system is critical and this corresponds to the no - plateau region in the spin system . in the regions b and b , @xmath33 renormalized to @xmath41 and @xmath42 to @xmath43 ; these regions are massive phases and the field @xmath28 is locked to @xmath44 and @xmath41 for b and b respectively .",
    "there is a separatrix @xmath45 which separates the infrared stable region ( a ) from the infrared unstable regions ( b and b ) . on this separatrix",
    "the bkt transition takes place . near @xmath46 , and with the notation @xmath47 , the bkt transition point is on the line @xmath48 and we obtain @xmath49 where @xmath50 and @xmath51 are the bare values .    according to the numerical calculation by oshikawa _",
    "@xcite for the @xmath0 heisenberg chain ( @xmath21 ) at the magnetization @xmath2 , this gaussian coupling @xmath33 is @xmath52 , ( in the notation of ref .",
    "@xcite the compactification radius is given by @xmath53 ) , and the system is gapless ( no plateau ) .",
    "this value is slightly larger than the bkt critical ( fixed point ) coupling @xmath54 .",
    "in order to study numerically , let us consider the finite - size behavior of the effective model ( [ eq : sg ] ) based on the conformal invariance.@xcite the scaling dimension of the primary field @xmath55 for the fixed point hamiltonian ( @xmath56 ) with the periodic boundary condition ( pbc ) is given by @xmath57 where @xmath58 and @xmath59 are the `` magnetic '' and the `` electric '' charges in the coulomb gas.@xcite according to the conformal field theory , the state of the finite - size system have a correspondence to the operator in the infinite - size system , and the excitation energy of the finite - size system is given by @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the ground state energy of @xmath39-site with pbc .",
    "the bkt transition takes place between the gapless and gapful regions , and the prg analysis is affected by several irrelevant corrections sensitively .",
    "moreover , on the transition point , there exists a logarithmic size correction in the excitation energy .",

    "this can be calculated using the lowest energy with @xmath2 and the wave - number @xmath113 ( corresponding to the u(1 ) current ) , @xmath114 we extrapolate this finite size value in the polynomial of @xmath115 , and obtain @xmath116 .",

    "this partially magnetized vbs state had firstly been discussed by oshikawa@xcite for another model.(see also ref .",
    "@xcite )    let us consider the crossing behavior near the point @xmath134 on another point of view .",

    "the width of the magnetization plateau decreases as @xmath152 , where the critical exponent @xmath153 is given by @xmath154",
    "we studied the @xmath0 spin chain with the single ion anisotropy in a magnetic field ( [ eq : hamiltonian ] ) . with the numerical approach based on the field theoretical analysis",
    ", we found a new region between the no - plateau ( small @xmath22 ) and the magnetized large-@xmath22 ( large @xmath22 ) regions .",
    "as far as we know , this is the first work in which no - plateau state and two kinds of plateau states are found when the parameter is changed in a simple and realistic model .",
    "this intermediate region should have the same character of the partially magnetized valence - bond - solid state , and should be characterized by the string order parameter@xcite and by the edge states for the open boundary system@xcite reflecting a hidden discrete symmetry.@xcite but in our small size calculation , we could not collect evidence , which remains for future study .",
    "restricting to three states @xmath155 , @xmath112 , and @xmath156 , ( in sufficiently large magnetic field ) sakai and takahashi mapped the @xmath0 model to an @xmath143 generalized anisotropic model with @xmath157 . in order to investigate the relation between the @xmath143 with @xmath157 and the @xmath0 model in a magnetic field",
