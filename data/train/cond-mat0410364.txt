    "the past few years have witnessed a surge in the geometrical approach to phase transitions .",
    "the prototype of such an approach is percolation theory @xcite , which focuses on clusters of ( randomly ) occupied sites or bonds on a lattice . the fractal structure of these geometrical objects and whether or not a cluster percolates the lattice are central topics addressed by the theory .",
    "spin models such as the @xmath0-state potts models can easily be mapped onto percolation theory , with neighboring spins in the same spin state lumped together in a cluster .",
    "generally , the geometrical spin clusters thus constructed do not percolate at the critical temperature @xmath1 where the thermal phase transition takes place .",
    "but by erasing with a certain temperature - dependent probability bonds between like spins , fortuin and kasteleyn ( fk ) @xcite showed that spin clusters can be constructed for the potts models that do percolate at @xmath1 and encode the thermal critical behavior .",
    "they thus achieved a geometrical description of the thermal phase transition in these models .",
    "the cluster approach has been turned into an efficient monte carlo algorithm by swendsen and wang @xcite , and by wolff @xcite , where not individual spins are updated , as in local spin updates with , e.g. , the metropolis algorithm , but entire fk clusters .",
    "an exception to the rule that geometrical clusters do not percolate at @xmath1 is the two - dimensional ( 2d ) @xmath0-state potts model .",
    "the origin of this effect can be understood by extending the pure lattice model to include vacant sites . in a kadanoff block - spin approach ,",
    "such an extension is natural as the vacant sites represent disordered blocks without a majority in any of the spin states , and is essential for establishing that the phase transition of the pure models changes from being continuous to first order at @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "in addition to the pure potts critical behavior , the site diluted model also displays tricritical behavior at the same critical temperature @xmath1 .",
    "while the critical behavior of the pure model is encoded in the fk clusters , the tricritical behavior is encoded in the geometrical clusters @xcite .",
    "both cluster types percolate at @xmath1 . with increasing @xmath0 , the critical and tricritical fixed points , which are characterized by the same central charge @xmath3 , move together until merging at @xmath2 .",
    "very recently , cluster boundaries of critical 2d systems have been studied analytically by means of the so - called stochastic loewner evolution , introduced by schramm @xcite .",
    "various exact predictions for critical exponents previously conjectured on the basis of the coulomb - gas map @xcite and conformal invariance @xcite could rigorously be established by this method ( for an overview see ref .",
    "[ ] ) .    in this paper , we numerically investigate the fractal structure of clusters in the 2d ising model , corresponding to setting @xmath4 .",
    "we simulate the model on relatively small lattices ( @xmath5 ) with periodic boundary conditions , and apply standard finite - size scaling to determine the various fractal dimensions .",
    "in addition to studying the size or `` mass '' of fk and geometrical clusters , we also examine their boundaries .",
    "those of geometrical clusters form the famous peierls domain walls @xcite , separating spin clusters of opposite orientation . in a previous paper @xcite ,",
    "we simulated these domain walls directly by considering the high - temperature representation of the model . by duality , the high - temperature graphs , which are closed , are domain walls on the dual lattice .",
    "the closed graph configurations were generated by means of a metropolis update algorithm , involving single plaquettes .",
    "other recent numerical studies of the geometrical structure of 2d potts models were reported in refs .",
    "our results for the fractal dimensions are in excellent agreement with theoretical predictions @xcite , and provide in particular for the fk and geometrical clusters a considerable improvement in precision over the estimates obtained in refs .",
    ".    the rest of the paper is structured as follows .",
    "the next section summarizes the necessary theoretical background .",
    "numerical results are presented in sec .",
    "[ sec : mc ] , followed by concluding remarks in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclude ] .",
    "the fractal properties of spin clusters and boundaries , which are clusters themselves , are described by a straightforward extension of ordinary percolation theory @xcite .",
    "asymptotically , cluster distributions @xmath6 take a general form @xmath7 consisting of two factors : ( i ) an entropy factor , which measures the number of ways a cluster of size @xmath8 can be embedded in the lattice , and ( ii ) a boltzmann weight , which suppresses large clusters when @xmath9 is finite .",
    "clusters proliferate and percolate the lattice when @xmath9 tends to zero .",
    "the vanishing is characterized by an exponent @xmath10 as @xmath11 , where @xmath12 denotes the percolation temperature .",
    "as explained in the introduction , the percolation thresholds of both fk and geometrical clusters coincide with the thermal critical temperature of the 2d ising model .",
    "the entropy exponent @xmath13 determines the fractal structure of the geometrical objects . rather than extracting this exponent directly from the asymptotic behavior of a distribution at the percolation threshold , where the distribution becomes algebraic , it is expedient to extract it from derived quantities such as the percolation strength @xmath14 , giving the fraction of sites in the largest cluster , and the average cluster size @xcite @xmath15 since every site belongs to some geometrical and some fk cluster , the denominator in eq .",
    "( [ chi ] ) adds up to the total number of sites for these clusters .",
    "close to the percolation threshold , the observables obey the finite - size scaling laws @xcite @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the lattice size and @xmath18 the correlation length whose divergence at criticality is governed by the exponent @xmath19 .",
    "the ratios @xmath20 and @xmath21 are given in terms of @xmath13 as @xcite @xmath22 with @xmath23 the dimensionality of the lattice .",
    "the fractal dimension @xmath24 , which is also determined solely by the entropy exponent @xmath13 , is related to these exponents via @xcite @xmath25    generically , two ( and only two ) different cluster boundaries can be identified @xcite : the hull ( h ) and the external perimeter ( ep ) , where the second can be understood as a smoother version of the first . for 2d fk clusters ,",
    "the two boundaries are in one - to - one correspondence , with their fractal dimensions satisfying the relation @xcite @xmath26 the map transforming one fk boundary dimension into the other conserves the central charge @xmath3 , which may be parametrized as @xcite @xmath27 where @xmath28 parametrizes the two - dimensional @xmath0-state potts models @xmath29 with @xmath30 . in terms of @xmath31",
    ", the fractal dimensions of the fk boundaries @xcite can be expressed as @xmath32 while the central charge conserving map corresponds to letting @xmath33 .",
    "these explicit forms are seen to satisfy the duality relation ( [ drel ] ) . with the scaling relations ( [ dbg ] ) ,",
    "the critical exponent ratios characterizing the fk boundaries become @xmath34 where a single correlation length with exponent @xmath19 is assumed .",
    "it thus follows that the two fk boundary sizes scale with inverse exponents : @xmath35    in contrast to fk clusters , geometrical clusters are characterized by only one boundary dimension , i.e. , the fractal dimensions @xmath36 and @xmath37 of the hull and external perimeter coincide , @xmath38 .",
    "such cases are signaled by a negative fractal dimension of the red sites @xcite , sites that , when removed , lead to a splitting of the cluster into disconnected parts .",
    "the central charge conserving map @xmath39 transforming the hull dimension @xmath40 of fk clusters into that of their external perimeters , @xmath41 , also maps it onto the hull dimension of geometrical clusters , implying @xcite @xmath42 this relation is remarkable as it involves the two different boundary types . in the context of uncorrelated percolation @xcite ,",
    "the hull of a cluster in 2d is traced out by a directed random walker constrained to move on the cluster only , whereas the external perimeter is traced out by a walker constrained to move around the hull on sites neighboring , but not belonging to , that cluster .    to numerically verify relation ( [ dh - dep ] ) , we wish to treat external perimeters of fk clusters and hulls of geometrical clusters in the same manner . to this end",
    "we apply the same algorithm used to trace out geometrical hulls to find the fk external perimeters , where it is recalled that fk clusters differ from geometrical clusters in that with a prescribed temperature - dependent probability bonds are erased .",
    "the difference between tracing out fk hulls and external perimeters then reduces to ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : rw_algo ] ) allowing the random walker to move to a nearest neighbor site on the fk boundary only provided the connecting bond is set ( hull ) or always ( external perimeter ) .",

    "fig : geo_dis],width=302 ]      the corrections to scaling are less pronounced for the external perimeters of fk clusters as they are generally smaller than geometrical clusters and thus less likely to percolate ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : sw_ep ] ) .",
    "also the asymptotic behavior is reached earlier than for geometrical hulls .",
    "the smallness of the corrections allows us to obtain reasonable fits for the average external perimeter size .",

    "[ fig : boundaries ] , the distributions of the three different boundaries studied are plotted for @xmath55 to show the crossover of the external perimeters of fk clusters .",
    "starting similarly to the fk hull distribution , the fk external perimeter distribution asymptotically approaches that of the geometrical hulls , in accordance with relation ( [ dh - dep ] ) .",
    "in other words , the fk external perimeter distribution interpolates between that of the fk ( for small @xmath8 ) and geometrical hulls ( asymptotically for large @xmath8 ) .     for @xmath55 . statistical error bars",

    ", the normalized distributions tend to a universal curve .",
    "the slow approach to the asymptotic form of the geometrical hull distribution ( and to a lesser extent that of the fk external perimeter distribution ) , with the associated strong corrections to scaling we observed for these objects , stands out clearly from the other distributions .",
    "it is tempting to directly analyze the distributions @xmath6 and to extract the exponent @xmath13 from the asymptotic behavior of @xmath6 , which is algebraic at criticality .",
    "however , this method gives far less accurate results than applying finite - size scaling to observables involving the sum @xmath78 over the cluster sizes @xmath8 .",
    "the main drawback of the method is the great sensitivity to the location of the fitting window , i.e. , the interval of @xmath8 .",
    "the fitting range can not be started at too small cluster sizes , where the distribution has not taken on its asymptotic form yet , while too large cluster sizes , which are generated only a few times during a complete monte carlo run , are also to be excluded because of the noise in the data and finite size effects . even in those cases for which we obtained very accurate results through finite - size scaling analyses , the direct analysis of the distributions gave unsatisfactory results .",
    "in this paper , the fractal dimensions of spin clusters and their boundaries appearing in the critical 2d ising model were studied numerically .",
    "the monte carlo simulations were carried out on comparatively small lattices .",
    "standard finite - size scaling was applied to obtain very precise estimates for the cluster dimensions , significantly improving existing ones .",
    "the results confirm the exact theoretical predictions to a high degree of precision .",
    "for the boundary dimensions , although improving existing estimates , we obtained less accurate results because of corrections to scaling .",
    "we observed the strongest corrections for the geometrical hulls , whose distribution approaches its asymptotic form very slowly . in a previous numerical investigation @xcite , where we simulated the hulls of the spins on the dual lattice directly , corrections to scaling",
    "were virtually absent , allowing us to establish the geometrical hull dimension to fairly high precision .    to our surprise",
    ", we found the fractal dimension of the fk hulls to converge to the predicted value only when restricting the fitting window to increasingly smaller lattice sizes .",
    "in general , one expects of course such a convergence when increasing the lattice size , rather than decreasing it , so as to minimize corrections to scaling .",
    "the measured average fk hull size on larger lattices falls below the line extrapolated from smaller lattices .",
    "the cause for this behavior eludes us .    to verify relation ( [ dh - dep ] ) , involving the two different boundary types that can be defined for a cluster , viz .",
    "hulls and external perimeters , we treated the two boundary types in a similar manner .",
    "usually , hulls are traced out by a directed random walker on the cluster whereas external perimeters are traced out by a directed random walker probing the cluster from the outside .",
    "we , on the other hand , applied the hull algorithm also to the external perimeters of fk clusters , with the proviso that the random walker can move to a nearest neighbor site on the fk boundary even when the connecting bond is not set ( for the hull , the bond must be set ) .",
