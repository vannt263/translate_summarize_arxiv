    "model particle detectors are important mathematical tools used to explore the properties of quantum fields in flat and curved spacetimes .",
    "these detectors , known in the literature as unruh - dewitt ( udw ) detectors , originate in the work of unruh and dewitt to analyse the response of a uniformly accelerated atom in minkowski spacetime refs .  .",
    "they have been widely used to analyse effects due to observer motion and spacetime kinematics , including the hawking radiation emitted by black holes ( see refs .   for a small selection of references ) .    in this paper , we analyse an udw detector which couples linearly to the scalar density of a massless dirac field on the static cylindrical quotient of the @xmath0-dimensional minkowski spacetime , allowing the detector s motion to remain arbitrary , to leading order in perturbation theory .",
    "we compute explicit expression for the response functions for the inequivalent spin structures which exhibit no infrared divergence for arbitrary detector s motion along the cylinder , assuming smooth switching .",
    "the main theoretical reasons for considering this model spacetime is firstly because on the cylinder we have two inequivalent spin structures .",
    "we want to find out whether our detector distinguish between the two spin structures .",
    "secondly , the untwisted spin structure contains a mode with vanishing frequency known as a zero mode which does not have a fock vacuum .",
    "we resolve this ambiguity by treating the zero mode as a state with two fermi degrees of freedom .",
    "we then show that the zero mode contributes to the periodic spin structure response by a state - dependent but well defined and controllable amount .",
    "throughout we use units in which @xmath1 , and we work in two - dimensional minkowski spacetime with signature @xmath2 where the minus direction is spacelike .",
    "we will replace @xmath3 whenever we find it more convenient .",
    "in this section we describe an udw detector coupled linearly to the scalar density of the dirac field of the form @xmath4 , where @xmath5 satisfies the dirac field equation , and where the dirac adjoint field is defined as @xmath6 .",
    "this model is that of an idealized atom with a set of energy eigenstates @xmath7 and which is constrained to move along some prescribed classical trajectory : @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the detector s proper time .",
    "the field is weakly coupled to the detector via the interaction hamiltonian @xmath10 where @xmath11 is a coupling constant , @xmath12 is a smooth switching function of finite duration , and @xmath13 is the detector s monopole moment operator . working to leading order in perturbation theory ,",
    "the detector s transition probability is proportional to the response function , given by @xmath14 where the transition energy , @xmath15 , is such that @xmath16 corresponds to excitation while @xmath17 corresponds to de - excitation .",
    "the two - point correlation function , assuming that the initial field state is prepared in a ( 1 + 1 ) vacuum state with respect to minkowski time translation denoted by @xmath18 , is @xmath19 knowledge of this two - point correlation function is required in order to obtain an explicit expression for the detector response function .",
    "consider the cylindrical quotient space of the minkowski spacetime , with line element @xmath20 where @xmath21 is periodic with period @xmath22 .",
    "in this spacetime , the complete mode solutions to the dirac field become    [ fieldsmodes ] @xmath23    where @xmath24 , assuming @xmath25 . imposing periodic boundary condition , @xmath26 , we find @xmath27 alternatively , we may impose anti - periodic boundary condition , @xmath28 , for which we find @xmath29 which is known as the twisted spinor field .    the dirac field",
    "can now be expanded in terms of the positive and negative frequency modes as @xmath30 \\equiv \\psi^+(x ) + \\psi^-(x ) .\\ ] ] similarly , the dirac adjoint field is given by @xmath31 \\equiv \\overline{\\psi}^-(x)+ \\overline{\\psi}^+(x )   .\\ ] ] the field is normalised in such a way that    [ anticommrel ] @xmath32    analogous to the continuous modes , we find that for the discrete modes the following relations still hold @xmath33 and @xmath34_{ab } i\\delta^+(x , y ) \\nonumber \\\\ & \\equiv i\\bigg[s^+(x , y ) \\bigg]_{ab }   , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath35 and similarly we find , @xmath36_{ab } i\\delta^-(x , y ) \\nonumber \\\\ & \\equiv i\\bigg[s^-(x , y ) \\bigg]_{ab } , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath37 and where @xmath38 @xmath39 are the fermionic wightman two - point functions and @xmath40 are the bosonic wightman two - point functions . the subscript @xmath41 in the dirac operator is used to emphasize that differentiation is carried out with respect to the @xmath41 variable only . in the massless limit @xmath42 , we find that the two - point correlation function reduces to @xmath43.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]      in the massless limit , we obtain the following response function for the twisted spinor @xmath44      \\right].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] clearly this expression exhibits no infrared divergence .",
    "consider now the untwisted spinor , whose frequencies are given by @xmath45^{1/2}. \\nonumber\\ ] ] thus as @xmath46 , @xmath47 when @xmath48 , leading to @xmath49 since the field modes are inversely proportional to @xmath50 as shown in .",
    "we identify this vanishing frequency mode as the zero mode , which clearly is ill - defined . to deal with this",
    ", we split the fermionic fields as    @xmath51    where the oscillator modes , @xmath52 , corresponding to @xmath53 contains the fourier modes that are not spatially constant . and the zero mode @xmath54 corresponding to @xmath55 contains the fourier modes that are spatially constant .",
    "these modes are normalised via the anticommutator relations    [ anticommu ] @xmath56    where all the anticommutator relations between mixed field modes vanish .",
    "these relations are defined in agreement with .",
    "the oscillator modes contribution to the minkowskian vacuum is @xmath57 where we define @xmath58 as the oscillator modes fermion wightman function . using this result ,",
    "we then obtain the oscillator mode contribution to the detector response function for the untwisted spinor @xmath59\\bigg],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which clearly exhibits no infrared divergence .",
    "the zero mode two - point correlation is spatially independent , and moreover this mode does not begin in a fock vacuum .",
    "it reads @xmath60 the zero mode hamiltonian is such that @xmath61 = 0 $ ] @xmath62 , therefore reduces to @xmath63 we can write @xmath64 as a state with two fermi degrees of freedom as in ref .  ,",
    "@xmath65 where the fermi degrees of freedom @xmath66 and @xmath67 have the following properties    [ fermideg ] @xmath68    the normalized heisenberg picture zero - mode quantum state can now be constructed as a linear combination of the four independent states @xmath69 where @xmath70 are complex numbers .",
    "we then obtain the zero mode two - point correlation function @xmath71 where @xmath72 .",
    "thus , the zero mode two - point correlation function is well defined .",
    "consequently , its contribution to the detector response function reads @xmath73 where @xmath74 is the fourier transform of @xmath75 .",
    "moreover we find that the two - point correlation function for the untwisted spinor fully decouples to @xmath76 consequently the response function for the untwisted spinor is given by @xmath77 where the zero mode component is independent of the detector s trajectory .",
    "in this paper , we examined a udw particle detector that is coupled linearly to the scalar density of a massless dirac field on the static cylindrical quotient of the ( 1 + 1)-dimensional minkowski spacetime .",
    "we showed that the twisted spin structure exhibits no infrared divergence and we obtained its response function for arbitrary detector s motion on the cylinder .",
    "we then quantized the zero mode present for the untwisted spin structure by treating it as a state with two fermi degrees of freedom .",
    "we showed that the zero mode contributes to the untwisted spin structure response function by a state - dependent but well defined and controllable amount ."
