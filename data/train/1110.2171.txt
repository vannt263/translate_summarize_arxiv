    "although thermal effects have been computed for static thermodynamic quantities such as the effective potential , the free energy , the pressure , and so on @xcite , sometimes to very high orders in the perturbative expansion in qcd and qed ( for recent reviews , see refs.@xcite ) , less is known about finite - temperature corrections to cross sections and decay rates .",
    "radiative corrections to dynamical scattering and decay processes at a finite temperature @xmath5 are peculiar for three reasons .",

    "this issue can be sharply defined by considering temperatures that are small compared to masses of decaying particles and their decay products .",
    "an interesting set of questions arises if we depart from the low - temperature regime and consider the `` intermediate''-temperature scenario , where the mass of the decaying particle is large and masses of decay products are small , compared to the heat - bath temperature . in such a case , radiative corrections enhanced by the logarithms of the mass ratios can become numerically important in the context of a variety of scenarios that occur in the early universe .",
    "for example , light gravitinos that arise in theories of supergravity with gauge - mediated supersymmetry breaking may be produced by the decay of short - lived charged staus to taus @xcite .",
    "temperatures greater than the tau mass will then fall into the `` intermediate''-temperature scenario .",
    "if mass - enhanced corrections are indeed present , large modifications of the stau decay rate and the production rate of light gravitino dark matter become conceivable . such modifications",
    "may affect the early - universe thermal history and have implications for collider phenomenology @xcite .",
    "furthermore , in some regions of the supersymmetric parameter space , the process of co - annihilation is important in the determination of the dark - matter relic abundance after freeze - out @xcite .",
    "freeze - out occurs roughly at temperatures @xmath178 that may be greater than the masses of some of the products of supersymmetric particle decay , so this indeed presents another intermediate - temperature scenario .",
    "finite - temperature effects and mass singularities may then become important in determining the individual scattering and decay rates for charged particles , which would be important if one is interested in the detailed thermal history of these particles .",
    "however , note that the final dark - matter relic abundance is most likely not strongly affected by finite - temperature effects , since only the co - annihilation rates ( and not other scattering or decay rates ) enter the calculation @xcite .",
    "for example , in ref .",
    "@xcite it was found that finite - temperature corrections to co - annihilation occur only at the @xmath179 level .",
    "finite - temperature effects may also affect neutrino decoupling @xcite .",
    "it has also been suggested that the original calculations of temperature - dependent corrections to neutron decay are incomplete @xcite .",
    "clearly , there remains much work to be done concerning finite - temperature effects in the early universe .",
