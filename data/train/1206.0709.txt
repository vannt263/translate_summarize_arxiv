    "nowadays the violation of the lorentz symmetry has attracted increasing attention , because the lorentz symmetry is the main concept of special relativity and any relativistic theory which is invariant under continuous lorentz transformations .",
    "a growing number of speculations suggests that lorentz invariance might be violated or deformed at very high energies @xcite@xcite .",
    "the local lorentz symmetry has been examined in many sectors of the standard model ( sm ) relating to photons , electrons , protons , and neutrons @xcite-@xcite , and none of lorentz invariance violation ( liv ) has been identified so far in these sectors for low - energies",
    ". the lorentz invariance should be violated at very high energy scale or the planck scale , since the lorentz group is unbounded at the high boost ( or high energy ) end , in principle it might subject to modifications in the high boost limit @xcite .",
    "the lorentz symmetry is based on the assumption that space - time is scale - free , namely there is no fundamental length scale associated with the lorentz group .",
    "however , due to violent fluctuations of quantum gravity at the planck scale @xmath0gev , @xmath1 cm , the space - time manifold is no longer continuous , but discretized , and as a consequence , the lorentz symmetry is broken .",

    "@xcite , by using the universal entropy bound , it has been shown that the space - time has a minimum length scale proportional to the planck length , leading to a discrete space - time structure .",

    "in addition , there are some other effective field theories for lorentz violation , for examples , the coleman- glashow model @xcite , the minimal standard model extension ( sme ) @xcite , and the newly proposed standard model supplement ( sms)@xcite .    in recent years",
    ", there has been much interest in testing liv effects . however , observational tests face a major obstacle of practical nature : liv effects due to quantum - gravity are expected to be extremely small because of planck - scale suppression , and low - energy measurements are likely to require very high sensitivities @xcite .",
    "this leads to the use of high energy astrophysics data to provide constraints on liv effects . for examples , gamma - ray burst ( grb )",
    "data are analyzed to see liv effects on the arrival time of photons at different energies @xcite .",
