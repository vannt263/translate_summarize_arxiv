    "it is of great scientific importance to understand the behaviors of diatomic molecules at solid surfaces , including their adsorption and dissociation , and corresponding energy barriers during the bond breaking and bond formation at the surfaces @xcite . of all prototypes ,",
    "the interaction of o@xmath0 molecules with metal surfaces has gained lots of interest for many technologically relevant processes such as heterogeneous catalysis and corrosion @xcite . theoretically , _",
    "ab initio _ modeling has been successfully used over a wide range to study the adsorption and dissociation of o@xmath0 molecules at transition metal surfaces . by calculating the adiabatic potential energy surface ( pes ) , it has been found that o@xmath0 molecules will spontaneously dissociate while adsorbing at reactive transition metal surfaces like iron ( fe ) @xcite . for noble transition metals like gold ( au )",
    "@xcite , silver ( ag ) @xcite , platinum ( pt ) @xcite and nickel ( ni ) @xcite , the adsorption of o@xmath0 turns out to depend on the ambient temperature .",
    "remarkably , in all above transition metal systems , the concept of adiabatic pes works very well in explaining and predicting a large amount of physical / chemical phenomena during dissociation process of o@xmath0 .",
    "when the attention is focused on the simple @xmath2 metals such as al(111 ) , however , an uncomfortable gap opens between _ ab initio _ prediction and experimental observation .",
    "the most notable is the long - term enigma of low initial sticking probability of thermal o@xmath0 molecules at al(111 ) , which has been measured by many independent experiments @xcite but can not be reproduced by adiabatic state - of - the - art density functional theory ( dft ) calculations @xcite .",
    "the central problem is that the adiabatic dft calculations were unable to find any sizeable barriers on the adiabatic pes , whose presence , however , is essential for explanation of the experimental finding .",
    "this has led to speculations that nonadiabatic effects may play an important role in the oxygen dissociation process at the al(111 ) surface @xcite .",
    "recently , a semiquantitative agreement with the experimental data is achieved by nonadiabatically confining the trajectories of the approaching o@xmath0 molecules to the spin - triplet pes @xcite . until now",
    ", however , it still remains unclear how and in what chemical circumstance this spin - selection rule is reasonable , and different opinions exist in literature @xcite . for oxygen dissociation at another simple metal , mg(0001 ) , first - principles dft calculation also shows the lack of a barrier on the adiabatic pes @xcite , which is in strong disagreement with experimental observation @xcite of a low sticking coefficient of o@xmath0 at mg(0001 ) .",
    "this discrepancy was ascribed , in a similar manner with that in the o@xmath0/al(111 ) system , to nonadiabaticity in the dissociation process of oxygen molecules @xcite .",
    "therefore , it becomes clear that the theoretical study of oxygen dissociation at the simple @xmath2 metals is still far from its maturity .",
    "in particular , considering the fact that up to now most of the theoretical results and conclusions are only based on the o@xmath0/al(111 ) and o@xmath0/mg(0001 ) prototypes , workers are thus confronted with an important question : does it retain necessary or valid for all simple @xmath2 metals ( at least , for metals with similar elemental valence electrons to al or mg ) to take into account such nonadiabaticity as spin - selection rule in obtaining an activated pes ? motivated by this question , in this paper",
    "we have carried out a systematic _ ab initio _ investigation of the adsorption and dissociation of oxygen molecules at be(0001 ) surface .",
    "beryllium has the same crystal structure and valence electrons as magnesium does .",
    "subsequently , it is attempting for one to derive that the behaviors of oxygen dissociation at be(0001 ) are the same as or similar to that at mg(0001 ) .",
    "our results , however , show that this is not true .",
    "the most distinct is that in the present o@xmath0/be(0001 ) system , our calculated adiabatic pes displays sizeable energy barriers along the dissociation paths .",
    "this partially but definitely answers the above question .",
    "that is , in the dft calculations of the simple - metal systems , the inclusion of nonadiabatic effects is not always indispensable for the presence of molecular dissociation barrier .    besides this basic point of interest ,",
    "our present study is also motivated by the fact that be has vast technological applications due to its high melting point and low weight . during these applications , surface oxidation as the main kind of corrosion always needs to be prevented .",
    "thus a systematic study on the adsorption and dissociation of o@xmath0 molecules at be surfaces , i.e. , the initial stage during the surface oxidation process , should be done .",
    "moreover , be is also a getter in experimental nuclear fusion reactors to adsorb residual gases such as o@xmath0 and h@xmath0o in the plasma vessel , improving the plasma cleanliness @xcite , which also makes it highly meaningful to study the adsorption and dissociation of o@xmath0 at be surfaces . at present",
    "there are only very few experimental data on the oxidation of be , reporting that the surface oxidation begins at an oxidation nucleation center , followed by a spreading growth from the center @xcite , while _ ab initio _ studies are entirely lacking .",
    "this as a whole encourages us to theoretically report a systematic investigation on the o@xmath0/be(0001 ) system .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows : in sec .",

    "iii results for the free oxygen molecule , the bulk be and clean be(0001 ) surface are given . in sec .",
    "iv and sec .",
    "v we present our results for o@xmath0 adsorption and dissociation at be(0001 ) surface , respectively . finally , we close our paper with a summary of our main results .",
    "the density - functional theory ( dft ) total energy calculations were carried out using the vienna _ ab initio _ simulation package @xcite with the projector - augmented - wave ( paw ) pseudopotentials @xcite and plane waves @xcite .",
    "the so - called repeated slab  geometries were employed @xcite .",
    "this scheme consists in the construction of a unit cell of an arbitrarily fixed number of atomic layers identical to that of the bulk in the plane of the surface ( defining the dimensional cell ) , but symmetrically terminated by an arbitrarily fixed number of empty layers ( the _ vacuum _ ) along the direction perpendicular to the surface . in the present study , the clean @xmath3-be(0001 ) surface was modeled by periodic slabs consisting of nine be layers separated by a vacuum of 20  , which was found to be sufficiently convergent .",
    "oxygen molecules were symmetrically introduced on both sides of the slab . during our calculations , the positions of the outmost three be layers as well as the o@xmath0 molecules were allowed to relax until the forces on the ions were less than 0.02 ev /  , while the central three layers of the slab were fixed in their calculated bulk positions .",
    "the plane - wave energy cutoff was set 400 ev .",
    "after a careful convergence analysis , we used a @xmath4 @xmath5-point grid for the @xmath3 cell with monkhorst - pack scheme @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) of perdew _ et al_. @xcite for the exchange - correlation potential was employed since the gga results has been previously validated for the bulk be @xcite .",
    "a fermi broadening @xcite of 0.1 ev was chosen to smear the occupation of the bands around @xmath6 by a finite-@xmath7 fermi function and extrapolating to @xmath8 k.",
    "first , the total energy of the bulk hcp be was calculated to obtain the bulk lattice parameters .",
    "the calculated lattice constants are 2.26 and 3.56    respectively for @xmath9 and @xmath10 , according well with experimental values @xcite of 2.285 and 3.585  .",
    "the band structure and orbital - resolved density of states ( dos ) of bulk be is shown in fig .",
    "1 . typically , the dos of bulk be has a relatively small value at the fermi energy ( @xmath6 ) , because there exists a dirac point at the fermi energy in the band structure along the @xmath11 direction , and a wide band gap along the @xmath12 direction .",
    "this anisotropic property of be differs from that of other alkali - earth metals , whose band structures around the fermi energy are always nearly free - electrons like .",
    "although the electronic configuration of elemental be is 1@xmath132@xmath13 , one can see from fig .",
    "1 that the 2@xmath14 states play an important role in the dos behaviors below @xmath6 , indicating a strong hybridization between @xmath15 and @xmath14 electronic states in bulk be .",

    "2 . compared to the bulk case ( fig .",
    "1 ) , one can see from fig .",
    "2 that there exists no longer dirac points or band gaps along any direction .",

    "this result accords well with previous studies @xcite .",
    "similar results have also been observed for w ( 110 ) and mo ( 110 ) films @xcite . from the inset in fig .",
    "2 , we can see that the surface electronic states around @xmath6 mainly accumulate within the two topmost be layers .",
    "further detailed wavefunction analysis shows that these states are mainly be @xmath17 states .",
    "our clean - surface calculation shows that due to this pronounced surface charge redistribution , the two outmost be(0001 ) layers relax significantly from the bulk values .",

    "these results are typical for well - converged dft - gga calculations .",
    "compared to the experimental @xcite values of 2.56 ev and 1.21    for o binding energy and bonding length , the usual dft - gga result always introduces an overestimation , which reflects the theoretical deficiency for describing the local orbitals of the oxygen .     molecule .",

    "also it reveals in fig .",
    "3 that spin splittings are sizeable ( @xmath26 ev ) for both bonding and antibonding mo s .",
    "this reflects hund s spin rule , which describes ground state as spin - polarized for o@xmath0 ( @xmath27 ) .",

    "4(a ) . in this study",
    ", we construct twelve initial structures with high symmetries by orienting the o@xmath0 molecule at the four high - symmetry sites respectively along the @xmath28 ( i.e. , [ 11@xmath29 ) , @xmath30 ( i.e. , [ @xmath31 ) and @xmath32 ( i.e. , [ @xmath33 ) directions .",
    "we also construct several low - symmetry initial structures by rotating the o@xmath0 molecule in the @xmath34 , @xmath35 , and @xmath36 planes with small angles .",
    "in all the initial configurations , the heights of the o@xmath0 molecules are set at @xmath374  , see fig .",
    "it is found within our expectation that after geometry optimization , these low - symmetry structures will either relax into the high - symmetry ones or be less stable with a lower adsorption energy than the high - symmetry ones .",

    "note that although the atomic radius of o is much larger than that of be , for convenience in depicting the adsorption positions , here and in the following we use larger circles to denote be atoms . ]",
    "one central quantity tailored for the present study is the average adsorption energy of the adsorbed oxygen species defined as @xmath39,\\ ] ] where @xmath40 is the total number of o atoms presented in the supercell , @xmath41 , @xmath42 , and @xmath43 are the total energies of the slab containing oxygen , of the corresponding clean be(0001 ) slab , and of a free o@xmath0 molecule respectively . according to this definition , a positive value of @xmath44 indicates that the adsorption is exothermic ( stable ) with respect to a free o@xmath0 molecule and a negative value indicates endothermic ( unstable ) reaction .",
    "starting from the above mentioned entrances and after geometry optimization , the obtained molecular adsorption energy ( @xmath44 ) , molecular magnetic moment ( mm ) , work function ( @xmath45 ) , adsorption height ( @xmath46 ) , and o - o bond length ( @xmath47 ) are listed in table i. from table i the following molecular adsorption features are revealed : ( i ) for the o@xmath0 molecule in parallel with be(0001 ) surface , the relaxed molecular structures vary very little compared to the initial molecular structures , which suggests the molecular adsorption to be the physisorption in these parallel channels . in these cases ,",
    "the relaxed adsorption height is around 3.9  .",
    "the o - o bond length is 1.236  , displaying a negligible expansion when compared to that of a free o@xmath0 molecule ( 1.235  ) .",
    "the molecular mm almost saturates at its free value of 2.0 @xmath48 , also suggesting the unaffected molecular orbitals in these physisorbed structures .",
    "in addition , the work function of the adsorbed be(0001 ) surface is almost identical to that of the clean be(0001 ) surface , implying negligible charge transfer between the parallel o@xmath0 adsorbate and the surface be atoms . finally , the calculated molecular adsorption energy is only @xmath49 mev , which is so small that a little thermal fluctuation may result in desorption of the o@xmath0 adsorbate with parallel o - o bond from the be(0001 ) surface .",
    "this result is consistent with the recent experimental observation that the reactivity of oxygen atoms with be(0001 ) surface is greater than that of oxygen molecules with be(0001 ) surface @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "one may question whether , when overcoming the energy barrier by artificially setting the initial metal - molecule distance @xmath38 to be lower than the above obtained physisorption height ( @xmath503.9  ) , new kinds of molecular adsorption state with parallel o - o bond will occur or not .",
    "for this , a large amount of calculations with more lower initial adsorption heights have been carried out and no other parallel molecular physi- or chemisorption states have been found , for details see discussion in the next section ; ( ii ) for the o@xmath0 adsorbate with the o - o bond oriented perpendicular to be(0001 ) surface , as shown in table i , the relaxed molecular structures display a signature of chemisorption . among them",
    "the hh - z configuration is most stable with the largest molecular adsorption energy of @xmath500.5 ev ( per atom ) . in this channel",
    "the adsorption height is decreased to be 1.58  , and prominently , the molecular mm is largely decreased to be 0.8 @xmath48 , which suggests a pronounced charge redistribution among the mo s via interaction with the be(0001 ) surface .",
    "the o - o bond in this most stable chemisorption channel is 1.471  , indicating a large expansion from the free o@xmath0 molecule and a fundamental weakening of the molecular bonding .",
    "in addition , the work function change is also prominent , implying an observable charge redistribution between the chemisorbed o@xmath0 molecule and the be(0001 ) surface .",
    "meanwhile , during the chemisorption of the o@xmath0 molecule , the be(0001 ) surface is also influenced .",
    "specifically , the three be atoms around the adsorbed o@xmath0 molecule of the hh - z entrance are pulled out by about 0.3  . recalling that the bulk beo has an unusual wurtzite structure , it is within one s expectation that o@xmath0 chemisorption in the hh - z channel ( instead of the fh - z channel ) is most energetically favorable .",
    "our additional calculations of the atomic oxygen adsorption at be(0001 ) also show that the hcp hollow site is most stable for atomic oxygen adsorption .",

    "prominently , the electron redistribution of the o@xmath0 @xmath1 antibonding mo s is largely asymmetric with respect to the two o atoms .",
    "the reason is that the lower o atom in the o@xmath0 molecule is in a complex bonding state .",
    "besides interacting with the upper o atom to form a weakly - bound molecule , this lower o atom also strongly interacts with the surface and subsurface be atoms via a mixed ionic / covalent bonding mechanism . in particular , it is the strong covalency in the be - o bond that heavily distorts the charge distribution of the o@xmath0 @xmath1 antibonding mo s . to our knowledge , this strong covalency in the bond between the metal surface and oxygen molecule has not been theoretically reported in previous studies . on the whole , the charge transfer to the @xmath1 antibonding mo s , as well as the strong covalency in the be - o bond , weaken the molecular bond and spin polarization . for spin density of the chemisorbed o@xmath0 molecule in the hh - z channel , see fig .",

    "6(a ) and 6(b ) , respectively .",
    "by comparison with the case of a free o@xmath0 molecule , one can see that the mo properties of the chemisorbed o@xmath0 in the hh - z entrance undergo the following fundamental changes : ( i ) the spin - split pdos signature ( peaks ) for the two energy - lowest bonding and antibonding @xmath24 mo s for both spins in fig .",

    "5(a ) that charges mostly flow out of these two mo s ; ( ii ) the pdos peaks for the two nearly - degenerate bonding @xmath57 and @xmath58 mo s around @xmath59=@xmath607.5 ev are broadened upon chemisorption to merge together , with the amplitude becoming much weaker than that in free o@xmath0 . also , the spin splitting of these two bonding mo s vanishes .",
    "these features consistently reveal that although these two bonding mo s do not lose their nature as the mo s , they are largely reshaped due to their hybridization with the @xmath2 orbitals of the surface and subsurface be atoms .",

    "6 , a sharp @xmath2-hybrid peak around @xmath59=@xmath607.5 ev in the pdos of the topmost be layer ; ( iii ) the spin - up antibonding @xmath61 mo shifts up in energy towards @xmath6 and is partially depopulated by an observable amount of charges . as a compensation ,",
    "the spin - down antibonding @xmath61 mo shifts down towards @xmath6 and becomes partially occupied .",
    "obviously , the spin rule prohibits direct charge transfer from the spin - up to spin - down antibonding @xmath61 mo .",

    "the present result is consistent with the well - known harpooning mechanism , which describes adsorbate - metal interaction by a simultaneous transfer of electrons from the adsorbing molecule into the unoccupied metal states ( direct bonding ) and a back donation of electrons from occupied metal states into the antibonding adsorbate orbitals . in the present case ,",
    "this exchange is achieved through interaction with the @xmath2 orbitals of the be(0001 ) surface ; ( iv ) even more interestingly , to compensate the breaking of the two energy - lowest bonding and antibonding @xmath24 mo s , there develops a new hybrid peak at @xmath59=@xmath6022.7 ev in the pdos of the system . from fig .",

    "since it has been shown that the pes given by the density functional theory gives the result that can be compared with experiments , we expect that our calculated pes provides the qualitative feature of the molecular dissociation process in the present specific o@xmath0/be(0001 ) system .",
    "figure 7 shows the obtained pes as a function of the distance @xmath46 from the surface and the bond length @xmath47 of the o@xmath0 molecule along the t - y channel , which , after a large amount of calculations , turns out to be the most favorable dissociative adsorption channel with largest adsorption energy ( 4.14 ev / atom ) and lowest activation barrier ( 0.23 ev ) .",
    "one can clearly see from fig .",
    "7 the process from initial molecular physisorption with a height of 3.9    and bond length of 1.23    to the final dissociative adsorption .",
    "the most distinct feature in fig .",
    "7 is that the calculated adiabatic pes exhibits a sizeable energy barrier toward dissociative adsorption .",
    "the transition state for this barrier is located at a distance of 2.2    from the be surface , where the o - o bond length is elongated to 1.30  .",
    "correspondingly , if we initially put o@xmath0 in the t - y channel at a height lower than 2.2  , then do geometry optimization , the o@xmath0 molecule will spontaneously dissociate with the two o atoms moving to the hcp hollow and fcc hollow sites , respectively .",
    "considering that the previous _ ab initio _ calculations have failed to obtain a barrier on the adiabatic pes for oxygen dissociation on the usual simple metals such as al(111 ) and mg(0001 ) , obviously , our present prediction of the activated pes in the o@xmath0/be(0001 ) system is unique . in particular",
    ",  since beryllium has the same crystal structure and valence electrons as magnesium does , it is attempting to assume that the behavior of oxygen dissociation at be(0001 ) is the same as or similar to that at mg(0001 ) . the result in fig .",
    "7 , however , shows that this intuitive expectation needs to be reshaped .    in the case of al(111 ) or mg(0001 ) , the failure of adiabatic dft calculations in producing an activated - type pes has been ascribed to the unphysical output that charge transfer occurs even at large molecule - metal distance , which has led to speculations that nonadiabatic effects may play an important role in the oxygen dissociation process at these metal surfaces with the simple @xmath2 bands @xcite .",
    "the unphysical charge transfer at large molecule - metal distance is generally caused by the requirement in the adiabatic description that the electron chemical potential of the o@xmath0 molecule aligns with that of the metal surface in the combined system ( metal plus molecule ) .",
    "on the other hand , however , this requirement does not necessarily results in artificial charge transfer between the two largely - separated subsystems .",
    "therefore , there is no universal criterion to judge whether the adiabaticity during molecular dissociation process breaks down or not .",
    "the molecule - metal interaction is so species - sensitive that even for the two metals with the same crystal structure and valence electrons , the molecular dissociation process at the surfaces can display qualitatively different behaviors . to make it more sense ,",
    "we have carried out a comparative study on the long - distance charge transfer effect by choosing the metal surfaces as be(0001 ) , mg(0001 ) , and al(111 ) .",
    "the distances of the o@xmath0 molecule from the three kinds of metal surfaces are fixed at the same value of 7  , at which charge transfer should not occur in reality .",
    "also , the o@xmath0 molecules in the three systems are identically chosen to be in the hh - z entrance .",
    "the calculated spin - split pdos for the o@xmath0 molecule and the charge - density difference @xmath51 in the three systems are shown in fig .",
    "clearly , one can see that for o@xmath22/al(111 ) and o@xmath0/mg(0001 ) , although the distance of the o@xmath0 molecule from the surfaces is set to be as large as 7    and charge transfer should not be presented in real systems , the adiabatic dft calculations give yet the contrary results . in these two cases",
    ", it reveals in fig .",
    "8(b ) and 8(c ) that the lumo of the ideal o@xmath0 molecule ( i.e. , the spin - down antibonding @xmath61 mo ) has shifted down to align with the fermi energy and becomes partially occupied , accompanying with an observable decreasing of the molecular spin .",
    "the o - o bond length also undergoes a little expansion compared to the free value of 1.235  . actually , fig .",
    "8(b ) and 8(c ) depict nothing more than what have been known in previous studies , and it is exactly due to this unphysical ( metal - molecule or intramolecule ) charge transfer that motivates theoretical workers to remedy the calculations by , for example , nonadiabatically constraining the molecular spins . as a direct result , a sizeable energy barrier will appear on the corrected pes @xcite . when the attention is paid to the o@xmath0/be(0001 ) system , however , we find that such unphysical large - distance charge transfer effect does not happen in the calculation .",
    "in fact , from fig .",
    "8(a ) one can see that at a metal - molecule distance of 7  , the calculated spin - split molecular pdos shows no change with respect to the free case .",
    "the lumo keeps empty and the charge - density difference is zero everywhere .",
    "subsequently , the molecular bond length and spin of o@xmath0 are not influenced at all by the presence of the be(0001 ) surface at a distance of 7  . combining with fig .",
    "7 , therefore , we conclude that unlike al(111 ) and mg(0001 ) , the adiabatic dft calculation presented in this paper is sufficient to predict an activated - type dissociation process of o@xmath0 at be(0001 ) .     with a fixed vertical distance of 7    from ( a ) be(0001 ) , ( b ) mg(0001 ) , and ( c ) al(111 ) surfaces . the o - o bond length in each case is allowed to relax",
    "the corresponding charge - density differences @xmath64 are plotted on the right side with the contour spacing of 0.002/@xmath20 .",
    "solid and dotted lines denote the accumulated and depleted densities , respectively . ]    for further illustration of o@xmath0 dissociation at be(0001 ) , we plot in fig . 9 four snapshots for the spin density ( the contour spacing is 0.2 @xmath65/@xmath20 ) evolving along the dissociation path shown in fig .",
    "the values of the corresponding heights @xmath46 and relaxed bond lengths @xmath47 of the o@xmath0 molecule are also indicated in the figure .",
    "one can see from fig .",
    "9 that as the o@xmath0 molecule approaches the surface along the t - y channel , the o - o bond length increases , while the spin magnetic moment decreases and tends to vanish at @xmath662.3  .",
    "since there has occurred electron transfer from the substrate to the molecule at this height , thus the disappearance of the spin moment is due to the donation of the minority spins from the substrate not due to the spin flip inside the molecule .",

    "distance @xmath46 from the surface , for eight different dissociative channels .",
    "the inset in each panel indicates the initial ( filled circles ) and final ( hollow circles ) atomic positions of o@xmath0 . ]",
    "the adiabatic pes s for o@xmath0 dissociation at be(0001 ) along the other parallel channels have also been calculated , which are found to have very similar elbow shapes except for visible differences in the transition states and dissociation barriers . to be more clear",
    ", a detailed comparison of these pes s is depicted in fig .",
    "10 by separately plotting the one - dimensional cuts of pes s and o - o bond length as functions of the o@xmath0 height @xmath46 from the substrate surface .",
    "the insets in each panel in fig .",
    "10 display the initial and final positions of the two o atoms . clearly , the dissociative adsorption of o@xmath0 along each of these parallel channels is a direct and activated type .",
    "the obtained dissociative adsorption energies , the dissociative energy barriers , and the geometrical parameters for the corresponding transition states , including the height of the o@xmath0 molecule and the o - o bond length , are concluded in table ii .",
    "it is found that the dissociation path with both the lowest energy barrier and the largest dissociative adsorption energy is along the t - y channel .",
    "for all the dissociation paths , the o - o bond lengths at the transition states are similar , ranging from 1.28 to 1.30  , elongated from the 1.236    in an isolated o@xmath0 molecule .",
    "note that no dissociative adsorptions are found for the o@xmath0 molecules along the vertical entrances , which thus are not plotted in fig . 9 and listed in table ii .",
    "this is different from the o@xmath0/al(111 ) system , in which the molecular dissociation along the vertical channels has been predicted to occur as well @xcite .",

    "in summary , by performing _ ab initio _",
    "simulations we have for the first time systematically investigated the adsorption and dissociation of oxygen molecules on the be(0001 ) surface .",
    "we have identified both the physisorbed and the chemisorbed molecular states , which directly occur along the parallel and vertical channels , respectively . for the most stable chemisorbed molecular state ( which is along the hh - z entrance ) , in particular , we have studied its electronic and magnetic properties by calculating the charge - density difference , the spin density , and the pdos , which clearly show the charge transfer from the spin - up @xmath1 mo to the substrate followed by the back donation from the substrate to the spin - down @xmath1 mo , as well as the distinct covalent weight in the chemical bonding between o@xmath0 and be(0001 ) . this important covalent weight in the molecule - metal bond has been revealed through the combining fact : ( i ) the charge is largely accumulated along the be - o bond [ fig .",
    "5(a ) ] ; ( ii ) the @xmath24 , @xmath56 , and @xmath25 mo s are heavily hybridized with the be @xmath2 states ( fig .",
    "6 ) ; ( iii ) the chemisorbed molecular state in the hh - z channel is much stable than that in the fh - z channel , implying an observable role played by the subsurface be atom beneath the o@xmath0 molecule",
    ".    the energy path for the dissociation of o@xmath0 on be(0001 ) surface has been determined by calculating the adiabatic pes s along various channels , among which the t - y channel has been found to be the most stable and favorable for the dissociative adsorption of o@xmath0 .",
    "remarkably , our results have shown that the adiabatic dissociation process in the present o@xmath0/be(0001 ) system is an activated type , with the lowest energy barrier of 0.23 ev in the most stable t - y channel . to our knowledge , this is the first time to theoretically predict a sizeable adiabatic energy barrier during dissociation of o@xmath0 at the metal surfaces with simple @xmath2 bands .",
    "thus as a final concluding remark , here we point out that in spite of many previous revealing and specific studies , an in - depth and primary insight into the common nature of the o@xmath0 dissociation at various simple @xmath2 metal surfaces remains yet to be attainable .",
