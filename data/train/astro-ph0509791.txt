    "vw  hyi was observed in superoutburst with _ euve _ from 1994 june 2.13 to 4.10 ut ( rjd 9505.63 to 9507.60 ; @xmath0 ) .",
    "the observations took place @xmath1 days after the rise of the optical flux on @xmath2 may 29.5 ut and @xmath3 days after the peak of the optical flux at @xmath4 on @xmath2 may 31.0 ut . the deep survey photometer ( 70170  ) collected data for less than one day before being shut off because of the high count rate ( @xmath5 counts  s@xmath6 ) induced in the detector by source photons .",
    "earth occultations and standard settings on the pipeline reduction software presently limits the useful amount of spectrometer data to 4280 , 4177 , and 1075  s for the sw ( 70180   ) , mw ( 145370   ) , and lw ( 290760  ) spectrometers , respectively .",
    "as measured by the deep survey photometer and the spectrometers , the euv flux of vw  hyi was highly variable during the observations .",
    "the upper panel of figure  1 shows the count rates recorded by the sw , mw , and lw spectrometers in the wavebands 80170 , 170300 , and 300400   , respectively .",
    "whereas the visual flux _ fell _ steadily from @xmath7 to @xmath8 during the observations , the euv flux is seen to _",
    "increase_. on shorter time scales , the euv flux variations , in particular the flux diminutions , are accompanied by distinct spectral variations .",
    "the lower panel of figure  1 shows the ratio of the count rates in the 80170    to 170300   wavebands recorded by the sw and mw spectrometers as a function of time .",
    "each diminution of the euv flux is accompanied by a softening of the spectrum ; just the reverse of the effect produced by variations in the column density .        blithely ignoring these indications that the euv spectrum of vw  hyi varied both in flux and shape during the observations , we constructed a net spectrum for the observation using data from each of the spectrometers .",
    "the result is shown in figure  2 .",
    "the sw , mw , and lw portions of the spectrum extend from 80180 , 160360 , and 300420   , respectively , and are binned to 1 , 2 , and 4   , respectively ; approximately twice the fwhm of the resolution of each spectrometer .",
    "there is residual signal in the lw spectrometer longward even of 420   , but this signal is most likely due to second - order flux ; this effect is being investigated .",
    "the errors in the flux density due solely to counting statistics are everywhere less than @xmath9 , and are typically less than half this amount .    .",
    "after years of speculation about its nature ( e.g. , van der woerd , heise , & bateson 1986 ; pringle et  al .  1987 ; mauche et  al .  1991",
    "; van teeseling , verbunt , & heise 1993 ) , it is gratifying finally to see the euv spectrum of vw  hyi .",
    "many aspects of the spectrum are consistent with previous measurements .",
    "the fact that the spectrum peaks longward of 170    is consistent with the fact that in outburst the _ exosat _ al - par filter count rate is higher than the 3000  lex or 4000  lex count rates .",
    "that the spectrum extends to yet longer wavelengths is consistent with the low neutral hydrogen column density ( @xmath10 ) measured by polidan , mauche , & wade ( 1990 ) . that the spectrum does not extend shortward of @xmath11    ( @xmath12  kev )",
    "is consistent with the nondetection in the 0.180.43  kev bandpass by",
    "( crdova et  al .  1980 ) and with the _ decrease _ during outburst of the flux in the 0.12.4  kev bandpass measured by _",
    "( wheatley et  al .  1996 ) .",
    "inconsistent is the brightness of the spectrum .",
    "the observed 80420    flux is @xmath13 , implying a luminosity of @xmath14 . for comparison ,",
    "the luminosity of the accretion disk is @xmath15 times higher ( mauche et  al .",
    "the predicted _ exosat _ al - par and 3000  lex filter count rates are 28.3 and 15.5 counts  @xmath16 , respectively .",
    "the highest measured _ exosat _ al - par and 3000  lex filter count rates appear to be 4.3 and 1.2 counts  @xmath16 , respectively ( van der woerd & heise 1987 ) . given the low net exposure on source , it is fortunate that vw  hyi was so bright during our observations .    it is fortunate also that the neutral hydrogen column density to vw  hyi is so low .",
    "columns typical of other nearby cvs ( @xmath17 ; mauche , raymond , & crdova 1988 ) , would render vw  hyi nearly unobservable : at @xmath18 , the optical depth of the ism is 1.1 at 100   , 3.2 at 150   , 6.5 at 200   .",
    "ss  cyg ( mauche , raymond , & mattei 1995 ) and u  gem ( long et  al .",
    "1995 ) both have higher columns , but are also intrinsically harder .",
    "if other , even nearby , cvs are as soft as vw  hyi , it will be hard to impossible to detect them in the euv ( @xmath19912   ) .",
    "\\(i ) to produce so little flux shortward of @xmath11   , the temperature of a blackbody must be @xmath20  k ( @xmath21  ev ) . to extinguish the flux longward of @xmath22   ,",
    "the neutral hydrogen column density then must be @xmath23 , but such a model fails to reproduce the overall spectral distribution .",
    "\\(ii ) the ionization edges of c  iii ",
    "iv , n  iii  v ,",
    "iv , ne  ii ",
    "iv , mg  iii ",
    "iv , si  iv , s  iv  vi , and fe  iv ",
    "vi all lie in this bandpass , but are not apparent in the spectrum .",
    "this result probably does not constrain irradiation of the white dwarf by a hard continuum spectrum , since such models produce edges at wavelengths below 100    ( van teeseling , heise , & paerels 1994 ) .",
    "\\(iii ) at @xmath24@xmath25  k , the he  ii lyman lines ( @xmath26   ) and bound - free continuum ( @xmath27   ) are in emission , contrary to observations . at higher temperatures , particularly @xmath28  k ,",
    "the free - free continuum is weak , but strong emission lines begin to appear shortward of 100   .",
    "other processes likely affect the spectrum .",
    "the ism and possibly the wind of vw  hyi will imprint a he  ii absorption edge at 228    onto the intrinsic spectrum .",
    "measurement of , or upper limits on , such an edge will provide an estimate of the integrated column density of this ion .",
    "he  i has autoionization resonances at @xmath29    ( rumph , bowyer , & vennes 1994 ) .",
    "the first such resonance may be responsible for the emission / absorption feature at 206   .",
