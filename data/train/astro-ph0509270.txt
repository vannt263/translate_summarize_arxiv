    "ascertaining the physical properties of planetary host stars , the chemical abundances thereof in particular , is a critical component of understanding the formation and evolution of extrasolar planetary systems . of the approximately 131 stars presently known to harbor planets , fe abundances",
    "have been derived for no fewer than 117 , with the abundances of numerous other elements having been determined for many .",
    "the results of these abundance analyses have led to the now well - known discovery that stars with planets tend to be metal - rich compared to random field stars ( e.g. , fischer & valenti 2005 ; santos et al . 2005 ) .",
    "two hypotheses have emerged as possible explanations of the planet - metallicity correlation : accretion of h - depleted , rocky material by planetary hosts and preferential planet formation in high - metallicity , proto - planetary disks . both of these propositions are discussed extensively in the pertinent literature ( e.g. , gonzalez 1997 ; ida & lin 2004 ; fischer & valenti 2005 ) .",
    "an interesting consequence of the radial velocity ( rv ) method used currently to detect extrasolar planets is the limited range of stellar spectral types of stars chosen as targets .",
    "planet searches generally focus on older , main sequence ( ms ) late - f , g , and k dwarfs , because it is these stars that are bright enough to obtain high signal - to - noise , high - resolution spectra , have an ample number of usable spectral lines for the rv analyses , and have rotation rates and activity levels that facilitate the detection of planets .",
    "furthermore , there is potentially great sociological significance in finding planets around stars like our sun . while unique challenges exist for finding planets around younger stars and stars of earlier and later spectral types ( e.g. , setiawan et al .",
    "2003 ; paulson , cochran , & hatzes 2004 ) , the paucity of known planets in orbits around these `` other '' stars prohibits a full elucidation of extrasolar planet formation and evolution .    recognizing the importance of filling the gaps of the currently known planetary host sample , a handful of groups have initiated dedicated surveys of low mass stars @xcite and evolved g- and k - giants , the progenitors of which were massive early - type ms dwarfs @xcite .",
    "most recently , the tautenburg observatory planet search ( tops ) program , using the alfred - jensch 2-m telescope at the thringer landessternwarte tautenburg ( tls ) with follow - up observations with the 2.7-m harlan j. smith and hobby eberly ( het ) telescopes at the mcdonald observatory , has announced the discovery of a giant planet orbiting the k2 ii giant ( hatzes et al .",
    "2005 ; paper i ) . based on an estimated luminosity of 3.6 @xmath5 and the evolutionary tracks of",
    ", paper i estimated a mass range of 2 - 7 @xmath2 for the ms progenitor of hd 13189 .",
    "thus , hd 13189 may be the most massive star known to harbor a planet .",
    "here , we present the results of our abundance analysis of this potentially unique planetary host .",
    "our abundance analysis makes use of two template spectra ( spectra taken without an iodine cell ) obtained as part of the tops program on 2002 december 19 using the alfred - jensch 2-m telescope and the high - resolution coud echelle spectrometer at tls , located in tautenburg , germany .",
    "the spectrometer consists of an echelle grating with @xmath6 and a cross - dispersing grism ; the visual grism has been used , along with a single 2048 x 2048 ccd detector with @xmath7 pixels , providing a wavelength coverage of 4660 - 7410  .",
    "each spectrum has a resolution of @xmath8 and a typical signal - to - noise ( s / n ) ratio of @xmath9 . a standard data reduction process , which includes bias subtraction , flatfielding , scattered light removal , extraction , and wavelength calibration , using the usual routines within the iraf facility has been applied to the spectra .",
    "the two individual hd 13189 spectra were co - added into a single , higher s / n ratio ( @xmath10 ) spectrum , and equivalent widths ( ews ) were measured by fitting lines with gaussian or voigt profiles using the one - dimensional spectrum analysis package spectre @xcite .",
    "spectral line selection was aided by the collection of ; only lines labeled as `` case a''- lines with estimated internal uncertainties of @xmath11 in oscillator strengths ( @xmath12 ) and presumably free from blends in the solar spectrum- were considered .",
    "the list was culled further by examining each line in the spectrum of hd 13189 and eliminating those that were deemed to be blended or otherwise unmeasurable .",
    "our final line list , along with the measured ews for both hd 13189 and the sun , is presented in table 1 .",
    "solar ews have been measured in a high - quality ( @xmath13 and @xmath14 ) spectrum of the daytime sky obtained with the 2.7-m harlan j. smith telescope at the mcdonald observatory @xcite .",
    "stellar parameters have been determined spectroscopically via an iterative process .",
    "the @xmath15and @xmath16 are determined by adjusting their values until there are no correlations between line - by - line [ fe / h]abundances ( as derived from lines ) and excitation potential ( @xmath17 ) and reduced ew ( @xmath18 ) , respectively .",
    "this method for determining @xmath15and @xmath16 is used often , but care must be taken to ensure that there is no ab initio correlation between excitation potential and reduced ew , which can lead to degenerate solutions .",
    "this is the case with our list , which consists of 86 lines .",
    "the list was trimmed until the correlation between excitation potential and reduced ew was eliminated ; this left 47 lines with a satisfactory range of excitation potentials ( @xmath19 ) .",
    "uncertainties in @xmath15and @xmath16 ( @xmath20 ) are determined by adjusting the parameters until the corresponding correlation coefficient has a @xmath20 significance .",
    "finally , @xmath21 is fixed by forcing fe abundances derived from and lines into agreement ; the uncertainty in @xmath21 is based on the uncertainty in the difference of the and abundances .",
    "the final stellar parameters and uncertainties are given in table 2 .",
    "we note our derived @xmath21 value supports the finding of paper i that hd 13189 is a highly evolved giant .",
    "abundances have been derived using the lte stellar line analysis package moog ( sneden 1973 ; sneden 2004 , private communication ) .",
    "the abfind driver was used to force - fit abundances to the line - by - line ews for all elements except o. we have used the blends driver to derive the abundance of o from the @xmath22 [ ] line , taking care to account for the non - negligible contribution to the feature by a blend ( e.g. , allende prieto et al .",
    "the specifics of our o analysis follows that of @xcite , which should be consulted for details .",
    "model atmospheres with the convective overshoot approximation for hd 13189 and the sun have been interpolated from the atlas9 grids of kurucz ; the solar parameters @xmath23 , @xmath24 , and @xmath25 were adopted .",
    "atomic parameters for all transitions are from , except for those of mg , which are from the vald database ( piskunov et al . 1995 ; kupka et al .",
    "1999 ; ryabchikova et al .",
    "1999 ) , and that of @xmath22 [ ] , which is from @xcite .",
    "final absolute abundances for hd 13189 and the sun are given in table 1 , and the final stellar parameters , relative abundances , and uncertainties for hd 13189 are presented in table 2 .",
    "the abundances are derived with the complete list of 86 lines .",
    "relative abundances are the mean of a line - by - line comparison with solar values , thus limiting the impact of possibly inaccurate @xmath26-values .",
    "final abundance uncertainties are the quadratic sum of the uncertainties related to the adopted stellar parameters- based on sensitivities to arbitrary changes in @xmath27 , @xmath21 , and @xmath16- ( table 3)- and uncertainties in the mean abundances . for mn and o abundances , which are based on a single feature ,",
    "the final uncertainties incorporate uncertainties in the solar abundances .",
    "sensitivities to the adopted c ( important for molecular equilibrium calculations , primarily related to co ) and ni abundances are also included in the final o abundance uncertainty .",
    "the final abundance uncertainties are on the order of 0.05 - 0.10 dex , but larger uncertainties due to systematic errors , e.g. , related to relative differences in the atmospheric models , can not be ruled out .",
    "the derived fe abundance , [ fe / h ] @xmath28 , places hd 13189 in the lower envelope of the planetary host metallicity distribution and makes hd 13189 one of the most metal - poor planetary hosts yet discovered .",
    "furthermore , with a semi - major axis in the range 1.5 - 2.2 au ( paper i ) , the planetary companion of hd 13189 is the only one known to have a semi - major axis @xmath29 au and orbit a star with a metallicity @xmath30 , a combination that is potentially important to understanding giant planet formation @xcite .",
    "abundances of other elements considered here are sub - solar , and the [ m / fe ] ratios are unspectacular when compared to the general field population ( e.g. , edvardsson et al . 1993 ; fulbright 2002 ) .",
    "the planet - metallicity correlation is one of the most scrutinized results to emerge from extrasolar planet studies .",
    "@xcite offer the most thorough investigation of the correlation to date ; their conclusion , based on a uniform analysis of 850 stars with and without planets , is that gas giant planets preferentially form in high - metallicity environments .",
    "various groups have also argued for this `` primordial '' scenario ( e.g. , pinsonneault , depoy , & coffee 2001 ; santos 2003 ) , and there are two main pieces of evidence given in support .",
    "first , there is no correlation between convection zone ( cz ) depth and metallicity of planetary hosts , an effect that is expected if accretion of h - depleted rocky material has occurred .",
    "second , the metallicity distribution of planet - harboring subgiant stars does not differ from that of dwarfs ; the deepening cz of a subgiant should dilute any accretion signatures that might have occurred .    despite the substantial evidence pointing to the primordial scenario for planetary formation ,",
    "data in support of the accretion of h - depleted rocky material hypothesis also exist , albeit they are more sparse .",
    "@xcite was the first to report on the super - solar metallicities of planetary hosts and to suggest the correlation may be a result of accretion .",
    "shortly thereafter , @xcite detected @xmath31 in the metal - rich planetary host hd 82943 ; @xmath31 is a volatile species that should be destroyed beyond the level of observability in the atmospheres of solar - type stars during pre - ms evolution ( e.g. , proffitt & michaud 1989 ) .",
    "israelian et al .",
    "interpreted the presence of @xmath31- which should be preserved in giant planets- in the hd 82943 as possible evidence of accretion ; the possibility of heightened @xmath32li abundances in the atmospheres of stars that have engulfed rocky material was later confirmed by .",
    "the @xmath31 detection was subsequently challenged by @xcite , who questioned the atomic data used by israelian et al . in response , reanalyzed @xmath31 in hd 82943 using updated atomic data and confirmed their original detection .",
    "further evidence for the accretion hypothesis comes from the study of smith , cunha , & lazzaro ( 2001 ) , who found a trend of increasing abundance for elements with increasing condensation temperatures ( @xmath33 ) for a small subsample of planetary hosts .",
    "if accretion of rocky material has occurred , one might expect the material to be rich in high-@xmath33 , refractory elements compared to low-@xmath33 , volatile elements @xcite .",
    "however , similar @xmath33-dependent abundance trends in planetary hosts have not been found by others ( e.g. , sadakane et al .",
    "2002 ) .",
    "additional support for the accretion hypothesis may be emerging from the discovery and analyses of giant stars with planetary companions .",
    "as of this writing , planets are known to orbit two g - type and five k - type giants ( including hd 13189 ) , and their metallicity distribution is not similar to that of planet - hosting dwarfs . in figure 1",
    "we plot relative fe abundances versus @xmath15for the seven giants ( red circles ) and for planet hosting dwarfs from fischer & valenti ( 2005 ; black circles ) , from santos , israelian , & mayor ( 2004 ; black squares ) , excluding duplicates with fischer & valenti , and from santos et al .",
    "( 2005 ; black triangles ) , again excluding duplicates .",
    "the horizontal line represents the mean [ fe / h ] abundance of the combined , 126 dwarf sample .",
    "the giant data for hd 47536 , hd 59686 , hd 137759 , and hd 219449 are from @xcite , and data for hd 11977 and hd 104985 are from and @xcite , respectively . in the combined dwarf sample ,",
    "@xmath34 have derived [ fe / h ] abundances higher than @xmath35 dex , and if the giants follow the same metallicity distribution , we would expect @xmath36 to have [ fe / h ] abundances higher than @xmath35 dex ( see also sadakane et al .",
    "2005 ) , which is clearly not seen .",
    "if the dwarf and giant samples are drawn from the same parent population , there is only a @xmath37 probability of obtaining the observed metallicity distributions according to a two - sided kolmogorov - smirnov test .",
    "while the sample of giant stars with planetary companions is not statistically significant , the indication of a metallicity distribution that possibly differs from that of dwarfs is intriguing .",
    "one possible explanation for the difference is that the planet - metallicity correlation found for the dwarfs is a result of accretion , and the giants have sufficiently diluted their atmospheres via evolution - induced mixing .",
    "this conclusion , however , would be difficult to reconcile with current results for subgiants ( e.g. , fischer & valenti 2005 ) .",
    "alternatively , planet formation may be sensitive to the mass of the host star , independent of metallicity .",
    "the progenitors of g and k giants are early - type ms dwarfs and would be more massive than the f , g , and k dwarfs known to have planets .",
    "thus , the current results for giants with planets would support a mass - dependent planetary formation scenario .",
    "furthermore , fischer & valenti showed that the occurrence of planets around stars increases linearly with stellar mass .",
    "however , they also found a correlation of rising metallicity with increasing planetary host mass and argued that the increased occurrence of planets around more massive stars is most likely spurious . a larger number planets orbiting subgiant and giant stars need to be analyzed in order to determine if either of these explanations are plausible , or if the difference in metallicity distributions is due to other effects , such as different planetary formation mechanisms ( e.g. , chauvin et al . 2005 ) .",
    "including more evolved stars in rv surveys is highly encouraged .    our analysis provides the opportunity to place further constraints on the mass of hd 13189 from paper i. the tracks of are plotted in the @xmath27-@xmath21 plane in figure 2 ; the position of hd 13189 is marked by the open star . from our derived stellar parameters ,",
    "we find a mass of @xmath38 for hd 13189 .",
    "unfortunately , the range of possible masses , @xmath39 2 - 6 @xmath2 , is not well - constrained due to the uncertainty in the @xmath21 value and is not a significant improvement over that given by paper i. adopting a stellar mass of 3.5 @xmath2 , we find a minimum companion mass of @xmath40 , placing the companion at the planet / brown dwarf boundary .",
    "hd 13189 and its companion are a potentially unique system among planetary systems known today .",
    "the star has one of the lowest metallicities and possibly the highest mass of all planetary hosts , and the companion likely lies on the planet / brown dwarf boundary and has the largest semi - major axis for a planet orbiting a significantly metal - poor star .",
    "further investigation of the hd 13189 system is needed to place more stringent constraints on the mass of the two objects and should provide unparalleled data in the effort to understand the formation and evolution of planetary systems .",
