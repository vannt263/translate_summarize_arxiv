    "<S> both the inhomogeneous broadening and the pure decoherence due to the extrinsic bath spin interaction are shown to be removed at the classic spin echo time @xmath95 in contrast to the unusual recovery time of @xmath96 in the case of intrinsic bath spin interaction . </S>",

    "<S> a solution is a two - pulse control . </S>",
    "<S> fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2](a ) shows that , after a second electron spin flip at @xmath97 , the paths of the two pseudospin states corresponding to the electron @xmath18 states driven by the intrinsic nuclear spin pair interaction cross again at @xmath98 , coinciding with the secondary spin echo time for the other two causes . </S>",

    "<S> the power of concatenation of pulse sequences has been shown in the context of dynamical decoupling in quantum computation @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> similarly , the control of disentanglement of the bath states from the quantum object may be enhanced by concatenation . the pseudo - spin evolution with the two - pulse control of the quantum object </S>",
    "<S> can be constructed recursively from the free - induction evolution @xmath102 , by the concatenation , @xmath103 , @xmath104 . </S>",

    "<S> the decoherence is reduced by an order of @xmath115 at @xmath116 for each additional level of concatenation till saturation at the level @xmath117 . </S>",

    "<S> our result shows the protection of electron spin coherence by pulse sequences with interpulse interval up to @xmath119s    in conclusion , we note that our scheme of restoring the coherence depends on the pure decoherence being driven by the interaction in the spin bath and by the domination of the bath pair excitation in the slow bath dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> the pulse sequence design is borrowed from the dynamical decoupling schemes in nmr spectroscopies @xcite and in quantum computation @xcite but the disentanglement method aims directly at the bath dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> our method seeks not to eliminate the object - bath interaction by dynamical averaging , but to disentangle by controlling the quantum object to maneuver the bath evolution . </S>",
    "<S> thus , elimination of coupling between the quantum object and the bath is not a necessary condition for their disentanglement , as illustrated by coherence recovery at @xmath120 where effective object - bath interaction does not vanish even in the first order of hyperfine coupling @xmath121 . </S>",
    "<S> direct observation of coherence echoes at such magic times is possible with the narrowing of inhomogeneous distribution by measurement projection @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the control of bath spins may well develop into a valuable addition to the collection of armaments of coherence preservation for quantum information processing .    </S>",
