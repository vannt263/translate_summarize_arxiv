    "therefore , he no longer sought an elementary solution although the equation ( [ eq_x_nck ] ) was always on his mind . as a matter of fact ,",
    "pn mentioned ( [ eq_x_nck ] ) , and its special case ( [ eq_x_n ] ) to vilmos totik march of 2003 who thought it would be a good problem for a schweitzer competition , and the uniqueness of positive solutions of ( [ eq_x_n ] ) was indeed included as problem  # 6 in 2003 .",

    "however , the biggest semantic difference between ( [ eq_cond2 ] ) and ( [ eq_cond3 ] ) is that in the latter case , because the coefficient of @xmath63 may vanish , pedantically speaking , the terms _ recurrence _ or _ recursive formula _ are no longer appropriate although the term _ difference equation _ is still valid .",
    "in this section , we prove the following theorem about existence of positive solutions of ( [ eq_curr_x_n ] ) .",

    "the next step involves a semi - complete induction in the sense that passing to @xmath111 from @xmath53 will also use the inductive assumption for @xmath112 .",
    "the inductive step is almost but not exactly the same as we went to @xmath103 from @xmath94 and @xmath113 .",
    "suppose the construction with the properties mentioned above has been done up to @xmath53 , and now we proceed with it for @xmath111 .",
    "we assume that @xmath53 is odd ; the other case is similar .",
    "writing ( [ eq_curr_x_n ] ) in the form @xmath114 we can see that @xmath63 is continuous on @xmath79 because , by the inductive hypotheses , ( i ) @xmath83 is positive and continuous on @xmath79 , ( ii ) @xmath115 is positive and continuous on @xmath116 , and ( iii ) @xmath84 \\subset ( \\alpha_{n-1},\\beta_{n-1})$ ] .",
    "furthermore , by the first relation in ( [ eq_alpha ] ) , the second in ( [ eq_beta ] ) , and by simple algebra , we have @xmath117 because @xmath118 and @xmath119 are both positive .",

    "if we expect solutions of ( [ eq_curr_x_n ] ) to behave well as @xmath187 then it is natural to assume that so do the coefficients .",
    "this is expressed in the following statement .",
    "[ theorem_asy1 ]    let the coefficients of ( [ eq_curr_x_n ] ) be such that the following four limits satisfy @xmath263 if ( the not necessarily positive ) @xmath66 satisfies ( [ eq_curr_x_n ] ) and @xmath264 then @xmath265 exists and @xmath266 and if ( the not necessarily negative ) @xmath66 satisfies ( [ eq_curr_x_n ] ) and @xmath267 then again @xmath265 exists and @xmath268    [ theorem_asy2 ]    let the coefficients of ( [ eq_curr_x_n ] ) be such that the following five limits satisfy @xmath269 and @xmath270 where all five limits are finite . if ( the not necessarily positive ) @xmath66 satisfies ( [ eq_curr_x_n ] ) and ( [ cond_liminf2 ] ) , then @xmath271 exists and @xmath272 and if ( the not necessarily negative ) @xmath66 satisfies ( [ eq_curr_x_n ] ) and ( [ cond_liminf2 ] ) , then again @xmath265 exists and @xmath273    first we deal with the case ( [ cond_liminf2 ] ) .",
    "we will use the `` @xmath257 '' notation , see ( [ x_n_2_t_n ] ) . by theorem  [ theorem_bound1 ] , @xmath274 and",
    "our goal is to show that @xmath275 .",
    "once this is done , then evaluating @xmath276 is straightforward .",
    "our approach is based on the _ freud kunstgriff_.    use ( [ cond_liminf2 ] ) to find a nonincreasing sequence of nonnegative numbers @xmath277 such that is nonnegative , then just set @xmath278 for @xmath69 . ]",
    "@xmath279 we rewrite equation ( [ eq_curr_t_n ] ) as @xmath280 where @xmath281 clearly , @xmath282 because each @xmath283-term in it goes to @xmath284 as @xmath187 and every coefficient of every @xmath283-term in it is @xmath285 .",
    "the advantage of ( [ eq_curr_t_n2 ] ) is that , except for @xmath286 , every @xmath287-term is nonnegative in it and that every coefficient of every such @xmath287-term is both nonnegative and convergent .",
    "now we are in the position to use the _ freud kunstgriff_. pick @xmath288 and @xmath289 such that @xmath290 and let @xmath187 first over @xmath291 and then over @xmath292 in ( [ eq_curr_t_n2 ] ) .",
    "we get @xmath293 and @xmath294 respectively , from which @xmath295 that is , @xmath275 so that @xmath296 .",
    "once we know that @xmath297 exists , we just let @xmath187 either in ( [ eq_curr_t_n2 ] ) or in ( [ eq_curr_t_n ] ) to obtain @xmath298 and the positive solution of @xmath299 yields ( [ x_n_lim1 ] ) .",
    "if , instead of ( [ cond_liminf2 ] ) , condition ( [ cond_limsup2 ] ) holds , then , as observed in the proof of theorem  [ theorem_bound1 ] , replacing @xmath0 by @xmath262 in ( [ eq_curr_x_n ] ) leads to a sign change for @xmath44 and that results in a sign change of @xmath300 in ( [ coeff_limit1 ] ) so that ( [ x_n_lim2 ] ) follows from ( [ x_n_lim1 ] ) .",
    "it remains to be seen if conditions ( [ cond_liminf2 ] ) and ( [ cond_limsup2 ] ) in theorem  [ theorem_asy1 ] can be replaced by a one - sided @xmath285 condition similarly as it is done in theorem  [ theorem_bound1 ] .",
