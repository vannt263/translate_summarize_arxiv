    "three dimensional topological insulators ( ti ) are band insulators which carry metallic electronic states on their surfaces .",
    "these states are described by the two - dimensional massless dirac hamiltonian with an odd number of dirac points ( for a review see ref . ) .",
    "the corresponding surface eigenstates are characterized by a helical structure where the spin and momentum are rigidly locked by a spin - orbit coupling .",
    "the surface states are robust with respect to perturbations that obey time - reversal symmetry.@xcite this symmetry can be broken by the exchange field which may be induced by ferromagnetically ordered magnetic impurities in ti , @xcite or by ti contact with a magnetic material .",
    "@xcite as a result , the effective zeeman term in the dirac hamiltonian produces a gap in the energy spectrum of the surface states , transforming the two - dimensional metal into the chern insulator .",
    "@xcite this phase is characterized by a half - quantized anomalous hall effect ( ahe ) generically related to the topological magnetoelectric effect in ti . @xcite .",
    "the latter effect gives rise to a number of interesting magnetoelectric phenomena with many potential applications .",
    "@xcite    the anomalous hall current is carried by one - dimensional ( 1d ) chiral conducting channels residing on domain walls between exchange fields of opposite signs @xcite .",
    "these channels can be also localized near a boundary between different crystal facets @xcite , as well as near 1d edges of an interface between two ti s separated by a thin tunneling barrier , @xcite providing that their surfaces are in the insulating phase due to the zeeman interaction .",
    "the latter two proposals are interesting from the practical point of view , since they suggest a new way to observe the quantized anomalous hall effect .",
    "it is interesting to extend these ideas to heterostructures and superlattices containing ti layers and ordinary - insulator , or magnetic - insulator layers . at the same time , recent studies show that superlattices with desirable properties can be fabricated .",
    "ab initio calculations of electronic states in a bi@xmath0se@xmath1/mnse superlattice @xcite show a high tunability of these systems in the important parameter range , where the ahe can be realized .",
    "recently , there were reports on naturally grown ti heterostructures @xcite and superlattices based on intergrown magnetic and ti layers .",
    "@xcite to exhibit quantum ahe the former must include magnetic components , that may be achieved , for example , by an appropriate magnetic doping .",
    "the main goal of the present work is to study conducting electron states that carry the anomalous hall current on the lateral surface of a vertically grown heterostructure ( see fig .",
    "1 ) . to our knowledge , this problem has not been addressed yet , although in some recent works edge states have been theoretically studied for single ti layers and slabs @xcite , but not for a multilayer system . at the same time , propagation of electrons in a multilayer system can be quite unusual due to a specific spacial spin texture associated with the chiral character of electron states . as it will be shown in this work",
    ", this texture leads to localization of electron s wave - functions at single ti layers , even in the case of a relatively large tunnel coupling between ti layers . in regular superlattices",
    "it shows up in formation of flat bands in the vertical direction .",
    "such a localization becomes possible due to a nontrivial topology of electron states on ti surfaces and it has no analogies in other systems , although one may see some resemblance to flat bands in su - schrieffer - heeger one - dimensional model .",
    "@xcite on the side surface of a superlattice the localized states coexist with itinerant states .",
    "all these states provide conducting channels carrying the anomalous hall current . in previous studies of edge states in ti films and slabs @xcite in the quantum hall regime",
    "the considered system compositions and sizes allowed the existence of only a single conducting channel . on the other hand",
    ", even a single ti layer can carry several such channels , depending on its thickness .",
    "in ideal situation , without scattering it is expected that in the quantum hall regime the total conductance of these channels is equal to one conductance quantum , while it turns to zero in the trivial phase .",
    "we considered such a multichannel case for a single ti layer and for a superlattice and demonstrated the expected reconstruction of edge bands upon a topological transition between the quantum hall and trivial phases . in turn",
    ", the topological phase transition can be controlled by a ratio between the zeeman interaction and the interlayer tunneling parameter .",
    "the system to be studied consists of anisotropic ti films separated by tunneling barriers .",
    "the electronic surface states at interfaces and lateral faces of these films are described by corresponding dirac hamiltonians , with the mass term generated by the zeeman field @xmath2 which is parallel to @xmath3 . in the case when this field is produced by the proximity effect with a magnetic - insulator layer , as in ref .",
    ", the mass term appears only at interface . in this case , in the ahe regime the entire conducting side surface of each ti film carries a quantum of the hall current .",
    "@xcite the wave function of an edge state which resides on this surface penetrates into the interface region where the interlayer tunneling parameter @xmath4 connects the wave functions of neighboring layers . a final equation for determining the energies and wave - functions of the edge states",
    "can be obtained by using the matching conditions at boundaries between horizontal and lateral crystal faces .",
    "this equation has been analyzed numerically , as well as analytically in some limiting cases .",
    "the article is organized in the following way . in sec .",
    "ii the hamiltonian of the entire heterostructure including horizontal and side faces of anisotropic ti is formulated and the matching conditions are found that allow to meet wave functions on horizontal and side faces of ti layers . also the equations are derived for calculation of the electronic band energies . in sec.iii",
    "we demonstrate for a general heterostructure that the states localized near single ti layers can exist on its lateral surface at @xmath5 .",
    "the results for a regular superlattice are presented in sec .",
    "the analytical results in some limiting cases are obtained for the topologically distinct regimes @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "we considered the effect of a spin - dependent tunneling on the flat - band wave - functions .",
    "also , in this section numerical results are presented in a broader range of parameters .",
    "these results are discussed in sec .",
    "two adjacent horizontal ti faces are coupled to each other via electron tunneling through a thin magnetic layer between them .",
    "an edge state occupies a region schematically shown in yellow .",
    "the wave function of a localized edge state is finite between the points a and b , if it is localized near a central ti layer . , width=226 ]    .",
    "let us consider the n - th element of the superlattice .",
    "it consists of a tunneling barrier and two adjacent ti surfaces .",
    "we assume that the ti films are thick enough , so that the tunneling between two opposite surfaces of each ti film can be neglected . for layered ti , such as bi@xmath0se@xmath1",
    ", this assumption is well justified even for thin films composed of 4 quintuple layers , as it follows from _ ab initio _ calculation in ref . .",
    "each n - th bilayer system contacts at its edges to side surfaces of ti films . at these edges a wave - function of the bilayer must meet with wave functions of adjacent side surfaces . in realistic structures these surfaces are not vertical and their angular orientation depends on film - growth conditions . in ref .",
    "[ ] a method has been suggested which allows to calculate surface - state wave - functions for an arbitrary crystal face of a three dimensional topological insulator whose crystal lattice belongs to @xmath7 space group . in this method",
    "each face is described by the polar @xmath8 and azimuthal @xmath9 angles .",
    "due to azimuthal rotational symmetry ( in the linear in @xmath10 regime ) the @xmath11-axis can be chosen arbitrary .",
    "therefore , we set @xmath12",
    ". the polar angles of the upper and bottom surfaces of a ti film are defined as @xmath13 and @xmath14 , respectively .",
    "further , for a facet characterized by the angle @xmath8 the effective low - energy surface hamiltonian can be written in the form @xcite @xmath15 where @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the angle - dependent velocities expressed in terms of the bulk ti velocities @xmath18 and @xmath19 @xcite ; @xmath20 is the wave - vector tangential to the face in a rotated @xmath21-frame .",
    "the spin operators @xmath22 ( @xmath23 ) can be represented as @xmath24 , where @xmath25 are pauli matrices and the unitary transformation @xmath26 is given by @xmath27 where @xmath28 and @xmath29 are pauli matrices operating in the orbital space .",
    "the angle @xmath30 is determined by @xmath31 . according to ref .",
    "[ ] , the surface state at a facet is characterized by a positive eigenvalue of @xmath32 .",
    "@xcite this condition is necessary to get a proper ( evanescent in the bulk of ti ) state .",
    "for example , the top ( @xmath8=0 ) and bottom ( @xmath14 ) surfaces of each ti layer are represented by @xmath33 and @xmath34 , respectively .",
    "@xmath35 is the face - dependent surface potential ( an energy shift of the dirac point@xcite ) which is measured relative @xmath36 on the upper face of each ti film . besides the inbuilt potential",
    ", @xmath35 can also include extrinsic terms of various physical origin .",
    "@xcite since the side surface is a 2d metal , the screening effects might screen - out the potential difference between horizontal and lateral faces .",
    "however , for thin ti layers ( @xmath3710 nm ) such a screening is not efficient , at least in the case of bi@xmath0se@xmath1 based materials , where the corresponding screening length is @xmath38 100 nm . @xcite for simplicity , it will be assumed that @xmath39 , although in reality for topmost and bottom faces of a heterostructure these potentials can differ because of different interface materials .",
    "in fact , they may differ even for internal layers of a superlattice due to asymmetry of the epitaxy - film growing process .",
    "@xmath40 is the zeeman interaction , which is assumed to be presented only on horizontal faces , where @xmath13 , or @xmath14 . for these faces",
    "the exchange fields have the same directions and magnitudes , so that in the rotated coordinate frame @xmath41 .",
    "it is important to note that hamiltonian ( [ htheta ] ) is valid only in the range of electron energies close to a dirac point .",
    "it contains phenomenological parameters , such as scalar and magnetic potentials @xmath35 and @xmath40 , which can be calculated by solving a three - dimensional problem of ti interface with magnetic , or other materials . besides @xmath42 and @xmath43",
    ", potentials of various symmetries can appear in ( [ htheta ] ) , depending on a specific interface .",
    "they belong to @xmath44 manifold associated with spin and orbital quantum numbers .",
    "these potentials are classified in refs . . within the low - energy expansion they are assumed to be much less than the bulk gap , so that they can be treated as perturbations to the ti - vaccum interface",
    "@xcite in practice , however , the effect of interface on ti can be very strong .",
    "for example , a contact of bi@xmath0se@xmath1 with the magnetic insulator mnse leads to a large band bending within the first quintuple layer of ti .",
    "@xcite such a shift is associated with a strong ionic polarization of the mnse crystal lattice . as it follows from dft calculations , @xcite due to the band bending the surface state which is localized in the near vicinity of the interface is shifted downward , below the top of ti valence band . at the same time , one more surface state emerges within the bulk gap .",
    "this state is mostly localized in the second quintuple layer .",
    "its spectrum looks as a dirac cone with a mass term @xmath38 4 mev .",
    "this mass term is related to magnetism of mnse in a rather complicated manner .",
    "however , symmetry arguments do not suggest much choice @xcite for the cleavage surface , but the mass term in the form @xmath45 in eq .",
    "( [ htheta ] ) . besides this term",
    ", six types of potentials that preserve the time reversion symmetry have been analyzed in ref . .",
    "it is argued that in the phenomenological low - energy hamiltonian their effect is reduced to a shift @xmath35 of the dirac point . for bi@xmath0se@xmath1/mnse system one can not expect that face - to - face variations of @xmath35 are much smaller than the bulk gap .",
    "hence , the low - energy phenomenology can not be applied on the whole surface of ti . on the other hand ,",
    "the shift of the dirac point can be tuned by various adsorbed species.@xcite also , the strong electrostatic effect from mnse and similar magnetic insulators can be diminished by a thin spacer layer .",
    "@xcite probably , other magnetic materials can be found that do not lead to the so strong band - bending effect .",
    "anyway , it will be assumed below that the magnetic gap and the dirac point variations are small enough , so that hamiltonian ( [ htheta ] ) can be employed for calculation of edge states .    in general ,",
    "the wave - function @xmath46 of the surface state is represented by a four - dimensional vector in the space of coupled spin and orbital variables .",
    "the unitary transformation @xmath47 effectively decouples these variables .",
    "indeed , in the new basis hamiltonian ( [ htheta ] ) keeps its original form with @xmath48 and @xmath49 , and @xmath41 .",
    "so , these operators do not contain orbital variables . at the same time , the equation @xmath50 , which filters the proper surface state ( evanescent in the bulk of ti ) , transforms to the angular - independent equation @xmath51 .",
    "hence , for all faces the @xmath52-vector is fixed in the pseudospin space , while it is an arbitrary spinor in the spin space . for each facet",
    "this spinor can be found from transformed hamiltonian ( [ htheta ] ) , which becomes an effectively 2@xmath532 matrix when the last term in eq .",
    "( [ htheta ] ) is ignored .",
    "this term can be ignored on flat facets , as it was discussed in ref . .",
    "nevertheless , we will see that it becomes important in the range of a boundary between facets with different @xmath8 .",
    "_ * matching conditions*_. in order to find wave functions and energies of modes that propagate on side facets , one needs matching conditions on the lines connecting neighboring faces",
    ". the matching condition can be easy established for a smooth boundary between two faces characterized by @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "let us assume that the curvature radius @xmath56 of a surface connecting these faces is much larger than the penetration length of the surface state into ti bulk .",
    "at the same time , @xmath56 is much less than the characteristic geometric sizes of a ti layer . in this case , on the curved surface eq .",
    "( [ htheta ] ) is valid , where @xmath8 is a function of the local coordinate @xmath57 along the line connecting two facets and @xmath58 .",

    "hence , we obtain the matching condition @xmath61 which guarantees the current conservation across the boundary . in the case of a sharp interface between @xmath13 and @xmath62 facets",
    "this matching condition coincides ( after unitary transformation ( [ rpsi ] ) ) with that obtained in ref ..    _ * wave functions of edge states on horizontal faces*_. for n - th bilayer system consisting of top and bottom interfaces of ti layers with a magnetic tunneling barrier in between , we can consider the wave - function @xmath63 as a two - component vector @xmath64 , where @xmath65 and @xmath66 are spinors defined on the bottom and top interfaces , respectively . on the other hand",

    "the real term @xmath72 is added to ( [ h ] ) in order to take into account a tunnel coupling of two ti layers . without loss of generality @xmath4",

    "the former term has no reasonable physical origin in the considered system .",

    "we will consider @xmath77 as a perturbation to @xmath72 .",

    "similar to fig.2 , one can see the odd number of propagating channels at each energy , so that the number of left moving particles is larger by one channel .",
    "in contrast , in a trivial phase at @xmath220 ( top plot ) the number of channels is even and a dirac point appears at , approximately , @xmath168 and @xmath221 .",

    "a dirac point at @xmath216 is seen in the top plot ( solid line ) calculated at @xmath163 .",

    "( [ kl ] ) for @xmath224 .",
    "this band of states localized in the @xmath3-direction resides on the parabolic - like dispersion curve in the bottom plot of fig .",
    "3 . as one can see from this plot , there are two more modes having the same energy as the localized state has .",
    "therefore , this mode is not protected from an impurity scattering causing transitions between the localized and itinerant modes .",
    "an inspection of energy bands in a broad range of parameters has shown that , probably , there are no isolated flat bands and that they always coexist with other modes at the same energy . in this moment it is difficult to say whether this fact is general , or it is associated with the specific model studied here .",
    "in this work the energy bands of electrons propagating on the side surface of a heterostructure which consists of ti and magnetic insulator layers has been studied .",
    "we found out that stable with respect to weak disorder isolated chiral bands , which could serve as carriers of a quantized hall signal , can exist only on the surface of a heterostructure having thin enough ( @xmath225 ) ti films .",
    "such bands have been calculated in the anomalous quantum - hall regime @xmath5 .",
    "in contrast , on the other side of the topological phase transition , at @xmath6 the energy bands have a quite different structure that resembles more the anisotropic dirac bands which exist on the side surface of an anisotropic ti crystal .",
    "we found out that a regular , as well as irregular in the z - direction heterostructure , carries the states that are localized at the vicinity of each ti layer and are characterized by a specific for each state wave - vector in the horizontal direction . in the regular case these states form a flat band in the vertical direction .",
    "an interesting property of such localized states is that they stay localized even in the case of a strong tunneling between ti layers .",
    "their localization has a topological nature and is associated with their specific spin texture .",
    "namely , electron spins on the top and bottom surfaces of a ti layers are oppositely oriented",
    ". therefore the tunneling is blocked , as far as spin - flip tunneling processes are weak , as shown in sec .",
    "the spin - dependent tunneling can be considerably suppressed if , instead of magnetic layers , the nonmagnetic layers are incorporated into the heterostructure . in this case",
    "the magnetic order and zeeman coupling in eq .",
    "( [ h ] ) could be provided by magnetic impurities in ti bulk .",
    "@xcite besides the spin - dependent tunneling , the localized states can be destroyed by a strong impurity scattering causing electron transitions between a localized mode that exists at some value of the horizontal wave - vector @xmath131 and itinerant modes ( if there are any ) at other wave - vectors .",
    "if the disorder is weak , the localized levels become broadened , so that a considerable density of such states can present in a narrow energy interval .",
    "this narrow band may show up in transport measurements .",
    "for example , in the four - contact measurements of the hall effect a pair of contacts could be attached to one of the several ti layers , while the other pair could be connected to the same layer , or to another layer in a heterostructure .",
    "it is interesting to measure difference in hall responses of these two setups when the fermi level is tuned into the band of localized states . in this case a sharp increase of the hall signal should be expected in the first set - up , even if the tunneling parameter @xmath4 is comparable to @xmath2 .    besides transport",
    ", flat bands can influence strongly on various phenomena involving electron - electron , or electron - phonon interactions , such as surface plasmons , wigner crystallization and superconductivity .",
    "the localized states , as well as the hall response are expected to vanish at @xmath226 . at the same time , the topological phase transition at @xmath227 can be realized by varying , for example , the temperature near the curie point .",
