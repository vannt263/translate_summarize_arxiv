    "ngc6712 is a small ( tidal radius @xmath10 ) and relatively loose ( @xmath11 ) and faint ( @xmath12 ; djorgovski @xcite ) galactic globular cluster ( gc ) that has not yet received much observational attention .",
    "its main claim to fame so far is due to the presence in its core of the high luminosity x - ray burster x1850086 whose optical counterpart may be a faint uv - excess object ( anderson et al .",
    "this fact presents somewhat of a puzzle since one would expect such an x - ray source to be located in a highly concentrated cluster where the stellar density favors its formation via tidal capture of a neutron star ( hertz & grindlay @xcite ) .",
    "most other sources of this type have indeed been found in high density core collapse clusters suggesting that , perhaps , ngc6712 has already undergone such an event in the past and is now in a state of re - expansion ( grindlay et al .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "this unusual situation may also be connected in some way to its galactic orbit as computed recently by dauphole et al.(@xcite ) that is fairly well restricted to the vicinity of the disk and penetrates very deeply in the galactic bulge .",
    "this certainly means that one would expect this cluster to have undergone severe tidal shocking during the numerous encounters with both the disk and the bulge during its lifetime and the consequences on the dynamical status of the cluster to be significant and observable .",
    "a simple single - mass approximation of these effects was computed by gnedin & ostriker ( @xcite ) for both disk and bulge shocks under differing assumptions on the galactic model with a resultant time to destruction as small as @xmath13h@xmath14 . according to these calculations , then",
    ", the cluster should have evaporated long ago and at the very least may have lost a very substantial portion of its original mass during its lifetime .",
    "clearly , this catastrophe should be well impressed on its present day distribution of stars on the main sequence ( ms ) with its lowest mass members beyond the half - mass radius particularly vulnerable to escape .",
    "this effect may well have been detected already in m4 , another cluster at significant risk of tidal disruption ( kanatas et al .",
    "@xcite ; pulone et al .",
    "@xcite ) , but until this cluster s structural parameters are pinned down more accurately this remains still speculative .",
    "there is , therefore , much interest today in determining accurately the present day mass function ( pdmf ) of ngc6712 to look for the signature of such powerful effects .",
    "currently available observations of the color  magnitude diagram ( cmd ) of this cluster , however , only reach to just above the ms turn - off ( cudworth @xcite ; anderson et al .",
    "@xcite ) and are , therefore , of limited use for this task . in order to push the observations well into the relevant part of the ms below the turn - off ( to ) , the vlt was used to probe deeply into this cluster with its unprecedented sensitivity and resolution .",
    "this paper describes the first results of these observations that give clear evidence that there is indeed a distortion of the mf of ngc6712 with respect to that of other dynamically much less disturbed clusters .",
    "the observational data used in this paper were collected during the science verification ( sv ; leibundgut & renzini @xcite ) phase of the first 8m - diameter very large telescope ( vlt ) at eso , using the vlt test camera ( vlt - tc ) .",
    "readers interested in the vlt and its instruments should consult eso s world - wide web at http://www.eso.org/paranal , while the scope of the vlt science verification is described in leibundgut , de  marchi , & renzini ( @xcite ) .",
    "images of the globular cluster ngc6712 were taken with the vlt - tc in the v and r bands . with a @xmath15 square pixel detector and a plate scale of @xmath16pixel@xmath17 ,",
    "the vlt - tc offers a field of view of @xmath18 .",
    "sv observations , however , were obtained with an electronically enforced @xmath19 binning of the ccd , so that the actual size of each pixel in these images is of @xmath20 on a side .",
    "observations of four regions of the cluster are available , located between one and two times the half - light radius ( @xmath21 ; djorgovski @xcite ) .",
    "the coordinates ( j2000 ) of the center of each field are given in table1 along with the total exposure time in each band .",
    "fields f1 and f2 were observed during the night of 1998 aug 23 , and f3 and f4 on 1998 aug 27 .",
    ".vlt  sv observations of ngc6712 [ cols= \" < , < , < , > , > , > \" , ]     the lfs measured in this way and corrected for photometric incompleteness are shown in figure3 as a function of the r - band magnitude .",
    "the lfs have been registered through a vertical shift in the logarithmic plane by imposing a least square fit in the range @xmath22 .",
    "the error bars associated with each point reflect the poisson statistics of the counting process ( and include the correction for incompleteness ) .",
    "these lfs can be directly compared to one another as they have all been measured at the same radial distance from the center ( @xmath23 or @xmath24 times the half - light radius @xmath25 ) .",
    "they show the same overall trend , i.e. an increase with decreasing luminosity up to a peak at @xmath26 ( close to the to luminosity ) , and from there they all flatten out and possibly drop with decreasing luminosity even after the incompleteness of our photometry has been accounted for . and indeed , to ensure that our lfs are robust , we have not included in figure3 any datapoints whose associated photometric completeness is worse than @xmath27 .",
    "stars brighter than @xmath28 have already evolved off the ms and , therefore , their lf provides no information on the underlying mf without uncertain corrections for evolution ( scalo @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , because of saturation at the bright end of our cmds , the brightest portion of our lfs is uncertain . for cluster stars which are still on their ms",
    ", however , the lfs in figure3 directly reflect the pdmf of the local population and immediately indicate a relative deficiency of low mass objects with respect to the stars with the to mass ( @xmath29m@xmath7 , ) , as we discuss below .    indeed , the most important conclusion that one can draw from figure3 is that the shape of the lfs completely deviates from that of any other gc for which relatively deep photometric data are available near the half - mass radius .",
    "observations carried out with the wfpc2 on board the hst over the past few years ( paresce , de marchi & romaniello @xcite ; cool , piotto , & king @xcite ; elson et al .",
    "@xcite ; de marchi & paresce @xcite ; piotto , cool , & king @xcite ; pulone et al . @xcite ; king et al .",
    "@xcite ; de marchi @xcite ) have consistently revealed lfs that , near the cluster half - mass radius , increase with decreasing luminosity from the to magnitude all the way down to about @xmath30 ( @xmath31m@xmath7 , ) where they flatten out and drop at fainter luminosities .",
    "inverted lfs such as those shown in figure3 have been observed right in the core of high density gcs ( 47tuc , ngc6397 , m15 ) but in those cases a simple isothermal model of a cluster in equilibrium can easily explain this effect as being due to mass segregation ( paresce , de marchi , & jedrzejewski @xcite ; king , sosin , & cool @xcite ; de marchi & paresce @xcite ) .",
    "more complete multi - mass king ",
    "michie models show , however , that thermal relaxation is much less efficient ( if at all ) at depleting low - mass stars near the half - mass radius ( see pulone , de marchi , & paresce @xcite ) , and we can not therefore trace the origin of the lfs that we observe back to the effects of mass segregation alone .    to make it easier to compare the lf of ngc6712 with that of other clusters , we display it in figure4 as a function of the absolute r - band magnitude , assuming @xmath32 and @xmath33 or @xmath34 ( djorgovski @xcite ) . rather than showing the three individual lfs ,",
    "we have combined them together into one single function by averaging their values in each magnitude bin , and have taken the standard deviation as a measure of the associated uncertainty ( error bars ) .",
    "the dashed line shown in figure4 corresponds to the lf of the low - metallicity cluster ngc6397 as measured by king et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , while the dot - dashed line reproduces the lf of the metal rich cluster 47tuc from hesser et al .",
    "( @xcite ) .",
    "both lfs have been translated into the r - band by using the m ",
    "l relationship of baraffe et al .",
    "( @xcite ) for the appropriate metallicity , i.e. the magnitude corresponding to each observed point in the lf has been converted into a mass which has then been used to read the corresponding magnitude in the r band from the appropriate m - l relation .",
    "the size of each magnitude bin has also been rescaled to reflect the difference in the slopes of the m - l relationships for different bands .",
    "we have selected ngc6397 and 47tuc as they both have accurate lf measurements at and below the to luminosity , where we have normalized them to our observations , and because the metal content of these clusters nicely brackets that of ngc6712 ( [ fe / h]@xmath35 ; zinn & west @xcite ) .",
    "it should , nevertheless , be clear that , due the uncertainties in the theoretical m - l relations and in the observed lfs , our comparison will only provide an indication of the true differences .",
    "the difference between these two lfs and that of ngc6712 is striking . while the lfs of ngc6397 , measured at @xmath36 , shows a steep increase starting from the to , the lf of ngc6712 sampled at @xmath37 slowly drops from the to all the way to the detection limit at @xmath38 .",
    "we would like to point out that the discrepancy is so large that to bring the two lfs into agreement would require us to have underestimated the photometric incompleteness by a factor of @xmath39 .",
    "the same reasoning holds true for the lf of 47tuc , which has been measured at @xmath40 .",
    "this difference must thus be physical and reflect the properties of the local stellar population .    under the simple assumption that the mf should be represented by an exponential distribution in the mass range @xmath41m@xmath7 , ( a reasonable hypothesis given the narrow mass range ) ,",
    "we have used the m  l relationship of baraffe et al .",
    "( @xcite ) appropriate for the metallicity of ngc6712 to reproduce the observed lf",
    ". we obtain a fairly reasonable fit to the observations with a power - law distribution of the type @xmath42 ( salpeter s imf would be @xmath43 ) , in which the number of objects decreases with mass ( solid line in figure4 ) .",
    "richer et al .",
    "( @xcite ) and , more recently , de marchi & paresce ( 1997 ) , vesperini & heggie ( @xcite ) , and pulone et al .",
    "( @xcite ) have convincingly shown that near the cluster half - mass radius the lf should closely reflect the imf , as dynamical modifications should leave these regions almost untouched .",
    "in fact , the internal relaxation mechanism governed by energy equipartition through two- and three - body encounters mostly affects the region within a few core radii , while the interaction with the galactic tidal field is expected to simply speed up the evaporation of light stars near the tidal boundary , but none of these processes should , in principle , significantly alter the properties of stars located close to the much safer half - mass radius area .",
    "if this were true for ngc6712 as well , one should conclude that this cluster is the only one so far to feature an inverse imf ( increasing with mass ) that has not been observed in any other environment . while this hypothesis can not be safely ruled out , there are far better reasons to believe that ngc6712 might have experienced a much stronger interaction with the galaxy than any other of the clusters studied so far . and indeed , with a perigalactic distance smaller than 300pc this cluster ventures so frequently and so deeply into the galactic bulge ( dauphole et al .",
    "@xcite ) that it is likely to have undergone severe tidal shocking during the numerous encounters with both the disk and the bulge during its lifetime .",
    "the latest galactic plane crossing could have happened as recently as @xmath44year ago ( cudworth @xcite ) which is much smaller than its half - mass relaxation time ( @xmath45yr ) .",
    "such an event might have imparted strong modifications on the mass distribution not only of the stars in the cluster periphery but also well into its innermost regions , perhaps even reaching the core where it could have triggered a premature collapse because of tidally induced relaxation ( see kundi & ostriker @xcite and gnedin & ostriker @xcite for a detailed description of this mechanism ) .    as a result of such a catastrophe",
    ", it would be surprising if the present - day mf were still to bear any memory of its parent imf anywhere in the cluster , including the half - mass radius region .",
    "vesperini & heggie ( @xcite ) have estimated that these effects would substantially decrease the slope of a simple power law mf , much in the same way as we are observing here .",
    "we , therefore , conclude that the vlt has revealed the consequences of the strong tidal stripping that the galaxy ( and particularly its bulge ) exerts on gcs orbiting close to the center , and which might have contributed to the destruction of an initially much more numerous population of gcs ( aguilar , hut , & ostriker @xcite ; vesperini @xcite ) .",
    "although kanatas et al .",
    "( @xcite ) and piotto et al .",
    "( @xcite ) had speculated that similar events could have happened respectively in m4 and ngc6397 , the result that we show here is the first , clear , unambiguous detection of this mechanism . to characterize the strength and extent of these phenomena",
    "more accurately would require the investigation of the ms population outside the half - mass radius in many more clusters , and possibly at larger distance from the galactic center , so as to probe the intensity of the stripping process as a function of the depth of the galactic potential well .",
    "if the z component of the space velocity of ngc6712 is indeed appropriate for a halo cluster , as suggested by cudworth ( @xcite ) , then this violent stripping process might not be restricted only to objects orbiting the innermost galactic regions .",
