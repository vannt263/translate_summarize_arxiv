    "<S> the strengths and weaknesses of these two types of colliders are well known . </S>",
    "<S> a hadron collider is best suited for searching the highest accessible mass scales since a sharp kinematical limit does not exist , but discoverability depends on the event rate and the cleanliness of the signal . </S>",
    "<S> an @xmath13 collider is capable of discovery essentially up to the kinematical limit , but this is much lower than what would be accessible in a hadron collider . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , it has become apparent that an @xmath13 linear collider with a center - of - mass energy in the multi - hundred gev range would be ideal for what has been termed  sparticle spectroscopy \" . at present </S>",
    "<S> though , in the search for new physics we have to make the best possible use of existing facilities , since information gathered there would illuminate the path towards higher energy machines . </S>",
    "<S> one such effort is being conducted at the tevatron , where the search for weakly interacting sparticles ( charginos and neutralinos ) has become quite topical , in view of the fact that the reach of the machine for the traditional strongly interacting sparticles has been nearly reached . </S>",
    "<S> this effort will benefit from an integrated luminosity in excess of @xmath3 by the end of the ongoing run ib , and possibly 12@xmath14 during the main injector era around the year 2000 .    </S>",
    "<S> in this paper we study the prospects for supersymmetry discovery at the tevatron via the hadronically quiet dilepton and trilepton signals which occur in the production and decay of charginos and neutralinos in @xmath0 collisions @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> our previous study @xcite considered the trilepton signal with an estimated @xmath3 of accumulated data . </S>",
    "<S> here we update this analysis by incorporating the latest experimental information on the trilepton signal and prospects for its detection with @xmath15 data . </S>",
    "<S> we also include for the first time the dilepton signal , which has been recently shown to be experimentally extractable @xcite , and as we discuss , has the advantage of allowing a significant exploration of the parameter space for chargino masses in the lepii accessible range . </S>",
    "<S> our calculations are performed in the context of a broad class of unified supergravity models , which have the virtue of having the least number of free parameters and are therefore highly predictive and straightforwardly testable through a variety of correlated phenomena at different experimental facilities . </S>",
    "<S> our study should give a good idea of the range of possibilities open to experimental investigation , and allow quantitative checks of specific models which yield the largest rates .    </S>",
    "<S> we consider unified supergravity models with universal soft supersymmetry breaking at the unification scale , and radiative electroweak symmetry breaking ( enforced using the one - loop effective potential ) at the weak scale @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these constraints reduce the number of parameters needed to describe the models to four , which can be taken to be @xmath16 , with a specified value for the top - quark mass ( @xmath17 ) . in what follows </S>",
    "<S> we take @xmath18 which is the central value obtained in fits to all electroweak and tevatron data in the context of supersymmetric models  @xcite . of relevance to our discussion </S>",
    "<S> , we note that in all models considered the following relation holds to various degrees of approximation @xmath19 among these four - parameter supersymmetric models we consider generic models with continuous values of @xmath20 and discrete choices for the other three parameters : @xmath21 the choices of @xmath22 are representative ; higher values of @xmath22 are likely to yield values of @xmath23 in conflict with present experimental limits @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the choices of @xmath24 correspond to @xmath25 . </S>",
    "<S> the choice of @xmath26 has little impact on the results . </S>",
    "<S> we also consider the case of minimal @xmath1 supergravity , where in addition we impose the constraints from proton decay and cosmology ( a not too young universe ) . </S>",
    "<S> the parameter space in this case is still four - dimensional , but restricted to @xmath27 , @xmath28 , and @xmath29 @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> we also consider the case of no - scale @xmath30 supergravity @xcite . in this class of models the supersymmetry breaking parameters are related in a string - inspired way . in the two - parameter _ moduli _ scenario @xmath31 @xcite , whereas in the _ dilaton _ scenario @xmath32 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we also compute the rates in the _ one - parameter _ moduli ( @xmath33 ) and dilaton ( @xmath34 ) scenarios , where @xmath35 is the string unification scale , and with this extra condition @xmath22 is determined as a function of @xmath20 , which is the only free parameter in the model . </S>",
    "<S> a series of experimental constraints and predictions for these models have been given in refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite and @xcite , respectively .    </S>",
    "<S> the processes of interest are    * _ trileptons _ : @xmath36 , where the next - to - lightest neutralino decays leptonically ( @xmath37 ) , and so does the lightest chargino ( @xmath38 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the cross section proceeds via @xmath39-channel exchange of an off - shell @xmath40 and ( small ) @xmath41-channel squark exchange , and thus peaks at @xmath42 , and otherwise falls off smoothly with increasing chargino masses with a small @xmath22 dependence . * _ dileptons _ : @xmath43 , where both charginos decay leptonically . </S>",
    "<S> the cross section proceeds via @xmath39-channel exchange of off - shell @xmath44 and @xmath45 and @xmath41-channel squark exchange , and peaks for @xmath46 . </S>",
    "<S> dileptons could also come from @xmath47 , with the appropriate leptonic or invisible decays of @xmath48 . </S>",
    "<S> both of these processes are negligible @xcite because the couplings of the @xmath44 and @xmath45 to neutralinos are highly suppressed when the neutralinos have a high gaugino content , as is the case when eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ masses ] ) holds . </S>",
    "<S> yet another source of dileptons via @xmath49 suffers from small rates for selectron masses beyond the lep limit  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the more important factors in the dilepton and trilepton yields are the leptonic branching fractions which can vary widely throughout the parameter space @xcite . if all sparticles are fairly heavy , the decay amplitude is dominated by @xmath40 or @xmath44 exchange . in this case </S>",
    "<S> the branching fractions into electrons plus muons are @xmath50 and @xmath51 . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> if some of the sparticles are relatively light , most likely the sleptons , the branching fractions are altered . </S>",
    "<S> the extreme , although not unusual , case occurs when the sleptons are on - shell . </S>",
    "<S> these two - body decays then dominate and the chargino leptonic branching fraction is maximized , , @xmath52 . </S>",
    "<S> light sleptons also affect the neutralino leptonic branching ratio .. </S>",
    "<S> ] when the sneutrino is on - shell and is lighter than the corresponding right - handed charged slepton ( @xmath53 ) , the channel @xmath54 dominates the amplitude , and the neutralino leptonic branching ratio is suppressed . </S>",
    "<S> this situation is reversed when the charged slepton is on - shell and is lighter than the sneutrino , which leads to an enhancement of the neutralino leptonic branching ratio . for sufficiently high neutralino and chargino masses , both leptonic branching ratios decrease because the @xmath40 and @xmath44 go on - shell and dominate the decay amplitudes . </S>",
    "<S> in the case of the neutralino , the spoiler mode @xmath55 also becomes kinematically allowed . </S>",
    "<S> these high - mass suppressions do not kick in until chargino and neutralino masses @xmath56 .    </S>",
    "<S> the results of our computations for the various models are shown in figs .  </S>",
    "<S> [ di-trilep.ssm2.eps],[di-trilep.ssm10.eps ] , [ di-trilep.min.eps],[di-trilep.nsc.eps],[di-trilep.kl.eps],[di-trilep.b0bnew.eps ] . </S>",
    "<S> the various curves in the figures terminate at the low end because of various parameter space constraints , whereas at the high end they are cutoff when the yields fall below the foreseeable sensitivity . </S>",
    "<S> , radiative electroweak symmetry breaking is only possible for @xmath57 . </S>",
    "<S> this is why there is no curve for @xmath58 in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ di-trilep.ssm10.eps ] ( @xmath59 ) , whereas there is such a curve in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ di-trilep.ssm2.eps ] ( @xmath60 ) . ] in most cases we note that the rates are higher for @xmath61 . </S>",
    "<S> this is a consequence of suppressed branching fractions for @xmath62 , but also a generally smaller allowed parameter space which requires minimum values of the chargino mass which may exceed significantly the present experimental lower limit . </S>",
    "<S> we can also observe that the dilepton rates indeed peak near @xmath63 , whereas the trilepton rates are not as large for light chargino masses since they peak at @xmath64 . </S>",
    "<S> it is also evident in the figures that for chargino masses below @xmath65 , the trilepton rates can be highly suppressed , while the dilepton rates are not , thus producing a rather complementary effect . </S>",

    "<S> threshold \" phenomenon is most evident in figs .  </S>",
    "<S> [ di-trilep.nsc.eps],[di-trilep.kl.eps],[di-trilep.b0bnew.eps ] and , as dicussed above , corresponds to a suppression of the neutralino leptonic branching ratio for light sleptons , , when @xmath66 is allowed .    </S>",

    "<S> dashes (  ) indicate negligible sensitivity . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     ' '' ''    </S>",
    "<S> the significance of our results is quantified by the horizontal dashed lines in the figures , which represent estimates of the experimental sensitivity to be reached with @xmath3 ( upper lines ) and @xmath4 ( lower lines ) . the lesser sensitivity should be achievable at the end of run ib during 1995 ( , prior to the lepii upgrade ) , whereas the higher sensitivity should be available with the main injector upgrade in 1999 ( , after the lepii shutdown but before the lhc commissioning ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the trilepton sensitivity with @xmath3 ( , @xmath67 ) has been estimated by simply scaling down by a factor of 5 the present experimental limit of @xmath68 obtained with @xmath69 of recorded data @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the factor of 5 is the expected increase in recorded luminosity , and a simple @xmath70 scaling is appropriate assuming the trilepton signal has no standard model backgrounds at this level of sensitivity . </S>",
    "<S> the sensitivity at @xmath4 requires a study of the background since small standard model processes and detector - dependent instrumental backgrounds become important at this level of sensitivity @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the sensitivity in the figures ( , @xmath71 ) is obtained by scaling up by @xmath72 the value given in table  ii of ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the dilepton ( plus @xmath73 ) signal suffers from several standard model backgrounds , most notably @xmath74 and @xmath75 production . </S>",
    "<S> a study based on the d0 detector @xcite reveals that with suitable cuts , in @xmath3 an estimated background of 8 events is expected , which would require 8 signal events at @xmath76 significance . </S>",
    "<S> the efficiencies for dilepton detection have also been studied @xcite , and they improve with increasing chargino masses , 8% is a typical value . all this implies a sensitivity of @xmath77 for dilepton detection . with @xmath4 one can scale down the sensitivity with @xmath72 , obtaining a sensitivity of @xmath78 .    the reaches in chargino masses in the various models , </S>",
    "<S> can be readily obtained from the figures by considering both dilepton and trilepton signals , and are summarized in table  [ table ] for the two integrated luminosity scenarios . </S>",
    "<S> the reaches in table  [ table ] translate into indirect reaches in every other sparticle mass , since they are all related . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , @xmath79 and @xmath80 ( in the @xmath2 models the numerical coefficients in this relation are slightly different , implying @xmath81 ) . it is also interesting to point out that the pattern of yields for the various models is quite different , therefore observation of a signal will disprove many of the models , while supporting a small subset of them .    </S>",
    "<S> it has been pointed out that the dilepton and trilepton data sample may be enhanced by considering presumed trilepton events where one of the leptons is either missed or has a @xmath82 below 5 gev (  2-out - of-3 \" ) @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> such enhancements would alter our reach estimates above , making them even more promising .    from table  [ table ] </S>",
    "<S> it is clear that in some regions of parameter space , the reach of the tevatron for chargino masses is quite significant . with @xmath3 </S>",
    "<S> it should be possible to probe chargino masses as high as 100 gev in the generic models for @xmath60 , @xmath83 , and @xmath61 , and in the two - parameter @xmath30 moduli scenario for @xmath27 . </S>",
    "<S> more generally , the accessible region of parameter space should overlap with that within the reach of lepii , although it would have been explored before lepii turns on . </S>",
    "<S> however , lepii has an important task : chargino searches at lepii will not be hindered by small branching fractions , and thus a more model - independent lower limit on the chargino mass should be achievable , , @xmath84 . with @xmath85 . </S>",
    "<S> equation  ( [ masses ] ) implies a kinematical reach of @xmath86 . </S>",

    "<S> [ di-trilep.b0bnew.eps ] , where we show the predictions for the dilepton and trilepton rates in our chosen one - parameter @xmath2 models , which are the most predictive supersymmetric models to date . </S>",
    "<S> it is interesting to note that in the moduli scenario , the mass reach for charginos could be as high as @xmath87 with an integrated luminosity of @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> further proposed increases in luminosity or center - of - mass energy of the tevatron collider have the potential of probing even deeper into the parameter space @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that detection of weakly interacting sparticles at the tevatron may well bring the first direct signal for supersymmetry . </S>"
