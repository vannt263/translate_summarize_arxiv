    "( @xcite ) , was also searched for fast variability and qpos ( e.g. , motch et al .",
    "@xcite , motch et al .",
    "@xcite ) , and in some cases the results were similar to x - ray data obtained simultaneously .",
    "optical periodicities of 1.13 ms ( imamura et al .",

    "finally , photometric data revealed a 14.8-h modulation of the brightness of the optical counterpart ( callanan et al .",
    "@xcite ) , which may be the orbital period of the system .    despite the fact that the compact object mass has not been measured ,",
    "gx  3394 is a prototype bhc in that it has shown all three of the classical black hole `` states '' ( see van der klis @xcite for a review ) : ( 1 ) the low state ( ls ) , with a flat ( @xmath3=1.52 ) power law x - ray spectrum ( tananbaum et al .",
    "@xcite ) and strong ( 2550% rms ) band limited noise ( oda et al .",
    "@xcite ) with a break frequency of 0.030.3 hz ; ( 2 ) a high state ( hs ) where the @xmath13  kev flux is an order of magnitude higher than in the ls due to the presence of an ultrasoft x - ray spectral component with sometimes an @xmath3=23 power law tail , and a weak ( few % rms ) flat power law power spectrum ; and ( 3 ) a very high state ( vhs ; miyamoto et al .",
    "@xcite ) characterized by high x - ray luminosity ( 28 times higher than in the hs ) , an ultrasoft x - ray spectral component plus a ( @xmath42.5 ) power law tail , strongly variable 115% rms band limited noise with a much higher cut off frequency ( 110 hz ) than in the ls , and 310 hz qpo . the 210 kev flux is higher in the hs than in the ls , but at higher energies the situation is often the reverse , and in some sources , ( e.g. , gx  3394 ; grebenev et al .",
    "@xcite ) the integrated 1200 kev luminosity is higher in the ls than in the hs .",
    "the order in which black hole transients have been observed in their decay to go through these states , and also similarities to neutron star states strongly suggest , however , that the accretion rate is highest in the vhs , lower in the hs and lowest in the ls ( van der klis @xcite ) . as noted by van der klis ( @xcite ) , there is some ambiguity in the way the hs has been defined . when only spectral data and no time variability data were available , the hs was loosely defined as any state where the ultrasoft component was not negligible compared to the power law component in the 210 kev range .",
    "when the variability was also measured , it turned out that the hs was also characterized by an absence of band - limited noise such as in the ls ; any band limited noise in the hs was thought to be a characteristic of the power law x - ray spectral component and therefore stronger at higher photon energy ( oda et al .",
    "@xcite , miyamoto @xcite ) , so this absence of band - limited noise , as observed , for example , in the hs of gs  112468 was also used as a hs criterion . of course , for the observations classified as hs with no variability information , we can not be sure of the noise properties .",

    "these break frequency variations , which anticorrelate with the level of the flat top take place without any correlation with the 220 kev flux ( belloni & hasinger @xcite ) or x - ray spectrum ( van der klis @xcite ) , but there is a correlation with the 40145 kev spectral properties ( crary et al .",
    "@xcite ) . on the basis of the similarities between ls and vhs noise , and similarities with neutron star phenomenology , van der klis ( @xcite ) suggested that the break frequency increases with mass accretion rate .",

    "this choice does not mean that we argue in favor of such a model over physically motivated models .",
    "however , the model provides a good fit to our data and its simplicity allows us to easily analyze the relative importance of each component as a function of source state .",

    "@xcite ) , the energy spectrum ( compare table [ tabspe ] of this paper to table 1 in iga , miyamoto , & kitamoto @xcite ) and the total rms ( upper limit , table [ tabpow ] ) are consistent with that of a typical bhc low state .",
    "more sensitive timing data would be necessary to determine if this is in fact a different state , or just a ls at a lower mass accretion rate .",
    "however , the july 1983 , march and may 1984 observations do not fit in with any of the classical bhc states discussed in section 1 .",
    "the presence of an ultrasoft x - ray spectral component , the steepness of the power law x - ray spectral component and the weakness and high break frequency of the band - limited noise make these observations very different from the ls .",
    "the presence of the band limited noise shows that the source was not in the hs .",
    "the x - ray spectral and power spectral characteristics seem to be most similar to a vhs , but the total 210 kev flux is an order of magnitude lower than that in the vhs ( miyamoto @xcite ) , and in fact _ in between _ previously reported ls ( iga et al .",
    "@xcite ) and hs ( makishima et al .",
    "@xcite ) levels , a factor @xmath54 away from each .",
    "although it was not possible to analyze the energy spectrum of the july 1983 data , the flux level and the characteristics of the power spectrum were similar to the 1984 observations , suggesting that then the system was in a similar state .",
    "gx  3394 in these observations seems to have been in a similar state to that which gs  112468 showed on 1991 may 17 , with a flux intermediate between the ls and the hs , an x - ray spectrum consisting of an ultrasoft component and a power law tail ( ebisawa et al .",
    "@xcite ) , and a power spectrum similar to that of the vhs with a break frequency of a few hz ( miyamoto et al .",
    "a 6  % rms qpo at 6.7 hz was recently discovered in gs  112468 in this state ( belloni et al .",
    "the lower count rates would have prevented us from detecting a similar feature in gx  3394 if it had been present .",
    "as its x - ray flux decayed , gs  112468 subsequently went through the vhs , hs , and ls ( miyamoto et al .",
    "@xcite ) , demonstrating the connection between source state and mass accretion rate ; the may 17 observation also in time occurred in between the hs and the ls .    based on this comparison we conclude that during july 1983 and march and may 1984 gx  3394 was also in a state intermediate between the ls and hs",
    ". we will refer to this state as intermediate state ( is ) .",
    "it is characterized by a 210 kev flux intermediate between ls and hs , a two component energy spectrum ( consisting of a soft component and a power law ) , and a band - limited power spectrum that is flat up to a few hz , and then decays at higher frequencies . in table",
    "[ tabgen ] we compare the general properties of the different states in gx  3394 , and in two other bhc s , cyg  x1 and gs  112468 . from this table",
    "it can be seen that in all cases the is flux is in between that in the ls and that in the hs ( and thus much lower than in the vhs ) .",
    "the is cut - off frequency is always much higher ( and the rms lower ) than in the ls , and in all three cases the energy spectrum is softer in the is than in the ls .",
    "however we note that the power law slope in gx  3394 ( 3.5 ) is different from that in cyg  x1 and gs  112468 ( 2.22.3 ) . due to the narrow spectral coverage , the actual value of the power law slope in gx  3394 depended upon the model adopted for the soft component , ranging from @xmath37 for an unsaturated comptonized spectrum , to @xmath38 for a blackbody spectrum .",
    "nevertheless it must be stressed that a power law was always needed , and that no good fit to the data was possible by means of a single component model . except for the flux , which is @xmath39 times lower , the timing and spectral parameters in the is are similar to those in the vhs . although this may lead to interpret the is as a weak vhs , this explanation should also account for the existence of a hs in between .    on the basis of a comparison of the anticorrelation between break frequency and power density at the break observed in cyg  x-1 ( belloni & hasinger @xcite ) and the values of these two parameters in the vhs of gx  3394 and gs  112468 , van der klis ( @xcite ) proposed that the noise in these two states might follow the same relation of break - frequency vs. power - density at the break , and are perhaps due to the same physical process .",
    "the intermediate state observations in gx  3394 and gs  112468 fit in with the vhs results ( fig  [ b&h ] ) , and by their closer association with the ls ( closer in flux in both sources , and also in time sequence in gs  112468 ) , strengthen this idea . the implication of this of course is , that there exists a correlation with mass accretion rate , where the break frequency increases and the rms decreases as the accretion rate increases ( see also van der klis @xcite ) , which would resolve the long - standing issue of the dependence of the break frequency on mass accretion rate in the ls . the problem with that interpretation is the absence of systematic 120 kev x - ray spectral variations in the ls which would indicate a systematic change in accretion rate with break frequency . however , the recent results of crary et al .",
    "( @xcite ) show that there _ is _ a correlation with the 45140 kev x - ray spectral properties , a steeper power law index and lower flux correlating with a higher break frequency .",
    "we note , that extrapolating the crary et al .",
    "results to lower energy , the spectra are seen to pivot around a point near 40 kev ( van der klis @xcite ) , so that on that basis one would expect a positive correlation between break frequency and 210 kev count rate .",
    "of course , this is not observed , perhaps due to the presence of a weak variable ultrasoft component even in the ls .",
    "our proposed interpretation of a positive correlation between break frequency and accretion rate in the ls and is would imply that the 45140 kev flux drops and its slope steepens when the accretion rate increases .",
    "this is similar to what is already known to be the case in the ls to hs transitions .",
    "finally , we consider the relation between break frequency vs. power at the break among all black hole candidates .",
    "the power spectra of many black hole candidates show various bumps and wiggles , and even clear qpo peaks ( e.g. , van der hooft et al .",
    "@xcite ) at frequencies around the break frequency .",
    "we point out that in spite of these complications , it is still possible to define the width , or the break frequency of such power spectra , for example by extrapolating the high and low frequency parts of the power spectrum to where they intersect ( the method we used ) , or by fitting a broad smooth shape and ignoring the residual peaks . using this approach , we have collected the relevant data on all black hole candidate power spectra in the ls , is and vhs , and plotted them in fig  [ b&h ] .",
    "clearly , there is a trend that is common among all black hole candidates towards higher break frequency corresponding to lower power density at the break .",
    "we point out , that in some models ( e.g. , narayan @xcite ) , the inner radius of the accretion disk is expected to move out as the accretion rate decreases , with radii as large as thousands of km ( an advection dominated flow region is supposed to form inside this radius ) , so that if the break frequency is identified with the keplerian frequency at this radius , this would be in accordance with the observed correlation .",
    "the 40145 kev x - ray spectrum becomes steeper and the flux in that range weaker as the break frequency increases ; it would be of great interest to see what such models predict in this respect .",
    "the picture that emerges from our comparison of the exosat data of gx  3394 to data on other black hole candidates is one in which bhc s move from the low state via an intermediate state to the high state as the mass accretion rate increases . on this trajectory , as a function of @xmath7 , the power spectral break frequency increases and its rms decreases in the way illustrated by fig  [ b&h ] ; the disappearance of the band - limited noise in the hs could be nothing else but the extreme consequence of this process . in the 40145 kev band",
    "the flux drops and the spectrum steepens with @xmath7 ; at lower energy there is a general increase of the ultrasoft component , but , as has been remarked previously ( tanaka @xcite ) , not in a way that is strictly correlated with the properties of the power law component .",
    "we note that the properties of the peculiar flat - topped outburst of gro 1719 - 24 , with an increasing break frequency ( van der hooft @xcite ) and at high energy a steepening spectrum and a slightly decreasing flux then suggest that the mass accretion _ increased _ during the plateau phase of this outburst .    the similarity between the is and the vhs band limited noise power spectra is remarkable , and it is a major challenge to explain why two such similar states would be separated by one ( the hs ) with no detectable band limited noise .",
    "a clue might be the fact that the vhs power spectra are violently variable , with rapid transitions between a band limited noise and a weak power law power spectrum ( miyamoto et al .",
    "@xcite ) .    *",

    "<S> we have studied the fast timing and spectral behavior of the black hole candidate ( bhc ) gx  3394 using all 120kev _ exosat _ me data : the july 1983 , march 1984 , may 1984 and april 1985 observations . in april </S>",
    "<S> 1985 gx  3394 was in a weak low state ( 0.03 10@xmath0 erg @xmath1s@xmath2 , 210 kev ) . </S>",
    "<S> the x - ray spectrum was a hard power law with a photon index @xmath3 of 1.82 and the power spectrum , though ill - constrained by the data , was consistent with a typical bhc low state spectrum . during the other three pointings the system was brighter ( 1.5 10@xmath0 erg @xmath1s@xmath2 , 210 kev ) , an ultrasoft component was present in the spectrum , and </S>",
    "<S> the power law was steeper ( @xmath43.5 in 1984 ; in 1983 it was not well - measured ) ; the power spectrum showed a flat - topped band - limited noise component with a break frequency of @xmath54.5hz and a fractional rms amplitude of @xmath57% . comparing flux levels , x - ray spectra and power spectra </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that in these observations gx  3394 was in a state intermediate between the usual bhc low and high states . </S>",
    "<S> the system was @xmath6 times brighter than in its usual low state , 4 times fainter than in its usual high state , and an order of magnitude fainter than in its very high state . </S>",
    "<S> we compare these results to those recently obtained on other bhcs , and conclude that this `` intermediate state '' behavior is a common characteristic of bhcs , that occurs at @xmath7 levels intermediate between the high and the low state . </S>",
    "<S> we argue that this result can be used to resolve the long - standing issue of the dependence of the power spectral break frequency in the low state on mass accretion rate , and strengthens the idea that low - state noise and very - high state noise may have a common origin . </S>",
    "<S> we briefly discuss a possible interpretation for the changes in break frequency in the low state and between low state and intermediate state . </S>"
