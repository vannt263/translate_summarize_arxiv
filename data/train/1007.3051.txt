    "0.1 cm    it s time to rethink the theory of special relativity ( @xmath3 ) established by einstein in 1905 . as is well - known , he put @xmath3 on two basic postulates : + @xmath4 .",
    "principle of constancy of the light speed ; + @xmath5 .",
    "principle of relativity .",
    "both @xmath4 and @xmath5 are `` relativistic principles '' .",
    "why we need both of them ?",
    "some authors have been devoting to reduce these two principles into one , trying to ignore @xmath4 .",
    "they might think as follows : once we already have maxwell s theory of classical electrodynamics ( @xmath6 ) in one inertial frame @xmath7 , the principle b would lead to the conclusion that the @xmath6 must hold in another inertial frame @xmath8 , _",
    "i.e. _ , principle @xmath4 must be valid too .",
    "all attempts mentioned above were doomed to failure because they overlooked one clue point : in order to transfer from one frame @xmath7 to another @xmath8 , we need a transformation bringing the coordinates from @xmath9 to @xmath10 . and in this lorentz transformation , an universal constant @xmath11 must be fixed in advance , otherwise the transformation would be meaningless",
    ".    however , the above argument , so - called a `` logic cycle '' , does hint that the @xmath3 based on @xmath4 and @xmath5 is by no means a final story .",
    "if we insist on discussing physics in one frame , there should be essentially one `` relativistic principle '' only . like everything else",
    ", the essence of @xmath3 can only be revealed gradually after 1905 .",
    "but where is the breakthrough point ?",
    "0.1 cm    there are three discrete transformations in quantum mechanics ( @xmath12)@xcite , quantum field theory ( @xmath13 ) and particle physics@xcite : + ( a ) space - inversion ( @xmath14 ) :    the sign change of space coordinates ( @xmath15 ) in the wavefuction ( @xmath16 ) of @xmath12 may lead to two eigenstates : @xmath17 with eigenvalues @xmath18 or @xmath19 being the even or odd parity .",
    "\\(b ) time reversal ( @xmath20 ) :    the so - called @xmath20 transformation is actually not a `` time reversal '' but a `` reversal of motion''@xcite , which implies an equivalence relation between two @xmath21 : @xmath22 where the equivalence notation @xmath23 possibly means some matrices in front of @xmath16 being ignored .",
    "\\(c ) charge conjugation transformation(@xmath24 ) :    the @xmath24 transformation brings a particle ( with charge @xmath25 ) into its antiparticle ( with charge @xmath26 ) and implies a complex conjugation on the @xmath16 : @xmath27 note that the @xmath16 @xmath28 implies a negative - energy particle .",
    "to explain it being an antiparticle , one has to resort to so - called `` hole theory '' for electron  the vacuum is fully filled with infinite negative - energy electrons and a `` hole '' created in the `` sea '' would correspond to a positron@xcite . but how could the `` hole theory '' be applied to the boson particle ?",
    "no one knows .",
    "( see the discussion between s. weinberg and dirac@xcite ) .",
    "\\(d ) @xmath2 combined transformation    if taking the product of @xmath24 , @xmath14 and @xmath20 transformations together , the complex conjugation contained in the @xmath24 and @xmath20 will cancel each other , yielding@xcite @xmath29 on the right - hand - side ( rhs ) , the @xmath16 should be understood as to describe an antiparticle .",
    "but it differs from the original @xmath16 only in the sign change of @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "what does it mean ?",
    "the historical discovery of parity violation in 1956 - 1957@xcite reveals that both @xmath14 and @xmath24 symmetries are violated in weak interactions . since 1964",
    ", it is found that @xmath32 symmetry is also violated whereas the @xmath2 invariance remains valid @xcite , which in turn implies the violation of @xmath20 reversal symmetry , as summarized in the review of particle physics@xcite .",
    "therefore , the relation between a particle @xmath33 and its antiparticle @xmath34 is not @xmath35 but ( as defined by lee and wu@xcite ) latexmath:[\\[\\label{anti }    example , for an electron in free motion , its @xmath16 reads @xmath37\\ ] ] while the @xmath16 for a positron is given by eq.([cpt ] ) or eq.([anti ] ) as @xmath38\\ ] ] note that the momentum @xmath39 and energy @xmath40 are the same in eqs.([elec ] ) and ( [ posi ] ) ( see eq.(16.51 ) in @xcite ) .",
    "the above relation should be viewed as a new symmetry : the ( newly defined ) space - time inversion ( @xmath0 ) is equivalent to particle - antiparticle transformation .",
    "the transformation of a particle to its antiparticle ( denoted by @xmath41 ) is not something which can be defined independently but a direct consequence of the ( newly defined ) space - time inversion @xmath42 ( @xmath0)@xcite : @xmath43 note that there is an important difference between a `` theorem '' and a `` law '' .",
    "various quantities contained in a theorem must be defined clearly and unambiguously in advance before the theorem can be proved . on the other hand ,",
    "a law can often ( not always ) accommodate a definition of a physical quantity which can only be defined unambiguously after the law is verified by experiments .",
    "two examples are :    the definition of inertial mass @xmath44 is contained in the newton s dynamical law : @xmath45 the definition of electric ( magnetic ) field strength @xmath46 is contained in the lorentz - force formula : @xmath47 hence , we see from eqs.([elec ] ) and ( [ posi ] ) that the familiar operator relations in @xmath12 : @xmath48 are only valid for particle , they must be supplemented by @xmath49 for antiparticle , in conformity with the basic postulate , eq.([ptc ] ) .    from the beginning , we have been believing that eq.([ptc ] ) or eq.([pe ] ) versus eq.([pec ] ) is the essence of @xmath3 .",
    "we derived @xmath3 from @xmath12 , based on this symmetry@xcite . among various arguments for this claim ( @xcite , see @xcite for detail ) , we will discuss the @xmath50 paradox in the next section before turning to another new arguments in our recent studies .",
    "0.1 cm    the famous paper titled `` can quantum mechanical description of physical reality be considered complete ? '' by einstein , podolsky and rosen ( @xmath50 , @xcite ) is not easy to read . quite naturally ,",
    "beginning from bohm @xcite and bell @xcite , physicists have been turning their attention to the entanglement phenomena of photons and electrons with spin . to our knowledge ,",
    "h. guan ( 1935 - 2007 ) first clearly pointed out that @xcite the original puzzle in @xmath50 s paper is involving spinless particles and what being overlooked is as follows .",
    "consider two particles in one dimensional space with positions @xmath51 and momentum operators @xmath52 .",
    "then the commutation relation @xmath53=0\\ ] ] implies that there may be a state with two commutative ( compatible ) observables : @xmath54 how can such a quantum state be realized ?",
    "guan s observation led to discussions in refs.@xcite , @xcite and @xcite , where another commutation relations like @xmath55 } & = & 0 \\label{xps2}\\\\    { [ t_1-t_2,\\hat{e}_1+\\hat{e}_2 ] } & = & 0 \\label{xps3}\\\\    { [ t_1+t_2,\\hat{e}_1-\\hat{e}_2 ] } & = & 0\\label{xps4}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] ( @xmath56 ) are considered in connection with a wonderful experiment ( in 1998 ) on an entangled state of @xmath57 system @xcite .",
    "now let us discuss it further .    as in @xcite , we focus on back - to - back events .",
    "however , the evolution of wavefunctions ( @xmath21 ) will be considered in three inertial frames : the center - of - mass system @xmath7 is at rest with its origin @xmath58 located at detector s center .",
    "the space - time coordinates in eqs.([xps])-([xps4 ] ) refer to particles moving to right ( @xmath59 ) and left ( @xmath60 ) respectively .",
    "then we take an inertial system @xmath8 with its origin located at particle @xmath18 ( _ i.e. _ , @xmath61 ) .",
    "@xmath8 is moving in a uniform velocity @xmath62 with respect to @xmath7 .",
    "( for kaon s momentum of @xmath63 ) .",
    "another @xmath64 system is chosen with its origin located at particle @xmath65 ( @xmath66 ) .",
    "@xmath64 is moving in a velocity @xmath67 with respect to @xmath7 .",
    "thus we have lorentz transformations among their space - time coordinates as : @xmath68 here @xmath69 and @xmath70 correspond to the proper times @xmath71 and @xmath72 in @xcite respectively . the common time origin @xmath73 is adopted .",
    "surprisingly , we see that eqs.([xps ] ) and ( [ xps1 ] ) are just realized by @xmath74 events with @xmath75 and @xmath76 being the distance between two particles when they are detected .",
    "note that eq.([xps4 ] ) is also realized in this case with @xmath77 and @xmath78 .",
    "more interestingly , eqs.([xps2 ] ) and ( [ xps3 ] ) can be realized exactly by @xmath79 events .",
    "for example , if particle @xmath18 is @xmath80 , then particle @xmath65 must be a @xmath81 with @xmath82 and @xmath83 ( see eq.([pec ] ) ) .",
    "so @xmath84 and @xmath85 implies the flight - path difference measured in the laboratory @xcite .",
    "a remarkable merit of experiment in @xcite lies in the fact that its data cover @xmath86 cases and so go beyond the epr - type correlation ( @xmath87 ) .",
    "however , the concept of `` simultaneity '' in time is relative and frame dependent as can be seen from eq.([lorentz ] ) : @xmath88>0 , \\quad ( t_2>t_1 ) \\label{19}\\\\    t''_1-t''_2 & = & \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-\\beta^2}}[(t_1-t_2)+\\beta^2(t_1+t_2)]>0 , \\quad ( t_1>t_2)\\label{20}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath69 or @xmath70 is the proper time of particle first observed in the @xmath57 system .",
    "we see that the `` causality '' is preserved because even at the epr limit ( @xmath87 ) , eqs.([19 ] ) and ( [ 20 ] ) remain positive .",
    "once a particle ( say @xmath65 ) is first detected , a destruction process on the coherence of entangled state is triggered .",
    "this process will be accomplished right at the detection of second particle ( say @xmath18 ) . in order to better understand why the coherence can be maintained within this interval ,",
    "let us stay at @xmath64 system and compare two velocities .",
    "the particle @xmath18 has a velocity being @xmath89 as expected . on the other hand ,",
    "the correlation between particles @xmath18 and @xmath65 has been established since @xmath90 until @xmath70 , during which a `` decoherence signal '' from particle @xmath65 is triggered and it reaches particle @xmath18 at time @xmath91 .",
    "the signal s propagation velocity must be no less than @xmath92\\,\\frac{c^2}{v}>c\\ ] ] which is superluminal ! however , we learn from @xmath93 that the wave s phase velocity @xmath94 , ( @xmath95 ) is different from its group velocity @xmath96 , _",
    "i.e. _ , the particle s velocity @xmath62 ( @xmath97 ) with their relation being : @xmath98 so @xmath99 as measured from particle @xmath65 .",
    "the inequality @xmath100 ensures the quantum correlation surviving throughout the time interval @xmath101 .",
    "the phase velocity is by no means an observable speed of energy transfer , but it does keep the wave coherence globally .",
    "by contrast , the destruction of coherence is triggered and accomplished by detectors locally . in the wavefunction ( @xmath16 ) of @xmath102 system",
    ", there are both @xmath80 and @xmath81 ( with their space - time coordinates ) in the wave propagating to the right or left side .",
    "actually , there is neither @xmath80 nor @xmath81 particle in the wave but a wave with its interference until particles @xmath18 and @xmath65 are detected eventually with only one particle ( either @xmath80 or @xmath81 ) at each side @xcite . in our understanding",
    "@xcite , the invisible @xmath16 is the amplitude of a `` fictitious measurement '' to show the relevant `` potential possibility '' , which turns into the `` real probability '' at a concrete measurement .",
    "hence @xmath50 were right : for better understanding the @xmath12 , one needs to study the two - particle entangled state , a nonlocal coherent state evolved over long distance not only in space but also in time . as shown by experiment @xcite and eqs.([xps])-([xps4 ] ) , being a quantum system with less uncertainty , it is easier to be observed .",
    "this is because anything could be and should be recognized only in relationships as emphasized by @xmath3 .",
    "@xmath50 were quite right : @xmath12 can not be considered complete in describing the physical reality unless ( a ) .",
    "we take the antiparticle with relevant operator relations , eq.([pec ] ) , into account : ( b ) . the relativistic relation between phase velocity and group velocity , eq .",
    "( [ velo ] ) , is also taken into account .",
    "0.1 cm    there is another symmetry equivalent to the invariance of space - time inversion , eq.([ptc ] ) , showing the equal existence of particle and antiparticle .    as noticed in @xcite , the lorentz force law , eq.([loren ] ) for an electron should be transformed into that for a positron by an inversion of @xmath1 as a substitution of changing @xmath103 into @xmath104 in classical physics .",
    "this is because the particle - antiparticle transformation has already been replaced by eq.([anti ] ) or eq.([ptc ] ) .",
    "moreover , we can see from eqs.([elec ] ) and ( [ posi ] ) that the space - time inversion ( @xmath0 ) is equivalent to changing the sign of the @xmath105 and @xmath106 , _ i.e. _ , changing @xmath1 .    however , it was not until 2003 that the importance of mass inversion became clearer as discussed in @xcite ( see also appendix 9c in the 2nd edition of @xcite ) .",
    "let us look at the dirac equation for a free electron @xmath107 with @xmath108 and @xmath109 being @xmath110 matrices , the @xmath16 @xmath111 is a four - component spinor : @xmath112 usually , the two - component spinors @xmath113 and @xmath114 are called `` positive '' and `` negative '' energy components . in our point of view , they are the hiding `` particle '' and `` antiparticle '' fields in a particle ( electron ) ( @xcite , see below ) .",
    "substitution of eq.([2spin ] ) into eq.([dirac ] ) leads to @xmath115 ( @xmath116 are pauli matrices ) .",
    "eq.([dirac2 ] ) is invariant under the space - time inversion ( @xmath0 ) with @xmath117 alternatively , it also remains invariant under a mass inversion as ( see also @xcite ) @xmath118 note that the transformation @xmath1 by no means implies antiparticle having `` negative mass '' .",
    "both particle and antiparticle have positive mass as shown by using eqs.([pe ] ) and ( [ pec ] ) respectively .",
    "this will be clearer later .",
    "0.1 cm    in nonrelativistic @xmath12 , a hydrogenlike atom ( shown in fig.1 ) is treated by schrdinger equation in the center - of - mass coordinate system ( @xmath119 ) as ( @xmath120 ) @xmath121\\psi({\\bf r}_1,{\\bf r}_2,t ) \\\\[5 mm ] = \\left[\\dfrac{1}{2\\mu}\\hat{\\bf p}^2-\\dfrac{z\\alpha}{r}\\right]\\psi({\\bf r},t ) \\end{array}\\ ] ] here @xmath122 and @xmath123 are the masses of electron and nucleus while @xmath124 is the reduced mass .",
    "eq.([shro ] ) is formally written down in a relative motion coordinate system ( @xmath125 ) with the `` point nucleus '' being its center and @xmath126 ( @xmath127 ) .",
    "thus a two - body problem is reduced into a one - body problem in a noninertial frame like @xmath125 .",
    "however , for relativistic @xmath12 ( @xmath93 ) , we can not bring two kinetic energy terms in the @xmath119 ( an inertial frame ) into one like that in eq.([shro ] ) ( see the page note after eq.([massinv ] ) ) . when dirac equation is used for a hydrogenlike atom",
    ", one just put @xmath128 directly into eq.([dirac2 ] ) , yielding @xmath129 ( i\\hbar\\dfrac{\\partial}{\\partial t}-v(r)+mc^2)\\chi =- i\\hbar c{\\boldsymbol\\sigma}\\cdot\\nabla\\phi        \\end{array}\\right.\\ ] ] notice that here two approximations have been made implicitly : + ( a ) the nucleus mass @xmath130 , so @xmath131 in eq.([mu ] ) .",
    "+ ( b ) the invariance of space - time inversion , eq.([inver ] ) ( @xmath132 ) , must be supplemented by @xmath133 even @xmath134 does nt contain time @xmath31 explicitly .    in our point of view , what eq.([vtrans ] ) means is : under the space - time inversion , while the electron transforms into a positron , the nucleus remains unchanged at all !",
    "hence the nucleus is treated as an `` inert core '' in eq.([dirac3 ] ) not only in the sense of ( a ) , but also in that of ( b ) .    in a prominent paper @xcite , by using dirac s method , marsch rigorously solved the hydrogen atom as a two dirac particle system bound by coulomb force .",
    "his solutions are composed of positive and negative pairs , corresponding respectively to hydrogen and antihydrogen as expected .",
    "however , surprisingly , in the hydrogen spectrum , besides the normal type-1 solution with reduced mass @xmath135 , there is another anomalous type-2 solution with energy levels : @xmath136 and , `` strange enough , the type-2 ground state ( @xmath137 ) does not have lowest energy but the continuum ( @xmath138)''@xcite .    in our opinion , these anomalous solutions just imply a positron moving in the field of proton .",
    "so all discrete states with energy @xmath139 are actually unbound , they should be and can be ruled out in physics by either the `` square integrable condition '' or the `` orthogonality condition '' acting on their rigorous @xmath16s ( for one body dirac equation , see @xcite , also p.28 - 31 , 50 of @xcite ) .",
    "on the other hand , all continuum states ( @xmath138 ) with energies lower than @xmath140 correspond to scattering @xmath16s with negative phase shifts , showing the repulsive force between positron and proton ( @xcite , section 1.5 in @xcite or section 9.5 in @xcite ) .",
    "marsch s work precisely validates our understanding : ( a ) the negative energy state of a particle just describes its antiparticle state .",
    "( b ) the coulomb potential allows a complete set of solutions comprising two symmetric sectors , hydrogen and antihydrogen . in the hydrogen sector , the negative energy states mean that the proton remains unchanged but the electron has already been transformed into a positron under the coulomb interaction .    however , the nucleus of a hydrogenlike atom maybe either a fermion or a boson like deuteron @xmath141 ( of a deuterium atom @xmath142 ) with angular momentum @xmath143 . to solve two - particle problem",
    "individually would be a daunting task , it could nt be rigorous eventually too .",
    "we prefer to improve the one - body dirac equation , eq.([dirac3 ] ) , at the least labor cost .",
    "it is possible , just let the reduced mass @xmath135 replacing the @xmath44 in eq.([dirac3 ] ) and claim the invarince of `` mass inversion '' in a noninertial frame ( @xmath125 ) , ignoring a small centripetal acceleration of the nucleus in the @xmath119 : @xmath144 such a reduced dirac equation ( @xmath145 ) @xcite should be tested by experiments . thanks to remarkable advances in high resolution laser spectroscopy and optical frequency metrology , the @xmath146 two - photon transition in atomic hydrogen @xmath147 ( or deuterium @xmath142 ) with its natural line width of only 1.3hz has been measured to a very high precision . in 1997 , udem _",

    "further theoretical modifications will bring the discrepancies down to one order of magnitude respectively @xcite .",
    "see appendix @xmath4 .",
    "0.1 cm    the well - known newton s gravitation law reads @xmath154 where @xmath155 and @xmath156 are the gravitational masses of two particles or macroscopic bodies with spherical symmetry .",
    "then an acute problem arises : can a body have a negative mass ?",
    "if so , a bizarre phenomenon would occur as discussed by bondi @xcite , schiff@xcite and will@xcite respectively .",
    "suppose such a body ( with mass @xmath157 ) is brought close to a normal body ( with mass @xmath158 ) and assume the validity of newton s dynamical law , eq.([newt ] ) , together with @xmath159 then according to eqs.([newt ] ) and ( [ ngr ] ) , the positive - mass body ( @xmath156 ) would attract the negative - mass body ( @xmath155 ) whereas @xmath155 would repel @xmath156 .",
    "the pair ( a `` gravitational dipole '' ) would accelerate itself without outside propulsion .",
    "incredible !",
    "the above problem was named as a `` negative mass paradox '' in @xcite .",
    "although a `` positive energy theorem '' was proved since 1979 , saying that `` the total asymptotically determined mass of any isolated body in general relativity ( @xmath160 ) must be non - negative '' , we believed@xcite that a thorough solution to this paradox will tell us much more .",
    "as we learn from @xmath93 , the emergence of negative energy is inevitable and is intimately related to the existence of antiparticle .",
    "the previous discussion enables us to establish a working rule : any theory , either quantum or classical , being capable of reflecting the equal existence of particle versus antiparticle , must be invariant under a mass inversion ( @xmath1 ) .",
    "so it is quite natural to generalize eq.([ngr ] ) into @xcite : @xmath161 where the minus sign holds for @xmath155 and @xmath156 ( both positive ) being both matters or antimatters whereas the plus sign holds for one of them being antimatter , meaning that matter and antimatter repel each other .",
    "note : the root cause of `` negative mass paradox '' is stemming from an incorrect notion that the distinction between @xmath44 and @xmath162 is absolute .",
    "but actually , it is merely relative , not absolute .    now consider a positronium and an ordinary atom .",
    "there will be no gravitational force between them , showing @xmath163 for the positronium relative to any matter .",
    "but its @xmath164 due to einstein s equation : @xmath165 with the rest energy @xmath166 being positive definite . hence the @xmath160 s `` equivalence principle '' in the ( weak ) sense of eq.([equ ] ) ceases to be valid in the case of coexistence of matter and antimatter . despite of its great success",
    ", @xmath160 needs some modification to meet the requirement of @xmath3 .",
    "indeed , let us look at the einstein field equation ( @xmath167 ) ( see _ e.g. _ , @xcite ) : @xmath168 on the @xmath169 of @xmath167 , the energy - momentum tensor ( @xmath170 ) @xmath171 is proportional to the mass @xmath44 of matter . hence the mass inversion @xmath1 will change the @xmath169 of @xmath167 but not its left - hand - side ( containing no mass ) .",
    "to keep @xmath167 invariant under the mass inversion , a generalization is proposed in @xcite that @xmath172 ( as before , the superscript @xmath11 refers to antimatter ) .",
    "notice that the form of @xmath170 is the same for both matter and antimatter .",
    "so under the mass inversion , @xmath173 and @xmath174 .",
    "thus eq.([ngrm ] ) can be derived from eq.([eins ] ) with modification , eq.([tch ] ) , in a weak - field approximation ( as described in @xcite ) .",
    "0.1 cm    there are two invariants in the kinematics of @xmath3 : @xmath175 @xmath176    in hindsight , it seems quite clear that eq.([spec1 ] ) is invariant under the space - time inversion ( @xmath177 ) and eq.([spec2 ] ) remains invariant under the mass inversion @xmath1 .",
    "however , these two discrete symmetries are deeply rooted at the dynamics of @xmath3 .",
    "their implication is focused on one common essence of nature : everything is in contradiction , _",
    "i.e. _ , it contains two sides in confrontation inside .",
    "for instance , an electron s @xmath16 eq.([2spin ] ) , has two components , @xmath113 and @xmath114 : @xmath178,\\qquad ( |\\phi|>|\\chi|)\\ ] ] where @xmath113 dominates @xmath114 . under a space - time inversion , eq.([inver ] ) , the electron transforms into a positron with @xmath16 being @xmath179,\\qquad ( |\\chi_c|>|\\phi_c|)\\ ] ] where @xmath180 dominates @xmath181 .",
    "note that the observed momentum @xmath39 and energy @xmath40 are the same for eqs.([elec2 ] ) and ( [ posi2 ] ) , using eqs.([pe ] ) and ( [ pec ] ) respectively.@xmath182}$ ] the variations of complex @xmath16s of electron and positron at a fixed point , say @xmath183 , as functions of time @xmath31 are depicted on fig.2 .    comparing eq.([psic ] ) to eq.([elec2 ] ) with eq.([posi2 ] ) , we see that the original `` charge conjugation transformation @xmath24 '' could be regarded as `` correct '' in form but `` incorrect '' in explanation .",
    "so the discovery of @xmath24 violation in weak interactions could be viewed as a warning that a correct understanding in physics needs rigorous language in mathematics , careful comparison with experiments and a sound logic in linking them together .",
    "if a theory ( _ e.g. _ , the `` hole theory '' ) can only be explained in ordinary language , it would be likely incorrect , or at least missing something important in the basic concept .    the symmetry between eqs.([elec2 ] ) and",
    "( [ posi2 ] ) ( or eqs.([pe ] ) and ( [ pec ] ) ) can also be ascribed to that of @xmath184 versus @xmath185 , showing again the beauty and power of mathematics .    by providing eq.([pec ] ) as a supplement to eq.([pe ] ) , the space - time inversion exhibits itself as the essence of @xmath3 to show the symmetry of particle versus antiparticle .",
    "@xmath3 is compatible or in conformity with @xmath12 essentially . in some senses",
    ", the reason why @xmath93 , @xmath13 and particle physics are capable of developing with vitality is because they have inherited their `` genes '' ( @xmath186 ) half ( eq.([pe ] ) ) from @xmath12 and half ( eq.([pec ] ) ) from @xmath3 .",
    "being different in form but equivalent in essence , the mass inversion seems more convenient in use for implementing the particle - antiparticle symmetry , especially for a classical theory .",
    "the prediction about the antigravity between matter and antimatter , though interesting , remains open to scientific verification .",
    "as now the antihydrogen atoms have already been made in laboratories on earth , it s time to consider the universe being filled not only with matter galaxies , but also with antimatter galaxies at remote distances .",
    "a tentative model calculation is currently being studied @xcite .",
    "recently , two experiments have been proposed at fermilab @xcite and cern @xcite respectively , aiming at directly measuring the free fall acceleration of antihydrogen in the field of earth ( quoted from @xcite ) .",

    "this is because an electron in motion as shown by eq.([elec2 ] ) does contain some `` hidden positron field '' described by @xmath114 , which is by no means a real `` positron particle '' ingredient with opposite charge .",
    "being subordinate to @xmath113 in an electron , @xmath114 can only display itself by various @xmath3 effects , including @xmath188 , the time dilatation and the enhancement of electron s charge at high - energy collisions , _ etc .",
    "_  similarly , in our opinion , the virtual @xmath189 pairs in the loops of vacuum polarization and self - energy of @xmath13 ( see figs.1 and 2 in @xcite ) contain no real antimatter content ( of @xmath190 ) too .",
    "while there are many arguments against `` antigravity '' @xcite , only further experiments can judge .",
