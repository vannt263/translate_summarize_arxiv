    "the results presented below are based on the publicly available data of cyg x1 , gx3394 and gs1354644 observations with the proportional counter array aboard the rossi x - ray timing explorer ( @xcite ) from 19961998 during the low ( hard ) spectral state of the sources . in total",
    "our sample included @xmath4 observations of these sources .",
    "the energy and power density spectra were averaged for each individual observation .",
    "the energy spectra were extracted from the `` standard mode 2 '' data and arf and rmf were constructed using standard rxte ftools v.4.2 tasks .",
    "the `` vle '' and `` q6 '' models were used for the background calculation with the preference being given to the `` vle '' model when possible . a uniform systematic error of 0.5% was added quadratically to the statistical error in each energy channel .",
    "the power spectra were calculated in the 216 kev energy band and in the @xmath5 hz frequency range following the standard x  ray timing technique and normalized to units of squared fractional rms .",
    "the energy spectra were fit with a model consisting of a power law with a superimposed reflected continuum ( pexrav model in xspec , @xcite ) and an intrinsically narrow line at @xmath6 kev .",
    "the centroid energy of the line was a free parameter of the fit .",
    "for all sources the binary system inclination was fixed at @xmath7 degrees , the iron abundance  at the solar value of @xmath8 and the low energy absorption  at @xmath9 @xmath10 .",
    "the effects of ionization were not included . in order to approximately include in the model the smearing of the reflection features due to motion in the accretion flow the reflection continuum and line were convolved with a gaussian ,",
    "which width was a free parameter of the fit .",
    "the spectra were fitted in the 420 kev energy range .",
    "this spectral model is identical to that applied by @xcite to the cyg x-1 data , except that in the present analysis we let the line centroid energy be a free parameter of the fit .",
    "strength of the reflected component is characterized in the pexrav model by the reflection scaling factor @xmath11 , which approximately measures the solid angle subtended by the reflecting media as seen from the source of the primary radiation , @xmath12 , so that @xmath13 for an isotropic point source above an infinite optically thick slab .",
    "the spectral model is obviously oversimplified . moreover ,",
    "several important parameters , such as the binary system inclination angle and the iron abundance were fixed at fiducial values .",
    "therefore the best fit values do not necessarily represent the exact values of the physically interesting parameters .",
    "particularly subject to the uncertainties due to the choice of the spectral model is the reflection scaling factor @xmath14 .",
    "this might explain the values of @xmath11 exceeding unity obtained for some of the spectra .",
    "however , as was shown by @xcite the model correctly ranks the spectra according to the strength of the reflected component and the slope of the underlying power law .",
    "cm    9.0 cm      the power density spectra in units of @xmath15 were fit in the 0.00515 hz frequency range with a model , consisting of two broken constant components and a lorentzian profile @xmath16 .",
    "we use centroid frequency of the lorentzian profile as a characteristic noise frequency .",
    "its dependence on the break frequency of the band limited noise ( the first broken constant component in the model ) is shown in fig.[pds ] .",
    "the results of the energy and power spectra approximation are presented in fig .",
    "[ refl_slope ] and [ refl_qpo ] showing dependence of the slope of the primary emission and characteristic noise frequency on the amplitude of the reflected component . the noise frequency and the spectral parameters",
    "are clearly correlated .",
    "an increase of the amplitude of the reflected component is accompanied with a steepening of the spectrum of the primary emission and an increase of the noise frequency .",
    "the photon index @xmath17 of the comptonized radiation is governed by the compton amplification factor @xmath18 which equals to the ratio of the energy deposited into the hot electrons to the influx of the soft seed photons to the comptonization region .",
    "the concrete shape of the @xmath19 relation depends on the ratio @xmath20 of the temperatures of the seed photons and the electrons , the thomson optical depth and the geometry . in the simplest",
    "although not unique scenario the correlation between the amplitude of the reflected component @xmath11 and the slope of the primary radiation @xmath17 ( fig.[refl_slope ] ) could be understood assuming that there is a positive correlation between the solid angle subtended by the reflecting media , @xmath21 , and the influx of the soft photons to the comptonization region ( @xcite ) .",
    "existence of such correlation is a strong argument in favor the reflecting media being the primary source of the soft seed photons to the comptonization region . in the absence of strong beaming effects",
    "a correlation between @xmath21 and the seed photons flux should be expected since an increase of the solid angle of the disk seen by the hot electrons ( @xmath22 ) should generally lead to the increase of the fraction of the disk emission reaching the comptonization region .",
    "cm    in order to demonstrate that such geometrical effects can explain the observed dependence @xmath23 we consider two idealized models having different cause of change of the @xmath21 . in the first , disk - spheroid model , an optically thin uniform hot sphere with radius @xmath24",
    "is surrounded with an optically thick cold disk with an inner radius @xmath25 ( e.g. @xcite ) , the @xmath21 depending on the ratio @xmath26 .",
    "propagation of the disk towards / inwards the hot sphere ( decrease of @xmath26 ) leads to an increase of the reflection scaling factor , a decrease of the the compton amplification factor @xmath18 and a steepening of the comptonized spectrum . in such context",
    "the model was first studied by @xcite and we used their results to calculate the relation between the reflection scaling factor @xmath11 and the compton amplification @xmath18 . in the second , plasma ejection model , value of the @xmath21 is defined by the intrinsic properties of the emitting hot plasma , particularly by its bulk motion with mildly relativistic velocity towards or away from the disk , which itself remains unchanged ( @xcite ) . in the case of an infinite disk , values of reflection below and above unity",
    "correspond to the hot plasma moving respectively away and towards the disk .",
    "both models predict relation between reflection @xmath11 and compton amplification factor @xmath18 which can be translated to @xmath23 given a dependence @xmath19 of the photon index of comptonized spectrum on the amplification factor .",
    "the latter was approximated by : @xmath27 this formula is based on a representation of the comptonized spectrum by a power law in the energy range @xmath28 and agrees with the results of the monte - carlo calculations with reasonable accuracy for optical depth @xmath29 and @xmath30 ( fig.[enh_slope ] ) .    \\9 .",
    "cm    the expected @xmath23 relations are shown in fig.[refl_slope ] . with a proper tuning of the parameters both models can reproduce the observed shape of the @xmath23 dependence and in this respect are virtually indistinguishable .",
    "the observed range of the reflection @xmath31 and the slope @xmath32 can be explained assuming variation of the disk radius in from @xmath33 to @xmath34 in the disk - spheroid model or variation of the bulk motion velocity from @xmath35 away from the disk to @xmath36 in the plasma ejection model .",
    "finally , it should be emphasized that these idealized models do not include a number of important effects which might affect the particular shape of the @xmath23 dependence .",
    "the spectrum of emission , reflected from a keplerian accretion disk is expected to be modified by special and general relativity effects ( e.g. fabian et al . , 1989 ) .",
    "if increase of the reflection is caused by a shift of the inner boundary of the accretion disk closer to the compact object , a correlation between the reflection and relativistic smearing should be expected .",
    "such a correlation is a generic prediction of the model and might be used to discriminate between different assumptions about geometry of the accretion flow .",
    "the energy resolution of rxte / pca is not adequate to study relativistic smearing of the reflection features with sufficient degree of confidence .",
    "however , the data shown in fig.[refl_gsmo ] might present an evidence in favor of correlated behavior of the reflection and relativistic smearing .",
    "if confirmed , it would prove that the spectral and timing properties in the low state of the black hole binaries are defined mainly by the position of the inner boundary of the optically thick accretion disk .",
    "in the low spectral state of black hole candidates the amplitude of reflection @xmath11 , slope of the comptonized radiation @xmath17 and characteristic noise frequency change in a correlated way . the correlation between the slope and reflection indicates that the accretion disk is the primary source of the soft seed photons for comptonization .",
    "we considered two idealized models , the disk  spheroid and plasma ejection model , and showed that with appropriate tuning of the parameters either model can explain the observed @xmath23 dependence .",
    "the rxte data also hints at a correlated change of the width of relativistic smearing of the reflection features .",
    "if confirmed by observations with better energy resolution , this correlation may help to distinguish between different geometries of the accretion flow .",
    "this research has made use of data obtained through the high energy astrophysics science archive research center online service , provided by the nasa / goddard space flight center .",
