    "interference effects induced by random potentials deeply modify wave diffusion up to even stop wave transport on a length @xmath0 , the localization length .",
    "this phenomenon called strong localization or anderson localization @xcite can be observed in classical waves such as acoustic waves @xcite , microwaves @xcite , light @xcite , as well as in quantum waves , such as electronic @xcite or matter waves in real @xcite or momentum space @xcite .",
    "anderson theory relies essentially on two main assumptions : ( i ) the potential has to be @xmath1-correlated ; ( ii ) the wave has to be noninteracting .",

    "correlated disordered potentials can be roughly divided into three wide classes , accordingly to the behavior of the two - point auto - correlation function @xmath2 and of its fourier transform @xmath3 .",
    "the first class is marked by a correlation function @xmath2 which decays exponentially on a length @xmath4 with @xmath5 , @xmath6 being the length of the system and @xmath7 the largest wavevector allowed by the system .",
    "these potentials , called short - range correlated potentials , may introduce resonance energies in the spectrum inducing delocalization of a significant subset of the eigenstates .",
    "this happens for instance in the random - dimer model ( rdm ) and in its dual counterpart ( drdm ) @xcite , in which the sites of a lattice are assigned energies @xmath8 or @xmath9 at random , with the additional constraint that sites of energy @xmath9 always appear in pairs ( rdm ) or never appear as neighbors ( drdm ) .",

    "there are no length scales characterizing the disorder , which is scale - free .",
    "these potentials are commonly called long - range correlated . in this case , it has been observed that correlations can have different effects depending on the energy region under consideration . in particular , for discrete models , a reduction of the localization length has been observed at the band edges and conversely an enhancement at the band center has been reported @xcite . in this context also",

    "the dipoles are polarized perpendicularly to the lattice axis , so that dipole - dipole interaction is repulsive . in this way ,",

    "the first is the effect on the divergencies in the localization length , discussed in the previous section .",

    "in fact for @xmath144 , the localization length takes values of the order of the system size ( @xmath156 ) signaling the presence of real metallic states in the system which extend over the full lattice . as the value of @xmath141",
    "is reduced , corresponding to slower decaying tails , peaks in the localization length are still present but they are shifted towards the band edges and their height is decreased .",
    "this behavior is somehow expected , since the perfect resonance condition , obtained with the single impurity calculation presented in the previous section , is no more fulfilled in the presence of several impurities with overlapping slowly decaying tails .",
    "the tails tend to restore destructive interference in the forward direction and thus introduce localization in the system . however , from the results shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : long_corr ] , we can conclude that the effect of short - range correlations remains clearly visible also in presence of long - range correlations .",
    "the second feature that we would like to highlight is the counterintuitive behavior of @xmath0 introduced by long - range correlations at the center of the band .",
    "in fact , depending on the set of parameters under consideration , long - range correlations have opposite effects on the localization length , which can either decrease ( left panel ) , or be enhanced ( right panel ) .",
    "this observation shows the highly nontrivial role played by long - range correlations in determining the localization properties of a disordered system and indicates a richer behavior with respect to what has been observed so far in the literature @xcite .",
    "these features that we extracted from the numerical simulations reported in fig .",
    "[ fig : long_corr ] are also captured within the born approximation .",
    "we do not report the curves for @xmath113 calculated in born approximation , and just comment that the agreement between those curves and the exact numerical results is good , similar to that observed in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] .",

    "born ] ) ; ( ii ) the integral of @xmath158 is a constant ; ( iii ) the longer the range of the correlations , the larger @xmath158 will be at the energy band edges . in the case of fig .",

    "the case shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : long_corr ]  ( left ) can not be explained based on similar simple arguments , since the increase of @xmath158 at the energy band edges implies a non trivial redistribution of the disorder spectral components all over the band . in the specific case",
    ", one observes an increase of @xmath0 at the energy band center , contrary to previous predictions @xcite .",
    "finally we would like to comment that we do not find the presence of mobility edges induced by long - range correlations as suggested in @xcite .",
    "in this paper , we considered a set of dipolar impurities pinned at random positions in a deep optical lattice which create a disordered potential for an atom in a different internal state .",
    "an analysis of the statistical properties of the model showed that repulsive dipolar interactions between impurities introduce short - range correlations due to the fact that occupations of neighboring sites are forbidden .",
    "the localization properties of the model were calculated by means of a renormalization - decimation technique which allowed us to calculate properties of very large systems and study the extended or localized nature of the states .",
    "we found that the presence of short - range correlations can give rise to different regimes .",
    "in particular , as the parameters of the system are changed , we observed regimes where one or more discrete sets of extended states appear in the spectrum .",
    "the occurrence of the different regimes can be predicted starting from an analytical expression obtained from the scattering of a single impurity .",
    "long - range correlations were studied not only for the dipolar case but also for a more general two - point correlation function decaying as @xmath160 , where the case @xmath139 corresponds to the dipolar case .",
    "we saw that long - range correlations in general tend to restore localization in the spectrum , but also lead to counterintuitive behaviors of the localization length .",
    "more precisely , depending on the regime under consideration , they can enhance or reduce localization at the center of the band .",
    "our work sheds light on the interplay between the role of short - range and long - range correlations and can be a guide for experiments devoted to the study of anderson localization with ultracold dipolar gases .",
    "natural extensions of the present work include the study of 2d geometries and the role of interactions between many test dipoles .",
    "this work was supported by grants no .",
    "cnrs-24543 and tubitak-210t050 , by the lia fsql , by erc through the qgbe grant and by provincia autonoma di trento .",
