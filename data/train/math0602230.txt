    "@xmath26 we use the notation @xmath27 .      a geometric reincarnation of the idea of encoding the topology of a sublevel set in terms of a morse function came ( back ) to light in 1982 through the work of witten  @xcite .",
    "roughly speaking , the _ morse - witten complex _",
    "consists of chain groups generated by the critical points of a morse function and a boundary operator which counts flow lines of the negative gradient flow between critical points of morse index difference one ( for details see e.g.  @xcite and  @xcite ) . in recent years",

    "in contrast to the classical action , the symplectic action is in general neither bounded below nor do the critical points admit finite morse indices , and most importantly its @xmath4 gradient does not define a flow on the loop space .",
    "it was a great achievement of floer  @xcite to nevertheless set up a morse - witten type complex .",

    "a hamiltonian function @xmath66 and an almost complex structure @xmath67 need to be chosen to define the floer complex .",
    "the power of floer theory lies in the fact that floer homology is independent of these choices .",
    "this is called the _ floer continuation principle_. floer showed that if @xmath66 is autonomous and a @xmath68-small morse function , then the floer chain complex equals the morse - witten complex .",
    "hence floer homology is naturally isomorphic to singular integral homology of the closed symplectic manifold itself . for introductory",
    "reading we refer to salamon s lecture notes  @xcite and the recent survey by laudenbach  @xcite .",
    "a discussion on a more advanced level , also including applications of floer theory , can be found in chapter  12 of  @xcite .",
    "now consider the cotangent bundle @xmath58 equipped with its canonical symplectic structure @xmath69 , where @xmath70 is the liouville form . since the symplectic form is exact and the first chern class of @xmath58 with respect to the metric induced almost complex structure vanishes , both topological assumptions of floer are met .",
    "the former excludes existence of nonconstant @xmath67-holomorphic spheres , which is an obstruction towards compactness of the moduli spaces , and the latter implies that the conley - zehnder index of 1-periodic hamiltonian orbits is well defined . since the 1-periodic orbits of the hamiltonian flow are precisely the critical points of @xmath59 and these coincide with the critical points of @xmath21 up to natural identification , the floer chain groups are again given by the free abelian groups  ( [ eq : chain - group ] ) .",

    "these and the symplectic form are represented by @xmath76 these three structures are compatible in the sense that @xmath77 .",
    "flow lines are then replaced by solutions @xmath78 of floer s equation @xmath79 it is the negative @xmath4 gradient equation for the symplectic action viewed as an elliptic pde .",
    "its solutions are called _ floer trajectories _ or _ floer cylinders_. if we identify @xmath58 and @xmath80 via the metric isomorphism and represent floer s equation with respect to the splitting  ( [ eq : splitting ] ) , we obtain the pair of equations @xmath81 for @xmath82 .",
    "the floer moduli space @xmath83 is the set of solutions of  ( [ eq : floer ] ) subject to the boundary conditions @xmath84 and @xmath85 and @xmath86 converge to zero as @xmath87 , and all limits are uniformly in @xmath45 . if the morse - smale condition is satisfied , then @xmath83 is a smooth manifold whose dimension is given by the difference of morse indices . since @xmath58 is noncompact , we do not obtain for free uniform apriori @xmath88-bounds for the floer solutions as in the standard case of a _ closed _ symplectic manifold .",
    "such bounds were established in 1992 by cieliebak in his diploma thesis ( published in  @xcite ) and recently extended to a class of radial hamiltonians by the author  @xcite and to another class of not necessarily radial hamiltonians by abbondandolo and schwarz  @xcite .",
    "given these bounds , proving compactness and setting up floer homology is standard . in the case",
    "that @xmath89 has several connected components , floer homology is defined for each of them separately and denoted by @xmath90 . here",
    "@xmath40 denotes a homotopy class of free loops in @xmath1 .",
    "( throughout we identify homotopy classes of free loops in @xmath1 and in @xmath58 ) .",
    "in fact floer homology can be defined for classes of hamiltonians more general than @xmath91 , for instance those growing quadratically in @xmath92 outside of a compact set ( see section  [ sec : as ] ) or convex radial hamiltonians ( see section  [ sec : noncontractible ] ) .",
    "when floer homology for physical hamiltonians of the type kinetic plus potential energy could be defined by  1992 due to cieliebak s breakthrough , the obvious question was _ ` what is it equal to?'_.    the first answer had been expected to be true by part of the community .",
    "for instance the problem was proposed as a phd project to the present author by helmut hofer during winter term 1993/94 at eth zrich . in summer  1996 upon meeting dietmar salamon in oberwolfach we matched up and started our joint approach .",
    "a short time later  @xcite appeared . in private communication at a warwick conference , around  1998 , matthias schwarz first told me about an alternative approach via a mixed boundary value problem . ] in the literature is due to viterbo who conjectured in his  1994 icm talk  @xcite  based on formal interpretation of the symplectic action functional as a generating function  that floer homology of the cotangent bundle represents singular homology of the free loop space . in his 1996 preprint",
    "@xcite he gave a beautiful line of argument ( for the component @xmath93 of contractible loops , case @xmath26 , coefficients in @xmath94 ) .",
    "the idea is to view the time-1-map @xmath95 of the hamiltonian flow as an @xmath96-fold composition of symplectomorphisms close to the identity ( set @xmath97 ) in order to arrive at the well known finite dimensional approximation of the free loop space via broken geodesics . while the argument consists of numerous steps and the idea of each one",
    "is described in detail , not all technical details are provided .",
    "also in 1996 a first example was computed by the present author  @xcite , namely floer homology of the cotangent bundles of the euclidean torus @xmath98 confirming the conjecture for all connected components of @xmath99 , for every @xmath100 .",

    "both floer homologies are naturally isomorphic by floer continuation .",
    "the key step is then to prove that for every sufficiently small @xmath104 the parabolic and elliptic moduli spaces can be identified .",
    "this means that the @xmath104-floer and the @xmath4 morse chain complexes are _",
    "identical_.    in 2004 abbondandolo and schwarz  @xcite proved existence of a natural isomorphism @xmath105 by constructing a _ chain isomorphism _ in the case of orientable @xmath1 .",

    "they assume for simplicity that @xmath1 is orientable .",
    "first of all , the authors set up floer theory for a more general class of hamiltonians @xmath66 and almost complex structures @xmath67 .",
    "let @xmath118 denote the set of critical points of the symplectic action @xmath119 .",
    "these are precisely the 1-periodic orbits of the hamiltonian flow on @xmath58 .",
    "the crucial ( metric independent ) assumptions on @xmath66 are the following .",
    "outside of a compact set @xmath66 is supposed to satisfy @xmath120 @xmath121 for some constants @xmath122 and @xmath123 .",

    "more importantly , assumptions  ( h1 ) and  ( h2 ) allow the authors to establish @xmath88-bounds for floer solutions associated to almost complex structures @xmath67 sufficiently @xmath125-close to @xmath74 . then the definition of the chain complex @xmath126 proceeds by standard arguments .",
    "any two choices of @xmath67 lead to isomorphic _",
    "chain complexes_. in contrast homology is independent of @xmath127 and denoted by @xmath128 .",
    "secondly , the morse - witten complex is defined for the hilbert manifold @xmath129 and the classical action functional @xmath130 . here",
    "the admissible lagrangians @xmath131 are those for which there exist constants @xmath132 and @xmath133 such that @xmath134    @xmath135 @xmath136    ( l2 )    for all @xmath137 . perturbing @xmath131 if necessary we assume from now on that @xmath138 is morse and denote the set of its critical points by @xmath139 .",
    "the classical action exhibits a number of rather useful features .",
