    "particle current trough a coherent mesoscopic conductor connected at its left and right hand side to reservoirs is usually described in the non - interacting case by a formula , due to landauer , based on the following physical picture : electrons in the left ( right ) reservoir which are fermi distributed with chemical potential @xmath0 ( @xmath1 ) and inverse temperature @xmath2 ( @xmath3 ) can come close to the conductor and feed a scattering state that can transmit it to the right ( left ) reservoir . all possible dissipative processes such as thermalization occur in the reservoirs while the system formed by the conductor and the leads is assumed to be coherent .",
    "the probability of being transmitted is a property of the conductor connected to the leads which is treated as a scattering system . in this picture , the probability that an outgoing electron comes back to the conductor before being thermalized is neglected , the contact is said to be reflectionless .",
    "this description of the non - equilibrium steady state ( ness ) current through a finite system has been rigorously proved in some particular limiting situations  @xcite , such as infinite reservoirs , but several difficulties prevail the understanding of non - equilibrium states in general and the description of current in more general situations , for instance in the case of interacting particles .",
    "two frameworks are usually considered to study these open quantum systems : one deals with the properties of the state of the total ( infinite ) system @xcite where reservoirs are explicitly considered as part of the system .",
    "the other is based on the master equation of the reduced density operator , obtained by tracing out the reservoirs degrees of freedom and is better suited to be applied to different systems and to compute explicitly some averaged ness properties , at the price of several approximations such as _ e.g. _ , born - markov ( see e.g. @xcite ) .    in this paper",
    "we explore particle current in a model where we mimic the leads that connect the reservoirs with the system , as a finite non - interacting system with a finite number of levels ( which we call meso - reservoir ) .",
    "the reservoirs ( called here super - reservoirs ) are modeled by local lindblad operators representing the effect that a markovian macroscopic reservoirs have over the meso - reservoirs . in sec .",
    "[ sec.2 ] we introduce the model and briefly review the method we use to solve it . in sec .",
    "[ sec.3 ] we analyze the particle current operator and indicate the quantities that should be computed for a full description of the current . in sec .",
    "[ landauer ] we briefly present the landauer formula that is expected to apply in some appropriate limits to our model and in sec .  [ numeric ] we analyze the numerical results we obtained with our model and compare them with the current predicted by the landauer formula , validating the applicability of our model but also going beyond by computing the full probability distribution function ( pdf ) of the current . in sec .",
    "[ conclu ] we present some conclusions and discuss interesting perspectives of our study .",
    "we consider a one - dimensional quantum chain of spinless fermions coupled at its boundaries to meso - reservoirs comprising a finite number of spinless fermions with wave number @xmath4 ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "the hamiltonian of the total system can be written as @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the hamiltonian of the chain with @xmath8 the nearest neighbor hopping , @xmath9 the onsite potential and @xmath10 the annihilation / creation operator for the spinless fermions on the site @xmath11 of the chain ( conductor ) .",
    "the chain interacts through the term @xmath12 with the meso - reservoirs @xmath13 . here",
    "@xmath14 denotes the left and right meso - reservoir .",
    "they share the same spectrum with a constant density of states @xmath15 in the band @xmath16 $ ] described by @xmath17 and @xmath18 are annihilation / creation operator of the left and right meso - reservoirs .",
    "the system is coupled to the leads only at the extreme sites of the chain with coupling strength @xmath19 that we choose @xmath4-independent   dependent super - reservoir to meso - reservoir couplings @xmath20 @xmath21 .",
    "we assume that the density matrix of the chain - meso - reservoirs system evolves according to the many - body lindblad equation @xmath22   + \\sum_{k,\\alpha , m } \\left ( 2l_{k , \\alpha , m } \\rho l_{k , \\alpha , m}^\\dag -\\{l_{k , \\alpha , m}^\\dag l_{k , \\alpha , m},\\rho\\ } \\right ) , \\label{eq : lindbladmodel}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath23 and @xmath24 are operators representing the coupling of the meso - reservoirs to the super - reservoirs , @xmath25 are fermi distributions , with inverse temperatures @xmath26 and chemical potentials @xmath27 , and @xmath28 $ ] and @xmath29 denote the commutator and anti - commutator , respectively .",
    "the parameter @xmath30 determines the strength of the coupling to the super - reservoirs and to keep the model as simple as possible we take it constant .",
    "the form of the lindblad dissipators is such that in the absence of coupling to the chain ( i.e. @xmath31 ) , when the meso - reservoir is only coupled to the super - reservoir , the former is in an equilibrium state described by fermi distribution .",
    "@xcite .",
    "to analyze our model we use the formalism developed in @xcite .",
    "there it is shown that the spectrum of the evolution superoperator is given in terms of the eigenvalues @xmath32 ( so - called rapidities ) of a matrix @xmath33 which in our case is given by @xmath34 where @xmath35 and @xmath36 denote @xmath37 zero matrix and @xmath38 unit matrix , @xmath39 is the pauli matrix , and @xmath40 is a matrix which defines the quadratic form of the hamiltonian , as @xmath41 in terms of fermionic operators @xmath42 .",
    "the ness average of a quadratic observable like @xmath43 is given  @xcite in terms of the solution @xmath44 of the lyapunov equation @xmath45 with @xmath46 and @xmath47 as follows : consider the change of variables @xmath48 , the ness average of the quadratic observable @xmath49 is determined by the matrix @xmath44 through the relation @xmath50 .",
    "wick s theorem can be used to obtain expectations of higher - order observables and in fact , the full probability distribution for these expectation values in some cases .",
    "the operator representing the current flowing from the @xmath4-th level of the meso - reservoir to the chain is given by @xmath51 while the current trough the site @xmath52 of the chain is @xmath53 in the steady state the average current is conserved in this model  @xcite and thus @xmath54 is independent of @xmath52 .",
    "moreover , if we define the current from the left meso - reservoir as @xmath55 , we have that @xmath56 .",
    "it is not difficult to note that current satisfies @xmath57 with @xmath58 now we are in a position to compute the full non equilibrium current distribution in terms of @xmath59 and @xmath60 . for this",
    "we consider the generating function @xmath61 which , using eq.([moments ] ) , gives @xmath62 the probability distribution @xmath63 is the inverse fourier transform of @xmath64 , thus we get @xmath65 which is normalized .",
    "we note that normality and positivity of probability lead an interesting inequality : @xmath66 an equivalent result holds for the current from the @xmath4-level of the meso - reservoir to the system : @xmath67    these expressions are expected because @xmath68 and @xmath69 are the possible eigenvalues of the operator @xmath70 ( similarly for @xmath71 ) , but they show that @xmath59 and @xmath60 contains all the information about the current .",
    "we will study these quantities numerically , thus we need to solve the above mentioned lyapunov equation and note that in the @xmath72 variables ( we use the primed variables to indicate indices as they appear in variable @xmath73 , i.e. if @xmath11 is a site in the chain , then @xmath74 ) @xmath75 thus @xmath76 and @xmath77 wick s theorem implies @xmath78    to simplify the discussion , in what follows we reduce the number of parameters by assuming constant hopping and onsite energy @xmath79 and @xmath80 .",
    "moreover we fix @xmath30 such that @xmath81 . in that case",
    ", we showed @xcite that the transport quantities become roughly independent of @xmath30 .",
    "in fact , in that case , the coupling super - reservoir  meso - reservoir is stronger than that of the system ( chain )  meso - reservoir .",
    "then the meso - reservoir are driven to a near equilibrium state weakly dependent of @xmath30 .",
    "we explore now the behavior of the current as a function of @xmath15 , @xmath82 , @xmath83 and contrast the observation with expectations based on the landauer formula .",
    "qualitative explanation of the current behavior is also provided .",
    "the landauer formula  @xcite provides an almost explicit expression for the ness average current as a function of the parameters of the system . in units",

    "the self energies @xmath91 have only terms at the boundaries of the chains  @xcite i.e. , @xmath92 , where @xmath93 if @xmath94 and @xmath95 if @xmath96 and @xmath97 recalling that both leads have the same spectrum , we assume a constant density of lead states @xmath98 in the range @xmath16 $ ] , thus @xmath99 is independent of @xmath100 inside the interval and zero otherwise . for the real part of the self - energy we have the principal value integral @xmath101",
    "the landauer formula is expected to hold when the leads have a dense and wide spectrum .",
    "therefore , we restrict ourselves to the case that @xmath102 and @xmath103 , the so called wide - band limit , where @xmath104 can be neglected .",
    "the transmission coefficient is then @xmath105 and we need to compute the wide - band limit retarded green function @xmath106 note that in the previous expression we have set @xmath107 which sets the energy axis origin and @xmath108 which sets the energy scale .",
