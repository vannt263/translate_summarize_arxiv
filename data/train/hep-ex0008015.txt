    "measurements of weak decays of @xmath17 mesons are fundamental to testing and understanding the standard model .",

    "the first error is the combined statistical and systematic uncertainties , and the second is due to the uncertainty in the @xmath15 branching fraction .",
    "this is significantly larger than the sum of @xmath9 production from exclusive @xmath20 modes observed to date@xcite .",
    "these exclusive modes , of the form @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , and @xmath24 , sum to @xmath25 for the @xmath26 case and @xmath27 for the @xmath28 .",
    "this yields a deficit of @xmath29 for the @xmath26 and @xmath30 for the @xmath28 , where the @xmath15 branching fraction uncertainty does not affect this difference@xcite .",

    "first evidence is offered for the decay @xmath43 , where @xmath3 denotes the sum of the @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and @xmath6 @xmath7 charm meson states .",
    "this decay mode may bridge a substantial portion of the inclusive and exclusive rate difference . also reported are improved measurements of the modes @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "these decays occur predominantly via the spectator diagram of figure  [ feynman ] ; the @xmath44 decays into a @xmath9 or @xmath8 meson , and the charm anti - quark and spectator quark hadronize as either a @xmath45 or @xmath34 meson .",
    "additionally , this article presents the first measurement of @xmath8 polarization for the mode @xmath1 , providing an effective test of the factorization assumption in @xmath46 decays with high @xmath47 , where @xmath48 , and @xmath49 is a vector meson .",
    "factorization assumes the lack of final state interactions between the products of hadronic @xmath17 decays , and has successfully predicted the vector - vector polarization of the low @xmath47 mode @xmath50@xcite .",
    "it is possible that the factorization assumption of no final state interactions may be simplistic and inapplicable to modes of higher @xmath47 such as @xmath1 ; however , the results presented here are consistent with the factorization prediction .",
    "previous measurements of @xmath0 and @xmath1 at cleo and argus made use of the full reconstruction technique@xcite@xcite , which requires reconstruction of all particles in the final state .",
    "the most recent cleo results using full reconstruction reported relatively small event yields of @xmath51 and @xmath52 in the @xmath37 and @xmath39 channels , respectively .",
    "following these , a partial reconstruction technique was developed that required only some of the @xmath1 final state particles , reporting an increased sample size of @xmath53 events@xcite .",
    "this analysis employs a more refined partial reconstruction technique , using only the @xmath9 and the soft pion @xmath10 from the @xmath54 decay , thereby increasing the statistics over full reconstruction by a factor between five and eight , depending on mode .",
    "the analysis is sensitive to any @xmath55 final state , such as @xmath56 , when @xmath57 .",
    "the method is based on techniques developed by cleo for improved measurement of @xmath15@xcite and @xmath58@xcite .",
    "after a short description of the detector and the criteria used for selecting charged particle candidates in section  [ event_sel ] , the @xmath9 and @xmath10 reconstruction is described in section  [ ds_rec ] . in section  [ 1d_discuss ] the partial reconstruction technique is developed for separating the combined @xmath59 signal from background .",
    "once the background levels have been determined , in section  [ 2d_discuss ] a two - dimensional parameter space is defined and used to separate the individual @xmath36 , @xmath38 , and @xmath40 signals , followed by a review of systematic errors in section  [ sys_discuss ] .",
    "the polarization of @xmath38 production is measured and compared with the factorization prediction in section  [ factorization ] , and the results summarized and discussed in the final section .",
    "the data used in this analysis were collected at the cornell electron storage ring ( cesr ) between 1990 and 1995 , and consist of hadronic events produced in @xmath60 annihilations .",
    "the integrated luminosity of this data sample is @xmath61 @xmath62 collected at the @xmath63 resonance ( referred to as on - resonance data ) , and @xmath64 @xmath62 from a center - of - mass energy just below the threshold for producing @xmath65 mesons ( referred to as off - resonance or continuum data ) .",
    "the on - resonance data corresponds to @xmath66 @xmath65 pairs .",
    "the cleo ii detector is used to measure both neutral and charged particles with excellent resolution and efficiency@xcite .",
    "hadronic events are selected by requiring a minimum of three charged tracks , a total visible energy greater than 15% of the center - of - mass energy ( this reduces contamination from two - photon interactions and beam - gas events ) , and a primary vertex within @xmath67 cm in the @xmath68 direction and @xmath69 cm in the @xmath70-@xmath71 plane of the beam centroid .",
    "charged tracks are required to be of good quality and consistent with the primary vertex in both the @xmath70-@xmath71 and @xmath70-@xmath68 planes .",
    "tracks must also have @xmath72 and time - of - flight information consistent with their pion or kaon hypotheses , when such information exists and is of good quality .",
    "apart from the visible energy criterion , neutral particles were not used in this analysis .",
    "a geant@xcite based monte carlo simulation was used to generate large samples of the individual @xmath59 signal modes from @xmath73 decays , and model their interactions with the cleo detector .",
    "these samples were then processed in the same manner as the data .",
    "further discussion of the simulation is given in the treatment of systematic errors .",
    "the @xmath9 is reconstructed through the @xmath15 , @xmath76 decay channel , which has a signal - to - background ratio nearly two times higher than the next cleanest @xmath9 decay mode@xcite .",
    "fast @xmath77/@xmath78 tracks ( @xmath79 ) must originate within @xmath67 cm in the @xmath68 direction and @xmath67 mm in the @xmath70-@xmath71 plane of the beam centroid . for slow @xmath77/@xmath78 tracks ( @xmath80 ) the @xmath68 requirement",
    "is loosened to within @xmath81 cm .",

    "two angles are used in suppressing background .",
    "the first is the @xmath9 decay angle @xmath83 , which is the angle between the @xmath71 direction in the @xmath9 rest frame and the @xmath9 boost direction .",
    "requiring @xmath84 eliminates a large combinatoric background peak near @xmath85 resulting from the numerous low momentum pions , while the signal is constant in @xmath86 .",
    "the second angle is @xmath87 , the @xmath71 decay angle between the @xmath78 and @xmath9 direction in the @xmath71 rest frame . due to the @xmath71 helicity",
    "the signal follows a @xmath88 distribution while the background is constant in @xmath89 .",
    "requiring @xmath90 removes 35% of the background and retains 96% of signal .",
    "the resulting @xmath91 invariant mass spectrum is shown in figure  [ ds_mass ] , and the @xmath91 mass is then required to be within 12 mev of the @xmath9 mass . finally , the kinematics of @xmath56 decays constrain the magnitude of @xmath9 momentum to between 1250 mev/@xmath92 and 1925 mev/@xmath92 , and these requirements are imposed here .    the slow pion @xmath75 from the @xmath93 must have charge opposite to the @xmath9 and originate within @xmath67 mm in the @xmath70-@xmath71 plane of the primary vertex .",
    "no @xmath68 requirement is placed on the @xmath75 , but it must have a momentum greater than 50 mev/@xmath92 and less than 210 mev/@xmath92 .",
    "at the cleo ii experiment , @xmath60 collisions can create an @xmath63 resonance , which decays to a pair of @xmath17 mesons .",
    "the @xmath17 s are produced nearly at rest ( @xmath95 ) and , for the decay chain @xmath96 , @xmath0 , and @xmath97 , the @xmath9 and soft pion @xmath75 are nearly back - to - back in the lab frame because of the small @xmath98 mev energy release in the @xmath97 transition . by making use of their relative direction , as well as the beam energy and kinematic constraints of the decay ,",
    "the @xmath9 and the @xmath10 allow reconstruction of the @xmath37 final state .",
    "other two - body @xmath17 decays leading to @xmath37 final states , with strong @xmath99 correlations , are summarized in table  [ detected_modes ] .",
    "these are modes producing a @xmath8 that decays to @xmath100 or @xmath101 , or producing a @xmath34 that decays to @xmath102 .",
    "it should be noted that this method is not sensitive to @xmath103 , as the @xmath104 decays predominantly to @xmath105 and no @xmath106 decays have been observed@xcite .",

    "the uncertainty in the total number of @xmath65 meson pairs introduces a systematic error of 1.8% .",
    "the two - dimensional fit to the data estimates the total amount of @xmath59 signal at 323.2 events . since the previous one - dimensional fit to the @xmath109 distribution , summarized in table  [ 1d_results ] ,",
    "determined the level of @xmath59 signal at @xmath110 , the two - dimensional fit result overestimates the amount of signal by 9.2 events .",
    "to test for a systematic bias in the two - dimensional fitting procedure , fifty simulated datasets were created and filled with @xmath59 signal monte carlo , @xmath111 background , and continuum background according to the proportions of tables  [ 1d_results ] and  [ events ] . following the procedure of fixing both backgrounds and allowing all four signal components to float , two - dimensional fits to these simulated datasets gave fifty estimates of total @xmath59 signal .",
    "the _ difference _ between the estimate from each fit and the number of input @xmath59 events forms a distribution centered at 1.1 with an rms of 5.3 , consistent with zero and indicative of an unbiased fitting procedure . in the case of the fit to the real dataset ,",
    "the additional 9.2 events differ from the expected total by an acceptable 1.7 standard deviations . in order that these events might be accounted for , a systematic error of 2.9%",
    "is introduced into the overall signal yield .",
    "the polarization measurement is not affected by this systematic error in the fit normalization .",
    "forty thousand signal monte carlo events were generated for each of the nine signal modes : @xmath37 , longitudinally polarized @xmath39 , transversely polarized @xmath39 , @xmath112 ( for each of @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and @xmath6 ) and @xmath113 ( also for all three @xmath3 states ) . to estimate statistical limitations ,",

    "the resulting fits differ from the original by less than 1.0% .",
    "an uncertainty is introduced by statistical fluctuations in the amount of continuum background .",
    "varying the number of continuum background events by one standard deviation ( @xmath116 ) affects the overall two - dimensional fit yields by a maximum of 3.7% and the polarization by a maximum of 1.8% .",
    "the uncertainty from statistical fluctuations in the total number of @xmath65 background events is anti - correlated with the continuum background .",
    "this is the result of highly similar background shapes in the one - dimensional fit to the @xmath109 data distribution . refitting the two - dimensional data distribution with these fluctuations changes the yields by a maximum of 1.6% , and the polarization by a maximum of 1.0% , where the small uncertainty results from the anticorrelation .",
    "the two - dimensional continuum and background shapes are parameterized as products of chebyshev polynomials . varying the polynomial coefficients by the parameterization errors and refitting the two - dimensional data distribution changes the results by less than 1.0% for either background .    in the two - dimensional fit to the data distribution",

    "the @xmath34 label denotes the sum of three @xmath7 charm states : the @xmath118 , @xmath119 , and the @xmath120 .",
    "each of these three states has a unique mass and width , and produces a different pattern of @xmath10 helicities . in building the @xmath34 signal component",
    ", it is assumed that the @xmath34 production rate from @xmath17 mesons is at a @xmath121 ratio of @xmath122 , in accordance with the known @xmath119 and @xmath120 production rates in @xmath123@xcite and the preliminary evidence for the @xmath118@xcite . to understand the systematic bias introduced by this choice of ratios , the data was refit using widely varying ratios of ( @xmath124 , @xmath125 , @xmath126 , @xmath127 , @xmath128 , and @xmath129 ) .",
    "this caused the @xmath36 yield to vary by 0.8% , the @xmath130 yield to vary by as much as 2.9% , the @xmath40 yield to vary by 4.5% , and the polarization to vary by 0.6% .",
    "the @xmath131 ratio in the @xmath40 component has been fixed _ a priori _ at @xmath132 in the two - dimensional fit .",
    "the assumption of this ratio follows from the analogous modes @xmath133 , where @xmath134 has been previously measured at @xmath132 , a ratio confirmed by this analysis .",
    "the pseudoscalar / vector @xmath135 ratio in this spectator decay implies that the same ratio should hold for the @xmath40 case as well .",
    "all the decays @xmath136 are spectator decays described by a single feynman diagram and differentiated only by the final angular momentum states of the @xmath137 ( @xmath9 or @xmath8 ) and @xmath138 ( @xmath45 or @xmath34 ) quark pairs . to be particularly conservative ,",
    "the @xmath139 ratio is allowed to vary between @xmath140 and @xmath141 .",
    "pseudoscalar / vector spin considerations strongly suggest that the ratio be confined between these two limits . varying the @xmath131 ratio between @xmath140 and @xmath141 changes the fit results significantly , as the @xmath37 varies by a maximum of 2.4% , the @xmath39 by 9.8% , the @xmath142 by 14.8% , and the polarization by 3.2% .",
    "these errors are the second largest systematic uncertainty , after the @xmath15 branching fraction uncertainty .",
    "there exists the possibility that significant non - resonant @xmath143 production could contribute to the data sample .",
    "the three - body @xmath143 decay peaks nearly as strongly as resonant signal in @xmath109 .",
    "while no measurements of the @xmath107 non - resonant production have been made , an analogy can be drawn to non - resonant production of @xmath144 .",
    "aleph has measured the inclusive branching fraction @xmath145 at @xmath146 , and the product of exclusive branching fractions @xmath147@xcite .",
    "aleph has also placed an upper limit on the @xmath120 branching fraction at @xmath148@xcite .",
    "although there is no measurement of the mode @xmath149 , recent observations at cleo of the related mode @xmath150 report @xmath151@xcite . assuming that @xmath152 and @xmath153 , and assuming that these relative @xmath154 ratios hold in the semileptonic case , nearly all of the inclusive @xmath145 will be accounted for by resonant @xmath155",
    "this would leave only a small nonresonant component .",
    "thus a conservative upper limit is that non - resonant @xmath107 could be as large as 40% of the resonant @xmath56 branching fraction .",
    "three @xmath156 @xmath157 ( non - resonant ) samples were created : one that contained 60% pure @xmath158 with 30% non - resonant @xmath159 and 10% @xmath160 , one that contained 60% pure @xmath56 with 10% non - resonant @xmath159 and 30% non - resonant @xmath160 , and one that contained 60% pure @xmath56 with 20% non - resonant @xmath159 and 20% non - resonant @xmath160 . refitting the data distribution with these @xmath56 @xmath157 non - resonant @xmath161 samples",
    "changes the results by 2.2% for the @xmath162 case , by 4.5% for the @xmath163 , by 5.9% for the @xmath56 , and by 1.2% for the polarization .",
    "these are the systematic errors listed in table  [ systematics ]",
    ". should it be the case that by 60% of resonant @xmath56 branching fraction be non - resonant , the systematic errors increase would increase to 3.0% for the @xmath162 , to 6.3% for the @xmath163 , to 8.1% for the @xmath56 , and to 1.8% for the polarization .",
    "it should be noted that other non - resonant modes , such as @xmath164 , produce the @xmath9 in a momentum range that is almost entirely below the lower limit of 1250 mev/@xmath92 , excluding these modes from this analysis .",
    "the 1998 pdg values for the @xmath71 and @xmath93 branching fractions are @xmath165 and @xmath166@xcite .",
    "these introduce systematic errors of 1.6% and 2.0% , respectively , into the extraction of the @xmath94 branching fractions .",
    "it is assumed in measuring the longitudinal and transverse @xmath39 polarizations that these final states are independent of one another .",
    "in actuality there exists , in the differential decay rate , an interference term between the longitudinal and transverse states that is proportional to the azimuthal angle between the planes of the @xmath167 and @xmath168 decays .",
    "this interference vanishes in the integral over the azimuth , and introduces no systematic error into the analysis .",
    "the factorization assumption , when expressed in the framework of heavy quark effective theory ( hqet ) and extrapolating from the form factors measured by the semileptonic @xmath17 decays @xmath169 , allows accurate estimate of the hadronic decay rates for the modes @xmath170 , @xmath171 , @xmath172 , and @xmath173@xcite .",
    "additionally , factorization , hqet , and the semileptonic decays , predict the relative polarization of the vector - vector hadron products for @xmath46 decays , such as @xmath174 and @xmath1@xcite .",
    "we observe a longitudinal polarization in @xmath1 of @xmath175 for @xmath176 , where the first error is statistical and the second systematic .",
    "the observation is consistent with the prediction of @xmath177 from factorization , hqet , and the semileptonic form factor measurements@xcite .",
    "the same combination also predicts in @xmath178 a longitudinal polarization of @xmath179 at @xmath180 , which compares favorably with the most recent measurement of @xmath181@xcite .",
    "finally , predictions are also made that at low @xmath47 the longitudinal polarization will be nearly 100% , and at @xmath182 decreases to 33%@xcite .",
    "longitudinal polarization as a function of @xmath47 is plotted in figure  [ factorize ] for the factorization prediction and compared with the @xmath183 and @xmath39 measurements .",
    "the agreement is excellent , confirming the validity of the factorization assumption and hqet in extrapolating the semileptonic form factor results for regions of high @xmath47 .",
    "the polarization of the semileptonic decays remains unobserved@xcite .",
    "another vector - vector hadronic @xmath17 decay mode which may further test the factorization assumption at high @xmath47 is @xmath184 .",
    "this decay is cabibbo - suppressed , and a polarization measurement will require higher statistics than those provided by present experiments@xcite .",
    "future experiments will also reduce the errors of the @xmath183 and @xmath39 measurements .",
    "removing the @xmath117 signal component from the two - dimensional fit reduces the likelihood by @xmath185 , and the resulting projections along both the @xmath186 and @xmath115 axes are systematically different from the data as discussed in section  [ fit_wo_ddub ] .",
    "furthermore , a level of @xmath117 is observed in the data sideband regions of @xmath109 consistent with that seen in the signal region .",
    "we conclude that the data support first evidence for @xmath56 decays .    from the event yield of table  [ events ]",

    "these @xmath193 branching fractions supersede the previous cleo measurements@xcite .",
    "the extraction of the combined @xmath42 branching fraction is contingent on the assumption of equation ( 7 ) , where the charged-@xmath17 decay rate , @xmath2 , is presumed equal to the neutral-@xmath17 decay rate , @xmath194 .",
