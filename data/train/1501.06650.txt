    "high - mass stars are critical elements of galactic structure , due to their evolution in molecular clouds , the turbulent energy they inject into the interstellar medium and the metals dispersed in their death .",
    "these stars are categorised by having mass @xmath9 and eventually explode as type ii supernovae , transforming the local interstellar medium .",
    "the mechanism of high - mass star formation ( hmsf ) remains an important unsolved problem in astrophysics .",
    "understanding hmsf is difficult for a number of reasons : the rarity of hmsf regions , high dust extinction within molecular clouds , rapid evolution , and large distances from our solar system @xcite all combine to hinder our understanding .",
    "hmsf is known to begin within giant molecular clouds ( gmcs ) and eventually end with star clusters or associations @xcite . to understand the various stages of hmsf , an inventory of regions must be compiled in a range of known tracers .    to date",
    ", there have been many surveys conducted to help understand hmsf .",
    "these have been useful in identifying hmsf regions and their characteristic spectral lines , but tend to emphasise subsections of the hmsf timeline .",
    "examples of these surveys include methanol masers ( e.g. @xcite ) , infrared dark clouds ( irdcs ; e.g. @xcite ) and radio continuum sources ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "methanol masers act as reliable signposts of an early evolutionary stage of hmsf @xcite , but do not occur at every evolutionary stage ; irdcs are only seen when they are close to us , projected against a bright infrared background and are not always associated with hmsf @xcite ; radio continuum sources are powered by main sequence high - mass stars , and are seen only when their free - free emission has penetrated through the dense surroundings .",
    "large area surveys of molecular gas are ideal for identifying hmsf regions across a broad range of evolutionary phases . in particular , the critical density of a gas tracer can act as a probe for galactic structure and star formation .",
    "critical density ( @xmath10 ) is a measure of the density required to produce detectable emission @xcite .",
    "previous surveys for star formation in external galaxies , typically for low - density gas tracers ( @xmath11@xmath12 ) , suffer from poor resolution ( on the order of kpc ) and sensitivity .",
    "untargeted galactic plane surveys avoid these issues , while simultaneously offering the ability to detect new , less obvious regions of star formation within our galaxy .",
    "other untargeted surveys have been productive in identifying extended emission , such as in co@xcite , oh@xcite and hi@xcite .",
    "however , hmsf occurs in regions of dense molecular gas , and so mapping high - density tracers serves well to identify target regions .",
    "co(10 ) has a relatively low effective critical density ( @xmath13 @xmath1410@xmath15@xmath12 ) compared to other tracers , such as nh@xmath2(1,1 ) ( @xmath1410@xmath16@xmath12 ; @xcite ) and hc@xmath2n ( 43 ) ( @xmath1410@xmath17@xmath12 ; @xcite ) , which have been mapped by the h@xmath5ogalactic plane survey ( hops ; @xcite ) .",
    "hops has been successful in identifying previously unknown sites of star formation , as well as probing the structure of the milky way s spiral arms .",
    "another , even higher density gas tracer useful for detecting hmsf and mapping the structure of our galaxy is cs .",
    "the ground state transition @xmath18 for cslies within the 7 mm waveband , and has an effective critical density @xmath13 @xmath19@xmath12 at 10k @xcite .",
    "previous large scale observations towards specific regions , such as rcw 106 @xcite for csand other high - critical - density molecules have been productive in hmsf research @xcite .",
    "untargeted observations of csover bright infrared regions such as rcw 106 and regions without infrared emission reveal the full population of star - forming candidates to a small sensitivity limit .",
    "the 7 mm waveband also contains the 44ghz 7(0,7)6(1,6 ) a@xmath3 class i methanol maser line , which is the brightest of the class i species .",
    "previous observations of the class i maser have almost always been targeted ( e.g. @xcite ) , which limits and biases our understanding of this astrophysical phenomenon .",
    "the 7 mm waveband includes other spectral lines detailed in table [ tab : spectral_lines ] . to help develop our understanding of hmsf using the diagnostics in the 7 mm waveband ,",
    "we have devised the malt-45 untargeted galactic plane survey .",
    "cshas a slightly higher effective critical density compared to nh@xmath2(@xmath13 @xmath19@xmath12 vs. @xmath1410@xmath16@xmath12 ) , but suffers from freeze - out on to dust grains in the coldest and most dense regions @xcite .",
    "nh@xmath2appears to be resilient to freeze - out in these regions @xcite , therefore by comparing the dense gas tracers from malt-45 and hops , we are able to identify these cold , dense regions in our galaxy by analysing the cs / nh@xmath2ratio and nh@xmath2temperature .",
    "malt-45 simultaneously surveys c@xmath20s ( 10 ) , which is a less abundant isotopologue of cs(assumed cs / c@xmath20s ratio of 24.4 ; @xcite ) .",
    "a comparison between csand c@xmath20s allows us to measure optical depth at these locations .",
    "c@xmath20s data are not formally presented in this paper , but a preliminary data reduction has been performed for an optical depth investigation in section [ sec : cs_nh3 ] .",
    "there are two varieties of ch@xmath2ohmaser : class i and ii .",
    "the class ii variety is well known and studied ; it is radiatively excited by young stellar objects with sufficient mass to be considered hmsf .",
    "thus , it is vitally important as it occurs only in regions of hmsf , but only at a specific evolutionary state @xcite .",
    "in contrast , class i masers are poorly understood .",
    "research has shown that the class i maser is collisionally excited , and associated with shocked gas @xcite , but not necessarily only from outflows , as seen in @xcite .",
    "it is known to occur in both low - mass @xcite and high - mass regions of star formation @xcite .",
    "most known class i masers have been discovered in targeted searches towards other sources , such as 6.7ghz class ii masers @xcite , hmsf regions with and without uchiiregions @xcite and extended green objects ( egos ; @xcite ) . because class i masers have been found towards a range of sources and evolutionary states , their conditions for excitation remain uncertain . by conducting a sensitive and untargeted survey",
    ", malt-45 reveals the full population of class i masers to a small sensitivity limit ( @xmath21 sensitivity of 4.5jy ) .",
    "this eliminates biases towards known tracers inherent in targeted observations , and helps understand their conditions of excitation .",
    "siomasers are commonly associated with oxygen rich asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) or red supergiant ( rsg ) stars , occurring in the extended atmosphere within a few stellar radii @xcite .",
    "these masers are useful in determining radial velocities to such stars to within a few @xcite .",
    "@xcite conducted a survey for siomasers at 86ghz towards evolved stars , and demonstrated their use in probing galactic kinematics through the maser velocities .",
    "additionally , siomasers have been detected towards star - forming regions , but despite an extensive search towards a wide range of hmsf regions , only three are known ( orion source i , w51 and sgr b2 ; @xcite ) .",
    "siomaser emission in orion provides the best evidence of a high - mass accretion disc @xcite .",
    "malt-45 has the potential to reveal many new sources of sio(10 ) maser emission , both towards evolved stars and star - forming regions .",
    "along with the maser emission , malt-45 also includes sio(10 ) @xmath22 , which is thermal line emission .",
    "thermal siois commonly found in star - forming regions , produced when silicate - bearing grains are destroyed .",
    "thus , it is a good tracer of shocked gas and outflows @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we focus on detailing the survey from @xmath23 , @xmath24 and present results of the global properties of cs(10 ) , class i ch@xmath2ohmasers and sio(10 ) thermal and maser emission .",
    "this paper is one of a series ; another paper will be dedicated to maser follow - up observations , and another for clump analysis with csdata . in this paper , we focus on comparing : csemission to nh@xmath2and class i ch@xmath2ohmasers ; class i ch@xmath2ohmasers to class ii ch@xmath2oh , h@xmath5oand ohmasers , thermal sioand infrared emission , and 95ghz class i ch@xmath2ohmasers ; and siomasers to infrared emission . we emphasise that the science cases presented in this paper are used primarily to highlight a few intriguing results and discuss some qualitatively plausible explanations .",
    "full analyses for these cases will appear in future publications .",
    "malt-45 is an untargeted galactic plane survey for spectral lines which are commonly bright in star - forming regions at 45ghz ( 7 mm waveband ) .",
    "we have so far observed 5 square - degrees within the region bounded by @xmath23 , @xmath24 .",
    "malt-45 observations were conducted on the australia telescope compact array ( atca ) , which provides 2@xmath25 2048mhz broadband continuum windows for observing .",
    "section [ sec : spectral_lines ] discusses the primary lines surveyed , and their rest frequencies dictate the positions of the broadband windows for malt-45 . within the frequency ranges of the broadband windows ,",

    "the positions of class i ch@xmath2ohmasers have been compared with the published positions of class ii ch@xmath2oh , h@xmath5oand ohmasers to establish associations . when considering the maximum distance between masers that still constitute an association , we use 60 arcsec from the class i position as suitable for defining associations .",
    "@xcite analysed a large distribution of clumps associated with hmsf in their source sample , and find that all clumps have effective radii within 55 arcsec .",
    "additionally , we note that increasing the maximum offset beyond 60 arcsec does not increase the number of unique associations .",
    "these findings suggest for our purposes that 60 arcsec is sufficient to group masers within a single star - forming region . we have chosen not to define an association based on source distance or size , as it is difficult to implement across a wide range of objects",
    ", kinematic distances may be erroneous , and maser geometry may be wide - spread .",
    "an angle of 60 arcsec on the sky corresponds to approximately 1.5pc at a distance of 5kpc .",
    "there are two targets where the spread of class i ch@xmath2ohmaser emission is large and these have been considered as two separate maser regions .",

    "extended sio@xmath22 emission is detected in some regions , as shown in figure [ fig : cs_sio ] , which shows that sio@xmath22 emission tends to be associated with bright peaks of csemission .",
    "note that emission from the sio@xmath22 is typically weaker than for cs , hence the signal - to - noise is lower for this transition ; figure [ fig : cs_sio ] shows all emission above @xmath30 .",

    "velocities are specified to 0.1 , and flux densities to two significant figures .",
    "many masers have low signal - to - noise values , but are considered real detections based on their association in glimpse , and simultaneous detection of emission in another siomaser transition .",

    "all siomasers are detected towards point - like , isolated sources that appear to be evolved stars , based on their infrared colours and lack of obvious associations with star formation , such as irdcs or extended infrared emission .",
    "figure [ fig : sio_glimpse_example ] shows the relative locations of three siomasers compared to infrared stars ; these masers were chosen as they show various colours of infrared stars towards all siomasers .",
    "it can be seen that the maser locations are not identical to the stars , but are within one beam .",
    "therefore , we can not conclusively argue that each siomaser site is coincident with an evolved star , although the evidence we have suggests this is the case",

    "we have found no previously published data for any of these siomasers and consider them all to be new detections .",
    "some siomaser regions have greater @xmath7 emission than @xmath8 , and two have no detected emission @xmath8 ; this is discussed further in section [ sec : sio_discussion ] .",
    "there are also 12 siomaser regions with an associated ohor h@xmath5omaser ; see section [ sec : sio_discussion ] .",
    "parameters used in determining kinematic distances are the same as those found in section [ sec : results_ch3oh ] , except for a more generous velocity uncertainty @xmath33 , and @xmath34 .",
    "four masers are labelled at the far kinematic distance , because the position and errors for a near distance are unrealistic ; see table [ tab : sio ] .      by analysing the rms noise values per pixel",
    "distributed across the malt-45 region , we find that the noise levels may vary by up to a factor of three due to some data being flagged or insufficient time on the telescope to complete the observations . however , we determine that approximately 95 per cent are consistent with the values listed in table [ tab : spectral_lines ] , and only 5 per cent show rms levels worse than these values .",
    "thus , we assess that to first order the survey has uniform sensitivity and only a small fraction of the area has sensitivity poorer than nominal .",
    "tables [ tab : ch3oh ] and [ tab : sio ] include the rms value for each detected maser peak , which help to identify the completeness of the malt-45 survey .",
    "we detect many masers at less than @xmath21 significance . however , we consider the survey complete at the @xmath21 level for 95 per cent of the survey area .",
    "this completeness limit is equivalent to 4.5jy for class i ch@xmath2ohmasers , and approximately 4.3jy for each siomaser line .",
    "figure [ fig : cs_hops ] shows that nh@xmath2(1,1 ) from hops is closely correlated with bright cs(10 ) emission , but with prominent exceptions ; examples include g330.30@xmath270.40 , g332.17@xmath270.10 and g334.17@xmath350.06 .",
    "we calculate that malt-45 is more sensitive to cs(10 ) emission than hops is to nh@xmath2(1,1 ) by a factor approximately 9 , therefore cswithout nh@xmath2 in figure [ fig : cs_hops ] may be due to the superior sensitivity of malt-45 over hops .",
    "however , it is also likely attributable to the phenomena described by @xcite , who reason that csis an `` early - type '' star - forming molecule , tracing quiescent gas , while nh@xmath2is `` late - type '' , associated with dense cores .",
    "for this reason , despite having a higher effective critical density , cswithout nh@xmath2may be tracing molecular clouds before cold , dense cores have formed .",
    "additionally , @xcite and @xcite indicate that cstends to deplete in core collapse .",
    "this means a relatively high abundance of nh@xmath2to csshould reflect a cold , dense core , which is a @xcite `` late - type '' scenario .",
    "as results indicate later in this section , nh@xmath2is not persistent in even further developed stages of hmsf , as it is not detected or very faint .",
    "we distinguish `` late - type '' sources from these evolved sources through bolometric luminosities and the presences of infrared features , such as stars or hiiregions .",
    "we produced a map of the ratio between the integrated intensities of csand nh@xmath2 in order to highlight the differences between their distributions . before performing the quotient of integrated intensity",
    ", the csdata were smoothed to the hops nh@xmath2resolution ( @xmath142arcmin ) .",
    "we used a cutoff at 0.5k(@xmath36 ) of the less sensitive nh@xmath2data ; csdata is @xmath37 everywhere nh@xmath2is @xmath37 .",
    "integration of emission was taken between -100 and -40 , to eliminate subtle baseline effects which decrease the robustness of analysis ; this velocity range is where most of the emission in this part of the galaxy lies ( see figure [ fig : cs_thrumms ] for the longitude - velocity plot ) .",
    "quotients use units of main - beam temperature for both csand nh@xmath2 . see figure [ fig : ratio ] for the full ratio map .    moving inward from the clump edges ,",
    "the cs / nh@xmath2ratio quickly changes .",
    "we observe the amount of both csand nh@xmath2to increase , with the nh@xmath2intensity increasing more `` quickly '' .",
    "edge values are mostly about 2 , while clump centres are usually between 1 and 0.5 , but can be as low as 0.4 .",
    "we now discuss the ratio map qualitatively , reserving radiative transfer modelling for future work . in almost every clump ,",
    "the centre is dominated by nh@xmath2over cs .",
    "this could be due to any or a combination of enhanced nh@xmath2 , depleted cs , or both species being enhanced but csbecoming optically thick .",
    "the hyperfine line structure of nh@xmath2means that it remains optically thin at higher column densities than cs . to test for optically thick cs",
    ", we compared cswith malt-45 c@xmath20s .",
    "we conducted the analysis of csagainst c@xmath20s in a similar manner to that of csagainst nh@xmath2 .",
    "both integrated maps were smoothed to the same resolution , the velocity range of integration was -100 to -40 , and emission was limited to detectable c@xmath20s ( 0.15k ) .",
    "a preliminary analysis of the c@xmath20s data was undertaken only to investigate the csoptical depth within these clumps .",
    "figure [ fig : c34s_glimpse ] shows contours of the ratio of c@xmath20s / csagainst glimpse , with contours of cs / nh@xmath2 .",
    "progressively higher levels of c@xmath20s / csindicate csself - absorption , but appear to be slightly offset from the lowest cs / nh@xmath2ratios .",
    "this implies that the relatively fainter csemission in the presence of an abundance of nh@xmath2is due to both depletion and optical thickness . additionally , the higher ratios of c@xmath20s / csappear to be associated with bright infrared emission , and correlate well thermal sioemission .",
    "we speculate that high c@xmath20s / csratios may be due to high csoptical depth as a result of high csrelative abundance in the presence of an outflow or shocked gas .",
    "c@xmath20s is not detected in other regions of these clumps ; aside from having poor signal - to - noise , this is likely due to the isotopologue depleting similar to cs , and emission is only apparent in hotter , shocked regions where these molecules have been released into the gas phase .    a similar analysis to the one we have conducted was performed in @xcite towards two cold , dense cores .",
    "their results indicate significant depletion of csand c@xmath20s towards the core centres , while nh@xmath2peaks in abundance .",
    "we have not undertaken a detailed analysis of the temperature or mass of the malt-45 molecular gas clumps in this paper ; this will be investigated in a future publication focusing on the csemission . in future work",
    ", we will present radiative transfer modelling ( including depletion , time - dependant chemistry and the relative sensitivity limits of the various surveys ) of the dust , csand nh@xmath2emission to quantitatively understand the physical reason for these effects .",
    "the following subsections briefly discuss three unusual clumps , which have the largest cs / nh@xmath2ratios .",
    "this source is one of the brightest in csacross the malt-45 survey region ( peak of 1.5k ) , and is the brightest in thermal sioemission ( peak of 0.17k ) .",
    "the source also contains all the common star formation region masers : class i and ii ch@xmath2oh , h@xmath5oand oh . the csspectrum has a broad profile of @xmath1410fwhm , possibly due to a powerful molecular outflow .",
    "a strong outflow would not be surprising given the strength of the thermal siodetected , relative to all other siosources in malt-45 .",
    "@xcite have targeted this source which has a high iras far - infrared luminosity , as well as detection of cs(21 ) by @xcite .",
    "@xcite present data for sio(21 ) and note that of the four sources they discuss , this source is brightest in sio , and conclude that an outflow is present due to the spectral profiles of csand sio .",
    "@xcite also discuss the requirement of ob stars to produce the ionised gas seen in other observations .",
    "the evolved nature of the source is the likely reason for the faint nh@xmath2 , because it is being destroyed or dispersed by outflows or young stellar objects .",
    "the cs / nh@xmath2ratio of this source is approximately 3 . of the three unusual sources discussed in this section ,",
    "this is the only one without detected thermal sioemission .",
    "a small region ( @xmath1430 arcsec ) of the clump has a constant c@xmath20s / csratio of 0.08 , and is coincident with a h@xmath5oand class ii ch@xmath2ohmaser , as well as what appears to be a star in glimpse .",
    "a new class i ch@xmath2ohmaser is detected by malt-45 , but is slightly offset from this position ( @xmath1430 arcsec ) .",
    "this source has been targeted by @xcite to determine disc properties through coobservations , and is listed with a very high bolometric luminosity ( @xmath38 l@xmath39 ) . the red msx source ( rms ; @xcite )",
    "survey also lists a _",
    "k_-band magnitude of 5.9 .",
    "these values suggest that the source is not embedded . as a star is visible in glimpse and the source",
    "is not embedded , it may be assumed that the star ( and the region ) are post star - forming .",
    "however , we are confident that the associated star is not evolved ( beyond the main - sequence ) , as a near - infrared ( nir ) spectrum of the source contains br@xmath40 , indicating the presence of an hiiregion . the spectrum is taken from the rms survey , although the data remain unpublished ; @xcite present detailed analysis of the nir spectroscopy , but note that it does not cover this specific source .",
    "we conclude that this source is somewhat evolved because of its exposure from natal clouds , but is pre - main - sequence because of the class ii ch@xmath2ohmaser emission .",
    "again , the evolved nature of this region is the likely reason for the relatively faint nh@xmath2 .",
    "this region is the brightest hiiregion within the malt-45 survey , and appears to harbour evolved sources .",
    "c@xmath20s emission is detected within this source , and the c@xmath20s / csratio varies from 0.09 to 0.14 .",
    "thermal sioemission is also detected towards the source . as well as a previously known class i ch@xmath2ohmaser",

    "malt-45 csalso has a double - peak profile in this region ; a strong , broad peak is associated with @xmath45and a weaker one at @xmath46 , both at the same position ( 16@xmath4722@xmath4806@xmath49 , @xmath2750@xmath5006@xmath5117@xmath52 j2000 ) .",
    "@xcite conducted observations of h90@xmath53 towards this source , which also reveal two peaks of emission , and reason that it contains many o - type stars .",
    "the peak velocity of each h90@xmath53 component varies greatly over the region , from @xmath54 to @xmath55and @xmath56 to @xmath57 , where the second peak is weaker and not present across the observed area .",
    "note that the position of peak malt-45 csis outside of the data presented in @xcite ; it is possible that the spatial resolution of our csdata is limiting our ability to interpret the physics of this region .",
    "however , it is interesting that the peak velocities of csare quite different to h90@xmath53 ; this may indicate complex structure of the source , and indeed this is discussed in @xcite .",
    "the weak presence of nh@xmath2(1,1 ) emission is mysterious .",
    "the high cs / nh@xmath2ratio may be attributable to the region being at a higher temperature , preventing csdepletion .",
    "@xcite attempted a nh@xmath2(1,1 ) and ( 2,2 ) analysis of this clump , but were unable to detect significant emission .",
    "they suggested that the relatively faint nh@xmath2emission could be due to extreme self - absorption .",
    "@xcite comment that in general , cs(21 ) and hco@xmath58 ( 10 ) have similar velocity structure , except at this location ; the hco@xmath58 has a strong self - absorption feature .",
    "however , given that the source is clearly evolved , it is consistent with the other sources discussed in having little nh@xmath2emission .",
    "the cause for the high ratios ( cs / nh@xmath2@xmath59 3 ) in our analysis appears to stem from evolved regions of hmsf .",
    "the other clumps are more difficult to classify - are they less evolved ?",

    "however , without being able to associate these lines with other diagnostics of star formation , it is not certain that the masers are stimulated by star formation ; cloud - cloud collisions have been found to stimulate class i ch@xmath2ohemission @xcite . while the possibility of being a non - star - forming maser extends to all candidates without additional tracers ( such as class ii ch@xmath2ohmasers ) , we expect that these are exceptional cases , and that the majority if not all class i ch@xmath2ohmasers in the malt-45 sample are associated with star formation .

    "the distribution is approximated by a gaussian with a mean velocity difference 0@xmath280.2and standard deviation 1.5@xmath280.1 .",
    "the median velocity difference is -0.1 .",
    "the fwhm of the population presented by @xcite is approximately 7.8 , while ours is approximately 3.5 .",
    "because csis a dense gas tracer , it will occur in cloud cores and thus trace systemic motions accurately . given the resulting gaussian of velocity differences",
    ", this means that class i ch@xmath2ohmasers are also good indicators of systemic velocities .",
    "@xcite discuss class i ch@xmath2ohmasers having similar velocities to the quiescent gas , due to a small amount of gas actually being shocked in these regions . as is noted in @xcite ,",
    "@xcite indicate that ch@xmath2ohemission arising without thermal sioemission is due to mild shocks , destroying dust grain mantles but not dust grain cores .",
    "hence the dispersion in class i ch@xmath2ohmaser velocities is thought to be small , and is reflected here .",
    "this also indicates that the large dispersion seen by @xcite is likely due to the large class ii ch@xmath2ohmaser velocity spread .",
    "this is readily explained by class ii ch@xmath2ohmaser emission radiating from close to a high - mass young stellar object , and therefore having a higher dispersion .",
    "the histogram in figure [ fig : cs_ch3oh_vel_hist ] appears to have a slight blueshifted component .",
    "this is also discussed in @xcite as perhaps due to maser emission being easier to detect on the near - side of a cloud to the observer .",
    "while the median velocity offset is negative , it is statistically insignificant .",
    "a larger data set is required to determine if the blueshift phenomena is real or not .      as discussed in section [ sec : spectral_lines ] , sio@xmath22 is a good tracer of shocked gas and outflows .",
    "regions of thermal sioand positions of class i ch@xmath2ohmasers correlate weakly ; 23 of 77 masers ( 30 per cent ) have at least a @xmath60 peak of sioemission . as class",
    "i masers are collisionally excited , it is perhaps not surprising to find some association with thermal sio .",
    "however , the majority of masers are detected without sio@xmath22 emission .",
    "this could be due to : insufficient sensitivity to extended sioemission ; class i ch@xmath2ohmasers having stronger intensity than thermal sio ; or not all class i ch@xmath2ohmasers being associated with sio@xmath22 emission .",
    "@xcite found that thermal ch@xmath2ohemission may be triggered by less energetic shocks , which destroy dust grain mantles but not their cores , which explains a lack of sioemission . in more energetically shocked regions ( such as a jet or molecular outflow ) ,",
    "ch@xmath2ohmay not survive , which may explain sioemission without ch@xmath2oh .",
    "three regions with strong sioemission ( 0.04k ) are not associated with any maser species : g331.02@xmath270.42 , g333.63@xmath270.11 and g334.20@xmath270.20 .",
    "each of these regions has a cspeak of at least 0.4k ( @xmath61 ) , but no obvious infrared emission .",
    "table [ tab : ch3oh ] lists 28 class i ch@xmath2ohmasers with detected sioemission , implying that these three regions without masers are in the minority .",
    "this could be due to the variability of any masers making them undetectable during observations , or that conditions in these regions are unfavourable for masers to exist .",
    "it is clear that sensitivity to ch@xmath2ohand / or siowill play a part in the detectability of each .",
    "however , the fact that we see regions with both ch@xmath2ohand sio , regions with only ch@xmath2ohmasers and regions with only sioemission suggests that there are multiple conditions under which each of these will exist .",
    "if we assume that all class i ch@xmath2ohmasers are associated with star formation , then given that the majority of masers are not associated with thermal sioemission , these masers may be tracing weaker shocks that do not produce detectable sioemission .",
    "30 per cent of ch@xmath2ohmasers also show thermal sioemission .",
    "it is not clear whether the masers and sioare physically connected , although a reasonable interpretation is that the siooriginates in a jet , where as the masers are associated with the surrounding outflow . in a subsequent paper for malt-45",

    "a common example of how glimpse data is used in star formation research is by combining the 3.6 , 4.5 and 8.0@xmath62 m bands in a three - colour image ( blue , green and red , respectively ) to reveal egos ( extended green objects ) .",
    "as discussed in @xcite , egos have a strong correlation with class i ch@xmath2ohmaser regions .",

    "@xcite explains that the green emission band of glimpse contains both h@xmath5 and co ( 10 ) lines , which are excited by shocks .",

    "this is not significantly different , but our slope closely agrees with @xcite when the outlier is omitted .      in this section , we discuss other maser species and transitions and their association with the class i ch@xmath2ohmasers detected in malt-45 .",

    ", class i methanol masers have been identified from targeted searches towards class ii maser sites @xcite .",
    "for the first time , we are able to make an unbiased comparison of the rate at which each class of methanol maser occurs and their degree of overlap .    within the malt-45 survey region ,",
    "54 6.7ghz class ii methanol masers have been detected by the mmb @xcite . to compare against malt-45 class i maser regions ,",
    "7 class ii masers have been grouped together into `` clusters '' , as they are close together ( within 60 arcsec ) .",

    "while the velocities of each maser site grouped together may be different , there is significant overlap in the range of emission ( not greater than 9apart ) . without high - resolution positions , inferring which class ii maser is associated with the class i emission is difficult , and it is more practical to only compare their clustered position , especially as a class i ch@xmath2ohmaser is almost certainly associated with the class ii source .",
    "therefore , we compare 47 class ii methanol masers positions against the 77 class i sources detected in malt-45",
    ". there are 28 class i ch@xmath2ohmasers associated with the clusters , and 16 of these class i masers are new ; see table [ tab : ch3oh ] .",

    "additionally , the next closest class i and class ii ch@xmath2ohmaser pair is approximately 100 arcsec , which aids to rule out mis - association .",
    "thus , 60 per cent of class ii masers have a class i counterpart ( 28/47 ) , while approximately 36 per cent of class i masers have a class ii counterpart ( 28/77 ) .",
    "@xcite reports a 38 per cent association of class ii sources with a 95ghz class i maser counterpart .",
    "given that the 44ghz species is typically stronger than the 95ghz transition , and that the malt-45 sensitivity is better , we perhaps expect our reported class ii - to - class i association to be greater .",
    "as discussed in section [ sec:95_masers ] , @xcite finds the relative peak flux density of 95ghz class i ch@xmath2ohmasers to 44ghz class i ch@xmath2ohmasers to be approximately one - third .",
    "assuming @xcite had a sensitivity cutoff for 95ghz masers at 3jy , we can limit the results of the 44ghz population by a 9jy cutoff .",
    "there are 17 44ghz masers with a peak flux density greater than 9jy associated with a class ii ch@xmath2ohmaser ( 36 per cent ) , which is only slightly lower than the proportion of associations found by @xcite .",
    "therefore , our results are reasonably consistent . considering that the malt-45 sensitivity to class i ch@xmath2ohmasers is better than that of @xcite by approximately a factor of 2 , and",
    "that we search for 44ghz masers instead of 95ghz masers , we are assured that there is a higher association rate than previously reported .    the luminosities of class i and class ii ch@xmath2ohmasers were compared , but no correlation was found ( @xmath67-value of 0.03 ) ; see figure [ fig : classii_maser_scatter_lum ] .",

    "there is a large population of class i ch@xmath2ohmasers without any other maser counterpart . as discussed , these may highlight non - star - forming phenomena , young regions of hmsf , or low mass star - forming regions .",
    "however , given the strong association with csseen in figure [ fig : cs_thrumms ] and with other hmsf masers seen in figure [ fig : maser_venn ] , the majority of class i ch@xmath2ohmasers are likely associated with hmsf .",

    "there are eleven cases where the @xmath7 line is stronger than @xmath8 , and two regions contain only @xmath7 emission .",
    "this result is somewhat unexpected , as generally the lower @xmath72 transitions should be brighter than the higher @xmath72 transitions .",

    "with time , malt-45 could be extended to map more of the galactic plane , revealing more about the nature of star formation within our galaxy . with the current survey , we have determined :    \\(i ) across the survey region , the cs / nh@xmath2ratio is low in the centres of many clumps , but higher at the edges .",
