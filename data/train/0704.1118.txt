    "liquid xenon ( lxe ) is an excellent medium for radiation detection , with high stopping power , good ionization and scintillation yields .",
    "currently liquid xenon detectors are being developed for several fundamental particle physics experiments , from neutrinoless double beta decay @xcite and dark matter weakly interactive massive particles ( wimps ) detection @xcite , to spectroscopy and imaging of gamma - rays in physics , astrophysics and nuclear medicine @xcite .",
    "a more precise energy measurement than currently demonstrated with liquid xenon ionization and scintillation detectors would largely benefit all these experiments .",
    "the best experimental energy resolution is not only orders of magnitude worse than that expected from the fano factor @xcite but even worse than that predicted by the poisson statistics , based on the measured w - value of 15.6 ev @xcite , as average energy to produce an electron - in pair .",
    "the reason for the discrepancy is yet to be fully understood but fluctuations in electron - ion pair recombination rate are known to play a dominant role .",
    "both electron - ion pairs and excitons are produced by the passage of an ionizing particle in liquid xenon . in the presence of an electric field ,",
    "some of the electron - ion pairs are separated before recombination , providing the charge signal as electrons drift freely in the field ( positive ions do not contribute as their drift velocity is several orders of magnitude slower ) .",
    "recombination of the remaining electron - ion pairs lead to excited xenon molecules , @xmath5 .",
    "excitons that are directly produced by the incident particle also become @xmath5 molecules .",
    "de - excitation of these molecules to the ground state , @xmath6 , produce scintillation photons with a wavelength of 178 nm  @xcite .",
    "the ionization and scintillation signals in liquid xenon are thus complementary and anti - correlated as the suppression of recombination by the external field results in more free electrons and less scintillation photons .",
    "this anti - correlation was first observed by kubota _",
    "et al . _",
    "large fluctuations in the number of collected electrons due to their reduction by recombination lead to poor energy resolution of the ionization signal . a way to increase the ionization signal and thus the energy resolution via the photo - ionization effect in lxe doped with triemethylamine ( tea ) yielded good results , but only at low electric fields @xcite .",
    "another way to improve the energy resolution is to reduce recombination fluctuations by combining ionization and scintillation signals .",
    "since recombination also produce scintillation photons , fluctuations of the combined signal should be reduced .",
    "this was originally suggested by ypsilantis _",
    "_ many years ago @xcite , but the simultaneous detection of scintillation and ionization in lxe has been hard to realize because of the difficulty to efficiently detect vuv light under the constraints of efficient charge collection . in the liquid xenon gamma - ray imaging telescope ( lxegrit ) @xcite , which we developed for compton imaging of cosmic @xmath0-rays ,",
    "both ionization and scintillation were detected , but the fast scintillation signal merely provided the event trigger , while the ionization signal provided the energy measurement , with a resolution of 4.2%(@xmath4 ) at 1 mev .",
    "the fair resolution has been a major limitation of the lxe time projection chamber ( tpc ) technology for astrophysics . in recent years",
    ", the development of vuv - sensitive photomultiplier tubes ( pmts ) , capable to operate directly in the cryogenic liquid and to withstand overpressure up to 5 atm , has enabled to significantly improve the xe scintillation light collection efficiency with good uniformity across the liquid volume . a light readout based on these novel pmts , coupled with a lower - noise charge readout , was proposed to measure both signals event - by - event and thus to improve the energy resolution and the compton imaging of the lxegrit telescope @xcite .",
    "the work presented here was carried out with two of the first pmts developed for operation in lxe and is our first attempt in this direction .",
    "further optimization of these vuv pmts has continued , driven largely by our xenon dark matter detector development  @xcite .",
    "these improved pmts , along with other vuv sensor technologies such as large area avalanche photodiodes ( laapds ) and si photomultipliers ( sipms ) , which we are also testing for lxe scintillation detection  @xcite , promise further energy resolution improvement .",
    "the detector used for this study is a gridded ionization chamber with two vuv sensitive pmts ( two - inch diameter hamamatsu r9288 ) viewing the sensitive liquid xenon volume from the anode and cathode side .",
    "the two pmts , and the transparent meshes serving as anode , cathode and shielding grid , are mounted in a structure made of teflon for its vuv reflectivity  @xcite ( fig .",
    "[ schematics ] ) .",
    "the drift gap , between cathode and grid , is 1.9 cm while the distance between grid and anode is 3 mm .",
    "separate high voltage is supplied to the cathode and the grid , keeping a ratio between the field in the drift gap and the field in the collection gap such as to maximize electron transmission through the grid .",
    "the electrons collected on the anode are detected by a charge sensitive amplifier ( clearpulse model 580 ) .",
    "the charge signal is subsequently digitized with 10 bit resolution and a sampling time of 200  ns ( lecroy model 2262 ) .",
    "the scintillation signal from each of the two pmts is recorded with a digital oscilloscope ( lecroy model lt374 ) with 1 ns sampling time .",
