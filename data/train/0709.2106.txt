    "by means of circular spectropolarimetry across metal line profiles , babcock @xcite has shown that is possible to measure the effective magnetic field of stars : @xmath7 , i.e. the line - intensity weighted average over the visible stellar disk of the line - of - sight component of the magnetic field vector . for a spectral line at @xmath8 , mathys @xcite related the first order moment @xmath9 of stokes @xmath4 profile and the effective magnetic field : @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the equivalent width , @xmath3 is the intensity profile , the subscript @xmath12 refers to the continuum , @xmath13 is the effective land factor , @xmath14 wavelengths are expressed in   and @xmath15 is in gauss and @xmath16 .",
    "the sensitivity of the present generation of telescopes and spectrographs let the ideal very high ( r@xmath5100000 ) resolution circular spectropolarimetry and even the ( r=15000 ) moderate one prohibitive to routinely detect the magnetic field of faint non - degenerate stars . at my knowledge , bptau ( v=12.3 ) and dftau ( v=11.0 ) are among the few faint stars whose magnetic field geometry has been inferred from @xmath15 measurements @xcite . on the basis of the relation , strictly valid in the weak field hypothesis and other approximations listed in mathys @xcite:@xmath17 angel & landstreet @xcite introduced a new method to measure the field of white dwarfs performing narrow ( @xmath1830 ) band circular photopolarimetry on the wings of @xmath19 balmer line .",
    "later on , bagnulo et al .",
    "@xcite were successful in measuring stellar magnetic fields by means of the low resolution spectropolarimeter fors1 at the 8 m _ antu _ eso telescope .",
    "these authors selected the blue region , to take advantage of the balmer lines crowding to their series limit , with the grism 600b ( _ linear dispersion _",
    "= 1.50  / pix ) and used the 0.5@xmath20 slit ( r=1600 ) .",
    "bagnulo and coworkers showed that the effective magnetic field of v=13 star can be measured with a 150 g error in two hours ( see also bagnulo et al .",
    "@xcite ) . a fundamental result for the understanding of the role of magnetic field in structure and evolution of stars , as testified by the rapid application of this method from the pre - main sequence objects @xcite to evolved stars @xcite .",
    "a measure of @xmath15 at low resolution consists of a linear regression of @xmath21 versus @xmath22 , whose accuracy is proportional to @xmath21 error ( @xmath23 per pixel ) and to the square root of number of points sampling the spectrum ( @xmath24 ) .",
    "this trade off between s / n per pixel and linear dispersion justifies the evaluation of measuring stellar magnetic fields with the 4.5 m _",

    "a comparison shows that the capability to measure stellar magnetic fields with isis at the wht and fors1 as used by bagnulo and coworkers at the 8 m telescopes of the eso vlt is not as large as instinctively supposed .",
    "the exposure time calculators for a 0.8@xmath20 seeing show that fors1 gives a s / n per pixel about six times larger in the @xmath25 band .",
    "an advantage that is almost balanced by a linear dispersion seven times larger for isis .",
    "thus , stellar magnetic fields measured with fors1 are in principle two times more accurate only .",
    "a higher isis efficiency in measuring stellar magnetic fields should derive from its larger spectral resolution because of a reduced smoothing and blending of stokes @xmath4 line profiles .",
    "leone et al . @xcite",
    "have numerically shown that , at a given s / n , doubling the rotational velocity of a star the error in measuring its effective magnetic field through eq.([eqrv ] ) is doubled too .",
    "fors1 has been upgraded in april 2006 with the grism 1200b ( _ linear dispersion _",

    "the blue region was selected . in section [ obs ]",
    "observation strategy , data reduction and method adopted to extract the polarisation signal are described .",
    "section [ results ] reports the results for well known magnetic stars and a comparison with literature data obtained at middle / high resolution circular spectropolarimetry .",
    "these literature measurements can be considered as approaching values for an increasing spectral resolution .",
    "the last section [ concl ] summarises the capability of isis to measure stellar magnetic fields .",

    "moreover , one of the stars with the weakest well established magnetic field has been observed : hd3360 ( b=3.5 mag . ) , a perfect target to determine any shift in the zero point of used set - up .",
    "on 2005 december 13 and 14 and on 2006 october 1 , 2 , 3 and 4 , circular spectropolarimetric observations in the 3785@xmath24480  interval were carried out with the echelle grating r1200b at r=5000 .",

    "there is a time independent ( instrumental ) sensitivity @xmath29 , due to a pixel - by - pixel efficiency  together with a time dependent sensitivity @xmath30 of spectra obtained at different @xmath27 angles  due to variation of sky transparency and slit illumination .",
    "so that , photon noise dominated stokes @xmath3 and @xmath4 can been obtained from the recorded spectra at @xmath27 = 45 and 135@xmath31 : @xmath32 hence : @xmath33    for a real retarder the fast angle depends on wavelength and retarder and polariser are exactly aligned only at few wavelengths .",
    "eight spectra from the four exposures at @xmath27 = 0 , 45 , 90 and 135@xmath31 give the possibility to obtain stokes @xmath3 and @xmath4 despite the unknown difference @xmath34 from the real angle between the retarder and polariser .",

    "fig.[fig_spectra ] shows the stokes @xmath3 and @xmath21 spectra for the entire interval and fig.[fig_gamma ] shows the h@xmath39 region .",
    "linear regressions of stokes @xmath21 spectra as a function of @xmath22 give , within errors , a null slope for @xmath40 . a result consistent with the expectation that no circular polarised flux is measured through stokes @xmath4(@xmath41 ) spectra .",

    "the most straight explanation , strengthened by the variable equivalent widths with the magnetic period , is a not homogeneous distribution of elements on the stellar surface with a concentration of heavy elements in the magnetic polar regions .",
    "these stars show that _ at priori _ there is no justification in combining magnetic field measurements obtained from different spectral lines . at low spectral resolution",

    "this depends on spectral type , gravity and chemical composition of the observed star .",
    "moreover because of the instrumental smoothing , @xmath0g@xmath43@xmath5 depends on the resolution of the spectropolarimeter too .",

    "a correct evaluation of the average effective land factor for a star depends on the relative strength of its spectral lines and it requires the knowledge of atmosphere parameters with particular attention to abundances . as to the here observed chemically peculiar stars , abundances can not be here derived at low resolution and @xmath0g@xmath43@xmath5 = 1.0 was adopted in this exploratory study .",
    "the first attempt to measure the effective magnetic field of the slow pulsating b - type star hd3360 was due to landstreet @xcite , who measured a field equal to 70@xmath44310 g. neiner et al .",
