    "in this letter we examine the problem of hadron - nucleus interaction at high energies .",
    "it is well known that in the gribov - glauber approach @xcite , where the total cross section of the hadron - nucleus interaction is expressed through the inelastic cross section of hadron - proton scattering , can only be justified at rather low energies , where the corrections due to pomeron interactions may be neglected .",
    "a more general approach has been developed@xcite in which the pomeron interaction has been taken into account in the high energy range for : [ krha ] & & g_is_a(b)g_3ipe^_ip y g g_3ip a^1/3e^_ip y 1 ; + & & g^2_3ipe^_ip y 1 .",
    "@xmath0 is the triple pomeron coupling , @xmath1 is the vertex of pomeron nucleon interaction , and 1 + @xmath2 denotes the pomeron intercept .",
    "for the nuclear profile @xmath3 we use the general expression [ sa ] s_a(b)=^+ _ - d z(z , b)=^+ _ - d z  ; d^2 bs_a(b ) = a ; in the wood - saxon parametrization ( see the last equation ) @xmath4 @xcite .    in this approach , in order to calculate the hadron - nucleus cross sections",
    ", one needs to know the values of @xmath2,@xmath1 and @xmath0 .    in this letter",
    "we will discuss the non - glauber -type corrections to hadron - nucleus interaction .",
    "our re - analysis of the problem is based on two recent achievements .",
    "first , the auger collaboration has published the measurement of the proton - air total cross section at extremely high energies ( w= 57tev ) with sufficiently small errors ( @xmath5 @xcite ) .",
    "second , a model for high energy hadron - hadron scattering has been proposed which successfully described lhc data , and which has included all theoretical ingredients that have been found in qcd and n=4 sym@xcite .",
    "the latter allows us to calculate the non - glauber corrections , and to estimate the influence of these corrections on the value of the proton - air cross section at very high energies .    in the next section we briefly review the main theoretical formulae for hadron - nucleus interactions . in section iii",
    "we calculate the proton - air cross section using the model , all parameters of which have been fitted from the proton - proton data . in this section",
    "we estimate the difference between the glauber - gribov approach , and the alternative approach that includes the pomeron interactions . in the conclusions",
    "we summarize our results .",
    "in the kinematic region of , the hadron - nucleus scattering amplitude can be written in an eikonal form in which the opacity @xmath6 is given by sum of the fan diagrams@xcite ( see -b ) .",
    "[ ha1 ] a_(y , b)= i ( 1-(- ) ) , with [ ha2 ] _ ( y ; b)=.    for diagrams of , @xmath7 is the green s function of the pomeron exchange which is equal to [ gy ] g_enh(y)=e^_ipy .    from and , we obtain that [ ha3 ] ^ha_tot&= & 2 d^2 b(1-(- ) ) ; + ^ha_el&= & d^2 b(1-(- ) ) ^2 ; + ^ha_in&= & d^2 b(1-(- _ ( y ; b ) ) ) .",
    "the processes of diffractive production have been discussed in refs.@xcite .      to describe the experimental data , we replace the glauber - gribov eikonal formula by and .",
    "in addition , we need to adjust this formula to our description of hadron - hadron data given in ref.@xcite . in this model",
    "we introduce two additional ingredients that have not been included in and .",
    "1 ) a two channel good - walker model@xcite which is exclusively responsible for low mass diffraction .",
    "2 ) enhanced pomeron diagrams that lead to a different pomeron green s function . this mechanism provides the main contribution for high mass diffraction .",
    "the model we develop is based on a two channel model which takes into account the good - walker mechanism , in which the observed physical hadronic and diffractive states are written in the form [ mf1 ] _",
    "h=_1+_2 ; _ d=-_1+_2 , where @xmath8 .",
    "note that good - walker diffraction is presented by a single wave function @xmath9 .",
    "the vertex of the interaction of a pomeron with a nucleon ( @xmath1 in and ) has in this model a more complex structure @xmath10 .",
    "@xmath11 denotes the vertex of the pomeron interaction with the state @xmath12 that have been described by either the wave functions @xmath13 or @xmath14 .    in our model",
    "@xcite we sum all enhanced diagrams for proton - proton scattering ( see and calculated @xmath15 in the mpsi approximation @xcite .",
    "we refer our reader to ref.@xcite for the details of the calculations which lead to [ geny ] g_enh ( y)=(1- ( ) ( 0 , ) ) @xmath16 is the incomplete gamma function ( see * 8.350 - 8.359 * in ref.@xcite ) ) , @xmath17 where @xmath18 are the transverse momenta of three pomerons , and @xmath19 is given by [ t ] t(y)=e^_ipy    the final formula that includes both the good - walker mechanism of low mass diffraction production , and the enhanced pomeron diagrams , takes the following form : [ fha ] & & _ in(p+a ; y)= + & & d^2 b ( 1 -(- \\",
    "{ ^pp_tot -(^pp_el+^pp_diff ) } ) ) .",
    "one can see that for @xmath20 reduces to gribov - glauber formula with one difference : instead of @xmath21 in the formula we have @xmath22 where @xmath23 as it was advocated in ref.@xcite .",
    "note , that the low mass of both single and double diffraction enters .",
    "we consider the simplest model for proton - proton interaction in which elastic and diffraction processes are taken into account ( see ): the total cross section is given as a sum of one and two pomeron exchanges(see -a and -b ) .",
    "the pomeron diagrams for this case , are shown in -c .",
    "table 1 presents the parameters of our model@xcite that are needed to calculated the modified gribov - glauber formula of . for the scattering with air we use",
    "@xmath24 where @xmath25 and @xmath26 stand for nitrogen and oxygen , respectively . for each of these nuclei we used the oscillatory parametrization , following ref .",
    "our estimates will be discussed below .",
    ".parameters of the model ( see ref.@xcite that are needed for the modified gribov - glauber formula of [ cols=\"<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "before comparing with the experimental results , we would like to draw the reader s attention to the fact that some of the experimental results shown might be overestimated , due to the possibility of the airshowers being created by helium nuclei , as well as protons .",
    "the importance of this phenomena has been investigated by block@xcite and the auger colloboration@xcite .",
    "we refer the reader to these references for further details .",
    "all experiments , except auger , assume a pure proton composition of the projectile .",
    "auger concludes that they have a contamination of about 25% of helium , which produces an uncertainty of about   30 mb ( which is less than 10% of their final result ) , and is included in their systematic error .",
    "the results of our calculations are shown in .",
    "one can see that our model describes the auger and hires@xcite quite well .",
    "in the two different simplifications of the exact formula of are plotted : gribov - glauber formula in which the interaction with the pomerons are neglected ( @xmath27 ) as well as the cross section of diffraction dissociation is considered to be small ( @xmath28 ) ; and our model with @xmath27 .",
    "the first lesson that we learn is that these three approaches produce results whose difference are larger than the experimental errors of the auger and hires experiments .",
    "the second lesson is that our model gives a good description of the data at very high energies ( @xmath29 and @xmath30 ) .",
    "our total proton - proton cross section at @xmath31 is equal to 130 mb .",
    "it is instructive to note that all cosmic ray data lie between our two predictions : our modelwith @xmath32 , and our model with @xmath27 .",
    "since the systematic errors are large we can not exclude the case with @xmath27 .",
    "however , this case has been eliminated by the lhc experiments where high mass diffraction has been measured ,    it should be stressed that our results show that the pomeron interaction leads to a considerable contribution and can not be neglected .",
    "we would like to stress that our model @xcite gives the smallest contribution for pomeron interactions , in comparison with other attempts to describe the lhc data@xcite .",
    "shows our predictions for the total and inelastic cross sections for proton - lead interaction at high energy .",
    "one can see that for heavy nuclei the difference between our approach and gribov - glauber formula is not large reaching about 11% for total and 5% for inelastic cross sections.it is instructive to note that the inelastic cross section for heavy nuclei is not sensitive to the pomeron interactions and the major difference from gribov - glauber formula stems from good - walker mechanism for low mass diffraction in proton - proton collisions .",
    "in this paper we show that pomeron interactions generate valuable corrections to gribov - glauber formula which is used for the extraction of proton - proton cross sections from proton - air collisions at high energies . bearing this in mind ,",
    "we can attempt to use the cosmic ray data at ultra high energies ( @xmath33 ) to check our knowledge of very high energy phenomenology .",
    "although the cosmic ray experiments have large errors , we conclude that the pomeron interaction and low mass diffraction production , have to be taken into account with all needed modifications of gribov - glauber formula for proton - air scattering .",
    "our model which describes all accelerator data at high energies also gives a good description of the cosmic ray data .",
    "therefore , we conclude that our model @xcite can be used for ultra high energies .",
