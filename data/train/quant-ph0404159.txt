    "game theory@xcite is a subject used to predict the strategy of all players in a game .",
    "the simplest game is static and non - cooperative game , which describe by payoff function @xmath0 , a linear mapping from strategy space @xmath1 to n - dimension real space @xmath2 . for a game in mixture strategy space , in which every player uses mixture strategy @xmath3 , a probability distribution on strategy set @xmath4",
    ", nash theorem proves that there is always some mixture - strategy equilibrium points , on which no player has the willing to make an independent change .",
    "therefor , such equilibrium points can be regarded as a converged points ( or at least fixed points ) of the system , then as the end state of all players .    on the other hand ,",
    "quantum game theory@xcite has been proposed as a quantum version of game theory@xcite .",
    "a typical two - player quantum game is defined as @xmath5 , in which @xmath6 is the hilbert space of state of one quantum object , like a photon or electron .",
    "such a quantum object plays an important role in quantum game theory . the quantum strategy set @xmath7 or @xmath8",
    "usually is defined as a set of unitary operator on state space @xmath6 , or sometimes subspace of @xmath6 .",
    "it s believed that because quantum strategy space is usually larger than the corresponding classical strategy space , one can make use of such advantage of quantum strategy to make money over classical player . generally speaking , a quantum game is not only a quantum version of a classical game .",
    "it describes the situation that every player plays game in a strategy space of quantum operators , which transform the state of a quantum object .",
    "probably , someday , some original quantum games can be found alone this direction .",
    "however , both of classical game theory and quantum game theory are expressed in single player strategy space , so the payoff function is a @xmath9 tensor @xmath10 , mapping a combination of @xmath11 single - player strategies onto a real number . on the contrary , in quantum statistical mechanics , a matrix form of hamiltonian @xmath12",
    "is used in a any - particle case , and the form of density matrix of equilibrium state is always @xmath13 .",
    "so a system - level description will unify our formulas for @xmath11-player game , and then maybe improve our understanding and calculation .",
    "starting from such an idea , in this paper , we construct a systematical way to reexpress everything into system - level description , including system state and its space , payoff matrix on system space , and reduced single - player payoff matrix .",
    "then canonical quantum ensemble distribution is used to describe system equilibrium state .",
    "so ideas and technics from statistical physics can be easily applied onto game theory .",
    "such application implies a probability that a kinetics equation can be used to describe an evolution that a system ends at the equilibrium state starting from an arbitrary distribution . because the traditional game theory only cares about the macro - equilibrium state , the kinetics equation approach is just pseudo - dynamical equation leading to the equilibrium state",
    ". the dynamical process itself might be meaningless .",
    "furthermore , besides providing a new pseudo - dynamical approach , the distribution function description has its own meaning . in game theory , maybe general for all economical subjects ,",
    "usually it s supposed that even the difference between two choices is very small , the high - value one is chosen .",
    "this is unnatural when the difference is smaller than the resolution of human decision .",
    "therefor , we use a distribution function to replace the maximum - point solution .",
    "this means player @xmath14 will choose strategy @xmath15 with probability @xmath16 , even there are another strategy can make more money . here",
    ", @xmath17 is the meaning of average resolution level , or in statistical physics , the average noise level .",
    "unfortunately , although the ensemble description is the second topic of this paper , only some special case study has been investigated . a general form for any game is still waiting for more exploration .",
    "section @xmath18[framework ] constructs the new representation for classical and quantum game .",
    "section @xmath18[statphys ] use ensemble distribution and pseudo - dynamical approach to study the equilibrium state in this new representation .",
    "discussion of relation between our new representation and quantum , and classical game is included in section @xmath18[framework ] .",
    "a lot of questions are pointed out in the discussion section ( @xmath18[discussion ] ) .",
    "section @xmath18[conclusion ] is a short summary of the conclusions we have reached .",
    "strategy set can be continuous and discrete , and this will effect the mathematical form of all variables , such as the state of player @xmath14 is @xmath19 or @xmath20 , and @xmath0 will be integrations or matrixes . in order to compare with the mathematical form of quantum mechanics and point out the similarity , and to unify classical game theory and quantum game theory , here we use the discrete strategy , although the corresponding transformation of all ideas and formulas is quite straightforward .",
    "most of our formulas and results can be generalized into @xmath11-player and @xmath21-strategy game , so for simplicity of expressions , at most time , a @xmath22-player and @xmath23-strategy game is used as our object .      for a @xmath11-player game , we suppose the strategy space of player @xmath14 is @xmath24 . the state of player @xmath14 is @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "the payoff function of player @xmath14 is a @xmath27-tensor  a @xmath11-linear operator , @xmath28 specially , for a 2-player game , @xmath29 can be written as a matrix ( @xmath30-tensor ) so that @xmath31 in which @xmath29 is @xmath32 matrix , not necessary a square one .",
    "so a classical game is @xmath33 a general vector in @xmath4 can be defined as @xmath34 in which @xmath35 is the base vector set of strategy space @xmath4 . or in traditional language of game theory , it s a set of all the pure strategies of player @xmath14 .    inspired by the application of hilbert space in quantum mechanics ,",
    "now we introduce two ideas into game theory .",
    "first , to redefine the strategy space of single player as a hilbert space .",
    "second , to use a system state to replace the single player state .",
    "then , at the same time , a new form of payoff function is required to be equivalently defined on the system state .",
    "a single - player state vector @xmath36 is written in a new form as @xmath37 it s density matrix form of a mixture state , because a classical strategy of player @xmath14 is to use strategy @xmath15 with probability @xmath38 .",
    "the difference between equ([oldsinglestatevector ] ) and equ([newsinglestatevector ] ) can be regarded as just to replace @xmath39 with @xmath40 .",
    "the reason of such replacement will be clear when we do it on quantum game .",
    "actually , using density matrix to describe mixture state is a approach in quantum mechanics .",
    "a system state of all players is defined as @xmath41 a typical form of system state of a @xmath22-player ( player @xmath42 and player @xmath22 ) and @xmath22-strategy ( strategy @xmath43 and strategy @xmath44 ) classical game looks like @xmath45 in fact , the base vector set of hilbert space of system state of @xmath11 players can be defined as direct product of single player base vector as @xmath46 then from equ([newsinglestatevector ] ) and equ([newsystemstatevector ] ) , it can be proved that a system state have the form as @xmath47 in which @xmath48 one can compare this general form with the specific one of @xmath49 game , equ([specificcase ] ) .",
    "sometimes , we neglect the subindex and denote @xmath50 as @xmath51 .",
    "in such situation , we should notice that a capital @xmath52 denote a general system base vector .",
    "such replacement provides a probability to use pure strategy other than the traditional classical pure and mixture strategy .",
    "we will discuss this in section @xmath18[quantizedclassical ] .",
    "now we try to transform payoff function @xmath29 into system - level form while the invariant condition is equ([singlepayoff ] ) . in a density matrix form ,",
    "the formula used to calculate the payoff is @xmath53 the solution of equ([singlepayoff ] ) and equ([systempayoff ] ) gives the relation between @xmath54 and @xmath29 . since those two equations should give the same value for any state , we can choose the system state as a pure strategy , or in our language , the base vector of system state .",
    "let s denote @xmath55 , which means every player choose a pure strategy @xmath56 , then @xmath57",
    ". then equ([systempayoff ] ) give us @xmath58 so @xmath59 the diagonal elements of @xmath54 can be calculated explicitly . and",
    "for our general system density matrix as equ([systemdensity ] ) , only the diagonal terms effect the payoff value @xmath60 , all others can defined as zero . for example , @xmath54 of a 2-player game is @xmath61 this means @xmath54 is diagonal matrix .      before we continue our further discussion ,",
    "let s use one example to present our abstract mathematics and to compare the traditional and new from of state vector and payoff function .",
    "the traditional payoff function of prisoner s dilemma is @xmath62 then @xmath63 , g^{2}=\\left[\\begin{array}{cc } -2 & 0 \\\\-5 & -4 \\end{array}\\right].\\ ] ]",
    "the traditional state vectors are @xmath64 by substituting the above two equations into equ([singlepayoff2 ] ) , we get @xmath65\\left[\\begin{array}{cc } -2 & -5 \\\\0 & -4 \\end{array}\\right]\\left[\\begin{array}{c}p^{2}_{c}\\\\p^{2}_{d } \\end{array}\\right ] \\\\ \\\\ & = & -2p^{1}_{c}p^{2}_{c}-5p^{1}_{c}p^{2}_{d}+0\\cdot p^{1}_{d}p^{2}_{c}-4p^{1}_{d}p^{2}_{d } \\end{array } \\label{oldearn}\\ ] ] by the new notations , state of player @xmath42 is @xmath66 and system state is @xmath67 or in matrix form , @xmath68.\\ ] ] then from equ([relation2 ] ) , we know the new payoff function , @xmath69 , h^{2}=\\left[\\begin{array}{cccc } -2 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\0 & 0 & -5 & 0 \\\\0 & 0 & 0 & -4 \\end{array}\\right].\\ ] ] we can check it by substituting into equ([systempayoff ] ) as , @xmath70 which is the same value with equ([oldearn ] ) .",
    "so the new representation includes all the information in the traditional notation , however , more complex it seems .",
    "but such complexity brings some other benefit including equilibrium state calculation and generalization into quantum game theory .",
    "till now , since the classical strategy is a mixture strategy of the base vector ( strategy ) , we always use density matrix to represent a single player state or a system state , such as in equ([newsinglestatevector ] ) and equ([newsystemstatevector ] ) .",
    "now we ask the question that what s the pure state of strategy ( but other than the classical pure strategy ) means in game theory ?",
    "a pure strategy vector of player @xmath14 in our representation is @xmath71 therefor , the density matrix of such a pure state is @xmath72 the density matrix of a pure state has off - diagonal elements while the classical mixture density matrix has only the diagonal elements .",
    "it seems that pure strategies expand the strategy space .",
    "whether it has significant result in game theory or not ? comparing equ([puredensity ] ) with equ([newsinglestatevector ] ) , if we suppose @xmath73 that every diagonal element of pure density equals to corresponding one of mixture density matrix , then those two states will have similar meaning .",
    "let s use the prisoner s dilemma as an example again to check if they will give different payoffs . although we still can follow the calculation of mixture state by density matrix method as in equ([systempayoff ] ) , there is an equivalent but much simpler formula for pure state calculation , @xmath74 where @xmath51 is a pure state vector defined direct product of single player state as @xmath75 specially , for prisoner s dilemma , the system state vector is @xmath76 combined with new payoff matrix @xmath77 , @xmath78 \\left[\\begin{array}{cccc } -2 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\0 & -5 & 0 & 0 \\\\0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\0 & 0 & 0 & -4 \\end{array}\\right]\\left [ \\begin{array}{c}x^{1}_{c}x^{2}_{c } \\\\",
    "x^{1}_{c}x^{2}_{d } \\\\",
    "x^{1}_{d}x^{2}_{c } \\\\",
    "x^{1}_{d}x^{2}_{d } \\end{array}\\right ] \\\\ & = & -2p^{1}_{c}p^{2}_{c}-5p^{1}_{c}p^{2}_{d}+0\\cdot p^{1}_{d}p^{2}_{c}-4p^{1}_{d}p^{2}_{d } \\end{array}\\ ] ] the same value as equ([oldearn ] ) and equ([newearn ] ) .",
    "pure state @xmath79 equals to the diagonal term plus some off - diagonal elements .",
    "the same payoff value implies that in our situation , only the diagonal term makes sense .",
    "in fact , generally , it s because of the diagonal property of @xmath54 . from equ([systempayoff ] ) and equ([relation ] ) , we know @xmath80 it means that even @xmath79 has off - diagonal elements , only the diagonal parts effect the payoff . in one word , the mathematical form of vectors in hilbert space , or the equivalent density matrix form , brings nothing new into game theory but an equivalent mathematical representation .",
    "system state can be a pure state or a mixture state , but since the payoff matrix is diagonal , they make no difference .",
    "the quantization of classical game is a new game only when _ both density matrix and payoff matrix have off - diagonal elements_. although density matrix @xmath81 can have the off - diagonal terms , the relation of equ([relation ] ) between the new payoff matrix and the traditional one guarantees that @xmath54 can only have the diagonal term .",
    "so this quantization condition has no classical meaning in game theory .",
    "now the question is if we quantize it anyway , what s the meaning ?",
    "is it possible to find any real world objects for such a theory ?",
    "if we find such an object , does the relative phase in state vector play any roles in such situation ? and further more , the vector space gives us the freedom to choose our base vectors , does such transformation play any roles ?",
    "the expanded strategy space provides another class of possible state . in the mixture classical density matrix",
    ", a system density matrix ia always has the form as equ([systemdensity ] ) , which is a direct product of all single players .",
    "if pure state is permitted , a general system density matrix may not be a direct product , but an entangled state of all single players .",
    "does such an entangled density matrix have significant effect on game theory ?    at the last of this section , lets come back to question of the meaning of the off - diagonal term of payoff matrix @xmath54 by referring to an example",
    ". what s the meaning of @xmath82 in the payoff matrix below ?",
    "@xmath83 , h^{2}=\\left[\\begin{array}{cccc } -2 & 0 & 0 & \\epsilon_{2 } \\\\0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\0 & 0 & -5 & 0 \\\\\\epsilon_{1 } & 0 & 0 & -4 \\end{array}\\right].\\ ] ]      the representation of classical game above strongly depends on the base vectors of strategy set . but in classical game , such base vectors are predetermined and artificial .",
    "they are just the original discrete basic classical strategies .",
    "no inner product has been predefined between them before our construction of the new representation .",
    "now we turn to quantum game theory , and fortunately it will provide us a very natural explanation of our base vectors .",
    "the proposed and developing quantum game theory is different with our quantized classical game theory . while our approach is a representation , the quantum game theory is a quantum version of game theory .",
    "it use the idea of game theory , but all operations ( strategies ) and the object of such operations are from quantum world@xcite .",
    "a typical 2-player quantum game is defined by @xmath84 in which @xmath6 is the hilbert space of the state of a quantum object , @xmath85 is the initial state of such an object , @xmath86 is player @xmath87 or @xmath88 s set of quantum operators acting on @xmath6 . and @xmath89 are their payoff functions .    using well - known quantum penny flip game@xcite as an example ,",
    "spin of an electron is used as penny , so the base vectors of @xmath12 are @xmath90 .",
    "the initial state is chosen as @xmath91 .",
    "the classical operators are to flip the penny or not , so they are @xmath92 , f = \\left[\\begin{array}{cc}0 & 1\\\\1 & 0\\end{array}\\right].\\ ] ] the quantum operator can be a general unitary operator @xmath93.\\ ] ] the payoff function is usually defined as @xmath94 in which @xmath95 = -p_{b}\\ ] ] means , player @xmath87 gets @xmath42 when the quantum object ends in @xmath96 state and loses @xmath42 when in @xmath97 state .",
    "considering the relation between classical game and quantum game , we redefined quantum game with a slightly difference with the definition equ([qgame ] ) as @xmath98 in which @xmath99 is the set of quantum operators while @xmath100 is the set of classical operators , usually @xmath100 is a subset of @xmath99 , but not necessary .",
    "now let s use our new mathematical representation to reexpress the quantum game theory .",
    "because quantum game theory is constructed on the basis of quantum state of a quantum object , @xmath6 , it provides a set of natural base vectors of strategy space . for quantum penny flip game ,",
    "all strategy are operators with the form of @xmath101 so the base vectors are @xmath102 . furthermore , if we define the inner product of operator as @xmath103 @xmath104 is a complete orthogonal base vector set for all quantum operators",
    ". then the operators can be regarded as vectors in hilbert space , a hilbert space of operator , which we denote as @xmath105 .",
    "the classical strategies are @xmath106 in order to form another complete orthogonal base set , we need to define other two base vectors as @xmath107 then operator space can also be expressed by @xmath108 , while the classical strategy is @xmath109 .",
    "@xmath110 is the operator to turn the @xmath96 into @xmath96 , no definition when the initial state is @xmath97 .",
    "a meaningful operator should give the end result for starting state both as @xmath96 and @xmath97 , so operators @xmath111 are better than @xmath112 in this .",
    "another advantage is that all the base vector are unitary and hermitian operator .",
    "it s easy to prove that under our definition of inner product , the matrix form of @xmath113 is just @xmath114 . for such base strategies , @xmath115 ,",
    "so @xmath116 and @xmath113 have the same the matrix forms .",
    "but @xmath117 . so a unitary operator is not in unit magnitude .",
    "one way to solve such conflict is redefine base vectors as @xmath118 , but here we prefer another way to keep the form of unitary operator , and to redefined inner product as @xmath119    applying our representation onto this quantum penny flip game , the system state is @xmath120 the single - player state coming from classical sub strategy space is @xmath121 if we quantize it anyway as we did in section @xmath18[quantizedclassical ] that in a pure state of quantized classical game , the single - player state is @xmath122",
    "then @xmath123 will have off - diagonal term , while @xmath124 only has the diagonal term . now , applying our representation onto quantum strategy space of this penny flip game , the single - player state is @xmath125 here @xmath126 can be any one of @xmath127 .",
    "next step , we allow our strategy can be mixture state in @xmath104 . the single - player state of a general mixture strategy will be @xmath128 where @xmath129 are quantum pure strategies , may or may not equal to @xmath130 .",
    "this means @xmath131 is mixture state but maybe diagonal in other set of base vectors .",
    "a more general system state can be constructed in the quantum strategy space @xmath104 by destroying equ([quantumdensity ] ) .",
    "we ever mentioned in the last part of section @xmath18[quantizedclassical ] that density matrix of a general state is not required to be a direct product to density matrix of every single player . but still , the meaning of such state is not clear here .    in the later discussion ,",
    "we name equ([c ] ) , equ([q ] ) , equ([q ] ) and equ([qq ] ) as classical game ( cg ) , quantized classical game ( qcg ) , pure - strategy quantum game ( pqg ) and quantum game ( qg ) , respectively . and",
    "in the classical game , when the system density matrix is not a direct product , we call the game as entangled classical game ( ecg ) , while for quantum case , entangled quantum game ( eqg ) . the strategy space of all these games have the relation that @xmath132 the relation is ` @xmath133 ' not ` @xmath134 ' because it s possible that the later has no independent meaning other than the former although the later has a larger strategy space .",
    "in fact , for classical game , we still have another smaller strategy space  classical pure strategy space , and the game in that space  pure - strategy classical game ( pcg ) .",
    "fortunately , the relation between pcg and cg is already clear enough through nash theorem , so it s not necessary to discuss it anymore .",
    "now all games have been unified in our mathematical representation .",
    "everyone has its own strategy space and base strategy vectors . in order to finish presenting our representation ,",
    "we need to calculate the new payoff function @xmath54 .",
    "let s still use the quantum penny flip game as an example .",
    "in quantum game , because the non - commutative relation between operators ( base vectors ) , the order of acting effects the results . on the contrary , in classical game , usually",
    "the base vectors are commutative , so the order of acting does nt matter .",
    "we can see this by @xmath135 = 0,\\ ] ] but @xmath136 = \\left[\\begin{array}{cc}0 & -2i\\\\-2i & 0 \\end{array}\\right ] = -2if^{c } \\neq 0.\\ ] ] we define the order is @xmath137 , then the original payoff function @xmath29 is defined to take the value of @xmath138 where @xmath139 is anyone of @xmath140 .",
    "this will give all @xmath141 values of @xmath142 .",
    "in classical game , we require and notice that @xmath29 is naturally a @xmath30-tensor , because the payoff of mixture strategy is the weighted average with their own probability . the linear property of this payoff is a requirement of our new system - level payoff function , which is a @xmath143-tensor , or we say , linear for right vector , anti - linear for left vector .",
    "but , here in quantum game , from equ([quantumsinglepayoff ] ) we find @xmath29 is definitely not a tensor , not a linear mapping , @xmath144 then is it possible to transform such payoff into system - level @xmath143-tensor ?",
    "we need to prove it . from classical game , one thing we already know that in the classical state subspace @xmath145 , no matter the strategy is pure or mixture , such transformation exists .",
    "so we use three steps to prove that a system - level @xmath143 tensor payoff can be constructed .",
    "first , for system state only staying on one base vectors @xmath146 , so that @xmath147 we define the elements @xmath148 for example , @xmath149 , which means when both player @xmath42 and player @xmath22 choose @xmath150 , player @xmath42 wins ; @xmath151 , which has no classical meaning , because it s a off - diagonal elements .",
    "it s easy to prove that @xmath54 is hermitian , @xmath152^ { * } \\\\ & = & \\left[tr\\left(s^{2'}s^{1'}\\rho^{\\dag}_{0}s^{1}s^{2}\\left(p^{i}\\right)^{\\dag}\\right)\\right]^ { * } \\\\ & = & \\left[tr\\left(p^{i}s^{2'}s^{1'}\\rho^{\\dag}_{0}s^{1}s^{2}\\right)\\right]^ { * } \\\\ & = & \\left(h^{i}_{ss^{'}}\\right)^ { * } , \\end{array}\\ ] ] in which , we require @xmath153 .",
    "so @xmath154    second , we prove that for a system state not staying on the base vector , but on pure state , such as @xmath155 we still have @xmath156 , in which @xmath54 is a @xmath157-tensor .",
    "* proof * : from payoff definition equ([quantumsinglepayoff ] ) , @xmath158 in which we need the property that @xmath159 is a linear operator . on the other hand , when @xmath54 is a @xmath143-tensor , @xmath160 using the definition of @xmath161 in equ([quantumpayoffmatrix ] ) , we know they equal .    at last , we prove for a mixture state , such as @xmath162 we still have @xmath163 .",
    "* proof * : using above result , @xmath164 therefor , for any system state we still have @xmath165 the payoff matrix of the quantum penny flip game is a @xmath166 matrix @xmath167\\ ] ] and @xmath168 .",
    "compare with the payoff matrix of classical game with the payoff matrix of quantum game , a significant difference is that the later has non - zero off - diagonal elements while the former only has diagonal elements . through this representation we know",
    "the difference between classical game and quantum game is not only the size of strategy space but also the off - diagonal elements of payoff matrix .    from @xmath54 above",
    ", the sub - matrix related with @xmath169 is @xmath170= -h^{2,c}.\\ ] ] they are different with the new payoff matrix of the original classical game , @xmath171= -h^{2,c}_{original},\\ ] ] which only has diagonal terms .",
    "so we can say , the quantization process changes the definition of the original classical game .",
    "however , the meaning of quantum game does not completely depends on the equivalence with the original classical game .",
    "so even given such difference , quantum game is still probably a new game .",
    "if we defined a quantum game by payoff matrix @xmath54 , another privilege of this new representation is that the definition of a quantum game is independent on @xmath172 , the state of a quantum object .",
    "our payoff function can be directly defined on system state @xmath173 .",
    "of course , any payoff defined on @xmath172 can be transferred equivalently into a function on @xmath173 .",
    "so a quantum game can be defined as @xmath174 in which @xmath175 has base vectors @xmath176 , and @xmath100 has base vectors @xmath177 .",
    "usually the later is a subset of the former .",
    "a classical payoff function is defined on system base vectors such as @xmath178 , while a quantum payoff function is defined as @xmath179 . if @xmath100 is a subspace of @xmath99 , the payoff matrix of classical game",
    "just take the corresponding diagonal parts whether the corresponding sub - matrix of the quantum game payoff matrix has non - zero off - diagonal terms or not .    in the next part of this paper , we try to make use of this representation and hopefully to find something significant .",
    "in the new representation , a game seems very similar with an ising model with global interaction .",
    "the payoff of every player is related with everyone else .",
    "the state of every player can be represented by a quantum state vector or density matrix .",
    "every player try to stay at point with the maximum payoff , while in ising model , the whole system try to stay at minimum energy point .",
    "the distribution of a quantum system at thermal equilibrium is @xmath180 where @xmath12 is the system hamiltonian , @xmath181 is so called partition function .    now as in statistical mechanics , we introduce the idea of distribution function of state into game theory , but instead of function in @xmath182 space in statistical mechanics , here in @xmath183 space , the state space of every single player .",
    "a natural form is @xmath184 in which @xmath185 is the payoff function of player @xmath14 in its own strategy space and @xmath181 is the partition function in @xmath14 s strategy space .",
    "the payoff matrix @xmath54 we have now is defined in system strategy space .",
    "so a kind of reduced matrix is what we need to find .    before the detailed calculation ,",
    "one thing we should notice that the equilibrium density matrix description is different with the classical mixture strategy . if the eigenvectors of @xmath185 can be found as @xmath186 , then @xmath187 is similar with the classical mixture strategy form , and @xmath188 can be regarded as the probability on strategy @xmath189 . but first , such an set of eigenvectors is not always the same as the classical base vectors , because sometimes , we have non - zero off - diagonal elements .",
    "second , such a density matrix gives the probability of any pure strategies @xmath190 even being different with the base vector , by @xmath191 this is impossible in mixture strategy description .",
    "now we start to define the reduced payoff matrix and investigate its properties .",
    "a nash equilibrium state is defined that at that point every player is at the maximum point due to the choices of all other players are fixed .",
    "a reduced payoff matrix should describe the payoff of a single person when the choice of all other players . in the traditional language of game theory ,",
    "such a reduced payoff matrix is equivalently to be defined like the end result of equ([oldearn ] ) under any arbitrary fixed @xmath192 .",
    "but we need a matrix form here .    for pure system strategy",

    "when both player @xmath42 and player @xmath22 stays on pure strategy @xmath196 respectively , it has a natural definition , @xmath197 .",
    "since our strategy can be a mixture state , or generally a density matrix form , we need to generalize the above definition .",
    "a reduced payoff matrix of player @xmath42 in a @xmath22-player game is defined as @xmath198 where @xmath199 is the trace in subsapce of player @xmath22 . from equ([payoffvalue ] ) , the payoff value of player @xmath42 is @xmath200 so if we know the reduced payoff matrix of player @xmath42 , the payoff value can be calculated by @xmath201    in fact the @xmath199 action is quite hard to perform , because this requires the result of a trace is a matrix , not a number as usual .",
    "an equivalent but easily understood form of equ([reducedpayoff ] ) is @xmath202 in which @xmath203 is a sub matrix with fixed player @xmath42 s index ( here , first and third index ) . in order to define a general form for @xmath11-player game ,",
    "we denote the trace @xmath204 as diagonal summation in the space except player @xmath14 s .",
    "so in @xmath22-player game , @xmath205 .",
    "then a general reduced payoff matrix of player @xmath14 under fixed strategies of all other players is @xmath206    still using the prisoner s dilemma as example , when player @xmath22 choose strategy @xmath207 with @xmath208 and @xmath209 with @xmath210 , the state is @xmath211\\ ] ] then @xmath212\\left[\\begin{array}{cc|cc } -2 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\0 & -5 & 0 & 0 \\\\ \\hline 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\0 & 0 & 0 & -4 \\end{array}\\right]\\right ) \\\\ & = & \\left [ \\begin{array}{cc } -2p^{2}_{c}-5p^{2}_{d } & 0 \\\\0 & 0\\cdot p^{2}_{c}-4p^{2}_d \\end{array}\\right ] .",

    "every single step , when a random spin is chosen , it faces the same situation with our game player .",
    "all other spins have decided one state to stay temporary , it has some choices of its own state by evaluating the energy difference between all its possible states .",
    "then it choose one state to stay by a transition probability or transition rate over all possible states .",
    "the kinetics equation for such process is not unique , different forms of transition probability can give the same equilibrium state .",
    "now we face a quantum system , although a similar situation .",
    "every player should make his decision every step with the fixed state of all other players and we also ask for the equilibrium state .",
    "the reason that different kinetics equations give the same equilibrium state in statistical physics is the well - known detailed balanced theorem in thermal equilibrium , but we do nt have a corresponding one in game theory .",
    "we now just suppose that at equilibrium state , the density matrix of player @xmath14 s state is @xmath213 and we choose a heuristic kinetics equation as iteration equation , @xmath214 then the equilibrium state is defined as the fixed point of this iteration if it has fixed point .",
    "in fact , kinetics equation equ([kineticsequation ] ) is @xmath11 related iteration equations . the existence of the fixed point is not obvious .",
    "even the questions itself is not unique , although the experience in simulation in statistical physics implies that such equation should exist probably with different form .",
    "the fixed point might be different with nash equilibrium even if it exists .",
    "in this paper , all these questions are neglected .",
    "let s first test such idea in some examples , just like what a physicist usually does , not a mathematician , who will pay more attention on a general definition of equilibrium state and the proof of the existence .",
    "equ([kineticsequation ] ) of a classical game is much easier to deal with than the one of a quantum game . in classical game , both @xmath54 and @xmath185 are diagonal . the density matrix at time @xmath215 can always be written as @xmath216 , then equ([kineticsequation ] ) will lead to a series of evolution equations for @xmath217 .",
    "however , in quantum game , since the payoff matrix @xmath54 has off - diagonal elements , the reduced payoff matrix @xmath185 also can have off - diagonal elements",
    ". then the density matrix can be equivalently replaced by evolution equation of @xmath218 * only * when the density matrix is expressed in the base vector formed by the eigenvectors of @xmath185 . but with off - diagonal elements , such eigenvectors are not always the base vector we used to express the game and they might change during the iteration process .",
    "so the first step is to solve the eigenvalue equation of @xmath54 and @xmath185 .",
    "the eigenvalue problem in classical game is quite easy .",
    "all the eigenvectors are the base vector we used , the eigenvalues are just the corresponding diagonal elements . in a quantum game , it depends on the details of payoff matrix .",
    "for example , in the quantum penny flip game , the payoff matrix @xmath77 has @xmath166 elements .",
    "even when player @xmath22 choose @xmath219 , the reduced payoff matrix of player @xmath42 is @xmath220\\ ] ] the eigenvalues and the corresponding eigenvectors are @xmath221^{t } \\\\ 2 & \\rightarrow & \\left[1,0,1,0\\right]^{t } \\\\ 0 & \\rightarrow & \\left[-1,0,1,0\\right]^{t } \\\\ 0 & \\rightarrow & \\left[0,i,0,1\\right]^{t } \\end{array } \\right).\\ ] ] this means a quantum player can make money over the classical player with @xmath222 by using strategy @xmath223^{t}$ ] .",
    "and the funny thing is the value of payoff the 2 , not @xmath42 in classical case when player @xmath42 uses @xmath224^{t}$ ] .",
    "it clearly shows the effect of the off - diagonal elements for a quantum player .",
    "if the player @xmath42 is still a classical player , the strategy he can use is just @xmath225 , so he will get @xmath226 respectively . anyway , the topic of this section is show the way to do the iteration defined in the kinetics equation equ([kineticsequation ] ) , not the reason of such difference .",
    "now we have the idea .",
    "starting , for instance , from player @xmath22 choose @xmath227 , the state of player @xmath42 is then @xmath228 and then substitute it back to equ([kineticsequation ] ) and do the iteration .",
    "however , from above density matrix we know that even beginning from a pure state , the state after one iteration will be a mixture state . in classical game ,",
    "it does nt matter , because the end state generally can be a mixture state , and a pure state is equivalent with a mixture state with the same diagonal part .",
    "but in quantum game , mixture strategy is quite different with a pure one .",
    "one way to deal with this problem is to set @xmath229 .",
    "then the kinetics equation of quantum game becomes , @xmath230 in which @xmath231 is the eigenvector with maximum eigenvalue of the reduced payoff matrix .",
    "so only the maximum one is kept after every step . but",
    "this will brings new problems when the real equilibrium state is a mixture state .",
    "so for quantum game , it s better to regard the approach shown here just as an idea .",
    "later on , classical game is our main object .",
    "the task of this section is just to point out that a quantum game brings new things such as eigenvalue problem while which is quite trivial in classical game .",

    "it gives more details .",
    "@xmath255 is still an unstable fixed point . while the end state can be a @xmath256 or @xmath257 depending on the initial state . ]",
    "the third example is the classical penny flip game , which has no pure ne .",

    "even the only fixed point is unstable .    .",
    "the only fixed but unstable point is always @xmath252 for different @xmath17 . in figure ( b ) , two iteration functions are used to show a clearer but more complex picture , from which we know @xmath263 is still a fixed point , but if starts from initial state other than this point , the system will jump between @xmath264 , @xmath256 , @xmath143 and @xmath257 . ]    the kinetics equation , its fixed points and the stability analysis of the fixed points gives a method to find equilibrium state and to refine them if we require an applicable equilibrium point is a stable fixed point . from all the trivial cases we tested it seems valid .",
    "but questions such as more tests , a general form of such equation , and the relation between such fixed points and nash equilibrium is waiting for more detailed discussion .    at last",
    ", we have to admit that our simulation is not equivalent with the kinetics equation .",
    "pure strategies are included by the kinetics equation , but since our algorithm is classical , here we only let it evolute in the subspace of mixture strategy . for classical game , this is not a fatal problem , because we have prove that pure strategy is equivalent with mixture strategy having the same diagonal part . but for a quantum game , pure strategy is totaly different with the mixture classical one because of the off - diagonal elements of payoff matrix .",
    "is it possible to find such a simulation algorithm ?    on the other hand , when @xmath265 , the fixed point of our kinetics equation might not equal to the nash equilibrium state .",
    "such fixed points are the end states when the average resolution level of all players is @xmath17 , which can be regarded as a typical scale which players care .",
    "this concepts may expand the description of game theory into the situation that players are not complete rational .",
    "they can evaluate the payoff , but not explicitly , only a rough range . and from the experience in statistical physics , especially phase transition , we know that even when @xmath17 is not very large but large enough the lowest energy mode ( here , maximum payoff mode ) will dominate the system .",
    "this means , under some not extremely restricted conditions , the traditional nash equilibrium is still valid",
    ". it will be funny if one can prove such conclusion from a general situation in our equilibrium definition .",
    "it s quite straightforward to extend our notation into @xmath11-player game and continuous strategy case .",
    "however , although a new representation has been introduced to express everything in a static game , the advantage of such a language and the meaning of all other games is still open . and further more ,",
    "if it s acceptable for static game , is it possible to be developed into evolutionary game theory ? and",
    "cooperative game ?",
    "is it related with entangled system state ?    as discussed in section [ phase ] , because of the iteration procedure and the distribution function we used , a natural way of equilibrium calculation and refinement is provided by our pseudo - dynamical method .",
    "the non - trivial phase transition happening in statistical physics at finite @xmath266 implies the probability that when @xmath267 the traditional equilibrium state can be reached at some finite noise level , not necessary at no - noise infinite - resolution background . in this paper , we only argued such possibility , not by a real example .",
    "further analysis should be done to confirm such statement , although we believe it from the background in physics .    and as discussed in section [ qqgame ] , when our representation is used in quantum game theory , a set of base vectors of strategy ( operator ) space and their inner product need to be defined to form them as a hilbert space .",
    "then all the other procedures are quite straightforward .",
    "at least , it gives equivalent description .",
    "but there are still some open questions , like what s the meaning of a non - unitary operator in the strategy space ?",
    "does physical operator have to be unitary operator ?",
    "another interesting question is the effect of base vector transformation of hilbert space . what happens if base vectors other than our @xmath268 are used ?",
    "we have to say our present result is a theory far from complete .",
    "it stacks in our hands for a very long time , now we want to share the idea with all .",
    "in fact , it s even possible to be nothing than a toy representation of game theory .",
    "however , even in such case , it s still of little value to provide a unified description and a possible pseudo - dynamical equation theory which might be completed later so that the end state of iteration from an arbitrary initial will be the equilibrium state .",
    "as you may already noticed our paper is filled with questions other than their answers . hopefully it will motivate the discussion .",
    "ironically , during the revision of this paper , we found that the idea using a hilbert space to describe classical and quantum strategies has been proposed in @xcite long time before .",
    "so our works can be regarded as a realization and development of this idea . in our paper ,",
    "not only strategies , but also payoff functions has been reexpressed into hilbert space and operators on it .",
    "besides lots of questions in above section , here we summarize the reliable conclusions we have till now .",
    "first , in the new representation , all games including classical , quantum , even entangled game , under general @xmath11-player @xmath269 case , can be defined by a unified definition as equ([ourquantumgame ] ) .",
    "all the difference among the games is at the base vectors of strategy space and the payoff matrix  a @xmath143-tensor . in the traditional form ,",
    "payoff function of @xmath11-player classical game is @xmath270-tensor ; and for quantum game , it depends on @xmath6 and @xmath85 , even not a tensor form .",
    "we have to use special language for every specific game .",
    "second , in our representation , for quantum games , it s easy to see the role of off - diagonal elements of payoff matrix when we say a quantum player can make more money over classical player . if the payoff matrix is diagonal , it makes no difference , although a quantum player can make use of quantum pure strategy , which has off - diagonal elements in density matrix .",
    "game quantum is only possible when both density matrix and payoff matrix have off - diagonal elements .",
    "however , unfortunately , as we have pointed out in section @xmath271 , quantization of classical game probably changes the definition of original classical game .",
    "third , with the form of payoff matrix and reduced payoff matrix , equilibrium density matrix in quantum statistical mechanics @xmath272 gives an equilibrium distribution over strategy space .",
    "this provides some flexibility on the application of game theory such as average behavior and collapse into nash equilibrium under infinite resolution level ( @xmath229 ) .",
    "this helps take partial rationality into our theory .",
    "therefor , for classical game , although our new representation brings nothing new theoretically , it may provide some new technical tools to analyze the ne , to include partial rationality , and to develop evolutionary game .    if such a representation can provide some other insightful advantage besides an equivalent representation of both classical and quantum game theory , it s necessary to try more real games , both classical and quantum , in the new framework . from the section @xmath18[eigenvalue ] , we see that because the system space is the direct space of all players , the matrix form will be so large that it make all calculations un - convenient . in quantum mechanics ,",
    "the idea to solve such problem is to introduce particle - number representation to replace direct product of base vectors . for undistinguishable particles , such approach significantly reduce the hardwork of calculation .",
    "maybe such simplification can be generalized into game theory .",
