    "interest to the ragge and rptin ( r = rare earth ) ternary intermetallics gib96a , fer74a was recently stimulated by growth of single crystals of these materials and in - depth characterization of their thermodynamic and transport properties @xcite . due to the curious combination of crystallographic ( hexagonal ) and point ( orthorhombic ) symmetries of the rare earths in these two families , local magnetic moment members of the series have complex ( but tractable ) anisotropic @xmath5 phase diagrams , with intriguing metamagnetism as well as crystal electric field effects playing significant role in defining of the magnetic order @xcite .",
    "ybagge and ybptin were described as heavy fermion compounds mor04a , kat04a , tro00a , kac00a with ybagge being a rare example of the yb - based stoichiometric compound demonstrating field - induced non - fermi - liquid behavior @xcite .",
    "ybptin displays similar properties but with a less comprehensively determined phase diagram @xcite .",
    "the non - magnetic members of these families , luagge and yptin , have rather unpretentious physical properties @xcite , however , understanding of these materials from the band - structure point of view can be viewed as the first step towards comprehension of the rest of the series , especially since they serve as non - magnetic references in the analysis of the physical properties across the series . in particular",

    "comparison of the experimental resistivity data with computational , band - structure results will serve as a test of the theoretical description of these materials and will allow for the identification of the qualitative features of their fermi surfaces responsible for the anisotropy .",
    "luagge and yptin single crystals in the form of hexagonal - cross - section rods of several mm length and up to 1 mm@xmath6 cross section were grown from high temperature ternary solutions ( rich in ag and ge for luagge and in in for yptin ) , their structure and the absence of impurity phases were confirmed by powder x - ray diffraction ( see @xcite for details of the samples growth and characterization ) . for resistivity measurements with @xmath7 ,",
    "clean , regular - shaped , as - grown or lightly polished rods were used .",
    "samples for @xmath8 measurements were cut out of thicker rods , with their length approximately along [ 110 ] crystallographic direction . in the case of yptin particular care",
    "was taken to eliminate residues of highly conductive in flux ( by polishing with subsequent etching in hcl ) that otherwise could effect the current flowing through the sample ( _ i.e. _ practically shorting out the sample ) resulting in erroneous values for resistivity and its temperature dependence .",
    "the absence of any anomaly in resistivity near @xmath9 k served as an indication of a clean sample .",
    "resistivity measurements were performed over the 2 - 300 k temperature range , in standard four - probe configuration with thin platinum wires attached to the samples by epotek h20e silver epoxy , using the act option of the quantum design ppms instrument ( @xmath10 hz , @xmath11 ma ) . for each direction of the current several samples",
    "were used and the results were within the error bars ( @xmath12 ) of the measurements of the dimensions of the samples and the position of the voltage leads .    both , luagge @xcite and yptin @xcite crystallize in fe@xmath13p / zrnial - type of structure ( _ p62 m _ space group ) with nine atoms per unit cell ( fig .",

    "[ rho ] ( a),(b ) ) are practically isotropic . the measured anisotropy in resistivity at 300 k is 4.2 ( luagge ) and 1.4 ( yptin ) .",
    "it should be noted that given the aforementioned ( conservative ) estimate of the error bars for the absolute values of resistivity , the @xmath29 for yptin may be close to being isotropic , whereas for luagge the inequality @xmath28 is unambiguous .",
    "the residual resistivity ratios ( rrr ) are quite low , @xmath30 , similarly mediocre rrr were observed for the other members of these families @xcite .",

    "the magnetic susceptibility for both compounds is slightly anisotropic and on a gross level temperature - independent ( except for the low temperature , small , impurity tail ) .",
    "since it is quite difficult to quantitatively account for different contributions to susceptibility ( landau , core , _ etc .",
    "_ ) ( see _ e.g. _ @xcite ) we will not attempt to compare the measured values with the band structure calculations .",
    "the electronic coefficient of the specific heat , @xmath37 , on the other hand , can be useful for evaluating the band structure calculations .",

    "the contribution of the electrons originating from all atoms is nearly the same and is proportional to the number of the corresponding atoms in the unit cell .",
    "the electronic specific heat coefficient @xmath42 calculated from dos at @xmath27 ( @xmath43 ) ( table  [ tab : results ] ) is 4.2 mj / mol k@xmath6 .    in the luagge compound the ge@xmath44 states band",
    "is separated from conductivity electrons band by 2 ev gap ( figs .",
    "[ fig : dos_luagge ] and fig : bnds_luagge ) .",
    "this value is significantly larger compared to yptin .",
    "the difference in the gap size is due to the deeper position of the ge-@xmath38 electrons states than in and smaller width of @xmath40-band in 4@xmath40- compared to 5@xmath40-metals  @xcite .",
    "the lu-4@xmath45 states are located around 5 ev below @xmath46 within the range of the ag-@xmath40 states and they show a very little dispersion .",
    "in contrast to yptin the @xmath27 in luagge compound is placed in pseudo - gap .",
    "the @xmath43 equals to 1.92 st/(ry atom ) .",
    "this decrease of @xmath47 translates into four times smaller @xmath42 value compared to yptin ( table  [ tab : results ] ) .",
    "the main contribution to @xmath43 is coming from the @xmath40-states of lu and @xmath41-states of ge1 atoms located in the same plane as lu .    the comparison of the calculated , @xmath42 , and measured , @xmath48 , electronic specific heat coefficients ( table [ tab : results ] ) as @xmath49 give the value of the enhancement factor @xmath50 ( due to the electron - electron and electron - phonon interactions ) of 0.4 - 0.6 .",
    "such @xmath50 values are very common for ordinary metals and were observed _",
    "e.g. _ for several alkali metals @xcite , being attributed mainly to the electron - phonon interactions .    to demonstrate the similarity of the electronic structures for yptin and luagge we calculated the @xmath27 position using yptin dos for 54 valence electrons per unit cell ( this number of electrons corresponds to luagge compound without lu-@xmath19 states ) ( see vertical dashed line on fig .  fig : dos_yptin ) .",
    "the obtained @xmath27 equals to 1.8 ev and is placed very close to the pseudo - gap in the dos .",
    "the @xmath27 calculated from luagge dos ( fig .",
    "[ fig : dos_luagge ] ) for 90 electrons per cell ( this number of electrons corresponds to hypothetic compound with 48 electrons from yptin ligands plus additional @xmath51 @xmath45-electrons from the rare earth ) equals to -1.8 ev and is placed at the peak in dos very similar to the one in yptin .",
    "these results suggest that the rigid - band approximation could be a reasonable approach for the analysis of the conductivity as a function of the band filling .",
    "the partial contributions from the different bands to the velocity tensor @xmath52 for in - plane ( [ 100]-direction ) and perpendicular to plane ( [ 001]-direction ) are shown in the left panels of figs .",
    "fig : bnds_yptin and [ fig : bnds_luagge ] .",
    "the sizable difference between velocity tensor in [ 001 ] and [ 100 ] directions is caused by larger dispersion of bands crossing fermi level in @xmath53-@xmath54 direction compared to @xmath53-@xmath55 . whereas it is difficult to single out the band responsible for the conductivity anisotropy in yptin , for luagge it is the lu-@xmath40 , ge1-@xmath41 band shown in purple in fig .",
    "[ fig : bnds_luagge ] .",
    "this anisotropy of the fermi velocity distribution is caused by a mainly two - dimensional shape of the fermi surface ( fs ) of yptin ( the fermi velocity is perpendicular to the fermi surface ) ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fs_yptin ] ) .",
    "at least two of the four fs sheets are open quasi - two - dimensional surfaces perpendicular to the [ 001]-direction .",
    "such a shape of the fs sheets is in turn determined by the layered character of yptin , where layers of y - pt2 atoms are separated by layers of in - pt2 atoms .",
    "the fs of luagge ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fs_luagge ] ) is somewhat different , however the open quasi - two - dimensional character of one fs sheet is present for this material as well .",
    "this fs sheet is shown in purple in fig .",
    "fig : fs_luagge and , as seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : bnds_luagge ] its contribution determines the anisotropic character of conductivity in luagge .",
    "the topology of the fermi surfaces calculated for yptin and luagge ( figs .",
    "[ fig : fs_yptin],[fig : fs_luagge ] suggests that search for quantum oscillations in these materials may be rather complicated .",
    "besides tiny needles centered at @xmath55-point ( in both materials ) whose existence may be questionably because of numerical uncertainties , there are the @xmath53-centered dumbbell in luagge and the @xmath53-centered hassock- ( marshmallow- ) shaped pockets in both materials which may serve as the possible candidates for de haas - van alphen / shubnikov - de haas studies .",
    "in addition , these pockets ( as well as the quasi-2d sheets in yptin ) might be studied separately if fs nesting features are analyzed .    the dependency of the [ 100 ] and [ 001 ] components of the @xmath56-tensor as a function of band filling is shown in fig .",
    "fig : conduct .",
    "the zero energy on these figures corresponds to occupation of 48 electrons calculated from yptin dos ( bottom panel ) and 48 plus 3 sets of 14-@xmath45 electrons for luagge ( top panel ) .",
    "the variation of the velocity tensors as a function of population in these both compounds is very similar.the mentioned applicability of the rigid band approximation allows us to predict ( at least qualitatively ) the increase ( decrease ) of conductivity anisotropy in yptin with substitution of pt or in atoms by atoms with larger ( smaller ) number of valence electrons .",
    "the resistivity anisotropy estimated from the calculated @xmath57-tensor is in reasonable agreement with experiment : @xmath28 with luagge being somewhat more anisotropic than yptin ( table  tab : results ) .",
    "the electronic structure and transport properties were calculated and measured in yptin and luagge compounds .",
    "the calculated electronic specific heat coefficient and conductivity anisotropy are in a semi - quantitative agreement with the experiment .",
    "it was shown that the observed anisotropy is a consequence of the shape of the fermi surfaces of these compounds .",
    "in addition , the applicability of the rigid band approximation to describe the dependence of the conductivity anisotropy on non - isoelectronic doping is established .",
    "the calculated fermi surfaces of yptin and luagge also can be used for future photoemission and quantum oscillations measurements and other properties of rptin and ragge ( r = rare earth ) series .",
    "finally , we can infer from this work that the fermi surface topology of the neighboring ( related ) members of the rptin and ragge series will manifest similar complexity .",
