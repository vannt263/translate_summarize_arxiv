    "accretion disks are accepted as important components in systems ranging from cataclysmic variables ( cvs ) and protostars to active galactic nuclei ( agn ) .",
    "these accretion disks can produce intense radiation fields over a wide range of wavelengths , with the most energetic photons and most of the flux emitted in the innermost part of the disk . the photon energy and the flux decrease with increasing radius .",
    "detection of this radiation is the most secure observational evidence for the existence of disks .",
    "x - ray binaries , in particular low mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) , are systems which crudely resemble cvs in their system parameters : masses , accretion rates and orbital separation . however , in lmxbs the detection of disks is complicated by the fact that the radiation from the innermost regions , near the compact object , is so intense that it dominates the bolometric luminosity , and the customary intrinsic disk radiation is overwhelmed by reprocessed x - rays ( shakura & sunyaev 1973 ; pacharintanakul & katz 1980 ; meyer & meyer - hoffmeister 1982 ) . as a result , direct evidence for the existence of disks in these systems",
    "is less secure than in cvs .",
    "studies of the ultraviolet ( uv ) spectra and the uv and optical to x - ray intensity ratios of several lmxbs indicate that beyond @xmath0 cm from disk center , x - ray reprocessing should dominate over power generated locally by viscous dissipation ( e.g. , van paradjis 1983 ; blair et al .",
    "1984 ; vrtilek et al . 1990 , 1991 ; kallman , raymond & vrtilek 1991 ) .",
    "models for heated disks are consistent with the few uv fluxes and spectra which have been observed ( vrtilek et al .",
    ", 1990 ; kallman , boroson and vrtilek 1998 ) ; the observed uv fluxes from lmxbs exceed those predicted by viscous dissipation alone by a factor @xmath110 .",
    "one aspect of lmxb spectra which remains a puzzle is the origin of the uv emission lines , such as c  iv @xmath21550 and n v @xmath21240 .",
    "these lines typically have luminosities of @xmath3 erg s@xmath4 or greater , and appear single peaked but with widths @xmath5100 km s@xmath4 ( e.g. kallman , boroson and vrtilek 1998 ; vrtilek et al . , 1994 ) .",
    "it is straightforward to show that if these lines are emitted via collisional excitation from optically thin gas , then their fluxes alone imply an emission measure of n@xmath6v@xmath7 @xmath8 or greater , assuming cosmic abundances and favorable ionization balance .",
    "past work has tested the hypothesis that this originates from an x - ray heated disk chromosphere , but this fails to provide sufficient emission measure at suitable ionization and optical depth ( raymond , 1993 ; ko and kallman , 1994 ) .",
    "the most obvious reason for this failure is that only a very thin layer on the heated disk is optically thin to incident x - rays and to reprocessed uv lines .",
    "theoretical models predict that x - ray heating can have profound effects on the disk dynamics and vertical structure .",
    "since x - rays tend to heat low density gas to a temperature @xmath9k , the surface of a heated disk is expected to either puff up and form a static corona , or to emit a thermal wind , depending whether the thermal velocity exceeds the local escape velocity , @xmath10 ( e.g. begelman , mckee and shields , 1982 , hereafter bms ) . since the local escape velocity decreases with radius , the inner disk corona is expected to remain bound and static .",
    "the photons scattered by the corona can explain the gradual and partial eclipse of x - rays at optical minimum when the companion star blocks the line of sight of the compact object in certain nearly edge - on systems ( white & holt 1982 ; mcclintock et al . 1982 ) .",
    "the boundary between the static corona and wind region occurs at a radius which is comparable to the disk outer radius , so that the effects of the thermally - driven wind on the disk mass budget and x - ray spectrum and light curve are expected to be small . a hot ,",
    "x - ray heated wind is likely to have negligible effect on the appearance of an lmxb in the uv continuum or lines .",
    "a ubiquitous phenomenon in cataclysmic variable uv spectra is the appearance of p cygni profiles in the strong resonance lines such as c  iv @xmath21550 and n v @xmath21240 .",
    "a possible explanation for this is a wind from the accretion disk driven by uv radiation pressure , analogous to the winds in ob stars ( e.g. cordova and mason , 1982 ; drew 1987 ) .",
    "theoretical models have demonstrated that this mechanism can account for many of the features of the observed lines , such as inclination angle dependence , and velocity width ( proga , stone and drew , 1998 , hereafter psd  98 ; pereyra kallman and blondin , 2000 ) .",
    "however the radiation - driven disk wind model can not account for all of the features , in particular , relatively high mass loss rates observed in cvs",
    ". comparison of mass loss rates predicted by the models with observational constraints show that either mass accretion rates in high - state cvs are higher than presently thought by a factor of 2 - 3 or that radiation pressure alone is not quite sufficient to drive the observed hypersonic flows ( drew & proga 2000 ; mauche & raymond 2000 ) .    in lmxbs ,",
    "uv driven winds are not expected to be efficient , owing to the effects of x - ray ionization ; wind material exposed to a strong flux of x - rays will become highly ionized and will therefore have a lower concentration of ions capable of providing uv line opacity and radiative driving . however , it is possible that the column density of the wind material is sufficient to allow a region which is shielded from x - ray ionization and which can therefore support a uv - driven wind .",
    "such a wind can potentially account for the observed properties of the uv lines : if the wind velocity field contains a significant poloidal component then the line profiles will not be double - peaked , and the wind density may be low enough and the velocity gradient sufficiently large to avoid line self - shielding .",
    "uv driven winds are a likely explanation for the outflows in agns , particularly broad absorption line ( bal ) quasars .",
    "these objects resemble lmxbs in their x - ray / bolometric ratios , and recent simulations have demonstrated that agn disk winds can provide sufficient shielding against x - ray ionization to allow significant mass loss near the disk plane ( proga , stone and kallman 2000 , hereafter psk ) . in this paper",
    "we attempt to determine whether stellar mass systems with strong x - rays , i.e. lmxbs , can harbor significant uv - driven disk winds in a manner analogous with agn disk winds .",
    "if so , we would consider such winds to be a likely candidate for the site of emission of uv lines .",
    "in doing so , we use many of the same assumptions and numerical techniques applied to our study of agn disk winds in psk .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows : in section  2 we discuss previous work on lmxb disk winds . in section 3",
    ", we describe our computational algorithm .",
    "we present our results in section  4 and discuss them together with perceived limitations in section  5 . in section  5",
    "we also discuss the limits on the validity of the analogy between lmxbs and agns .",
    "we summarize our conclusions in section  6 .",
    "past work on the dynamics of coronae and winds from accretion disks in lmxbs has concentrated exclusively on the effects of x - ray heating , beginning with the basic work by bms and begelman & mckee ( 1983 ) . with a few exceptions , treatment of this inherently two - dimensional problem",
    "was reduced to one dimension by solving the vertical structure on cylinders at different radii .",
    "such a simplified treatment ignores the effects of radiative transfer in the corona . to address this problem , ostriker ,",
    "mckee & klein ( 1991 ) calculated the flux incident at the base of the corona for an isothermal x - ray heated corona in the single - scattering limit while murray et al .",
    "( 1994 ) used a two - dimensional flux limited radiative diffusion technique . to predict the iron k",
    "- shell feature for x - ray binaries , vrtilek , soker & raymond ( 1993 ) performed two - dimensional monte - carlo simulations for the radiative transfer .",
    "the first two - dimensional hydrodynamical calculations of the structure of a thermally - driven wind from an accretion disk heated by x - rays from a central source were performed by woods et al .",
    "earlier two - dimensional calculations of the x - ray heated wind did not include any of the disk in the computational domain ( melia , zylstra & fryxell 1991 ; melia & zylstra 1992 ; balsara & krolik 1993 ) .",
    "woods et al.s ( 1996 ) calculations were designed to understand the types of wind solutions available for different luminosities and compton temperatures .",
    "their calculations help to extend and improve on the analytic predictions of bms for x - ray heated winds by including non - compton processes such as photoionization heating and line cooling .",
    "the results from these improved two - dimensional calculations agree well with many predictions given by bms , even when non - compton processes dominate .",
    "other mechanisms that can drive a wind off the disk photosphere have been studied primarily in the context of cvs and agns .",
    "examples include magneto - centrifugal force due to an accretion disk ( e.g. , blandford & payne 1982 ) and radiation pressure due to lines ( e.g. , vitello & shlosman 1988 ; murray et al .",
    "the relative importance of these different mechanisms is likely to depend on the type of the system .",
    "for example , in systems with cool disks , such as low mass young stellar objects ( yso ) , the magneto - centrifugal force is the only promising mechanism because radiation pressure due to lines ( line force , in short ) and thermal expansion are likely to be negligible ( e.g. , knigl & ruden 1993 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the line force is a candidate for wind driving in systems with hotter disks such as in non magnetic cvs ( e.g. , psd  98 , proga  2000 ) . for example",
    ", in the most favorable conditions ( i.e. , high uv flux and low x - ray flux ) the line force can exceed the radiation pressure due to electron scattering by a factor as high as @xmath11 ( e.g. , castor abbott , & klein 1995 , hereafter cak ; abbott 1982 ; gayley 1995 ) .",
    "thus systems with luminosity as low as 0.1 per cent of their eddington limit can produce a powerful high velocity wind .",
    "magneto - centrifugal winds can not be excluded from such systems , but they may not be required to account for the observed lines . when wind material is exposed to the uv radiation but also to strong x - rays",
    ", the conditions for line driving can dramatically worsen as x - rays may highly ionize the gas and reduce a concentration of ions capable of providing uv line opacity .    models for wind driving in x - ray binaries with massive companions ( mxbs ) have shown that it is possible that line - driven winds can survive against x - ray ionization .",
    "for example , stevens & kallman ( 1990 ) and ( stevens 1991 ) calculated the structure of line - driven winds , including the effects of the ionization balance on the uv line opacity , for various x - ray luminosities with and without optical depth effects . additionally , they considered irradiation at various directions including the normal to the mass losing photosphere . in none of the models",
    "did the irradiation penetrate below the so - called wind critical point where the wind is already launched and its mass loss rate is determined .",
    "these models verified that the irradiation can severely decrease the wind velocity in the supersonic portion of the flow but does not greatly affect the wind mass loss rate . the line - driven wind from a disk has an advantage over the wind from a star in surviving against x - ray ionization owing to the fact that the x - ray flux strikes the disk always at a grazing angle whereas it can strike the star nearly normal to the photosphere .",
    "thus it is possible that the x - rays do not irradiate the disk but rather the line - driven disk wind .",
    "such a case has recently been found by us ( psk ) , in which we calculated axisymmetric time - dependent hydrodynamic calculations of line - driven winds from accretion disks in agn .",
    "the central engine of the agn is a source of both ionizing x - rays and wind - driving uv photons . to calculate the radiation force",
    ", we took into account radiation from the disk and the central engine .",
    "the gas temperature and ionization state in the wind were calculated self - consistently from the photoionization and heating rate of the central engine .",
    "we found that the x - rays from the central object are significantly attenuated by the disk atmosphere so they can not prevent the local disk radiation from pushing matter away from the disk .",
    "however in the supersonic portion of the flow high above the disk , the x - rays can overionize the gas and decrease the wind terminal velocity .    as mentioned in section  1 ,",
    "x - ray irradiation has been suggested as a mechanism to boost the uv radiation from the disk in lmxbs at radii @xmath12  cm .",
    "uv radiation is known to be effective in driving a wind because there are many spectral lines ( @xmath13 ) to scatter uv continuum photons provided that the gas is at temperature @xmath14 ( e.g. , cak ; abbot 1982 ; puls et al .",
    "thus we expect that if the line force is important in driving disk winds it should be for radii from a few @xmath15  cm to @xmath16  cm because most of the disk uv radiation ( generated by local disk viscosity and due to x - ray reprocessing ) is emitted at those radii .",
    "we also note that thermal expansion in this region of the disk can not produce a robust wind but rather a nearly isothermal corona for parameters suitable for lmxbs ( bms , woods et al .",
    "1996 , and section  4 ) .",
    "our goal in this work is to understand how inclusion of the line force can change the dynamics of a corona / wind from the x - ray heated disk in a lmxb .",
    "we use the model from psk and simply adopt model parameters suitable for a typical lmxb .",
    "we compare our results with results from bms and woods et al . for the pure x - ray heated disks and with the results for the pure line - driven disk winds from psd  98 , proga , stone & drew ( 1999 , hereafter psd  99 ) , proga ( 1999 ) and psk .",
    "our 2.5-dimensional hydrodynamical numerical method is in most respects as described by psk .",
    "here we only describe the key elements of the method and refer a reader to psk for details .",
    "we study the dynamics of a wind from a keplerian , geometrically - thin and optically - thick disk . to calculate the structure and evolution of a wind",
    ", we solve the equations of hydrodynamics @xmath17",
    "@xmath18 @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the mass density , @xmath21 is the gas pressure , @xmath22 is the velocity , @xmath23 is the internal energy density , @xmath24 is the net cooling rate , @xmath25 is the gravitational acceleration of the central object , @xmath26 is the total radiation force per unit mass . we assume a fully ionized gas for which @xmath27 , and we consider models with @xmath28 . in solving the energy equation ( eq .",
    "3 ) , we include absorption and emission of radiation through the radiation net cooling rate , @xmath29 .",
    "we perform our calculations in spherical polar coordinates @xmath30 .",
    "we assume , natural for a keplerian disk , axial symmetry about the rotational axis of the disk ( @xmath31 ) . however we allow the @xmath32 axis to be above the disk midplane , at the height , @xmath33 , corresponding to the disk pressure scale height .",
    "a realistic description of the radiation field from the interface between the disk and the neutron star would require detailed knowledge of the geometry of the flow near the neutron star , which is beyond the scope of this investigation .",
    "instead we model the innermost part of the disk as a point source of radiation located at the origin of our computational grid ( that is located a height @xmath33 above the disk midplane ) .",
    "this is equivalent to assuming the central source has finite width .",
    "our computational domain is defined to occupy the radial range @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is the radius of the neutron star , and the angular range @xmath36 .",
    "this choice is determined by the radial temperature distribution of the disk ; for @xmath37 the disk temperature is predicted to be @xmath38k , and winds at temperatures greater than this have a greatly reduced efficiency of radiation pressure driving ( abbott , 1982 ) .",
    "our gridding of the computational domain and the boundary conditions are as in psk . here",
    "we only summarize our boundary conditions . at @xmath39",
    ", we apply an axis - of - symmetry boundary condition . for the outer radial boundary",
    ", we apply an outflow boundary condition . for the inner radial boundary @xmath40 and for @xmath32 , we apply reflecting boundary conditions for the density , velocity and internal energy . to represent steady conditions in the photosphere at the base of the wind , during the evolution of each model",
    "we apply the constraints that in the first zone above the @xmath32 plane the radial velocity @xmath41 , the rotational velocity @xmath42 remains keplerian , the density is fixed at @xmath43 at all times and also the internal energy is fixed at @xmath44 at all times ( @xmath45 is the proton mass , and @xmath46 is the mean molecular weight ) .",
    "also as in psk , we solve eqs . 1 - 3 using an extended version of the zeus-2d code ( stone & norman 1992 ) .    the geometry and assumptions needed to compute the radiation field from the central object are similar to those described in psk .",
    "we exactly follow psk to compute the radiation from the disk when we consider a flat disk .",
    "however we also consider a slightly concave surface of the disk and then we follow vrtilek et al .",
    "( 1990 ) to compute the effective temperature of the irradiated disk .",
    "the disk photosphere is coincident with the @xmath32 axis .",
    "we specify the radiation field of the non - irradiated disk by assuming that the temperature follows the radial profile of the optically thick accretion disk ( shakura & sunyaev 1973 ) , and therefore depends on the mass accretion rate in the disk , @xmath47 , the mass of the neutron star , @xmath48 and the inner edge of the disk , @xmath35 , that coincides with the radius of a neutron star .",
    "we include the effect of a radiant central object both in modifying the radial temperature of the disk , and in providing a contribution to the driving radiation field .",
    "we express the central object luminosity @xmath49 in units of the disk luminosity @xmath50 .",
    "we define the central object luminosity as the intrinsic luminosity of a neutron star , @xmath51 plus the luminosity due to release of accretion energy outside the disk proper , for example , in the boundary layer between the disk and the star , @xmath52 . if the latter luminosity dominates then x=1 because half of the total accretion energy is release in the disk and the other half in the boundary layer ( e.g. , shakura & sunyaev 1973 ) .",
    "we expect that this is the case in lmxbs because these systems have relatively high mass accretion rates ( i.e. , @xmath53 ) . as in psk",
    ", we allow for the situation when only some fraction of the central object luminosity takes part in driving a wind via lines .",
    "we identify this fraction as the luminosity in the uv band , @xmath54 .",
    "we refer to the fraction of the luminosity that is responsible for ionizing the wind to a very high state as the luminosity in the x - ray band , @xmath55 . for simplicity , we assume here that this fraction of the luminosity does not contribute to line driving .",
    "we call the luminosity in the remaining bands , mainly optical and infrared , as @xmath56 .",
    "we assume that @xmath57 is the part of the luminosity that does not change the dynamics or ionization of the wind .",
    "we consider relatively high accretion rates that imply a high temperature ( @xmath58  k ) of the central object .",
    "therefore we set @xmath59 and@xmath60 to zero in the remaining part of the paper . in turn , we assume that @xmath61 .",
    "we take into account the irradiation of the disk by the central object , assuming that the disk re - emits all absorbed energy locally and isotropically .",
    "we note that for a flat disk , the contribution from irradiation is negligible for @xmath62 and large radii .",
    "the contribution from irradiation can be significant when the disk height increases with radius ( see below ) .",
    "we approximate the radiative acceleration due to lines using a modified cak method .",
    "the line force at a point defined by the position vector @xmath63 is @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the frequency - integrated continuum intensity in the direction defined by the unit vector @xmath66 , and @xmath67 is the solid angle subtended by the disk and central object at the point .",

    "the maximum value of the force multiplier is a function of physical parameters of the wind and radiation field .",
    "several studies have showed that @xmath78 is roughly a few thousand for gas ionized by a weak or moderate radiation field ( e.g. , cak ; abbott 1982 ; stevens & kallman 1990 ; gayley 1995 ) .",
    "as the radiation field becomes stronger and the gas becomes more ionized the force multiplier decreases asymptotically to zero .",
    "we evaluate the radiation force in four steps .",
    "first , we calculate the intensity , the velocity gradient in the @xmath66 direction and then the optical depth parameter @xmath81 .",
    "second , we calculate the parameters of the force multiplier using a current value of the photoionization parameter : @xmath82 where @xmath83 is the local x - ray flux , @xmath84 is the number density of the gas ( @xmath85 ) . in this step",
    "we adopt results of stevens & kallman ( 1990 ) .",
    "to estimate @xmath86 , we correct the ionizing flux for the optical depth effects : @xmath87 , where @xmath88 is the luminosity of a point - like x - ray source and @xmath89 is the optical depth between the source and a point in a wind ( see psk for more details ) . thus our approach differs from stevens & kallman s one , who estimated @xmath86 assuming that the gas is optically thin ( i.e. , @xmath90 ) .",
    "then we calculate the radiation force exerted by radiation along @xmath66 .",

    "are described in psk and psd  99 .",
    "below we describe our calculations of the intensity of the irradiated disk that differ from psk s calculations when we consider a concave disk .    for a flat disk , in the disk plane at @xmath95 ,",

    "therefore a relatively luminous accretion disk with @xmath132 ( @xmath129  m@xmath130  yr@xmath4 ) has too little luminosity in the uv and can not produce a line - driven disk because it fails to satisfy the basic requirement for the strength of the uv radiation : @xmath240 > 1\\ ] ] ( e.g. , proga 1999 ) .",
    "the above equation is a modified version of equation 6 in proga ( 1999 ) , who consider systems with most of their luminosity in the uv ( @xmath241 ) and not contribution from x - rays ( @xmath242 ) . for simplicity",
    ", we set the so - called finite disk correction factor to 1 in proga s eq .",
    "we emphasize that the eddington number of the uv zone matters more than the eddington number of the whole disk and that the maximum force multiplier is a function of the photoionization parameter with the following limiting behavior : @xmath243    we finish this section with the note that in all our models , we took into account the contribution from the irradiation to the disk intensity ( see section  3 ) assuming that no irradiation is lost between the source and the disk surface .",
    "our finding that the disk wind or corona are optically thin provides a justification to this assumption .",
    "we have calculated a series of models for winds from accretion disks in lmxb .",
    "our calculations allow for self - consistent determination whether the disk wind is driven by thermal expansion or radiation pressure .",
    "the calculations show that the uv emitting accretion disk can not produce a wind that could shield itself from the strong ionization radiation emitted from the central object .",
    "this inhibition of the line - driven wind indicates that irradiation penetrates below the so - called wind critical point where , in the cak type models , the wind mass loss rate is determined .",
    "a disk wind from the uv emitting disk is only possible for very luminous sources whose luminosity is within a factor @xmath227 of the eddington limit .",
    "however in such a case , the disk wind is very hot and driven by thermal expansion assisted by the radiation pressure due to electron scattering . a cooler , line - driven wind could only be possible for an unphysically high x - ray opacity .",
    "our results are consistent with the uv observations of lmxbs which show no spectral features associated with a strong and fast disk wind , although they fail to account for the single peaked uv emission lines observed from some objects .",
    "we model here a wind from a disk that is keplerian , geometrically - thin and optically thick . to account for the disk irradiation by the central object ,",
    "we consider the disk photosphere with the concave shape ( @xmath244 ) .",
    "the shape of the disk is important because it can significantly change the role of x - ray irradiation .",

    "concluded that these disks could be non - planar or that the irradiating source could be outside the equatorial plane and/or not point - like or both .",
    "unless the inner disk screens the uv emitting disk and allows line driving , we anticipate that the convex disk would not change our main result     x - rays will still inhibit line driving .    our calculations for plausible",
    "@xmath143 show that there is a very sharp transition between the disk and the x - ray heated corona or wind .",
    "for example , the gas temperature increases by @xmath227 orders of magnitude within one grid zone in the model h2 . this dramatic change in the gas properties",
    "is partially related to an inadequate resolution on our relatively large spatial grid and to our simplistic treatment of the photoionization structure . in particular",
    ", we do not consider the optical depth effects while calculating the line cooling .",
    "more realistic treatment of photoionization could affect the transition zone between warm and very hot gas ( raymond 1993 ; ko & kallman 1994 ) .",
    "we note that the transition zone is typically very thin and hard to resolve even in time independent calculations ( e.g. , raymond 1993 ; ko & kallman 1994 ) . in previous time - dependent calculations ,",
    "simulations start where the gas is already x - ray heated ( i.e. , woods et al . 1996 ) .",
    "generally , we expect that the presence of a zone with intermediate temperature and density , the chromosphere , may somewhat change dynamics of the wind but only near its base .",
    "for example , the chromosphere may provide more shielding to x - rays and this may help to permit launching of a line - driven wind from the disk so the mass loss rate will be determined by the line force .",
    "subsequently , x - rays will irradiate that wind instead of the disk . however , we predict that the line - driven wind could not be accelerated to very high velocities because the irradiation will fully ionize the wind very close to the disk .    in our model , we do not take into account the effects of scattering of photons in a wind or corona or both ( e.g. , ostriker , mckee & klein 1991 ; murray et al .",
    "ostriker et al .",
    "( 1991 ) considered systems in which the scattered radiation was assumed to be dominated by singly scattered photons . while this assumption limited their models to systems with @xmath245 ( eq .",
    "64 in ostriker et al ) , they were able to treat the radiative transfer accurately in two dimensions .",
    "the assumption of hydrostatic equilibrium limited their models to the inner part of the disk ( @xmath246 ) . using above conditions ,",
    "we find that the single scattering limit may apply to our models because we consider systems with luminosity below @xmath247 and our computational domain is for @xmath246 . therefore we can use ostriker et al.s expressions to estimate the importance of the scattered radiation as compared to the direct radiation . using their equations 73 and 75",
    ", we found that the scattered radiation is comparable to the direct one at our inner boundary .",
    "we reached the same conclusion using murray et al.s ( 1994 ) results .",
    "murray et al .",
    "( 1994 ) made the assumptions similar to those of ostriker et al .",
    "with a difference in the treatment of the radiation field .",
    "murray et al.s method is more approximate , the scattered radiation is approximated by flux - limited diffusion , but includes multiply scattered radiation .",
    "the parameters of murray et al.s model 5 ( i.e. , @xmath248 and @xmath249  k ) are the closest to our model parameters . in particular , figure  8 in murray et al . , shows that for @xmath250 the scattered radiation is comparable to the direct one at @xmath251 ( our inner radius ) and decreases with radius whereas the direct radiation stays constant .",
    "thus the scattered radiation is important for some radii .",
    "however we anticipate that the inclusion of the effects of scattered radiation would not change qualitatively our results because the scattering of x - rays in the wind or corona would most likely increase the irradiation and suppress the line driving even more compared to our calculations .",
    "our results give an lower limit on mass loss rate of thermally driven winds .",
    "we plan future work on the effects of scattered radiation and to resolve the chromosphere .",
    "we note that both need to be done at the same time because the scattered radiation may affect the properties of the chromosphere .",
    "having said that line driving is not important in our calculations of x - ray heated disks in lmxb we can ask if our calculations are consistent with previous calculations , in particular , with those by woods et al .",
    "( 1996 ) who extended and improved the analytic predictions by bms . as woods",
    ", we included non - compton processes in radiative heating and cooling ( i.e. , photoionization heating , and line and bremsstrahlung cooling , woods at al .",
    "did not include the latter ) also as woods et al .",
    ", we did not include the effects of scattering of photons .",
    "however contrary to us , they did not include the radiation force and attenuation of the x - rays .",
    "our calculations also differ in the location of the low boundary , the base of the wind , and in the conditions along the boundary .",
    "in particular , woods et al . obtained the gas temperature along the base by solving the thermal equilibrium equations with a given , radius - independent photoionization parameter whereas we assume that the gas temperature is the same as the effective temperature of the optically thick accretion disk ( shakura & sunyaev 1973 ) . woods",
    "obtained the density from the equation of state whereas we assume a fixed density .",
    "generally , woods et al.s lower boundary conditions are specified for the gas which is in the part of the disk atmosphere heated by x - rays whereas our lower boundary conditions are for the gas in the disk photosphere where x - rays do not penetrate .",
    "this difference in the boundary conditions is also reflected in the location of the boundary : we adopted the offset of the @xmath32 axis from the disk midplane of @xmath252 whereas woods et al .",
    "adopted the offset of @xmath253 ( see their eq .",
    "we note that the lower boundary adopted by woods et al . can not be applied to the case where the gas is optically thick to x - rays ( the case we explore in this paper ) .",
    "in such a case , we can not assume a given photoionization parameter along the boundary because the photoionization parameter is a function of the optical depth through the wind the structure of which we want to calculate .    to make a comparison with models presented by woods et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , we ran several tests with the radiation force and x - ray attenuation switched off .",

    "however when we add the radiation force due to electron scattering , the @xmath260 scaling extends for smaller radii and the maximum of the mass flux density occurs at @xmath262 .",
    "we conclude that our results for a x - ray heated disk are consistent with previous models ( e.g. , bms , ostriker et al 1991 , woods et al .",
    "in particular , we showed that the solution depends on the location of the disk surface with respect to the compton radius , @xmath263 , and the disk luminosity in units of the eddington limit . a new element in our model , the inclusion of the radiation force , changes the solutions for lmxbs for systems with high luminosities ( e.g. @xmath264 ) by producing a hot robust disk wind well inside the compton radius ( at the distance from the center smaller than the compton radius by a factor of @xmath265 ) .",
    "this inner disk wind , for a very luminous system , is due to lowering of the effective gravity by the radiation force due to electrons and subsequently lowering the escape velocity .",
    "we illustrate the latter by considering the binding energy of a test particle under the influence of the gravity , the radiation force due to electrons and the centrifugal force .",
    "we assume that the particle is initially on the keplerian orbit where the centrifugal force cancels out the gravity .",

    "21 is the gravitational potential energy corrected for the radiation force due to the central object .",
    "the second term is the kinetic energy of the rotational motion and the third term is negative and is the work done by the radiation force from the disk .",
    "we assume an optically disk along the lower boundary .",
    "therefore along the lower boundary the radiation force is zero , and the centrifugal forces balances the gravity . however above the lower boundary ,",
    "gas quickly becomes optically thin and the radiation force is non zero .",
    "consequently , the total force in the radial direction is positive near the lower boundary .",
    "the classical compton radius is defined as the radius on the keplerian disk at which the escape velocity equals to the gas thermal velocity . using this definition and eq .",
    "21 , we can calculate the compton radius corrected for the effects of the radiation force , @xmath277 as @xmath278.\\ ] ] we note that @xmath277 depends on @xmath277 through the disk term .",
    "however for our illustrative purposes let us assume for a moment that the disk contribution is negligible . for @xmath279 and @xmath280 (",
    "note that @xmath272 is in radians in eq .",
    "21 - 24 ) , the correction for the radiation force , is @xmath281 .",
    "numerical simulations of disk winds driven only by thermal expansion showed that the maximum of the mass flux density is at @xmath261 ( see woods et al .",
    "1996 and also above ) . in our hydrodynamical calculations of disk winds driven by thermal expansion and radiation force",
    ", we found that the maximum of the mass flux density is at @xmath262 .",
    "if we correct for the radiation force the compton radius computed by woods et al .",
    "we find 0.014 @xmath263 which is in an agreement with our numerical calculations .",
    "we note that the compton radius depends on the luminosity of the central object and disk but also on the geometry of the streamlines relative to the geometry of the radiation field ( e.g. , @xmath277 depends the angle , @xmath272 , when the streamlines are straight ) . generally , the inclination angle between the poloidal velocity and the disk changes with the position .",
    "the radiation force vector from the disk is a complex function of the position that can be evaluated only numerically ( e.g. , icke 1981 , psd  98 ) . therefore it is not straightforward to incorporate this force to our analysis presented above .",
    "however there are some characteristics of the disk radiation that can help us to understand the geometry of the disk radiation field and understand why the disk contribution does not change the compton radius even when the disk luminosity equals to the central object luminosity as in our hydrodynamical calculations . in particular , for large radii , the radial component of the disk radiation scales as @xmath282 while the @xmath159 component scales as @xmath283 for @xmath284 .",
    "this just means that near the disk , the radiation from the disk is normal to the disk .",
    "then the escape velocity is most reduced for the streamlines normal to the disk and least reduced for the streamlines tangent to the disk .",
    "however the geometry of the streamlines is such that the gas does not gain much of support from the disk radiation because the streamlines are not aligned with the radiation flux vector from the disk .",
    "the streamlines are rather aligned with the total radiation flux . the poloidal velocity ( fig .",
    "1d ) shows that the gas streamlines are predominantly tangent to the disk for most of their length and therefore the escape velocity is little effected by the radiation from the disk .",
    "we also note that the correction of the compton radius for the radiation force depends on the conditions assumed along the lower boundary .",
    "for example , if we assume that gas along the lower boundary is optically thin ( e.g. , bms and woods et .",
    "al . 1996 ) then radial momentum balance requires the centrifugal force to cancel out the gravity minus radiation force .",
    "consequently , the test particle is not on the keplerian orbit and the rotational kinetic energy is reduce by a factor of ( @xmath285 ) compared to the optically thick case we considered in above .",
    "then for the optically thin gas along the lower boundary , the binding energy is @xmath276   -\\frac{g m_{ns}}{2r_f}\\left(1-\\frac{\\gamma_\\ast}{2}\\right ) + \\int^{0}_{\\infty } f^{rad , e}_{d , l } dl.\\ ] ] then the only difference between eq .",
    "23 and eq 21 is in the term corresponding to the rotational kinetic energy [ the factor of ( @xmath286 in eq .",
    "23 ] . from the definition and eq .",
    "23 , the compton radius corrected for the effects of the radiation force can be written as @xmath287.\\ ] ] thus for the optically thin case , the correction for the radiation force is smaller than in the optically thick case .",
    "the reason for this difference is simply due to the fact that at the lower boundary the rotational kinetic energy is smaller and therefore the gravitational binding is stronger in the optically thin case than in the optically thick case .",
    "an intriguing aspect of our calculations is that results for lmxb differ dramatically from the results for agn . as we mentioned in section  1 ,",
    "agn resemble lmxbs in their x - ray / bolometric ratios and recent calculations by psk demonstrated that agn disk winds can provide sufficient shielding against x - ray ionization to allow significant mass loss from the disk . in the case of lmxbs ,",
    "the shielding from strong x - rays is insufficient . perhaps the simplest way to try to explain this difference is to compare the compton radius , @xmath263 with the minimum radius at which the disk emits uv capable of efficiently driving a wind , e.g. , @xmath288 ) .",
    "for lmxbs , the ratio between these two radii , @xmath289 is @xmath290 whereas for agn is @xmath291 .",
    "thus in the uv emitting disk , the x - ray heating is dynamically much more significant for lmxb than for agn .",
    "in addition to the fact that x - ray heating is dynamically _ more _ important in lmxbs than in agn , we can show that line driving is dynamically _ less _ important in lmxbs than in agn . to address this question in a quantitative way",
    ", we derive analytic formulae to estimate the photoionization parameter and the optical depth in a radiation - driven disk wind ( see appendix ) .",
    "our approach is simplified in that it assumes that the wind is in a steady state and is limited to the region near the base of the wind . as we discussed in section  4 ,",
    "one of the key parameters determining the importance of uv line driving , is the eddington number of the uv zone , @xmath292 that depends on radius for a given total eddington number ( see appendix ) .",
    "the limiting behavior of @xmath292 as a function of @xmath293 , i.e. , @xmath294 at @xmath295 motivates us to use the radius in units of the inner radius of the accretion disk , @xmath296 to describe our results for line - driven disk winds .    equations a13 and a18 provide estimates for the photoionization parameter and x - ray optical depth at the base of the wind , respectively .",
    "equation a14 shows that the photoionization parameter for an optically thin case , @xmath297 decreases with decreasing @xmath298 .",
    "( @xmath299 for @xmath138 ) .",
    "therefore , in the optically thin case , the line - driven disk wind is more likely to avoid strong ionization at small radii than at large radii .",
    "however even though this effect gives the needed trend , it is not sufficient to reduce the photoionization parameter so the line force can operate in the case of lmxbs .",
    "the photoionization parameter can be sufficiently reduced ( i.e. , @xmath300 ) if x - ray attenuation is taken into account .",
    "equation a18 shows that @xmath220 per unit length increases with decreasing radius ( @xmath301 for @xmath138 ) .",
    "this implies that a line - driven wind can better shield itself at smaller radii than at larger . to illustrate the difference it makes if the wind is launched from different radii we estimate the photoionization parameter in the optically thick case @xmath302 , where the first factor is given by eq . a17 and the second",
    "is given by eq .",
    "a13 . figure  6 shows the photoionization parameter , as a function of @xmath298 for various @xmath143 .",
    "for the wind velocity , @xmath303 we adopted the value of @xmath304  km  @xmath305 while for all other parameters we adopted values typical for a lmxb ( see section 3 ) which , as we already mentioned , are very similar to those for agn .",
    "as noted above , the only difference between lmxb and agn is the radius where the disk is emitting the uv radiation .",
    "figure  6 illustrates the fact that @xmath86 is very sensitive to @xmath298 and @xmath94 .",
    "this is in qualitative agreement with our detailed numerical calculations .",
    "however figure  6 shows even a good quantitative agreement between our analytic and numerical results : the line - driven disk wind can shield itself at @xmath306 for @xmath307 , as in agn , but at @xmath308 a much higher opacity would be required ( @xmath309 ) to allow strong line driving in lmxb .",
    "we have studied radiation- and thermally driven winds from luminous accretion disks irradiated by strong x - rays in lmxbs .",
    "we have used numerical methods to solve the two - dimensional , time - dependent equations of hydrodynamics .",
    "we have accounted for the radiation force due to electron scattering and spectral lines .",
    "we have estimated the latter using a generalized multidimensional formulation of the sobolev approximation . as for thermal driving",
    ", we have taken into account the effects of the strong central radiation on the disk and wind photoionization structure and thermodynamics .",
    "we find that the local disk radiation can not launch a wind from the disk because of strong ionizing radiation from the central object .",
    "unphysically large x - ray opacities would be required to shield the uv emitting disk and allow the line force to drive a disk wind .",
    "however the same x - ray radiation that inhibits line driving can heat the disk and produce a hot wind or corona above the disk . in this respect",
    "our calculations are consistent with past work on the dynamics of coronae and winds from accretion disks in lmxbs .",
    "the main difference between our work and previous work is related to the fact that we included the radiation force : although the line force is dynamically unimportant , the radiation force due to electrons can be important for very luminous sources .",
    "we found that the reduction of the effective gravity caused by the radiation force due to electrons can expands inwards the radial range for the thermally driven disk wind .",
    "the application of our model to lmxbs provides a test for our self - consistent treatment of the x - ray heating and line - driving .",
    "our results are consistent with the uv observations of lmxbs which show no obvious spectral features associated with a strong and fast disk wind . as predicted by past work , the thermally driven disk winds and coronae are optically thin and are not likely to modify the uv spectrum of the disk photosphere and chromosphere .",
    "our calculations do not fully resolve the transition between the x - ray heated gas and the unheated gas .",
    "it is possible that the chromosphere may provide more shielding to x - rays than our calculations produce and this may help to permit launching of a line - driven wind from the disk .",
    "subsequently , x - rays will irradiate that wind instead of the disk .",
    "generally , we expect that the presence of the chromosphere may change the wind mass loss rate but not the wind velocity because its influence is greatest very close to the disk photosphere .    to put our present calculations in a larger perspective , we compared our results for lmxbs with those for agn by psk",
    ". agn resemble lmxbs in their x - ray / bolometric ratios , yet they significantly differ , for example , in their uv radiation .",
    "some agn , in particular qsos , show uv spectral features that indicate powerful winds : broad absorption lines .",
    "recent calculations by psk demonstrated that line - driven disk winds can provide sufficient shielding against x - ray ionization to allow significant mass loss from the disk .",
    "here we have shown why we do not see such disk winds in lmxbs : the shielding from strong x - rays is insufficient . to be able to assess the impact of x - ray heating upon driving of a disk wind by the line force in any system with an accretion disk we derived analytic formulae .",
    "the key parameter determining the role of the line force is not merely the presence of the luminous uv zone in the disk and of the x - rays but the distance of this uv zone from the center . in other words , the eddington number of the uv zone , @xmath310 .",
    "based on our results and results from psd98 and proga ( 1999 ) , we can write the condition for a radiation - driven wind @xmath311 > 1 $ ] ( see section  4 and eq . 6 in proga 1999 ) .",
    "using the parameters from here and psk , we find that the above condition can be more likely satisfied in the agn case where @xmath312 than in the lmxb case where @xmath313 .",
    "generally , the closer the uv zone to the center ( higher @xmath314 ) , the stronger the line force and subsequently the denser line - driven disk wind .",
    "the density of the disk wind critically determines whether the wind will stay in a lower ionization state in the presence of the x - ray radiation ( whether @xmath86 will be low ) and be further accelerated by the line force to supersonic velocities ( whether @xmath78 will be high ) .",
