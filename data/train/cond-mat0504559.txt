    "diluted magnetic semiconductors @xcite represent an important class of materials and structures where ferromagnetism can be tuned by voltage @xcite .",
    "this ability comes from the carrier - mediated character of the ferromagnetic interaction @xcite .",
    "the ferromagnetic ordered state in these systems appears due to mobile carriers interacting with stationary spins of magnetic impurities . to date",
    ", curie temperatures as high as @xmath0 have been observed in a technologically important class of the mn - doped iii - v semiconductor structures @xcite . when the magnetic semiconductors become combined with the conventional field - effect layered structures , the number of mobile carriers and the ferromagnetic interaction become tunable by the voltage @xcite .",
    "this ability to externally control the properties of magnetic crystals with means other than the external magnetic field may have important device applications .",
    "a further step from magnetic semiconductor layers would be zero dimensional systems , quantum dots ( qds ) .",
    "magnetic quantum dots can be viewed as nano - scale memory elements where information is stored in the form of magnetic polarization .",
    "such a system may have important advantages compared to the conventional metal spin - valve memories : ( 1 ) small sizes and relatively small number of carriers and ( 2 ) voltage control of the number of electrons which was already demonstrated in many experiments for non - magnetic qds @xcite .",
    "therefore it is important to develop the understanding of magnetic qds with interacting carriers .",
    "here we develop a theory of magnetic qds with many carriers where coulomb , ferromagnetic , and single - particle energies contribute to the formation of the equilibrium state . using the quasi - classical description ,",
    "we show that a qd may be split into three phases with different physical properties .",
    "the geometrical sizes of these phases are determined by the coulomb , ferromagnetic , and single - particle contributions to the chemical potential of a qd . for calculations ,",
    "we employ the mean - field theory and the boltzmann kinetic equation .",
    "this approach becomes reduced to the thomas - fermi model at low temperatures .",
    "we should note that our approach ignores the discrete structure of single - particle spectrum of qd and is valid when electrons occupy at least several quantum levels .",
    "at the same time , this approach has an important advantage : it allows us to describe the coulomb effects in relatively large qds where , as it is shown below , the coulomb interaction is very strong and significantly exceeds the ferromagnetic interaction and the kinetic energy of carriers .",
    "the hole - mediated ferromagnetism in quasi - two - dimensional ( 2d ) systems is strongly anisotropic due to the heavy hole - light hole splitting in the valence band .",
    "therefore , the magnetic polarization occurs predominantly in the growth direction .",
    "then , two magnetic states of a qd with spin polarizations `` up '' and `` down '' can represent a single bit .",
    "presently qds and other nano - structures doped with magnetic ( mn ) impurities attract a lot of attention . among other studies ,",
    "several recent theoretical papers investigate qds and their electron and excitonic states in the presence of a single mn ion @xcite .",
    "in particular , it was suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite that a qd with a single mn ion can act as a multi - qubit which can be controlled optically .",
    "another direction of research describes the magnetic states and polarons in qds with many mn ions and one or several carriers @xcite . among the above publications",
    ", the paper @xcite demonstrates that the coulomb - interaction effects in few - electron qds can determine a collective magnetic state of holes and mn spins .",
    "ferromagnetism and spin separation in digital layered structures and quantum wells were also studied in several experimental @xcite and theoretical publications @xcite .",
    "as a model system , we are going to use a qd `` made out of '' a 2d quantum well .",
    "such a zero - dimensional system can be fabricated by etching and lithographical methods . within the lithographical method ,",
    "a qd can be defined , for example , by using the top metal gates ( fig .",

    "the above operator describes the interaction between mn - spins and heavy holes and assumes a sufficiently large energy separation between the heavy - hole and light - hole quantized states in the valence band .",

    "we come to two non - local non - linear equations for the densities @xmath53 .",

    "the capacitance spectroscopy has been also applied to lateral and self - assembled quantum dots ( see e.g. @xcite ) . for the nano - structures with relatively large sizes considered in this paper ,",
    "the signature of the ferromagnetic phase in the capacitance spectra is expected to be relatively weak because of the inequality @xmath97 .",
    "however , the formation of the ferromagnetic phase can be recognized from a critical behavior of the capacitance spectrum as a function of temperature and voltage .",

    "similar structures were studied experimentally in ref.@xcite .",

    "the problems of quantum dot and wire become similar . fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] shows the capacitance of a quantum wire as a function of voltage for two temperatures , just below and above the curie temperature @xmath102 .",
    "one can see in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] that at low temperatures ( @xmath103 ) the capacitance becomes increased starting from a critical voltage @xmath104 .",
    "this voltage corresponds to the minimum 2d density ( @xmath105 at @xmath77 ; see fig .",
    "[ fig1]b ) which is necessary to obtain the ferromagnetic phase stripe in the center of nanowire . starting from this voltage , the central region of a nanowire contains a ferromagnetic stripe .",
    "the capacitance of a partially ferromagnetic wire becomes increased since the spin interaction makes a lateral potential well a little deeper and a wire can accommodate more carriers at a given voltage . if temperature increases just by @xmath106 , the ferromagnetic stripe vanishes and capacitance becomes reduced .",
    "this peculiar temperature behavior for @xmath107 can be taken as an evidence for the ferromagnetic phase .     and @xmath108",

    "in this paper , we studied quantum dots and wires with many interacting carriers within the quasi - classical approach .",
    "the strongest interaction in quantum dots with a relatively weak confinement and a large number of carriers comes from the coulomb forces .",
