    "the most promising mechanism for producing relativistic jets involves magnetohydrodynamic acceleration from an accretion disk around a black hole ( e.g. , blandford 1976 ; lovelace 1976 ; blandford & payne 1982 ; fukue 1990 ; meier 2005 ; narayan et al .",

    "grmhd codes also probe the formation of grb jets in collapsars ( e.g. , mizuno et al .  2004a , 2004b ; liu et al . 2007 ; barkov & komissarov 2008 ;",

    "circumstantial evidence such as the requirement for large lorentz factors suggested by the tev bl lacs when contrasted with much slower observed motions ( ghisellini et al.2005 ) suggests such a spine - sheath morphology , although alternative interpretations are also possible ( georganopoulos & kazanas 2003 ; bromberg & levinson 2008 ; stern & poutanen 2008 ; giannios et al .",

    "numerical simulations indicate that the jet spine and sheath are accelerated and , in part , collimated by strong magnetic fields twisted in the rotating black hole ergosphere and in the accretion disk , respectively .",
    "the helically twisted magnetic fields are expected to be dominated by the toroidal component in the far zone as a result of jet expansion because the poloidal component falls off faster with expansion and distance . in configurations with strong toroidal magnetic field",
    "the current driven ( * cd * ) kink mode is unstable .",
    "this instability excites large - scale helical motions that can strongly distort or even disrupt the system . for static cylindrical force - free equilibria ,",
    "the well - known kruskal - shafranov criterion states that the instability develops if the length of the column , @xmath3 , is long enough for the field lines to go around the cylinder at least once ( e.g. bateman 1978 ) : @xmath4 .",
    "this criterion suggests that jets are unstable beyond the alfvn surface because of @xmath5 and @xmath6 at the alfvn surface , where @xmath7 is the cylindrical radius of the jet",
    ". however , rotation and shear motions could significantly affect the instability criterion .",
    "for relativistic force - free configurations , the linear instability criteria were studied by istomin & pariev ( 1994 , 1996 ) , begelman ( 1998 ) , lyubarskii ( 1999 ) , tomimatsu et al .",

    "the linear mode analysis provides conditions for the instability but says little about the impact the instability has on the system .",
    "the instability of the potentially disruptive kink mode found from a linear analysis must be followed into the non - linear regime .",
    "the nonlinear development of the cd kink instability is different for external and internal kink modes ( e.g. , bateman 1978 ) .",
    "external disruptive instability develops in a current carrying plasma column surrounded by a vacuum magnetic field . in astrophysical systems , some amount of plasma is present everywhere . in this case",
    "an internal kink instability develops inside a resonant surface on which the helicity of the magnetic field lines matches that of the eigenmode . in dissipationless mhd , the internal instability is known to saturate .",

    "dissipation processes may result in relaxation to helical equilibrium as evoked by knigl & choudhuri ( 1985 ) for helical structures in agn jets . in the absence of cd kink instability and resistive relaxation ,",
    "helical structures may be attributed to the kelvin - helmholtz ( * kh * ) helical instability driven by velocity shear at the boundary between the jet and the surrounding medium ( e.g. , hardee 2004 , 2007 ) or triggered by precession of the jet ejection axis ( begelman et al .",
    "it is still not clear whether current driven , velocity shear driven or jet precession is responsible for the observed structures , or whether these different processes are responsible for the observed twisted structures at different spatial scales .",

    ", we present 3d results of the cd kink instability of a static plasma column .",
    "we start from static configurations because in the case of interest , the source of the free energy is the magnetic field , not the kinetic energy .",
    "therefore static configurations ( or more generally rigidly moving flows considered in the proper reference frame ) are the simplest ones for studying the basic properties of the kink instability . at the next stage",

    "this article is organized as follows .",
    "we describe the numerical method and setup used for our simulations in  2 , present our results in  3 , discuss the astrophysical implications in  4 , and present some numerical tests in the appendix .",
    "in order to study time evolution of the cd kink instability in the relativistic mhd ( * rmhd * ) regime , we use the 3d grmhd code `` raishin '' in cartesian coordinates .",
    "raishin is based on a @xmath8 formalism of the general relativistic conservation laws of particle number and energy momentum , maxwell s equations , and ohm s law with no electrical resistance ( ideal mhd condition ) in a curved spacetime ( mizuno et al .",

    "a force - free configuration is a reasonable choice for the strong magnetic field cases that we study here . in general , the force - free equilibrium of a static cylinder is described by the equation @xmath9 in particular we choose a poloidal magnetic field component of the form @xmath10^{\\alpha}}~,\\ ] ] for which one finds a toroidal magnetic field component of the form @xmath11^{\\alpha } } \\sqrt { { [ 1 + ( r / a)^{2}]^{2 \\alpha } -1 - 2 \\alpha ( r / a)^2 \\over 2 \\alpha -1}}~,\\ ] ] where @xmath12 is the cylindrical radial position normalized by a simulation scale unit @xmath13 , @xmath14 parameterizes the magnetic field amplitude , @xmath15 is the characteristic radius of the column , and @xmath16 is the pitch profile parameter .",

    "; lyubarsky 2009 ) @xmath105 . in this case one finds that the criterion for the kink instability is @xmath106 this means that the instability could affect the jet structure only if the jet expands slowly enough . assuming the parabolic shape for the jet , @xmath107 , where @xmath108 and @xmath109 are dimensionless numbers , one finds that the instability develops only if @xmath110 . even in this case",
    ", the characteristic scale for the development of the instability is very large , @xmath111    the above estimates should be considered as preliminary because we assumed that the jet moves as a whole so that there is a frame of reference in which the plasma is at rest .",
    "clearly , the criterion for the cd kink instability can be modified by the effects of relativistic rotation , gradual shear , a surrounding sheath , and sideways expansion .",
    "for example , in relativistic poynting dominated jets the growth rate of the instability strongly depends on the transverse profile of the poloidal magnetic field so that @xmath99 goes to infinity when the poloidal field is uniform ( istomin & pariev 1994 , 1996 ; lyubarskii 1999 ) . on the other hand , poynting",

    "figure 9 shows the time evolution of @xmath65 and the maximum radial velocity within a box of length @xmath66 for a simulation box with transverse boundaries at @xmath115 ( @xmath116 ) and a simulation box with transverse boundaries at @xmath117 ( @xmath118 ) .",
    "the results for the time evolution of @xmath65 and the maximum radial velocity are the same in both cases .",
    "we conclude that behavior of the cd kink instability is not affected by our choice for the transverse boundary .",
    "third , we check the influence of the initial gas pressure . in the force - free model we ignore the inertia and pressure of the plasma .",
    "however , in the simulation the relativistic ideal mhd equations are solved numerically not the force - free equations .",
    "figure 10 shows the time evolution of @xmath65 and the maximum radial velocity in a box of length @xmath66 for an initial pressure of @xmath119 and @xmath120 .",
    "the results of the time evolution of @xmath65 and the maximum radial velocity show the same linear growth rate in both cases . however , the lower initial pressure case reaches saturation at a slightly later time with higher amplitude but with a larger decline in the non - linear stage .",
    "thus , our required non - zero initial gas pressure does affect the saturation level and non - linear development of the cd kink instability somewhat ."
