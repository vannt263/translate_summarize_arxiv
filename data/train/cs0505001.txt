    "consider a game where n players can invest their money ( up to some upper limit ) on some public  fund asset .",
    "the fund manager , as a rule , doubles the amount of money received and divides it equally among all n investors .",
    "depending on the total amount each player invested , some might end up making a profit while others may lose money .",
    "assume that players have no information whatsoever about their co - players moves .",
    "the question is : what is the best move a player can make ? if we adopt one of the tenets of classical game theory , namely that players are completely rational , then there are two possible solutions to the problem which maximize profit ( when all invest the maximum amount possible , thus doubling their initial capital ) or minimize losses ( no one invests anything ) . in the real world however people are not rational in the sense of classical game theory and factors as expectations about the behavior of other players or some sort of insider information might play a role when deciding how to invest .",
    "the irrationality of market agents is one of a myriad of factors which account for the high complexity of financial markets and the difficulty in modelling them .",
    "markets may also be affected by political turmoil , unseasonable weather variations and the like . in the past few years models",
    "have been introduced in order to throw some light into the behavior of markets , mainly with aims at forecasting long - term behavior see for example @xcite .",
    "these models , which have the advantage of being either analytically or numerically treatable and usually use some kind of data input from real markets , are nonetheless unable to take into account the human factor in decision - making scenarios . to circumvent these difficulties a new approach , inspired on the ideias of statistical mechanics",
    "has been suggested @xcite , where one extends the set of causal factors in decision  making scenarios from the individual ",
    "specific to group determinants of behavior : players decisions are not market  mediated but rely on group  level influences .    with these ideias in mind",
    "our aim in this work is to extend the model for the game discussed above through the introduction of cooperation , _",
    "i.e. _ we allow agents to have partial information on the decision of its immediate neighbors , in a way to be described precisely in what follows . furthermore , we allow for some kind of randomness , the only thing known a priori being the probability of some decision , and not the decision itself . in this way",
    "we hope to describe the average behavior of a large group of agents without entering in the details of a realistic ( and certainly very difficult ) theory on psychological state of each agent .",
    "our main interest will be to see how is the average behavior of a ( large ) group of cooperative economic agents .",
    "each agent , labelled by the index @xmath5 , is allowed to invest an amount @xmath6 . before the investment , the agent @xmath5 exchange information with agent @xmath7 ( defined as the neighbor of @xmath8 ; this concept is symmetric , i.e.",
    ", @xmath5 is also neighbor of @xmath7 ) .",
    "based on that information agents make decisions as to how much they will invest according to some probability distribution parameterized in terms of a two real variables : @xmath9 and @xmath10 . the first measures",
    "how strongly people interact with each other ( group  level influence ) while the later is a measure of how strongly a player might deviate from the group . to model this we choose a suitably defined function which measures the probability of @xmath5 investing @xmath11 given that @xmath7 would like to invest @xmath12 . in a way to be precisely formalized later , @xmath10 allows us to change the expected behavior of each agent .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section @xmath13 we explain the model and make the connection with statistical mechanics . using the standard transfer matrix technique@xcite we analyze in section @xmath14 some integrable cases ( @xmath2 and @xmath15 ) in order to gain information about how the average investment changes as a function of @xmath1 . in section @xmath16",
    "we numerically evaluate the evolution for @xmath17 .",
    "we introduce a method for calculating the investment using derivatives of the biggest eigenvalue , which is based on the use of 5 points in a graphic .",
    "we finish the paper with some conclusions and perspectives .",
    "we consider an ensemble of @xmath18 agents , where each can invest an amount @xmath19 , @xmath20 a fixed integer .",
    "this restriction on @xmath20 has been made for the sake of clarity .",

    "\\label{conditional}\\ ] ] our motivation for this particular choice comes from physics , where this probability is interpreted as that of two variables ( called classical spins ) @xmath24 and @xmath23 being equal or having different values .",
    "it depends on two physical parameters : @xmath26 is the so  called interaction strength .",
    "this is in most cases a material  dependent quantity and accounts for the different collective properties materials may exhibit ( ferromagnetic , antiferromagnetic , etc . ) .",
    "@xmath10 is proportional to the inverse temperature @xmath27 and brings about entropic effects ( ordered states for low temperatures and disorder for high temperatures ) . being proportional to a temperature , in physical systems @xmath10 is always non negative , and we likewise assume our @xmath28 .    in general @xmath9 and @xmath10 can be seen as competing terms : @xmath9 is associated to the energy cost of a given spin configuration . for @xmath29 ( @xmath30 ) a configuration where spins are equal ( different )",
    "has a higher energy than the opposite configuration , which means that it is energetically more favorable to be non  magnetic ( or ferromagnetic ) ; on the other hand , the temperature @xmath31 tends to destroy magnetic order .",
    "transposing these ideas to the financial context can say that @xmath26 measures how strongly people respond to their neighbors moves , that is if they are susceptible to the influence of other players or not . in this sense",
    "it models distinct profiles of investors , which can go from agressive ( does not go along  with the pack \" ) to conservative ( does what others do ) .",
    "@xmath10 is a measure of the strength of individual response and independent of what others do .",
    "social scientists refer to this term as the  individual  specific random \" and  unobservable \" ( from the point of view of the modeler ) since it is associated to personal beliefs @xcite .    with the neighbor - to - neighbor interaction rule introduced above we can describe the behavior of the whole group :",

    "as previously discussed , investment depends essentially on the way how neighbors cooperate , _ i.e. _ the distribution @xmath60.@xmath61 defines the kind of profiles investors have .",

    "one may describe these limits in a straightforward manner :    the per capita investment is such that    @xmath65    @xmath66 if @xmath67 satisfies the inequality @xmath68 for all @xmath69 .",
    "the probability of a given state @xmath70 is @xmath71 for @xmath72 all states are equiprobable since , from the equation above , the probability does not depend on @xmath73 ; hence , the probability of each state is @xmath74 .",
    "for simplicity we assume that @xmath75 is even , the odd case being left to the reader .",
    "the per capita investment can be written as @xmath76 we can see that the number of states corresponding to the sum @xmath5 is the same as the number corresponding to the sum @xmath77 . then , @xmath78 @xmath79 since the number of states with sum between @xmath80 and @xmath81 correspond to @xmath82 .    for arbitrary values of @xmath1",

    "we give a case by case description of investment as a function of @xmath1 .",
    "to do this we adapt transfer matrix method to our model .",
    "contrary to spin systems , in the present problem nontrivial behavior appears , and this might lead to interesting new possibilities in the scenario of economic games .",

    "we would like to make an important comment on the mean value of @xmath111 .",
    "more specifically we are interested in the positivity or negativity of @xmath114 for this tells us to what extent agents are cooperating and the probability of their making investments.for example , if @xmath115 and @xmath116 , the probability of two neighbors investing the same @xmath117 is greater than the cojoint investment of @xmath118 .",

    "the first one depicts investment as a function of @xmath10 for the ratio @xmath119 . in the second figure",
    "the sign of this ratio is reversed .",
    "these clearly show how investment behavior ( how agents cooperate ) is drastically modified as a function of the profit and depends not only on * cash flow * ( cash receipts minus cash payments over a given period of time ) .",
    "in this case we have the following transfer matrix : @xmath120    the problem of computing eigenvalues is analytically tractable for general values of set @xmath121 but the expressions obtained are generally very difficult and do not improve our understanding of the problem .",
