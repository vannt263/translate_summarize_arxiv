    "four - fermion theories  @xcite find applications in several areas of physics , from condensed matter systems ( for example in models for polymers , high temperature superconductors , etc ) to high energy physics , most notably as effective models for qcd , like the nambu  jona - lasinio ( njl ) model  @xcite and its variants , including the gross  neveu ( gn ) model  @xcite .",
    "these theories are typically employed in the study of chiral transition , either for the discrete form of the symmetry , @xmath5 , or in the continuous form , @xmath6 .",
    "the general interest is to understand how the chiral transition pattern is affected by external control parameters such as the temperature ( @xmath7 ) and the chemical potential ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "it is also well known that , apart from these control parameters , the presence of an external magnetic field may impact significantly on the phase transition patterns .",
    "so far we have a reasonable understanding of how chiral symmetry is affected by @xmath7 , @xmath8 as well as by the presence of a magnetic field @xmath9 .",
    "mostly , this understanding is acquired at the mean - field level  @xcite for both the gn and the njl models .",
    "recently , the understanding of how an external @xmath9 field affects the symmetry aspects of these four - fermion theories turned out to be a question of general interest for the following reasons .",
    "first , the interaction of fermions with an external @xmath9 field is expected to be associated with phenomena such as the metal - to - insulating phase transition in semiconductors  @xcite , quantum hall effects  @xcite and the transport properties in superconductors  @xcite , just to mention a few phenomena in the context of condensed matter physics , while in the high energy physics domain the effects of a magnetic background is important to the physics of compact stellar objects @xcite , heavy - ion collisions at the relativistic heavy ion collider and at the lhc @xcite and in the physics of the early universe @xcite , which are situations where high intensity fields , @xmath10 , are expected to be present or produced ( for a recent review , see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) .    of topical interest is to understand how a magnetic field will affect phase transitions , since they can induce dynamical symmetry breaking , or magnetic catalysis  @xcite . within fermionic systems ,",
    "magnetic catalysis refers to the generation of a mass gap for the fermions at any finite interaction strength , leading explicitly to chiral symmetry breaking .    in this work",
    ", we apply the optimized perturbation theory ( opt ) @xcite ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for early works on this subject ) to the gn model in @xmath11 dimensions and investigate how dynamical chiral symmetry breaking ( csb ) is affected by the presence of a magnetic field , comparing our results with those obtained in the large-@xmath0 ( ln ) approximation , which is equivalent to the well known mean field approximation ( mfa ) .",
    "the opt has already established itself as a powerful method in dealing with critical theories .",
    "for example , in the bose  einstein condensation case this method and its different variations have provided some of the most precise analytical results for the shift in the critical temperature for weakly interacting homogeneous bose gases  @xcite .",
    "other applications to condensed matter situations include a precise evaluation of the critical density for polyacetylene @xcite . also , when extended by hard - thermal loops , the method was successful in predicting qcd thermodynamical properties at the three - loop level  @xcite",
    ". improved by the renormalization group , and inspired by similar properties  @xcite in the gross  neveu model , a variation of the opt has been recently used in the evaluation of @xmath12  @xcite and @xmath13  @xcite , where the stability and convergence at higher orders of this renormalization group opt form was demonstrated . for the present application",
    "it is worth mentioning that the opt was instrumental in the determination of the phase diagram of the massless gn model in 2 + 1 dimensions at finite @xmath7 and @xmath8 in the absence of magnetic fields  @xcite . in this case",
    ", the ln approximation predicts that the whole @xmath14 plane is dominated by a second - order phase transition , except at @xmath15 , where a first - order phase transition is predicted to occur .",
    "but , monte  carlo numerical simulations  @xcite have indicated that a first - order transition line should appear at the low-@xmath7 and high-@xmath8 region , terminating in a tricritical point at intermediate values of @xmath7 and @xmath8 . however , no precise location for this tricritical point was possible to be given .",
    "this situation has been changed when the complete phase diagram for the model was studied in the context of the opt method and the precise location of the tricritical point determined for any value of @xmath0  @xcite .",
    "the two - flavor njl model in @xmath16 dimensions with physical quark masses has also been treated with the opt at finite @xmath7 and @xmath8 in the absence of magnetic fields  @xcite .",
    "the main outcome was that the @xmath17 corrections brought in by this approximation generate the effects of a repulsive vector channel ( absent in the original lagrangian ) , which weakens the first - order transition line and locates the critical end point at temperature values that are smaller than the ones predicted by the ln approximation .",
    "a detailed discussion about the physical nature of the opt @xmath17 corrections in the simplified abelian njl model context was recently carried out in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in the massless gn model",
    ", the ln approximation predicts that the critical temperature , which signals that chiral symmetry has been restored through a second - order phase transition , increases with @xmath9 at vanishing fermionic densities .",
    "however , although the functional renormalization group technique  @xcite has been recently applied to analyze magnetic catalysis at zero temperatures and densities , we are not aware of evaluations that go beyond mean field at finite @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 in the context of the gn model in @xmath11 dimensions . in the present work",
    "we show that at @xmath18 the results obtained with the ln method and the opt agree from the qualitative point of view .",
    "namely , magnetic catalysis still takes place and the critical temperature rises with @xmath9 .",
    "however , at the other extreme of the phase diagram , when @xmath15 and @xmath19 , we find that the opt and the ln predict different qualitative and quantitative behaviors as far as the coexistence chemical potential @xmath20 is concerned .",
    "the differences are more pronounced for negative couplings ( @xmath21 ) , where the opt reproduces the phenomenon of inverse magnetic catalysis ( imc )  @xcite , which predicts the decrease of @xmath20 with increasing @xmath9 , even at large magnitude of magnetic fields .",
    "other qualitative differences happen in the region spanned by intermediate to high chemical potentials , where the opt adds terms of the form @xmath22 to the free energy , while only scalar condensates ( @xmath23 ) are considered within the ln approximation .",
    "then , depending on the sign of the four - fermion coupling @xmath2 and for sufficiently large values of the magnetic field , we observe the weakening ( @xmath24 ) or the enhancement ( @xmath4 ) of the entire csb region in the magnetized fermionic system .",
    "the opt also predicts that the value of @xmath20 ( at @xmath15 ) can be smaller than the tricritical point value ( @xmath25 ) , producing an important change in the shape of the phase diagram as compared to the one generated by taking @xmath26 .",
    "finally , we also discuss the possibility that the order parameter value suffers more than one discontinuity as @xmath8 increases when @xmath15 and @xmath9 is small .",
    "being observed by both approximations when @xmath3 , this feature is not an artifact of the ln approximation and can be easily explained by a close examination of the filling of the landau levels .    this paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we briefly review the planar gn four - fermion model within the opt formalism . in sec .",
    "[ sec3 ] we obtain the effective potential ( or free energy density ) , at first nontrivial order , which is adequate to treat a hot , dense and magnetized planar four - fermion system .",
    "next , in sec .",
    "[ sec4 ] we discuss how finite @xmath0 effects affect thermodynamical quantities such as the order parameter , the critical quantities and the overall shape of the phase diagram when a magnetic field is present .",
    "the results obtained from the opt are contrasted with those produced by the ln approximation in all the cases we have analyzed .",
    "finally , in sec .  [ sec5 ] , we give our concluding remarks .",
    "two appendices are also included to show and clarify some technical aspects .",
    "in the presence of an external electromagnetic potential @xmath27 , the gn model with fermions with @xmath0 flavors , @xmath28 ( @xmath29 ) , is described by the lagrangian density  @xcite    @xmath30    note that a summation over fermionic species is implicit in the above equation with , e.g. , @xmath31 . when @xmath32 , which is the case considered by us here , the theory is invariant under the discrete chiral symmetry ( cs ) transformation    @xmath33    with the gamma matrices being @xmath34 matrices and we follow the representation given , e.g. , in ref .",

    "@xcite , for example .",
    "any quantity computed from the above interpolated lagrangian density ( [ gndelta ] ) , at some finite order in @xmath39 , is dependent on the arbitrary mass parameter @xmath46 , which also serves as an infrared regulator .",

    "( [ pms ] ) must be a function of the original parameters , including the couplings , thus generating in that sense nonperturbative dependences in the coupling and other parameters of the model .",

    "<S> we find that some of the main qualitative changes induced by the opt finite @xmath0 corrections concern the region of intermediate to high chemical potentials where this approximation adds a term proportional to @xmath1 to the free energy . </S>",
    "<S> then , depending on the sign of @xmath2 ( relative to the critical coupling ) , and magnitude of the magnetic field , we observe a weakening ( when @xmath3 ) or enhancement ( when @xmath4 ) of the chiral broken region in the magnetized fermionic system . by comparing the results from the opt and the large-@xmath0 approximation , </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that finite @xmath0 effects favor the phenomenon of inverse magnetic catalysis when the coupling constant is negative . </S>",
    "<S> we show that with the opt the value of the coexistence chemical potential at vanishing temperature tends to decrease for large values of the magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> this is opposite to what is seen in the large-@xmath0 approximation , where for large magnetic fields the coexistence chemical potential starts again to increase . likewise , at finite temperature , the value of the chemical potential at the tricritical point also decreases with the magnetic field in the opt case . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , the shape of the phase diagrams predicted by the opt and by the large-@xmath0 approximation look very different in the presence of high magnetic fields . </S>",
    "<S> finally , for small values of magnetic field and temperature , we identify the presence of possible intermediate nonchiral phase transitions when varying the chemical potential . </S>",
    "<S> we show that these phenomena are not an artifact of the large-@xmath0 approximation and that they also occur within the opt framework . </S>",
    "<S> these intermediate transitions are interpreted to be a consequence of the de haas  </S>",
