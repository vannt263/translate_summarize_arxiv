    "are treated on the same footing as nuclear corrections@xcite , and we will call both types `` nuclear corrections . ''",
    "uncalculated qed terms of order @xmath3 in light atoms are almost certainly smaller than .1 ppm . , while the experimental errors are smaller still .",
    "this provides us with the unprecedented opportunity to study nuclear effects in the hyperfine structure ( hfs ) of light hydrogenic atoms , which range in size from tens to hundreds of ppm .",
    "we will restrict ourselves to hydrogenic s - states , because these states maximize nuclear effects .",

    "because nuclear effects have a much shorter range than atomic scales , we expect the splittings in the @xmath8 s - state to be proportional to @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the non - relativistic wave function of the electron . forming the fractional differences ( in parts per million ) between @xmath11 and @xmath12 ( times @xmath13 )",
    "leads to the tabulated results . as we stated above",
    ", these large differences reflect neither experimental errors nor uncertainties in the qed calculations , but rather the large nuclear contributions to hfs .    in order to perform a tractable calculation",
    "it is necessary to restrict the scope , while at the same time incorporating the dominant physics . to accomplish this we borrow a technique from chiral perturbation theory ( @xmath14pt , the effective field theory for nuclei based on qcd )",
    "this technique , called power counting , is the organizing principle of @xmath14pt and allows one to perform systematic expansions@xcite in powers of a small parameter , @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is a typical nuclear momentum scale that can be taken to be roughly the pion mass ( @xmath17 140 mev ) , and @xmath18 is the large - mass qcd scale ( @xmath19 1 gev ) typical of qcd bound states such as the nucleon , heavy mesons , nucleon resonances , etc .",
    "we also note that @xmath20 specifies a typical correlation length ( and a reasonable nearest - neighbor distance ) in light nuclei ( @xmath19 1.4 fm)@xcite .",
    "this expansion in powers of @xmath21 should converge moderately well . in this work",
    "we restrict ourselves to leading order in this expansion , and this restriction eliminates nuclear corrections of relativistic order , which are subleading and exceptionally complicated because of the complexity of the nuclear force@xcite .    in processes that involve virtual excitation of intermediate nuclear states ( each with its own energy , @xmath22 , relative to the ground - state energy , @xmath23 ) the excitation energy @xmath24 is of order @xmath25 and typically is a correction to the leading order@xcite .",
    "consistency therefore demands that we drop such terms .",

    "these are very considerable simplifications in constructing the nuclear contribution to hfs , which we present in the next section .",
    "the hyperfine interactions that interest us are simple ( effective ) couplings of the electron spin to the nuclear ( ground - state ) spin : @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the electron ( pauli ) spin operator and @xmath30 is the nuclear spin ( total angular momentum ) operator .",
    "other couplings of the electron spin are possible and either generate no hyperfine splitting , none in s - states , or higher - order ( in @xmath2 ) contributions .    the lowest - order ( fermi ) hyperfine interaction is generated by the interaction of the electron current with the magnetic dipole part ( determined by @xmath31 ) of the nuclear current .",
    "a simple calculation gives the well - known result@xcite @xmath32 where @xmath33 defines the nuclear magnetic moment and @xmath34 is the electron mass .",
    "the factor of @xmath35 leads to a hyperfine splitting proportional to @xmath36 .",
    "all additional contributions will be measured as a fraction of this energy .    naively calculating the higher - order ( in @xmath2 ) corrections using",
    "only the nuclear magnetization distribution will fail .",
    "the atomic wave function is modified by the nuclear charge distribution in precisely the same region that the magnetization distribution is nonvanishing@xcite .",
    "it is therefore necessary to incorporate the complete set of second - order ( in perturbation theory in @xmath2 ) processes shown in fig  ( 1 ) , which comprise the nuclear compton amplitude coupled to the electron compton amplitude .",
    "only the forward - scattering part of this amplitude is required for the @xmath37 corrections to @xmath1 .",
    "the resulting energy shift is then given by @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the electron compton amplitude and @xmath40 is the nuclear compton amplitude , which is required to be gauge invariant .",

    "the explicit form for the remaining term in @xmath49 ( suppressing the nuclear ground - state expectation value ) , which involves a complete sum over intermediate states , @xmath50 , is given by @xmath51 where @xmath52 and @xmath53 are the fourier transforms of the nuclear current and charge operators .",

    "the constant term does not contribute because of the derivative .",
    "the second term is only logarithmically divergent when siegert s theorem is applied@xcite , can be shown to vanish in several limits ( including the zero - range limit ) , and is consequently negligibly small@xcite .",
    "the last term is the one we are seeking and was originally developed by low@xcite in a limiting case for the deuteron , after the basic concept was sketched by bohr@xcite : @xmath64 a more convenient representation can be obtained by dividing both sides of this equation by the expression for the fermi hyperfine energy given by eqn .",

    "in order to evaluate eqn .  ( 10 ) it is necessary to assume a form for the nuclear charge and current operators .",
    "we have agreed to ignore terms of relativistic order , and this eliminates all but the usual impulse - approximation ( i.e. , one - body ) terms for the charge operator , which contains finite - size distributions for the protons and neutrons .",
    "although the latter contributions are small , they have never been included in previous calculations and we will gauge their importance by including them in our calculation .",
    "the nuclear current operator can be written in terms of the dominant spin - magnetization current , the convection current ( motional current of charged particles ) and meson - exchange currents ( mec ) .",
    "isoscalar mec are of relativistic order@xcite and we ignore them .",
    "isovector mec are larger , but do nt contribute to the deuteron because it is an isoscalar nucleus .",
    "isovector mec will contribute to the trinucleon systems , where the effect of this current on the isovector magnetic moment is about the same size ( 15% ) as our expansion parameter@xcite .",
    "because parts of these currents ( in particular the isobar part ) are difficult to treat quantitatively and because of their relative smallness , we will ignore mec in calculating the low moments in this initial effort to understand hfs in the trinucleon systems .",
    "each of the charge and current operators that we use are therefore given by sums of one - body operators , and their resulting product in the low - moment expression in eqn .",

( 11 ) are generators of su(4 ) symmetry , and it is conventional@xcite to decompose the wave functions of light nuclei with respect to that symmetry , which plays a significant role in understanding those systems . the dominant wave function component for the trinucleon systems ( the s - state @xmath92 ) is the product of a completely symmetric space wave function with a completely antisymmetric spin - isospin wave function .",

    "the d - wave components tend to have the spin and orbital components anti - aligned , and this accounts for the sign of the @xmath98 term . in @xmath5he the two protons tend to have their spins oppositely aligned , which accounts for the small @xmath5he low moment . in the limit of exact su(4 ) symmetry",
    "only the s - state contributes and the @xmath5he one - body term vanishes .",

    "the two protons in @xmath5he have their spins anti - aligned in the su(4 ) limit , and this cancellation leads to a small net result for the one - body part .",
    "the protons in h and @xmath5h make comparable one - body contributions , since the proton in @xmath5h carries the entire spin in the su(4 ) limit .",
    "the two - body terms that couple the neutron charge and the proton magnetic moment are suppressed for the reason discussed above .",
    "in addition the two - body convection current has no contribution from the dominant s - state and is therefore negligible for hydrogen isotopes , where one ( charged ) nucleon must be a neutron . only for the two protons in @xmath5he",
    "is this interaction non - negligible , but still small . in @xmath5h",
    "the neutron spins are anti - aligned in the su(4 ) limit , which suppresses the normally dominant proton charge  neutron magnetic moment contribution to about 20% of the one - body part . in @xmath5he",
