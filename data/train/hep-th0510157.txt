    "in this work we explore the concept of covariant quantum propagator written down in terms of light front coordinates and obtain the propagator and green s function in the light - front for a time interval @xmath2 where @xmath3 , is the light - front time . in principle , this is equivalent to the canonical quantization in the light front @xcite .",
    "kogut and soper @xcite also makes use of this way of constructing quantities in the light front : starting with @xmath4-dimensional amplitudes or equations , they integrate over @xmath5 , which plays the role of energy  and corresponds to processes described by amplitudes or equations in time  @xmath2 . with this ,",
    "the relative time between particles disappear and only the global propagation of intermediate state is allowed .",
    "the global propagation of the intermediate state is the time  translation of the physical system between two instants @xmath2 and @xmath6 .",
    "we specifically consider the case of two scalar bosons propagating forward in time .",
    "it has already been shown that for this case we can have exchange of two intermediate bosons via ladder diagrams or crossed ladder diagrams .",
    "for the ladder diagram we do not observe any new features , but for the crossed ladder diagram we have a crucial contribution coming from the other fock space sector corresponding to the pair production .",
    "this is in fact a contribution that can be intuitively expected from the very nature of the crossed diagram , but that has never been noticed before or even considered .",
    "it is in this diagram that we can see manifestly the non - triviality of the light - front vacuum without any external perturbating field acting on the propagating bosons .",
    "we have already demonstrated that the non - trivial light - front vacuum also does manifest in the propagation of two scalar bosons when one of them is perturbed by an exernal background electromagnetic field @xcite .    in classical mechanics ( cm )",
    ", we characterize the state of a physical system by a point in the four dimensional space - time , @xmath7 , where @xmath8 with @xmath9 and @xmath10 are respectively the space and the time coordinates .",
    "if we parametrize the time coordinate , we can describe the same system in the phase space @xmath11 , with @xmath12 indicating collectively the degrees of freedom for such a system and @xmath13 their respective conjugate momenta .",
    "time evolution of the system is then described by a line either in the space - time or in the phase space @xmath14 which represents the set of values for all degrees of freedom and respective conjugate momenta at a given instant of time @xmath10 .",
    "this time evolution is generated by hamilton s equation . in this strictly deterministic theory ,",
    "the state of the system at a given time is fixed by the initial conditions , as for example , at @xmath15 .    in quantum mechanics ( qm ) , or wave mechanics ,",
    "on the other hand , the state of a system is characterized by the wave function @xmath16 , and its evolution is governed by schrdinger s equation .",
    "the wave function must be known at each point of the space - time @xmath17 , so that it requires a continuous infinite values to be described , with the wave function taking the role of a field .    in a scattering process",
    "we have a wave function @xmath18 , where we fix the initial conditions at @xmath15 , coming into a point which has a force field or a particle , so that the typical question that arises is : which is the wave function representation @xmath16 after the interaction with the scattering center ?    in order to answer this question , we use the generalized huygens principle @xcite . if a wave function @xmath16 is known at a given time @xmath10 , it is acceptable to assume that the wave function @xmath19 that emerges from the scattering centre located at @xmath17 and propagates from position @xmath20 to @xmath21 in a time @xmath22 , be proportional to the amplitude of the wave function @xmath16 .",
    "the proportionality contant is defined as @xmath23 , so that we have in a mathematical notation : @xmath24 where @xmath25 .",
    "here @xmath26 defined at position @xmath27 and time @xmath28 is the wave function that emerges from the scattering centre .",
    "the quantity @xmath29 is called the green s function or propagator @xcite . knowing this @xmath30 means to solve completely the scattering problem . in other words , knowing the green s function is equivalent to solving of the schrdinger s equation .",
    "now , is it possible to describe a physical system in any space - time hypersurface with initial conditions defined in a hypersurface different from @xmath15 ?",
    "the answer to this question is positive and it was given long ago in @xmath31 by dirac @xcite . in his work , he proposes three distinct forms that could describe the dynamics of relativistic systems , two of which do not use time to describe the dynamical properties of simple systems .",
    "these different forms received different names : instant , point and front forms .",
    "the instant form is the usual relativistic dynamics described in terms of boundary conditions set at @xmath15 while the front form uses the hyperplane of minkowski space that contains the trajectory of light ( light - cone ) .",
    "the propagation of a free particle with spin zero in four dimensional space - time is represented by the covariant feynman propagator @xmath32where the coordinate @xmath33 represents the time and @xmath34 the energy .",
    "we are going to calculate this propagation in the light front , that is , for times @xmath2 .    a point in the four - dimensional space - time",
    "is defined by the set of numbers @xmath35 , where @xmath33 is the time coordinate and @xmath36 is the three - dimensional vector with space coordinates @xmath37 , @xmath38 e @xmath39 .",
    "observe that we adopt here the usual convention to take the speed of light as @xmath40 .    in the light front , time and",
    "space coordinates are mixed up and we define the new coordinates as follows : @xmath41 where @xmath42 and @xmath43 are unit vectors in the direction of @xmath20 and @xmath44 coordinates respectively .",
    "the null plane is defined by @xmath45 , that is , this condition defines a hyperplane that is tangent to the light - cone , the reason why many authors call the hypersurface simply by light - cone .",
    "the initial boundary conditions for the dynamics in the light front are defined on this hyperplane .",
    "the axis @xmath2 is perpendicular to the plane @xmath46 .",
    "therefore a displacement of such hyperplane for @xmath47 is analogous to the displacement of a plane in @xmath15 to @xmath48 of the four - dimensional space - time . with this analogy ,",
    "we recognize @xmath2 as the time in the null plane .",
    "we make the projection of the propagator for a boson in time associated to the null plane rewriting the coordinates in terms of time coordinate @xmath2 and the position coordinates @xmath49 and @xmath50 . with these , the momenta are given by @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath51 , and therefore we have @xmath52the jacobian of the transformation @xmath34 , @xmath53 is equal to @xmath54 and @xmath1 , @xmath55 are momentum operators .    evaluating the fourier transform",
    ", we obtain @xmath56 where we have used @xmath57 and the property of dirac s delta `` function '' @xmath58 and we get @xmath59 which describes the propagation of a particle forward to the future and of an antiparticle backwards to the past .",
    "this can be oberved by the denominator which hints us that for @xmath47 and @xmath60 we have the particle propagating forward in time of the null plane . on the other hand , for @xmath61 and @xmath62 we have an antiparticle propagating backwards in time .",
    "the green funtion in the light front @xmath63 acting in the fock space is defined as the probability amplitude of the transition from the initial state in the fock space @xmath64 to the final state @xmath65 .",
    "its fourier transform is sometimes called resolvent for a given hamiltonian @xcite , however , here we call simply fourier transform for the green function or even green function itself .    in the case of a free boson , the green function for the propagation of a particle is defined by the operator @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the energy of the particle . for the antiparticle propagation",
    ", we have : @xmath68    we can see that the difference between the green functions in ( [ 2.7 ] ) and ( [ 2.8 ] ) for the propagator in the light front is the absence of the imaginary ( complex ) number @xmath69 and of the factor of phase space @xmath1 which appears in ( [ 2.6 ] ) .    the operator defined by ( [ 2.7 ] ) is the green function of @xmath70    the feynman propagator is then rewritten as : @xmath71",
    "our aim in this chapter is to study the two body green function in the `` ladder '' approximation for the dynamics defined in the light front . within this treatment",
    ", we are not going to deal with perturbative corrections that can be decomposed into one body problem .",
    "our interest is to define in the light front , the interaction between two bodies mediated by the interchange of a particle and obtain the correction to the two body green function originated in this interaction .    for this purpose",
    ", we use a bosonic model for which the interaction lagrangian is defined as : @xmath72where the bosons @xmath73 and @xmath74 have equal mass @xmath75 and the intermediate boson , @xmath76 , has the mass @xmath77 .",
    "the coupling constant is @xmath78 .",
    "taking from dirac s idea @xcite of representing the dynamics of a quantum system in the light front in time @xmath79 , we derive in this chapter the two body green function or covariant propagator which describes the evolution of the system from a hypersurface @xmath80 to another one .",
    "the green function in the light front is the probability amplitude for a initial state in @xmath45 evolving to a final state in @xmath81 , where the evolution operator is defined by the hamiltonian in the light front @xcite .",
    "sometimes we call the resolvent @xmath82 as the green function , too @xcite .    the two body",
    "green function in the light front includes the propagation of intermediate states with any number of particles .",
    "we start our discussion evaluating the second order correction to the coupling constant associated with the propagator .",
    "we define the matrix element for the interaction and so we obtain the correction to the green function in the light front",
    ". then we evaluate the correction to the green function to the fourth order in the coupling constant , where we use the technique of factorizing the energy denominators , which is important to identify the global propagation of four bodies after the integration in the energies @xmath0 .",
    "we discuss the generalization of this technique .",
    "we show how to get the non perturbative green function from the set of hierarchical equations for the green function in the ladder  approximation .",
    "this corresponds to the truncation of the fock space in the light front , such that , only states with two bosons @xmath73 and @xmath74 are allowed , with no restriction as to the number of intermediate bosons @xmath76 .",
    "we discuss how to build a systematic approximation to the kernel of the integral equation for the two body green function as a function of the number of particles in the intermediate fock state and the power in the coupling constant .",
    "a consistent truncation can be carried out and in the lowest order , this brings to the weinberg s equation for the bound state @xcite .",
    "the propagator for the diagrams in interaction can be obtained of the functional generator ( [ green2 ] ) and the are shown in the next sections .",
    "the perturbative correction to the propagator of two bodies in @xmath83 comes from the interchange of a virtual intermediate boson , given by : @xmath84    the propagator of a particle @xmath85 is defined in ( [ 2.2 ] ) .",
    "the intermediate boson @xmath76 propagates between @xmath86 and @xmath87 .",
    "the indices @xmath88 and @xmath89 in the particle propagators label initial states whereas @xmath90 and @xmath4 do so for the final states .",
    "in this section , we evaluate the perturbative correction to the propagator of two bosons up to the fourth order in the coupling constant , using the same method of the previous section.this corresction to the propagator constains terms obtained from the iteration of the bethe - salpeter equation in the `` ladder '' approximation up to the second order .",
    "as we have a correction for the two boson propagator to the fourth order in the coupling constant , we have eigth propagators in the ladder  diagram , two of which are propagators of the boson associated with the interation , identified as @xmath91 e @xmath92 . we also make use of a lower index to define the particle momenta that propagate .",
    "the perturbative correction to the feynman propagator for two bodies up to order @xmath93 in the `` ladder '' approximation is given by : @xmath94    each propagator of the previous expression , is defined by ( [ 2.2 ] ) .",
    "therefore we substitute them in ( [ 3.11 ] ) and integrate in @xmath95 and @xmath96 . with this , there emerges four dirac deltas in @xmath97 , which correspond to the conservation of @xmath0 in each vertex .",
    "so with these , eliminating four integrations in @xmath0 , we are left with an exponencial @xmath98 .",
    "evaluating the fourier transform and integrating in @xmath2 , this exponencial makes up another dirac delta which later on , when performing integration in @xmath99 results in the law of energy conservation for the system , given by , @xmath100where @xmath101 and @xmath102 are light front energies for the final state particles and @xmath103 and @xmath104 for the initial ones .",
    "we note that in this ladder diagram there is no pair production and the two fock spaces remain separate ; the vacuum is trivial .",
    "this diagram brings about a new feature which was not present in the previous diagram just considered .",
    "here we come across not only with all those diagrams that involve the propagation of information to future times , but note one particular diagram that bears pair production , i.e. , there is one diagram which has intrinsic propagation of information to the past , thus mingling the two sectorized fock spaces of solutions .",
    "this diagram , as far as we known , has not being considered in the literature before .",
    "the correction to the two boson propagator coming from the process of two `` crossed '' @xmath76 bosons is represented by the feynman diagram depicted in figure ( [ f4.1a ] ) .",
    "explicitly this correction to the propagator is written down in terms of the one boson propagators and is given by the following equation@xmath105and after fourier transform we have    @xmath106    for @xmath107 , the regions of integration in @xmath108 which define the position of poles in the complex @xmath109 are :    \\a ) @xmath110    \\b ) @xmath111    \\c ) @xmath112",
    "\\d ) @xmath113    \\e ) @xmath114    \\f ) @xmath115    for regions @xmath116  and @xmath117  we use the method of partial fracioning twice to integrate in @xmath109 @xcite ; for @xmath118 , @xmath119 , @xmath120  and @xmath121  this is not necessary ; for regions @xmath120  and @xmath121  the integration in @xmath109 vanishes .",
    "the diagrams for each of these regions are shown in figure ( f4.2a ) .",
    "after performing the analytic integrations in @xmath122 and @xmath123 we have @xmath124where @xmath125and @xmath126 ,   \\label{5c}\\]]shown in figures ( [ f4.2a]a ) and ( [ f4.2a]b ) respectively .    regions @xmath116  and @xmath127  contribute to the propagator correction as @xmath128where    @xmath129    the perturbative correction to the two boson propagator in eq.([6c ] ) is represented by diagrams indicated in figure ( [ f4.2a]c ) .",
    "the correction represented by diagrams in figure ( [ f4.2a]d ) is given by : @xmath130 .",
    "\\label{8c}\\ ] ]      next we deduce the antiparticle contribution to the crossed ladder diagram .",
    "this contribution happens for @xmath131 and @xmath132 .",
    "let us analyse the first case , @xmath133    the region for the @xmath134 component momentum that allows the pole positioned in both hemispheres of the complex @xmath109 plane , and therefore giving non - vanishing residue , are @xmath135 and @xmath136 .",
    "so , the result for the momentum integration in @xmath137 component for @xmath138 and @xmath139 which correspond to the non - vanishing results for integrations in @xmath0 and @xmath123 for @xmath140 , is given by the diagram depicted in figure ( [ f12a ] ) and the result is given in ( [ 9c ] ) :    @xmath141+[k\\rightarrow k - k , q\\rightarrow k - q]+[k\\rightarrow k - q , q\\rightarrow k - k ] ,   \\notag\\end{aligned}\\]]where @xmath142    the four body propagator , @xmath143  ( subindex @xmath118 for antiparticle ) has a propagation to past in the null - plane of an antiparticle with @xmath131 . at instant",
    "@xmath144 the pair particle - antiparticle is produced by the @xmath76 intermediate boson , then the antiparticle encounters a particle of momentum @xmath60 , and is anihilated and the production of a @xmath76 boson with momentum @xmath145 which continues to propagate into the future of the null - plane .",
    "in our previous work we have demonstrated the pair production in the propagation of two scalar bosons in which one of them interacts with an external electromagnetic field . there",
    ", the propagation of a single boson interacting with the external field does not produce pair since this event is isolated ; the second propagating boson which is the  `` spectator '' boson ( the one that sees the event happening ) is crucial to the process to occur .    in the case of the ladder diagrams , the usual one does not produce pair too ; only the crossed ladder diagram does .",
    "this is due to the fact that propagating intermediate bosons in crossed ladder diagrams has to have null - plane time ordered operators linked with causality playing its crucial role .",
    "one very important observation that we pinpoint here is that in the light - front dynamics , the light - front coordinates @xmath2 and @xmath146 are not simple @xmath147 rotation of the usual four - dimensional space - time coordinates @xmath33 and @xmath148 .",
    "it is rather a rotation constrained by the condition of light - likeness of the vector , i.e. , @xmath149 , which renders the components @xmath2 and @xmath146 as being not linearly independent components ; they do not serve as base vectors to generate the four - dimensional space - time .",
    "moreover in the momentum integration , @xmath1 and @xmath0 we have the same linearly dependence , here the difference being that the dispersion relation is the constraint , either @xmath150 for massless particles or @xmath151 for massive particles ( relation known as the einstein relation ) .",
    "we believe that most of the ( if not all of them ... ) pathologies emerging in the light - front treatment of the physical processes up to now have been plagued by this simple misunderstanding and lack of perception .",
    "our calculation has also been victimized by this lack of perception before . in reviewing the pathological behaviour of the process , for which no physical argumentation has been proposed to cure it , we were led to analyse more carefully the constraint defined by the dispersion relation . from it emerged the paradigm that in the light - front energy @xmath0 and longitudinal momentum component @xmath1 are bound together in their signs ; whether positive or negative , both of them bear the same sign as the other one . however , when we split the two and write energy in terms of momentum components , the longitudinal  `` @xmath152 ' ' -component of the momentum is carrying relevant physical information which can be lost by treating them as independent variables - which they certainly are not .    it is because of the above referred paradigm that up to now , most of the calculations done in the light front have always neglected or omitted the relevant contributions of the fock space defined by the other sector , namely , the region of negative @xmath153",
    "using the concept of generating functional @xmath154 $ ] , or vacuum - vacuum transition amplitude in the presence of an external source @xmath155 , we write : @xmath156 & = & \\int \\mathcal{d}\\phi \\exp \\left\\ { i\\int d^{4}x\\left [   \\pounds \\left ( \\phi \\right ) + j\\left ( x\\right ) + \\frac{i\\varepsilon } { 2}\\phi % \\right ] \\right\\ }   \\label{3.1.1 } \\\\ &",

    "using now the identity : @xmath159substituting this expression above into the lagrangean ( [ 3.1.2 ] ) which must be integrated over @xmath160 to calculate the generating functional . in this integration ,",
