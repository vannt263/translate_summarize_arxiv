    "the minimal supergravity ( msugra ) model@xcite is a well - motivated supersymmetric model with a small parameter space that forms a template for many investigations of the phenomenological consequences of weak scale supersymmetry . in msugra",
    ", it is assumed that the minimal supersymmetric standard model , or mssm , is a valid effective theory of physics between the energy scales @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "it is further assumed that all mssm scalar masses unify to a common value @xmath13 at @xmath14 , while gauginos unify to a common value @xmath15 and trilinear soft terms unify to a common value @xmath16 .",
    "the weak scale soft parameters can be calculated by renormalization group evolution from @xmath14 to @xmath17 .",
    "the large value of the top quark yukawa coupling drives the up - higgs squared mass to negative values , leading to radiative electroweak symmetry breaking ( ewsb ) .",
    "the ewsb minimization conditions allow one to trade the bilinear soft breaking term @xmath18 for @xmath19 , the ratio of higgs field vevs .",
    "it also determines the magnitude ( but not the sign ) of the superpotential higgs mass term @xmath20 .",
    "thus , the entire weak scale sparticle mass spectrum and mixings can be calculated from the well - known parameter set m_0 ,  m_1/2 ,  a_0 ,  ,  sign ( ) .",
    "thus , once this parameter set is stipulated , a whole host of observables , including the neutralino dark matter relic density @xmath21 and collider scattering events , may be calculated . for implementation",
    ", we use isajet v7.74@xcite to calculate the sparticle mass spectrum and associated collider events , and isared@xcite to calculate the neutralino relic density .",
    "one of the important consequences of the mssm , due to @xmath22-parity conservation , is that the lightest susy particle ( lsp ) is absolutely stable . in msugra ,",
    "the lsp is usually found to be the lightest neutralino @xmath23 , which is a weakly interacting massive particle ( wimp ) , and hence has the potential to naturally match the measured abundance of cold dark matter in the universe .",
    "an analysis of the three - year wmap and galaxy survey data sets @xcite implies that the ratio of dark matter density to critical density , _ _",
    "1h^2__1/_c = 0.111^+0.011_-0.015  ( 2 ) .",
    "where @xmath24 is the hubble constant . by comparing the msugra predicted value of @xmath21 to this measured value",
    ", one finds that only certain parts of the msugra parameter space are cosmologically allowed .",
    "these include the following .",
    "the bulk region at low @xmath13 and low @xmath15 , where neutralino annihilation is enhanced by light @xmath25-channel",
    "slepton exchange@xcite .",
    "the tight wmap @xmath26 limit has pushed this allowed region to very small @xmath13 and @xmath15 values , while lep2 limits on @xmath27 and @xmath28 ( and possibly on @xmath29 ) have excluded these same low values so that almost no bulk region has survived@xcite .",
    "the stau co - annihilation region occurs at very low @xmath13 but any @xmath15 values , so that @xmath30 , and neutralinos can annihilate against tau sleptons@xcite in the early universe . for certain @xmath16 values which dial @xmath31 to very low values",
    ", there also exists a top - squark co - annihilation region@xcite .",
    "the @xmath32-funnel region occurs at large values of the parameter @xmath33 , where @xmath34 , and neutralinos can annihilate through the broad pseudoscalar higgs resonance@xcite .",
    "there is also a light higgs resonance region where @xmath35 at low @xmath15 values@xcite .",
    "at large @xmath13 near the boundary of parameter space , the superpotential higgsino mass term @xmath20 becomes quite small , and the @xmath23 can become a mixed higgsino - bino neutralino . this region is known as the hyperbolic branch / focus point region ( hb / fp)@xcite . in this case ,",
    "neutralino annihilation to vector bosons is enhanced , and a match to the wmap measured relic density can be found .    the hb / fp region of msugra is especially compelling .",
    "in this region , the large value of @xmath36 several tev means that possible susy contributions to various flavor - changing and @xmath37-violating processes are suppressed by the large squark and slepton masses .",
    "for instance , susy contributions to the flavor - violating decay @xmath38 are small , so in the hb / fp region this decay rate is predicted to be in accord with sm predictions , as observed .",
    "meanwhile , the calculated amount of fine - tuning in the electroweak sector has been shown to be small@xcite , in spite of the presence of multi - tev top squarks .    in this paper",
    ", we examine the hb / fp region with regard to what sort of collider events are expected at the cern lhc @xmath39 collider , which is set to begin operating in the near future at a center - of - mass energy @xmath40 tev .",
    "much previous work on this issue has been done . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the reach of the lhc in the msugra model , including the hb / fp region , was calculated .",
    "the reach for 100 fb@xmath4 was found to extend to @xmath41 gev , corresponding to a reach in @xmath42 of about 1.8 tev .",
    "the reaches of @xmath43 and 1 tev @xmath44 linear colliders were also calculated@xcite , and found to extend past that of the lhc , since when @xmath20 becomes small , charginos become light , and chargino pair production is a reaction that @xmath44 colliders are sensitive to , essentially up to the kinematic limit for chargino pair production .",
    "in fact , the reach of the fermilab tevatron for susy in the clean trilepton channel@xcite is somewhat enhanced in the hb / fp region@xcite , since charginos and neutralinos can be quite light , and decay with characteristic dilepton mass edges .",
    "the reaches of direct@xcite and indirect@xcite dark matter search experiments are also enhanced in the hb / fp region .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , hinchliffe and paige examined characteristic measurements that the lhc could make for an msugra sample point nearby to the hb / fp region .",
    "they found a good signal / background ratio could be obtained with a hard cut on effective mass @xmath45 ( e.g. @xmath46 gev ) and by requiring the presence of a @xmath0-jet .",
    "some characteristic distributions such as @xmath47 which gave a dilepton mass edge at @xmath5 and @xmath48 ( indicating the presence of a @xmath25-quark in the decay chain ) could be made .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , mizukoshi , mercadante and tata found that the lhc reach in the hb / fp region could be enhanced by up to 20% by requiring events with the presence of one or two tagged @xmath0-jets . in ref .",
    "@xcite , a model - independent exploration of the hb / fp region was made with regard to collider and dark matter signals .",
    "the lhc reach via multilepton cascade decays was compared to the lhc reach via clean trileptons from @xmath49 production . in the latter process",
    ", backgrounds from @xmath50 and @xmath51 were calculated , and the trilepton reach was found to be comparable to but slightly smaller than the reach via a search for gluino cascade decays . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the authors examined what sort of cosmological measurements could be made in several msugra case studies ( including the point gev , @xmath52 gev , @xmath53 , @xmath54 gev and @xmath55 . ] lcc2 in the hb / fp region ) by measurements at the lhc and a @xmath43 and 1 tev ilc .",
    "for lcc2 at the lhc , they assumed the @xmath56 and @xmath57 mass edges could be measured to an accuracy of 1 gev , while it was conjectured that @xmath42 and @xmath58 could be measured to @xmath59 accuracy via some kinematic distributions .    in this paper , in anticipation of the lhc turn on",
    ", we wish to understand many of the characteristics of collider events expected in the hb / fp region , with an eye towards sparticle mass measurements rather than reach studies .",
    "we find that the expected collider events in the hb / fp region separate themselves into a hard component , arising from gluino pair production , and a soft component , arising from pair production of charginos and neutralinos .",
    "the gluino pair production events typically involve lengthy cascade decays to top and bottom quarks @xcite , and so high jet , @xmath0-jet and isolated lepton multiplicities are expected",
    ". however , the complex cascade decays do not lend themselves to simple kinematic measurements of the gluino or neutralino masses , mainly due to the combinatorics of picking out the correct gluino decay products with @xmath60 at parameter point sps1a . ] .",
    "we do find that the gluino mass should be extractable based on total rate in the multi - jet+multi - lepton@xmath61 events to a precision of about 5 - 10% for 100 fb@xmath4 of integrated luminosity .",
    "for both the hard and soft components , the @xmath56 and @xmath57 mass edges should be visible .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : fp ] , we present details of sparticle masses and cross sections expected from the hb / fp region at the lhc . in sec . [",
    "sec : evgen ] , we present some details of our signal and background calculations . in sec .",
    "[ sec : dist ] we present distributions for a variety of collider observables for a case study and sm backgrounds .",
    "we present a set of cuts that allows good separation of signal vs. background over a large range of @xmath42 values . in sec .",
    "[ sec : results ] , we show expected signal - to - background plots for gluino pair production and discuss how these can be used to extract a measurement of the gluino mass . in sec .",
    "[ sec : leps ] , we address leptonic signals .",
    "we conclude in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclude ] .",
    "in the msugra model , for a given set of gut scale soft susy breaking ( ssb ) masses , the associated weak scale values may be computed via renormalization group ( rg ) evolution @xcite .",
    "once the weak scale ssb terms have been obtained , then the scalar potential must be minimized to determine if electroweak symmetry is properly broken .",
    "while one ewsb condition allows the bilinear parameter @xmath18 to be traded for @xmath19 , the other condition reads ( at one - loop ) ^2 = - , [ eq : ewsb ] which determines the magnitude of the superpotential @xmath20 parameter .",
    "thus , one condition that ewsb is successfully broken is that a positive value of @xmath62 has been generated . roughly , if all the soft parameters entering eq .",
    "[ eq : ewsb ] are of order @xmath63 , then naturalness is satisfied , and the model is not fine - tuned .    for a fixed value of the parameter @xmath15 in the msugra model ,",
    "if @xmath13 is taken to be of order the weak scale , then @xmath64 is driven to negative values at the weak scale owing to the push from the large top quark yukawa coupling in the rges . however ,",
    "if @xmath13 is taken too large , then the gut scale value of @xmath64 is so high that it is not driven to negative values when the weak scale is reached in rg running , and a positive value of @xmath62 can not be found .",
    "intermediate to these two extreme cases must exist a region where @xmath62 is found to be zero , which forms the large @xmath13 edge of parameter space . if @xmath62 is positive , but tiny , then extremely light higgsino - like charginos will be generated , in conflict with bounds from lep2 ,",
    "which require @xmath65 gev . if @xmath62 is large enough to evade lep2 limits , then large higgsino - bino mixing occurs in the chargino and neutralino sectors , and in fact the lightest neutralino becomes a mixed higgsino - bino dark matter particle .",
    "a lightest neutralino of mixed higgsino - bino form has a large annihilation rate to vector bosons in the early universe , and hence may have a dark matter relic density in accord with wmap measurements",
    ". in this region , dubbed the hyperbolic branch / focus point region , multi - tev squark and slepton masses can co - exist with low fine - tuning as dictated by eq .",
    "[ eq : ewsb ] .",
    "thus , the hb / fp region is characterized by tev - scale squark and slepton masses , which are useful for suppressing possible fcnc or cp - violating processes , low fine - tuning , and a dark matter relic density in accord with wmap . given these qualities , it is important to investigate what hb / fp supersymmetry events would look like at the lhc collider and what sort of mass measurements could be made in this region .",
    ".points in the hb / fp region that yield a relic density @xmath66 .",
    "common values of @xmath67 , @xmath68 , @xmath69 and @xmath70 gev are assumed .",
    "the gluino mass in gev and its anticipated measurement uncertainty at the lhc are also given .",
    "the total gluino width is given in mev . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     a further consideration is to ask how well we really know our background estimates . at this stage ,",
    "the answer is difficult to know , and depends on several factors , including how well the selected event generator , isajet , models sm backgrounds .",
    "if indeed @xmath71 production is the dominant bg , then the plethora of @xmath71 events produced at the lhc will allow detailed study of this reaction , so that the distributions will be well - known from data .",
    "better theory modeling such as inclusion of exact matrix elements for extra jet radiation@xcite will also help .",
    "likewise , it can be expected that @xmath72 , @xmath73 and qcd backgrounds will also be well - studied , and the high @xmath74 and high @xmath75 tails will be better known due to actual collider measurements . in any case , we try to make a rough estimate by simply assuming that our event generator background is known to @xmath76 .",
    "we add and subtract this bg uncertainty to our theory curves in fig .",
    "[ fig : sigmgl ] , with the resultant band being denoted by orange dashed lines .    at this point",
    ", we can try to estimate the precision with which the gluino mass can be extracted from total cross section measurements .",
    "we show in fig .",
    "[ fig : sigmgl ] as data points the error bars expected from measuring the total cross section after cuts c2 with an assumed 100 fb@xmath4 of integrated luminosity ( red data points ) .",
    "a simple estimate of the uncertainty can be gained from the intersection of the upper and lower limits on the statistical cross section measurement with the band of theory uncertainty . using this method",
    ", we find that points 2 - 6 yield a gluino mass measured in the range of @xmath1 , as shown in table [ tab : fppoints ] .",
    "the precision will increase or decrease depending on the ultimate uncertainty ascribed to the bg by the experimental groups .",
    "it would also decrease if an nnlo computation of gluino pair production is made .",
    "note that even if the statistical error bars drop to zero ( infinite integrated luminosity ) , the theory uncertainty still gives @xmath77% uncertainty .",
    "fp1 which is below the lep2 excluded boundary is difficult to measure because the projected theory curves level off for lower values of @xmath42 .",
    "this is just a result of the fact that we optimized cuts in the 1 tev @xmath42 region .",
    "a better optimization with softer cuts would need to be performed to extract these lower gluino masses . for @xmath78 gev",
    ", another optimization would be needed with harder cuts",
    ". here , the absolute gluino pair event rate is dropping , so we expect a rate - based measurement of @xmath42 would be more challenging and perhaps not feasible in this higher mass region .",
    "while the analysis in sec .",
    "[ sec : results ] focussed on lepton - inclusive signals , it is also useful to make use of the isolated lepton content of the signal . we expect events containing multiple isolated leptons to have somewhat reduced jet multiplicity compared to events with zero or one isolated lepton . to proceed with the multi - lepton channels , we retained cuts c1 and examined the @xmath75 distribution maintaining @xmath79 but requiring @xmath80 or @xmath81 . the distribution in @xmath75 for @xmath80 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : atlepsge2 ] . here",
    "we see signal emerging from bg for @xmath82 gev .",
    "( the plot using @xmath83 is similar , but with lower signal and bg rates . )",

    "we see that there should be consistent signals above sm backgrounds in all the various multi - lepton channels for much of the mass range of @xmath42 .",
    "same sign lepton events would establish the majorana nature of the gluino@xcite .    .",
    "zero and one lepton backgrounds are shown with the same color as the signal .",
    "we found no backgrounds events to os , ss and @xmath87 to the cross section level shown.,scaledwidth=59.0% ]    it is also well - known that kinematic information on neutralino mass differences can be gleaned by examining the invariant mass distribution of opposite - sign / same flavor dilepton pairs ( os / sf)@xcite .",
    "we plot in fig .",
    "[ fig : mll ] the invariant mass distribution for case study fp4 .",
    "the hb / fp region is characterized by the fact that @xmath88 _ and _ by @xmath89 , so that two - body spoiler decays of @xmath90 and @xmath91 are closed .",
    "we then expect two mass edges in the @xmath92 distribution : in the case of fp4 , one is at @xmath93 gev and another at @xmath94 gev .",
    "indeed , the double mass edge structure is becoming visible in the @xmath95 distribution with 100 fb@xmath4 of data as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : mll ] .    , in addition to the @xmath96 peak.,scaledwidth=59.0% ]",
    "in this paper , we have examined the sort of collider events to be expected at the cern lhc for susy models in the hb / fp region of the msugra model .",
    "we found that by requiring high jet and @xmath0-jet multiplicity , and a high effective mass cut , a rather pure signal emerged from a dominantly @xmath71 sm background . since the signal came almost entirely from gluino pair production , and the decay branching fractions",
    "were fixed by assuming the neutralino relic density saturated the wmap @xmath21 measurement , the total signal rate could be used to extract an estimate of the gluino mass .",
    "factoring in theory uncertainty on the total cross section and a @xmath76 error estimate on remaining background , we found that @xmath42 could be measured to a precision of about 8% for 100 fb@xmath4 of integrated luminosity .",
    "this was our central result .",
    "we note here that our conclusions apply more generally than to just the hb / fp region of the msugra model .",
    "the key assumptions needed for our analysis are that :    1 .",
    "the flavor / cp conserving mssm is the correct effective theory of nature at the weak scale , with the lightest neutralino as lsp .",
    "we assume gaugino mass unification , as occurs in many susy gut and string models .",
    "we assume that scalars the squarks and sleptons decouple due to mass values beyond the few tev level .",
    "this leaves just the various gluinos , charginos and neutralinos contributing to lhc collider events .",
    "the value of @xmath20 is fixed by the requirement that the relic abundance of @xmath23 saturates the wmap measured value .",
    "this , along with gaugino mass unification , fixes the sparticle branching fractions to their assumed values .",
    "if these conditions are fulfilled , then the methods presented here should allow for a gluino mass extraction if @xmath42 is in the mass range of @xmath97 gev .",
    "we note here that our result depends on the sparticle branching fractions being fixed to values near our calculated results .",
    "these in turn depend on the above assumptions being fulfilled .",
    "thus , our study should be applicable to other heavy scalar situations , not only the hb / fp region of msugra . recently ,",
    "such models have received renewed attention in light of fcnc constraints , and some string theory motivated models have produced heavier scalar spectra@xcite .",
    "our considerations also apply to the low scalar mass regime of split susy models@xcite , where the gluino decays promply inside collider detectors .",
    "in addition , we note that the signal can be separated as to its isolated lepton content .",
    "typically , for each additional isolated lepton , there should be on average 1.5 less jets per event .",
    "the os / sf dilepton mass distribution embedded in the hard signal component should exhibit mass edges at @xmath5 and also at @xmath6 , which are distinctive of this scenario in which the lsp is a mixed bino - higgsino particle .",
    "the same mass edges should appear in the clean trilepton channel originating mainly from chargino - neutralino production ( the soft component ) , as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite . the mass - difference edges , along with the absolute gluino mass , may provide enough information to constrain the absolute chargino and neutralino masses ( including the lsp mass ) , under the assumptions listed above .",

    "<S> one way to ameliorate the susy flavor and cp problems is to postulate that scalar masses lie in the tev or beyond regime . for example , the focus point ( fp ) region of the minimal supergravity ( msugra ) model is especially compelling in that heavy scalar masses can co - exist with low fine - tuning while yielding the required relic abundance of cold dark matter ( via a mixed higgsino - bino neutralino ) . </S>",
    "<S> we examine many of the characteristics of collider events expected to arise at the cern lhc in models with multi - tev scalars , taking the msugra fp region as a case study . </S>",
    "<S> the collider events are characterized by a hard component arising from gluino pair production , plus a soft component arising from direct chargino and neutralino production . </S>",
    "<S> gluino decays in the fp region are characterized by lengthy cascades yielding very large jet and lepton multiplicities , and a large @xmath0-jet multiplicity . </S>",
    "<S> thus , as one steps to higher jet , @xmath0-jet or lepton multiplicity , signal - over - background rates should steadily improve . </S>",
    "<S> the lengthy cascade decays make mass reconstruction via kinematic edges difficult ; however , since the hard component is nearly pure gluino pair production , the gluino mass can be extracted to @xmath1 via total rate for @xmath2-jet @xmath3-jet events , assuming 100 fb@xmath4 of integrated luminosity . </S>",
    "<S> the distribution of invariant mass of opposite - sign / same - flavor dileptons in the hard component exhibits two dilepton mass edges : @xmath5 and @xmath6 . as a consistency check </S>",
    "<S> , the same mass edges should be seen in isolated opposite - sign dileptons occurring in the soft component trilepton signal which originates mainly from chargino - neutralino production .    </S>",
