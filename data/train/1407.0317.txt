    "a multivariate classifier is an adaptive algorithm trained to identify a signal of interest against other background events on the basis of a set of input variables .",
    "therefore the understanding of the training samples and the input variables selection are two key elements to obtain optimal results .",
    "in this paper we apply the previous paradigm in an innovative way to both the training and the input variable selection of a support vector machine  @xcite ( svm ) algorithm .",
    "in particular we obtain an excellent signal - background multivariate classifier when one of the training samples is biased ( i.e. it does not correctly reproduce all characteristics of the signal or of the background samples ) and statistically limited to few thousands of events .",
    "we decided to explore the use of the svm algorithm ( described in section  [ sec : svm ] ) because of several advantages with respect to other multivariate techniques .",
    "for example , artificial neural networks , commonly used in high energy physics  @xcite , require to arbitrarily set the complexity of the classifier ( i.e. the number of neurons and layers of the net ) , the training may converge to local minima and , usually , large training sets are needed to finely map the input space . on the other hand the svm algorithm , whose basic idea is the identification of the best hyper - plane separating two classes of vectors , has unique solution of the training algorithm , a small number of free parameters and good performance on low statistics training sets , as only a small number of training vectors are exploited in the final solution  @xcite . other promising results using svms in high energy physics analyses",
    "are reported in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in this work , developed in the framework of the analysis searching for the higgs boson with the collider detector at fermilab ( cdf ) experiment  @xcite",
    ", we deal with three machine - learning challenges : the reduction of the effect of a bias in the training set , a robust evaluation of the performance of the trained svm , and the optimal input variable selection .",
    "the key point to achieve all of the above is the scan of the free parameters of the training procedure together with a cross check of the efficiency of each resulting svm ( described in section  [ sec : training_set ] ) .",
    "the efficiency cross check is performed both on the training set , with a @xmath1-fold cross validation , and on unclassified events , with a template fitting procedure over the svm output value distribution ( described in section  [ sec : method ] ) .",
    "we tested the developed methodology on a toy model ( section  [ sec : toy ] ) and finally we applied it to a real physics case ( section  [ sec : cdf_set ] ) . in this latest part",
    "we exploited the described template fitting procedure to identify a reliable and optimal input variable selection .",
    "a wide literature discusses the topic of input variable selection but we focused on the identification of the best , minimal set of inputs .",
    "it is clear that a highly discriminative variable will improve the classification power but it has been shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that also the performance of the svm algorithm itself improves when the variables are well chosen , especially if they have very different discrimination power  @xcite .",
    "intuitively , the introduction of too many not - significant inputs introduces a noise term to the algorithm , decreasing its performance .",
    "furthermore , a reduced set of variables identifies the most important characteristics of the analyzed process and may decrease the number of needed validation checks . the complete procedure ( described in section  [ sec : var_sel ] )",
    "involves the automatic training and performance evaluation with several variables configurations .",
    "the physics case under exam is the reduction and estimate of the multi - jet background contamination in a dataset enriched in leptonic @xmath2 bosons decays , selected in association with hadronic jets .",
    "the dataset , collected at a proton - antiproton collider which was operating at @xmath3  tev ( the tevatron ) , is one of the main investigation channels at hadron collider experiments .",
    "several interesting but rare processes ( i.e. associate @xmath4 production , diboson or top quark production , etc . )",
    "produce a @xmath2 boson in the final state .",
    "the @xmath2 leptonic decay is used to identify a clear event signature out of the overwhelming multi - jet background produced by generic qcd interactions between the proton and antiproton constituents .",
    "hadronic jets faking the lepton and the neutrino identification introduce a significant multi - jet background contamination ( especially for electrons identification algorithms ) .",
    "because of its nature , the multi - jet background is a mixture of detector effects and physics processes .",
    "usually data - driven models obtained with a specific selection enriched in multi - jet events , are used to estimate this contamination .",
    "these models may be statistically limited and the use of a different selection criteria often introduces unexpected biases in the simulated variables .",
    "all this makes the application of multivariate techniques particularly challenging .",
    "the svm is a supervised learning binary classifier whose basic function is the identification of the _ best separating hyper - plane _ between two classes of @xmath1-dimension vectors .    given a training set made by two classes of vectors ( i.e. signal and background ) linearly separable , the svm algorithm produces , as a solution , a unique plane defined by the vectors at the boundary of the two classes ; those are the so called _ support vectors_. in the case of non - linear separation , the plane is found in an abstract space , defined by a transformation of the input vectors .",
    "although the transformation can be very complex , it is not necessary to know it exactly , but we just need to know its effect on the scalar product between the vectors , named _",
    "kernel_. finally the cases of not perfect separability of the two samples are solved by introducing a penalty parameter accounting for the contamination .",
    "it is possible to find more details in ref .",
    "@xcite and  @xcite , but , for sake of clarity , a short overview of the algorithm is also given in the following .",
    "for the actual , numerical , implementation of the svm algorithm we relied on the ` libsvm ` open source library  @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : svm_linear ] shows how the linear classification problem can be formalized in the minimization of @xmath5 ( with @xmath6 = vector normal to a plane ) with the constraint : @xmath7     and the constant term @xmath8.,scaledwidth=100.0% ]    the problem has a unique solution obtained by the maximization of : @xmath9 which are derived by the application of the lagrange multipliers to eq .",
    "[ eq : constraint ] .",
    "the solution identifies @xmath10 for some @xmath11 .",
    "the associated vectors , i.e. the support vectors , are a subset of the training sample that defines the best hyper - plane separating the two input classes ( see figure  [ fig : svm_linear ] ) .    when not completely separable classes of vectors are present , a _ penalty parameter _",
    "@xmath12 is added to account for the contamination .",
    "the new minimization condition is : @xmath13 with the new constraint ( derived from eq .",
    "[ eq : constraint ] ) : @xmath14 the parameter @xmath12 defines the svm implementation before the training , therefore it represents a hyper parameter of the svm .    for any new vector @xmath15 considered for classification",
    ", we evaluate its position @xmath16 with respect to the plane defined by the support vectors @xmath17 and the parameters @xmath18 : @xmath19 where @xmath8 is a constant term of the solution .",
    "the variable @xmath20 is the final output of the svm : its sign gives the signal - background classification and , if the geometry is simple , its value is the distance of a test vector @xmath15 from the classification plane .",
    "as we are going to see in the next paragraph , a non - linear classification is possible only thanks to a not - explicit transformation to a different vector space , where @xmath20 may loose the immediate geometrical meaning .",
    "natively svms are used as binary classifiers but , here , we add a large degree of flexibility by exploiting the full information of the continuous variable @xmath20 .",
    "the svm is used as a dimensionality reducer of the classification problem : the separation power and the correlations among several significant input variables are summarized into one continuous distribution .",
    "non - linearly - separable classes of vectors can be classified by transforming them with an appropriate function , @xmath21 , that maps the elements into another space , usually with higher dimension , where the linear separation is possible .    however the identification of @xmath21 is not trivial , therefore the so called _ kernel trick _ is often used . a kernel function , @xmath22 , generalizes the scalar product appearing in eq .",
    "[ eq : lagrange_1 ] ( or eq .  [ eq : lagrange_2 ] ) without the need of explicitly knowing @xmath21 .",
    "the kernel is the composition of the mapping @xmath21 with the inner product : @xmath23 the function @xmath24 should satisfy to a general set of rules to be a kernel , but we describe only the _ gaussian _ kernel we used in this work .",
    "it is expressed as : @xmath25 the corresponding @xmath26 is unknown and it maps the input vectors to an infinite dimension space .",
    "the kernel is defined only by one hyper - parameter , @xmath27 , that should be set before the training of the svm .",
    "several multivariate techniques are based on the assumption that the labelled samples used for the classifier training are drawn from the same probability distribution of the unclassified events . in our case of study , where only an approximate and statistically limited model of the background processes is available ( see section  [ sec : cdf_set ] and in particular section  [ sec : training_set ] for the multi - jet background description )",
    ", we do not expect the previous assumption to hold for every portion of the phase space . to cope with this problem",
    ", we developed an original methodology to evaluate the svm training performance .",
    "section  [ sec : svm ] shows that , for each choice of hyper - parameters and training vectors , only one optimal svm solution exists and we need to evaluate the performance of it .    as a performance estimator",
    "we use the _ confusion matrix _ of the classifier : the element @xmath28 of the matrix is the fraction of the class @xmath11 classified as member of class @xmath29 .",
    "figure  [ fig : confusion ] shows a representation of it in the two - classes case , where one class is labelled as _ background _ and the other as _ signal_. we obtain a reliable estimate of the classifier quality by filling the confusion matrix in two independent ways and combining all the available information .    [ cols=\"^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      an example of the use of the developed svm discriminant is reported in ref .",
    "in particular both the possibility to move the svm selection threshold and the fit of the multi - jet contamination over svm output variable @xmath20 are used .",
    "figure  [ fig : svm_phx_fit ] shows how the different physics processes contribute to the shape of the svm discriminant used in the selection of the forward electron sample . the multi - jet , or qcd ,",
    "fraction is extracted from the fit together with the total @xmath2 plus jets component .",
    "the svm threshold used for the final signal region identification is @xmath30 instead of the standard value of @xmath31 .",
    "this further decreases the multi - jet contamination and reduces the impact of the systematics related to the estimate of such background .",
    "used during the _ forward _ electron sample selection .",
    "the multi - jet , or qcd , background fraction ( in magenta ) is extracted from the fit together with the total @xmath2 plus jets component ( in green ) .",
    "the remaining physics processes ( in light blue ) are normalized to the expected production cross sections and acceptances .",
    "the svm selection threshold for the final signal region identification is @xmath30 instead that the standard value of @xmath31 .",
    "this further decreases the qcd contamination in the final analysis sample.,scaledwidth=100.0% ]",
    "in this paper we present an innovative method for training optimization and variable selection for a svm multivariate classifier in the problematic case of biased and statistically limited training samples .",
    "the optimization of the classifier is possible thanks to the feedback of a signal - background template fit performed on a validation sample of unclassified events over the svm output distribution @xmath20 ( defined in eq .",
    "[ eq : distance ] ) . by construction ,",
    "the svm output @xmath20 is a variable sensitive to the signal and background contamination .",
    "the optimization algorithm was then applied to an actual hadron collider physics case .",
    "the problem of multi - jet rejection in the @xmath2 plus jets channel has been analyzed in two different cases : a @xmath2 boson decaying to an electron identified in the central and in the forward region of the cdf detector and selected together with two or more hadronic jets .",
    "the optimization algorithm allowed to scan a pool of twenty - four input variables to obtain the minimal combination of them giving the lower background contamination and the higher signal efficiency .",
    "the resulting classifiers exploit eight and six input variables combinations , respectively for the _ central _ and _ forward _ svm classifiers , not directly related to the lepton identification algorithm .",
    "the performance is superior to any present multi - jet rejection algorithm applied to the same final state .",
    "the cdf ii dataset and the specific multi - jet rejection analysis have been a perfect test - bench for the svm optimization algorithm .",
    "however the procedure can be exported to any other problem where the use of multivariate techniques is required but no accurate simulation is available or possible .",
