    "the main legacy of the abel theorem is the string of developments leading to our understanding of the picard variety , functor of points and divisor class group of an algebraic variety .",

    "authors usually consider only full degree divisors @xmath4 and weight one divisor @xmath5 in ( [ add - jac ] ) when reduction coincides with inversion .",
    "this partial group operation and the corresponding one - point auto bcklund transformations ( bts ) have been studied from different points of view in many publications , in particular see @xcite and references therein .",
    "in fact , this construction of auto bts was specially developed for one - parametric discretization of continuous hamiltonian flows .",
    "our main our is to explicitly show two examples of auto bts associated with the generic divisor doubling at @xmath6 in ( [ add - jac ] ) .",
    "such auto bts represent hidden symmetries of the level manifold which yield new canonical variables on original phase space and , therefore , we can use these new variables for construction of new integrable systems , i.e. for construction of hetero bcklund transformations @xcite .",
