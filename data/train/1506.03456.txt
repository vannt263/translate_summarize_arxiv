    "left - right ( lr ) symmetric models are popular extensions of the standard model ( sm ) and are based on the gauge group @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "they were originally motivated to explain the origin of parity violation @xcite of weak interactions and found to be related to the generation of light neutrino masses via the seesaw mechanisms @xcite , linking in fact the smallness of neutrino mass with parity violation .",
    "the lr symmetry may be interpreted as the first step of an eventual unification of gauge forces as well .    while aesthetically very appealing",
    ", the theories do not predict the scale of parity restoration , leaving this question open to experiment .",
    "what is generic in lr symmetric models is the presence of right - handed currents and of gauge bosons @xmath2 and @xmath1 associated with the additional @xmath9 gauge group .",
    "the search for those generic features has been however unsuccessful so far .",
    "recently , several studies have been made in tev scale lr symmetric models exploiting meson @xcite , collider @xcite , flavor @xcite and neutrinoless double beta decay data @xcite    what these analyses have in common is assuming that ( i ) the masses of the charged bosons @xmath2 are smaller than that of the neutral one @xmath1 , and that ( ii ) the gauge couplings of the left- and right - handed interactions ( @xmath10 and @xmath11 ) are identical .",
    "this implies in particular that the effects of the @xmath2 are the ones that matter in testing the models and in determining the scale of lr symmetry .",
    "indeed , models typically advocate the presence of triplet and bidoublet scalars to generate the fermion and gauge boson masses . in this case",
    "both @xmath12 and @xmath13 result , and the scenario has been widely explored with tev scale breaking of @xmath14 down to @xmath15 resulting in charged and neutral gauge bosons with masses around the tev scale . within this symmetry breaking pattern @xmath16 collider searches have been applied because they provide stronger constraints .",
    "for instance , cms imposes @xmath17 tev @xcite assuming @xmath18 ( @xmath19 being the right - handed neutrinos ) , which translates into @xmath20  tev using the mass relation @xmath21 that holds in canonical lr models .",
    "there are also important limits stemming from electroweak data ( @xmath22  tev ) , and @xmath23 oscillations ( @xmath24  tev for p - parity as the discrete lr symmetry ) , which results into @xmath25 tev @xcite .    in this respect",
    ", one can compare the limits with @xmath26 constraints of theories in which only @xmath27 is gauged .",
    "lep2 imposes @xmath28  tev , where @xmath29 is the gauge coupling @xcite .",
    "however , this limit on the @xmath27 coupling can not be easily applied to lr models , even though there is a gauge coupling relation @xmath30 . in @xmath31 theories",
    "@xmath29 solely determines the @xmath32-fermion couplings which are purely vectorial . in lr models ,",
    "on the other hand , there are vector and axial couplings and other constant factors related to the weinberg angle which suppress the coupling to leptons .",
    "therefore , those extra factors should be taken into account .",
    "indeed , the overall couplings to leptons are dwindled along with the lep2 bound stemming from @xmath27 theories , as one can see in ref .",
    "there , the authors found a lower mass limit of @xmath33  gev on the @xmath32 for @xmath34 .",
    "we stress here the both features mentioned above , @xmath12 and @xmath13 , are not guaranteed in general , and the experimental searches for lr symmetry should not be limited to those assumptions . in particular one might evoke different symmetry breaking patterns yielding @xmath35 . hence from a general perspective , it is crucial to carry out an independent @xmath1-collider study , since in this mass regime @xmath1 collider searches become the most effective way of constraining lr models specially when @xmath16 is sufficiently heavy , out of reach of current experiments . without losing generality ,",
    "we use in this paper atlas data at 8 tev and @xmath36 luminosity , to set limits on the @xmath1 mass of lr models using dilepton data using madgraph5,pythia and delphes3 , as dilepton resonance searches are the most efficient method to bound neutral gauge bosons that have non - negligible couplings to leptons @xcite .",
    "we emphasize that our results are quite general because they rely only on the neutral current of the @xmath1 gauge boson .    additionally to those limits , we present as an explicit example a model based on a two step - breaking pattern which generates @xmath35 in a consistent way , with predicted @xmath37 ratios by forcing unification at the gut scale .",
    "left - right symmetric models are based on the gauge group @xmath38 . in addition , a discrete left - right symmetry is present implying equal values of gauge couplings for the @xmath39 gauge groups i.e.  @xmath40 .",
    "the quarks and leptons come as lr symmetric doublet representations @xmath41 and @xmath42 . in the conventional and most",
    "often studied left - right symmetric models @xmath43 is broken down to @xmath15 in one single step .",
    "in particular , the discrete left - right symmetry ( denoted as parity or charge conjugation ) and the @xmath44 gauge symmetry are broken at the same time and scale at the electroweak scale @xcite , see also the appendix . ] .",
    "however , it should be noted here that the spontaneous symmetry breaking of @xmath14 down to @xmath15 can be achieved either by higgs triplets ( @xmath45 with even @xmath46 ) or higgs doublets ( @xmath47 with odd @xmath48 ) or a combination of both higgs doublets and triplets . with the simple higgs sector comprising of a bidoublet plus @xmath39 triplets @xmath49 , the known formula between the right - handed charged and neutral gauge boson masses",
    "is given by @xmath50 with @xmath51 , one can find that @xmath52 .",
    "thus , the existing experimental bounds on @xmath53 can be translated into more restrictive limits on @xmath54 .",
    "the aforementioned limits on the @xmath16 mass which are in the ballpark of several tev make the @xmath1 production unattainable at the lhc .",
    "albeit , in this work we consider different classes of lr models , where this mass relation does not apply .",
    "in particular , the @xmath16 mass is set to be at a scale much larger than tev , whereas the @xmath1 mass lies at the tev scale .",
    "a possible way to conceive this setup is by introducing two triplet scalars @xmath55 and @xmath49 , with @xmath56 respectively . with their inclusion",
    "the lr symmetry breaks down to the sm gauge group in two steps : ( i ) @xmath57 breaks to and @xmath58 are the same , which always happens if the breaking is mediated by a higgs field in the adjoint representation . ]",
    "@xmath59 at @xmath16 mass scale which is implemented through the vacuum expectation value ( vev ) of the heavier triplet carrying @xmath60 , i.e.  @xmath61 ; ( ii ) then @xmath62 breaks down to @xmath15 at the @xmath1 mass scale defined by the vev of the @xmath63 .",
    "setting the vev of @xmath61 to a very high energy scale ,",
    "@xmath16 completely decouples from @xmath1 . moreover",
    ", we need a bi - doublet ( @xmath64 ) to break @xmath65 down to electromagnetism .    assuming the lighter right - handed neutral gauge boson @xmath1 acquires mass at the tev scale",
    ", then @xmath1 searches become the most promising ones to derive limits on the mass of this neutral boson . in the next section",
    "we discuss the @xmath1 phenomenology and derive dilepton limits using recent atlas data .",
    "of course , one does not have to rely on the precise symmetry breaking pattern we are proposing .",
    "the idea of having a light neutral gauge boson and a very heavy charged one is what our reasoning is mostly based on .",
    "a more detailed study of the above symmetry breaking pattern , plus analyses of the scalar potential , neutrino masses and other phenomenological consequences will be presented elsewhere @xcite .",
    "as far as dilepton bounds are concerned which are the focus of this work , the relevant interactions for us are the @xmath1-fermions couplings given by @xmath66 where the vector and axial couplings are defined as @xmath67 \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\hspace*{-0.5cm}g^f_a=\\frac{1}{2}\\left[\\big\\{\\delta \\tan^2\\theta_w \\left(t^{f}_{3l }        -\\mbox{q}^f \\right)\\big\\ }   - \\big\\{t^{f}_{3r}- \\delta \\tan^2\\theta_w \\mbox{q}^f\\big\\}\\right ] \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath68 the ratio of gauge couplings , @xmath69 being @xmath70 ( @xmath71 ) for up ( down ) type fermions and @xmath72 the respective electric charge .",
    "it is clear that the neutral current is general , and thus the coupling strengths . for this precise reason",
    "the limits that we are about to derive in the next section are applicable to a rather large class of lr models .",
    "mass using atlas 8 tev 20.3 @xmath73 integrated luminosity data for two different @xmath11 values ( @xmath74 is the canonical value equal to @xmath10 ) . for a larger @xmath11 range see fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] . in the inner graph",
    "we show the essentially absent dependence of our limits on the right - handed neutrino masses due to their small associated branching ratio . ]",
    "dileptons and dijet searches have been proved to be the most effective as far as bounds on additional @xmath75 bosons are concerned unless they have negligible couplings to leptons or large branching ratios to missing energy such as dark matter @xcite .",
    "hence , in the classes of lr symmetric models we are studying we need to consider those in order to set limits on the @xmath1 .",
    "the neutral gauge bosons can be produced in the @xmath76-channel from @xmath77 annihilation . to perform the search ,",
    "the dilepton invariant mass line shape is studied for a localized excess of events corresponding to a new physics resonance .    to derive the dilepton limits on this specific model we simulate the process @xmath78 , plus up to two extra jets using madgraph5 @xcite , and compare with the results from the atlas collaboration reported in ref .",
    "@xcite , from where we also take the background events . for this reason",
    "we obtain the number of events in bins of the dilepton invariant mass @xmath79 as follows : @xmath80  gev , @xmath81  gev , @xmath82  gev , @xmath83  gev , @xmath84  gev , @xmath85  gev . for the signal events we account for clustering and hadronizing jets as well as for soft and collinear qcd radiation with pythia @xcite , and simulate detector efficiencies with delphes3 @xcite . in our results",
    "we used the cteq6l parton distribution functions computed at @xmath86 @xcite .",
    "following the procedure in ref .",
    "@xcite , the signal events were selected by applying the cuts :     mass for different @xmath11 values . from eq .",

    "that being said , we simply compute the number of dilepton events for the signal and compare with the background events to derive @xmath93% c.l .",

    "[ fig:1 ] , simply because the branching ratio into right - handed neutrinos is rather small . when right - handed neutrinos are kinematically available for the @xmath1 to decay into the limits on the @xmath1 change by approximately @xmath97 , which is basically unnoticeable in the inner graph of fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] . in order to account for several possible symmetry breaking schemes which may induce different @xmath11 values ,",
    "we show in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] how our limits change as we vary @xmath11 .",
    "we stress that as @xmath11 increases the @xmath1-fermion couplings do not necessarily grow as one can see from eq .",

    "[ fig:2 ] we observe that dilepton data excludes @xmath1 masses below @xmath98  gev for @xmath99 respectively .",
    "so far those @xmath11 values are simply random choices , but we stress that by embedding the symmetry breaking scheme in a @xmath100 model , @xmath11 can be predicted by enforcing gauge coupling unification as shown in the appendix for a particular example . in summary ,",
    "our limits are quite general because they rely simply on the @xmath1-fermions couplings and thus are applicable to a multitude of lr models .",
    "besides , they comprise the most stringent direct limits on the @xmath1 mass .",
    "we point out that the scale of the left - right symmetry breaking can always be pushed up to higher scales , in principle , to evade our bounds , i.e. assume heavier mediators . concerning , collider projections , in order to determine the discovery potential at lhc 13 tev for instance",
    ", one would have to know the fake jet rate and the dilepton efficiencies at lhc 13 tev , which are unknown at this point .",
    "however , a rather speculative study could be done though .",
    "since our limits lie in the ballpark of @xmath101  tev and heavy dilepton resonances are clean signals , it is clear that @xmath1 bosons with such masses will be either ruled out or observed at lhc 13 tev .",
    "canonical left - right symmetric models suffer from strong bounds on the charged gauge boson mass , which result in much stronger limits on the @xmath1 mass due to the mass relation that holds in those models .",
    "if one explores different patterns of left - right symmetry breaking the @xmath1 may be light enough to be produced at the lhc while the @xmath16 is way heavier , motivating an independent @xmath1 collider study .",
    "as proof of principle , we presented a symmetry breaking scheme which consistently generates the inverted mass hierarchy @xmath102 with the @xmath1 mass at the tev scale . in the appendix , we show that through demanding gauge coupling unification and embedding the model in @xmath100 the value of the right - handed gauge coupling @xmath11 can be predicted , which for the example under study is in the ballpark of @xmath103 for several @xmath31 breaking scales .",
    "we note that models with very large @xmath16 masses have the advantage of suppressing the @xmath104-@xmath16 mixing , which generates dangerously large lepton flavor violating processes .    after showing that light @xmath1 can be generated in lr models",

    "our findings are almost independent of the right - handed neutrino masses due to their small branching ratio , and applicable to general left - right models .",
    "we stress that our bounds are the leading ones when @xmath102 , and complementary to the existing indirect ones stemming from @xmath16 searches in the setup @xmath109 . either way",
