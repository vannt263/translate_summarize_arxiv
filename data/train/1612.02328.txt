    "studies of the optical beam phase confirmed @xcite or suggested deviations @xcite from the law of geometrical optics @xcite .",
    "for example , the first order taylor expansion of the snell phase represents an alternative method to calculate , by the stationary phase method @xcite , the optical path of light beams . in a recent work @xcite ,",
    "the effects of the second order taylor expansion of the snell phase on the beam profile was investigated and an analytical formula found for the transversal symmetry breaking and the axial spreading modification . if such theoretical predictions were confirmed by an experimental analysis , the use of the snell phase in describing the optical beam propagation through dielectric blocks is not a matter of elegance in determining the optical path , but a necessity in correctly predicting the beam profile behavior . in this case , the importance of the snell phase could not only be seen in confirming the law of geometrical optics ( first order term expansion ) but also in predicting deviations from the original shape of our beam ( second order term expansion ) .",
    "the beam profile control finds important applications in many research fields . in the mode matching of optical cavities ,",
    "the adjustment of the beam width is crucial for a good luminous energy storage @xcite .",

    "crystal wave - guides , the mode matching should be carefully observed @xcite . additionally , the trapping of charged and neutral atoms has played a fundamental role in atomic and molecular physics @xcite .",
    "the common trap used for storage devices at ultra - low energies is the dipole trap which relies on the electric dipole interaction with far - detuned lasers .",
    "the result is a structure to trap atoms in the region of high intensity of a focused beam @xcite . in this context ,",
    "a controlled rotation of dielectric blocks sheds new light on fine tuning the axial spreading factor and , consequently , tuning of these optical systems in general .",
    "thus , a device capable of controlling the beam width in a simple and precise way is of great importance for laser applications .",
