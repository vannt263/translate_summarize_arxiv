    "for a projective variety @xmath0 , strominger - yau - zaslow conjectured that we can obtain the space @xmath0 as a moduli space of special lagrangians with @xmath1 connections when we have a mirror pair of @xmath0 and argued locally and physically .",
    "the author recommends @xcite for a recent illustration on the subject and @xcite for a general reference .    in this paper",
    ", we study the conjecture categorically in the framework of homological mirror symmetry of kontsevich @xcite and stability conditions of bridgeland @xcite . the latter notion , which was inspired by douglas so - called @xmath2-stabilities in superstring theory @xcite ,",

    "we put pairs of stability conditions which are named _ mirrors _ in definition [ def : mirror ] and defined on quivers with commuting relations with the following properties ( see theorem [ thm : syz ] ) . for one in each pair , with framing in definitions [ def : rest ] and [ def : rest_rep ] in terms of a finite group of tensor products of auslander - reiten transformations , we have a moduli space of stable lagrangian connect sums of graded lagrangian vanishing cycles ; this moduli space via the serre - de rham functor in definition [ def : twisted ] gives the calabi - yau fermat variety in @xmath5 defined by the zero locus of @xmath6 . for the other one in the pair , graded lagrangian vanishing cycles are stable .",
    "stable objects above are stable representations of quivers even when we forget relations .",
    "in particular , graded lagrangian vanishing cycles trivially satisfy self - dual equations . in this paper , connections are over transverse intersections of graded lagrangian vanishing cycles and connect trivial vector bundles on graded lagrangian vanishing cycles ; so , they are maps between vector spaces and consistency with grading make them representations of quivers with relations .",
    "let us recall the notion of stability conditions . for a triangulated category @xmath7 ,",
    "each stability condition is determined by a bounded @xmath8-structure and a stability function @xmath9 , which gives central charges of elements of the grothendieck group of @xmath7 , on the heart of the @xmath8-structure .",
    "we go on with explicit examples for our later use .",
    "let @xmath10 denote the a - type dynkin quiver of vertices @xmath11 and arrows @xmath12 and let @xmath13 denote the @xmath14-fold tensor product of @xmath10 ( see @xcite for the general definition of tensor products of quivers ) .",
    "each vertex @xmath15 of @xmath13 can be labelled by @xmath14-tuples @xmath16 for @xmath17 .",

    "we have commuting relations on arrows .",
    "for our convenience in this paper , for each vertex @xmath15 of @xmath13 , we call the number @xmath26 the _ index _ of @xmath15 .    for example",
    ", the following figure shows commuting arrows on rectangles which connect vertices of indices @xmath27 for @xmath28 .",
    "[ fig : partial quintic quiver ]    for the triangulated category @xmath29 and the heart @xmath30 of the bounded @xmath8-structure , we have a stability function which maps simple representations into the upper - half plane of the complex plane .",
    "we mean by @xmath31 a stability function on the heart @xmath30 with the following conditions : slopes of simple representations , which are one - dimensional representations over vertices , strictly decreases as their indices increases and central charges of simple representations of the same indices are the same . choices of such stability functions gives the open submanifold of the stability manifold of @xmath32 .",
    "the following figure shows one of such stability functions on @xmath33 .",
    "arrows indicate increases of coordinates of the complex plane .",
    "central charges of simple representations put dots .",

    "[ fig : central_charge_q ]    for our convenience in this paper , we call the stability condition of @xmath29 determined by the stability function @xmath38 on the heart @xmath30 is _ mirror _ to the stability condition determined by the stability function @xmath31 on the same heart @xmath30 . between these mirrors",

    ", we have a stability condition with stable objects being simple representations , and we have the mirror stability condition with a representation of a nontrivial support being a stable object .",
    "we can state notions in definition [ def : mirror ] in a more general way ; however , without a finiteness property on the heart such as ( * ? ? ?",
    "* proposition 2.3 ) , even if we assume the existence of a stability condition , the existence of the mirror stability condition is obscure",
    ". examples of mirror stability conditions in terms of spherical functors or wall - crossings can be found in @xcite .",
    "in this paper , derived equivalence @xmath42 means that on both sides of the equivalence , we have compact generating objects with @xmath43-isomorphic @xmath43 enhancements ; this is an example of so - called derived morita equivalence .    in @xcite",
    ", we have seen that @xmath6 is self - dual up to the equivariance with respect to the group @xmath44 which consists of @xmath14-tuples of @xmath14-th roots of the unity modulo diagonals and which acts on coordinates .",
    "for example , we have @xmath45 for the @xmath44-equivariant bounded derived category of coherent sheaves of the calabi - yau fermat variety and the fukaya - seidel category of @xmath6 ( see @xcite for a different account ) .",
    "we have a morsification of @xmath6 and an @xmath43 algebra of graded lagrangian vanishing cycles in terms of lagrangian intersection theories such that the @xmath43 algebra is @xmath43-isomorphic to the yoneda ( @xmath46 ) algebra of simple representations of @xmath13 . for simple representations @xmath47 and @xmath48 of vertices @xmath15 and @xmath49 of @xmath13 with an arrow @xmath50 , we have an one - dimensional @xmath51 morphism and these morphisms along arrows anti - commute .    for each @xmath52 ,",

    "bases of @xmath56 can be given by morphisms @xmath57 for @xmath58 such that we have anti - commuting relations @xmath59 for @xmath60 .",
    "putting ( weighted ) copies of @xmath61 on arrows @xmath18 such that @xmath23 and @xmath62 , it is easy to check that @xmath44-equivariant objects of @xmath53 give also the yoneda algebra .    for the dual statement of @xmath63 , enhancing the argument above , we have defined the @xmath64 quotient @xmath65 of @xmath66 as the perfect derived category of the dg @xmath64-orbit category ( see @xcite ) of a dg algebra @xmath39 which is @xmath43 isomorphic to the @xmath43 algebra of objects in @xmath64-orbits of graded lagrangian vanishing cycles so that the dg @xmath64-orbit category is a dg enhancement of the yoneda algebra of objects @xmath53 .",
    "this is a formal application of pontryagin duality on categories of dg categories , and @xmath67 .",
    "as for the existence of such @xmath39 , we can take the dg algebra of @xmath64-graded matrix factorizations of @xmath53 in terms of the dg category of graded matrix factorizations of @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "we have @xmath68 in terms of dg tensor products ( see @xcite ) .",

    "actions of the finite group consisting of @xmath72 such that @xmath73 coincides with those of @xmath64 above and the index of each simple representation of @xmath13 stays the same by the actions .",
    "directly , it is highly nontrivial to discuss stability conditions and moduli spaces on complexes of @xmath53 with nontrivial @xmath43 structures to take into account ( see @xcite ) , even with motivating realizations in terms of coherent sheaves or lagrangians .    by taking equivariance , we have stability conditions on @xmath74 , and on @xmath75 .",
    "still , an issue we face to consider stability conditions on @xmath76 with stability conditions on @xmath30 is that such stability conditions are not invariant under @xmath64 ; because , not all objects which consist of the @xmath64-orbit of a simple representation of @xmath77 are representations of @xmath13 . if they were invariant , then we would have taken advantages of the paper @xcite by polishchuk and the paper @xcite by macr - mehrotra - stellari .",
    "we overcome the issue by taking the notion of _ framed @xmath64-invariance _ on stability conditions in definition [ def : rest ] and representations and morphisms in definition [ def : rest_rep ] ; instead of full products of general linear groups over vertices , we take ones which commutes with @xmath64 actions restricted on simple representations of @xmath13 .",
