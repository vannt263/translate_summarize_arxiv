    "parametrically down - converted light exhibits correlations between the down - converted modes , and has been a primary source in experimental quantum - optics . at low photon - fluxes , these correlations are inherently nonclassical , and are exhibited in the generation of entangled photon - pairs .",
    "two - photon interactions induced by entangled photons are expected to exhibit nonclassical features , in particular a linear dependence on the intensity , as was observed with two - photon absorption ( tpa ) @xcite and with sum - frequency generation ( sfg ) @xcite . at higher powers , the correlations between the down - converted modes are better expressed as quadrature correlations . in this regime ,",
    "the nonclassical nature of the correlations lies in the fact that their precision can exceed the vacuum shot - noise level , a phenomenon that is named squeezing , and is expected to effect two - photon interactions even at photon - fluxes which exceed the single photon regime .",
    "however , while squeezing ( i.e. the high precision of the correlations ) is easily destroyed ( for example , by linear losses ) , the remaining correlations still have a dramatic effect on two - photon interactions .",
    "specifically , when the down - converted bandwidth is significantly larger than the pump bandwidth , the down - converted light can induce two - photon interactions with the same efficiency and sharp temporal behavior as ultrashort pulses , while exhibiting high spectral resolution as that of the narrowband pump .",
    "although at low photon fluxes these properties are a manifestation of the time and energy entanglement between the down - converted photons , at high powers exactly the same properties are exhibited if the final state of the induced two - photon interaction is narrowband enough @xcite .",
    "this effect occurs since the narrow bandwidth of the final state `` post - selects '' only the contribution of photon pairs that are complementary in energy .",
    "thus , in the high - power regime , these seemingly nonclassical properties are completely described within the classical framework ( in fact , they are equivalent to the correlations that exist between the transmitted signal and its key in spread - spectrum communication systems @xcite ) , and do not depend on the squeezing degree of the down - converted light .",
    "this equivalence of broadband down - converted light to coherent ultrashort pulses also implies an ability to coherently control and shape the induced two - photon interactions with pulse - shaping techniques , although the down - converted light is neither coherent , nor pulsed .",
    "this effect was demonstrated both in high power and with broadband entangled photons @xcite , in which case it can be viewed as shaping of the second - order correlation function of the entangled photons @xmath5 .",
    "the fact that these unique properties can be exhibited at high powers , with no dependence on nonclassical features of the light ( such as entanglement or squeezing ) , makes this phenomena both interesting and applicable .",
    "+ in this paper we describe analytically this unique behavior of two - photon interactions with broadband down - converted light .",
    "first , in section [ motion ] , we analytically solve the equations of motion for broadband parametric down - conversion with arbitrary pump ( continuous or pulsed ) , obtaining a non - perturbative solution that is valid both for low - power and for high - power down - converted light .",
    "the derivation takes into account the specific spectrum of the pump , assuming only that it is significantly narrower than the down - converted spectrum .",
    "the solution , namely the annihilation operators for the down - converted fields , is represented as a function of the down - converted spectrum , a property that is typically easy to calculate , estimate or measure .",
    "+ in section [ operators ] , we formulate quantum - mechanical operators that can represent multiphoton phenomena , specifically tpa , sfg and coincidence events , induced by any broadband light . by evaluating the expectation value of these operators , using the annihilation operators derived in section [ motion ]",
    ", we obtain in section [ evaluation ] a generic analytic expression for two - photon interactions induced by broadband down - converted light , as a function of the pump spectrum and the down - converted spectrum . in section [ results ]",
    "we derive specific expressions for tpa , sfg and coincidence events induced by broadband down - converted light , and analyze their temporal and spectral properties . in section [ summary ]",
    "we give a brief summary of our results and add some concluding remarks .",
    "in our derivations we have chosen to use a continuous - variables version of the formalism suggested by huttner _",
    "this formalism represents the quantum fields in terms of space - dependent spectral mode operators @xmath6 , instead of time - dependent momentum mode operators @xmath7 .",
    "the advantage is that unlike momentum modes , temporal modes are unchanged by a dielectric medium , reflecting the physical fact that while the energy density of the fields depends on the medium , the energy _ flux _ does not .",
    "accordingly , a temporal periodicity , instead of a spatial periodicity is assumed in the quantization process .",
    "we have performed the transition to continuous variables ( taking the temporal periodicity to infinity ) following the guidelines of the same procedure in momentum and space @xcite . specifically , assuming a single polarization and a single spatial mode we may write : @xmath8    where @xmath9 is the beam area , @xmath10 is the permittivity , and @xmath11 are the slowly varying complex amplitudes of the creation and annihilation operators of the electromagnetic field @xcite .",
    "a major advantage of this formalism is the relative convenience at which we can define a momentum operator @xmath12 for the electromagnetic field in a dispersive medium , and use it as the generator for space propagation .",
    "the equations ( and hence the solutions ) derived in the following resemble those attained by using the classical maxwell equations , or by using the hamiltonian for time propagation and replacing the spatial coordinate @xmath13 by @xmath14 ( see , for example , @xcite ) ; however the derivation presented here is a multimode , continuum - frequency one , enabling us to take into account the specific spectrum of the pump and the fact that each signal mode is coupled by the pump to multiple idler modes , and vice versa .",
    "+ the momentum operator related to the second - order nonlinear polarization is of the form :    @xmath15    where the subscripts @xmath16 denote the signal , idler and pump modes , respectively , @xmath17 denote the corresponding indices of refraction , and with : @xmath18    the primary assumption throughout our calculations is that the down - converted spectrum @xmath19 is considerably broader than the pump bandwidth @xmath20 : @xmath21 where we take @xmath19 to denote the bandwidth of the signal ( or the idler ) field ( note that the signal and the idler have the same bandwidth ) .",
    "having assumed a narrowband pump , we can safely neglect the dependence of @xmath22 ( which is typically real ) and @xmath23 on @xmath24 , since typically the crystal s nonlinear properties vary only at much larger scales of frequencies , and write : @xmath25 , and @xmath26 .",

    "note that at low powers this corresponds to shaping of the second - order correlation function @xmath324 of the down - converted entangled photon pairs .",
    "it is also interesting to note that @xmath206 responds to the antisymmetric sum of the phases applied to the signal and the idler : @xmath325 , with @xmath146 being the center frequency of the pump .",
    "thus , if the same spectral filter is applied to both the signal and the idler beams , only phase functions that are symmetric about @xmath326 affect @xmath327 . similarly , if the signal and the idler travel through the same medium , only odd orders of dispersion will have an effect on @xmath327 .",
    "+ in contrast , the incoherent signal depends only on the temporal overlap between the intensities of the down - converted signal and idler beams , and so reacts to a delay between the signal and the idler on the same time - scale as the long pulses or even continuous behavior of the pump :      if the pump is narrower than the final state , or @xmath329 if the final state is narrower than the pump . in both cases ,",
    "if we consider the temporal average in the case of a continuous pump , or the ensemble average in the case of a quasi - continuous pump ( i.e. non - transform limited pulses , for which @xmath330 , with @xmath36 being the duration of the pulses , and @xmath20 their bandwidth ) , then the average incoherent signal is proportional to the normalized second - order correlation function of the pump ( for @xmath331 ) : @xmath332    thus , as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig temporal ] , there are three temporal timescales in our system .",
    "the longest one is the duration of the pump pulse ( which can be infinity for a continuous pump ) .",
    "this timescale dictates the temporal behavior of the incoherent signal as a function of the signal - idler delay .",
    "the next is the coherence time of the pump which is @xmath223 ( and is equal to the duration of the pump pulse , in case it is a transform - limited one ) . for signal - idler delays which are shorter than this coherence time ,",
    "the average of the incoherent signal is higher since the intensities of the signal and the idler become correlated , as they both reflect the intensity fluctuations of the pump . the shortest time scale is the behavior of the coherent signal , which is on the same timescale as the coherence time of the broadband down - converted light : @xmath224 .",
    "+ as for the spectral behavior , the coherent signal behaves as though the interaction is actually being induced by the pump itself , and not by the down - converted light .",
    "thus , the coherent signal is induced only if the pump spectrum overlaps with the final state : @xmath333 where @xmath134 represents the the spectrum of the final atomic level in tpa , or the phase - matching function for up - conversion in the case of sfg , and with @xmath77 being the center frequency of the final atomic level or of the phase - matched spectrum in case of sfg .",
    "the consequences of this spectral behavior is that by scanning the pump wavelength we can perform two - photon spectroscopy with the spectral resolution of the narrowband pump , even though the interaction is induced by light that is orders of magnitude wider than the pump , and not by the pump itself ( see fig .",
    "[ fig tpa spectrum ] ) . in the case of sfg",
    "this means that light is being up converted only at those wavelengths : @xmath334 so that even if the phase matching conditions allow broadband up - conversion , @xmath196 replicates the narrow spectrum of the pump ( see fig .",
    "[ fig sfg spectrum ] ) .",
    "the incoherent signal , on the other hand , is insensitive to the exact wavelength of the pump that generated the down - converted light .",
    "since the information on the original wavelength of the pump is imprinted in the phase correlations between the down - converted modes , it affects only the coherent signal @xmath183 .",
    "accordingly , the incoherent signal is induced at all the possible frequency band of the final state of the interaction ( see fig .",
    "[ fig sfg spectrum ] ) : @xmath335    the coherent and incoherent signals also exhibit different dependencies on @xmath188 , the average photon - flux spectral density , and on the bandwidth @xmath125 of the down - converted light .",
    "while the incoherent signal depends quadratically on @xmath188 , the coherent signal includes an additional , non - classical term that depends linearly on @xmath188 : @xmath336    this behavior is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig linsfg ] .",
    "+ additionally , since the coherent signal results from coherent summation over the entire ( correlated ) spectra of the signal and the idler , it depends quadratically on @xmath125 , while the incoherent signal depends only linearly on @xmath125 + thus , excluding the case of pump pulses that are transform - limited , the ratio between the average coherent and incoherent signals can be represented as :      where @xmath149 is the bandwidth of the final state .",
    "as long as the delay between the signal and the idler beams is smaller than @xmath224 , and in the absence of odd - order dispersion , we can assign @xmath338 .",
    "taking into account that typically @xmath339 , we see that the coherent signal is dominant not only at low photon fluxes ( @xmath340 , i.e. at the entangled - photons regime ) but also at classically - high power levels , as long as both the pump and the final state of the interaction are narrower than the down - converted bandwidth : @xmath341    in the case of coincidence detection , the relatively long gating time @xmath342 of the electronic coincidence detection circuit makes the incoherent contribution to the coincidence counts rate @xmath300 much larger : @xmath343    thus , for the coherent contribution to dominate in electronic coincidence - detection , one is restricted to very low photon fluxes ( @xmath344 ) .",
    "+ it is important to note that in this paper we took into account only two - photon interactions that result from cross - mixing of the signal and the idler fields and not from self - mixing of the signal with itself or the idler with itself . in both tpa and sfg ,",
    "the cross - mixing term can be isolated spectrally if the signal and the idler are non - degenerate . in sfg",
    ", the cross - mixing term can also be isolated spatially if the down - conversion is non - collinear .",
    "however , in cases where the self - mixing term is indistinguishable from the cross - mixing terms ( for example in the case of tpa with degenerate signal and idler fields , or if degenerate and collinear down conversion is considered ) this has the effect of increasing the incoherent signal by a factor of two : @xmath345    naturally , the coherent signal is generated only by cross - mixing of the signal and the idler fields , and therefore is not affected by such self - mixing terms .",
    "+ finally we note again that none of the effects described in this paper is directly related to squeezing .",
    "even the non - classical linear intensity dependence is in fact independent of squeezing ; since the coherent and incoherent signals are attenuated equally ( quadratically ) by such losses , this effect can be observed even in the presence of losses that would wipe out the squeezing properties completely .",
    "moreover , while the squeezing degree grows with @xmath188 and is very small for @xmath346 , the linear term becomes less and less dominant as @xmath188 grows , and is completely negligible at @xmath226 .",
    "furthermore , excluding the linear intensity dependence of the coherent signal , all the other effects considered in this paper are completely described within the classical framework . indeed , such effects can be created by appropriately shaping classical pulses , so that they obtain similar anti - symmetric spectral phase correlations .",
    "however , the precision of these correlations in broadband down - converted light can be many orders of magnitude higher than achievable by pulse - shaping techniques .",
    "the unique properties of two - photon interactions induced by broadband down - converted light are therefore both interesting and applicable ."
