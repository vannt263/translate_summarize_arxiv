    "when quantum mechanics was first developed it was argued that it might only be an approximation of an underlying classical `` hidden - variable '' theory @xcite .",
    "this was put on a testable basis by the development of bell inequalities @xcite , which should be obeyed by any local hidden variable ( lhv ) theory .",
    "experimental violation @xcite of bell inequalities provides strong evidence against lhv theories , but almost all of these experiments ( with the exceptions of those in refs .",
    "@xcite ) have the loophole that the violation of the bell inequality could , in principle , be caused by loss @xcite .",
    "the interpretation of these experiments as ruling out lhv theories therefore relies on the assumption that the sampling is `` fair '' @xcite . for the interpretation of these experiments",
    "it is therefore vital to establish what constitutes fair sampling .",
    "here we put fair sampling on a rigorous basis by determining exactly what forms of loss can lead to violation of bell inequalities .",
    "the standard form of the fair sampling assumption is that the detection efficiency is independent of measurement settings @xcite .",
    "here we find that assumption is unnecessary .",
    "the efficiency can depend on the measurement settings , provided the efficiency factorises as a function of the measurement settings and any hidden variable .",
    "most experimental tests are of the clauser , horne , shimony and holt ( chsh ) form of the bell inequality @xcite , and we therefore concentrate on the chsh - bell inequality in this work .",
    "our condition is both necessary and sufficient for the chsh - bell inequality to be satisfied for lhv theories .",
    "an alternative sufficient condition was previously found by ref .",
    "we also establish the necessary and sufficient condition for the chsh - bell inequality to be satisfied for unentangled states , and show that if the sampling is fair it will also prevent violation of tsirelson s bound @xcite with entangled states .",
    "this result means that , in order to obtain violation of tsirelson s bound @xcite with entangled states , but not of the chsh - bell inequality with unentangled states , it is necessary to examine the specific measurement , and not just the form of the loss .",
    "we present a scheme that violates tsirelson s bound with entangled states , but not the chsh - bell inequality with unentangled states . the chsh - bell inequality is still violated with lhv theories , but the scheme can tolerate greater loss than the bound derived in ref .  @xcite .",
    "other methods of constructing bell inequalities with greater resistance to loss have been proposed in refs .",

    "general bell inequalities are presented in sec .",

    "[ sec : conc ] .",
    "the first work to give a form of the fair sampling assumption was that of clauser , horne , shimony and holt @xcite .",
    "they assumed , in deriving their inequality , that the detection efficiency is independent of the measurement settings .",
    "pearle expressed the assumption alternatively , that `` the data recorded [ is ] representative of the accepted data '' @xcite .",
    "that is , that the sample of detected pairs provides a fair statistical sample of all the pairs .",
    "these forms of the fair sampling assumption , which superficially appear different , are effectively equivalent .    for the sample to be completely fair , the probability of sampling a pair ( i.e.  the efficiency ) needs to be independent of the pair . for this to be the case",
    ", the efficiency needs to be independent of any quantity that varies between the individual pairs .",
    "the only quantities that can vary between the individual pairs are the internal state ( the quantum state or any hypothetical hidden variable ) and the measurement setting that is used in measuring the pair . therefore the requirement that the sample is fair is exactly equivalent to requiring the efficiency to be independent of the internal state and measurement setting .",
    "this requirement is slightly stronger than the requirement given by ref .",
    "@xcite , because it requires that the efficiency is also independent of the state of the pair .",
    "however , it is easily seen that the efficiency need not be independent of the state .",
    "this is because , if the efficiency is dependent on the state , but independent of the measurement setting , then the postselection simply changes the probabilities for the internal state , yielding a different postselected state .",
    "that is , the sampling may not be fair , but the loss is simply yielding a postselected state on which the sampling is fair .",
    "this is taken advantage of in procrustean entanglement concentration @xcite , which has been demonstrated to enhance the violation of bell inequalitites @xcite .",
    "procrustean entanglement concentration gives loss that depends on the state , but because this loss is independent of the measurement settings of the bell measurement , it does not invalidate the bell inequalities for unentangled states .",
    "although the sampling is not entirely fair for the initial state , it is fair for the state produced by the procrustean entanglement concentration .",
    "it is important to note that the condition that the efficiency is independent of the measurement setting means that it must be _ completely _ independent of the measurement setting .",
    "that is , it can not be a function of the measurement setting , so it is independent of the measurement setting for any internal state . on the other hand , if the efficiency is independent of the measurement setting for just one state , then it is easy to provide examples where the bell inequality is violated with unentangled states or hidden variables . for a simple example ,",
    "see appendix [ sec : example ] .",
    "in a general bell inequality experiment with multiple parties , these parties each share one component of a state @xmath0 , and each performs one of a number of different measurements .",
    "the measurement settings for party @xmath1 are denoted @xmath2 , and the measurement results are denoted @xmath3 .",
    "we denote the vectors of measurement settings and measurement results @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "one obtains a set of measurement probabilities @xmath6 , and can define a bell quantity as a linear combination of these probabilities .",
    "a bell inequality is then an upper bound on the value of this quantity for lhv theories . with loss",
    ", we denote the probability of a successful measurement for settings @xmath4 by @xmath7 .",
    "the postselected probabilities are then given by @xmath8 we do not consider complete loss , which would make the postselected probabilities undefined .",
    "in the specific case of chsh - bell inequalities , there are two parties , alice and bob , and each performs one of two dichotomic measurements . now using the notation @xmath9 and @xmath10 for the measurement settings for alice and bob , respectively , we have @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 . the chsh - bell quantity without postselection",
    "is defined by @xmath14 where @xmath15 the postselected form of the chsh - bell quantity is @xmath16",
    "first we prove that bell inequalities must be satisfied for lhv theories provided the detection efficiency factorises as a function of the measurement setting and a function of the hidden variable . for a stochastic local hidden - variable theory ,",
    "probabilities are given as @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the hidden variable .",
    "the state @xmath0 simply controls the probability distribution for @xmath18 . with loss , the probabilities @xmath6 can sum to less than 1 .",
    "summing over the measurement results gives the efficiencies as @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the single - party efficiency for party @xmath1 with measurement setting @xmath2 and hidden variable  @xmath18 .",
    "we also use the notation @xmath21 for the efficiency due to measurement setting @xmath2 for party @xmath1 , and @xmath22 for the efficiency due to the hidden variable for party @xmath1 . with this notation defined ,",
    "we can now state our condition rigorously .",
    "when the efficiency for each party factorises as @xmath23 the set of postselected probabilities that can be obtained @xmath24 is identical to that which can be obtained without postselection ( provided no efficiency is zero ) .",
    "this result means that this form of loss does not change the type of probability distributions that are possible with lhv models , and in particular any bell inequality must still be satisfied with postselection .",
    "the proof follows by showing that there exists a measurement scheme without postselection that yields the same probabilities as the @xmath25 for the postselected scheme .",
    "the postselected probabilities may alternatively be given by @xmath26 where @xmath27 this means that , by using a different lhv model with different probabilities , we may obtain exactly the same probability distribution for the measurement results as for the postselected case .",
    "this result shows that our condition is sufficient for bell inequalities to hold with postselection .",
    "we also have a necessity proof in the case of chsh - bell inequalities . before showing this result ,",
    "we first show the general form of the chsh - bell inequality with postelection .",
    "any local hidden variable theory must satisfy @xmath28 for given @xmath29 there exist probabilities @xmath30 that saturate this inequality .",
    "here we have used the same notation as for general bell inequalities , except we have used @xmath31 and @xmath32 for alice and bob s measurement settings , respectively .",
    "we use the superscript @xmath18 on @xmath9 and @xmath10 to indicate that these are chosen as a function of the hidden variable @xmath18 .    for a lhv theory ,",
    "the postselected chsh - bell quantity can be rewritten as @xmath33 where @xmath34 because the probabilities are non - negative , we have @xmath35 . considering arbitrary measurements for a given form of loss , we can choose the @xmath30 such that @xmath36 takes any value in the range @xmath37 $ ] .    because @xmath38 is linear in each of the @xmath36 , it is maximised ( or minimised ) by taking extreme values where @xmath39 . by appropriately choosing the signs , it is possible to make any one of the terms in the curly brackets in eq .",
    "negative , and the rest positive . changing",
    "the sign preserves the parity of the number of negative terms , so it is not possible to make all terms positive .    in particular",
    ", taking @xmath40 makes the last term negative .",
    "then changing @xmath41 to @xmath42 makes only the third term negative .",
    "alternatively , changing @xmath43 to @xmath44 makes only the second term negative , or changing @xmath41 to @xmath42 and @xmath45 to @xmath46 makes only the first term negative .",
    "to maximise @xmath38 , we take three terms positive and one negative for each value of @xmath18 .",
    "the value of @xmath38 will be maximised with the smallest term taken to be negative .",
    "that is , @xmath47 summing the first four terms in eq .",
    "gives @xmath38 equal to @xmath48    to change the overall sign , so one term is positive and the remaining are negative , we can change the sign of both @xmath45 and @xmath43 . using this",
    ", we can ensure that the largest three terms in eq .",
    "positive , and the smallest is positive .",
    "doing this for each value of @xmath18 , we simply obtain the negative of what was obtained before , and so obtain @xmath49 .",
    "we therefore find that the generalisation of the chsh - bell inequality for the case of postselection is @xmath50 , as given in eq .  .",
    "as the above argument is constructive , it shows how to choose probabilities @xmath30 in order to saturate this inequality .    using this result , we can prove the necessary and sufficient condition for the chsh - bell inequality to hold for lhv theories with postselection .",
    "we first prove the necessary and sufficient condition in an alternative form .",
    "[ lem2 ] the condition that @xmath51 is independent of @xmath9 and @xmath10 is necessary and sufficient for @xmath52 to be satisfied for all probabilities @xmath30 .",
    "in order for @xmath38 to satisfy the usual chsh - bell inequality , @xmath52 , the sum in eq .   must be equal to 1 .",
    "given that the condition is satisfied , we may take @xmath53 and @xmath54 for some arbitrary @xmath9 and @xmath10 in eq .",
    ", giving @xmath55 thus the condition is sufficient .    to prove necessity",
    ", we show that if the condition in lemma [ lem2 ] is not satisfied , then @xmath52 may be violated .",
    "if the condition is not satisfied for @xmath56 , then select @xmath9 and @xmath10 such that @xmath57 we than have @xmath58 as there exists a choice of probabilities @xmath30 which saturate the inequality , we can obtain @xmath59 .",
    "hence we may obtain @xmath59 if the condition in lemma [ lem2 ] is violated , and it is therefore a necessary condition .",
    "we can now use lemma [ lem2 ] to show that the factorisation condition is sufficient and necessary for the chsh - bell inequality .",
    "specifically , we have the following theorem .",
    "[ the2 ] the condition that the efficiency for each party factorises as @xmath60 is necessary and sufficient for @xmath52 to be satisfied for all probabilities @xmath30 ( provided no efficiency is zero ) .",
    "the proof proceeds simply by showing that the condition in lemma [ lem2 ] is equivalent to .",
    "first , it is trivial to show that eq .   implies the condition",
    "using eq .",
    "gives @xmath61 which is independent of @xmath9 and @xmath10 .    to show that the condition of lemma [ lem2 ] implies",
    ", we simply need to use it to define the quantities @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "let us define , for some @xmath62 , @xmath63 it remains to show that these definitions satisfy .",
    "we find that @xmath64 where in the second line we use the condition of lemma [ lem2 ] , and @xmath0 may be arbitrary . hence we find that @xmath65 is independent of @xmath62 , and we therefore have @xmath66    rearranging eq .",
    "to isolate @xmath67 gives @xmath68 taking the maximum over @xmath9 then yields @xmath69 where we have used @xmath70 .",
    "hence @xmath71 using this expression in eq .   gives @xmath72 thus we have shown that the definitions to satisfy eq .   provided the condition of lemma [ lem2 ] holds .",
    "hence we have shown that the condition of lemma [ lem2 ] and the condition are equivalent , and therefore theorem [ the2 ] follows from lemma [ lem2 ] .",
    "next we consider the restriction on the loss for quantum mechanics , rather than lhv theories .",
    "it might be thought that the case of quantum mechanics is equivalent , because a lhv theory can be thought of as an unentangled state , with the @xmath18 labeling orthogonal basis states .",
    "however , the case of quantum mechanics is slightly different , because we also need to consider all linear combinations of orthogonal basis states .    for quantum theory the probabilities of local measurement results",
    "are obtained via a positive operator - valued measure with elements @xmath73 , which corresponds to successful measurement result @xmath3 for measurement setting @xmath2 for party @xmath1 .",
    "we also use the notation @xmath74 for the operator corresponding to a successful measurement . here",
    "the sum is over all successful measurement results @xmath3 ; the measurement operator for failure is @xmath75 .",
    "the restriction on the loss in terms of hidden variables implies that @xmath76 this expression may be taken to be the definition of the restriction on the loss for quantum mechanics .",
    "this restriction may alternatively be expressed as @xmath77 = { { \\cal e}}_{\\rm r}(\\rho)\\prod_k { { \\cal e}}_{k{\\rm s}}(\\gamma_k).\\ ] ] let @xmath78 the restriction implies that @xmath79 independent of @xmath80 , and therefore @xmath81 is independent of @xmath80 .",
    "this is why no subscript @xmath80 is given for @xmath81 .",
    "thus the restriction in eq .",
    "implies that the @xmath82 are independent of @xmath2 .    using a similar method as for hidden variables",
    ", we can show that postselection with this form of loss can not change the form of probability distributions obtained , either for the case of entangled or unentangled states .",
    "in particular , the result is as in the following theorem .",
    "[ the3 ] for a bell experiment on a quantum mechanical system , provided the loss is restricted by @xmath83 the set of postselected probabilities it is possible to obtain without entanglement @xmath24 is identical to that which can be obtained without postselection or entanglement , and the set of postselected probabilities it is possible to obtain with entanglement is identical to that which can be obtained without postelection but with entanglement ( provided no efficiency is zero ) .",
    "we define new measurement operators as @xmath84 these measurement operators now give unit efficiency ( so there is no postselection ) .",
    "we also define @xmath85 where @xmath81 is defined as in eq .  .",
    "because we restrict to the case of incomplete loss , the measurement operators are positive and can be inverted .",
    "the new measurement operators and states give exactly the same probabilities _ without _ postselection as the original measurement operators and states did with postselection .    furthermore , because @xmath81 is a local operator , it can not produce entangled states from unentangled states .",
    "therefore the postselected bell experiment with an unentangled state gives postselected probabilities identical to the non - postselected probabilities for a different bell experiment with different measurement operators and a different unentangled state @xmath86 .",
    "this result means that , for an unentangled state , all bell inequalities must still be satisfied .",
    "this is exactly as we expect , because unentangled states may be regarded as equivalent to hidden variables .",
    "similarly , inequalities that hold for entangled states ( such as tsirelson s bound ) will be unaffected by the postselection .    for chsh - bell inequalities",
    ", it would be expected that eq .",
    "is also a necessary condition due to the result for hidden - variable theories .",
    "however , it does not directly follow , and necessity needs to be proven separately .",
    "this is because one can not arbitrarily choose the probabilities @xmath87 for given efficiencies .",
    "therefore it is not necessarily possible to achieve the maximum value of eq .",
    ", as in the case of a general hidden - variable theory . nevertheless , it is possible to show the result in the following theorem .",
    "[ the4 ] for a quantum mechanical system , the condition that the efficiency for each party factorises as @xmath88 is necessary and sufficient for @xmath52 to be satisfied for all probabilities @xmath30 ( provided no efficiency is zero ) .",
    "the sufficiency follows immediately from theorem [ the3 ] , so it only remains to show necessity .",
    "the condition in the theorem is equivalent to eq .  ,",
    "so we show necessity for eq .  .",
    "first consider the case where eq .",
    "is violated . in that case , either @xmath89 is dependent on @xmath9 , or @xmath90 is dependent on @xmath10 ( or both ) .",
    "we omit the subscripts @xmath91 and @xmath92 in the notation @xmath93 and @xmath94 for simplicity .",
    "the party is simply indicated by the symbol used for the measurement setting ( @xmath9 for party 1 and @xmath10 for party 2 ) .",
    "if @xmath89 ( for example ) is not independent of @xmath9 , then there exist orthogonal states @xmath95 and @xmath96 such that @xmath97 this result may be proven in the following way .",
    "let us assume that all orthogonal states give equality in .",
    "then , for any orthogonal basis @xmath98 , we have @xmath99 for some @xmath100 . therefore @xmath101 .",
    "now we can take @xmath102 to be the basis which diagonalises @xmath103 .",
    "then we have @xmath104 so @xmath105 . because @xmath106 is nonzero ( these are positive operators ) , we have @xmath107 . therefore the diagonal elements of @xmath103 must be zero in the basis @xmath102 .",
    "as this is the basis which diagonalises @xmath103 , we must have @xmath108 .",
    "hence we find that equality in implies @xmath108 , so if @xmath109 is not proportional to @xmath110 , then there must exist orthogonal states @xmath95 and @xmath96 such that is satisfied .",
    "we obtain the exact equivalent result if @xmath90 is not independent of @xmath10 . therefore , if eq .",
    "is violated , we can select @xmath111 and @xmath112 such that @xmath113 with strict inequality in at least one of these cases . we therefore have @xmath114    now consider the density operator @xmath115 for this density operator @xmath116}+ \\frac{\\langle\\delta m_{a}\\rangle_j\\langle\\delta m_{b}\\rangle_j } { { \\textrm{tr}}[(m_{a}\\otimes m_{b})\\rho]}\\right .",

    "given the @xmath119 , consider the measurement operators for the individual results given by @xmath120 using these measurement operators gives @xmath121 this gives the postselected bell quantity as @xmath122 equation may be rearranged to give @xmath123 we therefore obtain @xmath124 .",
    "thus we find that , if eq .",
    "is not satisfied , for given @xmath119 there exists a separable state and a set of measurement operators @xmath125 such that @xmath124 .",

    "however , it turns out that it is not necessary . in particular",

    ", there is violation of tsirelson s bound , but for larger values no violation of tsirelson s bound is achieved .",
    "this indicates that there is not a simple necessary and sufficient condition in the case of tsirelson s bound .",
    "whether tsirelson s bound can be violated depends on the particular value of the loss .     with @xmath131 and @xmath132 .",
    "tsirelson s bound is shown as the dotted line for comparison.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    an interesting fact is that if the condition is violated for both parties , in the sense that @xmath82 is dependent on @xmath2 for both alice and bob , then it is always possible to find measurements such that tsirelson s bound is violated .",
    "a scheme for doing this is presented in appendix [ symtsi ] .",
    "a central motivation for this work was to determine forms of loss that can violate tsirelson s bound while ensuring that the chsh - bell inequality is still valid , in order to generalise ref .",
    "the result of the previous section is that the form of postselection that is necessary for the chsh - bell inequality to hold for unentangled states ( as shown in theorem [ the4 ] ) also implies that tsirelson s bound holds for entangled states ( as follows from theorem [ the3 ] ) .",
    "this raises the question of how the postselection in ref .",
    "@xcite differs from the postselection used here .",
    "the difference is that the postselection relies on the experimenter knowing what the state is .",
    "this method for constructing bell inequalities is criticised in ref .",
    "@xcite , because it introduces an additional assumption beyond locality and realism .",
    "if an entangled state is incorrectly assumed , but the actual state is unentangled , then the method of ref .  @xcite still yields a violation of the bell inequality ( see appendix [ sec : cab ] ) .",
    "we therefore avoid the approach of assuming a state here , and simply allow postselection that may depend on the state and measurement setting .",
    "a crucial subtlety in our results is that the condition is necessary for the chsh - bell inequality to be satisfied for unentangled states , provided we consider arbitrary measurement schemes for the given form of loss .",
    "this does not eliminate the possibility that there are particular measurement schemes with postselection such that the bell inequality is satisfied for unentangled states but tsirelson s bound may be violated for entangled states .",
    "we consider such a scheme in this section .",
    "we emphasise that this scheme does not violate the bell inequality with unentangled states _ provided _ the measurements are acting as expected .",
    "but , if there is an underlying hidden variable theory , or equivalently if the measurements are not acting as expected on the underlying quantum state , then the chsh - bell inequality can be violated without entanglement .",
    "the advantage of this postselection is that it also increases the bell quantity that may be obtained with entanglement .",
    "the standard result that the efficiency must be at least @xmath133 with maximally entangled states @xcite is based upon the assumption that tsirelson s bound still holds for entangled states .",
    "if the bell quantity is also enhanced for entangled states , then the efficiency may be lower before the value that is possible with a lhv theory reaches that possible with entangled states .",
    "the example we consider is where alice and bob share the two - qubit entangled state @xmath134 where @xmath135 is the normalisation factor .",
