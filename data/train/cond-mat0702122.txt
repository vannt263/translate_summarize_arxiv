    "the remarkable recent advances in handling ultra - cold atomic gases have given birth to a new field : condensed matter physics with light and atoms .",

    "@xcite , and other lectures in this volume ) .",
    "key issues in the physics of strongly correlated quantum systems can be addressed from a new perspective in this context .",
    "the observation of the mott transition of bosons in optical lattices  @xcite and of the superfluidity of fermionic gases ( see e.g.  @xcite ) have been important milestones in this respect , as well as the recent imaging of fermi surfaces  @xcite .    to quote just a few of the many promising roads for research with ultra - cold fermionic atoms in optical lattices , i would emphasize :    * the possibility of studying and hopefully understanding better some outstanding open problems of condensed matter physics , particularly in strongly correlated regimes , such as high - temperature superconductivity and its interplay with mott localization .",
    "* the possibility of studying these systems in regimes which are not usually reachable in condensed matter physics ( e.g under time - dependent perturbations bringing the system out of equilibrium ) , and to do this within a highly controllable and clean setting * the possibility of `` engineering '' the many - body wave function of large quantum systems by manipulating atoms individually or globally    the present lecture notes certainly do not aim at covering all these topics !",
    "rather , they represent an idiosyncratic choice reflecting the interests of the author .",
    "hopefully , they will contribute in a positive manner to the rapidly developing dialogue between condensed matter physics and the physics of ultra - cold atoms .",
    "finally , a warning and an apology : these are lecture notes and not a review article .",
    "even though i do quote some of the original work i refer to , i have certainly omitted important relevant references , for which i apologize in advance .",
    "in the context of optical lattices , it is convenient to express energies in units of the _ recoil energy _ : e_r= in which @xmath0 is the wavevector of the laser and @xmath1 the mass of the atoms .",
    "this is typically of the order of a few micro - kelvins ( for a yag laser with @xmath2 and 6 atoms , @xmath3 ) .",
    "when venturing in the cold atoms community , condensed matter physicists who usually express energy scales in kelvins ( or electron - volts ... ! ) will need to remember that , in units of frequency : 1k20.8khz    the natural scale for the kinetic energy ( and fermi energy ) of atoms in the optical lattice is not the recoil energy however , but rather the bandwidth @xmath4 of the bloch band under consideration , which strongly depends on the laser intensity @xmath5 . for a weak intensity @xmath6 , the bandwidth @xmath4 of the lowest bloch band in the optical lattice is of order @xmath7 itself ( the free space parabolic dispersion @xmath8 reaches the boundary of the first brillouin zone at @xmath9 with @xmath10 the lattice spacing , so that @xmath11 for small @xmath12 ) .",
    "in contrast , for strong laser intensities , the bandwidth can be much smaller than the recoil energy ( fig .",
    "[ fig : bandwidth ] ) .",
    "this is because in this limit the motion of atoms in the lattice corresponds to tunneling between two neighboring potential wells ( lattice sites ) , and the hopping amplitude   for the hopping amplitude in the lattice , as often done in the quantum optics community .",
    "indeed , @xmath13 is so commonly used in condensed matter physics to denote the magnetic superexchange interaction that this can be confusing .",
    "i therefore stick to the condensed matter notation @xmath14 , not to be confused of course with time @xmath15 , but it is usually clear from the context . ]",
    "@xmath14 has the typical exponential dependence of a tunnel process .",
    "specifically , for a simple separable potential in @xmath16 ( = @xmath17 ) dimensions : v()= v_0_i=1^d ^2 k_l r_i [ eq : sep_potential ] one has  @xcite : /e_r = 4 ^ -1/2 ( v_0/e_r)^3/4 e^-2(v_0/e_r)^1/2 , v_0e_r [ eq : hop_deep ] the dispersion of the lowest band is well approximated by a simple tight - binding expression in this limit : _ = -2_i=1^d k_i corresponding to a bandwidth @xmath18 .",
    "the dependence of the bandwidth , and of the gap between the first two bands , on @xmath12 are displayed on fig .",

    "( adapted from ref .",
    "note that in 3 dimensions , the two lowest bands overlap for a weak lattice potential , and become separated only for @xmath19.,width=264 ]    since @xmath4 is much smaller than @xmath7 for deep lattices , one may worry that cooling the gas into the degenerate regime might become very difficult . for non - interacting atoms ,",
    "this indeed requires @xmath20 , with @xmath21 the fermi energy ( energy of the highest occupied state ) , with @xmath22 for densities such that only the lowest band is partially occupied .",
    "adiabatic cooling may however come to the rescue when the lattice is gradually turned on  @xcite .",
    "this can be understood from a very simple argument , observing that the entropy of a non - interacting fermi gas in the degenerate regime is limited by the pauli principle to have a linear dependence on temperature : std(_f ) where @xmath23 is the density of states .",
    "hence , @xmath24 is expected to be conserved along constant entropy trajectories .",
    "@xmath25 is inversely proportional to the bandwidth @xmath4 ( with a proportionality factor depending on the density , or band filling ) : the density of states is enhanced considerably as the band shrinks since the one - particle states all fit in a smaller and smaller energy window .",
    "thus , @xmath26 is expected to be essentially constant as the lattice is adiabatically turned on : the degree of degeneracy is preserved and adiabatic cooling is expected to take place .",
    "for more details on this issue , see ref .",
    "@xcite in which it is also shown that when the second band is populated , heating can take place when the lattice is turned on ( because of the increase of the inter - band gap , cf . fig .",

    "heating effects upon turning on the lattice , see also ref .",
    "interactions can significantly modify these effects , and lead to additional mechanisms of adiabatic cooling , as discussed later in these notes ( sec .",
    "[ sec : cool ] ) .    finally , it is important to note that , in a strongly correlated system , characteristic energy scales are in general strongly modified by interaction effects in comparison to their bare , non - interacting values .",
    "the effective mass of quasiparticle excitations , for example , can become very large due to strong interaction effects , and correspondingly the scale associated with kinetic energy may become very small .",
    "this will also be the scale below which coherent quasiparticle excitations exist , and hence the effective scale for fermi degeneracy .",

    "i do not intend to review here in details the basic principles behind the trapping and manipulation of cold atoms in optical lattices .",
    "other lectures at this school are covering this , and there are also excellent reviews on the subject , see e.g refs .",
    "i will instead only summarize the basic principles behind the derivation of the effective hamiltonian .",
    "the focus of this section will be to emphasize that there are some limits on the range of parameters in which the effective hamiltonian takes the simple single - band hubbard form  @xcite .",
    "i consider two - component fermions ( e.g two hyperfine states of identical atomic species ) .",
    "the hamiltonian consists in a one - body term and an interaction term : h = h_0 + h_int let me first discuss the one - body part , which involves the lattice potential @xmath27 as well as the potential of the trap ( or of the gaussian waist of the laser ) @xmath28 : h_0 = _ d _ ^ ( ) _ ( ) h_0l + h_0 t the trapping potential having a shallow curvature as compared to the lattice spacing , the standard procedure consists in finding first the bloch states of the periodic potential ( e.g treating afterwards the trap in the local density approximation ) .",

    "the function has the symmetry of the square lattice , and has secondary maxima on nearest - neighbor sites .",

    "e^i(-)_= -d w_^*(-)w_(- ) [ eq : hoppings ] _ 0=__because the bloch functions diagonalize the one - body hamiltonian , there are no inter - band hopping terms in the wannier representation considered here .",
    "furthermore , for a separable potential such as ( [ eq : sep_potential ] ) , close examination of ( [ eq : hoppings ] ) show that the oppings are only along the principal axis of the lattice : the hopping amplitudes along diagonals vanish for a separable potential ( see also sec .  [",
    "sec : frust ] ) .",
    "let us now turn to the interaction hamiltonian . the inter - particle distance and lattice spacing are generally much larger than the hard - core radius of the inter - atomic potential .",
    "hence , the details of the potential at short distance do not matter .",
    "long distance properties of the potential are characterized by the _ scattering length _ @xmath39 .",
    "as is well known , and described elsewhere in these lectures , @xmath39 can be tuned over a wide range of positive or negative values by varying the magnetic field close to a feshbach resonance .",
    "provided the extent of the wannier function is larger than the scattering length ( @xmath40 ) , the following pseudopotential can be used : v^,-_int(-)=g(-),g [ eq : pseudopot ] the interaction hamiltonian then reads : h_int = gd ^ _ ( ) _ ( ) ^ _ ( ) _ ( ) which can be written in the basis set of wannier functions ( assumed for simplicity to be real ) as follows : h_int=__1_2_3_4__1_2_3_4 u__1_2_3_4^_1_2_3_4 c^__1_1c__2_2 c^__3_3c__4_4 with : u__1_2_3_4^_1_2_3_4=g d w__1(-_1)w__2(-_2 ) w__3(-_3)w__4(-_4 ) the largest interaction term corresponds to two atoms on the same lattice site .",
    "furthermore , for a deep enough lattice , with less than two atoms per site on average , the second band is well separated from the lowest one .",

    ". hence one must have @xmath47 .",
    "for the pseudopotential to be valid ( assumption -iii ) , the typical distance between two atoms in a lattice well ( which is given by the extension of the wannier function @xmath41 ) must be larger than the scattering length : @xmath40 .",
    "amusingly , for deep lattices , this actually coincides with the requirement @xmath48 and boils down to ( at large @xmath12 ) : ( ) ^-1/4 [ eq : condition ] in order to see this , one simply has to use the above estimates of @xmath41 ( @xmath49 ) and @xmath50 ( @xmath51 ) and that of the separation @xmath52 in this limit .",
    "( [ eq : condition ] ) actually shows that for a deep lattice , the scattering length should not be increased too much if one wants to keep a hubbard model with an interaction set by the scattering length itself and given by ( [ eq : u_deep ] ) . for larger values of @xmath39 , it may be that a one - band hubbard description still applies ( see however below for the possible appearance of new interaction terms ) , but with an effective @xmath42 given by the inter - band separation @xmath53 rather than set by @xmath39 .",
    "this requires a more precise investigation of the specific case at hand  .    finally , the possible existence of other interaction terms besides the on - site @xmath42 ( -ii ) , and when they can be neglected , requires a more careful examination .",

    "viewed from this perspective , strongly correlated quantum systems raise questions which are at the heart of the quantum mechanical world .    the most dramatic example is the possibility of a phase transition between two states : one in which atoms behave in an itinerant manner , and one in which they are localized by the strong on - site repulsion in the potential wells of a deep lattice . in the mott insulating case ,",
    "the energy gain which could be obtained by tunneling between lattice sites ( @xmath63 ) becomes unfavorable in comparison to the cost of creating doubly occupied lattice sites ( @xmath64 ) .",

    "the low - energy excitations are built out of _ quasiparticles _ , long - lived ( coherent ) entities carrying the same quantum numbers than the original particles .",
    "there are three key quantities characterizing the quasiparticle excitations :    * their dispersion relation , i.e the energy @xmath221 ( measured from the ground - state energy ) necessary to create such an excitation with ( quasi- ) momentum @xmath222 .",

    ", this happens in a specific manner ( for phase - space reasons ) , as @xmath229 .",
    "this insures the overall coherence of the description in terms of quasiparticles , since their inverse lifetime vanishes faster than their energy .",
    "typical signatures of strong correlations are the following effects ( not necessarily occurring simultaneously in a given system ) : i ) strongly renormalized fermi velocities , as compared to the non - interacting ( band ) value , corresponding e.g to a large interaction - induced enhancement of the effective mass of the quasiparticles , ii ) a strongly suppressed quasiparticle spectral weight @xmath230 , possibly non - uniform along the fermi surface , iii ) short quasiparticle lifetimes .",
    "these strong deviations from the non - interacting system can sometimes be considerable : the `` heavy fermion '' materials for example ( rare - earth compounds ) have quasiparticle effective masses which are several hundred times bigger than the mass from band theory , and in spite of this are mostly well described by fermi liquid theory .",
    "the quasiparticle description applies only at low energy , below some characteristic energy ( and temperature ) scale @xmath231 , the quasiparticle coherence scale .",
    "close to the fermi surface , the one - particle spectral function displays a clear separation of energy scales , with a sharp coherent peak carrying spectral weight @xmath232 corresponding to quasiparticles ( a peak well - resolved in energy means long - lived excitations ) , and an `` incoherent '' background carrying spectral weight @xmath233 . a convenient form to have in mind ( fig .  [",
    "fig : raman ] ) is : a ( , ) z_+a_inc ( , ) hence , measuring the spectral function , and most notably the evolution of the quasiparticle peak as the momentum is swept through the fermi surface , allows one to probe the key properties of the quasiparticle excitations : their dispersion ( position of the peak ) , lifetime ( width of the peak ) and spectral weight ( normalized to the incoherent background , when possible ) , as well of course as the location of the fermi surface of the interacting system in the brillouin zone . in @xcite",

    "close to the mott transition , we expect at least one kind of well - defined high energy excitations to show up in this incoherent spectrum . these are the excitations which consist in removing a particle from a site which is already occupied , or adding a particle on such a site .",
    "the energy difference separating these two excitations is precisely the hubbard interaction @xmath42 .",
    "these excitations , which are easier to think about in a local picture in real - space ( in contrast to the wave - like , quasiparticle excitations ) , form two broad dispersing peaks in the spectral functions : the so - called hubbard `` bands '' .    in the mean - field ( dmft ) description of interacting fermions and of the mott transition ,",
    "the quasiparticle weight @xmath234 is uniform along the fermi surface .",
    "close to the mott transition , @xmath234 vanishes and the effective mass ( @xmath235 in this theory ) of quasiparticles diverges .",
    "the quasiparticle coherence scale is @xmath236 , with @xmath237 the fermi energy ( @xmath238 bandwidth ) of the non - interacting system : this coherence scale also becomes very small close to the transition , and hubbard bands carry most of the spectral weight in this regime .",

    "strong departure from fermi liquid theory is observed .",
    "most notably , at doping levels smaller than the optimal doping ( where the superconducting @xmath112 is maximum ) , i.e in the so - called `` underdoped '' regime :    * reasonably well - defined quasiparticles are only observed close to the diagonals of the brillouin zone , i.e close to the `` nodal points '' of the fermi surface where the superconducting gap vanishes .",
    "even there , the lifetimes are shorter and appear to have a different energy and temperature dependence than that of fermi liquid theory . * in the opposite regions of the fermi surface ( `` antinodal '' regions ) , the spectral function shows no sign of a quasiparticle pleak in the normal state . instead , a very broad lineshape is found in arpes , whose leading edge is _ not centered at @xmath239 _ , but rather at a finite energy scale .",
    "the spectral function appears to have its maximum away from the fermi surface , i.e the density of low - energy excitations is strongly depleted at low - energy : this is the `` pseudo - gap '' phenomenon .",
    "the pseudo - gap shows up in many other kinds of measurements in the under - doped regime .",
    "hence , there is a strong dichotomy between the nodal and antinodal regions in the normal state .",
    "the origin of this dichotomy is one of the key issues in the field .",
    "one possibility is that the pseudo - gap is due to a hidden form of long - range order which competes with superconductivity and is responsible for suppressing excitations except in nodal regions .",
    "another possibility is that , because of the proximity to the mott transition in such low - dimensional systems , the quasiparticle coherence scale ( and most likely also the quasiparticle weight ) varies strongly along the fermi surface , hence suppressing quasiparticles in regions where the coherence scale is smaller than temperature .",
    "this nodal - antinodal dichotomy is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : nodal ] .",
    "this figure has actually been obtained from a simulated intensity plot of the raman rate ( [ eq : rate2 ] ) , using a phenomenological form of the spectral function appropriate for cuprates .",
