    "the argument is as in ( 1 ) .",
    "examples of the allowed fundamental groups are @xmath590 , @xmath591 , @xmath592 , @xmath593 .",
    "we now assume that @xmath1 is a closed , connected contact manifold of dimension @xmath481 , @xmath11 , that admits a @xmath5-subcritical stein filling @xmath16 , that is , where the stein handles are all of index at most @xmath594 . in particular , we have @xmath505 . under this assumption , we want to formulate topological conditions on @xmath22 that allow us to classify all subcritical fillings up to symplectomorphism .    for the notion of stein deformation equivalence see  @xcite .",
    "deformation equivalent stein fillings are symplectomorphic in the sense of  @xcite .",
    "the concept of flexible stein fillings is defined in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* definition  11.29 ) . suffice it to say here that all subcritical stein fillings are flexible .",
    "[ thm : flexible ] let @xmath1 be a @xmath17-dimensional closed , connected contact manifold , @xmath11 , admitting a @xmath5-subcritical stein filling @xmath16 .",
    "further , we make the following topological assumptions :        the assumptions of the theorem are satisfied by @xmath10 and by any sphere bundle @xmath597 with its standard contact structure , provided @xmath578 , @xmath575 , and @xmath298 is a lie group or satisfies the homological assumption ( ii ) on coverings .    given a flexible stein filling @xmath0 of  @xmath1 , we consider the cobordism @xmath426 as in section  [ section : filling ] . as we saw in the proof of theorem  [ thm :",
    "w - simeq - w0 ] , the lower inclusion @xmath416 is a homotopy equivalence .",
    "the topological condition ( ii ) guarantees that the upper inclusion is likewise a homotopy equivalence , see section  [ section : simple ] for the case that @xmath22 is a simple space , and the argument in example  [ ex : q2 ]  ( 2 ) for the case when the homological information on @xmath565 is given .",
    "together with condition  ( i ) this implies that @xmath426 is an @xmath432-cobordism , so that @xmath12 and @xmath24 are diffeomorphic .",
    "we now want to construct a stein structure on the cobordism @xmath426 . to this end , consider a stein structure on @xmath44 with two @xmath332-handles and one @xmath87-handle ; the gradient flow of the plurisubharmonic potential is shown in figure  [ figure : stein - c ] .",
    "the assumption on @xmath24 being @xmath5-subcritical translates into saying that the stein manifold @xmath33  in the notation of section  [ section : proof - homology ]  has a plurisubharmonic potential @xmath34 with finitely many critical points up to index @xmath594 only . on the product @xmath41",
    "we then still have a subcritical potential  @xmath52 .",
    "each critical point of @xmath34 gives rise to three critical points of  @xmath52 ; the ones sitting over the index  @xmath87 point in @xmath44 have their index shifted up by  @xmath87 .",
    "now we build the cobordism @xmath410 as before , where the copy of @xmath24 that is replaced by @xmath12 and the copy of @xmath24 that is removed are each placed , in the @xmath44-direction , in a neighbourhood of one of the critical points of index  @xmath332 .",
    "this induces a stein structure on the cobordism .",
    "this structure is flexible since , apart from the flexible handles coming from @xmath12 , it only contains subcritical handles .",
    "so the theorem follows from the stein @xmath371-cobordism theorem  ( * ? ? ?",
