    "a range of materials modelling techniques have been applied to gan in the past .",
    "these include analytical pairwise potential@xcite and electronic structure studies@xcite .",

    "the high thermal stability of gan with respect to oxygen is therefore kinetic in nature .",
    "the transformation matrices in table  [ table : transf ] were applied with the vesta software package@xcite to form supercells from the relaxed gan unit cell .",
