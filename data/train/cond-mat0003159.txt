    "several years ago  @xcite , dzugutov introduced a new model pair potential for the purpose of studying glass transitions by means of molecular dynamics ( md ) simulation .",
    "most simulations of glass transitions to date have been performed using binary mixtures , since one - component simple liquids , when supercooled , readily nucleate crystallites .",
    "the dzugutov potential , which features a pronounced maximum at a range typical of next - nearest - neighbor coordination distances in close - packed crystals , suppresses crystallization by construction , and thus facilitates glass formation .",
    "following its initial successful use in studies of supercooled liquids  @xcite , the dzugutov potential was subsequently adopted in simulations of freezing  @xcite .",
    "contrary to expectations , however , the observed solid structure was determined to be , remarkably , a monatomic dodecagonal quasicrystal .",
    "the structure , also known as tetrahedrally or topologically close packed ( tcp )  @xcite , is of the frank - kasper type and is composed of layers of square - triangle tilings . in previous work , the dzugutov potential and the associated dodecagonal structure have been used to study self - diffusion in quasicrystals  @xcite .    the motivation for the present work stems primarily from our interest in the nucleation and stability of quasicrystal phases .",
    "further motivation comes from the realm of colloid physics , where , given the extreme tunability of colloidal interparticle interactions , it is conceivable that a dzugutov - like pair potential might be engineered to produce bulk samples of one - component quasicrystals  @xcite .",
    "the main purpose of the study reported here is to chart , by means of both md simulation and thermodynamic perturbation theory , the fluid - solid phase diagram of the dzugutov - potential system .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ simul ] , after specifying the pair potential , we give details of the simulation methods , and describe our analyses of the resulting solid structures .",
    "section [ theory ] outlines the theoretical methods used , while section [ struct ] characterizes the quasicrystal and other structures of interest . in section [ cogro ] we present results  from both simulation and theory  for relative stabilities of competing solid structures . among our main results",
    ", we find that ( 1 ) at low temperatures and pressures , the stable solid structure is the bcc crystal ; ( 2 ) at high pressures , the stable solid is the fcc crystal ; and ( 3 ) the stable ground state ( @xmath1 ) is never the dodecagonal quasicrystal , but rather a periodic crystal whose structure depends on the pressure .",
    "finally , in section [ discus ] we summarize and discuss implications of the results for future work .",
