    "the experimental status of general relativity ( gr ) , regarding the solar system tests  @xcite and the detection of signals consistent with the merge of two black holes by the ligo collaboration  @xcite , have settled it as the most successful theory of gravity .",
    "however , the difficulties on finding out explanations for the so - called _ dark sector _ of the universe , have driven the community to think that gr is not the ultimate gravitational theory .    the _ dark sector _ of the universe",
    "is composed by two kinds of degrees of freedom .",
    "on the one hand , the gravitational lensing produced by the local distribution of energy , suggests the presence of an exotic form of matter unseen by the current light - based telescopes  @xcite . for this",
    "it is named dark matter and it would interact mostly ( if not only ) through gravity .",
    "such an abundance at the galactic scale is compatible with the velocity profile of stars at its outter regions  @xcite . at the cosmic scale",
    ", it plays a key role in the origin and evolution of structures ( see , for instance ref .",
    "@xcite ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the experimental data obtained from type ia supernovae observations , indicates that our universe is passing through a phase of accelerated expansion  @xcite .",
    "this behavior suggests the existence of an exotic form of energy , called dark energy , which constitutes roughly the @xmath1 of the current content of our universe .",
    "the shortcomings of gr on describing these phenomena , are the main motivation to look for new gravitational degrees of freedom . among the possible extensions",
    ", higher dimensional models could shed some light on the nature of these new degrees of freedom .",
    "for instance , as it was shown in the early works of t.  kaluza and o.  klein , the existence of an extra dimension within the gr framework would give rise to a unified picture of gravity and electromagnetism , along with a spectrum of new heavy particles  @xcite .",
    "this idea opened the possibility of a novel geometrical understanding of interactions , where the gauge group arise as a consequence of the topology of the spatial compact manifold in a higher dimensional spacetime .",
    "the idea of higher dimensions comes naturally in diverse physical models , as for example : supersymmetry and supergravity  @xcite , string theory  @xcite , and novel proposals by arkani - hammed , dimopoulos and dvali  @xcite , and randall and sundrum  @xcite models , as attempts to solve the hierarchy problem .    in four dimensions , the einstein ",
    "hilbert action with cosmological constant is the most general theory which leads to second order field equations for the metric . in higher dimensions , however , particular combinations of higher order terms in the curvature can be added to the gravitational action , whose variation with respect to the metric yields also second order field equations .",

    "hilbert lagrangian in arbitrary dimensions  @xcite .    the simplest possible extra term in the lanczos  lovelock action is a quadratic construction of curvatures , called gauss  bonnet term , which reads @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the riemannian curvature of a manifold with metric @xmath4 and @xmath5 its determinant . @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the ricci tensor and ricci scalar , respectively . in four dimensions",

    "it is worth mentioning that , classically , wormholes must be supported by a kind of energy compatible with the cosmological hypothesis .",
    "their existence in these extended models implies the presence of degrees of freedom that could provide an explanation for the exotic matter / energy abundance in the universe .    on the other hand ,",
    "it is well - known that gr assume the torsion - free condition _ a priori_. however , as e.  cartan first considered , it is possible to take metricity and parallelism as truly independent concepts  @xcite . such kind of geometries are known as riemann  cartan and offer the natural framework for poincar gauge theories , where the torsion appears as the field strength of translations , sourced by the spin - current  @xcite .",

    "in this work we have presented the dimensional reduction of the five - dimensional lovelock  cartan theory introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite , under the assumption that the compact dimension has @xmath0 topology",
    ". an interesting feature of these theories is that , unlike the einstein ",
    "cartan theory , torsion is allowed to propagate .    in the generic reduction ,",
    "the effective theory has a spin-2 particle , a spin-1 @xmath96 gauge boson , and a spin-0 scalar particle coming from the decomposition of the metric , while the decomposition of the spin connection introduces three extra fields : two spin-1 particles , @xmath50 and @xmath55 , and the 1-form @xmath137 yields a new spin-2 , a spin-1 and a spin-0 particles .",
    "these new fields do not transform under the gauge group ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : bianchi ] ) .",
    "we used the most general ansatz compatible with the cosmological symmetries ( see appendix  [ homotropic ] ) to find solutions of the friedmann ",
    "walker class in the four - dimensional theory .",
    "the field equations for the cosmological ansatz ensure that the solutions with nontrivial torsion have vanishing @xmath50 and @xmath137 .",
    "the solutions are parametrized by @xmath106 , related to the fundamental couplings of the theory through the eq .  , and exhibit three different sectors depending on whether this parameter is positive , negative or zero .",
    "the behavior of the universes described by our solutions is four - fold : ( i )  eternal expansion , ( ii )  eternal contraction , ( iii )  initial expansion with asymptotic contraction , and ( iv )  bouncing . in some cases , the solutions do not start from an initial singularity .",
    "the size of the extra dimension is driven by the scalar field @xmath126 and its behavior at late times is compatible with a dynamical mechanism for compactification , at certain regions of the parameter space ( see figs .",
    "[ phi_u_0 ] and  [ phi_u_neg ] ) .",
    "the field equation   admits the interpretation of the einstein equations , where the energy - momentum @xmath138-form is induced by the torsion and the extra dimensional degrees of freedom .",
    "it is important to mention that the induced energy - momentum form is nonstandard , in the sense that it inherit a coupling between matter and curvature ( see eq .   for the definition ) .",
    "moreover , the energy density and the pressure are not positive definite , providing a playground for a gravitational explanation for the accelerated expansion of the universe .    as we can see from eq .",
    ", @xmath146 corresponds to the completely antisymmetric part of torsion .",
    "its solution given in eq .",
    "shows that it can be imaginary for certain periods of time .",
    "additionally , it is the only function sensitive to the value of @xmath147 .",
    "thus , if a reality condition is imposed over @xmath146 for certain values of the coupling constants , it would provide a distinction criteria among open , flat and closed universes . in the light of this and",
    "given the experimental evidence supporting the flatness of the universe ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) is that we restrict the discussion to the case where @xmath148 .",
    "can be studied analogously .",

    "a similar behavior for this function was found in ref .",
    "@xcite . notice that the antisymmetric part of torsion is unseen by classical particles following geodesics and it does not couple minimally to spin-0 or spin-1 bosons .",
    "however , it appears as an effective interaction term for the dirac lagrangian in spacetimes with torsion  @xcite @xmath150 which couples to the fermionic axial current . for imaginary values of @xmath91 ,",
    "the authors in ref .",
    "@xcite argued that the loss of unitarity and the violation of the current conservation can be interpreted as particle creation .",
    "the vacuum cosmological solutions presented here provide a useful arena to isolate the effects of the induced fields and probe their consequences in physically important scenarios . in that sense , and since they are absent in the cosmological ansatz , a four - dimensional isotropic configuration might contribute to interpret the @xmath50 and @xmath137 fields as gravitational hairs in black hole solutions , or wormhole supporting matter .",
    "the gravitational principles we take for granted can be relaxed to construct a logically consistent theory .",
    "this approach might provide an explanation for the phenomena at the limit of the current understanding of the universe , such as its content and evolution .",
    "this work shows that the renounce to the metric description of gravity , attached to a higher dimensional spacetime , can radically affect the way we perceive the gravitational degrees of freedom and , therefore , what our measurements read as the energy content of the universe .",
