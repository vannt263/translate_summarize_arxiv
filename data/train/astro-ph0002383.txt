    "a first estimate of the total number of variable stars observable by gaia was done by eyer ( 1999 ) .",
    "the star population used came from the star - count model of figueras  et  al .",
    "( 1999 ) and the variability detection threshold was derived from the hipparcos survey results . with the new qualifications of the gaia mission ,",
    "about 1 billion stars ( up to mag  g@xmath020 ) are expected to be observed , with about 18  million variable stars , including about 5  million `` classic '' periodic variables .",
    "+ very different star counts are obtained according to the extinction laws used ( figueras , private communication ) .",
    "since the quality of the gaia photometry in the crowded fields is still uncertain , we can not discuss here the number of variables in dense clusters and galaxies .",
    "+ about 2 to 3 millions eclipsing binaries will be observed , but their detection probability will be studied in detail in the future . about 300000 stars with rotation induced variability can be expected as well .",
    "for a specific interval of v - i , we computed the proportion of variables in the hipparcos survey and we applied that rate to the number of stars obtained from the figueras model ( method  a ) .",
    "surface densities were calculated , either from the hipparcos parallaxes or from the specific properties of the stars .",
    "we integrated and removed the stars behind the bulge ( method  b ) .",
    "we extrapolated the gcvs data ( kholopov et al . , 1998 ) assuming detection completeness up to a certain magnitude and a magnitude limit for the population beyond which no more stars are present ( method  c ) .",
    "we also analysed the detection rates of the microlensing surveys ( when available ) and scanned the literature .",
    "method a and c estimate the number of @xmath1 cephei stars to be about 3000 .",
    "15000 spb variables will be detected according to method a. applying method a and c gave about the same estimate for @xmath2 scuti stars : 60000 .",
    "however , it will be very difficult to analyse the very reddened low amplitude variables . with method",
    "b even higher numbers as 240000 @xmath2  scuti stars show up .",
    "+ with a total number of rr lyrae as given by suntzeff et al .",
    "( 1991 ) we arrive at 70000 observable rr  lyrae ( method  b ) . using the ogle and macho detection rates , we expect 15000 to 40000 rr lyrae in the bulge .",
    "+ all galactic cepheids are within the observational range of gaia , if not too obscured by interstellar extinction .",
    "results of recent deep surveys confirm the early estimates of a total of 2000 to 8000 cepheids . with the help of the fernie database ( 1995 ) , we obtained ( method b ) a density of 15 - 20 cepheids/@xmath3 , leading to an estimate of 52006900 observable stars .",
    "+ early estimates gave in total 200000 mira and related long period variables in the galaxy .",
    "with 500  miras/@xmath3 , 140000 to 170000 miras will be observable .",
    "method b gave us a density of 250 - 350 semi - regular variables/@xmath3 or a total of 100000 observable sr stars .",
    "+ we plan to calculate and analyse all categories of variables stars in more detail to arrive at reliable estimates of all observable variable stars in the galaxy .",
    "an example : the international liquid mirrortelescope ( ilmt ) . + ( see ` http://vela.astro.ulg.ac.be/themes/telins/lmt/index_e.html ` ) + an international group of institutions are actively interested in developing a 4-m class liquid mirror telescope . if the view of the ilmt includes fields near the galactic center and all stars from r magnitude 17 up to 20 can be measured with high precision ( @xmath4 0.01 mag ) , the project will yield a unique time series of about 2 million stars with a total of 500 measurements of each star during 5 years .",
    "about 10000 new variable stars can be expected , including 6000 faint eclipsing binaries , 200 rr lyrae and 300 long periodic variables .",
