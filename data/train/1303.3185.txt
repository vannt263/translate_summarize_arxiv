    "jacobson s thermodynamic derivation of the einstein equations  @xcite has had , and continues to have , a profound influence on our understanding of the interface between thermodynamics and geometry .",
    "jacobson s original construction associated heat fluxes and entropies only to local rindler horizons  @xcite , but left open the question as to whether some suitable notion of entropy could meaningfully be assigned to a broader class of null causal surfaces .",
    "the construction presented in the current article addresses this point , and is considerably more general than jacobson s approach .",
    "we shall soon see that while the bifurcate nature of the local rindler horizon is essential to the construction , other rindler - specific features can easily be discarded . in particular , any null surface can be viewed as an observer - dependent causal boundary , a `` virtual '' causal boundary or virtual local horizon  and our construction can be viewed as providing a notion of virtual entropy for matter crossing _",
    "arbitrary _ bifurcate virtual causal horizons .",
    "ultimately , we will argue that for arbitrary bifurcate null surfaces in curved spacetime , at arbitrary cross - section @xmath1 of the null surface , it is meaningful to define a clausius entropy ( @xmath2 entropy ) in terms of the bifurcation two - surface @xmath3 , and the affinely parameterized null generators : @xmath4 since this argued to hold for arbitrary  virtual \" null surfaces , this can be viewed as thereby undermining the ontological reality of entropy ; modulo some technical assumptions that we shall be very careful to make explicitly clear .",
    "indeed , the ontological status of entropy continues to generate much heated and inconclusive debate .",
    "key questions are : is entropy objectively `` real '' ? or is entropy in some sense subjective and observer - dependent ?",
    "part of the issue is that there are many different notions of entropy , and the extent to which they are _ universally _ equivalent is less than clear . at a minimum , one might wish to consider :    * clausius entropy ( @xmath0 ) ; often called thermodynamic entropy  @xcite . * bekenstein entropy ; black hole entropy  @xcite . * statistical entropy ; ( shannon  @xcite , von neumann  @xcite , or entanglement entropy ) .",
    "the extent to which these three notions can _ universally _ be identified is still a matter of debate , though in certain special cases they can be ( and often are ) degenerate .",
    "other related notions of entropy include gibbs entropy , boltzmann entropy , srednicki entropy , kolmogorov ",
    "sinai entropy , and the tsallis and renyi entropies .",
    "multiple attempts have been carried out in order to reconcile these different definitions , see for instance  @xcite , and also to separate out and distinguish equilibrium and non - equilibrium notions of entropy  @xcite .",
    "( see also  @xcite . ) for additional general background see  @xcite .    typically , but",
    "not universally , the clausius entropy is viewed as the most objectively real of these entropies .",
    "the clausius entropy will be the central focus of this article , but even there the situation is extremely subtle .",
    "( see for instance the discussion provided by padmanabhan  @xcite . )",
    "these ontological issues are central to jacobson s `` thermodynamic '' derivation of the einstein equations  @xcite , where one part of the argument is based on an entanglement entropy interpretation of ( a variant of ) the bekenstein entropy , and another part of the argument is based on ( a variant of ) the clausius entropy applied to `` local rindler horizons '' .",
    "( these `` local rindler horizons '' also arise in other situations such as those considered in  @xcite and  @xcite , and it may prove interesting to see to what extent those constructions could also be generalized . )",
    "we shall also see that a version of the generalized second law ( gsl ) can be formulated for this virtual clausius entropy , and can be related to certain ( nonstandard ) integral variants of the null energy condition ( nec ) .",
    "instead of addressing jacobson s `` thermodynamic '' derivation directly we shall in the current article address a more modest goal : to what extent can a clausius - type notion of entropy be associated with matter crossing _",
    "arbitrary _ bifurcate null surfaces ?",
    "we shall first work with exact rindler horizons in flat minkowski space , systematically and carefully extending the framework until we can successfully deal with arbitrary bifurcate null surfaces in curved spacetime .",
    "building on this construction , in future work we plan to more directly address the issue of the extent to which bekenstein and clausius entropies can universally be inter - related . specifically : for which subset of causal horizons ( virtual or otherwise ) _ should _ they be inter - related ? under what situations should these concepts carefully be kept distinct ?",
    "to start the calculation is best to work in flat minkowski spacetime .",
    "that is , for now we are working in the framework of sr , not gr .      to get a handle on the notion of heat flux @xmath5 it is convenient to start with a infinitesimal segment of timelike hypersurface , ( ruled by a congruence of future - pointing timelike vectors @xmath6 , with outward spacelike normal @xmath7 , and with hypersurface area element @xmath8 ) , and",
    "define a future - pointing flux vector @xmath9 it is then appropriate to define an infinitesimal heat flux @xmath10 by setting @xmath11 for finite segments of hypersurface we set @xmath12 this is our version of jacobson s equation ( 1 ) , see reference  @xcite , currently applied to timelike hypersurfaces .",
    "there would be universal agreement that this quantity defines the net energy flux across the segment of timelike hyper - surface , but perhaps less agreement that this energy flux can be equated with a heat flux .",
    "( for instance , some authors prefer to identify this quantity with @xmath13 , the change in internal energy , while yet others might argue that this quantity should be identified with @xmath14 , the change in enthalpy . for current purposes",
    "this subtlety is immaterial . )",
    "following jacobson  @xcite , let us accept the above definition for the sake of argument and see where this identification leads .",
    "note that due to the @xmath15 signature of spacetime this is , perhaps counter - intuitively , the flux of energy in the direction of the normal @xmath7 .",
    "we shall now consider a sequence of timelike hypersurfaces , and construct an appropriate null limit . from the way this limit",
    "is set up it will soon be clear that we can not deal with completely arbitrary null surfaces  the construction intrinsically is set up so that the null limit automatically yields bifurcate null surfaces .",
    "one of the advantages of minkowski space is that it is possible to develop some _ exact _ results , many of which will even hold _ globally_. we will subsequently invoke local flatness to extract more limited approximate results in curved spacetimes ; approximate results which nevertheless hold up to an explicitly controlled level of accuracy in the vicinity of the bifurcation 2-surface .",
    "ultimately we shall develop a construction valid in arbitrary curved spacetimes .",
    "a key physics step in the computation is to invoke the unruh effect ( acceleration radiation ) .",
    "this ( in its original incarnation ) is a flat - space sr qft result whereby an accelerated observer will , ( when the qft is in its usual sr ground state ) , detect a thermal bath of quantum excitations with a temperature  @xcite : @xmath16 we shall use the unruh effect to _ define _ the differential clausius entropy for the matter crossing any timelike hypersurface segment swept out by timelike observers of 4-acceleration @xmath17 by : @xmath18 for a finite segment of hypersurface we could in principle allow the acceleration @xmath17 to vary from generator to generator of the timelike hypersurface , ( for the time being the acceleration is to be kept constant along each generator , though later on we shall see how to relax this requirement ) , and would then have @xmath19 in all explicit calculations below the hypersurfaces will be set up in such a manner that the acceleration @xmath17 is a constant over the hypersurface , so that @xmath20    a tricky point is that the @xmath21 being used here is purely classical , whereas the unruh temperature is associated with quantum fluctuations in the quantum ground state .",
    "( jacobson refers to this as considering the  thermodynamic limit \"  @xcite . ) in the presence of excitations above the quantum ground state it can be argued that the unruh effect provides a lower bound on the physical temperature  @xcite , and so an upper bound on @xmath22 .",
    "furthermore the @xmath23 defined above is a `` virtual '' quantity ; there is no actual need for the timelike observers to be objectively real and physically present  the @xmath23 defined above is what _ would be seen _ by an imaginary swarm of timelike observers skimming along the timelike hypersurface .    in view of these issues , ( identification of the heat flux , identification of the temperature , virtual status of the quantity @xmath23 ) , some may refuse to call the quantity @xmath23 a clausius entropy , and prefer to introduce yet another notion  perhaps `` jacobson entropy '' might be appropriate ? be that as it may , provided one accepts this definition , and we hope the reader will agree this is a very plausible and physically interesting object to calculate , most of the technical computations of this article boil down to taking appropriate limits as the acceleration @xmath17 tends to infinity and the timelike surface becomes null .",
    "let us pick an arbitrary spacelike 2-plane in minkowski space and choose coordinates so that this plane is @xmath24 now add past and future light sheets , for convenience in the @xmath25 direction .",
    "the resulting bifurcate null surface is @xmath26 the two null 3-d half - planes are joined by the spacelike bifurcation 2-plane at @xmath27 . now pick a sheet of hyperbolic timelike observers `` close '' to that null surface : @xmath28 ( eventually we will want to take @xmath29 . ) these observers have 4-velocity @xmath30 and 4-acceleration @xmath31 while the hyperbolic timelike sheet they sweep out has 4-normal @xmath32 here we have chosen the 4-normal to point towards the rindler horizon ; that is , away from the `` observable '' region containing the virtual timelike observers .",

    "it is mathematically safer to instead proceed in a slightly different manner as follows : invoking the unruh effect , relating the temperature @xmath49 to magnitude of the 4-acceleration @xmath17 , and explicitly using @xmath50 , we have @xmath51 t + 2 t_{03 } \\left [ { 2+(a t)^2\\over a\\sqrt{1 + ( at ) ^2 } } \\right]\\right\\ }   \\d^2 \\a.\\ ] ] the key point is that this quantity now has a completely well - defined limit as @xmath29 .",

    "it is important to realise this is an _ exact _",
    "result , valid _ globally _ for all time . note that both @xmath5 and @xmath49 are diverging as @xmath54 , while the ratio @xmath0 remains finite .",
    "that is @xmath55 under normal circumstances the null energy condition [ nec ] is satisfied  @xcite , then @xmath56 and the flux is inwards and positive for @xmath57 . on the other hand ,",
    "the inward flux is negative for @xmath58 , indicating that it should be reinterpreted as a positive outward flux .",
    "that is : the nec implies a variant of the gsl ( generalized second law ) holds for this version of clausius entropy .",
    "[ f : flux-1 ]    the only potentially naively unexpected part of this result is that it is explicitly linear in @xmath46 .",
    "technically that feature can ultimately be traced back to three facts :    1 .   that the location of the bifurcation 2-surface picks out a particular preferred origin for the time coordinate .",
    "2 .   that symmetry enforces the flux to be zero at the bifurcation 2-surface .",
    "that : @xmath59    note that the limiting procedure is utterly essential to get the explicit factor of @xmath46 above .",
    "also , the use of the limiting procedure ( starting from a timelike sheet ) is needed for us to be able to invoke the unruh effect  since the unruh effect really makes sense only for timelike observers .",
    "we can now unambiguously write down clausius entropy _ differences _ for arbitrary times ( both positive or both negative ) on the rindler sheets : @xmath60 perhaps more tellingly we can ( in minkowski space ) usefully define the clausius entropy of the rindler wedge at time @xmath46 as : @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the entropy to be associated with the bifurcation 2-plane itself , a quantity which is _ not _ constrained by the current argument .",

    ". indeed , in the presence of null caustics , such an extension might , apart from being unnecessary , be outright impossible . )",
    "while the discussion started out with a straightforward computation for rindler horizons , we have now bootstrapped it to a large class of bifurcate null surfaces ( still in minkowski space )  the only limitation at this stage is that there be an inertial frame in which the bifurcation surface can be chosen to lie on the hyperplane @xmath27 .      as a penultimate step ,",
    "we are now ready to address the situation for generic bifurcate null sheets in flat minkowski space .",

    "so we can attach outward pointing past and future light rays to each point on the surface  thereby defining null surfaces .",

    "consequently , for the clausius entropy we can still write down an _ exact _ result @xmath105 as a final step we note that we could independently pick distinct affine parameters @xmath106 on each null generator and write @xmath107 then taking @xmath1 to be any spacelike cross - section of the bifurcate null surface we have @xmath108 here the integral now runs over the entire null surface between @xmath3 and @xmath1 .",

    "_ that for arbitrary bifurcate null surfaces in curved spacetime , at arbitrary cross - section @xmath1 of the null surface @xmath135 note that @xmath106 is an affine null parameter , that this integral is well - defined in the sense that it is invariant under rescaling of the affine null parameter , and that in view of the preceding discussion this construction passes all the consistency tests one might reasonably wish to impose .",
    "the only real restriction on the construction is that one should stop using it as soon as the null surface develops self - intersections .",
    "note in particular that imposing the classical null energy condition  the nec  would guarantee positivity of the clausius entropy flux , and imply a version of the gsl .",
    "thus the nec is a _ sufficient _ condition for the gsl to hold .",
    "( while there are certainly quantum - induced violations of the energy conditions  @xcite , we would argue that they can be neglected in the thermodynamic limit . )",
    "note that a rather weaker _ sufficient _ condition for the gsl to hold , ( for this definition of clausius entropy ) , is that on all closed ( or at worst edgeless ) spacelike 2-surfaces @xmath136 a slightly different _ sufficient _ condition for the gsl to hold _ asymptotically _ , ( at sufficiently late or early times , for this particular definition of clausius entropy ) , is that on all future - pointing null half - geodesics we have @xmath137 and that on all past - pointing null half - geodesics we have @xmath138 these conditions are certainly implied by the nec , but are very much weaker than the nec .",
    "thus the gsl is seen to hold under very much weaker conditions than the nec .",
    "these integral variants of the nec are also qualitatively very different from the standard averaged null energy condition ( anec ) , see for instance  @xcite , or the ford  roman quantum inequalities  @xcite , or their variants  @xcite , or even the recent non - linear energy conditions explored in  @xcite .",
    "this strongly suggests these nonstandard integral variants of the nec are well worth additional scrutiny .",
    "the net result of this calculation , and the construction it inspires , is that one can associate an observer - dependent notion of entropy , very closely related to the clausius entropy ( thermodynamic entropy , @xmath139 entropy )  @xcite , and a generalization of jacobson s local - rindler entropy  @xcite , to any arbitrary bifurcate null surface .",
    "that is , there is a certain sense in which even clausius entropy ( @xmath2 entropy ) is observer - dependent , with a `` virtual clausius entropy '' being associated with arbitrary bifurcate `` virtual causal horizons '' .",
    "( see also , for instance , the discussion in references  @xcite . )",
    "this construction , because it generalizes one part of jacobson s `` thermodynamic '' derivation of the einstein equations , cuts to the heart of the issue of the putative universal equality of thermodynamic and entanglement entropy .",
    "we will address such issues more fully in future work .",
