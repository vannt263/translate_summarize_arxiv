    "collective flow continues to play a central role in characterizing the transport properties of the strongly interacting matter produced in heavy - ion collisions at rhic and even lhc and shed some light on the scale of initial state fluctuations .",

    "the maximal fraction reached is the same in central and peripheral collisions but the parton evolution time is shorter in peripheral collisions .",
    "one should recall again the important role of the repulsive mean - field for partons in the phsd model that leads to an increase of the flow @xmath11 with respect to hsd predictions ( cf . also ref .",
    "we point out in addition that the increase of @xmath11 in phsd relative to hsd is also partly due to the higher interaction rates in the partonic medium because of a lower ratio of @xmath2 for partonic degrees - of - freedom at energy densities above the critical energy density than for hadronic media below the critical energy density  @xcite .",
    "the relative increase in @xmath27 and @xmath28 in phsd essentially is due to the higher partonic interaction rate and thus to a lower ratio @xmath2 in the partonic medium which is mandatory to convert initial spacial anisotropies to final anisotropies in momentum space  @xcite .",
