    "let @xmath0 be a looped simple graph , i.e. , a graph in which no two edges are incident on precisely the same set of vertices .",
    "although we allow loops , we reserve the terms _ adjacent _ and _ neighbors _ for pairs of distinct vertices .",
    "we do not count loops in vertex degrees , and we do not consider @xmath1 to be an element of the open neighborhood @xmath2 , whether @xmath1 is looped or not . also , in this paper the rows and columns of matrices are not ordered , but are instead indexed by some finite sets @xmath3 and @xmath4 , respectively ; we refer to such a matrix as an @xmath5 matrix .",
    "a conventional matrix is then just a @xmath6 matrix .",
    "we remark that we follow this more general convention because we will consider adjacency matrices of graphs which do not have a canonical linear ordering of their columns and rows ( because graphs do not have a canonical linear ordering of their vertices ) .",
    "using instead conventional matrices and fixing an arbitrary linear ordering is notationally more cumbersome due to the frequent need for permutation matrices to permute the rows and columns . in situations where there is an obvious natural bijection between the rows and columns of a matrix @xmath7 ,",
    "we may , e.g. , refer to the `` diagonal '' of @xmath7 .",

    "( for each @xmath15 , the @xmath1 rows of @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath16 constitute the @xmath1 row of @xmath17 . ) this matroid is called the _ isotropic matroid _ of @xmath0 , and denoted @xmath18 $ ] .",
    "we refer to oxley s book  @xcite for terminology regarding matroids ; we do not repeat the definitions of basic notions like circuits , connectedness , independence , rank etc .",

    ", we briefly describe the connections tying the two kinds of matroid structures we discuss in detail ( isotropic matroids and multimatroids ) to two other kinds of structures ( delta - matroids and isotropic systems ) , which were introduced earlier .",
    "three remarks about these structures will provide some context .",
    "\\(i ) beginning in the 1980s , bouchet  @xcite and other authors developed a general theory of delta - matroids , which includes delta - matroids associated with graphs and delta - matroids not associated with graphs .",
    "the delta - matroids associated with graphs are _ binary _ , i.e. , they can be represented ( in an appropriate sense ) over @xmath8 .",
    "bouchet introduced isotropic systems at about the same time  @xcite .",
    "in contrast with the theory of delta - matroids , a general theory of isotropic systems that would include instances not represented over @xmath8 has not been fully developed , though it has been introduced by other authors  @xcite .",
    "this contrast is reflected in terminology : the term `` delta - matroid '' does not include an assumption that the structure is tied to @xmath8 , but the term `` isotropic system '' does include such an assumption .",
    "isotropic matroids are essentially equivalent to isotropic systems  @xcite , and are named for them .",
    "\\(ii ) in the 1990s bouchet introduced multimatroids  @xcite , as a way of providing a common generalization of the theories of delta - matroids and isotropic systems .",
    "delta - matroids are equivalent to multimatroids of a particular type , the 2-matroids , and isotropic systems are equivalent to multimatroids of a different particular type , a subclass of the 3-matroids .",
    "a looped simple graph has a corresponding 2-matroid and also a corresponding 3-matroid ; the 2-matroid is equivalent to the graph s delta - matroid , and the 3-matroid is equivalent to the graph s isotropic matroid and isotropic system .",
    "consequently when we explicitly discuss the 2-matroids and isotropic matroids of graphs , we are also implicitly discussing the delta - matroids , 3-matroids and isotropic systems of graphs .",
    "\\(iii ) more recently , brijder and hoogeboom have observed that some delta - matroids admit a loop complementation operation .",
    "they call these delta - matroids `` vf - safe .",
    "'' the class of vf - safe delta - matroids properly contains the class of binary delta - matroids ; for instance all quaternary matroids are vf - safe  @xcite . in  @xcite loop complementation",
    "is used to show that the 2-matroid corresponding to a vf - safe delta - matroid extends to a special type of 3-matroid in a canonical way . for the binary delta - matroid associated to a graph @xmath0 ,",
    "the delta - matroid loop complementation operation is compatible with graph - theoretic loop complementation .",
    "moreover , if the construction of  @xcite is applied to the binary delta - matroid associated with a graph @xmath0 , the result is the 3-matroid associated with @xmath0 .",
    "consequently the 2-matroid , the delta - matroid , the isotropic system , the 3-matroid and the isotropic matroid of a graph are all essentially equivalent to each other .",
    "it might seem strange to try to explain the connections tying together four types of objects  graphs , binary delta - matroids , isotropic systems , and multimatroids  by introducing isotropic matroids into an already complicated situation .",
    "but there are three natural reasons to expect isotropic matroids to yield useful insights .",
    "one reason is that the relationship between a graph and its isotropic matroid is fairly transparent , as @xmath18 $ ] is defined directly from the adjacency matrix of @xmath0 .",
    "the second reason is that unlike delta - matroids , isotropic systems and multimatroids , which are specialized types of structures , isotropic matroids are ordinary binary matroids .",
    "the theory of binary matroids has been developed thoroughly since whitney introduced matroids more than 80 years ago , and this theory can be applied directly to isotropic matroids .",
    "the third reason is that @xmath18 $ ] contains the binary delta - matroid , isotropic system and multimatroid associated with @xmath0 , so we can see the interactions among these structures within the isotropic matroid .    in summary , we see that although the connections among delta - matroids , isotropic systems and multimatroids are quite complicated in general , the theories are very closely related when restricted to instances representable over @xmath8 .",
    "the following compilation of results from various references indicates that this close relationship also includes isotropic matroids , and that all these structures detect local equivalence .",
