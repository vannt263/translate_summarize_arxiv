    "the physics of the ultra high energy cosmic rays ( uhecr ) is a challenging search in the field of cosmic ray physics .",
    "there is a special interest to measure the energy spectrum in the region of @xmath5  ev where the gzk cutoff is predicted  @xcite . for more than 40 years",
    ", many experiments looked for such uhecr events but only a few dozen of them have been recorded so far .",
    "the lack of statistics and the discrepancies between the results of the two main experiments agasa  @xcite and hires  @xcite , requires new experiments to solve the uhecr and the gzk puzzle . in the coming years , with the deployment of ground based detectors : the pierre auger observatory  @xcite and the telescope array  @xcite , this number of events will increase dramatically , reaching several hundreds . in the longer term , space - based experiments ( owl , euso , tus )  @xcite are foreseen , with the goal of reaching a thousand events per year .    for most of the past ,",
    "present and future experiments , the detection technique relies , at least , on the measurement of the air fluorescence produced by the incoming cosmic ray showering in the atmosphere .",
    "this light , observed in the near - uv region , is induced by the de - excitation of the molecule of air ( mainly @xmath6 ) occurring along the development of the extensive air showers ( eas ) .",
    "this fluorescence light yield ( fly ) is rather weak ( @xmath7 4 photons / m emitted in 4@xmath8 ) , and depends significantly on the atmospheric conditions ( temperature , pressure , gas components : h@xmath9o , ar , ... ) .    since the 1960 s , when it was first proposed to use air fluorescence for uhecr s detection ,",
    "the fly has been studied . in 1967 , a. n. bunner summarized the existing data in his thesis  @xcite . at that time",
    "the uncertainty on the fly was @xmath730 % !",
    "later , the discrepancy between the agasa and hires experiments led the uhecr community to pursue their efforts on the fly measurement . in 1996 , in the context of hires and telescope array , a new set of results",
    "@xcite was published .",
    "more recently , m. nagano   released new measurements on the fly with systematic uncertainty of @xmath713.2 %  @xcite .    a better understanding of the fly , with a goal of setting the systematic uncertainties below 10 % ,",
    "is now needed for the uhecr experiments . up to now only the pressure dependence was really measured . to improve our knowledge of air fly and its behavior with respect to pressure , temperature , humidity , electron energy , shower age , etc ,",
    "new experiments are needed .",
    "an overview of the current experiments can be found elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : section 2 describes the fluorescence mechanisms and presents a predictive model . in section 3 the experimental setup",
    "is described . in section 4",
    "the data taking and signal processing are discussed and in section 5 the calibration and systematic studies are presented . finally our results are described in section 6 and a comparison with other experiments are discussed in section 7 .",
    "the fluorescence light yield depends on two competitive processes : excitation and de - excitation of the air molecules .    in an eas",
    ", the air is excited by the high energy charged particles of the shower .",
    "when such a particle traverses the air , it ionizes air and produces secondary low energy electrons which will excite @xmath6 molecules in the low energy states ( 10 - 20  ev ) , which fluoresce .",
    "the energy ( and hence the wavelength ) of the fluorescence photons corresponds to the energy difference between two excited states of an air molecule : the spectrum varies in a large band , from uv to ir . in the uhecr experiments , the photons",
    "are detected in the near uv band , which ranges in the 290 - 440 nm window in macfly .",
    "a molecular excited state can be defined by its molecular orbital and by its vibrational state .",
    "the air fluorescence spectrum at atmospheric pressure is a band spectrum dominated by 1n system of @xmath10 and 2p system of @xmath6 .",
    "1n system corresponds to all the transitions between @xmath11 orbitals @xmath12 and @xmath13 , and 2p system to all the transitions between @xmath6 orbitals @xmath14 and @xmath15  .    during the de - excitation",
    ", there is a contest between the radiative and the non - radiative processes , which are both characterized by a time scale .",
    "the first one may produce photons in the experimental uv band while the second process dissipates the energy via thermal processes .    the mean lifetime @xmath16 of an excited state in non - isolated conditions verifies : @xmath17 where the first term @xmath18 is the mean lifetime of the isolated excited state .",
    "for instance the typical values of the 2p system are @xmath740 ns  @xcite .",
    "the non - radiative de - excitation of the molecules ( quenching ) comes from collisions of the excited molecules with other air molecules .",
    "the collision times @xmath19 of the excited state @xmath20 with the molecule of type @xmath21 ( @xmath21 = @xmath22 ) are given by the kinematic theory of gases : @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the gas temperature , @xmath25 is the partial pressure of molecules @xmath21 , @xmath26 is the boltzmann constant , @xmath27 and @xmath28 are the molecular mass of @xmath29 and of molecule @xmath21 , and @xmath30 is the cross section of the collision .",
    "the @xmath19 have been measured since a long time and their values vary inversely with the pressure @xmath31 . at atmospheric pressure the quenching time of the 2p system",
    "is a few ns .",
    "one often expresses the relationship between the lifetime and the pressure via the formula : @xmath32 p being the pressure for which the quenching processes have a collision time equal to the radiative de - excitations lifetime .    in our model ,",
    "the quenching processes are characterized by the quenching factors @xmath33 , independent of the pressure , defined by : @xmath34 .",
    "assuming that @xmath30 do not vary with temperature , implies that the @xmath33 vary solely as the inverse square root of the temperature : @xmath35 .",
    "the values of @xmath36 are given for a reference temperature @xmath37 .",
    "thus , @xmath19 can be re - written as : @xmath38    for any excited states , @xmath20 , of a gas at temperature @xmath24 and pressure @xmath31 containing a fraction @xmath39 of molecules @xmath21 , the probability @xmath40 to have a radiative de - excitation is :    @xmath41    for all the air fluorescence lines , at wavelength @xmath42 , corresponding to an excited state @xmath20 , one can express the @xmath43 ratio of an arbitrary admixture of @xmath29 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 , as a function of pressure @xmath31 and temperature @xmath24 , via the formula : @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the limit of the fly ratio for pure nitrogen at @xmath31=0  hpa ( where no quenching effect by molecular collisions is expected ) and @xmath48 is the mass fraction of nitrogen in the gas admixture ( @xmath49 ) .",
    "in our model we assume that the fraction of the deposited energy in the gas converted in nitrogen excitation is @xmath48 .",
    "the parameters entering equation  [ eq - melange ] : @xmath47 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 and @xmath53 are given for 24 wavelengths ( @xmath42 ) corresponding to 5 excited states ( @xmath20 ) at the reference temperature @xmath54c ( 293.15  k ) .",
    "the values of these parameters come from both our macfly measurements and from already published results :  @xcite  @xcite   for the spectra ( @xmath42 ) and  @xcite  @xcite for the lifetimes ( @xmath18 ) and the quenching factors ( @xmath55 ) .    in this paper",
    ", we will show experimental results for pure nitrogen ( @xmath29 ) and for our experimental dry air ( da )  an admixture 80%(@xmath29)-20%(@xmath44 )  as a function of the pressure .",
    "from this it will be then possible to derive the behavior of the atmospheric dry air ( ada )  an admixture 78.08%(@xmath29)-0.93%(@xmath56)-20.99%(@xmath44 )  for which we assume the fly for argon to be identical to the fly of nitrogen due to its catalysis effect on nitrogen fluorescence  @xcite .",
    "then the ada becomes in our model  an admixture 79%(@xmath29)-21%(@xmath44 ) .    using this",
    ", we formulate the general fly of any humid `` atmospheric air '' ( aa ) , _ i.e. _ any admixture composed of @xmath57 dry air ( ada ) and @xmath58 water vapor , where @xmath58 is the molecular fraction of water in the admixture ( @xmath59 as defined in equation [ eq - tvsk ] ) .",
    "we get : @xmath60 where @xmath61    we assume that the energy fraction transferred to ada molecules is proportional to the mass fraction of ada in the admixture rather than the molecular fraction ( 1@xmath62 ) .",
    "the numerator ( 1@xmath63 ) represents this mass fraction .",
    "it is a simplification of the exact formula @xmath64 for @xmath651 as it is the case in the atmospheric air .",
    "the macfly experiment  @xcite is twofold , it has been designed to measure both the fly induced by single electron track and the fly produced by a high energy electromagnetic shower developing in the air .",
    "it is composed of two devices : mf1 which is used for single track fly measurements and mf2 which measures the fluorescence produced by an electromagnetic shower . in this paper",
    "we will present only the results obtained with mf1 using both a @xmath66 radioactive source ( strontium 90 ) and an electron test beam ( cern / sps - x5 line ) . the results of the shower fly with mf2 will be presented elsewhere  @xcite .    the mf1 experiment is composed of a pressurized chamber ( with pressure from 0 to 1200  hpa ) containing the gas , equipped with a trigger system ( see figure  [ fig - mf1_overview ] ) .",
    "this device has an internal cylindrical chamber , 150 mm in diameter and 288 mm long .",
    "an ionizing particle ( e  @xmath67 1  mev ) reaches the gas volume through the entrance window ( 0.25  mm of black delrin ) , crosses the gas volume and leaves the chamber at the exit window ( 0.8  mm of aluminium ) where it reaches the trigger plane .",
    "an optical system collects the induced fluorescence light , and focuses it on two uv sensitive phototubes ( pmt ) emi9820qa .",
    "each pmt receives photons via an optical system which is composed of a multilayered mirror covering the chamber , a quartz lens focusing the light , a winston cone and wide band filters which allow the selection of the appropriate wavelength . the multilayered mirror ) + 43  nm ( @xmath68 ) + 43  nm ( @xmath69 ) + 43  nm ( @xmath68 ) ] was designed to have its best reflectance in the appropriate air fluorescence band ( see figure  [ fig - mirror ] ) .",
    "the filters are schott bg3 filters with a large band of transmittance : 290 - 440  nm .",
    "we have measured the fly for two gases : pure nitrogen and dry air ( @xmath6 - 80% , @xmath70 - 20% ) .",
    "the mf1 experiment was tested in two different setup configurations corresponding to low and high energy .",
    "for the low energy runs ( labeled mf1-lab ) a @xmath66 source ( @xmath0 ) was used and the trigger system was integrated in the overall system ( see figure  [ fig - mf1_lapp ] ) . for the high energy runs ( labeled mf1-beam ) the cern sps xp5 beam facility was used .        in this later case the source and the trigger system are removed from the main tank , and external systems are installed along the beam line : a position sensitive ( @xmath71 ) x - y delay chamber upstream from the mf1 device to record both the horizontal and the vertical beam position and two double plane trigger systems before and after the mf1 setup .",
    "the electron beam was a pulsed beam of about 10  000 electrons per spill ( 4.8  s duration ) every 16.8  s with a beam spot of about @xmath72  mm@xmath73 .",
    "the electron energy was selected in the range between 10 and 100 gev .",
    "the data was collected on an event per event basis . for every event the pmt signals ( mf1 and trigger counters )",
    "were recorded by a qadc ( caen - v792 ) which integrated the charge during a gate of 100  ns .",
    "the beam position was also recorded for the mf1-beam configuration . during a run , which consists of typically 10@xmath74 triggers , we recorded two kinds of events : the beam events ( be ) , used for the fly measurement , and the random events ( re ) , when no beam is present , for the background estimations and studies . in mf1-lab",
    "configuration be are triggered when an electron reaches the trigger plane after the exit window . in mf1-beam configuration ,",
    "the electron should reach two trigger planes before and after the mf1 chamber . in the analysis , we also suppressed be not detected in the central region of the delay chamber .",
    "the fly is rather weak ( @xmath74 ph / m ) and most of the produced photons are lost in the chamber . among those reaching the pmt photocathode , some are converted in photoelectron ( pe ) .",
    "overall , the mean number of detected photoelectron is about 0.01 pe / event . to extract the mean detected light ( dl )",
    ", we performed a fit of the data by a function describing the expected signal ; for every event , a pmt detects an integer number of photon : 0 , 1 , 2 or more converting them into photoelectrons .",
    "so the overall pmt spectrum is described by a weighted sum of individual photoelectron contributions , the weights following a poisson distribution .",
    "the zero photoelectron contribution , the pedestal , is measured experimentally .",
    "+ the single photoelectron contribution is described by two functions : one describing the standard photoelectron multiplication at the first dynode , the other corresponds to the photoelectron being inelastically back - scattered on the first dynode  @xcite .",
    "the first function is described by a weibull ] distribution  @xcite while the second uses an exponential law . + the multi - photoelectron contributions ( n@xmath752 ) are described by gaussian distributions .",
    "the mean value @xmath76 and the variance @xmath77 of each distribution are determined by the single photoelectron fit function parameters : @xmath78 and @xmath79 where @xmath80 and @xmath81 are the single photoelectron distribution ( weibull ) mean value and variance and @xmath82 and @xmath83 the pedestal mean value .",
    "one can see in figure  [ fig - fit_description ] the pmt raw signal as well as the different contributions entering the fit function .",
    "it is worth noting the agreement between the global fitted function and the data extends on more than five orders of magnitude .    in the context of macfly data",
    "( @xmath84 be / run ) , the low level of pmt dark noise enables the detection of a signal as low as : 0.0002  pe / event , which correspond to a mean sensitivity of the mf1 apparatus of about 0.04  ph / event for the florescence light .",
    "howerver other sources of pmt photoelectrons signal degrade this minimal sensitivity to @xmath70.2  ph / event .",
    "the detected light has several origins : fluorescence light ( fdl ) , cherenkov light ( cdl ) and background ( bgd ) .",
    "@xmath85 the bgd contribution is estimated from both the data from the re triggers and from be with vacuum in the chamber ( no signal expected ) .",
    "+ the cherenkov contribution is estimated , based on a geant4 monte carlo simulation program , describing in details both the apparatus and the interaction processes  @xcite . for mf1-lab measurements , electrons do not produce any cherenkov radiation . at high energy",
    "( e @xmath86 10 gev ) , the cherenkov light yield is important but its contribution to the raw pmt signal remains small ; the cherenkov light is emitted in the forward direction where a black `` light catcher '' is installed , suppressing dramatically the reflected cherenkov component .",
    "figure  [ fig - dl compo ] shows the dl measured and the estimation of cdl and bgd for test beam measurements at cern as a function of pressure in dry air and nitrogen .",
    "the fdl is determined by substraction .",
    "we can see that the main part of the dl comes from the fluorescence .",
    "the fluorescence light yield in mf1 , is determined from the measurements from both overall and background signals and from the estimated contribution for the cherenkov yield : @xmath87 where the mf1 efficiency @xmath88 is the product of geometrical acceptance of the detector and of the pmt quantum efficiency ( @xmath89 ) .",
    "the geometrical acceptance is estimated by a geant4  @xcite simulation program which describes in detail the apparatus .",
    "it is able to perform the tracking of the optical photons from the production source along the electron track to the pmt photocathodes ( filters transmittance and mirror reflectivity are included ) .",
    "the simulation result shows that 2.75% of the fluorescence light emitted isotropically in the chamber reaches one pmt photocathode .",
    "this geometrical acceptance varies with the setup configuration ( mirror , surfaces , filters , ... ) .",
    "the optical properties of the inner surfaces are well known : the mirror reflectance , as function of wavelength , was measured with less than 2% of error .",
    "figure [ fig - mirror ] shows the result of this measurement .",
    "the other inner surfaces were studied in laboratory with a calibration device at 370  nm .    to check our geant4 based simulation program , we compared the fly measurements for different experimental ( optical system ) configurations with the simulation expectations .",
    "for instance , having black covered some inner surfaces , the geometrical acceptance was reduced by 24% which was really close to the predicted simulation value of 26% .",
    "table  [ table - geoacc ] summarizes the systematic relative errors on geometrical acceptance for both experimental configurations ( mf1-lab and mf1-beam ) .",
    "the main contributions come from the electron track position uncertainty ( delay chamber / mf1 alignment and multiple - scattering in the chamber ) , from the internal surfaces reflective properties and from the mirror inhomogeneity .",
    "the overall geometrical acceptance uncertainty is estimated to 7.5% for mf1-lab and 8.2% for mf1-beam .",
    ".geometrical acceptance systematic uncertainties for both experimental configurations : mf1-lab ( with @xmath0 source ) and mf1-beam ( cern test beam ) [ cols=\"<,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "to compare our results with the other experiments , we have chosen a reference point : atmospheric dry air at @xmath31=1013  hpa ( 1  atm . ) and @xmath90c ( 296  k ) , and we express the fly per track length ( @xmath91 ) in the usual units : photon per track length ( @xmath92 ) .",
    "table  [ tab - fly ] gives values we obtained for three electron energies : 1.5  mev , 20  gev and 50  gev .",
    "these values are corrected , according to our fluorescence model , to correspond to this reference point .    in figure  [ fig - energy dep ]",
    "we show the @xmath91 measurements of the corrected macfly data together with the values for others experiments as a function of the incoming kinetic energy . on the same figure",

    "the solid line indicates the energy deposited ( @xmath94 ) in the fiducial gas volume of the mf1 chamber , computed with our mf1 simulation program  @xcite .",

    "the ratio between the two scales corresponds to our fly model at this reference point : @xmath97 .    on a wide energy range ( from mev region to 50  gev region )",

    "we have performed measurements of the dry air and pure nitrogen fluorescence light yields induced by single electrons of low ( 1.5 mev ) and high ( 20 and 50 gev ) energy as a function of the gas pressure .",
    "we show that , within the experimental uncertainties , the @xmath98 is proportional to the deposited energy in the gas , independently of the incoming electron energy . at the reference point : @xmath31=1013 hpa and @xmath99c , the @xmath4 = 17.6 @xmath100 2.3 ph / mev .    based on our measurements and using already published data we have proposed a model describing , in the 390 - 440  nm range , the fluorescence light yield for any air composition , as a function of the pressure , the temperature and the water contamination .",
