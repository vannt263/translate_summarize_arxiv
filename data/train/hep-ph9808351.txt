    "the most widely used approach to the relativistic bound state problem is that based on the bethe - salpeter equation .",
    "however , this tends to become very cumbersome when applied to higher - order radiative corrections , while the result reflects mostly the non - relativistic features of the system , which are well described by the schrdinger equation .",
    "the problem is how to relate the latter to the relativistic quantum field theory . in the case of the electromagnetic interaction ,",
    "a solution was given by the theory called non - relativistic quantum electrodynamics , or nrqed@xcite .    in this talk",
    ", i should like to describe the main features of nrqed choosing as an example our recent work on the radiative corrections to the hyperfine structure of the muonium ground state .",
    "this quantity , which is one of the most precisely measured quantities , is particularly suitable for a detailed examination of nrqed , being relatively free from the effects of hadronic interaction .",
    "the latest measurement gives @xcite @xmath7 which includes the earlier result @xcite and reduces its uncertainty by a factor of three .",
    "the nrqed is a rigorous and systematic adaptation of qed to bound states .",
    "it is described by a hamiltonian derived from qed by expanding it in the velocity of the bound electron .",
    "the equivalence of nrqed and qed is guaranteed by requiring that the nrqed @xmath8 amplitude coincides with the qed @xmath8 amplitude at some chosen momentum scale , e.g. , at the threshold of the external on - shell particles .",
    "the coupling constant @xmath0 and mass , renormalized on - shell , are identified with the observed values and used as the input coupling constant and mass of nrqed .",
    "the nrqed hamiltonian consists of all possible local interactions satisfying the required symmetries , such as galileian invariance , gauge invariance , parity invariance , time reversal invariance , hermiticity , and locality . in the absence of dynamical photons",
    "it is nothing but the foldy - wouthuysen - tani ( fwt ) transform of the dirac hamiltonian .",
    "since the photon is always relativistic , its lagrangian is the same as that of qed .",
    "when the interaction with photons is taken into account , the nrqed hamiltonian breaks up into two parts : @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "@xmath9 is bilinear in fermion operators as well as photon operators .",
    "in addition , new photon interaction terms , such as vacuum polarization and light - by - light scattering , are introduced to represent insertion of the fermion loop .",
    "@xmath10 represents the remainder .",
    "the crucial feature of nrqed is that all operators ( terms of the hamiltonian ) are restricted to small momentum transfer , defined by some cut - off @xmath11 , while effects of large momentum transfer are represented by coefficients of these operators and terms of @xmath10 .",
    "since this theory is meant to apply to non - relativistic systems , the cut - off @xmath11 may be chosen as typical mass scale of the system , e.g. , the rest mass of the electron .",
    "for the calculation of non - recoil terms in which we can take the limit @xmath12 , @xmath9 relevant to the muonium calculation can be written , to order @xmath0 , as @xmath13 \\psi(\\vec{p } ) \\nonumber \\\\    & + & c_{\\rm vp}a^i(q ) { \\vec{q}\\,^4 \\over m^2 }         a^j(q)(\\delta^{ij}-{q^iq^j \\over \\vec{q}\\,^2 } )    + c_{\\rm vp}a^0(\\vec{q } ) { -\\vec{q}\\,^4 \\over m^2 }       a^0(\\vec{q})~ , \\label{h_main}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath14 is the pauli two - component spinor , @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the outgoing and incoming fermion momenta , respectively , and @xmath17 is the incoming photon momentum . in the seagull vertex ( on the third line ) , @xmath18 is the incoming momentum of the vector potential @xmath19 .",
    "the large momentum - transfer effect is represented by the nrqed @xmath20renormalization \" coefficients which , to order @xmath0 , are found to be @xmath21                   + 2 a_e~ , \\nonumber \\\\ c_s&= & 1 + 2a_e ~ , \\nonumber \\\\ c_w&= & 1~ , \\nonumber \\\\ c_{q^2}&= & { \\alpha\\over\\pi } { 4 \\over 3}\\biggl [ \\ln\\left({m \\over 2\\lambda}\\right ) - { 3 \\over 8 } + { 5 \\over 6 }    + { 1 \\over 4}\\biggr ]   + { a_e \\over 2 } ~ , \\nonumber \\\\ c_{p'p}&= & a_e~ , \\nonumber \\\\",

    "@xmath9 alone can not reproduce the amplitudes of qed . to make nrqed fully equivalent to qed , we must add terms of contact interaction type : @xmath24 where @xmath25 represents the muon ( of mass @xmath26 ) .",
    "the coefficients @xmath27 are determined completely by the requirement that the contact terms make up the difference between the qed electron - muon scattering amplitude and the corresponding nrqed scattering amplitude generated by @xmath28 and lower order @xmath29 .",
    "several terms of @xmath10 have been determined : @xmath30 the @xmath23 factor in ( [ hcontact ] ) comes from exchange of photons between the electron and the muon ( of charge @xmath31 ) and has nothing to do with the bound - state effect .",
    "once the nrqed hamiltonian is constructed the corrections to the energy and wave function can be determined by the usual bound state perturbation theory .",
    "thus far , non - recoil terms of order @xmath2 , @xmath4 , and @xmath3 have been evaluated explicitly in nrqed .",
    "they agree with evaluation by other methods .",
    "evaluation of @xmath5 and @xmath6 terms within the framework of nrqed is in progress . instead of discussing these calculations in detail , i shall focus on their qualitative features to illustrate how the nrqed method works . for simplicity",
    "let us discuss here only diagrams with radiative photons , leaving out the vacuum - polarization contribution .",
    "in general , radiative corrections of order @xmath32 to the hyperfine splitting are of two types : @xmath33 first - order perturbation of contact terms of order @xmath34 . @xmath35",
    "higher - order perturbation of lower - order terms of @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "the type @xmath33 originates from a set of qed scattering diagrams in which @xmath36 photons are exchanged between the electron and the muon and the electron line is dressed by @xmath37 virtual photon lines .",
    "since operators of the nrqed hamiltonian describe soft ( low momentum - transfer ) effects only , the type @xmath35 scattering amplitude will reproduce the low energy behavior ( including renormalization effects ) but not the complete qed scattering amplitude .",
    "the difference between the qed scattering amplitude and the nrqed scattering amplitude is due to large momentum - transfer effect and leads to the type @xmath33 contact term .    *",
    "the @xmath2 term . *",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath9 consists only of terms with even parity .",
    "their expectation values with respect to the coulomb wave function are even in @xmath23 , too .",
    "thus type @xmath35 terms can not generate terms proportional to @xmath23 .",
    "the only contribution is from the type @xmath33 term , which arises from the difference of qed and nrqed scattering amplitudes : @xmath38 the qed amplitude @xmath39 is derived from the electron - muon scattering diagrams in which two photons are exchanged between the electron and the muon and the electron line is dressed by a virtual photon line .",
    "both @xmath40 and @xmath41 have threshold singularities in the limit of vanishing coulomb photon momentum , which cancel in the difference ( [ def - d1 ] ) .",
    "the origin of the threshold singularity may be understood as follows : in order to contribute to the hyperfine splitting , one of the two exchanged photons in the bound state perturbation theory must be coulomb - like while the other is transverse .",
    "the coulomb photon can be absorbed in the wave function or the green function .",
    "such a diagram is reduced to lower order in @xmath23 , or , equivalently , multiplied by @xmath42 . in the corresponding scattering state , this factor manifests itself as an ir - divergent factor .",
    "since the bound state has no threshold singularity all these singularities must cancel out in the end .",
    "the expectation value of the contact term ( [ def - d1 ] ) can be evaluated in the first order bound state perturbation theory .",
    "only the value of the coulomb wave function at the origin contributes to the integral , leading to @xmath43 where @xmath44 for the ground state .",
    "the difference between @xmath45 and @xmath46 spin states is taken .",
    "together with the vacuum - polarization contribution this gives the first term of @xmath47 in ( [ hcontact ] ) .",
    "* the @xmath3 term .",
    "* for the same reason as in the @xmath2 case this correction comes only from the contact term of type @xmath33 .",
    "it is defined as the difference between the gauge invariant set of qed scattering diagrams in which the electron and the muon exchange two photons and the electron line is dressed by two radiative photons and the corresponding nrqed scattering diagrams .    * the @xmath4 term .",
    "* one contribution comes from a type @xmath33 contact term of order @xmath5 , which arises from qed scattering diagrams that exchange three photons between the electron and the muon , dressed by one radiative photon on the electron line .",
    "these amplitudes have threshold singularity of up to order @xmath48 .",
    "the type @xmath35 nrqed scattering diagrams which have the same leading threshold singularity are of two kinds : one is the first term of @xmath47 in ( [ hcontact ] ) combined with one coulomb potential and the other is the fermi potential times the anomalous magnetic moment combined with two coulomb potentials .    * the @xmath49 term . *",
    "the relevant qed diagrams are those that exchange three photons between the electron and the muon , dressed by two radiative photons on the electron line .",
    "the corresponding nrqed diagrams have two radiative photons , too .",
    "however , these diagrams contribute only to order @xmath50 , which is too small by a factor @xmath51 .",
    "thus the radiative correction of order @xmath6 comes from the qed diagrams only .",
    "the contact term of nrqed derived from these qed diagrams does not have the @xmath52 dependence .",
    "thus logarithmic terms of order @xmath6 can come only from the nrqed operators of @xmath9 contributing to the @xmath4 term combined with an additional factor of @xmath0 found in the @xmath20renormalization \" effect .",
    "this leads to the result reported in ( [ a^2(za)^2 ] ) .    *",
    "the @xmath53 term . * the status of the theory of this term will be discussed in detail by dr .",
    "nio in her talk presented at this workshop .",
    "as is well known , the bulk of the hyperfine splitting is given by the fermi formula @xmath54^{-3 }    \\nonumber   \\\\       & = & 4~453~839.405~(518)~{\\rm khz } ,             \\label{ef}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath55 is the rydberg constant for infinite nuclear mass , and @xmath37 and @xmath26 are the electron and muon masses , respectively . the values used above for @xmath0 , @xmath55 , and @xmath56 are @xcite @xmath57    various theoretical corrections to @xmath58 have been calculated over the last 50 years .",
    "they may be classified into non - recoil and recoil terms , both including radiative and binding effects .",
    "in addition there are contributions of hadronic vacuum - polarization and weak interaction effect .",
    "thus one may write @xmath59    a purely radiative non - recoil term of order @xmath2 and an approximate value of the @xmath60 term have been known for some time @xcite .",
    "recently radiative corrections of orders @xmath61 and @xmath3 have been evaluated with high precision . including these results and the fermi term @xmath58 itself , the",
