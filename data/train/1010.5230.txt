    ", a new electroweak signal will be discovered because the unitarity of the @xmath0 scattering amplitude is violated at the scale higher around 1 tev due to the @xmath9 dependence .",
    "one of the candidates is a signal from a scalar @xmath10 doublet , called the higgs boson . due to the contribution from the higgs boson ,",
    "the @xmath9 dependence of the @xmath0 scattering amplitude vanishes in the standard model ( sm ) .    on the other hand , it is also possible to maintain the unitarity without the higgs scalar in higgsless models @xcite . in higgsless models ,",
    "vector resonances which are responsible for the restoration of the unitarity of the @xmath0 scattering amplitude will be produced at the lhc .",
    "the masses are less than around 1 tev to avoid the unitarity violation , but such particles are strictly constrained by direct observation if their couplings to sm fermions are similar to the sm ones @xcite .",
    "also the coupling induces a large correction to electroweak precision measurements at the tree level . to avoid the constraints ,",
    "the couplings should be suppressed and it is realized by the fermion delocalization @xcite .",
    "the vector resonances therefore have only small coupling to the sm fermions in higgsless models .",
    "fermiophobic vector resonances can be produced mainly by the weak gauge boson associated process or the vector boson fusion process and mainly decay into the weak gauge bosons at the lhc .",
    "the measurements of charged vector resonance have been studied @xcite . however , in a case that the @xmath2-associated production is dominant , the mass determination of the neutral vector resonance ( @xmath1 ) is very difficult because there are three @xmath2 bosons in the final state . a way using @xmath11 mode",
    "is proposed by tao han et.al.@xcite , and they showed that the mass can be read off by an endpoint of the @xmath12 distribution from the parton level study .    in this paper , we show that neutral vector resonance can be reconstructed even in @xmath13 final state using @xmath6 assisted on - shell ( maos ) reconstruction of missing momenta @xcite .",
    "since maos momenta equal true neutrino four momenta at the @xmath6 @xcite endpoint of @xmath14 system , the @xmath1 mass will be determined by the peak of the invariant mass of reconstructed @xmath15 bosons .",
