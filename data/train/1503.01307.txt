    "all the outbursts that have been monitored with sufficient detail are compatible with a rapid ( @xmath43days ) increase in luminosity up to a maximum of a few @xmath44  erg  s@xmath3 and a thermally dominated x - ray spectrum which softens during the decay . in the case of  and",

    "2012 ) .",
    "the initial behavior of the 2013 outburst decay of was compatible with those observed in other magnetars .",
    "the outburst peak , the thermal emission peaked at about 1 kev , the small radiating surface ( about 2 km in radius ) , and the overall evolution in the first few months , were consistent with the behavior observed in other outbursts .",
    "however , after an additional year of x - ray monitoring , it became clear that the subsequent evolution of showed distinct characteristics .",
    "the source flux decay appears extremely slow : it is the first time that we observe a magnetar with a quiescent luminosity @xmath45 erg s@xmath3 remaining at a luminosity @xmath46 erg s@xmath3 for more than one year , and with a temperature decreasing by less than 10% from the initial @xmath47kev .",
    "a further interesting feature of this source is that the non - thermal component ( as detected by _",
    "xmm  newton _ ) persisted on a very long temporal baseline during the outburst evolution .",
    "the flux due to the power law component does not change significantly in time and , as a result , its fractional contribution to the total flux is larger at late times : @xmath48 d after the outburst onset , @xmath49 per cent of the 110 kev absorbed flux is due to the non - thermal component .",
    "we first modelled the decay empirically to gauge the characteristic decay timescales .",
    "we adopted three different functions to model the blackbody temperature , radius and 110 kev absorbed flux temporal evolutions ( see fig .",

    "the hot spot shrinking is best modeled by an exponential ( @xmath58 for 23 d.o.f . ) .",
    "best - fit parameters are @xmath59 d and initial radius @xmath60 km",
    ". the shape of the flux decline appears to change in time and in fact none of these models can accurately describe the magnetar flux overall decay .",
    "the flux decay during the first 100days since the outburst onset is well modelled by a linear plus exponential model with @xmath61 d ( @xmath62 = 1.5 for 4 d.o.f . ) .",
    "after @xmath63 days , the best fitting model turns out to be an exponential with @xmath64 d ( @xmath62 = 1.4 for 15 d.o.f . ) .",
    "we applied the crustal cooling model ( see e.g. pons & rea 2012 ) to the data collected during the 1.5-yr outburst of .",
    "although this model was successful in explaining several other magnetar outbursts ( rea et al .",
    "2012 , 2013b ) , in this case we could not reproduce the very slow cooling and high luminosity observed for this source .",
    "we ran several models varying the total injected energy , the angular size , and the depth of the region where the energy is released , but we could not find any set of parameters that fit the data .    in the framework of the starquake model , the maximum temperature reached in the region where the energy is released is limited by neutrino emission processes .",
    "this internal temperature determines the maximum surface temperature and therefore the luminosity at which the outburst peaks during the first few days . for injected energies",
    "@xmath65erg , there is no significant increase in the peak luminosity because the crustal temperature saturates ( at about @xmath66k ) due to the efficient neutrino processes . after reaching the maximum luminosity ( between 1 hour and 1 day depending on the depth and injection rate )",
    ", the cooling curve tracks the thermal relaxation of the crust .",
    "independent of the initial injected energy and surface temperature , the luminosity is expected to drop below @xmath44 erg s@xmath3 after @xmath4320 - 30 days ( see e.g. fig.1 in pons & rea 2012 ) , due to neutrino emission processes in the crust ( mainly plasmon decay , and probably neutrino synchrotron for magnetar field strengths ) .    in fig.[fig : cooling ] ( left panel , lower curves ) we show an example of the expected cooling curve of a magnetar with the same characteristics of .",
    "we assume that a sudden large energy release , @xmath67 erg , heats up a layer of the outer crust up to @xmath68k .",
    "we also assume that the event affects the entire magnetar surface , to create the most favorable scenario ( the luminosity simply scales with the area of the emitting region ) , and that the layer where the energy is injected extends from an external boundary at @xmath69 g@xmath70 , to an inner boundary at @xmath71 and @xmath72 g@xmath70 ( we show these two cases in the two lower curves of fig.[fig : cooling ] , left panel ) .",
    "it is clear that , even in this most favorable case , the high luminosities observed at late times are difficult to reconcile with any cooling model . in particular , injecting more energy or changing @xmath73 will only affect the peak luminosity during the first days or weeks . on the other hand , injecting energy deeper into the crust ( i.e. at higher @xmath74 ) ,",
    "is expected to change the late time evolution only slightly .",
    "this can be seen by comparing the solid and dashed lines in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : cooling ] , which correspond to @xmath75 and 4 @xmath76 g@xmath70 , respectively .    for illustrative purposes",
    ", we also show the cooling curves obtained when plasmon and synchrotron neutrino processes are switched off ( see the upper curves in the left panel of fig.[fig : cooling ] ) .",
    "these provide a much closer match to the data ; however , there is no clear reason why these neutrino processes should not operate in these conditions .",
    "this example is only meant to highlight the relevance of understanding neutrino processes in the crust , especially under the presence of strong fields .",
    "another possibility to fit the data is to tune the energy injection , which must be maintained during the first @xmath77days , resulting in a higher luminosity at late times .",
    "if we assume that only a region 5 km in radius is affected ( this is closer to the @xmath78 km emitting region observed ) , we need a continuous injection of at least @xmath79 erg s@xmath3 ( per day ) for about 200days , which results in a total energy of a few @xmath80erg .",
    "while this energy budget may not be unrealistic , a physical mechanism that can operate for such a long timescale is not known .",
    "a possibility might be a continuous injection of energy to keep the surface at high temperatures for so long , although in this latter case we should possibly expect more sgr - like bursts during the first hundreds days .      in this section",
    "we discuss the possibility that the prolonged high luminosity of is in part due to external particle bombardment as a consequence of the existence of a twisted magnetic field bundle .",
    "a valid alternative model to the crustal cooling scenario invokes the presence of magnetospheric currents flowing along a gradually shrinking magnetic bundle , and heating the surface from outside . according to beloborodov ( 2007 , 2013 ) ,",
    "this bundle can untwist on different timescales : i ) in the equatorial regions of the magnetosphere , where the magnetic field reaches a few stellar radii , currents are dissipated after weeks or months , while ii ) at higher latitudes ( close to the poles ) , a bundle may untwist more slowly , possibly in one to ten years . here , particles can reach lorentz factors of a few tens ( beloborodov 2007 ) . in this scenario ,",
    "a quasi steady - state outflow of electrons and positrons is maintained thanks to magnetic pair production close to the surface .",
    "the non - negligible electric voltage along the magnetic field lines and the radiative force due to compton scattering regulate the streams of positrons and electrons along the field line .",

    "the analysis of the evolution of the spin period allowed us to find three different timing solutions between 2013 april 29 and 2014 august 30 , which show that the source period derivative has changed at least twice , from 6.6@xmath5 s  s@xmath3 in 2013 april at the outburst onset , to 3.3@xmath6 s  s@xmath3 in 2014 august . while the first @xmath111 change could be related with the occurrence of an sgr - like burst ( kaspi et al .",

    "<S> in 2013 april a new magnetar , , was discovered as it entered an outburst , at only 2.4 arcsec angular distance from the supermassive black hole at the centre of the milky way , sagittarius a@xmath0 .  </S>",
    "<S> has a surface dipolar magnetic field of @xmath1 g , and it is the neutron star closest to a black hole ever observed . </S>",
    "<S> the new source was detected both in the radio and x - ray bands , with a peak x - ray luminosity @xmath2erg  s@xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> here we report on the long - term _ chandra _ ( 25 observations ) and _ xmm  newton _ ( 8 observations ) x - ray monitoring campaign of from the onset of the outburst in april 2013 until september 2014 . </S>",
    "<S> this unprecedented dataset allows us to refine the timing properties of the source , as well as to study the outburst spectral evolution as a function of time and rotational phase . </S>",
    "<S> our timing analysis confirms the increase in the spin period derivative by a factor of @xmath42 around june 2013 , and reveals that a further increase occurred between 2013 oct 30 and 2014 feb 21 . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the period derivative changed from 6.6@xmath5 s  s@xmath3 to 3.3@xmath6 s  s@xmath3 in 1.5 yr . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> this magnetar shows a slow flux decay compared to other magnetars and a rather inefficient surface cooling . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , starquake - induced crustal cooling models alone have difficulty in explaining the high luminosity of the source for the first @xmath4200days of its outburst , and additional heating of the star surface from currents flowing in a twisted magnetic bundle is probably playing an important role in the outburst evolution .    </S>",
