    "hamiltonian chaotic dynamics is related to the description of irregular trajectories in phase space .",
    "this characteristic is closely linked to the instability of the system and the entropy growth ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "chaotic dynamics is in fact associated with positive lyapunov coefficients , which corresponds , through the pesin equality @xcite , to a positive kolmogorov - sinai entropy rate @xcite .",
    "however , many physical , biological , economical and other complex systems exhibit more intricate situations , associated to a phase space that reveals complicated patterns and anomalous , not strongly chaotic , dynamics @xcite . in many of these cases",
    ", the system displays an algebraic sensitivity to initial conditions and the use of the boltzmann - gibbs ( bg ) entropic functional @xmath0 for the definition of quantities such as the kolmogorov - sinai entropy rate only provides trivial information .",
    "it has been first argued @xcite , then numerically exhibited @xcite , and finally analytically shown @xcite that under these conditions the nonextensive generalization @xcite of the bg entropic form adequately replaces these concepts .",
    "this generalization has been successfully checked for many cases where long - range interactions , long - range microscopic memory , some kind of fractalization of the phase space are inherent .",
    "indeed , in the case of one - dimensional dissipative maps , following pioneering work @xcite on asymptotic algebraic sensitivity to initial conditions , it has been numerically @xcite and analytically proved @xcite that the nonextensive formalism provides a meaningful description of the critical points where the lyapunov coefficient vanishes . moreover , through the nonextensive entropy it is possible to prove a remarkable generalization of the pesin equality @xcite .    on the basis of these results ,",
    "we present here a nonextensive approach to the description of complex behaviors associated to hamiltonian systems that satisfy the kolmogorov - arnold - moser ( kam ) requirements ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the phase space consists in this case of complicated mixtures of invariant kam - tori and chaotic regions .",
    "a chaotic region is in contact with critical kam - tori whose lyapunov coefficients are zero , and a chaotic orbit sticks to those tori repeatedly with a power - law distribution of sticking times ( see , e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "it is known that , under these conditions , one main generic characteristic feature of hamiltonian chaos is its _ nonergodicity _ , due to the existence of a finite measure of the regularity islands area .",
    "the set of islands is fractal , and thin strips near the islands boundary , which are termed boundary layers , play a crucial role in the system dynamics .",
    "in addition to these processes , there are effects that arise solely because of the high enough dimensionality of the system .",
    "one of these effects is arnold diffusion @xcite , that occurs if the number of degrees of freedom of the hamiltonian system is larger than two @xcite . in general , for the usual case of many - body short - range - interacting hamiltonian systems , the combination of these nonlinear dynamical phenomena typically makes the system to leave the generic situation of nonergodicity and eventually yields _",
    "ergodicity_.    along these lines , anomalous effects for the sensitivity to initial conditions and for the entropy production have already been investigated within the nonextensive formalism @xcite for a paradigmatic model that exhibits the kam structure , namely the well known standard map @xcite . in the present paper we focus on two symplectically coupled standard maps .",
    "the choice of _ two _ coupled maps is because this is the lowest possible dimension ( @xmath1 ) of hamiltonian maps where arnold diffusion does take place , an effect that has a fundamental impact for the macroscopic effects associated with the dynamics of the system , since it guarantees an unique ( connected ) chaotic sea ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .    in ref .",
    "@xcite it was numerically shown that , for low - dimensional hamiltonian ( hence symplectic ) maps , the kolmogorov - sinai entropy rate @xmath2 coincides with the entropy @xmath3 produced per unit time by the dynamical evolution of a statistical ensemble of copies of the system that is initially set far - from - equilibrium , i.e. , @xmath4 .",
    "more precisely , considering an ensemble of @xmath5 copies of the map and a coarse graining partition of the phase space composed by @xmath6 nonoverlapping ( hyper)cells ( with nonvanishing @xmath7 hypervolumes ) , at each iteration step @xmath8 a probability distribution @xmath9 is defined by means of the occupation number @xmath10 of each cell , @xmath11 ( @xmath12 ) , and we have that @xmath13 where the average @xmath14 is taken considering the dynamical evolution of different ensembles , all starting far - from - equilibrium , but with different initial conditions . in this paper , as far - from - equilibrium initial conditions , we will consider an ensemble of @xmath5 copies of the map all randomly distributed inside a _ single _",
    "( hyper)cell of the partition . in this way",
    "the initial entropy is zero , since all but one probabilities vanish .",
    "averages are then obtained by sampling the whole phase space changing the position of the initial ( hyper)cell .    on the other hand , one can consider the sensitivity to initial conditions @xmath15 that in general depends on the phase space initial position @xmath16 and on the direction in the tangent space @xmath17 .",
    "if the system is chaotic , the exponential sensitivity to initial conditions defines a spectrum of @xmath7 lyapunov coefficients @xmath18 coupled in pairs ( @xmath7 being the phase space dimension ) , where each element of the pair is the opposite of the other ( symplectic structure ) . by the pesin identity we have that @xmath19 and the result in @xcite states then that @xmath20 where once again @xmath14 stands for average over different initial data",

    "the present results concern low - dimensional conservative ( hamiltonian ) maps , but the scenario we have described here may serve as well for the discussion of analogous effects arising when many maps are symplectically coupled ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , and even for the case of many - body interacting hamiltonian systems .",
    "short - range interactions would typically yield strong chaos , and long - range interactions may typically lead to weak chaos ( consistently with the results in @xcite ) .",
    "in fact , for isolated many - body long - range - interacting classical hamiltonians there are vast classes of initial conditions for which metastable ( or quasi - stationary ) states are currently observed , later on followed by a crossover to the usual boltzmann - gibbs thermal equilibrium ( see , for instance , @xcite ) .",
    "the duration of the metastable state _ diverges _ with the number @xmath5 of particles in the system , in such a way that the limits @xmath185 and @xmath186 do _ not _ commute .",
    "since it is known that such systems may have vanishing lyapunov spectrum , it is allowed to suspect that the scenario in the metastable state is similar to the weakly chaotic one described in the present paper , whereas the crossover to the bg equilibrium corresponds , in the system focused on here , to the crossover to the @xmath39 , strongly chaotic regime .",
    "these and other crucial aspects can in principle be verified , for instance , on systems with very many ( and not only two , as here ) symplectically coupled standard maps .",
    "they would provide insighful information about macroscopic systems and their possible universality classes of nonextensivity ( characterized by index(es ) @xmath22 ) .",
    "efforts along this line are surely welcome .",
