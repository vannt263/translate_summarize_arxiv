    "a classical result in representation theory of quivers is gabriel s theorem , stating that a connected quiver supports only finitely many irreducible representations ( i.e. , of indecomposable modules over the associated path algebra ) if and only if it is of type @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 .",
    "the classification of tame quivers as _ euclidean graphs _ , or _ extended dynkin diagrams _ , of type @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 came shortly afterwards . remarkably , any other quiver supports arbitrarily large families of indecomposable representations , i.e. , to be of _ wild representation type_.    in algebraic geometry , the relevant problem in representation theory of algebras concerns the complexity of the category of maximal cohen - macaulay modules over the coordinate ring @xmath6 $ ] of a closed subvariety @xmath7 defined over an algebraically closed field @xmath8 . for @xmath9 , assuming @xmath6 $ ] to be cohen - macaulay ( so @xmath10 is said to be arithmetically cohen - macaulay , briefly acm ) , these in turn correspond to acm sheaves , namely coherent sheaves @xmath11 on @xmath10 without intermediate cohomology i.e. satisfying @xmath12 for all @xmath13 and @xmath14 . for hypersurfaces , in view of @xcite these modules also correspond to matrix factorizations , which in turn are related to mirror symmetry , cf .",
    "@xcite .    in this sense , reduced projective acm varieties of finite cm type have been classified in @xcite , cf . also @xcite . their list ( for positive dimension )",
    "consists of rational normal curves , projective spaces , smooth quadrics , the veronese surface in @xmath15 and the cubic scroll in @xmath16 .",
    "this ties in with grothendieck s classical result on the splitting of vector bundles over @xmath17 , @xcite , in turn rooted in ideas of segre , @xcite .    our goal here is to tell what happens to other varieties .",
    "smooth cubic surfaces are of wild cm type according to the main point of @xcite .",
    "some more varieties have been proved to fall in this class , for instance all segre varieties besides the cm finite ones ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) , del pezzo surfaces ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) , positive - dimensional hypersurfaces of degree at least @xmath18 and some complete intersections ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) some fano varieties ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) , the triple veronese embedding of any variety ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) .    as for cm tame projective varieties ,",
    "besides smooth elliptic curves ( by seminal work of atiyah , @xcite , also related to classical work of segre , cf @xcite ) and rational chains of type @xmath3 ( cf .",
    "@xcite , cf .",
    "also @xcite ) , the only known examples were given in @xcite and consist of smooth quartic surface scrolls in @xmath15 .",
    "here we prove the following result .",
    "let @xmath19 be a closed integral acm subvariety of positive dimension which is not a cone .",
    "then @xmath10 is of wild cm type unless @xmath10 is one of the following :    a.   [ linear ] a linear subspace ; b.   [ quadric ] a smooth quadric ; c.   [ rnc ] a rational normal curve ; d.   [ elliptic ] a smooth or nodal curve of arithmetic genus @xmath20 ; e.   [ scroll ] a smooth rational surface scroll of degree @xmath21 ; f.   [ veronese ] the veronese surface in @xmath15 .",
    "our result implies a strong version of the finite - tame - wild trichotomy for the class of varieties appearing in the previous theorem , namely that any such variety @xmath10 falls in exactly one of the following classes :    * there are only finitely many indecomposable acm sheaves over @xmath10 up to isomorphism .",

    "* for any given rank @xmath23 , the parameter space of indecomposable non - isomorphic acm sheaves of rank at most @xmath23 consists of the union of finitely many isolated points and connected curves of genus @xmath24 ( in case and @xmath25 ) or @xmath20 ( in case ) .",
    "* @xmath10 is of wild cm type in the algebraic sense and hence in the geometric sense , i.e. @xmath10 admits families of arbitrarily large dimension of indecomposable non - isomorphic acm sheaves .    it should be noted that , although our assumptions on the variety @xmath10 are rather mild , a different behaviour might be expected when relaxing them .",
    "for instance a quadric cone of corank @xmath20 is cm countable , cf .",
    "@xcite ; several other examples of this kind exist over local rings , cf .",
    "for instance @xcite for a detailed picture , see also @xcite .",
    "more varieties of tame type appear from germs of elliptic singularities , cf .",
    "@xcite or from non - isolated affine surface singularities , see also @xcite .",
    "let us indicate the strategy of our proof .",
    "let @xmath26 be a variety of the class under examination : an integral closed acm subscheme of @xmath27 which is not a cone .",
    "the first step is to isolate some essential datum in order to build large families of indecomposable non - isomorphic mcm modules on @xmath28 $ ] . in theorem",
    "[ strictly wild by extensions ] we establish that this should be a pair of acm sheaves @xmath29 and @xmath30 on @xmath26 , whose only endomorphisms are homotheties ( i.e. @xmath29 and @xmath30 are _ simple _ ) , having no non - trivial maps in either direction @xmath31 or @xmath32 and such that the extension space @xmath33 is sufficiently large , namely of dimension @xmath34 .",
    "indeed , from this datum we construct a fully faithful exact functor from the category @xmath35 of finite - dimensional representations of the kronecker quiver @xmath36 with @xmath37 arrows to the category @xmath38}$ ] of mcm modules over @xmath28 $ ] .",
    "this quiver should be seen as parametrizing acm sheaves appearing as extension of copies of @xmath29 and @xmath30 . in turn , by a standard argument , the existence of such functor suffices to prove cm wildness of @xmath26 .",
    "however , constructing the sheaves @xmath29 and @xmath30 turns out to be quite complicated in general .",
    "for this we need our next result , theorem [ stable ff ] , which shows how to deduce cm wildness of @xmath10 from cm wildness of @xmath26 when @xmath26 is a linear section of @xmath10 of codimension @xmath39 . for this",
    ", we need to further assume that @xmath29 and @xmath30 are ulrich sheaves , i.e. their modules of global sections have the maximal number of generators .",
    "we see this as a further prove of the importance of these sheaves , cf .",
    "we also need the extra assumption @xmath40 , which turns out to hold everywhere except for varieties of minimal degree , where in turn we do not need it .",
    "the idea of theorem [ stable ff ] is that taking the @xmath41-th syzygy @xmath42}$ ] of the @xmath6$]-module of an mcm module @xmath43 over @xmath28 $ ] one obtains an mcm module over @xmath6 $ ] and that this entails no essential loss of information if @xmath43 is ulrich .",
    "in fact , for @xmath44}^c$ ] to be a functor we need to pass to the stable category @xmath45}$ ] where we quotient out by morphisms factoring through a free module .",
    "the point is that the stable syzygy functor @xmath46 is fully faithful on ulrich modules .",
    "the proof of this fact relies on a duality argument and on cohomology vanishing of ulrich sheaves .",
    "the next result , theorem [ embedding ] , shows how to put these two ingredients together .",
    "indeed , by resolving over @xmath6 $ ] the module of global sections of the universal extension of the sheaves @xmath30 by @xmath29 over @xmath26 needed for theorem [ strictly wild by extensions ] and taking its @xmath41-th syzygy , we get a functor @xmath47 whose stabilization is fully faithful by theorem [ stable ff ] .",
    "then the functor itself is not quite fully faithful , nevertheless is a _ representation embedding _ , i.e. it sends non - isomorphic ( resp .",
    "irreducible ) representations to non - isomorphic ( resp .",
    "indecomposable ) modules , and this suffices to show cm wildness of @xmath10 .    summing up , it only remains to construct the ulrich sheaves @xmath29 and @xmath30 as above over a linear section @xmath26 of @xmath10 , which we take to be of dimension @xmath20 when the sectional genus @xmath48 of @xmath10 is at least @xmath49 , or of dimension @xmath49 for @xmath50 .",
    "this is the content of  [ ony ] , which we now review .",
    "we first take care of the case @xmath51 , i.e. of varieties of minimal degree . here",
    ", our assumptions combined with del pezzo and bertini s classification say that @xmath10 is a rational normal scroll or the veronese surface in @xmath15 , and these varieties are easily dealt with .",
    "note that here is where all cm - finite cases appear , together with the two sporadic cases given by the two rational quartic surface scrolls .",
    "next , the case @xmath52 is quite easily seen to provide only cm wild varieties , as @xmath29 and @xmath30 can be taken to be sufficiently general bundles of rank @xmath49 over @xmath26 of slope @xmath53 .    finally , in the case @xmath54 our proof of the existence of @xmath29 and @xmath30 is based on a detailed study of ulrich sheaves on surfaces of almost minimal degree .",
    "when @xmath26 smooth ( i.e. @xmath26 is a del pezzo surface ) or even just normal , this can be carried out via the well - known hartshorne - serre construction associated with general sets of @xmath55 points of @xmath26 . on the other hand , when @xmath26 is not normal , we take @xmath29 and @xmath30 to be ulrich sheaves of rank @xmath20 which are not locally free , in fact the main point is to bound from below the number of independent global sections of the first local @xmath56 sheaf between @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "to accomplish this , according to the classification of these surfaces , it suffices to settle a finite number of cases . in the main one ( when @xmath26 is normalized by a scroll ) we define @xmath29 and @xmath30 to be direct images of certain line bundles via the normalization map @xmath57 , and reduce the result to counting the intersection points of the moving part of the associated curves .",
    "let @xmath8 be an algebraically closed field , and let @xmath58 $ ] be the graded polynomial ring in @xmath59 indeterminates .",
    "write @xmath6 $ ] for the homogeneous coordinate ring of a closed subscheme @xmath10 of @xmath60 , and @xmath61 for the restriction to @xmath10 of @xmath62 .",
    "we first recall some basic terminology for various cohen - macaulay properties of varieties , sheaves and modules .",

    "the first two statements concerning morphisms are clear since we can suppose that @xmath11 and @xmath75 are stable with the same slope . for the first statement , since @xmath11 is locally free , we have @xmath428 . tensoring the short exact sequence [ serre ] by @xmath429 and considering the associated long exact sequence of global sections , since @xmath430",
    ", we get an isomorphism @xmath431    on the other hand , the exact sequence defining @xmath432 twisted by @xmath433 reads : @xmath434 taking into account that @xmath435 we obtain @xmath436 .",
    "then , tensoring by @xmath429 taking global sections and combining with we get : @xmath437 now we know that @xmath438 has @xmath439 independent global sections , as @xmath11 is ulrich . on the other hand , since @xmath185 has length @xmath395 , so that @xmath440 is just a vector space of rank @xmath49 concentrated at @xmath395 points , hence @xmath441 . we conclude that @xmath442 .",
    "we may argue that this proposition says that any surface @xmath26 of almost minimal degree supports infinitely many ulrich bundles of rank @xmath49 with determinant @xmath433 , in particular any cubic surface admits ( over an algebraically closed field ) infinitely many pfaffian representations .",
    "the normal case is now complete by virtue of theorem [ embedding ] .",
    "this time @xmath26 is a non - normal acm surface of degree @xmath175 in @xmath389 , we let @xmath443 be the normalization of @xmath26 and @xmath444 the normalization map . it turns out that these surfaces are completely classified cf .",
    "@xcite , and that @xmath364 is a rational normal scroll or a veronese surface . also , the locus where @xmath445 is not an isomorphism is a line @xmath446 and @xmath447 is a conic in @xmath443 . in this subsection",
    "we are going to treat the case when @xmath443 is a rational normal scroll leaving the case of the veronese surface for the next subsection .",
    "so let us consider the two non - isomorphic rank-1 ulrich bundles over @xmath443 , normalized so that they have @xmath175 independent global section , where @xmath448 is the degree of @xmath443 as a rational normal scroll , which is the same as the degree of @xmath26 .",
    "these line bundles are @xmath449 , where @xmath274 is a _",
    "fibre _ of the scroll map @xmath450 , i.e. @xmath274 is just a line of the scroll , and @xmath451 , where @xmath320 is the hyperplane section of @xmath443 .",
    "let us write @xmath452 and @xmath453 .",
    "we have : @xmath454      therefore , in order to conclude by theorem [ embedding ] , we only need to prove that in the cases @xmath460 either @xmath461 has dimension at least @xmath392 or that @xmath462 has dimension at least @xmath463 .",
    "luckily , these two cases are completely classified up to projective equivalence , cf .",
    "@xcite .",
    "we said that @xmath26 is not normal along a line @xmath43 .",
    "we have : @xmath464 in order to see this notice that the restriction of @xmath445 is @xmath465 as a map @xmath466 .",
    "therefore @xmath467 is locally free of rank @xmath49 over @xmath43 , and @xmath468 , so we get an exact sequence : @xmath469 where @xmath470 is a line bundle on @xmath43 . from the previous exact sequence we have @xmath471 , namely @xmath472 .",
    "next we may compute a locally free resolution of @xmath474 ( in fact the sheafified minimal graded free resolution of the module of global sections of @xmath474 ) over @xmath26 , relying on the classification appearing in @xcite .",
    "this reads , when @xmath25 : @xmath475 and for @xmath22 : @xmath476          a general global section of @xmath480 vanishes along a rational normal curve @xmath356 of degree @xmath423 in @xmath443 , while any non - zero global section of @xmath481 vanishes along the union @xmath0 of @xmath423 fibres , which are pairwise disjoint lines contained in @xmath443 .",
    "all this is clear from the description of divisors on @xmath443 , independently on the characteristic of @xmath8 .",
    "it turns out that the zero locus of a general global section of @xmath29 is a curve @xmath482 which is the union of @xmath483 and @xmath43 , and the same happens to @xmath30 with obvious notation .",
    "we write @xmath484 and @xmath485 , so @xmath486 and @xmath487 .",
    "actually @xmath488 cuts @xmath43 at a single point @xmath489 , while @xmath490 cuts @xmath43 at @xmath423 points @xmath491 , one for each component of @xmath490 .",
    "both @xmath482 and @xmath492 are acm curves in @xmath26 .",
    "when @xmath356 is smooth ( which happens if the defining section of @xmath480 is general enough ) , setting @xmath48 ( resp .",
    "@xmath493 ) for a point of @xmath356 ( resp . of @xmath488 ) , we get : @xmath494 we also have : @xmath495    there is an exact commutative diagram : @xmath496 & { \\mathscr{o}}_y \\ar[d ] \\ar[r ] & { \\mathscr{a}}\\ar[r ] \\ar@{=}[d ] & { \\mathscr{a}}|_{\\ha } \\ar[d]\\ar[r ] & 0 \\\\ 0 \\ar[r ] & \\sigma_*{\\mathscr{o}}_\\ty \\ar[r ] & { \\mathscr{a}}\\ar[r ] & { \\mathscr{a}}|_{a ' } \\ar[r ] & 0 \\\\ } \\ ] ] this induces : @xmath497            first",
    ", we replace each instance of @xmath0 in the diagram by @xmath356 and we apply @xmath500 to the first row of the resulting exact commutative diagram .",
    "since @xmath29 is locally cm we get an isomorphism : @xmath501          we first note that easily implies @xmath509 since @xmath490 and @xmath356 meet transversely along @xmath488 , i.e. away from the non - normal locus @xmath43 . in turn , this sheaf is obviously isomorphic to @xmath510 .",
    "so we would like to check that @xmath510 has length @xmath423 by showing that it has rank @xmath20 over each of the points @xmath491 of @xmath511 .",
    "looking at each point @xmath512 we have to show that the line @xmath513 defined as the irreducible component of @xmath490 passing through @xmath512 satisfies @xmath514 .",
    "the situation is local , and the cases @xmath22 and @xmath25 do not differ in this sense , so we just look at @xmath22 .",
    "we consider the sheafified minimal graded free resolution of the module of global sections of @xmath515 , which in turn looks precisely like with @xmath43 replaced with @xmath516 .",
    "of course , @xmath517 , and we see that @xmath518 , where @xmath519 is the residual conic of @xmath516 with respect to a plane section of @xmath26 containing @xmath516 .",
    "write @xmath520 for the restriction of @xmath521 to @xmath522 .",
    "next we observe that , since @xmath516 meets @xmath43 transversely at @xmath512 , the sheaf @xmath523 is just the dual over @xmath43 of @xmath524 , that is @xmath525 .",
    "the curve @xmath519 also meets @xmath43 transversely at @xmath512 , so : @xmath526        to continue our computation , we observe that the sheaf @xmath499 is locally free of rank @xmath49 over @xmath43 .",
    "this follows from , and since @xmath531 and @xmath532 locally behave like @xmath533 , so @xmath30 and @xmath29 locally behave like @xmath534 .",
    "then @xmath535 for @xmath536 , because we have just seen that the middle sheaf is locally free over @xmath43 in view of and the leftmost sheaf has finite length .",
    "it remains to compute @xmath539 .",
    "observe that in order to finish we have to show @xmath540 . to get this",
    ", we apply @xmath541 to after replacing @xmath0 with @xmath356 . using",
    ", it is easy to observe that : @xmath542 note that @xmath543 is supported at @xmath488 for all @xmath504 and @xmath544 is locally free over @xmath43 , so we see get an exact sequence : @xmath545      according to @xcite there are @xmath49 inequivalent integral non - normal cubic surfaces which are not cones in characteristic different from @xmath49 , and one more in characteristic @xmath49 ; the normalization of all of them is a smooth cubic scroll in @xmath16 . also , there are three inequivalent integral non - normal surfaces of degree @xmath18 in @xmath16 whose normalization is a quartic scroll and which are not cones , one of them appearing in characteristic @xmath49 .",
    "all these cases can be treated with the method we outlined .",
    "the computations sketched here can also be carried out explicitly with macaulay2 , @xcite , cf .",
    "the webpage http://dfaenzi.perso.math.cnrs.fr/code/cm-wild      we still have to study the case when @xmath443 is the veronese surface .",
    "again there is a line @xmath446 which is the non - normal locus of @xmath26 . in this case , the two quadrics threefolds @xmath549 whose equations generate @xmath550 can be chosen so that @xmath551 is singular along a line @xmath552 .",
    "the intersection @xmath553 consists a double point @xmath554 whose reduced structure @xmath104 lies in @xmath43 . also , @xmath555 is a cone over a point @xmath556 .",
    "then , @xmath551 admits a unique linear symmetric determinantal representation by a @xmath557 matrix whose cokernel @xmath371 is a rank-1 ulrich sheaf on @xmath551 with @xmath49 independent global sections , corresponding to a pencil of planes @xmath558 in @xmath551 . on the other hand",
    "@xmath555 supports two non - isomorphic rank-1 ulrich sheaves @xmath372 and @xmath559 , one for each of the two distinct pencils of planes @xmath560 and @xmath561 in @xmath555 .",
    "we define : @xmath562      moreover , @xmath29 and @xmath30 are not isomorphic , as one can see by comparing the curves associated with them .",
    "indeed , the curves associated with @xmath29 corresponding to decomposable tensors in @xmath563 are reducible of the form @xmath564 , and these curves can not appear as zero locus of global sections in @xmath565 , as @xmath561 would lie in the same pencil as @xmath560 .",
    "it follows that : @xmath566 as any morphism @xmath567 would be an isomorphism , since the source and target are torsionfree of rank @xmath20 with the same hilbert polynomial , and the variety @xmath26 is integral .",
    "it remains to compute @xmath568 .",
    "we would like to show that this vector space has dimension @xmath392 , which suffices to conclude by theorem [ embedding ] .",
    "note that @xmath371 is locally free away from @xmath70 , while @xmath372 and @xmath559 are locally free except at @xmath48 , so that @xmath29 is locally free away from @xmath48 and @xmath104 .",
    "the same happens to @xmath30 , in particular @xmath499 is supported ( set - theoretically ) at @xmath48 and @xmath104 so it has finite length . by our analysis of reducible curves appearing as zero loci of sections of decomposable tensors in @xmath29 , we see that the only singularity of such a curve is , when @xmath558 and @xmath560 are general enough , the point @xmath569 .",
    "therefore a general global section of @xmath29 will vanish on a smooth irreducible curve , actually a rational normal quartic @xmath0 in @xmath26 , and one has : @xmath570 where @xmath571 and @xmath572 are invertible on @xmath0 and @xmath356 .",
    "any such curve @xmath0 or @xmath356 contains @xmath554 and @xmath48 . also",
    ", two curves @xmath0 and @xmath356 corresponding to sufficiently general global sections of @xmath29 and @xmath30 intersect at the length-@xmath392 subscheme consisting of the fixed points @xmath554 and @xmath48 , and moreover at @xmath392 more simple points @xmath573 which move along with the choice of @xmath0 and @xmath356 .",
    "this says that @xmath574 has length @xmath575 and is supported at @xmath554 , @xmath48 , @xmath576 , @xmath577 , @xmath578 .",
    "recall that @xmath30 is ulrich and has thus @xmath18 independent global sections . on the other hand",
    ", one immediately computes @xmath582 and @xmath583 , while of course @xmath584 .",
    "so applying @xmath585 to the second sequence of one gets : @xmath586 using these sequences and we finally obtain @xmath587 .    in characteristic @xmath49 , there is another surface @xmath26 of degree @xmath18 , not projectively equivalent to @xmath26 , whose normalization is the veronese surface , cf .",
    "case 8 of @xcite .",
