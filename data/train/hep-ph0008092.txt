    "flavor changing neutral current ( fcnc ) @xmath5 decays do not occur at tree level in the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "being loop induced , they feel scales of order @xmath6 and in principle much higher ones , making them important probes of the flavor sector of the sm and beyond .",
    "rare radiative @xmath3 decays proceed via so - called electromagnetic penguins .",
    "they have been measured in exclusive @xmath7 @xcite and inclusive @xmath8 @xcite decays . in dilepton channels",
    "@xmath9 ( @xmath1 ) , we identify two additional structures in the feynman diagrams : boxes and @xmath4-penguins . none of the dilepton modes has been detected to date , but we expect large data samples from operating @xmath10-factories ( cleo , babar , belle ) , dedicated @xmath10-physics programmes at colliders ( tevatron run ii , hera - b ) and lhc - b in the long term . corresponding @xmath11 transition amplitudes are ckm suppressed @xmath12 .",
    "the existing best bound in the dimuon channels for inclusive decays is @xmath13 at 90% c.l .",
    "@xcite , which is one order of magnitude above the nlo sm expectation @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "note that the nnlo calculation in @xmath9 is only partially available @xcite .",
    "corresponding bounds for the exclusive channels are @xmath15 , @xmath16 at 90% c.l . @xcite and their respective sm predictions are @xmath17 , @xmath18 with the dominant theoretical uncertainty resulting from hadronic matrix elements , which are estimated here using light cone sum rules @xcite .",
    "currently , the exclusive @xmath19 decay has the most interesting bound , which is only a factor of 2 away from the sm prediction . despite larger theoretical uncertainty than in the inclusive cases ,",
    "rare exclusive decays are more accessible experimentally in the near future and have observables ( e.g.  existence and position of the zero of the forward - backward asymmetry discussed below ) , which are as clean as the respective ones in the inclusive modes .",
    "the calculational tool for the description of @xmath20 decays is the low energy effective hamiltonian @xmath21 @xcite .",
    "this enables the analysis of relevant observables in a model independent way , with the goal being to extract the wilson coefficients @xmath22 from data @xcite .",
    "the mayor player is the @xmath23 vertex @xmath24 .",
    "its effective coupling strength @xmath25 is related to the branching ratio @xmath26 thus @xmath27 @xcite which is in good agreement with the sm value @xmath28 at @xmath29 at leading log .",
    "we see that the @xmath3 data fix the modulus of @xmath25 , but not its sign ( phase )",
    ".    in @xmath9 decays , in addition to @xmath30 , also 4-fermi operators involving dileptons contribute , given by @xmath31 , @xmath32 . due to the charge assignments of lepton-@xmath4 couplings",
    "the @xmath4-penguin contribution to @xmath33 is suppressed with respect to @xmath34 by @xmath35 .",
    "we thus identify @xmath34 as a measure of the @xmath36 coupling modulo the box contribution @xcite .",
    "decomposition of the @xmath37 branching ratio yields @xmath38 @xcite . using the cdf bound @xcite on this mode and allowing @xmath25 to have both sm - like and sm - opposite signs gives the present best bound on the strength of generic fcnc @xmath4-penguins of @xmath39 , which is a factor of 2 - 3 larger than the sm value @xmath40 @xcite .",
    "scenarios with non - standard @xmath4-penguins arise in many extensions of the sm like such as supersymmetry , 4th generation and @xmath41 @xcite .",
    "another interesting possibility to test the @xmath36 vertex arises in @xmath42 decays , since here no photon penguins contribute .",
    "supersymmetric effects in inclusive @xmath9 decays have been studied in @xcite .",
    "the reach of a new physics search in the dilepton invariant mass distribution in @xmath44 decays is exemplified in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] @xcite .",
    "supergravity ( sugra ) ( dotted ) and a supersymmetric scenario with non - minimal sources of flavor violation in the mass insertion approximation ( dashed ) , can be well discriminated from the sm ( solid ) and its hadronic uncertainties ( shaded area ) ; the upper curves contain resonant @xmath45 background via @xmath46 , lower ones are pure short - distance contributions @xcite .",
    "note that the dashed curve saturates the experimental bound in this channel .",
    "similar findings are valid for @xmath47 decays , which however show less sensitivity to @xmath25 as the photon pole at @xmath48 is absent . in either case @xmath49 ( opposite - to - sm sign )",
    "enhances the rates through constructive interference of @xmath25 with @xmath33 .",
    "the forward - backward asymmetry in @xmath2 decays results from v / a interference in the lepton pair @xmath50 , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] @xcite ; see @xcite for a discussion of the sign of @xmath51 , which is opposite to the forward - backward asymmetry @xmath52 of the cp conjugate channel in the cp conserving limit . in the sm ( @xmath53 , solid curve ) , @xmath51 has a zero around @xmath54 , which would disappear if @xmath25 would have the opposite sign ( long - short - dashed curve ) .",
    "the existence of a zero in the forward - backward asymmetry in @xmath2 decays below the @xmath55 resonance is an important test of the sm and is independent of hadronic matrix elements @xcite .",
    "positive @xmath25 occurs generically in supersymmetric theories @xcite , but only for large @xmath56 in relaxed and/or minimal sugra @xcite .",
    "further , the position of the zero @xmath57 has very small hadronic uncertainties @xcite . in the limit where the final hadron has large energy , i.e. , small dilepton mass ,",
    "the large energy effective theory @xcite is applicable and here all form factors cancel out in the ratios which determines @xmath57 @xcite .",
    "a recently proposed observable , the forward - backward cp asymmetry @xmath58 in @xmath2 decays probes the phase of @xmath34 or of the @xmath36 vertex @xcite , respectively .",
    "defined as @xmath59 , its magnitude scales with @xmath60 , where @xmath61 contains contributions from resonant and non - resonant @xmath62 states @xcite ; @xmath63 below threshold , so it is sizeable only in the high dilepton mass region .",
    "integration over @xmath64 yields @xmath65 , which can be large in the case of @xmath66 phases .",
    "hadronic uncertainties are not small , but the sm background is below @xmath67 and any effect above this would be due to a non - sm source of cp violation @xcite .",
    "the sm branching ratio in @xmath8 decays is known at nlo with 10 % accuracy @xmath68 @xcite .",
    "this is in good agreement with data from lep @xmath69 @xcite , and cleo , @xmath70 @xcite .",
    "a promising observable in @xmath3 decays where dramatic signals of possible physics beyond the sm could show up is the cp asymmetry in the rate @xmath71 @xcite .",
    "it is very tiny in the sm since @xmath72 , @xmath73 are wolfenstein parameters , thus @xmath74 @xcite",
    ". however , large effects of ( 10 - 50 ) % are possible in scenarios with an enhanced chromo - magnetic dipole operator @xmath75 in the @xmath76 vertex .",
    "cp asymmetry in exclusive @xmath7 decays has a less clean prediction due to strong phases , however , in the sm , @xmath77 holds @xcite .",
    "any significant deviation from this would signal new physics . in both inclusive @xmath78 @xcite and exclusive cases @xmath79 @xcite ,",
    "the measurements are not conclusive yet .",
    "theoretically clear signatures of possible new physics can be experimentally isolated in @xmath3 and @xmath9 decays in the near future via the observables ( @xmath80 ) .",
    "it is exciting to see whether the sm passes this next round of fcnc tests .",
