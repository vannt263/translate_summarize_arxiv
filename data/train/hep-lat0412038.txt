    "two quite different aspects of the studies of qcd thermodynamics on the lattice gained most attention in the heavy ion community during recent years  studies of the qcd phase diagram at non - zero baryon chemical potential and the analysis of the influence of a thermal heat bath on basic properties of hadrons , eg .",
    "their masses and widths . here",
    "we will concentrate on the former .",
    "for a recent discussion of in - medium properties of hadrons we refer to the proceedings of this years quark matter @xcite and lattice @xcite conferences .",
    "lattice calculations at vanishing baryon chemical potential , @xmath0 , suggest that for physical values of the quark masses the transition to the high temperature phase of qcd is just a rapid crossover rather than a phase transition which would be signaled by singularities in bulk thermodynamic observables .",
    "on the other hand many qcd motivated model calculations suggest that for @xmath1 and small values of the temperature the transition indeed is a first order phase transition .",
    "this suggests that somewhere in the interior of the phase diagram there exists a second order phase transition point ( chiral critical point ) as an end point of a line of first order transitions . for vanishing light quark masses this point would be a tri - critical point @xcite which",
    ", with increasing value of the strange quark mass , is expected to move towards lower values of @xmath0 and eventually could reach the @xmath2 axis .",
    "the expected generic phase diagram for physical values of the quark masses is shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : phased ] .",
    "its exploration for large temperatures and small values of the baryon chemical potential became accessible to lattice calculations through the application of different techniques such as ferrenberg - swendsen reweighting @xcite , taylor series expansions @xcite as well as through simulations with an imaginary chemical potential @xcite .",
    "this led to a first analysis of the baryonic contribution to bulk thermodynamic observables like the pressure , baryon number density and various susceptibilities @xcite .",
    "moreover , it provided first estimates for the location of the chiral critical point @xcite at which the transition to the high temperature phase of qcd turns from a rapid crossover into a first order phase transition ; recent calculations suggest a critical value @xmath3  mev @xcite .",
    "we will discuss these results in more detail in section 3 .",
    "however , before turning to this it seems appropriate to briefly review results on the qcd transition at vanishing baryon chemical potential where we try to emphasize the role of the strange quark in qcd thermodynamics .",
    "we will do so in section 2 .",
    "section 4 is devoted to a comparison of lattice results on thermodynamics in the low temperature hadronic phase at @xmath4 with a phenomenological approach in terms of a hadron resonance gas model .",
    "this has been discussed in more detail at this conference by k. redlich @xcite .",
    "for @xmath5 the transition from the low temperature hadronic phase to the high temperature phase has been analyzed in many numerical calculations .",
    "in particular , it has been found that for the case of qcd with three degenerate light quarks the transition is first order .",
    "in fact , the use of improved discretization schemes for the fermionic part of the qcd lagrangian has shifted this regime to rather small values of the quark masses which correspond to a pion mass even below its physically realized value @xcite .",
    "this strongly suggests that the transition is continuous for the physically realized spectrum of two light ( @xmath6)-quarks and a heavier @xmath7-quark .",
    "a second order phase transition can then only show up at non - vanishing chemical potential if the hyper - surface of @xmath8-order phase transition , in which also the line of @xmath8-order transitions found at @xmath2 in the ( @xmath9)-plane lies , bends over the physical point .",
    "this situation is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : phased](right ) .",
    "the left hand part of this figure shows the resulting phase diagram of qcd with the physically realized mass spectrum .",
    "the transition to the high temperature phase of qcd commonly is related to the restoration of chiral symmetry as well as deconfinement , _",
    "i.e. _ the disappearance of an almost massless pion as a goldstone particle and the sudden liberation of quark and gluon degrees of freedom .",
    "this is , indeed , reflected in the temperature dependence of the chiral condensate @xcite and the the pressure @xcite shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : chiral ] .",
    "these figures also indicate that the presence of strange quarks with a mass @xmath10 has little influence on the thermodynamics in the low temperature phase .",
    "the temperature and quark mass dependence of the light quark chiral condensate in qcd with two light and a heavier strange quark is similar to that of qcd with 3 degenerate ( light ) quarks . at @xmath11 , however , the strange quarks with a mass @xmath12 do not yet contribute significantly to the pressure or energy density .",
    "consequently the transition temperature in 2 and ( 2 + 1)-flavor qcd has been found to be quite similar . in the high temperature phase , on the other hand , bulk thermodynamic observables clearly reflect the presence of the additional strange quark degrees of freedom the strange quark mass has been taken to be proportional to the temperature , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath13const .",
    "if one keeps instead @xmath14 fixed to its physical value the pressure will gradually approach the high temperature limit of 3-flavor qcd .",
    "this can be inferred , for instance , from the calculation performed in @xcite . ] .",
    "this suggests that at least at @xmath2 the strange quark has little influence on the dynamics of the transition .",
    "the calculations performed with improved actions @xcite indicate that for the physically realized quark mass spectrum the transition to the high temperature phase is signaled by a rapid but continuous change in bulk thermodynamic observables .",
    "the transition temperature of ( 2 + 1)-flavor qcd found in a recent analysis with the naik action @xcite , @xmath15 is consistent with earlier findings for 2-flavor qcd based on simulations with the p4-action , @xmath16 @xcite .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction different approaches have been followed to study the phase structure of qcd at non - vanishing baryon chemical potential and to determine basic thermodynamic observables .",
    "all these approaches are currently limited to the regime of large temperatures and @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the quark chemical potential .",
    "we will concentrate here on a discussion of taylor expansions of the partition function of 2-flavor qcd around @xmath2 .    at fixed temperature and small values of the chemical potential the pressure",
    "may be expanded in a taylor series around @xmath19 , @xmath20 where the expansion coefficients are given in terms of derivatives of @xmath21 , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath22 .",
    "the series is even in @xmath23 which reflects the invariance of @xmath24 under exchange of particles and anti - particles .. the first coefficient , @xmath25 , simply gives the pressure at @xmath19 shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : chiral](right ) .",
    "the next non - zero coefficient , @xmath26 , is proportional to the quark number susceptibility at @xmath19 @xcite , @xmath27 its rise with temperature has been attributed to changes in the interaction among quarks and anti - quarks in the vector channel @xcite .",
    "further taylor expansion coefficients entering the calculation of the pressure have been analyzed now up to @xmath28 @xcite .",
    "the coefficients for @xmath29  4 and 6 are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : coefficients ] .    in the high temperature , ideal gas limit , only the first three expansion coefficients are non - zero , @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 . as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : coefficients ] at @xmath33 all coefficients reach their corresponding ideal gas values within @xmath34 .",
    "the next - to - leading order coefficient , @xmath35 , is strictly positive and develops a pronounced peak at the @xmath36 transition temperature , @xmath37 , which in turn , also leads to a large peak in the quark number susceptibility once @xmath38 @xcite ( see fig .",
    "5(right ) ) .",
    "this has been interpreted as an indication for an approach to the chiral critical point at which @xmath39 is expected to diverge , which diverges at a @xmath8 order transition point . ] .",
    "a new feature shows up in the expansion coefficients at @xmath40 .",
    "the coefficient @xmath41 is positive only below @xmath37 and changes sign in its vicinity .",
    "this has important consequences for the analytic structure of the qcd partition function and gives first hints at the convergence properties of the taylor series : if there exists a @xmath8 order phase transition point in the qcd phase diagram this would be related to a lee - yang zero of the qcd partition function for some real and positive value of @xmath42 .",
    "this critical value will be directly related to the radius of convergence , @xmath43 , of the taylor expansion , if the partition function has no further zeroes in the complex ( @xmath44)-plane closer to the origin .",
    "a sufficient condition for the radius of convergence to be due to a zero on the real ( @xmath44)-axis is that all expansion coefficients in the taylor series are positive .",
    "this apparently is the case for all @xmath45 analyzed so far at @xmath46 .",
    "ratios of subsequent expansion coefficients provide an estimate for the radius of convergence of the taylor series , @xmath47 these ratios are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ratios_coefficients](left ) .",
    "while the first ratio , @xmath48 is well determine in current lattice calculations the ratio @xmath49 still has large errors .",
    "it is , however , apparent that these ratios change drastically across @xmath37 and seem to be approximately temperature independent in the low temperature phase . as we will discuss in the next section this",
    "is expected to be the case also for a non - interacting resonance gas which has an infinite radius of convergence . at present , however , the large errors on @xmath50 prohibit to draw a firm conclusion on the asymptotic behavior of @xmath51 .",
    "similar caution is requested when interpreting the large fluctuations in the quark number densities signaled by the rapid rise of the quark number susceptibility ( see fig .",
    "as mentioned above we expect @xmath39 to diverge at a @xmath8 order transition point .",
    "the rapid increase of @xmath39 is , however , partly due to the rapid rise of @xmath52 itself as well as due to the rapid increase in the pressure for @xmath53 .",
    "a quantity reflecting the relative magnitude of fluctuations is given by the ratio , @xmath54 this quantity only depends on ratios of taylor expansion coefficients , and should vanish at a @xmath8 order phase transition point .",
    "its temperature dependence is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ratios_coefficients](right ) . as can be seen the ratio rises rapidly across @xmath37 and approaches the ideal gas value .",
    "it , however , does not show any sign for a drop in the vicinity of @xmath37 that could be taken as evidence for the existence of a second order transition .",
    "aside from the obviously rapid change of bulk thermodynamic observables at temperatures close to @xmath37 it is a striking feature of the taylor expansion that ratios of the expansion coefficients are , to a first approximation , temperature independent below @xmath37 and distinctively different from the ratios above @xmath37 .",
    "while for @xmath55 the ratios rapidly approach the corresponding ideal gas values their low temperature behavior can be understood in terms of the properties of a hadronic resonance gas @xcite . for @xmath56",
    "the baryonic contribution to the pressure arises entirely from hadrons , which have masses significantly larger than the relevant temperatures , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath57 .",
    "their contribution may be approximated by a non - interacting resonance gas obeying boltzmann statistics . the pressure is then given by , @xmath58 where @xmath59 contains all the information on the resonance mass spectrum . within this approximation",
    "the ratio of taylor expansion coefficients is given by @xmath60 and thus is indeed temperature independent .",
    "moreover , the ratios are not affected by details of the hadronic mass spectrum and , in particular , are not affected by the quark mass dependence of the hadron spectrum . a straightforward comparison with lattice calculations which generally are performed at unphysically large quark mass values thus is justified .",
    "similarly , the ratio @xmath61 is independent of the resonance spectrum @xmath59 and does not vary with temperature for fixed @xmath62 .",
    "these estimates are shown as straight lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : ratios_coefficients ] for temperatures below @xmath37 .",
    "of course , the simple form of the @xmath0-dependence in the resonance gas , eq .  [ resgas ] , does not lead to any critical behavior in its own . at all temperatures",
    "the quark number susceptibility will rise with increasing @xmath44 and for fixed @xmath44 it rapidly rises with temperature .",
    "moreover , as in the resonance gas model the dependence of e.g. the pressure on @xmath44 only appears through the factor @xmath63 the radius of convergence of a taylor expansion , of course , is infinite .",
    "_ i.e. _ @xmath64 .",
    "any unambiguous evidence for the existence of a chiral critical point in the qcd phase diagram thus should also show up as clear deviation from resonance gas behavior .    a direct comparison of resonance gas model calculations for thermodynamic observables like the pressure or susceptibility with lattice calculations is somewhat less stringent as it is necessary to adjust the resonance spectrum to the still unphysical conditions that , at present , could be realized on the lattice .",
    "the taylor series discussed in section  3 is based on lattice calculations performed with quark masses that correspond to a pseudo - scalar ( pion ) mass of about 770  mev . in this case",
    "the mass of the lightest baryonic state is about twice as large as the experimental value for the nucleon mass .",
    "this quark mass dependence of the baryon spectrum , @xmath65 , has been modeled using the ansatz @xmath66 @xcite , where @xmath67 is the experimental value of baryon resonances and @xmath68 is the pseudo - scalar meson mass used in the lattice calculations .",
    "a comparison with the first expansion coefficient which only depends on the baryonic part of the spectrum , receives contributions from the mesonic as well as the baryonic part of the spectrum . ] , @xmath69 , shows that the temperature dependence for @xmath70 is well reproduced with @xmath71 . with this",
    "also the temperature dependence of the quark number susceptibility is well described by the resonance gas in the low temperature phase ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : spectrum ] ) .",
    "this comparison can be extended to the meson sector contributing to @xmath72 at @xmath2 or to other quantum number channels controlled by other combinations of the quark chemical potentials , for instance the iso - vector channel with @xmath73 .",
    "also in these cases lattice results for thermodynamic observables at low temperature are well described by a hadronic resonance gas model @xcite .",
    "we have shown that the thermodynamics of qcd at small values of the baryon chemical potential can well be studied in terms of a taylor expansion of the logarithm of the qcd partition function .",
    "in fact , a @xmath74 order expansion seems to be quite sufficient for a reliable determination of the change in pressure as well as a determination of the temperature dependence of the net baryon number density for @xmath75 .",
    "the good agreement between lattice results in the low temperature hadronic phase and resonance gas models is on the one hand conceptually appealing as the resonance gas model has also been so successful in the description of experimental data on observed particle ratios in heavy ion collisions @xcite . on the other hand",
    "it shows that higher order calculations with high accuracy and/or calculations at smaller quark masses are needed in order to find deviations from resonance gas behavior and to deduce evidence for the existence of a chiral critical point in the qcd phase diagram .",
