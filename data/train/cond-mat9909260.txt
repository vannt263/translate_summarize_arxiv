    "colloidal particles interacting with strong attractions aggregate to form interesting structures .",
    "one such instance is gel formation , which occurs when the interparticle attraction is strong and of short range relative to the particle size .",
    "gelation of colloidal systems appears to be a common , if not universal , phenomenon as it has been observed experimentally in numerous quite different colloidal  like systems .",
    "notable examples of gel forming systems include colloid ",
    "polymer mixtures @xcite , in which the polymer is non  adsorbing and of low molecular weight , and suspensions of sterically stabilized particles in marginal solvents @xcite .",
    "emulsions @xcite , emulsion  polymer mixtures @xcite ,",
    "surfactant mixtures @xcite , and globular protein systems @xcite are other examples of colloidal systems that exhibit gel formation .",
    "the phase diagrams of the colloid ",
    "polymer mixtures have been examined in detail , revealing that they are of the gas  solid type without a triple point and without a liquid phase when the attraction is short ranged . the disappearance of the liquid phase is a well  documented effect @xcite , which is caused by the restricted range of the attraction .",
    "this situation is rather unique to colloidal systems in that most molecular attractions are of comparable range to the molecular dimension , precluding such phase behavior .",
    "whereas the equilibrium phase behavior of these systems is well understood , a fundamental understanding of the gel transition has been more difficult to achieve .",
    "colloidal gels are characterized by ramified structures with particles located predominantly in clusters @xcite .",
    "it is thus natural to attempt to describe this phenomenon with percolation theories .",
    "this may seem especially appropriate in that density fluctuations are very slow near the gel transition , and particle clusters behave as nearly static objects @xcite .",
    "however , rather poor agreement results when the percolation transition is compared to the experimental results for the gel transition line in the phase diagram , showing that the density dependence of the percolation transition is too strong @xcite .",
    "another suggestion has been forwarded in which the gel transition is attributed to dynamic percolation within a gas  liquid binodal which is metastable with respect to gas  solid coexistence @xcite .",
    "such metastable binodals have been observed also in solutions of globular proteins .",
    "however , gel ( or precipitate ) formation appears to occur in these systems also in regions of the phase diagram outside the metastable binodal @xcite , suggesting that the gel transition is not only triggered by an instability towards local density fluctuations .",
    "the same seems to hold for sterically stabilized suspensions as well , which exhibit a gel transition at supercritical temperatures @xcite . nevertheless , the same suspensions do form gels also under metastable conditions @xcite , as do colloid  polymer mixtures",
    "@xcite , prompting careful studies of any connection between the gel transition and metastability @xcite .",
    "we have recently suggested an explanation for the gel transition in ref .",
    "@xcite , referred to henceforth as i. in this scenario colloidal systems form gels as a result of an arrested structural relaxation due to the self  trapping mechanism called the cage effect @xcite , which is the same effect often thought to be responsible for the the liquid ",
    "glass transition .",
    "the idealized mode coupling theory ( mct ) , aimed at describing the cage effect in dense liquids , was seen to contain a bifurcation separating ergodic from nonergodic motion also for systems of particles interacting via strong short  range attractive interactions .",
    "in i we attributed the nonergodic states to gel formation ; hence , our suggestion is that the gel transition can be described within the same theoretical framework as the liquid  glass transition .",
    "many of the qualitative aspects of the gel transition were found to be reproduced by the mct calculations for the hard core attractive yukawa system ( hcay ) .",
    "the calculated phase diagrams were found to exhibit gel transition lines that connect smoothly with the hard sphere glass transition at high temperature and extend to the critical and subcritical regions at low temperature along paths that depend critically on the range of the attraction . the phase diagram obtained by verduin and dhont @xcite is qualitatively reproduced by the mct when the attraction is of intermediate range such that the gel transition meets the critical point . for shorter  range attractions the gel transition passes above the critical point , suggesting that structural arrest occurs instead of gas  liquid phase separation , which appears to agree with some measurements on sterically stablized particle systems @xcite .    a finite zero  frequency shear modulus is predicted by mct , in agreement with many measurements on colloidal gels @xcite , which is expected to be intimately connected to a finite yield stress observed in other measurements @xcite . at present the theory can not account for the density dependence of the modulus , indicating that the mesoscopic structure of the gels is important and is not captured correctly .",
    "in addition , the theory alone can not explain the growth of the small angle peak of the static structure factor nor the fractal scaling of its peak position observed on quenching of many suspensions @xcite .",
    "it does , however , provide an explanation for why the growth of the small angle peak slows down and arrests following deeper quenches . very differently from earlier approaches , which attributed the ultimate gel arrest to a global jamming or percolation transition , our microscopic theory predicts the structural arrest to be driven by anomalies of and a slowing down of the local dynamics .    the purpose of this article is to provide a more detailed account of the results of the model study in i. in particular , the nonergodicity parameters ( cf .",
    "section [ mct ] ) for several attraction ranges will be shown , motivated by the recent measurements on colloid ",
    "polymer systems by poon and co ",
    "workers @xcite .",
    "in addition , a detailed description is given of the asymptotic model developed in i. this model captures the relevant features associated with our suggested scenario for gel formation .",
    "a discussion of the relevance of these results is also included .",
    "the idealized mode coupling theory ( mct ) assumes that the dominant mechanism for structural relaxation in dense liquids is the cage effect . at short times particles",
    "are trapped in the surrounding cage of neighboring particles . at longer times",
    "particle escape from the cage leads to structural relaxation to equilibrium . for sufficiently strong interactions",
    "a bifurcation occurs in the governing equations  interpreted as the permanent entrapment of particles within their cages  causing the intermediate scattering function @xmath0 to acquire a non ",
    "zero long  time limit known as the nonergodicity parameter , glass form factor , or debye  waller factor @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the structure factor and @xmath3 is the modulus of the wavevector .",
    "the transition from a vanishing to a finite long  time limit of @xmath0 is discontinuous and defines the liquid ",
    "glass transition within mct .",
    "it is not a conventional thermodynamic phase transition , but rather an entirely dynamic transition , interpreted generally as an ergodic  nonergodic transition .",
    "this simplified scenario captures many aspects of the liquid ",
    "glass transition in molecular liquids @xcite as well as hard sphere suspensions @xcite .",
    "the governing mct equation for the time evolution of the intermediate scattering function reduces in the long  time limit to @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the number density and @xmath6 , which appears in the vertex function @xmath7 , is the fourier  transformed direct correlation function .",
    "consideration of the single particle motion leads to another set of equations for the incoherent nonergodicity parameter @xmath8 ( also known as the lamb  mssbauer factor ) @xmath9 where @xmath10 , with the self  intermediate scattering function @xmath11 .    for a given @xmath2 , equations",
    "[ coh ] and [ incoh ] are closed equations for @xmath12 and @xmath8 .",
    "they are solved numerically by iteration starting from the initial iterate @xmath13 . with this starting point",
    "the iteration converges monotonically to the correct solution for the nonergodicity parameters , given by the largest solution to the equations @xcite .",
    "the wavevector integrations are performed efficiently using simpson s rule on a uniformly discretized grid : @xmath14 , @xmath15 .",
    "the critical glass transition boundary is identified by bracketing of the given input conditions , such as temperature and density , which delineates regions where @xmath12 is zero and finite ; regions of the phase diagram which result in finite nonergodicity parameters are identified as glass states .",
    "most calculations were done with the parameters @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "the hard core attractive yukawa ( hcay ) interaction potential captures both short  range excluded volume interactions and variable  range attractive particle interactions .",
    "it is given by @xmath18 where the dimensionless parameter @xmath19 regulates the depth of the attractive well and the reduced screening parameter @xmath20 sets the range of the attraction .",
    "the equilibrium phase diagrams for a number of attraction ranges have been obtained by computer simulations @xcite , showing indeed that the liquid phase disappears upon restricting the range of the attraction . because the hcay static structure factor is known semi  analytically from the mean spherical approximation ( msa ) @xcite , it is convenient to base our study on this case .",
    "the penalty is that the resulting predictions are limited not only by the approximations made in the mct , but also those made in the msa .",
    "therefore , the results should be viewed as qualitative rather than quantitative .      in the following we describe an asymptotic model , originally developed in i , that captures the relevant features of the suggested gelation mechanism . at low densities ( @xmath21 ) the ornstein ",
    "zernike direct correlation function becomes independent of density .",
    "specifying this to the msa of the hcay fluid , we obtain @xmath22 , where @xmath23 in which we have neglected the contribution from the hard core which is independent of @xmath19 and @xmath20 at low densities . in the limit of strong attractive interactions at low densities ,",
    "the following scaling simplifies the mct equations @xmath24 in addition , @xmath25 in this limit and the mct equations ( [ coh ] and [ incoh ] ) simplify considerably such that the nonergodicity transitions occur at @xmath26 , leading to the asymptotic prediction @xmath27 .    for short  range attractive interactions , in the limit @xmath28 ,",
    "a further simplification arises because the mct vertex functions become linear functions of @xmath29 only , if we introduce the rescaled wavevectors @xmath30 .",
    "equation [ coh ] simplifies to @xmath31 with the dominant contribution to the rescaled vertex function as @xmath32 where the nonergodicity parameters depend only on the rescaled wavevectors @xmath33 .",
    "the same set of equations is found to govern the incoherent nonergodicity parameters @xmath34 .",
    "note that in this limit single particle and collective nonergodicity factors are identical and exhibit the small wavevector expansion @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is the localization length , or root ",
    "mean  square displacement , in the glass .    in this limit",
    "the coupling constant @xmath29 assumes a unique value at the transitions , which is found from solving equations [ coh - resc ] and [ vertex - resc ] numerically resulting in @xmath37 for @xmath28 .",
    "we emphasize that these asymptotic forms are valid for the hcay systems using the msa in the prescribed limits .",
    "using the msa static structure factor @xcite as input , the mct was solved for several screening parameters : @xmath20 = 7.5 , 20 , 30 , and 40 .",
    "the progression of the glass transition can be traced from the ( percus  yevick ) hard sphere limit , corresponding to k=0 , to lower temperatures in terms of the reduced temperature k@xmath38 . in i",
    "we showed the phase diagrams for @xmath20 = 7.5 , 20 , and 30 .",
    "this work adds an additional phase diagram for @xmath39 .    as shown in i , at low temperatures ( large values of @xmath19 ) the glass transition",
    "is traced along different paths in the phase diagrams depending on the value of the screening parameter , i.e. the range of the attractive interaction . in all cases",
    "they bend towards lower densities when the temperature is decreased sufficiently .",
    "the transition lines for intermediate ",
    "range attractions ( @xmath20 = 7.5 and 20 ) reach subcritical temperatures on the liquid side of the spinodal . for shorter ranges of the attraction ( @xmath40 )",
    "the nonergodicity transition line lies entirely within the fluid phase above the two phase region , and extends to subcritical temperatures at low densities on the vapor side of the spinodal .",
    "this is shown in detail in , in which the results for @xmath20 = 30 and 40 are shown . as seen , decreasing the attraction range further to @xmath39 causes the nonergodicity transition line to move away from the spinodal curve .",
    "in contrast to the msa phase diagrams studied in i , the @xmath20 = 40 transition line is located sufficiently far away from the spinodal curve to remove the additional nonergodicity transition line that appears in the msa phase diagrams with lower @xmath20 .",
    "this type of transition is discussed in the appendix of i. also shown in are the spinodal curves , defined by the condition @xmath41 for @xmath42 . in the present context",
    "they are shown as an indication of where gas  liquid phase separation is likely to occur , provided a liquid phase is present .",
    "as pointed out in i , the mct nonergodicity transition lines resemble the gel transition lines determined experimentally .",
    "most notably , the diagram with @xmath43 ( see i ) , which displays a near meeting of the nonergodicity transition and the critical point , bears a strong resemblance to the phase diagram determined by verduin and dhont @xcite in their measurements of sterically stabilized silica suspensions .",
    "other measurements on sterically stabilized suspensions found a gel transition line with no apparent evidence of phase separation , which can be expected , according to the mct , for attractions of very short range , such as @xmath40 or @xmath44 in .",
    "one important aspect of the mct nonergodicity transitions is that they are not induced by long  range structural correlations associated with critical fluctuations .",
    "this is demonstrated by the asymptotic model which is valid in the limit in equation [ asymp ] and @xmath28 for which @xmath45 .",
    "the predictions of the model are shown in as chain curves .",
    "there is quantitative agreement at low densities and the model predictions reproduce the results of the full calculation for the nonergodicity transitions qualitatively at moderately high densities .",
    "the agreement with the asymptotic model demonstrates that the @xmath42 limit of @xmath2 is decoupled from the structural arrest at low densities and temperatures .",
    "this conclusion is of particular importance as not all relevant mode couplings expected for systems near the critical point @xcite are included in this version of mct .",
    "dynamic light scattering measurements of the nonergodicity parameters led , inter alia , to the identification of the glass transition for the colloidal hard sphere system @xcite .",
    "as mct predicts very different behavior for these when strong short  range attractions are present @xcite , it can be expected that such measurements will provide a similarly decisive test of the mct of gelation .",
    "for that reason we focus here on the behavior of the nonergodicity parameters as functions of density and temperature .",
    "when the attraction is of moderately short range , such as for @xmath46 , shows that the coherent nonergodicity parameters deviate little from the hard sphere @xmath12 as the temperature is lowered , with the exception of an increasing @xmath47 value . note that the @xmath12 shown in and later figures are the critical nonergodicity parameters , which appear along the mct transition lines shown in figure 2 of i and of this work .",
    "the increase of the @xmath47 value results in this case mainly from the increased contribution of long  range correlations , which derive from the increase of the @xmath42 limit of @xmath2 upon approaching the liquid side of the spinodal curve . shown",
    "also in is the prediction from the asymptotic model based on equation [ asymp ] and @xmath28 , which does not capture the behavior of @xmath12 at the lowest temperatures .",
    "this should be expected as the attraction is not particularly short ranged .",
    "decreasing the range of the attractive interaction to @xmath43 , which causes the nonergodicity transition line to move closer to the critical point ( see figure 2 of i ) , leads now to form factors that deviate more from hard sphere behavior at low temperatures .",
    "compared to @xmath46 , this shorter range attraction causes coupling among more wavevector  modes , leading to an increase in the width of @xmath12 as the temperature is decreased .",
    "this effect is produced by the increased width of the static structure factor , caused by strong short  range correlations due to the attraction .",
    "as in the case of @xmath46 , the @xmath42 limit of @xmath12 for @xmath43 increases when the temperature is decreased .",
    "now , however , the asymptotic model yields a reasonably accurate prediction for @xmath12 at the lowest temperatures , which can be expected from the rather close agreement between the asymptotic model and the full calculation of the transition line for @xmath43 .",
    "when the range of the attraction is decreased further by changing the hcay screening parameter to @xmath40 , the path of the nonergodicity transition is unimpeded by the gas  liquid critical curve ( see ) ; it extends to subcritical temperatures on the low density , vapor side of the spinodal curve .",
    "the form factors along the transition , shown in , are qualitatively similar to those corresponding to @xmath43 , except that the width of @xmath12 is further increased due to stronger short  range correlations .",
    "the agreement with the asymptotic model is improved at the lower temperatures where the oscillations in @xmath12 are now somewhat suppressed .",
    "the improved agreement should be expected because the asymptotic model is based in part on the limit @xmath48 , which can be fulfilled by this system as the nonergodicty transition line lies entirely in the ( very likely metastable ) single phase fluid regime .",
    "the dynamics of the gel transitions can be expected to be anomalously stretched over many orders in time and to exhibit a rapid slowing down upon approaching the nonergodicity transition lines . as discussed in detail in reviews of the mct @xcite , this and",
    "a number of other qualitative aspects can be understood from the factorization property and asymptotic expansions , which describe the sensitive variation of the cage dynamics close to the transition .",
    "one finds : @xmath49 . as the so  called @xmath50correlator , @xmath51 , also exhibits numerous universal features depending on one material parameter only , the exponent parameter @xmath52 , this expression provides for crucial experimental tests of mct transition scenarios , such as those performed for hard sphere colloids @xcite .",
    "we find @xmath53 @xcite , predicting a very anomalous stretching and rapid increase of the longest relaxation time @xcite .",
    "shows the two wavevector dependent amplitudes , which describe the gel structure ( @xmath54 , also included in figures [ fq7p5] [ fq30 ] ) and localized cage dynamics ( @xmath55 ) .",
    "the amplitude factor @xmath55 , which describes the spatial extent of that dynamical process which arrests at the gel transition , is found to be peaked at rather large wavevectors stressing that the local motion of the colloids is suppressed at the gel transitions .",
    "structural arrest as described by the idealized mct is found to be a plausible explanation for colloidal gelation .",
    "the underlying cause of gelation in this scenario is a breaking of ergodicity caused by strong short  range attractions in dilute systems .",
    "an ergodic  nonergodic transition is characteristic also for the glass transition within the framework of mct .",
    "the low temperature gel transitions are accompanied by the cessation of hydrodynamic diffusion and the appearance of rather large finite elastic moduli due to the particles being tightly localized in ramified clusters ( for more details see i ) .    at relatively high temperatures , corresponding to weak attractions among the suspended particles ,",
    "the cage surrounding a typical particle is distorted by dimerization @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the cage must be reinforced by increasing the critical colloid density before structural arrest ensues , which leads to a glass transition line that moves initially towards higher density with decreasing temperature .",
    "this trend appears to require hard core repulsions and becomes more pronounced when the range of the attractive interaction decreases .",
    "it has been observed in the adhesive hard sphere system @xcite and the yukawa systems investigated in i and this study . for the colloid ",
    "polymer mixtures recrystallization of glassy samples has been reported upon introducing a small concentration of low molecular weight non  adsorbing polymer @xcite .",
    "we attribute this effect to the glass transition line possessing an initial slope in accordance with the mct predictions , i.e. in the direction of higher density with decreasing temperature .",
    "stronger short  range attractions cause particle aggregation , leading in effect to an increase of the density in the local environment of a typical particle . according to mct",
    ", aggregation can lead to structural arrest of the long  time dynamics despite the bulk density being much lower than the hard sphere glass transition density . as shown in i and",
    ", the precise path of the nonergodicity transition line in the phase diagram depends now critically on the range of the attraction , reminiscent of the dependence of the freezing line on the range of the attraction @xcite .",
    "the low density nonergodicity transitions , which appear only for sufficiently short ranges of the attraction , are not only caused by the excluded volume effect which dominates at higher densities , but are additionally affected by the low and high@xmath3 behavior of the static structure factor .",
    "the asymptotic model demonstrates , however , that the short  range ( high @xmath3 ) correlations become increasingly important as the range of attraction is decreased , such that they are the dominant cause of the structural arrest at low densities .",
    "this observation indicates that the nonergodicity transitions are unaffected by long  range correlations and the presence of the critical point .",
    "thus the fact that the mct transitions occur in close proximity to the spinodal curve for a significant range of @xmath20 is merely coincidental .",
    "the results shown in are in accord with this conclusion ; the nonergodicity transition line for @xmath39 is seen to be located further away from the critical curve than for @xmath40 .    nevertheless , several studies , particularly the extensive ones of the colloid  polymer mixtures , reveal what appears to be an intimate connection between the gel transition and the metastable gas  liquid binodal .",
    "it is possible that the gel transition changes character once it crosses the metastable binodal into the metastable and unstable regions .",
    "this is not in disagreement with our description of the arrest of the local dynamics , but indicates that the large  distance dynamics can be more complicated .",
    "unfortunately we are yet unable to make any predictions inside the unstable region with the present mct because an appropriate @xmath2 is not available and the theory assumes closeness to equilibrium @xcite .",
    "krall and weitz @xcite have studied low density gels experimentally at small wavevectors , though still larger than the wavevectors characterizing the small angle scattering peak .",
    "the low density gels are associated with finite nonergodicity parameters , supporting the mct gelation mechanism .",
    "however , krall and weitz measure relatively small values for the nonergodicity parameters , whereas the full mct solutions , as well as the asymptotic model described in section [ asymsec ] , predict large values for @xmath12 at small wavevectors .",
    "such large values are observed experimentally also , but only at somewhat higher densities .",
    "we are attempting presently to locate a low density region in the msa phase diagrams with this type of dynamics .",
    "experimental measurements of the dynamics of gels at higher densities have been conducted .",
    "sterically stabilized suspensions @xcite and colloid  polymer mixtures with low molecular weight polymer @xcite show that these gels are associated also with finite nonergodicity parameters , further supporting the present model calculations .",
    "moreover , the measured @xmath12 assume values not too much below unity both at low @xmath3 @xcite and at values near the @xmath3 corresponding to the principal peak of @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "poon and co ",
    "workers @xcite have made detailed studies of the low density and temperature region of the colloid ",
    "polymer phase diagram for low molecular weight polymers .",
    "they identified a variety of different dynamics which can be reconciled with the mct calculations provided their system belongs to the hcay diagram with @xmath56 .",
    "for such a situation the gel transition meets the spinodal on the liquid side , without interfering with the critical behavior along the vapor side . conjecturing that the gel transition can exist in the unstable region as found experimentally by verduin and dhont @xcite",
    ", we obtain a phase diagram qualitatively similar to that determined by poon et al .",
    "we expect that quenching of a suspension at low to moderately low density results initially in normal phase separation dynamics , characterized by either spinodal decomposition or nucleation and growth .",
    "this process proceeds until the denser domains reach the critical density for gelation , subsequently arresting the structure , which would be consistent also with the measurements in ref .",
    "thus we anticipate that the so  called transient gelation region , discovered by poon et al .",
    "@xcite for colloid  polymer systems with short polymers , corresponds to a nonergodicity transition in the unstable region of the phase diagram .",
    "the asymptotic model of section [ asymsec ] provides additional support for this interpretation .",
    "first , arrest of long  range structures is caused by an arrest of the local dynamics .",
    "in contrast to percolation approaches for the gel arrest , the local density fluctuations also exhibit slowing down and dynamical anomalies .",
    "second , the tight localization of the particles provides a rationale for using concepts like bond  formation and sticking probabilities , even though the particles obey diffusive equations of motion .",
    "third , the approach to unity of the collective nonergodicity or debye  waller factors for small wavevectors , @xmath57 for @xmath42 , indicates that the particles are bound to infinite clusters in this limit .",
    "momentum conservation , or newton s law of action  and  reaction , otherwise would require @xmath58 , as found for glasses .    in summary , gelation in colloidal systems",
    "is attributed to a breaking of ergodicity , captured qualitatively by the mct applied to the hcay system .",
    "the calculated phase diagrams show many similarities with those determined experimentally for colloid ",
    "polymer mixtures and sterically stabilized suspensions . decreasing the range of the attractive interaction sufficiently causes the gel transition to move further into the single phase region .",
    "the gross features of the mct nonergodicity parameters at low temperatures are seen to be in accord with the few existing measurements , supporting the proposed gelation mechanism .",

    "<S> the idealized mode coupling theory ( mct ) is applied to colloidal systems interacting via short  range attractive interactions of yukawa form . at low temperatures </S>",
    "<S> mct predicts a slowing down of the local dynamics and ergodicity breaking transitions . </S>",
    "<S> the nonergodicity transitions share many features with the colloidal gel transition , and are proposed to be the source of gelation in colloidal systems . </S>",
    "<S> previous calculations of the phase diagram are complemented with additional data for shorter ranges of the attractive interaction , showing that the path of the nonergodicity transition line is then unimpeded by the gas  liquid critical curve at low temperatures . </S>",
    "<S> particular attention is given to the critical nonergodicity parameters , motivated by recent experimental measurements . </S>",
    "<S> an asymptotic model is developed , valid for dilute systems of spheres interacting via strong short  range attractions , and is shown to capture all aspects of the low temperature mct nonergodicity transitions . </S>"
