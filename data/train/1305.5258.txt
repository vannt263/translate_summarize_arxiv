    "the mid - ir spectra of many galactic and extragalactic sources display the well - known unidentified infrared ( uir ) bands at 3.3 , 6.2 , 7.7 , 8.6 , 11.2 , and 12.7  ( c.f .",
    "@xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "these broad emission features are generally attributed to the ir - relaxation of uv - pumped polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon ( pah ) molecules (;",
    "@xcite , ) .",
    "observationally , the relative strengths , peak position , and profile of the pah features have been seen to vary considerably within a source and from source to source ( e.g. @xcite ; ; @xcite ) .",
    "the relative strengths of pah features also change drastically going from neutral molecules to ions in laboratory studies ( c.f .",
    "@xcite ) . in particular ,",
    "the 3.3 and 11.2  features arise primarily from neutral pah molecules while the 6.2 , 7.7 , and 8.6  features are attributed to pah ions .",
    "this allows ratios involving the neutrals and ions , such as the 7.7/11.2 ratio , to be useful tools for probing the ionization state of the emitting molecules and hence for probing the local physical conditions ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "in addition , smaller molecules dominate the emission at shorter wavelengths while larger molecules emit predominantly at longer wavelengths @xcite .    despite the success of pah ratios as tracers of physical conditions within a source , dust extinction often hampers measuring and interpreting these ratios . while there is extinction across the whole ir range ,",
    "the main issue for pahs is silicate extinction in the mid - ir which primarily affects the 8.6 and 11.2  pah bands .",
    "moreover , this extinction can vary spatially across a source , complicating the interpretation of the observed mid - ir pah features . @xcite investigated variations in the pah ratios in a variety of objects including m82 , and concluded that pah variations are being caused by the properties of the emitting pah population within the objects in their study .",
    "however , @xcite attribute the pah band variations in this source to extinction variations .",
    "indeed they posited that the variations in dust extinction are strong enough to affect the interpretation of their calculated pah ratios , which showed variations comparable to the variations in extinction .",
    "this presents a fundamental problem in interpreting pah ratios : are the variations in the band ratios intrinsic to the source ? are they the direct result of variations in the extinction due to dust ? or are they some combination of the two ?",
    "unfortunately , the only source in which this effect has been studied , m82 , is a very complex and distant source , so each spitzer / irs pixel contains unresolved structure which adds to the already considerable uncertainties on the extinction and pah measurements . on the other hand , many galactic h  ii regions can be spatially resolved at many wavelengths and the general principles of their structures are well understood ( e.g. ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter 7 ) ) .",
    "these properties greatly increase the precision of which the spatial variations of extinction can be studied within the target as well as giving access to multiple other methods of extinction measurement . as a result ,",
    "studying the effects of extinction on pah variations in a galactic h  ii region instead of m82 should result in a prime testbed to address this question .",
    "understanding the characteristics of dust in regions of massive star formation is of key importance as dust extinction and reemission dominates the spectral energy distribution of these regions .",
    "studies on the properties of dust in h  ii regions around massive young stars have a long history dating back to the optical studies on light scattering by @xcite , infrared studies by @xcite , and sub millimeter @xcite .",
    "the advent of moderate resolution infrared spectrometers with wide coverage on ground - based and space based platforms has opened up novel ways of probing the dust characteristics in h  ii regions through comparisons of the strength of ir recombination lines and studies of this type have revealed distinct differences with dust properties in the diffuse ism ( e.g. ) .",
    "the absorption characteristics of dust in h  ii regions can also be gleaned from detailed studies of the ( infrared ) spectral energy distribution ( @xcite ; @xcite ; ) .",
    "the high sensitivity of the irs spectrometer on the spitzer space telescope has opened up the study of the characteristics of dust in molecular clouds through photometric and spectroscopic studies of background stars shining through the cloud ( @xcite ; @xcite ; ; @xcite ) .",
    "these observations reveal that the dust properties vary widely within molecular clouds and regions of star formation .",
    "these variations likely reflect the importance of coagulation of interstellar dust in larger and larger aggregates as the density increases (; ) .",
    "there are several well known ways to measure the extinction in an h  ii region of which three will be employed in this paper .",
    "the first two require observations of the ionized hydrogen emission from the center of the h  ii region . we will employ the recombination lines in the nir and this shall be referred to as the nir method .",
    "the second method , the radio method , involves comparing the strength of the nir hydrogen lines with the radio continuum generated by the same ionized hydrogen .",
    "the third method is independent of the first two , and fits the 9.8  silicate profile to the observed spectra , deriving the depth of the 9.8  silicate absorption feature ; this will be referred to as the ` spoon ' method @xcite .",
    "in addition , the code pahfit does a similar analysis to the spoon method in fitting the mir spectrum and provides the optical depth of the 9.8  silicate absorption feature .",
    "we have therefore obtained narrow band photometric observations of the paschen @xmath0 ( hereafter pa@xmath0 ) and brackett @xmath1 ( hereafter br@xmath1 ) hydrogen lines of the galactic h  ii region ( iras 12063 - 6259 , he 2 - 77 ) .",
    "we will combine these data with mid - ir spitzer / irs spectral maps and radio to create multiple extinction maps to ensure consistency .",
    "subsequently , we can use these extinction maps to correct our spitzer / irs observations in order to investigate the effects of extinction on the pah band ratios .",

    ", width=302 ]    iras 12063 - 6259 , an ultra compact h  ii region at a distance of 10 kpc @xcite , was first classified as a possible planetary nebula ( pn ) by @xcite .",
    "the first suggestions that it was perhaps not a pn were prompted by inspection of the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) in which the 10  photometry was consistent with silicate absorption  suggesting that it was an h  ii region @xcite .",
    "this mis - classification is , in some ways , fortunate though , as its inclusion in pne catalogs has provided abundances based on optical spectroscopy ( e.g. @xcite ) . it was also observed in the radio in pne surveys , revealing a very bright object at 5 ghz .",
    "further radio observations by @xcite using the ata array at 4.8 and 8.6 ghz indicate separation into three distinct sources , a and b with the b source further divided into b1 and b2 ( a : 12:09:01.12 -63:15:52.9 ; b : 12:09:01.01 -63:16:00.8 ) .",
    "it is thought that this separation reflects the likely stellar content - i.e. a cluster of three stars rather than a single ionizing star .",
    "we show an optical / nir image of iras 12063 - 6259 in figure  [ fig1 ] with radio contours .",
    "the dark lane in the center of figure  [ fig1 ] indicates a high degree of extinction .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig1 ] , the radio a source is coincident with a dark lane across the nebula while the radio b source occurs at the same location as the brightest patch of nebulosity in h@xmath2 , pa@xmath0 and br@xmath1 .",
    "the optical / nir image shows this band most clearly , particularly the h@xmath2 image .",
    "this feature is evident in the extinction maps , particularly in the nir case b recombination map and partially in the mid - ir silicate feature maps .",
    "it is clear that the dark band is caused by extinction , rather than a lack of flux in the shorter wavelength filters , because the band obscures the continuum radio emission from the radio a h  ii region .",
    "the extinction band is also present in 2mass jhks images , which closely match the morphology of the h@xmath2 image presented in figure  [ fig1 ] . in the long wavelength ( 8.6 )",
    "spitzer / irac images the dark lane present in optical / near infrared data is absent and we see bright ir sources at the positions of both radio a and b. however , the radio a source is substantially fainter at 3.6  than the radio b source(s ) .",

    "pa@xmath0 and br@xmath1 narrow band filters at 1.27 and 2.17  were employed to observe the emission line intensities across the nebula .",
    "observations were also performed using adjacent narrow band filters ( 1.21 , 2.19 ) in order to measure the continuum component of the nebular emission .",
    "a standard star at similar airmass ( hd 115115 ) was observed in the same narrow - band filters subsequent to the observation of the hii region .",
    "these isaac observations were performed in nodding / jittering configuration , allowing optimal removal of the sky background for both the nebular and standard star images by the eso reduction pipeline .",
    "each science frame was dark subtracted and flat - fielded using calibration data obtained that evening .",
    "the isaac data reduction pipeline was found to produce images with slightly offset wcs ( world coordinate system ) information to the order of 510  in each reduction .",
    "the images were subsequently aligned by selecting stars with known wcs coordinates from the 2mass point source catalog and adjusting the wcs information of each frame to match these coordinates .",
    "the standard star , hd 115115 , has spectral type f2v with 2mass j and ks band magnitudes of 8.717 and 8.473 respectively . the ratio of flux to be expected in a narrow band filter to that of a broad band filter was found by integrating the convolution of a normalized f2v spectral energy distribution ( sed ) with the relevant filter profile over the wavelength range of each filter and then dividing these to provide the expected flux ratio .",
    "for example :",
    "@xmath11    where @xmath12 is the ratio of fluxes expected between the two filters , @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the upper and lower limits of the 1.21  narrow band filter , @xmath15 is the flux of the star as a function of wavelength and @xmath16 is the filter profile as a function of wavelength .    using this relationship , the standard star flux",
    "can then be related to the observed counts to obtain the flux per count necessary for calibration of our science images . in each case , the standard star was observed at roughly the same airmass as the science target and immediately following the science observation .",
    "the airmass corrections were integrated into the process of determining the flux per count .",
    "the choice of standard star was constrained heavily by airmass and position on the sky constraints , as such we have checked our calibration by repeating this process for each star in both standard and object fields for which we have both photometry and 2mass magnitudes .",
    "this assumed that most stars in both fields are likely to be late - type and therefore differences in their seds are likely to be minor and will not influence the calibration . in this process , we carefully excluded outliers , which were either a ) embedded within the source , b ) either optical doubles or visual binaries for which the isaac pipeline had incorrectly measured the counts , or c ) early type stars .",
    "it was also necessary to remove stars with high 2mass magnitudes ( @xmath17 11 ) , as our observations are much more sensitive than those of 2mass and this introduces non - linearities at very low count levels",
    ". fits to this data provide the flux per count and allow us to calibrate our images .",
    "the fits for each filter are consistent with those derived using just the standard star .",
    "table  [ log_tot3 ] also lists the seeing for each image as derived from the psfs of the stars in the field by the eso isaac pipeline .",
    "unfortunately , one of the set of four images of iras 12063 - 6259 ( 1.28 ) has approximately double the seeing ( 1.5 ) of the other images ( 0.70.9 ) . in order to compensate , we smoothed the three other images to match the seeing of the worst image ( br@xmath1 ) .",
    "the four images of the source were then calibrated , and images of br@xmath1 and pa@xmath0 created by subtracting the adjacent background images ( 1.21 and 2.19  respectively ) .    following the calibration process ,",
    "the field stars in the images were masked to prevent them from influencing later science results .",
    "the s / n of the resulting br@xmath1 and pa@xmath0 maps varies across ir 12063 . both achieve a s / n of greater than 10 per pixel in the area around radio b , but the area around radio a is more variable , with the s / n of pa@xmath0 and br@xmath1 dropping to around 0.5 and 5 per pixel respectively .",
    "iras 12063 - 6259 was observed with the short - low ( sl ) module of the infrared spectrometer ( irs ; @xcite ) on - board the spitzer space telescope ( pid : 20517 , aor : 14798848 ) .",
    "we have summarized these observations in table  [ log_tot2 ] . both the first ( sl1 , 7.4 - 14.5 , 1.8/pixel ) and the second ( sl2 , 5.2 - 7.7 , 1.8/pixel ) orders were used to create a spectral map , with spectral resolutions @xmath18 between 64 and 128 .",

    "finally , the sl2 spectra were scaled to match the sl1 spectra in order to correct for the mismatches between the two order segments .",

    "these scaling factors were typically 5% , well in agreement with the typical values of 10% obtained by @xcite .",

    "the somewhat conflicting extinction maps suggest a geometry for iras 12063 - 6259 : radio a is actually a deeply embedded , highly extinguished h  ii region separated from the h  ii region around radio b. the pah bands are seen to sharply peak at the same position as radio a , which strongly argues for most of the emitting pahs being located in the pdr around the radio a h  ii region and not associated with the extended pah emission evident in the figure  [ fig12 ] . in this case , the radio a pah emission should suffer from a similar level of extinction as the ionized part of the h  ii region , yet the mir spectra reveal only modest silicate absorption .",
    "the fact that the spoon method finds a much lower extinction ( at least a factor of two ) than the lower limit given by the radio method is possibly another instance of the expected relationship between the nir extinction and the silicate absorption breaking down .",
    "the radio b source , on the other hand , suffers from a similar problem which we must tentatively attribute to silicate coagulation .",
    "the non zero nir extinction and near zero silicate optical depth are difficult to explain using other mechanisms especially as the nir extinction around radio b is consistent with standard extinction laws .",
    "radio b appears to have cast off its extinguishing material ( possibly due to it being a small cluster of stars as suggested by @xcite ) .",
    "it is also possible that radio b is simply older and has cast off its natal cloud . given the lack of extinguishing material on our line of sight , it seems that the stars making up radio b are the likely cause of the extended pah emission surrounding iras 12063 - 6259 .",
    "here we discuss the possible ramifications of our findings regarding the various methods of measuring extinction .",
    "it is important to note that each method , in isolation , presents a seemingly reliable measurement of extinction .",
    "it is only when compared to other independent measures of extinction that inconsistencies emerge .",
    "the spoon method is commonly used to classify external galaxies ( e.g. @xcite ) . in this role it provides a self - consistent way of determining the degree of silicate absorption ,",
    "albeit not a very accurate in terms of the total extinction as it seems to systematically underestimate the degree of silicate optical depth ( as shown in section  [ sec : sil_abs ] where we developed a method of compensating for this effect ) .",
    "in addition , it does not seem to be linked to the overall extinction , as measured by the radio method , as has also been concluded from completely independent methods to measure the extinction associated with molecular cloud materials ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; ) .",
    "spatial extinction maps also show that different regions of a small object can have vastly different extinction properties .",
    "if we regard the iso - sws spectra of iras 12063 - 6259 as an average of the whole object , it shows some silicate absorption as well as nir extinction .",
    "the spitzer / irs observations disentangle these two effects and show that they are spatially distinct on scales of the 0.4 pc separation between the two radio sources . in the case of iras 12063 - 6259",
    ", this small separation is resolved , for the usual application of the spoon method ( galaxy classification ) variations on this scale will be entirely invisible .      the primary argument made by @xcite was that because the variations in pah band ratios were lower than the variations one would expect due to variations in the extinction ; one could not reliably ascribe these variations to any other cause .",
    "@xcite made this assertion based on the scatter in their plot of i@xmath77/i@xmath79 against i@xmath78/i@xmath79 ( which we show with our data in figure  [ fig13 ] ) , which was rather close to the expected dereddening vector .",
    "for iras 12063 - 6259 , it is observed that the range of points on this figure is maintained or even amplified upon dereddening ( regardless of the extinction map chosen ) .",
    "this implies that the variations in the pah band ratios are not due to variable extinction but are intrinsic .",
    "we find that correlations involving the 8.6  band are highly affected by extinction , as one might expect .",
    "however the combination of the band being weak and the second most heavily affected by extinction produce very scattered correlation plots ( e.g. figures  [ fig16 ] and [ fig17 ] ) with low correlation coefficients .",
    "this probably also arises from the uncertainty on the wavelength profile of the 9.8  silicate absorption feature which has been found to vary significantly .",
    "the different extinction maps used to deredden the irs cube have the largest effect on the 8.6/11.2 pah ratio .",
    "the data dereddened using the spoon map shows much lower dispersion than that dereddened using the nir map .",
    "there are three potential explanations for this effect , it could be a reflection of the nir extinction map being noisier than the spoon map , although if this were the case it would be expected that the nir points on the correlation plots would have a higher scatter without preferring any specific direction , which is not observed .",
    "secondly , it could be that the method of using an extinction law to measure extinction and then dereddening using the same extinction law introduces biases which cause the spoon dereddened points to cluster .",
    "lastly , it could be that the spoon method systematically fails at low @xmath34 , in this case the points at low extinction do not move at all ( as for low nir @xmath34 the spoon method seems to find @xmath34 = 0 ) while the high extinction points move towards them - decreasing the scatter",
    ". however , the agreement between the spoon method and pahfit on the lack of absorption in radio b spectra seems to rule out the final possibility being a systematic error and suggest that instead , the 8.6/11.2 pah ratio displays a lower variation than expected .    in general the pah intensity correlations found for iras 12063 - 6259 are consistent with those of previous studies of h  ii regions and also the reflection nebula ngc 2023 .",
    "the range of values over which each pah ratio was found to vary seems to be compressed for iras 12063 - 6259 as compared to other objects , with the exception of the 7.7 and 6.2 bands with respect to the 11.2 .",
    "the 12.7  pah feature in particular displays very little variation as compared to other studies . from figure  [ fig17a ]",
    "it is clear that the variation in 12.7 relative to 11.2 is consistent with 12.7/11.2 being constant at a value of 0.2 ( after dereddening the effect persists but the value is around 0.11 or 0.14 for cube dereddened using the nir or spoon extinction maps respectively ) .",
    "in contrast , the reflection nebula ngc 2023 shows a range of 0.2  0.6 for 12.7/11.2 ( peeters et al .",
    "2013 ; in prep . ) . in this sense",
    "the pah population of iras 12063 - 6259 may not be the best test for the effect of extinction on pahs as there is very little variation in some of the pah intensity ratios .",
    "however there have been very few studies of the spatial distribution of pahs and their properties around h  ii regions .",
    "the spatial variations in extinction across iras 12063 - 6259 have been mapped using multiple methods .",
    "we then used these maps to deredden mir observations and hence investigated the effects of the spatial extinction variations on pah intensity variations .",
    "we obtained nir , mir and radio observations of the h  ii region iras 12063 - 6259 .",
    "the nir observations were performed using the isaac instrument on the vlt and provided maps of the narrow band hydrogen recombination line emission .",
    "the mir data were acquired using the spitzer / irs instrument in mapping mode and the radio observations were obtained using the atca array .",
    "these data allowed the derivation of several independent extinction maps .",
    "the nir observations were used to make the first extinction map by comparing the ratio of the strengths of two hydrogen recombination lines to their intrinsic ratio as given by case b recombination theory .",
    "the second measure of extinction was calculated by using the continuum radio observations to find the intrinsic strength of the stronger of the two hydrogen lines measured in the nir and then comparing the two .",
    "the final method , measuring the depth of the mir silicate absorption feature , was measured in two ways , firstly using the spoon method and subsequently using pahfit .",
    "we showed that the spoon method systematically underestimates the magnitude of the silicate absorption at 9.8  in the absence of observations at wavelengths longer than 14.5 .",
    "this effect originates from the secondary , shallower , silicate absorption feature which reduces the flux of the 14.5  spline point used to derive the continuum by the spoon method .",
    "we correct for this problem by implementing an iterative spoon method which compensates for the lowered 14.5  flux by dereddening the spectrum and then reapplying the spoon method .",
    "the original spoon method appears to underestimate the 9.8  optical depth by around 40% in high extinction regions without using this iterative technique .",
    "the extinction measurements which use the ionized hydrogen observations ( nir , radio ) tend to agree , while measurements based on the 9.8  silicate absorption feature are in disagreement .",
    "different methods of measuring the mir silicate absorption yielded different results , with the spoon method finding much lower absorption than pahfit ( although the pahfit measurements were performed using only short wavelength irs data ) . comparing the silicate absorption to the nir extinction showed that the dust composition varies on different sightlines to iras 12063 - 6259 , being more like a molecular cloud on the radio b sightline and consistent with general ism trends away from the two radio sources . prompted by this discrepancy",
    ", iso - sws h  ii region spectra @xcite were measured in the same way and this effect was also found for the h  ii region iras 10589 - 6034 , while other h  ii regions were consistent with the ism relationship between silicate absorption and nir extinction .",
    "in addition , the radio extinction method showed a much higher than expected extinction compared to the silicate absorption for the radio a source . the silicate absorption observed in the mir",
    "does peak around radio a , but only appears to account for half of the total extinction .",
    "we conclude that the spatial variations in extinction appear to include not only the magnitude of the extinction but also the dust composition along each sightline .",
    "the two radio sources in iras 12063 - 6259 reported by @xcite possess remarkably different properties which have proven difficult to satisfactorily explain .",
    "radio a , seems to be a heavily extinguished object with an a@xmath62 greater than 4 , yet it is ostensibly encompassed in a larger surrounding h  ii region .",
    "there is a ` bar ' of extinction which appears to be related to iras 12063 - 6259 as there is diffuse emission associated with iras 12063 - 6259 emanating from this region .",
    "radio b , which @xcite suggest could be multiple stars , is coincident with the brightest part of the h  ii region and seems to have a much lower total extinction of around a@xmath62 @xmath27 1.5 ( of which very little is generated by silicates ) .",
    "the spitzer / irs spectral cube of iras 12063 - 6259 was dereddened using the extinction maps and the spectral features measured for each pixel in both the dereddened cubes as well as in the originally observed cubes .",
    "the standard correlation plots were then presented for both the observed and dereddened data .",
    "correcting for extinction changes the pah correlations , in most cases altering the gradients , moreover the range of each particular pah ratio can also change substantially .",
    "any correlation involving the 8.6  band tends to be degraded by both noise and the relative uncertainty in the shape of the blue wing of the 9.8  silicate absorption feature . in iras 12063 - 6259 , correcting for extinction using the spoon method removes variation in the 12.7 / 11.2 pah band ratio . in general though , the dereddening process does not seem to totally remove variations in the pah ratios as was suggested by @xcite .",
