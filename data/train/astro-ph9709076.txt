    "cosmic gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) are among the brightest , most plentiful astrophysical phenomena in the observable gamma - ray sky , yet they present unique observational challenges .",
    "the greatest challenge is in measuring burst locations accurately . because of this difficulty ,",
    "much of our current understanding has come from large - scale statistical measures , where the accuracy of individual burst locations is not as important as the total number of bursts .",
    "the burst and transient source experiment ( batse ) has now measured the locations ( accurate to @xmath25@xmath0 , on average ) and intensities of more than 1700 grbs  yielding evidence that the sources are highly isotropic on the sky , yet radially inhomogeneous ( e.g. , meegan et al .",
    "1992 ; briggs et al .  1996",
    "; pendleton et al .  1996 ) .",
    "these results rule - out the once - favored galactic neutron star paradigm ( e.g. , hurley 1986 ; higdon & lingenfelter 1990 ) , but still allow three vastly different distance regimes : heliocentric ( distance @xmath4  au ) , extended galactic halo ( @xmath5  kpc ) and cosmological ( @xmath6  gpc ) .",
    "the grb mystery is thus far from being solved , as the range of possible distances spans over 12 orders of magnitude and the source objects remain elusive . in this paper",
    "we use the comptel instrument aboard the _ compton gamma ray observatory _ ( cgro ) to measure grb locations with improved accuracy .",
    "a smaller sample of more - accurate burst locations can not improve upon large - scale measures , but improved location accuracy is a fundamental requirement for important studies of small - scale angular clustering , correlations with known objects and searches for counterpart objects at other wavelengths .",
    "in addition , the large - scale distribution of unique sub - populations could provide important insights .",
    "recent investigation of small - scale angular clustering of grb sources has been hampered by the relative inaccuracy of locations measured with batse .",
    "several statistical studies have yielded conflicting results indicating the presence ( quashnock & lamb 1993 ; wang & lingenfelter 1993 ) and absence ( meegan et al .",
    "1995 ; brainerd et al.1995 ; tegmark et al .",
    "1996 ) of small - angle correlations among batse burst locations .",
    "the presence of small - scale angular correlations would be important as it could indicate repeating grb sources , or unresolved clusters  both of which are difficult to explain in most scenarios involving catastrophic destruction or mergers ( e.g. , mszros & rees 1992 ; narayan , paczyski & piran 1992 ; white 1993 ; katz 1993 ; bickert & greiner 1993 ) .",
    "earlier studies found no evidence to indicate burst repetition on time scales shorter than @xmath210 yr , but a majority of the locations used in these studies were also relatively inaccurate ( schaefer & cline 1985 ; atteia et al .",
    "1987 ) .",
    "the investigation of cross - correlations between grbs and catalogs of known objects has also been limited by imprecise locations .",
    "most studies have failed to reveal any significant association with any galactic or extragalactic source catalog ( howard et al .",
    "1994 ; nemiroff , marani & cebral 1994 , harrison , webber & mcnamara 1995 ) .",
    "recently , however , batse 3b burst locations have been reported to be weakly correlated ( @xmath223@xmath1 significance ) with galaxy clusters ( kolatt & piran 1996 ; marani et al .",
    "1997 ; but see hurley et al .",
    "1997 ) and radio - quiet quasars ( schartel , andernach & greiner 1997 ) .",
    "such correlations might be expected at some level if grbs lie at cosmological distances characteristic of the galaxy samples , where the brighter , closer bursts are expected to show the strongest signal . however , no significant correlations with either galaxy clusters or quasars were found in an earlier analysis of accurate locations of bright grbs , where one might expect a stronger signal ( webber et al.1995 ) .",
    "the most crucial need for accurate burst locations is in the identification of counterpart objects at other wavelengths  a potential key to solving the grb mystery .",
    "unfortunately , quiescent counterpart emission at any wavelength appears to be very weak , or non - existent ( see vrba 1996 ) .",
    "the last remaining hope in this field is to detect transient counterpart emission soon after the onset in gamma rays  a particularly difficult challenge as it requires quick and accurate grb locations .",
    "most simultaneous and near - simultaneous measurements that have been obtained are relatively insensitive , but indicate that if low - energy ( i.e. , non gamma - ray ) counterpart emission exists at all , it must be weak and/or short - lived ( @xmath7 day ) . accurate and timely grb localization is thus crucial for future counterpart search efforts ( see mcnamara , harrison & williams 1995 ) .",
    "the recent discovery of weak x - ray / optical emission from the directions of grb 970228 and grb 970508 offers the most convincing evidence obtained thus far that grbs do produce transient emission at other wavelengths ( costa et al .  1997a , 1997b ; van paradijs et al.1997 ; bond 1997 ) .",
    "if these bursts are typical , then other counterparts will be detected only through the use of sensitive instruments combined with rapidly determined , accurate grb locations .",
    "the comptel instrument has the unique capability of directly imaging mev photon sources over a wide ( @xmath21 sr , fwhm ) field - of - view ( fov ) .",
    "it is thus able to measure the locations and energy spectra of several grbs per year .",
    "full - sky exposure to bursts is achieved through long observations , over several years , wherein the cgro satellite is regularly re - pointed . in this paper",
    "we use the mev imaging capability and effective full - sky coverage of comptel to accumulate a comprehensive catalog of grb locations observed during the first four years of the cgro mission .",
    "the catalog constitutes a unique sample of relatively accurate locations that is used to investigate the grb spatial distribution  providing insight into the distance / source object mystery .",
    "the energy spectra and temporal properties of these events have been discussed elsewhere ( kippen et al .  1996a , 1997 and references therein ) , as have preliminary locations of some of the bursts ( see table  1 ) .",
    "comptel is a wide - field , double - scatter compton telescope capable of imaging gamma - ray sources in the energy range 0.7530 mev .",
    "it consists of two planar layers of scintillation detector modules separated by @xmath21.5 m. the upper ( d1 ) layer incorporates seven low z , low density liquid ( ne213a ) detectors ( total area 4188  cm@xmath3 ) , while the lower ( d2 ) layer is composed of 14 high z , high density nai(tl ) modules ( total area 8620  cm@xmath3 ) .",
    "a _ telescope event _ is defined as a coincident set of interactions in a single pair of d1 , d2 modules in anti - coincidence with a signal from any of four plastic charged particle veto domes . for each telescope event",
    ", the energy deposits and interaction locations within each detector are measured using the signals from photomultiplier tubes affixed to the detector modules . the interaction sequence from d1 to d2",
    "is identified by a time - of - flight ( tof ) coincidence measurement and the absolute time of each event is tagged with an accuracy of 125  @xmath9s .",
    "rejection of a large fraction of neutron - induced background events is realized through the measurement and discrimination of pulse - shape ( psd ) in d1 .",
    "the comptel design favors the ideal interaction wherein an incident photon undergoes a single compton scatter in d1 , followed by complete absorption of the scattered photon in d2 . for such ideal telescope events , the measurement of energy deposits in d1 and d2 yields the scattered electron energy and scattered photon energy , respectively , while the measurement of interaction locations within the detectors reveals the direction of the scattered photon .",
    "combined , the energy and location information constrains the incident photon direction to an annular ring or _ event circle _ on the sky .",
    "the angular radius @xmath10 of an event circle is determined by the kinematics of compton scattering :    @xmath11    where @xmath12 is the electron rest energy and @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the energy deposit measurements in d1 and d2 , respectively .",
    "ambiguity in the arrival direction of individual photons is removed through the statistical superposition of many events with different scatter angles , thereby forming a unique source signature .",
    "complicating matters are non - ideal source events , such as those arising from multiple compton scatters or pair production in d1 or incomplete energy absorption in the detectors , for which equation ( [ eqcompton ] ) is invalid .",
    "non - ideal events result in a complicated source signature that must be accounted for in the imaging analysis .",
    "selection criteria applied to event parameters ( i.e. , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath10 , tof and psd ) during analysis can significantly alter the effective energy range , sensitivity and fov of the instrument . a complete description of comptel and its operation and performance was presented by schnfelder et al .  ( 1993 ) .",
    "comptel employs two independent operating modes for observing transient phenomena such as gamma - ray bursts . in parallel with the main _ telescope mode _ , a secondary _ burst mode _ uses two of the d2 modules to accumulate time - resolved spectra in the energy range 0.110 mev ( see hanlon et al .",
    "1994 and references therein ) . in this paper",
    "we are concerned only with the source localization capabilities of the telescope mode observations .    in detecting and localizing gamma - ray bursts , comptel is in most cases a photon - limited device , whose sensitivity is governed by low detection efficiency rather than background .",
    "sensitivity in this case depends on burst fluence , with the minimum detectable fluence given by    @xmath15    where @xmath16 is the spectrum - dependent mean photon energy ( 0.7530 mev ) , @xmath17 is the effective detection area for ideal events and @xmath18 is the number of ideal source events that are required to construct a meaningful image ( winkler et al.1986 ) . requiring 20 ideal events from a normally incident @xmath19 power law burst source ( @xmath17 = 31 cm@xmath3 ; @xmath16 = 2.8 mev ) yields @xmath20 erg  @xmath21 . burst sensitivity decreases as the zenith angle @xmath22 between the telescope pointing axis and the source direction increases .",
    "this relation effectively limits the fov for bursts to @xmath23 .",
    "it is illustrated in figure  1a for several different power law energy spectra .",
    "the strong dependence of burst sensitivity on fluence ( rather than , e.g. , peak flux ) results in a significant bias against the detection of short duration bursts , since short bursts typically do not result in enough events for meaningful imaging ( even though the instantaneous flux may be large ) .",
    "the average rate of background events that could be confused with ideal source events ranges from @xmath20.2 hz at @xmath24 to @xmath20.6 hz at @xmath25 , with orbital variations as large as a factor of three .",
    "background is thus significant only in the detection of longer duration , low fluence bursts .",
    "the statistical detection significance for such bursts is    @xmath26    where @xmath27 is the number of source counts ( related to the burst fluence through eq .",
    "[ [ eqsmin ] ] ) and @xmath28 is the number of background counts ( roughly proportional to burst duration ) . when the number of source counts required for a significant detection above background ( @xmath27 ) exceeds the number of counts required for imaging ( @xmath29 ) , detection is background - limited . in this case , the sensitivity estimates of figure  1a are too low .",
    "correction factors ( roughly independent of spectral shape ) for @xmath30 are plotted as a function of burst duration in figure  1b .",
    "the detection of bursts shorter than @xmath225 s is effectively always photon - limited regardless of zenith angle . for longer bursts , background becomes increasingly important .",
    "fortunately , most long duration bursts contain short , intense episodes whose detection is less dependent on background .",
    "for very intense bursts , or burst intervals , where fluence @xmath31 erg  @xmath21 , electronics and telemetry deadtime limit the ability of comptel to register and record events .",
    "this affects the detection of short , intense bursts , where significant numbers of events fail to be registered and/or recorded .",
    "deadtime thus produces an additional bias against the detection of short duration bursts .",
    "the imaging analysis of comptel data is performed in a three - dimensional _ dataspace _ defined by the quantities ( @xmath32 ) . the coordinates ( @xmath33,@xmath34 )",
    "define the direction of the vector between the d1 , d2 interaction locations and the scatter angle @xmath10 is computed from the energy deposit measurements using equation ( [ eqcompton ] ) . in this representation , the point source signature , or _",
    "point spread function _ ( psf ) , is a partially filled cone with 45@xmath0 opening angle whose vertex is centered on the source position ( figure  2 ) .",
    "the complicated diagonal shape of the cone mantle is determined by the inherent measurement errors and the physics of non - ideal interactions , that are all functions of source position and energy spectrum .",
    "dependence of the psf shape on source position is weakened by factoring - out a geometry term @xmath35 ( see schnfelder et al.1993 ) .",
    "this allows ( to some degree of approximation ) the use of a single psf for imaging sources located anywhere in the fov .",
    "the psf used for all burst source analysis in this paper has been derived from monte carlo simulation ( see stacy et al .",
    "1996 ) of the comptel response to a point source of gamma rays at @xmath36 , with an assumed @xmath37 power law energy spectrum .",
    "various standard selections are imposed on the event data in order to reduce systematic effects due to incomplete knowledge of the psf and to improve the signal - to - noise ratio in the data ( see schnfelder et al .",
    "these selections are applied equally to the psf simulations and the data .",
    "the imaging process amounts to searching for the psf signature in the binned ( @xmath38 ) distribution of telescope events ( a mixture of source and background ) .",
    "the bin - size is chosen to be on the order of the instrumental resolution ( 1@xmath0 , 1@xmath0 and 2@xmath0 in @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath10 , respectively ) , resulting in few events per bin . a maximum likelihood search technique capable of handling the sparsely populated dataspace is employed to obtain quantitative constraints on the source parameters .",
    "the maximum likelihood method , described fully by de boer et al.(1992 ) , attempts to fit a point source ( psf ) plus a model of the background signature to the 3-d dataspace distribution of events assuming poisson counting statistics . for a trial source position , the likelihood of source plus background @xmath39(s+b ) and the likelihood of the null hypothesis of pure background @xmath39(b )",
    "are independently maximized by allowing psf and background scale factors ( but not shape ) to vary .",
    "a sky - map of the quantity    @xmath40\\ ] ]    ( the _ maximum likelihood ratio _ or mlr ) is used to estimate and constrain the source location and the statistical significance of detection .",
    "the most probable source position corresponds to the maximum @xmath41 in the sky - map , which _ formally _ obeys the @xmath42 probability distribution with three degrees of freedom ( source intensity and position ) .",
    "thus , @xmath43 indicates a statistically significant 3@xmath1 detection . for such significant detections",
    "the source location is constrained by the quantity @xmath44 , which is distributed as @xmath45 so that formal 1@xmath1 , 2@xmath1 and 3@xmath1 statistical confidence regions in the sky - map are defined where @xmath46 , 6.2 and 11.8 , respectively .    the formal relation between likelihood ratio and @xmath42",
    "is based on the implicit assumption of an accurate psf and background model .",
    "the form of the background model is thus an important part of burst imaging , even though the number of background events during bursts is typically small .",
    "the dataspace distribution of background events present during grbs is difficult to model due to complicated temporal and spatial variations .",
    "an empirical model provides the most practical means of approximating this , but background count rates are too low to provide a sufficient statistical sample of the full 3-d distribution .",
    "fortunately , the ( @xmath33,@xmath34 ) component of this distribution is reasonably approximated by the geometry function @xmath35 mentioned above .",
    "the @xmath10 component embodies much of the background complexity .",
    "it is determined independently for each burst by directly sampling events that were detected under orbital history conditions similar to the burst observation . in practice , this is done by sampling events within a window of satellite orbital parameters chosen to approximate the orbital history of cgro at the time of a burst , and thereby the background environment during the burst .",
    "the @xmath10 distribution of directly sampled background events is combined with the geometry function ( properly normalized ) to form a 3-d background model that is then used in the imaging process .",
    "an example of real and modeled background is shown in figure  3 .",
    "the approximations used in the imaging process are all potential sources of systematic errors in the derived burst source parameters ( i.e. , source significance and localization ) .",
    "the major sources of error are : a ) the use of a single psf for all bursts , regardless of source location or energy spectrum ; b ) statistical fluctuations in the psf ; c ) the inherent accuracy of monte carlo simulations used to compute the psf ; and d ) the accuracy of the background model .",
    "the effects of each of these approximations have been studied with the use of simulations like those used to determine the psf .",
    "unfortunately , since all combinations of potential causes of error can not possibly be simulated , this technique serves only as a predictive estimate of the true errors .",
    "simulated sources with various , burst - like energy spectra , distributed throughout the fov and mixed with samples of real background were subjected to the full imaging process with a variety of psfs .",
    "the distribution of offsets between known source parameters and those derived through imaging analysis of the simulated bursts yields an estimate of systematic errors .",
    "we find that approximation ( a ) has the largest effect on source location accuracy , especially for @xmath47 , but that the error is never more than 0.75@xmath0 .",
    "the other potential causes of location error contribute only minimally .",
    "overall , simulated sources are correctly localized by the mlr imaging technique to within an error of 0.5@xmath0 ( @xmath290% confidence ) . we also find that @xmath48 ( indicating detection significance ) is correctly determined to within an error of approximately @xmath230% . the largest contributing cause in this case is approximation ( d ) , since the shape of the background in the observed comptel dataspace is difficult to model accurately .",
    "the largest errors in @xmath48 are for sources located near the earth s limb , where atmospheric gamma rays contribute most to the background and are not approximated well by our model .",
    "bursts located near the earth s limb also result in source photons backscattered off the atmosphere , which confuse the true source signature .",
    "to identify potential comptel gamma - ray bursts , we rely on the batse transient event triggering system .",
    "this system automatically detects statistically significant count rate ( 50300 kev ) increases above background in the batse large area detectors ( fishman et al .",
    "triggers can occur from gamma - ray bursts , solar flares , magnetospheric activity , earth occultation of strong celestial sources and terrestrial atmospheric events .",
    "the comptel burst search strategy is to examine data only from the times of batse triggers that are classified as grbs by the batse analysis team ( mallozzi et al .",
    "1993 ) and whose batse locations satisfy @xmath49 .",
    "this strategy is effective in identifying comptel grb candidates .",
    "an exception occurs during batse data accumulation and readout periods following all triggers ( meegan et al .",
    "the batse trigger system is disabled during these accumulation periods ( usually lasting either 4  min or 8  min ) and insensitive to new , weaker events during data readout intervals ( usually 90 min ) .",
    "these gaps in coverage must be taken into account when computing the exposure to bursts , as explained in  [ expsec ] .    in the period between 1991",
    "april 19 and 1995 may 31 there were 3608 batse triggers , 1297 of which have been classified as grbs . of these",
    ", 397 have batse locations with @xmath49 .",
    "comptel data are available for only 302 of the 397 burst candidates due to gaps in telemetry caused by the failure of cgro data recorders in 1992 .",
    "data around the time of each candidate trigger ( @xmath5015 min ) have been manually examined to identify potential burst intervals .",
    "time intervals showing the most evidence for significant counts above background were subjected to the maximum likelihood imaging process . in cases where time intervals of significant emission were ambiguous ,",
    "the approximate full duration of the burst as measured by batse was used for imaging .",
    "mlr maps were computed over a grid of sky coordinates with @xmath51 spacing and a final burst detection threshold was applied to the images by requiring @xmath52formally indicating a 3.8@xmath1 point source detection .",
    "the possibility of systematic error in the determination of @xmath48 is accounted for by using a conservative detection threshold .",
    "this ensures that only significant excesses ( @xmath533@xmath1 ) are accepted .",
    "we expect , at the most , one spurious detection in the search of 302 candidates .      over the four years of observations",
    ", we have accumulated a catalog of 29 gamma - ray bursts that satisfy the @xmath52 detection requirement .",
    "these bursts are summarized in table  1 .",
    "each detection is identified by the year ( _ yy _ ) , month ( _ mm _ ) and day ( _ dd _ ) of the burst in the form grb _ yymmdd_.",
    "the next three columns give the number , truncated julian day ( tjd ) , and seconds of the day of the corresponding batse burst trigger .",
    "this is followed by the value of @xmath48 and the most probable comptel burst location expressed in spacecraft ( @xmath54 ) , celestial ( @xmath55 ; epoch j2000.0 ) and galactic ( @xmath56 ) coordinates .",

    "one of these bursts ( grb  920627 ) was mistakenly neglected in the preliminary search and the other ( grb  950522 ) was beyond the time - interval of the earlier analysis .",
    "[ tab1 ]    statistical uncertainty regions around the most probable burst locations have been estimated by computing smoothed ( cubic spline ) contours of the mlr sky - maps at levels corresponding to 1@xmath1 , 2@xmath1 and 3@xmath1 confidence .",
    "celestial coordinate sky maps of these contours are shown in figure  4 . in general , the localizations are irregularly shaped regions , making it difficult to compare uncertainties between different bursts .",
    "a convenient _ approximate _ measure of the statistical location error is the radius of a circle having the same area as the region enclosed by the mlr contours .",
    "the value of this quantity ( @xmath57 ) for the 1@xmath1 confidence level is given in table  1 .",
    "the statistical location error is usually inversely related to the number of source events .",
    "thus , the error radius of a high - fluence burst like grb  940217 ( @xmath58 ) is much smaller than that of a weaker detection like grb  910627 ( @xmath59 ) .",

    "statistical tests are therefore conducted by monte carlo methods .",
    "the major observational biases present are the non - ideal burst locations and uneven sampling of the sky , both of which affect the interpretation of the data .      the limited extent and varying sensitivity of the comptel fov , combined with cgro s low earth orbit and sporadic pointing schedule result in a complicated sampling pattern over the sky that modifies the intrinsic angular source distribution .",
    "we must determine this pattern  the _ burst exposure function_in order to correct the observational bias it produces .",
    "assuming that bursts occur isotropically in space and uniformly in time , the relative probability @xmath81 of detecting a burst from a particular direction in the sky compared to any other direction is given by    @xmath82    where @xmath83 is the time spent observing the direction of interest , @xmath84 is the minimum fluence for a detection and @xmath85 is the differential burst size  frequency distribution ( i.e. , the number of bursts per year with 0.7530 mev fluence between @xmath86 and @xmath87 ) .",
    "evaluation of @xmath81 is complicated by the function @xmath84 , that depends on the source position within the fov , the background rate and the burst energy spectrum .",
    "we approximated @xmath81 by ignoring background and taking the burst energy spectrum to be the average power law ( @xmath88 ; kippen et al .",
    "1996a , 1997)leaving @xmath84 as a function only of sky - position through equation ( [ eqsmin ] ) .",
    "a further problem is that @xmath85 is not well - known in the comptel energy range . for simplicity , we used a power law of the form @xmath89 . for strong bursts , such as those observed by comptel ,",
    "this is a reasonable approximation ( fenimore et al .",
    "1993 ) .",
    "the above approximations were used to compute @xmath81 for every 16 seconds of observation on a grid of sky coordinates with @xmath90 spacing .",
    "directions occulted by the earth were excluded , as were all epochs when comptel and/or the batse trigger system were disabled or the spacecraft was not telemetering data .",
    "directions outside the @xmath91 search window were also excluded .",
    "sky - maps of the burst exposure function accumulated over the two analysis intervals are shown in figure  6 .",
    "the maximum value of @xmath81 in the three - year ( four - year ) exposure map is 426 ( 624 ) effective days . in both maps ,",
    "the minimum exposure is at least 30% of the maximum  meaning that all portions of sky have been observed at a reasonable level .",
    "the smooth fluctuations on top of this minimum exposure reflect the frequent earth occultation of directions along the celestial equator and the schedule of the cgro pointing program . in particular",
    ", the south galactic polar region received the least exposure , while a great deal of time was spent observing the galactic plane and virgo ( @xmath92 , @xmath93 ) regions .",
    "the effects of different spectral shapes , burst intensity function and the inclusion or exclusion of batse data accumulation periods are small ( @xmath9410% ) compared to the overall magnitude of the structures in the exposure maps .      studies of large - scale angular structure have been most concerned with the question of whether burst sources reside inside or outside our galaxy .",
    "two convenient and sensitive statistical tools for this particular purpose are the dipole and quadrupole moments in galactic coordinates ( e.g. , hartmann & epstein 1989 ; paczyski 1990 ; briggs 1993 ) .",
    "the dipole moment ( expressed as @xmath95 , where @xmath96 is the angle between a burst and the galactic center ) measures the amount of concentration towards the center of the galaxy , while the quadrupole moment ( expressed as @xmath97 , where @xmath68 is the galactic latitude of a burst ) indicates the amount of concentration towards the galactic plane .",
    "significant non - zero values of the moments indicate deviations from an isotropic source distribution .",
    "similar statistics , expressed in celestial coordinates ( i.e. , @xmath98 , where @xmath96 is the angle from the celestial origin and @xmath99 , where @xmath100 is declination ) , are more sensitive to the biases caused by the non - uniform comptel exposure function .",
    "the dipole and quadrupole moments expected for an isotropic angular distribution of sources are modified by the non - uniform burst exposure function .",
    "the magnitude of this effect was estimated by simulating random catalogs of burst locations chosen according to the comptel exposure function maps .",
    "an ensemble of moments computed from @xmath101 simulated catalogs provides a measure of the exposure - induced deviation from isotropy and the statistical uncertainty inherent in the number of bursts in each catalog .",
    "the largest deviation from the isotropic value appears in the celestial quadrupole moment , where the exposure function produces a 0.7@xmath1 bias towards polar declinations ( both three and four - year samples ) . the exposure - induced bias in galactic coordinates is much smaller ( see examples shown in figure  7 ) .",
    "observed moments were estimated by randomly blurring each of the measured burst locations according to the total ( statistical and systematic ) location error distributions .",
    "an ensemble of moments computed from many blurred catalogs provides a measure of the error induced by imprecise locations . as illustrated in figure  7",
    ", this effect is small compared to the statistical uncertainty caused by the low number of bursts .",
    "the difference between the observed and expected moments yields the true or corrected deviation from isotropy .",
    "corrected values of the dipole and quadrupole moments are given in table  3 in both galactic and celestial coordinates .",
    "uncertainties in the corrected moments reflect 68% confidence limits on the difference between the data and the simulations . within the sizable uncertainties , there are no significant deviations from large - scale isotropy evident in the comptel burst samples in either galactic or celestial coordinates .",
    "[ tab3 ]      the dipole and quadrupole moments are sensitive only on the largest of angular scales ( @xmath102 ) .",
    "different statistical tests are necessary to investigate the small - scale angular distribution of burst sources .",
    "the two standard approaches are the angular autocorrelation function @xmath103 and the nearest neighbor function @xmath104 .",
    "both statistics are sensitive to small - scale angular structure on the order of the instrumental resolution , which could suggest either intrinsic source clustering or repeated bursts from individual sources .",
    "it has been shown that the angular correlation function provides superior sensitivity to small - scale angular structure when the number of sources is large , such that the average separation between neighboring positions is less than the average location accuracy ( brainerd 1996 ) .",
    "this is not the case for the small sample of well - localized comptel bursts , where the average neighbor separation ( @xmath220@xmath0 ) is much greater than the average location accuracy ( @xmath21.25@xmath0 ) .",
    "hence , both tests were used .    the angular correlation function , first applied to grb positions by hartmann & blumenthal ( 1989 ) and hartmann , linder & blumenthal ( 1991 ) , measures the probability of finding a pair of sources separated by an angle @xmath105 . it is computed by comparing the number of source pairs @xmath106 , with angular separations in the range @xmath107 , to the number of pairs @xmath108 expected from a random sample of an isotropic distribution with    @xmath109    the presence of small - scale angular clustering is evident in @xmath103 as a significant positive deviation from zero at small angles .",
    "the nearest neighbor function @xmath104 , first used on grb positions by quashnock & lamb ( 1993 ) , differs slightly in that it compares the number of sources with one or more neighbors separated by @xmath107 to the number expected in a random , isotropic sample .",
    "small - scale clustering is evident in @xmath104 as a significant excess above the expected value at small angles .",
    "both statistics are affected by imprecise source locations , which spread the intrinsic signal of clustering over a range of @xmath105 characteristic of the average location accuracy .",
    "the signal of small - scale clustering is maximized by choosing bins in @xmath105 with the same characteristic size .",
    "figure  8 shows the angular correlation and nearest neighbor distributions for the two samples of comptel burst locations .",
    "angular bins of 2@xmath0 were used to approximate the average location accuracy at the 90% confidence level , where the signal from clustering would be most apparent .",
    "the distributions of @xmath108 expected from isotropy were determined by taking the average of @xmath110 simulated catalogs , each chosen at random according to the corresponding burst exposure function .",
    "the effect of non - uniform exposure on the @xmath108 distributions is small compared to statistical fluctuations among the random catalogs ( @xmath111 ) .",
    "the statistical significance of observed deviations in excess of the isotropic expectation was estimated by the fraction of simulated catalogs @xmath112 with an equal or greater excess in the angular bin in question .",
    "the most significant small - angle excess is evident in the first 2@xmath0 bin in the three - year catalog distributions , where @xmath113 .",
    "this excess occurs because two of the bursts ( grb  930704 and grb  940301 ) are localized to the same direction within their combined location errors  something that is not expected in a random sample of only 18 sources ( ryan et al .",
    "this near coincidence of two bursts occurring eight months apart from one another was investigated by kippen et al .",
    "( 1995b ) and hanlon et al.(1995 ) , who computed a similar chance probability for the observation ( @xmath114 . the value of @xmath112 computed here is somewhat larger due mainly to the addition of the previously neglected burst grb 920627 .",
    "kippen et al .",
    "( 1995b ) could neither prove , nor rule out the possibility that the two bursts originated from a single source  even when all other available measurements were included ( ipn , batse and cgro  egret ) .",
    "in the larger four - year sample the significance of the excess at @xmath115 is reduced to @xmath116a result of the fact that no additional bursts from the possible repeating source were observed in the year following grb  940301 , and that no other coincident pairs were measured elsewhere .",
    "we therefore conclude that the four - year sample is consistent with isotropy on small scales .",
    "examination of correlations between grbs and catalogs of known objects is similar to the study of self - clustering described above .",
    "statistical tools like the nearest neighbor test and the angular correlation function are simply modified by computing angles between grb / object pairs , rather than angles between pairs of different bursts . as in the case of self - clustering ,",
    "cross correlations between grbs and known objects are affected by burst location errors , which spread the cross - correlation signal over an angular range characteristic of the average burst location error .",
    "although many different types of astronomical catalogs have been examined , we chose to concentrate only on galaxy clusters and radio - quiet quasars , which are suggested to correlate with batse 3b burst locations ( kolatt & piran 1996 ; marani et al .",
    "1997 ; schartel , andernach & greiner 1997 ) .",
    "in particular , we used the galaxy cluster catalog of abell , corwin & olowin ( 1989 , hereafter aco ) , and the quasar catalog of vron - cetty & vron ( 1996 , hereafter vcv ) .",
    "the full aco catalog ( aco-1 ) contains 5250 galaxy clusters , categorized by several parameters , including richness class @xmath117 and distance class @xmath118 . a subset of the 185 aco galaxy clusters with @xmath119 and @xmath120 ( aco-2 )",
    "was examined separately since this particular subset was suggested to show a correlation with the most accurate batse burst locations ( marani et al .",
    "1997 and references therein ) .",
    "the vcv catalog contains @xmath121 quasars and active galactic nuclei .",
    "we examined only the radio - quiet quasars , as selected by schartel , andernach & greiner ( 1997 ) .",
    "the full radio - quiet quasar sample ( vcv-1 ) contains 7146 objects .",
    "a subset of 967 radio - quiet quasars with redshift @xmath122 and absolute magnitude @xmath123 ( vcv-2 ) was also examined since this sample shows the strongest correlation with batse grbs .",
    "[ tab4 ]    the computation of angular cross - correlation between comptel grbs and aco / vcv catalog locations was performed as in the case of self - clustering . in each 2@xmath0 angular bin",
    "the number of observed grb / catalog pairs @xmath106 was compared to the average number obtained from @xmath110 random comptel `` catalogs '' @xmath108 ( sampled from the four - year comptel burst exposure function ) through equation ( [ eqacor ] ) .",
    "table  4 lists the results for grb / catalog pair angular separations @xmath115 .",
    "the uncertainty in @xmath108 given in the table reflects the standard deviation of the random catalogs and @xmath112 is the statistical significance of the observed number of pairs compared to the expected number .",
    "none of the four catalog samples show a significant correlation with comptel grb locations at small angles , where one expects the signal if an association exists .",
    "angular cross - correlation functions for the aco-2 and vcv-2 object catalogs are shown in figure  9 .",
    "while a `` local '' grb source population has not been examined in as much detail as the more distant possibilities , such an origin ( i.e. , sources within @xmath124 au ) is not inconsistent with the angular and intensity distributions observed by batse ( maoz 1993 ; horack et al.1994 ) .",
    "lower limits on the distance to burst sources are therefore important .",
    "as pointed out by hurley ( 1982 ) , timing differences between four or more widely separated ipn spacecraft in a favorable configuration could be used to yield a lower limit on the burst source distance . while only a few events have been observed by this many ipn spacecraft ,",
    "the idea can also be applied to the bursts localized by comptel and the two - spacecraft , cgro/_ulysses _ ipn .    if a burst is observed by two spacecraft separated by a distance @xmath68 , the angle @xmath125 between the burst direction and the inter - spacecraft baseline",
    "is    @xmath126    where @xmath127 is the speed of light , @xmath118 is the distance to the burst source and @xmath128 is the observed difference in burst arrival times between the two spacecraft ( connors et al .",
    "thus , @xmath129 is larger than that inferred from the time - delay alone ( @xmath130 ) by a parallax factor that is inversely related to the source distance .",
    "if the offset of a burst position from an ipn annulus were measured , it would reveal the source distance .",
    "the fact that comptel burst localizations agree with ipn annuli to within the comptel location accuracy places a lower limit on the distance to burst sources .",
    "the severity of this limit improves with the accuracy of the comptel localization ( in the direction perpendicular to the ipn annulus ) and the length of the ipn baseline ( @xmath68 ) .",
    "[ tab5 ]    according to the procedure described in  [ ipnsec ] , the total ( statistical and systematic ) comptel localization of a burst can be maximized along an annulus to reveal the most - likely combined position and the probability at that position . in computing a quantitative comptel",
    "/ ipn distance limit this technique was applied to a set of concentric annuli with angular radii @xmath125 progressively smaller than @xmath131 .",
    "this yielded  with the use of equation ( [ eqdipn])the comptel location probability as a function of source distance @xmath118 .",
    "uncertainty in the width of the ipn annuli was incorporated by substituting @xmath132 in the calculation of probability as a function of @xmath118 .",
    "integration of this function at the desired confidence level yields a lower limit .",
    "the most constraining distance lower limits ( @xmath133 ) at the 2@xmath1 confidence level are listed in table  5 .",
    "even when all known systematic location errors are conservatively included , the distance to these bursts must be at least @xmath2100 au in order to be consistent with the comptel / ipn measurements .",
    "we have demonstrated the ability of comptel to accurately localize grb sources through direct compton scatter imaging .",
    "this ability has been used to accumulate a unique collection of locations for bursts having a high fluence of gamma rays in the energy range 0.7530 mev .",
    "analysis of the comptel locations has shown that these bursts , apparently like all others , are consistent with an isotropic angular distribution of sources .",
    "furthermore , we find no statistically significant excess of grb locations clustered at small angles , which would be expected if many of the sources we observed burst repeatedly on time - scales of several months .",
    "we also find no significant cross - correlation with aco galaxy clusters or radio - quiet vcv quasars , and have placed a lower limit on the distance to grb sources by comparing the comptel locations to ipn timing annuli .",
    "the comptel measurements thus contribute to our understanding of the grb phenomenon in each of the three currently feasible source distance regimes .    for a local heliospheric origin ,",
    "the distance constraints required by comptel / ipn burst location measurements dispute any scenarios in which the sources of brighter ( and therefore closer , assuming bursts are roughly `` standard luminosity candles '' ) grbs are nearer than @xmath2100 au ( approximately the distance of the solar wind termination shock ) .",
    "relativistic dust grain models ( grindlay & fazio 1974 ; dasgupta 1979 ) and nearby ( 40400 au ) colliding comet scenarios ( white 1993 , 1994 ) are therefore unfavorable . more distant oort cloud models involving mergers between comets , antimatter and/or primordial black holes ( katz 1993 ; dermer 1996 ; bickert & greiner 1993 ) are not excluded by our distance limits . however , dynamical simulations of potential oort cloud grb progenitor distributions indicate that it is difficult to restrict grbs only to the outer , more distant portions of the cloud ( clarke , blaes & tremaine 1994 ) . in order to obey the angular and intensity distributions measured with batse _ and _ the distance lower limits reported here , oort cloud models must invoke an _ ad hoc _ assumption that the grb progenitor distance has a sharp cutoff between 100500 au ( e.g. , horack et al .",
    "future instruments capable of more accurate grb localization ( e.g. , bepposax and hete-2 ) may increase the distance limit .",
    "for example , a burst localized with arc - minute accuracy could ( when compared to an ipn annulus ) raise the distance lower limit to thousands of au .",
    "the galactic dipole and quadrupole moments of comptel burst locations independently confirm the long - known result that strong bursts are distributed isotropically ( atteia et al .",
    "1987 ; hartmann & epstein 1989 ) .",
    "in addition , the comptel measurements mean that grbs with predominantly hard spectra are probably from the same angular source distribution as the main bulk of events observed by batse , even though the radial distribution of soft and hard events measured with batse intensities may differ ( e.g. , belli 1995 ; kouveliotou et al .",
    "these results are important in the context of galactic halo scenarios , where one expects all the nearer , brighter bursts to exhibit a significant positive dipole moment due to the 8.5 kpc offset of the sun from the galactic center .",
    "unfortunately , the absence of a dipole in the comptel bursts is not constraining due to the large uncertainties involved .    in the cosmological distance regime , the absence of significant small - angle correlations among the comptel locations is important , since it bears upon the question of burst repetition . given that the larger four - year sample of bursts does not show any significant evidence for small - scale clustering , we must conclude that the two - burst overlap between grb  930704 and grb  940301 was either a statistical fluke , or that the two bursts were from a rare repeating source ( or source cluster ) , whose rate of repetition at the comptel sensitivity level is low .",
    "if the latter case is true , the lack of excess batse bursts from the grb  930704/grb  940301 region indicates that the repetition rate from this source is also low at the batse sensitivity level .",
    "the rarity of repeating grb sources can be estimated from the comptel observations , where the fraction of observed repeating burst sources must be less than @xmath134 .",
    "we can obtain this number without the use of complicated statistical tests , as are required in the analysis of batse locations ( e.g. , see meegan et al .",
    "1995 ; tegmark et al .",
    "1996 ) , since any other possible repeater candidates would be immediately obvious given the small number of comptel bursts and the accuracy of the locations .",
    "it is interesting that limits on the fraction of repeating burst sources obtained with batse ( incorporating thousands of bursts ) are about the same as the 7% given here , even though batse detects bursts that are an order of magnitude weaker ( meegan et al .  1996 ; tegmark et al.1996 ) .",
    "it thus appears that either : a ) repeating burst sources are rare , b ) the typical repetition time - scale is @xmath531 yr , or c ) repeated bursts are too weak to be reliably detected , even by batse .",
    "more constraining results will come from continued observations and from future instruments with improved location accuracy .    of further importance in the cosmological distance regime",
    "is the lack of significant correlation between comptel bursts and either aco galaxy clusters or radio - quiet quasars .",
    "these findings question the reality of batse / aco / vcv associations that have been suggested . according to marani et al .",
    "( 1997 ) the strongest cross - correlation signal for batse / aco clusters ( @xmath23.5 - 4@xmath1 significance ) is obtained for the 27 batse 3b bursts with the smallest location errors and that the signal weakens as bursts with larger location errors are included .",
    "this could indicate that bright ( or high fluence ) bursts are more highly correlated with aco galaxy clusters than weak events , since bright bursts tend to yield smaller statistical location errors than weaker bursts .",
    "this behavior is exactly what we would expect of cosmological grbs , where only the closest , brightest events would be correlated with relatively nearby aco galaxies .",
    "however , the same correlation should exist in the comptel bursts , since they are the same average brightness and fluence as the 27 well - localized batse 3b events .",
    "in fact , the two samples share six bursts in common .",
    "the only significant difference between the comptel and batse burst samples is that the comptel events have harder spectra , on average , than the batse bursts .",
    "it is possible that hard events are not as strongly correlated with aco galaxy clusters as are soft bursts , but it is more likely that the batse / aco correlation is a statistical fluke .",
    "this conclusion is supported by hurley et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , who find that a majority of the aco clusters that are correlated with batse locations are inconsistent with ipn timing annuli  implying that the batse / aco correlation is statistical in origin .",
    "the lack of a correlation between comptel burst locations and vcv radio - quiet quasars is less meaningful , since the number of comptel bursts is much smaller than the number of batse events ( 80 bursts with location errors @xmath135 ) used by schartel , andernach & greiner ( 1997 ) .",
    "the weak grb / quasar correlation using the more numerous batse locations may be below the sensitivity of the comptel sample due to its larger statistical uncertainty .",
    "while the collective analysis of comptel burst locations offers some insight into the grb mystery , perhaps the greatest value of the locations is in facilitating rapid counterpart search efforts .",
    "the recent discovery of x - ray and optical emission fading on a time - scale of hours / days from the bepposax locations of grb 970228 and grb 970508 ( costa et al .  1997a , 1997b ; van paradijs et al .  1997",
    "; bond 1997 ) highlights the value of rapid follow - up studies using accurate burst locations .",
    "during the course of the cgro mission , we have developed a rapid response system to quickly compute comptel grb locations and distribute them to multi - wavelength observers ( primarily optical and radio ) around the world ( kippen et al .",
    "the advantage of using the relatively accurate comptel locations is that they allow deeper searches than previous , and most other current efforts .",
    "the system has been used for several bursts , resulting in some of the most sensitive radio / optical observations of burst locations ever obtained within several hours ( see e.g. , harrison et al .",
    "1995 ; mcnamara et al .",
    "1996 and references therein ) .",
    "while no fading counterparts have been detected as a result of the comptel rapid response effort , the observations obtained point the way for future studies , which must concentrate on deep exposures within minutes of a grb .",
    "this is the goal of continuing comptel rapid response efforts , as well as several on - going and planned new missions .",
    "if the optical lightcurves of grb 970228 and grb 970508 are typical then wide - field instruments guided by a comptel grb location within @xmath21 hour may detect the fading counterpart .",
