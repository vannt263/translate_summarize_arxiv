    "greenberger - horne - zeilinger ( ghz ) states are of great interest in the fundamental test of quantum mechanics [ 1 ] and may prove to be useful in quantum metrology [ 2 ] and high - precision spectroscopy [ 3 - 5 ] .",
    "they have many applications in quantum information processing ( qip ) and quantum communication such as quantum teleportation [ 6,7 ] , entanglement swapping [ 8 ] , quantum cryptographic [ 9 ] , and error correction protocols [ 10,11 ] . during the past decade",
    ", a great deal of efforts has been devoted to generating ghz states in various physical systems .",
    "for example , based on cavity or circuit qed , many theoretical methods have been presented for generating multiqubit ghz states with atoms [ 12 ] , quantum dots [ 13,14 ] , and superconducting qubits [ 15 - 18 ] . a natural question on how to store the prepared ghz states and how to protect them against decoherence would become interesting and important .",
    "hybrid quantum systems , composed of different kinds of qubits , have attracted tremendous attentions recently [ 19 - 27 ] .",
    "in addition , cavity or circuit qed has been considered as one of the most promising candidates for implementing large - scale qip [ 28 - 30 ] .",
    "when two sets of qubits placed in a cavity or resonator are hybrid ( i.e. , different types ) , qubits in one set can act as information processing cells ( i.e. , the operation qubits ) while qubits in the other set play a role of information memory elements ( i.e. , the memory qubits ) . here , the operation qubits are readily controlled and thus used for performing quantum operations , while the memory qubits have long decoherence time and thus are good to be used for storing quantum states .",
    "it is well known that multiqubit entangled states are essential resources for large - scale qip . when performing qip in a hybrid system , after a step of information processing is completed , one needs to transfer entangled states of operation qubits to memory qubits for storage ; and one needs to transfer the entangled states from the memory qubits back to the operation qubits when a further step of processing is needed .    it has been recognized that decoherence resulting from the coupling of the system with environment is one of the main obstacles in realizing a quantum information processor . generally speaking , the effect of decoherence in carrying out qip can be minimized as long as the typical operation time for performing various quantum operations is much shorter than the decoherence time of the system involved in qip . in contrast , decoherence may pose a significant issue during the storage of quantum states ( especially in the case when quantum states are stored for a long time ) .",
    "hence , how to protect quantum states from decoherence is important in achieving an efficient storage of quantum states .    motivated by the above , in this work we focus on how to transfer multiqubit entangled states from operation qubits onto memory qubits , and how to protect the transferred multiqubit entangled states against decoherence induced due to interacting with phase - dumping environments during the storage .",
    "note that phase dumping can be a dominating decoherence source for noise environments , which has been widely studied over the past years [ 31 - 38 ] .    in the following , we consider a physical system which consists of @xmath0 operation qubits and @xmath1 memory qubits placed in a cavity or coupled to a resonator . we will propose a method to transfer an @xmath0-qubit ghz state @xmath2 ( with arbitrary coefficients @xmath3 and @xmath4 ) from @xmath0 operation qubits onto @xmath1 memory qubits , in the form of @xmath5 encoded in a decoherence - free subspace ( dfs ) against collective dephasing .",
    "the dfs here is spanned by the basis vectors @xmath6 and @xmath7 of every two memory qubits . as shown below",
    ", this approach has the following advantages : ( i ) since the transferred ghz states are encoded within a dfs , they are immune from dephasing during the storage on the memory qubits ; ( ii ) this protocol can be used to transfer the ghz states deterministically ; ( iii ) the state transfer procedure needs only a few basic operations , which does not depend on the number of qubits ; ( iv ) the operation time does not increase as the number of qubits increases ; ( v ) no measurement is needed ; ( vi ) during the operation , the level @xmath8 only for two qubits is occupied and thus decoherence from the qubits is greatly suppressed .",
    "this proposal can be applied to implement the ghz state transfer between various hybrid qubits such as natural atoms and artificial atoms [ e.g. , quantum dots , nitrogen - vacancy ( nv ) centers , superconducting qubits , etc . ] . to the best of our knowledge , how to transfer entangled states onto memory qubits in a dfs , based on cavity / circuit qed , has not been investigated until today .",

    "consider two sets of hybrid qubits in a cavity or resonator ( fig .",

    "2 ) . note that the level spacings of superconducting qubits can be rapidly ( within a few nanoseconds [ 39 - 41 ) adjusted by varying external control parameters ( e.g. , the magnetic flux applied to the superconducting loop of qubits ; see e.g. [ 28,39,42,43 ] ) , the level spacings of nv centers can be adjusted by changing the external magnetic field applied to the nv centers [ 44,45 ] , and the level spacings of atoms or quantum dots can be adjusted by changing the voltage on the electrodes around each atom / quantum dot [ 46 ] .",
    "each qubit is initially decoupled from the cavity ( fig .  2 ) .",
    "suppose that the @xmath0 operation qubits ( @xmath13 ) are initially in a ghz state@xmath22 ( with normalized unknown factors @xmath3 and @xmath4)@xmath23    note that the state @xmath24 of the @xmath0 operation qubits ( 1,2, ... ,@xmath0 ) can be prepared using the existing schemes ( e.g. , [ 12 - 18 ] ) . by applying classical pulses to the operation qubit @xmath25 the states @xmath26 and @xmath27 can be easily converted into the states @xmath27 and @xmath28 , respectively .",

    "similar phrases are used to represent the transition between the levels @xmath37 and @xmath49 as well as the transition between the levels @xmath29 and @xmath50    from the description given below , one can see that there is no need of adjusting the qubit level spacings during the entire ghz state transfer .",
    "the whole procedure for transferring the ghz state @xmath51 of the @xmath0 operation qubits ( @xmath13 ) onto the @xmath52 memory qubits ( @xmath9 ) is listed as follows :    step ( i ) : bring the cavity resonant with the @xmath44 transition of qubit @xmath18 [ fig .",

    "the hamiltonian is given by ( setting @xmath77)@xmath78under the large detuning conditions @xmath79 and @xmath80 there is no energy exchange between the qubits and the cavity mode .",
    "then , the system dynamics described by the hamiltonian of eq . ( 5 ) is equivalent to that determined by the following effective hamiltonian [ 48 - 50 ] @xmath81where @xmath82 @xmath83 @xmath84 @xmath85 ( line 4 ) , @xmath86 ( line 5 ) , and @xmath87 ( line 6 ) .",

    "after an interaction time @xmath107 the resonator mode and qubit @xmath20 undergo the transformation @xmath108 and @xmath109 .",

    ", one can see that the original @xmath0-qubit ghz state of qubits ( @xmath13 ) has been transferred onto the memory qubits ( @xmath111 ) after the operation .",
    "after this step of operation , the cavity frequency needs to be adjusted back to its original frequency ( fig .",
    "2 ) such that the qubit system is decoupled from the cavity .",
    "note that by applying classical pulses to the qubit @xmath112 the states @xmath113 and @xmath114 can be easily converted into the states @xmath115 and @xmath116 , respectively . also , by applying classical pulses to the memory qubits ( @xmath117 ) , one can convert the states @xmath118 and @xmath119 of each of the memory qubits ( @xmath120 ) into the states @xmath37 and @xmath49 , respectively . in this case , the entangled ghz state of the @xmath1 memory qubits , i.e. , the left part in the square bracket of eq .",

    "here , @xmath128 is an arbitrary environment operator , @xmath129 is the coupling constant of the two paired memory qubits ( @xmath130 ) with the noise environment , @xmath131 @xmath132 and @xmath133 @xmath134 are the operators of qubits @xmath135 and @xmath136 respectively . by comparing eq.(1 ) with eq.(11 ) , one can see that only two memory qubits are needed to protect one of ghz qubits against decoherence caused by the dephasing environment .    tuning the cavity frequency has been reported in various experiments for both optical cavities and microwave cavities [ 51 - 54 ] .",
    "for instance , the rapid tuning of cavity frequencies in @xmath137 nanoseconds has been experimentally demonstrated for a superconducting transmission line resonator [ 53,54 ] . we should mention that adjusting the cavity frequency is unnecessary for this proposal .",
    "alternatively , the qubit - cavity resonant interaction and the qubit - cavity dispersive interaction , which are required by the ghz state transfer , can be achieved by adjusting the level spacings of the qubits [ 28,39,42 - 46 ] .",
    "several points may need to be addressed here .",
    "first , the ghz state transfer only employs the coupling of the cavity with the @xmath138 @xmath8 transition of each qubit ( fig .  3 ) .",
    "hence , this proposal is applicable to qubits with forbidden @xmath139 and @xmath140 transitions . it also applies to qubits with @xmath141 and @xmath142 transitions as long as these transitions are highly detuned ( i.e. , decoupled ) from the cavity , which can be achieved by adjusting the qubits level spacings before performing the ghz state transfer [ 28,39,42 - 46 ] .",
    "second , as shown above , the level @xmath74 for operation qubits ( @xmath19 ) and memory qubits ( @xmath143 ) is unpopulated , i.e. , the level @xmath8 is occupied only for the two qubits @xmath18 and @xmath20 during the entire operation .",
    "third , the operations for transferring ghz states have nothing to do with @xmath3 and @xmath144 last , the method is applicable to a 1d , 2d or 3d cavity or resonator as long as the conditions described above can be met .",
    "we should mention that since no measurement is involved during the ghz state transfer , it is straightforward to show that the transferred ghz state can be transferred back onto the operation qubits from the memory qubits by performing the inverse operations of the above unitary operations .",
    "note that the ghz state given in eq .",
    "( 1 ) is an @xmath0-qubit quantum secret sharing code for encoding an arbitrary single - qubit pure state @xmath145 [ 55 ] , while the transferred ghz state given in eq .  (",
    "11 ) is a quantum secret sharing encoded with @xmath0 pairs of memory qubits in a dfs .",
    "thus , this proposal also provides a way to transfer quantum secret sharing from @xmath0 operation qubits to @xmath0 pairs of memory qubits in a dfs .",
    "the state in eq .",
    "( 11 ) may also be usable for keeping a resource of controlled quantum teleportation .",
    "note that a swap gate on qubits @xmath146 and @xmath147 , described by the state transformation @xmath148 with @xmath149 can be used to implement the state transfer from qubit @xmath146 to qubit @xmath147 or vice versa .",
    "thus , it is straightforward to show that the transfer of an @xmath0-qubit ghz state , considered in this work , can be completed with @xmath0 swap gates each acting on an operation qubit and a memory logical qubit . here , a memory logical qubit consists of two memory qubits ( e.g. , qubit pair @xmath150 or @xmath151 ) , whose two logical states are the states @xmath152 and @xmath153 which form a dfs against collective dephasing . according to [ 56 ] , construction of a swap gate requires three cnot gates , which can be realized by the idea presented in [ 57 ] . in this sense",
    ", 3n cnot gates are needed for constructing @xmath0 swap gates .",
    "thus , at least 3n basic operations are necessary to transfer an @xmath0-qubit ghz state from the @xmath0 operation qubits to the @xmath1 memory qubits , provided that a cnot gate can be realized with one basic operation only . in stark contrast , as shown above , the present proposal requires only a few operational steps to transfer an @xmath0-qubit ghz state , which is independent of @xmath0 .",
    "based on cavity / circuit qed , there exist a number of schemes for generating the ghz states in various types of qubits ( e.g. , refs .",
    "[ 12 - 18 ] ) , which are based on qubit - cavity resonant interaction ( qcri ) or dispersive interaction .",
    "as shown above , the ghz state transfer is mainly based on step ( ii ) , which was performed via the dispersive interaction .",
    "regarding the operation speed , the ghz state transfer is comparable to the ghz state preparation based on dispersive interaction .",
    "this is because the ghz state generation requires an initial state preparation of the qubit system .",
    "when the number of qubits is large , the operational speed for the ghz state transfer here may also be comparable to that of the ghz state generation based on qcri .",
    "reasons for that are the following .",
    "the ghz state preparation via qcri requires a cavity photon resonantly interacting with each qubit sequentially , and thus step - by - step control is needed .",
    "although each step can be performed fast due to using qcri , the total operation time increases linearly with the number of qubits and becomes long when the number of qubits is large .",
    "however , as shown above , the procedure for the ghz state transfer only needs a few operational steps and the operation time is independent of the number of qubits .",
    "this work is also of interest from the following point of view .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , we considered two sets of qubits , i.e. , operation qubits and memory qubits . the operation qubits are readily controlled and thus preferable to be used for performing various quantum operations required by quantum computing .",
    "compared to the memory qubits , the operation qubits have shorter decoherence time .",
    "thus , the prepared ghz states with the operation qubits are easy to be destroyed due to decoherence .",
    "one would need to repeat preparing them once they are destroyed .",
    "however , this problem is mitigated by transferring the ghz states from the operation qubits onto the memory qubits for a long time storage .",
    "for the method to work , the following requirements need to be satisfied :    \\(i ) the condition @xmath154 needs to be met . because of",
    "@xmath155 and @xmath156 this condition can be readily reached with an appropriate choice of @xmath66 ( or @xmath70 ) via adjusting the level spacings of qubits ( @xmath157 ) [ or qubits ( @xmath158 ) ] or the coupling constant @xmath65 ( @xmath159 ) by varying the qubit locations in the cavity .",
    "\\(ii ) the total operation time is @xmath160which is independent of the number of qubits . here",
    ", @xmath161 is the typical time required for adjusting the cavity frequency while @xmath162 is the typical time required for applying the classical pulses .",
    "the operation time @xmath163 should be much smaller than the energy relaxation time and the dephasing time of qubits .",
    "in addition , @xmath164 should be much smaller than the lifetime of the cavity mode , which is given by @xmath165 ( @xmath166 is the quality factor of the cavity ) . in principle",
    ", these requirements can be satisfied as follows .",
    "the operation time @xmath164 can be reduced by increasing the coupling constants @xmath65 and @xmath167 by shortening the pulse duration via increasing the pulse rabi frequency , and by rapidly adjusting the cavity frequency ( e.g. , @xmath168",

    "flux qubits have stronger level anharmonicity ( compared to transmon qubits ) while transmon qubits have relatively long decoherence time reported in experiments .",

    "the typical transition frequency between two neighbor levels @xmath16 and @xmath8 can be made to be @xmath198 ghz .",
    "thus , as an example , choose @xmath199 ghz .",
    "in addition , consider @xmath200 and thus we have @xmath201 @xmath202s , which is much longer than the operation time @xmath195 @xmath65s given above .",
    "the required resonator quality factor here is achievable in experiment because tlrs with a ( loaded )  quality factor @xmath203 have been experimentally demonstrated [ 65,66 ] .",
    "the result presented here shows that transferring a three - qubit ghz state from superconducting flux qubits onto superconducting transmon qubits in a dfs is possible within present - day circuit qed .",
    "we remark that further investigation is needed for each particular experimental setup .",
    "however , this requires a rather lengthy and complex analysis , which is beyond the scope of this theoretical work .",
    "we have shown that multi - qubit ghz states can be deterministically transferred from the operation qubits onto the memory qubits , through only a few basic operations .",
    "since the transferred ghz states are encoded with memory qubits within a dfs , they are immune from dephasing environments , and thus can in principle be protected against decoherence caused by dephasing for an indefinite length of time ( without the need for frequent checking ) . as shown above , the state transfer does not depend on the number of qubits , the operation time does not increase with the number of qubits , and no measurement is needed during the entire operation .",
    "moreover , since the level @xmath8 only for two qubits was occupied during the operation , decoherence from the qubits is greatly suppressed . this proposal can be applied to a wide range of hybrid qubits such as natural atoms and artificial atoms ( e.g. , quantum dots , nv centers , and various superconducting qubits ) .",

    "<S> different from the previous works on generating entangled states , this work is focused on how to transfer the prepared entangled states onto memory qubits for protecting them against decoherence . </S>",
    "<S> we here consider a physical system consisting of @xmath0 operation qubits and @xmath1 memory qubits placed in a cavity or coupled to a resonator . </S>",
    "<S> a method is presented for transferring @xmath0-qubit greenberger - horne - zeilinger ( ghz ) entangled states from the operation qubits ( i.e. , information processing cells ) onto the memory qubits ( i.e. , information memory elements with long decoherence time ) . </S>",
    "<S> the transferred ghz states are encoded in a decoherence - free subspace against collective dephasing , and thus can be immune from decoherence induced by a dephasing environment . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , the state transfer procedure has nothing to do with the number of qubits , the operation time does not increase with the number of qubits , and no measurement is needed for the state transfer . </S>",
    "<S> this proposal can be applied to a wide range of hybrid qubits such as natural atoms and artificial atoms ( e.g. , various solid - state qubits ) . </S>"
