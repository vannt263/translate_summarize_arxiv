    "in the framework of supersymmetric models with @xmath11-parity conservation , it has been argued that for large @xmath12 the neutralino relic density ( @xmath13 ) can be compatible with the recent cosmological data which favour small values for @xmath13 . in this regime",
    "the neutralino ( @xmath14 ) pair annihilation through @xmath3-channel pseudo - scalar higgs boson ( @xmath15 ) exchange leads to an enhanced annihilation cross sections reducing significantly the relic density @xcite , while the heavy @xmath16-even higgs ( @xmath17 ) exchange is @xmath18-wave suppressed and not that important .",
    "the importance of this mechanism , in conjunction with the recent cosmological data which favour small values of the dark matter ( dm ) relic density , has been stressed in @xcite .",
    "the same mechanism has been also invoked in ref .",
    "@xcite and @xcite where it has been shown that it enlarges the cosmologically allowed regions .",
    "in fact cosmology does not put severe upper bounds on sparticle masses , and soft masses can be in the tev region , pushing up the sparticle mass spectrum to regions that might escape detection in future planned accelerators .",
    "such upper bounds are imposed , however , by the recent @xmath19 e281 data @xcite constraining the cmssm in such a way that supersymmetry will be accessible to lhc or other planned @xmath7 linear colliders if their center of mass energy is larger than about @xmath20 @xcite .",
    "the bounds put by the @xmath19 has been the subject of intense phenomenological study @xcite , and although the situation has not been definitely settled , supersymmetry emerges as a prominent candidate in explaining the discrepancy between the standard model predictions and experimental measurements .    in this study",
    "we undertake the problem of calculating the neutralino relic density , in the framework of the cmssm , paying special attention to the pseudo - scalar higgs exchange which dominates in the large @xmath21 region . in this regime",
    "the cosmologically allowed domains depend sensitively on this mechanism and in conjunction with the bounds put by the @xmath19 measurements can severely constrain the cmssm predictions . in particular",
    ", we find that cosmologically allowed corridors of large @xmath22 values open up for @xmath23 , which however have little overlap with the regions allowed by the e821 data .",
    "the constraints imposed on the sparticle spectrum and the potential of discovering cmssm in future accelerators are discussed .",
    "the @xmath24 fusion to the pseudo - scalar higgs boson , @xmath15 , which subsequently decays to a @xmath4 or a @xmath5 , becomes the dominant annihilation mechanism for large @xmath21 , when the pseudo - scalar mass @xmath25 approaches twice the neutralino mass , @xmath26 .",
    "in fact by increasing @xmath21 the mass @xmath25 decreases , while the neutralino mass remains almost constant , if the other parameters are kept fixed .",
    "thus @xmath25 is expected eventually to enter into the regime in which it is close to the pole value @xmath27 , and the pseudo - scalar higgs exchange dominates .",
    "it is interesting to point out that in a previous analysis of the direct dm searches @xcite , we had stressed that the contribution of the @xmath16-even higgs bosons exchange to the lsp - nucleon scattering cross sections increases with @xmath21 . therefore in the large @xmath21 regime one obtains the highest possible rates for the direct dm searches .",
    "similar results are presented in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in the framework of the cmssm the chargino mass bound as well as",
    "the recent lep higgs mass bound @xcite already exclude regions in which @xmath14 has a large higgsino component , and thus in the regions of interest the @xmath14 is mainly a bino .",
    "a bino is characterized by a very small coupling to the pseudo - scalar higgs @xmath15 , however the largeness of @xmath21 balances the smallness of its coupling giving a sizeable effect when @xmath28 , making the @xmath3-channel pseudo - scalar exchange important .",
    "it becomes obvious from the previous discussion that an unambiguous and reliable determination of the @xmath15-mass , @xmath25 , is demanded before one embarks on to calculate the neutralino relic density especially in regions where the @xmath3-channel pseudo - scalar exchange dominates . in the constrained susy models , such as the cmssm",
    ", @xmath25 is not a free parameter but is determined once @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath15 as well as @xmath21 and the sign of @xmath29 , @xmath30 , are given .",
    "@xmath25 depends sensitively on the higgs mixing parameter , @xmath31 , which is determined from minimizing the one - loop corrected effective potential .",
    "a subtlety arises for large @xmath21 values since the corrections are relatively large due mainly to the smallness of the higgs mixing parameter . in order to handle this",
    "we calculate the effective potential using as reference scale the average stop scale @xmath32 @xcite . at this scale",
    "the contributions of the third generation sfermions are small",
    ". however , other contributions may not be negligible at this scale and should be properly taken into account .",
    "in particular , the neutralino and chargino contributions to the effective potential should be included for a more reliable calculation .",
    "these do not vanish at @xmath33 since their masses , determined by the gaugino masses @xmath34 and the @xmath29 value , may be quite different from @xmath33 .",
    "their inclusion to the effective potential improves the mass of the @xmath15-higgs , as this is calculated from the effective potential , yielding a result that is scale independent and approximates the pole mass to better than @xmath35 if we also include the scale dependent logarithmic contributions from the wave function renormalization @xmath36 @xcite .",
    "i the present work and for a more accurate determination of the pseudo - scalar higgs we use the pole mass using the expression of ref .",
    "@xcite .    a more significant correction , which drastically affects the pseudo - scalar mass arises from the gluino  sbottom and chargino ",
    "stop corrections to the bottom quark yukawa coupling @xcite .",
    "taking these effects into account the tree - level relation between the bottom mass and the corresponding yukawa coupling is modified according to @xmath37 where @xmath38 is @xmath39 in this the first ( second ) term is the gluino , sbottom ( chargino , stop ) corrections . in the second term",
    "we have ignored the small electroweak mixing effects .",
    "the function @xmath40 in eq .",
    "( [ arnow ] ) is the one used in refs .",
    "@xcite which in @xcite is denoted by @xmath41 .",
    "it is known that the proper resummation of these corrections is important for a correct determination of @xmath42 @xcite .",
    "( [ bottom ] ) and ( [ arnow ] ) agree with those of ref .",
    "@xcite and therefore these corrections have been properly resummed   and the soft gaugino masses differ in sign from those of ref .",
    "@xcite , while @xmath43 has the same sign . ] .",
    "these are very important , especially the sqcd corrections , and should be duly taken into account .",
    "the important point is that these affect differently the @xmath44 and @xmath45 values of @xmath25 in a drastic way . in figure [ fig1 ]",
    "we show the behaviour for the pseudo - scalar higgs boson mass as function of the parameter @xmath21 for the inputs shown in the figure , for both signs of @xmath29 , with and without the aforementioned corrections .",
    "also plotted is the value of the quantity @xmath46 .",
    "one observes that in the absence of these correction to the bottom yukawa coupling , the pseudo - scalar higgs mass in the two cases differ little and meet the @xmath46 line at @xmath47 .",
    "obviously the @xmath21 region around this value leads to enhanced neutralino annihilation cross sections through @xmath15-exchange since we are in the vicinity of a pole .",
    "however , when the aforementioned corrections are taken into account the values of the pseudo - scalar mass in the two cases split as shown in the figure . that corresponding to the @xmath44 is moving upwards and that to @xmath45 downwards .",
    "thus only the second can reach the pole value @xmath46 at a smaller @xmath21 however .",
    "the mass corresponding to @xmath44 stays away from this , never reaching it , at least in the case shown , since for higher values of @xmath21 we enter regions which are theoretically forbidden .",
    "actually in these regions electroweak symmetry breaking does not occur .",
    "the @xmath45 case does not stay comfortably well with the @xmath48 process , as well as with the observed discrepancy of the @xmath19 data , if the latter are attributed to supersymmetry , and therefore we shall discard it in the sequel .",
    "it is obvious from the previous discussion that the crucial parameter in this analysis is the ratio @xmath49 .",
    "the calculation of the pseudo - scalar higgs boson mass @xmath25 we have discussed in detail before . for the calculation of the @xmath14 mass we use the one - loop corrections of ref .",
    "these result to corrections as large as @xmath50 , in some cases , reducing the aforementioned ratio , making it to be closer to the pole value .",
    "before embarking on to present our results we shall comment on our numerical analysis employed in this paper",
    ". this will be useful when comparing the results of this paper with those of other works , which use different numerical schemes in determining the mass parameters of the cmssm .",
    "the predictions for the sparticle spectrum , including the mass of the pseudo - scalar higgs , as well as the calculation of the relic density itself , may be sensitive to some of the parameters and the particular scheme employed .",
    "in our analysis we use two - loop renormalization group equations ( rge ) , in the @xmath51 scheme , for all masses and couplings involved .",
    "the unification scale @xmath52 is defined as the point at which the gauge couplings @xmath53 and @xmath54 meet but we do not enforce unification of the strong coupling constant @xmath55 with @xmath56 at @xmath52 .",
    "the experimental value of the @xmath57 strong coupling constant at @xmath58 is an input in our scheme and this is related to @xmath55 through @xmath59 , where @xmath60 are the threshold corrections . enforcing unification of @xmath55 with the rest of the gauge couplings usually results in values for @xmath61 larger than the experimental values , if the two - loop rge s are used .",
    "for this reason we abandon gauge coupling unification . for the determination of the gauge couplings @xmath56 we use as inputs the electromagnetic coupling constant @xmath62 , the value of the fermi coupling constant @xmath63 , and the @xmath64-boson mass @xmath58 . from these",
    "we determine the weak mixing angle through the relation @xmath65 .",
    "the value of the electromagnetic coupling constant at @xmath58 in the @xmath51 scheme is calculated through @xmath66 , where @xmath67 are the appropriate threshold corrections ( for details see ref .",
    "@xcite ) . in each iteration @xmath68 and @xmath69 are extracted and from these the values of @xmath56 at @xmath58 are determined . in the equations above",
    "all hatted quantities are meant to be in the @xmath51 scheme .",
    "our remaining inputs , in running the rge s , are as usual the soft susy breaking parameters @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath70 , @xmath21 and the sign of the parameter @xmath29 .",
    "the top and tau physical masses , @xmath71 , as well as the @xmath72 bottom running mass @xmath73 are also inputs .",
    "the default values for the aforementioned masses are @xmath74 and @xmath75 . for the determination of the bottom and tau running masses , and",
    "hence their corresponding yukawa couplings , at the scale @xmath58 , we run @xmath76 rge s using three - loop rge s for the strong coupling constant .",
    "we also include two - loop contributions in the electromagnetic coupling and mixings of the electromagnetic with the strong coupling constant .",
    "the latter is as important as the three - loop strong coupling constant contribution to the rge s . at the end of the running @xmath77 masses",
    "are converted to @xmath78 in the usual way .",
    "this determines the bottom and tau yukawa couplings at @xmath58 .",
    "we recall that the corrections to the bottom yukawa coupling of eq .",
    "( [ arnow ] ) should be duly taken into account .",
    "for the determination of the top yukawa coupling at @xmath79 we take into account all dominant corrections relating the pole to its running mass . by running the rge s we can have the top yukawa coupling at @xmath58 .",
    "thus our analysis resembles that followed in ref .",
    "@xcite .    for the determination of the higgs and higgsino mixing parameters , @xmath31 and @xmath29",
    ", we solve the minimization conditions with the one - loop corrected effective potential in which all particle contributions are taken into account .",
    "the minimization is performed using as reference scale the average stop scale @xmath32 .",
    "thus in each run we determine @xmath80 .    regarding the calculation of the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) relic abundance , the boltzmann equation is solved numerically using the machinery outlined in ref .",
    "the coannihilation effects in regions where the right - handed stau , @xmath81 , approaches in mass the lsp , are properly taken into account .",
    "caution should be taken in regions where the ratio @xmath49 is close to unity .",
    "this signals the vicinity of a pole in which case the traditional non - relativistic expansion breaks down . on the pole",
    "the annihilation cross section through the pseudo - scalar higgs @xmath3-channel exchange is large and its width is important in determining its size .",
    "the rescaled pseudo - scalar higgs boson width is @xmath82 , that is resembles that of the @xmath64-boson , and hence for values of the ratio @xmath49 larger than about 1.2 ( see @xcite ) we are away from the pole region .",
    "we have found that in the @xmath22 plane , and for both parameters less than @xmath83 , this ratio approaches unity only for very large values of @xmath0 .",
    "for such values of @xmath84 the pseudo - scalar higgs dominates the @xmath14 pair annihilation , leading to large cross sections and therefore cosmologically acceptable relic densities .",
    "thus cosmologically allowed @xmath22 corridors open up for @xmath0 which were absent for lower values of @xmath21 .",
    "these are the same corridors observed in the analysis of ref .",
    "@xcite which however show up for lower values of @xmath21 .    in the panels shown in figure  [ fig2 ] we display our results by drawing the cosmologically allowed region @xmath85 ( dark green ) in the @xmath22 plane for values of @xmath21 equal to @xmath86 , @xmath87 , @xmath88 and @xmath89 respectively .",
    "also drawn ( light green ) is the region @xmath90 . in the figures",
    "shown the default values for the top , tau and bottom masses are assumed .",
    "the remaining inputs are shown on the top of each panel .",
    "the solid red mark the region within which the supersymmetric contribution to the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon falls within the e821 range @xmath91 .",
    "the dashed red line marks the boundary of the region when the more relaxed lower bound @xmath92 is used @xcite , corresponding to the @xmath93 lower bound of the e821 range . along the blue dashed - dotted lines",
    "the light @xmath16-even higgs mass takes values @xmath94 ( left ) and @xmath95 ( right ) respectively . the line on the left marks therefore the recent lep bound on the higgs mass @xcite .",
    "also shown is the chargino mass bound @xmath96   and hence they are not favoured by the @xmath97 data . ] . the shaded area ( in red ) at the bottom of each figure , labelled by th , is theoretically disallowed since the light stau is lighter than the lightest of the neutralinos . from the displayed figures we observe that for values of @xmath21 up to @xmath88 the cosmological data put an upper bound on the parameter @xmath1 .",
    "however , there is practically no such upper bound for the parameter @xmath2 , due to the coannihilation effects @xcite which allow for @xmath98 as large as @xmath99 within the narrow coannihilation band lying above the theoretically disallowed region . for @xmath100",
    "a large region opens up within which the relic density is cosmologically allowed .",
    "this is due to the pair annihilation of the neutralinos through the pseudo - scalar higgs exchange in the @xmath3-channel . as explained before , for such high @xmath21 the ratio @xmath101 approaches unity and the pseudo - scalar exchange dominates yielding large cross sections and hence small neutralino relic densities . in this case",
    "the lower bound put by the @xmath19 data cuts the cosmologically allowed region which would otherwise allow for very large values of @xmath22 .",
    "the importance of these corridors has been stressed in the analysis of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "however , in our case these show up at much higher values of the parameter @xmath21 .",
    "we should remark at this point that in our analysis we use the value of @xmath102 as input and relax unification of the @xmath103 gauge coupling with the others . for reasons already explained , in the constrained scenario it is almost impossible to reconcile gauge coupling unification with a value for @xmath102 consistent with experiment due to the low energy threshold effects .",
    "this change affects drastically the values of other parameters and especially that of the higgsino ( @xmath29 ) and higgs ( @xmath31 ) mixing parameters that in turn affect the pseudo - scalar higgs boson mass which plays a dominant role . for the @xmath104 case , close the highest possible value , and considering the conservative lower bound on the muon s anomalous magnetic moment @xmath105 and values of @xmath13 in the range @xmath106 , we find that the point with the highest value of @xmath1 is ( in gev ) at @xmath107 and that with the highest value of @xmath2 is at @xmath108 .",
    "the latter marks the lower end of the line segment of the boundary @xmath109 which amputates the cosmologically allowed stripe . for the case displayed in the bottom right panel of the figure [ fig2 ] the upper mass limits put on the lsp , and",
    "the lightest of the charginos , stops and the staus are @xmath110 ( in @xmath111 ) .",
    "allowing for @xmath112 values , the upper bounds put on @xmath22 increase a little and so do the aforementioned bounds on the sparticle masses .",
    "thus it appears that the prospects of discovering cmssm at a @xmath113 collider with center of mass energy @xmath114 , such as tesla , are not guaranteed .",
    "however in the allowed regions the next to the lightest neutralino , @xmath115 , has a mass very close to the lightest of the charginos and hence the process @xmath116 , with @xmath115 subsequently decaying to @xmath117 or @xmath118 , is kinematically allowed for such large @xmath21 , provided the energy is increased to at least @xmath119 .",
    "it should be noted however that this channel proceeds via the @xmath120-channel exchange of a selectron is suppressed due to the heaviness of the exchanged sfermion",
    ".    the situation changes , however , when the strict e821 limits are imposed @xmath121 .",
    "for instance in the @xmath104 case displayed in figure [ fig2 ] there is no cosmologically allowed region which obeys this bound . for the other cases , @xmath122 ,",
    "the maximum allowed @xmath2 is about @xmath123 , occurring at @xmath124 , and the maximum @xmath1 is @xmath125 when @xmath126 .",
    "the upper limits on the masses of the sparticles quoted previously reduce to @xmath127 all in gev . however , these values refer to the limiting case @xmath128 . scanning the parameter space allowing also for @xmath112 we obtain the upper limits displayed in the table  [ table1 ] . in this",
    "the unbracketed values correspond to the e821 limits on the @xmath19 . for completeness we also display , within brackets , the bounds obtained when the weaker lower bound @xmath105 is imposed .",
    "we see that even at tesla with center of mass energy @xmath129 , the prospects of discovering cmssm are guaranteed in the @xmath130 if the e821 bounds are imposed .    in the figure [ fig3 ] we display in the @xmath131 plane the points which are consistent both with the muon s anomalous magnetic moment bounds mentioned before and cosmology , as well as with the other accelerators data .",
    "each of the points is taken from a sample of 40,000 random points in the part of the parameter space defined by @xmath132 , @xmath133 , @xmath134 and @xmath135 .",
    "all the points are consistent with the cosmological bound @xmath136 .",
    "the plus points ( colored in blue ) are those consistent with the e821 bound @xmath137 , while the diamonds ( colored in green ) are consistent with the more relaxed bound @xmath138 .",
    "the points are grouped in regions , separated by dashed contours , each of which constitutes the boundary of @xmath21 with the value shown beneath . in the region",
    "designated as @xmath104 all points have @xmath139 .",
    "it is seen clearly that only a few points in the @xmath0 case can survive the e821 bound . for @xmath122",
    "the parameter @xmath2 can not be larger than about @xmath140 , attaining its maximum value at @xmath141 , and the maximum @xmath1 is @xmath142 occurring at @xmath143 .",
    "the upper limits put on @xmath22 result to the sparticle mass bounds displayed in the table  [ table1 ] .",
    "in this work we have undertaken the problem of calculating the neutralino relic density in the framework of the cmssm , by paying special attention to the pseudo - scalar higgs exchange mechanism which is dominant in the large @xmath21 region . imposing the bounds @xmath91 on the muon s anomalous magnetic moment , put by the bnl e821 experiment , in combination with the cosmological data @xmath144 ,",
    "severely restricts the sparticle spectrum .",
    "we found that the pseudo - scalar higgs exchange mechanism opens cosmologically allowed corridors , of high @xmath22 , only for very large @xmath0 , which , however , have little overlap with the regions allowed by the e821 data .",
    "in fact only a few isolated points in the parameter space with @xmath0 can survive the restrictions imposed by both data .",
    "the bounds put on the sparticle spectrum can guarantee that in lhc but also in a @xmath7 linear collider with center of mass energy @xmath8 , such as tesla , cmssm can be discovered .",
    "the guarantee for a tesla machine with this energy is lost in a charged sparticle final state channel , if the lower bound on the value of @xmath145 is lowered to its @xmath146 value , but not for the lhc . in this case only by increasing the center of mass energy to be @xmath147 , a @xmath7 linear collider can find cmssm in @xmath148 or @xmath149 channels .    * acknowledgements * + a.b.l .",
