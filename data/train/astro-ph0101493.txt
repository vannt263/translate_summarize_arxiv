    "a couple of new uranus satellites , named sycorax ( s/1997 u1 ) and caliban ( s/1997 u2 ) , with an orbital semimajor axis of 253 and 305 uranian radii , respectively , were discovered in 1997 by gladman et.al .",
    "this solved the apparent uranus _ peculiarity _ known up to that time to be the only giant planet in the solar system without irregular satellites , despite accurate search carried out in the past ( christie @xcite , kuiper @xcite , smith @xcite , cruikshank & brown @xcite ) .",
    "giant gaseous planets are characterized by a complex system of dust rings and satellites . from the point of view of orbital dynamics",
    ", the satellites of the giant gaseous planets belong to two classes : regular and irregular .",
    "the former are characterized by orbits with a small eccentricity , very close to the planet equatorial plane and always show a prograde motion .",
    "the latter follow orbits which may have a large ellipticity , semimajor axis , and inclination . moreover they may follow both prograde and retrograde motions . according to pollack et al .",
    "@xcite the two classes of satellites suggest a quite different evolution .",
    "regular satellites are supposed to be born in the same subnebula from which the planet originated . on the other hand irregular satellites",
    "might be planetesimals felt inside the planet subnebula by gas drag just before the subnebula collapse .",
    "eventually the captured planetesimals were fragmented by dynamical pressure due to the gas drag and were dispersed by collisions with other objects already present in the subnebula ( pollack et al .",
    "@xcite ) . following this scheme ,",
    "it is evident that the study of irregular satellites is important in the context of the solar system origin .",
    "in particular , it could be interesting to compare the newly discovered uranian irregular satellites with other classes of minor bodies in the outer solar system , i.e. kuiper belt and centaurus objects .",
    "the faintness of the new satellites ( gladman et al .",
    "@xcite report @xmath0  mag , @xmath1mag ) made it difficult to determine their photometric properties .",
    "colors are reported by gladman et al .",
    "@xcite with 0.1 mag accuracy , suggesting that sycorax and caliban are reddened with respect to the sun , in contrast with uranus and its regular satellites .",
    "moreover , the low photometric accuracy ( @xmath2  mag ) prevented them from obtaining a light - curve and hence an estimate of the rotation period for both satellites .    to improve the present knowledge , sycorax and",
    "caliban has been observed with the ntt eso telescope .",
    "we obtained magnitudes in the b , v , r , i bands with accuracy of 0.03 mag and we obtain color and light - curves .    the paper is organized as follows : section 2 describes the data acquisition and reduction , section 3 the colors , and section 4 the light curve .",
    "final remarks and conclusions are given in section 5 .",
    "observations were conducted at la silla on 1999 october 8 and 9 , using the tektronix 2024@xmath3 2024 pixel ccd @xmath4 36 mounted in the red emmi arm of the 3.6-m eso ntt telescope .",
    "the first night was photometric with an average seeing of 1.0 arcsec , whereas the second one was not photometric .",
    "the scale on the chip is 0.27 arcsec per pixel , and the array covers about 9@xmath39 arcmin@xmath5 in the sky .",
    "details of the observing run for the two satellites are given in tables [ tab : sycorax : journal ] and [ tab : caliban : journal ] .",
    "pre - processing , which includes bias and flat - field corrections , has been done by using standard routines in the eso midas package .",
    "instrumental magnitudes have been extracted at the padova university using the daophot and accompanying allstar package ( stetson @xcite ) in the midas environment .",
    "the errors in tables [ tab : sycorax : journal ] and [ tab : caliban : journal ] are assumed to be normally distributed and are 1@xmath6 .    the instrumental @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 have been transformed into standard jonhson @xmath11 , @xmath12 and cousin @xmath13 and @xmath14 magnitudes using fitting coefficients ( colour term and zero point ) derived from observations of the standard field t - phoenix and marka stars from landolt ( 1992 ) at the beginning and the end of the night , after including exposure time normalization and airmass corrections .",
    "aperture correction has also been applied .",
    "the transformations are given by the following equations :    @xmath15    and are plotted in fig .",
    "1 . the errors affecting this calibration",
    "are expected to be of the order of 0.03 mag .",
    "all the magnitudes obtained in the second night were translated into the first night through the comparison of a group of common field stars in the same frames of the satellites .",
    "the observations allowed us to obtain the colors of both satellites with an excellent accuracy and we reported them in table [ tab : colours ]  together with corresponding error bars .",
    "the colors are almost similar for both satellites , even if sycorax appears to be bluer than caliban looking at ( b - v ) , and we can make a comparison with other minor bodies of the solar system .",
    "they clearly appear less red than most of the kuiper belt objects as it can be seen on the histogram of v - r reported by luu & jewit @xcite , while there is an interesting similarity with some centaurs , 1995 go , 1997 cu@xmath16 and 1995 dw@xmath17 , as it is well shown in the table v of davies et al . @xcite .    however , it is difficult to provide even a rough interpretation of the colors measured for sycorax and caliban .",
    "looking at the histograms of luu & jewitt @xcite the v - r values of the satellites could be considered as the bluest kuiper belt objects or the reddest near earth asteroids , not neglecting that 0.5 is the value found for most of the comet nuclei and the trojans .",
    "the small number of centaurus observed up to now shows a broad range of v - r values and it might be too much easy to associate sycorax and caliban to this group , even if the heliocentric distance of uranus is closer to their semi - major axis .",
    "light - curves have been obtained in the r band with exposure times of 600 - 800 sec for caliban , 80 - 200 sec for sycorax .",
    "the time dependent part of the light curves together with a sinusoidal fit described below , are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] .",
    "the first night only has been photometric , but for both satellites the first night alone is not sufficient to say anything of conclusive about the time variability even applying simple models .",
    "so the data of the second night have been translated to the first night by matching the magnitude of common stars in the frames .",
    "the chosen stars do not exhibit significant brightness variations , however this procedure may left some residual systematic calibration error within a @xmath18  level ( @xmath19  mag ) equivalent to a shift in the zero point of the magnitude scale for the second night relatively to the scale of the first night . since data generally are not evenly distributed about the mean ,",
    "it is not possible to remove this shift , subtracting from the data of each night their average . as a consequence ,",
    "a possible small shift in the zero point of the magnitude scale between different nights must be accounted for by the fit itself adding a further degree of freedom to the model .",
    "so the fit is : @xmath20    whose four free parameters are : the average magnitude @xmath21 , the amplitude @xmath22 , the period @xmath23 , and the phase @xmath24 .",
    "the origin of time @xmath25  is assumed to be october 8 , 2000 at ut 00:00 .",
    "the step function @xmath26  is null during the first night and + 1 during the second one .",
    "the free parameter @xmath27  accounts for the possible shift in the zero point between the two nights .",
    "if this is the case , @xmath27  will assume values significantly different from zero .",
    "the fit is performed twice by weighted least squares .",
    "the first time imposing @xmath28  and the second time leaving it as a fifth free parameter .",
    "the results of the two fits are then compared . as shown below sycorax data",
    "requires a significant shift between the first and the second night , while caliban does not . in principle",
    "more sophisticated methods could be used , but our limited data set does not justify their application . as a consequences the lightcurve parameters , and particularly their periods , shall be considered just as indicative estimates rather than firm results .    in the first night caliban does not display a large variation ( @xmath29 mag , i.e. less than 2 @xmath6 ) , while in the second one it shows @xmath30  mag , corresponding to a @xmath31  level .",
    "the first concern was to verify whether such variability may be explained by random fluctuations due to noise or not .",
    "the @xmath32  test rejected the hypothesis of random fluctuations .",
    "in fact taking into account the data of both nights , the significativity level for this hypothesis is less than @xmath33 . in the case of caliban",
    "no significant shift is required between the magnitude zero points of first and second nights .",
    "leaving the shift @xmath27  as a free parameter does not improve the fit , but it reduces the number of degrees of freedom and so the significativity level for the fit .",
    "then we imposed @xmath28  obtaining the best fit for @xmath34  hours , @xmath35  rad , @xmath36  mag , @xmath37  mag , with @xmath38 equivalent to a significativity level @xmath39 .",
    "indeed most of the information in this estimate is based on the data of the second night . as a comparison",
    "the best fit obtained considering the second night data only is obtained for @xmath40  hours , @xmath41  rad , @xmath42  mag , @xmath43  mag , with @xmath44 equivalent to a significativity level @xmath45 .",
    "it would be noted how a better fit is obtained for the second night data than for the full data set , the worst behaving point being the last of the first night .",
    "if this point is removed we obtain @xmath46  hours , @xmath47  rad , @xmath48  mag , @xmath49  mag , with @xmath50 equivalent to a significativity level @xmath51 .",
    "this fact suggests either a residual mismatch in the zero point calibration between the two nights or that the light curve is not properly represented by a sinusoidal time dependence .",
    "however it is not possible to discriminate between these two possibilities from the data as none of the related ccd frames display evident peculiarities .",
    "so the difference between the two results will be regarded as an estimate of the systematic errors in the light curve parameters determination .    in conclusion",
    "our best estimates are : @xmath52  hours , @xmath53  rad , @xmath54  mag , @xmath55  mag . where the first error refers to the systematic error and the second to the random ( @xmath18 ) error .",
    "for sycorax , we had more data , better distributed in time than for caliban , but relatively to the errors the photometric variation was smaller .",
    "the first night sycorax displayed @xmath56  mag , while in the second one @xmath57 mag , both below @xmath58 level .",
    "so we can not claim for a safe positive detection of significant brightness variation in the sycorax data , and any attempt to estimate a period would be considered as tentative , although during the second night the data hinted at a possible _ sinusoidal _ variation .",
    "indeed , the hypothesis of random fluctuation over a time constant brightness as an explanation of the observed light curve , fits sycorax data better than caliban ones , but the significativity level for such a fit is only @xmath59 , making this hypothesis hard to support . moreover , the r magnitudes for the reference stars in the sycorax frames for the first night are stable , with an rms better than @xmath60  mag and a significativity level for the hypothesis of a constant magnitude better than 99.99% . both these observations support ( but do not proof ) the hypothesis that the detected variability in sycorax data could be physically significant .",
    "so we applied the sinusoidal fit shown in fig .",
    "2 .    in the case of sycorax",
    "a not null shift @xmath61  mag shall be allowed in order to have a good fit , which is consistent with the average photometrical error of the tabulated measures @xmath62  mag . on the contrary",
    "the imposition of @xmath28  reduces the significativity level for the fit of about a factor three . apart from the method described here , we attempted different ways to get rid of this shift , all producing similar results about the estimate of the period , phase and amplitude for the light curve .",
    "our conclusion is that the shift must be considered as a relevant parameter in what regard the minimization of @xmath32  only . of course , since it affects in the same way all the data taken in the same night , the shift is not relevant for the colour determination , since colours are obtained by neighbor data .    taking the data of both nights into account ,",
    "the best fit was obtained for @xmath63  hours , @xmath64  radians , @xmath65  mag , @xmath66  mag with a @xmath67  and @xmath68 .",
    "this represents our best guess for the sycorax period .",
    "the repetition of the fit using the second night data only gives instead @xmath69  hours , @xmath70  radians , @xmath71  mag , with a @xmath72  and @xmath73 .",
    "note that @xmath22  is not affected by the change which instead affects period and phase .",
    "in addition the significativity is higher when all the data are used to perform the fit , suggesting that all the data have the same statistical significance . at last @xmath21  from the second night data",
    "only is : @xmath74  mag whose difference from the @xmath21  obtained from the full night is dominated by @xmath27 .",
    "after correction of this shift and adding in square the two random errors we obtain : @xmath75  mag . in conclusion for sycorax : @xmath76  hours , @xmath77  radians , @xmath78  mag , @xmath79  mag .",
    "in the nights between october 8 and 9 , 1999 we carried out accurate multicolor observations of uranus irregular satellites sycorax ( s/1997 u1 ) and caliban ( s/1997 u2 ) , providing magnitudes in b , v , r , i bands .",
    "the colors we obtained confirm the values suggested by gladman et al .",
    "@xcite . they are redder than uranus and its regular satellites , and sycorax appears to be bluer than caliban and most of the kuiper belt objects .",
    "we obtained light - curves in the r band for both satellites , and we estimated periods and amplitudes by fitting the data with a sinusoid .",
    "caliban s light curve displayed significant fluctuations ( 5@xmath6 ) , which were not evident in the sycorax data .",
    "for caliban , we suggest a light curve period of about @xmath80  hour with an amplitude of about @xmath81  mag , which is compatible with the rotation periods of the kuiper - belt objects ( romanishin & tegler @xcite ) . however , the limited number of points and time coverage coupled with calibration uncertainties , suggest to be conservative and to consider this result just as a first estimate requiring further observations to be confirmed .",
    "although the data for sycorax did not show a so large photometric variation , we tentatively provide an estimate of the light - curve period and amplitude , which also has to be considered preliminary , amounting at about @xmath82  hours and @xmath83  mag respectively .",
    "better time coverage together with very accurate photometry may help to unravel a safer light - curve period for sycorax .",
