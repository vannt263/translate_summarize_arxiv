    "relationship between empiric equations of heat conduction ( fourier law ) and microstructure of solid dielectrics is known to be one of the oldest and most elusive unsolved problems in solid state physics @xcite .",
    "the classic solution for the problem suggested by peierls @xcite was questioned after seminal numeric experiment of fermi , pasta and ulam @xcite ; the latter has disproved common belief concerning fast thermalization and mixing in non - integrable systems with weak nonlinearity . despite large amount of work done , necessary and sufficient conditions for microscopic model of solid to obey macroscopically the fourier law with finite and size  independent heat conduction coefficient @xcite are not known yet .",
    "numerous anomalies in the heat transfer in microscopic models of dielectrics were revealed by means of direct numeric simulation over recent years , including qualitatively different behavior of models of different types ( with and without on - site potential ) and dimensionality @xcite . to date , it is believed that in one dimension the microscopic models with conserved momentum the heat conduction coefficient diverges in the thermodynamic limit ( as the chain length n goes to infinity ) as @xmath2 with @xmath3 varying in the interval @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "the only known exception with convergent heat conduction coefficient is the chain of coupled rotators @xcite .",
    "as for the models without the moment conservation , their heat conduction is convergent @xcite , with exception of integrable models @xcite . in two dimensions ,",
    "the divergence still exists @xcite , although is reported to be of logarithmic rather than power - like type .",
    "it is believed that in three dimensions the heat conduction coefficient will converge , although some alternative data exist @xcite .",
    "vast majority of results obtained to date in the field of microscopic foundations of the heat conduction dealt with stationary problem , with steady heat flux under constant thermal gradient . in all these cases",
    "the macroscopic law to be checked was standard fourier law of heat conduction .",
    "however , it is well - known that due to its parabolic character it implies infinite speed of the signal propagation and thus should be modified if very large gradients or extremely small scales are involved @xcite . on macroscopic level , numerous modifications were suggested to recover the hyperbolic character of the heat transport equation @xcite . perhaps , the most known is the lowest ",
    "order approximation known as cattaneo - vernotte ( cv ) or telegraphist ( te ) law @xcite .",
    "it is written as @xmath5 where @xmath6 is standard heat conduction coefficient and @xmath7 is characteristic relaxation time of the system , @xmath8 is the vector of heat flux and @xmath9 is the temperature .",
    "the relaxation time is rather short for majority of materials ( @xmath10 s at room temperature ) , but can be of order 1 s , for instance in some biological tissues @xcite .",
    "modifications of the fourier law bring about new observable physical phenomena , such as temperature waves or the second sound @xcite .",
    "importance of the hyperbolic heat conduction models for description of a nanoscale heat transfer has been recognized in recent experiments @xcite .    only few papers dealt with microscopic foundations of non - fourier heat conduction laws from the first principles or by its numeric investigation in the microscopic models @xcite .",
    "these works confirm that the non - fourier effects may be very significant if large space gradients or fast changes of the temperature are involved .    in recent paper",
    "@xcite an attempt was made to relate the structure and parameters of microscopic models with conserved momentum to empiric description of the non - fourier heat conduction . for this sake , two models belonging to different universality classes with respect to the stationary heat conduction were studied : the @xmath11-fpu chain and the chain of rotators .",
    "oscillatory behavior of the decaying temperature disturbance , compatible only with hyperbolic macroscopic equation of the thermal transport , has been revealed in both models .",
    "the cv equation of the heat transport adequately describes the behavior of the chain of rotators , besides the region of crossover between the `` hyperbolic '' and the `` parabolic '' behavior .",
    "however , the @xmath11-fpu model does not obey the cv equation .",
    "this paper continues the line of research started in @xcite and investigates the relationship between structure , parameters and macroscopic description of the nonstationary heat transfer in models with on - site potential .",
    "such models are known to have the normal heat conduction @xcite .",
    "we are going to check ( a ) whether the effects of hyperbolicity can be observed in such models ; ( b ) whether the thermal transport in these models can be described by linear equations and ( c ) whether the lowest  order cv equation is suitable for description of these phenomena .",
    "the stationary heat transfer is characterized by single coefficient of the heat ( or thermal ) conductivity . in numeric experiments",
    "it is measured either by direct simulation of the stationary flux under constant temperature gradient , or from autocorrelation of the heat flux in isolated system via green - kubo formula @xcite .",
    "the non - stationary conduction involves at least two parameters ( cv equation ) or even more in more advanced models .",
    "moreover , one should not bind himself by a priori selection of the empiric equation to fit the results .",
    "then , it is desirable to find the characteristics of the process which can be measured directly from the numeric data and are not related to specific choice of the macroscopic empiric equation .",
    "one such choice may be observation of the temperature waves ( the second sound ) , implemented , for instance , in papers @xcite .",
    "we adopt more general approach , based on relaxation profiles of different spatial modes of the temperature field . this approach is related to early numeric simulations on the non - stationary heat conduction in argon crystals @xcite and of thermal conductivity in superlattices @xcite .    in order to illustrate the approach ,",
    "let us refer to 1d version of the cv equation for temperature : @xmath12    where @xmath13 is the temperature conduction coefficient .    to solve this equation ,",
    "let us consider the problem of non - stationary heat conduction in a one - dimensional specimen with periodic boundary conditions @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the temperature distribution , @xmath16 is the length of the specimen , @xmath17 .",
    "if it is the case , one can expand the temperature distribution into fourier series : @xmath18 with @xmath19 , since @xmath15 should be real , @xmath20 is the modal number .    substituting ( [ f3 ] ) to ( [ f2 ] ) , one obtains the equations for time evolution of the modal amplitudes : @xmath21    solutions of eq .",
    "( [ f4 ] ) are written as : @xmath22 where @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 are constants determined by the initial distribution .    from ( [ f5 ] )",
    "it immediately follows that for sufficiently short modes the temperature profile will relax in oscillatory manner : @xmath26 where @xmath27 , @xmath28 .",
    "if the specimen is rather long ( @xmath29 ) then for small wavenumbers ( acoustical modes ) : @xmath30 the first eigenvalue describes fast initial transient relaxation , and the second one corresponds to stationary slow diffusion and , quite naturally , does not depend on @xmath7 .",
    "this limit corresponds to fourier heat conduction .",
    "so , we can conclude that there exists a critical length of the mode @xmath31 which separates between two different types of the relaxation : oscillatory and diffusive .",
    "the oscillatory behavior is naturally related to the hyperbolicity of the system and is qualitatively inconsistent with the fourier law . here",
    "the critical scale is derived from the cv equation ; however , it is clear that this scale , if it exists , can be revealed from numeric data without relying on any particular macroscopic description .",
    "moreover , this critical scale and its dependence on the temperature and other parameters of the model help to understand how significant are the deviations from parabolicity in given model .",
    "in particular , if the size of the system is less than this critical mode length , the fourier law can not be used at all .",
    "careful analysis of the relaxation profiles for different modes of the temperature perturbations also can give rather important insights .",
    "for instance , equation ( [ f6 ] ) predicts that all oscillatory modes will decay with the same decrement related to unique relaxation time .",
    "one can verify this prediction by comparison with the numeric data and thus to evaluate the accuracy of the cv equation for particular model .    in order to measure the critical size @xmath32",

    "boundary conditions are adopted to be periodic .    in order to obtain the initial nonequilibrium temperature distribution ,",
    "all particles in the chain were initially connected to common langevin thermostats .",
    "for this sake , the following system of equations was simulated : @xmath42 where @xmath3 is the damping coefficient and the white noise @xmath43 is normalized by the following conditions : @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the prescribed temperature of the @xmath35-th particle .    in order to study the relaxation of different spatial modes of the initial temperature distribution , its profile has been prescribed as @xmath46,\\ ] ] where @xmath47 is the average temperature , @xmath48 is the amplitude of the perturbation , and @xmath49 is the length of the mode ( number of particles ) .",
    "the overall length of the chain @xmath50 has to be multiple of @xmath49 in order to ensure the periodic boundary conditions .",
    "after the initial heating in accordance with ( [ f12 ] ) , the langevin thermostat was removed and relaxation of the isolated system to a stationary temperature profile is studied .",
    "the results were averaged over about @xmath51 realizations of the initial profile @xmath52 in order to reduce the effect of fluctuations .    in this paper , we analyze three models with linear nearest - neighbor interaction , which differ by the shape of the on - site potential .",

    "[ fig2 ] demonstrate that all three investigated models with the on - site potential clearly exhibit similar transition from diffusive to oscillatory decay pattern as the characteristic wavelength decreases .",
    "it is possible to distinguish qualitatively three different relaxation patterns : diffusive ( curves with @xmath71 ) , oscillatory ( curves with @xmath64 , 1 ) and crossover ( curves with @xmath72 ) . in other terms , for all these models there exists the critical wavelength scale @xmath73 which separates the oscillatory from the diffusive decay . for the simulations presented here",
    "this characteristic scale is @xmath74    thus , already at this step one can conclude that the `` hyperbolic '' behavior can be observed in all three models .",
    "the wide range obtained in ( [ f17 ] ) is due to relatively small chain length ; this simulation is sufficient to reveal the existence of transition between the decay patterns , but not sufficient for more or less exact estimation of the critical wavelength scale .",

    "[ fig2 ] were obtained for different values of the average temperature of the system .",
    "thus , one can conjecture that @xmath73 should be dependent on the temperature  similar observation was made also for the models with conserved momentum @xcite .",
    "to verify this conjecture , we have performed more exact measurements of @xmath73 ( for longer chains , up to 10000 particles , and with higher resolution ) for all three models .",

    "quite similar results were obtained also for @xmath0- chain and @xmath0 + chains and are omitted for the sake of brevity .",
