    "the strong cp problem remains one of the puzzling points of the modern particle physics ( for a review , see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite ) . it is related to the p- and cp- violating term @xmath7 in the qcd lagrangian which is contributed also by the complex phases in the quark mass matrices @xmath8 , so that its effective value becomes @xmath9 .",
    "the cp - violating phenomena in weak interactions indicate that the cp - violating phase in the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix is large , and hence the quark mass matrices should contain large complex phases .",
    "therefore , one would generally expect that @xmath10 is order 1 .",
    "however , the experimental bound on the neutron electric dipole moment yields @xmath11 . the strong cp problem",
    "simply questions why the effective @xmath10-term is so small , or in other words , what is the origin of such a strong fine tuning between the initial value @xmath0 and the phases of the quark mass matrices ?",
    "the most appealing solution to the problem is provided by the peccei - quinn ( pq ) mechanism @xcite , based on the concept of spontaneously broken global axial symmetry @xmath12 . in the context of this mechanism",
    "@xmath10 essentially becomes a dynamical field , @xmath13 , with an effective potential induced by the non - perturbative qcd effects which fixes vacuum expectation value ( vev ) at zero . here",
    "@xmath14 stands for the pseudo - goldstone mode of the spontaneously broken pq symmetry , an axion , and @xmath15 is a vev of scalar ( or a vev combination of several scalars ) responsible for the @xmath12 symmetry breaking . this scale is model dependent . in particular , in the original weinberg - wilczek ( ww ) model @xcite @xmath15 is order electroweak scale , but in the invisible axion models @xcite it should be much larger .    in the most general context ,",
    "the axion couplings to fermions and photons are described by the following lagrangian terms : @xmath16 where the coupling constants are essentially determined by the pq scale @xmath15 . typically , up to model dependent order one coefficients , we have @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the fermion mass ( e.g. @xmath19 for electron , nucleons , etc . ) , and @xmath20 , with @xmath21 being the fine structure constant .    as for the axion mass",
    ", it also depends on the qcd scale @xmath22 where strong interactions become nonperturbative . in the theory with no light quarks ( with masses below @xmath22 )",
    ", the axion mass would emerge due to instanton - induced potential which can be computed in the dilute gas approximation , @xmath23 with @xmath24 , and so we would have @xmath25 .",
    "however , in reality the axion state @xmath14 gets small mixing with the pseudo - goldstone bosons @xmath26 , etc . , related to the chiral symmetry breaking by the light quark condensates @xmath27 . in order to find the true mass eigenvalue corresponding to the axion",
    ", the total mass matrix should be diagonalized . in doing so",
    ", one finds a general expression @xcite : @xmath28 where @xmath29 stands for the color anomaly of @xmath12 current , .",
    "hence , in the ww model we have @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the number of fermion families .",
    "the same holds in the dine - fischler - srednicki - zhitnitskii ( dfsz ) model @xcite .",
    "other models of the invisible axion , e.g. the hadronic axion @xcite or archion @xcite , generally contain some exotic fermions and so @xmath32 . ] and @xmath33 is a mass matrix of light quarks , with @xmath34 .",
    "thus , the axion mass is given as @xmath35 .",
    "more precisely , neglecting the @xmath36-quark contribution and using the relation @xmath37 , from ( [ b ] ) one directly arrives to the more familiar formula : @xmath38 where @xmath39 , and @xmath40 respectively are the pion mass and decay constant .    in the ww model",
    "@xcite the pq symmetry is broken by two higgs doublets @xmath41 with the vevs @xmath42 , namely @xmath43 , where @xmath44 gev is the electroweak scale and @xmath45 .",
    "therefore , the ww axion is quite heavy , and its mass can vary from few hundred kev to several mevs : @xmath46 however , its couplings to fermions and photon are too strong and by this reason the ww model is completely ruled out for any values of the parameter @xmath47 by a variety of the terrestrial experiments as are the search of the decay @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 decays into @xmath51 , nuclear deexcitations via axion emission , the reactor and beam dump experiments , etc . @xcite .    for a generic invisible axion ,",
    "these experimental data imply a lower bound @xmath52 gev or so , which leads to the upper limit on @xmath53 of about 1 kev .",
    "however , for an axion being so light , the stringent bounds emerge from astrophysics and cosmology .",
    "in particular , for the dfsz model the combined limits from the stellar evolution and the supernova neutrino signal exclude all scales @xmath15 up to @xmath54 gev @xcite , which in turn implies @xmath55 ev .",
    "gev and so the axion mass of few ev can be also permitted .",
    "] on the other hand , the cosmological limits related to the primordial oscillations of the axion field or to the non - thermal axion production by cosmic strings , demand the upper bound @xmath56 gev @xcite .",
    "thus , not much parameter space remains available .",
    "in addition , the invisible axion models have a naturality problem related to the planck scale induced terms .",
    "many arguments suggest that the non - perturbative quantum gravity effects do not respect the global symmetries @xcite and thus they can induce the higher order effective operators cutoff by @xmath57 which explicitly violate the pq symmetry .",
    "for large @xmath15 these explicit terms can be very dangerous for the stability of the pq mechanism .",
    "for example , in the dfsz model where @xmath12 is broken by a gauge singlet scalar @xmath58 , the operator @xmath59 would induce @xmath60 unless @xmath61 gev @xcite .",
    "therefore , the planck scale induced effects leave no room for the invisible axion models . on the other hand",
    ", the ww model does not have this problem and neither it is sensitive to astrophysical constraints , but it is excluded by the laboratory limits because of too strong couplings with the matter .    in the present paper",
    "we suggest a new model for the axion .",
    "we assume that there exists a parallel sector of `` mirror '' particles @xcite which is completely analogous to the ordinary particle sector , i.e. it has the same gauge group and all coupling constants are equal in two sectors . in other words ,",
    "the whole lagrangian is invariant with respect a discrete mirror parity ( m - parity ) under the exchange of two sectors .",
    "we further assume that the ordinary and mirror worlds have the common pq symmetry realized _  la _ weinberg - wilczek , with the @xmath12 charges carried by the ordinary higgs doublets @xmath41 and their mirror partners @xmath62 .",
    "if m - parity is an exact symmetry , then the particle physics should be exactly the same in two worlds : in particular , the initial @xmath0-terms are equal , @xmath63 , the quark mass matrices are identical , @xmath64 , the qcd scales coincide , @xmath65 , and the axion couples both qcd sectors in the same way : @xmath66 , so that their non - perturbative dynamics should produce the same contributions to the axion effective potential .",
    "clearly , in this case the strong cp - problem is simultaneously solved in both worlds  the axion vev cancels the @xmath0-terms both in the mirror and ordinary sectors .",
    "in such a realization , however , @xmath15 remains order @xmath67 gev and thus it is excluded by the same phenomenological grounds as the original ww model .    as it was suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite , the m - parity can be spontaneously broken and the electroweak symmetry breaking scale @xmath68 in the mirror sector can be larger than the ordinary one @xmath69 .",
    "this would lead to somewhat different particle physics in the mirror sector and it is not a priori clear that the strong cp - problem still can be simultaneously fixed in both sectors .",
    "however , we show below that this is just the case !",
    "the simple reason is that the softly broken m - parity leads to the vev difference between the ordinary and mirror higgs doublets , but the structure of the yukawa couplings remains the same in two sectors .    as far",
    "as @xmath12 is a common symmetry for two sectors , now the pq scale is determined by the larger vev @xmath68 , i.e. @xmath70 . the axion state @xmath14 dominanly comes from the mirror higgs doublets @xmath62 , up to small ( @xmath71 ) admixtures from the ordinary higgses @xmath41 .",
    "hence , it is a ww - like axion with respect to mirror sector , while it couples the ordinary matter as an invisible dfsz - like axion .",
    "therefore , the experimental limits on the axion search require @xmath72 gev or so .",
    "however , there are good news concernin the axion mass  for a given scale @xmath15 it appears to be much larger than the mass of the ordinary dfsz axion ( [ a - m ] ) .",
    "the reason can be briefly explained as follows .",
    "due to the larger weak scale , @xmath73 , the mirror quark masses are scaled up by a factor @xmath74 with respect to the ordinary quarks , @xmath75 . by this reason ,",
    "also the mirror qcd scale becomes somewhat larger than the ordinary one : @xmath76 @xcite .",
    "therefore , the axion potential dominantly emerges from the mirror non - perturbative dynamics and we have @xmath77 or @xmath78 ( depending on whether the mass of lightest mirror quark @xmath79 is smaller or larger than @xmath80 ) .",
    "therefore , our axion can be much heavier than the ordinary invisible axion with @xmath81 .",
    "in particular , if with increasing @xmath82 also @xmath83 grows fastly enough , our axion can maintain the weight category of the ww axion ( [ ww - mass ] ) and its mass can remain in the mev range even for @xmath52 gev .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sect .",
    "2 we present our model and show how it solves the strong cp - problem . we also compute the axion mass and its couplings to the fermions and photons . in sect .",
    "3 we confront our model with the experimental and astrophysical bounds and demonstrate that there is an allowed parameter space which can be of interest for the future experimental search .",
    "the stability of our model against the planck scale induced effects is discussed in sect .",
    "4 . finally , in sect . 5",
    ", we summarize our results .",
    "it was suggested a long time ago that there can exist a parallel ( mirror ) gauge sector of particles and interactions which is the exact copy of the visible one and it communicates the latter through the gravity and perhaps also via some other interactions .",
    "various phenomenological and astrophysical implications of this idea have been studied in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "in particular , one can consider a model based on the gauge symmetry @xmath84 where @xmath85 stands for the standard model of the ordinary particles : the quark and lepton fields @xmath86 ( @xmath87 is a family index ) and two higgs doublets @xmath41 , while @xmath88 is its mirror gauge counterpart with the analogous particle content : the fermions @xmath89 and the higgses @xmath62 .",
    "from now on all fields and quantities of the mirror sector have an apex to distinguish from the ones belonging to the ordinary one .",
    "all fermion fields @xmath90 are taken in a left - chiral basis .",
    "let us assume that the theory is invariant under the mirror parity m : @xmath91 , which interchanges all corresponding representations of @xmath92 and @xmath93 .",
    "therefore , the two sectors are described by identical lagrangians and all coupling constants ( gauge , yukawa , higgs ) have the same pattern in both of them . in particular , for the yukawa couplings @xmath94 we have @xmath95 . in addition , also the initial @xmath0-terms are equal , @xmath96 .",
    "we further assume that two sectors have a common peccei - quinn symmetry @xmath12 under which fermions @xmath97 change their phases by a factor @xmath98 and the higgses @xmath99 change phases as @xmath100",
    ". then the renormalizable higgs potential has a general form @xmath101 , where for the ordinary higgses we have : @xmath102 the mirror higgs potential @xmath103 has exactly the same pattern by m - parity : @xmath104 , and the mixing terms are : @xmath105 where the coupling constant @xmath106 should be real due to m - parity .",
    "there emerge two separate axial global symmetries , @xmath107 for ordinary sector under which @xmath108 and @xmath109 , and @xmath110 for mirror sector : @xmath111 and @xmath112 .",
    "therefore , the term @xmath113 demands that @xmath114 and thus it reduces @xmath115 to its diagonal subgroup @xmath12 . ]    the mirror parity can be spontaneously broken so that the weak interaction scales are different in two sectors @xcite .",
    "the easiest way is to introduce a real singlet scalar @xmath116 which is odd under m - parity : @xmath117 @xcite .",
    "then the following renormalizable terms can be added to the higgs potential : @xmath118 a non - zero vev @xmath119 spontaneously breaks the m - parity and induces the different effective mass@xmath120 terms for the ordinary and mirror higgses : @xmath121 and @xmath122 .",
    "therefore , the mirror vevs @xmath123 are different from the ordinary ones @xmath42 , and in general also the vev ratios @xmath124 and @xmath125 must be different in two sectors .",
    "in particular , we will be interested in a situation when @xmath126 , i.e. the weak interaction scale @xmath127 in the mirror sector is much larger than the ordinary weak scale @xmath128 gev , @xmath129 @xcite .",
    "clearly , the large hierarchy between @xmath68 and @xmath69 requires the fine tuning of the parameters in the higgs potential .",
    "we do not discuss here this question and refer the reader e.g. to ref .",
    "@xcite .    as far as the ordinary and mirror yukawa constants in ( [ sm - yuk ] ) are the same , the quark and lepton mass matrices essentially have the same form in both sectors : @xmath130 , @xmath131 , @xmath132 , @xmath133 , etc .",
    "thus , the fermion mass and mixing structure in the mirror sector should be the same as in the ordinary one , with the mirror up quark masses scaled as @xmath134 and the down quark and charged lepton masses scaled as @xmath135 , @xmath136 , where @xmath137 and @xmath138 .    at very high energies ,",
    "@xmath139 , the strong coupling constants @xmath140 and @xmath141 should be equal due to m - parity . under the renormalization group ( rg ) evolution",
    "they both evolve down in parallel ways until the energy reaches the value of mirror - top mass @xmath142 .",
    "below it @xmath143 will have a different slope than @xmath144 , and this slope will change every time below the mirror quark thresholds @xmath145 , etc .",
    ", in the evolution of @xmath144 these thresholds occur at lower scales , @xmath146 , etc . then it is very easy to determine the scale @xmath83 at which @xmath143 becomes large , once we know that for the ordinary qcd this happens at @xmath147 mev .",
    "in other words , @xmath148 becomes a function of @xmath149 , and for @xmath150 one could obtain a significant difference between the qcd scales : @xmath151 .",
    "let us consider for simplicity the case @xmath152 , which yields @xmath153 .",
    "then for the values of @xmath68 up to @xmath154 gev or so one obtains an approximate scaling low : @xmath155 where @xmath156 are the rg coefficients for the case of @xmath157 light quarks . for @xmath158 gev the mirror light quarks masses become larger than @xmath83 , since they grow faster with @xmath68 : @xmath159 , and the approximation ( [ xi ] ) is not valid  for @xmath160 the mirror qcd becomes the pure gluodynamics and hence @xmath161 starts to increase faster with @xmath68 ( see fig .",
    "1 ) .     and",
    "@xmath143 from higher to lower energies , for @xmath162 gev and @xmath163 . , width=377 ]    let us discuss now the axion physics in our model .",
    "since we are interested only in goldstone modes , let us express the neutral components of the ordinary and mirror higgs fields as : @xmath164 and identify the combination of the phases @xmath165 and @xmath166 which corresponds to the axion field .",
    "we immediately observe that the states @xmath167 and @xmath168 are the true goldstone modes eaten up respectively by the standard and mirror gauge bosons @xmath169 and @xmath170 which become massive particles by the higgs mechanism .    in the limit @xmath171 , two remaining combinations @xmath172 and @xmath173 would represent the goldstone modes of larger global symmetry @xmath174 , respectively with the decay constants @xmath175 and @xmath176 .",
    "thus , we would have two axion states separately for the ordinary and mirror sectors , and their masses would emerge respectively due to quantum anomalies of the @xmath107 and @xmath110 currents related to ordinary and mirror qcd . in particular , @xmath177 would represent the familiar ww axion with order @xmath178 mev mass given by eq .",
    "( [ ww - mass ] ) .",
    "however , the mixing term ( [ pot - mix ] ) reduces the larger global symmetry @xmath174 to a common pq symmetry @xmath12 . substituting ( [ neutr ] ) in @xmath113 , we obtain : @xmath179 thus , the combination @xmath180 , where @xmath181 , receives a mass@xmath120 term : @xmath182 which is _ positive _ for @xmath183 . the present experimental limits on the higgs search",

    "( [ thetas ] ) in the same way , whereas the heavy state @xmath192 is irrelevant since it has a vanishing vev .",
    "therefore , @xmath193 and @xmath194 will be simoultaneously cancelled by the axion vev @xmath195 and so in our model the strong cp - problem is solved in both sectors",
    ". can get radiative corrections due to the fact that the electroweak scales are different in two sectors . however , it is well - known that these corrections are negligibly small @xcite . ]",
    "in addition , for the case @xmath196 we obtain a quite interesting situation .",
    "the axion state @xmath14 dominantly emerges from the phases of the mirror higgses @xmath62 while it contains only a small admixture from the ordinary higgses @xmath41 : @xmath197 .",

    "since the mass of our axion receives contributions from both ordinary and mirror qcd , in a full analogy to eq .",
    "( [ b ] ) one can write : @xmath200 where @xmath201 is the mass matrix of the mirror light quarks , and the values @xmath202 and @xmath203 characterize the mirror gluon and quark condensates , with @xmath83 being the qcd scale in the mirror sector .",
    "the first term in this expression gives an ordinary _ small _ contribution ( [ a - m ] ) and it is negligible in comparison to the second term which can give _",
    "much larger _ contribution as far as @xmath204 and @xmath205 .",
    "certainly , the exact form of the latter term depends on how many light quarks ( with masses less than @xmath83 ) are contained in mirror sector .",
    "in particular , for the cases of two ( @xmath206 and @xmath207 ) , one ( @xmath206 ) , or zero light quarks , the second term in brackets of eq .",

    "one has to use the general formula ( [ b ] ) .",
    "nevertheless , @xmath53 still decreases very slowly with increasing @xmath68 and for enough large @xmath219 , its value can be of the order of mev .",

    "( [ b ] ) and ( [ photon - mir ] ) . in fig .",
    "2 we show isocontours ( dash - dott ) corresponding to @xmath302 erg / s at @xmath275 s from the collapse , which in fact indicate a lower limit on the pq scale @xmath15 for given @xmath303 and @xmath304 .",
    "another constraint on our model emerges due to the axion decay into ordinary photons . for @xmath305",
    "gev the flux of axions emitted from the collapsing core is quite large , and thus if the axions would decay into the visible photons in their travel to the earth , one would observe the gamma ray burst associated with the sn 1987a .",
    "however , the smm satellite data @xcite sets the stringent upper limit on the @xmath306 flux from the sn 1987a .",
    "in particular , these data indicate that photon fluence for for the photon energy band @xmath307 mev integrated over first 10 s from the collapse , did not exceed one photon per @xmath308 . therefore ,",
    "the only way to to suppress the gamma ray signal from is to assume that the dominant part of the axions have undergone the decay inside the star envelope , during the flight time @xmath309 s , where @xmath310 km is a radius of the sn 1987a progenitor star , the blue giant sanduleak .",
    "hence , for the relevant axion energies @xmath311 mev , the exponential factor @xmath312 should be very small , where the total decay width @xmath313 incorporates the decays into the ordinary and mirror photons ( [ width ] ) , and if @xmath255 , also into electron - positron ( [ width - e ] ) .",
    "therefore , @xmath314 should not exceed few seconds .",
    "more precisely , by taking that the axions emitted from the axiosphere have a thermal spectrum with a temperature which at the time moment @xmath288 from the collapse estimated as @xmath315 mev @xcite , one can compute the expected photon fluence in the energy band @xmath307 mev and confront it to the smm bound .",
    "the results for various values of the parameter @xmath303 are shown in fig .",
    "the dash curves correspond to the smm limit on the @xmath306 fluence and so they set an upper limit on @xmath15 for given values of @xmath303 and @xmath216 .",
    "thus , we see that there is a parameter space compatible with the existing experimental and astrophysical limits , which yields @xmath15 around @xmath316 gev and @xmath53 about 1 mev",
    ". this parameter range can be accessible for the experimental testing at the future reactor or beam dump experiments .",
    "a potential problem for the invisible axion models arises from the planck scale effects .",
    "many arguments suggest that the non - perturbative quantum gravity effects can induce the higher order effective operators cutoff by the planck scale @xmath57 which explicitly violate the global symmetry .",
    "let us take the dfsz model @xcite in which @xmath12 symmetry is spontaneoulsy broken by the gauge singlet scalar @xmath58 , @xmath317 and consider a dimension 5 operator @xmath318 , with @xmath319 being some complex coupling constant .",
    "this term explicitly breaks the pq symmetry and induces the mass term to the axion field : @xmath320 which should be compared with the dynamical mass term @xmath321 ( [ a - m ] ) .",
    "the potential for @xmath322 then becomes @xmath323 , where @xmath324 is related to the complex phase of the coupling constant @xmath319 and it is generically order 1 .",
    "although the first `` genuine '' term in this potential would fix the axion vev at @xmath325 , the second term does not care about the strong cp problem and tends to minimize the potential along @xmath326 .",
    "therefore , @xmath327 demands that @xmath328 , which in turn translates into the upper limit @xmath329 gev .",
    "this is in sharp contradiction with the lower limit @xmath330 gev unless the constant @xmath319 is extremely small , @xmath331 .",
    "therefore , if one takes the planck scale induced effects seriously , there is no room left for the invisible axion models .    as for our model",
    ", it appears to be stable against the planck scale corrections by threefold reason : ( i ) the pq scale is lower , @xmath332 gev , ( ii ) the axion is heavier , @xmath2 mev , and ( iii ) the minimal possible explicit planck scale operators in the higgs potential are of dimension 6 and so they are suppressed @xmath333 : let us consider , e.g. the terms : @xmath334 they induce the axion explicit mass term : @xmath335 and the constraint @xmath328 , for a typical value @xmath336 mev , implies @xmath337 gev , which is consistent with the parameter range found in previous section .",
    "the planck scale effects could explicitly break the pq symmetry also in the yukawa like operators @xcite , e.g. @xmath338 which would interfere with the contribution to the yukawa terms ( [ sm - yuk ] ) and could deviate @xmath193 from zero .",
    "however , for @xmath339 gev these corrections are also negligible and do not give problems .",
    "let us now comment about the model of rubakov @xcite which was based on the grand unified picture @xmath340 .",
    "it was assumed that the mirror gut symmetry @xmath341 breaks down to the mirror standard model gauge group @xmath342 at lower scale than the ordinary @xmath343 breaks to standard gauge group .",
    "in other words , the vev of the higgs 24-plet @xmath344 of @xmath341 is somewhat lower than the vev of the 24-plet higgs of @xmath343 , @xmath345 .",
    "then the difference between the infrared poles for the strong coupling constants @xmath148 and @xmath22 can emerge obtained due to the rg evolution from the corresponding scales down in energy .",
    "the gauge constant of @xmath343 runs faster then the one of @xmath346 , and thus it is possible to have the bigger qcd scale in mirror sector , @xmath347 . in this way",
    "one could obtain obtain a very massive axion ( e.g. @xmath348 gev or more ) .",
    "however , in this case the m - parity is broken at gut scales and therefore there is no strong reason to expect that it will be valid in the low energy yukawa sector .",
    "for example , the planck scale operators of dimension 5 are dangerous : @xmath349 where @xmath350 is the 5-plet higgs . due to m - parity",
    "we have @xmath351 and @xmath352 but the effective yukawa coupling @xmath353 is not equal to the mirror effective yukawa coupling @xmath354 .",
    "this should cause the big phase difference beteween them and so that @xmath355 .",
    "therefore , the model @xcite is not stable against the planck scale corrections .    a way to overcome",
    "this problem is to break m - parity only at lower energies .",
    "e.g. , one can take @xmath340 model with @xmath356 , and break m - parity only due to different electroweak scales in two sectors , so that @xmath357 .",
    "clealy , this is nothing but embedding of our model considered in this paper in the grand unified picture .",
    "we have suggested a new possibility for solving the strong cp - problem .",
    "it assumes that in parallel to the observable particle world described by the standard model , there exists a mirror world of particles with the identical lagrangian , and two sectors share the same peccei - quinn symmetry realized _  la _ weiberg - wilczek model .",
    "we asume that the mirror symmetry between two worlds is spontaneously broken so that the electroweak scale in the mirror sector @xmath82 is considerably larger than the ordinary electroweak scale @xmath358 gev .",
    "this in turn implies the infrared scale @xmath148 of the mirror strong interactions has to be somewhat larger than the ordinary qcd scale @xmath147 mev . in this way , the axion mass and interaction constants are actually determined by mirror sector scales @xmath218 and @xmath148 , while the @xmath0 terms are simultaneously cancelled in both sectors due to mirror symmetry .",
    "this means that the axion state essentially emerges from the mirror higgs doublets , up to small ( @xmath359 ) admixture from the ordinary higgses .",
    "hence , our axion is a ww - type axion for the mirror sector while from the point of view of ordinary sector it is dfsz - type invisible axion with the symmetry breaking scale @xmath360 .",
    "we have discussed the experimental and astrophysical limits on such an axion and have found an interesting parameter window where the pq scale is @xmath361 gev and the axion mass is @xmath283 mev , which is accessible for the axion search in the future reactor and beam dump experiments .",
    "interestingly , for such a parameter range our model is stable against the planck scale corrections as far as the strong cp - problem is concerned .    in our model , which in fact is the simplest mirror extension of the standard model",
    ", we can not approach parameter space which could be applicable for explanation of the gamma ray bursts via axion emission from the collapsing compact objects @xcite .",
    "this , however , could be easily achieved in the supersymmetric version of our model , due to stronger effects in the renormalization group evolution of the strong coupling constants in two sectors .",
