    "a recent paper has discussed the dispersion relation and the growth or damping rates of low frequency electromagnetic waves pertaining to the whistler branch , propagating along an ambient magnetic field , in a plasma in which electrons and ions can be described by product - bi - kappa ( pbk ) distributions , and which may contain a small population of dust particles @xcite .",
    "the growth of the low - frequency waves in this branch of the dispersion curves constitute the so - called ion - firehose instability .",
    "it may occur when there is anisotropy in the velocity distribution of the ions , caused either by anisotropy between perpendicular and parallel ion temperatures ( namely , @xmath0 ) , or by anisotropy between the perpendicular and parallel kappa indexes which characterize a ion pbk distribution .",
    "the work done in @xcite was closely related to the work done in two other relatively recent papers dedicated to low frequency electromagnetic waves , which respectively discussed the ion - firehose instability @xcite and the emic instability ( which occurs when @xmath1 ) @xcite , in a plasma without dust .",
    "one of the motivations for these studies has been the fact that observations have consistently shown that ions as well as electrons in the solar wind may have non thermal velocity distributions which feature characteristic power - law tails .",
    "these distributions with power - law tails can be mathematically described by functions which are generically known as kappa distributions , whose introduction for the description of velocity distributions in space environments is usually attributed to @xcite .",
    "two different basic forms of kappa distributions are used in the literature , which are the kappa distribution as defined in @xcite and the kappa distribution as defined in @xcite .",
    "anisotropic forms of kappa distributions can also be defined , either based upon the functions defined in @xcite or based upon the functions defined in @xcite , and may be useful for the discussion of instabilities in space environments .",
    "these anisotropic forms of kappa distributions are usually known as bi - kappa ( bk ) distributions , when feature isotropic kappa index and temperature anisotropy , or as product - bi - kappa ( pbk ) distributions , when the anisotropy may also occur in the kappa indexes .",
    "another form of anisotropic kappa distribution is the kappa - maxwellian distribution , characterized by a kappa form along parallel direction and a maxwellian distribution along perpendicular directions @xcite .",
    "kappa distributions , either for ions or for electrons , isotropic or anisotropic , may lead to significant modifications in the dispersion relations of electromagnetic waves and on the growth rates of instabilities in plasmas @xcite .",
    "bi - kappa distributions have been used , for instance , as part of tools to modelate observed features of plasmas in the jupiter environment .",
    "product - bi - kappa distributions are more flexible than bi - maxwellians and bk distributions , since their non thermal features can be modelated by anisotropic temperatures and by anisotropic kappa indexes , and have already been used as a modelating tool in @xcite , and also in a discussion about the instability limits for the weibel instability , in @xcite .",
    "we are not aware of other uses of pbk distributions to actually fit results of observations , but it is conceivable that they can replace with advantage the less flexible bk distributions or the combinations of bi - maxwellians which have been used in past data analysis .",
    "it is therefore useful to investigate the effect of pbk distributions on waves and instabilities , in order to understand the differences between wave properties in the presence of pbk distributions and in the presence of bk or bi - maxwellian distributions .",
    "in addition to taking into account the presence of pbk velocity distributions , @xcite also took into account the possibility of presence of dust in the plasma , motivated by observations which have shown that the plasma in the solar wind may contain a dust population .",
    "in fact , observations of the inner region of the solar system , made with satellites like ulysses , galileo , or cassini , have shown the existence of a population of small dust particles , with sizes which range from the nanometric to the micrometric size .",
    "the number density of dust particles has been seen to be much smaller than that of the solar wind particles , but it is estimated that the total mass of dust particles in the inner region of the solar system may be about the same order of magnitude as the mass of plasma particles .",
    "dust has also been observed as a significant element in some specific environments , like in the neighborhood of comets @xcite , in planetary rings @xcite , and in the vicinity of jupiter s satellites @xcite .",
    "dust may therefore play relevant role in the dynamics of plasma in the solar wind .",
    "the presence of dust affects the dispersion properties of plasmas , leading to modifications in the properties of plasma waves in comparison with those in a dustless plasma , and also to the occurrence of new modes , associated to the dynamics of the dust @xcite .    in the present paper",
    "we return to the study of effects due to the ion distribution function , particularly the effect of pbk distributions , considering now waves in the ic branch of the dispersion relation of low frequency electromagnetic wave , in a dusty plasma .",
    "the investigation is complementary to that appearing in @xcite , which considered waves in the whistler branch , and to that appearing in @xcite , which studied ic waves in a dustless plasma .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section [ sec : theoretical - formulation ] we briefly describe the theoretical formulation which leads to the dispersion relation for electromagnetic waves propagating parallel to the ambient magnetic field in a dusty plasma , considering different forms of the velocity distribution for plasma particles , either pbk or bi - maxwellian .",
    "the discussion which is presented is very brief and dedicated to the presentation and definition of quantities and expressions used in the present paper , with references to the literature in regard to details of the derivation .",
    "section [ sec : numerical - results ] is dedicated to presentation and discussion of results obtained by numerical solution of the dispersion relation , considering different combinations of ion and electron distribution functions and different sets of parameters .",
    "section [ sec : conclusions ] presents some final remarks .",
    "for electromagnetic waves which propagate along the ambient magnetic field , in plasmas with particles described by distribution functions which have even dependence on the velocity variable which is parallel to the direction of the magnetic field , the dispersion relation is obtained as the solution of the following determinant , @xmath2 where it has been taken into account that , for @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 , and where @xmath6 is the parallel component of the refraction vector , @xmath7 .    the determinant given by equation ( [ disprel,1 ] )",
    "can be separated into two minor determinants , and the dispersion relation becomes the following , @xmath8    the components of the dielectric tensor which appear in dispersion relation in a dusty plasma can be written as follows @xmath9 where @xmath10\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and where @xmath11 and @xmath12 are numerical coefficients . in equations",
    "[ epsij ] , non dimensional variables have been used , defined @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 . the quantity",
    "@xmath19 is the plasma frequency for species @xmath20 , @xmath21 is the cyclotron angular frequency for species @xmath20 , @xmath22 is the alfvn velocity , and @xmath23 is the frequency of inelastic collisions between dust particles and plasma particles of species @xmath20 . in terms of non dimensional variables , the frequency of inelastic dust - plasma collisions may be written as follows , @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the equilibrium value of the dust charge .",
    "it is assumed that the dust charge is acquired via inelastic collisions between plasma particles and the dust grains , and it is therefore convenient to write @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the dust charge number and @xmath28 is the absolute value of the charge of and electron , since the charge acquired by dust particles via collisional processes is negative . in the derivation of equations ,",
    "it was assumed for simplicity that all dust particles are spherical , with radius @xmath29 .",
    "details of the derivation of equations can be obtained in @xcite .    using the expressions for the components @xmath30 given by equations , the dispersion relation can be written in a very simple form , depending on the integral quantities @xmath31 , @xmath32 with @xmath33 .",
    "the dependence of the dispersion relation on the velocity distribution functions of the plasma particles appears only in the integral quantities @xmath31 . for evaluation of these integral quantities",
    ", we utilize an approximation , which is to use the average value of the inelastic collision frequency , obtained as follows , @xmath34 instead of the velocity dependent form @xmath35 .    for description of the plasma particles",
    ", we consider that their velocity distributions can be either pbk distributions or bi - maxwellian distributions .",
    "the pbk distribution to be used is based on the kappa distribution as defined in @xcite , and can be written as follows , @xmath36 while the bi - maxwellian velocity distribution is given in dimensionless variables by the well known expression , @xmath37    in equation , and in equation as well , we have used the non dimensional thermal velocities for particles of species @xmath20 , defined as @xmath38 whre @xmath39 and @xmath40 denote respectively the perpendicular and parallel temperatures for particles of species @xmath20 .",
    "the anisotropy of temperatures for a given species is usually denoted by the ratio @xmath41 .    equation is the form of pbk distribution which has been used in a previous study made on the emic instability for dustless plasmas @xcite , and also in studies made on waves in the whistler branch , in dustless and in dusty plasmas @xcite , respectively .",
    "as can be easily verified from equation , a pbk distribution has two sources of anisotropy between perpendicular and parallel directions , the difference in the temperature variables @xmath39 and @xmath40 , and the difference in the kappa indexes @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "effective temperatures along perpendicular and parallel directions can be defined , and in energy units are given as follows , @xmath44    it is seen that the effective temperatures @xmath45 and @xmath46 are larger than the corresponding temperatures @xmath39 and @xmath40 . this feature is characteristic of distributions based on the kappa distribution as defined in @xcite .",
    "kappa distributions as defined in @xcite , which are not considered in the present paper , feature effective temperatures which are equal to the respective temperatures @xmath39 and @xmath40 @xcite .    using @xmath47 as the distribution given by equation ( [ pbk ] ) , with use of the approximation given by equation , the integral @xmath48 appearing in the dispersion relation , given by equation , becomes as follows @xcite @xmath49 , \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]",
    "where @xmath50 @xmath51 , \\nonumber\\\\ & & \\quad \\kappa_{\\beta\\parallel}>-1/2 \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath52 ,   \\nonumber\\\\ & & \\quad\\kappa_{\\beta\\parallel}>-3/2 , \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and where @xmath53 is the hypergeometric gauss function .",
    "using @xmath47 as the bi - maxwellian distribution function given by equation , and using the approximation given by equation , the @xmath48 integral which has to be used in the dispersion relation becomes the following @xmath54 \\biggr\\},\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath55 is the well - known plasma dispersion function @xcite , @xmath56    a timely comment is that equation ( [ j , pbk ] ) , for @xmath57 and @xmath58 , becomes the same as equation ( [ j , bimax ] ) .",
    "for the numerical analysis about the effect of dust on the dispersion relation of ic waves , and on the growth rate of the emic instability , we consider the same parameters which we have used in our previous study about the ic waves , which was made without considering the presence of dust @xcite , and add the dust population . for the non dimensional parameters @xmath59 and @xmath60 we assume the values @xmath61 and @xmath62 ( except for one figure , where we take @xmath63 ) , for the ion charge number we take @xmath64 , and for the ion mass we assume @xmath65 , the mass of a proton .",
    "moreover , since we are interested in an instability generated by anisotropy in the ion distribution , we consider in all cases to be studied that the electron temperature is isotropic and is the same as the ion parallel temperature , @xmath66 . with this choice of parameters , the results to be obtained in the present analysis , in the limit of vanishing dust population , can be directly compared with the results obtained in @xcite . when a dust population is taken into account",
    ", we assume micrometric particles , with radius @xmath67{cm}$ ] .",
    "moreover , in the ensuing numerical analysis , the number density of the dust population is given in terms of the number density of the ion population , which is another parameter which has to be assumed .",
    "we take the ion number density as @xmath68{cm^{-3}}$ ] , value which can be representative of outbursts in carbon - rich stars , environment where effects associated to the presence of dust are expected to be very significant @xcite .",
    "in fact , it was even argued that in these environments the conditions may be such that dust grains can eventually become coupled , forming dust molecules @xcite .",
    "such strongly coupled dusty plasmas are not contemplated in our analysis , which is valid for weakly coupled dust . with the choice made for the ion number density ,",
    "the results to be obtained in the present analysis can be compared , in the limit where the particle distributions tend to be maxwellian or bi - maxwellian , with results obtained in @xcite , where the same set of parameters has been utilized .    using these parameters , we solve the dispersion relation considering different forms of the distribution functions for ions and electrons , and different values of the number density population of dust particles .",
    "initially , we consider the effects of the presence of the dust on the imaginary part of the frequency , which can be appreciated in figure [ fig1 ] , where the results obtained in the case without the presence of dust are shown at the left side column , and the results obtained in the presence of a small population of dust appear at the right side column . in figure [ fig1 ]",
    "we consider the case of a small population of dust , with relative number density @xmath69 , where @xmath70 is the equilibrium values of the dust number density .",
    "the individual curves show the results obtained considering different values of the ion temperature anisotropy , @xmath71= 2 , 3 , 4 , 6 , and 8",
    ". figures [ fig1](a ) and [ fig1](b ) show the results obtained considering for the ions a bi - maxwellian distribution and for the electrons an isotropic maxwellian distribution , so that for both species the integral @xmath48 in the dispersion relation is given by equation .",
    "it is seen that the growth rates of the instability , that is , the magnitude of the values of @xmath72 , increase with the increase of the temperature ratio , both in the case without dust and in the case with dust .",
    "it is also seen that the range of values of @xmath73 where instability occurs increases as well .",
    "the effect of the presence of a small population of dust is seen in the comparison between figures [ fig1](a ) , no dust , and [ fig1](b ) , with case .",
    "figure [ fig1](b ) features a slight overall reduction of @xmath74 , in comparison with figure [ fig1](a ) , and also show the occurrence of a region of damping rates ( @xmath75 ) for small values of @xmath73 , which is not seen in figure [ fig1](a ) .    in the case depicted in figures [ fig1](c ) and",

    "the electron contribution to the dispersion relation contains @xmath48 as given by equation , and the ion contribution contains @xmath48 as given by equation .",
    "the comparison between figures [ fig1](c ) and [ fig1](a ) , both obtained without dust , shows that the increase in the non thermal character of the ion distribution , due to the use of the pbk distribution , contributes to increase the instability both in magnitude of the growth rates and in the range of wave numbers with instability .",
    "the comparison between figures [ fig1](c ) and [ fig1](d ) shows that in this case the effect of the presence of a small population of the dust is similar to that seen in the case of ions with bi - maxwellian distribution , in figures [ fig1](a ) and [ fig1](b ) .",
    "the presence of the dust population leads to small reduction of the magnitude of the values of @xmath74 , decrease of the range of unstable wave numbers , and occurrence of a damping region for small values of @xmath73 .",
    "figures [ fig1](e ) and [ fig1](f ) show the case of ions with bi - maxwellian distributions and electrons with isotropic pbk distribution , assuming @xmath77 , with ion temperature ratios and other parameters as in figures [ fig1](a ) and [ fig1](b ) .",
    "the only difference between panels ( e ) and ( f ) and panels ( a ) ad ( b ) , respectively , is the electron distribution function .",
    "figures [ fig1](e ) and [ fig1](f ) show that in the case of pbk distribution for electrons the magnitude of the values of @xmath78 and the range of values of @xmath73 with positive @xmath78 are reduced compared to the case of maxwellian electron distribution seen in panels ( a ) and ( b ) .",
    "this observation was also made in the case of ion firehose instability , both in a plasma without dust @xcite and in a plasma with a dust population @xcite .",
    "the effect of the presence of the dust is a slight reduction of the growth rates and of the range of unstable wave numbers , seen in the comparison between figures [ fig1](f ) and [ fig1](e ) .",

    "it is seen that the values of @xmath78 are larger in panels ( g ) and ( h ) than in panels ( a ) and ( b ) , respectively , indicating dominance of the influence of the non thermal character of the ion distribution over the effect of the non thermal character of the electron distribution .",
    "that is , for the same kappa indexes , the tendency to increase the instability , caused by the pbk ion distribution , is seen to be more significant than the tendency of decrease in the instability , associated to the pbk electron distribution .",
    "the effect of the presence of a small population of dust is similar to the effect seen in the case of the other combinations of ion and electron distribution functions , with the appearing of a region with damping for small @xmath73 and small decrease of the growth rates and of the range of wave numbers with instability .",

    "the sequence of panels from top to bottom of figure [ fig1 ] shows that the modification in the ion or electron distribution functions , from maxwellian to pbk with relatively small value of the kappa indexes , produces some quantitative change in the values of @xmath80 , but does not modify the quantitative dependence on normalized wave number @xmath73 , or on the ion temperature ratios .",
    "in figure [ fig3 ] we present the values of the imaginary and real parts of the roots of the dispersion relation for ic waves , considering fixed value of the ion temperature ratio , different forms of the velocity distribution functions , and different values of the dust density .",

    "it is seen that in the case of figure [ fig7](e ) the instability is slightly stronger , with larger range of unstable wave numbers , than in the case of figure [ fig7](a ) .",
    "as already noticed in the commentaries about figure [ fig6 ] , it is seen that the anisotropy which is due to anisotropic kappa indexes is not so effective in producing the emic instability as the anisotropy due to the ion temperatures .",
    "we have presented results obtained from a numerical analysis of the dispersion relation for low - frequency ion - cyclotron waves propagating along the ambient magnetic field in a dusty plasma , considering situations where either ions or electrons , or both , have product - bi - kappa velocity distributions . regarding the influence of the shape of the velocity distribution",
    ", results obtained considering absence of dust have shown that , if the electrons are described by an isotropic maxwellian distribution and the ion distribution is changed from the bi - maxwellian limit to a pbk distribution with relatively small kappa index , the range in wavenumber where instability occurs is increased , and the magnitude of the growth rates is increased as well .",
    "conversely , if the ion distribution is a bi - maxwellian distribution and the electron distribution is changed from a maxwellian distribution into a pbk distribution with small kappa index , with isotropic electron temperature , the magnitude and range of the emic instability is very little affected .",
    "this weak dependence of the growth rates of the emic instability on non thermal features of the electron distribution is in contrast with the dependence reported in the literature in the case of the ion - firehose instability , for which it has been seen that the adoption of a pbk distribution with small kappa index for electrons leads to strong reduction of the instability @xcite . regarding the influence of dust , the results obtained have shown that , for all shapes of ion and electron distributions which have been utilized , the presence of a small population of dust leads to some decrease in the magnitude of the growth rates and in the range of the emic instability , in comparison with the case without dust .",
    "we have also seen that in presence of dust a region of wave damping appears for small values of @xmath73 , which is not present in the dustless case .",
    "all these features related to different forms of ion and electron distributions , and to the presence of a small amount of dust , have been obtained considering the plasma parameter @xmath125 , and have also been verified considering one example with smaller value of this parameter , @xmath63 .    still regarding the effect of the presence of dust",
    ", the results obtained have shown that a value of the relative number density of dust which is enough to make disappear completely the emic instability in bi - maxwellian plasma , may be not enough to overcome the instability in plasmas with ions described by pbk distributions with small kappa index .",
    "it has also been seen that the increase in the dust population leads to decrease of the phase velocity of the ic waves , for all types of combinations of maxwellian and pbk distributions which have been investigated .",
    "for fixed temperature ratio @xmath71 and fixed dust number density , it has been seen that the decrease of the kappa index in a pbk ion distribution leads to increase of the instability in range and in magnitude of the growth rate , and that the increase becomes more and more pronounced for progressively smaller ion kappa indexes . on the other hand , for fixed value of @xmath71 and dust density ratio , with bi - maxwellian distribution for ions ,",
    "the decrease of the kappa index in a pbk electron distribution leads to decrease of the emic instability , in magnitude of the growth rate and in range , but the decrease is not very pronounced .",
    "we have also investigated the effect of anisotropy in the kappa indexes of the ion pbk distribution , for given dust number density and for isotropic ion temperatures .",
    "it has been seen that the anisotropy due to the anisotropic kappa indexes is not so effective in producing the emic instability as the anisotropy due to the ratio between the ion perpendicular and parallel temperatures .",
