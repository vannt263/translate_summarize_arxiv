    "the @xmath1 phase is characterized by a dimerization of the vanadium atoms into pairs , as well as a tilting of these pairs with respect to the @xmath2-axis @xcite as indicated by showing bonds between the paired v atoms in fig .",

    "while the rutile phase is a conductor , the @xmath1 phase is an insulator with a gap of @xmath7  ev @xcite at the fermi energy .",
    "vo@xmath0 has also attracted a great deal of attention for its ultrafast optical response , switching between the _ r _ and the @xmath1 phases @xcite . despite the large number of experimental @xcite and theoretical @xcite studies focusing on this material the physics driving this phase transition and the resulting optical properties",
    "are still not identified undoubtedly . in the theoretical works using lda @xcite the formation of the gap was not found .",
    "the single site dmft approach  @xcite is known to correctly describe the metallic phase but can not take into account the formation of the bonding states of the dimers in the insulating phase which requires the cluster dmft method @xcite .",
    "as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite the fully interacting one - electron spectrum of the @xmath1 phase can be reproduced by an effective band structure description .",
    "the optical conductivities calculated by using cluster dmft shows good agreement with the experiment for both phases  @xcite .",
    "the metal - insulator transition ( mit ) of vo@xmath0 is usually attributed to two different physical mechanisms .",
    "one of them is the peierls physics , i.e. the dimerization of the v atoms along the rutile @xmath2-axis @xcite , and consequently opening of the gap in the brillouin - zone reduced in the direction along the @xmath2-axis . in this case",
    ", the gap opening can be explained in the framework of effective one - electron theories .",
    "the other one is the mott mechanism where the gap opens due to the strong coulomb repulsion between the localized v-@xmath8 orbitals @xcite and the related dynamical effects . understanding in detail the interplay and relative importance of both the peierls and the mott mechanisms for the electronic structure is crucial for controlling this material with an eye towards applications .",
    "for example , whether the driving force of this transition is electronic ( i.e. occurring on femtosecond timescales ) or structural ( occurring on the picosecond timescale ) is important to understand the speed of the switching from the @xmath1 to the rutile phase . from the perspective of applications , in order to control the properties of vanadium dioxide , it is essential to identify the effects of compressive and tensile stress resulting from the various substrates , on which the films are deposited @xcite .",
    "the experimental results of ref .",
    "@xcite showed that compressive uniaxial strain ( along the @xmath2-axis ) stabilizes the metallic phase .",
    "this result can not be explained by applying a simple peierls picture exclusively .",
    "the peierls mechanism predicts that a compression along the @xmath2-axis increases the splitting between the bonding and antibonding state , formed by the combinations of particular @xmath8 orbitals residing on the different v atoms in a dimer , and hence would promote insulating state .",
    "the peierls mechanism thus increases the tendency to open the gap in the @xmath1 phase , which would stabilize the insulating phase at the expense of the metallic phase . in this picture",
    ", the transition temperature would increase under uniaxial compressive strain , opposite to experiment  @xcite .",
    "the lda calculations fail to reproduce the gap in the @xmath1 phase  @xcite .",
    "this suggests that the correlations are important in this material .",
    "motivated by this and the above mentioned experiment we have examined the influence of strain on the electronic structure of vo@xmath0 microscopically applying the dynamical mean - field theory @xcite combined with the local density approximation of density functional theory ( lda+dmft ) @xcite .",
    "we carried out lda+dmft calculations of vo@xmath0 under strain .",
    "we established that in addition to the peierls distortion , other factors like the position of the @xmath9 band and the band - width of the bonding state in the @xmath1 phase showing definite sensitivity to the strain , play a defining role in driving the mit in vo@xmath0 .",
    "theoretical predictions for the strain dependence of many spectroscopic quantities are made , including the photoemission , the optical conductivity , the inverse photoemission and xas in the @xmath10 and @xmath1 phases .",
    "the insights achieved in this study together with the computational machinery developed , will serve as a basis for rational material design of vo@xmath0 based applications .",
    "the unit cell of the rutile structure contains two vanadium and four oxygen atoms while the @xmath1 structure contains four vanadium ( 2 dimers ) and eight oxygen atoms .",
    "the calculations in the rutile phase were performed with the doubled unit cells ( four v and eight o atoms ) to allow the formation of a bonding state between the v atoms separated along the @xmath2-axis , a mechanism which has dramatic effect in the @xmath1 phase .",
    "the lattice structure parameters for the rutile ( referred as @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 in the following ) and @xmath1 cases ( @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 ) were published by mcwhan _",

    "@xcite , respectively .",
    "note that our notation of the axis differs from the published data @xcite , in order to emphasize the similarity of the _ r _ and @xmath1 structures .",
    "the strain was applied by changing the lattice constants but not the internal parameters of the atomic positions .",
    "the strain is characterized by the ratio between the experimental lattice constant along the @xmath2-axis of the unstrained crystal , and the one used in the calculation , @xmath18 in the rutile and @xmath19 in the @xmath1 case .",
    "the applied strains correspond to @xmath20 , 1.00 and 1.02 ratios both for the _ r _ and @xmath1 phases in order to make calculations which are compatible with the experiment in ref .",
    "the lattice parameters were changed with the constraint to preserve the volume of the original unit cell and to form a structure to closely resemble the original structure .",

    "[ fig : imsig_optics ] , one can see that even by employing larger @xmath55 values , the scattering rate ( @xmath107 ) is not large enough to reproduce the experimental results , and the calculated optical conductivity will not show _ bad metal _ behaviour at this temperature . from this result",
    "one can draw the conclusion that the experimentally measured large scattering rate is a consequence of an inhomogeneity of the system as indicated in recent experiments @xcite .",
    "in fig .  [ fig : phase ] , a sketch of the phase diagram of the rutile structure based on calculated points within the cluster dmft is displayed as a function of the temperature and the coulomb repulsion parameter @xmath55 .",
    "three different phases are distinguished : the metal ( m ) , the insulator ( i ) and the coexistent ( c ) regions . to identify them ,",
    "the imaginary part of the local matsubara green s function , @xmath108 , of the cluster was investigated .",
    "we considered that the solution is insulating when @xmath108 converges to 0 at low imaginary frequencies for all orbitals , as shown in an example in the right inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : phase ] .",
    "the metallic solutions are the ones where @xmath108 tends to a finite value for at least one of the orbitals ( see the left inset in fig .  [",
    "fig : phase ] ) . in the metallic region",
    "only the metallic solution is stable . in the insulator region",
    "only the insulating solution is stable , and in the coexistence region , both are stable . in order to decide whether a solution is stable or not , the dmft calculations were started from an ansatz of a specified type ( metal or insulator ) and if it remained of the same type after the self - consistent solution is reached , one can regard it as a stable mean - field solution . in fig .",
    "[ fig : phase ] it can be observed that below @xmath109  ev only the metallic solutions are stable while above @xmath110  ev only the insulator is stable .",
    "the nature of the insulating state in rutile phase is very different from the insulating state in @xmath1 phase .",
    "the lower hubbard band in the rutile insulator is an almost equal mixture of all three @xmath38 orbitals .",
    "however , the interaction strength needed to open the true mott gap without the help of the peierls mechanism , is considerably larger . in the coexistence region",
    ", one can expect a crossover between the two phases governed by the free energy of the system @xcite .",
    "there is a strong experimental indication that the rutile phase resides in the vicinity ( but on the metallic side ) of this crossover .",
    "pouget and launois showed that the metallic feature of the rutile phase is very sensitive by substitutional alloying of vo@xmath0 with nb ( v@xmath111nb@xmath112o@xmath0 ) which increases the @xmath113 ratio and results in the appearance of a gap keeping the rutile structure at @xmath114 @xcite .",
    "recently , holman _",
    "et  al . _",
    "@xcite reported insulator to metal transition in v@xmath111mo@xmath115o@xmath0 system at @xmath116 .",
    "all those experiments suggest that vo@xmath0 is in the crossover region near the coexistence of two solutions in the cluster dmft phase diagram . on the basis of our calculation",
    "we conjecture that the rutile phase might be able to support either metallic or insulating solution ( with a very small gap ) , and hence either of the two phases can be stabilized depending on small external stimuli . on the other hand , the @xmath1 phase at the same interaction strength supports only insulating solution , and it is unlikely that small external perturbation can turn it to metallic state .",
    "one possibility to improve",
    "the agreement between the experimental and theoretical results is that one should use different parameters in the downfolded model .",
    "the second possibility is that the material is strongly inhomogeneous which was not taken into account so far in any theoretical calculations .",
    "finally , it is most likely that calculation without invoking the downfolding approximation will result in a more accurate description of this material .",
    "this would place the vo@xmath0 closer to the mott charge transfer insulator boundary in the zaanen - sawatzky - allen phase diagram .",
    "work in this direction is in progress .",
    "our exploratory theoretical research set up the machinery for describing the subtle interplay of coulomb correlations , orbital degeneracy and strain in determining the mechanism of the mit in vo@xmath0 .",
    "our theory , coupled with existing strain experiments , clearly shows that the peierls distortion is only one element affecting the mit and the switching mechanism of this material .",
    "the lda+dmft calculations in the unstrained material are in good agreement with experiments .",
    "we performed the first lda+dmft studies of the electronic structure of vo@xmath0 under strain .",
    "besides the peierls increase in @xmath39 bonding - antibonding splitting , the lowering in energy of the @xmath117 orbital , and the rapid change in bandwidth of the @xmath39 orbital due to the varying overlaps , play an equally important role in controlling the position of the mit .",
    "these theoretical insights can be used for understanding and improving material properties by means of chemical substitutions . for a more accurate description",
    "it is mandatory to take into account the oxygen degrees of freedom , and calculations of the total energy in the regions suggested by this exploratory work .",
