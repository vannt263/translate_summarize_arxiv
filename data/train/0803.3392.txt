    "fermi liquid theory ( flt ) provides us with one of the most important theoretical scheme to study the properties of strongly interacting fermi systems involving low lying excitations near the fermi surface @xcite .",
    "although developed originally in the context of studying the properties of @xmath4 , it has widespread applications in other disciplines of many body physics like superconductivity , super fluidity , nuclear and neutron star matter etc @xcite .    in nuclear physics flt",
    "was first extended and used by migdal @xcite to study the properties of both unbound nuclear matter and finite nuclei @xcite .",
    "flt also provides theoretical foundation for the nuclear shell model @xcite as well as nuclear dynamics of low energy excitations@xcite .",
    "particularly , ref.@xcite reveals the connection between landau , brueckner - bethe and migdal theories , ref.@xcite , on the other hand , calculates the migdal parameters using one - boson - exchange models of the nuclear force and shows how these parameters are modified if nuclear matter is considered within the context of relativistic brueckner - hartree - fock ( rbhf ) model .",
    "some of the recent work that examines fermi - liquid properties of hadronic matter also incorporates brown - rho ( br ) scaling which is very important for the study of the properties of hadrons in dense nuclear matter ( dnm)@xcite .",
    "most of the earlier nuclear matter calculations that involved landau theory were done in a non - relativistic framework .",
    "the relativistic extension of the flt was first developed by baym and chin @xcite in the context of studying the properties of dnm . in @xcite",
    "the authors invoked walecka model ( wm ) to calculate various interaction parameters ( @xmath5 ) but did not consider mean fields ( mf ) for the @xmath6 and @xmath3 meson _ i.e. _ there the flps are calculated perturbatively .",
    "later matsui revisited the problem in @xcite where one starts from the expression of energy density in presence of scalar and vector meson mf and takes functional derivatives to determine the flps .",
    "the results are qualitatively different than the perturbative results as may be seen from @xcite .",
    "a comparison of relativistic and non - relativistic calculations have been made in @xcite which also discusses how the flps are modified in presence of the @xmath6 and @xmath7 mf and contrast those with perturbative results .",
    "besides @xmath6 and @xmath7 meson , ref.@xcite also includes the @xmath8 and @xmath9 meson and the model adopted was originally proposed by serot to incorporate pion into the wm .",
    "it is to be noted , however , that the flps presented in @xcite are independent of @xmath9 meson .",
    "this is because @xmath9 , being a pseudoscalar , fails to contribute at the mf level .",
    "hence to estimate the pionic contribution to flps it is necessary to go beyond mf formalism .",
    "it is to be noted that , to our knowledge , such relativistic calculations including @xmath9 exchange does not exist , despite the fact that pion has a special status in nuclear physics as it is responsible for the spin - isospin dependent long range nuclear force .",
    "furthermore , there are various non - relativistic calculations including the celebrated work of migdal which shows that the pionic contribution to flps are important @xcite and most dominant for low energy excitations .",
    "it might be mentioned here that @xcite discusses how can one incorporate relativistic corrections to @xmath10 in the static potential model calculation .",
    "we , however , take the approach of @xcite where all the fields are treated relativistically .    the other major departure of the present work from ref.@xcite resides in the choice of model for the description of the many body nuclear system .",
    "unlike previous calculations @xcite , here we use recently developed chiral effective field theory ( cheft ) to calculate the rflps .",
    "such a choice is motivated by the following earlier works that we now briefly review .",
    "the first attempt to include @xmath0 and @xmath8 meson into the wm was made in @xcite where to describe the @xmath0n dynamics pseudoscalar ( ps ) coupling was used .",
    "such straightforward inclusion of @xmath0 meson into the wm has serious difficulties .",
    "in particular , at the mf level it gives rise to tachyonic mode in matter at densities as low as @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the nuclear saturation density @xcite .",
    "inclusion of exchange diagrams removes such unphysical mode but makes the effective mass unrealistically large .",
    "if one simply replaces the ps coupling of ref.@xcite with the pseudovector ( pv ) interaction , these difficulties can be avoided .",
    "this , however , turns the theory non - renormalizable @xcite .    in @xcite",
    "it was shown how , starting from a ps coupling one can arrive at pv representation which preserves renormalizibility of the theory and at the same time yields realistic results for the pion dispersion relations in matter . but this model was also not found to be trouble free , particularly it had several shortcomings in describing @xmath0@xmath1 dynamics in matter which we do not discuss here and refer the reader to @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the wm itself has several problems in relation to convergence which forbids systematic expansion scheme to perform any perturbative calculations .",
    "this was first exposed in ref.@xcite .",
    "the most recent model that provides us with a systematic scheme to study the dense nuclear system is provided by cheft @xcite where the criterion of renormalizibility is given up in favor of successful relativistic description of dnm and the properties of finite nuclei .",
    "the cheft , apart from @xmath6 and @xmath7 mesons , also includes pion and therefore is best suited for the present purpose .    in this paper",
    "we estimate contributions of pion exchange to the flps within the framework of rflt and subsequently use the parameters so determined to calculate various quantities like pionic contribution to the chemical potential , energy density , symmetry energy ( @xmath13 ) etc . for completeness and direct comparison with the two loop results we also calculate here the exchange energy due to the interaction mediated by the @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath9 mesons .",
    "now we quickly outline the formalism . in flt",
    "the energy density @xmath14 of an interacting system is the functional of occupation number @xmath15 of the quasi - particle states of momentum @xmath16 .",
    "the excitation of the system is equivalent to the change of occupation number by an amount @xmath17 .",
    "the corresponding energy of the system is given by @xcite , e&=&e^0+_s _",
    "ps^0n_ps + & & + _",
    "ss f_ps , ps n_psn_ps. here , @xmath18 is the spin index .",
    "the quasi - particle energy can be written as , [ quasi_energy ] _",
    "ps=_ps^0+_sf_ps , ps n_ps , where superscript @xmath19 denotes the ground state @xcite .",
    "it is to be remembered , that , although the interaction ( @xmath20 ) between the quasiparticles is not small , the problem is greatly simplified because it is sufficient to consider only pair collisions between the quasiparticles @xcite .    since quasi - particles",
    "are well defined only near the fermi surface , one assumes .",
    "lll & _ p&=+v_f(p - p_f ) + and   & p&pp_f .    }",
    "then lps @xmath21s are defined by the legendre expansion of @xmath20 as @xcite , [ landau_para ] f_l=_ssp_l()f_ps , ps where @xmath22 is the angle between @xmath16 and @xmath23 , both taken to be on the fermi surface , and the integration is over all directions of @xmath16 .",
    "we restrict ourselves for @xmath24 _ i.e. _ @xmath25 and @xmath26 , as higher @xmath27 contribution decreases rapidly @xcite .    now the landau fermi liquid interaction @xmath20 is related to the two particle forward scattering amplitude via @xcite , f_ps , ps&=&_ps , ps , where the lorentz invariant matrix @xmath28 consists of the usual direct and exchange amplitude , which may be evaluated directly from the relevant feynman diagrams .",
    "the spin averaged scattering amplitude @xmath29 is given by @xcite , [ fermi_inter ] f_pp&=&_ss _ ps , ps.    the dimensionless lps are @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the density of states at the fermi surface defined as @xcite , [ dens_of_state ] n(0)&=&. here @xmath32 are the spin and isospin degeneracy factor respectively .",
    "by retaining only the lowest order terms in the pion fields , one obtains the following lagrangian from the chirally invariant lagrangian @xcite : & = & | + & & + ^___-m_^2_^2 -^_+m_^2^ _ + & & + ^ _ _ _ -m_^2_^2 + _ nl+ , where @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 is the isospin index . here",
    "@xmath36 is the nucleon field and @xmath37 , @xmath38 and @xmath39 are the meson fields ( isoscalar - scalar , isoscalar - vector and isovector - pseudoscalar respectively ) .",
    "the terms @xmath40 and @xmath41 contain the non - linear and counterterms respectively ( for explicit expressions see @xcite ) .    now due to presence of pion fields in the chiral lagrangian we have component in the interaction which acts on the isospin fluctuation .",
    "one can derive the isospin dependent quasiparticle interaction along the line of ref.@xcite .",
    "for pions , as mentioned before , the direct term vanishes and it is only the exchange diagram that contributes to the interaction parameter : [ pion_interaction ] f_pp^ex,_pp=p_f & = & \\ { } ,    where @xmath42 and @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 mev@xcite .",
    "the factor @xmath46 arises since the isospin factor is @xmath46 in the isoscalar channel @xcite .",
    "the effective nucleon mass @xmath47 is determined self - consistently from the following equation @xcite , [ eff_m ] m^*&=&m - n_i . using eq.([landau_para ] ) and eq.([pion_interaction ] )",
    "we can derive isoscalar lps @xmath48 and @xmath49 , [ f0_pi ] f^ex,_0&=&- , and [ f1_pi ] f^ex,_1&=&- + & & .    using eqs.([f0_pi ] ) and ( [ f1_pi ] ) we find that [ f0f1pi ] f^ex,_0-f^ex,_1 = + .",
    "it is this combination _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath50 , which appears in the calculation of chemical potential and other relevant quantities . for the massless pion , eq.([f0f1pi ] ) turns out to be finite , [ f0f1pi1 ] ( f^ex,_0-f^ex,_1)_m_0 & = & .",
    "it is to be noted that , in the massless limit for @xmath2 and @xmath3 meson , @xmath51 and @xmath52 diverge as shown in @xcite , in contrast for pion , even in the massless limit , these are finite .",
    "this is due to the presence of @xmath53 in the numerator of eq.([pion_interaction ] ) unlike @xmath6 and @xmath7 meson .",
    "the dimensionless lps can be determined by equating the equation @xmath54 and @xmath55 , where @xmath31 is the density of states at the fermi surface defined in eq.([dens_of_state ] ) .",
    "thus the dimensionless parameters are [ dless_f0 ] f^ex,_0=-g_sg_i , and [ dless_f1 ] f^ex,_1=-g_sg_i + .    0.2 in    in fig.([fig1 ] ) we show the density dependent of @xmath56 and @xmath57 due to pionic interaction . numerically at nuclear matter density @xmath58 , @xmath59 and @xmath60 . in the non - relativistic limit @xmath61 ,",
    "one obtains the same expression for @xmath62 as reported in .",
    "we now proceed to calculate the chemical potential which in principle will be different for the neutron and proton in asymmetric nuclear matter .",
    "although in the present work we deal with symmetric nuclear matter ( snm ) for which @xmath63 .",
    "to calculate the general expression for chemical potential with arbitrary asymmetry @xmath64 , we take distribution function with explicit isospin index @xmath65 , so that variation of distribution function gives @xcite [ delta_nb ] n_b&= & -n_b(0 ) , where @xmath66 is the isospin dependent density of states at the corresponding fermi surface . the eq.([delta_nb ] ) yields & = & + _ bf_0^bb . in our case @xmath67 . separately for neutron and proton we have [ general_mu ] (    c +    ) & = & (    cc + f_0^nn & f_0^np + f_0^pn & + f_0^pp    ) (    c +    ) , + where the superscripts @xmath68 and @xmath69 denote neutron - neutron and neutron - proton quasiparticle interaction . @xmath70 and @xmath71 denote the density of states at neutron and proton fermi surfaces respectively @xcite . for pion exchange , in snm , @xmath72 @xcite , from eq.([general_mu ] ) , we have , _ n&=&n_n , where @xmath73 .",
    "similarly , one can determine @xmath74 .",
    "motivated by @xcite , we define f_l^b&=&_bf_l^bb. evidently in snm , @xmath75 , and therefore , we write @xmath76 @xcite , [ mudmu ] = dp_f . here",
    "@xmath25 and @xmath26 are given by eq.([f0_pi ] ) and ( [ f1_pi ] ) .",
    "to calculate @xmath77 , it is sufficient to let @xmath78 in the right hand side of eq.([mudmu ] ) . with the constant of integration",
    "adjusted so that at high density @xmath79 , eq.([mudmu ] ) upon integration together with eq.([f0f1pi ] ) yield & = & _ f - g_s + & & , where @xmath80 and @xmath81 .",
    "the calculations of lps for other mesons is straightforward .",
    "however , for brevity , we do not present corresponding expressions for @xmath6 and @xmath7 mesons but quote their numerical values in table([table-1 ] ) .",
    "the numbers cited above are relevant for normal nuclear matter density @xmath82 . for the coupling constants we adopt the same parameter set as designated by * m0a * in @xcite .",
    "interestingly , individual contribution to lps of @xmath6 and @xmath7 meson are large while sum of their contribution to @xmath83 is small due to the sensitive cancellation of @xmath84 and @xmath85 as can be seen from table([table-1 ] ) .",
    "such a cancellation is responsible for the nuclear saturation dynamics @xcite .",
    "numerically , @xmath86 is approximately @xmath46 times smaller than @xmath87 .",
    ".dimensionless landau parameters and chemical potential at @xmath88 .",
    "note that , @xmath56 , @xmath57 are the dimensionless isoscalar lps . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "knowing the `` isovector '' combination of the lps , one can determine nuclear symmetry energy .",
    "the symmetry energy is defined as the difference of energy between the neutron matter and symmetric nuclear matter is given by the following expression @xcite & = & _ _ 3=0 . in terms of lps , the symmetry energy can be expressed as @xcite [ symm_energy ] = ( 1 + 2f^_0 ) , where @xmath89 is the isovector combination of dimensionless landau parameters @xmath56 @xcite .",
    "deriving @xmath90 , one can find symmetry energy .",
    "numerically at saturation density ( @xmath88 ) we obtain @xmath91 mev .",
    "so relatively small contribution to @xmath13 comes from one pion exchange diagram @xcite",
    "in this paper , we calculate rflps within the framework of rflt . for the description of dense nuclear system cheft is invoked . although our main focus was to estimate the contribution of pions to rflps , for comparison and completeness we also present results for the @xmath6 and @xmath7 meson .",
    "it is seen that the pionic contribution to the flps are significantly larger compared to the combined contributions of @xmath6 and @xmath7 meson .",
    "thus any realistic relativistic calculation for the flps should include @xmath9 meson which necessarily implies going beyond the mf calculations . the lps what we determine here are subsequently used to calculate exchange and symmetry energy of the system .",
    "finally we evaluate two loop ring diagrams with the same set of interaction parameters and show that the numerical results are consistent with those obtained from the flt .",
    "it might be mentioned here that in the present calculation we have ignored nucleon - nucleon correlations which might be worthwhile to investigate .",
    "it should , however , be noted that inclusion of correlation energy would require the readjustment of the coupling parameter so as to reproduce the saturation properties of nuclear matter .",
