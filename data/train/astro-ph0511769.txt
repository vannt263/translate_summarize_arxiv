    "jets are one of the fundamental components of radio - loud active galactic nuclei ( agn ) .",
    "although different in detail , they all share the property of being relativistic on the parsec scale and of carrying magnetic fields that may be dynamically important . observations of their non - thermal synchrotron radiation , in fact , require the presence of a magnetic field and the high degree of polarization observed indicates the presence of some large scale structure in the field .",
    "theoretical investigations require , therefore , a relativistic mhd description of such objects . in this effort , recent numerical simulations",
    "@xcite have turned out as efficient investigation tools in understanding many aspects of the jet evolution .",
    "this , in turn , justifies recent and new efforts to extend existing gas - dynamical godunov - type codes to the relativistic regime , see , , , and the extensive review by .",
    "in this perspective , we extend the recently derived relativistic hydrodynamical hllc riemann solver @xcite to the magnetic case , with vanishing normal component of the magnetic field .",
    "the novel numerical scheme is then applied to the propagation of relativistic jets in presence of toroidal magnetic fields .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in  [ sec : equations ] we give the relevant relativistic mhd equations , in  [ sec : hllc ] we briefly review the approximate riemann solver . finally , in ",
    "[ sec : tests ] we discuss the astrophysical jet applications .",
    "the motion of a magnetized , ideal relativistic fluid is governed by the system of conservation laws @xcite @xmath0 where @xmath1 and @xmath2 is the vector of conservative variables with components given , respectively , by the laboratory density @xmath3 , the three components of momentum @xmath4 and magnetic field @xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) and the total energy density @xmath7 .",
    "@xmath8 are the fluxes along the @xmath9 direction ; for @xmath10 one has @xmath11\\ , , \\quad\\ ] ] where @xmath12 is the total pressure , @xmath13 is the thermal ( gas ) pressure and @xmath14 is the fluid three - velocity .",
    "the lorentz factor is denoted with @xmath15 .",
    "expressions for @xmath16 and @xmath17 follow by cyclic permutations of the indexes .    introducing the primitive flow variables @xmath18 , one has @xmath19 where @xmath20 and @xmath21 are , respectively , the rest - mass density and specific enthalpy of the fluid .",
    "an additional equation of state is necessary to close the system ( [ eq : rmhd_eq ] ) . throughout the following",
    "we will assume a constant @xmath22-law , with specific enthalpy given by @xmath23 where @xmath22 is the constant specific heat ratio .",
    "godunov - type codes @xcite are based on a conservative formulation where laboratory density , momentum , energy and magnetic fields are evolved in time . on the other hand , primitive variables , @xmath18 , are required for the computation of the fluxes ( eq . [ eq : fluxes ] ) and more convenient for interpolation purposes .",
    "this task requires the solution of the nonlinear equation @xmath24 where @xmath25 , @xmath26 .",
    "equation ( [ eq : press_fun ] ) follows directly from equation ( [ eq : cons_var_e ] ) together with ( [ eq : cons_var_m ] ) .",
    "since , at the beginning of a time step @xmath7 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 are known quantities , both @xmath15 and @xmath13 may be expressed in terms of @xmath29 alone from @xmath30 * and from the equation of state ( [ eq : eos ] ) using @xmath31*. equation ( [ eq : press_fun ] ) can be solved by any standard root finding algorithm .",
    "once @xmath29 has been found , the lorentz factor is easily found from ( [ eq : c2p_m ] ) , the thermal pressure from ( [ eq : eos ] ) and velocities are found by inverting equation ( [ eq : cons_var_m ] ) : @xmath32 finally , equation ( [ eq : cons_var_d ] ) is used to determine the proper density @xmath20 .",
    "in the traditional godunov approach @xcite , the conservation laws ( [ eq : rmhd_eq ] ) are advanced in time by solving , at each zone interface @xmath33 , a riemann problem with initial condition axis as the normal direction . ]",
    "@xmath34 where @xmath35 and @xmath36 are the left and right edge values at zone interfaces .",
    "the exact solution to the riemann problem for the relativistic mhd equations has been recently derived by . as in the classical case ,",
    "a seven - wave pattern emerges from the decay of an initial discontinuity separating two constant states .",
    "the resulting structure can be found by iterative techniques and it can be quite involved .    for the present purposes , however , we will be concerned with the special case where the component of magnetic field normal to a zone interface vanishes . under this condition ,",
    "a degeneracy occurs where the tangential , alfvn and slow waves all propagate at the speed of the fluid and the solution simplifies to a three - wave pattern . in this special situation ,",
    "the relativistic hllc approximate riemann solver originally derived for the gas - dynamical equations by and recently extended to the relativistic regime by ( paper i henceforth ) , can still be applied with minor modifications .",
    "this statement stems from the fact that both state and flux vectors on either side of the tangential discontinuity ( denoted with the @xmath37 superscript ) retain the same form as in the non - magnetized case :    @xmath38    @xmath39    where we can still set @xmath40 .",
    "total pressure and normal velocity are continuous across the middle wave , i.e. @xmath41 , @xmath42 .",
    "the method of solution is thus entirely analogous to the strategy shown in paper i and we will not repeat it here .",
    "the two additional components related to the presence of transverse magnetic field are decoupled from the rest and can be solved without additional complications .",
    "once @xmath43 has been found , in fact , we use the jump conditions to get @xmath44 from the pre - shock states .",
    "finally , we need an estimate for the outermost right and left - going fast wave speeds , @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "these two signal velocities may be found by exploiting the characteristic decomposition of the rmhd equation , extensively analyzed by and . in the general case ,",
    "the fast and slow magneto - sonic waves satisfy a quartic equation solvable by means of numerical and analytical methods , e.g. . for vanishing normal component of the magnetic field , however ,",
    "the two roots corresponding to the degenerate slow waves have the trivial solution @xmath47 , whereas the fast speeds satisfy the following quadratic : @xmath48 with @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the speed of sound . the solutions of ( [ eq : eigenvalues_eq ] ) are used to provide suitable guesses for the outermost signal velocities in our hllc riemann solver . as in paper",
    "i , we set @xmath51 where @xmath52 ( @xmath53 ) is the smallest ( biggest ) fast wave speed .",
    "spatial and temporal discretization of equations ( [ eq : rmhd_eq ] ) is based on the second - order hancock predictor step already described in paper i. for the sake of conciseness we will not repeat it here .      as an illustrative test , we consider an initial discontinuity separating two constant left and right states given by @xmath54     zones .",
    "the final integration time is @xmath55 ; the courant number is @xmath56 .",
    "the solution is comprised of a left - going fast rarefaction , a right - going tangential and shock waves moving close to each other.,width=434 ]    the domain is the interval @xmath57 $ ] covered with @xmath58 uniform computational cells .",
    "the ideal equation of state ( [ eq : eos ] ) is used with @xmath59 .",
    "figure ( [ fig : sod1 ] ) compares the result computed with the hllc solver with the analytical solution * ( available from ) * , at the final time @xmath55 .",
    "the breakup of the discontinuity results in a left - going fast rarefaction wave and a thin shell of high density material bounded by a tangential discontinuity and a gasdynamical shock propagating to the right .",
    "the total pressure and magnetic field are continuous through the contact and the shock wave , respectively .",
    "all discontinuities are correctly captured , with satisfactory resolutions : the tangential discontinuity and the shock smear out over @xmath60 and @xmath61 zones , respectively .",
    "small overshoots appear at the tail of the rarefaction fan . a similar ,",
    "perhaps more pronounced behavior is shown in the results by who used a linearized , roe - like riemann solver .",
    "the relative error in the thin shell is @xmath62 for both pressure and density .",
    "we now turn our attention to the propagation of a relativistic magnetized jet in cylindrical coordinates @xmath63 . for the sake of comparison ,",
    "we have implemented three models already discussed in literature .",
    "the first setup , denoted with @xmath64 , is model @xmath65 of ( k99 henceforth ) , the second and third setups , @xmath66 and @xmath67 , are taken from models @xmath68 and @xmath69 of ( l05 henceforth ) , respectively .",

    "we have carried two set of simulations : the first one employing the hllc approximate riemann solver described in ",
    "[ sec : hllc ] and the second one adopting the hll scheme , also used in l05 .    .",

    "the top panel shows the density logarithm in the hllc ( upper half ) and hll ( lower half ) runs .",
    "the bottom panel shows the magnetization parameter in the hllc ( upper half ) and hll ( lower half ) runs .",
    "the final integration time is the same one as in l05.,width=434 ]    models @xmath64 and @xmath66 are characterized by a high poynting flux @xmath98 and tend to develop prominent nose cones due to the strong magnetic pinching .",
    "this is evident from fig .",
    "( [ fig : s1jet ] ) and ( [ fig : s2jet ] ) , where the upper ( lower ) portion of each gray scale image refers to the hllc ( hll ) approximate riemann solver at @xmath99 and @xmath100 , respectively .",
    "the nose cone appears as the extended high pressure region bounded by the terminal conical shock ( mach disk ) and the bow shock . at the mach disk ,",
    "the beam is strongly decelerated and magnetic tension wards off sideways deflection of shocked material into the cocoon .",
    "the magnetization parameter , defined as @xmath101 , is particularly strong in the cone above the symmetry axis .",
    "as pointed out by k99 , morphological properties are prevalently dictated by the ratio of the kinetic energy flux to the poynting flux , @xmath102 , which determines the magnetization of shocked gas behind the terminal shock .",
    "an alternative parameter ( l05 ) is the ratio of the magnetic energy density to the rest mass , @xmath103 : extended nose cones tend to form for low @xmath104 ( high @xmath105 ) , whereas familiar cocoon structures appear for high values of @xmath104 ( low @xmath105 ) , regardless of the jet magnetization parameter @xmath93 .",
    "values of @xmath105 are reported in table [ tab : ic ] .",
    "computed for three different resolution runs : low ( @xmath106 ) , medium ( @xmath107 ) and high ( @xmath108 ) .",
    "the hllc runs are shown using , respectively , dotted , dashed and solid lines ; for the hll we use plus signs , triangles and squares.,width=434 ]    the positions of the reverse shocks for the hll and hllc runs are , respectively , @xmath109 and @xmath110 in model @xmath64 , @xmath111 and @xmath112 in model @xmath66 . however , the most striking difference between the hll and hllc schemes is the jet propagation speed obtained from model @xmath64 .",
    "indeed , at @xmath99 the head position in the hllc run is @xmath113 to be compared with a value of @xmath114 obtained from the hll integration .",
    "note that the final integration time is not the same as in k99 , where the simulation ends at a later time , @xmath115 , yielding a head position value of @xmath116 , apparently more consistent with the hll run .",
    "however , in order to further investigate these discrepancies , we carried out an additional set of simulations at half and twice the resolution .",
    "figure ( [ fig : ko_pos ] ) plots the jet head position as function of time for the three resolutions in consideration : low ( @xmath117 ) , medium ( @xmath107 ) and high ( @xmath118 ) .",
    "the hll scheme achieves the same convergence of the hllc scheme only at high resolution , whereas the propagation speeds in the hllc runs show to be by far less sensitive to the grid size .    .",
    "the final integration time is the same one used in l05 .",
    "the meaning of the gray scale images in the same as in fig .",
    "( [ fig : s1jet ] ) and ( [ fig : s2jet]).,width=434 ]    this disagreement is remarkably reduced in the second model @xmath66 , where the hll runs shows a slightly higher propagation speed , but again more evident in model @xmath67 , although with an opposite trend .",
    "once more we ascribe this behavior to resolution effects , based on the fact that the same model in l05 with twice the resolution ( i.e. @xmath119 zones per beam radius instead of @xmath91 ) shows stronger affinities with the hllc integration presented here .    when the hllc solver is employed , the backflow turbulent patterns in the cocoon are better defined than with the hll scheme , where the larger numerical viscosity inhibits the formation of small scale structure at lower resolution .",
    "this is corroborated by a simple qualitative comparison with the results of l05 , who used twice the resolution employed here and the hll solver .",
    "the small scale structural details provided by the hllc approach appear to be almost equivalent even at half the resolution .",
    "this consideration together with the convergence test previously shown confirms , indeed , that the ability to describe tangential and shear waves largely improves the quality of solution , particularly in the multidimensional case .",
    "finally , we remind that the computational cost of the hllc scheme over the traditional hll riemann solver is less than @xmath120 and we believe that this largely justifies its use in godunov - type codes .",
    "numerical simulations of relativistic magnetized jets with toroidal magnetic fields have been presented .",
    "the three models considered show formation of conspicuous nose cones and jet confinement with increasing magnetization . the morphological properties favorably compare with the results of previous investigators .",
    "simulations have been conducted by using the recent relativistic hydrodynamics hllc solver by mignone & bodo , opportunely extended to the special case of vanishing normal component of magnetic field . in order to assess the validity of the new algorithm ,",
    "simulations have been directly compared with the traditional hll riemann solver @xcite .",
    "it is found that the hllc approach largely improves the quality of solution over the hll scheme by considerably reducing the amount of numerical viscosity .",
    "this is manifested in a sharper resolution of fine scale structures in proximity of shear and tangential flows .",
    "furthermore , convergence tests at different resolutions have shown that , with the hllc scheme , the jet head position has little dependence on the grid size .",
    "this is a remarkable property for a shock - capturing scheme and has to be consolidated through further numerical testing .",
