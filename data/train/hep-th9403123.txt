    "one of the earliest manifolds considered for a superstring target space was a blown - up orbifold @xcite . in this case",
    "the orbifold ( the `` z - orbifold '' ) was constructed by modding out a torus of 6 real dimensions by a group isomorphic to @xmath4 .",
    "this group action has 27 fixed points leading to 27 isolated quotient singularities in the resulting space . algebraic geometry then tells us that these singularities can be smoothed away ( in particular , `` blown - up '' ) to give us a  manifold . in this context",
    "the orbifold itself is little more than a step in the construction of a smooth  manifold .",
    "shortly afterwards it was realized @xcite that string theory is well - behaved ( at least in some sense ) on the orbifold itself before the smoothing process .",
    "it was also noticed that calculations of such quantities as the field - theory version of the euler characteristic when performed on the orbifold agreed with the same geometric calculation on the target space _ after _ blowing up .",
    "it is as if the string theory `` knows '' about the blow - up even before it has been performed .",
    "thus the euler characteristic formula of @xcite can be taken as one of the earliest indications of the power of `` stringy '' geometry . by `` stringy '' or `` quantum '' geometry we mean geometry as indicated via field theory analysis of a string theory rather than direct analysis of the geometry of the string s target space .    in many respects toroidal orbifolds such as",
    "the z - orbifold provide attractive models for string target spaces .",
    "the torus itself is a little too trivial whereas a general  manifold can render many calculations very difficult .",
    "the toroidal orbifold may be thought of as a good compromise since the field theory view of the quotient singularities is rather straight - forward .",
    "having said this , proponents of  manifolds would say that the blown - up version of the orbifold is more general  the orbifold itself is just a limiting case of the blown - up orbifold .",
    "thus people who study orbifolds are artificially singling out a special class of string target spaces .",
    "we will argue below that this point of view might be a little unfair .    before discussing orbifolds any further we should first state clearly what class of spaces we are studying .",
    "orbifolds were introduced many years ago @xcite . as originally defined an orbifold",
    "may be taken to be a space ( an algebraic variety ) whose only singularities are locally of the form of quotient singularities . in the context of this paper",
    "we will only consider ``  orbifolds '' , that is an orbifold which is a complex algebraic variety of complex dimension @xmath5 with holonomy group @xmath6 .",
    "the class of  orbifolds clearly covers the case of a complex @xmath5-torus divided by a discrete group @xmath7 and indeed any @xmath5-fold divided by @xmath2 .",
    "as an example of an orbifold _ not _ of the form @xmath8 for @xmath9 a smooth  manifold consider again the case of the z - orbifold .",
    "clearly the z - orbifold is of the form @xmath8 but if we blow - up just one of the 27 quotient singularities we destroy this property .",
    "the resultant space still has 26 quotient singularities locally of the form @xmath10 however and is thus an orbifold .",
    "string theory is still well - defined on this space indicating that it is the local rather global form of the singularities that is important .",
    "we therefore believe that the mathematicians definition of an orbifold should also be the appropriate definition in string theory .    in order to focus on purely local aspects of quotient singularities",
    "we will restrict ourselves to isolated singularities in this paper .",
    "this is done mainly for reasons of clarity and it should be straight - forward to generalize most of what is said in this paper to non - isolated quotient singularities .",
    "we also assume that any smooth manifold appearing in this paper should be khler .",
    "let us now clarify the term `` blowing - up '' .",
    "a simple example of a blow - up , which will be the main focus of this paper , acts to alter slightly a singular space so that it becomes smooth .",
    "the singularity is thus resolved .",
    "a blow - up is a particular kind of resolution of singularity and so we require more explanation of the term .",
    "it is actually easier to describe the reverse process of `` blowing - down '' .",
    "that is we take a smooth manifold and change it so that it becomes singular .",
    "given a  manifold @xmath11 with a metric there are two types of continuous changes we consider .",
    "firstly , deformation of complex structure of @xmath11 ( i.e. , what geometers would normally call simply a deformation ) and secondly deformation of the khler form on @xmath11 .",
    "it turns out that the blowing - down process corresponds to a deformation of the khler form .",
    "the moduli space of khler forms on @xmath11 has a cone structure as is easy to see  if @xmath12 is a valid hermitian metric on @xmath11 then so is @xmath13 for @xmath14 a positive real number .",
    "as we approach the wall of the khler cone of @xmath11 from the interior , some algebraically embedded subspace of @xmath11 or @xmath11 itself will shrink down acquiring zero size on the wall .",
    "if it is a subspace that shrinks down rather than the whole of @xmath11 , we say that this subspace has been _ blown - down _ when we reach the wall .",
    "thus the orbifolds in classical geometry which may be blown - up into smooth  manifolds lie at the edge of the khler cone as depicted in figure [ fig : oc ] .    at first sight",
    "the analysis of the string theory on an orbifold appears to have a similar structure to that suggested by the description of classical geometry above .",
    "one can build the @xmath0=(2,2 ) superconformal field theory corresponding to the orbifold and find the dimension of the moduli space in which it lives by counting the truly marginal operators preserving the @xmath0=(2,2 ) world - sheet supersymmetry in the theory .",
    "when one does this one finds the correct number for the dimension of the moduli space of the _ maximally resolved _ orbifold . by maximally resolved we mean that the most blow - ups have been done to resolve the singularities consistent with the @xmath15 ( vanishing first chern class ) condition .",
    "thus it appears that the some of the marginal operators in the orbifold conformal field theory correspond to blow - up modes .",
    "indeed , as we will show later in this paper they are in natural one - to - one correspondence .",
    "this is not the full story however .",
    "when one analyzes the structure of the moduli space around an orbifold point , the conformal field theory picture and the classical geometric picture do not appear to agree @xcite .",
    "in particular it is not clear how a cone - like structure appears in the moduli space spanned by the marginal operators when one looks at a neighbourhood of the orbifold point .",
    "this problem was effectively resolved in @xcite where it was shown how cone structures did appear naturally in the moduli space of @xmath0=(2,2 ) superconformal field theories as one moves sufficiently far away from the orbifold point .",
    "this allows one to recover the classical picture of a blow - up in the conformal field theory language once one has moved sufficiently far in moduli space .",
    "the problem is that the cone structure found in @xcite is in complete disagreement with the picture of the orbifold point in figure [ fig : oc ] !",
    "the situation discovered in @xcite may be stated roughly as follows . given a certain class of theories ( corresponding to  manifolds which may be realized as hypersurfaces in toric varieties ) the moduli space of suitably defined khler forms ( to be precise the `` algebraic measures '' of @xcite ) is isomorphic to @xmath16 .",
    "one can now subdivide this space into a fan - like structure consisting of cones with their apex at the origin of @xmath16 .",
    "this decomposition divides the moduli space into so - called `` phases '' .",
    "one of these cones will be congruent to the khler cone of the  manifold .",
    "the other cones appear to be best thought of as associated to other geometries .",
    "one of the other geometries is an orbifold .",
    "in such a picture , the orbifold point itself lies in the deep interior of the orbifold cone .    in figure [",
    "fig : os ] we show how this phase picture modifies the classical picture of figure [ fig : oc ] .",
    "only part of the fan is shown for clarity . in order to reach the orbifold point",
    "one must leave the  khler cone .    the above state of affairs",
    "was clarified in @xcite by thinking about correlation functions arising from string theory on a  manifold , @xmath11 .",
    "the string theory is given in terms of a non - linear  with target space @xmath11 .",
    "some correlation functions in this theory are prone to instanton corrections which correspond to rational curves .",
    "the precise form of the instanton correction is as a power series in @xmath17 where @xmath18 and @xmath19 is the area of a curve representing the @xmath20th generator of @xmath21",
    ". if all the rational curves are sufficiently large then this power series will converge ( assuming a non - zero radius of convergence ) . in this case",
    "there is no problem analyzing the . by varying the khler form on @xmath11 ,",
    "we can shrink some of the rational curves on @xmath11 .",
    "as we do this we may eventually move outside the region of convergence of instanton power series . now",
    "the analysis of the  is unclear .",
    "it might happen however that the field theory can be interpreted more simply in terms of a different target space .",
    "this is exactly what happens in the case of an orbifold .",
    "when we are in the orbifold phase , correlation functions may be determined in terms of the orbifold theory perturbed in some way ( actually by twist fields , see for example @xcite ) .",
    "the orbifold cone marks roughly , in some way , the region of convergence of this new perturbation theory .",
    "even though the phase picture naturally divides up the moduli space into regions with different geometrical interpretations one should not take the word `` phase '' too seriously  a generic path from one phase region into another will not encounter a theory that is singular in any way . thus one can choose one geometrical interpretation and `` analytically continue '' it into other regions . in terms of the correlation functions above this analytic continuation is quite literal .",
    "thus , for example , we might describe the whole moduli space in terms of the  region .",
    "this is what we will do later on this paper to determine the precise conformal field theory picture of blowing - up .",
    "this will allow us to make contact with figure [ fig : oc ] by redefining the khler form .",
    "it should be emphasized however that this is an artificially biased approach in favour of smooth target spaces .",
    "one could equally choose the orbifold region to analytically continue over the whole space .",
    "it is in this sense that the  proponent has no claims being `` more general '' than the orbifold proponent .",
    "it should also be noted that there are examples where at least one of the proponents would fail , i.e. , there are  manifolds which can not be blown down to orbifolds and orbifolds which can not be blown up into smooth  manifolds .",
    "it is therefore important to always consider both methods of approach .    in section [ s : cl ]",
    "we will review the classical theory of blow - ups of singularities formed by quotients by abelian groups in a language that will be useful later in the paper . in section [ s : tw ]",
    "we will look at the same problem from the conformal field theory point of view and derive a direct map correspondence between the two approaches . in section [ s : ms ]",
    "we will analytically continue the  region into the orbifold region to measure the size of the blown - up parts of the orbifold .",
    "finally in section [ s : ex ] we will study some details of the structure of the moduli space of blowing - up codimension 2 singularities .",
    "let us first outline the concept of a ( khler ) blow - up . in much of what follows we will consider the case where @xmath11 is not compact .",
    "in particular @xmath11 will correspond to @xmath1 for some group @xmath2 .",
    "since we are only interested in the local behaviour of string theory around a quotient singularity this will suffice . given a khler manifold @xmath11",
    ", one can vary the sizes of algebraically embedded submanifolds of @xmath11 by varying the khler form on @xmath11 .",
    "in particular one might have a divisor ( i.e. , an algebraically embedded codimension one subspace ) which can be shrunk down to an arbitrarily small size while keeping other divisors ( not in the same homology class ) at finite size .",
    "such a divisor is _",
    "exceptional_. if one shrinks an exceptional divisor down to zero size then the limit of @xmath11 in this process may be singular .",
    "we say then that @xmath11 has been blown - down along this exceptional divisor .",
    "as we shall see , if one blows down along the right combination of divisors then the resultant singularity is a quotient singularity .",
    "thus we have described the reverse of the process of blowing - up a quotient singularity to obtain a smooth manifold @xmath11 . the singular point set in an orbifold when blown - up appears to be replaced by an exceptional divisor ( which may be the sum of many irreducible divisors ) in @xmath11 .",
    "we will now review how any singularity locally in the form of @xmath1 where @xmath2 is a discrete _ abelian _ group can be blown - up .",
    "we will focus on the situation of an isolated singularity ( i.e. , the origin is the only fixed point of any non - trivial element of @xmath2 ) but the following method also can be used in the non - isolated case .",
    "we also want to consider the case in which we do not affect the canonical class so that the resultant space , if smooth , will be a manifold .",
    "a simple holonomy argument shows that in this case , @xmath7 . to do the blowing - up we will use the language of toric geometry",
    "it is beyond the scope of this article to explain toric geometry  for that the reader is referred to @xcite or @xcite .",
    "see also @xcite for an early account of this in the physics literature . to fully understand the following arguments one should consult these references but it is hoped that the following be self - contained if one requires only a schematic understanding .",
    "a toric variety @xmath22 is a @xmath5-dimensional complex space specified by a fan @xmath23 . in this paper ,",
    "the fan @xmath23 is a collection of _ simplex_-based cones ( together with their faces ) in @xmath24 .",
    "one also puts a lattice structure in the same space , i.e. , @xmath25 .",
    "this lattice is denoted @xmath26 .",
    "@xmath22 is compact if and only if @xmath23 spans the whole of @xmath24 .",
    "there is a correspondence between @xmath27-codimensional algebraic subspaces of @xmath22 and @xmath27-(real)-dimensional subcones of @xmath23 .",
    "thus , divisors in @xmath22 correspond to 1 dimensional cones , i.e. , rays in @xmath23 .    in figure [",
    "fig : tg ] we show an example of a fan @xmath28 describing a toric variety @xmath29 .",
    "( we use @xmath28 rather than @xmath23 for this particular example to fit in with notation used below . ) in this case @xmath28 lives in @xmath30 and consists of three 3-dimensional cones .",
    "the configuration of these cones is shown by slicing @xmath28 by a hyperplane @xmath31 as shown in the figure . since @xmath28 does not fill @xmath30",
    ", @xmath29 is not compact .",
    "@xmath29 contains a divisor , @xmath32 , which corresponds to the ray indicated in the figure . in this case",
    "the other 3 rays correspond to divisors not homologically distinct from @xmath32 .",
    "we now discuss the toric picture of blowing up . in the context of this paper , a blow - up consists of adding a divisor with one or more irreducible component into @xmath22 .",
    "thus we must add rays to the fan @xmath23 .",
    "this process is easily visualized in terms of the intersection of @xmath23 with @xmath31 . to add an irreducible divisor to @xmath11 ,",
    "draw a point in the interior of @xmath33 and then draw lines from it to form a triangulation of the @xmath34-dimensional simplex ( or simplices ) in which the point lies .",
    "thus the simplex containing the new point is subdivided into a set of simplices each having this new point as a vertex .",
    "this simple case is known as a _ star subdivision _ of the fan .",
    "a sequence of many star - subdivisions gives a blow - up whose exceptional divisor consists of many irreducible divisors .",
    "we can illustrate an example of the process of a single star - subdivision by the toric variety pictured in figure [ fig : tg ] .",
    "in this case we consider @xmath29 to be the blown - up toric variety from a variety @xmath22 .",
    "the exceptional divisor is @xmath32 .",
    "the process is shown in figure [ fig : b1 ] where we draw only the intersection of the fan with @xmath31 rather than the whole fan itself .",
    "now let us consider the questions of when @xmath22 in singular and when @xmath22 has trivial canonical class . for both of these questions we need to look at the lattice structure @xmath26 and the way in which it relates to @xmath23 .",
    "consider following each ray in @xmath23 out from the origin of the fan , which is itself a lattice point , until we reach another lattice point .",
    "mark this point in @xmath24 .",
    "the condition for trivial canonical class is simple to state  all these points must lie in a hyperplane rather than only @xmath35 for some @xmath36 .",
    "see , for example , the discussion of @xmath37-cartier divisors in @xcite.this situation will not arise for the class of examples we consider here . ] .",
    "we will imagine @xmath31 to be this plane from now on .",
    "now consider each simplex in @xmath33 .",
    "each @xmath34-dimensional simplex forms a @xmath5-dimensional simplex by including the origin of the fan as another vertex . a volume ( or length or area etc . ) of this @xmath5-simplex may be calculated where the volume is defined from those of @xcite .",
    "] in terms of units defined by the lattice @xmath26 .",
    "@xmath22 is smooth if and only if each such simplex has volume @xmath38 .",
    "thus we see from figure [ fig : b1 ] that if @xmath29 is smooth then @xmath22 is singular since the tetrahedron subtended by the triangle in @xmath33 has volume @xmath39 .",
    "now all we need to complete our discussion of resolving quotient singularities is the form in which @xmath23 represents a quotient singularity .",
    "it turns out that a singularity of the type @xmath1 for abelian @xmath2 is represented by a fan where @xmath33 consists of just one @xmath34-dimensional simplex .",
    "suppose we consider the space @xmath40 with coordinates @xmath41 and @xmath42 with coordinates @xmath43 away from the origin are the coordinates on the _ algebraic torus_. ] .",
    "let @xmath44 be the vertices of the simplex @xmath33 which have coordinates @xmath45 the coordinates above are defined with respect to the lattice @xmath46 , i.e. , the points with integer coordinates are the points in @xmath46 .",
    "this implies that the @xmath47 s are integers given our definition of @xmath31 above .",
    "we now state that the transformation between @xmath22 and @xmath40 is given by @xmath48 the above relationships are sufficient to determine @xmath2 for a given set of @xmath47 s .",
    "suppose an element @xmath49 acts on @xmath40 as @xmath50 where @xmath51 are rational numbers , @xmath52 .",
    "the relations ( [ eq : r1 ] ) imply that @xmath53    we can now blow - up @xmath22 by subdividing the simplex with corners @xmath54 with points that lie in the intersection of this simplex with @xmath26 .",
    "such a blow - up will not affect the canonical class .",
    "such a point @xmath55 is given by @xmath56 and that @xmath55 has integer coordinates . from ( [ eq : gint ] )",
    "we see that each point @xmath55 is given by @xmath57 such that @xmath58    as a simple example , suppose @xmath59 and @xmath23 is given by @xmath60 this implies that @xmath2 is isomorphic to @xmath4 and is generated by @xmath61 i.e. , @xmath62 for @xmath63 .",
    "in fact figure [ fig : b1 ] shows the blow - up of this singularity .",
    "the point added , @xmath64 has coordinates @xmath65 and is given from ( [ eq : hkbb ] ) by @xmath66 .    as a more complicated example consider the case where @xmath59 and @xmath67 and is generated by @xmath68 in this case @xmath69 the points , @xmath55 , added to @xmath33 to form the blow - up together with the corresponding element of @xmath2 are @xmath70    a blow - up of this @xmath71 quotient singularity is shown in figure [ fig : b2 ] .",
    "note that there is more than one way to subdivide this triangle to add in the points @xmath55 .",
    "this corresponds to the fact that there is more than one way of blowing up this singularity .",
    "no matter how we do the subdivision we will always divide the big triangle @xmath33 into 11 triangles subtending volumes of @xmath72 .",
    "this means that all the blow - ups completely resolve the @xmath71 singularity to a smooth space .",
    "note that in the case of the @xmath71 , the complete resolution required an exceptional divisor with 5 irreducible components which correspond to @xmath73 .",
    "each of these components is independent with regards to homology .",
    "the precise geometry of these 5 divisors depends on the triangulation of @xmath33 and figure [ fig : b2 ] shows just one possibility .",
    "it is a matter of combinatorics to show that this process of blowing up will always fully resolve a singularity of the form @xmath74 where @xmath75 is abelian .",
    "it is interesting to note however that this is not the case for more than 3 dimensions . consider the case of @xmath76 given by the generator @xmath77 in this case @xmath78 the tetrahedron @xmath33 subtends a 4-simplex with the origin with volume @xmath79 implying , as expected , that @xmath22 is singular , but this time there are _ no _ points in @xmath26 inside this tetrahedron on which one might subdivide .",
    "thus there is no toric resolution of this singularity preserving vanishing canonical class .",
    "in fact d.  morrison @xcite has shown that the results of @xcite may be used to show that there is no resolution of this singularity of _ any _ kind which preserves @xmath15 .",
    "let us now discuss the way in which the khler form controls the blow - up .",
    "the khler form , @xmath80 , may be expanded as @xmath81 where @xmath82 and the @xmath83 s form basis of @xmath84 . imposing the condition that all curves , surfaces , etc .",
    ", have positive volume will put restrictions on the allowed range of values of @xmath85 to give the khler cone . in the simple case of a curve having homology class @xmath86 , the area will be @xmath87",
    ".    we may also calculate the size of any divisor , @xmath88 , as follows .",
    "suppose that @xmath88 is a generator of @xmath89 and is dual to a cycle with homology class @xmath90 .",
    "we then have ( with suitable normalizations of volume ) @xmath91 where @xmath92 represents the intersection form on @xmath11 .",
    "thus we see that the volume of a divisor is given by an expression more complicated than that for curves and it depends on the intersection numbers .",
    "suppose we take a smooth manifold , @xmath11 , and blow - down an exceptional divisor to form an isolated quotient singularity .",
    "let @xmath93 represent the irreducible components of the exceptional divisor which we assume are some of the generators of @xmath89 and are thus dual to @xmath94 .",
    "the part of @xmath89 not spanned by @xmath93 may be thought of as the homology which descends from the covering space of our quotient singularity and this has no intersection with @xmath93 .",
    "thus we see that for @xmath95 we have @xmath96 .",
    "thus the orbifold is described by points corresponding to @xmath97 on the edge of the khler cone .",
    "it is important to realize however that the parameters @xmath98 do _ not _ independently control the sizes of @xmath93 .    as an example consider a @xmath99 singularity .",
    "there are two components of the exceptional divisor , @xmath100 and @xmath101 , such that @xmath102 let us put @xmath103 , where @xmath104 is the part of the khler form given by cohomology elements away from the quotient singularity .",
    "we then have @xmath105 we also have an algebraic curve homologous to @xmath106 which has area @xmath107 and another curve within @xmath101 with area @xmath108 .",
    "thus we have constraints on the khler cone @xmath109 , and @xmath110 .",
    "these are sufficient to give positive volumes to @xmath100 and @xmath101 .",
    "finally in this section let us introduce the notion of a `` dual curve '' .",
    "we have seen that given a component @xmath88 of the exceptional divisor , the associated khler form gives the volume of the divisor itself in terms of an expression like ( [ eq : sd ] ) . if there were a curve in @xmath11 whose homology class was dual to that of @xmath88 , the description of its area in terms of the khler form expansion would be more direct .",
    "thus when thinking of performing a blow - up by switching on components of the khler form it is probably best to think in terms of the dual curves growing rather than the exceptional divisor itself .",
    "this will be implicit in much of what follows .",
    "note that @xmath88 might be any element of @xmath89 and so in general the dual must be thought as a rational combination of algebraic curves . in the @xmath99 example above , the khler cone imposes the condition @xmath111 .",
    "thus there are no actual curves dual to @xmath100 or @xmath101 since they would have negative area .",
    "in this section we will review and study the quotient singularities from the point of view of the conformal field theory of string propagating on the singular target space .",
    "the reader is referred to @xcite for example for a more complete discussion .",
    "we should also point out that we will not consider the case of nontrivial `` discrete torsion '' in the sense of @xcite in this paper .",
    "the field theory on @xmath8 is studied in terms of the theory on the smooth covering space @xmath9 .",
    "in addition to the @xmath2-invariant states of @xmath9 , the @xmath8 theory also has `` twisted '' states .",
    "these may be thought of as open strings in @xmath9 whose ends are identified by the element @xmath49 .",
    "such a state is said to be in the @xmath112-twisted `` sector '' . as we shall see , it is the twisted states which correspond to blow - up modes .",
    "let us analyze the chiral ring of the conformal field theory which is expected @xcite to correspond to the cohomology ring of the target space .",
    "it is not too hard to see that the @xmath2-invariant elements of the cohomology of @xmath9 will be precisely the untwisted modes on @xmath8 and so the twist fields are somehow `` extra '' cohomology on @xmath8 . since the counting of chiral fields should not change under a deformation of a theory , the count for a blown - up orbifold should be the same as the orbifold itself .",
    "thus , the chiral fields which are twist fields must count elements of cohomology which are generated during the blowing - up process .    in conformal field theory language ,",
    "the deformations are done by truly marginal operators which , in the context of @xmath0=(2,2 ) theories , takes a particularly simple form .",
    "that is , an action @xmath113 may be deformed into @xmath114 as @xmath115 the @xmath116 and @xmath117 are ( anti)chiral superfields with @xmath118 charges ( left , right ) equal to @xmath119 and @xmath120 respectively . as is well - known , the  interpretation of these superfields are as elements of @xmath121 and @xmath122 and thus as deformations of khler form and complex structure respectively . in order to focus on blow - ups , which are to be regarded as deformations of the khler form",
    ", we will concentrate on the fields @xmath116 .",
    "let us consider the spectrum of chiral twist - fields in an orbifold @xmath1 with only the origin as an isolated fixed point .",
    "consider an element @xmath49 which acts on @xmath40 with coordinates @xmath123 as in ( [ eq : gact ] ) subject again to the condition that @xmath52 .",
    "one can then show ( see , for example , @xcite or @xcite ) that the @xmath112-twisted state associated with the origin has charge @xmath124 where @xmath125 thus , in order to obtain twisted marginal operators associated to blow - up modes we require precisely equation ( [ eq : tmm1 ] ) from the previous section .",
    "that is , the classification of twisted marginal operators associated to blow - ups has exactly matched the determination of irreducible components of the exceptional divisor .",
    "we have thus arrived at what might be called the `` ( twist - field)-divisor '' map .",
    "since the classifications are isomorphic one can naturally identify a natural one - to - one correspondence .",
    "e.g. , for the @xmath71 example one may consider figure [ fig : b2 ] and equation ( [ eq : z11w ] ) where the last column in ( [ eq : z11w ] ) now represents the group element by which the twist - field is twisted .",
    "if we consider the @xmath126 singularity in the last section which had no @xmath15 resolution then we see that in the language of conformal field theory , there are no twisted marginal operators associated with the fixed point . thus geometry and conformal field theory again agree .",
    "actually what we have done thus far is little more than paraphrase the work of @xcite where the `` _",
    "monomial_-divisor mirror map '' was introduced .",
    "the rle of monomials in a landau - ginzburg theory has been replaced by twist fields in the mirror of that theory .",
    "in fact , it can be seen from the example studied in @xcite that the equivalence of monomials in a landau - ginzburg theory and twist - fields in the mirror arises naturally and can be traced back to the work of @xcite .",
    "all we have done in this paper is to free the formalism of @xcite from references to the global space as a whole so we need concentrate only on the quotient singularities locally .",
    "we can now continue our study of the conformal field theory of blow - ups by continuing to copy results from the monomial - divisor mirror map to the ( twist - field)-divisor map .",
    "in particular we can study quantitatively the relationship between the coefficients @xmath127 in ( [ eq : defm ] ) and exactly the size and shape of the exceptional divisor .",
    "the question of determining the size and shape of the exceptional divisor immediately forces one to face questions to do with quantum verses classical geometry .",
    "one knows that if the coefficients @xmath127 are small then the exceptional divisor will be small and we are thus dealing with lengths possibly near the planck scale .",
    "this is the point at which we must address the issues raised in the introduction concerning the phase picture of the moduli space .",
    "we are going to try to interpret the orbifold phase in terms of sizes of exceptional divisors and thus are biasing ourselves in favour of the smooth  phase . in order to do this",
    "we must begin in the  phase , i.e. , when the singularity is blown - up so that all radii are large and we can make contact with classical notions of length .    within the  phase there is a natural definition of khler form .",
    "this is given by the ``  measure '' defined in @xcite .",
    "it can not be emphasized too strongly that this is _ not _ the same khler form that was used in the introduction to draw figure [ fig : os ] .",
    "the khler form used in the introduction was abstractly defined and treats each phase equally .",
    "see @xcite for a more complete discussion of these two khler forms .",
    "the khler form derived from the  arises as follows .",
    "suppose , @xmath59 and , for simplicity , that @xmath128 . let us consider the 3-point function between three chiral fields @xmath129 , @xmath130 and @xmath131 .",
    "assuming we have a purely geometrical interpretation , @xmath11 , of the theory , we can associate these fields to elements of @xmath132 and thus divisors @xmath88 , @xmath133 and @xmath134 .",
    "it can then be shown that @xcite @xmath135 where @xmath136 is a holomorphically embedded @xmath137 in @xmath11 and @xmath138 is a monomial in the variables @xmath139 .",
    "we define the parameters @xmath139 by @xmath140 where the khler form , @xmath80 , on @xmath11 has been expanded as in ( [ eq : jex ] ) .",
    "the antisymmetric tensor , `` @xmath101-field '' , on @xmath11 is also an element of @xmath141 on @xmath11 and is similarly expanded to give @xmath142 .",
    "we have implicitly used the same normalization @xmath143 as in @xcite .    in the neighbourhood of a large radius limit ,",
    "the expansion ( [ eq:3p ] ) is sufficiently single - valued to allow a determination of @xmath80 from ( [ eq : jex ] ) .",
    "this then allows us to work out the size of any divisor or , to be more precise , the area of the dual curve as in section [ s : cl ] .",
    "this is the sense in which the conformal field theory data , i.e. , the three point functions @xmath144 can be used to `` measure '' sizes within @xmath11 .",
    "we will now discuss the relationship between the coupling constants @xmath127 in ( [ eq : defm ] ) and the parameters @xmath145 .",
    "this will tell us the precise way in which the twisted marginal operators perform the blow - up of the orbifold .",
    "in general there is a very complicated relationship between the @xmath127 s and @xmath145 s but in this paper we will study the situation when only one component is added to the exceptional divisor at a time .",
    "this is the picture illustrated in figure [ fig : sq ] . in terms of toric geometry",
    "this resolution consists of a sequence of star - subdivisions of the fan corresponding to the orbifold .",
    "one should note that not all resolutions can be generated by a sequence of star - subdivisions and that we have thus lost some generality in the following discussion .",
    "the reader might wish to verify that the resolution in figure [ fig : b2 ] can be obtained by a sequence of star - subdivisions , e.g. , @xmath146 .",
    "consider the situation in which @xmath147 and suppose each field @xmath148 corresponds to a ray in a fan @xmath23 .",
    "let the label @xmath149 denote which point we are going to add to give our star subdivision and let the field @xmath129 be the corresponding twisted marginal operator .",
    "in this case there will be a plane @xmath31 as discussed in the previous section intersecting this ray and its neighbours ( but not necessarily all the rays in the fan ) .",
    "associate the position vectors @xmath150 as the points of intersection between @xmath31 and each ray .",
    "there will then be some minimal relationship @xmath151 for the set of rays @xmath152 which give the vertices of the minimum dimension simplex in @xmath31 which is being star - subdivided .",
    "the integers @xmath153 are positive and have highest common factor 1 .",
    "we then define @xmath154 the hypothesis of the monomial - divisor mirror map @xcite then tells us @xcite that @xmath155 for @xmath156 .",
    "the above expansion is expected to converge for @xmath156 , that is , @xmath157 .",
    "this is the sense in which we have had to go to the large - radius limit to make contact with classical geometry .",
    "note that , as one would expect , this limit is achieved by adding in a large amount of twist field to the action , i.e. , having a large coefficient @xmath158 .",
    "the situation explored in @xcite was for the mirror of a landau - ginzburg theory . in this situation",
    "the form ( [ eq : lgm ] ) made sense  each @xmath148 corresponds to a monomial in the superpotential of the mirror . in a general orbifold theory , it is not clear how to write an action in the form ( [ eq : lgm ] ) .",
    "since we expect the analysis of a blow - up to not depend on global properties of a manifold however we claim that some version of the above analysis can be performed for any abelian quotient singularity .",
    "that is , we may obtain some `` normalized '' variable @xmath159 which controls the size of a blow - up at the large radius limit in terms of the coefficient of the marginal operator @xmath158 .",
    "one should also note that it is by use of the mirror map that we are effectively putting a connection on the bundle of fields over the moduli space . when a marginal operator is used to perturb a theory a finite distance in moduli space",
    ", one should specify the way in which the marginal operator itself is changing along this path . in the context of landau - ginzburg theories",
    ", one can write down a superpotential in terms of parameters  the coefficients within the superpotential . by varying these parameters",
    "one moves a finite distance in moduli space .",
    "if one identifies fields with the monomials in the superpotential one is also implicitly defining the way in which these fields transform along the path .",
    "thus in this paper we are asserting that the twist - fields transform the same way in which the monomials do in the landau - ginzburg - type theory .",
    "once we have the relationship ( [ eq : mdmm ] ) we may use the local geometry of the moduli space to determine the form of the @xmath160 term .",
    "again we will use mirror symmetry to motivate our argument .",
    "it was conjectured in @xcite and demonstrated in @xcite that given a pair of mirror spaces , @xmath11 and @xmath161 , with the khler form on @xmath11 being given by the above notation then @xmath162 where @xmath163 is a ( 3,0)-form on @xmath161 and @xmath164 are elements of @xmath165 . in the case",
    "that @xmath161 is represented by a landau - ginzburg theory with superpotential ( [ eq : lgm ] ) we can consider a period @xmath166 to be a function of the variables @xmath167 . in this case , the periods satisfy a set of coupled linear fuchsian partial differential equations known as the _ picard - fuchs _ equations . in @xcite it was shown that this set of differential equations were of the hypergeometric type studied by gelfand et al in @xcite .",
    "however , in @xcite these differential equations were written down purely in terms of the toric data of @xmath11 .",
    "this means that in determining the periods as a function of @xmath167 , no direct reference need be made to the geometry of @xmath161  only that of @xmath11 .",
    "this is exactly what we want in the context of this paper since we are not directly interested in the structure of @xmath161 .",
    "the picard - fuchs equations will have many solutions but the singularity structure of the equations dictates that the solutions are classified by their behavior near @xmath168 .",
    "in fact , the equation ( [ eq : mdmm ] ) is sufficient to determine precisely which two periods are required for the ratio in ( [ eq : mmap ] ) .",
    "we are now in a position to track the entire process of a blow - up of a singularity .",
    "the general solution of the picard - fuchs equation is rather awkward to handle and so we will study only the decoupled situations when we need only consider ordinary differential equations ( although it should be noted that a full multiparameter system can been studied @xcite ) .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that if all the components of @xmath80 were held at @xmath169 except for one , @xmath145 , the the picard - fuchs equations decoupled leaving an ordinary differential equation of which two of the solutions would provide the ratio for ( [ eq : mmap ] ) .",
    "it is also the case that if a point is not included in the triangulation of @xmath33 then that point plays no rle in the formulation of the picard - fuchs equations .",
    "thus , if we consider the process of a star - subdivision on a point , we may consider this process decoupled from the rest of the system both before the star - subdivision is included ( since then the point is not in the triangulation ) and when the large @xmath80 limit of this process has been taken .    in summary",
    "then we consider the following process .",
    "consider an orbifold which is at its large radius limit , i.e. , all components of the khler form not associated with blow - ups are infinite . then blow - up the singularities by a sequence of processes as follows : take a single star - subdivision and slowly take that component of the khler form ( i.e. , the area of the dual curve ) to infinity . in this way",
    "only one component of the khler form will be finite at any given time and we will only ever have to deal with ordinary differential equations .",
    "we now state the ordinary differential equations required ( see @xcite for more details ) . given a star - subdivision on @xmath170 given by ( [ eq : star ] ) then @xmath171 where @xmath172 is the required period .",
    "it is trivial to show that @xmath173 is a solution and we take this to be the period in the denominator of ( [ eq : mmap ] ) .",
    "we can write down another solution if we impose that one of the @xmath174 s is equal to 1 .",
    "let us denote the set @xmath152 with this element removed by @xmath175 . with a little effort , using the ideas in @xcite and that @xmath176 , one can show that @xmath177 is a solution .",
    "the integration path is taken along the imaginary line deformed around the origin to the left and the series is obtained by completing this path to the right if we impose the condition @xmath178 . hence from ( [ eq : mdmm ] ) we deduce that the precise khler form is given by @xmath179    the region of convergence of the series in ( [ eq : hz ] ) is given by @xmath180 or @xmath181 where @xmath182    we can _ analytically continue _",
    "@xmath183 into the region @xmath184 in the usual way by closing the integration path in ( [ eq : hz ] ) to the left .",
    "we then obtain @xmath185 where @xmath186 and @xmath187 .",
    "note that if we normalize @xmath188 for @xmath189 , then we have @xmath190 .",
    "this means we can think of @xmath191 as the twist - field coupling constant .    without the blow - up , @xmath192 and thus @xmath193",
    "this means that before blowing up we have @xmath194    this value of @xmath145 agrees with classical geometry .",
    "that is , the boundary of the khler cone at which @xmath195 is precisely where the classical orbifold lives .",
    "this may be thought of in terms of the commutativity of the following diagram : @xmath196 in this diagram , @xmath9 is a smooth  manifold , @xmath2 is a symmetry by which we can mod out and @xmath197 represents the conformal field theory associated to @xmath9 .",
    "the quotients taking us from the top row to the bottom row are effected geometrically on the left and in terms of field theory ( i.e. , twist - fields ) on the right .",
    "the arrow on the top line represents a  interpretation which is straight - forward for large @xmath9 whereas the arrow in the bottom line represents the `` analytic continuation '' of a  to small radii ( of exceptional divisor ) .",
    "it is important to notice that we have only established the commutativity of ( [ eq : com1 ] ) when the orbifold is at large radius limit away from the quotient singularities .",
    "that is , all the components of the khler form associated to untwisted elements of @xmath198 are infinite .",
    "it is an interesting question to see if commutativity still holds away from this limit .",
    "that is , given a finite sized orbifold , do we get @xmath195 for the khler form analytically continued from the large blow - up limit .",
    "this is addressed in @xcite .",
    "it is not yet clearly understood what the geometrical meaning of the value @xmath199 at the orbifold point is .",
    "let us discuss more carefully the way in which we have performed the analytic continuation in obtaining ( [ eq : hzc ] ) .",
    "the fuchsian differential equation ( [ eq : hyp1 ] ) has singularities at @xmath200 and thus we expect non - trivial monodromy of the solutions around these points .",
    "we may think of @xmath159 ( together with @xmath201 ) as parametrizing a @xmath137 in the compactified moduli space of conformal field theories .",
    "we show this @xmath137 in figure [ fig : p1 ] .",
    "if we wish to ascribe a single value of @xmath202 to each point on the @xmath137 , we need to define branch cuts .",
    "around @xmath168 we have infinite monodromy familiar from the symmetry @xmath203 of the quantum field theory .",
    "this tells us that there should be one branch line coming out from this point .",
    "we effectively perform this cut by imposing @xmath204 which may be thought of as the @xmath178 condition implicit in ( [ eq : hz ] ) .",
    "the other end of this branch cut is @xmath205  the point at the edge of the convergence of the series .",
    "the analytic continuation then implies a branch cut from @xmath206 .",
    "this cut was imposed by the condition @xmath187 .",
    "these branch cuts are shown in figure [ fig : p1 ] .",
    "one would naturally expect the smallest values of @xmath145 to be close to the orbifold point @xmath193 . from ( [ eq : hzc ] ) however we see that for small values of @xmath191 , our branch cut imposes the condition @xmath207 .",
    "this indicates strongly that @xmath207 over the entire @xmath137 .",
    "it also indicates that all the @xmath145 s may be non - negative over the whole moduli space .",
    "this may be checked in simple examples but there is no general proof of this fact yet .",
    "thus it would appear that no measurements of negative distance ( area , etc . )",
    "are possible in this scenario .",
    "the monodromy around @xmath201 is finite of order @xmath208 .",
    "we may therefore remove the branch cut locally by taking a finite cover branched around this point in the moduli space .",
    "thus the orbifold point may be thought of as a @xmath209-quotient singularity itself within the moduli space .",
    "note that the structure of the singularity in the moduli space is generally different from the the singularity in the target space although there are similarities .",
    "there will be a @xmath209-quotient singularity in moduli space for each irreducible component of the exceptional divisor of the target space quotient singularity .",
    "these orbifold points in the moduli space may also be seen to arise in terms of `` quantum symmetries '' @xcite .",
    "it is known that for string theory with a target space in the form of an orbifold @xmath8 where @xmath2 is a cyclic group , then @xmath2 is part of the symmetry group of the theory and orbifolding by this group will retrieve the string with target space @xmath9 .",
    "the symmetry group @xmath2 acts nontrivially on the twist fields and thus on the tangent bundle of the moduli space at the orbifold point giving a quotient singularity in the moduli space .",
    "note however that this argument relies on global symmetries .",
    "if we return to the example of the z - orbifold , we have a @xmath4 quantum symmetry .",
    "this is destroyed if any twist - field marginal operator is switched on to resolve one of the 27 quotient singularities . thus if we consider switching on a second twist - field to blow - up another fixed point we can not use the quantum symmetry argument to find the structure of the moduli space in the vicinity of this region .",
    "our analysis of the differential equations above however tells us that there is indeed a @xmath4 quotient singularity in the moduli space for each of the 27 blow - ups .",
    "in this section we will illustrate the results of the last few sections by considering the simplest set of quotient singularities  namely those of the form @xmath3 given by the action @xmath210 this corresponds to a matrix @xmath211 the lattice points in @xmath33 are thus given by @xmath212 corresponding to marginal operators in the @xmath213-twisted sector .",
