    "the integration of agricultural commodity and financial markets has been largely criticized by both a growing body of economic literature ( see e.g. @xcite ) and political consideration @xcite . according to those critics",
    "the overflow of capital invested in the commodity markets feeds a destabilizing speculation , and a tightening of market regulation is then claimed . while the empirical evidence of international food price spikes and volatility driven by financial markets is robust ( see @xcite and references therein ) , its mechanisms and potential drawbacks for production risk management are unexplored .",
    "this paper analyzes the effects of market integration on conventional production planning and farm liquidity risk management policies within a stylized equilibrium model of production , trade and consumption of an agricultural commodity where financial and agricultural commodity markets are partially integrated .",
    "we suggest that the time to produce  is the fundamental parameter governing risk allocation and production dynamics and should be considered in designing more efficient production schemes and distribution policies aimed at improving liquidity risk - sharing .",
    "the stylized model assumes that the production of an agricultural commodity is risky because farmers resources allocation and production decisions are irreversible and taken over a horizon @xmath0 , the `` time to produce '' . on the other hand financial investors trade over a much shorter horizon @xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) and possess an information advantage contingent on the exogenous shocks affecting production of the commodity .",
    "in our model , investments on contingent contracts play a role similar to investments on physical storage and the zero net supply condition is assumed to hold on average .",
    "actually , as discussed by @xcite , any hedging policy , by requiring margin capital and liquidity , will in general have adverse effects on liquidity needs .",
    "in particular the inefficiency of long - term industry s risk management are documented and discussed in @xcite , in @xcite , @xcite and in @xcite .",
    "motivated by the above remarks , in the model at hand it is assumed that long - term investors face a liquidity constraint : at the end of the production cycle the farm goes bankrupt and its production is lost if the profit resulting from selling the production at market price is not sufficient to break even .",
    "consequently , while price levels continue to depend on the joint allocation decisions of financial investors and producers , profits from financial hedging can not be used to soften the liquidity constraint faced by long - term investors . in practice",
    "this constraint reproduces a segmentation of the capital market which is empirically well documented : most of the profits in commodity market trading remunerate professional investors while farm hedging investments are low .    in the model",
    "the commodity equilibrium price is thus set by the clearing of the market in an economy populated by an heterogeneous set of producers exposed to idiosyncratic and systematic shock components , by consumers described by an exogenously specified demand curve and by an extra demand or supply contribution generated by financial agents .",
    "a comparative statics exercise proves that this model can reproduce many interesting stylized facts .",
    "first of all it is possible to prove that the long - term investors modify the production choice due to the effects of financial trading .",
    "in addition the financial investors make profit by exploiting their informational advantage .",
    "finally , the model shows a progressive increase in the volatility of the produced quantity and a growth in default risk with an increasing market integration .",
    "our model highlights that the major issue in farm risk management is the necessity to alleviate the effects of credit constraints to reduce price pressure on producers and consumers .",
    "correspondingly , public subsidization of agricultural investments can be interpreted as a necessary ( possibly inefficient ) response to restore the balance of capital flows from short - term to long - term investors .",
    "a rationalization for the farm policy actions similar to our has been discussed also in @xcite .",
    "our approach , however , is more focused on the description of farmers production planning decisions and our findings indicate that a rational production planning and liquidity risk management must classify different productions and financing opportunities considering the time to produceconstraint faced by different participants .    the paper is organized as follows : in section [ mat ]",
    "we define the model and discuss its innovations with respect to the past literature . in section [ calc ] we present and discuss numerical results and their dependence on exogenous parameters .",
    "section [ res ] is devoted to a discussion about the assumptions made within the model , while section [ conc ] to conclusions .",
    "a simplified ( analytical solvable ) version of the model is provided in the appendix , together with some techinical aspects of the self consistent calculation procedure adopted .",
    "the model at hand is based on many simplifying assumptions in common with other rational expectations competitive storage models , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the intrinsic information asymmetry introduced in the model ( discussed in section  [ model ] ) can be seen as a reduced form of the long - standing hedging pressure theory of commodity prices that dates back to @xcite , @xcite and , more recently , to @xcite .",
    "market efficiency and its implications on commodity futures prices dynamics dates back to the seminal contribution of @xcite . in of perfect ( infinitely liquid and frictionless ) capital markets",
    ", farmers could borrow sufficient capital to invest in the production and simultaneously take a position in the contingent contract markets to hedge the production risk .",
    "the relation between liquidity constraints and productivity in farming and agricultural industries is grounded on a vast literature , see e.g. @xcite and references therein .",
    "the influence of biological production lags on agricultural commodity price dynamics has been investigated in literature by means of the well known cobweb model , for example in the case of u.s .",
    "beef markets ( see @xcite ) . a thorough analysis of the relation between credit and liquidity constraints , farm investment policies and optimal subsidization policies could be found in @xcite .    in the equilibrium analysis described in @xcite it is shown that the presence of producers liquidity constraints induces mean reversion in futures prices , while government price subsidies , if actively hedged by producers , lowers futures risk premia and reduces price volatility . differently from that approach , here we explicitly model a multiplicity of producers which can default due to price dynamics . in this way we can analyze the equilibrium relations between liquidity restrictions , producers default and commodity prices . in this respect ,",
    "our model bears some similarities with the model discussed in @xcite where limits to arbitrage generate limits to hedging by producers .",
    "production , trade and consumption of a real good are explicitly modeled .",
    "the price is set by the equilibrium between the supply and demand when the market clears .",
    "in particular , the equilibrium price is determined by the agents interaction , their operational timeline and market clearing conditions .",
    "hereafter agents are idealized to the extent that farmers can only produce real goods and financial investors can only trade goods whose payoff is contingent to the production outcome of the real one .",
    "the two types of agents are considered separated from one another in order to study the corresponding sector s returns . however",
    ", a real agent could behave as a combination of the two idealized ones . as will be commented below considering a real agent ( for example a farmer that can both produce and trade )",

    "* farmers * are the producers of the commodity goods in the economy .",
    "we consider an ensemble of @xmath3 farmers , all producing the same food commodity , which only are allowed to _ sell _ the produced goods .",
    "a single farmer produces a quantity @xmath4 of this commodity investing an amount of capital @xmath5 .",
    "we consider that each farmer incurs in a fixed cost which do not depend on the quantity produced .",

    "thus , the profit of a farmer will be : @xmath9 + producers are assumed to be risk neutral and , for the sake of simplicity , a zero rate discounting is applied .",
    "extensions of the model to both fixed cost farmers dependency and to finite rate discounting are straightforward and will be discussed elsewhere . within our framework",
    "the effect of individual risk aversion would be mitigated by the existence of a multitude of heterogeneous producers .",
    "+ if the actual profit reaped by the farmer is negative the farmer defaults and the amount produced is distributed among lenders and does not contribute to the total quantity of goods brought to the market at time @xmath0 . notice that in our model the liquidity constraint , that , as we will see is crucial in determining the production output volatility , is introduced by modeling the farmers default .",

    "the variance @xmath92 is a good indicator of the level of risk faced by a farmer in producing the real commodity , and the model is able to reproduce the counterintuitive evidence that the financialization amplifies the variability of returns on commodity production .",

    "( [ eq : ep ] ) ) . the financial investor s return does not change significantly , while the farmer s return @xmath84 , not surprisingly , shows a sharp reduction of return as an effect of a suboptimal production planning : naive farmers pay the maximum rent to financial investors which are better informed .    within our model financialization of trade",
    "is driven by the asymmetric impact of market integration .",
    "on the one hand the financial investor increases the investment opportunity and raises the expected return on investment , while on the other the liquidity constraint which limits the aggregate investment capacity of the farmer implies that their return volatility grows sharply with @xmath29 .",
    "in other terms the improved efficiency of production risk sharing exacerbates the effect of the liquidity constraints which worsen the financing conditions of real investment and raise the default rates .",
    "this is best understood by analyzing equilibrium production .      as the degree of market integration @xmath29 increases , the production quantity ( shown in figure  [ fig : quantity ] ) remains fairly constant , while its volatility increases with @xmath29 .",
    "the default rate in this market is approximately @xmath94 and almost constant with market integration , while the default rate variance increases with @xmath29 as a combined effect of the increase in the return volatility and the fitness fluctuation , @xmath42 .",
    "note that the longer the time to produce the larger the fluctuations in returns from real investment , thus an efficient subsidization approach should consider a redistribution of wealth which accounts for the differential levels of liquidity stress suffered by producers , intermediaries and last minute - traders with differential time to produce .    to better identify the relation between farmers default and production volatility @xmath95 , in figure  [ fig : varq ] we compare two different market conditions corresponding to different levels of exogenous parameters ( details reported in the figure caption ) : one characterized by a large default rate @xmath96 , the other characterized by a smaller @xmath96 , in which subsidization effects are simulated by artificially raising the level of consumers demand ( which is equivalent to a softening of the liquidity constraint ) . as can be seen the financialization effect , i.e. the relative increase in production volatility with increasing market integration @xmath29 is much larger in the market with higher default rates .",
    "notice that within our model the main channel of propagation of instability induced by financialization is the lack of an efficient hedging channel able to transfer the liquidity risk .",
    "thus , the most dangerous fluctuations are not price fluctuations but rather those induced by fluctuations in default rates .",
    "a thorough analysis of the policy implications under similar assumptions is discussed in @xcite , where it is suggested that subsidies are determined by the necessity to reduce default rates to improve welfare . within our equilibrium solution",
    "all those conclusions continue to hold .",
    "it is however important to point out an important distinction : in our model defaults are driven by liquidity rather than credit risk .",
    "this is consistent with the well known observation that in most of case subsides are given to land owners which are well collateralized and have a reduced exposure to credit risk .      in our model farmers",
    "are not allowed to invest in the financial market and financial investors do not invest in real production .",
    "it is important to notice , however , that this restriction does not impose any limit in the diversification opportunities of liquidity risk affecting production .",
    "the farmer can reduce the default probability only by reducing the amount of capital invested in the production of the real commodity .",
    "however , this farmer decision will not have any consequence on aggregate sector quantities .",
    "assume that a representative investor is allowed to invest both in real and financial activities by maximizing the risk return trade - off on those activities .",
    "the asymmetric impact of market integration on the returns of real production and financial trading would imply that the optimal allocation in financial investment would increase with @xmath29 and the investment in production would be depleted . changing the identity of the investors would not modify the clearing equation ( [ eq : clearing ] ) .",
    "for this reason the global relations of quantity , price and farmers survival fraction ( and their volatility ) would remain unaffected by any farmer hedging policy .",
    "the key condition is that the liquidity constraint applies only to real investment and generates capital market segmentation which is not mitigated by financial hedging .    despite our model",
    "does not address the welfare implications of the market imperfections , it suggests that an improvement in the liquidity risk management should be one of the main goals of optimal market regulations , taxation schemes and public subsidization programs and correspondingly that such policies should enhance liquidity risk sharing between producers , intermediaries and traders investing in commodity markets .",
    "stated that the longer is the investment horizon , in presence of large fitness uncertainty , the larger is the liquidity risk , optimal intervention schemes could be introduced to classify different agents according to their time to produce .",
    "in this paper we have shown that , at least in principle , in commodity markets dominated by uncertainty and characterized by a time to produce @xmath0 , at a certain critical level of market integration a financial trader operating with a deterministic strategy can take advantage of his on time  action to realize a profit . upon the introduction of a diffusive market stochastic fitness ,",
    "we demonstrate that this is the consequence of a competitive equilibrium generated by the asynchronous decisions of the two agents participating in market clearing : producers are forced by their production cycle to anticipate market decisions when programming their production strategy , while financial investors can instantaneously react to current prices .",
    "in fact , the long production cycle @xmath0 operates as a credit and liquidity risk multiplier on farmers , which , along with liquidity constraints on production , makes the long - term ( production ) investments much riskier than short - term ( financial ) investments : due to the presence of liquidity constraints on long - term producers , the integrated spot commodity and financial market is inefficient in sharing the risk between market participants .",
    "the model shows that more _",
    "elastic _ markets tolerate _ larger _ values of market integration . on the contrary negative effects of market financialization are more pronounced on those markets characterized by long production cycles and@xmath97or large market fitness volatility . among negative effects",
