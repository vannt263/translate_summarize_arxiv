    "the paradigm of cosmic inflation  @xcite ( for recent reviews see e.g.  @xcite ) has proven very successful in resolving the flatness and horizon problems of the early universe and in explaining the absence of relics from early phase transitions . however , the connection to particle physics is still unclear .",
    "one possibility to establish such a connection is provided by sneutrino hybrid inflation  @xcite , where the superpartner of one of the right - handed neutrinos involved in the seesaw mechanism  @xcite plays the role of the inflaton field . in sneutrino hybrid inflation , a large vacuum energy density is present which drives inflation and the sneutrino direction in field space has an almost flat potential suitable for slow - roll inflation . the right - handed ( s)neutrinos obtain their large masses after the `` waterfall '' phase transition which ends hybrid inflation . inflation in this scenario is closely linked to the physics generating the small neutrino masses via the seesaw mechanism .    another attractive connection between the seesaw mechanism and early universe cosmology is the possibility of generating the observed baryon asymmetry of the universe via the out - of - equilibrium decays of the right - handed ( s)neutrinos in leptogenesis  @xcite ( for recent reviews see  @xcite ) . for calculating the produced baryon asymmetry , the knowledge of the phase of ( p)reheating after inflation is in general mandatory , since it may lead to the nonthermal production of right - handed ( s)neutrinos and since it determines the reheat temperature , which in turn governs the possibility of thermal ( s)neutrino production . in most inflation models",
    "the nonthermal ( s)neutrino production must arise from the decays of the inflaton field . in sneutrino hybrid inflation , on the other hand , the inflaton itself is a right - handed sneutrino , which means that this intermediate step is skipped and the sneutrino inflaton field after inflation may directly dominate the universe and , when it decays , most efficiently produce the baryon asymmetry and reheat the universe .",
    "in previous works , leptogenesis after sneutrino inflation has been studied in the context of chaotic sneutrino inflation  @xcite which however requires a quite heavy sneutrino with a mass of about @xmath0 gev and correspondingly very small yukawa couplings in order to realize a low reheat temperature as suggested by gravitino and similar constraints in supersymmetric cosmology .",
    "furthermore , chaotic sneutrino inflation with a quadratic potential for the inflaton gives rise to a comparatively large tensor - to - scalar ratio of @xmath1 . on the other hand , sneutrino hybrid inflation  @xcite , as typical for hybrid - type inflation scenarios  @xcite , predicts a much smaller ratio @xmath2 and is thus clearly distinguishable from chaotic sneutrino inflation by future observations ( e.g.  by the planck satellite ) .",
    "recently , it has been shown that sneutrino hybrid inflation  @xcite belongs to a wider class of hybrid - like inflation models , dubbed `` tribrid inflation '' in  @xcite , which are very suitable for being embedded into supergravity ( sugra ) theories with the sugra @xmath3-problem solved by either a shift symmetry  @xcite or a heisenberg symmetry  @xcite in the khler potential .",
    "while the sneutrino was a gauge singlet in  @xcite , it has been demonstrated in  @xcite that it may be embedded into a grand unified theory ( gut ) representation , e.g.  into a * 16 * -plet of so(10 ) , establishing a possible link between sneutrino hybrid inflation and left - right symmetric guts .",
    "nonthermal leptogenesis after sneutrino hybrid inflation , on the other hand , was only briefly discussed in  @xcite for an example set of model parameters .    in this paper",
    ", we therefore investigate in detail the conditions under which inflation , with primordial perturbations in accordance with the latest wmap results , as well as successful nonthermal leptogenesis can be realized simultaneously within the sneutrino hybrid inflation scenario .",
    "we point out which requirements successful inflation and leptogenesis impose on the seesaw parameters , i.e.  on the yukawa couplings and the mass of the right - handed ( s)neutrino , and derive the predictions for the cmb observables in terms of the right - handed ( s)neutrino mass and the other relevant model parameters .",
    "our results are meant as a guideline for the construction of explicit particle physics models incorporating sneutrino hybrid inflation and baryogenesis via nonthermal leptogenesis .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section  [ framework ] we introduce the sneutrino hybrid inflation scenario in a simple setup .",
    "section  [ inflation ] is dedicated to the inflationary phase and the predictions for the cmb observables . in section  [ leptogenesis ]",
    "we discusses the reheating of the universe after inflation and the production of the baryon asymmetry of the universe via nonthermal leptogenesis .",
    "we conclude in section  [ infl_lepto ] by combining our results from inflation and leptogenesis to highlight the preferred ranges of the model parameters .",
    "we will discuss sneutrino hybrid inflation and subsequent baryogenesis via nonthermal leptogenesis in an extension of the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) with conserved r - parity , where three additional right - handed ( s)neutrinos acquire large masses after the `` waterfall '' phase transition ending inflation . the superpotential defining our framework",
    "is given by @xmath4 where the @xmath5 ( the index @xmath6 denotes the different generations ) are gauge singlet superfields describing the heavy right - handed ( s)neutrinos and where the reduced planck scale is given by @xmath7 .",
    "the canonically normalized imaginary parts - problem as was demonstrated in  @xcite . ]",
    "@xmath8 of the respective scalar components are inflaton candidates as will be described below . @xmath9 and @xmath10 are su(2)@xmath11-doublet superfields which contain the standard model leptons and up - type higgs , respectively .",
    "the yukawa coupling term of @xmath12 with the higgs and lepton doublet , i.e.  the second term in eq .  , allows to identify @xmath12 with the right - handed neutrino superfield .",
    "@xmath13 and @xmath14 are two additional gauge singlet superfields . here",
    "the canonically normalized real part @xmath15 of the scalar component of @xmath13 is the so - called `` waterfall '' field responsible for ending inflation .",
    "the f - term of @xmath14 , the so - called `` driving superfield '' , provides the large vacuum energy density that drives inflation .",
    "the scalar component of @xmath14 is fixed at zero during inflation by sugra corrections ( cf .",
    "section [ sugra ] ) and does not affect the inflationary dynamics . furthermore , we assume @xmath16 and @xmath17 to be real coupling parameters for simplicity .    the form of the superpotential eq .",
    "is motivated as follows : the latter two terms generate the scalar potential suitable for inflation . in the false vacuum with large values of @xmath8 and @xmath15 stabilized at zero , the large vacuum energy @xmath18 drives the quasi - exponential growth of the scale factor in inflation .",
    "once the slow - rolling fields @xmath8 fall below a critical value , the negative contribution to the squared mass of @xmath15 from the term @xmath19 starts dominating over the positive contribution from the terms @xmath20 .",
    "therefore , @xmath15 becomes tachyonic which triggers the `` waterfall '' ending inflation as @xmath15 acquires a non - zero vacuum expectation value ( vev ) .",
    "after inflation , close to the global minimum of the potential where @xmath21 and @xmath22 and where the large vacuum energy contribution vanishes , the fields @xmath8 and @xmath15 perform damped oscillations accounting for a matter dominated universe .",
    "the field which decays last and finally dominates the universe is generically the right - handed sneutrino with the smallest mass and smallest yukawa couplings , since it only decays via the second term in eq .",
    "proportional to @xmath23 .",
    "this decay reheats the universe which thus enters its radiation dominated epoch . for illustration ,",
    "we have plotted a typical scalar potential resulting from the scenario described above in fig .",
    "[ hybridpotential ] . for further details see e.g.  ref .",
    "@xcite .     typical f - term scalar potential resulting from the model of eq .   for the scalar components of @xmath24 set to zero . for the plot ,",
    "we have used example parameters @xmath25 and @xmath26 . ]    the first three terms in eq .   describe the mssm with masses for the additional right - handed neutrinos generated after inflation . in particular the term",
    "@xmath27 generates mass terms for the heavy ( s)neutrinos as @xmath15 acquires its non - zero vev .",
    "the vev of @xmath15 in the true minimum is governed by the fourth term in eq .  .",
    "in a realistic scenario , we would expect inflation to end by a phase transition , i.e. the @xmath15 field to be a non - singlet under some symmetry group .",
    "might be replaced by a different combination of fields , i.e.  by @xmath28 , in order to form a singlet under the symmetry group .",
    "the symmetry could , e.g. , be a unifying gauge symmetry or a family symmetry . ] a realization within the context of guts can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite , and the idea of relating the `` waterfall '' of hybrid inflation to the breaking of a family symmetry was discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite . for simplicity ,",
    "we keep @xmath13 a gauge singlet here .",
    "finally , the ellipsis represent possible higher dimensional operators .",
    "we note that a superpotential of the form given in eq .",
    "can be realized in an explicit model with discrete symmetries , as has been shown in  @xcite .",
    "these discrete symmetries distinguish between the gauge singlet fields of eq .  .",
    "the parameters which appear in eq .  , and which govern our framework , can be understood as follows :    * the * phase transition scale * @xmath29 is the vev of the scalar component of the @xmath13 superfield after the phase transition ending inflation and is the mass scale relevant for inflation . *",
    "the parameter @xmath30 determines the * seesaw scale * which corresponds to the mass of the lightest right - handed neutrino @xmath31 in the true vacuum of the theory . * the * vacuum energy parameter * @xmath17 fixes the the vacuum energy density with regard to the phase transition scale . *",
    "the * effective yukawa coupling * @xmath32 is linked to the light neutrino masses .",
    "we will be working in a sugra framework with sugra corrections stabilizing the scalar components of @xmath14 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 during inflation and with a symmetry in the khler potential that guarantees tree - level flat @xmath8 directions .",
    "this solves the @xmath3-problem of sugra inflation .",
    "the details of such a sugra framework are discussed in section  [ sugra ] . however , to illustrate the underlying physics more clearly we first focus on a global supersymmetry ( susy ) model and take the features mentioned above for granted .    in order to produce the cp - violation necessary for leptogenesis we work with three ( s)neutrino generations .",
    "assuming that the right - handed neutrinos are strongly hierarchical , i.e.  one of them is significantly lighter than the other two , the scalar components of the latter superfields can be stabilized at their minima before the final 60 e - folds of inflation begin .",
    "thus the time evolution of the lightest sneutrino controls the relevant slow - roll dynamics and it can therefore be identified as the inflaton . on the other hand ,",
    "the outcome of leptogenesis is governed by the sneutrino with the smallest decay rate .",
    "this implies a comparatively small mass and small yukawa couplings . in the following ,",
    "we shall concentrate on the case where the lightest sneutrino drives both inflation and leptogenesis .",
    "hence , the three generation model can be simplified to an effective one generation model in the right - handed neutrino sector , with the only remnant of the other two generations being a non - vanishing cp - asymmetry necessary for leptogenesis .",
    "we can thus concentrate on @xmath33 in eqs .",
    "and we denote the relevant inflaton direction by @xmath34 and the respective coupling constant by @xmath35 .",
    "based on the framework described in the previous section , we now have a closer look at the inflationary dynamics in our model .",
    "furthermore , we derive restrictions on the model parameters from the requirement of successful inflation and the latest observational data .",
    "we start with a short introduction to slow - roll inflation and then discuss a realization of the model of section  [ framework ] in a globally supersymmetric context .",
    "we then refine this discussion by including sugra effects and close the section by listing the inflationary predictions from our model and comparing them to the latest observational data .      a common way to realize inflation is the so - called slow - roll paradigm , where a classical scalar field with a strong dominance of its potential energy over its kinetic energy @xmath36 drives the accelerated expansion of the universe .",
    "at the same time , the quantum fluctuations of the inflaton field can account for the metric perturbations which give rise to the small scale cmb anisotropies .",
    "inflation ends when the slow - roll conditions are violated , i.e.  when the slow - roll parameters parameterizing the scalar potential and its derivatives @xmath37 become of order one .",
    "here , a prime denotes derivative w.r.t .  the inflaton field @xmath38 .",
    "in the slow - roll approximation , when @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 , the equation of motion of a homogeneous ( classical ) scalar field @xmath42 simplifies to @xmath43 here @xmath44 denotes the hubble expansion parameter .",
    "models of inflation typically predict the power spectra of the gauge invariant scalar and tensor perturbations at the time when the relevant fluctuations exited the horizon , roughly @xmath45 e - folds before the end of inflation .",
    "the amplitude of the scalar perturbations @xmath46 , the scalar spectral index @xmath47 , the running of the scalar spectral index @xmath48 , the tensor - to - scalar ratio @xmath49 and the tensor spectral index @xmath50 can be estimated in terms of the potential and the slow - roll parameters  @xcite as @xmath51 where these expressions have to be evaluated at the field value @xmath52 when the relevant scales leave the horizon .",
    "this value can be computed from eq .  .",
    "in order to test our model against observations , we compare the predictions from eqs .   to the experimental data obtained from the 7 year wmap survey combined with measurements of the baryon acoustic oscillations ( bao )  @xcite and measurements of the present value of the hubble parameter @xmath53",
    "@xcite using the six parameter @xmath54cdm fit  @xcite , which are given by @xmath55      in the model described in section  [ framework ] , we assumed a symmetry in the khler potential guaranteeing a flat @xmath38 direction ( imaginary direction of the scalar component of @xmath56 ) at tree - level ( see also section  [ sugra ] ) .",
    "thus loop corrections must be taken into account and these can indeed generate a small slope as required for slow - roll inflation . according to  @xcite , the coleman - weinberg one - loop effective potential is given by @xmath57 \\,,\\ ] ] with @xmath58 denoting the mass matrix of the theory and @xmath59 a renormalization scale .",
    "the @xmath38-dependent bosonic and fermionic mass terms generating a slope for the inflaton via the loop potential can be calculated from the scalar f - term potential @xmath60 and the fermionic mass matrix @xmath61 @xmath62 denote the superfields of the theory , @xmath63 the respective scalar components .",
    "the relevant ( i.e. @xmath38-dependent ) contributions to the loop potential are give by the @xmath64 and @xmath10 mass terms @xmath65 with @xmath66 note that the @xmath67 and @xmath10 terms in the supertrace vanish since the degeneracy in the respective fermionic and bosonic masses leads to a cancellation of these contributions .",
    "embedding this model in sugra provides the necessary stabilization of the scalar components of the @xmath67 and @xmath10 superfields during inflation and removes this degeneracy .",
    "however in the parameter range of interest , the contribution of the @xmath67 and @xmath10 terms to the loop potential turn out to be negligible ( see also section [ sugra ] ) . in the following ,",
    "we fix the renormalization scale to @xmath68 , which is the order of magnitude of the susy breaking scale . in our model ,",
    "inflation ends when the @xmath15-field destabilizes at the critical value @xmath69 characterized by @xmath70 and thus @xmath71 , @xmath72    we can now determine the observables describing the cmb fluctuations given by eqs .",

    "however their derivation ( see e.g.  @xcite ) implies an important assumption concerning the scalar potential @xmath158 . in order to rewrite the time - averaged kinetic energy density in terms of the total energy density by exploiting the virial theorem",
    "we must assume that we can write the scalar potential as @xmath159 with @xmath160 and @xmath161 .",
    "- are obtained with @xmath162 .",
    "numerical simulations of the full system  ,  ,  ,   and   show that this assumption is not justified in the early oscillation phase in the model described by eq .   since the large oscillations of the @xmath38-field result in a highly coupled system with higher orders terms in the scalar potential playing a non - negligible role .",
    "however they do also show that for @xmath163 the simpler system of differential equations   - does give a good approximation .",
    "this is the point of time relevant for the predictions of the reheating phase .",
    "having seen that the results of the numerical solutions to the full field equations for @xmath164 can be approximated reasonably well by the simpler set of boltzmann differential equations , we can now find approximate analytical solutions to the latter and use these expressions to find estimates for the reheat temperature and the produced baryon asymmetry @xmath165 combining   and   reproduces the familiar relation @xmath166 ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "these results must be compared with existing bounds on the reheating process .",
    "the wmap 7 year data combined with measurements of the baryon acoustic oscillations and todays hubble parameter imply @xmath167 @xcite , thus yielding @xmath168 gev .    additionally , the reheat temperature is bounded from above by the so - called gravitino problem  @xcite . a high reheat temperature would result in an overproduction of gravitinos .",
    "if these are stable , then the fact that their energy density can not be larger than the present total energy density of the universe leads to a bound on the reheat temperature in terms of the gravitino mass @xmath169 . on the other hand , if gravitinos are not stable , they can either decay before or during and after the big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) .",
    "in the former case ( i.e.  heavy gravitinos ) , with r - parity conserved the gravitinos will decay into the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) and their production is thus constrained by the dark matter abundance .",
    "this yields a fairly model independent bound of @xmath170 gev for an lsp mass of about 100 gev to 150 gev . in the latter case",
    "( i.e.  light gravitinos ) , the decay of the gravitinos would alter the outcome of bbn and create a conflict between bbn predictions and observations .",
    "this yields even stronger , however model dependent , constraints on the reheat temperature .",
    "combining these arguments yields a constraint on the reheat temperature of typically @xmath171 , depending mainly on the model under consideration and on the value of @xmath169 .",
    "the resulting preferred region in ( @xmath172)-parameter space is depicted in blue in fig .",
    "[ fig_infl_lepto ] .      note that throughout this chapter we have focussed on the evolution of the homogeneous fields @xmath38 and @xmath15 .",
    "it has been pointed out that under certain circumstances this might not be sufficient , since modes with @xmath173 of all fields in the model can be strongly excited at the end of inflation and before the beginning of reheating in a process referred to as preheating .",
    "there are two types of preheating worth mentioning in the context of hybrid inflation , namely preheating via parametric resonance  @xcite and tachyonic preheating  @xcite . in the former case , the coupling of fermions and bosons to the oscillating inflaton field results in oscillating mass terms for these particles .",
    "solving the respective equations of motion ( roughly the equation of an harmonic oscillator with an oscillating mass as described , e.g. , by the mathieu equation ) can yield explosive particle production .",
    "however , in the region of parameter space of interest to us , any heavy particles that are produced by this mechanism will decay back into heavy ( s)neutrinos or into radiation . the radiation produced directly or indirectly through this process at the beginning of the reheating phase",
    "will however be strongly diluted during the ongoing matter dominated phase and thus be insignificant for the outcome of the reheating phase .",
    "thus in our model , parametric resonance will not affect the results discussed above , mainly due to the structure of the mass spectrum and the very small effective yukawa coupling @xmath174 .",
    "tachyonic preheating occurs when the squared mass of the @xmath15 field becomes negative , triggering the waterfall ending inflation .",
    "modes of the @xmath15 field with @xmath175 grow exponentially , potential ( with @xmath176 ) , which does not appear in our model as can easily be checked from eq .  .",
    "] causing particle production of bosonic and fermionic fields coupled to the waterfall field  @xcite and creating an inhomogeneous field @xmath177 which can cause the formation of topological defects when the waterfall occurs  @xcite .",
    "it was stated in  @xcite that the production of fermions and bosons coupling to the waterfall field with a coupling strength @xmath178 is suppressed by @xmath179 with @xmath180 denoting the energy density during inflation .",
    "thus in the parameter region of interest , this is negligible in our model . on the other hand",
    ", the production of topological defects could indeed dominate the evolution of the universe in an early stage .",
    "however , since we have not observed any topological defects yet , a mechanism to prevent or dilute these objects ( e.g.  a preferred waterfall direction or a slight shift of the potential energy of the discrete vacua ) is typically implemented .",
    "we will assume that the higher dimensional operators denoted by dots in eq .",
    "provide such a solution so that at some time after the waterfall , the universe is dominated by the lightest right - handed sneutrino . the evolution from this point on",
    "is correctly described by the classical theory of reheating , as discussed above .",
    "other possible scenarios in which the evolution of the universe may not be dominated by the homogeneous component of the inflaton field remain to be explored in this context .",
    "in sections  [ inflation ] and  [ leptogenesis ] we have investigated the conditions under which inflation , with primordial perturbations in accordance with the latest wmap results , as well as successful leptogenesis can be realized simultaneously in simple models of sneutrino hybrid inflation as outlined in section  [ framework ] .",
    "the combined results are summarized in fig .",
    "[ fig_infl_lepto ] .",
    "the dynamics of inflation is governed by the scale @xmath29 of the phase transition ending hybrid inflation , the mass of the lightest right - handed ( s)neutrino @xmath98 , the vacuum energy parameter @xmath17 (= waterfall field self coupling ) and the parameter @xmath90 controlling the sugra corrections . in principle , terms depending on the neutrino yukawa coupling matrix could contribute , too . however",
    ", in our case the comparatively small first generation yukawa couplings make these contributions negligible . with @xmath29 fixed by the amplitude of the scalar cmb fluctuations and @xmath181 , the spectrum of the cmb fluctuations is primarily dependent on the lightest right - handed ( s)neutrino mass @xmath98 . for large values of @xmath98 , sugra corrections controlled by",

    "recent wmap observations constrain the preferred region for the spectral index @xmath47 , thus imposing a constraint on the preferred region for @xmath98 . for @xmath183 and @xmath184",
    "this is marked in grey in fig .",
    "[ fig_infl_lepto ] .",
    "on the other hand , the decisive quantities of reheating and leptogenesis , namely the reheat temperature @xmath185 and the baryon asymmetry @xmath186 depend on the effective first generation neutrino yukawa coupling @xmath174 , the cp asymmetry @xmath187 and the mass of the lightest right - handed ( s)neutrino @xmath98 ( see eqs .   and  ) .",
    "the latter parameter is thus the link between inflation and leptogenesis .",
    "the preferred region of parameter space resulting from bounds on these quantities is marked in blue in fig .",

    ", we find @xmath197 ev , thus implying nonthermal leptogenesis with @xmath198 and @xmath199 .",

    "another interesting possibility would arise if the experimentally preferred region for the spectral index was raised , favoring a spectral index closer to 1 .",
    "this would lower the preferred range for the lightest ( s)neutrino mass @xmath98 significantly and thus open up the region of thermal leptogenesis and allow for @xmath205 .",
    "the forthcoming results of the planck satellite will make the requirements for @xmath98 more accurate .    in summary ,",
    "we have pointed out that successful sneutrino hybrid inflation and leptogenesis can be achieved in this framework , and that combining both imposes requirements on the parameters of the underlying particle physics model .",
    "we obtain a mass for the lightest right - handed ( s)neutrino of @xmath206 gev , an effective first generation neutrino yukawa coupling @xmath189 and a very light left - handed neutrino with @xmath207 ev .",
    "furthermore , we find that leptogenesis occurs via nonthermal leptogenesis ( with @xmath208 for @xmath183 ) . concerning the spectrum of the cmb fluctuations , we predict a running of the spectral index of @xmath209 and a tensor - to - scalar ratio of @xmath210 .",
