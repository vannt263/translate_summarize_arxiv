    "cuprate high temperature superconductors",
    "are doped mott insulators . the novel superconductivity appears at doping levels just beyond the insulator - metal ( i m ) transition .",
    "the insulating behavior of the undoped endmember is understood to be due to electron correlation effects in the half - filled planar cu ",
    "o@xmath3 ( @xmath4 ) anti - bonding band .",
    "the phase diagram of the cuprates can be interpreted in terms of holes doped into this planar band .",
    "for example , in the system  it is assumed that one hole enters this band per strontium atom .",
    "this paradigm for the doping has hardly been questioned and a multitude of papers exist implicitly assuming this behavior .",
    "the  system is archetypal since it is a single layer system which can be straightforwardly doped over a wide range .",
    "the resulting phase diagram is thought to exhibit features that are universal to the cuprates .",
    "however , as a result of recent _ ab initio _ electronic band structure calculations , perry , tahir - kheli and goddard ( ptg )  @xcite have suggested a new model for the doping in the  system . in this case",
    "the doped holes reside in localized states on the cuo@xmath5 octahedra situated next to the dopant strontium ions .",
    "furthermore , the doped charge resides principally in the  orbitals ( i.e. , the out - of - plane bonds ) . coincidentally",
    "a structural distortion occurs such that the local jahn - teller ( jt ) distortion , that results in the long cu - o apical bond , is destroyed . a flat impurity band forms in the gap .",
    "the i m transition then occurs on increased doping in a manner similar to doped semiconductors by percolation of the doped impurities .",
    "these calculations were originally motivated by xafs measurements that observed a distorted environment of the octahedra in the vicinity of dopant ions  @xcite .",
    "this new way of understanding the doping , if it is right , clearly will result in a paradigm shift in our understanding of cuprate physics .",
    "it is thus of the greatest importance to test the hypothesis experimentally .",
    "a rather direct probe of this doping mechanism is the structure because it involves the local destruction of jt elongated bonds .",
    "the @xmath6 cu - o bond length along @xmath7 will thus shorten with doping and the width of the bond - length distribution for this bond will increase reflecting the increased disorder . despite detailed structural studies of this system  @xcite the temperature and doping dependence of these parameters has not been reported . in this paper",
    "we investigate whether there is evidence supporting this new doping paradigm in both the average crystal structure , and the local structure as measured using the atomic pair distribution function ( pdf ) technique  @xcite .",
    "we reexamine the extensive earlier structural data of radaelli to extract the desired parameters .",
    "we have also analyzed new neutron powder diffraction data using rietveld refinement and pdf refinement .",
    "we find that the data qualitatively agree with the predictions of the perry  @xcite .",
    "however , a more quantitative analysis , including evaluating the bond valences as a function of doping of the in - plane and apical cu - o bonds , indicates that doped charge is predominantly residing in the planar bonds suggesting the existing paradigm for doping is valid .",
    "this study reexamines the extensive published data of radaelli  @xcite to extract as a function of doping the interesting parameters of the plane copper to apical oxygen bond length ,  and the short lanthanum / strontium to apical oxygen bond length , .",
    "these parameters were determined from the reported fractional coordinates and lattice parameters . also important",
    "is the doping dependence of the copper to in - plane oxygen bond length , , which was presented previously  @xcite but is reexamined here . to check the ptg prediction we also need the anisotropic displacement parameter along the @xmath7-axis of the apical oxygen ,",
    "this was not published in  @xcite so we have used recently collected neutron powder diffraction data of our own from a less extensive set of samples .",
    "samples were synthesized using solid state methods and loose powders of @xmath8  g sealed in vanadium cylinders were measured at 10  k a the gem diffractometer at the isis neutron source .",
    "details of sample synthesis , characterization and measurement are reported elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "rietveld refinements were carried out on the data using the program gsas  @xcite .",
    "the data were also corrected for experimental effects and normalized to obtain the atomic pair distribution function  @xcite ( pdf ) using the program pdfgetn  @xcite .",
    "the pdf is the fourier transform of the normalized corrected powder diffraction data .",
    "it utilizes both bragg and diffuse scattering and contains information about the local structure  @xcite .",
    "structural models were refined to the pdfs using the program pdffit  @xcite . to check for consistency ,",
    "the same parameters were varied in the pdf and rietveld refinements .",
    "an example of the measured pdf from the undoped sample is shown in figure  [ fig;fig0 ] with the best fit model - pdf plotted on top .",
    "the pdf allows us to explore models that contain non - periodic defects such as those proposed by ptg .",
    "the pdf was calculated from a supercell model with the doping induced defects discussed by ptg .",
    "this was then used as simulated data and fit using the usual long - range orthorhombic ( lto )  @xcite structural model . in this way it was possible to estimate the size of the enlarged displacement factors that would result from the presence of the doping induced disorder described by ptg . in perry",
    "@xcite , for simplicity , no octahedral tilts were considered . in the present case",
    "we must compare resulting models with real data and so the doping induced defects described in  @xcite were superimposed on the background of octahedral tilts observed in the undoped endmember .",

    "inhomogeneous doping in the form of stripes or checkerboards  @xcite would also result in enlarged thermal factors for in - plane and apical motions of @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "however , inhomogeneous doping would not affect average bond - length obtained from rietveld refinement .",
    "it is therefore important to be more quantitative to distinguish these different possibilities .",
    "the ptg calculations  @xcite were carried out at special rational doping fractions of 1/8 , 1/4 and 1/2 and suggest the appearance of a single distorted cuo@xmath5 octahedron associated with each doped strontium .",

    "these defects are not seen explicitly ; however , the distortions will be apparent as a properly weighted change in the average bond - length and an increase in the respective displacement parameters .",
    "if we assume that these defects appear as each strontium is doped and are not a special feature of the rational doping fractions studied , we get the following relations for the strontium doping , @xmath2 , dependence of the average bond lengths : @xmath25 where @xmath2 is the doping level . these are shown as the dashed lines in fig .",

    "sr @xmath36-coordinate was set to zero and sr motion was restricted to be along @xmath35-axis only .",
    "the a - jt models were refined from the same set of initial values as that used for modeling the standard lto structure .",

    "although for all the variants of the a - jt model the agreement factor is similar to the one for the lto model , and for some variants even somewhat more favorable , it is not sufficient to unambiguously favor the distorted model over the standard lto structure .",
    "moreover , the refined distortions obtained from such explicit modeling yield relevant distance changes in the direction _ opposite _ to that originally proposed within the a - jt model of perry  @xcite ( i.e. , the cu - o2 distance of the affected octahedral unit lengthens , while @xmath37 shortens ) .",
    "however , inspection of the distances for the a - jt model results in the proper weighted average values when compared to corresponding average distances obtained by employment of the standard lto model .",
    "we now consider the expected structural changes that would occur based on electrostatic considerations in the conventional doping model .",
    "first , we note that the charge of the cuo@xmath16 plane is becoming less negative with doping which could result in the apical o@xmath38 moving closer to the plane . a very rough estimate of this behavior is possible neglecting the jahn - teller effect and assuming an ionic picture by using ionic radii of o@xmath39   , cu@xmath40   , cu@xmath41   , la@xmath42   , and sr@xmath43    @xcite . from this",

    "uniform doping of charge into the cu - o planes would not result in an increase in  on its own ; however , the presence of misfitting sr@xmath18 dopant ions would . any inhomogeneous charge distribution in the plane would increase .",
    "the fact that the observed increase in  exists but is smaller than needed to explain the ptg defects may argue in favor of electrostatic interpretation .",
    "there is a suggestion from single crystal refinements compared with empirical potential calculations that increases in displacement factors with doping can be explained in this way without invoking ptg - type defects  @xcite .",
    "our results would tend to support this .",
    "a more refined empirical framework for studying the distribution of charge between bonds is the bond valence model  @xcite . in this theory",
    "there is a direct relationship established between bond - length , @xmath46 , and the amount of charge in a bond ( the bond - valence , @xmath47 ) .",
    "the bond valence is defined as @xmath48 where @xmath49    is a universal constant and @xmath50 depends on the chemical identity of the ions in question . using this approach it is possible to determine how much of the doped charge is going into the planar vs. the apical bonds from a measurement of their length changes .",
    "the theory is successful in unstrained compounds and has recently been applied to mixed valent crystals and crystals containing jahn - teller distortions  @xcite .",
    "the nominal valence , @xmath51 , of an ion is then determined by summing the bond - valences over all the bonds in which it participates , @xmath52 . in the case of mixed valent crystals some ambiguity exists as to exactly what value to use for @xmath50 .",
    "the qualitative results of our analysis , however , do not depend on what value of @xmath50 is used .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig;fig3 ] .",
    "@xmath9     [ fig;fig3 ]    here we plot how the total doped charge ( assumed to be given by @xmath2 ) distributes itself between the apical and planar orbitals respectively , as determined from the bond - valence sums .",
    "the dimensionless variables , @xmath53 ( solid circles ) and @xmath54 parameterize this partition where @xmath55 .",
    "details of these calculations are as follows .",
    "first we determine the change in bond - valence of a particular bond due to doping , @xmath56 .",
    "we are interested in the partition of charge between the planar and apical orbitals , therefore we define an orbital - valence @xmath57 where the sum is over the planar bonds for the  orbital , @xmath58 , and over the apical bonds for the  orbital , @xmath59 .",
    "this is then expressed in dimensionless parameters by dividing by the total _ excess _ valence of copper determined by the sum over all the orbital - valences , @xmath60 . what is plotted in figure  [ fig;fig3 ]",
    "is @xmath61 ( solid circles ) and @xmath62 ( solid squares ) , that are measures of the amount of charge doped into the planar and apical orbitals , respectively .    as is apparent in fig .",
    "[ fig;fig1 ] , _ both _ the apical and in - plane bonds shorten with doping indicating a reduction in charge and doped holes going into both planar and apical bonds .",
    "however , one of the key aspects of this theory is the non - linear form of the bond valence , @xmath63 . as a result ,",
    "the same amount of charge doped into a long - bond shortens it much more than it would a short - bond , and vice versa . at @xmath32 @xmath64",
    "reflecting the fact that initially the holes that make cu in the @xmath65-state reside predominantly in the planar orbitals making these the canonical half - filled anti - bonding bands , with the apical bonds being doubly occupied with electrons ( i.e. , full , no holes ) .",
    "the physics of this is the existence of the jahn - teller distortion ; however , this shows that the phenomenological bond - valence model is making the correct prediction for the charge segregation initially .",
    "subsequently , the experimental observation is that _ both the planar and apical bonds shorten at about the same rate _ but because the planar bonds are initially shorter , and the fact that there are four of them rather than two , mean that the experimental observations demand that the doped charge is going predominantly into the planar orbitals as is evident in fig .",
    "[ fig;fig3 ] .",
    "the main result of this analysis is that the simple picture of localized  doped holes associated with sr sites described by the ptg calculations is not supported by the structural data . to a rather good approximation doped charge",
    "is going into the planar  orbitals .",
    "we do not address here whether @xmath30 sites contain different amounts of charge and this does not rule out localized doped defects or striped or checkerboard patterns of charge if they have sufficient planar character .",
    "such defects have been stabilized in the unrestricted becke-3-lee - yang - parr density functional calculations  @xcite .",
    "however , the observation that  is getting shorter also requires that some doped charge is appearing in the apical   orbital and a correction should be made to the canonical @xmath66 relationship to account for this , where @xmath1 is the doped charge in the planar orbitals .",
    "the partitioning parameter @xmath53 gives the correction , and @xmath1 is therefore given by @xmath67 ( @xmath53 shown in fig .",
    "[ fig;fig3](a ) ) .",
    "this augments spectroscopic measurements that show the partition of charge between copper and oxygen but struggle to differentiate partition between planar and apical bonds  @xcite .    in figure  [ fig;fig3](a )",
    "we show @xmath53 on an expanded scale . to obtain an analytic form for the @xmath68 calibration curve we have fit curves to the data in fig .",
    "[ fig;fig3](a ) .",
    "linear fit proved adequate resulting in @xmath69 .",
    "this results in the calibration @xmath70 the resulting fit to the data is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig;fig3](a ) and ( b ) and in the inset as a dashed line .",
    "thus , at a strontium content of @xmath31 the doping in the planar orbitals is actually @xmath71 , and conversely , the rational 1/8 filling occurs at @xmath72 .",
    "interestingly , the plateau in resistivity that was observed by komiya  @xcite and correlated with special behavior at 1/8 doping occurred at @xmath73 , which would correspond to @xmath74 when corrected using our calibration curve .",
    "note that , at all dopings , more than 85% of doped charge goes into the planar orbitals , though it appears increasingly in the apical bonds at higher doping .",
    "in summary , we have tested the hypothesis that doping in  is occurring predominantly in  orbitals  @xcite , rather than the canonical picture of doping into the planar  bands . whilst the average structure evolves _",
    "qualitatively _ as would be predicted according to  doping picture , more quantitative analysis suggests that the canonical picture of one hole doped into the planar bands per strontium is actually rather close to the true situation .",
