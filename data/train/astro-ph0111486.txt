    "the _ faint object spectrograph _ ( @xmath1 , keyes et al . 1995 , and references therein ) on board the _ hubble space telescope _",
    "provided the first opportunity to study quasar spectra in the ultraviolet with sufficient spectral resolution to measure the properties of the narrow absorption lines in detail .",
    "the quasar absorption line key project used the _",
    "fos _ to make a comprehensive study of absorber properties at low and intermediate redshift ( bahcall et al .",
    "1993 ; bahcall et al . 1996 ; jannuzi et al .",
    "1998 , hereafter j98 , and references therein ) .",
    "there were many quasars observed with the @xmath1 , however , for purposes other than the study of their absorption line properties .",
    "we have retrieved these data from the space telescope science institute archive , as well as the original key project data , and analyzed the absorption lines in all of the spectra , in a uniform way .",
    "the resulting data set is presented in this paper , and is valuable for many studies .",
    "these spectra can be combined with spectra obtained from the ground at moderate resolution ( bechtold 1994 , scott et al .",
    "2000a and references therein ) , to provide statistics on the ly-@xmath0 forest from @xmath2 to 5 ( dobrzycki et al .",
    "although line blending must be accounted for with care , these data are a useful complement to high spectral resolution echelle studies which to date have been carried out on a much smaller number of quasars .",
    "in companion papers , we present a statistical analysis of the ly-@xmath0 forest lines ( dobrzycki et al .",
    "2001 ) ; we analyze the proximity effect in this sample , in order to derive a limit on the metagalactic ultraviolet background and its evolution ( scott et al . 2001 ) ; and analyze the interstellar lines from the milky way ( morita et al .",
    "other topics will be discussed in future papers .    in section  2",
    "we present the data collected from the @xmath3 archive and describe the data reduction procedure . in section  3",
    "we discuss individual objects .",
    "the spectra , continuum fits , linelists , and other analysis products are available electronically and on the authors web site , described in section  4 .",
    "we have collected @xmath4 quasar spectra taken with the g130h , g190h , and g270h gratings . to the best of our knowledge",
    ", we have obtained all available quasar spectra with these gratings .",
    "table 1 is an abbreviated list of all of the data sets we retrieved .",
    "a full list is given in table 2 .",
    "table 2 lists the identification numbers of the individual data sets retrieved from the archive and their dates of observation .",
    "several of the spectra turned out to be of very low quality , or were failed observations , and were not reduced further .",
    "broad absorption line quasars and objects observed in spectropolarimetry mode were not reduced . these are noted in tables 1 and 2 .    some of the data were retrieved from the archives before",
    "the best available calibration products had been applied to the products in the archive .",
    "we recalibrated these spectra , using stsdas .",
    "spectra observed prior to the installation of costar in december 1993 were reduced from raw , uncalibrated data , while for the post - costar observations we used calibrated images .",
    "the new calibration methods available for pre - costar data are mainly concerned with improved scattered light corrections and flux calibration .",
    "for all the raw data we applied the _ addnewkeys _ and _ calfos _ tasks from the _ stsdas.hst_calib.fos _",
    "package , creating calibrated files containing data similar in format and contents to the post - costar calibrated data .",
    "the data that was re - calibrated , and the flatfield files used are listed in table 2 .",
    "we then extracted the data from the reduced images following a procedure dependent on the observation mode .",
    "if the spectrum was taken in the rapid  readout mode , we combined the spectra from all groups within the image using the _ rcombine _ task from the _ stsdas.hst_calib.ctools _ package , propagating the error and data quality flags . if the data were taken in the spectroscopy mode , the last group in the image is the sum of all groups .",
    "flux and error spectra of the same object taken in succession with the same observing setup ( i.e.  having the same detector , observation mode , aperture and disperser ) were then combined into a single spectrum , weighting them by the exposure time of each individual spectrum .",
    "several objects were observed more than once with the same grating but with different apertures . for those objects we analyzed the higher signal - to - noise spectrum , which typically was also the higher spectral resolution spectrum .",
    "table 2 notes which data sets were combined into the spectrum we used for the absorption line analysis .",
    "spectra were dereddened using iraf task _ deredden _ , taking as input the  column density calculated using the colden code , written by j.  mcdowell , which utilizes data from stark et al .",
    "( 1992 ) ; for objects with @xmath5 we used the data from the galactic reddening map of burstein @xmath6 heiles ( 1982 ) . conversion from  column density to e(b - v ) was assumed to be n@xmath7/e(b - v)=@xmath8 @xmath9 magn@xmath10 ( bohlin , savage & drake 1978 ) .",
    "the milky way reddening curve of cardelli , clayton & mathis ( 1989 ) was assumed .",
    "the value of e(b - v ) which was used is listed in table 2 .",
    "we put all the spectra and line lists on an absolute wavelength scale where possible by calculating the average offset of the detected galactic interstellar lines in each spectrum .",
    "we looked for the ( 1190,1193,1260,1526 ) , ( 1206 ) , ( 1334 ) , and ( 1548,1550 ) absorption in the g130h spectra , the ( 1670 ) line in the g190h spectra , and ( 2344 , 2374 , 2382 , 2586 , 2600 ) , ( 2796,2803 ) , and ( 2853 ) lines in the g270h spectra .",
    "in several cases , especially for g190h data , no galactic absorption lines were detected and we then applied no wavelength shift to the spectrum .",
    "we list the offsets adopted in table 2 .",
    "the key project went to great lengths to identify possible residual flat - field features in their spectra , which would erroneously be identified as absorption lines ( see schneider et al .",
    "1993 , j98 ) .",
    "we did not attempt to repeat this for all the spectra here .",
    "therefore , there is a possibility that any particular weak absorption line is not real . in j98 , they present 117 non - bal quasar spectra , and report 88 flatfield features : they found no flatfield features in 10 g130h spectra , 47 flatfield features in 46 g190h spectra and 32 flatfield features in 61 g270h spectra . for most purposes ,",
    "these features have a small effect statistically on the absorption line sample ( see also dobrzycki et al .",
    "2001 ) .      for all spectra we determined signal - to - noise ratios , performed continuum fits , detected absorption lines and identified the metal systems using program findsl ( aldcroft , bechtold , @xmath6 elvis 1994 ) .",
    "the estimations of equivalent width were done both by direct integration of the profile , and by fitting gaussians .",
    "direct integration overcomes the problem of asymmetric lines which is seen for the large aperture in @xmath1 , pre - costar ( see section 2.4 ) . in the end",
    ", we decided _ not _ to use these spectra in the subsequent analysis of the absorbers , and so used the equivalent widths from gaussian fits ( see paper iv ) .",
    "we quantified the effect of line blending and completeness by generating simulated data sets , and describe the results in section 2.6 .",
    "the significance of each absorption line was estimated in two ways . to search for candidate absorption lines , we ran a boxcar of width equal to 2.46 times the full - width - half - maximum of the spectral line spread function in pixels .",
    "we calculated the equivalent width and its error , derived from the straightforward propagation of errors from the errors on the flux in each individual pixel .",
    "one measure of the significance of a line is then the ratio of the equivalent width to its error .",
    "this underestimates the significance , however , since the signal - to - noise in the bottom of the absorption line is worse than it would have been had the line not been there .",
    "we calculated a threshold for detecting lines by calculating the one - sigma error for an absorption line as a function of wavelength for the observed flux and our continuum fit in boxcars of the same width as our search technique ( 9 pixels for most of the data ) . to interpolate over the regions where there were actual absorption lines , we fit a spline to the calculated threshold as a function of wavelength and , to be conservative , forced it to outline the upper envelope of the data .",
    "then for each line for which the ratio of equivalent width to its error was greater than 3 after the initial search , we interpolated the spline fits to the threshold files and calculated a significance equal to the ratio of the measured equivalent width to the one - sigma error in the smoothed threshold file .",
    "we kept lines where this ratio was greater than 3.5@xmath11 .",
    "the significance derived in this way is reported in the line lists .",
    "any line in these lists is real , but the sample is not complete unless a higher threshold is applied .",
    "we discuss completeness in section 2.6 .",
    "metal absorption line systems were searched for in a number of ways .",
    "first we reviewed the literature and examined all reported redshift systems , using the nasa / ipac extragalactic database ( ned ) and the york et al .",
    "( 1991 ) absorption line catalog .",
    "we adopted the search list of strong transitions given by morton et al .",
    "( 1988 ) . in a few cases",
    ", we decided that redshift systems reported in the literature were spurious ; these are noted individually in section 3 .",
    "we also examined the lines shortward of ly-@xmath0 with equivalent widths greater than 1  , and tested whether a plausible identification could be made if these lines were ly-@xmath0 .    finally , we used a computer program to search for redshift systems automatically .",
    "we used the morton search list and looked for redshifts which resulted in at least 5 matches in the line lists .",
    "we ran the code on simulated ly-@xmath0 forest spectra with no metal systems to assess the probability of chance matches in the forest .",
    "we found that systems with 4 matches and plausible line ratios were commonly found .",
    "we made no assumptions about ion ratios , but did require that all the transitions for a particular ion have physically reasonable equivalent width ratios given the f - values listed in morton ( 1991 ) , and that ly-@xmath0 be detected if it was in the spectral coverage .    since our goal was to construct a sample for studying the ly-@xmath0 forest , we were generous in our identifications : if there was any doubt , we went ahead and identified a line as a metal transition .",
    "we kept track of the regions of the spectrum which contained metal lines , and provide this information electronically . in effect",
    "these are parts of the redshift path which were not observed for ly-@xmath0 and our analysis programs simply delete these parts of the spectrum automatically .",
    "therefore , before drawing conclusions about any particular line identified as a metal , one should look carefully at all the lines identified for that redshift system .",
    "note that this data is _ not _ appropriate for deriving certain types of statistics for the metal - line absorbers .",
    "we did nt keep track of why a particular quasar was observed , and clearly some objects were observed because they were known beforehand to have interesting metal - line systems , for example damped ly-@xmath0 absorbers .",
    "in figure 1 , we plot the spectra which were analyzed . for objects which were observed more than once ,",
    "we show the spectra from which we derived absorption line lists .",
    "other spectra are available on our web site .    the absorption line lists , including identifications , are given electronically in table 3 , and on the web site .",
    "our dataset is a compilation of spectra taken in different apertures .",
    "post - costar the spectral line spread function ( lsf ) was similar for data taken in each aperture , and we neglected any differences .",
    "pre - costar , the lsf was significantly degraded and non - gaussian for data taken in the a-1 ( 4.3 ) aperture ( smith @xmath6 hartig 1989 ; evans 1993 ) .",
    "the lsf in other apertures was similar to the post - costar values .",
    "seventy - two of the objects in the sample were observed pre - costar with a-1 , and were not observed subsequently ; these are listed in table 4 . in a few cases ,",
    "however , observations were taken pre - costar with a-1 and post - costar or with a smaller aperture , with the same grating , so we could directly compare the line lists generated . for two objects , q1521 + 1009 and q1634 + 70437 ,",
    "we examined the g270h spectra in detail . for q1521 + 1009 , 8 lines which were detected in the small aperture data were strong enough to have been expected to be detected above the 5@xmath11 equivalent width threshold in the pre - costar a-1 data ; however only 6 were detected . for q1634 + 7037 ,",
    "the situation was worse : of the 57 strongest lines in the small aperture data should have been detected in the pre - costar a-1 spectrum , but only 31 were .",
    "figure 2 shows the 4 spectra in question .",
    "the resolution is low in the pre - costar a-1 spectra 50@xmath12 lower than in the small aperture data and at @xmath131 our line search techniques apparently have not adequately taken into account the change in sensitivity .",
    "while the spectra observed only in the a-1 aperture , pre - costar are useful for some types of absorption line studies , we recommend that they _ not _",
    "be used for studies of the ly-@xmath0 forest .",
    "a part of our sample contains absorption lines derived from the spectra observed for by the hst key project .",
    "we derived the absorption line properties independently from the key project for the same data , and in this section compare line lists .",
    "although we reduced the spectral data slightly differently ( weighting individual spectra by exposure time ) the spectra for a few objects we checked are identical .",
    "figure 3 shows the comparison of the lines found by our software and the key project ( j98 ) .",
    "we chose 7 objects for detailed comparison ( q0003 + 1553 , q0743 - 6719 , q1116 + 2135 , q1241 + 1737 , q1424 - 1150 , q1718 + 4807 , q2340 - 0339 ) .",
    "these were chosen randomly from the objects which had reasonable signal to noise , contained ly-@xmath0 forest , did not have heavily blended or broad absorption features , and appeared to have continua that should be fit easily . of a total of 285 lines found by our software , 14 lines , or 5@xmath12 of the total , were not found by the key project . in all cases ,",
    "the features in question were weak , blended with other features , or near the edge of the spectrum .",
    "figure 3 shows the comparison of the equivalent widths and significance level for the lines which were detected in common by both groups . the significance level assigned to each line shows a systematic offset however .",
    "we assign a significance to the line which is about 20@xmath12 lower than that assigned by the key project . as a result ,",
    "our line lists are more conservative , and contain fewer lines above a given threshold .",
    "this difference is probably due to the fact that we adopt a fairly wide window ( 2.46 times the full - width - half - maximum of the spectral line spread function in pixels ) in which to calculate the detection threshold , compared to j98 .",
    "these differences are larger than we expected .",
    "since both groups have automated line finding and continuum fitting algorithms , the differences result from the slightly different approaches to line detection .",
    "the effects are easily quantifiable in subsequent analysis .      in order to determine how reliably we find significant lines",
    ", we produced a set of 25 @xmath14 simulated ly-@xmath0 forest spectra and a set of 25 spectra at @xmath15 .",
    "the code we used is described in dobrzycki & bechtold ( 1996 ) .",
    "we modeled the ly-@xmath0 forest using the neutral hydrogen column density ( n@xmath16 ) and b - value distributions observed in high resolution optical spectra of high redshift quasars ( hu et al .",
    "we parameterized the number of lines @xmath17 as    @xmath18    and used values of @xmath19 = 0.50 ( bahcall et al .",
    "1993 ) and @xmath201.46 ( hu et al . 1995 ) .",
    "the results of this analysis should not be sensitive to the value of @xmath19 since the redshift path covered in each spectrum is small .",
    "the lower column density limits chosen were 5x10@xmath21 @xmath9 for @xmath14 and 2x10@xmath21 @xmath9 for @xmath15 ; and the upper column density limit used was 3x10@xmath22 @xmath9 in both cases .",
    "the mean doppler parameter and width of the doppler parameter distribution used were @xmath2328 km s@xmath10 and @xmath24 = 10 km s@xmath10 .",
    "the column density limits were chosen to give the same total absorption in the simulated spectra as is calculated in the spectra of q0850 + 4400 and q2145 + 0643 , which served as the templates for the @xmath14 and @xmath15 simulations , respectively .",
    "we used the signal - to - noise , sampling , spectral resolution , and observed continuum of these two representative objects to model the ly-@xmath0 forest spectra .",
    "we find that for the @xmath14 simulation , at 5@xmath11 significance , the line lists are 100% complete ; and for the @xmath15 simulation and 5@xmath11 significance the line lists are 98% complete . in this calculation , we account for line blending by counting all simulated lines within 2.46 resolution elements of each recovered line as a component of that recovered line .",
    "if blending is neglected and matches are determined on the basis of the best wavelength match between simulated and recovered lines , the completenesses drop to 82% and 61% for @xmath14 and @xmath15 respectively . for lines of 3@xmath11 significance and above , the completenesses of the @xmath14 and @xmath15 simulation line lists are 94% and 96% when blending is accounted for and 75% and 54% when it is not .",
    "the simulations also revealed another interesting point .",
    "of the lines @xmath25recovered \" by our software , a small percentage were not generated by the simulation program .",
    "in other words , our software found some spurious lines .",
    "how many of these lines occur in the sample depends upon the signal - to - noise of the data and upon the line density of the spectra , i.e. the redshift .",
    "the percentages of these spurious lines were 5.3% of the 3@xmath11 lines from the @xmath14 simulated spectra , and 1.3% of the 3@xmath11 lines from the @xmath15 simulated spectra .",
    "the higher percentage of spurious lines in the @xmath14 spectra compared to the @xmath15 spectra , which have higher line densities , can be understood to be a result of the higher signal - to - noise in the @xmath15 simulated spectra .",
    "the signal - to - noise template for the @xmath15 simulations fluctuates between 12.5 and 14 across the spectra , while that of the @xmath14 simulations increases smoothly from 3 to 15 from the blue to the red .",
    "none of the lines recovered at 5@xmath11 significance were spurious .    in summary , based on the analysis of simulated ly-@xmath0 forest spectra",
