    "the electric polarizability of a hadron characterizes the reaction of the quarks to an external electric field and can be measured by experiment ( via compton scattering ) and on the lattice .",
    "conceptually , an electric field will tend to separate charges in a hadron , thereby affecting the internal energy of the hadron and thus the mass . as in classical physics",
    ", the energy density goes as the square of the electric and magnetic fields : @xmath1 where @xmath2 @xmath3 is the electric ( magnetic ) polarizability that compares to experiment .",
    "see  @xcite for a calculation of the magnetic polarizability .",
    "as is usual in lattice calculations , the mass of a hadron can be calculated from the exponential decay of a correlation function . by calculating the ratio of the correlation function in the field to that without the field",
    ", we have a ratio of exponentials that decays as a single exponential at the rate of the mass difference .",
    "equation  ( [ eq : empol ] ) implies that this mass difference ( between in and out of the field ) plotted versus the electric field will be parabolic with coefficient equal to minus half the polarizability . by averaging @xmath4 over the field , @xmath5 , and its inverse , @xmath6",
    ", we hope to minimize the linear term in the parabolic fit .",
    "this calculation of the polarizabilities of several hadrons will follow the ideas discussed by fiebig , _ et al . _",
    "@xcite ; however , they used staggered fermions and we do not . specifically , we include the static e - field on the links as a phase : ( with fermion charge @xmath7 ) @xmath8 since the electric field is linearized in the continuum , we used the linearized form on the lattice .",
    "fiebig , _ et al .",
    "_ found no significant difference between the exponential and linearized formats for similar electric field values .",
    "in addition , although the electric field breaks the isospin symmetry and allows the pion , a vector meson , to mix with glueballs , we ignore this effect in our calculation .",
    "this calculation uses the tadpole - improved clover quark action on a quenched @xmath9 lattice with @xmath10 ( @xmath11 ) .",
    "the gauge field was thermalized to @xmath12 sweeps and then saved every 1000 .",
    "we have 100 configurations , but only 17 were used in these preliminary results .    including the static electric field as a phase on the links affects the wilson term , but not the clover loops . in units of @xmath13 ,",
    "the electric field took the values @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 via the parameter @xmath18 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : efield ] ) . with @xmath19",
    ", we used six values of @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , and @xmath25 , which roughly correspond to @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , and @xmath31 mev .",
    "the tightness of the parabola formed by graphing the mass shift of a particle versus the applied electric field will give the electric polarizability when fit with eq .",
    "( [ eq : empol ] ) at @xmath32 .",
    "the results for the neutron are shown in fig .",
    "[ f : mass - shift ] .",
    "the graphs are sorted by mass , large to small displayed from the upper - left across and down to the lower - right .",
    "the nice parabolic fit of fig .",
    "[ f : mass - shift ] indicates that averaging over both directions of the field , @xmath5 and @xmath6 , has minimized any linear dependence .",
    "similar graphs can be produced for the @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 to varying degrees of confidence .    with more configurations",
    ", we will consider the chiral limit by combining the quadratic coefficient from these results into a plot of polarizability versus mass .",
    "[ f : pol ] shows the neutron polarizability increasing in this limit .",
    ".current experimental values ( @xcite with modifications by @xcite ) and theoretical values ( back to 2000 ) for the polarizability of the neutron .",

    "the experiments measure @xmath44 and the results are found using a sum rule that gives @xmath45 .",
