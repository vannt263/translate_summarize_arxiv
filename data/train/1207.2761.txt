    "accurate positioning is important for various cooperative vehicle safety ( cvs ) applications such as collision avoidance , turning assistant , etc . to enable these applications ,",
    "the lane level accuracy of vehicular positioning is required .",
    "however , current commercially available gps devices , which are widely used in ground vehicles for navigation tasks , typically report tens of meters of positioning errors .",
    "thus , it is difficult to recover the lane level relationship among neighbor vehicles , which is essential for most of the safety critical applications .",
    "for example , when a vehicle initiates an emergency brake to respond to an unexpected pedestrian , it will broadcast a notification message to all its neighbors . on receiving this message",
    ", it should be the vehicle which immediately follows the brake - initiator in the same lane to respond first , even though it may not necessarily be the nearest one .",
    "as vehicles move along the road , their trajectories conform to the multi - lane structure of the road .",
    "the unique yet important lane level relationship makes it imperative to achieve higher positioning accuracy for lane level topology recovery .",
    "current vehicular localization techniques can be categorized into two main classes - absolute position based and relative distance based .",
    "the techniques used to recover the absolute positions of moving vehicles are mostly based on trilateration of measured distances to known anchors , such as the cellular assisted localization @xcite and the global positioning system ( gps ) @xcite .",
    "various augmentation techniques have been proposed to improve the positioning accuracy , including the wide area augmentation system ( waas ) , european geostationary navigation overlay service ( egnos ) and differential gps @xcite . however , these augmentation systems all require support from large - scale infrastructures , and some of them are not globally available .",
    "besides these trilateration mechanisms , a fingerprint approach @xcite is also popular in recovering positions of mobile objects using pattern recognition algorithms and statistical features of received wireless signals , such as from wifi or cellular tower beacons .",
    "the accuracy of these techniques depends largely on the granularity of the training data set and the accuracy of system calibrations , which are time consuming and costly .    some applications such as autonomous driving and collision avoidance depend more on the relative positions among vehicles , instead of their absolute positions .",
    "representative techniques to measure the distance between moving vehicles include the received signal strength ( rss ) @xcite@xcite , time of arrival ( toa ) , and time difference of arrival ( tdoa ) @xcite .",
    "however , as stated in @xcite@xcite , these methods can hardly achieve the ranging accuracy required by most cooperative positioning applications .",
    "proposed a distance measurement method for cooperative positioning without using radio range @xcite .",
    "it reduces the average distance error to around five meters , but this is still not sufficient for lane level topology discovery .    in this paper ,",
    "a weighted least squares pseudorange double difference algorithm is proposed to further increase the accuracy level of gps based distance detection .",
    "the classic double difference pseudorange solution , which was originally designed for high - end survey level gps systems , is adapted to low - end navigation level gps receivers for its wide availability in ground vehicles .",
    "the carrier to noise ratio ( cnr ) of raw pseudorange measurements are taken into account for noise mitigation . as demonstrated by field tests ,",
    "our new algorithm greatly improves the accuracy of distance estimation and achieves average distance errors of around 3 meters . with the improved distance measurements among several vehicles",
    ", we can then use techniques such as trilateration to determine their relative positions .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we present our weighted least squares pseudorange double difference algorithm for estimating distances between two vehicles . performance evaluation is presented in section iii , and section iv concludes the paper and outlines future work .",
    "in this section , on the basis of the introduction of double difference pseudorange solution , we propose a weighted least square algorithm to mitigate the impact of the significant noises in pseudorange measurements of commercial gps receivers . in addition , we discuss the dsrc system that enables the cooperative distance detection .      in gps system ,",
    "gps receivers recover their positions by trilateration of the measured distances to multiple visible satellites .",
    "the distance to each satellite is derived from an estimated time of transmission , and this distance is called the pseudorange . several sources contribute to the errors in the pseudorange measurements .",
    "the aggregate impact of these error factors can introduce around 10 meters inaccuracy to the calculated gps fixes .",
    "the pseudorange measurement between gps receiver @xmath0 to satellite @xmath1 can be decomposed into @xcite :    @xmath2    where @xmath3 is the true distance between satellite @xmath1 and receiver @xmath0 ; @xmath4 is the bias caused by receiver @xmath0 s clock bias ; @xmath5 is the common noise related to satellite @xmath1 that are shared by all the gps receivers within a vicinity region , including the satellite clock bias , the atmospheric delay , and the error in the broadcasted ephemeris ; and @xmath6 is the non - common noise specific to receiver @xmath0 and satellite @xmath1 , including the multipath error and the acquisition noise . by taking the difference between the pseudoranges of two receivers @xmath0 and @xmath7 to the same satellite @xmath1 , the common noise due to satellite @xmath1 can be effectively removed :    @xmath8    where @xmath9 is the single difference of pseudorange measurements , and @xmath10 is the difference between the true ranges from receiver @xmath0 and @xmath7 to satellite @xmath1 . as the true ranges from satellite @xmath1 to gps receivers @xmath0 and @xmath7 are much larger than the distance between @xmath0 and @xmath7 , the two vectors pointing from @xmath1 to @xmath0 and @xmath7 are nearly parallel to each other . as illustrated in figure 1 , @xmath10",
    "can thus be approximated by :    @xmath11    where @xmath12 is the unit vector pointing from gps receiver @xmath0 ( or @xmath7 ) to satellite @xmath1 , and @xmath13 is the distance vector between receiver @xmath0 and @xmath7 .",
    "when double difference is used , the clock bias of receiver @xmath0 and @xmath7 can be further removed .    @xmath14 + [ ( \\varepsilon^i_a - \\varepsilon^i_b)- ( \\varepsilon^j_a - \\varepsilon^j_b ) ]    \\nonumber \\\\                  & = & [ \\vec{e}^i - \\vec{e}^j]\\cdot \\vec{r}_{ab } + [ ( \\varepsilon^i_a - \\varepsilon^i_b)- ( \\varepsilon^j_a - \\varepsilon^j_b ) ] \\label{eq : dd}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    given known position of either one of the gps receiver , the unit vector of each @xmath12 can be calculated using the received ephemeris of each target satellite @xmath1 .",
    "let @xmath15^t$ ] denote the column vector of pseudorange double differences , and there are totally @xmath16 satellites shared by receiver @xmath0 and @xmath7 .",
    "[ eq : dd ] can be reorganized into :    @xmath17    where @xmath18^t$ ] , and @xmath19 is the column vector of aggregated non - common noises related to the two satellites and two receivers involved . if @xmath19 can be assumed to be zero mean and equal variance , @xmath13 can be derived by the linear least squares estimator    @xmath20    as long as there are at least four shared satellites between the two gps receivers .    comparing with the around twenty thousand kilometers distances from satellites to vehicular gps receivers , tens of meters positioning error to the gps receiver @xmath0 or @xmath7",
    "can be fairly ignored when calculating the unit vectors of @xmath12 .",
    "thus , @xmath12 can be calculated by directly using the final output of the gps fix of either one of the two gps receiver modules .          in eq .",
    "[ eq : dd_vec ] , @xmath19 is the aggregated non - common noises of pseudorange measurements including both the multipath and random code acquisition errors encountered by the two gps receivers . it s",
    "@xmath1th item is equal to    @xmath21    in scenarios where multipath effect is not severe , for example when vehicles are moving along highways , @xmath22 are dominated by code acquisition errors , which can be directly linked to the carrier to noise ratio ( cnr ) of the received satellite signal . with commercial and navigation level gps receivers , the accuracy of code acquisition is much worse than survey level devices .",
    "it can introduce more than ten meters of errors to the pseudorange measurements and thus severely degrade the accuracy of double difference based distance detections .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "in this paper , we proposed a weighted least squares pseudorange double difference algorithm for cooperative distance measurement in vehicular networks .",
    "it makes use of the existing gps receivers in each vehicle and dsrc - based vehicular networks for accurate distance measurement . with commercially available gps receivers ,",
    "our technique can greatly eliminate the impact of those random noise in coarse code acquisition , and reduce the distance estimation error to about 3 meters , which is a great improvement compared with using gps fixes directly .",
    "the current solution is effective in scenarios where the dominant errors come from the code acquisition . in our future work ,",
    "the influence from the multipath effect as well as the countermeasures will be further examined . with the improved distance estimation accuracy",
