    "although this scenario is attractive , it is plagued by the unitary - violation problem associated with graviton exchange in @xmath13 scalar scattering around the energy scale @xmath14 ( where @xmath15  gev is the reduced planck mass ) @xcite .",
    "since @xmath16 is around the energy scale of inflation , some strong coupling effect can give rise to additional corrections to the inflaton potential .",
    "another attempt is to employ a field derivative coupling with the einstein tensor @xmath17 , i.e. @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is a constant having a dimension of mass @xcite ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite for the original work ) . in the regime where the hubble parameter @xmath20 is larger than @xmath19",
    "the field evolves more slowly relative to the case of standard inflation due to a gravitationally enhanced friction .",
    "hence it is possible to reconcile steep potentials such as @xmath21 ( @xmath8 ) with the cmb observations .    in refs .",
    "@xcite it was shown that , for a slow - rolling scalar field satisfying the condition @xmath22 , the strong coupling scale @xmath16 of the derivative coupling theory is around @xmath23 in a homogeneous and isotropic cosmological background .",
    "provided that @xmath20 and @xmath19 are below the planck scale , the theory is in a weak coupling regime with suppressed quantum corrections .",
    "the property of the high cut - off scale @xmath16 around @xmath23 is associated with the fact that whenever the non - minimal derivative coupling to gravity dominates over the canonical kinetic term the theory possesses an asymptotic local shift symmetry for @xmath24 @xcite .",
    "this symmetry is related to the galilean symmetry @xmath25 in minkowski space - time @xcite , but the difference is that the coordinate @xmath26 in the derivative coupling theory on curved backgrounds is linked to the covariantly constant killing vectors @xcite . in the presence of a slowly varying inflaton potential such a local symmetry is only softly broken , so that the potential can be protected against quantum corrections during inflation .",
    "the field self - interaction of the form @xmath27 @xcite , which satisfies the galilean symmetry in the limit of minkowski space - time , also leads to the slow evolution of @xmath0 along the inflaton potential @xcite ( see also refs .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "a nice feature of the non - minimal derivative coupling with the einstein tensor is that the mechanism of the gravitationally enhanced friction works for general steep potentials .",
    "for instance , let us consider the potential of natural inflation , @xmath28 $ ] , where @xmath29 characterizes the scale of the breaking of a global shift symmetry @xcite . in order for this potential to be consistent with the cmb observations , we require that @xmath29 is larger than @xmath30 in conventional slow - roll inflation @xcite .",
    "then the global symmetry is broken above the quantum gravity scale , in which case quantum field theory may be invalid @xcite . in the presence of the non - minimal derivative coupling to gravity , however , the scale @xmath29 can be much smaller than @xmath23 because of the gravitationally enhanced friction @xcite .",
    "another example is the exponential potential @xmath31 , whose dominance leads to the power - law expansion of the universe ( with the scale factor @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is cosmic time ) @xcite . in higher - dimensional gravitational theories ,",
    "exponential potentials often arise as the curvature of internal spaces related with the geometry of extra dimensions @xcite . in such cases",
    "the constant @xmath34 is usually larger than the order of unity , so that it is difficult to realize sufficient amount of inflation .",
    "as we will see later , this problem can be circumvented by taking into account the non - minimal derivative coupling . moreover , unlike the standard case , inflation comes to end with gravitational particle production .    in order to test the viability of inflationary models with the non - minimal derivative coupling it is important to estimate the power spectra of density perturbations relevant to the cmb anisotropies . in refs .",
    "@xcite the authors computed the inflationary observables such as the scalar spectral index @xmath35 , the tensor - to - scalar ratio @xmath36 , and the nonlinear parameter @xmath37 of the equilateral scalar non - gaussianities ( see also refs .",
    "since the scalar propagation speed is close to the speed of light during inflation , the scalar non - gaussianities are suppressed to be small ( @xmath38 ) .",
