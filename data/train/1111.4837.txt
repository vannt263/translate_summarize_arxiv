    "the schwarzschild black hole solution , expressed in the schwarzschild coordinates , has the following metric tensor :    @xmath0    where @xmath1 is the metric of the unit sphere @xmath2 , @xmath3 the mass of the body , and the units were chosen so that @xmath4 and @xmath5 ( see _ e.g. _ @xcite149 ) .",
    "the first two terms in the right hand side of equation do nt depend on the coordinates @xmath6 and @xmath7 , and @xmath8 is independent on the coordinates @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "therefore we can view this solution as a warped product between a two - dimensional semiriemannian space and the sphere @xmath2 with the canonical metric .",
    "we can use this property to change the coordinates @xmath9 and @xmath10 independently , ignoring in calculations the term @xmath11 , which we reintroduce at the end .",
    "the singularity at @xmath12 , which makes the coefficient @xmath13 become infinite , is only apparent , as shown by the eddington - finkelstein coordinates ( @xcite150 ) .    as @xmath14",
    ", the coefficient @xmath13 tends to 0 , and the coefficient @xmath15 tends to @xmath16 .",
    "this is a genuine singularity , as we can see from the fact that the scalar @xmath17 tends to @xmath18 .",
    "this seems to suggest that the schwarzschild metric can not be made smooth at @xmath19 .",
    "in fact , as we will see , we can find coordinate systems in which the components of the metric , although degenerate , are analytic ( hence they are finite ) , even at the genuine singularity given by @xmath19 .",
    "moreover , we will see that we can find an analytic extension of the schwarzschild spacetime , which is _",
    "semiregular_.    in @xcite it was developed the _ singular semiriemannian geometry _ for metrics which are allowed to change their signature , in particular to be degenerate .",
    "such metrics @xmath20 are smooth , but @xmath21 tends to @xmath18 when the metric becomes degenerate . the notion of levi - civita connection can not be defined , and the curvature can not be defined canonically .",
    "but in the special case of semiregular metrics we can construct a canonical riemann curvature tensor @xmath22 , which is smooth , although @xmath23 is not canonically defined and is singular .",
    "it admits canonical ricci and scalar curvatures , which may be discontinuous or infinite at the points where the metric changes its signature .",
    "the usual tensorial and differential operations , normally obstructed by the degeneracy of the metric , can be replaced by equivalent operations which work fine , if the metric is semiregular .    in this paper",
    "we will show that the schwarzschild solution can be extended analytically to such a well behaved semiregular solution .",
    "[ thm_schw_analytic ] the schwarzschild metric admits an analytic extension at @xmath19 .",
    "it is enough to make the coordinate change in a neighborhood of the singularity  in the region @xmath24 . on that region , the coordinate @xmath9 is timelike , and @xmath10 is spacelike",
    ". let s change the coordinates by @xmath25    recall that the metric coefficients in the schwarzschild coordinates are @xmath26 in the new coordinates , the metric coefficients are @xmath27 @xmath28 @xmath29 from we see that @xmath30 is analytic around @xmath19 , hence the only condition for the partial derivatives of @xmath9 with respect to @xmath31 and @xmath32 is that they are smooth .",
    "the expression of @xmath33 on the other hand , has @xmath9 as denominator , hence we have to cancel it . from equations ( [ eq_metric_coeff_analytic_tau_tau][eq_metric_coeff_analytic_xi_xi ] ) , we see that @xmath9 as the denominator in the expression of @xmath33 is canceled if the partial derivatives of @xmath10 have the form : @xmath34 where @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 are smooth functions in @xmath31 and @xmath32 , and @xmath38 the conditions are satisfied for example if @xmath10 has the form @xmath39 .",
    "the metric becomes @xmath40 @xmath41 @xmath42    we can see now that the new metric is smooth around @xmath19  none of its components become infinite at @xmath19 .",
    "it is singular , because it is degenerate , but it is smooth . if the functions @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 are analytic , so is the new metric .",
    "to go back to the four - dimensional spacetime , we take the warped product between the above metric and the sphere @xmath2 , with the warping function @xmath43 .",
    "the warping function @xmath43 is smooth and cancels at the singular points @xmath19 .",
    "hence , according to the central theorem of degenerate warped products from @xcite , the warped product between the two - dimensional extension @xmath44 and the sphere @xmath2 , with warping function @xmath43 , is degenerate .",
    "this is the needed extension of the schwarzschild solution .",
    "[ thm_metric_analytic_rho ] the metric in the coordinates @xmath45 is @xmath46    from it follows that @xmath47 from it follows that @xmath48    by substituting @xmath10 and @xmath9 into we get the result .",
    "[ thm_metric_analytic_det_g_rho ] the determinant of the metric in the new coordinates is @xmath49    direct calculation gives @xmath50    the common belief is that it is impossible to extend the schwarzschild metric so that it becomes smooth at the singularity , instead of becoming infinite . but",
    "this can be done , if we understand that the schwarzschild coordinates are singular at @xmath19 ( and so are the other known coordinate systems for the schwarzschild metric ) . to pass to a regular coordinate system from a singular one , we need to use a coordinate change which is singular , and the singularity in the coordinate change coincides with the singularity of the metric .",
    "this can be viewed as analogous to the eddington - finkelstein coordinate change , which removes the apparent singularity on the event horizon .",
    "in both cases the metric is made smooth at points where it was thought to be infinite , the only difference is that in our case , at @xmath19 , the metric becomes degenerate .",
    "[ thm_metric_analytic_r ] the function @xmath35 has the simplest expression when it depends on only one of the two variables , say @xmath31 . to find a coordinate change as we want ,",
    "let s assume that @xmath35 is the simplest function of @xmath31 , @xmath51 .",
    "the metric becomes @xmath52 @xmath53 @xmath54 the determinant of the metric becomes @xmath55 the four - metric takes the form @xmath56    [ thm_metric_analytic_r_t ] the example simplified the form of @xmath57 .",
    "we can , in addition , simplify @xmath58 .",
    "equation suggests that we take @xmath10 is a product between a power of @xmath31 and a function of @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "let s assume that it has the form @xmath59 , where @xmath60 in order to satisfy .",
    "hence , @xmath61 then , we have @xmath62 and @xmath63 the metric takes the form @xmath64 @xmath65 @xmath66 and its determinant @xmath67",
    "the four - metric is @xmath68    [ rem_jacobian ] when we pass from one coordinate sistem @xmath44 characterized by @xmath69 to another @xmath70 , characterized by @xmath71 , as in , the transformation has the jacobian singular at @xmath19 . to check this",
    ", we use @xmath72 .",
    "the jacobian is then @xmath73 and it is singular at @xmath74 .",
    "this seems to suggest that the different coordinate systems we found in the example [ thm_metric_analytic_r_t ] represent distinct solutions .",
    "this raises the following open question .",
    "can we find natural conditions ensuring the uniqueness of the analytic extensions of the schwarzschild solution at the singularity @xmath74 ? or can we consider all analytic extensions of this type to be equivalent , via coordinate changes which may be singular ?    to support the second possibility ,",
    "we can make the observation that the jacobian from the remark [ rem_jacobian ] is degenerate when we pass from a coordinate system characterized by @xmath75 to another one with another value of @xmath69 , but the converse is not true .",
    "in section  [ s_schw_analytic ] we found an infinite family of coordinate changes which make the metric smooth .",
    "as we shall see now , among these solutions there is one which ensures the semiregularity of the metric .",
    "[ thm_schw_semireg ] the schwarzschild metric admits an analytic extension in which the singularity at @xmath19 is semiregular .    to show that the metric is semiregular , it is enough to show that there is a coordinate system in which the products of the form @xmath76 are all smooth @xcite , where @xmath77 are christoffel s symbols of the first kind . in a coordinate system",
    "in which the metric is smooth , as in ",
    "[ s_schw_analytic ] , christoffel s symbols of the first kind are also smooth . but",
    "the inverse metric @xmath78 is not smooth for @xmath19 .",
    "we will show that the products from the expression are smooth .",
    "we use the solution from the example [ thm_metric_analytic_r_t ] , and try to find a value for @xmath69 , so that the metric is semiregular .",
    "the inverse of the metric has the coefficients given by @xmath79 , @xmath80 , and @xmath81 .",
    "it follows from ( [ eq_metric_coeff_analytic_tau_tau_tau_xi][eq_metric_coeff_analytic_xi_xi_tau_xi ] ) that    @xmath82    @xmath83    @xmath84    christoffel s symbols of the first kind are given by @xmath85 so we have to calculate the partial derivatives of the coefficients of the metric .",
    "from and ( [ eq_metric_coeff_analytic_tau_tau_tau_xi][eq_metric_coeff_analytic_xi_xi_tau_xi ] ) we have : @xmath86 hence @xmath87 similarly , @xmath88 @xmath89",
    "@xmath90 @xmath91 and @xmath92    to ensure that the expression is smooth , we use power counting and try to find a value of @xmath69 for which it does nt contain negative powers of @xmath31 .",
    "the least power of @xmath31 in the partial derivatives of the metric is @xmath93 , as we can see by inspecting equations ( [ eq_pd_tau_tau_tau][eq_pd_xi_xi_xi ] ) .",
    "the least power of @xmath31 in the inverse metric is @xmath94 , as it follows from the equations ( [ eq_metric_inv_coeff_semireg_tau_tau][eq_metric_inv_coeff_semireg_xi_xi ] ) .",
    "since @xmath95 , the condition that the least power of @xmath31 in is non - negative is @xmath96 with the unique solution @xmath97 hence , taking @xmath98 ensures the smoothness of , and by this , the semiregularity of the metric in two dimensions @xmath44 .",
    "when going back to four dimensions , we remember the central theorem of semiregular warped products from @xcite , stating that the warped product between the two - dimensional extension @xmath44 and the sphere @xmath2 , with warping function @xmath99 , is semiregular .",
    "it is useful to extract from the proof the expression of the metric :    the metric @xmath100 is an analytic extension of the schwarzschild metric , which is semiregular , including at the singularity @xmath19 .",
    "the riemann curvature tensor @xmath22 is smooth , because the metric is semiregular .",
    "how can it be smooth , when we know that the riemann curvature of the schwarzschild metric tends to infinity when it approaches the singularity @xmath19 ?",
    "the answer is that the coefficients of @xmath22 depend on the coordinate system .",
    "since the usual coordinates used with the schwarzschild black hole solution are singular with respect to ours , a tensor which is smooth in our coordinates may appear singular in schwarzschild coordinates . but this should not be a big surprise , because for the schwarzschild solution the ricci tensor is @xmath101 , hence the scalar curvature is @xmath101 too , and the einstein s equation is simply @xmath102 . on the other hand ,",
    "the kretschmann invariant @xmath17 still becomes infinite at @xmath19 , of course , being a scalar , and therefore remaining unchanged at the coordinate transforms .",
    "but it does become infinite only because @xmath103 becomes infinite .",
    "to move to penrose - carter coordinates , we apply the same steps as one usually applies for the schwarzschild black hole ( @xcite150 - 156 ) .",
    "more precisely , the lightlike coordinates for the penrose - carter diagram are @xmath104 where @xmath105 are the eddington - finkelstein lightlike coordinates @xmath106        usually , in the penrose - carter diagram of the schwarzschild spacetime is considered that the maximal analytic extension is given by the conditions @xmath107 and @xmath108 ( see fig .",
    "[ std - schwarzschild ] ) .",
    "this is because we have to stop at the singularity @xmath19 , because the infinite values we get prevent the analytic continuation .    to move from the coordinates @xmath44 to the penrose - carter coordinates , we use the substitution : @xmath109    our coordinates allow us to go beyond the singularity .",
    "as we can see from equation , our solution extends to negative @xmath31 as well . from",
    "we see that it is symmetric with respect to the hypersurface @xmath74 .",
    "this leads to the penrose - carter diagram from fig .",
    "[ semireg - schwarzschild ] .",
    "the main consequence of the extensibility of the schwarzschild solution to a semiregular solution beyond the singularity is that the information is not lost there .",
    "this can apply as well to the case of an evaporating black hole ( see fig . [ evaporating - bh - s ] ) .",
    "because of the no - hair theorem , the schwarzschild solution is representative for non - rotating and electrically neutral black holes .",
    "if the black hole evaporates , the information reaching the singularity is lost ( fig . [ evaporating - bh - s ] a ) .",
    "if the singularity is semiregular , it does nt destroy the topology of spacetime ( fig .",
    "[ evaporating - bh - s ] b ) . moreover , although normally in this case the covariant derivative and other differential operators ca nt be defined , there is a way to construct them naturally ( as shown in @xcite ) , allowing the rewriting of the field equations for the semiregular case , without running into infinities .",
    "this ensures that the field equations can go beyond the singularity .",
    "in the case of a black hole which is not primordial and evaporates completely in a finite time , all of the light rays traversing the singularity reach the past and future infinities .",
    "this means that the presence of a spacelike evaporating black hole is compatible with the global hyperbolicity , as in the diagram [ evaporating - bh - s ] b.    the singularity is accompanied by violent and very destructive forces .",
    "but , as we can see from the semiregular formulation , there is no reason to consider that it destroys the information or the structure of spacetime ."
