    "radio waves from astronomical sources have low intensities , and due to their long wavelengths , large radio telescopes are needed to gather signal and achieve resolutions comparable to optical telescopes . building large telescopes is mechanically and economically challenging .",
    "several schools , colleges and community astronomy clubs have optical telescopes , however , radio telescopes are not as famous due to their cost , the size and complexity of the data .",
    "we have developed a small , affordable radio telescope and data analysis tools to do amateur radio astronomy at such levels .",
    "+ for demonstrating the usefulness of such a set - up , we have measured the brightness temperature of the sun .",
    "we present how this can be used to measure the flux density of the sun and correlate them with presently available data .",
    "modifications in the observation techniques , which improved the sensitivity and enabled us to detect point sources such as saturn and extended sources such as the galactic arm , is also discussed here .",
    "the prime motivation behind this project was to assemble and operationalize a low - cost radio telescope for amateur radio astronomy , study the properties of the telescope components and finally establish an undergraduate level experiment in radio astronomy .",
    "one that teaches the rudiments of this very well established technology by providing the necessary experiments . + the setup has been proposed and assembled previously from ncra(asrt)@xcite , mit(vsrt)@xcite , nrao(ibt)@xcite , which was initially motivated by the works of cleary et .",
    "al(1993 ) @xcite .",
    "this provided the groundwork to build on .",
    "a block diagram of our assembled setup is shown in .",
    "the key components of the set up are :        1 .",
    "satellite antenna : satellite dish antenna consisting of a 68 cm parabolic dish reflector and an lnb ( low noise block ) .",
    "the lnb receives the radio signal from the satellite reflected by the dish and amplifies it .",
    "a set - top box powers the satellite finder and the lnb .",
    "satellite finder : a satellite signal meter is commonly used for orienting satellite dishes towards geostationary satellites .",
    "we have used a commercially available analog satellite finder ( * gc sf-02 * ) .",
    "such a device acts as a square law detector and is used to read directly the intensity .",
    "arduino uno : arduino is a microcontroller board with a 10 bit analog to digital converter for us . using this board , we digitize the intensity from the satellite finder at 10hz sampling rate .    the python pipeline for data acquisition and visualization can be found online.@xcite",
    "geostationary satellites emit polarized radiation , after pointing in the direction of satellites , the lnb was rotated to align the monopole inside in the direction of polarized radiation maximizing the detected signal intensity .",
    "pointing was done manually in all the cases , by firstly looking at the source altitude and azimuth in the local sky at that time , using stellarium and then rotating the dish about the two axes individually to point at the source location .",
    "the telescope was calibrated with geostationary satellites and power per unit voltage was calculated .",
    "for the temperature calculation , power density was calculated given aperture efficiency followed by the flux calculation . by assuming the sun s radiation to be thermal , the temperature was calculated following rayleigh - jeans law.@xcite see for detailed calculations .",
    "+ for beam - width calculation , the voltage data ( in dbv ) was fitted with a gaussian ( @xmath0 ) using python and full width at half maxima ( fwhm ) was calculated using the variance ( @xmath1 ) .",
    "provides the obtained values .",
    ", shows the drift scan of the sun .",
    "a gaussian was fit to the data and beam width of our telescope was characterized to be @xmath2 with less than 1% error .",
    "these are in agreement with standard online beam width calculators@xcite which estimate beam width of our system to be @xmath3 .",
    ".beam width calculated from graphs [ cols=\"^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      the radiometer equation gives us @xmath4 where , @xmath5 is rms receiver output fluctuation , @xmath6 is the bandwidth and @xmath7 is the integration time.@xcite the equation tells the reduction in noise when integration time is increased thus giving us a higher sensitivity .",
    "we increased our integration time from 1 second to 60 seconds , and drift scans were taken and for saturn and galactic arm ( as shown in fig .",
    "[ satgalplot ] ) .",
    "we report the detection of saturn with an signal to noise ratio ( snr ) of 3 .",
    "the sources were confirmed by correlating the time of arrival of the source signal in the field of view of our telescope with the predicted times by stellarium based on our pointing.@xcite fig.[stellarium ] shows the approximate path traced by the field of view of the telescope during the drift scan observation with respect to fig [ satgalplot ] .",
    "this radio telescope requiring only everyday items that make it affordable and a versatile tool to demonstrate the working of a radio telescope .",
    "the methods and calculations shown here give an all - round hands - on experience about fundamentals of radio telescopes , computer programming and data analysis with an inherent amateur astronomy in it .",
    "this radio telescope shows good response when customizations are made , which provides an opportunity to study the properties of the telescope itself .",
    "it has a very good response to the signal from geostationary satellites , and the pointing towards such point sources are easier due to the large beam width .",
    "+ sun , being a strong and easily detectable radio source , is easy to point at and study .",
    "drift - scan for the sun was performed , and data was fitted with a gaussian .",
    "this reveals an important property : the antenna beam width and provides a coherent idea about it . when backed up with satellite observation ( preferably near the same time ) the same drift - scan",
    "can be used to measure source flux and brightness temperature .",
    "+ the radiometer equation ( equation [ radiometer ] ) , shows that the noise is inversely proportional to the square root of the bandwidth of the telescope and the integration time .",
    "thus by increasing the integration time , we can reduce noise .",
    "most popular ammature telescopes like vsrt use rtl - sdr , which has a bandwidth of @xmath8 3 mhz@xcite , whereas , with the satellite finder we can utilize the full 1.1ghz bandwidth , thus giving us a higher sensitivity .",
    "although most undergrad institutions have such amateur astronomy programs , but radio astronomy is not popular among them .",
    "as we have shown , increase in sensitivity would give one the opportunity to look at many other sources than just the sun .",
    "all - sky visibility maps can be generated at a rudimentary level that would make one familiar with a bigger part of the radio sky .",
    "+        we measured the temperature of the lnb surroundings during observations .",
    "an increase in the voltage was observed with the rise in temperature .",
    "the voltage and the surrounding temperature plot increases linearly as shown in .",
    "the correlation coefficient between these two was obtainted to be 0.98 , confirming the linear dependence of voltage on the surrounding temperature change .",
