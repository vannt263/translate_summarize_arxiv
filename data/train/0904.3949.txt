    "the claplygin gas equation of state , given by @xmath2 was first presented in the reference @xcite in the context of the study of incompressible fluids .",
    "later , it has revealed important in the study of the aerodynamics problem @xcite .",
    "more recently , it has re - appeared as an example of a irrotational fluid that can be supersymmetrized @xcite .",
    "moreover , it has been discovered an interesting connection between this equation of state and the nambu - goto action of string theory written in the light - cone variables @xcite .",
    "its application to cosmology was first pointed out in @xcite .",
    "a phenomenological generalization has been proposed @xcite , such that the equation of state takes the form @xmath3 where @xmath4 is a free parameter , generally a positive number .",
    "the interest for the chaplygin gas model , and its phenomenological generalization , in cosmology emerged from the evidences in favor of an accelerating expansion of the universe at present time @xcite .",
    "these evidences ask for a fluid with negative pressure that begins to dominate the matter content of the universe at about @xmath5 ( @xmath6 being the cosmological redshift ) , whithout affecting the previous history of the universe .",
    "in particular the primordial nucleosynthesis , the transition from a radiation dominated universe to a matter dominated universe and , finally , the process of structure formation driven by cold dark matter must remain unaltered . in spite of being a natural candidate for the fluid responsible for the cosmic acceleration , the cosmological constant",
    "faces many theoretical and observational problems , mainly represented by the huge discrepancy of the observed and the predicted values , as well as the necessary fine tunning of its value to achieve an acceleration just as measured at present time .",
    "the chaplygin gas has revealed an interesting alternative to the so - called @xmath1cdm model .",
    "in fact , considering a friedmann - lematre - robertson - walker universe ( flrw ) , a fluid with energy density @xmath7 and pressure @xmath8 must satisfy the conservation law @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the scale of factor of the spatial section .",
    "for the equation of state ( [ eos ] ) , this equation can be easily integrated leading to @xmath11 where @xmath12 is an integration constant .",
    "the important point concerning ( [ sol1 ] ) is the fact that it contains relevant asymptotic regimes : as @xmath13 , i.e. as we go back to the past , @xmath14 , reproducing a pressureless fluid ( cold dark matter ) ; moreover , as @xmath15 , @xmath16 constant , leading to a behaviour typical of a cosmological constant .",
    "hence , the transition from a non - accelerating to an accelerating universe , can be achieved dynamically . at same time , the process of structure formation is guaranteeded by the fact that the chaplygin gas mimics cold dark matter at previous time .",
    "the confrontation of the chaplygin gas model with observations have shown that it is quite competitive with other dark matter / dark energy models , like the @xmath1cdm and quintessence models .",
    "however , there are some interesting aspects that point out to the necessity of more deep investigations . for example , while the confrontation with the supernova type ia ( sn ia ) data shows that the unification model is preferred @xcite , that is essentially no exotic new component besides the chaplygin gas , the structure formation analysis reveal that a large amount of extra dark matter is still needed @xcite .",
    "moreover , supernova data seems to favor , in the case of the generalized chaplygin gas model , negatives values of the parameter @xmath4 .",
    "if we turn now structure formation , the study of the cases with negative values of @xmath4 becomes more sensible since this implies imaginary sound velociy , hence plagued with instabilities @xcite . finally ,",
    "mainly in the case of structure formation , the results may be sensitive on how the chaplygin gas is represented , that is , if it is viewed as a tachyonic field , a fluid or a self - interacting scalar field .",
    "our goal here is to consider this last problem : how the use of different representations of the chaplygin gas affects the final estimation of the cosmological parameters .",
    "we use the sn ia data and the 2dfgrs data for the matter power spectrum . in special",
    ", we will show that the tachyonic and fluid representations give the same results even for the matter power spectrum .",
    "however , the self - interacting scalar field , even if it admits in principle an extension for negative values for the parameter @xmath4 when the generalized chaplygin gas is considered , leads to very different parameter estimations .    from now on , for the sake of simplicity",
    ", we will work only with the traditional chaplygin gas model defined by the equation of state ( [ eos ] ) .",
    "the tachyonic formulation can be obtained from the lagrangian @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the tachyonic field .",
    "the corresponding energy - momentum tensor is then given by @xmath19 for the case of the flrw fllat universe , this energy - moment tensor leads to the following expressions for the energy density and for the pressure : @xmath20 thus , equation ( [ eos ] ) with @xmath21 constant implies that @xmath22 must be a constant , that is , independent of @xmath18 .",
    "for some interesting generalizations with a non - constant @xmath22 see , for example , @xcite .",
    "let us consider now the energy - momentum tensor of a perfect fluid , @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the four - velocity of the fluid . introducing small perturbations around a background value ( @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 ) , using the synchronous coordinate condition @xmath29",
    ", we obtain at first order the following expressions : @xmath30 using now the expression ( [ tachyon ] ) , we obtain @xmath31 hence , the fluid approach represented by ( [ eos ] ) reproduces the features of the tachyonic model described by ( [ lag - tach ] ) at the background and at the perturbative levels .    since the tachyonic fluid",
    "is entirely acquainted by the fluid represntation ( at classical level , of course ) , let us consider the einstein s equation coupled to baryonic matter and the chaplygin gas .",
    "the field equations read , @xmath32 the superscript ( subscript ) @xmath33 and @xmath34 stands for _ baryons _ and _",
    "chaplygin_.    we perturb now these field equations , using again the synchronous coordinate conditon .",
    "we divide all equations by the hubble parameter today @xmath35 in order to make the equations dimensionless .",
    "we end up with the following set of coupled equations for the perturbed quantites : @xmath36 in these expressions @xmath37 and @xmath38 are the density contrast for baryons and for the chaplygin gas respectively , while @xmath39 is the perturbation in the four velocity connected with the chaplygin gas .",
    "we have noted @xmath40 , which is the sound velocity of the chaplygin gas fluid , with @xmath41 being the corresponding energy density today .",
    "passing now from the ( dimensionless ) time variable @xmath42 to the scale factor variable @xmath10 , the above equations take the following form : @xmath43 the primes mean derivative with respect to @xmath10 and @xmath44 is the hubble radius today .",
    "moreover , we have the following definitions : @xmath45 note that the sound speed of the fluid plays an important rle , in particular multiplying the term originated from the gradient of pressure in equation ( [ pe3a ] ) .",
    "it is this fact that leads to instabilities problems when the generalized chaplygin gas model , with @xmath4 negative , is considered .     and @xmath46 using only the 2dfgrs data ( left ) , only the sn ia data ( center ) and the joint probability from both sets of data .",
    "the lighter is the region , the higher is the associated probability density . ]     and @xmath46 using only the 2dfgrs data ( left ) , only the sn ia data ( center ) and the joint probability from both sets of data .",
    "the lighter is the region , the higher is the associated probability density . ]     and @xmath46 using only the 2dfgrs data ( left ) , only the sn ia data ( center ) and the joint probability from both sets of data .",
    "the lighter is the region , the higher is the associated probability density . ]",
    "we note that , concerning the matter power spectrum we have two free parameters : @xmath49 ( or equivalently @xmath50 , since @xmath51 ) and @xmath46 . for the sn",
    "ia analysis we have one more free parameter : the hubble reduced parameter @xmath52 defined by @xmath53 .",
    "we use the @xmath54 statistical function which gives the quality of the fitting of the observational data by the theoretical model ( see @xcite ) . marginalizing the probability distribution function for the sn ia data in the variable @xmath52 ( it means , integrating in this variable )",
    ", we end up with two sets of observational constraints , for the 2dfgrs and sn ia data , depending on the parameters @xmath46 and @xmath49 .",
    "we compute now the probability distribution function using the 2dfgrs power spectrum data .",
    "the initial conditions are fixed using the prescription described in reference @xcite .",
    "the luminosity distance is also computed , for the gold sample , by using the method sketched in @xcite .",
    "the results are shown in figure 1 , where the two - dimensional pdf using only power spectrum data , only the sn ia data and the joint probability are displayed . in figure 2 ,",
    "the corresponding estimations for the one - dimensional pdf for the matter density today are shown , while in the figure 3 the one - dimensional pdf for the sound velocity @xmath46 for the three sets of data is displayed .",
    "the results for the sn ia data agree with those described in reference @xcite : the unified scenario , with essentially no dark matter , is preferred ; at the same time , very large values for @xmath46 , that is , the `` quasi''-@xmath1cdm models , are also preferred . using the 2dfgrs data , the conclusions of references @xcite",
    "are re - obtained : the anti - unified model , with essentially all matter in the form of dark matter , is preferred ; for the parameter @xmath46 , again large values are preferred , but there is also a high probability distribution near zero .",
    "the combination of both data privilegize the scenarios indicated by the 2dfgrs even if some new effects appear like the maximum value for the pdf of @xmath55 for the joint sn ia and 2dfgrs data in figure 2 .",
    "but there is some subtle points concerning this : if the joint higher dimensional pdf in the parameter space is first constructed , as we have done in the present work , than the results are those displyaed in the figure @xmath56 ; however , if the corresponding one - dimensional pdf s are combined after the marginalization on the other variables , the conclusions are very different , in the sense that the sn ia data are favored .",
    "but , we think the first procedure is more consistent .",
    "now , we look for a self - interacting scalar field that mimics the chaplygin gas model in presence of a baryonic component .",
    "the equations of motion are now the following : @xmath57 this system of equations is equivalent to the system ( [ fe1],[fe2 ] ) if the derivative of the @xmath58 and the potential @xmath59 are given in terms of the scale factor as @xmath60^{1/4}},\\\\ \\label{r2 } v & = & \\frac{3}{2}\\omega_{c0}\\frac{2\\bar a   + \\frac{(1 - \\bar a)}{a^6}}{\\sqrt{\\bar a + \\frac{1 - \\bar a}{a^6}}}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] these relations allow to define implicitly @xmath59 as function of @xmath58 .",
    "in fact , using the friedmann equation , it is possible to integrate ( [ r1 ] ) .",
    "however , apparently there is no way to have a closed expression for @xmath59 as function of @xmath58 , except in the case the baryonic component is absent @xcite .",
    "but , for our purposes , all we need are the relations ( [ r1],[r2 ] ) .",
    "we perturb now the einstein - scalar field system using again the synchronous gauge condition .",
    "following the same steps as before , and re - expressing the final equations in terms of the variable @xmath10 ( the scale factor ) we end up with the following set of coupled equations : @xmath61 in these expressions , @xmath62 , @xmath63 and @xmath64 are defined as before , @xmath65 , with @xmath66 given by ( [ r1 ] ) and @xmath67 .",
    "moreover , we have the following definitions : @xmath68 the subscript @xmath10 indicates derivatives with respect to the variable @xmath10 .",
    "this system has the advantage of admitting a straighforward extension to the generalized chaplygin gas model without present instability problems when @xmath4 is negative .",
    "in fact , as in the case of any usual scalar theory , the laplacian term that generates the dependence on the wavenumber @xmath69 does not contain the sound velocity , as it happens in the fluid reprsentation .",
    "however , at the same time , this scalar version of the chaplygin gas model leads to complete different predictions concerning the parameter estimations .",
    "the figures @xmath56 , @xmath70 and @xmath71 show the two - dimensional and one - dimensional pdf for the parameters @xmath49 and @xmath46 , using only the 2dfgrs or the sn ia data , and when the joint probability are considered .",
    "the sn ia results are the same as before , since it is sensitive to the background only .",
    "but , the results for the matter parameter density using the 2dfgrs are completely different : they predict a small value for @xmath49 , as it is obtained for the @xmath1cdm or quintessence models , together with a smaller pic of probability near @xmath72 .",
    "the 2dfgrs data favors a small , but non null , value for @xmath46 while the sn ia favors a value of @xmath46 near @xmath73 .",
    "the joint probability gives a maximum value for the probability for values of @xmath46 near @xmath74 .     and",
    "@xmath46 using only the 2dfgrs data ( left ) , only the sn ia data ( center ) and the joint probability from both sets of data .",
    "the lighter is the region , the higher is the associated probability density . ]     and @xmath46 using only the 2dfgrs data ( left ) , only the sn ia data ( center ) and the joint probability from both sets of data . the lighter is the region , the higher is the associated probability density . ]     and @xmath46 using only the 2dfgrs data ( left ) , only the sn ia data ( center ) and the joint probability from both sets of data .",
    "the lighter is the region , the higher is the associated probability density . ]                hence , the scalar version of the chaplygin gas model keeps the property of the original formulation , in terms of the tachyonic field , only for the background . as a consequence it seems that in the analysis of the structure formation , and considering the generalized chaplygin gas model , we must consider a space parameter where only the positive values of @xmath4 are allowed",
    "this may force also to restrict the sn ia analysis to this region of the space parameter .",
    "of course , the final estimations for the cosmological parameter sare modified by this restriction ( see discussion in @xcite ) .",
    "we hope to present a full analysis of this issue in a future paper .",
