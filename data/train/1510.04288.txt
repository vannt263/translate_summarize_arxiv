    "therefore , a possible role of these events as sources of cosmic gamma - ray bursts has been proposed already decades ago @xcite .",
    "well localized short gamma - ray bursts ( sgrbs ) provide observational support for such a connection in particular because of their low - density environments , partially large offsets from their galactic hosts and their occurrence also in galaxies with low star - formation activity @xcite .",
    "ns - ns and ns - bh mergers can produce bh - torus systems as remnants , or in the former case also massive neutron stars ( mnss ) , which could be transiently or long - term stable , depending on their mass and the uncertain nuclear equation of state ( eos ) .",
    "the grb is understood as consequence of highly collimated , ultrarelativistic polar outflows or jets of low - density plasma or poynting flux , whose energy is partly converted to @xmath25-rays at distances of @xmath26@xmath27 cm , far away from the compact remnant ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . as possible energy sources to drive these jets , the annihilation of neutrino - antineutrino pairs radiated by the hot accretion torus is discussed ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) or the energy release by magnetohydrodynamic effects , poynting flux ( e.g. * ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) or electron - positron pair production @xcite associated with ultrastrong magnetic fields threading the bh - torus system or mns and their environments .",
    "individual aspects and special questions of these scenarios have been intensively investigated previously , for example the emergence of a jet - favorable magnetic field configuration in ns - ns / bh mergers @xcite , the efficiency of neutrino production in accretion disks and tori with steady - state accretion rate ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the efficiency of neutrino - antineutrino ( @xmath28- ) annihilation above the poles of a bh ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , or the jet acceleration and collimation by the interaction with the accretion torus , non - relativistic winds @xcite or the ejecta from dynamical ns - ns mergers @xcite .",
    "also , time - dependent and self - consistent hydrodynamic simulations of bh - torus remnants including some neutrino treatment have been performed to study neutrino emission and annihilation @xcite .    in this work",
    "we focus on the neutrino - powered grb scenario . for the first time",
    ", we simulate ( in axisymmetry ) the evolution of bh - torus systems including ( magnetic - field related ) viscosity effects , energy - dependent neutrino transport and @xmath28-annihilation .",
    "moreover , we include self - consistently the formation of relativistic polar outflows and their interaction with the rapidly expanding , subrelativistic ejecta shell that is dynamically expelled during binary ns merging . the considered ejecta and remnant conditions ( masses , spins , expansion velocities , energies ) are set up in accordance with relativistic ns - ns and ns - bh merger simulations .",
    "the goal of our study is to investigate the requirements for neutrino - powered grb jets .",
    "the simulations were performed with the alcar code @xcite that solves the equations of hydrodynamics along with a multi - energy group m1-type scheme for the neutrino transport .",
    "most input physics is adopted from bh - torus simulations presented in @xcite .",
    "however , we now use a special relativistic instead of a newtonian solver for the euler equations , allowing us to accurately follow relativistic jet outflows .",
    "note that in the bulk of the disk the conditions are at most mildly relativistic , hence the torus evolution and the properties of the subrelativistic ejecta as described in @xcite remain essentially unaffected by switching to the relativistic solver .",
    "for the same reason we keep using the newtonian version of the viscosity terms .",
    "the transport of electron neutrinos and antineutrinos employs 10 energy groups distributed logarithmically within @xmath29 $ ] and source terms for absorption , emission and scattering interactions with free nucleons ( as given in @xcite ) .",
    "the velocities entering the neutrino transport are subject to the restrictions explained in @xcite .",
    "energy- and momentum - transfer rates due to @xmath28-annihilation are calculated from the annihilation - rate 4-vector ( @xcite , typos corrected by @xcite ) expressed in terms of the evolved neutrino moments ( analogously to eq .  10 of * ? ? ? * ) and are used as source terms for the hydrodynamic equations . since we are only interested in the effects of annihilation near the baryon - poor funnel , we ignore annihilation in regions where the density @xmath30g@xmath31 or where neutrino cooling dominates heating .",
    "we apply a microphysical equation of state ( including a 4-species baryon gas , electrons , positrons and photons ) , the pseudo - newtonian gravitational potential by @xcite , and a viscosity scheme using @xmath4 to parametrize magnetohydrodynamic , turbulent angular momentum transport ( @xcite ; in the version denoted as `` type 2 '' in @xcite ) .",
    "the initial torus equilibrium configuration is computed as described in @xcite for given initial mass , @xmath1 , and dimensionless spin parameter , @xmath2 , of the bh , and torus mass , @xmath3 ( see @xcite and references therein for details ) . for these quantities",
    "we adopt values guided by merger simulations that were performed ( and partially discussed in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) with a relativistic smoothed - particle hydrodynamics ( sph ) code using the conformal flatness condition @xcite .    to take into account the envelope of material  mostly containing dynamical ejecta  around the bh - torus system formed during the merger ,",
    "we map the azimuthally averaged distributions of density , electron fraction , pressure , and velocity from the corresponding original merger model onto the grid regions surrounding our manually constructed torus .",
    "we utilize the sph configurations resulting at about @xmath3215ms after the bh formation and identify the isotropic coordinate radius with our radial coordinate @xmath33 ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for details concerning the dynamical ejecta ) . however , we disregard all material from the merger model for radii @xmath34 km because , first , the inconsistency between both radius versions grows for smaller radii , and second , because the original sph torus is replaced by our self - constructed torus . the remaining volume surrounding the torus and envelope",
    "is initially filled with a dynamically irrelevant amount of cold gas having a density of @xmath35g@xmath31 for @xmath36 km and @xmath37 for higher radii .",
    "we assume equatorial and axi - symmetry and use spherical polar coordinates .",
    "however , although we simulate only one hemisphere we always take into account both hemispheres for volume integration .",
    "the radial grid consists of 800 zones of exponentially increasing width and extends from @xmath32(12)@xmath38 cm up to @xmath323@xmath39 cm .",
    "the angular grid consists of 120 zones linearly distributed within the domain @xmath40 $ ] and another 120 zones of exponentially increasing width covering @xmath41 $ ] .",
    "we validated numerical convergence of our main results .",
    "we consider three ns - ns merger models ( table  [ tab : jetmodels ] ) .",
    "model sfho_145145 is characterized by symmetric progenitor masses , @xmath42 , and a delayed ( @xmath3210ms ) bh formation after the merger , while models sfho_1218 and tm1_13520 result from asymmetric mergers and prompt bh formation .",
    "hence @xcite , compared to the former model both latter models exhibit a lower total envelope mass , @xmath5 , and a reduced fraction of mass , @xmath43 , located in the two polar cones with @xmath44 half - opening angle ( @xmath45 would result for an isotropic distribution ) , while the corresponding average velocities , @xmath46 , are higher ( table  [ tab : jetmodels ] ) .",
    "two models with different values of @xmath4 are added to investigate the dependence on viscosity . for model tm1_1451 linked to a ns - bh merger ( table  [ tab : jetmodels ] )",
    "we do not map any material from the merger simulation onto our grid , because in ns - bh mergers the dynamical ejecta are almost exclusively expelled in the equatorial direction ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and therefore have a strongly reduced impact on the jet compared to ns - ns mergers .    to assess the efficiency of @xmath28-annihilation for most optimistic cases , we employ favorable rather than typical merger configurations ( except for sfho_145145 , e.g. @xcite ) , slightly overestimated torus masses ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and a neutrino treatment that tends to overestimate the @xmath28-annihilation rates near the poles ( see the comparison of m1 with ray - tracing results in * ? ? ?",
    "the time evolution of several quantities characterizing the @xmath28-annihilation is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : jet_time ] .",
    "all modeled tori traverse the two evolutionary phases denoted as ndaf and adaf ( neutrino- and advection - dominated accretion flow , respectively ; see e.g. , @xcite ) . in the ndaf phase the temperatures and thus neutrino production rates are high enough for viscous heating to be efficiently compensated by neutrino emission , while in the subsequent adaf phase neutrino reactions cease and ultimately freeze out owing to low temperatures . during the ndaf phase torus mass accreted onto the bh per unit of time , @xmath47 ,",
    "is converted into energy - emission rates ( i.e. luminosities ) of both neutrino species , @xmath48 , with an efficiency @xmath49 ( with the speed of light @xmath50 ) of a few per cent ( fig .",
    "[ fig : jet_time ] ) . after being emitted , a fraction of neutrinos pair - annihilate , giving rise to a local heating rate , @xmath51 ( figs .",
    "[ fig : cont_sfho145145]  [ fig : cont_tm11451 ] ) , which is highest close to the bh , since here the neutrino densities are largest , and steeply decreases with radius .",
    "the total annihilation rate , @xmath52 ( with the integral performed only in the two polar cones with @xmath44 half - opening angle ) , is roughly proportional to @xmath53 , multiplied by additional factors accounting for the geometry of the emitting region and the preference for high neutrino",
    "mean energies @xmath54 ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the annihilation efficiency , @xmath55 , is therefore approximately proportional to @xmath56 ( noting that @xmath57 ) . because @xmath58 decreases roughly like @xmath47 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : jet_time ] ) , @xmath59 declines earlier than @xmath60 and , hence , the time @xmath14 , at which @xmath61 of the final @xmath9 has been deposited , is significantly shorter than the duration of the ndaf phase , @xmath13 , defined as the time when @xmath60 drops below @xmath62 ( table  [ tab : jetmodels ] ) .",
    "the comparison between the models is facilitated by considering ( table  [ tab : jetmodels ] ) the global versions of the aforementioned efficiencies , @xmath63 and @xmath64 with @xmath65 , by which means the total annihilation energy @xmath66 .",
    "the emission efficiency , @xmath67 , is similar for all models ( up to some reduction for higher viscosity caused by enhanced neutrino trapping at very early times ) .",
    "the main reason for this similarity are the comparable values of the dimensionless bh spin , @xmath2 , for all models , which determine the amount of specific gravitational energy that can be released by gas before being accreted . since approximately @xmath68 we infer that @xmath12 should grow for higher values of @xmath3 and @xmath4 , and a lower value of @xmath1 .",
    "this turns out to be broadly consistent with our results . in the ns - bh model",
    "the positive effect of the high torus mass is more than counterbalanced by the reduced neutrino mean energies , @xmath54 , compared to the ns - ns models ( fig .",
    "[ fig : jet_time ] ) and by the high bh mass , which leads to a longer accretion timescale .",
    "finally , the upper limit of energy available for any potential jet , represented by @xmath9 , is given by @xmath69erg in our models .",
    "the corresponding isotropic equivalent energies are almost independent of the polar angle ( because of the approximate isotropy of the annihilation rates , see figs .  [",
    "fig : cont_sfho145145]  [ fig : cont_tm11451 ] ) with @xmath70erg ( table  [ tab : jetmodels ] ) .      if and how much of @xmath9 can finally end up in an ultrarelativistic outflow depends crucially on the distribution of matter surrounding the torus .",
    "this is illustrated in figs .",
    "[ fig : cont_sfho145145]  [ fig : cont_tm11451 ] for three representative models , of which each exhibits a qualitatively different outflow evolution .    in model sfho_145145 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : cont_sfho145145 ] ) the amount of baryonic pollution near the symmetry axis is so high that neutrino irradiation has hardly any impact , besides slightly accelerating the already expanding dynamical ejecta and raising their electron fraction , @xmath71 .",
    "the high densities are too prohibitive for annihilation to form a baryon - poor funnel , which is ultimately needed to produce high lorentz factors .    in models sfho_1218",
    "[ fig : cont_sfho1218 ] ) and tm1_13520 the configuration is better suited for the development of relativistic outflows because the poles are loaded with relatively small amounts of matter . hence , in both models funnels are successfully created , allowing jets to form and to expand outwards along the axis .",
    "similar to jets in collapsars ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the jets consist of thin , ultrarelativistic beams surrounded by cocoons and mildly relativistically propagating heads .",
    "right after the jets are launched , essentially all annihilation energy dumped into the funnels is used to power the beams , immediately increasing @xmath72 ( where @xmath73 and @xmath74 are lorentz factor and specific enthalpy , respectively ) , which for adiabatic expansion represents an estimate for the terminal lorentz factor .",
    "therefore , the energy carried by material with @xmath75 and 100 , @xmath76 , rises .",
    "the subsequent expansion of beam material then allows thermal energy to be converted into kinetic energy , leading to a growth also of @xmath15 , the energy of material with @xmath77 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : jet_time ] for the time evolution of @xmath76 , @xmath15 ) .",
    "however , the beam can not expand freely as long as the jet is enveloped by dynamical ejecta . hence , while being fed with annihilation energy at its base , the jet continually loses energy by drilling through the envelope .",
    "this happens at the expense of beam energy , which is transported to and dissipated at the much more slowly moving head .",
    "once dissipated , this part of the energy is advected into the cocoon and is ultimately lost as potential contribution to a relativistic outflow .",
    "that is , only the fraction of original annihilation energy that is induced into the beam shortly before and after the time of an eventual break - out from the envelope could possibly be released within a relativistic outflow .",
    "however , in the considered ns - ns merger models the jet is not energetic enough to break out , which is why @xmath76 successively decreases and finally vanishes ( figs .",
    "[ fig : jet_time ] ,  [ fig : cont_sfho1218 ] ) .",
    "model tm1_1451 , associated with a ns - bh merger , offers the most optimistic configuration for relativistic outflows , because the polar regions are essentially free of dynamical ejecta .",
    "however , neutrino - driven winds and the expansion of torus matter by viscous or other effects could still prohibit or impair the emergence of relativistic ejecta . nevertheless , model tm1_1451 develops a powerful relativistic wind that contains 61% ( 48% ) of the original annihilation energy in the form of @xmath78 ( @xmath79 ) , as measured at @xmath80s ( fig .",
    "[ fig : jet_time ] ) .",
    "the radius - dependent half - opening angle of the outflow , @xmath81 , reflects the temporal change of the torus configuration ( fig .",
    "[ fig : cont_tm11451 ] ) : at early times the torus is rather compact and can barely collimate the outflow , while subsequently the outer torus layers undergo viscous and neutrino - driven expansion and form a funnel , of which the walls collimate the outflow .",
    "hence , the outflow consists of an ultrarelativistic ( @xmath82 ) core surrounded by less relativistic ( @xmath83 ) wings ( see table  [ tab : jetmodels ] for the corresponding energies and half - opening angles ) .",
    "interestingly , the collimation leads to a remarkable enhancement of the isotropic - equivalent energy of the ultrarelativistic core , @xmath84erg , compared to that of annihilation , @xmath85erg .",
    "the distribution of @xmath73 and the opening angles can still change somewhat after the final simulation time of @xmath86s because of a sizable fraction of the energy still residing in internal energy .",
    "however , the coarser grid at higher radii renders the late evolution more prone to numerical diffusion , which is why @xmath87 decreases at late times and we stopped the simulation .",
    "we investigated the ability of @xmath28-annihilation to represent the dominant agent for generating sgrb viable outflows .",
    "in contrast to previous studies , which either computed the annihilation rates on a stationary background without any hydrodynamic feedback ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) or which launched the outflow artificially ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we self - consistently followed the combined neutrino - hydrodynamic evolution of the bh - torus system , the eventual launch of the jet in response to heating by @xmath28-annihilation , and the jet propagation through the envelope of dynamical ejecta produced during the binary merger .",
    "our examined set of models covers the most relevant ns - ns and ns - bh configurations in the sense that they are both promising regarding the annihilation mechanism but still realistic enough to be abundantly present in nature .",
    "we find that the total energy provided by annihilation , @xmath9 , amounts to a fraction of about 10@xmath8810@xmath89 of the original torus rest - mass energy .",
    "although this fraction grows with torus mass and viscosity , and for lower bh mass , we find typical values of @xmath9 not exceeding a few @xmath90erg .    in the ns - bh merger remnant , which is essentially free of polar dynamical ejecta",
    ", annihilation heating is efficiently translated into a relativistic outflow , whose ultrarelativistic ( @xmath91 ) core is dynamically collimated to a half - opening angle @xmath92 and an isotropic - equivalent energy @xmath84erg .",
    "however , compared to the median values of observed sgrbs ( @xmath93erg and @xmath94 , see @xcite ) , our results suggest that the annihilation mechanism is energetically too inefficient to explain the majority of sgrbs , but still could account for some low - luminosity events .",
    "this conclusion is further supported by our result that the effective time of source activity obtained for our models is @xmath95s and thus much shorter than most observed times @xmath96 of sgrbs @xcite .",
    "a lower viscosity or higher bh spin could possibly alleviate but not solve this issue .",
    "moreover , our simulations suggest that the @xmath28-annihilation energies in ns - ns mergers are too low to launch jets energetically enough to pierce through the envelope of dynamical ejecta , even in the most optimistic case of prompt bh formation and very asymmetric progenitors , which results in less baryon - polluted polar regions .",
    "if sgrbs are connected with ns - ns mergers , our results indicate that some other , probably magnetohydrodynamic processes ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) are necessary at least to create and support a baryon - poor funnel through which the outflow can propagate without major dissipation .",
    "once a funnel is established , however , @xmath28-annihilation could still play a non - negligible role in powering the outflow .",
    "although we consider only ns - ns systems here where the mns collapses rather early , our conclusions probably also hold for longer delay times .",
    "then an even greater envelope mass would have to be penetrated by the jet because of the additional neutrino- and magnetically driven outflows from the mns @xcite .",
    "we finally point out that several simplifications entered this study , e.g. the omission of accurate general relativistic effects , the use of viscosity to mimic magnetohydrodynamic turbulence , initial models that were not fully consistent with the merger remnants , and the remaining approximations of the neutrino transport .",
