    "observations indicate that every massive galaxy contains a supermassive black hole in its nucleus , which shines as a quasar during episodes of rapid mass accretion .",
    "the vigorous gas inflows needed to fuel the most luminous quasars are thought to be triggered by galaxy mergers , in which tidal interactions channel large amounts of gas into the central @xmath2 pc @xcite .",
    "the maximum luminosities of quasars are strongly correlated with the properties of their host galaxies @xcite , in accordance with the tight correlations observed between black hole mass and stellar bulge mass @xcite and velocity dispersion @xcite in quiescent galaxies .    given these correlations ,",
    "the recent discovery @xcite of a bright ( @xmath3 ) quasar at redshift @xmath4 apparently _ not _ surrounded by a massive host galaxy is surprising indeed .",
    "for emission at the eddington luminosity , the inferred black hole mass is @xmath5 .",
    "there is a neighboring , luminous starburst galaxy at a separation of @xmath6 corresponding to 7.2 kpc for a flat universe with a present - day hubble parameter @xmath7 , and a matter density parameter @xmath8 .",
    "this companion galaxy has a disturbed morphology and is heavily obscured by dust , typical of the ultra - luminous infrared galaxies ( ulirgs ) systematically associated with near equal - mass mergers @xcite .",
    "its visual magnitude is @xmath9 .",
    "close to the quasar lies a bright blob about 2 kpc across , consisting of gas ionized by the quasar radiation .",
    "the spectrum of the blob shows no stellar component and no dust extinction ; hence the host galaxy can not be hidden by dust .",
    "the typical host for an @xmath3 quasar is an elliptical galaxy with @xmath10 , about the magnitude of the neighboring ulirg .",
    "however after carefully deconvolving a new hst image of the system , magain et al .  find no sign of any such galaxy surrounding this quasar .",
    "fixing the half - light radius at @xmath11 kpc ( a typical size for the host of an @xmath12 quasar ) , they put a conservative upper limit of @xmath13 , @xmath14 fainter than expected , on the magnitude of any host . alternatively , adopting @xmath9 for the host magnitude , they set an upper limit of @xmath2 pc on @xmath15 , much too small for a normal galaxy of this magnitude .",
    "we suggest that the quasar observed in he0450 - 2958 may be a black hole that was ejected from the nucleus of the companion galaxy during the major merger causing its disturbed appearance .",
    "the gas now fueling the quasar was dragged with it from the galactic center when it was kicked out . if one of the merging galaxies harbored a binary black hole , then when the black hole from the other galaxy entered the system a complex 3-body interaction would ensue , shortly ending with the ejection of the lightest black hole at a velocity of order the binary orbital velocity @xcite .",
    "this scenario implies that one of the merging galaxies was relatively gas - poor ( perhaps a giant elliptical ) , to allow survival of the binary against gasdynamical friction for a hubble time before the merger . on the other hand at least one of the galaxies",
    "must have been gas - rich , in order to fuel the quasar .",
    "the two galaxies must have been close in mass , to explain the ulirg appearance of the merger remnant and the high inferred black hole mass of the quasar , since it is the lightest body that gets ejected .",
    "the eddington accretion rate for a black hole of mass @xmath16 @xmath17 is @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the proton mass , @xmath20 the thomson cross - section , and @xmath21 is the radiative efficiency .",
    "it takes @xmath22 yr for the black hole to reach a turnaround radius of 7.2 kpc , so in order to remain shining with @xmath23 at the observed distance the black hole must drag at least @xmath24 of its own mass with it in gas when it is ejected .",
    "the distances of closest approach in our three - body interactions are often larger than the radius containing this mass in an @xmath25disk @xcite , and so the inner accretion disk can follow the black hole throughout the interaction and get ejected with it .",
    "when two galaxies of comparable mass merge , their black holes sink to the center by dynamical friction and form a gravitationally bound binary . once the binary separation reaches the `` hardening radius '' , @xmath26/4 \\sigma^{2}\\sim$](15 ) pc for massive galaxies ( where @xmath27 is the 1d stellar velocity dispersion and @xmath28 are the black hole masses ) , its further reduction is dominated by close encounters with stars that pass within the binary orbit .",
    "these stars undergo strong 3-body interactions with the binary and escape its vicinity with speeds comparable to the binary orbital speed .",
    "only stars on nearly radial orbits can contribute to the hardening of the binary in this stage .",
    "in the low - density nuclei of massive elliptical galaxies , the total mass in stars on these so - called `` loss cone '' orbits is small compared to the mass of the binary . since the two - body relaxation time",
    "is long compared to the hubble time , stars can not diffuse back into the loss cone as fast as they are kicked out . if all stars on loss cone orbits run out",
    ", the decay of the binary ceases . since the binary ejects of order its own mass in stars per @xmath29-folding in radius , one naively expects binaries in the cores of massive elliptical galaxies to stall at separations of order 1 pc .",
    "if the separation reaches @xmath300.01 - 0.1pc , then the binary would quickly coalesce through the emission of gravitational radiation .",
    "the question of whether and how it crosses the gap from @xmath30 1 pc to this smaller scale is known as the `` final parsec problem '' @xcite .",
    "black hole binaries may coalesce in some cases but not others .",
    "for example , the mass of any close binary companion to the nuclear black hole of the milky way is limited to @xmath31 by the keplerian orbits of stars near the galactic center @xcite .",
    "the so - called x - shaped radio galaxies have been explained as jets bent by sudden changes in the spin of a black hole upon coalescence with a binary companion @xcite .",
    "gas drag may lead to coalescence in gas - rich mergers @xcite ; however the gas - poor cores of massive ellipticals could allow binaries to stall .",
    "there are some tentative observational hints that sub - parsec scale binaries exist , including periodic variations and double - peaked broad line profiles in active galaxies , and central minima in the surface brightness profiles of some early type galaxies which are possibly associated with the clearing of the loss cone around stalled binaries @xcite .",
    "when an unequal mass black hole binary coalesces by gravitational radiation , the waves carry off a net linear momentum and the merged black hole recoils in the opposite direction @xcite .",
    "however 300 km s@xmath32 is a reasonable upper limit to the velocity achievable by this mechanism @xcite .",
    "a mass ejected radially at 300 km s@xmath32 from the center of the average stellar spheroid hosting a @xmath33 black hole ( @xmath34 , @xmath35 kpc ) would only reach a distance of @xmath36 pc before turning around , far smaller than the separation of the quasar in he0450 - 2958 from its companion galaxy .    if a binary stalls and its host galaxy merges with another galaxy , a third black hole may spiral in and undergo strong three - body interactions with the pair .",
    "the merger event will drive mass through the binary at a significant rate , partially refilling the loss cone , but the final stages of the merger transpire so rapidly that the intruder is likely to arrive in the vicinity of the binary before the binary has a chance to coalesce @xcite .",
    "the three - body interaction will end in the hardening of the binary by an amount comparable to its initial binding energy , and the ejection of the lightest body at a speed comparable to the binary s orbital speed @xcite .",
    "the binary s orbital speed at the stalling radius is a few times @xmath27 , i.e. of order the escape velocity @xmath37 from the stellar bulge ( e.g. for a hernquist profile @xcite @xmath38 with @xmath39 ) .",
    "thus , qualitatively we expect three - body kicks to yield ejection velocities of order the bulge escape velocity , resulting in many near - ejections .",
    "this is consistent with the large distance and low velocity of the he0450 - 2958 quasar relative to the ulirg .",
    "figure 1 shows an example of such a near - escape trajectory .",
    "to make our dynamical arguments more quantitative , we ran a series of 83,250 3-body scattering experiments using sverre aarseth s ks - regularized @xcite chain code @xcite to compute the black hole trajectories . in each case",
    "the intruder s mass was set to @xmath40 and the masses of the initial binary members were chosen uniformly in their logarithm between 1.0 and 3.5 times the mass of the intruder , a generic range for major mergers . from here on we will refer to the initial black hole binary as the inner binary and the `` binary '' formed by the intruder and the inner binary s center of mass as the outer binary .",
    "the semi - major axis @xmath41 of the inner binary was always initialized to @xmath42 , and that of the outer binary was set using the stability criterion of mardling and aarseth @xcite , @xmath43^{\\frac{2}{5}}$ ] , which reliably estimates the most distant intruder orbit for which strong 3-body interactions can begin . here",
    "@xmath44 is the pericentre distance of the outer binary , @xmath45 is the semimajor axis of the inner binary , @xmath46 is the mass ratio of the outer binary , and @xmath47 is the outer binary s eccentricity .",
    "the initial eccentricity of the inner ( outer ) binary was chosen uniformly between 0.0 and and 0.2 ( 0.3 ) , where this range of low eccentricities naturally results from dynamical friction .",
    "finally , the three euler angles of the intruder s orbital plane were chosen randomly relative to the reference plane of the binary orbit , as was the phase of the initial periastron of the binary .",
    "both orbits were always started at pericentre ; since many orbital periods elapse before unstable interactions begin , the relative phase is effectively randomized in any case .",
    "the chain code allows the user to add conservative or velocity - dependent external perturbations , and so we added a dynamical friction force given by chandrasekhar s formula @xcite to the motion of each body . the density and coulomb logarithm @xmath48 were chosen to give a dynamical friction timescale @xmath49 yr .",
    "each run was terminated when ( a ) any one of the bodies was expelled to a distance of 1 kpc from the center of mass ; ( b ) any two bodies came within @xmath50 ( where @xmath51 is the schwarzschild radius ) of each other or the gravitational radiation timescale dropped below @xmath52 yr ( roughly the dynamical time ) for any pair , or ( c ) the total time elapsed reached @xmath53 yr .",
    "we selected out just those runs where the intruder never came within 5000 schwarzschild radii ( @xmath300.2 pc ) of either binary member , reflecting the scale below which an @xmath25disk @xcite with sufficient mass to fuel the quasar might be disrupted .",
    "this is also about the size inferred for the broad - line region of the he0450 - 2958 quasar @xcite . of the runs",
    "not terminated by criterion ( b ) or ( c ) , the closest approach of the intruder was @xmath54 in 36% and @xmath55 in 22% of the runs .",
    "to each successful run we then assigned a galaxy based on the empirical black hole / bulge correlations .",
    "each galaxy was modeled as a hernquist profile @xcite with a bulge virial mass @xcite @xmath56 chosen according to a log - normal distribution with a mean given by the relation @xcite @xmath57^{1.04}$ ] and standard deviation of 0.25 dex @xcite .",
    "the velocity dispersion was calculated from the m@xmath27 relation @xcite , @xmath27 @xmath58 ( 262 km s@xmath32 ) @xmath59^{0.249}$ ] , and the bulge scale radius set by @xmath60 .",
    "we then added to the stellar bulge a dark matter halo with a mass ratio that is an order of magnitude larger than the cosmic matter - to - baryon ratio ( corresponding to a star formation efficiency of 10% ) and a concentration parameter of 9.0(@xmath61 / 2.10 @xmath62 10@xmath63 @xmath17)@xmath64 with a scatter of 0.18 dex @xcite .",
    "the black hole was ejected radially from the galactic center with the final velocity from the 3-body run and its trajectory integrated for @xmath65 yr .",
    "we imposed dynamical friction with @xmath66 , which had almost no effect on the trajectories in high velocity ejections , but efficiently damped out those with low velocities .",
    "finally , we chose a random line of sight and projected all distances and velocities accordingly .",
    "we added up the total time spent in each logarithmic distance and velocity bin to assess the relative probability of seeing the quasar at different projected separations and line - of - sight velocities .",
    "figure 2 shows the resulting probability distributions .",
    "the observed parameters of the quasar under consideration , @xmath67 kpc and @xmath68 , appear to be fairly typical in the statistics of our runs .",
    "note that the results scale simply with the black hole mass in our model .",
    "if the inner binary always starts at a fixed fraction of the hardening radius , then @xmath69 gives @xmath70 .",
    "we then have @xmath71 .",
    "the self - similarity of the hernquist model implies that the turnaround distance @xmath72 in units of the galactic scale radius is fixed by @xmath73 in units of @xmath27 .",
    "since @xmath74 is constant , we get @xmath75 . hence neglecting minor deviations from self - similarity due to dynamical friction",
    ", we expect the velocities in our plots to scale roughly as @xmath76 and distances as @xmath77 .",
    "we have proposed that the he0450 - 2958 quasar , around which no galactic host has so far been detected , was ejected from the nearby galaxy in a three - body interaction following a merger of a massive gas - rich galaxy with a giant elliptical . this scenario explains ( a ) the fueling of the bright quasar displaced by @xmath307 kpc from the galactic center ; ( b ) the survival of the binary in the gas - poor galaxy before the merger ; and ( c ) the disturbed appearance of the companion galaxy .",
    "one may also ask how the presence of the `` blob '' and narrow line emission in the quasar spectrum , both indicative of ionized gas in the quasar s vicinity far outside the black hole radius of influence , fit into the ejection picture .",
    "merritt et al .",
    "( 2005 ) infer a size of roughly 1.5 kpc for the narrow - line region ( nlr ) .",
    "since the gas at this distance can not possibly be bound to the black hole , they argue that the very small observed redshifts between quasar , galaxy , and narrow emission line gas rule out the ejection scenario .",
    "however since the ejected quasar would spend most of its time near turnaround , we find a quite small velocity difference between the quasar and ulirg to be consistent with the high - velocity ejection model .",
    "for instance , the black hole modelled in figure 1 , with @xmath78 , spends 17% of its time with @xmath79 100 km / s . after projecting onto the line of sight and averaging over many runs as in figure 2",
    ", one can see that very small velocities are still prevalent in our statistics at distances around 7 kpc .    in galaxy merger simulations including feedback from star formation and agn @xcite ,",
    "large amounts of gas are blown from the galactic center out to distances of @xmath30510 kpc during the coalescence of the two nuclei .",
    "the disturbed system also shines as a ulirg during most of this phase . once the feedback shuts off , the gas that does not escape settles back into the inner galaxy on the dynamical timescale of @xmath3010@xmath80 yrs .",
    "the mass in narrow line emitting gas inferred from absolute line fluxes in typical nlr is around 10@xmath81 @xcite .",
    "ten million years after the core merger , more than this mass in gas below 10@xmath82 k would likely be available within the few kpc sphere surrounding a black hole ejected to a distance of @xmath307 kpc .",
    "it is plausible that clouds formed from this cool gas could produce the observed narrow line emission in the quasar spectrum while the black hole ( and gas ) are near turnaround .",
    "the observed blob would be a portion of the gas photoionized by anisotropic radiation from the quasar .",
    "it is not feasible for bondi accretion from this external gas to fuel the quasar , as the densities required are unrealistically high .",
    "rather the quasar must be fueled by the remnant inner accretion disk dragged with it from the galactic center , which can remain bound to it through the ejection as demonstrated above .",
    "our proposed scenario is viable as long as the merger process does not induce coalescence of the binary through dynamical friction on a rearranged distribution of stars and gas , _ before _ the three black holes interact . for typical parameters , we find that the feeding of the loss cone of stars by tidal interactions during the merger is not sufficient to cause coalescence of the binary before the third black hole sinks in @xcite .",
    "coalescence through friction on gas would be possible by momentum conservation only if a large quantity of gas , comparable to or larger than the binary mass , is channeled through the interior of the binary before the three black holes interact .",
    "however , since the gas initially resides within the quasar s original host galaxy , it is more likely to fuel the quasar before reaching the nucleus of the dry elliptical that hosts the binary .",
    "feedback from the quasar could then easily supply sufficient energy to prevent the gas which gets tidally - stripped from the outer envelope of its host galaxy @xcite from settling into the few parsec scale region surrounding the binary before the three black holes interact .",
    "both our calculations and the identification of he0450 - 2958 as a quasar without a typical host @xcite are based on the correlations between black hole masses and their host bulges established for isolated , quiescent galaxies .",
    "the extension of these correlations to active and merging systems is somewhat less certain .",
    "several authors @xcite have studied the m@xmath83@xmath27 and m@xmath83m@xmath84 relations in active galaxies and reported statistically significant deviations from the slope and zero - point measured for inactive systems , as well as slightly larger scatter .",
    "however the reported deviations are not typically greater than a factor of 2 - 3 and hence qualitatively support our application of the correlations to an interacting system .",
    "since the mass of the he0450 - 2958 black hole and corresponding expected host properties are uncertain , one can not prematurely conclude that it is truly a `` naked '' quasar .",
    "further observations , particularly in bands admitting a higher ratio of galaxy to quasar luminosity , are needed to place tighter constraints on the properties of any host galaxy .",
    "this paper demonstrates the plausibility of a three - body ejection producing a naked quasar near a recently - merged galaxy .",
    "if such a system is unambiguously observed , this would provide a key link in our understanding of galaxy formation and the hierarchical buildup of supermassive black holes .",
    "we are grateful to sverre aarseth for use of his chain code and for enlightening discussions about black hole binaries .",
    "we also thank thomas j. cox , volker springel , and lars hernquist for providing simulation data and for useful discussions about the coevolution of black holes and galaxies .",
