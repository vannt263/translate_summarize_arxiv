    "the situation is complicated , however , by the fact that the bulk of the xrb is due to highly obscured agns .",

    "simple pre-_chandra_/_xmm - newton _  estimates ( fabian & iwasawa 1999 ) , based on a comparison of the intensity of the 210  kev xrb , which is dominated by obscured agns with that of the soft xrb below 1  kev , which is dominated by unobscured quasars , indicated that most accretion may be obscured ( i.e. , occurring behind a line - of - sight column density exceeding @xmath4 ) .",
    "this assumed that the redshift evolution of obscured and unobscured objects is the same .",
    "recent _ chandra _  and _ xmm - newton _   data , however , show that this is not the case .    that obscured agns are common and need to be included in estimates of accretion power is obvious from the fact that the three nearest agns with intrinsic x - ray luminosities above @xmath5 ( ngc 4945 , the circinus galaxy , and centaurus a ) are all highly obscured with @xmath6 ( matt et al .",
    "two ( ngc 4945 and circinus ) are even compton - thick with @xmath7 this situation has only been slowly appreciated , perhaps due to ngc 4945 appearing as a starburst galaxy at all non - x - ray wavelengths and to the circinus galaxy lying close to the galactic plane .",
    "nevertheless , it has long been known that the number density of seyfert 2 galaxies , where the active nucleus is obscured , exceeds that of seyfert 1 galaxies , although selection effects complicate making a comparison at a fixed bolometric agn luminosity .",
    "geometrical unification has often been assumed , with seyfert 2s being seyfert 1s viewed through a surrounding torus for which the opening angle is about 60@xmath8 .",
    "more recent x - ray studies , particularly with _ bepposax _ , have been showing that this picture probably applies to only a subset of agns .    here , the evidence for distant obscured agns is reviewed and their contribution to the xrb examined .",
    "the total energy density due to accretion is then deduced from the spectrum of the xrb , and via sotan s ( 1982 ) method converted into a local black hole mass density due to radiative growth .",
    "comparison with the locally determined black hole mass density from quiescent galaxies shows that there could be a problem in terms of excessive growth , unless ( 1 ) the radiative efficiency of most accretion is higher than that for a standard accretion disk around a schwarzschild ( non - spinning ) black hole ( e.g. , elvis , risaliti , & zamorani 2002 ) , ( 2 ) the bolometric correction is lower , or ( 3 ) the redshift distribution peaks at @xmath9 .",
    "the problem is illustrated well by the recent estimate for the growth of bright optical quasars by yu & tremaine ( 2002 ) , which allows for little obscured accretion , particularly in massive objects .",
    "it is shown here that if their estimate for the local black hole mass density from direct measurements of nearby quiescent galaxies can be revised upward by a factor of 1.52 , to be in agreement with that of ferrarese ( 2002 ) , and factors due to ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) above are also revised in accord with recent xrb studies , then agreement can be found for a radiative efficiency of 0.1 . about equal amounts of the local black hole mass density",
    "are then due to obscured and to unobscured accretion .",
    "the x - ray and uv energy absorbed in the obscuring gas is reradiated in the far - infrared and sub - mm bands .",
    "a few percent of the energy density in these backgrounds is due to accretion , but most is due to star formation .",
    "most seyfert 2 galaxies contain obscured agns , with 210  kev x - ray luminosities typically up to about @xmath10 . in studies of local , optically selected seyfert 2s with _ bepposax _ , maiolino et al .",

    "this half are the classical , optical seyfert 2 galaxies and the other , compton - thin , half corresponds to the optical intermediate classes of seyfert 1.8 and 1.9 ( risaliti , maiolino , & salvati 1999 ) .",

    "2002 ) , more than two - thirds are compton thin with @xmath12 ; most of the remainder are unobscured .",
    "the absorption - corrected , 210  kev luminosity of the obscured objects is typically in the range of @xmath13 .",
    "only a handful of obscured agns have yet been found with 210  kev luminosities exceeding the level of @xmath14 , corresponding to a quasar [ crawford et al .",

    "note that there is not complete agreement between optical and x - ray classification of some of the compton - thin agns .",
    "some show x - ray absorption but little optical extinction ( maiolino et al . 2001 ) , and vice versa , and some x - ray obscured objects show no detectable narrow - line region at optical or infrared wavelengths ( e.g. , comastri et al .",
    "2002 ; gandhi , crawford , & fabian 2002 ) . when there is a large covering fraction of the nucleus by dusty gas , there need be little or no optical / uv narrow - line region .",
    "the terms type 2 and type 1 when applied to x - ray sources are commonly referring to whether there is absorption or not , irrespective of the optical spectrum .",
    "another class of obscured agns are the powerful radio galaxies .",
    "these have large column densities ( probably in a torus perpendicular to the radio axis ) of @xmath16 or more ( e.g. , cygnus a , ueno et al 1994 ; 3c 294 at @xmath17 , fabian et al . 2003 ; b2 0902 at @xmath18 , fabian , crawford , & iwasawa 2002 ; see fig .",
    "these are sufficiently rare that their contribution to the xrb intensity is negligible .",
    "source counts from deep x - ray surveys show that most of the xrb is now resolved ( fig .",

    "the counts flatten below a flux of about @xmath19 in the 210  kev band , above which more than 60% of the xrb intensity originates . at much lower fluxes",

    "the basic method for deducing the local density in black holes due to growth by accretion that emitted measurable radiation is that originally due to sotan ( 1982 ) . from @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the efficiency with which mass is turned into radiation ( @xmath22 for a standard thin disk around a non - spinning black hole ;",

    "a bolometric correction @xmath28 from the observed band to the total luminosity is required .",
    "@xmath25 is either determined from the above equation , giving @xmath29 , or is measured from local galaxies @xmath30 using the black hole mass to galaxy bulge velocity dispersion ( @xmath2 ) relation ( from ferrarese & merritt 2000 or gebhardt et al .",
    "2000 ) , the less well - known velocity dispersion function for galaxies or a proxy for it , and the hubble constant ( in order to determine volumes ) .",
    "the variables are @xmath21 , @xmath26 , @xmath31 , and @xmath28 .",
    "various attempts have recently been made to compare the values of @xmath29 and @xmath30 . in units of @xmath32 for @xmath25 , and adopting @xmath33 , ferrarese ( 2002 ) obtained @xmath34 , whereas yu & tremaine ( 2002 ) find @xmath35 . using bright optical quasars",
    "only and @xmath36 yu & tremaine ( 2002 ) obtain @xmath29 = 2.2 .",
    "they consider that this agrees well enough with their value of @xmath30 that there is no room for significant growth by obscured accretion .",
    "in other words , they find that the mean density in local black holes can be wholly due to radiatively efficient accretion in an optically bright ( and unobscured ) quasar phase .",
    "the result of yu & tremaine ( 2002 ) contrasts with that obtained from the xrb by fabian & iwasawa ( 1999 ) . in order to use the xrb",
    "some correction has to be made for absorption .",
    "this was accomplished by noting that the mean spectra of unobscured quasars is a power law with an energy index of unity in the 120  kev band .",
    "therefore the minimum correction is that required to push the xrb spectrum , which is a power law of index 0.4 in the 210  kev band , up to an index of one , matching at the @xmath37 peak in the xrb ( fig .",
    "this process emphasizes the importance of obscured accretion since the unobscured objects dominate below 1  kev , which is a level 4 times below that of the resultant absorption - corrected minimum spectrum . in the absorption - corrected sense",
    "there is 3 times more energy density in the obscured objects than in the unobscured ones .",
    "this could imply that obscured accretion dominates the growth of massive black holes , contrary to the conclusion of yu & tremaine ( 2002 ) .",
    "the value for @xmath29 obtained in this way from the xrb is 69 ( fabian & iwasawa 1999 ) and 7.516.8 ( elvis et al .",
    "the bolometric correction was that relevant for quasars ( from the work of elvis et al .",
    "1994 ) , @xmath38 @xmath39 , and @xmath40 .",
    "the xrb value for @xmath29 was below the value of @xmath30 in 1999 , when the local quiescent black holes masses ( magorrian et al . 1998 ) were about 35 times higher than are found now .",
    "if current values of @xmath41 are used then it might seem that there is a problem .",
    "elvis et al .",
    "( 2002 ) have argued that it implies @xmath42 and therefore that all massive black holes are spinning rapidly .",
    "this could cause some problems with merger - based galaxy and black hole growth schemes ( hughes & blandford 2003 ) .",
    "high radiative efficiency also means that the mass - doubling time ( assuming that the sources are eddington limited ) exceeds 60  myr , which could cause problems in growing massive objects from much smaller seed black holes .",
    "perhaps , however , the plunge region within the innermost stable orbit is being tapped by the action of magnetic fields in the disk , thus yielding a higher efficiency without spin ( gammie 1999 ; krolik 1999 ; agol & krolik 2000 ) .",
    "another possibility is that many black holes are ejected in mergers , although the required large fraction seems doubtful .",
    "the above discussion using the xrb assumed that the evolution of the obscured agns is the same as that of unobscured quasars , which peaks at @xmath43 .",
    "recent results from source identifications ( alexander et al . 2001 ; barger et al . 2002 ; hasinger 2002 ; mainieri et al . 2002 ; rosati et al .",
    "2002 ) have , however , shown that the obscured objects peak at a lower redshift of about @xmath44 .",
    "the identification of a complete sample has not yet been carried out , but , as noted by the above authors , the results from partial samples already show that there are many more sources found below redshift 1 than would be expected from any model based on quasar evolution .",
    "this is a very important result .",
    "the immediate effect on the problem in the last section is the drop in @xmath26 and also of @xmath28 .",
    "most , but not all , of the x - ray sources now have absorption - corrected , 210  kev luminosities below @xmath10 and are strictly not quasars .",
    "although this luminosity distinction is somewhat arbitrary , the key point is that seyferts have a 210  kev bolometric correction factor @xmath28 of 1020 , rather than 3050 typical of quasars .",
    "it is difficult to determine @xmath28 for seyfert galaxies since the dominant thermal disk emission lies in the rest - frame euv .",
    "moreover , the low redshift of most of the well - studied ones means that the disk emission , unlike that in quasars , is not shifted into easily observable bands .",
    "i have used results from _ astro-1 , euve _ , and _ fuse _  and find that @xmath45 , using data on mrk 335 ( zheng et al .",
    "1995 ) , ngc 3783 , ( krolik & kriss 2001 ) and ngc 5548 ( magdziarz et al .",
    "1998 ) .    together , the joint effects of the lower redshift peak and lower bolometric correction reduce the value of @xmath29 for obscured sources by a factor of up to 3 .",
    "the net result is that optically bright ( unobscured ) type 1 quasars give @xmath46 , and obscured , type 2 agns now give a similar value , totaling about 4 , again in units of @xmath47 .",
    "this then agrees well with the values from local studies of @xmath48    [ note that the change in @xmath28 with luminosity means that a lower limit for the intrinsic 210  kev luminosity of quasars is difficult to determine at the present time .",
    "the origin of the optical definition is somewhat arbitrary .",
    "the properties of objects appear to change around @xmath49 , which is the limit used here . ]",
    "the discovery that obscured agns follow a much steeper evolution than optically bright quasars means that they are a different population .",
    "the lack of any unobscured counterpart implies that the obscuration covers a large part of the sky as seen by the source itself .",
    "there can be no simple torus or geometrical unification picture for these objects .",
    "the large covering fraction of absorbing material may explain why there is little in the way of an optical / uv narrow - line region seen for some of the identified x - ray sources ( particularly if the absorbing gas is dusty ; see , e.g. , gandhi et al .",
    "2002 ) .",
    "interestingly , there is another population of objects that does evolve in a similar way to the obscured x - ray population , namely dust - enshrouded starburst galaxies .",
    "chary & elbaz ( 2001 ) show that distant luminous and ultraluminous infrared galaxies seen with _ iso _",
    "evolve very rapidly to @xmath50 .",
    "there is some overlap between _ iso _  and _ chandra_/_xmm - newton _  x - ray sources in deep images ( wilman , fabian , & gandhi 2000 ; alexander et al . 2002a ; fadda et al . 2002 ) , and it is plausible that a subset ( @xmath51% ) of the dusty starburst galaxies are x - ray detectable type 2 agns .",
    "the inner parts of the starburst itself may , through winds and supernovae , be responsible for inflating the absorbing gas so that it has a large covering fraction as seen from the center ( fabian et al .",
    "1998 ; wada & norman 2002 ) .",
    "it is not yet clear from identification work quite what fraction of the x - ray sources dominating the xrb are dusty starbursts .",
    "very ( and extremely ) red objects are reasonably common counterparts of the _ chandra _  serendipitous x - ray sources ( alexander et al .",
    "2002b ) ; yet , they are a heterogeneous class ( e.g. , smail et al .",
    "2002 ) that includes both dusty starbursts and old early - type galaxies .",
    "a further point is that seyfert galaxies typically operate at about 10% of the eddington limit .",
    "if the xrb objects are similar , then from the inferred luminosities , the black hole masses are in the range of @xmath52 , below that generally implied for quasars ( @xmath53 to @xmath54 ) .",
    "thus , unobscured accretion seen in optically bright quasars may make most of the black holes above @xmath55 and obscured accretion those at lower masses .",
    "what we do not know is whether quasars passed though an obscured phase early on ( see , e.g. , fabian 1999 ) , perhaps when their masses were @xmath3 or less .",
    "as discussed earlier , there are some type 2 quasars being found in deep x - ray surveys , but not in large numbers . also there is little evidence yet for a population of distant compton - thick objects ( @xmath56 )",
    "of course , these are likely to be difficult to identify spectroscopically .",
    "wilman ( 2002 ) has provided arguments against any significant compton - thick population .",

    ". it could be the high luminosity that drives away all nearby gas .",
    "perhaps , as indicated above , the optically bright quasars are of higher mass ( above @xmath3 ) than the typical type 2 agns , or they are closer to the eddington limit .",
    "powerful radio galaxies , which have very luminous and presumably massive nuclei do , however , provide counter examples ; although the radio outbursts may all be young ( @xmath67 ) and due to even higher mass black holes , they could be well sub - eddington .",
    "a significant population of type 2 quasars may yet emerge from the complete identification of large , deep x - ray samples",
    ".    the eddington limit for a central black hole will always be significantly less than the eddington limit for the galaxy bulge . that assumes , however , only radiation pressure through electron scattering . a nuclear wind or radiation pressure acting on dusty cold gas ( which has a much larger absorption cross section than electron scattering ) can make the relevant limiting luminosity for the galaxy bulge more than the eddington limit for the nucleus itself ( fabian 1999 ; fabian , wilman , & crawford 2002 ) . consequently an obscured nucleus can increase in luminosity and then blow away the obscuring gas and its own fuel supply ( see also silk & rees 1998 ) .",

    "the tight @xmath2 relation found locally ( ferrarese & merritt 2000 ; gebhardt et al .",

    "they contribute roughly equal amounts to the local mass density of black holes , with obscured accretion contributing most for black holes with masses below about @xmath55 and unobscured quasars contributing most above that value .",
    "the overall picture is that the most massive black holes ( above the break in the present mass function at about @xmath55 ) are built earlier ( by @xmath74 ) than the lower mass ones below the break ( which are built by @xmath75 ) .",
    "this means that the lower mass ones take about twice as long to assemble . as the universe ages , the black holes that remain active are becoming increasingly obscured .",
    "the fraction of the mass density from obscured accretion is lower than estimated earlier because the sources evolve differently to quasars , peaking at @xmath64 rather than 2 .",
    "also their luminosities are in the range of seyferts which locally have a lower bolometric correction .",
    "this makes the contribution of obscured accretion to the mass density in black holes at about 50% .",
