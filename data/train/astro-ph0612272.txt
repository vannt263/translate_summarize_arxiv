    "narrow - band surveys have revealed an intriguing new population : giant , radio - quiet lyman-@xmath1 emission - line nebulae ( steidel 2000 ) , which have been termed ` lyman-@xmath1 blobs ' ( labs ) .",
    "these objects typically have linear extents of 10100kpc , and lyman-@xmath1 luminosities of 10@xmath5ergs@xmath6 , with the highest concentration currently known in the sa22 proto - cluster at @xmath2 , with 35 confirmed objects ( matsuda et  al .",
    "similar objects have been discovered in other regions associated with rich , but primitive environments ( keel 1999 ; francis 2001 ; palunas 2004 ) , and extended lyman-@xmath1 emission has been detected around certain high - redshift radio galaxies ( e.g.  reuland 2003 ) ; however , the narrow - band selected labs are typically not associated with such radio - loud systems .",
    "cooling - flows or shock heating by outflows originating from starburst winds or agn jets have been proposed as the most plausible mechanisms for producing these extended lyman-@xmath1 haloes ( taniguchi & shioya 2000 ; ohyama 2003 ) , although other processes such as sub - sonic @xmath7 heating , and inverse compton scattering of sunyaev - zelodovich photons could also play a role ( scharf 2003 ) .",
    "the two largest known labs ( lab1 and lab2 , with spatial extents of 1.1@xmath8kpc@xmath9 and 0.8@xmath8kpc@xmath9 respectively , both at @xmath2 in sa22 ; matsuda 2004 ) are both associated with submillimeter galaxies ( smgs ) ( chapman 2001 ) .",
    "several other labs in the sa22 structure at @xmath2 contain smgs ( geach 2005 )  the apparent association of these bolometrically luminous galaxies with labs provides support for the scenario where feedback mechanisms are powering the lyman-@xmath1 emission , since the bolometric luminosities of the smgs are several orders of magnitude larger than the lyman-@xmath1 luminosities of the haloes .",
    "the action of superwind feedback has recently been given credence by integral field data which reveals outflows and complex velocity structures in both lab1 and lab2 ( bower 2004 ; wilman 2005 ) .",
    "however , the precise location and identification of the smg counterparts , and hence accurate constraints on the dominant power sources , are unclear due to the poor spatial resolution of the submillimeter data ( chapman 2004 ) .    in this letter",
    ", we present _ spitzer space telescope ( sst ) _ mid - infrared and _ hubble space telescope ( hst ) _ optical imaging of the galaxies embedded within lab1 and lab2 to locate the bolometrically luminous sources within them  the smgs . to identify these galaxies , we exploit the fact that mid - infrared observations have been shown to be effective at identifying smgs , particularly at 8@xmath0 m since these galaxies have red infrared colors ( ashby 2006 ) .",
    "the mid - infrared photometry also constrains their rest - frame optical ",
    "radio spectral energy distributions ( seds ) and hence can shed light on what is powering these sources .",
    "throughout we adopt @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12kms@xmath6mpc@xmath6 . in this geometry",
    ", 1@xmath13 corresponds to 7.1kpc at @xmath2 .",
    "the _ sst _ observations used here are part of gto project # 64 , which we retrieved from the _ spitzer _ science center ( ssc ) archive . lab1 and lab2 are covered by all four irac channels ( 3.68@xmath0 m ) , and we use the post basic calibrated irac frames generated by the pipelines at the ssc .",
    "both labs were also observed by mips at 24@xmath0 m as part of the same project , and for these data we perform post - processing on basic calibrated data frames to remove common mips artifacts and flatten small and large - scale gradients using ` master - flats ' generated from the data . for mosaicking we use the _ ssc _ mopex package , which makes use of the supplementary calibration files which are supplied with the main science set .",
    "we use sextractor ( v2.4.4 , bertin & arnouts 1996 ) to detect and extract sources in the mid - infrared images .",
    "fluxes are measured in apertures with diameters chosen to be the same as in the swire elais - n1 catalog : 3.8@xmath13 for irac and 12@xmath13 for mips .",
    "in addition to the mid - infrared data , we analyse optical _ hst _ observations of the labs , to reveal the rest - frame ultra - violet ( uv ) morphologies of the galaxies in the lab haloes .",
    "the stis coverage of lab1 has been previously discussed by chapman  et  al .",
    "( 2004 ) , while the advanced camera for surveys ( acs ) f814w ( @xmath14-band ) imaging of lab2 is presented here for the first time .",
    "the acs data was reduced using multidrizzle , and will be described in more detail in j.  e.  geach et al .",
    "( 2006 , in preparation ) .",
    "as the precise location of the smgs within the lab haloes is uncertain , we begin our discussion by identifying the mid - infrared counterparts to the smgs ( which we assume to be the dominant power - source of the labs ) . starting with a catalogue of the irac - detections within each lyman-@xmath1 halo haloes",
    ", we adopt the alphabetical suffix lab1a , lab1b , etc . , although this does not imply that these objects are physically associated with the lab . ]",
    "( table  1 ) , we aim to eliminate sources not at @xmath15 , and then identify the most likely mid - infrared counterpart ( if any ) to the smg in each case .",
    "note that no sources are detected at 24@xmath0 m within the extent of either lab , and so we adopt 3-@xmath16 upper limits of @xmath17@xmath0jy .",
    "figure  1 shows _ hst _ and irac images of the labs covering 3.68@xmath0 m , and we label each of our potential counterparts . of the five irac components in lab1 ( a  e ) , we can eliminate several of them as the smg counterpart immediately : lab1c and d have mid - infrared colors @xmath18 , making them inconsistent with @xmath15 galaxies ( ashby 2006 ) , while lab1e is at the position of the lyman - break galaxy ( lbg ) c11 , and is only weakly detected at 3.6@xmath0 m and undetected at @xmath19@xmath20 m .",
    "although this lbg is close to lab1 , it appears to be kinematically distinct from the bulk of the halo ( bower 2004 ) and so we discount it  leaving lab1a and b as potential counterparts .",
    "the positional uncertainty between lab1a and the 850centroid ( @xmath21 ) is consistent with it being the source of the submm emission .",
    "the remaining irac counterpart to the south - east of the smg ( lab1b ) is just within the lyman-@xmath1 halo , and has a bright counterpart in the stis imaging .",
    "it is not clear from the mid - infrared colors whether this galaxy is at the halo redshift , but given its large separation from the nominal submillimeter position , it is unlikely that it is associated with the power - source .",
    "however , if lab1b is at @xmath15 , it is possible that lab1a and b are interacting given their projected separation of just @xmath44@xmath13 ( @xmath430kpc at @xmath15 ) .",
    "previous multi - wavelength observations of lab1 ( chapman 2004 ) associated the smg with the brightest of a group of uv fragments near the geometrical center of the structure and close to the 21 cm source position ( fig .  1 ) .",
    "component lab1a is in the vicinity of this group of faint uv fragments , but the 3.68@xmath0 m emission is coincident with a @xmath22 extremely red object ( ero ) identified in steidel ( 2000 ) , rather than the brightest uv component ( ` j1 ' in chapman 2004 ) which is closest to the radio peak ( and a tentative co(4@xmath233 ) detection ) .",
    "both lab1a and the uv object j1 are plausible sources of the submm emission .",
    "however , given that smgs are expected to be massive , we view the 3.68@xmath0 m detection as a more reliable indicator of the smg s counterpart than the weak uv source .",
    "we therefore propose that lab1a is the most likely irac counterpart to the smg in lab1    there are three mid - infrared counterparts within the extent of lab2 ( fig .  1 ,",
    "table  1 ) .",
    "we can eliminate lab2c immediately as a potential counterpart given its blue mid - infrared colors and large , bright optical counterpart in the _ hst _ image  it is a foreground object .",
    "the remaining two counterparts lab2a and lab2b have similar 3.65.8characteristics , and similar compact _ hst _ morphologies ( fig .  1 ) .",
    "however , only lab2b is detected at 8@xmath0 m , which has been shown to be a useful identifier of the mid - infrared counterparts of smgs ( ashby 2006 ) .",
    "moreover , lab2 contains a hard x - ray source in the halo ( basu - zych & scharf 2004 ) , with an estimated luminosity @xmath24ergs@xmath6 .",
    "the location of the x - ray source is consistent with lab2b ( @xmath25 ) , whereas lab2a is in the extreme south - east of the lab , @xmath48.5@xmath13 away from the x - ray source . given the association between smgs and moderately bright x - ray sources ( alexander et al .",
    "2005a ) , the smg in lab2 is likely to lie close to the position of the x - ray source .",
    "we therefore propose that lab2b is the mid - infrared counterpart to the smg in lab2 m flux to account for this offset would make the smg brighter , with @xmath26mjy ( chapman 2001 ) . ] .",
    "the precise positions of the smgs in lab1 and lab2 and the offsets to the other mid - infrared components are given in table  1 .",
    "we can use the 3.68photometry ( along with multi - wavelength data for these objects from the literature ; chapman 2001 ,  2004 ; steidel 2000 ) to construct the optical  radio seds for the smgs ( figure 2 ) .",
    "we present new @xmath27 and @xmath28 band photometry from the ukidss - deep extragalactic survey ( to be discussed in stott et al .",
    "2007 in prep ) .",
    "we note that the poor constraints on the @xmath29 ratio means that we can not make robust conclusions about the rest - frame mid - to - far infrared differences between lab1a and lab2b .",
    "both have @xmath29 upper limits consistent with obscured ulirgs at @xmath30 ( pope et al .",
    "similarly the limits of the observed @xmath31 ratios for lab1a and lab2b are consistent with other smgs at @xmath30 , although the ratio for lab1a is at the low end of the distribution ( pope et al .",
    "2006 ) indicating either a relatively low stellar mass for this system , or more likely very high obscuration .",
    "thus , the smgs associated with labs are similar to the wider smg population .",
    "we now examine the rest - frame near - infrared portion of the seds using the irac data .",
    "near - infrared colors have been shown to be a useful diagnostic for the power - source of local luminous infrared galaxies ( e.g.  spinoglio 1995 ) .",
    "for lab1a we find rest - frame ( vega ) colors @xmath32 and @xmath33 , and in lab2b we find @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "lab1a s colors are similar to that of ` normal ' galaxies ( @xmath36 , @xmath37 ; spinoglio 1995 ) , whereas lab2b exhibits a redder rest - frame @xmath38 color , indicating an excess in the rest - frame @xmath28-band likely associated with a non - stellar contribution .",
    "we fit a simple power - law , @xmath39 , to the irac photometry for lab2b , obtaining @xmath40 , similar to that expected for agn ( alonso - herrero et al .",
    "2006 ) .",

    "we adopt a model with an exponentially declining sfr , with @xmath42gyr , from bruzual & charlot ( 1993 ) and constrain the redshift to be @xmath2 .",
    "dust is modelled with a calzetti law ( calzetti 2000 ) .",
    "the rest - frame optical  near - infrared portions of the seds are well fit by this model , with high - reddening ( @xmath43 ) and young ages .",
    "absolute @xmath28-band magnitudes based on the fit are @xmath44 in lab1a and @xmath45 for lab2b .",
    "these absolute rest - frame @xmath28-band magnitudes are comparable to the wider smg population ( borys et al .",
    "2005 ) , and suggest stellar masses of @xmath46@xmath47 , although the @xmath28-band magnitude of lab2b is likely to be contaminated by agn emission , with a significant rest - frame 2excess over the hyperz fit of @xmath45@xmath0jy .",
    "the detection of x - ray emission from lab2b is the best evidence we have that it contains an agn . to quantitatively test the correspondence between the mid - infrared excess and the x - ray emission we use the rest - frame x - ray10.5@xmath0 m correlation for agn from krabbe ( 2002 ) .",
    "we predict the rest - frame 10.5@xmath0 m emission for lab2b by extrapolating the rest - frame 2@xmath0 m using the measured spectral slope of @xmath48 . with this approach",
    "we estimate the x - ray luminosity from the agn to be of order @xmath49ergs@xmath6 , in reasonable agreement with that observed ( basu - zych & scharf 2004 ) .",
    "the luminosity of the x - ray source is consistent with a moderate contribution to the bolometric emission from an agn ( alexander 2005b ) , however it is still not clear if an agn or starburst is responsible for powering the extended lyman-@xmath1 emission .",
    "lab1a s rest - frame @xmath28-band excess over the best fit stellar template , of @xmath43@xmath502@xmath0jy is less significant .",
    "nevertheless , taking the same approach as for lab2b , we predict an x - ray luminosity of @xmath4@xmath51ergs@xmath6 , consistent with the 210kev limit in the existing _ chandra _ observations .    to make progress we need mid - infrared observations of a larger sample of labs in sa22 , four of which also contain smgs ( geach 2005 ) .",
    "this will allow us to investigate whether they also exhibit rest - frame near - infrared characteristics similar to the general submillimeter population .",
    "searches for obscured agn in sa22 will also be significantly advanced by a recently approved 400ks _ chandra _ acis - i exposure of this region .",
    "together these studies will provide a clearer view of the energetics of labs and their relationship to the wider smg population .",
