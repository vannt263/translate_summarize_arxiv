    "we use a simple model of a cubic sqd with @xmath23 ( we will use @xmath11 nm for estimates ) , covered with an oxide layer with thickness @xmath24   nm , and contacted with current terminals from below and from above .",
    "the @xmath25-axis is oriented from top to bottom along the current flow , as shown in fig . 1 .",
    "a tunneling current is injected into the dot via the oxide barrier from the top ( source at @xmath26 ) and leaves the dot at the bottom ( drain at @xmath27 ) . due to the presence of the oxide barriers",
    "this current is non - ballistic and non - thermal .",
    "we assume that the high potential barriers associated with the oxide layers are not much affected by the voltage and the tunneling charges .",
    "we concentrate on what happens between these effective source and drain ( fig .",
    "2 ) .    in the case",
    "when the dot can be regarded as an insulating system it is reasonable to assume that the applied voltage equally drops over the potential barriers and the dots . for simplicity",
    "we neglect the difference of the dielectric constants of the oxide barriers and the dot . in this approximation",
    "we can introduce an effective voltage @xmath28 describing the part of the total transport voltage @xmath29 applied between effective source and drain which drops across the dot itself .    in this rude approximation",
    "we neglect the effect of spatial quantization upon values on the ionization energy , the conductivity gap and material parameters of silicon .",
    "at @xmath30 the fermi level inside the dot is situated in the middle of the gap , i.e. @xmath31 bellow the conduction band edge ( @xmath32 ev at 300 k ) .",
    "as @xmath33 grows , the bottom of the ( still empty ) conduction band bends down accordingly .",
    "when the conduction band in the dot close to the drain aligns with the fermi level of the emitter we expect a drastic increase in the tunneling current . this threshold @xmath34 voltage ( fig .",
    "2 ) for @xmath33 is given by @xmath35 , regardless of the number @xmath36 of dopants in the dot ( as long as the dot is not yet metallic , of course ) .",
    "in the following we therefore limit our studies to voltages    @xmath37    in this voltage range we have a @xmath1-thick barrier ( formed by the dot ) with always finite hight between effective source and drain . the intrinsic concentration of electrons and holes at 300 k is @xmath38 @xmath6 .",
    "even at this high temperature the probability to have at least one intrinsic electron in a dot with size @xmath11 nm is only @xmath39 .",
    "so we would expect virtually no current in this mode .",
    "this is confirmed by direct electrical tests @xcite of sqd with the required properties .",
    "let us now consider one single single donor in the dot located at @xmath25 with ionization energy @xmath40 ev ( for p as a donor ) .",
    "the evident channel for current flow is single - electron tunneling from the source to the empty impurity , and then from populated impurity to the drain .",
    "this channel opens as soon as @xmath33 reaches a threshold @xmath41 leading to a step - like increase in the total conductance of the dot .",
    "if the impurity is located near the drain , i.e.   @xmath42 ( as donor 1 in fig .",
    "2 ) , then @xmath41 is given by @xmath43    in contrast , for an impurity located at distances @xmath44 from the drain ( i.e. further away than the threshold case of donor 2 in fig .",
    "2 ) , no additional current channel via a single impurity can be opened at low enough voltages defined in ( [ threshold ] ) where virtually no background current is present . in the present case",
    "this value @xmath45  nm , which returns us to the above criterion : only impurities located in the immediate vicinity ( defined within the accuracy @xmath9 ) of the drain contribute to the single - impurity channel .",
    "the probability to populate an impurity from the source , and then to depopulate it towards the drain is directly related to the overlap of the atom - like impurity wave - functions with the corresponding contacts leading to a conductance @xmath46 of this current channel @xmath47    this shows that in first approximation the conductance of this channel does not depend on @xmath25 . as shown above , a single - impurity channel already only selects impurities located within a very narrow range of @xmath25 close to the drain , eq .",
    "( [ g1 ] ) gives an additional argument for the independence of this channel conductance @xmath46 on the actual location of the impurity inside this thin layer near the drain .",
    "the above consideration shows , that due to the bend of the bottom of conduction band following the transport voltage , there is no chance to notice current flowing through a sequential chain of impurities ( such as donors 1 and 3 in fig .",
    "2 ) , connecting source and drain .",
    "the contribution of such a chain will be totally masked by the current flowing directly via the conduction band .",
    "the only way for multiple impurities to manifest themselves in quantized conductance is to form multiple _ parallel _ singe - impurity channels situated close enough to the drain as considered above .",
    "therefore , if @xmath48 impurities fall into the thin layer near the drain to approximately the same @xmath25 coordinate as that of donor 1 in fig .",
    "2 ( within the bohr radius ) , we will see a switching - on of an @xmath17-fold channel with conductance @xmath49 at the same threshold voltage @xmath50 v as for a single - donor channels .",
    "all the above considerations are only valid as long as the dot itself can be regarded as an insulating system .",
    "as the number of donors in a sqd grows , the dot becomes a metallic particle , and the conduction band edge in the dot aligns with the fermi level of the electrodes . in a very simple estimate",
    "we define this transition to a metal when the total volume of @xmath17 donors with an individual volume of @xmath51 exceeds the volume of the dot .",
    "this is an exaggerated version of the mott criterion ( [ mott ] ) which holds not only in bulk , but in a small structure , too . for the analyzed example from above this",
    "gives @xmath52 as a limiting value .",
    "the practically interesting set @xmath53 for both @xmath36 and @xmath17 considered above is still far bellow this limit .",
    "quite a number of other mechanisms of electron transport might take place in this system , the main one being resonant tunneling .",
    "surprisingly , even taking into account such other mechanisms @xcite does not change much the main idea of the present paper .",
