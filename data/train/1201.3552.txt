    "adaptation is ubiquitous in the nervous system , from synaptic depression @xcite and single neuron spiking @xcite , to the activity of neural modules ( e.g. @xcite ) . in sensory systems , it has been suggested to be a key design principle of the neural code @xcite , which may allow for optimal information coding by matching the neural responses to stimulus statistics @xcite .",
    "the retina is one of the most studied highly adaptive neural circuits , in which the mapping between stimuli and neural response changes to match the statistics of the mean light intensity @xcite , temporal and spatial contrast and spatial scale @xcite , pattern @xcite , relative motion @xcite and periodicity @xcite .",
    "since adaptation requires some form of memory and inference of the stimulus statistics to which the system should adapt , the mechanism and nature of adaptation have been studied extensively .",
    "for example , the dynamic structure of the retinal ganglion cell receptive fields @xcite , and contrast adaptation in the vertebrate and fly visual systems @xcite have been characterized as gain - control mechanisms that serve to efficiently encode the variation of the stimulus around the mean into a limited dynamic range of firing rates at the output .",
    "it has been further shown that neural systems adapt not only to various stationary stimuli , but also to dynamic changes in stimulus distributions taking place across multiple timescales @xcite .    despite its ubiquitous presence ,",
    "it is still not clear what are the limits to adaptation , and in particular , which stimulus changes should lead to adaptive responses and which should not .",
    "moreover , by its nature , adaptation comes with an inherent caveat or cost @xcite : adaptive code is ambiguous , which requires the decoder to keep some knowledge of the coding context .",
    "since most studies of adaptation analyzed neural systems response to first- and second - order spatio - temporal statistics in the stimulus , we addressed here the nature of neural response to changes in higher - order structure of visual stimuli ; such higher - order structure is characteristic of natural scenes @xcite and is perceptually salient @xcite .    to characterize adaptation and invariance to stimulus statistics beyond luminance and contrast , we studied retinal responses to spatially uniform stimuli where light intensities were drawn independently from distributions with tunable amounts of skewness and kurtosis .",
    "we analyzed salamander retinal ganglion cell responses using maximally informative dimensions , and quantified the encoding properties of the neurons using 2d linear - nonlinear ( ln ) models .",
    "we found clear signatures of contrast adaptation in the rescaling of nonlinearities to these stimuli , but also that the same neurons display striking encoding invariance to changes in stimulus skewness or kurtosis , even when they are exposed to strongly bimodal stimulus distributions .",

    "skewness and kurtosis , we took a sample of 501 calibrated grayscale images from the penn natural image database ( pnidb ) @xcite . from each image we selected 400 random patches @xmath0 pixels in size , which corresponds in area to the angular size of about 3 degrees , roughly the size of the center receptive field of a salamander retinal ganglion cell . averaging over each patch to get the mean luminance in that patch , we computed the contrast , skewness and kurtosis of the distribution of patch luminances in a given image . repeating the process over all images in our selection ( containing shots of baboon habitat in okavango delta in botswana , including landscape images , some with horizon , closeups of the ground , and a small selection of man - made objects in that habitat ) , we accumulated natural distributions of contrast , skewness and kurtosis .    in our analyses ,",

    "the stimulus was projected onto the salamander retina from a crt video monitor ( viewsonic g90fb ) at a frame rate of 60hz such that each stimulus frame was presented twice in a row ( for a stimulus sampling rate of 30hz ) using standard optics .",

    "the filters extended over @xmath26 and were sampled on 36 equidistant points , with temporal resolution of @xmath27 .",

    "this expansion made the filters smooth and very slightly improved generalization performance , but the results were stable even if we inferred directly in the space of @xmath33 .",
    "for performance reasons we estimated @xmath19 during mid optimization runs using kernel - smoothing estimation ; for final results we used the context - weighted - tree ( ctw ) estimator @xcite ; the two estimators agreed without bias and to within @xmath34 for final filters across all cells and stimuli .",

    "we performed two optimization runs for each cell and each stimulus , and the values of information per spike between the two runs differed by 1% on average , @xmath35 of the runs had a difference smaller than @xmath36 .",
    "to quantitatively compare the shapes of the filters across stimuli in experiment 1 , we needed to ensure that each stimulus condition had enough spikes for good filter inference .",
    "we required each cell to have an average firing rate of at least @xmath37 ; 15 out of 23 cells passed this cut . in experiment 1",
    "we displayed gaussian stimuli in addition to hos stimuli , and we computed spike - triggered average / covariance to extract sta and the next most significant filter ( orthogonal to the sta ) from gaussian segments . to judge the significance of the eigenvectors in the stc analysis we used bootstrapping with subsets of recorded spikes following @xcite .",

    "information rates were estimated by computing the information per spike and multiplying by the mean firing rate .    for all neurons recorded in experiment 2 ( with non - repeated and repeated stimuli ) , we computed several information - theoretic quantities : ( i+ii )",

    "the estimator yields negligible values below @xmath70 bits . + * predicted information rate of ln models . *",
    "to computationally simulate the effect that the ( lack of ) adaptation would have on the information rate when the stimulus statistics changes , we used the ln models inferred at high contrast c++ to predict the firing rate @xmath71 for stimuli with contrasts c@xmath72c++ and ask how much information such neurons would carry per spike in the absence of any adaptation .",
    "this information in the predicted rate , @xmath73 , was evaluated using eq  ( [ brenner ] ) and expressed as a fraction of information captured by the two relevant filters ( which does not depend on contrast and only serves as a normalization ) .",
    "we similarly asked how the same quantity would behave when the global models ( single ln models for all cells that are fit across all stimuli , and therefore have no adaptation ) were used to encode information into the rate for each of the skewed stimuli .",
    "to characterize how the retina encodes higher - order statistics ( hos ) of the luminance distribution , we presented it with a set of 9 synthetic spatially homogenous stimuli @xmath12 , where the light intensity of each stimulus frame was drawn independently from distributions @xmath74 that were matched in mean @xmath2 ( see materials and methods ) .",
    "the stimuli differed systematically in contrast , skewness , and kurtosis , as depicted in fig  [ f1 ] .",
    "the particular values were chosen to span the range of skewness and kurtosis which are found in natural scenes , as shown in fig .",
    "[ f2]a - e . to span these ranges , contrast values @xmath75 had to be chosen in the low range , due to the hardware limitations of the stimulus display .            to quantify how retinal neurons change their code when contrast , skewness , or kurtosis of the stimulus change , we constructed accurate encoding models for the recorded neurons , and compared their properties under the different stimuli .",
    "we thus followed @xcite , who have shown that for spatially uniform gaussian stimuli in the salamander retina , linear - nonlinear ( ln ) models with one or two linear filters often suffice to describe the cells encoding scheme with high accuracy .",
    "moreover , @xcite and @xcite also provided an interpretation of the filtering operations as dimensionality reduction on the stimulus space , the success of which can be quantified with information theory .",
    "here we extended their framework to non - gaussian stimuli and analyzed how information is encoded beyond linear filtering stage , in the nonlinear response , and finally in the spiking rate .",
    "we could then characterize adaptation and invariance quantitatively , and compare the behavior of real neurons with computational models that either have or lack adaptation .",
    "we recorded from 23 retinal ganglion cells that were presented with 9 types of non - repeated stimuli ( 2 gaussian + 7 higher - order statistics ) in experiment 1 , and from 40 cells presented with non - repeated and repeated stimuli of 7 types with higher - order statistics ( see materials and methods ) in experiment 2 .",
    "figure  [ f5]a shows the estimated information rate of the neurons as a function of their firing rate .",
    "consistently with previous reports @xcite , the information rate @xmath76 scaled weakly sub - linearly with the mean firing rate @xmath41 ( @xmath77 ) .",
    "there were no other large systematic dependencies in transmitted information across cells and stimulus classes .",
    "next , we inferred the best linear filters for each cell , and each of the stimulus condition @xmath12 , separately .",
    "we used maximally informative dimensions ( mid ) for learning the filters for all stimuli , and for the gaussian stimuli we additionally used spike - triggered average and spike - triggered covariance .",
    "we also inferred a _",
    "global _ model for each cell , where a single filter ( or a single pair of filters ) was fit across all stimulus conditions ( see materials and methods ) .",
    "in cross - validation on test data , the prediction performance of the models of essentially all cells ( @xmath78 of cell / stimulus combinations ) increased when using two filters ( 2d ln models ) , compared to one - dimensional ln models , but in some cases the contribution of the second filter was very small .",
    "the linear filters inferred using mid for one of these cells are shown in fig .",
    "[ f5]b for 9 stimulus conditions ; overlaid is the leading eigenvector of the spike - triggered covariance matrix computed for the c++ stimulus , and the best global filter learned by mid ( all filters are scaled to unit norm ) .",
    "the filters show very strong overlap , indicating that their shape does not adapt to the stimulus distribution .",
    "we emphasize that computing the naive sta estimates gives a systematic change in filter shape with the stimulus skew , as shown in fig .",
    "[ f5]c , but this is simply an artifact of the sta estimation on non - spherically - symmetric stimuli , and is not indicative of any adaptation process .        figures  [ f5]d - e show a typical cell for which a model with two linear filters is needed .",
    "we again observe a high overlap between the filters inferred using mid in 9 stimulus conditions , the filter pair computed using stc in the gaussian condition , and the single global best pair of filters inferred across all conditions using mid .",
    "15 of the 23 cells in experiment 1 have an average firing rate above @xmath37 for every stimulus , permitting reliable filter estimation .",
    "out of those , a single - filter model in the gaussian condition suffices for 8 cells ( i.e. the single - filter model accounts for more than 90% of the information per spike of the two - filter model ) , and for 7 cells two filters are needed . to measure the agreement between inferred filters across conditions for each cell",
    ", we compute the pearson cross - correlation between the stc derived filter(s ) in the gaussian condition , and the filters derived using mid for each stimulus condition @xmath79 .",
    "the average correlation across the group of cells with a single linear filter is @xmath80 , while the average correlation across the group of cells with 2 filters is @xmath81 ( error bar = std across cells ) ; the decrease in the later case is mainly attributable to the difficulty of inferring jointly 2 filters using mid with a limited number of spikes .",
    "we quantified the effects of changing the higher - order statistics on the shape of the linear filters by computing the balance index @xmath82 , defined as the ratio between the total ( signed ) area under the filter and the absolute area : @xmath83 , where @xmath54 indexes the temporal components of the filter .",

    "shown are averages ( @xmath87 std error bars ) for 40 cells in experiment 2 , computed across both linear filters for each cell.,width=336 ]    to ask whether these slight variations in filter shape across stimuli matter for encoding , we compared the performance of global filters ( constant for each cell across all the stimuli ) with filters inferred separately for each stimulus .",
    "we estimated the information captured by the single - filter model , by a two - filter model , and by a two - filter global model ( where a single pair of two filters is inferred for all stimuli for each cell ) .",
    "single - filter models ( fit to each stimulus separately ) captured @xmath88 of the information per spike ( averaged across cells and stimuli ) .",
    "two - filter models ( fit to each stimulus separately ) captured @xmath89 of information per spike , as shown in fig .",
    "[ f5]f ; for some cells , two filters capture essentially all of the information .",
    "our observations were quantitatively consistent with the results reported by @xcite .",
    "most importantly , the global models where filters did not change with the stimulus capture @xmath90 of the information per spike , confirming that the minor variations between filters inferred in different stimulus conditions are insignificant from the encoding perspective .    taken together , our results show that the shape of linear filters in 2d ln models for salamander retinal ganglion cells does not change noticeably when the skewness and kurtosis vary across the range observed in natural scenes .",
    "completing the ln description of the ganglion cells is the mapping from the linear projection(s ) of the stimulus into the cell s firing rate .",
    "we estimated these 2d nonlinear functions from the data by binning @xmath91 , where @xmath92 are the projections of the stimulus onto the two filters , @xmath93 , as explained in materials and methods .",
    "this was done for each neuron and each condition separately , or for all conditions jointly using the _ global _ pair of filters , to yield a single 2d global ln model for every cell .",
    "figure  [ f7]a shows a global nonlinear function for an example neuron . in fig .",
    "[ f7]b we explicitly show , for that same neuron , the prior ensembles for all 7 higher - order statistics stimuli ( gray ) , with overlaid spike - triggered ensembles for skewed ( magenta ) and kurtotic ( yellow ) stimuli , along with the marginal projections of these distributions .",
    "the number of spikes is in general insufficient to reliably sample and then systematically compare the 2d nonlinear functions across cells and stimuli . we therefore decided to base our comparisons directly on the firing rate prediction performance .",
    "the 2d models for cells in experiment 2 are fit on the non - repeated segments , and are subsequently tested by predicting psth in response to repeated stimulus presentations for which we could measure the true psth ; here , too , the prediction was done either with models fit separately at each condition , or with the global model , where 2 linear filters and the nonlinearity were fit simultaneously across all stimuli , as shown in fig .",
    "[ f7]c .",
    "does the nonlinearity change with the stimulus condition ?",
    "we first estimated how much information is lost in compressing the 2d projections @xmath42 into the nonlinear combination , @xmath94 , on average . as shown in fig .",
    "[ f7]d , the nonlinearity captured 80 - 85% of the information per spike ( fit for each condition separately ) , essentially the same amount as the two linear filters ( c.f .",
    "this finding establishes that the nonlinear mapping itself does not discard the information per spike , and that analyzing the changes in point - wise nonlinearities is warranted . in terms of psth prediction ,",
    "the prediction of the 1d ln models , fitted to each conditions separately , had @xmath95 correlation with the real psth ( error bar = std across 40 cells and 7 stimuli ) .",
    "2d ln models were better with @xmath96 , as shown in fig  [ f7]d .",
    "the global models that had constant filters and nonlinearity across 7 higher - order statistics conditions , performed negligibly lower , with @xmath97 correlation , mostly due to the sparse k+ stimulus condition ( where the spike rate is the lowest ) ; there was essentially no drop for other stimulus conditions in performance of global vs. separate models .",
    "our simulations show that the limitations to the performance of ln - based models in predicting the firing rate are due to the inability of these models to capture the refractory and spike - feedback effects ( which would be possible with e.g. generalized linear models @xcite or keat - type models @xcite ) .",
    "we reiterate , however , that the prediction performance was used here solely as a differential measure , to evaluate the significance of the changes in linear filters and nonlinearities with the stimulus condition .",
    "finally , we can ask how successfully the global models recapitulate the overall firing rate changes with the stimulus statistics .",
    "figure  [ f7bis]a shows the relative change in firing rates for cells from experiment 2 for 7 hos stimuli ; the cells have been sorted to reveal the dominant pattern , where cells that prefer left - skewed stimuli respond less strongly to the other stimuli , while cells that respond strongly to right - skewed stimuli also respond to negative kurtosis .",
    "we can use a global 2d ln model fit for every cell to predict the mean firing rate in response to all of the 7 stimuli .",
    "these models ( without any adaptation ) reproduced very well the mean firing rate for each stimulus and cell , as depicted in fig .",
    "[ f7bis]b , and therefore also the pattern of changes in the firing rate ( not shown ) .",
    "we observe that the encoding properties of salamander ganglion cells do not depend on the higher - order statistics of the luminance levels . to establish this , we compared the shape of linear filters across the stimulus conditions directly ( by measuring their overlap ) , by information - theoretic measures ( information per spike captured ) , and through the impact on the prediction performance ; similarly , we assessed the changes in the nonlinearity by measuring their impact on the prediction performance . in all cases  with the possible exception of highly kurtotic ( k+ ) stimulus  we found that global models , i.e. models with invariant pair of filters and invariant nonlinearity , account for the neural behavior equally well as the models fit to different stimuli separately . since neurons are nonlinear dynamical systems coupled to the stimulus , we find this extent of invariance surprising  we expected that higher - order statistics in the stimuli would `` interact '' with the photoreceptor - bipolar - rgc cascade to yield a notable change in the effective encoding properties , especially for heavily skewed or bimodal stimuli .",
    "we next analyzed the recordings from experiment 1 where neurons were exposed to high ( c++ ) and low ( c+ ) contrast stimuli .",
    "since our analysis kept the filters normalized to unit length , contrast adaptation would be reflected in the change of the shape of the nonlinearity .",
    "indeed , this can be seen in fig .",
    "[ f8]a ( inset ) , which shows the ( marginal ) nonlinearity , @xmath98 , of a typical neuron for the high- and low - contrast experiments .",
    "we then took the nonlinearity from the low - contrast experiment and rescaled it as follows .",
    "first , we rescaled the range of inputs to the nonlinearity , @xmath99 , by the ratio of high to low contrast , c++/c+@xmath100 .",
    "second , we also rescaled the output firing rate by the ratios of the steady - state firing rates in both c+ and c++ conditions ( the rates are not equal because the neurons do not adapt perfectly ) .",
    "after these two rescaling operations , the _ measured _",
    "nonlinearity for c++ ( high contrast ) stimulus lined up well with the _ rescaled _ nonlinearity from the c+ ( low contrast ) stimulus , indicating the ability of the neuron to adapt to contrast .",
    "this observation was generally true for most ( 19 out of 23 ) neurons in our dataset , as shown in fig .",
    "the rescaling fails at very high firing rates , because they are not accessed in the low contrast condition , and ( potentially ) because we were only looking at the marginal 1d ( and not the full 2d ) nonlinearity .",
    "when the stimulus contrast changes , retinal ganglion cells adjust their gain , matching the variation of the signal about the mean to the dynamic range of the firing rate at the output , thereby keeping the information rate high . without adaptation , the information rate would drop because the neurons have a limited output range and they are noisy .",
    "`` noise '' in the context of ln encoding models is the stochasticity related to the spike generation : from the stimulus @xmath20 to spike , @xmath101 , it arises when the nonlinear function @xmath102 is interpreted as the mean firing rate of a poisson point process . to explore the effects of the presence or absence of adaptation",
    ", we generated spikes according to this ln prescription in response to various stimuli , and measured the information in such synthetic spike trains using eq .",
    "( [ brenner ] ) . by using the true inferred ( adapting ) models for low and high contrast",
    ", we found that in both conditions the real spiking neuron can retain @xmath103 of the information extracted from the stimuli by the linear filters . on the other hand ,",
    "when using the model inferred at high contrast , holding it fixed ( no adaptation ) , and probing it with stimuli of progressively lower contrast , the information rate dropped significantly , as shown in fig .",
    "the situation is very different for skewness ( or kurtosis ) : fig .",
    "[ f8]c shows that no such drop in information is observed when the global model is used to generate spikes in case of skewed stimuli , making adaptation unnecessary and invariant encoding possible .",
    "this effect is easy to understand if we compare the extent to which the 9 stimulus distributions differ a priori , after filtering by the neuron s linear filters , and after passing through the nonlinear function .",
    "figure  [ f9]a shows a @xmath104 matrix of the kullback - leibler distances @xmath105 between all pairs of stimuli @xmath106c+,c++,s--,s-,s+,s++,k--,k-,k+@xmath15 ( 2 gaussian , 7 higher - order statistics ) .",
    "the bimodal stimulus k-- is clearly distinct from the others .",

    "because linear filters , as we have shown , do not change in shape , this is simply a consequence of the central limit theorem : the filters sum up ( with weights ) samples drawn independently from the stimulus distributions @xmath107 , so the filter outputs must converge to gaussian distributions with variances that are related to the variance ( or contrast ) of the input .",
    "in other words , the invariant linear filters remove the signatures of higher order statistics and `` equalize '' different stimuli with the exception of their contrast . in the last , nonlinear stage ( fig .",
    "[ f9]c ) , the nonlinearity adapts to contrast as well , ultimately yielding ln model outputs whose distributions are very similar across the range of stimuli differing in contrast , skewness and kurtosis .",
    "we previously established that the retinal ganglion cells do not adapt their linear filtering properties to changes in stimulus skewness and kurtosis . taking this invariance of linear filters",
    "as given , we next showed that linear filtering and contrast adaptation together can successfully remove the signatures of higher - order statistics from the distribution of neural firing rates . here",
    "we return to the observation of invariant linear filters to ask whether such invariance should be expected on theoretical grounds .    in a one - dimensional ln model neuron",
    ", the probability of spiking was assumed to be a saturating nonlinear function of the filtered stimulus : @xmath108 where the linear filter @xmath33 and the spiking threshold @xmath109 may depend on the stimulus type @xmath12 .",
    "we simulated spike sequences @xmath110 of this model neuron in response to repeated presentations of the stimulus , whose value in each time bin was drawn independently from from @xmath74 : @xmath111 was ` 0 ' when the neuron was silent in time bin @xmath112 and during repeated presentation @xmath113 of the stimulus , and ` 1 ' if it spiked . to quantify",
    "how well such a neuron encodes information about the stimulus into spike trains , we estimated the information rate @xmath76 ( in bits per second ) between the stimuli and the response , using the direct method @xcite .    for stimulus types @xmath12 of varying skewness , we found the optimal filter @xmath33 and the threshold @xmath109 that would maximize the information rate @xmath76 that the neuron would convey .",
    "if real neurons were adapting in such a way , this procedure would then predict how their filters would change with the stimulus distribution . for computational reasons ,",
    "our model was simplified : * ( i ) * the linear filter was biphasic , with a `` fast '' lobe of amplitude @xmath114 , and a `` slow '' lobe of amplitude @xmath115 , whose widths and the positions were fixed , so the filter was fully specified by the two amplitude parameters @xmath116 as schematized in fig .",
    "[ f3]a ; * ( ii ) * we maximized the information rate @xmath76 for a fixed average firing rate @xmath41 ; * ( iii ) * the effective noise of the neuron , or fraction of output entropy that is lost to noise , @xmath117 , was fixed .",
    "figure  [ f3 ] shows the dependence of the information rate on the shape of the stimulus filter : left - skew distributions ( s-- ) slightly favor off cells ( negative fast lobe , positive slow lobe , fig .",
    "[ f3]b ) , while right - skew distributions ( s++ ) slightly favor on cells ( not shown ) .",
    "this conclusion was robust to noise in the neuron @xmath118 ranging from @xmath119 to 0.5 . for a specific choice of @xmath120 in fig .",
    "[ f3]c , fig .",
    "[ f3]d shows the dependence of information rate on the ratio of the fast to slow lobe amplitude , @xmath121 . for each stimulus ( s++ and s-- )",
    ", there are two local maxima , one for an on - like and one for an off - like cell , which differ in the transmitted information by less than 10% .",
    "importantly , however , the maxima are not achieved at the same value of @xmath122 in both stimulus conditions  this means that while an adapting on or off cell can maintain the same rate of information transmission when the stimulus changes , it will need to modify the filter shape by adjusting the ratio @xmath123 .",
    "focusing on the case of an off cell , we found that an optimally adapting cell would increase the area under the fast ( negative ) lobe and would decrease the area under the slow ( positive ) lobe with increasing skewness .",
    "we used the balance ratio @xmath82 , introduced previously , to quantify this change .",
    "figure  [ f3]e shows significant changes in the filter shape with skew that range from @xmath124 for s-- to @xmath125 for s++ ( as expected , the optimal filter for the gaussian stimulus is balanced ( @xmath85 ) , with equal and opposite areas under the two lobes ) .",
    "however , these substantial changes in the filter shape only lead to moderate changes in the amount of encoded information : in the case shown in fig .  [ f3 ] , the information gain of the adaptive neuron relative to the case of no adaptation is always less than 10% . while the exact number varies with the chosen constraints ( @xmath41 , @xmath118 , the locations and widths of the filter lobes ) , two qualitative observations remain true : * ( i ) * the neurons should adjust the biphasic linear filter away from the balanced configuration ( optimal for gaussian stimuli ) by systematically adjusting the weight under the fast and slow lobes so that , e.g. in case of the off cell , negative skew favors larger weight in the slow lobe ; but also that * ( ii ) * these adaptive changes would only lead to small relative information gains .",
    "we explored the limits of retinal adaptation , by analyzing the responses of salamander retinal ganglion cells to temporally uncorrelated and spatially uniform stimuli with gaussian , skewed and kurtotic luminance distributions . while the retina is highly adaptive to changes in first and second order statistics , we found invariance of neural encoding to changes in stimulus skewness and kurtosis in both the linear filtering stage and the nonlinear stage .",
    "@xcite reported a similar result in the cat lgn for spatially structured stimuli , using 1d ln models inferred using reverse correlation ; we see an analogous invariance to skew and kurtosis for spatially uniform stimuli in the retina , for 2d models inferred using a theoretically unbiased method , while exploring a substantially wider range of skewness and kurtosis values .",
    "taken together , these results suggest that adaptation in the early visual system is not sensitive to changes in commonly measured higher - order statistics .    from an information optimization point of view",
    "it is not immediately clear why the retina does not adapt to such higher - order changes .",
    "moreover , since neurons are nonlinear dynamical systems coupled to their inputs , a large change in the statistical structure of the input would , on general grounds , be expected to influence the neuron s effective encoding properties , even if it did not lead to an increase in information transmission .",
    "thus , invariant encoding in the face of substantial changes in the stimulus statistics is not an obvious a priori expectation .",
    "adaptive code is necessarily ambiguous . the same response from an adapting neuron",
    "can , for example , signal two different light intensities , depending on the stimulus history .",
    "downstream neurons must therefore rely either on keeping track of the adaptive state of the encoding neuron , or on using diversity in the neural population in a proper way to estimate the stimulus .",
    "moreover , nontrivial processing is required also on the encoding side : the adaptive neuron needs to infer from the stimulus itself whether some underlying property of the stimulus ( such as the mean luminance or contrast ) has changed and thus an adaptive response needs to be triggered ( but c.f .",
    "also @xcite ) . in short ,",
    "adaptive codes incur computational costs that invariant codes do not .",
    "these considerations suggest that there exist changes in stimulus statistics for which the benefits of adaptation outweigh the costs .",
    "it also implies the existence of changes where the encoding properties _ should _ remain invariant , even if other equally good encoding strategies were available to the cell , thereby making the code easy and unambiguous to decode .",
    "such changes would be those where , even without adaptation , the information rate would not drop precipitously when the stimulus distribution changes .",
    "our results lead us to believe that an encoding model with non - adapting linear filter(s ) and a nonlinearity , which adapts to contrast but not to higher - order statistics , is an efficient strategy that reduces the inherent ambiguity in the code .",
    "contrast adaptation is necessary to prevent a severe drop in the information rate after a contrast change .",
    "if in addition the linear filters are invariant , the filtering , together with the central limit theorem , can remove higher - order statistics .",
    "this would leave the luminance and the contrast as the only target statistics for adaptation , while simultaneously maintaining a high information rate and minimizing the code ambiguity .",
    "we did not observe any adaptive changes in the filter shape either for skewed and kurtotic stimuli , or after the change in contrast .",
    "small changes in filter shape have been previously reported by @xcite in response to large changes in contrast , beyond the values we used here ( `` faster '' filters at high contrast values ) .",
    "it is not clear how one could assess the cost of adding an adaptive mechanism that modifies the retinal ganglion cell filters for higher - order statistics ; we can ask , however , how much information would be gained by it .",
    "our toy model simulations show that while it would be theoretically possible to increase the transmitted information by adjusting the shape of the linear filter to the stimulus , the gains in information would be very modest ( around 10% for a robust range of realistic parameter choices , much less than the gain due to contrast adaptation ) , despite significant changes in the shape of the optimal linear filter .",
    "one explanation for the lack of dynamic adaptation to higher - order statistics is therefore that it does not yield much gain in information , while potentially increasing the coding cost and complexity .",
    "it is possible , then , that instead of implementing an adaptation mechanism able to dynamically change the filter shape on an individual cell basis in response to stimulus skew , the neural population is structurally adapted to the overall luminance distribution of natural scenes , by properly partitioning the population between on- and off - like cells @xcite .",
    "another explanation for invariant coding in response to higher - order statistics could be that the ability to adapt is limited by the ability to detect a change in the underlying statistical structure of the stimulus .",
    "for example , to detect reliably a change in kurtosis , the neuron would need to receive some minimal number of independent stimulus samples , but this minimum might still be large , making such inferences hard .",
    "more fundamentally , it is not clear what are the actual statistics that the neurons are adapting to @xcite .",
    "while we commonly think in terms of contrast , skew , and kurtosis as the relevant statistical properties of stimuli , it is not obvious that the brain relies on these same measures in dealing with natural scenes . in particular , they may be poor choices in natural settings , as their values are sensitive to outliers and because they might vary in a dependent way in nature ( c.f .",
    "@xcite ) . perhaps then",
    ", the retina ( and other neural systems ) may be using other estimators for contrast- , skew- , and kurtosis - like statistics ?",
    "some of these important issues could be addressed by extending our analysis either by using temporally correlated stimuli , or by heavy - tailed ( or naturalistic ) luminance histograms  if they can be reproduced in the lab using display hardware with a larger dynamic range @xcite .",
    "both of these extensions would affect the central limit theorem argument above : in the case of temporally correlated stimulus , the samples would no longer be independently drawn and thus might not ( quickly ) converge to a gaussian ; in the second case , the linear filter will not be able to `` erase '' the signatures of higher - order statistics , should the decay of the luminance distribution be too shallow . as both extensions would bring the stimuli closer to the true naturalistic ones , they could provide us with a more complete window into the nature of retinal adaptation to natural scenes .",
