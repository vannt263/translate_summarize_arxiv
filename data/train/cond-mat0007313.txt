    "the so - called parisi scheme @xcite for replica symmetry breaking ( rsb ) has been one of the most succesful tools in the description of ( the statics of ) disordered systems in the non - ergodic or glassy phase .",
    "originally proposed as the solution for the sherrington - kirkpatrick ( sk)-model @xcite for mean field spin glasses , it has been succesfully applied to a wide range of disordered systems .",
    "the physical interpretation of the parisi scheme has been a subject of many discussions , and has led to the introduction of concepts such as _ disparate time - scales _",
    "@xcite , _ effective temperatures _",
    "@xcite , _ low entropy production _",
    "@xcite and non - equilibrium _ thermodynamics _ @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we will show how a general scheme in which systems are given the freedom to sacrifice energy equi - partitioning by separating autonomously into sub - systems with different characteristic time - scales and temperatures , not only yields the parisi scheme , but also introduces all the above - mentioned concepts in a very natural way .",
    "our assumptions are simple , and all the quantities that appear in the theory , have a clear physical meaning . in section [ dt ]",
    "we briefly discuss systems with disparate time - scales , and in section [ sk ] we apply this to the benchmark problem of mean field disordered systems , viz .",
    "the sk - model @xcite . in section [ nu ]",
    "we present numerical evidence for the existence of multiple disparate time - scales .",
    "finally , in the discussion [ di ] we summarize the simple physical picture that naturally emerges from our scheme , and discuss the points that still need further investigation .",
    "in this section we briefly describe how the formalism , as developed and applied for ising spin systems with slowly evolving bonds @xcite , can be generalised to arbitrary stochastic systems with two or more disparate time - scales . in the case of systems with two infinitely disparate time - scales , the faster variables @xmath0 equilibrate before the slower ones @xmath1 can effectively change .",
    "therefore , the @xmath1 evolve to an a boltzmann - type equilibrium distribution with an effective energy which is the free energy of the @xmath0 given the @xmath1 , at an effective inverse temperature @xmath2 , while the @xmath0 evolve to the normal boltzmann equilibrium distribution with @xmath3 :    @xmath4 & \\cz",

    "this procedure can be generalised to a system with @xmath6 different levels of stochastic variables , time - scales and temperatures @xmath7 . assuming that each level is adiabatically slower than the next level ( @xmath8 ) , we obtain the following recursion relations    @xmath9 & \\cz _",

    "we will now apply this scheme to the sk - model @xcite , for which the parisi scheme was originally developed .",
    "therefore , we briefly recall the definitions :    @xmath12    with gaussian couplings @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and ising spins @xmath15 .",
    "we assume that there are @xmath6 levels of spins with corresponding disparate time - scales and temperatures @xmath16 in the system , where @xmath17 , such that larger @xmath18 correspond to faster spins .",
    "although we expect the selection of time - scales for the spins to depend on the specific realisation of the couplings , at present we will make the simplest approximation : the system can only choose the relative sizes @xmath19 of the levels .",
    "a more detailed study of the ( annealed ) selection of levels will be presented elsewere . to deal with the quenched disorder average over the @xmath13 we use the replica trick    @xmath20    together with the recursion relations ( [ dt : zl ] ) this leads to a nested set of @xmath21 replicas , in which spins at level @xmath18 carry a set of replica indices @xmath22 .",
    "the index @xmath23 comes from the disorder average , whereas @xmath24 . the asymptotic free energy per spin is then given by    @xmath25    with the definitions @xmath26 we have @xmath27 , and the connection with the original parisi scheme becomes clear .",
    "note that @xmath28 , as slower clusters can not have a lower temperature than faster ones , because otherwise the latter would act as a heat bath .",
    "we now assume full ergodicity at each level in the hierarchy of time - scales :    @xmath29    ( i.e. @xmath18 is the slowest level at which @xmath30 and @xmath31 differ ) , to obtain      where    @xmath33}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the physical meaning of the @xmath34 is given by    @xmath35    where @xmath36 denotes the average over the level @xmath37 process , and @xmath38 denotes the disorder average .",
    "the minimum of the free energy with respect to the @xmath19 ( with @xmath39 , for @xmath40 positive integers ) , is at @xmath41 , and we exactly recover the @xmath42-th order parisi solution .",
    "furthermore , the extremization with respect to the @xmath43 is now recognized to express the fact that , for self - consistency , the entropy of the spins slower than level @xmath18 is zero ( they are effectively fixed on the time - scale @xmath44 ) .",
    "in numerical simulations of the sk - model we have measured the distribution of the number of flips @xmath45 at time @xmath46 per spin : @xmath47 .",
    "assuming a characteristic time - scale @xmath48 for each spin @xmath15 and a distribution @xmath49 of these time - scales , we obtain a theoretical prediction of the distribution of the number of flips per spin at time @xmath46 :    @xmath50    minimization of @xmath51 with respect to @xmath49 then yields the most probable distribution of time - scales @xmath52 , see fig . 1 .    ( 0,90 ) ( 70,20)=140 ( 141.3,20)(3,1 ) ( 55,80)(3,1 )    we have found that both the number of peaks ( in agreement with full rsb ) , and the separation between peaks ( in agreement with infinitely disparate time - scales ) seem to grow with increasing system size and/or time .",
    "the total fraction of the slow spins , however , seems to remain finite , which implies that a more precise analytical treatment for the choice of clusters or simulations with larger system sizes and/or times are needed .",
    "we have shown that the parisi solution can be derived from simple physical principles , and can be interpreted as describing a system with an infinite hierarchy of time - scales where a vanishingly small fraction of slow spins act as effective disorder for the faster ones .",
    "the block - sizes @xmath53 at level @xmath18 of the parisi matrix are found to be the ratio of the effective temperature @xmath54 of that level and the ambient temperature @xmath55 .",
    "extremization with respect to @xmath53 expresses the fact that for self - consistency the entropy of the spins slower than level @xmath18 is zero ( they are frozen on the time - scale @xmath56 ) .",
    "it follows from physical considerations ( i.e. the absence of heat flow in equilibrium ) that @xmath57 .",
    "the fact that the fraction of slow spins vanishes , indicates that the cumulative entropy of the slow spins is less than extensive , and hence that the so - called _ complexity _ is zero ( at least in this full - rsb model ) .",
    "although a more careful treatment of the selection of clusters is obviously required , the main consequences of our interpretation do not crucially depend on it .",
    "firstly , ultra - metricity ( see fig .",
    "2a ) is a direct consequence of the existence of a hierachy of time - scales . at each level @xmath18 ,",
    "the different descendants of a node represent different configurations of the @xmath61 , which , however , all share the same realisation of disorder and slower spins . furthermore , a large fraction of the spins ( see fig .",
    "2b ) evolves at the fastest ( microscopic ) time - scale at the ambient temperature @xmath55 , while a small fraction of the spins evolves at ( infinitely ) slower time - scales at higher effective temperatures .",
    "therefore , cooling to a temperature @xmath62 and heating back to @xmath55 will leave the spins with @xmath63 unchanged , explaining memory effects . on the other hand , after heating to @xmath64 and cooling back to @xmath55 , the original configuration of the spins with @xmath65 will be erased , which may explain thermo - cycling experiments @xcite .",
    "note that since the spins are discrete variables , finding a small number of flips for a given spin implies long periods of stationarity ( persistency ) with only short periods of activity ( avalanches ) .",
    "we expect the qualitative features of our picture to survive in short range systems , where the time - scales need not be infinitely disparate due to activated processes .",
    "it is as yet unclear whether each level would represent a single cluster or a family of clusters .",
    "the origin of the slow time - scales of these clusters can only be understood if they are coupled much stronger internally , than ( effectively ) to the rest of the system ( i.e. a softened version of the completely disconnected clusters which give rise to so - called griffiths singularities in diluted systems @xcite ) . in short range systems",
    ", the clusters would have to be spatially localised , which is in line with the _ droplet _ picture for short range spin glasses as proposed by fisher and huse @xcite .",
    "the fact that the time - scale of a clusters increases with @xmath66 , explains why the effective age of a system at a certain @xmath55 is found to be either older or younger when it spends some time at a @xmath67 , @xmath68 respectively .",
    "a more careful treatment of the selection of clusters is clearly needed ( and currently been carried out ) , both for full- and 1-rsb models .",
    "this may allow us to calculate the complexity in such systems .",
    "furthermore , it needs to be investigated whether slow clusters survive above the thermodynamical ( spin ) glass temperature @xmath69 .",
    "our results suggest further numerical experiments for mean field and short range models , concentrating on quantities such as spin flip frequencies , avalanches , spatial correlations , and cluster persistency .    to conclude ,",
    "we have shown how a scheme based on an autonomous selection of infinitely disparate time - scales can be used succesfully to describe the statics of disordered systems with quenched disorder and discrete and/or continuous stochastic variables .",
    "it allows us to _ derive _ the parisi scheme from simple physical principles , and interpret its ingredients in such a way that it becomes compatible with the droplet picture for short range models .",
    "it is our pleasure to thank f.  ritort and d.  sherrington for critical comments and stimulating discussions ."
