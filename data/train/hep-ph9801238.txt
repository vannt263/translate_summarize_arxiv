    "for more than a decade , ideas involving supersymmetry ( susy ) have been among the most popular extensions of the standard model ( sm ) , having the greatest potential to solve its shortcomings such as the gauge hierarchy problem and the lack of a quantized version of gravity .",
    "indeed , all superstring theories necessarily contain quantum gravity and supersymmetry .",
    "moreover , very recently , using arguments based on various dualities and supersymmetry , all superstring theories as well as 11 dimensional supergravity seem to be connected nonperturbatively  @xcite , suggesting a unified theory in which supersymmetry is one of the indispensable key elements .",
    "the idea of supersymmetric unification is further supported by the observation of gauge coupling unification  @xcite two orders of magnitude below the reduced planck scale , @xmath3 gev , the natural supergravity scale .    taken together this implies a strong motivation to investigate the phenomenological consequences of low energy supersymmetry . in this paper",
    "we present a systematic study of precision observables in the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) in an attempt to find favorable and/or excluded regions in susy parameter space .",
    "we do this in two scenarios for how supersymmetry breaking is conveyed to the observable sector .    in the `` minimal supergravity '' model",
    "@xcite supersymmetry breaking is transmitted from a hidden sector to the observable sector via gravitational interactions .",
    "supersymmetry is spontaneously broken in the hidden sector at a scale @xmath4  @xcite .",
    "in popular models which invoke gaugino condensation  @xcite , @xmath5 gev . since gravity is flavor blind , it is assumed that the explicit soft breaking terms in the observable sector are universal at the supergravity scale .    in simple models of gauge mediation  @xcite",
    "there is a supersymmetry breaking sector which gives rise to both an @xmath6-term , @xmath7 , and a vacuum expectation value , @xmath8 , of a standard model singlet field .",
    "this field is coupled to the vector - like  messenger fields \" , @xmath9 , through a superpotential interaction of the form @xmath10 .",
    "the generated soft mass term for a given superpartner is proportional to @xmath11  gev , and grows with the square of its gauge couplings .",
    "therefore sleptons are much lighter than squarks and the gluino is heavier than charginos and neutralinos .    in both cases the generated soft terms are sufficiently flavor universal that all flavor changing neutral current ( fcnc ) effects are adequately suppressed .",
    "however , in the minimal supergravity model it must be implicitly assumed that universality is not spoiled by the khler potential .",
    "recently , a number of articles  @xcite examined whether supersymmetry has the potential to describe the data better than the sm .",
    "the conclusions in the affirmative were mainly driven by @xmath12 ( see section  [ overview ] ) , which at times was more than @xmath13 higher than sm expectations .",
    "loops involving light charginos and top squarks could account for a large part of the discrepancy for low @xmath14 , provided the effect was not canceled by charged - higgs loops . for large @xmath14 , large shifts could be obtained from loops containing bottom quarks and light neutral higgs bosons , and to a lesser extent from neutralino / bottom - squark loops . however ,",
    "more recent analyses find the measured value of @xmath12 closer to the sm prediction ( the discrepancy is @xmath15 ) , and at the same time direct limits on superpartner masses have increased . now , even if one is able to find a region of parameter space where the @xmath12 discrepancy is alleviated , the decrease in the overall @xmath0 is not significant .",
    "also , in those regions of parameter space one typically finds that the discrepancy in @xmath16 is made worse . in the specific high - scale models of supersymmetry",
    "breaking we consider in this paper , the largest possible shift in @xmath12 is less than @xmath17 .",
    "it follows that @xmath12 now plays a much smaller role , and supersymmetric models can no longer yield significantly smaller values of @xmath0 than the sm .",
    "therefore , in this work we take a different point of view and focus on elucidating the excluded regions of supersymmetry parameter space .",
    "we present a complete one - loop analysis of supersymmetry , combined with a state of the art sm calculation .",
    "input data are as of august 1997 .    in section  [ overview ]",
    "we give a short overview of the inputs and observables we use .",
    "for reference we perform a global fit to the sm , and comment on some of the deviating observables .",
    "section  [ susy ] describes the parameter spaces of the supersymmetric models in more detail , and reviews recent direct limits on superpartner masses .",
    "we compare the oblique approximation  @xcite with the full calculation in some detail .",
    "we present our results in section  [ results ] and our conclusions in section  [ con ] .",
    "within the sm we perform a global fit to a total of 31 observables listed below .",
    "we include full one - loop radiative corrections  @xcite ; full qcd corrections up to @xmath18 ; higher order qcd corrections when enhanced by beta function effects ; mixed electroweak / qcd corrections of @xmath19 with the exception of non - leading special vertex corrections to @xmath20 decays ; and @xmath21 corrections when enhanced , e.g. by large top mass effects or large logarithms .",
    "the fermi constant , @xmath22 , and the fine structure constant , @xmath23 , are taken as fixed inputs .",
    "the five fit parameters are the strong coupling constant , @xmath24 ; the contribution of the five light quarks to the photon vacuum polarization function , @xmath25 ; and the masses of the @xmath26-boson , @xmath27 , the higgs scalar , @xmath28 , and the top quark , @xmath29 .",
    "alternatively , one may fix @xmath27 as well , since its relative error is now comparable to that of @xmath22 .",
    "we have chosen to leave it free , because the @xmath26-mass measurement is correlated with other observables . in practice",
    ", the difference between the two treatments is numerically insignificant .",
    "we have organized the measurements into seven groups :    * * 9 lineshape observables * + the mutually correlated lep observables  @xcite are determined from a common fit to the @xmath26 lineshape and the leptonic forward - backward asymmetries .",
    "they include the @xmath26-boson pole mass @xmath27 , the total @xmath26-width @xmath30 , the hadronic peak cross section , @xmath31 and , for each lepton flavor , @xmath32 , @xmath1 , @xmath33 , the ratios @xmath34 , and the pole asymmetries , @xmath35 .",
    "@xmath36 denotes the partial @xmath26 width into @xmath37 . defining @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the effective weak mixing angle for fermion @xmath40 at the @xmath26 scale",
    ", we have @xmath41 * * 3 further lep asymmetries * + these are the @xmath33 polarization , @xmath42 , its forward - backward asymmetry , @xmath43 , and the hadronic charge asymmetry , @xmath44 , which is quoted as a measurement of @xmath45  @xcite . *",
    "* 6 heavy flavor observables * + the mutually correlated heavy flavor observables from lep and slc  @xcite are the ratios @xmath46 ; the forward - backward pole asymmetries , @xmath47 ( lep ) ; and the combined left - right forward - backward asymmetries , @xmath48 ( slc ) , each for @xmath49 . *",
    "* 3 further sld asymmetries * + these are the very precise measurement of the left - right asymmetry for hadronic final states  @xcite , @xmath50 ; the analogous @xmath51 , which is obtained from a common fit including polarized bhabha scattering  @xcite ; the left - right forward - backward asymmetries  @xcite , @xmath52 for @xmath53 or @xmath33 ; and the hadronic charge flow asymmetry  @xcite , @xmath54 , which is basically the ratio of weighted forward - backward and left - right forward - backward asymmetries is proportional to the electron beam polarization , @xmath55 , while @xmath56 is inversely proportional , the geometric mean of the two determinations yields @xmath57 independently of @xmath55 .",
    "the result  @xcite is @xmath58 , or equivalently , @xmath59 . ] .",
    "we combine the 3 values of @xmath57 from sld into one number , @xmath60 * * 2 pole masses * + we combine the @xmath61-mass measurements from cdf  @xcite , d  @xcite and ua2  @xcite , @xmath62 gev , with the one from lep 2  @xcite , @xmath63 gev , obtaining @xmath64 combining the results of all top decay channels at cdf  @xcite and d@xcite , we find @xmath65 we fix the scale invariant masses for the heavy quarks , @xmath66 and @xmath67 . *",
    "* 6 low energy observables",
    "* + the weak charge from atomic parity violation ( apv ) in tl has been measured by groups in oxford  @xcite and seattle  @xcite , @xmath68 , and in cs by the boulder group  @xcite , @xmath69 , where the first errors are experimental and the second theoretical .",
    "the recent result of the deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) experiment of ccfr  @xcite is combined with the measurements of cdhs  @xcite and charm  @xcite , yielding @xmath70 , where @xmath71 is a linear combination of effective 4-fermi operator coefficients .",
    "similarly , @xmath72 scattering experiments , dominated by the recent charm ii results  @xcite , yield determinations of leptonic 4-fermi operator coefficients , @xmath73 and @xmath74 .",
    "the cleo measurement of @xmath75  @xcite yields the 90% confidence interval , @xmath76 when a variable is defined in a finite interval ( here between 0 and 1 ) , and a boundary of the interval is within a few standard deviations from the central value , a variable transformation should be performed such that the new variable is defined on the whole real axis .",
    "arguments analogous to the ones supporting a flat prior distribution in @xmath77 rather than in @xmath28 ( see next section ) lead to the logistic transformation$ ] . ] , @xmath78  @xcite .",
    "this results in a more gaussian shaped distribution , and in our case , in a more ( less ) conservative assessment of the upper ( lower ) error bar .",
    "the @xmath79 amplitude can receive very large contributions from the leading - order supersymmetric loops , and the next - to - leading order corrections ( which have not been calculated ) could be important .",
    "the uncertainty in the large and positive mssm contributions is taken into account by the more conservative treatment of the upper error bar . additionally ,",
    "because of these uncertainties , we have chosen the more conservative of the two error estimates in ref .",
    "@xcite , which is obtained by adding the statistical and systematic errors linearly . compared to this experimental error , the theoretical error due to qcd uncertainties in the sm prediction  @xcite can be neglected . * * 2 gauge couplings * + we use the constraint @xmath80  @xcite .",
    "we also include the external constraint @xmath81 , which we obtained by combining non-@xmath26 lineshape determinations of @xmath24  @xcite . in this case",
    "we have doubled all theoretical errors to account for ignored correlations , and because these are by far the most difficult to estimate and very non - gaussian in nature .",
    "the best fit values of the sm input parameters are shown in table  [ fit ] .",
    "the @xmath82 of the fit is 26.6/26 , corresponding to an almost perfect fit with a goodness ( probability of larger @xmath0 ) of 43% .",
    ".results for the sm fit parameters . [ cols=\"<,^ \" , ]",
    "precision data continues to play an important role in discriminating and constraining various extensions of the standard model .",
    "for example , it is well known that the precision data analysis leads to serious constraints on technicolor models .",
    "supersymmetric models can always avoid such constraints because the supersymmetric corrections decouple , so the supersymmetric models look just like the standard model if the supersymmetric mass scale is large enough ( @xmath83 to 1  tev ) .",
    "as long as the standard model with a light higgs boson provides a good fit to the data ( the current fit is excellent ) , supersymmetric models can as well",
    ".    on the other hand , what if one were to consider a supersymmetric spectrum which includes light ( @xmath84 ) superpartners ?",
    "then it is interesting to investigate whether the global fits to the data become better or worse as a result of non - negligible supersymmetric corrections .",
    "this has been the purpose of this paper . to this end , we combined a state of the art standard model calculation with the one - loop supersymmetric corrections , and performed global fits to the precision observables in three supersymmetric models .",
    "we have shown that our global analysis leads ( in many cases ) to significantly improved bounds on the parameters and masses of the various models .",
    "for example , we have shown that for a positive @xmath1-parameter the cp ",
    "odd higgs boson mass lower bound increases from @xmath85 gev to over 320 ( 230 ) gev in the supergravity ( gauge - mediated ) model .",
    "for @xmath86 the @xmath87 bound is not as strong , but we are able to set a bound , @xmath88 for all models under consideration .",
    "this has an important consequence : as shown in figure  21 of the very recent ref .",
    "@xcite , there is unexcluded parameter space with @xmath89 gev when @xmath90 gev . with",
    "our bound  ( [ mabound ] ) this part of parameter space is excluded and we conclude , @xmath91 i.e.  the mssm higgs bound coincides with the sm one .",
    "the @xmath92 bound  ( [ mhbound ] ) supersedes the bound of 71 gev mentioned in section  [ results ] , which has a similar origin , but was based on the data presented at the summer conferences  @xcite ; for similar bounds with fixed values of @xmath14 see ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "we set many other interesting bounds , and our main results can be found in table  [ bounds ] and figures  [ neg1][pos3 ] .",
    "we advocate table  [ bounds ] as a reference for the current collider and precision bounds in an important class of supersymmetry breaking scenarios .    in summary , significant portions of the parameter spaces of popular supersymmetry breaking scenarios",
    "have been shown to be excluded , in particular , for @xmath93 .",
    "this has immediate consequences for the near future of collider experiments .",
    "lep 2 will ultimately be able to discover a chargino with a mass up to about 100 gev .",
    "hence , lep 2 is very unlikely to discover the chargino in the gauge mediation models with @xmath94 . the main injector at fermilab , a possible further luminosity upgrade ( tev 33 ) , and the lhc , however , will be able to cover a large part of parameter space which is not excluded by either present direct limits or precision experiments .",
