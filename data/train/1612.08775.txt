    "doubly diffusive systems in which two components with different diffusivities contribute to buoyancy in opposite ways arise frequently in geophysics and astrophysics @xcite : for example , heat and salt contribute to the stratification in the oceanic setting , heat and chemical composition in the stellar astrophysics , and sugar and salt in laboratory experiments . in the following , motivated by oceanic dynamics",
    ", we refer to the slowly diffusing component as salinity and to the rapidly diffusing component as temperature . under appropriate conditions ,",
    "the different diffusivities of these two components may destabilize an otherwise stably stratified configuration and hence lead to mixing .",
    "two scenarios are possible . in",
    "the first , temperature stratification is stabilizing but the salinity stratification is destabilizing , a configuration that leads to a fingering instability . in the second scenario , where the salinity stratification is stabilizing while the temperature is destabilizing , a diffusive oscillatory instability called overstability may take place . in both these cases instability",
    "is present because heat diffuses more rapidly than a typical solute , i.e. the ratio @xmath0 of the solute diffusivity to thermal diffusivity ( or inverse lewis number ) satisfies @xmath1 . in this paper",
    "we concentrate on the nonlinear properties of the turbulent state arising in the former case , and suppose that the destabilizing effect is provided by an unstable salt stratification as frequently occurs in the oceans , focusing on the case @xmath2 .",
    "linear stability properties of the salt - finger regime were first determined by @xcite .",
    "as the magnitude of the unstable mode grows secondary instabilities are triggered @xcite , and finally lead to a statistically steady state @xcite .",
    "however , the physical processes behind the presence of such an equilibrium state are still incompletely understood .",
    "stern @xcite has suggested that a collective instability can lead to the disruption of the salt - finger field and lead to saturation , and identified a dimensionless quantity , now called the stern number , that can be used as a criterion for saturation .",
    "others have supposed that saturation will arise once the growth rate of a secondary instability , such as that identified in @xcite , becomes comparable to that of the salt - finger instability itself @xcite .",
    "more recently @xcite has suggested that finger collision plays an essential role because of the generation of large vertical gradients and hence strong dissipation . in an interesting paper @xcite",
    "proposed a saturation mechanism based on finger clustering that leads to the generation of large - scale structures and hence to saturation at the large scale .    except for weakly nonlinear approaches , eg .",
    "@xcite , most researchers employ numerical studies of the primitive equations consisting of the navier - stokes equation coupled to scalar equations for heat and salinity transport .",
    "such studies , particularly in three dimensions , have proved invaluable and identified a number of novel processes , eg .",
    "@xcite . to shed light on some of these",
    "we propose here a systematic procedure that leads to a simplified set of equations that are easier to study , both theoretically and numerically . in the following",
    "we refer to these , following @xcite , as _",
    "reduced equations_. the procedure described below has been used before @xcite and focuses on the double limit of a large density ratio , where the stratification is dominated by thermal contributions , and an asymptotically small diffusivity ratio , where salinity diffuses much more slowly than heat .",
    "the latter is motivated by the small value of the diffusivity ratio in the ocean while large density ratios are observed in fingering layers in experiments @xcite and in some oceanic measurements @xcite , and is a limit beyond the current capability of direct numerical simulations .",
    "two reduced models are derived depending on the order of schmidt number @xmath3 , which captures the relative strength of momentum and salinity diffusion . when these two effects are comparable , @xmath4 , a reduced model that bears similarity to the rayleigh - bnard configuration is derived .",
    "this model is applicable to astrophysical objects , eg .",
    "@xcite . in the oceanic parameter regime with fast momentum diffusion , @xmath5",
    ", we derive a reduced model with a prognostic - diagnostic form , which we refer to as the inertia - free salt convection model .",
    "this model is the main topic of this paper .",
    "it turns out that this model already appears in the work of radko and stern @xcite .",
    "however , beyond one three - dimensional simulation in a very small aspect ratio domain , these authors did not investigate the properties of this model .",
    "we believe in fact that the model merits far greater attention and that it correctly captures the saturation of the salt - finger instability and the resulting transport properties in a physically relevant regime . in this paper",
    "we therefore study the properties of this model at some length albeit in two dimensions .",
    "to do so we employ a doubly periodic setting as appropriate for oceanic and astrophysical applications with distant boundaries , in contrast to earlier studies of salt - finger convection in vertically bounded domains , eg .",
    "@xcite . in this formulation elevator modes consisting of vertically invariant spatial dynamics",
    "are exact nonlinear solutions and we believe that analogous modes are crucial even in vertically bounded domains because of their efficiency in extracting energy from the salinity field .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows . in  [ sec_formulation ]",
    "we formulate the salt - finger convection problem followed in  [ sec_smalldiff ] by a derivation of two distinct reduced models valid for finite and infinite schmidt numbers , respectively .",
