    "in order to achieve a macroscopic behaviour for investigated quantities in computer experiment based on the observation of finite systems , it is necessary to reduce the influence of surface effects to a minimum .",
    "this is especially important for polar systems with the long - range nature of interactions . excluding the surface effects in simulations",
    "can be performed within either the reaction field ( rf ) [ 15 ] or ewald summation [ 610 ] techniques .",
    "now an equivalence between these techniques has been established for models of point dipoles and proper calculations can be made within either method [ 11 , 12 ] .",
    "the explicit consideration of a finite - size medium lead to computer adapted fluctuation formulas [ 1117 ] which allow one to calculate boundary free values for the dielectric constant on the basis of dipole moment fluctuations obtained in simulations .",
    "these formulas differ considerably with respect to those known from the theory of macroscopic systems even if the ewald method is used [ 11 ] .",
    "details of the summation must be taken into account explicitly in order to obtain correct values for the bulk dielectric constant .",
    "previously [ 1820 ] , the standard rf of point dipoles ( pdrf ) [ 3 ] has been applied to investigate more realistic , interaction site models ( isms ) [ 21 ] of polar fluids .",
    "the pdrf , however , being exact for point dipole models , may not be necessarily applicably to interpret simulation results for arbitrary systems [ 5 ] .",
    "recently , it has been shown by actual calculations for a mcy water model that uncertainties for the dielectric quantities are significant if the pdrf is used in computer simulations of isms and an alternative scheme , the interaction site reaction field ( isrf ) geometry , has been proposed [ 22 ] . at the same time , there is not such an approach concerning the entire wavevector and frequency dependence for the dielectric permittivity of isms within the ewald geometry .",
    "the main attention of previous simulations [ 2331 ] was directed to study the dielectric properties in the static limit or at zero and small wavevector values . moreover ,",
    "the macroscopic fluctuation formulas have been used in the simulation results without taking into account details of the ewald summation .    in the present paper",
    "we apply the ewald technique for treating coulomb interactions in isms .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . a fluctuation formula suitable for the calculation of the wavevector- and frequency - dependent dielectric constant",
    "is derived in sec .",
    "2 and optimal values of the ewald parameters are determined there .",
    "the results of molecular dynamics simulations of the tip4p water for time correlation functions related to dielectric polarization are presented in sec .",
    "these results are compared with those computed within the isrf geometry .",
    "concluding remarks are given in sec .",
    "consider a polar fluid with @xmath0 molecules composed of @xmath1 interaction sites which are confined in a volume @xmath2 .",
    "the microscopic electric field created by the molecules at point @xmath3 and time @xmath4 can be presented as @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the microscopic charge density , @xmath7 and @xmath8 denote the position and charge , respectively , of site @xmath9 within the molecule @xmath10 and @xmath11 is the operator of the coulomb interactions .",
    "obviously , the field @xmath12 for infinite systems @xmath13 can not be reproduced exactly in computer experiment which deals with a finite , as a rule , cubic volume @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the length of the simulation box edge .",
    "however , using the lattice summation , a macroscopic behaviour can be achieved considering the interactions between sites within the basic cell as well as an infinite lattice of its periodic images ( the periodic boundary convention ) .",
    "this can be interpreted as an effective interaction which involves only the sites in the basic cell and characterized by a modified operator @xmath16 , where the summation is extended over all vectors @xmath17 with integer components .",
    "it is more convenient to represent the lattice sum in a form , proposed by ewald and kornfeld ( ek ) [ 6 ] , namely , @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is a sum in real coordinate space , while @xmath20 corresponds to summation over wavevectors @xmath21 of the reciprocal lattice space and @xmath22 is the spatial fourier transform of @xmath23 .",
    "for the idealized summations @xmath24 ) , the total sum of ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) is independent on the parameter @xmath25 .",
    "the main advantage of the ek representation lies in the fact that values for @xmath25 can be found in such a way that the both sums , @xmath26 and @xmath27 , converge very quickly and may be truncated after a finite number of terms .",
    "if the parameter @xmath25 is chosen sufficiently large , we can restrict ourselves to a single term @xmath28 in the real space sum , corresponding to the basic cell to which toroidal boundary conditions are applied , and , additionally , to the spherical truncation @xmath29 , where @xmath30 .",
    "in such a case , taking the fourier transforms of ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) , after some algebra one obtains @xmath31 and @xmath32 , where @xmath33 @xmath34 if @xmath35 and @xmath36 otherwise and @xmath37 denotes the spherical bessel function of first order .",
    "then the fourier transform of the electric field is @xmath38 where @xmath39 , @xmath40 is the longitudinal component of the microscopic operator @xmath41 of polarization density ( @xmath42 ) and @xmath43 .",
    "let us apply an external electric field @xmath44 to the system under consideration .",
    "the longitudinal , wavevector- and frequency - dependent dielectric constant is defined via the material relation @xmath45 , where @xmath46 and @xmath47 are macroscopic values for longitudinal components of the polarization and total field , @xmath48 denotes statistical averaging at the presence of the external field and the time fourier transform @xmath49 has been used for the functions @xmath50 , @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "perturbation theory of the first order with respect to @xmath53 yields @xmath54 , where @xmath55 denotes equilibrium averaging at the absence of the external field , and @xmath56 and @xmath57 are the boltzmann s constant and the temperature of the system , respectively .",
    "then , eliminating @xmath44 from the presented above expressions , we obtain the desired fluctuation formula @xmath58 here @xmath59 is the longitudinal component of the wavevector - dependent dynamical kirkwood factor for the finite system , @xmath60 denotes the permanent magnitude of the molecule s dipole moment @xmath61 , @xmath62 and @xmath63 is the laplace transform .",
    "the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( 5 ) corresponds to the well - known fluctuation formula for infinite systems , where @xmath64 is the infinite - system kirkwood factor .",
    "the computer adapted formula ( 5 ) reduces to the formula for infinite systems if the function @xmath65 .",
    "it can be shown easily that for nonzero wavevectors the function @xmath66 if @xmath67 , additionally provided @xmath68 at @xmath69 .",
    "for @xmath70 the pattern is different because of finiteness of @xmath15 and @xmath71 as in the isrf geometry [ 22 ] .",
    "however , in the case of an actual summation , when @xmath72 takes finite values , the factor @xmath73 can noticeably differ from unity .",
    "therefore , the finite sample behaves like a macroscopic system if the function @xmath73 is very close to unity and this condition can be verified now quantitatively .",
    "moreover , this explicit result may serve as an initial point for a more fruitful discussion about the ewald method itself .",
    "let @xmath74 be a maximal deviation of @xmath73 from unity in the whole interval of acceptable nonzero wavevector values for a chosen pair of parameters @xmath25 and @xmath72 .",
    "then an optimal value for @xmath25 can be determined as that providing a global minimum for the function @xmath75 at a given @xmath72 .    according to eq .",
    "( 5 ) , the obtained in simulations kirkwood factor @xmath76 differs from its genuine value @xmath77 with the relative precision of @xmath78 .",
    "the function @xmath79 is shown in fig .  1 as depending on @xmath25 at fixed values of @xmath80 .",
    "it has been calculated for the case of @xmath81 and @xmath82 that corresponds to the thermodynamics point @xmath83 g/@xmath84 , @xmath85 k of the tip4p model , where @xmath86 is the mass of water molecule . as we can see from the figure",
    ", the precision of calculations of dielectric quantities in computer experiment depends on ewald parameters in a characteristic way .",
    "we indicate the existence of the sharp minimum of @xmath87 at an arbitrary value of @xmath88 .",
    "the curves of fig .",
    "1 can be useful to estimate the possibility of a given simulation result to reproduce directly the macroscopic dielectric behaviour of an is system in an arbitrary thermodynamics state , because then the function @xmath89 is simply rescaled , using the actual value of @xmath90 . from the last equality it follows that the precision of calculations is better for systems with lower particle densities @xmath91 , molecular polarities @xmath92 and higher temperatures @xmath57 .",
    "it is obvious also that minimums of the functions @xmath93 and @xmath87 with respect to ewald parameters coincide between themselves .",
    "the optimal pairs of values for @xmath25 and @xmath88 at @xmath81 as well as the corresponding values of the functions @xmath93 and @xmath87 are selected in table  1 . choosing a criterion @xmath94",
    ", we may ask that the formula for infinite systems might be applied ( at @xmath95 ) and the influence of summation details can be neglected in this case for which @xmath96 and @xmath97 are indistinguishable .",
    "it can be seen easily from the table that values of @xmath98 satisfy this criterion if the parameter @xmath25 is chosen optimally .",
    "the parameters @xmath99 , @xmath100 and @xmath81 are usually exploited in simulations [ 10 ] .",
    "for these values the relative precision is @xmath101 .",
    "however , choosing the optimal value @xmath102 at @xmath99 instead of @xmath100 , we can reduce the uncertainty up to @xmath103 .    in the presented above consideration",
    ", the cut - off radius @xmath104 has been putted to be half the basic cell length . nevertheless ,",
    "increasing @xmath88 , the same precision of summation can be achieved also at smaller values of @xmath104 .",
    "let @xmath25 and @xmath88 correspond to the optimal parameters at @xmath81 .",
    "and now we choose a smaller value of the cut - off radius in the form @xmath105 , where @xmath106 .",
    "taking into account the fact that maximum deviations of @xmath73 from unity are always observed at @xmath107 , it is easy to show that the same value of @xmath108 can be obtained also at @xmath109 and @xmath110 .",
    "for example , putting @xmath99 and @xmath111 at @xmath81 , we then obtain for @xmath112 @xmath113 the following results : @xmath114 and @xmath115 .",
    "choosing smaller values of @xmath104 can be more convenient if the summation in @xmath116-space takes less computation time in an actual programme than the summation in real space .",
    "indeed , let @xmath117 and @xmath118 are the computation times in real and @xmath116-space ( @xmath119 ) , respectively , at given values of @xmath104 and @xmath88 .",
    "it is obvious that @xmath120 and @xmath121 .",
    "then using new values @xmath122 and @xmath105 and minimizing the total computation time @xmath123 with respect to @xmath124 , one obtains @xmath125{t_1/t_2}$ ] .",
    "therefore , in such a way we can provide even a time optimization of the programme without any loss of the precision .",
    "the study of dielectric properties by computer experiment is still a major challenge , given that the calculations are very sensitive to long - range interactions and because the polarization of polar fluids is a collective effect , so that long trajectories are required in order to obtain adequate statistical accuracy .",
    "for this reason , until now , the dynamical polarization of isms has been investigated at zero or small wavevector values only [ 18 , 19 , 23 , 24 , 27 , 29 , 31 ] . as far as we know , there are no computer experiment data on the entire wavevector dependence of dynamical dielectric quantities for such systems .",
    "our molecular dynamics simulations were carried out for the tip4p model [ 32 ] in the microcanonical ensemble at a density of @xmath126 g/@xmath84 and at a temperature of @xmath85 k. we have performed two runs corresponding the ewald and isrf [ 22 ] geometries , respectively . in the both runs @xmath127 molecules were considered in the cubic sample @xmath14 to which toroidal boundary conditions were applied ( @xmath69 ) and the interaction cut - off radius was half the basic cell length , @xmath128 .",
    "the simulations were started from a well equilibrated configuration for positions of sites , obtained by monte carlo simulations .",
    "initial velocities of molecules were generated at random with the maxwell distribution .",
    "the equations of motion were integrated with a time step of @xmath129 fs on the basis of a matrix method [ 33 ] using the verlet algorithm in velocity form .",
    "the system was allowed to achieve equilibrium for 50 000 time steps .",
    "the equilibrium state was observed during 500 000 @xmath130 ns and each 10th time step was chosen to compute equilibrium averages .",
    "translational and angular velocities of molecules were slightly rescaled after every 500 time steps in order to conserve the total energy of the system , so that the relative total energy fluctuations did not exceed 0.01% over the whole runs .",
    "the dynamical kirkwood factor was evaluated in the time interval of @xmath131 ps and in a very large wavenumber region , namely , at @xmath132 k_{\\rm min}$ ] , where @xmath133 .",
    "considering the system during such a rather long period of time allows us to achieve statistical accuracy for the investigated quantities of order 1% .",

    "the auxiliary function @xmath163 is introduced in order to reduce the total number of numerical operations in @xmath116-space from of order @xmath164 to @xmath165 that is very important for simulating large systems .",
    "this number can be reduced approximately twice yet , using invariance of the subsume expressions with respect to the inverse transformation @xmath166 . finally , taking into account that the real part of @xmath167 is an even function of @xmath17 and",

    "there are two versions of the rf geometry . in the pdrf approach ,",
    "molecules are considered as point dipole particles and the intermolecular potential is of the form [ 18 , 19 ] : @xmath170 where @xmath171 is the centre of mass of the @xmath10-th molecule and the molecular cut - off is performed . in the exact isrf method",
    "[ 22 ] the spatial distribution of charges within the molecule is taken into account explicitly at constructing the reaction field . as a result ,",
    "the potential ( 11 ) transforms into @xmath172 where the first term in the right - hand side of ( 12 ) describes the usual coulomb field , whereas the rest of terms corresponds to the reaction field in the is description .",
    "it can be shown easily that the potential ( 12 ) is reduced to ( 11 ) in one case only , namely , when @xmath173 , where @xmath174 denotes the diameter of the molecule . in this case , the positions for sites and centres of mass are undistinguished within the same molecule . for finite samples of",
    "is molecules we have @xmath175 and , therefore , the pdrf potential ( 11 ) may affect on a true macroscopic behaviour of the system considerably .",
    "moreover , the isrf method has yet a minor advantage over the pdrf scheme that the potential of interaction ( 12 ) is continuous and continuously differentiable .",
    "it is worth to mention also that in the rf geometry the dielectric permittivity is computed using the fluctuation formula ( 5 ) with the formal substitution @xmath176 [ 22 ] .",
    "the wavevector - dependent static kirkwood factor , @xmath177 , and samples of the normalized dynamical kirkwood factor , @xmath178 , calculated in the simulations within the ewald and isrf geometries , are shown in figs .",
    "2 , 3 by the circles and dashed curve , respectively . since in the isrf geometry",
    "the function @xmath179 differs from unity considerably , to evaluate the infinite system kirkwood factor @xmath97 the performance of the self - consistent transformation ( 5 ) is necessary .",
    "this result is plotted by the solid curve . at the same time , within the ewald geometry the function @xmath73 is very close to unity at the given optimal parameters of summation ( see table  1 ) , so that the infinite system kirkwood factor is equivalent to that , obtained directly in the simulations , i.e , @xmath180 ( excepting the case @xmath70 ) . as we can see from the figures , the agreement between the two sets of data for the infinite - system functions , corresponding to the ewald and isrf geometries , is quite good . the slight difference ( within a few per cent ) at large times can be explained by an approximate character of the integration appearing for the isrf geometry at performing the inverse laplace transform of ( 5 ) .    for the purpose of comparison , the infinite - system kirkwood factor @xmath181 corresponding to the pdrf geometry is also included in the fig .  2 ( the dotted curve ) .",
    "deviations of values for @xmath181 obtained using the pdrf potential from those evaluated in the ewald and isrf geometries are of order @xmath182 .",
    "they are well exhibited at intermediate values of wavevectors .",
    "such a situation can be explained by the fact that the pdrf geometry does not take into account the spatial distribution of charges within the molecule and , thus , the precision of calculations for wavevector - dependent dielectric quantities at @xmath183 can not exceed @xmath184 , where @xmath185 for the tip4p water molecule . and only for great wavevector values @xmath186 , where the influence of boundary conditions is negligible ( @xmath187 ) , all the three geometries become completely equivalent .",
    "explicitly considering details of the ewald summation to treat coulomb interactions , the fluctuation formula for the computation of the dielectric permittivity in is models of polar fluids has been rigorously derived . using this formula , it has been corroborated by actual molecular dynamics calculations that the ewald and isrf methods can be applied with equal successes to investigate the dielectric constant of isms in computer experiment .",
    "the ewald geometry , however , at a specific choice for parameters of the summation , may reproduce the macroscopic behaviour for dielectric quantities directly in simulations without any additional transformations .    since the calculation of the wavevector- and frequency - dependent dielectric permittivity in simulations for isms is practical now in principle , we believe that this fact will stimulate further research of such systems in theory , computer and pure experiment .",
