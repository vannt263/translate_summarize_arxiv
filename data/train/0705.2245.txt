    "recent proposals of large extra dimensions use the concept of brane as a sub - manifold embedded in a higher dimensional spacetime , on which the standard model particles are confined ( see , for instance @xcite ) .",

    "model @xcite the corresponding background solution consists of two parallel flat 3-branes , one with positive tension and another with negative tension embedded in a five dimensional ads bulk .",
    "the fifth coordinate is compactified on @xmath2 , and the branes are on the two fixed points .",
    "it is assumed that all matter fields are confined on the branes and only the gravity propagates freely in the five dimensional bulk . in rs 1-brane",
    "model @xcite there is only one positive tension brane in a five dimensional ads bulk .",
    "this model is obtained from 2-brane one by sending the negative tension brane to infinity . due to the warp factor in the ads",
    "metric the infinite extra dimension gives a finite contribution to the volume .",
    "more recently , alternatives to confining particles on the brane have been investigated and scenarios with additional bulk fields have been considered .",
    "motivated by the problems of the radion stabilization and the generation of cosmological constant , the role of quantum effects in braneworlds has attracted great deal of attention @xcite-@xcite . a class of higher dimensional models with compact internal spaces is considered in flac03b .",
    "many of treatments of quantum fields in braneworlds deal mainly with the case of the idealized brane with zero thickness .",
    "this simplification suffers from the disatvantage that the curvature tensor is singular at the brane location .",
    "in addition , the vacuum expectation values of the local physical observables diverge on the brane . from a more realistic point of view",
    "we expect that the branes have a finite thickness and the thickness can act as natural regulator for surface divergences .",
    "the finite core effects also lead to the modification of the friedmann equation describing the cosmological evolution inside the brane .",

    "we investigate the effects of core on properties of the quantum vacuum for the general plane symmetric static model of the brane with finite thickness .",
    "the most important quantities characterizing these properties are the vacuum expectation values of the field square and the energy - momentum tensor . though the corresponding operators are local , due to the global nature of the vacuum , the vacuum expectation values describe the global properties of the bulk and carry an important information about the internal structure of the brane .",
    "in addition to describing the physical structure of the quantum field at a given point , the energy - momentum tensor acts as the source of gravity in the einstein equations .",
    "it therefore plays an important role in modelling a self - consistent dynamics involving the gravitational field . as the first step for the investigation of vacuum densities we evaluate the positive frequency wightman function for a massive scalar field with general curvature coupling parameter .",
    "this function gives comprehensive insight into vacuum fluctuations and determines the response of a particle detector of the unruh - dewitt type moving in the brane bulk .",
    "the problem under consideration is also of separate interest as an example with gravitational and boundary - induced polarizations of the vacuum , where all calculations can be performed in a closed form .",
    "the corresponding results specify the conditions under which we can ignore the details of the interior structure and approximate the effect of the brane by the idealized model .",
    "in addition , as it will be shown below , the phenomenological parameters in the zero - thickness brane models such as brane mass terms for scalar fields are calculable in terms of the inner structure of the brane within the framework of the model considered in the present paper .",
