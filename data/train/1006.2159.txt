    "recently inflation has become an essential part of our description of the universe .",
    "not only does it solve the classical cosmological problems of flatness , horizon and relics , but also provides precise predictions for the primordial density inhomogeneities , predictions that are in good agreement with existing observations@xcite .",
    "albeit these successes , the specific details of inflation are still unknown , since many different physical mechanisms and fields may generate a phase of accelerated cosmic expansion . for simplicity ,",
    "it has become common practice to employ a scalar field , the inflaton , with a simple law for its potential , to generate inflation .",
    "this picture is usually understood as the effective counterpart of a deeper  and probably more complicated  theory . in this context ,",
    "the most generally employed inflationary theory is the so - called chaotic inflation , characterized by a simple quadratic potential with an initial high field value for the inflaton .",
    "recently , due to advances in data quality and in anticipation of the data from the planck satellite @xcite and the large synoptic survey telescope ( lsst ) @xcite ) , for example , several groups started investigating more complicated forms for the inflaton potential to explain the present observational data .",
    "@xcite used the cmb data to look for the presence of a general sinusoidal oscillation imprinted on the inflaton potential , for large field values ( i.e. , large spatial dimensions ) , placing strong limits on the amplitude of these osillations .",
    "_ @xcite found  with a 99,995% confidence level  an oscillatory modulation for large spatial dimensions at @xmath3 , performing a monte - carlo markov - chain analysis using the cmb data , confirming similar results obained from the analysis of the cmb data using different techniques @xcite .    from a theoretical perspective , features in the inflaton potential are well motivated .",
    "@xcite showed that a class of models derived from supergravity theories gives rise to inflaton potentials with a large number of steps , each of these corresponding to a symmetry - breaking phase transition in a field coupled with the inflaton .",
    "also , many transplanckian effects may generate oscillations in the primordial power spectrum of density inhomogeneities which could be described by an effective oscillating inflaton potential @xcite .",
    "a present major problem in astrophysics is the large discrepancy between the predicted and the observed number of dark matter halos of mass @xmath4 .",
    "n - body simulations designed to probe the formation and evolution of dark matter structures on small scales found @xmath5 dark matter halos with masses from @xmath6 to @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "however , very much fewer small galaxies of comparable masses are observed in the local group @xcite .",
    "several solutions to this number discrepancy have been proposed , ranging from selection effects in the observations @xcite to complex baryonic interactions that may have swept out the baryonic gas from the small halos @xcite .",
    "the former explanation for the discrepancy can only dimish the problem but not resolve it : taking into account the limitations of present day observations , one may extrapolate the number of dwarf galaxies to  at most  a few hundred .",
    "the latter type of solution can only be tested with semi - analytical models ( for a review see @xcite ) , which strongly rely on the details of the physics of star formation , which is not completely understood .",
    "the ejection of gas would leave thousands of empty small dark matter halos essentially intact .",
    "there is still no clear evidence of the presence of these objects in the dynamics of the local group .    in this work",
    "we propose an alternative approach .",
    "bearing in mind the growing plausability of oscillating features in the inflaton potential , we examine to what extent a simple localized oscillating modification of the inflaton potential for small field values can change the number of small dark matter halos .",
    "we restrict our analysis to perturbations of the inflaton potential which are still in the slow - roll regime .    in sections [ secsr ] and [ secmf ] we review the formalism and the derivation of the important relations used . in section [ secpot ]",
    "we discuss two simple modified oscillatory potentials : a saw - tooth modification and a sinusoidal modification . in section [ secresults ]",
    "we present our results and in section [ secconcl ] our conclusions .",

    "this can be obtained under the conditions of slow - roll , @xmath10 and @xmath11 where we used the notation @xmath12    it is possible to associate the comoving wavenumber , @xmath13 , of each mode of the density of perturbations with the inflaton value , @xmath14 , when this mode was leaving the hubble sphere .",

    ", we found that the number of small mass halos can be strongly reduced for many choices of the parameters @xmath64 ( which characterizes the amplitude ) and @xmath38 ( which characterizes the wavelength ) .",

    "as a representative example , we found that the number of halos with masses between @xmath67 and @xmath70 decreases by 54% for @xmath65 and @xmath60 .",
    "we conclude that small oscillatory patterns on the inflaton potential can cause large changes in the predicted halo mass function .",
    "in particular , if the oscillations begin in the @xmath0 range , for example , the oscillations can appreciably suppress the number of dwarf galaxies in this mass range , as observed .",
