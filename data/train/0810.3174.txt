    "the 7.0m - long , 2.3m - high atlas inner detector ( i d ) consists of three main subsystems : pixel , semiconductor tracker ( sct ) and transition radiation tracker ( trt ) , in radially increasing order .",
    "the i d is designed to measure momentum and charge of particle tracks and to determine vertices efficiently and precisely .",
    "it must be aligned with reliable accuracy and precision to meet the design specification  @xcite .",
    "the impact on physics performance of relative displacements between elements within the three main subsystems differs according to the direction of displacements , with the most sensitive being the @xmath0 coordinate of the silicon ( si ) detectors .",
    "achieving good alignment depends on : a good detector design and precision surveying during construction , effective software and hardware alignment algorithms and their efficient operation within daily data taking , understanding of systematic deformations , sufficient and prompt monitoring and validation .",
    "this note summarises the atlas i d alignment with selected illustrative examples of its performance .",
    "table  [ id_summary ] summarises the properties of the i d  @xcite .",
    "initial positions of the detector elements were obtained during the construction and assembly surveys .",
    "the mounting and survey precision for the si modules was less than 50@xmath1 m ; for trt wires , it was @xmath2 . for each tracker element ; both si and trt modules , there are three rotational and three translational degrees of freedom ( dof ) .",
    "all six are determined , except for trt barrel modules , where translation along readout wires is neglected .",
    ".summary of components , dof , intrinsic resolutions and estimated tolerances for alignment contribution to resolution  @xcite for the atlas i d . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ id_summary ]    due to the size and granularity of the subdetectors and the operational demands placed upon them , the i d alignment is a numerical and computational challenge taken up using state - of - the - art tools and algorithms .",
    "atlas uses track - based and optical alignment approaches to align the i d during atlas operation .",
    "track - based alignment within the atlas software framework relies on optimising residuals for particle tracks , where the residual is defined as the ( 2 or 3d ) distance between the fitted track and the track hit recorded by a module .",
    "currently , four independent track - based algorithms ( three for si and one for trt ) are implemented  @xcite , of which global @xmath3 and trt @xmath3 are the current official baseline algorithms .",
    "all except robust alignment , are based on @xmath3 minimisation .",
    "algorithms run iteratively to optimise the track - hit residuals by re - reconstructing tracks after each iteration .",
    "global @xmath3 algorithm minimises the @xmath3 from a simultaneous fit to all track and alignment parameters , taking into account correlation between modules .",
    "when solving for the entire si detector , there are 34992 dof to consider , which is computationally demanding .",
    "trt alignment is performed with respect to and after silicon alignment in the alignment chain .",
    "i d alignment algorithms were validated and used on various datasets over the past few years . the first data challenge consisted of aligning a single radial tower of the i d in a combined test beam setup  @xcite .",
    "all inner detector subcomponents collected cosmic ray data in so - called sr1 tests before being lowered into the cavern  @xcite .",
    "a subsection of trt and sct barrels took combined data in june 2006 which was successfully used for an initial trt - sct global alignment and detector internal alignment in the absence of a magnetic field .",
    "for the 468 modules read out from the sct in about 200k events , a residual width of 32 @xmath4 m , which was within 1 @xmath4 m of the ideal alignment in simulation , was reached .",
    "this was obtained starting from an unaligned detector with a residual width of 65  @xmath4 m , which indicated an already good sct barrel assembly precision .",
    "the first i d alignment in the atlas cavern ( without the pixel detector ) came from the cosmic runs (  m6 milestone \" run ) in march 2008 , where about 12k usable events were collected .",
    "five thousand tracks for sct and 4k tracks for trt were used to align the parts of the detectors covered by the trigger acceptance . given the low number of events , a module level alignment was not attempted for the sct .",
    "nevertheless , alignment based on m6 data improved the knowledge of the module positions in both detectors with trt residuals improving greatly ( fig .",
    "[ cosmic_results ] ) .",
    "the alignment information from m6 is now being used for the reconstruction of the cosmic data taken in the cavern .    within the csc ( computer system commissioning ) exercise , a realistic simulation of the atlas detector accounting for the assembly imperfections and material description was performed .",
    "i d misalignments were introduced at 3 levels of detector structure hierarchy , according to the build precision : level 1 , entire subdetectors defined by mechanical freedom , @xmath5 translations and @xmath6 rotations , level 2 , layers and disks for si , barrel modules for trt , @xmath2 , and level 3 , modules , full dof for si , none for trt , @xmath2 .",
    "a  multi - muon \" sample , flatly distributed in track parameters , and a cosmic ray sample were used in sequence to produce one set of alignment constants which was validated using z@xmath7 samples .",
    "the @xmath8 mass peak was successfully recovered with current algorithms , however , residual biases in track parameters were observed , due to the so - called  weak mode \" deformations .",
    "in addition to constraints imposed by using cosmic data , other constraints are needed for these weak modes to reach ultimate precision .",

    "the current model of i d alignment is to be able to provide a first pass alignment constants set and the beam spot position on a daily basis , using dedicated streams .",
    "a series of week - long mock exercises , the full dress rehearsal ( fdr ) , was performed to stress - test the readiness of the alignment platform for the upcoming data .",
    "the first exercise , fdr1 , took place in february 2008 . by the time of fdr2",
    "( june 2008 ) , the current alignment production model was in place .",
    "[ flow ] shows the alignment production loop .",
    "the beam spot calculation and i d alignment were performed in almost automatic mode , using special scripts to steer jobs running in parallel on about 100 cpu s and delivering constants in a 24-hour loop on dedicated computer queues at cern .",
    "the alignment was performed progressively using the global @xmath3 and trt algorithms , and constants were updated in the database each day upon validation , in increasing levels as mentioned above .",
    "simulated event triggers and filters were used to produce an alignment stream (  i d calibration stream \" ) misaligned the same way as the csc samples .",
    "this was extended using a sample of cosmic events with @xmath9-field . at the end of the last exercise in august 2008 ,",

    "collision data can be used to constrain some of these modes by imposing a common vertex and using additional information from other subdetectors , such as the muon spectrometer or the calorimeters .",
