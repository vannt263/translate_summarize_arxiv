    "in the past decades , several papers have been devoted to the theoretical and numerical investigation on the reactant segregation phenomena in anomalous kinetics.@xmath3 an important contribution to this field of research has been given by ovchinnikov and zeldovich,@xmath4 who developed the segregation phenomenon .",
    "it is well known that the binary reaction has primarily been investigated on the process of ternary reactions@xmath5 and many phenomena in nature.@xmath6 until now , the segregation of reactants has been investigated a reaction - diffusion process based on assumption that the scaling form for @xmath7 has almost been verified by the computer simulation and the experiment.@xmath8 the decay process for the reaction - diffusion system have been investigated by taitelbaum @xmath9 @xmath10@xmath11 who have precisely shown both the global reaction rate and the reaction front increased as a function of @xmath12 at very early times . at that time ,",
    "cornell @xmath9 @xmath10@xmath13 have argued the diffusion - limited reaction @xmath14 for both homogeneous and inhomogeneous conditions under initially separated reactants .",
    "they have discussed that the global reaction rate decreases as @xmath15 in long time limit , independent of @xmath16 and @xmath17 , and that the upper critical dimension is @xmath18 for the reaction - diffusion process .",
    "recently , zumofen @xmath9 @xmath10@xmath19 have studied mainly the particle density and the pair correlation function on the two - particles reaction process .",
    "particularly , they found that the particle density is distributed as @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , for lvy walks and that the segregation disappears in @xmath23 dimension for @xmath24 .",
    "yen @xmath9 @xmath10@xmath25 have studied for the asymptotic early - time scaling in the ternary reaction - diffusion process with initially separated reactants . moreover ,",
    "kim @xmath9 @xmath10@xmath26 argued the decay process in a reaction - diffusion system with three species on the regular square lattice . by a simple perturbation expansion ,",
    "we have analytically derived the particle density and the global reaction rate before and after the crossover in the reaction - diffusion system of @xmath27 .",
    "for last few years , a growing interest has been concentrated on small - world and scale - free network models,@xmath28 and these models have recently been widely studied in various applications of methods from physics to other natural , social and applied sciences . in fact , the phenomena of small - world and scale - free networks are showed to be different from the dynamical behavior of the regular lattice system .",
    "the degree distribution for scale - free networks scales as a power law @xmath29 for large k , while it decays faster than exponentially for random networks .",
    "it is , in present , of fundamental importance that the numerical and analytical result of small - world and scale - free network models is compared with that of regular network models .",
    "recently , the bimolecular chemical reaction in scale - free networks@xmath30 is in scale - free networks studied the generation of the depletion zone and the segregation of the reactants .",
    "it was found that the reaction - diffusion processes in scale - free networks is different in their nature compared to regular lattice models , due to the small diameter of networks and the existence of hubs .",
    "furthermore , catanzaro @xmath9 @xmath10@xmath31 have analyzed that the inverse particle density scales linearly as @xmath32 . from this result , they have found that the inverse particle density in uncorrelated scale - free network crosses over to a linear behavior .",
    "very recently , gallos and argyrakis@xmath33 have discussed the reaction - diffusion process of the two species on the scale - free network between the the correlated and the uncorrelated configuration models .",
    "they have especially revealed that two models are identical when @xmath34 .    in this paper ,",
    "the decay process for the reaction - diffusion process of three species on the small - world network is studied .",
    "we also consider the particle density and the global reaction rate on the two - dimensional small - world lattices added by new random links . in section @xmath35 , we discuss the reaction - diffusion process of three species on small - world networks .",
    "we present some results obtained by the numerical simulations and the concluding remark in the final section .",
    "in the reactions of @xmath36 and @xmath37 types on a @xmath38 dimensional regular lattice , the surviving particle density scales in long time limit as @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the initial particle density .",
    "it is well known that the scaling exponent @xmath41 for @xmath42 and @xmath43 for @xmath44 , and that the critical dimension @xmath18 for @xmath45 and @xmath46 for @xmath47 .    next the @xmath37 process on a regular network@xmath48",
    "is introduced for lvy walks using the following reaction - diffusion equation , @xmath49 @xmath50 where @xmath51 and @xmath52 are the particle densities , @xmath53 a generalized diffusion coefficient , @xmath54 a reaction rate , and @xmath55 the operator for the lvy - enhanced diffusion .",
    "the time - dependent particle densities can be calculated as @xmath56 where three marginal values are @xmath57 for @xmath58 , @xmath59 for @xmath23 , and @xmath60 for @xmath61 .    from the decay process@xmath25 of @xmath62@xmath63@xmath64 ,",
    "the diffusion equations under the initial reactant segregation are as follows : @xmath65 @xmath66 where @xmath67 and @xmath68 are the particle densities , @xmath69 is the microscopic reaction constant , and @xmath70 and @xmath71 are the diffusion coefficients of reactants @xmath67 and @xmath68 , respectively .",
    "then , from the lowest order of the perturbation theory , the global reaction rates @xmath72 on both the early time and long time behaviors scaled as a power law @xmath73 and @xmath74 , respectively . using the monte carlo method",
    ", it was found that the slopes are , respectively , @xmath75 and @xmath76 before and after the crossover .",
    "let us denote that @xmath77 , @xmath78 , and @xmath79 are the particle densities for three - species @xmath80 , @xmath81 , and @xmath64 existing at a position @xmath82 at time @xmath83 .",
    "we assume that three species are initially distributed separately on the axis @xmath82 .",
    "then , the deterministic rate equation for @xmath84 can be expressed in terms of @xmath85 where @xmath86 is the diffusion constant for one species @xmath80 , and @xmath87 is the reaction rate .",
    "the solution for @xmath67 , @xmath68 , and @xmath88 is obtained that @xmath89 in large time limit , where @xmath90 .",
    "similar to the result of the previous work,@xmath25 the time dependence of the global reaction rates @xmath72 was shown to behave as @xmath91 in early time and long time limits.@xmath26",
    "for the reaction - diffusion process of @xmath92 . our numerical simulation is performed on @xmath93 configurations in @xmath94 square lattice that is added by new random links for the added probability @xmath95 ( black circles ) , @xmath96 ( squares ) , @xmath97 ( circles ) , @xmath98 ( down triangles ) , and @xmath99 ( up triangles).,width=340 ]    in order to confirm numerically the global reaction rate , we mainly use the monte carlo simulation method in reaction - diffusion process of @xmath27 on the small - world network adding new random links .",
    "first of all , we assume that three species reactants are distributed randomly on two dimensional square lattice with the periodic boundary condition .",
    "after one species reactant is chosen at random , the direction of its move is chosen at random with equal probability to one of its linked neighbor lattice points .",
    "when two species reactants meet each other on the same lattice point , the intermediate process existing concurrently the combined two species reactants can be formed .",
    "if two species reactants meet the third reactant , these reactants react and leave immediately on lattice point .",
    "if one species or two species reactants can not meet the other reactant , the reactants diffuse randomly to one of its linked neighbor lattice points .",
    "the diffusion constant in our case takes the same value for each reactant , and the respective particle density of @xmath100 for @xmath80 , @xmath81 , and @xmath64 is distributed randomly on a square lattice having @xmath101 lattice points with the boundary condition .",
    "after our simulation is performed on @xmath93 realizations and @xmath102 , we directly observed the crossover for the global reaction rate from our simulation result .",
    "it is numerically found that the scaling exponent for the slope before and after the crossover is , respectively , @xmath0 and @xmath103 on the regular network @xmath104 . as shown in fig .",
    "@xmath43 , the time - dependent global reaction rate scales as a power law with the scaling exponent @xmath0 at early time regime while it scales with @xmath1 at long time regime , in all four cases of the added probability @xmath105 , @xmath97 , @xmath98 , and @xmath99 .    in conclusion , we have numerically estimated the global reaction rate before and after the crossover in reaction - diffusion system of @xmath27 on square lattice added by new random links . it is really found from our simulation result that the scaling exponent of the global reaction rate on small - world network added by new random links is the similar to that of the regular network at early time regime . at long time regime , the decay process on small - world network proceeds slightly faster than in the case of the regular network .    in future ,",
    "our work is in progress to extend the correlated and the uncorrelated configuration models .",
    "we also will attempt to investigate small - world and scale - free networks in several scientific fields for three species reaction - diffusion process .",
