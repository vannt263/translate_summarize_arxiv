    "in recent years one dimensional interacting electron systems have attracted a large amount of attention .",
    "part of the interest in these systems lies in the fact that electron - electron interactions in 1-d wires , even when weak , can not be considered perturbatively .",
    "a question of practical importance , dealt with by a number of authors @xcite-@xcite , is that of the contact conductance of a one dimensional system connected to an external electrode .",
    "most works on the subject picture the junction as a one dimensional wire connected to the electrode at a point . here",
    "it has been found that electron - electron interactions strongly influence the conductance through the junction . in particular",
    ", repulsive interactions in the wire drive the system to be insulating at low enough temperatures , unless the contact is perfectly clean .",
    "attractive interactions , on the other hand , mask obstructions at the interface between the two systems .",
    "these results do not qualitatively change whether the electrode is superconducting or metallic .    in this paper",
    "we explore the behavior of a junction between a 1-d wire and a superconducting electrode of different geometry , specifically , the situation where the wire is embedded some distance into the electrode , as illustrated in fig .  [ pc_and_lc_junction ] . in this case one",
    "expects that superconducting order is induced in the part of the wire which is embedded in the superconductor , enhancing the conductance of the junction . on the other hand , for point contacts with even a small amount of normal reflection ( and repulsive interactions in the wire ) , it has been shown that superconducting order suppresses the conductivity of the junction @xcite .",
    "the main goal of this work is to clarify how these two competing effects determine the behavior of the junction as a function of the temperature ( or the applied voltage ) , and length of the embedded wire .     into the bulk , width=288 ]",
    "as expected , provided interactions within the wire are not too strong , superconducting order is induced in the part of the wire embedded in the bulk , and an effective gap is formed in the wire whose value is determined by the tunneling rate between the superconductor and the wire , as well as the nature of the electron interactions . yet , in spite of this proximity effect , the junction conductance exhibits a crossover from a conductive state , governed by andreev scattering , to an insulating behavior at low enough temperatures , characterized by a power law dependence on the temperature .",
    "this behavior results from the finite amount of normal backscattering within the wire .",
    "we found that the characteristic crossover temperature between the two regimes has a stretched exponential dependence on the length of the junction , and the amount of stretch is determined by the strength of the electron interactions in the wire .",
    "the article is organized as follows : in the next section the model whereby a 1-d wire is embedded infinitely deep into a bulk bcs superconductor is introduced . by integrating out the superconductor degrees of freedom the effective action of the embedded wire is obtained . in sec .",
    "ii and the appendix , renormalization group ( rg ) techniques are employed in order to characterize the behavior of a 1-d wire embedded in a bcs superconductor .",
    "this rg flow allows one to deduce the low energy properties of the finite part of the wire embedded in the superconductor . in sec .",
    "iii the conductance of the wire - superconductor junction is evaluated .",
    "finally , the results are summarized and discussed in sec .",
    "we consider a single 1-d wire with interacting electrons ( including backscattering ) , embedded inside a standard bsc superconductor ( sc ) .",
    "the action of the system is a sum of three contributions : @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the action of the superconductor , @xmath2 is the action of the wire , and @xmath3 describes the tunneling between the two systems .",
    "@xmath4 is the electronic field operator in the wire , @xmath5 is the field operator in the sc , and @xmath6 denotes the spin index .    the action of the sc , modeled by the standard bcs hamiltonian with a constant pairing amplitude @xmath7 , has the form @xmath8\\ ] ] where the vector @xmath9 contains three space coordinates and an imaginary time , @xmath10 is the sc electron field in nambu notation , and @xmath11 is the free fermi gas hamiltonian , with @xmath12 and @xmath13 as the electron mass and chemical potential , respectively .    the 1-d wire is modeled as a bosonized luttinger liquid . since the literature on this subject is quite extensive ( ref . [ 13 ] and therein ) , we will only point out the more relevant details to the topic at hand .",
    "we represent the electronic fields@xcite , @xmath14},\\ ] ] in terms of boson charge and spin density fields : @xmath15 , and their conjugates , @xmath16 , where @xmath17 denotes the charge and spin sectors , respectively . in the above formula , @xmath18 is the fermi wave number , @xmath19 is the short distance cutoff , @xmath20 is the chiral index representing the right ( @xmath21 ) and left ( @xmath22 ) moving part of the electronic field , and @xmath23 for @xmath24 spin while @xmath25 for @xmath26 spin .    in terms of the boson fields ,",
    "the action of the wire becomes a sum of three contributions : @xmath27 where    @xmath28    describes the charge sector ( after the dependence on the @xmath29 field has been integrated out@xcite ) .",
    "a similar expression describes the spin sector , @xmath30 , with the subscript @xmath31 replaced by @xmath32 and @xmath33 replaced by @xmath34 .",
    "here @xmath33 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , and @xmath37 are model specific parameters describing the interaction strength ( @xmath38 ) and the mode velocity ( @xmath39 ) of the charge and the spin fields . for the noninteracting case @xmath40 and @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is the fermi velocity of the wire .",
    "for an interacting system , values of @xmath43 and @xmath44 correspond to attractive interactions , while @xmath45 , @xmath46 correspond to repulsive ones . generally in an interacting system the velocity of the two modes differ , @xmath47 .",
    "the third term of the wire s action , @xmath48 , describes backscattering of two electrons with opposite spins .",
    "namely a collision which effectively results in a spin flip between the right and left moving parts of the electronic field ( @xmath49 ) .",
    "this term has the form @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the backscattering coupling constant .",
    "finally , the tunneling between the superconductor and the wire is described by @xmath52 where @xmath53 , and @xmath54 is the tunneling matrix element . in the simplest case",
    "this tunneling is instantaneous , homogeneous in space , short distant and su(2 ) spin symmetric . under these assumptions",
    "it takes the form @xmath55 where @xmath56 has the characteristic function form : @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the length of the part of the wire embedded in the superconductor ( see fig .",
    "[ pc_and_lc_junction ] ( b ) ) .",
    "the effective action of a wire embedded in a superconductor is obtained by tracing out the superconductor degrees of freedom , @xmath59e^{-s\\left(\\bar{\\varphi } , \\varphi;\\bar{\\psi},\\psi\\right)}\\ ] ] where @xmath60 is given by ( [ action ] ) .",
    "since the action is quadratic in the superconductor field , this integration is straightforward .",
    "the result may be written as a sum of three terms , @xmath61 , where @xmath62 , and @xmath63 represent contributions associated with giever ( particle - hole ) and andreev ( particle - particle ) tunneling , respectively . at energies above the superconductor gap",
    "@xmath7 the particle - hole term is dominant and it s contribution , on integrating it out , will be to renormalize the chemical potential .",
    "on the other hand , in the low temperature regime ( well below the superconductor gap @xmath7 ) the particle - hole term vanishes and the main contribution comes from the andreev tunneling term , @xmath63 . in this limit , after averaging over the rapid spatial oscillations , the tunneling becomes local in space and time . expressing it in terms of the bosonic fields we thus have @xmath64 where @xmath2 is given by ( [ waction ] ) , and @xmath65 where @xmath66 . here",
    "@xmath67 is the normal density of states of the sc at the fermi level , and @xmath68 is the fermi momentum .    in terms of the original _ fermionic _ fields , the tunneling term has the form of the regular pairing term in the standard bcs theory : @xmath69    in the absence of electron - electron interactions , this term , along with the free quadratic kinetic term of the model can be diagonalized by the standard bogolubov transformation .",
    "the excitation spectrum of this system will be gapped with an energy of @xmath70 .",
    "the effective action ( [ seff ] ) describes the physics of the junction for a temperature up to the order of the superconductor gap , @xmath7 ( which will subsequently provide the high energy cut - off of our system ) .    in order to describe the behavior of the system at much lower energy scales , and take into account the electron - electron repulsive interactions",
    ", we shall employ a real space rg approach , following giamarchi & schulz @xcite . as usual in these cases the rg procedure manifest itself in a flow of the coupling constants of the problem as the ultraviolet cut off",
    "is reduced from @xmath71 to @xmath72 . in our problem",
    "these coupling constants are : the interaction strengths , @xmath73 ; the mode velocities , @xmath74 ; the dimensionless backscattering constant , @xmath75 ; and the dimensionless pair tunneling strength @xmath76 .",
    "the flow equations of these coupling constants ( see appendix for the details of the derivation ) are :    @xmath77    where @xmath78 is the dimensionless change in the ultraviolet cutoff ,    @xmath79    and @xmath80 while @xmath81 .    we shall restrict our analysis to the spin symmetric case ( i.e. the situation where the interactions between electrons with parallel and opposite spins are identical ) . in this case@xcite @xmath82 , and equations ( [ dksdl ] ) and",
    "( [ dydl ] ) for the dimensionless backscattering @xmath83 and spin interaction strength @xmath84 reduce to : @xmath85 thus maintaining spin invariance .",
    "the above rg equations imply that the charge and spin velocities , @xmath36 and @xmath37 , renormalize towards each other .",
    "this is a consequence of the correlations between spin and charge excitations generated by the proximity effect . from eqs .",
    "( [ ducdl ] ) , ( [ dusdl ] ) , and ( [ sfw ] ) one can observe that the signs of @xmath86 and @xmath87 are determined by the ratio @xmath88 in such a way that the velocities approach each other .    another consequence of the rg equations,([dkcdl ] ) and ( [ dksdl ] ) , is that @xmath33 can only grow , while @xmath84 can only be reduced .",
    "this flow stem from the finite value of the tunneling parameter @xmath89 ( and @xmath83 ) .",
    "thus the rg behavior of @xmath89 controls the behavior of the system .",
    "the separatix between the regions where @xmath89 is relevant or irrelevant can be obtained numerically for a given set of bare parameters .",
    "it is clear that for initially repulsive interactions ( @xmath90 ) , @xmath89 will be relevant if : @xmath91 since the flow equations can only drive @xmath92 to be more `` attractive '' . in fig .",
    "[ kc_delta_fig ] we depict the rg flow in the @xmath89-@xmath33 plane , in the spin symmetric case , for several initial values of @xmath93 in the range between 0.32 - 0.325 .",
    "[ rel - irel_fig ] shows the separatix between relevant and irrelevant tunneling for initial bare ( repulsive ) values of @xmath33 and @xmath83 .",
    "one can observe that @xmath33 must be smaller than @xmath94 for the tunneling to be irrelevant .     as a function of @xmath33 for initial values of @xmath95 between 0.32 - 0.325 .",
    "the transition between irrelevant ( @xmath96 ) and relevant ( @xmath97 ) tunneling occurs at @xmath98 .",
    "the initial values of @xmath99 and @xmath100 are 0.05 and 0.1 respectively , height=172 ]     and @xmath83,height=192 ]    in the case where @xmath89 is irrelevant , the wire effectively decouples from the superconductor .",
    "the pair tunneling between the two systems is suppressed and the superconductor - wire junction becomes insulating .",
    "notice however that this behavior takes place at very strong repulsive interactions , @xmath101 , where the system tends to wigner crystallize@xcite .",
    "in the situation where @xmath89 is relevant , the system flows to a singlet superconducting state .",
    "the interaction parameters become attractive and spin - charge separation is no longer valid . yet , before the interaction parameters obtain their asymptotic values ( i.e @xmath102 , @xmath103 and @xmath104 which correspond to `` infinitely '' attractive interactions ) , the rg equations ( [ dkcdl]- [ dusdl ] ) will cease to be valid since the small parameters of our perturbation theory , @xmath89 and @xmath83 , will flow to the strong coupling regime .      in what follows we consider a weakly interacting luttinger liquid , where the bare interaction parameters are close to unity . moreover , in order to ensure that the perturbative rg equations ( [ dkcdl]- [ dusdl ] ) remain valid we shall assume that @xmath58 , the embedding length , is of order or smaller then the bare superconducting correlation length , @xmath105 .",
    "since @xmath58 serves as an infrared cutoff for the rg flow , this condition ensures that the this flow is confined to the perturbative regime .",
    "we shall also assume that the temperature is much smaller than @xmath70 , and approximate the velocities of the spin and charge sectors by their asymptotic renormalized values : @xmath41 .",
    "in the limit of weak interactions the rg equations for @xmath106 are of second order in the perturbation parameters ( @xmath107 ) , while the equation for @xmath89 ( eq . [ ddldl ] ) is of first order ( neglecting the @xmath83 dependance , which is of second order as well ) .",
    "the equation for the coupling @xmath83 ( eq .  [ dydl ] ) is also second order in small parameters , at least if we consider the spin symmetric case .",
    "thus one can assume @xmath108 , @xmath35 , and @xmath83 to be approximately constants , and consider the simplified equation for @xmath89 : @xmath109 where @xmath110    integrating the above equations from @xmath111 to @xmath112 , and using the relation @xmath113 , we obtain the renormalized value of the gap of the wire embedded in the superconductor : @xmath114 in particular , repulsive interactions ( @xmath115 and @xmath116 , and therefore @xmath117 ) reduce the effective gap in the wire .",
    "this renormalization of the gap implies that the effective correlation length , @xmath118 is larger than the bare correlation length @xmath119 .",
    "the above results are valid as long as the rg flow stays within the perturbative regime , namely @xmath120 .",
    "this condition implies that @xmath58 should be shorter than @xmath121 .",
    "at this stage of the rg procedure ( pursued up to the scale @xmath58 ) the junction between the wire and the superconductor may be assumed to be point - like .",
    "thus if the temperature ( or the applied voltage ) is smaller than @xmath122 one may continue to integrate out the high energy degrees of freedom in the part of the wire which is not embedded into the superconductor down to the relevant energy scale .",
    "this may be achieved following the procedure described in the literature@xcite .",
    "the important ingredient , now , is the magnitude of normal back scattering from the junction .",
    "the latter is of order of @xmath123 where @xmath124 is system specific reflection amplitude in the absence of superconductivity , while @xmath125 is the correlation length ( [ eff - cor ] ) within the part of the wire embedded in the superconductor .",
    "this behavior of @xmath126 results form the fact that only the charge that is not converted to the condensate backscatters from the edge of the wire embedded in the superconductor . according to@xcite the normal current reduces exponentially with the distance on a length scale of @xmath127 , which gives the above estimate for @xmath126 . now ,",
    "since @xmath125 depends on @xmath58 , the magnitude of the normal reflection has a stretched exponential dependence : @xmath128 where @xmath129 , and the amount of stretch , @xmath130 , is dictated by the nature of the electron - electron interactions within the wire , as follows from ( [ beta ] ) .",
    "the behavior of the backscattering , clearly , manifests itself in the conductance of the junction . in the limit of sufficiently high temperatures ,",
    "one obtains @xcite : @xmath131 where @xmath132 represents the conductance of an ideal junction where only perfect andreev reflections take place , and @xmath133    the above formula holds for the range of temperature where @xmath134 , since @xmath135 can not be larger than @xmath136 .",
    "nevertheless , it has been shown @xcite-@xcite , that any scatterer , at a point contact between a wire with repulsive interactions and a sc , will eventually drive the conductance to zero as the temperature is lowered .",
    "since any finite length junction will have some backscattering , the conductance should drop to zero for low enough temperatures , as illustrated in fig .",
    "the crossover temperature , @xmath137 from the conductive and the insulating behavior of the junction depends on the length of the wire embedded in the superconductor and its scaling behavior may be deduced from ( [ dsg0mindg ] ) and ( [ dsspcr ] ) : @xmath138    this result implies that the temperature scale at which the effects of backscattering becomes substantial reduce as a stretched exponent with the length of the junction , and the stretch is determined by the interactions , through the parameter @xmath130 .    ) . in the zero temperature limit , represented by the dashed curve",
    ", any initial finite backscattering will eventually drive the conductance to zero .",
    "the crossover temperature , eq .",
    "( [ dctstr ] ) between the two behaviors is estimated to scale as a stretched exponent in the length of the junction.,width=240,height=192 ]    .",
    "in this work we studied a junction of a 1-d wire embedded a certain length , @xmath58 , into a bulk superconductor .",
    "we first characterized the nature of the contact between the 1-d wire and the superconductor using a real space rg scheme .",
    "we found that repulsive interactions in the wire compete against the superconducting order being imposed by the bulk superconductor .",
    "the system can flow to either of two phases , depending on the nature of the interactions .",
    "when the interactions are strongly repulsive the tunneling between the two systems becomes irrelevant and the wire essentially decouples from the bulk superconductor . for moderate repulsive interactions , and for attractive interactions , tunneling is relevant , and the bulk superconductor induces superconducting order in the wire .",
    "the gap opened in the wire depend on the tunneling strength , and electron - electron interactions modify its nominal value .",
    "the finite length of the part of the wire embedded in the superconductor , @xmath58 , implies that the rg flow , in general , does not reach its asymptotic ( non - perturbative ) limit .",
    "thus @xmath58 introduces itself in the behavior of the effective gap , and the effective correlation length , in the wire .",
    "this , in turn , dictates a stretched exponential behavior of the normal reflection from the junction as function of @xmath58 . for energy scales ( temperature or voltages ) beneath the effective gap",
    ", we described the qualitative picture of the conductance as a function of temperature and length of the embedded segment of wire , see fig .",
    "[ schem_fig ] .",
    "several simplifications have been used for our analysis : one is that our model treats a semi - infinite wire with a single junction , while in practical situations a finite wire is usually connected to two reservoirs .",
    "this idealization holds as long as the segment of the wire outside the superconductor is long enough compared to @xmath139 , where @xmath140 is the fermi velocity and @xmath141 is the temperature .",
    "additional simplification is the assumption that the embedding of the wire into the bulk superconductor does not introduce inhomogeneities , i.e. the wire can be still considered to be clean , and that the tunneling to the superconductor is homogenous along the wire .",
    "this approximation holds when the transport mean free path in the wire is longer than @xmath58 . in the opposite limit one expects a different behavior of the proximity effect which will change the conductance of the system .",
    "the authors gratefully acknowledge discussions with dror orgad . this work has been supported in part by the israel science foundation ( isf ) funded by the israeli academy of science and humanities , and by the usa - israel binational science foundation ( bsf ) .",
    "the mathematical formulation used in this work follows closely the real space rg procedure used by giamarchi & schulz @xcite : in this procedure one evaluates a correlation function in the wire , of the form ( the time ordering symbol is suppressed ) : @xmath142 where @xmath143 can symbolize any of the boson fields and @xmath130 is some constant . for the following discussion it will suffice to examine only one of the sectors , for instance the spin sector .",
    "the same considerations can be carried on straightforwardly for the charge sector .",
    "the fact that the relevant boson fields in the spin sector is @xmath144 leads naturally to the evaluation of the correlation functions : @xmath145 unfortunately this correlation function can not be calculated exactly using the complete effective action ( [ seff ] ) .",
    "though , if the tunneling and backscattering parameters , ( @xmath146 and @xmath51 respectively ) , are small then it may be computed perturbatively .",
    "to second order in these parameters this function is found to be : @xmath147 where @xmath148 , and @xmath149 is the angle between the vector @xmath150 and the @xmath151 axis .",
    "the function @xmath152 is ( at zero temperature ) @xcite : @xmath153 apart from the term proportional to @xmath154 , this functional form is identical to the free correlation function : @xmath155 but with an effective luttinger interaction constant @xmath156 modified by the perturbations :        integrating out high energy degrees of freedom , near the ultraviolet cutoff , corresponds to integrating out a `` small ring '' between @xmath161 , where @xmath19 is the small distances parameter of the model . after integration and rescaling ,",
    "an infinitesimal change is generated in the expressions for @xmath156 . in order to keep @xmath156 constant with the reduction of the cutoff",
    ", it is required that the bare parameters change .",
    "for instance , we find that : @xmath162 which generates an ( exact ) differential equation for @xmath84 : @xmath163 ( here @xmath164 ) .",
    "the @xmath154 contribution to the correlation function arises from the fact that the tunneling perturbation couples the spin and charge sectors , which were uncoupled without this term .",
    "mathematically , this term characterizes the anisotropy between the space ( @xmath151 ) and time ( @xmath166 ) directions .",
    "it s pre - factor @xmath167 is given by : @xmath168 where @xmath87 is another geometric term factor : @xmath169    applying the same renormalization scheme to @xmath167 , will generate the flow of the parameter @xmath170 : @xmath171 it should be noted that @xmath170 is initially zero but is generated under renormalization .",
    "the parameter @xmath170 controls the renormalization of the velocity parameter . as long as the space and time directions are isotropic",
    "the velocity parameter does not flow under renormalization , but they should flow in the anisotropic case . indeed , assuming that initially the correlation function is described by the function @xmath172 , then a small change of @xmath173 will generate the term : @xmath174 . up to a factor , this is exactly the anisotropy term .",
    "therefore , the renormalization of @xmath170 is equivalent to that of the velocity @xmath175 by the following relation ( e.g. eq . [ dvref]):@xmath176",
    ".      finally these equations can not be exactly correct , since they do not maintain the spin invariance su(2 ) of a model that was spin invariant to begin with .",
    "( a spin symmetric model is one where the interactions between electrons of opposite and parallel spin are identical ) .",
    "since the perturbations do not break this symmetry , something in the above result is insufficient .",
    "indeed , it turns out that the remedy for this problem lies in the inclusion of the third order terms of perturbation theory .",
    "this correction is presented in reference @xcite .",
    "it affects only the equations for @xmath89 ( eq . ( [ dvrt]))and @xmath83 ( eq . ( [ dvry ] ) ) which become : @xmath178"
