    "this approach is certainly relevant to the class of smooth wilson loops without cusps .",
    "the mm equations in the form ( [ eq : mm_general ] ) are exact and nonperturbative and reflect the differential geometrical structure of the loop space . however , the range of practical use of the mm equations is quite restricted because of the following reasons @xcite .",
    "first , most physically interesting wilson loops develop ultraviolet , infrared and light - cone divergences ; in addition to that , they possess specific obstructions , cusps and/or self - intersections , which yield yet other problems with corresponding divergences .",
    "it is known , however , that eq .",
    "( [ eq : mm_general ] ) can not be applied straightforwardly to the lightlike wilson loops with cusps .",
    "the renormalized version of the mm equation which is valid for these loops is not available .",
    "one of the reasons is that the area functional derivative is not a well - defined operation for arbitrary contours with obstructions .",
    "next , there are subtle points related to the continuous deformations of the paths in minkowski space - time making the meaning of the derivatives unclear .",
    "in particular , in @xcite it is argued that minkowski space - time is as unconnected as a space can be with respect to a path - topology ( this resembles the structure of the set of rational numbers in the space of real numbers : although the rational numbers are infinitely close to each other , one can not move from a rational number to another one without crossing a real number ) .",
    "several attempts to define a correct path / loop space in order to solve this problem have been made without success .",
    "recently , the new developments in the field of twistor theory have shown the mm equations to be valid , but the calculations are implemented in a completely different background ( twistor space ) @xcite .",
    "general solutions of the mm equations in the four - dimensional space - time are also not known .    on the other hand ,",
    "there are several approximations and simplifications which might make life easier .",
    "first , in the t hooft large-@xmath17 limit , the factorization property allows one to get the mm eq .",
    "closed : @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "second , restricting ourselves to only light - cone rectangular contours , we end up with an effectively two - dimensional case : the space - time dimension where there is hope to solve the mm eqs .",
    "further , if one concentrates on the light - like polygons , then the angles between light - rays are fixed and conserved under any allowed area or path variation ( that imposes additional constraint on the possible variations , of course ) .",
    "hence , there are no angle - dependent contributions which may make the area differentiation ill - defined .",
    "finally , the power of divergency decreases under the area differentiation , making it possible to construct appropriate renormalization - group equations for those loops .    in this work ,",
    "we address some of these issues , considering a special class of the wilson loops , namely the rectangular quadrilaterals with their sides being defined on the light cone .",
    "strong interest to the cusped lightlike polygonal eikonal paths is related to the recently observed duality between the @xmath19gluon planar scattering amplitudes in the @xmath20 super - yang - mills theory and the vacuum average of the wilson loops formed , correspondingly , by @xmath21 light - like segments connecting the space - time points @xmath22 , so that their _ lengths _ @xmath23 are set equal to the external momenta of the @xmath19gluon amplitude ( see , e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "it has been shown that the infrared evolution of the former is ( or is expected to be ) dual to the ultraviolet evolution of the latter , with the the cusp anomalous dimension being the main ingredient of the evolution equations @xcite .",
    "therefore , the dynamical content , for instance , of a @xmath24 scattering process in the momentum space maps the local geometrical properties of the light - like quadrilateral wilson loop defined in the coordinate space .",
    "the local properties of minkowskian paths in vicinity of the obstructions are known to be expressed in terms of the universal path - independent cusp anomalous dimension .",
    "further , the wilson loops containing light - like segments were studied a couple of decades ago within a different context @xcite .",
    "it was demonstrated that the renormalization properties of these objects are more complicated than the renormalization - group behavior of the cusped wilson loops off the light - cone . in particular , the light - cone wilson loops are not multiplicatively renormalizable due to the peculiar light - cone singularities arising in addition to the common ultraviolet and the infrared ones .",
    "still it is possible to construct a combined renormalization - group equation reckoning with both the ultraviolet and the light - cone divergences , so that its solution does not show any pathological behavior .",
    "the cusp anomalous dimension which enters this equation is known to be of remarkable universality : it controls , for example , the infrared asymptotic behavior of phenomenologically important quantities such as the qcd and qed sudakov form factors , the gluon regge trajectory , the integrated ( collinear ) parton distribution functions at large-@xmath0 , the anomalous dimension of the heavy quark effective theory , etc . @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , recent study of the operator definition of transverse - momentum dependent parton densities ( tmds ) reveals that these quantities , taken literally , demonstrate the similar extra light - cone singularities associated with rapidity divergences @xcite . the virtual feynman graphs producing such terms",
    "are shown in fig .",

    "evaluation of the cusped light - cone wilson loops beyond the tree approximation in different ( covariant , axial , light - cone , contour , etc . ) gauges and corroboration of gauge independence of the result demands careful treatment of different classes of divergences even in the one - loop order .",
    "special attention must by paid to the separation of the light - cone ( also known as rapidity ) singularities and the normal ultraviolet poles .",
    "we refer for more detailed discussion and further references to @xcite . in the large-@xmath17 limit we have in the coordinate space @xcite @xmath26^\\epsilon + \\[{2 n^+ n^-\\mu^2 + i0}\\]^\\epsilon   \\ ) \\\\ & &   + \\frac{\\alpha_s n_c}{2\\pi } \\",

    "we will show in a separate paper that the result ( [ eq : wl_lc_1loop ] ) is not only gauge invariant , but remarkably independent of any regularization of light - cone and ultraviolet divergences and of the way of their separation @xcite .",
    "this issue is of particular importance to the understanding of the operator structure of transverse - momentum dependent parton densities and soft - collinear effective theory ( see , e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) .",

    "we relate , therefore , the geometry of the loop space ( expressed in terms of the area differentials ) to the dynamics of the fundamental degrees of freedom  the gauge invariant , regularization independent light - like wilson loops .",
    "let us show that the trick ( [ eq : log_der ] , [ eq : full_der ] ) is not just a handy technical tool , but a direct consequence of the geometrical properties of the loop space , whose constituents are the non - renormalizable cusped light - like wilson loops . to this end",
    ", we shall start with the fundamental quantum dynamical principle proposed by schwinger @xcite . according to the latter",
    ", the quantum action operator @xmath37 governs variations of arbitrary states : @xmath38 however , this equation , being valid for renormalizable quantities , knows nothing about the non - renormalizable ones .",
    "the previous results give us a clue to further analysis : let us study the area variations defined in ( [ eq : delta_area ] ) @xmath39 take into account the renormalization group invariance of the schwinger equation in the _ weak _ form and apply the resulting operator to the cusped light - like contours .",
    "given that the space under consideration is made of scalar objects owning different geometrical and topological properties , one concludes that the equations of motion satisfied by those objects should prescribe the laws according to which they change their form .",
    "the motions in the loop space are , putting it formally , variations of the contours @xcite .",
    "therefore , the problem arises how to find the correct form of the operator @xmath37 , which is responsible for the form variations of the lightlike cusped loops ( wilson null - polygons ) . within the standard approach ,",

    "after simple manipulations and the path differentiation at the same point @xmath0 , one obtains the leading order term of the makeenko - migdal equation ( [ eq : mm_general ] ) : @xmath49 however , we have to be careful with this result : to derive it , one tacitly assumed that the stokes theorem is applicable for all wilson loops of interest .",
    "the latter is not the case in general , for that reason we denote the _ good _ ( smooth enough ) contours by a circle index @xmath50 .",

    "let us examine whether the above result is only the one - loop approximation , or it can be extended to the higher orders . to this end",

    "the quantum dynamical approach formulated by schwinger some half a century ago provides a full and consistent description of the geometrical properties of the loop space .",

    "general solution of this problem is still lacking , but we have found that there is a class of the loops for which some simplifications are possible and helpful . in particular , in the large-@xmath17 limit , in the case of the rectangular light - like wilson loops defined in the null - plane @xmath88 , the area functional derivative is reduced to the normal derivative for the dimensionally regularized ( not renormalized ) loops .",
