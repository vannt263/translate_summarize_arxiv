    "the description of the algebraic topology of the moduli space @xmath2 of compact complex algebraic curves has long been a tantalizing problem .",
    "the idea of `` stable cohomology '' of @xmath2 as the genus @xmath5 , brought in by j.  l. harer and d.  mumford , suggested a more graspable object to study as a first step .",
    "mumford s conjecture @xcite , stating that the stable cohomology  is the polynomial algebra on the so - called mumford - morita - miller classes , has become a new tantalizing problem since then .",
    "recently m.  pikaart @xcite has proven that the hodge structure on the stable cohomologyis pure , thus providing more evidence to the conjecture , which easily implies purity .",
    "our purpose in this note is to show that the rational homotopy type of the moduli space @xmath2 stabilizes as @xmath5 and prove that the moduli space is formal in the stable limit . if the stable cohomology  of the moduli space were just known to be the cohomology  of a certain space @xmath6 , then a theorem of e.  miller and s.  morita @xcite asserting that @xmath7 is a free graded commutative algebra would immediately imply the formality of @xmath6",
    "thus , the essential result of this paper is showing that the limit of the rational homotopy types of @xmath2 as @xmath8 exists .",
    "after this is done , the formality of the limit is automatic .",
    "here are few words about the structure of the paper .",
    "sections 1 and 2 are dedicated to the description of the ( nonstable ) rational homotopy type of the moduli space @xmath2 .",
    "section  [ infty ] , where the stable rational homotopy type of @xmath2 is studied , is independent of the first two sections .",
    "it may be worth noting how this paper relates to jim stasheff s work .",
    "stasheff polyhedra @xmath9 are known for many remarkable properties .",
    "one of them , that @xmath9 is a connected component of the real compactification of the moduli space of real projective lines with @xmath10 punctures , was pointed out by m.  kontsevich in @xcite .",
    "thus , stasheff polyhedra are real analogues of the compactified moduli spaces @xmath11 . or , perhaps , the moduli spaces @xmath11 are complex analogues of stasheff polyhedra , the chicken and the egg problem .",
    "the topology of @xmath9 is trivial ( @xmath9 is contractible ) , and the topology of @xmath2 and @xmath11 is just the opposite .",
    "it is rather the combinatorics of stasheff polyhedra which makes them very useful in the topology of loop spaces @xcite .",
    "the combinatorics of the genus zero spaces @xmath12 has similarly proven to be useful in studying the topology of double loop spaces @xcite and the algebraic structure of 2d quantum field theory @xcite . but what is the topology of these complex analogues of stasheff polyhedra , especially for a high genus ?",
    "we also implicitly use a result of s.  halperin and stasheff @xcite throughout the paper : formality over any field of characteristic zero implies that over the rationals .",
    "i am very grateful to pierre deligne , dick hain , eduard looijenga , and martin pikaart for helpful discussions .",
    "i would like to thank the institute for advanced study in princeton and the research institute for mathematical sciences in kyoto for their hospitality during the summer 1997 , when the essential part of the work on this paper was done .",
    "here we recall j.  w. morgan s description @xcite of a model of the rational homotopy type of the complement @xmath13 of a normal crossings divisor @xmath14 in a compact complex manifold @xmath15 .",
    "the rational homotopy type will be understood in the sense of d.  sullivan @xcite , see also p.  a. griffiths and morgan @xcite and d.  lehmann @xcite .",
    "it determines the usual rational homotopy type of a topological space if it is simply connected . in general",
    "it determines the rational nilpotent completion thereof .",
    "the rational homotopy type of @xmath13 is determined by the differential graded ( dg ) commutative algebra that is nothing but the first term @xmath16 of the spectral sequence associated with the weight filtration on the log - complex @xmath17 of the smooth @xmath18-forms on @xmath13 with logarithmic singularities along @xmath19 .",
    "otherwise , one can describe the same dg algebra as the second term of the leray spectral sequence of inclusion @xmath20 . in any case , the model of @xmath13 is given by the dg algebra @xmath21 , where @xmath22 the multiplication structure is given by @xmath23 for @xmath24 and @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the sign of the shuffle putting the set @xmath27 in an increasing order , assuming each of the subsets @xmath28 and @xmath29 to be already in an increasing order .",
    "note that this multiplication law makes @xmath30 into a bigraded commutative algebra .",
    "finally , the differential @xmath31 can be described as @xmath32 where @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 is the natural embedding @xmath36 , and @xmath37 is the gysin map .",
    "p.  deligne @xcite proved that the spectral sequence @xmath38 degenerates at @xmath39 , that is , the cohomology  of the dg algebra @xmath21 is equal to @xmath40 .",
    "the very dg algebra @xmath21 describes the rational homotopy type of @xmath13 , according to morgan s theorem @xcite .",
    "results of the previous section apply to the moduli space @xmath2 , which is the complement of a normal crossing divisor in the deligne - knudsen - mumford compactification @xmath11 .",
    "the problem that the space in question is a stack rather than variety does not arise , because we work with the * complex coefficients * , as we will assume throughout the paper . from the combinatorics of deligne - knudsen - mumford s construction",
    ", we can say more specifically , cf .",
    "@xcite , that @xmath41 the summation running over all stable labeled @xmath4-graphs @xmath42 of genus @xmath43 and @xmath44 vertices . here",
    "we refer to _ graphs _ of the following kind .",
    "each graph is connected and has _",
    "@xmath4 enumerated exterior edges _ , edges which are incident with only one vertex of the graph .",
    "each vertex @xmath45 of the graph is _ labeled _ by a nonnegative integer @xmath46 , called the genus of a vertex .",
    "the _ stability _",
    "condition means that any vertex @xmath45 labeled by @xmath47 should be incident with at least one edge ( i.e. , be at least of valence one ) and each vertex @xmath45 with @xmath48 should be at least of valence three .",
    "the _ genus _ @xmath49 of a graph @xmath42 is given by the formula @xmath50 , where @xmath51 is the first betti number of the graph .",
    "number @xmath52 _ is the valence of the vertex @xmath45 and @xmath53 is the _ automorphism group of a graph @xmath42 _ ( bijections on vertices and edges , preserving the exterior edges , the labels of vertices and the incidence relation ) .",
    "the subscript @xmath54 in the formula refers to taking the homogeneous component of this degree .",
    "the differential @xmath31 is induced by contracting interior edges in @xmath42 , which corresponds to replacing a neighborhood of a double point on a curve by a cylinder .",
    "our goal here is to look at the stable ( as @xmath5 ) cohomology  and rational homotopy type of the moduli space @xmath2 .",
    "the following result of pikaart @xcite gives a certain clue on what is going on within a `` stable range '' .",
    "[ pikaart ] the restriction mapping @xmath55 \\to \\linebreak[0 ] h^k({\\mathcal{m}_{g , n}})$ ] is surjective for @xmath56 .    for @xmath57 , the cohomology  of @xmath58 is nonzero only for @xmath59 , see figure  @xmath60 .",
    "= 1.5 in    by our construction of the spectral sequence , the natural composite mapping @xmath61 is the same as the restriction mapping @xmath62 .",
    "therefore , the @xmath63 columns of @xmath58 do not contribute to the cohomology  of the dg algebra @xmath64 in the stable range .",
    "the stable limit in cohomology  of the moduli spaces @xmath2 is achieved , roughly speaking , by gluing more and more handles to the complex curve .",
    "this yields an inductive system ( of isomorphisms ) on the level of cohomology .",
    "but since there is no natural mapping between the moduli spaces of different genera , one can not speak of a limiting rational homotopy type .",
    "the question of taking the limit of the dg algebras @xmath64 of section  [ mgn ] for @xmath2 may not be so obviously resolved , either , because these algebras are constructed out of the cohomology  of @xmath65 , @xmath66 running between 0 and @xmath3 .",
    "when @xmath67 , @xmath66 does not , and on top of that , taking the stable limit of cohomology  of @xmath11 requires a finer tuning , cf .",
    "pikaart @xcite .",
    "our plan here is to show that a @xmath1-minimal model of @xmath2 is independent of @xmath1 as long as @xmath0 . in particular , the limit of @xmath1-minimal models exists and may be called a `` @xmath1-minimal model of @xmath6 '' , continuing the abuse of notation adopted for cohomology . since a minimal model of a space",
    "may be obtained as a union of @xmath1-minimal models , we call this union a `` minimal model of @xmath6 '' . each of these @xmath1-minimal models is @xmath1-formal in a natural sense , see below , and the formality of @xmath6 follows .",
    "first of all , we recall basic notions on @xmath1-minimal models , see @xcite . from now on we will assume that our spaces and algebras are connected and simply connected , i.e. , their @xmath68 and @xmath69 . in application to moduli spaces , this is the case as long as @xmath70 , see harer @xcite .",
    "a dg algebra @xmath71 is called _ minimal _ if it is free as a dg commutative algebra , @xmath72 , and @xmath73 , where @xmath74 .",

    "@xmath75 , a morphism of dg algebras inducing an isomorphism on cohomology .",
    "every dg algebra @xmath64 has a minimal model , unique up to an isomorphism , which is in its turn unique up to homotopy .",
    "let @xmath76 be an integer .",
    "a @xmath1-_minimal model _ of a dg algebra @xmath64 is a minimal algebra @xmath77 generated by elements in degrees @xmath78 along with a morphism @xmath79 inducing an isomorphism on cohomology  in degrees @xmath78 and an injection in degree @xmath80 .",
    "a @xmath1-minimal model is unique up to an isomorphism uniquely defined up to homotopy .",
    "if one has an increasing sequence of embeddings @xmath81 together with morphisms @xmath79 compatible with each other , so that @xmath77 is a @xmath1-minimal model of @xmath64 , then the union @xmath82 along with the natural morphism @xmath75 is a minimal model of @xmath64 .",
    "we will call a dg algebra @xmath64 ( or a space whose rational homotopy type we consider ) _ formal _ if a minimal model @xmath71 of @xmath64 is isomorphic to a minimal model of its cohomology  @xmath83 taken with the zero differential .",
    "this is equivalent to saying that there is a quasi - isomorphism @xmath84 . in this case",
    "the rational homotopy type of @xmath64 ( or the space ) is determined by its rational cohomology  ring .",
    "formality implies that all massey products are zero .",
    "if the cohomology  algebra @xmath83 is free as a graded commutative algebra , then @xmath64 is formal ; see proposition  [ k - formal ] for a @xmath1-version of this statement .",
    "another example of a formal space is any compact khler manifold , a famous result of griffiths , deligne , morgan , and sullivan @xcite . we will similarly call a dg algebra @xmath64 or a space @xmath1-_formal _ , if @xmath1-minimal models of @xmath64 and its cohomology  are isomorphic .",
    "we also need to prove the following proposition establishing a particular case of @xmath1-formality .",
    "we say that a graded commutative algebra @xmath85 is _ @xmath1-free _ if there exists a graded vector space @xmath86 and a mapping @xmath87 of graded vector spaces defining a morphism @xmath88 of graded algebras , where @xmath89 is the free dg commutative algebra on @xmath90 , which is an isomorphism in degrees @xmath78 and an injection in degree @xmath80 .",
    "[ k - formal ] suppose that the cohomology  @xmath83 of a dg algebra @xmath64 is @xmath1-free , based on a graded vector space @xmath90 .",

    "if @xmath83 is @xmath1-free , then there exists a linear injection @xmath91 .",
    "pick a linear mapping @xmath92 which takes each element @xmath45 of @xmath90 to a cocycle representing the cohomology  class @xmath93 .",
    "then the natural morphism of graded commutative algebras @xmath94 obviously respects the differentials and satisfies the axioms of a @xmath1-minimal model of @xmath64 . by assumption , @xmath89 is at the same time a @xmath1-minimal model of @xmath83 , whence @xmath1-formality of @xmath64 .      1 .",
