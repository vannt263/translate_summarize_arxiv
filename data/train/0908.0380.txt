    "near infinity , there is a conformal change of coordinates which conjugates @xmath2 to @xmath99 .",
    "the local conjugating isomorphism is unique up to multiplication by a @xmath100st root of unity and is therefore uniquely determined if required to have derivative 1 at infinity ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",

    "this ray can be extended uniquely to all radii @xmath110 provided that when flowing downward , the trajectory does not meet any of the critical points of @xmath16 , i.e. critical points of @xmath2 or any of their iterated inverse images .",

    "thus , given an element of @xmath12 , together with a choice of fixed external ray , there is a unique such identification sending this chosen fixed external ray to the external ray whose asymptotic argument is zero .",
    "the following two lemmas have nothing to do with dynamics and will be used in the proof of the connectedness and compactness of the space of local models (  [ spaces of local models ] ) .",
