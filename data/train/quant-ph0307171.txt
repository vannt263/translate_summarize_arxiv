    "[ pappa2 ] this result can be formalized by showing that for any separable state @xmath28 one has @xmath92 analogously to the case of the operators ( [ ppoi ] ) , also here it is possible to identify a minimum number of elements necessary to produce a nontrivial minimal uncertainty for separable states . in the case of the operators @xmath4 , @xmath20 and @xmath65",

    "such a minimum number is three since there are examples of separable states that diagonalize any two of them .",
