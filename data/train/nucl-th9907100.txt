    "in this work we attempt to calculate the populations of various isotopes of boron , carbon and nitrogen that were measured in a number of experiments at the nscl - msu facility[1 - 2 ] .",
    "the calculation proceeds in two stages . in the first",
    ", primary populations are calculated in a two - component statistical model .",
    "the calculations in the first part are exact although numerical .",
    "these populations are both in particle stable and unstable states . in the second stage",
    "the particle unstable states are allowed to decay .",
    "this is done in a weisskopf formalism .",
    "exact calculations are very long and some approximations had to be introduced . these approximations will be discussed .",
    "after the decays , the populations are compared with experiments .",
    "one motivation for this calculation was that it serves as an application of the two - component statistical model where an exact calculation can be done .",
    "this , therefore , could serve as a benchmark of how far one can trust the predictions of the model .",
    "unfortunately , the particular predictions we are looking for are also affected by the subsequent decays .",
    "this effect is not small .",
    "hence , the predictions are the result of the combination of two models which had to be applied in tandem before experimental data could be compared .",
    "a recent application of the two - component model was the computation of the caloric curve @xcite in nuclei .",
    "the sections are organised as follows .",
    "section ii gives a brief description of the two - component statistical model .",
    "after presenting , in section iii , in words and simple formulae , the overview of the secondary decay calculation , we present in section iv the formalism that we use to model secondary decay . in section",
    "v we present some calculational details , section vi presents the results of the calculation .",
    "summary and conclusion are presented in section vii .",
    "a short appendix of the more complicated formulae are presented in section viii .",
    "for completeness , we present here the essential details of the two - component statistical model .",
    "the one component model was described elsewhere @xcite .",
    "the formalism of the two - component model can also be found in @xcite    assume that the system which breaks up after two heavy ions hit each other can be desribed as a hot , equilibrated nuclear system characterised by a temperature @xmath0 and a freeze - out volume @xmath1 within which there are @xmath2 nucleons ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "the partition function of the system is given by    @xmath4    here @xmath5 is the number of composites with proton number @xmath6 and neutron number @xmath7 , and @xmath8 is the partition function of a single composite with proton , neutron numbers @xmath9 respectively .",
    "there are two constraints : @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "these constraints would appear to make the computation of @xmath12 prohibitively difficult , but a recursion relation exists @xcite which allows numerical computation of @xmath12 quite easy even for large @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "three equivalent recursion relations exist , any one of which could be used .",
    "for example , one such relation is    @xmath15    all nuclear properties are contained in @xmath8 .",
    "it is given by    @xmath16    here @xmath17 is the free volume within which the particles move ; @xmath17 is related to @xmath1 through @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the excluded volume due to finite sizes of composites .",
    "we take @xmath17 to be a variable of the calculation , it is set to be equal to @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the normal volume for @xmath22 nucleons , @xmath23 is then varied to obtain the best fit with experimental data .",
    "the quantity @xmath24 is the internal partition function of the composite .",
    "@xmath25    where the summation on the right hand side is the contribution from the discrete spectrum(the cut - off @xmath26 is simply the highest energy level that has been resolved for the given nucleus and is available from data tables ) ; and @xmath27 is the contribution from the continuum . without loss of generality we can write    @xmath28    where we have used the abbreviation @xmath29 , to stand for both @xmath6 and @xmath7 ; @xmath30 is usually partly discrete and partly continuous .",
    "we will need both @xmath31 and @xmath30 .",
    "volumes of work are available on @xmath30 .",
    "this is dealt with in detail in appendix 2b of @xcite .",
    "the saddle - point approximation for the density of states assuming a fermi - gas model is ( see eq .",
    "2b-14 in @xcite )    @xmath32    for explanations of how @xmath33 and @xmath34 are to be chosen see @xcite . in the fermi - gas model",
    "the quantity which is exponentiated is simply the total entropy @xmath35 .",
    "thus the density of states is given by a familiar expression @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the pre - factor .",
    "approximate values of @xmath37 are known provided one does not have to concern with very low value of @xmath38 ( which we do need ) . at temperatures",
    "we will be concerned with , @xmath39 in the fermi - gas model is given quite accurately by @xmath40 $ ] .",
    "in the bulk of this paper we adopt this prescription . for upto @xmath41",
    "we write the density of state as @xmath42 , where the low temperature fermi - gas expression for @xmath43 as written above is used .",
    "the energy independent value of the pre - factor is fixed from experimentally known levels :    @xmath44    while objections can be raised against this procedure , it achieves three objectives which we wanted to have : ( a ) we did not want to lose all information of the experimentally measured discrete excited states ; ( b ) we did want to take into account the contribution from the continuum and ( c ) with this procedure calculations are fairly simple . although , we will not report on all other formulae for density of states that we also used , our final results for the isotope populations are quite stable within reasonable variations that were tried .",
    "we estimate the continuum contribution as a similar integral from @xmath26 to infinity .",
    "@xmath45    this process is continued upto @xmath41 wherein we can read off energy levels from data tables . for elements above @xmath41 , a parametrised version was used , which is given as    @xmath46 } \\label{qint}\\ ] ]    where @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "the first four terms in the right hand side of equation([qint ] ) arise from a parametrised version of the binding energy of the ground state .",
    "the last term arises from an approximation to the fermi - gas formula for level density .",
    "this was also used in @xcite . for protons and",
    "neutrons @xmath52 is 1 .",
    "the average number of particles of a composite is given by    @xmath53    however , this population is partly over particle stable states and partly over particle unstable states which will decay into other nuclei before reaching the detectors .",
    "in keeping with the way experimental data are presented , we will compute ratios of yields of different isotopes of boron , carbon , and nitrogen .",
    "to lowest order one can consider the @xmath54 obtained from equation ( [ primary ] ) above , remove the particle unstable fractions , and compare them directly with experiment .",
    "this is shown in the figures as the dotted line with a filled triangle plotting symbol .",
    "these populations contain only particle stable states .",
    "next we consider decay of the particle unstable states . we restrict the secondary decay to be due to emission of six species : neutron , proton , deuteron , @xmath55he , triton , and alpha particles .",
    "any given nucleus @xmath56 from a particle unstable state can in principle go to at most six other nuclei . as the populations are canonically distributed among the various energy levels",
    ", we can calculate the fraction that are in particle stable or unstable states .",
    "if the fraction of nuclei @xmath56 at the first stage in unstable states is @xmath57 , then the number of nuclei @xmath56 left in particle stable states at the stage we call ` upto single decay ' is given by    @xmath58    where @xmath59 is the fraction of the once decayed nuclei in unstable states .",
    "we will indicate how to calculate @xmath59 in the next section .",
    "@xmath60 is the width for emission by @xmath61 from @xmath62 and @xmath63 is the total width .",
    "we can then take these revised populations @xmath64 and again compute the ratios .",
    "we label these ` upto single decay ' .",
    "these are reported in the plots as the small dashed line with the diamond plotting symbol .",
    "note : this is just the stable fraction of the population after one stage of decay , the actual population is possibly greater .",
    "after the first decay there may be some fraction in particle unstable states .",
    "these can decay , thereby , changing the population of @xmath56 to @xmath65 .",
    "if we take the ratios now we get what we call ` upto double decay ' , this is denoted by the dot@xmath66dashed line and the square plotting symbol .",
    "again at this stage the @xmath67 represent only the sum of the stable fractions of the populations obtained from the initial distribution , single and double decays .",
    "it is clear the procedure can be continued .",
    "the fraction remaining in particle unstable states will continue to decrease .",
    "we found no significant difference between the ` upto triple decay ' and the ` upto quadruple decay ' calculation .",
    "thus we do not continue beyond .",
    "once again it should be noted that all the plotted populations , @xmath54 , @xmath64 , @xmath67 , @xmath68 etc .",
    ", quote only the stable fractions at freezeout , after single , double , and triple decay respectively .",
    "the formalism for the decay calculation is given in the next section , there the quantities @xmath69 , @xmath60 will be calculated in somewhat greater detail .",
    "the reader who is only interested in the final results could jump to sections vi and vii .",
    "as the heated clusters stream out from the hot source , many of them will be in particle unstable states , these will decay by particle emission , for example , by emitting a neutron , proton , @xmath70 particle etc .",
    "they will then leave a residue nucleus which may be particle stable or unstable ; if it is unstable then it will decay further into another isotope and this process will continue till the residue is produced in a particle stable state .",
    "the primary calculation assumes that thermal equilibrium is achieved at freezeout ; if this is true then the number of composites with @xmath6 protons and @xmath7 neutrons with an energy in the interval @xmath38 and @xmath71 is given by the canonical factor    @xmath72    where we have abbreviated @xmath2 to mean @xmath56 , and @xmath73 , from section ii .",
    ", is given as @xmath74 .",
    "the multiplicative constant @xmath75 will , henceforth , be absorbed into the overall normalization constant @xmath76 .",
    "thus from now on the density function is given simply as    @xmath77   \\label{dens}\\ ] ]    @xmath76 is a normalization constant such that    @xmath78    now of the various levels in a particular nucleus , some will be at a very low energy and as a result will be stable to any form of particle decay .",
    "those that lie above an energy    @xmath79    will in general be unstable to decay via emission of a particle @xmath80 ( i.e. , a particle with neutron number @xmath81 and proton number @xmath82 ) , where @xmath83 is the mass of the particle , @xmath84 is the mass of the decaying nucleus @xmath56 , @xmath85 is the mass of the residue left over after decay and @xmath86 is the coulomb barrier for that particle .",
    "note that @xmath80 could represent a variety of particles ; in this note we will consider ` six ' such particles , as mentioned in the introduction .    as is evident from equation ( [ exy ] ) ,",
    "different particle decays have different energy thresholds .",
    "consider an isotope @xmath56 , as an example let us take @xmath87 @xmath88 .",
    "as we start from the ground state level and move upwards , we will encounter different thresholds .",
    "the lowest will be the @xmath89 decay threshold at an energy @xmath90 ( in @xmath87 it is at @xmath91 approximately ) , the next higher threshold is for proton decay at @xmath92 ( in @xmath87 it is at @xmath93 approximately ) , and so on ; we will get different thresholds one after the other ( note : the order of different thresholds is different for different isotopes ) .",
    "all nuclei of type @xmath56 which are formed between the ground state and the lowest threshold @xmath94 , will remain as isotopes @xmath56 , this number is given by    @xmath95    those that are formed between @xmath94 and the next threshold @xmath96 , will all completely decay by @xmath89 emission , and these nuclei will then appear as nuclei of type @xmath97 and must be added on to the population of isotope @xmath97 .",
    "then , those nuclei of type @xmath56 which are formed between @xmath96 and the next threshold @xmath98 , will decay both by @xmath89 emission and by proton emission . in the next zone",
    "there will be three kinds of decay , and so on .",
    "we now ask , how many of the initial nuclei formed in a particular zone will decay by each of the channels that are available , and how many of the residues formed will be stable or unstable ?    to answer the above questions : we start by writing down the number of particles of type @xmath80 with energy between @xmath99 that are emitted , in a time interval between @xmath100 and @xmath101 , by nuclei of type @xmath56 , lying between an energy @xmath102 , leaving behind a residue nucleus @xmath103 ( we may alternatively refer to @xmath80 , @xmath56 , and @xmath103 by simply their mass numbers @xmath104 , @xmath2 and @xmath105 where @xmath106 , @xmath29 and @xmath107 )    @xmath108    where @xmath109 is the number of nuclei of type @xmath56 initially formed at an energy @xmath102 which are still left undecayed after a time @xmath100 , given by    @xmath110    and @xmath111 is the weisskopf decay probability per unit time @xcite given by the expression    @xmath112 } \\frac { \\rho_{b}(e - b_{a } - \\varepsilon ) \\rho_{b}^{0 } } {   \\rho_{a}(e ) \\rho_{a}^{0 } } \\label{wisko}\\ ] ]    in equation ( [ decay1 ] ) , @xmath113 is the the total decay probability per unit time from an energy level @xmath38 of the isotope @xmath2 . in equation ( [ wisko ] ) , @xmath114 is the spin degeneracy factor of the emitted particle , @xmath115 is a constant of a particular decay @xcite , given by    @xmath116    where @xmath117 is the mass of a nucleon . in equation ( [ wisko ] ) ,",

    "following the prescription of friedmann and lynch @xcite , @xmath122 is given by    @xmath123r_{0 } & \\mbox { , for $ a \\geq 2 $ } \\\\    r_{0}(a-1)^{1/3 } & \\mbox { , for $ a=1 $ } \\end{array }   \\right.\\ ] ]    where @xmath124 .",
    "in equation ( [ cros ] ) , @xmath1 is the coulomb barrier for the formation of a from b and @xmath104 . again following @xcite ,",
    "this is written in the touching sphere approximation as    @xmath125    where @xmath126 . also in equation ( [ wisko ] ) , @xmath127 , @xmath128 are the respective density of states of the two nuclei .",
    "they have the same form as in equation ( [ dens ] ) .",
    "also @xmath75 and @xmath129 are the respective multiplicative constants for the density of states , as mentioned in section(ii ) .",
    "we note that @xmath130 in equation ( [ num1 ] ) is also equal to the number of nuclei that were initially formed as nuclei of type @xmath2 at an energy between @xmath38 and @xmath71 , and then decayed into nuclei @xmath105 with an excitation energy of @xmath131 . to get the total number of states that decayed from a level @xmath38 by emission of a particle of any allowed energy , we integrate over @xmath132 from its minimum value @xmath133 to its maximum value @xmath134 , and",

    "thus we break up the integration into @xmath150 zones , corresponding to the @xmath150 real decay zones , and integrate within each zone independently . note that the last zone extends from @xmath151 to @xmath152 , and is thus considerably larger than the other zones",
    "however , at the low temperatures that will be encountered , this zone will be sparsely populated .",
    "thus the following approximation is valid . within each zone , with an energy from @xmath153 to @xmath154 , the integral can be replaced by a mean value expression ,    @xmath155    where @xmath156 is the mean number of nuclei of type @xmath56 ( or @xmath2 ) that were initially formed at an energy between @xmath153 and @xmath154 , and decayed by the @xmath80 ( or @xmath104 ) channel . in the above equation    @xmath157    of course , the left hand side is zero if channel @xmath104 is not open in the region @xmath153 to @xmath154 .",
    "the mean decay rate over all channels is    @xmath158    and    @xmath159    thus by summing up all the contributions from the six different zones , we get the total number of nuclei that have decayed from isotope @xmath2 by the @xmath104 channel as    @xmath160    to find out how many of these have decayed to stable isotopes , we must first calculate from equation ( [ num1 ] ) the stable decay rate @xmath161 .",
    "two cases emerge in this calculation . if @xmath162 , @xmath161 is obtained by integrating over @xmath132 , from @xmath163 to its maximum value @xmath164 , where @xmath165 is the stable level or the lowest threshold @xmath94 of the residue nucleus @xmath105 above which @xmath105 is unstable .",
    "the expression for @xmath161 is obtained from that of @xmath166 in equation ( 18 ) by replacing @xmath167 . if @xmath168 , then @xmath169 .",
    "then , following a similar procedure as above for @xmath170 , we get the total number of nuclei @xmath2 ( or @xmath56 ) lying in an energy range between @xmath171 , that decay by the @xmath104 channel to a stable state as    @xmath172    the unstable decay rate from a particular level or zone is the probability of a decay per unit time from @xmath2 to an unstable level or levels of @xmath105 from which further decay can take place .",
    "it is easy to see that they are given simply as the difference of the total decay rate and the stable decay rate i.e. ,    @xmath173    the derivations and expressions for the full decay rates are given in the appendix .",
    "after a decay has taken place ( @xmath174 ) , we ask what is the population distribution of the residue as a function of its energy ( @xmath175 ) .",
    "this can , in principle , be calculated from equation([num1 ] ) by integrating over @xmath38 and @xmath132 , such that @xmath176 , the energy of the residue , is a constant .",
    "first we make a change of variables from @xmath177 to @xmath178 and then integrate over @xmath38 only .",
    "we get    @xmath179    this integration is quite involved .",
    "we assume that the residue population is canonically distributed , but with a new temperature @xmath180 i.e. ,    @xmath181    there are two unknowns in this formula , the new temperature @xmath180 and the overall normalization constant @xmath182 . to find these two constants",
    "we will impose that the total population of this interim stage ( i.e. @xmath183 ) , and the mean energy of the distribution @xmath184 , be reproduced by this new temperature .",

    "we can now proceed with further decays following the same procedure as before with decay occurring from a canonically distributed population at a temperature @xmath180 .",
    "we can thus model an n@xmath66step decay process by assuming that at each intermediate stage the population is canonically distributed with a new temperature and overall normalization constant .",
    "the decay rates to the next stage are calculated with the new temperature .",
    "following this , the fraction of the population that decays through a particular channel , and the mean energy of the resultant residue nucleus , are calculated .",
    "these are then used to secure the temperature and normalization constant of the next stage of decay .",
    "this process will continue till the fraction of decay to particle unstable states becomes negligible .",
    "from the primary calculation we obtain that @xmath200 nuclei of type @xmath56 ( or @xmath2 ) are formed from the initial multifragmentation",
    ". the population @xmath200 is distributed canonically among the various energy levels as demonstrated by equation([canon ] ) .",
    "if a particular nucleus is at a sufficiently excited state then it will emit a particle @xmath80 ( or @xmath104 ) and leave a residue @xmath201 ( or @xmath105 ) , which may again decay by emitting a particle @xmath202 ( or @xmath203 ) leaving a nucleus @xmath204 ( or @xmath205 ) , and so on untill it finally reaches a nucleus @xmath206 ( or @xmath13 ) in a stable state .",

    "is given simply by equation([stbpop ] ) as    @xmath208    the number of nuclei initially formed as @xmath56 which decay to @xmath209 is given as    @xmath210    the mean energy of the newly formed residue nucleus is given by    @xmath211    we assume that this population is canonically distributed from an excitation energy of @xmath212 to @xmath145 with a new temperature @xmath180 ( equation [ canres ] ) .",

    "we can then calculate the number of nuclei that initially started out as @xmath2 s and finally ended up as ` stable ' @xmath105 s as    @xmath216    note that in the above equation @xmath217 and @xmath218 are the density of states and lowest decay threshold for the nucleus of type @xmath201 .",
    "this number can also be calculated directly by using the stable decay rates ( equation([sdert ] ) )    @xmath219    the second equation is more correct as it does not depend on the assumption that the residue is canonically distributed .",
    "a comparison of the @xmath220 obtained from the above two equations gives an estimate of the error involved in the assumption of a canonically distributed residue population .",
    "now we ask , what is the number of nuclei of the b s just formed which will decay by emitting a particle @xmath203 to a nucleus of type @xmath205 ; this is calculated simply as    @xmath221    the decay rates in the above equation are calculated with the temperature @xmath180 .",
    "we then calculate the mean energy @xmath222 of the new distribution as    @xmath223    using these , we continue the process on , by again calculating the temperature and norm of a canonical distribution , which when summed from excitation energy @xmath224 to @xmath145 is equal to @xmath225 , and whose mean energy is equal to @xmath226 .",

    "the method of calculation is simple , first we calculate the primary populations of the isotopes using equation([primary ] ) .",
    "we then remove the unstable fraction of the population , and quote only the stable part .",
    "this is denoted by the dotted line and triangle plotting symbol .",

    "` upto triple decay ' and ` upto quadruple decay ' we stop after ` quadruple decay ' .    to fit with experimental data , we have four parameters to tune , the obvious ones being the initial temperature @xmath230 or @xmath0 , the free volume @xmath231 of the primary calculation , the ratio @xmath232 ( as one does not know how much loss due to pre@xmath66equilibrium emission has taken place ) and an overall multiplicative constant @xmath233 ( as we do not know how many nuclei collided in the experiment ) .",
    "the plots are noted to be most sensitive to @xmath230 and @xmath232 .",
    "thus in fitting the data we first set particular values of @xmath230 and @xmath232 , and calculate the multiplicities at all stages of decay ( @xmath231 is varied to get the best possible fit at this temperature and @xmath232 ) .",
    "we then multiply all the multiplicities by an appropriate @xmath233 and take the logarithm .",
    "these are then plotted and compared with @xmath234 obtained from the experiment .",
    "we then vary @xmath230 , @xmath232 and repeat the above procedure till a good fit is obtained .",
    "we present fits for three different temperatures , and different @xmath232 for each temperature .",
    "@xmath231 and @xmath233 are set to obtain the best fit possible for a given @xmath230 and @xmath232 .",
    "we note that the @xmath235 system is one with @xmath236 and @xmath237 thus @xmath238 .",
    "the authors of @xcite state that some pre - equilibrium emission may have taken place . as we do not know what proportion of neutrons and protons",
    "are lost in such a process , we start the calculation with the same @xmath232 as the @xmath235 system .",
    "we start with a @xmath239 and @xmath238 i.e. @xmath240 .",
    "we start the calculation with a low temperature of @xmath241 in figure([fig1 ] ) ( @xmath231 and @xmath233 are varied to get the best fit ) .",
    "we note that overall there is a slight excess of the heavier nirogen isotopes as compared to data and a deficit of the lighter boron isotopes , this implies that the temperature is too low and enough of the light isotopes are not being formed .",
    "we proceed by raising the temperature to @xmath242 , maintaining the same @xmath232 . by now varying @xmath231 and @xmath233",
    "we find an excellent fit with the data ( figure([fig2 ] ) ) .",
    "one may ask at this point , if there is more than one set of parameters which fits the data well . to answer this question we increase , first , the temperature to @xmath243 , maintain the same @xmath232 and redo the calculation . we get a bad fit ( figure([fig3 ] ) ) .",
    "there is an over all deficit in the nitrogen population and an excess in the boron population .",
    "also we note that within a particular @xmath13 there is a deficit in the neutron rich isotopes .",
    "we try to remedy this situation by increasing the @xmath232 ratio .",
    "the best fit at this temperature is obtained at an @xmath244 ( figure([fig4 ] ) ) , but we still obtain an overal deficit in the nitrogen population ; the carbon fit is good , but there still remains an excess in the boron isotopes especially in the neutron rich isotopes .    on inspection of the fits ( figures ( [ fig1 ] ) to ( [ fig4 ] ) ) , we note that the best fit is obtained at figure([fig2 ] ) . in this fit @xmath245 , @xmath246 , @xmath247 , and @xmath248 . in this figure",
    "we note that , for the boron populations we get an excellent agreement with the data . in this case",
    "there seems to be little change after single decay . for the carbon isotopes",
    "the agreement is good . for nitrogen",
    ", we have a good fit except for the case of @xmath249 .",
    "another property of the fits noticed is that they do not seem to depend on @xmath2 and @xmath13 independently but rather on the ratio @xmath232 . as a demonstration of this , we plot in figure([fig9 ] )",
    "a fit for @xmath250 and @xmath237 ( i.e. , @xmath251 ) .",
    "we note that we are able to obtain a fit very similar to fig.[fig2 ] , with the same temperature and @xmath252 as in fig.[fig2 ] , but with a slightly lower @xmath233 .",
    "this is very much expected , as in this case each source has a larger number of nucleons than before .",
    "in this note we have presented a secondary decay formalism and performed calculations to fit the populations of various isotopes measured in @xcite .",
    "we obtain very good fits ( fig.[fig2 ] ) with experiment for the boron and carbon isotopes . in the nitrogen isotopes ,",
    "we obtain a good fit except for the case of @xmath249 .",
    "no particular reason could be found for this , but let us go over several approximations ( introduced to keep the calculation at a resonably simple level ) which may have contributed .",
    "actual energy levels from data tables were used only upto @xmath253 ( equation ( [ qreal ] ) ) for the primary populations . for higher masses ,",
    "the emperical mass formula ( equation ( [ qint ] ) ) was used .",
    "the secondary decay is very approximate , instead of calculating decay level to level , we have blurred out such details by using a smoothed level density .    for the capture cros - section ( equation([cros ] ) ) , we have used a simple semiclassical formula , assuming that all nuclei are spherically symmetric which is definitely not true . a more precise calculation involving level to level decay",
    "would use a more accurate expression for the cros - sections e.g. , the hauser@xmath66feshbach formalism @xcite @xcite .",
    "still another problem lies in the assumption made in calculating the effects of higher order decay , that the interim populations can be taken to be canonically distributed .",
    "this is true only in first order decay , thus making the higher order contributions subject to some error .",
    "there is also an experimental problem according to the authors of @xcite , the angular distributions were forward peaked , indicating significant emission prior to attainment of thermodynamic equilibrium .",
    "such an emission could affect the populations of the various isotopes .",
    "no doubt , incorporating changes to correct the above mentioned problems will improove the accuracy of the calculation .",
    "however , such changes may make the expressions analytically intractible and one would have to resort to numerical means .",
    "this may slow down the calculation considerably .",
    "the calculations presented in this note take minimal computer time .",
    "inspite of the shortcomings of the calculation presented above , this still remains a good test of the two component statistical model , and shows that such a model can definintely be used to explain certain experimental data quite accurately .",
    "the authors wish to thank c. gale , w. g. lynch , m. b. tsang , s. pratt and n. de takacsy for helpful discussions .",
