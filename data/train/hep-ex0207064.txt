    "the ckm matrix element @xmath13  is the coupling between the bottom and up quarks , and is therefore a fundamental parameter in the standard model .",
    "its value is relevant to studies of flavor - changing currents , including the rates of @xmath0 and @xmath14 mixing and cp violation in the mixing and decays of @xmath0 hadrons .",
    "recent theoretical progress in charmless semileptonic @xmath0 decays using heavy quark effective theory ( hqet ) and the operator product expansion ( ope ) @xcite has made possible new levels of precision in the measurement of @xmath13@xcite .",
    "the calculations relate @xmath13  to the partial branching fraction of @xmath12  in a restricted region of phase space in which @xmath11  does not contribute .",
    "the region of phase space most accessible to experiment is the lepton energy endpoint , @xmath15 .",
    "this region was used in the first measurement of @xmath12  establishing a non - zero value of @xmath13@xcite .",
    "unfortunately the ope calculation is not valid in the very restricted region of phase space delineated by this lepton energy cut .",
    "a recent cleo measurement has used a spectral function measured in @xmath16  to obtain the normalization factor which relates the measured partial branching fraction in the lepton endpoint region to @xmath13@xcite .",
    "another method is to replace the lepton energy cut with a cut on the invariant mass of the lepton pair@xcite , @xmath17 , or on the mass of the recoiling hadronic system , @xmath18 , to exclude @xmath11  events .",
    "recent theoretical work suggests that a combination of cuts on both @xmath17  and @xmath18  yields the smallest uncertainty@xcite .",
    "in this paper we report an analysis of @xmath19  decays in which both the charged lepton and the neutrino are reconstructed .",
    "the neutrino is reconstructed using the approximate hermeticity of the cleo ii and cleo ii.v detectors and the well known initial state of the @xmath2 system produced by the cornell electron storage ring ( cesr ) .",
    "the @xmath17  kinematic variable is then calculated directly , and the @xmath18  kinematic variable can be calculated if the @xmath0 momentum , @xmath20 , is known , @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the sum of the charged lepton and neutrino momenta and @xmath23 is the angle between @xmath22 and the @xmath0 momentum direction .",
    "since the @xmath0 mesons are the daughters of an @xmath3 produced at rest , the magnitude of the @xmath0 momentum is known and small , however its direction is unmeasured .",
    "the last term in the @xmath24  equation depends on the @xmath0 momentum direction , and is small , unmeasured , and neglected in this analysis . from the lepton pair sample",
    ", the differential decay rate is measured as a function of the reconstructed quantities @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath25 . the experimental resolution on the neutrino four - momentum is poor , with a narrow core of approximately 120 mev and broad tail of over - estimation of the neutrino energy which extends up to 1.5 gev .",
    "the resulting resolution on @xmath17  and @xmath18   is also poor , so it is not possible to cleanly isolate @xmath12  events with cuts on these variables .",
    "instead , we fit this observed distribution to a sum of models for the different hadronic final states : @xmath26 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 non - resonant , and @xmath27 . from the fit results we infer the partial branching fraction over a region of phase space with high @xmath17  and low @xmath18 .",
    "these partial branching fractions are related to @xmath13  by theoretical calculations whose uncertainty has been estimated @xcite .",
    "the data were accumulated with two configurations of the cleo detector @xcite , cleo ii and cleo ii.v , with an integrated luminosity of @xmath1 taken on the @xmath3 resonance and an additional @xmath28 taken off resonance , just below the @xmath29  production threshold .",
    "both configurations cover 95% of the 4@xmath30 solid angle with drift chambers and a cesium iodide calorimeter .",
    "in addition there are muon chambers with measurements made at 3 , 5 , and 7 hadronic interaction lengths of iron and a time of flight system which augments the particle i d information from specific ionization ( @xmath31 ) . in the the cleo ii configuration , there were three concentric drift chambers filled with a mixture of argon and ethane . in the cleo ii.v detector ,",
    "the innermost tracking chamber was replaced with a three layer silicon detector and the drift chamber gas was changed to a mixture of helium and propane .",
    "events are selected to have an electron or muon with momentum greater than 1 gev/@xmath32 and a well reconstructed neutrino .",
    "additional cuts are used to suppress background events from the @xmath33 continuum .",
    "the leptons are selected to fall within the barrel region of the detector ( @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is the angle between the lepton momentum and the beam axis ) .",
    "electrons are selected based on @xmath36 , @xmath31 , and time of flight information combined using a likelihood technique .",
    "muons are identified by requiring a penetration of 3 interaction lengths of iron for muons less than 1.5 gev/@xmath32 and 5 interaction lengths for muons greater than 1.5 gev/@xmath32 .",
    "the absolute lepton identification efficiencies are calculated by embedding leptons from radiative qed events into hadronic events .",
    "the rate at which pions and kaons fake leptons is measured by reconstructing @xmath37 , @xmath38 , and @xmath39 without using particle identification and then checking daughter particle lepton identification signatures .",
    "neutrinos are reconstructed by subtracting all observed track and neutral shower four - momenta from the four - momentum of the @xmath40 initial state which is at rest in the laboratory , @xmath41 the errors made in this assumption are due to particles lost through inefficiency or acceptance , fake tracks and showers , and other undetected particles such as second neutrinos , @xmath42 s , or neutrons .",
    "several cuts are made to select events in which these effects are reduced and the neutrino four - momentum resolution is correspondingly enhanced . since extra neutrinos are correlated with extra leptons , events with a lepton beyond the signal lepton in the event are rejected .    the primary source of fake tracks is from charged particles which do not have sufficient transverse momentum , @xmath43 , to reach the calorimeter and therefore curl multiple times in the tracking chambers .",
    "the portions of the track after the initial outbound section may accidentally be called a second track .",
    "criteria have been developed to identify such errors and make a best estimate of the actual charged particles in the event .",
    "events for which the total charge of the tracks is not zero are removed , reducing the effect of lost or fake tracks .",
    "showers in the calorimeter associated with tracks in the drift chamber are removed , so as not to double count their energy .",
    "the association between tracks and showers has been refined to take into account secondary hadronic showers which can appear to be showers isolated from tracks .",
    "finally a requirement is made that the ratio of the reconstructed neutrino four - momentum divided by twice the reconstructed neutrino energy be less than 0.35 gev , @xmath44 gev .",
    "this quantity is constructed to be proportional to the energy of a lost or fake particle .",
    "the reconstructed neutrino s energy is assigned to be the magnitude of the momentum , because the momentum is not dependent on the particle identification of the tracks and so has a better resolution than the direct energy measurement .",
    "continuum events are suppressed by a combination of event shape and orientation variables which exploit the fact that continuum events tend to be jet - like and aligned with the beam axis , whereas @xmath29  events are more spherical and their orientation is uniformly distributed in the detector .",
    "the second fox - wolfram moment @xcite , r2 , of the energy flow in the event is required to be less than 0.4 .",
    "in addition a neural network is used to combine r2 , the angle between the lepton and the thrust axis , the angle between the lepton and the beam axis , and the fraction of the energy lying in 9 separate cones around the lepton direction , which cover the full the @xmath45 solid angle .",
    "the r2 cut is more than 99% and 95% efficient for @xmath11  and @xmath12  respectively , while removing 60% of the continuum events .",
    "the neural net cut removes an additional 73% of the continuum background while keeping 92% and 94% of the @xmath11  and @xmath12   respectively .    after all cuts we observe 42333 events from cleo ii and 81368 events from cleo ii.v .",
    "the overall efficiency varies from 1.5% for @xmath11  non - resonant to 4.2% for @xmath12 .",
    "the full three dimensional differential decay rate distribution as a function of the reconstructed quantities @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath25  is fit for the contributions of the signals and backgrounds .",
    "the signals are @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath11   non - resonant , and @xmath12 .",
    "the backgrounds are events where the @xmath0 decay candidate is faked by a lepton from the process @xmath49 , a lepton from the @xmath33 continuum , or a fake lepton .",
    "we have the freedom to choose the kinematic variables used in the fit .",
    "we use @xmath50 , @xmath18 , and @xmath51 .",
    "the helicity angle of the virtual @xmath52 , @xmath51 , is defined to be the angle between the lepton momentum in the @xmath52 frame and the @xmath52 in the lab frame .",
    "the fit variables have been chosen to minimize complexity of the phase space boundaries and cover the same kinematic space as @xmath17 , @xmath25 , and @xmath53 .",
    "we perform a binned maximum - likelihood fit where the probability distribution functions ( pdfs ) are constructed from weighted monte carlo or data events .",
    "the fit uses electrons and muons simultaneously , with a separate set of pdfs for the electrons and muons .",
    "the likelihood is implemented to take into account the pdf statistics using the method described in reference @xcite .",
    "the projections of the reconstructed quantities @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath51  of the various @xmath19   modes are shown in figure [ fig : btox ] .",
    "projections of the fit result are shown in figure [ fig : fitprojs ] .",
    "projections restricted to the region of enhanced @xmath12   sensitivity are shown in figure [ fig : btou ] .",
    "it should be noted that the correlations between the the three variables shown in the projections are fully included in the fit , and provide considerable power in distinguishing the contributions of the various components .",
    "the @xmath19   modes , secondary leptons and real leptons from continuum are simulated with cleo s geant based monte carlo .",
    "the @xmath46  and @xmath48  modes are modeled with isgw2 @xcite .",
    "the @xmath47  mode is modeled with hqet using cleo s previous measurement of the form factors @xcite .",
    "the @xmath8 non - resonant modes are modeled with a combination of the goity and roberts model@xcite and a crude model of @xmath54 . for an assessment of the @xmath11  model dependence ,",
    "the @xmath46  and @xmath47  form factors are varied within their experimentally allowed ranges , and the @xmath48  masses are varied in an ad - hoc manner . because very little is known about the @xmath8 non - resonant mass spectrum , it is reweighted drastically in the study of the @xmath11  model dependence . in a further study , each @xmath8 final state",
    "is constrained to a value away from the nominal fit result .",
    "the results of the variations are summed in quadrature .",
    "the modeling of the @xmath12   mode and the resulting model dependence is discussed in a later section .",
    "the fake leptons are modeled by taking a sample of tracks from data that are classified as @xmath30 , @xmath55 , or @xmath56 ( electrons and protons are not a significant source of fake leptons ) and unfolding their spectra to get the true spectra of @xmath30 , @xmath55 and @xmath56 , which are then multiplied by the measured fake rates . this models fake leptons from both @xmath29  and @xmath33 continuum .",
    "the real leptons from continuum are modeled with continuum monte carlo which has been tuned to replicate the appropriate charm spectra .",
    "charm is the source of most leptons from continuum .",
    "the models of both continuum and fakes have been validated and constrained by a comparison with the @xmath28 of off - resonance data .",
    "the secondary leptons are modeled with a convolution of cleo s measured charm spectra from @xmath29  events and delco results on the inclusive semileptonic decays of charm@xcite .",
    "the method of neutrino reconstruction adds a large amount of kinematic information to each event , however it also adds significant potential for systematic errors .",
    "the resolution on the neutrino kinematics is affected by the models of both the signal , the other @xmath0 in the event , and the detector response .",
    "the geant monte carlo does not perfectly simulate the track and shower efficiencies and fake rates , nor are @xmath0 decays well enough understood that the inclusive particle distributions are well known . for this analysis",
    "we employ a method of reweighting in order to quantify the effects of these uncertainties on our results .",
    "for example to study effect of the tracking efficiency uncertainty on result , the monte carlo events in which tracks are lost are given a higher or lower weight in constructing the pdfs and the fit is repeated .",
    "the scale of the variation made can in general be constrained by direct measurements of the quantity being varied .",
    "one important example is that having a @xmath42 in the event adds a tail to the neutrino resolution .",
    "the inclusive @xmath57 spectrum in @xmath29  events has been measured and can be used to constrain the @xmath42 spectrum .",
    "we use calculations based on hqet and the ope to extract @xmath13  from the @xmath12  rate in restricted regions of phase space .",
    "this is a well controlled expansion and the theoretical uncertainties have been assessed by several authors @xcite .",
    "however , the fit s region of sensitivity does not coincide with these regions , and , as previously mentioned , it is not possible to make cuts to isolate these regions , because of the poor resolution on the neutrino four - vector and hence @xmath17  and @xmath24 . in order to calculate @xmath13 ,",
    "we first make a model dependent inference of the partial branching fraction in a region , and then apply the hqet and ope calculations .",
    "this prescription is designed to minimize the reliance on models and instead rely on the controlled expansion in hqet and ope calculations .",
    "@xmath12  models are used for two purposes in this analysis .",
    "the first is in the simulation of the efficiency and resolution of the detector .",
    "this can not be done with the hqet and ope calculations , because they do not predict specific hadronic final states .",
    "the second use of models is to extrapolate and interpolate between the regions of high sensitivity to @xmath12  and regions of interest for extracting @xmath13 .",
    "the fit is primarily sensitive to low @xmath24  and high @xmath17 , but within this region the sensitivity is strongly biased toward the lepton energy end - point , hence the models are relied on to extrapolate to the full range of lepton energies .",
    "the result of the fit is the fraction of @xmath12  events in the sample .",
    "this is converted into a branching fraction using the efficiency determined by monte carlo simulation and number of @xmath29s in the sample .",
    "the @xmath12  portion of the fit is driven by the region of phase space where the @xmath11  contribution is not overwhelming , however the fit extrapolates from this region to the full space using the models .",
    "this results in a very large model dependence for the total rate .",
    "the effect can be reduced by calculating for each model a fraction , @xmath58 , of events in a region of enhanced @xmath12  sensitivity .",
    "the fractions , @xmath58 , are calculated from the model using the true @xmath17  and @xmath24 , not the reconstructed @xmath17  and @xmath24 .",
    "the product of the branching fraction from the fit result for a model and @xmath58 is the inferred partial branching fraction of @xmath12  for the model in region selected , @xmath59 @xmath60 has significantly less dependence on the model than the inferred full branching fraction , @xmath61 , however it still involves a model dependent combination of interpolation and extrapolation from the actual region of measurement .    the models used range across extremes from the isgw2 model to a model with only non - resonant modes .",
    "the isgw2 model contains only low mass hadronic resonances and no non - resonant or high mass hadronic systems .",
    "the purely non - resonant model implements the hqet and ope prediction for the hadronic mass spectrum based on the @xmath16spectral function , where the hadronic system is decayed via jetset .",
    "the true spectrum is likely somewhere between the extremes of all high mass non - resonant and all low mass resonances .",
    "two permutations of the all non - resonant model correspond to changing the spectral function parameters , @xmath62  and 1 within the bounds of the cleo measurement @xcite .",
    "another model combines isgw2 and some non - resonant events .",
    "in addition , the isgw2 model is reweighted to have a higher or lower @xmath51 , corresponding to more or less rate in the lepton end - point , or reweighted to have a harder or softer @xmath17  spectrum .",
    "table [ tab : btoutable ] shows the results for the total rate and the inferred partial branching fractions for five different regions .",
    "the central value of @xmath63 , reported in the first column of table [ tab : vubtable ] , is the center of the range of models , and the model dependence uncertainty is assigned to cover the full range .",
    "the fit results for the branching fractions of the final states containing charm agree with previous cleo measurements and will be reported in a subsequent paper",
    ".    in the context of hqet and the ope another fraction , @xmath64 , relates the partial branching fraction to @xmath13@xcite , @xmath65       \\left[\\frac{\\delta { \\cal b}_{\\rm region } } { .001 \\times f_{\\rm region}^{\\rm hqet } }   \\frac{1.6 { \\rm ps}}{\\tau_b } \\right]^{1/2}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the fractions , @xmath64 , for the five regions used have been calculated with an evaluation of the theoretical uncertainty by bauer _",
