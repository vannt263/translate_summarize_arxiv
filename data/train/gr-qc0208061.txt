    "there are two recent observational results that have had a profound implication in our current understanding of the universe , and consequently both results have triggered an intense activity in cosmology ; namely the confirmation that our universe is flat , and that it expands in an accelerated way . on one hand ,",
    "the observed location of the first acoustic peak of the temperature fluctuations on the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) corroborated by the data obtained by boomerang and maxima @xcite , favors a spatially flat universe and indicates that the universe is dominated by an unidentified `` dark energy '' . on the other hand ,",
    "direct evidences based upon measurements of luminosity - redshift relations for type ia supernovae , carried out independently by two groups @xcite , indicate that the universe is presently expanding in an accelerated way , and suggest that the unidentified dark energy has a negative pressure .",
    "this last characteristic of the dark energy points to the vacuum energy or cosmological constant as a possible candidate for dark energy .",
    "however , the energy scale related to the cosmological constant is @xmath4 orders of magnitude smaller than the energy of the vacuum originated at the planck time ( the cosmological constant problem ) @xcite .    the following natural attempt to shed light on",
    "the problem is to consider a dynamical `` cosmological constant '' related to a scalar field whose slowly varying energy density is able to mimic an effective cosmological constant .",
    "that scalar field has been called quintessence @xcite , and a mechanism similar to the inflation but at lower energy scale has been suggested for the scalar field .",
    "the energy density of such a scalar field must remain sub - dominant at early stages and must start dominating the universe in the recent past ( the cosmic coincidence problem ) , implying the requirement of specific evolution properties of the scalar field .    in the last few years , numerous quintessence models have been proposed ( see _ e.g. _ @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "most of these models assume minimally coupled scalar fields with different constraints and fine tuning of parameters for different types of potentials which model quintessence . in the context of general relativity ( gr ) plus a minimally coupled scalar field , the scalar field and the potential of these models",
    "should be appropriately restricted by different observational data in order to get the `` right '' potential which could play the role of an effective cosmological constant . in that case",
    ", the scalar field potential can be constructed if the luminosity distance ( as a function of red - shift ) can be known from observations .",
    "it is expected that the snap ( supernovae acceleration probe ) satellite will make accurate measurements of this parameter at a red - shift up to @xmath5 .",
    "this means that just the recent past of the universe will be probed and would be possible to construct just that corresponding part of the potential .",
    "minimally coupled self interacting scalar fields would be ruled out if the observational evidences point towards an equation of state with negative pressure for the dark energy .",
    "furthermore , the violation of the identity @xmath6 by models which assume minimally coupled scalar fields , and the characteristics of quintessence models mentioned above , enforce the idea of considering alternative theories where the scalar field is non - minimally coupled to gravity , like scalar - tensor theories ( stt ) .",
    "most of the attempts for using scalar - tensor theories have been done in the context of brans - dicke ( bd ) or some modified version of this theory @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite . in the case of models in bd",
    ", some drawbacks have been found , _",
    "e.g. _ , the difficulty for getting a transition from a decelerated expansion phase to an accelerated one ( the solutions obtained in bd are always accelerated , in contradiction with the results of big - bang nucleosynthesis ) .",
    "a way to avoid this problem has been proposed by other authors @xcite , using a modified version of bd theory by proposing the coupling parameter @xmath7 as a function of the scalar field @xmath8 .",
    "a main difficulty of this last type of models have been the implication of a small value for @xmath7 , in contradiction with bounds on @xmath7 obtained by solar system measurements .",
    "some other models have been proposed in the context of generalized scalar - tensor theories assuming different type of potentials ( _ see e.g. _",
    "@xcite ) . in some of these models",
    "a varying coupling function @xmath0 has been suggested as a possible solution to alleviate discrepancies with observations and to be able to explain the late time behavior of the universe @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "a variable coupling function @xmath0 was first discussed by nordtvedt @xcite in the weak - field limit .",
    "later on , barker proposed a particular choice of @xmath0 such that @xmath9 to first order in the weak - field limit @xcite .",
    "more recent works @xcite take into account that if @xmath7 varies , then it can increase with the cosmic time such that @xmath10 and @xmath11 @xmath12 as @xmath13 , and thus the weak - field observations at the present time agree with the predictions of gr , even though the theory may deviate from gr at very early cosmological times . in such works ,",
    "the authors were able to get exact solutions for some specific cases of the equation of state , without putting attention in the deceleration parameter .",
    "a very extensive work has been done by barrow and parson @xcite ( see also @xcite ) in the context of generalized scalar - tensor theories , which can approach gr in the weak - field limit at late time .",
    "they also propose three different functions for @xmath0 and get asymptotic solutions at early and late cosmic times for different cases of an equation of state .",
    "they showed that a function @xmath0 , which fulfills the conditions in the weak field limit and that agrees with solar system measurements is not unique .",
    "this lack of uniqueness makes meaningless to look for analytic or numerical solutions of the field equations at all times , assuming a specific function for @xmath0 ( even if this function match the weak - field limit and agree with solar system measurements ) .",
    "however , taking into account the known conditions of a today flat and accelerated expanding universe , and the necessary transition from a decelerated radiation dominated epoch to an accelerated epoch today , we can analyze the function @xmath0 as a cosmological parameter . on the other hand , as a local parameter we already know the values of @xmath0 obtained from solar system measurements @xcite , and as scharre and",
    "will @xcite discuss , future observations of neutron stars spiraling into massive black holes by space - based laser interferometric detectors such as lisa , may place significant bounds on the scalar - tensor coupling parameter @xmath7 . then , we can have more accurate information to bound the function @xmath0 .",
    "the aim of this work is to study the required conditions in generalized scalar - tensor theories that determine an accelerated expansion at the present epoch , a decelerated expansion in the past , appropriated limits on @xmath0 , and values of cosmological parameters consistent with measurements .",
    "we consider a generalized scalar - tensor theory with arbitrary @xmath0 and @xmath1 , where this last function plays the role of an effective cosmological constant . in section 2",
    ", we solve our corresponding field equations for @xmath0 and @xmath1 as functions of the scalar field and the scale factor .",
    "we write those functions in terms of the deceleration and hubble parameters . in section 3 , we find expressions for the contributions of the scalar field , the effective cosmological constant , and the matter , to the density parameter in stt , assuming a flat universe . in section 4 , we get a general expression of the deceleration parameter , and we show how it depends on the different contributions to the energy density parameter . in section 5 , we discuss the conditions which @xmath0 needs to satisfy in order to be consistent with solar system measurements .",
    "in section 6 , we assume a power law of time for the scale factor and the scalar field , and we discuss the bounds on such power laws that determine an acelerated expanding model of the universe with cosmological parameters consistent with the values known from observations .",
    "we analyse the necessary conditions for a decelerated expanding model dominated by radiation .",
    "finally , in section 7 , we sumarize our results .",

    "the scalar field @xmath8 is a dynamical quantity , in contrast to einstein s theory where @xmath19 is a constant .",

    "we have discussed the conditions for an accelerated expansion at the present time @xmath88 , as well as the correct limits for @xmath0 in the weak field limit .    we have found that in order to satisfy the weak field limits , it is necessary to have @xmath93 at @xmath88 , but a different value of @xmath92 should be assumed for @xmath210 ( see discussion under eq.([a - phi ] ) ) . in order to overcome this problem , we have assumed two regions of the function @xmath34 given in eq.([a - phi ] ) , one for @xmath93 at @xmath114 and another for @xmath98 at an early epoch .    with those conditions we also found a range of possible values for the exponent @xmath95 .",

    "we are dealing with a time dependent cosmological `` constant '' such that it can have a larger value in a early universe and it will decrease with time until the small value estimated today .",
    "we also expect that @xmath217 gets a small value at an epoch dominated by radiation and continues growing until the value measured today in solar system measurements , ( and agrees with weak field limits ) .",
    "we have found a range of values for @xmath95 and @xmath92 which fullfill all this conditions and a decelerated expansion in this epoch .",
    "we have calculated @xmath171 , @xmath7 , @xmath71 and @xmath72 for some values of @xmath95 and @xmath92 in the interval found here .",
    "the obtained results are consistent with the expectactions of this theory .",
    "it is clear that the previous results depend strongly on the form of the assumed functions for @xmath29 and @xmath34 , specially the values of the power law constants .",
    "the age of the universe also depends on the assumed function for @xmath29 , which is given by @xmath218 , where @xmath54 is the hubble parameter measured today .",
    "we found that an accelerated expansion requires @xmath219 , thus @xmath220 gyr , which is a large value if we accept that @xmath221 gyr @xcite . because the larger the value of @xmath95 ( or smaller acceleration )",
    ", the older the universe is , the assumed function for @xmath29 could be troublesome .",
    "even if there is not certainty that these are the actual functions for @xmath29 and @xmath34 , the obtained results show that it is possible to get a set of conditions in stt , in order to get an accelerated expansion at the present epoch , and a decelerated expansion in a remote past , and also have a good agreement with values of cosmological parameters .",
    "the present results show the kind of information which we require and the possible results which we can obtain from the study of these problems in generalized scalar - tensor theories .    some important aspects still need to be discussed in the context of the theory which we have presented here , for example , the study of density perturbations , in order to know if the conditions for structure formation in generalized scalar - tensor theories are consistent with the results obtained in this work .",
