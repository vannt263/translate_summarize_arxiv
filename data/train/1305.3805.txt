    "quantum mechanical systems with contact interaction , or point interaction , are treated extensively in the physics literature , in connection with problems in atomic , nuclear and solid state physics . in two and three dimensions",

    "the corresponding bcs gap equation has a particularly simple form in this case .",
    "however , in order to prevent such a fermi gas from collapsing and to ensure stability of matter , the contact interaction has to arise from potentials @xmath1 which have a large repulsive core ( such that @xmath12 ) in addition to an attractive tail .",
    "the strength of the attractive tail depends on the system under consideration , ranging from a weakly interacting superfluid ( where @xmath13 ) @xcite to a strongly interacting gas of tightly bound fermion pairs ( where @xmath0 typically has one negative eigenvalue ) @xcite .",
    "having such systems in mind , the present paper is dedicated to the study of contact interactions arising as a limit of short range potentials @xmath1 with large positive core and , in particular , a non - vanishing and positive integral @xmath14 in the limit @xmath15 .",
