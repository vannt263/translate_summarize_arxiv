    "galactic globular clusters ( gcs ) are populous collections of old stars dating from the first few gyr after the big bang . because they typically consist of @xmath11 to @xmath12 stars ,",
    "even short - lived evolutionary phases can be well populated .",
    "the wide range in metal abundances , as well as their extensive lifetimes , make globular clusters key ingredients in any explanation of the stellar and chemical evolution of our galaxy . with few exceptions ,",
    "gcs have long been thought to be excellent examples of single stellar populations ( ssps , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) that formed at about the same time as our galaxy",
    ". however , many gcs show light element abundance spreads indicative of the presence of multiple ( but nearly coeval ) populations .",
    "the main goal of this paper is to take a fresh look at ic@xmath04499 , a galactic gc with a mass somewhat lower than those clusters that most often clearly exhibit complex photometric behavior .",
    "if lower mass clusters correspond more closely to single stellar populations than the highest mass clusters , then the interpretation of their presumably simpler histories may be critical in deciphering the early evolution of our galaxy and its system of gcs .",
    "although major hst programs such as @xcite are providing outstanding data sets for the nearby clusters , many of the lower mass clusters ( @xmath13 x @xmath14 ) still lack definitive study .",
    "the very lowest mass clusters are not tractable to study as they do not contain statistically significant numbers of stars in the various evolutionary phases .",
    "however , moderate mass clusters such as ic@xmath04499 do contain sufficient stars for population analyses and are relatively numerous in our galaxy .",
    "any explanation of their properties should be consistent with the exotic behavior seen in the generally more massive clusters .",
    "if observations in multiple photometric bands are available , strong constraints on the complexities of gcs can be made .",
    "we present deep multiband optical photometry of ic@xmath04499 in the @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and @xmath6@xmath7 bands , and take advantage of this wavelength range for a detailed analysis of potential multiple components in this gc .",
    "ic@xmath04499 is a little - studied cluster lying in the intermediate - outer halo , with basic parameters @xcite , of @xmath15 kpc , @xmath16 , @xmath17 = -1.53 $ ] .",
    "it is a low - density cluster that allows ground - based studies to penetrate to the cluster center to below the main sequence ( ms ) turnoff , and is principally distinguished by its apparent relatively young age @xcite and the large number of rr lyrae variables it contains @xcite ; it has the highest specific frequency ( numbers normalized to mass ) of rr lyrae variables contained in any galactic gc listed by @xcite with the exception of the low mass cluster palomar 13 .",
    "the variables have an oosterhoff type i ( oo i ) period distribution @xcite , and a substantial fraction are double - mode ( rrd ) oscillators , first studied by @xcite .",
    "a comprehensive ccd study of the variable star population was made by @xcite .    from low - resolution spectroscopy of four red giant branch ( rgb ) stars ,",

    "more than a decade has passed since the last cmd investigations of ic@xmath04499 , and in that time the age of the universe has been refined by the wmap experiment ( bennett et  al .",
    "2010 ) ; for a standard @xmath21cdm model the best - fit age is 13.7 gyr .",
    "formation of galaxies and the first galactic gcs is expected to have happened relatively quickly , within approximately the first gyr , by @xmath22 according to @xcite .",
    "modern isochrones ( e.g. the basti archive , available on - line at http://www.oa-teramo.inaf.it/basti/ ) are used here to investigate whether ic@xmath04499 is a  young \" gc with an age 24 gyr younger than clusters of similar metallicity @xcite , and to provide an updated age determination of this cluster .",
    "as the observations reach farther than the tidal radius of ic@xmath04499 , an investigation of a possible association of ic@xmath04499 with extratidal stars is carried out .",
    "on the basis of its supposedly young age and position in the galaxy , ic@xmath04499 has been proposed to be associated with the monoceros ring , a structure whose interpretation is contentious @xcite but most likely appears to be a tidal stream remnant of a galaxy that merged with our own @xcite .",
    "recently , the radial velocity of ic@xmath04499 was shown to be within the range of the halo gcs and not inconsistent with being associated with membership in the monoceros ring @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows :  2 is a description of the observational material ,  3 is the presentation of the cmds from which we estimate the structural parameters of the cluster , and compare them with theoretical isochrones from which the age , distance , and reddening are derived , ",

    ", @xmath30 is an adjustable parameter . however in fitting the isochrones ( see below ) we found no reason not to choose @xmath25 .",
    "the cmd of ic@xmath04499 is shown in figure  [ cmd ] , with three different color baselines .",
    "the morphology has been described in previous investigations , with the exception that here the ms extends to @xmath31 with high precision .",
    "the short horizontal branch is well populated in the region of the instability strip ; hence many of these stars are rr lyrae variables , marked by crosses in figure  [ cmd ] .",
    "there is considerable contamination of the cluster rgb with field stars , due to the cluster position in the sky .",
    "figure  [ cmd ] shows the basti isochrones set with the following parameters : canonical , @xmath32-enhanced , z = 0.0006 , [ @xmath32/fe ] = + 0.4 , @xmath33 $ ] = @xmath341.49 , @xmath35 = 0.22 , @xmath30 = 3.1 , @xmath36 = 16.47 , and these isochrones are simultaneously fitted on the , , ,  and ,  cmds .",
    "the zahb locus with these same parameters is also shown . because the stellar models used in the present analysis do not account for the updated conductive opacities provided by @xcite , a shift of @xmath37 mag in  to the basti zahb",
    "is applied as discussed by the quoted authors .",
    "we established the distance modulus by matching the isochrones to the horizontal branch stellar distribution , and find that it is identical to that found by @xcite .",
    "the metallicity is consistent with spectroscopy of rgb stars from @xcite from which the cluster metallicity was found to be = @xmath38 .",
    "the @xmath32-element enhancement is assumed to be similar ( [ @xmath32/fe ] = + 0.4 ) to that for halo globular clusters in general .",
    "the data shown in fig .  [ cmd ] reveals that theoretical isochrones with age 11 gyr and 13 gyr appear to properly bracket the cluster photometry .",
    "therefore , we estimate an age of 12 @xmath8 1 gyr for ic@xmath04499 .",
    "it is worth noting that present result does not support the younger age of ic@xmath04499 found by @xcite compared to the majority of galactic gcs . on the contrary , our age is coeval with them @xcite .",
    "the difference in the age estimate with respect to that of @xcite , can be - at least partially - explained as a consequence of the use of a more updated and reliable theoretical framework .",
    "however , the use of a different , updated set of isochrones such as those provided by @xcite and @xcite , does not affect our final cluster age determination .",
    "in fact , all state - of - the - art isochrones such as the basti set give ages that are consistent with the wmap age of the universe of 13.7 gyr @xcite , and provide a quite similar age ranking for the galactic gcs system ( see , e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "we emphasize that care must be taken when comparing relative ages with those in the older literature , as the range of ages for the majority group of older gcs with no age - metallicity relation is under 1 gyr @xcite compared to the several gyr commonly proposed in the past , where uncertainties in the distance scale and magnitude - metallicity relation for rr lyrae variables propagated into the ages , as discussed for instance by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "there is increasing evidence that some globular clusters now part of our galactic gc system formed in dwarf galaxies that subsequently  over a hubble time  merged with our own galaxy , with the present - day merger example of the sagittarius dwarf and its central gc m54 and other associated clusters being a case in point @xcite .",
    "several gcs have been associated with stellar streams in the galactic halo that are presumably remnants of earlier mergers , e.g. ngc 5053 @xcite , ngc@xmath05466 @xcite and terzan@xmath05 @xcite , while others are surrounded by extra - tidal stars e.g. , ngc@xmath01851 and ngc@xmath01904 @xcite or distinct tidal tails such as that for palomar  5 @xcite indicating ongoing dynamical evolution . in a spectroscopic survey of a limited number of giant candidates in the ic@xmath04499 field , hankey & cole ( 2010 ; also hankey 2011 , private communication ) found several stars that appear to share the cluster s radial velocity despite lying more than 24 arcminutes from the cluster center .",
    "the tidal radius of ic@xmath04499 was determined to be 12.35 arcmin by @xcite .",
    "the structural parameters for most of the clusters included in @xcite were derived via surface - brightness measurements from photographic plates and/or small - format ccd images , after manual removal of areas affected by stars believed to belong to the foreground . in the case of ic@xmath04499 alone ,",
    "the cluster profile was derived via numerical differentiation of previously published photoelectric photometry ; the authors do not mention any correction for field - star contamination for this cluster . due to its location in the sky , ( @xmath39,@xmath40 )",
    "= ( 307,@xmath3420 ) , ic@xmath04499 is unfortunately seen through a fairly rich galactic foreground : simulated star counts from the besanon model @xcite ( see particularly their fig .  6 )",
    "predict approximately 3000 field stars per square degree with @xmath41 brighter than 20@xmath0mag .",
    "most of these stars are expected to have colors similar to the rgb and the turnoff region .",
    "our data for ic@xmath04499which appear to be appreciably better than any that were previously available ",
    "extend to a maximum distance of 33 arcmin from the cluster center , and we have complete coverage out to a distance of 14 arcmin .",
    "therefore we should be able to derive an independent and possibly more definitive measure of the cluster s tidal radius than has hitherto - fore been possible .",
    "we have experimented with a new methodology for distinguishing the cluster density profile from foreground - field contamination , which we will describe here in some detail .",
    "we begin by identifying an `` acceptance region '' or `` box '' in the color - magnitude plane where the vast majority of cluster members are found .",
    "our assumption will be that the number of true cluster members falling outside the acceptance region will be small compared to those inside .",
    "the number of field stars contained within the acceptance box may be small , relative to the number falling outside it , but we do not expect that number to be negligible .",
    "we will , however , assume that neither the cluster population nor the field population changes significantly with position within our overall field of view .",
    "the surface density of field stars falling outside the box in the cmd will be easy to estimate quantitatively , because we expect contamination of this sample by cluster stars to be small and  in particular ",
    "negligible at large distances from the cluster .",
    "we will then examine the ratio of star counts _ inside _ the acceptance region to counts _ outside _ the acceptance region as a function of distance from the cluster center .",
    "we will take the asymptotic limit of this ratio at large radial distance as representing the number ratio of field stars inside the box to field stars outside the box .",
    "the surface density of field stars inside the box thus derived can then be subtracted from the radial profile of star counts to yield the decontaminated cluster profile .    to isolate that part of the color - magnitude diagram where cluster members dominate",
    ", we plotted the stars with the smallest intrinsic photometric errors lying within the annulus 10@xmath42 r @xmath42 180centered on the cluster ( see figure  [ bmiv ] ) .",
    "a cubic spline was fitted to the cluster ridge line and an acceptance region was defined where the majority of cluster stars are found to lie .",
    "the left panel of figure  [ ridger ] displays the ,  cmd of the entire sample of stars with no selection in radial distance and with a very mild selection in photometric error ( @xmath43@xmath420.25 mag ) .",
    "the solid line shows the ridge line , while the dashed ones display the acceptance region .",
    "this box has a width in color of 0.01 mag close to the tip of the red giant branch ( rgb ) and increases to 0.3 mag at magnitudes fainter than the main sequence turn - off ( msto ) . at visual magnitudes",
    "fainter than 22.75 mag , the acceptance region stops because the photometric errors increase and the ridge line is less accurate .",

    "the group of stars located at @xmath4520 and ( ) @xmath451 includes cluster blue stragglers ( bss ) and also chance optical blends of stars in the crowded regions of the cluster . note that we do not count these among the cluster stars , which will result in a ( very ) minor underestimate of the number of true cluster members in the innermost one or two radial bins .",
    "this will have no significant effect whatsoever on our inferences for the outer part of the cluster profile .",
    "the bss will be included in a study of the ic@xmath04499 rrl and sx phe stars by nemec et al ( in preparation ) .",
    "with the acceptance region defined , we can now consider the radial density profiles of the `` accepted '' and the `` rejected '' stars .",

    "therefore , we have a complete star sample only out to a radius of 842 arcseconds or 14 arcminutes ; from 14 to 34 arcminutes we have a representative but incomplete sample .",

    "because the radial profile is not observed to flatten at the largest distances , we conclude that the tidal radius of this cluster might be larger than previously estimated .",

    ", we plan to perform a more detailed fit of the density profile to constrain the possible occurrence of a halo around ic@xmath04499 and , in particular , whether the distribution of the outermost stars is azimuthally symmetric .",

    "a deep potential well would allow the retention of ejecta of first generation stars and increase the chance of forming a second star generation @xcite .",

    "we present new @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and @xmath6@xmath7 photometry of the galactic globular cluster ic@xmath04499 .",
    "as the multiband photometry extends well below the main sequence turn - off , current basti isochrones are fitted to three color baselines to derive an age of 12@xmath81 gyr .",
    "this is the first modern age estimate for ic@xmath04499 . despite previous suggestions of a younger age for ic@xmath04499 @xcite",

    "the density profile of the cluster is measured to search for signs of tidal streams and/or extra - tidal stars . out to @xmath10800 , the density profile continues to change .",
    "this could be because the tidal radius is larger than previously estimated .",
    "it could also be that ic@xmath04499 is surrounded by a halo , similar to that claimed for m92 ( testa et  al .",

    "using @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath5 , and @xmath6@xmath7 , and 43 red giant branch stars confirmed spectroscopically by @xcite , no anomalous color spreads potentially due to variations in the abundances of light elements are detected . to increase the sample size ,",
    "the @xmath6@xmath7 narrow band filter is used to select a sample of 100 probable giants . also with this sample , no anomalous color spread is detected .",
    "this is in contrast to the more massive gcs studied by @xcite , in which different components using near ultraviolet bands were detected .",
    "given the small photometric errors in our catalog , this implies a rather small spread of light elements among the giant branch stars in ic@xmath04499 .",
