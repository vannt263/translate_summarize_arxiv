    "* ) , but using the observed set of resonant tnos to infer the intrinsic number and distribution of resonant objects is difficult due to complicated observational biases induced by the resonant orbital dynamics @xcite . here , we present the first set of 31 secure and 8 insecure resonant tnos detected by the outer solar system origins survey ( ossos ) , which was designed to produce detections with well - characterized biases @xcite .",
    "ossos is a large program on the canada - france hawaii telescope surveying eight @xmath1 deg@xmath2 fields , some near the invariable plane and some at moderate latitudes from the invariable plane , for tnos down to a limiting magnitude of @xmath3 in r - band .",
    "observations began in spring 2013 and will continue through early 2017 ( see @xcite for a full description of ossos ) .",
    "two of the primary science goals for ossos are measuring the relative populations of neptune s mean motion resonances and modeling the detailed orbital distributions inside the resonances .",
    "the most current observational constraints on both the distributions and number of tnos in neptune s most prominent resonances come from the results of the canada france ecliptic plane survey ( cfeps ; * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter referred to as g12 ) .",
    "population estimates for some of neptune s resonances have also been modeled based on the deep ecliptic survey ( des ; * ? ? ?",
    "ossos will offer an improvement on these previous constraints because it is optimized for resonant detections ( especially for the 3:2 resonance ) and includes off - invariable plane blocks to better probe inclination distributions .    here",
    "we report on the characterized resonant object detections from the first two of the eight ossos observational blocks : 13ao , an off - invariable plane block with a characterization limit of @xmath4 , and 13ae , a block overlapping the ecliptic and invariable planes with a characterization limit of @xmath5 .",
    "the characterization limit is the faintest magnitude for which the detection efficiency of the survey is well - measured and for which all objects are tracked ( see @xcite for more details ) .",
    "figure  [ f : oe_blocks ] shows the location of the 13ao and 13ae blocks relative to a model ( g12 ) of neptune s 3:2 mean motion resonance .",
    "the 13ao block is centered about @xmath6 above the ecliptic plane at the trailing ortho - neptune point ( @xmath7 in longitude behind neptune ) , and the 13ae block is at @xmath8 ecliptic latitude @xmath9 farther from neptune .",
    "the full description of these blocks and the ossos observational methods are detailed in @xcite .",
    "the 13ao block yielded 18 securely resonant tnos out of 36 characterized detections , and the 13ae block yielded 13 securely resonant tnos out of 50 characterized detections ; securely resonant objects are ones where the orbit - fit uncertainties fall within the width of the resonance ( see section  [ s : detections ] and appendix  [ a : orbits ] for the full list of resonant ossos detections and discussion of the classification procedure ) .",
    "the larger yield of resonant objects in the 13ao block reflects both its favorable placement off the invariable plane near the center of the 3:2 resonance ( see section [ s:32 ] ) as well as its slightly fainter characterization limit .",
    "our detections include secure 3:2 , 5:2 , 2:1 , 7:3 , and 7:4 resonant objects as well as insecure 5:3 , 8:5 , 18:11 , 16:9 , 15:8 , 13:5 , and 11:4 detections .",
    "the 3:2 , 5:2 , and 2:1 resonances contain sufficiently many detections to model their populations . in this paper",
    ", we use these detections and the survey s known biases to place constraints on the number and distribution of objects in these resonances .",
    "we then discus how our constraints compare to the current theoretical understanding of the origins and dynamics of these tnos .",
    "current models propose three possible pathways by which tnos may be captured into resonance .",
    "first , they may have been captured by neptune as it smoothly migrated outward on a roughly circular orbit @xcite , driven by interactions between neptune and a primordial planetesimal disk @xcite .",
    "a disk with the majority of its mass in planetesimals @xmath10100 km in radius can produce migration smooth enough for resonance capture @xcite , although formation of large planetesimals by the streaming instability @xcite , if efficient , could render planetesimal - driven migration too stochastic .",
    "capture by a smoothly migrating neptune produces some objects that are deeply embedded in the resonance , having resonant angles ( see section [ s : methods ] ) that librate with low amplitude ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "given capture by smooth migration , the distribution of libration centers ( see section [ s:21 ] ) among 2:1 resonant objects serves as a speedometer , measuring the timescale of neptune s primordial orbital evolution @xcite .",
    "smooth migration models predict that the 5:2 resonance captures fewer objects than the 3:2 and 2:1 @xcite and have difficulty producing the large inclinations observed in the kuiper belt , though @xcite recently suggest that transient resonant sticking and loss during slow migration may resolve the latter difficulty .",
    "second , resonant objects could be the most stable remnants of a dynamically excited population that filled phase space in the outer solar system @xcite as a result of early dynamical instability among the giant planets ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the phase space volume of each resonance in which objects can have small libration amplitudes is limited , so this type of model preferentially produces larger - amplitude librators . because neptune spends time with high eccentricity",
    ", such a scenario must be tuned to avoid disruption of the observed dynamically unexcited  cold classical \" tnos @xcite .",
    "models of capture following dynamical instability may produce high inclination tnos more effectively than standard smooth migration models , but they still under - predict observations @xcite . like smooth migration , these models do not predict a large 5:2 population compared to the 3:2 and 2:1 populations ( * ? ? ?",
    "* g12 ) .",
    "third , resonant objects need not be primordial .",
    "objects currently scattering off of neptune can be captured into resonance temporarily ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these marginally stable objects tend to have large libration amplitudes and may be a productive source of objects in distant resonances such as the 5:2 .    inspired by the differences between these three emplacement mechanisms",
    ", we focus our dynamical modeling on the libration amplitude distribution in the 3:2 resonance , the distribution of libration centers in the 2:1 resonance , and the relative abundance of objects in the 5:2 compared to the 3:2 and 2:1 .",
    "finally , we emphasize that comparison of dynamical models of resonance capture with the current resonant populations must take into account the evolution of resonant orbits over the age of the solar system .",
    "numerous theoretical studies of the current dynamics and stability of neptune s resonances ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ) provide insight into this evolution .",
    "we use these studies to inform our constructed orbital models .",

    "a table of the ossos resonant tno detections from the 13ae and 13ao blocks and a description of how we determine resonance membership is provided in section [ s : detections ] .",
    "we model the distribution and total number of 3:2 objects based on the ossos detections in section [ s:32 ] , demonstrating that this population contains members with lower libration amplitudes than previously seen . in section [ s:52 ]",

    "section [ s : sum ] summarizes our key results .",
    "after briefly introducing mean motion resonances ( section [ s : mmr ] ) , we summarize the challenges presented by detection bias for measuring resonant populations ( section [ s : bias ] ) . to circumvent these biases",
    ", we employ the ossos survey simulator to test models of the resonant populations .",
    "the survey simulator can only test models  it can not produce them  and we describe our choice of models in section [ ss : ssmod ] .",
    "neptune s mean motion resonances ( which we call @xmath11 resonances , with @xmath12 for external resonances ) have resonant angles , @xmath13 , given by @xmath14 where @xmath15 , and @xmath16 are the mean longitude , longitude of perihelion , and longitude of ascending node ( the subscripts @xmath17 and @xmath18 refer to the elements of a tno and neptune ) , and @xmath19 are integers with the constraint that @xmath20 .",
    "objects in a mean motion resonance have values of @xmath13 that librate around a central value with an amplitude defined as @xmath21 . for small eccentricity ( @xmath22 ) and inclination ( @xmath23 ) , the strength of the resonant terms in the disturbing function are proportional to @xmath24 @xcite , and resonances with small @xmath25 are generally stronger than those with larger @xmath25 .",
    "tnos typically have eccentricities and inclinations much larger than neptune s , so we will ignore resonant angles involving @xmath26 and @xmath27 . likewise the resonant angles involving the inclination of the tno are typically less important than those involving the eccentricity because inclination resonances are at least second order in @xmath28 . throughout the rest of this work , we will generally consider this simplified resonance angle : @xmath29 with a few exceptions noted in table  [ t : detections ] and section  [ s : other ] . in most cases , such as in the 3:2 and 5:2 resonances ,",
    "this resonant angle librates around @xmath30 .",
    "the topology of n:1 exterior resonances allows for resonant orbits with more than one center of libration ; the 2:1 resonance has two so - called asymmetric libration centers near @xmath31 and @xmath32 ( the exact centers are eccentricity dependent ) in addition to the symmetric libration center at @xmath30 .",
    "the libration of @xmath13 around specific values means that objects in resonance will come to perihelion at specific offsets from neptune s current mean longitude .",
    "when a tno is at perihelion , its mean anomaly ( @xmath33 ) is 0 , so @xmath34 . substituting this into equation  [ eq : phi ] shows that at perihelion : @xmath35    some resonances contain a subcomponent of objects also in the kozai resonance ; these objects exhibit libration of the argument of perihelion , @xmath36 , in addition to libration of the resonant angle @xmath13 .",
    "this libration causes coupled variations in @xmath22 and @xmath23 such that the quantity @xmath37 is preserved .",
    "outside of mean motion resonances , libration of @xmath38 only occurs at very large inclinations in the trans - neptunian region @xcite , but inside mean motion resonances kozai libration can occur at much smaller inclinations . in the 3:2 resonance , kozai libration can occur even at very low inclinations @xcite and a significant number of observed 3:2 objects are known to be in the kozai resonance , including pluto .",
    "kozai resonance has also been observed for members of the 7:4 , 5:3 , and 2:1 resonances @xcite . in the 3:2 resonance ,",
    "the libration of @xmath38 occurs around values of @xmath7 and @xmath39 with typical amplitudes of @xmath40 and typical libration periods of several myr .      in order to be detected by ossos",
    ", a tno must be in the survey s field of view , brighter than the limiting magnitude of the field , and moving at a rate of motion detectable by the survey s moving object detection pipeline ( see @xcite for more details ) ; because the ossos observing strategy is optimized to detect the motion of objects at distances between @xmath41 au , the first two criteria are the primary source of detection biases for the resonant objects .",
    "the intrinsic brightness distribution of tnos with absolute magnitudes brighter than @xmath42 is generally well - modeled as an exponential in @xmath43 ( discussed in section  [ ss : ssmod ] ) , meaning there are increasing numbers of objects at increasing @xmath43 ( decreasing brightness ) . for a population of tnos on eccentric orbits , this means that most detections will be made for faint , large-@xmath43 tnos near their perihelion .",
    "consequently , populations containing preferentially fainter objects must have preferentially higher eccentricities to produce the same number of detections .",
    "furthermore , given that resonant tnos come to perihelion at preferred longitudes relative to neptune ( equation  [ eq : peri ] ) , this means that the placement of the field in longitude relative to neptune produces biases toward and against certain resonances .",
    "objects in n:2 resonances librating about @xmath44 will preferentially come to perihelion at the ortho - neptune points ( @xmath45 away from neptune ) ; asymmetric n:1 librators will come to perihelion at various longitudes ahead or behind neptune , depending on the value of the libration center ( see figure  1 in g12 for an illustration of perihelion locations for various resonances ) .",
    "the ossos 13ao and 13ae blocks are @xmath46 and @xmath47 behind neptune , which favors the detection of n:2 objects as well as asymmetric librators in the 2:1 resonance s trailing libration center . these biases for the 3:2 , 5:2 , and 2:1 resonances will be discussed in later sections .",
    "similarly , latitude placement of the observing blocks relative to the ecliptic plane produces biases in inclination for tnos .",
    "the 13ae block ( @xmath8 ecliptic latitude ) favors the detection of low-@xmath23 tnos because these tnos spend most of their time near the ecliptic plane , while in the 13ao block it is not possible to detect objects with inclinations smaller than the field s ecliptic latitude of @xmath48 . for resonances such as the 3:2",
    ", the kozai subcomponent of the resonance introduces an additional observational bias ; the libration of @xmath38 means that kozai resonant objects come to perihelion at preferred ecliptic latitudes in addition to preferred longitudes with respect the neptune ( equation  [ eq : peri ] ) .",
    "the biases induced by the kozai resonance for the 3:2 population are discussed in detail by @xcite .",
    "to account for these observational biases in our modeling , we use the ossos survey simulator .",
    "we use the ossos detections of resonant objects combined with the ossos survey simulator to construct and test models of neptune s resonant populations .",
    "the survey simulator is described in @xcite .",
    "its premise is as follows : given a procedure ( i.e model ) for generating the position and brightness of resonant objects on the sky , the simulator repeatedly generates objects and then checks whether they would have been detected by the survey .",
    "the simulator stops when the desired number of simulated detections is achieved .",
    "when the model agrees with observations , the sets of real and simulated detected objects should have similar absolute magnitudes and orbital properties .",
    "the intrinsic number of objects in a resonance ( i.e. a population estimate for the input model ) corresponds to the number of detected and undetected objects the survey simulator had to generate ( down to a specified absolute magnitude @xmath43 ) in order to match the real number of detections .",
    "we run the survey simulator many times for each model with different random number generator seeds ; this allows us to build a distribution of population estimates and a large sample of simulated detections .",
    "we then run statistical tests to determine whether the model provides simulated detections that are a good match to the real detections ; these tests are discussed later in this section as well as in appendix  [ a : stats ] .",
    "a resonant object s orbit is uniquely determined by its semi - major axis , @xmath49 , eccentricity , @xmath22 , inclination , @xmath23 , mean anomaly , @xmath50 , longitude of ascending node , @xmath16 , resonance angle @xmath13 , and epoch , @xmath51 , for the given value of @xmath33 .",
    "following g12 , we construct a set of models for each resonant population by parameterizing the intrinsic distributions of @xmath49 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath13 , and absolute magnitude @xmath43 . for each simulated object",
    ", the simulator draws @xmath49 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath13 , and @xmath43 from these models and then constructs the remaining orbital elements based on constraints from the resonant condition ( equation  [ eq : phi ] ) .",
    "we choose a uniformly - distributed random value for @xmath33 to reflect that the object s specific position within its orbit is random in time , and we draw @xmath49 randomly from a uniform distribution spanning the approximate resonance width .",
    "appendix  [ a : resmodeling ] provides the values used for the resonance widths , though we note that our results are not affected by this complication ; because the resonance widths are small , choosing a fixed @xmath49 for each resonance would produce equivalent results . for objects not experiencing kozai oscillations , the orientation of the orbit s plane relative to the ecliptic plane is not coupled to the resonance , so we also choose @xmath16 randomly from a uniform distribution . for the 3:2 population",
    ", we include an additional parameter for the fraction of the population in the kozai resonance .",
    "our procedure for selecting the orbital elements of these objects is described in section [ s:32 ] and appendix [ as:32 ] .    in sections  [ s:32 ] through  [ s:21 ] and",
    "appendix  [ a : resmodeling ] we outline the exact models used , but the general form of the parameterized models in @xmath43 , @xmath22 , and @xmath23 is the same for each resonance .",
    "we represent the cumulative luminosity distribution as an exponential in @xmath43 with logarithmic slope @xmath52 : @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the number of objects having magnitudes between a reference @xmath55 and @xmath43 .",

    "we model the differential eccentricity distribution as a gaussian centered on @xmath57 with a width @xmath58 : @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the number of objects with eccentricities between @xmath22 and @xmath61 .",
    "this is a convenient form that acceptably describes populations with a typical eccentricity and a roughly symmetrical eccentricity dispersion .",
    "following @xcite , we model the differential inclination distribution as a gaussian with width @xmath62 multiplied by @xmath63 : @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the number of objects with inclinations between @xmath23 and @xmath66 .",
    "the @xmath13 distribution and treatment of the kozai resonance are specific to each resonance .",
    "however for the 3:2 and 5:2 resonances , which have only one libration center @xmath30 , the @xmath13 distribution may be uniquely specified by a distribution of libration amplitudes , @xmath67 , about that center .",
    "we approximate the time evolution of @xmath13 for an individual object as the oscillation of a simple harmonic oscillator with amplitude @xmath67 @xcite .",
    "the instantaneous value of @xmath13 for a simulated object is then @xmath68 where @xmath51 is a random number distributed uniformly between 0 and 1 .",
    "small - amplitude libration is well - approximated by a simple harmonic oscillator , while for large @xmath67 the angular evolution near the extrema of libration ( where @xmath69 changes sign ) slows less in full numerical simulations than equation  [ eq : phitime ] implies .",
    "this means that compared to full numerical simulations , equation  [ eq : phitime ] slightly underestimates the likelihood that objects will be observed @xmath70 from neptune ( perihelion for @xmath71 ) and slightly overestimates the likelihood of finding objects at angles corresponding to the extrema of libration . however , in appendix [ as:32 ] we demonstrate that for all plutinos observed by ossos , full simulations of the resonant angle evolution do not deviate from equation  [ eq : phitime ] enough to meaningfully affect our results .    for resonances with a single libration center ,",
    "we follow g12 and model the distribution of libration amplitudes as a triangle that starts at @xmath72 , rises linearly to a central value @xmath73 and then linearly falls to zero at the upper stability boundary for @xmath74 ( @xmath75 in the case of the 3:2 , @xcite ) .",
    "this triangle need not be symmetric .",
    "a triangular @xmath76 distribution is not an arbitrary choice ; theoretical studies of resonant phase space and of the dynamical capture and the evolution of plutinos often result in @xmath76 distributions that are roughly triangular in shape ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "this outcome may be understood qualitatively as the result of shrinking phase space volumes at small libration amplitudes and increased dynamical instability at large amplitudes .",
    "for example ,",

    "we note that our statistical approach is limited by computational feasibility .",
    "ideally we would like to perform a maximum likelihood calculation , but the nature of the observational biases means we can not analytically calculate the detection probabilities ; they must instead be numerically determined by running the survey simulator .",

    "the observational biases affecting the @xmath23 and @xmath76 distributions are relatively independent of each other and of the chosen @xmath43 and @xmath22 distributions ; to reduce the complexity of model testing , we consider each of these observables separately as a one - dimensional distribution .",
    "following @xcite and g12 , we use the anderson - darling ( ad ) test to identify a range of acceptable model parameters for these two distributions ( goal 1 above ) .",
    "the test statistic  described in appendix  [ a : stats]is a weighted measure of the difference between two cumulative distributions . for each set of model parameters ,",
    "we determine whether the set of @xmath23 and @xmath76 values for the real detections could be drawn from the simulated detections as follows : we generate a large number of synthetic detections for each model and calculate the ad statistic for the real detections compared to the model distribution .",

    "this procedure yields our @xmath80 confidence limits on the acceptable parameters ( @xmath62 and @xmath73 ) for our orbital model .",
    "we note that this bootstrapping is required to produce confidence limits from the ad statistic because our distributions are not gaussian .",
    "the ad test is a model rejection test , so to get a most probable values of @xmath62 and @xmath73 ( goal 2 ) , we must employ a different procedure .",
    "we numerically generate one - dimensional probability distributions in @xmath23 and @xmath76 for each allowed value of the parameters @xmath62 and @xmath73 , calculate the probability of detecting the observed objects for each parameter value , and select the values of @xmath62 and @xmath73 that maximize this probability . see appendix  [ a : stats ] for more details on how this calculation is done .",
    "we note that a bootstrapping procedure to determine the significance of the calculated probabilities of @xmath62 and @xmath73 yield 95% confidence limits on those values that are very similar to the 95% confidence limits based on the ad statistic .",

    "is computationally too expensive for the wide range of parameter space we must explore ( see discussion in appendix  [ a : stats ] ) .",

    "the resonant objects usually require more precise orbit fits than non - resonant objects in order to achieve secure classifications ( meaning all three orbits are resonant ) because uncertainty in an object s semimajor axis leads to uncertainty in the libration amplitude .",

    "<S> we confirm that the 5:2 resonance is more populated than models of the outer solar system s dynamical history predict ; our minimum population estimate shows that the high eccentricity ( @xmath0 ) portion of the resonance is at least as populous as the 2:1 and possibly as populated as the 3:2 resonance . </S>",
    "<S> one ossos block was well - suited to detecting objects trapped at low libration amplitudes in neptune s 3:2 resonance , a population of interest in testing the origins of resonant tnos . </S>",
    "<S> we detected three 3:2 objects with libration amplitudes below the cutoff modeled by cfeps ; ossos thus offers new constraints on this distribution . </S>",
    "<S> the ossos detections confirm that the 2:1 resonance has a dynamically colder inclination distribution than either the 3:2 or 5:2 resonances . </S>",
    "<S> using the combined ossos and cfeps 2:1 detections , we constrain the fraction of 2:1 objects in the symmetric mode of libration to be 0.20.85 ; we also constrain the fraction of leading vs. trailing asymmetric librators , which has been theoretically predicted to vary depending on neptune s migration history , to be 0.050.8 . </S>",
    "<S> future ossos blocks will improve these constraints . </S>"
