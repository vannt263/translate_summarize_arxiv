    "the active galaxy iras0421 + 0400 was first detected with iras ( soifer et al , 1984 ) and has a redshift of z=0.046 ( beichman et al , 1985 ; hill et al , 1988 ) .",
    "it shows emission line dominated spiral structure and a seyfert-2-type spectrum .",
    "the radio structure is very unusual , consisting of a central 1arcsec double source in the central region and large symmetrically bent lobes ( @xmath2 25kpc ) .",
    "the position of the hotspots as well as the the orientation and bending of the lobes ( beichman et al , 1985 ; hill et al , 1988 ; holloway et al , 1996 ; steffen et al , 1996 ) appear to be associated with the underlying optical spiral structure of the galaxy .",
    "jets in fri radio galaxies can flare very abruptly and show very large opening angles up to @xmath3 in diffuse lobes or tails ( odonoghue et al .",
    "these structures often bend very near the flaring point as is the case for iras0421 + 0400 .",
    "norman et al ( 1988 ) and loken et al ( 1995 ) have modelled this phenomenon in wide angle tail radio galaxies ( wat ) in terms of a supersonic jet passing through a shock in the ambient gas where the jet flow becomes subsonic .",
    "the jet is then disrupted and entrains external gas , which becomes turbulent and large and small scale eddies then develop",
    ". such a shock in the ambient medium could be due to a supersonic galactic wind moving into the surrounding intergalactic medium .",
    "we suggest that a similar scenario applies to iras0421 + 0400  at the position of the radio hot spots . here",
    "a mixing layer develops around the jet in which ambient gas is accelerated .",
    "the optically radiating gas should therefore be concentrated in a layer forming an opening quasi - conical surface , possibly with large scale eddies at some point as suggested by hydrodynamical simulations .",
    "owen et al ( 1990 ) conducted a search for optical line emission from the flaring regions in wat sources but found no significant emission from the 5 objects they studied .",
    "if our interpretation is correct , then iras0421 + 0400  is an important test object allowing to study such a transition region in the optical regime , thereby providing important kinematical information from spatially resolved spectra .",
    "[ outfl.fig ]    we model the longslit emission line spectra using a simple parameterized description of the emission and velocity field of the ionized gas flow . in our model",
    "we regard the extended emission line source around the radio hot spots as a collimated outflow which flares when passing through the boundary between the ism and the igm ( see fig.2 ) .",
    "the radial shape of the flow line is parameterized as a gradually opening spiral ( to simulate the effect of possible eddies ) given by @xmath4 here ( @xmath5,@xmath6,@xmath7 ) are cylindrical coordinates , and @xmath8 is a normalized position parameter along the spiral ( the subscript 0 indicates initial values ) .",
    "the parameter @xmath9 is the radial distance of the centre of the eddy from the axis , while @xmath10 allows for an elliptic cross section of excentricity @xmath11 as a simple approximation to non - axisymmetry .",
    "the longslit line profile is most dependent on the orientation of the outflow with respect to the observer s line of sight and the orientation of the spectrometer slit .",
    "the detailed shape of the outflow and the change in emissivity as a function of distance from the starting point only influence the detail of the simulated spectrum and not the gross features .",
    "therefore , we assume a constant emissivity and velocity along the flow line and a gaussian transverse emissivity distribution of fwhm@xmath12 .    in figure [ mosaic.fig ] we show a series of results for axisymmetric outflows varying the angle with respect to the line of sight ( left to right ) and orientation with respect to the direction of the spectrometre slit ( which covers the whole structure ) . a logarithmic greyscale is used to emphasize the faint eddies .",
    "we find that the structure of the longslit spectrum depends dramatically on the orientation of the outflow . for most orientations the opening section of the outflow produces a bright , asymmetric , and also opening feature in the spectrum which is often `` v''-shaped .",
    "the eddies generally result in a low brightness , diffuse distribution around the brighter emission arising from the outflow .",
    "llllllll e & & @xmath13 & @xmath14 & @xmath15 & @xmath16 & @xmath17 & @xmath18 + 0 & ( n ) & 350 & @xmath19 & @xmath20 & @xmath21 & 0.6 & 0.02 + 0 & ( s ) & 500 & @xmath22 & @xmath20 & @xmath21 & 0.8 & 0.02 + 0.8 & ( s ) & 500 & @xmath23 & @xmath24 & @xmath25 & 0.7 & 0.02 +    the simulation marked with a dashed rectangle compares quite well with the observed structure in the southern extended emission line region of iras0421 + 0400 . however , the observations show no structures resembling the emission due to the eddies in the simulations ( as shown in more detail in fig .  [ detail.fig ] ) .",
    "we conclude that the emission line gas in iras0421 + 0400 is unlikely to be turbulent on large scales .    in fig .",
    "[ observe.fig ] an axisymmetric simulation is shown which reproduce the observed spectra of the hotspot regions in some detail ( the values of the geometric parameters and the velocity are given in table 1 ) .",
    "we note , however , that part of the simulated red wing of the southern region is too bright compared to the blue wing .",
    "as shown in the same figure , an improvement to this situation is found by introducing an elliptic cross - section and an emissivity cut - off shortly after the flow turns back .    in fig .",
    "[ observe.fig ] we also compare the predicted emission line image in the hotspot region with the corresponding area in the [ oiii ] 5007-  image .",
    "the latter is a composite of three images of 30 minutes exposure time each , obtained at the anglo - australian telescope ( aat ) with an [ oiii ] 5007-  filter ( bandwidth 70 ) .",
    "the seeing was varying between 1 and 2arcsec between the individual exposures .",
    "it confirms the structure observed previously by beichman et al ( 1985 ) , but for the first time shows the predicted `` v''-shape of the northern hotspot region and there is some indication for a similar , though less symmetric structure in the south .",
    "this supports our interpretation of an opening outflow of emission line gas in the hotspot regions .",
    "a simple kinematic model of an opening outflow reproduces the structure found in the longslit emission line spectrum of the hotspot regions in iras0421 + 0400 .",
    "the predicted optical image structure of the same regions is confirmed by recent deep [ oiii ] line - imaging .",
    "if the proposed model of a jet crossing a shocked boundary between the interstellar and intergalactic medium is correct , then iras0421 + 0400 provides a unique possibility to study this phenomenon at optical wavelengths .",
