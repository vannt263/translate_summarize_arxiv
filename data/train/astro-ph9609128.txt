    "the residual radiation from the early universe retains a nearly blackbody spectrum today , allowing for its interpretation as a primeval remnant . while the present spatial anisotropy of the cosmic microwave background radiation ( cmbr ) maps out the positions of small inhomogeneities in the early universe at the epoch of decoupling , spectral distortions in the cmbr carry an imprint of the energetic history of the early universe .",
    "processes releasing energy at redshift @xmath2 ( see @xcite for examples ) can cause distortions in the cmbr spectrum , either by directly altering the photon occupation number or by heating the matter which may then couple to the radiation .",
    "several frequency - dependent processes , including nonradiative and radiative compton scattering and free - free emission , slowly relax the radiation back toward a blackbody spectrum ; thus the frequency signature of any distortion provides clues to both the nature and epoch of its origin .",
    "smoot & scott  1996 give a review of distortions and recent experimental results .",
    "the parameter @xmath3 describes distortions at long wavelengths arising from free - free emission during an epoch of re - ionization , while @xmath4 parameterizes compton distortions ( most noticeable at short wavelengths ) which have not yet undergone much relaxation .",
    "the chemical potential @xmath5 parameterizes distortions in which the cmbr spectrum has relaxed to kinetic equilibrium , but lacks the number of photons needed for a blackbody spectrum",
    ".    the firas instrument on the cobe satellite measured the cmbr spectrum between 60  ghz and 630  ghz very precisely ( @xcite ) , determining  to be @xmath6  k ( 95% cl ) and constraining @xmath7 and @xmath8 . at longer wavelengths ,",
    "existing measurements are substantially less accurate .",
    "all extant data taken together constrain @xmath9 ( @xcite ) . most progress on measurements of or limits on @xmath5 and @xmath3",
    "will now come from improved longer wavelength data .",
    "this paper presents a recent accurate measurement of  at 10.7  ghz .",
    "the balloon - borne apparatus ( figure 1 ) features a cold ( @xmath10  k ) corrugated horn antenna with a @xmath11 fwhm beam coupled through a cold waveguide switch to a total power radiometer .",
    "the switch alternately connects the radiometer to the antenna signal and to an internal temperature - regulated reference load , consisting of iron - loaded epoxy absorber thermally sunk inside a 2.8  kg copper waveguide block .",
    "the load s measured reflection is @xmath12  db .",
    "the switch period is 85 seconds .",
    "the horn antenna views the sky through a thin ( @xmath13 ) polypropylene window which separates the dewar vacuum from the ambient pressure at float ( @xmath14  torr ) .",
    "the input of the radiometer incorporates a cryogenic circulator and a second temperature - regulated load to mitigate errors associated with small differences in the reflection coefficients of the horn and reference load .",
    "the temperatures of the two loads are measured with calibrated germanium resistance thermometers ( lake shore model gr-200a-2500 ) and read out with precision ac bridges . during the flight",
    "these temperatures were stable to better than @xmath15  mk over time scales of several minutes .",
    "additional temperature regulators maintained the switch and the circulator body within @xmath16  mk of the sky signal during flight .",
    "the signal is amplified in a cryogenic 912 ghz hemt amplifier supplied by the nrao .",
    "subsequently , the signal bandpass is limited to 1011  ghz in a fixed room - temperature filter .",
    "two fixed filters and two tunable filters divide the signal into four frequency bands .",
    "one linear polarization is detected . during the flight ,",
    "one of the tunable filters ( with 50  mhz bandwidth ) was continuously stepped through the 1 ghz bandpass to monitor possible radiofrequency interference ; none was seen .",
    "the system noise temperature was @xmath17k .",
    "this paper reports the results from the two fixed filters , with bandpasses @xmath18  ghz ( channel 2 ) and @xmath19  ghz ( channel 3 ) .",
    "the gondola hangs @xmath20 below the balloon , which has a diameter of @xmath21 at float .",
    "the gondola rotated about once a minute for much of the flight , so that the instrument observed a broad swath of the sky .",
    "most of the data were taken with the beam center at a zenith angle of @xmath22 .",
    "the antenna beam has very low , symmetric sidelobes , and is shielded from ambient temperature emission from the earth and the balloon by an inner ground screen attached to the dewar ; with this screen in place , the measured sidelobe response is below @xmath23  db for all angles greater than @xmath24 from the beam axis .",
    "a fixed outer ground screen provides additional rejection of ground radiation .",
    "the instrument was launched from fort sumner , nm , on december 10 , 1995 .",
    "the radio command uplink became intermittent a few minutes after the package reached float altitude , severely restricting the program of measurements .",
    "the data divide into three segments chronologically , according to the zenith angles of observation : the first @xmath22 tip , the @xmath25 tip , and the second @xmath22 tip .",
    "details of these data segments are given in table 1 .",
    "in the latter two data segments , the instrument observed the moon , providing a crosscheck of the pointing , beamsize , and gain .",
    "continuous in - flight gain calibration was accomplished by alternating the temperature of the reference load , @xmath26 , between 2.749  k and 4.091  k at twice the switch period .",
    "the temperature difference between the colder of the two setpoints and the sky was @xmath1  mk , so that the effect of gain errors in determining the sky temperature is negligible .",
    "table 1 includes raw numbers for the temperature of the sky signal , with no corrections for any systematic or instrument effects .",
    "five sources of extraneous signal are described here with estimates of the errors in removing those sources .",
    "the results are summarized in table 2 .",
    "the commanding difficulties precluded planned in - flight measurements of several of these systematic effects , so that calculations are used instead .",
    "however , the experiment design keeps the size of all the corrections small enough to allow for a precise determination of  .      the radiometer operation has been studied with multiple separate cooldown tests in which the sky horn is removed from the dewar and replaced with a second thermally regulated waveguide load , identical in construction to the reference load . in particular , two such calibration tests took place in fort sumner just before the launch .",
    "flight conditions are approximated during these tests by pumping on the helium bath .",
    "if the radiometer were ideal , when the measured temperatures of the two waveguide loads were equal , no differential signal would be observed from the radiometer .",
    "this radiometer instead exhibits offsets of @xmath27  mk and 10  mk in channels 2 and 3 respectively .",
    "four independent measurements of these offsets were made in four separate cooldowns which agree to the relative accuracy of the measurements , about 2 mk . these measured offsets are assumed to apply during the flight . however , since their origin is not yet certain , _ errors equal to the magnitudes of the offsets are assigned to their removal . _      the emission expected from the corrugated horn at 5  k is calculated according to the methods described in clarricoats , olver & chong ( 1975 ) .",
    "the horn was fabricated as a single piece to eliminate the excess emission associated with joints .",
    "the effect of the short waveguide transition coupling the horn to the waveguide switch is included in the calculation , yielding @xmath28  mk .",
    "the errors are conservative estimates .",
    "the measured reflection coefficent of the horn is @xmath29  db and that of the window is @xmath30  db .",
    "since the in - flight circulator load temperature was within 100  mk of the sky and reference load temperatures , differential reflection effects are negligible .",
    "the expected window emission , @xmath31  mk , is interpolated from measurements at other frequencies ( @xcite ) .",
    "the ambient - temperature ( @xmath32  k ) inner ground screen ( igs ) , which is fixed to the dewar , is near enough to the beam to contribute @xmath33  mk to the signal .",
    "the magnitude of this effect was determined after the flight by lining the inner surface of the inner ground screen with microwave absorber and measuring this lining s contribution to the sky signal .",
    "these measurements were made by alternately observing the sky with and without the absorber lining while operating the radiometer at ambient temperature to obviate the need for a thick emissive window on the dewar .",
    "these results were scaled to account for the much lower emissivity of the aluminum relative to the microwave absorber , and the reduced effective emissivity of the absorber at low incidence angles .      when the beam s zenith angle changed from @xmath22 to @xmath25 during the flight , the observed sky temperature increased by @xmath34  mk .",
    "( see table 1 . )",
    "ground calibration tests indicate that the radiometer offset is unaffected by tipping , allowing attribution of @xmath35 to an increase in the total radiation entering the antenna .",
    "the associated atmospheric increase is expected to be @xmath36  mk ( see section 4.4 ) , while the change in astrophysical foreground emissions is @xmath37  mk ( see section 4.5 ) .",
    "the remaining increase in sky temperature , @xmath38  mk , is used to constrain the magnitude of the ground radiation , @xmath39 , entering the antenna during the @xmath22 tip . the largest contribution to",
    "@xmath39 comes from ground radiation diffracting over the front edge of the ground screen .",
    "measured beam patterns of the horn antenna with the igs in place indicate that the received ground pickup from over the front edge should increase by a factor of @xmath40 upon tipping from @xmath22 to @xmath25 .",
    "the small value of @xmath41 therefore implies that @xmath39 is less than 1  mk .",
    "since calculations of diffracted ground signals are notoriously difficult , these estimates have been checked with further measurements on the ground . prior to flight ,",
    "direct measurements were made of the system beam map with both ground shields in place .",
    "the entire gondola was tipped relative to a distance source , with the dewar fixed at several different angles relative to the gondola .",
    "these spot measurements agreed with predictions .",
    "nonetheless , a conservative limit of @xmath42  mk is adopted . in principle radiation from the ground",
    "might reflect off the balloon and into the horn antenna , but since the balloon fills only 0.02  sr and has small reflectivity , this effect is negligible .",
    "extrapolation of the model described by danese & partridge ( 1989 ) to the flight altitude of 25  km , using the standard reference atmosphere for january midlatitudes ( @xmath43n , @xcite ) yields @xmath44  mk at @xmath22 zenith angle .",
    "the average altitude dropped by 1.5  km from the first @xmath22 tip to the second , providing an opportunity to test the model .",
    "the model predicts a 2  mk increase due to this drop ; the measured increase is @xmath45  mk .",
    "the principal celestial foreground emitters are the moon and the galaxy ; the data are also corrected for the dipole of the cmbr , as observed by cobe ( @xcite ) .",
    "the dipole effect varies from @xmath46  mk to @xmath47  mk across the region of sky observed .",
    "the galactic signal is extrapolated from the continuum data at 408 mhz ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) using a spectral index of @xmath48 .",
    "the galactic signal varies from 2  mk to 7  mk in these data .",
    "the galactic signal is removed after binning the data into sky coordinates .    after the position - dependent sum of the dipole and galactic signals is subtracted from the data ,",
    "the sky temperature data for the second two data segments are plotted versus the angle subtended from the beam center to the moon s position .",
    "a gaussian beam profile is then fit to these data , reconfirming the measured beamwidth of @xmath11  fwhm and implying an emission temperature for the moon of 240  k with the moon about three - quarters full .",
    "this fit is used to correct the data for the moon s signal .",
    "all data for which the moon signal is in excess of 10 mk ( 7% of the data ) are excluded from the determination of  .",
    "the average sum of these three foregrounds over the two @xmath22 tips is @xmath49  mk .",
    "the data and their systematic errors are summarized in table 2 .",
    "the final result , averaged over the two bands , is a measurement of  @xmath0  k at 10.7 ghz , a measure accurate to half a percent , made without recourse to space missions .",
    "it is in agreement with a previous measurement of  @xmath50  k at 10  ghz ( @xcite ) , and with the extremely precise firas measurement of  @xmath51  k ( @xcite ) .",
    "several more measurements of  with accuracies comparable to the results described here will significantly tighten the constraints on @xmath5 and @xmath3 .",
