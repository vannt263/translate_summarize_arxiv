    "last decade witnessed a brutal transformation in neutrino physics .",
    "it has been experimentally observed that neutrinos have nonzero masses , implying that leptons blend .",
    "this fact was demonstrated by the experimental evidence that neutrinos can change from one state , or `` flavour '' , to another .",
    "all the information we have accumulated about neutrinos , is quite recent .",
    "less that twenty years old .",
    "neutrino physics as a solid science is in its teenage years and therefore as any adolescence , in a wild and very exciting ( and excited ) state .",
    "however , before jumping into the late `` news '' about neutrinos , lets understand how and why neutrinos were conceived .",
    "the 20s saw the death of numerous sacred cows , and physics was no exemption .",
    "one of physic s most holly principles , energy conservation , apparently showed up not to hold inside the subatomic world .    for some radioactive nuclei , it appeared that a non - negligible fraction of its energy simply vanished , leaving no trace of its presence .    in 1920 , in a ( by now famous ) letter to a meeting @xcite , pauli quasi apologetically wrote,``dear radioactive ladies and gentlemen , ... as a desperate remedy to save the principle of energy conservation in beta decay , ...",
    "i propose the idea of a neutral particle of spin half '' .",
    "pauli hypothesised that the missing energy was taken off by another particle , whose properties were such that made it invisible and impossible to detect : it had no electric charge , no mass and only very rarely interacted with matter . along these lines",
    ", the neutrino was naturally introduced to the universe of particle physics .",
    "before long , fermi postulated the four - fermi hamiltonian in order to describe beta decay utilising the neutrino , electron , neutron and proton .",
    "another field was born : weak interactions took the stage to never leave it .",
    "closing the loop , twenty years after pauli s letter , cowan and reines got the experimental signature of anti - neutrinos emitted by a nuclear power plant .",
    "as more particles who participated in weak interactions were found in the years following neutrino discovery , weak interactions got credibility as an authentic new force of nature and the neutrino got to be a key element of it .    further experimental tests through the span of the following 30 years demonstrated that there were not one but three sort , or `` flavours '' of neutrinos ( electron neutrinos ( @xmath0 ) , muon neutrinos ( @xmath1 ) and tau neutrinos ( @xmath2 ) ) and that , to the extent we could test , had no mass ( and no charge ) whatsoever .",
    "the neutrino adventure could have easily finish there , however new analyses in neutrinos coming from the sun shown us that the neutrino saga was just beginning ....    in the canonical standard model , neutrinos are completely massless and as a consequence are flavour eigenstates ,    @xmath3    precisely because they are massless , they travel at the speed of light and accordingly their flavour does not change from generation up to detection . it is evident then , that as flavour is concerned , zero mass neutrinos are not an attractive object to study , specially when contrasted with quarks .",
    "however , if neutrinos were massive , and these masses where not degenerate ( degenerate masses flavour - wise is identical to the zero mass case ) would mean that neutrino mass eigenstates exist @xmath4 , each with a mass @xmath5 .",
    "the impact of leptonic mixing becomes apparent by looking at the leptonic decays , @xmath6 of the charged vector boson @xmath7 .",
    "where , @xmath8 , or @xmath9 , and @xmath10 refers to the electron , @xmath11 the muon , or @xmath12 the tau .",
    "we call particle @xmath13 as the charged lepton of flavour @xmath14 .",
    "mixing basically implies that when the charged boson @xmath15 decays to a given kind of charged lepton @xmath16 , the neutrino that goes along is not generally the same mass eigenstate @xmath17 . _",
    "any _ of the different @xmath17 can appear .    the amplitude for the decay of a vector boson @xmath15 to a particular mix @xmath18 is given by @xmath19 .",
    "the neutrino that is radiated in this decay alongside the given charged lepton @xmath16 is then @xmath20 this specific mixture of mass eigenstates yields the neutrino of flavour @xmath14 .",
    "the different @xmath21 can be gathered in a unitary matrix ( in the same way they were collected in the ckm matrix in the quark sector ) that receives the name of the leptonic mixing matrix or @xmath22 @xcite .",
    "the unitarity of @xmath23 ensures that each time a neutrino of flavour @xmath14 through its interaction produces a charged lepton , the produced charged lepton will always be @xmath13 , the charged lepton of flavour @xmath24 .",
    "that is , a @xmath25 produces exclusively an @xmath26 , a @xmath27 exclusively a @xmath28 , and in a similar way @xmath29 a @xmath9 .    the expression ( [ eq1 ] ) , portraying each neutrino of a given flavour as a linear combination of the three mass eigenstates , can be easily inverted to depict every mass eigenstate @xmath17 as an analogous linear combination of the three flavours : @xmath30 the amount of @xmath14-flavour ( or the @xmath14-fraction ) of @xmath17 is obviously @xmath31 .",
    "when a @xmath17 interacts and creates a charged lepton , this @xmath14-content ( or fraction ) expresses the probability that the created charged lepton be of flavour @xmath14 .",
    "the phenomenon of neutrino morphing , flavour transition or in short oscillation , can be understood in the following form .    a neutrino is created or emitted by a source along with a charged lepton @xmath16 of flavour @xmath14 . in this way , at the emission point , the neutrino does have a definite flavour .",
    "it is a @xmath32 .",
    "after that point , after production , the neutrino covers some length ( propagates thorough a distance ) @xmath33 until it is absorbed .    at this point ,",
    "when it has already covered the distance to the target , the neutrino interacts and these interactions create another charged lepton @xmath34 of flavour @xmath35 , which we can detect . in this way , at the target , we can know that the neutrino is again a neutrino of definite flavour , a @xmath36 . of course there is a chance that @xmath37 ( for instance , if @xmath13 is a @xmath38 however @xmath34 is a @xmath9 ) , then , all along his journey from the source to the identification point , the neutrino has morphed or transformed from a @xmath32 into a @xmath36 .",
    "this transition from one flavour to the other , @xmath39 , is a canonical case of the widely known quantum - mechanical effect present in a variety of two state systems and not a particular property of neutrinos .",
    "since , as shown clearly by eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) , a @xmath32 is truly a coherent superposition of the three mass eigenstates @xmath17 , the neutrino that travels since it is born until it is detected , can be any of the three @xmath17 s .",
    "because of that , we should include the contributions of each of the @xmath17 in a coherent way . as a consequence , the transition amplitude , amp(@xmath39 ) receives a contribution of each @xmath17 and turns out to be the product of three pieces .",
    "the first factor is the amplitude for the neutrino created at the generation point along with a charged lepton @xmath16 to be , particularly , a @xmath17 . and",
    "as we have said already , it is given by @xmath40 .",
    "the second component of our product is the amplitude for the @xmath17 made by the source to cover the distance up to the detector .",
    "we will name this element prop(@xmath17 ) for the time being and will postpone the calculation of its value until later . the last ( third ) piece is the amplitude for the charged lepton born out of the interaction of the neutrino @xmath17 with the target to be , particularly , a @xmath34 .",
    "being the hamiltonian that describes the interactions between neutrinos , charged leptons and charged bosons @xmath7 bosons hermitian ( otherwise probability wo nt be conserved ) , it follows that if amp(@xmath41 , then amp @xmath42 . in this way",
    ", the third and last component of the product the @xmath17 contribution is given by @xmath43 , and @xmath44        it still remains to be established the value of prop(@xmath17 ) . to determine it , we d better study the @xmath17 in its rest frame .",
    "we will label the time in that system @xmath45 .",
    "if @xmath17 does have a rest mass @xmath5 , then in this frame of reference its state vector satisfies the good old schrdinger equation @xmath46 whose solution is given clearly by @xmath47 then , the amplitude for a given mass eigenstate @xmath17 to travel freely during a time @xmath45 , is simply the amplitude @xmath48 for observing the initial state @xmath17 , @xmath49 after some time as the evoluted state @xmath50 , _ ie . _",
    "@xmath51 $ ] .",
    "thus prop(@xmath17 ) is only this amplitude where we have used that the time taken by @xmath17 to cover the distance from the source to the detector is just @xmath45 , the proper time .    nevertheless ,",
    "if we want prop(@xmath17 ) to be of any use to us , we must write it first in terms of variables we can measure , this means to express it , in variables in the lab frame .",
    "the natural choice is obviously the distance , @xmath33 , that the neutrino covers between the source and the detector as seen in the lab frame , and the time , @xmath52 , that slips away during the journey , again in the lab frame .",
    "the distance @xmath33 is set by the experimentalists through the selection of the place of settlement of the source and that of the detector and is unique to each experimental setting .",
    "likewise , the value of @xmath52 is selected by the experimentalists through their election for the time at which the neutrino is made and that when it dies ( or gets detected ) . therefore , @xmath33 and @xmath52 are determined ( hopefully carefully enough ) by the experiment design , and are the same for all the @xmath17 in the beam .",
    "the different @xmath17 do travel through an identical distance @xmath33 , in an identical time @xmath52 .",
    "we still have two additional lab frame variables to determine , the energy @xmath53 and three momentum @xmath54 of the neutrino mass eigenstate @xmath17 .",
    "by using the lorentz invariance of the four component internal product ( scalar product ) , we can obtain the expression for the @xmath55 appearing in the @xmath56 propagator prop(@xmath17 ) in terms of the ( easy to measure ) lab frame variable we have been looking for , which is given by @xmath57    at this point however one may argue that , in real life , neutrino sources are basically constant in time , and that the time @xmath52 that slips away since the neutrino is produced till it dies in the detector is actually not measured .",
    "this argument is absolutely right . in reality ,",
    "an experiment smears over the time @xmath52 used by the neutrino to complete its route .",
    "however , lets consider that two constituents of the neutrino beam , the first one with energy @xmath58 and the second one with energy @xmath59 ( both measured in the lab frame ) , add up coherently to the neutrino signal produced in the detector .",
    "now , let us call @xmath52 to the the time used by the neutrino to cover the distance separating the production and detection points .",
    "then by the time the constituent whose energy is @xmath60 arrives to the detector , it has raised a phase factor @xmath61 $ ] .",
    "therefore , we will have an interference between the @xmath58 and @xmath59 beam participants that will include a phase factor @xmath62 $ ] .",
    "when smeared over the non - observed travel time @xmath52 , this factor goes away , _ except when @xmath63_. therefore , only those constituents of the neutrino beam that share the same energy contribute coherently to the neutrino oscillation signal @xcite . specifically , only the different mass eigenstates constituents of the beams that have the same energy weight in .",
    "the rest gets averaged out .",
    "courtesy to is dispersion relation , a mass eigenstate @xmath17 , with mass @xmath5 , and energy @xmath64 , has a three momentum @xmath54 whose absolute value is given by @xmath65 where , we have utilised that as the masses of the neutrinos are miserably small , @xmath66 for a typical energy @xmath64 attainable at any experiment ( the lowest energy neutrinos have mev energies and sub - ev masses ) . from eqs .",
    "( [ eq6 ] ) and ( [ eq7 ] ) , it is easy to see that at a given energy @xmath64 the phase @xmath67 appearing in prop(@xmath17 ) takes the value @xmath68 as the phase @xmath69 appears in all the interfering terms it will eventually disappear when calculating the transition amplitude .",
    "after all is a common phase factor ( its absolute value is one ) .",
    "thus , we can get rid of it already now and use @xmath70 ~~ . \\label{eq9}\\ ] ]    plugging this into eq .",
    "( [ eq3 ] ) , we can obtain that the amplitude for a neutrino born as a @xmath32 to be detected as a @xmath36 after covering a distance @xmath33 with energy @xmath64 yields @xmath71 the expression above is valid for an arbitrary number of neutrino flavours and an identical number of mass eigenstates , as far as they travel through vacuum .",
    "the probability p(@xmath39 ) for @xmath39 can be found by squaring it , giving @xmath72 with @xmath73 in order to get eq .",
    "( [ eq11 ] ) we have used that the mixing matrix @xmath23 is unitary .",
    "the oscillation probability p(@xmath39 ) we have just obtained corresponds to that of a _ neutrino _ , and not to an _ antineutrino _ , as we have used that the oscillating neutrino was produced along with a charged _ antilepton _",
    "@xmath74 , and gives birth to a charged _ lepton _ @xmath75 once it reaches the detector .",
    "the corresponding probability p(@xmath76 ) for an antineutrino oscillation can be obtained from p(@xmath39 ) taking advantage of the fact that the two transitions @xmath76 and @xmath77 are cpt conjugated processes .",
    "thus , assuming that neutrino interactions respect cpt@xcite , @xmath78 then , from eq .",
    "( [ eq11 ] ) we obtain that @xmath79 therefore , if cpt is a good symmetry ( as far as neutrino interactions are concerned ) , eq .",
    "( [ eq11 ] ) tells us that @xmath80{1em}{.1 mm } ) }    \\\\ [ -.7ex ] $ \\nu_\\alpha $ }   \\longrightarrow   \\shortstack{{\\tiny ( \\rule[.4ex]{1em}{.1 mm } ) }    \\\\ [ -.7ex ] $ \\nu_\\beta $ } )    & = & \\delta_{\\alpha\\beta } - 4\\sum_{i",

    "as @xmath82 and @xmath39 are cp conjugated processes , p@xmath83 would provide evidence of cp violation in neutrino oscillations ( if nature has chosen its mixing parameters so that the mixing matrix is indeed complex ) .",
    "until now , cp violation has been observed only in the quark sector , so its measurement in neutrino physics would be quite exciting .",
    "so far , we have been working in natural units . a fact that becomes transparent by looking at the dispersion relation eq .",
    "( [ eq8 ] ) .",
    "if we restore now the @xmath84 s and @xmath85 factors ( we have happily set to one ) into the oscillation probability we find that @xmath86 having done that , it is easy and instructive to explore the semi - classical limit , @xmath87 . in this limit",
    "the oscillation length goes to zero ( the oscillation phase goes to infinity ) and the oscillations are averaged to 1/2 . the interference pattern is lost .",
    "a similar situation appears if we let the mass difference @xmath88 become large .",
    "this is exactly what happens in the quark sector ( and the reason why we never study quark oscillations despite knowing that mass eigenstates do not coincide with flavour eigenstates ) .    in terms of real life units ( which are not `` natural '' units ) , the oscillation phase is given by @xmath89 then , since @xmath90 $ ] can be experimentally observed ( _ ie .",
    "_ not smeared out ) only if its argument is in a ballpark around one , an experimental set - up with a baseline @xmath33 ( km ) and an energy @xmath64 ( gev ) is sensitive to neutrino mass squared differences @xmath91 of order @xmath92^{-1}$ ] .",
    "for example , an experiment with a baseline of @xmath93 km , roughly the size of earth s diameter , and @xmath94 gev would explore mass differences @xmath95 down to @xmath96 ev@xmath97 .",
    "this fact makes it clear that neutrino long - baseline experiments can test even miserably small neutrino mass differences .",
    "it does so by exploiting the quantum mechanical interference between amplitudes whose relative phases are given precisely by these super tiny neutrino mass differences , which can be transformed into sizeable effects by choosing @xmath98 appropriately .    but",
    "let s keep analysing the oscillation probability and see whether we can learn more about neutrino oscillations by studying its expression .",
    "it is clear from @xmath99{1em}{.1 mm } ) }    \\\\ [ -.7ex ] $ \\nu_\\alpha $ }   \\longrightarrow   \\shortstack{{\\tiny ( \\rule[.4ex]{1em}{.1 mm } ) }    \\\\ [ -.7ex ] $ \\nu_\\beta $ } ) $ ] that if neutrinos have zero mass , in such a way that all @xmath100 , then , @xmath101{1em}{.1 mm } ) }    \\\\ [ -.7ex ] $ \\nu_\\alpha $ }   \\longrightarrow   \\shortstack{{\\tiny ( \\rule[.4ex]{1em}{.1 mm } ) }    \\\\ [ -.7ex ] $ \\nu_\\beta $ } )   =   \\delta_{\\alpha\\beta}$ ] .",
    "therefore , the experimental observation that neutrinos can morph from one flavour to a different one indicates that neutrinos are not only massive but also that their masses are not degenerate . actually , it was precisely this evidence the one that proved beyond any reasonable doubt that neutrinos are massive .",
    "however , every neutrino oscillation seen so far has involved at some point neutrinos that travel through matter .",
    "but the expression we derived is valid only for flavour change in vacuum , and does not take into account any interaction between the neutrinos and the matter traversed between their source and their detector .",
    "thus , the question remains whether it may be that some unknown flavour changing interactions between neutrinos and matter are indeed responsible of the observed flavour transitions , and not neutrino masses .",
    "regarding this question , a couple of things should be said .",
    "first , although it is true that the standard model of elementary particle physics contains only massless neutrinos , it provides an amazingly well corroborated description of weak interactions , and therefore of all the ways a neutrino interacts .",
    "such a description does not include flavour change .",
    "second , for some of the processes experimentally observed where neutrinos do change flavour , matter effects are expected to be miserably small , and on those cases the evidence points towards a dependence on @xmath33 and @xmath64 in the flavour transition probability through the combination @xmath98 , as anticipated by the oscillation hypothesis .",
    "modulo a constant , @xmath98 is precisely the proper time that goes by in the rest frame of the neutrino as it covers a distance @xmath33 possessing an energy @xmath64 .",
    "therefore , these flavour transitions behave as if they were a true progression of the neutrino itself over time , and not a result of an interaction with matter .",
    "now , lets explore the case where the leptonic mixing were trivial .",
    "this would imply that in the charged boson decay @xmath102 , which as we established has an amplitude @xmath40 , the emerging charged antilepton @xmath16 of flavour @xmath14 comes along always with the _ same _ neutrino mass eigenstate @xmath17 .",
    "that is , if @xmath103 , then due to unitarity , @xmath104 becomes zero for all @xmath105 .",
    "therefore , from eq .",
    "( [ eq15 ] ) it is clear that , @xmath99{1em}{.1 mm } ) }    \\\\ [ -.7ex ] $ \\nu_\\alpha $ }   \\longrightarrow   \\shortstack{{\\tiny ( \\rule[.4ex]{1em}{.1 mm } ) }    \\\\ [ -.7ex ] $ \\nu_\\beta $ } )   =   \\delta_{\\alpha\\beta}$ ] .",
    "thus , the observation that neutrinos morph indicates non trivial a mixing matrix .",
    "then , we are left with basically two ways to detect neutrino flavour change .",
    "the first one is to observe , in a beam of neutrinos which are all created with the same flavour , say @xmath14 , some amount of neutrinos of a new flavour @xmath35 that is different from the flavour @xmath14 we started with .",
    "this goes under the name of appearance experiments .",
    "the second way is to start with a beam of identical @xmath32s , whose flux is either measured or known , and observe that after travelling some distance this flux is depleted .",
    "such experiments are called disappearance experiments .    as eq .",
    "( [ eq15 ] ) shows , the transition probability in vacuum does not only depend on @xmath98 but also oscillates with it .",
    "it is because of this fact that neutrino flavour transitions are named `` neutrino oscillations '' .",
    "now notice also that neutrino transition probabilities do not depend on the individual neutrino masses ( or masses squared ) but on the squared - mass _ differences_. thus , oscillation experiments can only measure the neutrino mass squared spectrum . not its absolute scale .",
    "experiments can test the pattern but can not determine the distance above zero the whole spectra lies .",
    "it is clear that neutrino transitions can not modify the total flux in a neutrino beam , but simply alter its distribution between the different flavours . actually , from eq .",
    "( [ eq15 ] ) and the unitarity of the @xmath23 matrix , it is obvious that @xmath106{1em}{.1 mm } ) }    \\\\ [ -.7ex ] $ \\nu_\\alpha $ }   \\longrightarrow   \\shortstack{{\\tiny ( \\rule[.4ex]{1em}{.1 mm } ) }    \\\\ [ -.7ex ] $ \\nu_\\beta $ } ) = 1 ~~ , \\label{eq17}\\ ] ] where the sum runs over all flavours @xmath35 , including the original one @xmath14 .",
    "( [ eq17 ] ) makes it transparent that the probability that a neutrino morphs its flavour , added to the probability that it keeps the flavour it had at birth , is one .",
    "ergo , flavour transitions do not modify the total flux .",
    "nevertheless , some of the flavours @xmath37 into which a neutrino can oscillate into may be _ sterile _ flavours ; that is , flavours that do not take part in weak interactions and therefore escape detection . if any of the original ( active ) neutrino flux turns into sterile , then an experiment able to measure the total _ active _ neutrino flux  that is , the flux associated to those neutrinos that couple to the weak gauge bosons : @xmath107 , and @xmath29 will observe it to be not exactly the original one , but smaller than it . in the experiments",
    "performed up today , no flux was ever missed .    in the literature ,",
    "description of neutrino oscillations normally assume that the different mass eigenstates @xmath17 that contribute coherently to a beam share the same _ momentum _ , rather than the same _ energy _ as we have argued they must have . while the supposition of equal momentum is technically wrong",
    ", it is an inoffensive mistake , since , as can easily be shown , it conveys to the same oscillation probabilities as the ones we have obtained .",
    "a relevant and interesting case of the ( not that simple ) formula for p@xmath108 is the case where only two flavours participate in the oscillation .",
    "the only - two - neutrino scenario is a rather rigorous description of a vast number of experiments .",
    "in fact only recently ( and in few experiments ) a more sophisticated ( three neutrino description ) was needed to fit observations .",
    "lets assume then , that only two mass eigenstates , which we will name @xmath109 and @xmath110 , and two reciprocal flavour states , which we will name @xmath27 and @xmath29 , are relevant , in such a way that only one squared - mass difference , @xmath111 arises .",
    "even more , neglecting phase factors that can be proven to have no impact on oscillation probabilities , the mixing matrix @xmath23 can be written as @xmath112 the unitary mixing matrix @xmath23 of eq .",
    "( [ eq18 ] ) is just a 2@xmath1132 rotation matrix , and as such , parameterized by a single rotation angle @xmath114 which is named ( in neutrino physics ) as the mixing angle .",
    "plugging the @xmath23 of eq .",
    "( [ eq18 ] ) and the unique @xmath88 into the general formula of the transition probability p@xmath108 , eq .",
    "( [ eq15 ] ) , we can readily see that , for @xmath37 , when only two neutrinos are relevant , @xmath115 moreover , the survival probability , _ ie . _",
    "the probability that the neutrino remains with the same flavour its was created with is , as expected , one minus the probability that it changes flavour .",
    "when we create a beam of neutrinos on earth through an accelerator and send it up to thousand kilometres away to a meet detector , the beam does not move through vacuum , but through matter , earth matter .",
    "the beam of neutrinos then scatters from the particles it meets along the way .",
    "such a coherent forward scattering can have a large effect on the transition probabilities .",
    "we will assume for the time being that neutrino interactions with matter are flavour conserving , as described by the standard model , and comment on the possibility of flavour changing interactions later .",
    "then as there are only two types of weak interactions ( mediated by charged and neutral currents ) the would be accordingly only two possibilities for this coherent forward scattering from matter particles to take place .",
    "charged current mediated weak interactions will occur only if and only if the incoming neutrino is an electron neutrino .",
    "as only the @xmath25 can exchange charged boson @xmath7 with an earth electron . thus neutrino - electron coherent forward scattering via @xmath7 exchange opens up an extra source of interaction energy @xmath116 suffered exclusively by electron neutrinos . obviously , this additional energy being from weak interactions origin has to be proportional to @xmath117 , the fermi coupling constant .",
    "in addition , the interaction energy coming from @xmath118 scattering grows with the number of targets , @xmath119 , the number of electrons per unit volume ( given by the density of the earth ) .",
    "putting everything together it is not difficult to see that @xmath120 clearly , this interaction energy affects also antineutrinos ( in a opposite way though ) .",
    "it changes sign if we switch the @xmath25 by @xmath121 .",
    "the interactions mediated by neutral currents correspond to the case where a neutrino in matter interacts with a matter electron , proton , or neutron by exchanging a neutral @xmath122 boson . according to the standard model weak interactions",
    "are flavour blind .",
    "every flavour of neutrino enjoys them , and the amplitude for this @xmath122 exchange is always the same",
    ". it also teaches us that , at zero momentum transfer , electrons and protons couple to the @xmath122 boson with equal strength .",
    "the interaction has though , opposite sign .",
    "therefore , counting on the fact that the matter through which our neutrino moves is electrically neutral ( it contains equal number of electrons and protons ) , the contribution of both , electrons and protons to coherent forward neutrino scattering through @xmath122 exchange will add up to zero .",
    "consequently only interactions with neutrons will survive so that , the effect of the @xmath122 exchange contribution to the interaction potential energy @xmath123 reduces exclusively to that with neutrons and will be proportional to @xmath124 , the number density of neutrons .",
    "it goes without saying that it will be equal to all flavours .",
    "this time , we find that @xmath125 as was the case before , for @xmath116 , this contribution will flip sign if we replace the neutrinos by anti - neutrinos .",
    "but if , as we said , the standard model interactions do not change neutrino flavour , neutrino flavour transitions or neutrino oscillations point undoubtedly to neutrino mass and mixing even when neutrinos are propagating through matter . unless non - standard - model flavour changing interactions play a role .",
    "neutrino propagation in matter is easy to understand when analysed through the time dependent schrdinger equation in the lab frame @xmath126 where , @xmath127 is a ( three component ) neutrino vector state , in which each neutrino flavour corresponds to one component . in the same way , the hamiltonian @xmath128 is a ( tree @xmath113 three ) matrix in flavour space . to make our lives easy , lets analyse the case where only two neutrino flavours are relevant , say @xmath25 and @xmath27 . then @xmath129 with @xmath130 the amplitude of the neutrino to be a @xmath17 at time @xmath52 .",
    "this time the hamiltonian , @xmath128 , is a 2@xmath1132 matrix in neutrino flavour space , @xmath131 space .    it will prove to be clarifying to work out the two flavour case in vacuum first , and add matter effects afterwards . using eq .",
