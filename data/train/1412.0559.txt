    "for decades open many body quantum systems consisting of a set of many ( @xmath0 ) externally driven two level quantum emitters ( qes ) , e.g. dye molecules or quantum dots , coupled to a lossy cavity / optical mode have been subject to extensive research @xcite .",

    "the exponential number of qe degrees of freedom is reduced by assuming identical emitters with identical couplings and dephasings without any use of further approximations .",
