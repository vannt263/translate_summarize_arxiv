    "it is well known that nonlinear shrdinger ( ns ) equation , similar to celebrated kdv , presents the most universal physical embedding of soliton behavior .",
    "however , its experimental realizations are still rather poor @xcite and rather demonstrate the solitons than introduce a true physical tool for nonlinear phenomena investigations .",
    "the main reason for this is its uni - dimensionality and uni - directionality - the embedding needs some kind of projecting with exact formal and experimental specification .",
    "the important example of the theory is the optical guide ( fiber ) propagation that isolates modes due to boundary conditions in a fiber cross - section and the direction of propagation is fixed by a way in which the waveguide is excited .",
    "so the model based on ns is essentially one dimensional , hence the fiber propagation is perhaps , the best one for physical realization of soliton behavior of electromagnetic wave - train .",
    "nevertheless the existing theory adopts @xcite the model of waveguide propagation , that looks rather  technical  than physical one .",
    "the authors use the parameter of ns equation as empirical ones without explicit expressions dependent on a whole geometry and physics of a waveguide .    in the papers @xcite and @xcite authors investigate polarization behavior of light in a kerr fiber ; additionally the authors of @xcite took into account power exchange between modes .",
    "the authors of these articles declare the complete basis expansion for the problem solution but in fact use simplifications choosing for the basis functions ( for higher order modes ) the gaussian functions .",
    "this approximation is used for nonlinear coefficients ( in our notation @xmath0 ) evaluation .",
    "the formulas for the coupling constants ( @xmath1 in @xcite ) exhibit the fiber radius dependence ( proportional to @xmath2 ) that essentially differs from ours .    by the work @xcite we started the detailed investigations ; we described and discussed a method to derive cnls ( coupled nonlinear schrdinger ) equations for a multi - mode fibers focusing on a mono - mode case ( which leads to ns equations ) and made numerical calculations for it .",
    "we elaborated an approach which do not apply potentials , each component of electromagnetic field in cylindrical coordinates is represented directly as a series in correspondent bessel functions and exponentials @xmath3 .",
    "such scheme introduces natural mode notion in a fiber cross - section which have obvious link with the standard one ( te , tm modes ) .",
    "here we derive cnls equations for two modes ( where @xmath4 and @xmath5 in both cases ) .",
    "information about the parameters allows to derive the explicit dependence of soliton properties on geometry and material constant of a medium .",
    "we use the model of step index waveguide with different refraction indexes ( without assumption of weakly guided fiber like in @xcite ) .",
    "the main result of this part of our study is the analytical expression for mode interaction coefficients that exhibit rather strong dependencies on waveguide radius .",
    "we take the fundamental mode ( which is known from linear a theory as he11 ) considering it and the second mode ( te01 ) as vectors of our basis .",
    "both modes have different group velocities , this difference influence on the coupling coefficients magnitude .",
    "this model could be used in other waveguides with different geometries ( e.g. the elliptical one @xcite ) .",
    "both single - mode fibers with two polarizations and multi - mode fibers are used in optical - switching devices @xcite .",
    "considering two modes with different propagation constants ( this mean @xmath6 ) , we expected that interaction between modes occurs only at the beginning of propagation ( we inquire the propagation to begin from excitation at one of waveguide s ends ) .",
    "this can appear in the strong birefringent photonic crystal fibers ( pcf ) . in a consequence",
    "this interaction can lead to change power intensity of modes .",
    "for example , such properties are very important in case of photonic crystal fibers ( pcf ) or dispersion managed solitons ( dm ) .",
    "it is necessary to point out that in the cylindrical waveguide even three modes can interact : he11 , te01 and tm01 .",
    "modes te01 and",
    "tm01 have the same cut - off frequency and propagation constant @xcite .",
    "this case is very similar to single mode with two polarizations case and we considered this in @xcite . in case of he11 - te01 mode interaction , it is needed to take into account two mode interaction with different propagation constants . in this work we investigate only this ( he11-te01 ) interactions to simplify equations .",
    "we start in the second section from basic equations of linear and some of nonlinear theory of electromagnetic fields . in third section analytical solution of a given problem",
    "is presented . in fourth section",
    "some of numerical calculations for nonlinear coefficients as a function of the guide radius are given .",
    "the last section is a comparison with other cases of analyzed equations and general conclusion is presented .",
    "consider the propagation of optical pulse at isotropic medium and choose a cylindrical dielectric waveguide with small kerr nonlinearity .",
    "the electric field can be written as @xmath7 where @xmath8 .",
    "we introduce a linearly polarized field as @xcite @xmath9 and the polarization vector component as @xmath10a_{z}e^{i\\omega t}\\\\ & + \\frac{1}{3}\\overline{a}_{z}\\left(a_{x}^{2}+a_{y}^{2}\\right)e^{i\\omega t}+ c.c.,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath11 is the complex conjugate of @xmath12 .",

    "however in a multi - mode fiber it has to be taken into account , because different modes have substantially different group velocities .",
    "we describe it introducing the co - ordinate system which moves with average group velocity    [ e : slowcoo ] @xmath24    next step is introducing a slowly varying amplitude of the wave envelope @xcite in the form @xmath25 and @xmath26 have the same unit as electrical field [ v / m ] .",
