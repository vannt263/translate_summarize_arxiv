    "in this paper , we construct a new matrix model which has a _ compact _ @xmath0 symmetry and a chern - simons like structure .",
    "the definition of @xmath0 itself ( i.e. the _ cubic form _ ) is adopted for the construction of the action .",
    "the resulting theory has a chern - simons term in the action as in the case of type @xmath3 ( i.e. the _ trilinear form _ ) @xcite . the _ compactness _ of @xmath0 derives _ the postulate of positive definite metric _ of our model",
    ".    today particle physics except for gravity is well described by the standard model .",
    "however , gravity can not be quantized in the same method because we can not renormalize it .",
    "therefore the main problem of current particle physics is to establish a consistent quantum theory which contains both the standard model and gravity . under these circumstances , the most hopeful and popular candidate is the string theory .",
    "the reason to favor the string theory is its wonderful nature .",
    "we can give as concrete examples that the theory has no ultraviolet divergence and includes gravitational field as well as matter and gauge fields automatically .",
    "however , due to the infinite ground states , this theory has no capability to predict ; therefore we can not answer why the standard model emerges . on the other hand it is possible to consider that this problem is the problem in the framework of perturbative formulation of the theory , because the completed region of the string theory is only the perturbative region .",
    "so if the non - perturbative formulation of the theory is accomplished , it is quite likely that this problem is resolved .",
    "of course , it is pure speculation , but it seems quite probable that the non - perturbative effects turn infinite ground states into single one . in recent years , some kinds of non - perturbative effects of the string theory were investigated using the concepts like d - brane , duality , and m - theory . however these are not constructive definitions of the string theory as yet , but attempts to understand the non - perturbative effects along the line of the perturbation theory .",
    "what must not be forgotten is that one theory never finish before the non - perturbative formulation is completed .",
    "one of candidates for the non - perturbative formulation of the string theory at present is the string field theory .",
    "although a considerable number of studies have been conducted on these theories , the only successful string field theories so far are the ones formulated in the light - cone gauge .",
    "so it is not clear whether we can extract some essential information of the non - perturbative effects .",
    "another candidate is what is called the matrix model .",
    "with the advent of the bfss model @xcite as a starter , many proposals ( e.g.@xcite ) have been being made since .",
    "the common idea of these models is that they reproduce sting or membrane theory in the large-@xmath4 limit . in a sense",
    "the matrix model is similar to the lattice gauge theory , which is the non - perturbative formulation of the field theory , in that they can be analyzed using numerical simulation .",
    "therefore it is reasonable to suppose that we will develop current matrix models a little further and find the true model .",
    "a virtue of the matrix model is that it has a possibility of putting an interpretation on the space - time itself .",
    "however , some important questions such as `` what would be the real mechanism to realize the 4-dimensional world from the 10(or 11)-dimensional universe '' and `` how is the diffeomorphism introduced into the theory '' remain unsettled .",
    "one of them is the question of background independence . consider the ikkt model @xcite for example .",
    "this model has an @xmath5 symmetry , and this is just a symmetry like _ some theory _ was expanded around the flat background . therefore we can not deny the existence of different matrix model whose expansion around a special background gets the ikkt model . on this point smolin",
    "proposed a new type of matrix model @xcite in which the action is cubic in matrices .",
    "matrices are built from the super lie algebra @xmath6 , and one multiplet is pushed into a single supermatrix .",
    "smolin s conjecture is that the expansions around different backgrounds of the @xmath6 matrix model will reduce to the bfss or ikkt model .",
    "however , as far as the ikkt model is concerned , the theory made from smolin s way dose not reproduce the supersymmetry of the ikkt model .",
    "that is , indeed the 10-dimensionality is realized , but the _ half _ of supersymmetry required by the ikkt model can not be held .",
    "anyway , the model described by a single matrix alone is very attractive , and smolin s courageous attempt demonstrated one concrete possibility . afterwards , `` how 10-dimensional ikkt model can be embedded in 11-dimensional smolin s models '' were reconsidered in ref.@xcite .",
    "those arguments were proceeded using group theoretical study on the supersymmetry of the ikkt model . in addition to those ,",
    "one view on the diffeomorphism in the matrix model , a different @xmath7 model from smolin s , and some kind of _ topological _ effective action derived using wigner - inn contraction were also discussed .    moreover , as smolin s @xmath7 model @xcite has demonstrated , the matrix models are not irrelevant to the _ loop quantum gravity _ which is another approach to the theory of everything .",
    "furthermore , it was pointed out in ref.@xcite that the matrix string theory @xcite has a connection with the matrix model based on the exceptional jordan algebra @xmath8 , while b.kim and a.schwarz have discussed in ref.@xcite a tie - in between the ikkt model and the jordan algebra @xmath9 with its spinor representation . for these reasons ,",
    "doing research on extended matrix model is very interesting and important . over and above",
    ", we should not overlook the fact that several approaches which are very similar to the matrix model have been pursued by other fields .",
    "we can take ref.@xcite from the non - commutative geometry , ref.@xcite from the fuzzy sphere , and ref.@xcite from the simplicial lattice for example .",
    "it might be inferred from these circumstantial evidence that the attempt to renounce the space - time as a _ continuum _ holds one important key to the future progress of physics .",
    "it seems at least that there is no need to relate the matrix model to the string theory alone .    for these purposes",
    ", we consider a new matrix model based on the simply connected compact exceptional lie group @xmath0 in this short article .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we briefly review smolin s matrix model based on the groups of type @xmath3 .",
    "after that , in section 3 , our model is presented .",
    "the action of the model is constructed from the _ cubic form _ which is the _ invariant _ on @xmath0 mapping .",
    "this action is an essentially complex action .",
    "of course if one wants , one may take up only real part of the action ; however , there are some circumstantial evidence where it is essential for the theory including gravity to employ complex variables .",
    "ashtekar variables make the constraints of the canonical formalism of general relativity quite easy @xcite .",
    "actually the chiral action is a complex action whose real part agrees with palatini action . besides , the @xmath7 model have also complex action because of the @xmath10 component which is pure imaginary . as in the loop quantum gravity , we may be able to impose the _ reality condition _ on our model .",
    "in addition , it is possible that the action expanded around the vacuum , which is a specific background of the model , gets on - shell real . in this paper",
    ", therefore , we do not restrict the action to real part only .",
    "we proceed with arguments using complex action . in section 4",
    ", we discuss symmetries which our model possesses .",
    "supersymmetry has a deep connection with _ cycle mapping _ @xmath11 . in section 5",
    ", we investigate constraints which are imposed on our model .",
    "the reason why the model is a constrained system is that the group we consider here is the _ compact _ @xmath0 group of the groups of type @xmath0 .",
    "the resulting conditions are quite similar to what we postulate as fundamental properties of inner products of the physical hilbert space . in section 6 , we follow smolin .",
    "we investigate one of the classical solutions of our model , and compactify the theory on the three directions .",
    "our model has twice as many degrees of freedom as smolin s model has because we are considering @xmath0 instead of @xmath3 .",
    "however , we can have the similar argument as smolin @xcite which derives an effective action of the matrix string type .",
    "the paper closes with brief discussions in section 7 . in appendix ,",
    "the author put together an elementary knowledge about the complex graves - cayley algebra @xmath12 and the complex exceptional jordan algebra @xmath13 which are needed for this paper .",
    "however , if the reader has a great interest in the exceptional linear lie groups , see , in particular , a series of excellent reports presented by i.yokota @xcite one time .      on the end of this section ,",
    "let us examine the reason why @xmath0 is better than the groups of type @xmath3 .",
    "although , as early as 1983 , t.kugo and p.townsend referred to the relevance between physics and division algebras @xcite , the reason why the concern with @xmath3 has been growing is that the critical dimension of the string theory is 10 dimensions . the exceptional jordan algebra @xmath8 is a 27-dimensional @xmath14-vector space .",
    "this space can be classified into three main parts .",
    "one is the jordan algebra @xmath9 which is a 10-dimensional @xmath14-vector space .",
    "the others are the part of 16 dimensions which is related to the spinors and the extra 1 dimension . in brief , what are expected as the degrees of freedom of the theory of everything are all involved in this @xmath8 .",
    "the extra 1 dimension may account for the m - theory .",
    "moreover , an important point to emphasize is the fact that the groups of type @xmath3 have some definite geometrical interpretations .",
    "for example , @xmath3 is a subgroup of projective transformation group of graves - cayley projective geometry @xmath15 which corresponds to the _ elliptic _ non - euclidean geometry ; and @xmath16 is a subgroup of projective transformation group of graves - cayley projective geometry which corresponds to the _ hyperbolic _ non - euclidean geometry .",
    "for these reasons , the groups of type @xmath3 are very attractive to us , but there is one flaw in these groups .",
    "that is the fact that elements of @xmath8 do not have an imaginary unit ` @xmath17 ' .",
    "it is true the matrix model is one of candidates for the unified theory .",
    "now may be the state of affairs in the model building , but we will have to account for the standard model someday . fermions which appear in the standard model are weyl spinors , namely _ complex _ spinors . if the standard model were described by using majorana spinors only , @xmath3 might be the underlying symmetry of the universe .",
    "however , the actual world requires _ complex _ fermions without doubt . in the usual string theory",
    ", the real @xmath18-matrices in 10 dimensions can be decomposed by direct products of pauli matrices , so that the appropriate compactification can change 10-dimensional majorana fermions into 4-dimensional weyl fermions . in the approaches using jordan type algebras",
    ", however , it needs care because the elements are non - associative which have no matrix representations .",
    "we can not use above usual trick .",
    "let us take one concrete example . in the case of @xmath6 supermatrix models the bosonic part can be expanded in terms of 11-dimensional @xmath18-matrices with rank 1,2 and 5 @xcite , and in the case of @xmath7 models the bosonic part can be expanded in terms of 11-dimensional @xmath18-matrices with rank 0,1,2,3,4 and 5 @xcite .",
    "these super lie algebras contain the @xmath18-matrices clearly , but the jordan type algebras do not have the usual ( associative ) clifford algebra trivially .",
    "therefore , the complex structure needs to be introduced into the theory from the beginning .",
    "this is the reason why we consider @xmath0 is better than the simply connected compact exceptional lie group @xmath3 . of course , the group @xmath19 is still available , but the model based on @xmath19 is merely the complexification of the smolin s model .",
    "so we attempt to use the _ compact _ @xmath0 group .",
    "the complex exceptional jordan algebra @xmath13 is the complexification of the exceptional jordan algebra @xmath8 .",
    "one must not confuse the complexification of the exceptional lie group with that of the exceptional jordan algebra .",
    "writing down some definitions of the exceptional lie groups is very informative for the comparison .",
    "@xmath20 @xmath21 here , @xmath22 is the _ trilinear form _ , and @xmath23 is the _",
    "cubic form_. the cubic form is very different from the trilinear form , and their concrete forms are given in appendix .",
    "another virtue is that @xmath0 contains @xmath24 .",
    "this is never achieved by type @xmath3 , so this is a very good point of our model .",
    "it is quite likely that other matrix models are reproduced via expansions around specific backgrounds of our model .",
    "in addition , @xmath0 is also interesting from the viewpoint of phenomenology .",
    "on the other hand , the problem now arises :  naturally if we deal with _",
    "compact _ @xmath0 , the degrees of freedom of the theory double because of @xmath13 .",
    "although this problem always follows us as long as we handle _ compact _ @xmath0 , even so , it seems that the benefit of the fact that we can introduce complex structure into the theory exceeds this trouble .",
    "therefore we have to prepare a mechanism separately , which reduces the number of degrees of freedom by half .",
    "this is a future problem which needs to be asked .",
    "in this section , we briefly review smolin s matrix model based on the groups of type @xmath3 @xcite .    the action of smolin s model is given by @xmath25 where @xmath26 are elements of real exceptional jordan algebra @xmath8 , @xmath27 is the cycle mapping of @xmath28 ,   @xmath29 is the _ trilinear form _ , and @xmath30 are the structure constants of @xmath31 which is a lie algebra .",
    "therefore the degrees of freedom of this model live in @xmath32 .",
    "the specific components of @xmath33 are written as @xmath34 where @xmath35 are real numbers , and @xmath36 are elements of graves - cayley algebra .    in this model , following change of variables are required in order to make the theory chern - simons type , @xmath37 and the effective theory of @xmath38 compactified theory of this model is expected to reproduce , at the one loop level , a theory related to the matrix string theory .",
    "we adopt a following definition for the simply connected _ compact _ exceptional lie group @xmath0 .",
    "@xmath39 the second condition @xmath40 is added to the definition to make the group _",
    "we then define our theory by the following action , @xmath41 } \\",

    "compact_.   @xmath46 $ ] denotes the _",
    "weight_-1 anti - symmetrization on indices .",
    "the cubic form can not be coupled to the structure constants as it is , because it is symmetric with respect to the interchange of fields .",
    "the cycle mapping is introduced in order to combine the cubic form with @xmath30 .",
    "the way of constructing this action is basically the same as smolin s case , but the _ invariant _ is different because the group we adopt is different from smolin s .",
    "the _ cubic form _ is employed instead of the _ trilinear form_. of course , the exceptional jordan algebra is not real @xmath47 , but complex @xmath48 . therefore the degrees of freedom of our model live in @xmath1 .",
    "one of the methods to introduce the cosmological term or the coupling constant into the theory is the compactification on directions .",
    "the physical dimensions can also be introduced via this compactification .",
    "up till then , only the units of angle are in existence .",
    "a beauty of this model is that there is no need to change variables intentionally in order to get a chern - simons type action .",
    "the specific components of @xmath49 are written as follows , @xmath50 where @xmath51 are complex numbers , and @xmath52 are elements of complex graves - cayley algebra .    in order to analyze the theory ,",
    "it is necessary to decompose the action in terms of the variables defined in ( [ eq : components ] ) .",
    "this gives us @xmath53 and depending on circumstances , it is helpful to rewrite these expressions using following relations .",
    "@xmath54 of course there is no kinetic term because we are considering the matrix model , but the first term of this action reproduces the chern - simons term .",
    "what has to be noticed is that this chern - simons type action is directly derived from the invariant on @xmath0 .",
    "therefore it is quite likely that one quality of the theory based on @xmath0 is _",
    "topological_.    now , in order to get the equations of motion of this theory , we have to vary with respect to all fields .",
    "we first vary the action with respect to @xmath55 , and the resulting equations are the following .",
    "@xmath56 naturally , the equations of motion are obtained by differentiations with respect to the fields only , because there is no derivative term in the action .",

    "an example of the way is that we impose different boundary conditions when we compactify the theory .",

    "if this algebraically defined theory has a deep connection with some geometry , it must be essentially the _ non - associative geometry_. in particular , it is quite likely that this theory has its geometrical interpretation in the _ projective geometry _ because the group we consider here is the compact @xmath0 group .",

    "the _ compact _ group @xmath0 to some geometry is a very exciting theme .",
    "it is quite likely that the theory based on @xmath0 is closely connected with the topological theory , because although the action was originally constructed from the _ algebraic _ invariant on @xmath0 mapping ( i.e. cubic form ) , it has a form which is similar to the chern - simons theory automatically . to take a hypothetical example",

    "we did not use any approximation , nevertheless the same factor is directly derived from our model .",
    "therefore , it seems quite probable that there exists something like an @xmath136 _ generalized _ loop quantum gravity whose physical state is @xmath139 $ ] .",
    "in this short paper , we have introduced a new matrix model based on the simply connected compact exceptional lie group @xmath0 , and discovered that the chern - simons like term is also derived from the _",
    "cubic form_. this theory modeled itself on smolin s approach based on the groups of type @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "we have adopted the _ cubic form _ in place of the _ trilinear form_. the _ cubic form _ is a quite different cubic linear form from the _ trilinear form_. our model has twice as many degrees of freedom as smolin s model has because we consider _ compact _ @xmath0 instead of @xmath3 .",
    "that point aside , we can have the same argument as smolin which derives an effective action similar to the matrix string theory .",
    "an important point to emphasize is that it is characteristic of @xmath0 and @xmath3 to derive the chern - simons type action using this method , because @xmath140 , @xmath141 and @xmath142 have no cubic linear forms which are made up of the pure exceptional jordan algebra alone just like the _ trilinear form _ on @xmath3 or the _ cubic form _ on @xmath0 .",
    "one way to introduce the cosmological term or the coupling constant into the theory is the compactification on directions .",
    "of course , what we have reported here is just the first step in the analysis of the model , and many things need to be investigated .",
    "however , as we have seen , this model has several very interesting characteristics .",
    "therefore it is quite likely that this theory will evolve in the future .",
    "the problem to be specially considered is the quantization",
    ". it may be difficult to path - integrate as usual because the action of the theory is an essentially complex action .",
    "consequently , it seems that it is necessary to reexamine the _",
    "canonical formalism _ such as the loop quantum gravity .",
    "the author is very interested in the relation between the exponentiated quantity of the action ( [ eq : e_6 ] ) and some kind of quantity like a bi - local expression of dirac equation .",
    "if one point is decided as a fiducial point , another point might be indicated using twistor - like method .    besides ,",
    "because this model is written in ` cubic ' terms with respect to the fields , there can not exist the term such as @xmath143 essentially . in consequence ,",
    "we are inevitably obliged to take the position of the _ induced gravity_. to put it the other way round , however , thanks to being cubic , the theory becomes what is close to the topological theory ; and that is also one of the interesting properties of this model .",
    "namely , there is a strong possibility that this theory is defined as a background independent theory from the very beginning .",
    "therefore it is quite likely that other matrix models such as the bfss model and the ikkt model are reproduced via expansions around specific backgrounds of this model .",
    "moreover , it seems quite probable that this algebraically defined model has a geometrical interpretation .",
    "the existence of the projective geometry can be seen off and on behind the freudenthal multiplication or the cubic form .",
    "although , depending on how things go , we might have to introduce even the freudenthal manifold @xmath144 which is needed to understand the groups of type @xmath141 and type @xmath142 , the attempt to relate this theory to some geometry is one of the most exciting subjects .",
    "furthermore , as discussed in section 5 , the author would like to emphasize that there is considerable validity in considering the physical hilbert space to be a _ product space _ composed of two parts @xmath13 and @xmath31 . because there exists a cycle mapping",
    ", the resulting product space has a structure such that the concept of the spinor is introduced into the infinitely dimensional hilbert space itself .",
    "the author does not believe it is a coincidence .",
    "it is likely that @xmath13 describes some degrees of freedom belonging to some internal structure in the each point of the space , and @xmath31 plays a role of the network to the each point of the space .",
    "what is called _ the postulate of positive definite metric _ is , from the viewpoint of our model , merely an immediate consequence of the fact that our universe is _",
    "compact_.    by the way , we have considered thus far only the combination of the cubic form and the structure constant as an action of the @xmath0 matrix model . from the viewpoint of the construction of invariants , however , we can take not only @xmath145-coupling but also @xmath146-coupling into account , @xmath147 } \\",

    "incidentally , the theories expressed by such actions as ( [ eq : e_6 ] ) and ( [ eq : e_6fd ] ) are the _ global _ @xmath0 matrix models .",
