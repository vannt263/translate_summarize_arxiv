    "resolved images of circumstellar disks around young stars provide the most direct tool for investigating the formation of planets . at millimeter wavelengths , the thermal dust emission is generally optically thin and measures the radial distribution of circumstellar dust @xcite .",
    "however , since circumstellar disks in nearby star forming regions typically have radii between 100 and 500 au , sub - arcsecond angular resolution is required to spatially resolve the dust emission , even in nearby star - forming clouds .",
    "millimeter - wave interferometers are essential for such studies .",
    "since sub - arcsecond observations at millimeter wavelengths require both high sensitivity and high dynamical range , only a small number of bright disks have been observed at resolutions of 0.4 - 1  to date @xcite . the combined array for research in millimeter - wave astronomy ( carma ) and the new extended configuration of the sub - millimeter array are rapidly enabling more extensive high resolution surveys of circumstellar disks , particularly in the taurus and ophiuchus star forming regions ( * ? ? ?",

    "* hereafter paper i ) .",
    "the highest angular resolution achieved so far by millimeter - wave interferometers is 0.3 - 0.4 , corresponding to spatial scales of 40 - 50  au at the distance of taurus and ophiuchus . in most cases",
    ", the dust density appears to increase smoothly inward down to the orbital radius resolved by the observations , typically @xmath325  au .",
    "however , central cavities in the dust distribution are revealed in a number of disks @xcite .",
    "it remains a matter of debate whether these cavities are caused by dynamical interactions , inside out disk dispersal mechanisms , dust opacity variations , or viscous evolution ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* paper i ) .",
    "nevertheless , these observations still lack the angular resolution required to resolve the innermost part of the disk where the density of the circumstellar material is highest and the formation of planets is more probable . here we describe carma observations of the thermal dust emission towards the young stars dg  tau and ry  tau at an angular resolution of 0.15   at 1.3  mm and 0.3  at 2.8  mm . at the distance of taurus",
    "( 140  pc ) , 0.15  corresponds to spatial scales of 20  au , such that emission on orbital scales comparable to saturn can be resolved .",
    "this is more than a factor of two improvement over previous observations of circumstellar disks at these wavelengths .",
    "dg  tau and ry  tau are classical t tauri stars of spectral type m0 and k1 respectively @xcite .",
    "stellar ages inferred from stellar evolutionary models are less than 1  myr ( see paper i for more details and references ) .",
    "the relative youth of both systems is confirmed by the presence of large amounts of gas and dust extending to 0.1  pc and by associated stellar jets and outflows ( see , e.g , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . from near - infrared to millimeter wavelengths ,",
    "both objects exhibit strong emission in excess of that from the stellar photospheres .",
    "this is attributed to rotating disks with radii of few hundred au that first absorb and then re - emit radiation from the central stars .",
    "@xcite . our earlier carma observations of 1.3  mm thermal dust emission from these disks , at a resolution of 0.7 , suggested disk masses between 5 and 150% of the stellar mass for both sources ( see paper i ) . these high disk masses and the youth of ry  tau and dg  tau make these prime targets to investigate the earliest stages of planet formation .",
    "our new observations of ry  tau and dg  tau have a factor of 5 better angular resolution and a factor of 3 better sensitivity than the previous data .",
    "this paper investigates three main questions related to the formation of planets in young circumstellar disks .",
    "( 1 ) what is the surface density distribution in the observed disks down to an orbital radius of 10 au ? ( 2 )",
    "are there any signatures of planet formation contained in the dust distribution ? finally , ( 3 ) , do the dust properties vary with orbital radius ?",

    "the carma correlator at the time of the observations contained three bands , each of which was configured to 468 mhz bandwidth to provide maximum continuum sensitivity .",

    "variations of the atmospheric conditions on time scales shorter than 9 minutes are not corrected , in effect resulting in seeing .",
    "we quantified the atmospheric seeing by measuring the size of the phase calibrator image ; if the seeing is negligible the phase calibrator appears as a point source .",
    "otherwise , the seeing produces a gaussian smoothing that can be quantified through the full width half maximum ( fwhm ) of the resulting image .",
    "we find that at 1.3  mm the effect of seeing is negligible for ry  tau but produces a fwhm of 0.03  for dg  tau .",
    "atmospheric conditions were slightly worse during the 2.8  mm observations , resulting in seeing of 0.07@xmath8 for both objects .",
    "these seeing estimates do not account for variations in the atmospheric conditions on angular scales of 10 , corresponding to the separation between the source and the calibrator .",
    "values for the atmospheric seeing are summarized in table  [ tab : obs ] and are adopted in the model fitting described in section  [ sec : mod ] .",
    "the raw data were reduced using the miriad software package .",
    "the maps of the continuum emission shown in figure  [ fig : cont ] were derived using gildas software .",
    "corresponding complex visibilities are shown in figure  [ fig : uvamp ] . at 1.3 mm , natural weighting of the a",
    ", b and c configuration observations produced a fwhm synthesized beam size of @xmath3 0.15 .",
    "the noise levels are 0.96  mjy / beam and 0.90  mjy / beam respectively for dg  tau and ry  tau .",
    "dust emission at 2.8  mm was observed in the a and b configurations at angular resolution of @xmath3 0.35  and noise levels of 0.45 mjy / beam and 0.28 mjy / beam for dg  tau and ry  tau respectively .",
    "in figure  [ fig : cont ] , the dust emission in both disks is clearly resolved and characterized by a smooth and centrally symmetric radial profile .",
    "dg  tau intensity contours are almost circular suggesting a disk inclination smaller than 30 . for ry  tau , the intensity contours are elongated in the north - east direction suggesting a disk position angle of about 24  measured east from north and a disk inclination of at least 65 .",
    "for both sources the disk orientations agree with those found in paper i.      the 1.3  mm dust continuum emission from the ry  tau disk shows two spatially resolved peaks separated by about 0.2(28  au ) , and oriented along the apparent major axis of the disk .",
    "details of the central 0.4@xmath40.4  region are displayed in the inset in the upper left panel of figure  [ fig : cont ] , and the radial profile of the surface density along the disk major axis is shown in figure  [ fig : radialprofile ] . the intensity at both peaks is 29 mjy / beam , which is 2 mjy / beam ( i.e. 2.2@xmath0 ) higher than the intensity at the center of the disk .",
    "we also estimated the expected central surface brightness by fitting a gaussian to the surface brightness distribution at angular distances larger than 0.15 .",
    "the fitted gaussian is shown as the solid curve in figure  [ fig : radialprofile ] .",
    "a gaussian function was chosen since it provides a reasonable parametric representation of the dust emission .",
    "interpolating this gaussian fit to the center of the disk suggests an expected central surface brightness of 31 mjy / beam , which is 4@xmath0 higher than the measured value .",
    "the significance level of the two intensity peaks , the fact that they appear in the map before cleaning , their orientation along the disk major axis , and the symmetry with respect to the central star , suggest that they are real and , therefore , that the dust emission decreases inside an orbital radius of about 14  au .",
    "this is analogous to the situation in \" transitional  disks , where the inner gaps observed in the dust emission are attributed to dusty depleted inner regions ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "at a first sight , this interpretation is incompatible with ry  tau s large near- and mid - infrared excesses , which suggest the presence of warm dust within 10 au of the star @xcite . if , however , the inner disk is only partially depleted and dust emission remains optically thick in the infrared , the observed double intensity peak and the spectral energy distribution can be reconciled .",
    "a number of physical mechanisms could reduce the dust density in the inner region of circumstellar disks .",
    "for example , planets less massive than jupiter may carve partially depleted gaps in the surface density distribution by tidal interaction with the surrounding material @xcite .",
    "this possibility is discussed in more detail in section  [ sec : surf ] . in paper",
    "i , we also proposed that a surface density profile that gradually decreases towards the star may originate naturally from the viscous evolution of a disk if viscosity decreases with radius .",
    "finally , it is also possible that the decrease in dust emission may originate from a lowering of opacity due to the growth of dust grains to centimeter sizes @xcite .",
    "unambiguously disentangling these models requires even higher angular resolution observations than are yet available .",
    "we must note that radial velocities studies @xcite and hipparcos observations of the variability of the photocenter @xcite suggest that ry  tau is a binary . the hipparcos data implies a minimum projected separation of 23.6 mas and a position angle of 304@xmath534 , almost perpendicular to the position angle of the disk inferred from our observations .",
    "assuming that the binary and the disk have the same inclination , the spatial separation between the binary components is 6 - 9 au , and could explain the double peak in the dust continuum emission .",
    "indeed , the presence of a stellar mass companion orbiting at a radius of 6 - 9  au would push the inner radius of the circumstellar disk to a distance of 9 - 13 au by tidal interactions @xcite .",
    "however , the binary nature of ry  tau has been rendered questionable by near - infrared interferometric observations that suggest an inner disk radius at 0.1  au from the central star and exclude the presence of a stellar mass companion between 0.35 au and 4 au down to a stellar flux ratio of 0.05 @xcite .",
    "a stellar companion was also undetected in recent spectroscopic and aperture masking observations ( duy cuong nguyen and adam kraus private communication ) . as discussed above ,",
    "the spectral energy distribution is also inconsistent with the existence of a large inner gap completely depleted of gas and dust as could be expected for a stellar companion @xcite .",
    "these results suggest that ry  tau is indeed a single star , and the variability observed by hipparcos and the radial velocity variations may be attributed to brightness changes in the circumstellar environment ( see the discussion in * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "a notable characteristic of our images of the dust emission is the high degree of central symmetry and , with the exception of the innermost region , the almost complete absence of features in the surface brightness distribution .",
    "if the emission is optically thin ( we will examine this assumption is section  [ sec : surf ] ) , this translates to a smooth radial profile for the dust .",
    "the degree of symmetry of the emission can be quantified by analyzing the imaginary part of the correlated flux , plotted in figure  [ fig : uvamp ] as a function of the angular frequency @xmath9 .",
    "point symmetric emission will have a zero imaginary part at all spatial frequencies . for ry  tau , the deviations from zero are comparable to the noise in the observations ( see the left panels of figure  [ fig : uvamp ] )     radial profile of the 1.3 mm surface brightness in ry tau disk measured along the major axis of the disk at a position angle of 24  east from north .",
    "the intensity error bars ( red points ) correspond to the noise level of 0.9 mjy / beam .",
    "the solid curve shows a gaussian fit , while the dashed line indicates the zero intensity level .",
    "the bracket in the upper left indicates the angular resolution . ]",
    "the surface brightness distribution for the dg  tau disk has a central peak coincident with the stellar position and smoothly decreases outward to reach the noise level at an angular distance of about 0.5 . at both 1.3 and 2.8 mm",
    "the emission appears fairly symmetric , and indeed the imaginary part of the correlated flux is zero for @xmath10  k@xmath11 ( see upper right panel of figure  [ fig : uvamp ] ) .",
    "the imaginary part increases up to 50 mjy at shorter spatial frequencies , suggesting that the emission may be asymmetric on angular scales larger than @xmath12 . comparing the real and imaginary parts of the correlated flux at the shortest spatial frequencies , we find that the asymmetric part of the emission contributes about 14% to the total flux .",
    "as already noted , the high angular resolution observations of ry  tau and dg  tau allow us to examine disk properties that bear on planet formation .",
    "in particular the radial density profile of the circumstellar material is critical to understanding where planet formation may occur , or where it has occurred . with observations at more than one wavelength , we may also consider radial variations of the grain properties .",
    "as we describe below , measurements of the dust radial profile and the variation of the dust properties with radius are best undertaken by comparing the observations with theoretical disk models in the fourier domain .",
    "there , the effects of different angular resolutions , sensitivity and atmospheric seeing can be more easily taken into account .",
    "moreover , comparison with theoretical models is the only way to quantify the contribution from optically thick emission , leading to an improved estimate of the dust mass .",

    "transition radius_. for @xmath20 , the surface density has a power law profile characterized by the slope @xmath21 , while at larger radii the surface density falls exponentially .",
    "these two different parameterizations are used to calculate the dust emission by solving the structure of an hydrostatic disk heated by the stellar radiation @xcite .",
    "the temperature on the disk mid plane is self - consistently calculated by adopting the _ two layer _ approximation of @xcite .",
    "the disk temperature , which depends mainly on the disk optical depth at optical and infrared wavelengths , is roughly proportional to @xmath22 for both surface density profiles ( see paper i and reference therein for a detailed discussion on the disk temperature radial profile ) .    fundamental to any disk model is the prescription adopted for the dust opacity . although the dust contributes only about 1% to the total disk mass , it dominates the disk opacity in the wavelength range where most of the stellar and disk radiation is emitted .",
    "we assume that the dust size distribution follows a power law @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the radius of a dust grain .",
    "the assumptions on the slope @xmath25 , on the minimum and maximum grain sizes , on the dust chemical composition and on the grain structure define the frequency dependence of the dust opacity @xmath26 , and , ultimately , the disk emission .",
    "the dust opacity is calculated for compact spheres composed of astronomical silicates and organic carbonates @xcite .",
    "we assume a mass ratio of 1 between silicates and organics , which leads to grain density of 2.5 g/@xmath27 .",
    "the dust opacity averaged over the grain size distribution is calculated by fixing the minimum grain size to 0.005 @xmath28 m .",
    "the maximum grain size @xmath29 and the slope @xmath25 are set to reproduce the observed slope of the spectral energy distribution as discussed below .    at millimeter wavelengths",
    "the dust opacity can be approximated by a power law @xmath30 @xcite . if the dust emission is optically thin and the rayleigh - jeans approximation is satisfied , the slope @xmath1 of the dust opacity is related to the spectral index @xmath31 of the observed disk emission @xmath32 ( @xmath33 ) by the relation @xmath34 .",
    "this relation is only approximate if the dust emission is optically thick at some radii . in paper",
    "i , we derived values for @xmath1 of 0.5 and 0.7 for dg  tau and ry  tau respectively from an analysis of the sed , taking into account the optically thick contribution to the total dust emission . for the assumed dust composition and structure",
    ", these values of @xmath1 can be reproduced with different choices of the maximum grain size @xmath29 and the grain size slope @xmath25 ( see appendix  [ app : a ] ) . to investigate how the assumptions on the grain size distribution affect the model fitting , we adopt two different dust models that correspond to the extreme cases of low ( @xmath35 ) and high ( @xmath36 ) opacity .",
    "the corresponding dust opacities at both 1.3  mm and 2.8  mm are given in table  [ tab : dust ] .",
    "finally , we assume that the dust opacity is constant throughout the disk .",
    "this is indeed one of the main assumption we want to test by modeling the observed dust emission at 1.3  mm and 2.8  mm and will be discussed in detail in section  [ sec : betavar ] .",

    "this is mainly because the disk mid - plane temperature @xmath45 varies by only a few percent between the different dust models , as long as the disk is optically thick to the stellar radiation . since @xmath46 , the radial profile of the surface density varies by only small fraction when",

    "by contrast , the surface density normalization ( @xmath18 and @xmath14 ) varies with the dust opacity so that the product @xmath47 remains almost constant if the emission is optically thin .",

    "the ratio @xmath48 is then approximately equal to the ratio between the dust opacities listed in table  [ tab : dust ] .    from the analysis of the surface density of the best fit model we find that the ry  tau emission is always optically thin at both 1.3 and 2.8  mm .",

    "it seems most plausible that both dust composition and the relative contributions of smaller and larger grains change through the disk , contributing to the variation of the dust opacity .",
    "it is clear that better constraints on the radial profile of @xmath1 are required before pushing the investigation further .    in this regard",

    "based on these images , we have addressed three fundamental questions related to the formation of planets in the disk around pre - main sequence stars .",
    "what is the radial density distribution of circumstellar dust ? does the dust emission show any indication of the presence of ( proto)-planets ? do the dust properties vary with orbital radius ?    by analyzing the morphology of the surface brightness of the dust emission and comparing the observations with theoretical disk models , we make the following conclusions :    * both the classical power law disk surface density ( hayashi 1981 ) and the similarity solution for the viscous evolution of a keplerian disk ( hartmann 1998 ) fit the observations well . the surface density is well constrained between 15 and 50 au . in this region ,",

    "this lower bound is a function of the grain composition and increases by almost an order of magnitude between model a and c. for example , in order to have @xmath117 , the maximum grain size must be at least @xmath118 cm for compact grains in model a , or about 0.2  cm for the porous grains in model c. note , however , that we can obtain the same value of @xmath1 with @xmath119 cm and @xmath25 between 3.2 and 3.7 .",
    "deriving the maximum grain size from the measure of @xmath1 is evidently strongly degenerate .",
    "this introduces a large uncertainty on the dust opacity and ultimately on the total mass of circumstellar dust derived from millimeter observations .",
    "even if we limit the analysis to the generally adopted value @xmath120 ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the dust opacity for @xmath121 varies from about 8.4 @xmath40/g of dust in the case of the model a and @xmath122 cm , to 1.2  @xmath40/g of dust for model c and @xmath119  cm , leading to disk masses that differ by almost one order of magnitude .",
    "the color gradient depicts the dust opacity as a function of the maximum grain size @xmath29 and the slope of the grain size distribution @xmath25 .",
    "results are shown for three different dust models ( a , b and c ) as described in the text .",
    "the minimum grain size is fixed at @xmath123  cm .",
    "thin solid curves show the dust opacity contours and are spaced by 0.5 dex .",
    "the thick solid curves show the possible pairs of @xmath116 that lead to values for the opacity slope @xmath1 equal to 0.5 ( dg  tau ) and 0.7  ( ry  tau ) . the letters @xmath36 and @xmath35 indicate the high and low dust opacity models adopted in fitting the observed dust emission .",

    "<S> ( 1 ) what is the radial distribution of the circumstellar dust ? ( 2 ) does the dust emission show any indication of gaps that might signify the presence of ( proto-)planets ? ( 3 ) do the dust properties depend on the orbital radius ?    we find that modeling the disk surface density in terms of either a classical power law or the similarity solution for viscous disk evolution , reproduces the observations well . </S>",

    "<S> the densities inferred from the two models differ by almost an order of magnitude . </S>",
    "<S> the 1.3 mm image from ry  tau shows two peaks separated by 0.2  with a decline in the dust emission toward the stellar position , which is significant at about 2 - 4@xmath0 . for both ry  tau and dg  tau , the dust emission at radii larger than 15 au displays no significant deviation from an unperturbed viscous disk model . in particular </S>",

    "<S> we exclude the presence of planets more massive than 5 jupiter masses orbiting either star at distances between about 10 and 60 au , unless such a planet is so young that there has been insufficient time to open a gap in the disk surface density . </S>",
    "<S> the radial variation of the dust opacity slope , @xmath1 , was investigated by comparing the 1.3 mm and 2.8 mm observations . </S>",
    "<S> we find mean values of @xmath1 of 0.5 and 0.7 for dg  tau and ry  tau respectively . </S>",
    "<S> variations in @xmath1 are smaller than @xmath2 between 20 and 70 au . </S>",
