    "a path towards the experimental realization of a quantum computer has become one of the main focus areas of current quantum information research @xcite . since shor s ground breaking algorithm for factorisation @xcite many quantum algorithms have been designed and studied @xcite . however , in order for the implementation of these algorithms to become a reality it is essential to be capable of creating and manipulating large scale entanglement between effective physical qubits .",
    "one of the primary obstacles in this regard is the interaction of a system with its environment , resulting in dissipation and decoherence @xcite .",
    "classical computer science has provided an effective strategy for combating these destructive effects , on unitary implementations of quantum algorithms , in the form of error - correcting codes @xcite - @xcite .",
    "this approach , based on treating the system - environment interaction as a negative influence , the effect of which needs to be minimized , has been further refined through the introduction of fault tolerant computation @xcite-@xcite .",
    "recently , the culmination of this approach has been achieved in the thresh - hold theorems @xcite which now provide an intelligent measure of our progress towards a large scale quantum computer .",
    "however , a paradigm shift in the approach towards the physical realisation of a quantum computer has recently been introduced .",
    "this shift has arisen as a result of the theoretical prediction that dissipation can in fact be utilized for the creation of complex entangled states @xcite-@xcite and to perform universal quantum computation @xcite-@xcite .",
    "this fundamental shift in approach is based on the assumption that the system environment coupling can be manipulated such that the system is driven towards a steady state which is the solution to a computational task , or a desired entangled state @xcite . within this approach dissipation",
    "is no longer a negative effect , but crucial to the required dynamics .    since the introduction of dissipative state preparation and dissipative quantum computing @xcite-@xcite ,",
    "a large amount of effort has been put into the physical realisation of these ideas , within a broad range of physical systems . in particular ,",
    "cavity qed setups have received a lot of attention @xcite-@xcite , while suggestions have also been made for implementation within atomic ensembles @xcite , trapped ions @xcite and nv centres in diamond @xcite .",
    "importantly , two recent experimental realisations of dissipative state preparation , within macroscopic ensembles @xcite and trapped ions @xcite , have validated the importance of this approach and provided an impetus for further research .",
    "furthermore , since the ground breaking realisation of a two - bit quantum logic gate in 1995 @xcite , the experimental progress within cavity qed has been vast @xcite , and the obstacles presented by dissipation and decoherence well understood .",
    "this progress , coupled with the mass of theoretical progress on dissipative state preparation within cavity qed @xcite-@xcite , motivates the continued study of dissipative state preparation and quantum computing within the context of cavity qed .    in this paper",
    "we suggest a physically realisable scheme for the dissipative preparation of generalised bell states @xcite ,    @xmath0 . for the purposes of this paper we utilise ensembles of @xmath1 atoms within a single optical cavity , as per figure [ arbstatesetup ] .",
    "insight into dissipative mechanisms for the preparation of the generalised bell states ( [ arbtarg1 ] ) and ( [ arbtarg2 ] ) is an important step forward for practical dissipative state preparation , as well as for the development of methods of control for complex open quantum systems .    as in previous suggestions for the dissipative preparation of the maximally",
    "entangled state of two qubits @xcite and a w state of three qubits @xcite , we implement adiabatic elimination , via the effective operator formalism @xcite , in order to obtain a reduced master equation .",
    "the structure of this reduced master equation allows for the identification of effective decay channels , allowing cavity parameters to be engineered such that the target state is prepared efficiently and reliably .",
    "numerical results show that extremely long lived target states can be achieved , utilising cooperativities corresponding to currently available optical cavities .",
    "furthermore , the suggested scheme exhibits excellent scaling characteristics with respect to cooperativity , such that with the development of higher cooperativity cavities @xcite , even better results will be physically achievable .",
    "we consider a cavity qed setup of two distant @xmath1 atoms in a single - mode optical cavity , as per figure [ arbstatesetup ] .",
    "each @xmath1 atom consists of two ground states , @xmath2 and @xmath3 , and an excited state @xmath4 , coupled to the cavity mode .",
    "the hamiltonian for the system is given by    @xmath5    where @xmath6 is the hamiltonian for the excited subspace , @xmath7 the hamiltonian for the ground subspace , @xmath8 the perturbative excitation from the ground space to the excited space and @xmath9 the perturbative de - excitation . as required by adiabatic elimination @xcite ,",
    "which we wish to implement , we restrict ourselves to the single - excitation subspace and find that in the appropriate rotating frame , and the conventional computational basis , the hamiltonian is time independent with individual terms given by    @xmath10    where @xmath11 is as of yet undefined and @xmath12 . as one wishes to prepare an arbitrary state , it is necessary to obtain system dynamics not restricted to a single irreducible subspace of the total hilbert space and hence one requires individual addressing of atoms within the cavity , as opposed to uniform global addressing . in order to achieve this the perturbative excitation @xmath8 is driven by two coherent lasers , the first laser driving the first atom with rabi frequency of @xmath13 and a detuning of @xmath14 , and the second laser driving the second atom with a rabi frequency of @xmath15 but with the same detuning .",
    "the atom - cavity interaction , described by @xmath16 , couples the levels @xmath17 and @xmath3 with a strength of @xmath18 and a uniform phase over both atoms .",
    "atoms in a single - mode optical cavity .",
    "the @xmath19th @xmath1 atom consists of two ground states @xmath20 and an excited state @xmath21 .",
    "each atom experiences individual coherent driving , coupling the levels @xmath2 and @xmath4 , as well as an atom - cavity interaction coupling the levels @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "the system interacts with the environment via spontaneous emission and cavity loss . ]",
    "we assume markovian interaction with the environment , an excellent assumption within quantum optics @xcite , and in addition assume that the system is at zero absolute temperature ( where it is important to note that this assumption is not an obstacle to experimental implementation @xcite ) .",
    "as a result , the system evolves according to a master equation of the form    @xmath22\\nonumber   + \\sum_{k}\\left(\\hat{l}_{k}\\rho \\hat{l}^{\\dagger}_{k } - \\frac{1}{2}\\hat{l}_{k}\\hat{l}^{\\dagger}_{k}\\rho - \\frac{1}{2 } \\rho \\hat{l}^{\\dagger}_{k}\\hat{l}_{k}\\right),\\ ] ]    where @xmath23 are lindblad operators describing the interaction of the system with the environment via cavity loss and spontaneous emission . in the system under consideration ,",
    "as illustrated in figure [ arbstatesetup ] , there are five distinct decay processes . the first decay process , that of cavity loss , is described by lindblad operator @xmath24 , given by    @xmath25    lindblad operators @xmath26 and @xmath27 , given by    @xmath28 } = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\gamma}{2}}|0\\rangle_{1}\\langle e| , \\\\",

    "finally , lindblad operators @xmath32 and @xmath33 , given by    @xmath34 } = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\gamma}{2}}|1\\rangle_{1}\\langle e| , \\\\ \\hat{l}_{5 } = \\hat{l}_{[\\gamma,(2,1 ) ] } = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\gamma}{2}}|1\\rangle_{2}\\langle e|,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    describe spontaneous emission of the first and second atom respectively into the ground state @xmath3 . for simplicity , decay rates into states",
    "@xmath2 and @xmath3 have been set equal , however this is not a necessary requirement @xcite . in order to simplify our description of the system and facilitate the identification of effective decay channels , it is extremely useful to adiabatically",
    "eliminate both atomic and cavity excitations .",
    "we apply adiabatic elimination ( whose requirements are discussed shortly ) , via the effective operator formalism @xcite , in order to obtain a reduced master equation of the form    @xmath35   + \\sum_{k}\\big(\\hat{l}^{k}_{\\mathrm{eff}}\\rho_{g } ( \\hat{l}^{k}_{\\mathrm{eff}})^{\\dagger }     -   \\frac{1}{2}\\hat{l}^{k}_{\\mathrm{eff}}(\\hat{l}^{k}_{\\mathrm{eff}})^{\\dagger}\\rho_{g } - \\frac{1}{2 } \\rho_{g } ( \\hat{l}^{k}_{\\mathrm{eff}})^{\\dagger}\\hat{l}^{k}_{\\mathrm{eff } } \\big),\\ ] ]    where @xmath36 is the density matrix for the _ ground subspace_. the effective operators are given by    @xmath37    with @xmath38 , the non - hermitian hamiltonian combining real detunings of excited levels with imaginary terms corresponding to irreversible decay , given by ,    @xmath39    in order to apply this formalism we will work within the high cooperativity regime @xmath40 and in addition , in order to apply adiabatic elimination ( and motivate a restriction to the single - excitation subspace ) , it is required that we restrict ourselves to the regime of weak driving @xmath41 and simultaneously ensure that the excited energy levels are largely detuned from the ground levels , i.e. , that @xmath14 ( the detuning of the coherent interaction between @xmath2 and @xmath4 ) and @xmath42 ( the detuning of the atom - cavity interaction between @xmath3 and @xmath4 ) are both large , implying @xmath43 .",
    "the relevant subspace of the total hilbert space for this physical situation is    @xmath44    the correct subspace for two @xmath1 atoms within a single - mode optical cavity restricted to the single - excitation subspace .",
    "as we wish to prepare states of the form given in ( [ arbtargstates ] ) , it is convenient to move into the basis    @xmath45    where @xmath46 is the basis for the ground state subspace of ( [ hilbarb ] ) , given by    @xmath47    and for all states @xmath48 in @xmath46 we have naturally defined    @xmath49    with the states in the tensor product describing the atomic state of both atoms and the cavity state respectively .",
    "@xmath50 is the basis for the subspace of states with a single atomic - excitation , given by    @xmath51    where we have defined    latexmath:[\\ ] ]    finally , the effective hamiltonian corresponding to unitary processes consisting of a coherent excitation , intermediate propagation via @xmath73 and a coherent de - excitation , is found to be    @xmath200    where @xmath201 are complicated functions whose exact form is explored in section [ parameter ] .",
