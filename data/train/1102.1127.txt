    "recently the cdf collaboration reported an explicit enhancement structure with 3.1@xmath6 significance in the @xmath7 invariant mass spectrum of the @xmath8 process . in this work ,",
    "we refer to this new enhancement structure by the name @xmath0 .",
    "its mass and width are @xmath9 mev / c@xmath10 and @xmath11 mev / c@xmath10 @xcite , respectively .",
    "we need to specify that this new result appearing in the @xmath7 invariant mass spectrum is based on a sample of @xmath12 collision data at @xmath13 tev with an integrated luminosity of about @xmath14 fb@xmath15  @xcite . additionally , the experiment presented in ref .",
    "@xcite also confirmed the observed @xmath16 previously announced in ref .",
    "@xcite .    before finding the @xmath0 structure , there had been six charmonium - like states observed in @xmath17 meson decays , which include @xmath18 in @xmath19  @xcite , @xmath20 in @xmath21  @xcite , @xmath16 in @xmath22  @xcite , @xmath23 in @xmath24  @xcite , and @xmath25 and @xmath26 in @xmath27 @xcite , where we use the underlines to mark the corresponding decay channels of charmonium - like states observed in experiments .",
    "the evidence of @xmath0 revealed by cdf @xcite not only has made the spectroscopy of charmonium - like states observed in @xmath17 meson decays abundant , but has also stimulated theorists interest in revealing its underlying structure . studying @xmath0",
    "will improve our understanding of the essential mechanism resulting in these structures .",
    "very recently , lhcb also confirmed the observation of @xmath0 with @xmath28 events in the @xmath29 decay @xcite .",
    "since @xmath0 was observed in the @xmath7 invariant mass spectrum , we can conclude that the quantum numbers of @xmath0 are @xmath30 with @xmath31 if @xmath32 occurs via s - wave . if explaining @xmath0 as a candidate of charmonium , @xmath0 should be a p - wave state with the second radial excitation . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the predicted total widths of the second radial excitations of @xmath33 and @xmath34 are larger than the width of @xmath0 .",
    "in addition , @xmath35 , which was observed in the @xmath36 process with mass @xmath37 mev and width @xmath38 mev @xcite , was explained as the candidate of the second radial excitation of @xmath39 @xcite , where the measured parameters of @xmath0 are different from those of @xmath35 .",
    "however , at present we can not fully exclude the p - wave charmonium explanation of @xmath0 , since the uncertainty of the quark pair creation model is not under control @xcite .",
    "besides the conventional charmonium assignment to @xmath0 , @xmath0 as molecular charmonium can be produced by @xmath17 meson decay .",
    "the comparison of the existing experimental information of charmonium - like states observed in @xmath17 meson decays reflects a common property ; i.e. , these charmonium - like states are near the threshold of the corresponding charmed meson pair , which has provoked the investigation of whether these observed charmonium - like states @xmath18 , @xmath23 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath16 , and @xmath0 can be explained as the corresponding molecular charmonia @xcite .",
    "the production of molecular charmonium via the @xmath17 meson decay is allowed .",
    "the @xmath42 pair is created from the color - octet mechanism in the weak decays of the @xmath17 meson ; then @xmath43 and @xmath44 , respectively , capture @xmath45 and @xmath46 to form a charmed meson pair , where a color - octet @xmath47 pair is popped out by a gluon .",
    "thus , a pair of the charmed mesons with low momentum easily interact with each other to form the molecular charmonium @xcite .    as indicated in refs .",
    "@xcite , the mass of @xmath0 is near the threshold of @xmath1 , which is similar to the situations of @xmath16 and @xmath41 , since @xmath16 and @xmath41 are assigned as molecular states of @xmath48 and @xmath49 , respectively @xcite .",
    "thus , it is natural to deduce that @xmath0 can be an s - wave @xmath1 molecular charmonium with the flavor wave function @xmath50,\\label{wavefunction}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which is also supported by the dynamical calculation of its mass when assuming @xmath0 as an s - wave @xmath1 molecular state with spin - parity @xmath51 @xcite .",
    "thus , studying @xmath0 under different assignments will be helpful in distinguishing its possible structure explanations .",
    "in this work , we mainly focus on the decay behavior of @xmath0 as a charmonium - like molecular structure . performing",
    "the study of the decay behavior of @xmath0 can provide crucial information for testing this molecular assignment to @xmath0 .",
    "considering only the preceding reasons and the present theoretical research status of @xmath0 , in this work we investigate the open - charm radiative and pionic decays of @xmath0 , which includes the calculation of the branching ratios and the study of the line shape of these decays .",
    "our study will give hints for further experimental studies of @xmath0 , especially in searching for other decay channels of @xmath0 .",
    "this work is organized as follows .",
    "after this introduction , we illustrate the calculation details of the open - charm radiative and pionic decays of @xmath0 under the assignment of molecular charmonium . in section [ sec3 ] ,",
    "the numerical result will be presented .",
    "the paper ends with the discussion and conclusion .",
    "under the molecular charmonium assignment to @xmath0 , it is interesting to investigate its radiative and pionic decays , since the photon and pion , respectively , from the radiative and pionic decays of @xmath0 can be easily detected in experiments . as a realistic research topic , both a theoretical estimate of their branching ratios and",
    "a study of the line shapes of the photon and pion spectra of the corresponding decays can reflect the internal structure of @xmath0 @xcite .    in this work",
    ", we focus on two groups of decay channels of @xmath0 , i.e. , the radiative ( @xmath52 and @xmath53 ) and pionic ( @xmath54 ) open - charm decays . in what follows ,",
    "we take the decays @xmath55 and @xmath56 as examples to illustrate the relevant calculation . under the @xmath57 molecular state assignment ,",
    "@xmath0 first dissociates into @xmath58 or @xmath59 .",
    "then , the radiative decay @xmath60 and strong decay @xmath61 occur via the transitions @xmath62 and @xmath63 , respectively , where @xmath64 decays into @xmath65 by the @xmath66 mixing mechanism @xcite .",
    "the hadron - level descriptions of @xmath60 and @xmath67 are shown in fig .",
    "[ decay1 ] .    [ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]     for @xmath68",
    ", an accumulation appears in the dalitz plot with photon energy @xmath69 gev and @xmath70 gev , which also reflects that @xmath71 and @xmath72 are from an intermediate state @xmath73 .",
    "the line shape of the photon spectrum of @xmath68 indicates that a very sharp peak exists near the large end point of photon energy , which directly corresponds to the accumulation in the dalitz plot .",
    "the result of the line shape of the pion spectrum for the @xmath74 process shows that a steep peak also exists near the large end point of pion energy , which is similar to the situation of @xmath75 .",
    "more and more observations of charmonium - like states @xmath76 , @xmath77 , @xmath78 in @xmath17 meson decays are providing us with a good platform to intensively study the internal mechanism for producing these charmonium - like states .",
    "this is one of the most important research topics - full of challenges and opportunities - in charm physics @xcite .",
    "stimulated by the recent evidence of @xmath0 @xcite and the proposed @xmath1 molecular charmonium explanation for @xmath0 @xcite , in this work we study the open - charm radiative and pionic decays @xmath75 and @xmath56 , where we not only present the calculation of its decays but also give the line shape of the photon and pion spectra of @xmath75 and @xmath56 in detail .",
    "these theoretical predictions of the decay behavior of @xmath0 provide the information for further experimental studies of @xmath0 .",
    "we emphasize that @xmath56 is peculiar to @xmath0 under the assignment of @xmath1 molecular state , since this decay reflects the internal structure @xmath0 .",
    "@xmath56 occurs via the interaction of @xmath79 with @xmath80 after the collapse of @xmath0 into @xmath81 and @xmath79 , where @xmath82 is a special decay channel observed by experiment @xcite .",
    "thus , the experimental search for a @xmath56 channel and the measurement of the line shape of the pion spectrum of @xmath56 will be an interesting research topic .",
    "we must admit that the predicted partial decay widths of @xmath0 are tiny compared with its total width , which makes the branching ratios of the considered decays about @xmath83 , since the channels considered in this paper are either electromagnetic or isospin violation processes .",
    "although these decay channels of @xmath0 can not be the ideal ones according to the present status of cdf and lhcb , searching for open - charm radiative and pionic decays of @xmath0 could be considered topics for possible efforts in future experiments , such as the forthcoming belleii @xcite and superb @xcite .",
