    "as it is well documented @xcite , increasingly larger sums of iterates of chaotic mappings give rise to a gaussian stationary distribution in the same way independent random variables do according to the ordinary central limit theorem @xcite .",
    "this deep - seated property , remarkably shared by deterministic and random systems composed of essentially uncorrelated variables , naturally raises questions about the existence , and if so , uniqueness or diversity , of limit distributions for systems made up of deterministic correlated variables .",
    "related to these issues recent @xcite-@xcite numerical explorations of time averages of iterates at the period - doubling transition to chaos @xcite have been presented . since the trajectories linked to this critical attractor are nonergodic and nonmixing the question of whether there is such stationary distribution for sums of iterates at the transition to chaos holds added interest as it may provide new angles to appraise the statistical mechanical analogy that is found in chaotic dynamics robledo1 .",
    "the dynamics toward and at the feigenbaum attractor is now known in much detail @xcite , therefore , it appears feasible to analyze also the properties of sums of iterate positions for this classic nonlinear system with the same kind of analytic reasoning and numerical thoroughness . here",
    "we present the results for sums of chronological positions of trajectories associated to  quadratic unimodal maps .",
    "we consider the case of the sum of positions of trajectories inside the feigenbaum attractor as well as those within the chaotic @xmath0-band attractors obtained when the control parameter is shifted to values larger than that at the transition to chaos .",
    "time and ensemble averages differ at the transition to chaos and here we chose to study the time average of a single trajectory initiated inside the attractor since all such trajectories , as explained below , are simply related .",
    "clearly , time and ensemble averages are equivalent for chaotic attractors . from the information",
    "obtained we draw conclusions on the properties of the stationary distributions for these sums of variables .",
    "our results , that reveal a multifractal stationary distribution that mirrors the features of the feigenbaum attractor , can be easily extended to other critical attractor universality classes and other routes to chaos . about the relevance of our findings to physical systems , it is interesting to note , as one example , the parallels that have been found to exist between the dynamics at the noise - perturbed onset of chaos in unimodal maps and the dynamics of glass formation @xcite . in this connection chaotic",
    "band merging plays a central role in the relaxation properties of time correlation functions , while the multifractal attractor and multiband attractors in its neighborhood display the characteristic aging scaling property of glass formers @xcite .",
    "the overall picture we obtain is effectively described within the framework of the renormalization group ( rg ) approach for systems with scale invariant states or attractors .",
    "firstly , the rg transformation for the distribution of a sum of variables is naturally given by the change due to the increment of summands followed by a suitable restoring operation .",
    "second , the limit distributions can be identified as fixed points reached according to whether the acting relevant variables are set to zero or not .",
    "lastly , the universality class of the non - trivial fixed - point distribution can be assessed in terms of the existing set of irrelevant variables .",
    "as it is well known @xcite a few decades ago the rg approach was successfully applied to the period - doubling route to chaos displayed by unimodal maps . in that case",
    "the rg transformation is _ functional composition _ and rescaling of the mapping and its effect re - enacts the growth of the period doubling cascade . in our case",
    "the rg transformation is the _ increment of terms _ and adjustment of the sum of positions and its effect is instead to go over again the merging of bands in the chaotic region .",
    "specifically , we consider the feigenbaum map @xmath1 , obtained from the fixed point equation @xmath2 with @xmath3 and @xmath4 , and where @xmath5 is one of feigenbaum s universal constants @xcite .",
    "( for expediency we shall from now on denote the absolute value @xmath6 by @xmath7 ) .",
    "numerically , the properties of @xmath1 can be conveniently obtained from the logistic map @xmath8 , with @xmath9 @xmath10 .",
    "the dynamics associated to the feigenbaum map is determined by its multifractal attractor .",
    "for a recent detailed description of these properties see @xcite . for values of @xmath11 @xmath12",
    "we employ a well - known scaling relation supported by numerical results .",
    "initially we present properties of the sum of the absolute values @xmath13 of positions @xmath14 , as a function of total time @xmath15 visited by the trajectory with initial position @xmath16 , and obtain a patterned linear growth with @xmath15 .",
    "we analyze this intricate fluctuating pattern , confined within a band of finite width , by eliminating the overall linear increment and find that the resulting stationary arrangement exhibits features inherited from the multifractal structure of the attractor .",
    "we derive an analytical expression for the sum that corroborates the numerical results and provide an understanding of its properties .",
    "next , we consider the straight sum of @xmath17 , where the signs taken by positions lessen the growth of its value as @xmath15 increases and the results are consistently similar to those for the sum of @xmath13 , i.e. linear growth of a fixed - width band within which the sum displays a fluctuating arrangement .",
    "numerical and analytical details for the sum of @xmath17 are presented .",
    "then , we show numerical results for the sum of iterated positions obtained when the control parameter is shifted into the region of chaotic bands . in all of these cases",
    "the distributions evolve after a characteristic crossover towards a gaussian form .",
    "finally , we rationalize our findings in terms of an rg framework in which the action of the central limit theorem plays a fundamental role and provide details of the crossover from multiband distributions to the gaussian distribution .",
    "we discuss our results .",
    "the starting point of our study is the evaluation of @xmath18with @xmath19 and with @xmath16 .",

    "see text.,width=453 ]",
    "we turn now to study the sum of positions of trajectories when @xmath116 @xmath117 .",
    "we recall that in this case the attractors are made up of @xmath0 , @xmath118 , bands and that their trajectories consist of an interband periodic motion of period @xmath0 and an intraband chaotic motion .",
    "we evaluated numerically the sums @xmath119 for a single trajectory with initial condition @xmath16 for different values of @xmath120 .",
    "the sum @xmath121 was then obtained similarly to eq .",

    "4 show the evolution of the distributions for increasing number of summands @xmath15 for a value of @xmath124 ( chosen for visual clarity ) when the attractor consists of @xmath114 chaotic bands .",
    "initially the distributions are multimodal with disconnected domains , but as @xmath15 increases we observe merging of bands and development of a single - domain bell - shaped distribution that as @xmath125 converges in all cases to a gaussian distribution . as a check of the ergodic property of chaotic band attractors we have also evaluated the distributions of sums of positions starting with an ensemble of uniformly - distributed initial positions @xmath102 and obtained results equivalent in all respects to those shown in fig .",
    "faster convergence to the gaussian distribution is achieved in this latter case .",
    "these numerical results can be understood as follows .",
    "we recollect @xcite that the relationship between the number of bands , @xmath0 , @xmath126 , of a chaotic attractor and the control parameter distance @xmath120 at which it is located is given by @xmath127 , @xmath128 , where @xmath129 @xmath130 is the universal constant that measures both the rate of convergence of the values of @xmath131 at period doublings or at band splittings to @xmath12 . for @xmath124 small and fixed ,",
    "the sum of sequential positions of the trajectory initiated at @xmath16 , eq .",
    "( [ sumabs1 ] ) , exhibits two different growth regimes as the total time @xmath15 increases . to specify them we introduce the difference in value @xmath132 between the position at time @xmath42 and the average position within the band @xmath133 occupied at time @xmath42 .",
    "clearly , when @xmath126 the average positions @xmath133 approximate the multifractal positions @xmath134 for @xmath135 .",
    "in the first regime , when @xmath136 , the properties of the sum @xmath119 do not differ qualitatively from those of @xmath112 .",
    "this is because the fine structure of the feigenbaum attractor is not suppressed by the fluctuations @xmath137 , as these contribute to the sum individually during the first cycle of the interband periodic motion .",
    "the discrete multi - scale nature of the distribution for @xmath12 is preserved when the interband motion governs the sum @xmath119 .",
    "the distributions for @xmath121 and @xmath77 are indistinguishable . in the second regime ,",
    "when @xmath138 , the situation is opposite , after many interband cycles the fluctuations @xmath137 add up in the sum and progressively wipe up the fine structure of the feigenbaum attractor , leading to merging of bands and to the dominance of the fluctuating intraband motion . ultimately , as @xmath125 the evolution of the distribution is similar to the action of the central limit theorem and leads to a gaussian stationary end result .",
    "it is also evident that as @xmath124 increases the first regime is shortened at the expense of the second , whereas when @xmath139 the converse is the case .",
    "therefore there exists an unambiguous @xmath124-dependent crossover behavior between the two radically different types of stationary distributions .",
    "this crossover is set out when the @xmath137 fluctuations begin removing the band structure in @xmath121 and ends when these fluctuations have broadened and merged all the chaotic bands and @xmath121 forms a single continuous interval . when @xmath19 this process never takes place .",
    "we are in a position now to put together the numerical and analytical information presented above into the general framework of the rg approach .",
    "as known , this method was designed to characterize families of systems containing amongst their many individual states ( or in this case attractors ) a few exceptional ones with scale invariant properties and common to all systems in the family .",
    "we recall @xcite that in the language of a minimal rg scheme there are two fixed points , each of which can be reached by the repeated application of a suitable transformation of the system s main defining property .",
    "one of the fixed points , is termed trivial and is reached via the rg transformation for almost all initial settings .",
    "i.e. for all systems in the family when at least one of a small set of variables , named relevant variables , is nonzero . to reach the other fixed point , termed nontrivial ,",
    "it is necessary that the relevant variables are all set to zero , and this implies a severely restricted set of initial settings that ensure such critical rg paths .",
    "the nontrivial fixed point embodies the scale invariant properties of the exceptional state that occurs in each system in the family and defines a universality class , while the differences amongst the individual systems are distinguished through a large set of so - called irrelevant variables .",
    "the variables in the latter set gradually vanish as the rg transformation is applied to a system that evolves toward the nontrivial fixed point .",
    "further , when any system in the family is given a nonzero but sufficiently small value to ( one or more of ) the relevant variables , the rg transformation converts behavior similar to that of the nontrivial fixed point into that resembling the trivial fixed point through a well - defined crossover phenomenon .",
    "the recognition of the rg framework in the properties of the sums of positions of trajectories in unimodal maps and their associated distributions is straightforward .",
    "it can be concluded right away that in this problem ( as defined here ) there is only one relevant variable , the control parameter difference @xmath124 .",
    "there is an infinite number of irrelevant variables , those that specify the differences between all possible unimodal maps ( with quadratic maximum ) and the feigenbaum map @xmath1 .",
    "the rg transformation consists of the increment of one or more summands in the sum ( [ sumabs1 ] ) followed by centering like in eq .",
    "( [ sumabs2 ] ) .",
    "the effect of the transformation in the distribution of the sum is then recorded . for sums of independent variables",
    "the transformation is equivalent to the convolution of distributions @xcite .",
    "notice that the transformation  involves no scaling for the sums of positions at @xmath140 .",
    "examination of either fig . 1 or fig .",
    "3 indicates that the values of the sums @xmath27 and @xmath141 are contained within a band of fixed width for all @xmath15 and therefore there should not be any scaling for such sums .",
    "the feigenbaum attractor is not chaotic and its positions @xmath17 are not random variables . on the contrary",
    "the values of the sums @xmath142 and @xmath143 with @xmath144 spread as @xmath15 increases and scaling with a factor @xmath123 maintains their values contained for @xmath145 . in this case",
    "the @xmath17 behave as independent random variables .",
    "there are two fixed - point distributions , the trivial continuum - space gaussian distribution and the nontrivial discrete - space multifractal distribution ( as observed in figs .",
    "1c , 3c and 3d ) .",
    "as explained above , there is a distinct crossover link between the two fixed - point distributions .",
    "our results correspond to the dynamics inside the attractors , however , if the interest lies in considering only the stationary distribution of sums that do not contain the transient behavior of trajectories in their way to the attractor @xcite-@xcite our results are expected to give the correct answers for this case ( see the summary and discussion ) .      in fig .",
    "5 we show a sector of the chaotic bands for the logistic map @xmath146 where we indicate the widths of these bands at the control parameter values @xmath147 when they split each into two new bands .",
    "interestingly , if we assume that for a given value of @xmath148 the widths of comparable lengths have equal lengths then these widths can be obtained from the widths of shortest and longest lengths via a simple scale factor consisting of an inverse power of @xmath7 .",
    "5 . this introduces some degeneracy in the widths that propagates across the band splitting structure .",
    "specifically , the widths scale now with increasing @xmath148 according to a binomial combination of the scaling of those that converge to the most crowded and most sparse regions of the multifractal attractor at @xmath140 . as seen in fig .",
    "5 the widths form a pascal triangle across the band splitting cascade .",
    "the total length @xmath149 of such chaotic @xmath0-band attractor can be immediately evaluated to yield@xmath150(see ref .",
    "@xcite for a similar evaluation relating to the supercycle diameters occurring across the bifurcation tree for @xmath151 ) .",

    "@xcite and @xcite for numerical observations of long - tailed distributions resembling the so - called @xmath164-gaussians @xcite .",
    "in summary , we have found that the stationary distribution of the sum of iterate positions within the feigenbaum attractor has a multifractal structure stamped by that of the initial multifractal set , while that involving sums of positions within the attractors composed of @xmath0 chaotic bands is the gaussian distribution .",
    "we considered only the properties of a single sequence . at this transition the dynamics is nonergodic and nonmixing , therefore the two natural options , ( i ) time average with fixed initial condition and ( ii ) ensemble average of initial conditions at a large fixed time , are non- equivalent .",
    "a third option is to perform both ensemble and time averages .",
    "we chose option ( i ) because all sums with fixed initial positions within the attractor are simply related to each other via a deterministic term ( as explained in section ii ) .",
    "also , option ( i ) allowed us to obtain analytical results in closed form .",
    "for the ergodic chaotic band attractors the choice of a single initial condition leads to the same result as the use of an ensemble .    in refs .",
    "@xcite-@xcite sums of subsequent values of trajectories with uniformly distributed initial values across @xmath165 were computed , and their properties were studied after discarding long transients . in ref .",
    "@xcite transients were  discarded of lengths ranging from 2048 to 65536 and their results are reported to be insensitive to the transient length . a cursory inspection of ref .",
    "@xcite ( with regards to figs . 14 to 18 and",
    "the text associated to them ) makes it evident that after iteration times smaller than the smaller transient discarded in ref .",
    "@xcite the trajectories considered have for all purposes fallen into the attractor .",
    "thus , these sums are exceptionally well reproduced by sums of subsequent values @xmath17 with initial values inside the attractor .",
    "next , when it is taken into account that sums belonging to every such initial value are simply related to that with @xmath16 , it follows that the choice of sums we considered here capture the limiting properties of the sums studied in @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the numerical results that approximate @xmath164-gaussians and/or lvy distributions in @xcite-@xcite may be understood by observing that the power laws in the @xmath166 multifractal distribution ( see fig .",
    "3 ) are preserved at the tails of the distributions throughout the band - merging crossover . only in the limit",
    "@xmath167 the distribution tails become truly exponential .",
    "we have also shown that the entire problem can be couched in the language of the rg formalism @xcite in a way that makes clear the identification of the existing stationary distributions and the manner in which they are reached .",
    "these basic features suggest a degree of universality , and therefore limited to the critical attractor under consideration , in the properties of sums of deterministic variables at the transitions to chaos .",
    "namely , the sums of positions of memory - retaining trajectories evolving under a vanishing lyapunov exponent appear to preserve the particular features of the multifractal critical attractor under examination .",
    "thus we expect that varying the degree of nonlinearity of a unimodal map would affect the scaling properties of time averages of trajectory positions at the period doubling transition to chaos , or alternatively , that the consideration of a different route to chaos , such as the quasiperiodic route , would lead to different scaling properties of comparable time averages .",
    "for instance , the known dependence of the universal constant @xmath7 on the degree of nonlinearity @xmath168 of a unimodal map would show as a @xmath168-dependent exponents @xmath73 and @xmath92 that control the scale invariant property of the sums of trajectory positions with @xmath16 ( shown in figs .",
    "1c , 3c and 3d ) .",
    "it is worthwhile expanding here our previous comment about the applicability of our method to other maps .",
    "for instance , the stationary distributions associated to the prototypical circle map @xcite could be determined similarly , thus extending our study to the route to chaos via quasi - periodicity .",
    "the dynamics at the classic golden mean critical attractor of the circle map exhibits counterparts with the feigenbaum attractor concerning all the basic features that we have made use of here @xcite .",
    "this can be corroborated via comparison of fig .",
    "2 with fig . 3 of @xcite and related text therein .    we have contributed to clarify the nature and the circumstances under which a stationary distribution with universal properties ( in the rg sense ) may arise from sums of deterministic variables at the transition between regular and chaotic behavior , such as those studied here for variables evolving at zero lyapunov exponent . in the absence of the fluctuating element present in chaotic attractors the distribution of the sums of these variables remains defined on a discrete multifractal set and is kept away from becoming a known ( gaussian or otherwise ) continuum - space limit distribution for random variables .",
