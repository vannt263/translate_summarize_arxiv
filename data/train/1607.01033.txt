    "of empirical distributions of financial indices using mixture of gaussian distributinos ( gaussian mixtures ) ( eq .",
    "( [ gm ] ) ) has been recently discussed by tarasenko and artukhov @xcite .",
    "here i provide detailed explanation of steps and methods .",
    "the effective procedure for separation of mixtures was proposed by day @xcite and dempster et al .",
    "@xcite . this procedure is based on maximization of logarithmic likelihood function under parameters @xmath2,@xmath3 , ... , @xmath4,@xmath5,@xmath6 , ... , @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is number of mixture components :    @xmath9    in general , the algorithms of mixture separations based on ( [ emopt ] ) are called estimation and maximization ( em ) algorithms .",
    "em - algorithm consists of two steps : e - expectation and m - maximization .",
    "this section is focused scheme how to construct em - algorithm .",
    "let @xmath10 is defined as posterior porbability of oservations @xmath11 to belong to @xmath12-th mixture component ( class ) :    @xmath13    posterior probability @xmath10 is equal or greater then 0 and @xmath14 for any @xmath15 .",
    "let @xmath16 be a vector of parameters : @xmath16 = ( @xmath2,@xmath3 , ... , @xmath4,@xmath5,@xmath6 , ... , @xmath7 ) .",
    "next , we deompose the logarithms likelihood function into three components :    @xmath17    for this algorithm to work , the initial value @xmath18 is used to calculate inital approximations for posterior probabilities @xmath19 .",
    "this is expectation step .",
    "then values of @xmath19 are used to calculate value of @xmath20 during the maximization step .",
    "each of components ( [ c1 ] ) and ( [ c2 ] ) are maximized independently from each other .",
    "this is possible because component ( [ c1 ] ) depends only on @xmath21 ( @xmath15=1, ...",
    ",@xmath8 ) , and component ( [ c2 ] ) depends only on @xmath22 ( @xmath12=1, ...",
    ",@xmath23 ) .    as a solution of optimization task ( [ optweight ] )    @xmath24    a value of @xmath25 for the iteration @xmath26",
    "is calculated as :    @xmath27    where @xmath28 is iteration number , @xmath28 = 1,2 , , , ,    a solution of optimization task ( [ optdense ] )    @xmath29    depends on a particular type of function @xmath30 .",
    "next we consider solution of optimization task ( [ optdense ] ) , when @xmath30 is gaussian distribution .      here",
    "we employ guassian distributions :    @xmath31    therefore , a specific formula to compute posterior probabilities in the case of gaussian mixtures is    @xmath32    according to the em - algorithm , the task is to find value of parameters @xmath22 = @xmath33 by solving maximization problem ( [ maxloglikegauss ] )    @xmath34    the solution of this mazimization problem is given by eqs .",
    "( [ mean ] ) and ( [ std ] ) :    @xmath35    having calculated optimal values for weights @xmath21 and paramaters @xmath22 ( @xmath12=1, ... ,@xmath8 ) during a single iteration , we apply these optimal values to obtain estimates of posterior probabilities during the expectation step of the next iteration .    as a stop criterion",
    ", we use difference between values of loglikelyhood on iteration @xmath28 and iteration @xmath26 :    @xmath36    where @xmath37 is infinitely small real value .",
    "in this section , i provide several examples of em - algorithm applications to approximate empirical distributions of financial indices with gaussian mixtures .",
    "i consider the following indices : dax , dow jones industrial , nikkei , rtsi , and s@xmath0p 500 .    in figs .",

    "the results presented in this study illustrate that em - algrothim can be effectively used to approximate empiral distributions of log daily differences of financial indices . throughout the data for five selected indices ,",
    "em - algorithm provided very good approximation of empoiral distirbution with gaussian mixtures ."
