    "interaction between the @xmath0 meson and nucleon(s ) has been object of increased interest in recent years  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath1 interaction is closely related to such issues as the nature of the @xmath2 resonance , propagation of the antikaon in nuclear matter , production of strangeness or existence of @xmath0-nuclear quasi - bound states . despite much effort in the last decade  @xcite , the question of kaonic nuclear states is still not resolved .",
    "the @xmath1 interaction has recently been described in the framework of chirally motivated meson - baryon interaction models , parameters of which have been tuned to fit low - energy experimental data . as was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , commonly accepted models provide quite diverse @xmath1 scattering amplitudes below threshold .",
    "however , the amplitudes from this very energy region enter the construction of a @xmath0 -nucleus potential relevant for calculations of kaonic nuclear states .",
    "a distinctive feature of the @xmath3 amplitudes is their strong energy dependence originating from the presence of the @xmath2 resonance , which is generated dynamically in the chiral coupled - channel models of meson - baryon interactions .",
    "it is thus imperative to treat the energy dependence of scattering amplitudes properly and evaluate the @xmath0-nucleus optical potential self - consistently  @xcite .",
    "the chiral meson - baryon interaction models discussed in this work , prague ( p ) @xcite and kyoto - munich ( km ) @xcite , include only @xmath0 absorption on a single - nucleon , @xmath4 ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "calculations of @xmath0-nuclear bound states based solely on these chiral models yield @xmath0 absorption widths quite small due to the proximity of @xmath6 threshold  @xcite .",
    "however , in the nuclear medium @xmath0 multinucleon interactions take place as well  @xcite and their role increases with density and @xmath0 binding energy .",
    "therefore , the @xmath0 multinucleon processes , absorption in particular , have to be taken into account in any realistic assessment of the @xmath0 widths ( to lesser extent also @xmath0 binding energies ) in the nuclear medium . in refs .",
    "@xcite , the @xmath7 absorption was incorporated using a phenomenological potential fitted to kaonic atom data since the applied chiral model did not address such processes .",
    "recently sekihara et al .",
    "@xcite described the non - mesonic @xmath0 interaction channels within a chiral unitary approach for the @xmath8-wave @xmath9 amplitude and evaluated the ratio of mesonic to non - mesonic @xmath0 absorption at rest inside the medium .",
    "the experimental information about this ratio comes from bubble chamber experiments @xcite .",
    "friedman and gal performed fits of kaonic atom data for several recent chirally motivated meson - baryon coupled - channel interaction models @xcite .",
    "subsequent comparison with the single - nucleon fractions of @xmath0 absorption at rest provided strict constraint on the meson - baryon interaction models describing the single - nucleon @xmath0 potential as well as on the corresponding phenomenological @xmath0 multinucleon optical potentials .",
    "only the p and km models were found acceptable by this analysis .    in this work ,",
    "we apply the above two interaction models in calculations of @xmath0- nuclear quasi bound states .",
    "the single - nucleon @xmath0 potential is supplemented by a corresponding phenomenological optical potential which describes @xmath0 multinucleon interactions .",
    "we demonstrate that the @xmath0 multinucleon interactions in the nuclear medium affect crucially the @xmath0 widths .",
    "for the first time , we perform calculations of kaonic nuclear states using @xmath0-nuclear potentials containing both @xmath0 single - nucleon and multinucleon interactions , while the multinucleon potential was fitted for each chiral @xmath10 amplitude model to kaonic atom data separately and further confronted with branching rations of @xmath0 absorption at rest .",
    "the self - consistent calculations of @xmath0-nuclear quasi bound states are based on solving the klein - gordon equation for @xmath0 in the medium @xmath11\\phi_{k^- } = 0~,\\ ] ] which yields kaon binding energies @xmath12 and widths @xmath13 . here",

    "these models capture physics of the @xmath19(1405 ) resonance and reproduce low energy @xmath10 observables , consisting of cross - sections for low - energy @xmath3 processes ( listed in ref .",

    "therefore , we supplement the single - nucleon potential @xmath27 by a phenomenological potential @xmath52 of the form @xmath53 where @xmath54 is a complex amplitude and @xmath55 is a positive number .",

    "the relative contribution of im@xmath27 and im@xmath52 to @xmath0 absorption is changing with radius ( density ) because of the different range of corresponding potentials .",

    "the analysis of friedman and gal  @xcite showed that the fractions of @xmath0 absorption on a single nucleon ( @xmath65 ) and several nucleons ( @xmath66 ) from the bubble chamber experiments are sensitive to about @xmath67 of nuclear density ( denoted in fig .",

    "the ratios @xmath68 are lower than experimental fractions of @xmath0 absorption at rest @xcite due to different self - consistent values of @xmath57 for kaonic and nuclear states",

    "@xcite the single - nucleon @xmath0 potential constructed within the p and km chiral models together with a phenomenological @xmath0 multinucleon potential @xmath52 was confronted with the branching ratios of @xmath0 single - nucleon absorption at rest for the first time .",
    "the fractions of @xmath0 single - nucleon absorption calculated within these two models are in agreement with the data from bubble chamber experiments .    since the kaonic - atom data probe the @xmath0 optical potential reliably up to at most @xmath72 of @xmath62 , two scenarios for extrapolating @xmath52 to higher densities @xmath73 were considered .",
    "moreover , uncertainties of the parameters of the phenomenological @xmath0 multinucleon potentials were taken into account in order to verify that the results are sufficiently robust .",
