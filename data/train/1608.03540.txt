    "chondritic meteorites consist for a large part of 0.1 to 1 millimeter size silicate spherules that were once molten lava droplets .",
    "these so - called chondrules are much larger than the dust grains in the interstellar medium , and thus must have formed in the protoplanetary disk out of which our solar system was created . so far there is no conclusive evidence as to what was the energy source that produced these 2000 k hot lava droplets .",
    "but from the analysis of the textures of these chondrules it is generally concluded that the cooling process was fast : a matter of hours ( hewins et al .  2005 ; see also references in morris & desch 2010 ) .",
    "there are abundant theories of what could be the origin of chondrules , among them are nebular shocks ( e.g.  hood & hornyi , 1991 ; desch & connolly 2002 ; ciesla & hood 2002 ; see also stammler & dullemond 2014 ) , nebular lightning ( horanyi et al .",
    "1995 ; eisenhour & buseck 1995 ; gibbard et al .",
    "1997 ) ; the x - wind model ( shu et al .  2001 ) and flash heating by energy dissipation in current sheets forming in mhd turbulence ( hubbard et al .",
    "there are energy conservation analyses showing that the required energy is a non - negligible fraction of the accretion energy of the protoplanetary disk ( king & pringle 2010 ) .",
    "finally , jacquet et al .  (",
    "2012 ) include mixing processes within the disk in their analysis to see how chondrules produced in different locations disperse and form chondrites .    the alternative theory that chondrules might have originated as a result of planetesimal collisions producing a splash of molten droplets that cooled down to become chondrules ( e.g.  urey 1953 ; kieffer 1975 ; zook 1980 ) has long been dismissed . however",
    ", recently interest in this idea has been revived ( sanders & taylor 2005 ; hevey & sanders 2006 ; asphaug et al .",
    "2011 ; sanders & scott 2012 ; fedkin et al .  2012 ; fedkin & grossman 2013 ; johnson et al .",
    "one of the main problems with the planetesimal collision scenario is that it takes large impact velocities ( @xmath1 km / s ) to generate enough impact heat to melt the rock out of which the planetesimals are made . during the gas - rich phases of the protoplanetary disk ( lasting a few million years ) one would expect that due to friction with the gas the planetesimals have only small eccentricities and inclinations , and thus would collide at much slower speeds , meaning that no melt is produced .",
    "zook ( 1980 ) argued that this problem can be solved if one takes into account that short - lived radionuclides ( in particular @xmath0al ) can heat up planetesimals of @xmath2 km radius beyond the solidus temperature , essentially turning them into spheres of magma with a crust ( hevey & sanders 2006 ; sanders & scott 2012 ) .",
    "a collision would release the magma into a spray of lava droplets , even if the collision speed is moderate .",
    "asphaug et al .",
    "( 2011 ) argued that one can calculate the droplet radius to be consistent with observed sizes if the planetesimals are at least 10 km or more in size .",
    "a potential problem with the pre - molten planetesimals is that they might differentiate if the melting is sufficient , the gravity strong enough and convective mixing not efficient enough .",
    "this would mean that the melt they would release would be very non - solar .",
    "recently johnson et al .  ( 2015 ) therefore revisited the original high - impact - speed idea in which the cloud of droplets is caused by `` impact jetting '' . in this model , initially studied in this context by kieffer ( 1975 ) , pre - melting is not necessary since the impact velocity is high enough to create the melt though shock - heating at the interface between the colliding bodies .",
    "the produced melt will then , under high pressure , escape as a sheet of `` jets '' to the side .",
    "johnson et al .",
    "show that for realistic collision velocities of about 3 km / s only a small fraction of the mass of the impacting bodies ends up in a jet , essentially implying that chondrules are merely a by - product of colliding planets .",
    "they calculate , using monte carlo calculations of planetesimal populations including the effect of eccentricity damping by the nebular gas , that nevertheless a sufficient number of collisions would occur to account for the total mass in chondrules in the asteroid belt .    either way ( pre - melting or high - velocities ) , the impact origin of chondrules is being re - investigated .",
    "a problem with testing the impact hypothesis is that quantitative models of the splash are scarce , because the process is so complex ( see e.g.  asphaug et al .",
    "2011 and johnson et al .",
    "2015 for hydrodynamic simulations ) , making it very hard to make quantiative model predictions for quantities such as cooling times and volatile element retention , which are the kind of data that are obtained from meteoritic studies .    in a previous paper we tried to remedy this by presenting a very simple model of a spherically symmetric ballistically expanding cloud of hot lava droplets that radiatively cool through time - dependent radiative transfer ( dullemond , stammler & johansen 2014 , henceforth paper i ) .",
    "this thermal model provides droplet number densities and temperatures as a function of time and location within the cloud . in the present paper",
    "we will use this model to make model predictions for the abundances of volatile elements in chondrules , and compare this to generic properties of these abundances in chondrites .",
    "the reason for focusing on volatile elements is because the abundances of volatile elements such as na and k in most chondrules is fairly close to solar ( see e.g.  fedkin & grossman 2013 for a discussion ) .",
    "this is surprising given the high temperatures needed to melt rock to form lava .",
    "a millimeter - size lava droplet in vacuum at a temperature of ca .",
    "2000 k would evaporate and lose its na and k within less than a minute .",
    "the fact that we do not see strong depletion of these elements in most chondrules suggests that the chondrules were at those high temperatures only extremely briefly ( tens of seconds at most ) , suggesting rapid heating and subsequent rapid cooling of the chondrules .",
    "this appears to be inconsistent with constraints on cooling rates , which suggest cooling times of the order of hours .",
    "moreover , if evaporation was efficient , one would expect strong isotopic fractionation to occur , which is not observed in chondrules ( cuzzi & alexander 2006 ) .    a very natural way to prevent the loss of volatile elements",
    "is , however , if the chondrules are very close together during their high - temperature formation phase : each chondrule will then have only a limited volume of `` private '' vacuum around it in which it can outgas its volatiles , and the vapor will then quickly reach saturation pressure . or in other words : a chondrule will absorb what another nearby chondrule will evaporate .",
    "this idea was proposed by cuzzi & alexander ( 2006 ) and alexander et al .",
    "( 2008 ) to explain the lack of volatile element depletion and fractionation in chondrules .",
    "they conclude that chondules formed a very dense cloud of hundreds of kilometers across before the chondrules cooled down and became solid .",
    "such high - density clouds of solids are not unnatural in protoplanetary disks . for instance , the streaming instability has been shown to produce extremely high concentrations of solids ( johansen & youdin  2007 ) .",
    "it is , however , very hard to imagine any nebular scenario ( processes happening in the gas - and - dust protoplanetary disk ) which could heat up a large and very dense cloud of proto - chondrules to temperatures of @xmath3 2000 k in a matter of minutes to hours .",
    "the density of such a cloud would be much larger than the gas density of the protoplanetary disk , so that the gas of the disk would not likely be able to release enough energy in a short enough time to heat the proto - chondrules from nebular temperatures ( few hundred kelvin ) to melting tempeature ( ca 2000 k ) .",
    "fedkin & grossman ( 2012 ) , hewins , zanda & bendersky ( 2012 ) and fedkin et al .",
    "( 2013 ) also analyzed the vapor saturation scenario and concluded that impact splashes , in which droplets of molten lava are ejected from an impact event , are the most natural scenario to create these high - density , high - temperature , short - lived environments .",
    "it is the purpose of this series of papers to test this idea with a simple model of a ballistically expanding cloud of droplets that cools through emission of infrared radiation ( paper i ) . here",
    "( paper ii ) we add an evaporation / condensation model to it , but we deliberately keep this evaporation / condensation model simple .",
    "the geo / cosmochemical problem of evaporation / condensation of minerals is actually quite complex , and the above mentioned papers treat this in a much more detailed way .",
    "our simplified treatment aims merely at investigating whether the general scenario is feasible , given a ballistically expanding cloud of droplets .",
    "we find that as the cloud of hot lava droplets moves away from the impact site and expands , the vapor quickly reaches saturation pressure .",
    "if the cloud is large enough then the vapor diffusion time scale would be larger than the expansion time so that during the expansion process the vapor is not escaping .",
    "the total amount of volatile elements in the vapor phase is initially much less than the amount that remains in the solid phase , but under some conditions shortly before the radiative cooling sets in , a non - negligible fraction of the volatile elements are in the gas phase .",
    "as the cloud then cools , the vapor will recondense onto the chondrules . before the expanding cloud becomes too tenuous for recondensation to be effective",
    "all the volatiles have recondensed .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows .",
    "for details on the thermal model we refer to paper i , but we will give a very brief summary in section [ sec - cloud - model ] .",
    "then we will discuss the time - dependent evaporation and condensation model in section [ sec - evapcond ] , which is a simplified version of a more detailed model described in the appendices [ sec - equil - pvap - metal - oxides ] , [ sec - peq - mgfenak ] [ sec - time - dep - evapcond - metal - oxides ] and [ app - janafberman ] . in this section",
    "we also describe the results . finally in section [ sec - discussion ] we will discuss the results and come to a conclusion .",
    "the goal of the simple model of paper i was to compute the density and temperature of the cloud of lava droplets as a function of time after the planetesimal collision .",
    "the dynamics was assumed to be extremely simple : a spherically symmetric homogeneous cloud expanding with a constant rate while it is moving away from the impact site .",
    "the radius of the cloud is thus a linear function of time @xmath4 since the collision : @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the expansion velocity of the cloud .",
    "the density of chondrules in the cloud is then @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the total mass of all chondrules in the cloud .",
    "the temperature of the lava droplets declines with time as soon as they can radiatively cool .",
    "right after the onset of expansion the cloud is still very optically thick , meaning that the radiation can not escape the cloud fast enough .",
    "the temperature thus initially stays constant . only after some time @xmath9 the optical depth drops below some critical value ( which is still well above unity ) below which the radiative diffusive energy loss kicks in and the temperature starts to drop . in paper",
    "i we calculated this time - dependent radiative cooling numerically with a time - dependent radiative transfer algorithm .",
    "we found that these numerical results can be understood and fitted with a simple analytic model .",
    "we briefly describe the model here , and refer to paper i for details .",
    "we consider chondrules ( lava droplets ) of radius @xmath10 and material density @xmath11 .",
    "we take @xmath12 g/@xmath13 for our model .",
    "the mass of a chondrule is then @xmath14 .",
    "the number density of chondrules is @xmath15 . with the simplifying assumption of zero albedo",
    "the absorption opacity is then @xmath16 ( geometric opacity ) .",
    "the optical depth from the center of the cloud to the edge is @xmath17 .    in this paper",
    "we will present our results based on a set of fiducial models as well as parameter scans .",
    "the parameters of the fiducial models are listed in table [ tab - model - param ] .",
    "note that instead of using @xmath8 as the parameter determining the amount of mass in the cloud of droplets , we instead use @xmath18 : the equivalent radius of a sphere of melt with mass @xmath8 , defined through @xmath19 using @xmath18 as parameter is more intuitive than @xmath8 , which is the only reason for using @xmath18 instead of @xmath8 ."
