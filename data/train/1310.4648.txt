    "in last time there is an increasing interest in understanding the properties of @xmath3-matter mainly due to the believe that this type of hadronic matter occurs in astrophysical environment in unconfined form . in the debris of a supernova explosion , a substantial fraction of hot and dense matter resides in @xmath3-particles and therefore the equation of state of subnuclear matter is essential in simulating the supernova collapse and explosions and is also important for the formation of the supernova neutrino signal @xcite .",
    "the basic ingredient in the calculation of the ground state alpha matter @xcite as well in the @xmath4-cluster model of nuclei @xcite is the @xmath0 interaction potential .",
    "this has been studied extensively using both local and nonlocal interactions . among the most important",
    "are those using the resonating group model ( rgm ) @xcite , the energy and angular momentum independent potential model of buck , friedrich and wheatley @xcite and the phenomenological potential of ali and bodmer @xcite .",
    "there have been proposed several versions of the ali - bodmer potential : a gaussian potential with a stronger repulsive component by langanke and mller @xcite , as well a version with a softer repulsive component by yamada and schuck @xcite .",
    "all these models predict potentials quite different in strength and range but all are claimed to reproduce experimental data up the the breakup threshold .",
    "microscopic rgm calculations by schmid and wildermuth @xcite lead to the important conclusion that due to the compact structure and the large binding energy the radius of the @xmath4-particle stays essentially the same during the compound system formation and therefore the polarization effects could be neglected .",
    "this observation substantiates the idea of calculation of a @xmath0 potential from the double folding model .",
    "we propose in this paper to generate the @xmath0 potential within the double folding model using the gogny force as input .",
    "previously sofianos _",
    "et al._@xcite derived the @xmath0 potential using the energy density formalism based on skyrme effective interaction .",
    "however , the potential issued from double - folding calculation , even corrected by knock - on exchange terms , is generally too deep due to the presence of forbidden bound states .",
    "these states have a clear interpretation within the rgm model : they are redundant solutions giving fully antisymmetrized wave functions that vanish identically .",
    "these latter bound states are eliminated thanks to successive supersymmetric transformations as given in @xcite , which preserves the continuous spectrum ( phase - shift ) and resonances @xcite .    in section",
    "* 2 * we present the derivation of the @xmath5 interaction . in section * 3 * the derivation and the properties of supersymmetric partner are presented .",
    "our conclusions are given in section * 4*.",
    "since the potentials providing saturation at lower densities of the alpha matter are highly schematic ( infinite repulsive short - range interactions ) we turn to a calculation of the bare @xmath5 interaction based on the double - folding method for two ions at energies around the barrier , starting with realistic densities of the @xmath4-particle and modern effective nucleon - nucleon interactions .    within the double - folding model @xcite the interaction between two alpha clusters is calculated as a convolution of a local two - body potential @xmath6 and the single particle densities of the two clusters , namely @xmath7    the effective @xmath8 interaction @xmath6 is taken to be density - dependent as expected from a realistic interaction .",
    "it depends on the density @xmath9 of the nuclear matter where the two interacting nucleons are embedded . for the sake of simplicity ,",
    "we choose gaussians interactions in order to have the most tractable analytical calculations . a candidate satisfying this requirement",
    "is provided by the gogny forces @xcite . in this paper , we will report results using three main parametrizations of the gogny interaction @xcite , denoted d1 and d1s @xcite as well as the most recent variant , labeled d1n @xcite .",
    "we remind that the standard form of the gogny interactions is , @xmath10 where @xmath11 , and the coefficients @xmath12 refer to the usual notations for the spin / isospin mixtures and @xmath13 are the spin / isospin exchange operators .",
    "the spin - orbit component , present in the original formulation , is ignored here as it is not material for the @xmath0 system .    for the sake of consistency , i.e. working with gaussian interactions , we consider gaussian one - body density for the @xmath4-particle @xmath14 in eq.([rhoalf ] ) the oscillator parameter @xmath15 is adjusted on the root mean square radius of the @xmath3-particle ( r.m.s . ) given by @xmath16 which has to be compared to the value 1.58 @xmath170.002 fm , extracted from a glauber analysis of experimental interaction cross sections @xcite .",
    "a more involved density matrix was derived by bohigas and stringari @xcite who included short range correlations starting from a jastrow wave function and evaluated the one - body density matrix by using the perturbation expansion of @xcite at a low order .",
    "the diagonal component of the density matrix so far obtained is not far from our density ( [ rhoalf ] ) , and since we want to keep the results as simply as possible we use eq .",
    "( [ rhoalf ] ) .",
    "we have checked that the density eq .",
    "( [ rhoalf ] ) reproduces the experimental charge form factor @xcite up to @xmath18 momentum transfer .",
    "antisymmetrization of the density dependent term in the gogny force is obtained at follows .",
    "consider the operator , @xmath19 since @xmath20 acts only in s - states , one can take safely @xmath21 and using the usual algebra of the exchange operators one obtains , @xmath22 and , @xmath23 the interest is that the total contribution from the density dependence , is calculated from @xmath24 and is independent of the value of the spin mixture @xmath25 .",
    "therefore we take @xmath26 .",
    "the direct spin - isospin independent effective @xmath8 force in the gogny parametrization @xcite reads : @xmath27    inserting the gaussian density distribution ( [ rhoalf ] ) in the double folding integral ( [ dfold ] ) and using a generalization of the campi - sprung prescription @xcite for the overlap density similar to the one proposed in @xcite for @xmath3-nucleus scattering @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the @xmath8 separation in the heavy - ion coordinate system @xcite . with this approximation",
    ", the overlap density does not exceeds the density of the normal nuclear matter at complete overlap and goes to zero when one of the interacting nucleon is far from the other .",
    "we obtain the local @xmath0 potential , @xmath30 which includes both direct and exchange arising from the density dependent component of the force .    the derivation of the knock - on exchange component corresponding to the finite range component of the effective interaction is more involved .",
    "it is convenient to start from the dwba matrix element of the exchange operator : @xmath31 where the sum runs over the single - particle wave functions of occupied states in the projectile ( target ) and @xmath32 is the wave function for relative motion .",
    "after some algebra ( see details in @xcite ) , we arrive at , @xmath33 where the kernel @xmath34 is given by ,    u_ex(,^)=u_ex(^+,^-)=^3v_ex(r^- ) _",

    "we notice that all gogny forces give very close potentials at the surface .",
    "the potentials are tested against high energy experimental data in figure [ figpo ] .",

    "therefore , the question of the uniqueness of the potential is raised .",
    "the question of forbidden states is well - known and has been studied in the supersymmetry approach in @xcite .",

    "we give the straightforward generalization of equations ( 3.3 ) and ( 3.5 ) of @xcite to the case where two bound states are removed simultaneously .",
    "our potential is expected to be energy - dependent because of the perey - saxon approximation .",
    "generally this latter energy dependence is linear and we should apply the derivation of sparenberg , baye and leeb @xcite for linearly energy - dependent potentials . for the sake of simplicity we take the perey - saxon at zero energy and consider the standard derivation of supersymmetric partners @xcite .    here",
    "we consider the case in absence of coulomb potential .",

    "in fact , we will see further , the results are not , in a certain measure , affected by the presence of the coulomb potential .",
    "it is worth to recall that the exact phase @xmath80 can be calculated by using the variable phase method of calogero @xcite . with this method ,",

    "it is a consequence of the levinson theorem ( see above ) .",
    "consequently , the potential is uniquely determined from the phase - shift @xmath117 , given for all positive energies @xcite .",
    "the resonance should be at the right place without any fit .    in practical cases ,",
    "a serious source of uncertainty comes from the fact that the phase shifts are known at a limited number of discrete energies . also , the bare potentials constructed in the above section are too deep and have two non - physical bound s - states .",
    "such deep potentials are not unique : indeed their reconstruction from gelfand - levitan or marchenko procedure @xcite includes the s - wave phase - shifts at all positive energies , the bound states and the corresponding normalization constants eq.([norm ] ) .",
    "we dispose of four free parameters namely , the bound state energies @xmath118 and the associated normalization constants @xmath119 .",
    "we have to adjust them on the position and width of the resonance which eliminates two free parameters .",
    "the potential is not unique and we have a two - parameters family of solutions .",
    "the supersymmetric transformation described above implies a singularity at the origin which is that of a centrifugal barrier of angular momentum @xmath120 , @xmath121 corresponding to the number of removed bound states , here @xmath122 as two bound states are removed .    in a recent paper @xcite it was advocated that the supersymmetric transformation increases the angular momentum by a factor of two in the sense that the jost function @xmath123 , of the starting potential , becomes after removing the bound state @xmath124 , @xmath125    this latter study was made in absence of coulomb potential .",
    "this implies that the @xmath126 matrix of the primitive potential is exactly the @xmath127 matrix of the susy partner ( the potential obtained by removing one bound state ) we then expect that the calogero phase of the susy partner , calculated for the @xmath64-wave is @xmath128 . for two bound state",
    "we will have @xmath129 .",
    "we stress the fact that the s - wave calogero equation ( [ cal ] ) , used to calculate the phase shift for a potential having a singularity at the origin starts from a modified boundary condition .",
    "let be @xmath130 the behavior of the singular potential at small distances , the cauchy condition @xmath131 at small @xmath132 is changed .",
    "this comes from the fact that the calogero variable phase @xmath133 is defined by @xmath134 so that we start from @xmath135 .",
    "we have calculated the difference of phase between our deep potentials and the supersymmetric partners when two bound states are removed and found @xmath136 , even in the presence of the coulomb potential . to conclude our deep potentials supposed to reproduce the experimental phase have all the same s matrix .",
    "this latter is preserved by the supersymmetric transformations ( and then the resonance ) and the resulting susy partners have the same s matrix but for the angular momentum l = 4 . however , when all bound states of the deep potential are removed thanks to supersymmetry the resulting potential is expected to be unique in the following sense . if the deep potential supports n bound states of fixed angular momentum @xmath64 , then the supersymmetric partner , obtained by setting all normalization constants @xmath77 , j = 1 , 2 , ...",
    "n to infinity @xcite , is unique , depending only on the number n of bound states , which determine the singularity at the origin of the susy partner .",
    "consider the physical potentials discussed in section * 2*. these potentials reproduce reasonably well the experimental phase - shift but fail to reproduce the properties of the first @xmath1 resonance in @xmath2be .",
    "this is true also for the ali - bodmer and bfw potentials .",
    "we correct this deficiency by adjusting a global multiplicative factor @xmath137 and judge the success of our model if @xmath138 .",

    "the screened coulomb potential arises from the finite size charge distributions in the @xmath4-particle .",
    "we calculate also the phase @xmath142 for the pure coulomb potential @xmath143 and assume that the difference @xmath144 is the nuclear phase shift in the presence of coulomb potential .",
    "we integrate eq.([cal ] ) up to 500 fm in steps @xmath145 fm and reproduce the exact value of the phase @xmath146 ( @xmath147 ) with high precision .",
