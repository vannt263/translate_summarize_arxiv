    "amongst the evidence for the predominance of wind - accretion is the fact that ellipsoidal variations , characteristic of tidally distorted stars are rarely observed for symbiotic binaries .",
    "however , the general absence of the tidally distorted giants in the symbiotic binaries can be in fact due to the lack of systematic searches for the ellipsoidal variations in the red and near - ir range where the cool giant dominate the continuum light",
    ". this can be best illustrated by the eclipsing symbiotic systems bf cyg ( fig .",
    "1 ) and ci cyg , ( fig .",
    "2 ; mikoajewska 2001 ) . in both systems , during the hot component outburst and its decline , eclipses in the @xmath0 bands are narrow with well - defined eclipse contacts whereas at quiescence very broad minima and continuous nearly sinusoidal variation are observed .",
    "in addition , the quiescent @xmath1 and near - ir light curves show a modulation with half - orbital period as expected for ellipsoidal variability of the red giant .",
    "similar behaviour has been recently found in yy her . in particular , the photometric and spectroscopic study of yy her during the major outburst in 1993 and its decline ( tatarnikova et al .",
    "2001 ) has shown that the minima are due to obscuration of the hot component and the ionized nebula .",
    "the return to quiescence in 1997/98 was accompanied by significant changes in the shape of light curves , and in particular by the appearance of a secondary minimum in the @xmath1 light curves ( fig .",
    "2 ) . tatarnikova et al .",
    "( 2001 ) interpreted the secondary minimum in terms of ellipsoidal changes of the red giant , whereas hric et al .",
    "( 2001 , hereafter h01 ) argued that the secondary minimum is caused by an eclipse of the red giant by a circumstellar envelope around the hot component .",
    "the salient characteristic of the quiescent light curves , namely : ( i ) nearly sinusoidal shape of the @xmath2 light curves ; ( ii ) a flat toped @xmath3 light curve ; and ( iii ) the two minima of almost comparable depth in @xmath4 light , combined with the fact that the quiescent , ultraviolet + optical , spectra of yy her can be satisfactorily matched with a three - component model composed of a cool giant dominating the red spectral range , a gaseous nebula dominating the near uv range , and the hot component predominant in the short uv flux , led us to a simple phenomenological model in which the light changes are described by a combination of variable nebular emission and ellipsoidal changes of the red giant ( mikoajewska et al .",
    "2002a , hereafter m02 ) .",
    "each light curve has been converted to fluxes , @xmath5 , and then independently fitted by the fourier cosine series @xmath6 in the case of @xmath2 data , the best fit is obtained with the @xmath7 term only .",
    "this indicates that the contribution of the giant to the @xmath2 light is negligible , and that all changes can be attributed to the nebular emission . assuming that the amplitude of the nebular emission changes is the same at all wavelengths , @xmath8 , we can separate the contributions of the nebular , @xmath9 , and the giant , @xmath10 , components to the constant @xmath11 .",
    "our best fit models are plotted in fig .",
    "2 .    using the maximum , @xmath12 , fluxes of the nebular component , corrected for the contribution from emission lines and the interstellar reddening the maximum emission measure of the nebula , @xmath13 , has been derived for each band ( see m02 for details ) .",
    "these @xmath13 values , agree with each other to within a factor of 2 , and they cluster around @xmath14 and @xmath15 for @xmath16 and @xmath17 , respectively . the nebular emission measure derived from our light curve analysis requires a lyman continuum luminosity of @xmath18@xmath19 for @xmath16@xmath20 , which agrees with independent estimates for the quiescent @xmath21 to within a factor @xmath22 ( m02 ) .",
    "the magnitudes , and colours of the cool component derived from our light curve analysis , @xmath231.77 , @xmath241.92 and @xmath253.61 , are in excellent agreement with those expected for a moderately reddened m3m4 giant .",
    "moreover , they indicate somewhat higher temperature ( earlier spectral type ) at maxima ( @xmath26 and 0.75 ) than that at minima ( @xmath27 and 0.5 ) as expected for a tidally distorted giant .",
    "one of fundamental questions in relation of symbiotic binaries is the mechanism that powers the z and - type multiple outburst activity observed in many classical symbiotic systems .",
    "the quiescent spectra of these systems can mostly be fitted by a hot stellar source ( most likely a white dwarf powered by thermonuclear burning of the material accreted from its companion ) and its ionizing effect on a nebula .",
    "their outburst activity , however , with time scales of a few / several years can not be simply accounted by the thermonuclear models .",
    "a promising interpretation of this activity involves changes in mass transfer and/or accretion disc instabilities .",
    "detection of an ellipsoidal hot continuum source during outbursts of ci cyg , ax per , yy her , as 338 and other z and - type systems suggests the presence of an optically thick accretion disc which strongly supports this interpretation ( mikoajewska et al .",
    "2002b , and references therein ) related to this problem is the process of mass transfer ",
    "roche lobe overflow or stellar wind  and possibility of an accretion disc formation .",
    "the presence of secondary minima in the light curves of yy her , apparently due to ellipsoidal changes of the red giant , as well as in a few other similar systems provides here important clues .",
    "although it is very premature to claim that all symbiotic systems with the z and - type activity do have tidally distorted giants , and  at least during active phase  accretion discs , whereas the non - eruptive systems ( such as rw hya ) do not , the former is certainly the case for yy her , ci cyg , bf cyg and a few other active systems .",
    "systematic searches for the ellipsoidal variations in both active and non - eruptive symbiotic stars are necessary to address the problem , and confirm or exclude tidally distorted giants .",
    "the observations must be , however , carried in the red and near - ir range where the cool giant dominated the continuum light .",
    "we also note that any optical / red light curve analysis must be supported by spectroscopic information about contamination of the broad - band photometry by the nebular component .",
