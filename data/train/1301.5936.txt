    "cataclysmic variables ( cvs ) are interacting binary systems in which a white dwarf ( wd ) is accreting material from a low - mass companion star .",
    "if the wd has a sufficiently strong magnetic field , the formation of an accretion disk is inhibited , and material accretes directly onto one or more magnetic poles of the white dwarf .",
    "these binaries are known as am her systems or polars , after the high fraction of polarized light detected in the systems .",
    "the identification of cvs in star clusters provides interesting constraints on the formation and evolution of the interacting system . as all members of an cluster are coeval , the total age of the system is known , as is the system s distance and metallicity .",
    "further , if the mass and effective temperature of the white dwarf can be determined , then a limit on the white dwarf s progenitor mass can be derived via the same methods used to construct the initial - final mass relation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "because the white dwarf is likely re - heated to some extent by the ongoing accretion , the constraint on the progenitor mass would be strictly a lower limit .",
    "cvs are quite common in globular clusters ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the globular cv population tends to be centrally concentrated ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this result is likely explained by the formation of tight binaries by stellar encounters in globular cluster cores ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . as such , globular cluster cvs are excellent tracers of a globular s dynamic history , but",
    "these cvs may not shed much light on the formation and evolution of cvs in the galactic field where stellar encounters are rare .",
    "open star clusters may therefore be a more useful laboratory for studying cv evolution .",
    "the stellar densities are far lower than in globular clusters , even in the cluster core , and dynamical simulations suggest that cv formation is not enhanced by the stellar encounters that do occur @xcite , though a small fraction of open cluster cvs may still be formed by stellar exchanges @xcite .",
    "open clusters also span a wide range of ages , metallicities , and stellar masses , raising the potential to study how these parameters impact cv formation and evolution more precisely than possible from studies of field cvs .",
    "unfortunately , the number of cvs in open clusters is small , and none are well - studied . in the ancient , dense , metal - rich open cluster , two spectroscopically - confirmed cvs are known @xcite ; identify a suspected third cluster cv based on photometric properties and conclude that all three cvs are likely cluster members .",
    "one cv , , is known in the open cluster m67 and described in detail below .",
    "these four objects are the only _ confirmed cluster member _ cvs , and due to the large distances of the clusters [ @xmath3 for ngc 6791 and @xmath4 for m67 ] , spectroscopic studies of these cvs with the same precision and the same techniques ( such as tomography ) as current field cv studies require significant time on 8 m - class telescopes and larger .",
    "other candidate open cluster cvs have been suggested : @xcite identify a cv in the field of the @xmath5 gyr - old open cluster , though it may lie foreground to the cluster .",
    "one cv is identified photometrically in the field of the 3.5 gyr - old cluster , but no membership information is available .",
    "the rich open cluster ( age @xmath6 myr ) has two cv candidates identified photometrically by @xcite . finally , an x - ray source in the field of the cluster ( age @xmath7 gyr ) has properties consistent with cvs , but its true nature and cluster membership are unconfirmed @xcite .",

    "eu cnc was detected as variable object in the field of the old open star cluster messier 67 by @xcite , who identified it as a likely am her system based on the similarities of its light curve to that of vv pup .",
    "they determined eu cnc has a photometric period of @xmath8 hr with variations through a cuso@xmath9 ( @xmath10 band ) filter of 0.6 mag .",
    "detected an x - ray source coincident with the optically - variable source ; its very soft x - ray hardness ratio is typical for am her systems in the rosat bands .",
    "the am her nature of eu cnc was confirmed by , who obtained three 75-minute optical spectra of the source .",
    "these spectra exhibit cyclotron humps and radial - velocity variable emission lines of h , , , and . under the assumption that eu cnc is in the star cluster ,",
    "conclude that the absolute optical magnitude and x - ray luminosity of eu cnc are typical for low - state am her systems .",
    "subsequent x - ray studies by using rosat detected 100% modulation of the soft x - ray flux with a period equal to the optical period , indicative of accretion onto a single magnetic pole .",
    "chandra observations by detected hard x - ray emission from eu cnc , again typical for am her systems and likely due to shocks in the accretion flow .",
    "more recent time - series photometry from @xcite again detected high - amplitude optical modulation , with @xmath11-magnitudes varying from 21.6 to 20.3 mag at the same 2.09 hr period of @xcite .",
    "the variation amplitude was about 30% larger than in 1991 , with that difference likely due to different filters used in the two studies , @xmath11 containing a large cyclotron modulation .",
    "based on the body of work on eu cnc , @xcite point out an interesting conundrum .",
    "the high - amplitude optical variability is typical for am her systems in a high accretion state , while the x - ray luminosity of eu cnc , _ under the assumption it is a member of m67 _ , is typical of magnetic cvs in a low accretion state .    in this paper",
    ", we present time - resolved spectroscopy of eu cnc obtained serendipitously with the 10-m keck telescope , as well as the first polarimetric measurements of this system . after discussing the observed phenomenology",
    ", we revisit the issue of eu cnc s cluster membership .",
    "we will show that the optical variability is almost entirely due to cyclotron emission changing throughout the orbit and that the optical spectrum is typical of a low accretion state polar .",
    "we detect the secondary star in the spectrum and , along with the other evidence , we show that eu cnc is a member of the m67 open cluster .",
    "we targeted eu cnc serendipitously as part of a program to obtain high signal - to - noise spectroscopy of wds in messier 67 .",

    "the total spectral coverage ranged from 7400   blueward to the uv atmospheric cutoff .",
    "the weather was nearly photometric through the entire observation , and seeing was moderate at 09 fwhm .",
    "seven exposures , each of twenty - minute integration , were taken over a @xmath14 hr period , with two short breaks for mask re - alignment . during the final exposure ,",
    "the flux dropped dramatically for most stars , likely indicating that the mask was slightly misaligned .",
    "these observations were taken prior to the installation of the lris atmospheric dispersion corrector , and due to constraints in slit mask design , the slitlets were oriented nearly perpendicular to the parallactic angle .",
    "we attempted to minimize the effects of atmospheric dispersion by using a blue filter in the guider camera , but diminution of the uv light is severe at higher airmasses .",
    "we reduced the data using the _ onedspec _ and _ twodspec _ packages in iraf .",
    "overscan regions were used to determine and remove the amplifier bias .",
    "flat - fielding on the blue side data was accomplished using a piecewise - smooth response function as described in @xcite to eliminate ringing due to a sharp inflection point in the flat field at @xmath15 .",
    "cosmic rays were removed from each two - dimensional spectrum using the l.a .  cosmic laplacian cosmic ray rejection routine @xcite .",
    "wavelength solutions on the blue side were derived from hg , cd , and zn arclamp spectra ; on the red side , ne and ar arclamp spectra were used .",
    "these calibrations were obtained prior to the final mask realignment .",
    "relative flux calibration was obtained using 1-wide long - slit spectroscopy of the spectrophotometric standards g191-b2b and g138 - 31 taken at parallactic angle near the start of the night .",
    "no attempt was made to obtain absolute spectrophotometric calibrations .",
    "the time - series spectra are shown in figure [ fig.allspec ] .",
    "qualitatively , the spectra appear fairly typical for am her - type systems in a low accretion state , similar to those observed for hu aqr @xcite .",
    "cyclotron humps are visible and variable in strength .",
    "emission lines of h and he are observed and have at least two components , a narrow ( unresolved ) component and a broad component . the emission lines have variable radial velocities , and the radial velocities of the two line components are not in phase .",
    "this type of emission line component behavior is often seen in polars , for example vv pup whereby the narrow line component phases with the motion of the secondary star .",
    "the time scales for both the cyclotron hump variations and emission line variations appear to be consistent with the known photometric period , though additional time - series spectra would be required to prove these are identical .",
    "we now quantify these phenomena .",
    "we estimate the strength of the magnetic field using the spacing of the cyclotron humps in the optical spectra .",
    "the locations of the peaks are estimated by fitting a 12th - order polynomial to the continuum , excluding the obvious emission lines .",
    "we use equation 54 from @xcite to get a magnetic field strength of @xmath16 mg .",
    "we do not see zeeman split hydrogen absorption lines in the spectrum corresponding to this magnetic field strength , but later we will see that they are likely filled in by the red continuum contribution of the secondary star .      because these data were not obtained with the goal of obtaining precision radial velocities , and because the flexure in the spectrograph was significant over the course of the observations , it was not possible to obtain absolute radial velocities .",
    "attempts to use night sky emission lines as velocity zero points failed due to the lack of night sky lines in data from the blue arm of the spectrograph , where the majority of the cv s emission lines were located .    instead",
    ", relative radial velocities were obtained as follows .",
    "first , the continuum was fit with a high - order polynomial and removed from each spectrum .",
    "the radial velocity of the narrow component of the emission lines was determined by autocorrelation of each spectrum with that of an observation with an exposure midpoint close to zero phase .",
    "this determination involved some iterative bootstrapping with the radial velocity fitting described further below .",
    "the resulting radial velocities ( relative to the observations closest to zero phase ) are given in table [ tab.vel ] and shown in figure [ fig.rv ] .",
    "the radial velocities at @xmath17 are likely measuring different motion than the other points , as the narrow component of the emission lines disappears during these observations .    as a cross - check",
    ", we used the same method to determine the radial velocity of a g - type star targeted in a neighboring slitlet .",
    "the radial velocity of this star should be constant over the set of observations , and although a slight positive velocity offset may exist , it is of low amplitude compared with the variations observed in the cv .",

    "to constrain the progenitor mass , we use the methodology of @xcite . to summarize , we use the effective temperature and mass of the wd to determine its cooling age ( the elapsed time since the wd emerged from the agb progenitor star ) .",
    "this cooling age is subtracted from the cluster age to get the progenitor star s nuclear lifetime ; stellar evolutionary models are then used to infer the progenitor star mass .",
    "the wd mass estimates are sufficiently high to conclude that the wd has a carbon - oxygen core , indicating that the common envelope phase for the progenitor system did not occur before helium ignition in the wd progenitor .",
    "since the agb phase of stellar evolution is relatively short compared to the wd cooling times and progenitor nuclear lifetimes we estimate for this star , we assume that any effect of the common envelope phase on the calculation of the progenitor nuclear lifetime is minimal .",
    "to estimate the effective temperature of the wd , we assume that the minimum luminosity of the system is due to solely to the combined light of the m5v secondary and the wd photosphere , and we assume that the wd has not been heated by the ongoing accretion . under these assumptions ,",
    "the wd has @xmath83 .",
    "we then interpolate wd photometric evolutionary tables provided online by p.  bergeron ] and computed from color and model calculations of @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite to find the wd s cooling age as a function of mass at which its luminosity is equal to the observed minimum luminosity of the cv . despite the uncertainty in the wd mass , the cooling age of the wd is relatively insensitive to its mass , at least over the range of 0.5@xmath84 to 1.0@xmath84 , at @xmath85 to 8.95 . if the wd has experienced significant heating , or if the minimum luminosity is significantly contaminated by light from the accretion stream and/or the accretion column , then its actual cooling age will be older than these calculations .",
    "this means that our derived progenitor mass is a _ lower limit _ on the wd s actual progenitor mass .",
    "we now calculate the wd progenitor mass .",
    "we adopt an age of m67 of 3.5 gyr to 4.5 gyr , and a cluster metallicity of @xmath86 and the calculated primordial value of @xmath87 .",
    "since the lower limit on the wd cooling age is well - constrained , we obtain a fairly precise lower limit on the progenitor mass of @xmath88 , with the majority of the uncertainty due to the uncertainty in the age of m67 . for comparison ,",
    "the current main sequence turnoff mass ( using the same models and inputs ) is @xmath89 .",
    "if we relax the assumption of no heating of the wd , then the wd s cooling age ( time since its emergence from the red giant progenitor ) could be significantly longer ; this would imply a larger progenitor mass .",
    "therefore , we can only constrain the wd progenitor mass calculated above to be a lower limit ; i.e. @xmath90 .",
    "we have presented new observations of the polar eu cnc . in particular ,",
    "proper motion studies strongly indicate that this system is a bona - fide member of the old open star cluster m67 , which provides strong constraints on eu cnc s total age , metallicity , and progenitor mass . using phase - resolved optical spectra and polarimetry ,",
    "we have shown that eu cnc exhibits all the properties of a low state polar .",
    "both assumed  best fit \" polar parameters as well as standard values for the donor star lead to conclusions that are consistent with the system s membership in m67 .",
    "eu cnc is one of only four cvs confirmed to reside in open clusters and the only confirmed magnetic cv in an open cluster .",
    "more detailed photometric , polarimetric , and spectroscopic observations on large telescopes will be required to refine the system parameters and model the system with state - of - the - art analyses",
    ". however models of magnetic cataclysmic variable formation and evolution are not usually attempted and never well constrained ; further study of eu cnc will greatly aid in these endeavors .",
