    "a tiling of the plane is a covering of @xmath2 by a collection of compact subsets , called _",

    "the building blocks of a tiling are the _ prototiles _ : a finite set of tiles with the property that every other tile is a translation of some prototile .",
    "a tiling is said to be _ nonperiodic _ if it lacks any translational periodicity .",
    "one method of producing tilings is via a substitution rule ; a rule that expands each tile , and breaks it into smaller pieces , each of which is an isometric copy of an original tile .",
    "a nonperiodic substitution rule gives rise to a dynamical system , called the _ continuous hull _",
    ", that consists of all tilings whose local patterns appear in some finite substitution of a prototile .",
    "the continuous hull becomes a dynamical system where the homeomorphism is induced by translation . in order to associate a particularly tractable @xmath0-algebra to a nonperiodic tiling , kellendonk @xcite places",
    "punctures in each tile , which he then uses to define a discrete subset of the continuous hull , which we refer to as the _ discrete hull_.    in this paper , we define spectral triples on kellendonk s @xmath0-algebra @xmath3 associated to a tiling .",
    "the fundamental new ingredients for these spectral triples , are the recently developed fractal dual substitution tilings @xcite .",
    "suppose @xmath4 is a nonperiodic substitution tiling with finite prototile set @xmath5 . for each prototile @xmath6 , a fractal dual tiling defines a fractal tree , in fact infinitely many , on a self - similar tiling @xmath7 ; a tiling constructed from the substitution rule on @xmath8 .",
    "each of our fractal trees defines a unique fractal path between the punctures of any two tiles in @xmath7 .",
    "moreover , each fractal tree on @xmath9 respects the hierarchy of the substitution rule . given a fractal tree on @xmath9 ,",
    "we apply perron - frobenius theory to the substitution matrix associated to the edges of the fractal dual tiling , to define a length function on each fractal edge in the fractal tree .",

    "this defines a collection of spectral triples on kellendonk s algebra @xmath3 that each respect the hierarchy of the substitution rule .    using operator algebras as the basic framework , alain connes developed noncommutative geometry @xcite , and has shown its significance to many fields of mathematics .",
    "in particular , one of the overarching themes of noncommutative geometry is to describe a consistent mathematical model for quantum physics .",
    "dynamical systems are particularly well suited to the tools of noncommutative geometry , and provide dynamical invariants in a noncommutative framework . of particular importance to connes program are spectral triples , which typically define a noncommutative riemannian metric on a @xmath0-algebra .",

    "the noncommutative topology of tilings has a long history .",
    "alain connes initiated the study of substitution tilings in a noncommutative framework by giving a detailed description of a @xmath0-algebra associated with the penrose tiling in his seminal book @xcite . in 1982 , dan shechtman discovered quasicrystals @xcite , a type of material that is neither crystalline nor amorphous .",
    "the mathematical theory explaining shechtman s discovery had already been developed in the context of purely mathematical research ; nonperiodic tilings provide an excellent model for quasicrystals . in an attempt to understand the physics of quasicrystals , bellissard defined a crossed product @xmath0-algebra by a family of schrdinger operators .",
    "years later , kellendonk defined a discrete version of the continuous hull and constructed a groupoid @xmath0-algebra associated with a tiling @xcite . soon afterwards",
    ", anderson and putnam @xcite showed that the continuous hull @xmath30 of a tiling is a smale space , and used this observation to describe the @xmath31-theory of the crossed product @xmath32 .",
    "more recently , kellendonk s construction was generalised to tilings with infinite rotational symmetry in @xcite , and the rotationally equivariant @xmath31-theory of these algebras was completely worked out in @xcite .",
    "only recently has there been a breakthrough in the noncommutative geometry of tilings .",
    "the primary interest in spectral triples on tilings is that the continuous hull of a nonperiodic tiling is not only a topological object , it also has rich geometric structure .",
    "the groundbreaking spectral triple for tilings appeared in john pearson s 2008 thesis @xcite , and the subsequent joint paper with bellissard @xcite .",
    "these spectral triples were defined on the commutative @xmath0-algebra associated with the hull of a tiling .",
    "a few years later , the second author constructed spectral triples on the unstable @xmath0-algebra of a smale space @xcite , which is strongly morita equivalent to kellendonk s algebra . however , in the special case of tiling algebras , this spectral triple essentially measured the euclidean distance between two tilings in the groupoid used to define the @xmath0-algebra , and ignored the substitution system . since bellissard and pearson s seminal result",
    "there have been a number of papers on spectral triples of tilings , see for example @xcite .",
    "the survey article @xcite explains these constructions and their relationship to one another .",
    "we thank the anonymous reviewer for suggesting revisions that greatly improved the exposition .",
    "the tilings in this paper are built from _ prototiles _ , a finite collection @xmath5 of labelled compact subsets of @xmath2 that each contain the origin , and are equal to the closure of their interior .",
