    "it is well known that the classical magnetoresistance ( mr ) in metals or semiconductors with a closed free electron fermi surface increases quadratically with increasing magnetic field @xmath2 for @xmath3 and saturates when @xmath4 . here",
    "@xmath5 is the zero - magnetic - field mobility .",
    "hence , the extraordinarily high and linear mr ( lmr ) , which breaks this familiar rule , has been gaining much attention as soon as its discovery . in the past decade",
    ", this unexpected lmr has been reported in silver chalcogenide,@xcite indium antimonide,@xcite silicon,@xcite mnas - gaas composite material,@xcite and graphene.@xcite    kapitza s linear law@xcite indicates that the metal shows a magnetoresistance linear in perpendicular magnetic field when it has an open fermi surface and a mean free path longer than the electronic larmor radius .",
    "recently , another two models , irrespective of the open fermi surface , have been constructed to provide possible mechanisms for the lmr phenomenon .",
    "abrikosov suggested a quantum - limit origin of lmr for the homogenous system with a gapless linear energy spectrum.@xcite his model requires that landau levels are well formed and the carrier concentration is small that all electrons occupy only the lowest landau band .",
    "alternatively , parish and littlewood developed a classical model without involving linear spectrum.@xcite ignoring the concrete microscopic mechanism , they attributed this unusual mr to the mobility fluctuations in a strongly inhomogenous system .",
    "topological insulators@xcite ( tis ) are novel materials with a full energy gap in bulk , while there are gapless surface states . due to its unique band structure with only one helical dirac cone and linear energy dispersion,@xcite the surface states of the ti bi@xmath0se@xmath1 become an excellent platform for the study of quantum - limit lmr .",
    "the recent experiment in this flat surface system , however , reported that a large positive mr , which becomes very linear above a characteristic field of @xmath6@xmath7@xmath8 t , was observed even in an opposite situation where the carrier sheet density is high that electrons occupy more than one landau levels.@xcite moreover , they found that raising temperature to room temperature almost has no influence on the observed lmr .",

    "we find that a positive , nonsaturating and dominantly linear magnetoresistance can appear within quite wide magnetic - field range in the ti surface state having a positive and finite effective g - factor .",
    "this linear magnetoresistance shows up in the system of high carrier concentration and low mobility when electrons are in extended states and spread over many smeared landau levels , and persists up to room temperature , providing a possible mechanism for the recently observed linear magnetoresistance in topological insulator bi@xmath0se@xmath1 nanoribbons.@xcite",

    "further , the separations of the fermi energy from the bottom of bulk band and dirac point are much larger than the highest temperature ( @xmath13 ) considered in this work .",
