    "coupled oscillator systems are used to model a wide range of physical and biological phenomena , where the dynamics of the underlying complex system is dominated by the interactions of its elements over multiple temporal and spatial scales .",
    "the main advantage of using such a modelling approach stems from the fact that it allows one to obtain vital information about the behaviour of the complex systems by studying the laws and rules that govern different dynamical regimes , including ( de)synchronization , cooperation , stability etc .",
    "for instance , some brain pathologies and cognitive deficiencies , such as parkinson s disease , alzheimer s disease , epilepsy , autism are known to be associated with the synchronisation of oscillating neural populations @xcite .",
    "phase synchronisation arises when two or more coupled elements start to oscillate with the same frequency , and if the coupling strength is quite weak , the amplitudes stay unchanged .",
    "however , when the coupling strength becomes stronger , the amplitudes start to interact , which may lead to complete synchronization or amplitude death @xcite .",
    "the coupling between elements is often not instantaneous accounting , for example , for propagation delays or processing times and these time delays have been shown to play a crucial role in sychronisation as well as in ( de)stabilisation of general coupled oscillator systems @xcite , coupled semiconductor lasers @xcite , neural @xcite and engineering systems @xcite .    in coupled oscillator systems with delayed couplings",
    "one of the intriguing effects of time delays is amplitude death @xcite , or death by delay @xcite , when oscillations are suppressed , and the system is driven to a stable equilibrium .",
    "the amplitude death phenomenon has been studied both theoretically and experimentally @xcite , and it has been shown that in the presence of time delays , amplitude death can occur even if the frequencies of the individual oscillators are the same . on the contrary , in the non - delayed case , the amplitude death in coupled oscillator systems can only be observed if the frequencies of the individual oscillators are sufficiently different @xcite .",
    "the majority of research on the effects of time delays upon the stability of coupled oscillators has been focussed on systems with one or several constant time delays .",
    "this is a valid , though somewhat limiting , assumption for some systems where the time delay is fixed and does not change with time .",
    "however , many real - life applications involve time delays which are non - constant @xcite , or more crucially , where the exact value of the time delay is not explicitly known . this assumption can be overcome by considering distributed - delay systems , where the time delay is given by an integral with a memory kernel in the form of a prescribed delay distribution function . in population dynamics models ,",
    "distributed time delays have been used to represent maturation time , which varies between individuals @xcite ; in some engineering systems , the use of distributed time delays is better suited due to the fact that only an approximate value of time delay is known @xcite ; in neural systems , the time delay is different for different paths of the feedback signals and inclusion of a distribution over time delays has been shown to increase the stability region of the system as opposed to the same systems with constant time delays @xcite ; a similar effect has been shown to occur in predator - prey and ecological food webs @xcite , in epidemiological models distributed time delays have been used to model the effects of waning immunity times after disease or vaccination , which differs between individuals @xcite .",
    "the influence of distributed delays on the overall stability of the system under consideration has been discussed by a number of authors ; for example , in @xcite , the effects of the time delays are studied in relation to the coupled oscillators , and in traffic dynamics @xcite , and in @xcite the authors have shown how to approximate the stability boundary around a steady state for a general distribution function .    in this paper",

    "the local dynamics exhibits an unstable steady state @xmath12 and a stable limit cycle with @xmath13 .",
    "it is known that time delay in the coupling can introduce amplitude death , which means destruction of a periodic orbit and stabilization of the unstable steady state .",
    "the system ( [ sl ] ) has been analysed by atay in the case of zero coupling phase for a uniformly distributed delay kernel @xcite .",
    "he has shown that distributed delays increase stability of the steady state and lead to merging of death islands in the parameter space . in this paper",
    ", we extend this work in three directions .",
    "first of all , we also take into consideration a coupling phase , which is important not only theoretically , but also in experimental realizations of the coupling , as has already been demonstrated in laser experiments @xcite .",
    "second , to get a better understanding of the system behavior inside the stability regions , we will numerically compute eigenvalues .",
    "finally , we will also consider the case of a practically important gamma distributed delay kernel to illustrate that it is not only the mean delay and the width of the distribution , but also the actual shape of the distribution that affects amplitude death in systems with distributed - delay coupling .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows . in sec . [ ud ]",

    "section [ gad ] is devoted to the analysis of amplitude death for the case of a gamma distributed delay kernel .",
    "we illustrate how regions of amplitude death are affected by the coupling parameters and characteristics of the delay distribution .",

    "it is noteworthy that the number of such stability islands increases with increasing fundamental frequency @xmath46 ( e.g. , there are three islands for @xmath47 ) .",
