    ", we conclude that in the region @xmath181 the simplest ansatz for the gluonic phases works more nicely than the single plane wave loff and g2sc phases . on the other hand ,",
    "the single plane wave loff phase is energetically more favorable and also resolves the chromomagnetic instability only in the window @xmath96 .",
    "furthermore , we found the noticeable behaviours of the squared meissner masses in the minimal cylindrical gluonic phase ii around @xmath169mev and @xmath163mev .",
    "( see figs.[a4x][a6z ] . )",
    "the 2sc / g2sc phase also has the similar behaviours : notice that there appears the abrupt change of the meissner mass for the 8th gluon from the g2sc side to the 2sc one and that the values of the squared meissner mass for the 4 - 7th gluons have the valley at the phase transition point from the g2sc phase to the 2sc one , as shown in figs.[a4x][a8z ] .",
    "these similarities might suggest that new gapless modes in the minimal cylindrical gluonic phase ii appear around @xmath169mev and @xmath163mev .",
    "we also note that the value of @xmath99 takes its maximum around @xmath169mev and that the relation @xmath182 is satisfied around @xmath163mev .",
    "( see fig.[sol_glu ] . )",
    "these facts might be significant .",
    "the dispersion relation for quarks in the gluonic phase will be performed elsewhere .",
    "there still exists a chromomagnetically unstable region .",
    "however it should be noticed that we examined only the simplest anstze for the loff and gluonic phases in this paper . the multiple plane wave loff phase may completely remove the chromomagnetic instability in the whole parameter region  @xcite .",
    "more involved gluonic phases can also resolve the instability : since there appears the illness in the transverse mode of the 4th gluon , the gcsl phase with the gluon condensates @xmath183 and @xmath184  @xcite is hopeful , for example .",
    "an important point is that the free energy for the gcsl phase is slightly lower than that for the minimal cylindrical gluonic phase  ii  @xcite .",
    "inhomogeneous gluonic phases are also interesting  @xcite .",
