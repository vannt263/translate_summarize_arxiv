    "ccds suffer from both surface and bulk radiation damage , however , when considering charge transfer losses in buried channel devices only bulk traps are important .",
    "these defects create energy levels between the conduction and valance band , hence electrons may be captured by these new levels .",
    "captured carriers are also emitted back to the conduction band , but on a different time scale .",
    "for a signal packet this may lead to a decrease in charge as it is transfered to the output and may be quantified by its charge transfer inefficiency ( cti ) , where a charge of amplitude @xmath2 transported across @xmath3 pixels will have a reduced charge given by @xmath4 the cti value depends on many parameters , some related to the trap characteristics such as : trap energy level , capture cross - section , and trap concentration .",
    "operating conditions also affect the cti as there is a strong temperature dependence on the trap capture rate and also a variation of the cti with the readout frequency .",
