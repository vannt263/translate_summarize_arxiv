    "observation of the @xmath0 and @xmath1 bosons in @xmath4 7 tev proton - proton collisions at the lhc is an important milestone in the atlas physics program .",
    "these are the first cross section measurements at 7 tev that can be compared to a theoretical calculation of comparable precision . also , they are the most common source of isolated , high transverse momentum leptons , and are therefore an important data sample for understanding final states based on leptons .",
    "the @xmath0 and @xmath1 bosons were first observed by the ua1 and ua2 experiments at cern nearly thirty years ago , in proton - antiproton collisions at @xmath5540  gev  @xcite . since then , their properties have been characterized in detail by a succession of collider experiments .",
    "now , confirmation of their known properties , such as their masses and widths , and completion of collider - specific measurements , such as their inclusive and differential cross sections , are a priority in the physics program of a new collider such as the lhc .    in the analyses described here",
    ", the @xmath0 decays to a charged lepton and a neutrino , and the @xmath1 decays to two charged leptons of opposite sign .",
    "the charged leptons may be either electrons or muons .",
    "the isolated , energetic leptons allow a very pure signal to be identified above the background .",
    "the observed data are compared to the signal and background expectations .",
    "the signal acceptance times efficiency is calculated from monte carlo simulations , with corrections for differences between real and simulated detector performance .",
    "background expectations are also derived primarily from simulation , with some use of data to make the qcd background expectations more robust .",
    "this knowledge combined allows calculation of the production cross sections for the @xmath0 and @xmath1 . using the same information , the lepton charge asymmetry for @xmath0 production",
    "is also measured .",
    "the atlas detector  @xcite at the lhc consists of concentric cylindrical layers of inner tracking , calorimetry , and outer ( or muon ) tracking , with both the inner and outer tracking volumes contained in the fields of superconducting magnets to enable measurement of charged particle momenta . in the atlas",
    "coordinate system , the @xmath6 axis points along the anti - clockwise beam direction , and the azimuthal and polar angles @xmath7 and @xmath8 are defined in the conventional way , with @xmath9 ( the @xmath10 axis ) pointing from the origin to the center of the lhc ring .",
    "the pseudorapidity is defined as . the transverse momentum @xmath11 , the transverse energy @xmath12 , and the transverse missing energy  are defined in the @xmath13 plane .",
    "the inner detector ( i d ) provides precision tracking of charged particles inside of @xmath14 .",
    "it is located immediately around the interaction point , inside a superconducting solenoid which produces a 2  t axial field .",
    "the innermost layers use silicon pixel and strip tracking technology , and the outer layers are a gaseous tracker which also provides transition radiation information .",
    "the calorimeter system surrounds the i d and the solenoid .",
    "it covers the pseudorapidity range @xmath15 and has a minimum depth of 22 electromagnetic radiation lengths ( @xmath16 ) . the liquid argon ( lar ) electromagnetic ( em ) calorimeter uses a lead absorber in folded layers designed to minimize gaps in coverage .",
    "the lar calorimeter is segmented in depth to enable better particle shower reconstruction . the innermost layer , or `` compartment '' is instrumented with strips that precisely measure the shower location in @xmath8",
    ". the middle compartment is the deepest and contains most of the electromagnetic shower produced by a typical electron or photon .",
    "the outermost compartment has the coarsest granularity and is used to quantify how much of the particle shower is leaking back into the hadronic calorimeter .",
    "the outermost tracking layers , interleaved with superconducting air - core toroid magnets , form a muon spectrometer .",
    "precision tracking in the bending plane ( @xmath17 ) for both the barrel and the endcaps is done by drift tubes . in the innermost forward plane , from @xmath18 , precision spacepoints are provided by cathode strip chambers .",
    "resistive plate chambers and thin gap chambers are used in the barrel and endcap muon triggers , respectively .",
    "in addition to fast readout for triggering , these detectors provide @xmath7 hit information for offline muon reconstruction .",
    "the @xmath0 cross section and asymmetry measurements shown here use approximately 17  of integrated luminosity .",
    "electron events are selected online through a hardware - based trigger that selects events with an electromagnetic cluster with @xmath19 gev and @xmath20 .",
    "muon events are selected online by comparing the pattern of hits in the muon spectrometer to a lookup table based on muon tracks .",
    "the @xmath0 analysis uses a muon trigger with `` open roads '' , that is , no explicit @xmath11 threshold .",
    "the @xmath1 cross section measurement uses 219229 of integrated luminosity . because the additional data used was acquired after the data for the @xmath0 analysis",
    ", higher instantaneous luminosity conditions made it necessary to raise the trigger thresholds , to 10 gev for the electron channel and 6 gev for the muon channel .",
    "the signal and backgrounds are modeled using pythia  @xcite monte carlo using mrstlo *  @xcite parton distribution functions ( pdf ) integrated with a geant4  @xcite simulation of the atlas detector .",
    "candidate @xmath0 and @xmath1 events are identified based on selection of events with at least one lepton .",
    "additional selection uses the second lepton ( neutrino or charged ) and the mass of the boson to enhance the signal to background ratio .",
    "electrons at atlas are reconstructed as a calorimeter cluster matched to an inner detector track , with transverse energy @xmath21  gev and @xmath22 , excluding the range from @xmath23 .",
    "electron selection at atlas has three tiers of increasing stringency : `` loose '' , `` medium '' , and `` tight '' .",
    "the `` loose '' selection uses information from the middle compartment of the lar calorimeter to require that the shower profile is consistent with an electron .",
    "the `` medium '' selection adds the requirement of a high - quality matched i d track .",
    "it also uses the fine - granularity information from the innermost calorimeter layer for additional checks of the shower shape .",
    "`` tight '' electrons pass additional track quality and kinematic requirements .",
    "more detail on electron identification is available in ref .  @xcite . for the event preselection ,",
    "all electrons passing the `` loose '' selection are considered .",
    "the @xmath12 of electron candidates satisfying the preselection criteria in events passing the 5 gev trigger are shown in figure  [ preselection ] .",
    "muons are reconstructed by combining an inner detector ( i d ) and muon spectrometer ( ms ) track , and must have @xmath24 gev and @xmath25 are to pass the preselection . to reduce the background from cosmic rays , the @xmath6 position where a candidate muon passes the beamline must be within 1  cm of the @xmath6 of a reconstructed primary vertex . additionally , to reduce the background from decays - in - flight , the ms track of the muon is required to have @xmath26  gev and the absolute difference between the @xmath11 measured in the ms and the i d is required to be less than 15  gev .",
    "the @xmath11 of all preselected muons in events passing the `` open roads '' trigger are shown in fig .",
    "[ preselection ] .",
    "first , extra criteria are added to the lepton selection .",
    "electron candidates are required to pass the `` tight '' requirements , which have the best qcd rejection . in the muon channel , the @xmath11 threshold",
    "is raised to 20  gev from 15  gev and a track isolation requirement is added to reduce backgrounds , particularly from qcd .",
    "the missing transverse energy in @xmath27 events measures the transverse momentum of the neutrino produced by the @xmath0 decay .",
    "the  in electron and muon events after the final lepton selection described in the previous paragraph is shown in figure  [ etmiss ] .",
    "the @xmath0 event selection requires  @xmath28 25 gev .",
    "the transverse mass , defined as @xmath29 is a distinctive property of @xmath0 events .",
    "the transverse mass distribution of candidates in the electron and muon channels after the  requirement is shown in fig .",
    "[ transversemass ] . a requirement of completes the @xmath0 event selection for both channels .",
    "for both the electron and muon channels , the @xmath1 event selection requires two same - flavor oppositely charged leptons with an invariant mass reconstructed in the range . in the electron channel ,",
    "the electron selection is as for the @xmath0 analysis , except that the electrons are only required to pass the `` medium '' selection , increasing the acceptance .",
    "muons are selected identically to the @xmath0 analysis .",
    "the invariant mass distribution of @xmath1 candidates immediately before the @xmath30 requirement is shown in fig .",
    "[ invariantmass ] .",
    "the @xmath27 acceptance times efficiency can be factorized into a geometrical and kinematic acceptance @xmath31 and a correction factor @xmath32 for reconstruction efficiency and resolution effects . in the analysis presented here ,",
    "both are calculated from pythia , although @xmath32 is corrected for observed discrepancies between true and simulated detector performance where possible .",
    "table  [ wacceptance ] shows @xmath31 , @xmath32 , and their product , the total acceptance times efficiency , for both the electron and muon channels .",
    ".components of the @xmath27 acceptance times efficiency , with associated systematic uncertainties . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ zcrosssection ]",
    "one distinctive feature of @xmath0 production at the lhc is that , because it is a proton - proton collider , more positive than negative @xmath0s are produced . also , the asymmetry depends on the momentum fraction carried by the colliding quarks and antiquarks , so the ratio of the number of @xmath33 to the number of @xmath34 produced depends on the lepton pseudorapidity . using the @xmath0 sample selected for the cross section measurement , it is possible to measure the charge asymmetry , defined as @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the cross section measured with positive ( negative ) leptons .",
    "the fiducial cross sections , defined with @xmath31 set to 1.0 , are used to measure the asymmetry , reducing the dependence of the result on theoretical assumptions .",
    "the results for the electron and muon channels in two bins of @xmath37 are shown in figure  [ wasymmetryeta ] .",
    "the integral results are 0.21  @xmath38  0.18  ( stat . )  @xmath380.01  ( sys . ) in the electron channel and 0.33  @xmath38  0.12  ( stat . )  @xmath38  0.01  ( sys . ) in the muon channel . these may be compared to the nlo theoretical prediction , 0.20 , which is calculated using the dynnlo  @xcite program with the mstw08 pdf set  @xcite .",
    "figure  [ wasymmetryeta ] includes that prediction as well as ones from mc@nlo  @xcite interfaced with the cteq6.6  @xcite and herapdf 1.0  @xcite pdf sets .",
    "the distinctive signatures of @xmath0 and @xmath1 production have been observed at the atlas detector at the lhc .",
    "first cross section measurements have been performed , and the results are in overall good agreement with the standard model predictions . furthermore , the expected charge asymmetry in @xmath0 production , a unique feature of @xmath0 production in proton - proton collisions , has been observed and measured .",
    "these first measurements will pave the way for a full program of measurements of the @xmath0 and @xmath1 at the lhc , which will deepen our understanding of the standard model as well as establishing key tools , such as lepton identification , for use in the detection of rare and new processes .",
