    "undoubtedly , entanglement @xcite is one of the most crucial elements in quantum information processing . in recent years , quantum entanglement has been extensively investigated in various candidate physical systems @xcite , in particular , one can prepare and manipulate multipartite entanglement in optical systems @xcite .",
    "generally , a spontaneous parametric down - conversion ( pdc ) source @xcite is capable of emitting pairs of strongly time - correlated photons in two spatial modes . as extensions of interest , with linear optics and nonlinear optical materials several schemes for creating multiphoton entangled states",
    "have been proposed @xcite . for a large number of photons , however , there are some technological challenges such as probabilistic emission of pdc sources and imperfect detectors .",
    "a feasible approach is to use the simple single - photon sources , instead of waiting the successive pairs , and quantum nondemolition ( qnd ) measurement @xcite with weak kerr nonlinearities .",
    "note that the kerr nonlinearities @xcite are extremely weak and the order of magnitude of them is only @xmath0 even by using electromagnetically induced transparency @xcite .",
    "more recently , shapiro _",
    "et al _ @xcite showed that the causality - induced phase noise will preclude high - fidelity @xmath1-radian conditional phase shifts created by the cross - kerr effect . in these cases , with the increase of the number of photons it is usually more and more difficult to study multiphoton entanglement in the regime of weak nonlinearities .    in this paper , we focus on the exploration of multiphoton entangled states with linear optics and weak nonlinearities .",
    "we show a quantum circuit to evolve multimode signal photons fed by a group of arbitrary single - photon states and the coherent probe beam .",
    "particularly , there are only two specified but small phase shifts induced in the process of interaction with weak nonlinearities .",
    "this fruitful architecture allows us to explore multiphoton entangled states with a large number of photons but still in the regime of weak nonlinearities .",
    "before describing the proposed scheme , let us first give a brief introduction of the kerr nonlinearities . the nonlinear kerr media can be used to induce a cross phase modulation with hamiltonian of the form @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the coupling constant and @xmath4 ( @xmath5 ) represents the annihilation operator for photons in the signal ( probe ) mode . if we assume that the signal mode is initially described by the state @xmath6 and the coherent probe beam is @xmath7 , then after the kerr interaction the whole system evolves as @xmath8 , where @xmath9 with interaction time @xmath10 . in order to distinguish different cases",
    ", one may perform a homodyne measurement @xcite on the probe beam with quadrature operator @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is a real constant . especially for @xmath13 ,",
    "this operation is conventionally referred to as @xmath14 homodyne measurement ; while for @xmath15 , it is called @xmath16 homodyne measurement .",
    "are input ports and each port is supplied with an arbitrary single - photon state , while @xmath17 are the corresponding outputs , respectively . @xmath18 and @xmath19 represent phase shifts in the coherent probe beam @xmath20 induced by kerr interaction between photons .",
    "@xmath21 is a phase shift gate .",
    "each @xmath22 represents a phase shift on the signal photons based on classical feed - forward information.,title=\"fig:\",width=432 ] +    let @xmath23 represent input ports with respective spatial modes , namely signal modes , and @xmath20 is a coherent beam in probe mode .",
    "the setup of creating multiphoton entangled states is shown in fig.[multiphoton - entangler ] .    without loss of generality",
    "we may suppose that each input port is supplied with an arbitrary single - photon state .",
    "then , the total input state reads @xmath24 where @xmath25 , @xmath26 , are complex coefficients satisfying the normalization condition @xmath27 and @xmath28 denotes the sum over all possible permutations of the signal modes , for example , @xmath29 .",
    "each polarizing beam splitter ( pbs ) is used to transmit @xmath30 polarization photons and reflect @xmath31 polarization photons .",
    "when the signal photons travel to the pbss , they will be individually split into two spatial modes and then interact with the nonlinear media so that pairs of phase shifts @xmath18 and @xmath19 are induced on the coherent probe beam , respectively .",
    "we here introduce a single phase gate @xmath32 so as to implement the next @xmath14 homodyne measurement on the probe beam . @xmath22 , @xmath33 for even @xmath34 and @xmath35 for odd @xmath34 , are phase shifts on the signal photons based on the measured values of @xmath36 via the classical feed - forward information . at last , at the ports @xmath17 one may obtain @xmath37 output states for even @xmath34 or @xmath38 states for odd @xmath34 .",
    "now we describe our method in details . for @xmath34",
    "is even , after the interaction between the photons with kerr media and followed by the action of the phase gate , the combined system evolves as @xmath39 in order to create the desired multiphoton entangled states , we here perform an @xmath14 homodyne measurement @xcite on the probe beam .",

    "note that the peaks of these gaussian distributions locate at @xmath45 .",
    "thus , the midpoints between two neighboring peaks @xmath46 $ ] and the distances of two nearby peaks @xmath47   - \\cos(k\\theta ) } \\}$ ] with @xmath48 . obviously , with these @xmath49 midpoint values @xmath50 there exist @xmath37 intervals and each interval corresponds to an output state .",
    "we now consider the phase shifts @xmath51 .",
    "the signal photon evolves as @xmath52 , @xmath53 .",
    "a straightforward calculation shows that @xmath54/m \\bmod 2\\pi$ ] .",
    "after these feed - forward phase shifts have been implemented and the signal photons pass through the pbss , one can obtain the desired states as follows .",
    "clearly , for @xmath55 we have @xmath56 ; for @xmath57 , we obtain the states @xmath58 ; and for @xmath59 we obtain the state @xmath60 .",
    "similarly , for odd @xmath34 , we have @xmath61 also , @xmath62 } ) \\times ( \\text{e}^{-\\text{i}\\phi _ { n/2 - 1}(x)}\\sum_{\\text{perm}}a_{100 \\cdots 0 } |h\\rangle^{\\otimes ( n-1 ) } |v\\rangle + \\text{e}^{\\text{i}\\phi _ { n/2 - 1}(x)}\\sum_{\\text{perm}}a_{11 \\cdots 10 }   |h\\rangle |v\\rangle^{\\otimes ( n-1)})\\nonumber \\\\ & & + f({x,\\alpha \\cos ( n\\theta/2 ) } ) \\times ( \\text{e}^{-\\text{i}\\phi _ { n/2}(x ) } a_{00 \\cdots 00 }   |h\\rangle^{\\otimes n } + \\text{e}^{\\text{i}\\phi _ { n/2}(x ) } a_{11 \\cdots 11 }   |v\\rangle^{\\otimes n}).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here , the functions @xmath63 , phase shifts @xmath64 and @xmath65 are approximately the same as those described for even @xmath34 , except for @xmath66 , and then the similar results hold for the midpoints @xmath50 and the distances @xmath67 with @xmath68 .",
    "of course , with @xmath69 midpoint values @xmath50 there may be @xmath38 output states ; that is , one can obtain the states @xmath56 for @xmath55 , @xmath70 for @xmath71 , and @xmath72 for @xmath73 .    as an example of the applications of interest for the present scheme",
    ", we introduce a class of remarkable multipartite entangled states @xmath74 and @xmath75 are two orthonormal states , namely dicke states @xcite . in view of its `` catness '' , the state @xmath76 can be referred to as _ cat - like state _ , and especially for @xmath77 it can be expressed as the canonical @xmath34-partite greenberger - horne - zeilinger ( ghz ) state . in the present scheme , obviously , for @xmath78 , @xmath79 , we can obtain these cat - like states with @xmath80 for even @xmath34 and @xmath81 for odd @xmath34 , where the qubits are encoded with the polarization modes @xmath82 and @xmath83 .",
    "of course , more generally , we may project out a group of multiphoton entangled states involving generalized dicke states .",
    "there are two models commonly employed in the process of kerr interaction , single - mode model and continuous - time multi - mode model @xcite .",
    "the former implies that one may ignore the temporal behavior of the optical pulses but the latter is causal , non - instantaneous model involving phase noise .",
    "it has been shown that @xcite this causality - induced phase noise will preclude the possibility of high - fidelity cphase gates created by the cross - kerr effect in optical fiber . to solve this problem , one may need to find an optimum response function for the available medium , or to exploit more favorable systems , such as cavitylike systems @xcite .",
    "after all , the ultimate possible performance of kerr interaction with a larger system is an interesting open issue . in the present scheme ,",
    "we restrict ourselves to ignoring the phase noise and concentrate mainly on showing a method for exploring multiphoton entangled states in the regime of weak cross - kerr nonlinearities , i.e. @xmath84 .",
    "it is worth noting that , there are only small phase shifts @xmath18 and @xmath19 instead of a series of related functions of the number of photons in the process of interaction with kerr nonlinearities .",
    "this implies that the present scheme is quite tractable especially for creating entangled states with a larger number of photons .",
    "in addition , the error probabilities @xmath85 are @xmath86 , which come from small overlaps between two neighboring curves . considering the distances of two nearby peaks @xmath87 with @xmath48 for even @xmath34 and @xmath68 for odd @xmath34 , the maximal error probability @xmath88 , which is exactly the result described by nemoto and munro in @xcite",
    ". obviously , the error probabilities in our scheme are no more than that one even when the number of photons is large .    evidently , three aspects are noteworthy in the present framework . first , since there are no large phase shifts in the interacting process with weak kerr nonlinearities , our scheme is more feasible compared with the previous schemes .",
    "second , the system is measured only once with a small error probability and it means that the present scheme might be realized near deterministically .",
    "finally , the fruitful architecture allows us to explore a group of multiphoton entangled states involving a large number of photons , i.e. , to produce entangled states approaching the macroscopic domain .",
