    "the numerous x - ray point sources and young , massive star clusters in the antennae make this galaxy pair an ideal laboratory for studying the environments of x - ray binaries ( xrbs ) .",
    "previously , _",
    "observations revealed 49 x - ray point sources ranging in luminosity from @xmath8 ergs s@xmath9 @xcite . a 411 ks total exposure , consisting of six additional pointings spread over two years , revealed an additional 71 x - ray sources @xcite down to a luminosity of @xmath10 ergs s@xmath9 . while most are xrbs with either a black hole or neutron star , those sources with @xmath11 ergs s@xmath9 are more unusual objects classified as ultraluminous x - ray sources ( ulxs ) .",
    "some theories suggest these ulxs are intermediate mass black holes with masses from 100  10,000 @xmath12 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but there remains a considerable amount of controversy concerning their origins ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .    for this study",
    ", we use a distance to the antennae of 19.3 mpc ( for @xmath13 km s@xmath9 mpc@xmath9 ) , as determined by the spectroscopic redshift @xcite .",
    "however , there exists some ambiguity concerning the distance to this galaxy pair . while a distance derived from the type ia supernova ( sn ) 2007sr suggests a distance of 22@xmath143 mpc @xcite , analysis of the rgb colors",
    "indicate that the distance can range from 22 mpc to as low as 13.8 mpc @xcite .",
    "while this lower distance would halve our luminosity and mass estimates , this factor of a few will not affect any statistical study of their population .",
    "hence , we do not anticipate these discrepences in the distance to ngc 4038/4039 as being problematic .",
    "compact objects tend to be associated with massive star formation , which some theories suggest is predominant in young stellar clusters @xcite . in previous work on the antennae we find a close association between compact objects and clusters , identifying 15 possible ir counterparts to x - ray sources @xcite .",
    "many of these counterparts reside in the spiral arms and bridge region of the antennae  locations predominant in massive star formation .",
    "the spiral arms wrap around the northern nucleus and extend to the south of the southern nucleus , while the bridge region is the dense area connecting the two galaxies .",
    "those x - ray sources without counterparts could be compact objects that escaped their parent cluster or remained behind after their cluster dissolved .",
    "in @xcite we suggest a third possibility , that some x - ray sources do have counterparts , but these are too faint to see in the ir images .    in this paper , we expand on our initial study by searching for ir counterparts to the 120 x - ray sources identified in @xcite .",
    "we then extend this work to optical wavelengths using _ hst _ images of the antennae . the higher sensitivity of _ hst _ in non - dust obscured regions allows us to search for additional counterparts to x - ray sources .",
    "in addition , combining multi - band photometry in the optical and ir , we can use spectral evolutionary models to measure cluster properties . in ",
    "2 we discuss our ir observations and analysis of optical _ hst _ archival images .",
    "we describe our photometric analysis of counterpart cluster properties in  3 , and summarize our results in  4 .",
    "[ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     we summarize the results from all model fits in fig .",
    "we found ages between @xmath15 ",
    "@xmath16 yr . masses ranged from @xmath17 ",
    "@xmath18 m@xmath4 , with most @xmath3 m@xmath4 .",
    "the extinction varied from @xmath19  1.5 mag .",
    "finally , we did not find a trend between these cluster properties and the luminosities of their associated x - ray sources .",
    "in this work , we made astrometric frame - ties between _ chandra _ x - ray coordinates @xcite , wirc ir pixel positions , and _ hst _ optical coordinates to search for star cluster counterparts to x - ray point sources . using the list of 120 x - ray sources in table 3 of @xcite , we found 38 of these sources are associated with an ir counterpart , 35 of which are confirmed star clusters .",
    "this expanded on previous work in which we found ir star cluster associations to 15 of the 49 x - ray sources listed in table 1 of @xcite @xcite .",
    "our new sample of ir cluster counterparts includes 11 of the previously identified 15 counterparts discussed in @xcite . both this past study , and what we present here ,",
    "indicate that most x - ray sources , roughly two thirds , do not spatially coincide with a cluster .",
    "a comparison between x - ray luminosity and the separation from the associated cluster , does not show a trend , thus indicating no relation between xrb type and where it forms in it s parent cluster .",
    "extending our frame - tie from the x - ray to the optical using the ir as an intermediary , we were unable to find reliable optical counterparts due to the crowded _",
    "hst _ fields .",
    "this problem of identifying counterparts to x - ray sources was also encountered in a similar study , which focused on optical counterparts to ulxs @xcite .",
    "thus , instead , we found the optical counterparts to 27 of the ir star clusters associated with an x - ray source .",
    "an examination of the positions of the cluster counterparts in the antennae indicates that the majority are in the spiral arms and bridge region between these two galaxies .",
    "this seems to clearly indicate that those x - ray sources with counterparts are tied to star formation in these interacting galaxies .    using photometry taken from @xcite",
    ", we made an ir , @xmath20 photometric study of the 33 ir star cluster counterparts whose x - ray sources have listed luminosities .",
    "we found most of the ir cluster counterparts are bright , @xmath516 mag in @xmath21 and in slightly redder clusters , @xmath1 mag as compared to @xmath22 mag for the general population of clusters .",
    "this confirms our results presented in @xcite , in which we performed a similar study with the smaller sample of ir counterparts .    following the work in @xcite",
    ", we explored the relationship between cluster mass and the detected number of x - ray sources .",
    "in @xcite we defined a function @xmath23 relating the number of x - ray detections per mass as a function of cluster mass .",
    "we found @xmath23 is consistent with a mean value of @xmath24 . using a @xmath25 test",
    ", we compared a fitted slope of the plotted @xmath26 values to the mean @xmath26 value .",
    "we found a @xmath27 .",
    "considering we found a @xmath28 in @xcite , our new study shows a stronger relation between @xmath26 and the mean value , effectively ruling out any inclination towards more x - ray sources residing in more massive clusters other than through simple scaling arguments .    including the 27 star cluster counterparts to x - ray sources seen across all @xmath29 bands , we fit bruzual - charlot ( bc ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) spectrophotometric models to 10 of these clusters .",
    "the bc model fits indicate the x - ray - source - associated clusters are @xmath17 ",
    "@xmath18 m@xmath4 in mass , @xmath15 ",
    "@xmath16 yr in age , with extinction varying between @xmath19  1.5 mag .",
    "these proprieties indicate star cluster counterparts to x - ray sources in the antennae tend to be young and massive , which are consistent with these x - ray sources being associated with star formation . in @xcite , these authors also found similar mass results for their counterparts to ulxs .",
    "while we can use multiwavelength photometry to describe cluster properties , there remains some uncertainty in these characteristics due to errors in magnitude and model limitations . in future work",
    ", we plan to acquire spectra of antennae cluster counterparts and refine estimations of their properties .",
