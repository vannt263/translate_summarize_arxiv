    "experiments to map the cosmic background radiation ( cbr ) have stimulated renewed interest in diffuse galactic emission .",
    "sensitive observations of variations in the microwave sky brightness have revealed 14 - 90 ghz microwave emission which is correlated with @xmath5 thermal emission from interstellar dust ( kogut et al .",
    "1996 ; de oliveira - costa et al .",
    "1997 ; leitch et al .",
    "the origin of this  anomalous \" emission has been of great interest . while the observed frequency - dependence appears consistent with free - free emission ( kogut et al .",
    "1996 ; leitch et al .",
    "1997 ) , the observed intensities can not be due to free - free emission from interstellar gas : for gas temperature @xmath6 the required spatial variations in emission measure would produce @xmath7 times more h@xmath8 than allowed by observations ( gaustad et al . 1996 ; leitch et al .",
    "1997 ) , while @xmath9 gas would produce powerful x - ray emission which can be ruled out on energetic grounds ( draine & lazarian 1998 ) .",
    "it has been proposed that the observed 14 - 90 ghz emission is rotational emission from the population of ultrasmall dust grains believed to be present in the interstellar medium ( draine & lazarian 1998a , b ) .",
    "such electric dipole emission is a natural consequence of current models of interstellar dust , and seems likely to be the mechanism responsible for the observed emission .",
    "it is nevertheless of interest to investigate whether other emission mechanisms exist which would also be capable of producing strong emission at these frequencies .",
    "here we discuss an entirely different emission mechanism : _ thermal fluctuations of the magnetization _ within individual interstellar grains .",
    "such thermal fluctuations will result in magnetic dipole radiation .",
    "the magnitude of the magnetic fluctuations depends upon the magnetic properties of the grain material , and we consider a number of possibilities , including `` ordinary '' paramagnetism as well as superparamagnetism , ferromagnetism , and ferrimagnetism .",
    "if about 30% of the grain mass is carbonaceous , then fe and ni contribute nearly 30% of the mass of the remaining grain material .",
    "it would not be surprising , then , if some fraction of the interstellar grain population were strongly magnetic ; metallic iron / nickel , magnetite ( fe@xmath10o@xmath11 ) , and maghemite ( @xmath12fe@xmath13o@xmath10 ) are plausible candidates to consider .    at infrared and optical frequencies ( @xmath14 )",
    "it has been customary to neglect the magnetic properties of the grain material when computing absorption or emission of electromagnetic radiation by dust grains ; this is an excellent approximation since most materials have negligible magnetic response to oscillating magnetic fields at frequencies @xmath15 .",
    "this is because `` magnetism '' is due to ordering of electron spins , and the maximum frequency for electron spins to reorient is the precession frequency of an electron in the local magnetic field ( due mainly to other electron spins ) in the material ; these gyrofrequencies do not exceed @xmath16 .",
    "in contrast , the electron charge distribution in grains can respond strongly to applied electric fields at frequencies as large as @xmath17 .    at microwave frequencies materials",
    "can respond to both electric and magnetic fields , and both the dielectric constant @xmath18 and the magnetic permeability @xmath19 can play a role in the absorption and emission of electromagnetic radiation .",
    "the present study is primarily directed at calculation of thermal emission from magnetic dust grains .",
    "the complex permeability @xmath19 obtained here is also relevant to the process of grain alignment via magnetic dissipation ( davis & greenstein 1951 ) , particularly for ultrasmall grains undergoing very rapid rotation ( draine & lazarian 1998a , b ; lazarian & draine 1998 ) and suprathermally rotating graints ( purcell 1979 ) .",
    "the optical properties of small particles , including both dielectric and magnetic effects , are reviewd in  [ sec : optics ] . in  [ sec : kk ] we generalize purcell s ( 1969 ) application of the kramers - kronig relations to interstellar grains to include the case of magnetic grains .",
    "the expected form of the frequency - dependence of the complex permeability @xmath19 is discussed in  [ sec : magnetic ] . in  [ sec : paramag ] we review the properties of ordinary paramagnetic materials , and in  [ sec : ferro ] we discuss various classes of iron - rich materials , including : single - domain iron grains (  [ sec : fe_single ] ) ; bulk ( multidomain ) iron (  [ sec : fe_bulk ] ) ; materials with single - domain fe inclusions (  [ sec : fe_incl ] ) , including the superparamagnetic limit where the inclusions contain less than @xmath20 fe atoms each (  [ sec : superpara ] ) ; ferrimagnetic materials such as magnetite and maghemite (  [ sec : ferri ] ) ; and antiferromagnetic materials (  [ sec : antiferro ] ) .    in  [ sec :",
    "prediction ] we consider several ways in which iron can be present in the interstellar grain population , and for each case we calculate the expected thermal emission contributed by magnetic fluctuations .",
    "iron grains , if present , would produce strong @xmath21 emission ; this can be used to place an upper limit of @xmath4 on the fraction of the interstellar fe which can be in the form of pure iron grains or inclusions . in  [ sec : hypothetical_materials ] we discuss the possibility that the fe could be in a less strongly magnetic form ( e.g. , impure iron ) , and show that there are plausible magnetic properties for which such grains could dominate the 14 - 90 ghz emission . the polarization of the magnetic dipole emission from ferromagnetic grains is discussed in  [ sec : polarization ] .",

    "for grains which are small compared to the wavelength , the cross section for absorption of electromagnetic waves can be written as the sum of electric dipole and magnetic dipole cross sections ( draine & lee 1984 ) : c_abs c_abs^(ed ) + c_abs^(md )  .",

    "<S> thermal fluctuations in the magnetization of interstellar grains will produce magnetic dipole emission at @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> we show how to calculate absorption and emission from small particles composed of material with magnetic as well as dielectric properties . </S>",
    "<S> the kramers - kronig relations for a dusty medium are generalized to include the possibility of magnetic grains .    the magnetic permeability as a function of frequency is discussed for several candidate grain materials . </S>",
    "<S> iron grains , or grains containing iron inclusions , are likely to have the magnetic analogue of a frhlich resonance in the vicinity of @xmath1 , resulting in a large magnetic dipole absorption cross section .    </S>",
    "<S> we calculate the emission spectra for various interstellar grain candidates . </S>",
    "<S> while `` ordinary '' paramagnetic grains or even magnetite grains can not account for the observed `` anomalous '' emission from dust in the @xmath2 range , stronger magnetic dipole emission will result if a fraction of the grain material is ferromagnetic , as could be the case given the high fe content of interstellar dust . </S>",
    "<S> the observed emission from dust near @xmath3 implies that not more than @xmath4 of interstellar fe is in the form of metallic iron grains or inclusions ( e.g. , in `` gems '' ) . </S>",
    "<S> however , we show that if most interstellar fe is in a moderately ferromagnetic material , with the magnetic properties properly adjusted , it could contribute a substantial fraction of the observed @xmath2 emission , perhaps comparable to the contribution from spinning ultrasmall dust grains . </S>",
    "<S> the two emission mechanisms can be distinguished by measuring the emission from dark clouds .    if ferromagnetic grains consist of a single magnetic domain , and are aligned , the magnetic dipole emission will be linearly polarized , with the polarization depending strongly on frequency .    </S>",
