    "the basic scientific goal of the planck surveyor mission is to measure the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) anisotropies at all angular scales larger than @xmath0 , with an accuracy set by astrophysical limits .",
    "the mission will produce all - sky maps in 9 frequency bands centered at 30 , 44 , 70 , 100 , 143 , 217 , 353 , 545 , and 857 ghz , with high sensitivity to intensity fluctuations as well as to polarization fluctuations , accurate calibration ( through the modulation of the @xmath1mk cmb dipole by the orbital motion of the earth ) , and a careful minimization of systematic errors .",
    "the wide frequency coverage is achieved with two types of detectors : tuned radio receivers at low frequencies ( 30 to 100 ghz : low frequency instrument or lfi ) , and bolometers at high frequencies ( 100 to 857 ghz : high frequency instrument or hfi ) ; the 100 ghz band is common to both instruments .",
    "the selected frequency range corresponds to a `` cosmological window '' , where foreground emissions are minimum , while the cmb intensity peaks . at high galactic latitudes cmb",
    "intensity fluctuations stand out well above any other astrophysical signal ; only in a tiny fraction of pixels in planck s high galactic latitude maps , will the cosmological signal be severely contaminated .",
    "there are also good prospects for cmb polarization measurements , especially in regions around the ecliptic polar caps , where sensitivities significantly above average are reached .    on the other hand , in spite of the small telescope size , resulting in a low sensitivity to astrophysical sources compared to ground based instruments such as the effelsberg and green bank @xmath2 m telescopes , the vla , scuba on the jcmt , and the mm and sub - mm arrays planned for the next decade , as well as to space - based missions such as first",
    ", the planck surveys will provide unique information on a broad variety of astrophysical phenomena , including synchrotron , free - free and dust emission in our own galaxy , emissions from several classes of galactic and extragalactic sources , the sunyaev - zeldovich effect in clusters of galaxies .",
    "there are three diffuse galactic emissions ",
    "synchrotron , free - free , and dust  which provide a significant confusing foreground to cmb anisotropy observations .",
    "a sketch of the contribution of these components to rms fluctuations at @xmath3 is shown as a function of frequency by @xcite ; at high galactic latitudes , the anisotropy in galactic emission was found to reach a minimum between 50 and 90 ghz .    particularly at low galactic latitudes",
    "the synchrotron and free - free emissions are recognized as individual radio sources mostly associated with recent star formation : supernova remnants and hii regions , respectively .",
    "synchrotron emission results from cosmic - ray electrons accelerated in magnetic fields , and thus depends on the energy spectrum of the electrons and the intensity of the magnetic field @xcite",
    ". a recent , careful discussion of the synchrotron emission from the galaxy has been presented by @xcite .",
    "if the electrons direction of motion is random with respect to the magnetic field , and the electrons energy spectrum can be approximated as a power law : @xmath4 , then the luminosity is given by @xmath5 where @xmath6 is a weak function of the electron energy spectrum@xcite , @xmath7 is the length along the line of sight through the emitting volume , @xmath8 is the magnetic field strength , and @xmath9 is the frequency .    at gev energies ,",
    "the local energy spectrum of the electrons has been measured to be , for the energy intervals describing the peak of radio synchrotron emission , a power law to good approximation .",
    "the index of the power law appears to increase from about 2.7 to 3.3 over this energy range@xcite .",
    "such an increase of the electron energy spectrum slope is expected , as the energy loss mechanisms for electrons increases rapidly ( as the square ) with energy .",
    "the synchrotron emission at frequency @xmath9 is dominated by cosmic ray electrons of energy @xmath10 .",
    "the observed steepening of the electrons spectrum at gev energies is used to model the radio emission spectrum at ghz frequencies @xcite .",
    "radio surveys at frequencies less than 2 ghz are dominated by synchrotron emission .",
    "the well - known survey by haslam et al.@xcite at 408 mhz is the only all - sky map available .",
    "large - area surveys with careful attention to baselines and calibration have also been made at 1420 mhz @xcite and most recently at 2326 mhz @xcite .",
    "all these investigations have been made with fwhp beamwidths of less than 1@xmath11 .",
    "of particular interest for the planck mission are surveys of significant areas of the sky at higher frequencies , say 5 - 15 ghz",
    ". only limited data close to the galactic plane or in selected areas at higher latitudes with restricted angular resolution are available .",
    "surveys of about one steradian of the sky have been made at 5 ghz by @xcite at jodrell bank and at 10 , 15 and 33 ghz by @xcite with the tenerife experiments .",
    "large features with a synchrotron spectrum extend far from the galactic plane .",
    "the most prominent of these are the spurs and loops which describe small circles on the sky with diameters in the range 60@xmath11 to 120@xmath11 @xcite .",
    "because of their association with hi and in some cases with x - ray emission , they are believed to be low surface brightness counterparts of the brighter supernova remnants seen in lower latitude surveys such as that by @xcite at 2.4 ghz .",
    "other more diffuse structure at higher latitudes may be even older remnants .",
    "the spectral index of galactic synchrotron emission can be readily determined at frequencies less than 1 ghz where the observational baselevel uncertainty is much less than the total galactic emission .",
    "lawson et al . @xcite used data covering the range 38 to 1420 mhz to determine the spectral index variation over the northern sky .",
    "clear variations in spectral index of at least 0.3 were found .",
    "a steepening in the spectral index at higher frequencies is observed in the brighter features such as the loops and some snrs . up",
    "to 1420 mhz no such steepening was found in the regions of weaker emission . at the higher galactic latitudes where no reliable zero level is available at 1420 mhz ,",
    "an estimate can be made of the spectral index of local features by using the t - t technique .",
    "the de - striped 408 and 1420 mhz maps gave temperature spectral indices of 2.8 to 3.2 in the northern galactic pole regions @xcite .    at",
    "frequencies higher than 2 - 3 ghz no reliable zero levels have been measured for large area surveys .",
    "the relevant observational material comes from beamswitching or interferometric data .",
    "accordingly the spectrum of individual features is estimated .",
    "on scales of a few degrees the temperature spectral index between 5 ghz @xcite and 408 mhz was @xmath12 .",
    "similarly the 10 , 15 and 33 ghz beam switching data @xcite also indicated a spectral index of @xmath12 at 10 ghz .",
    "these results show that at higher galactic latitudes synchrotron emission dominates up to 5 ghz and most likely to 10 ghz .",
    "platania et al .",
    "@xcite used high frequency data from a number of sky locations to investigate the frequency dependence of the synchroton emission spectral index and also find evidence for a steepening . based on the local cosmic ray electron energy spectrum",
    ", the synchrotron spectrum should steepen with frequency to about @xmath13 at these higher microwave frequencies .",
    "the galactic free - free emission ( see @xcite for reviews ) is the thermal bremsstrahlung from hot ( @xmath14k ) electrons produced in the interstellar gas by the uv radiation field .",
    "this emission is not easily indentified at radio frequencies , except near the galactic plane . at higher latitudes",
    "it must be separated from synchrotron emission by virtue of their different spectral indices . at frequencies less than about 1 ghz",
    ", synchrotron emission dominates at intermediate and high latitudes . at higher frequencies where",
    "free - free emission might be expected to exceed the synchrotron component , the signals are weak and survey zero levels are indeterminate .",
    "latitudes diffuse galactic h@xmath15 is thought to be a good tracer of diffuse free - free emission since both are emitted by the same ionized medium and both have intensities proportional to emission measure ( @xmath16 ) , the line of sight integral of the free electron density squared .",
    "unfortunately , no full sky map in h@xmath15 is presently available .",
    "observations of limited areas of the sky have been carried out with a fabry - perot spectrometer @xcite or with narrow band filters @xcite .",
    "note that h@xmath15 maps are contaminated by a strong geocoronal emission in the same line and by the oh night - sky line at @xmath17 .",
    "high resolution spectroscopy is required to separate the galactic h@xmath15 emission from the contaminating lines , taking advantage of the separation produced by the doppler shift due to the earth s motion ; the separation , however , is negligible near the ecliptic poles .",
    "the major h@xmath15 structures form the well - known local ( gould belt ) system which extends 30@xmath11 - 40@xmath11 from the plane at positive @xmath18 in the galactic centre and at negative latitude in the anticentre . the hi and dust in the local system",
    "may be traced to 50@xmath11 from the galactic plane .",
    "other h@xmath15 features are also found extending 15@xmath11 - 20@xmath11 from the plane @xcite .",
    "a substantial h@xmath15 emission is observed from the magellanic stream @xcite .",
    "to first order , the h@xmath15 may be modelled as a layer parallel to the galactic plane with a half - thickness intensity of 1.2 rayleigh ( r ) .",
    "the rms variation in this h@xmath15 emission is about 0.6  r on degree scales . in the context of the present discussion 1  r ( @xmath19 at a wavelength @xmath20 )",
    "will give a brightness temperature of about 10@xmath21k at 45 ghz .",
    "the situation is improving rapidly , however .",
    "the wisconsin h@xmath15 mapper ( wham ) survey @xcite will produce a fabry - perot map in h@xmath15 of the northern sky with a @xmath22 resolution .",
    "early results @xcite have revealed several very long ( @xmath23 @xmath24 ) filaments reaching high galactic latitudes ( up to @xmath25 ) , superimposed on the diffuse h@xmath15 background , without a clear correspondence to the other phases of the interstellar medium , observed at 21 cm or by radio continuum , far - ir or x - ray surveys .",
    "high resolution ( @xmath26 ) imaging surveys of the h@xmath15 emission in the northern and in the southern emisphere , respectively , are underway by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the four - year cobe dmr sky maps at different frequencies have been utilized @xcite to isolate emission with antenna temperature which varies proportional to frequency to the @xmath27 power ( @xmath28 ) in an attempt to provide a large angular scale map of free - free emission at 53 ghz . this low - signal to noise map is consistent with the h@xmath15 large scale model with a free - free half height amplitude of @xmath29k .",
    "the rms free - free signal on a 7@xmath11 scale was estimated to be @xmath30k .",
    "leitch et al .",
    "@xcite looking near the ncp found emission with an approximate @xmath31 spectral index .",
    "their analysis indicates a free - free level some 510 times that found for the ncp based upon an extrapolation in angular power spectra from @xcite or from the h@xmath15 emission .",
    "moreover their estimates are above those deduced from the tenerife experiments .",
    "not surprisingly , the free - free emission is partially correlated with dust as the h@xmath15 emission has long been known to be .",
    "however , there are things that are not understood well and suprises may be lurking ( see next section on dust ) .",
    "planck will clearly have a role in helping to understand the free - free emission .",
    "the dust in our galaxy is heated by the interstellar radiation field ( isrf ) , absorbing optical and uv photons and emitting the energy in the far ir .",
    "the balance between absorption and emission depends on the intensity of the isrf and the details of the dust , but in general it results in an equilibrium temperature of 1820@xmath32k , in the limit of large dust grains . the emission spectrum from a greybody at this temperature peaks at @xmath33 m but extends out to microwave wavelengths .",
    "adequate removal of dust contamination from the microwave background signal will allow both greater sky coverage and finer spatial resolution .",
    "the new berkeley - durham dust map @xcite is based on infra - red radiation from the dust , observed by iras at @xmath34 m and by dirbe at @xmath34 m and @xmath35 m .",
    "the dirbe @xmath34 m map was used to clean up and calibrate the iras sky survey atlas ( issa ) and @xmath36 point sources were removed using positions from the 1.2jy survey ( fisher et al .",
    "a low - resolution temperature map was derived from the dirbe @xmath34 m and @xmath35 m data , which is then applied to the high - resolution map .",
    "draine & lazarian @xcite have recently proposed that spinning dust grains can produce significant signal peaking in the few 10 s of ghz .",
    "another mechanism of dust microwave emission is based on magneto - dipole emissivity @xcite . while there is no compelling evidence to support these hypotheses , it is still a lesson to us that there could be suprising new contributions or variation in galactic emission awaiting us .",
    "this indeed is a primary reason that planck carries a complement of frequencies .",
    "planck measurements will detect the brightest discrete galactic radio sources , bridging the gap between ground based observations , mostly confined to frequencies @xmath37ghz , and far - ir data , mostly from iras and therefore at @xmath38ghz . as described below for some representative classes of sources",
    ", planck observations will provide crucial information on their physical properties .",
    "also these observations will be unique in investigating the possibile existence of extremely compact thermal or non thermal sources , self absorbed up to tens of ghz and therefore unlikely to be found in existing surveys .",
    "optically thick synchrotron emission gives a strongly inverted spectrum ( @xmath39 ) , independent of the energy distribution of electrons , producing a low frequency cutoff .",
    "for very compact , high density regions , cutoff frequencies as high as several ghz are observed .",
    "likewise , compact and dense hii regions may be optically thick , and have an inverted spectrum ( @xmath40 ) up to relatively high frequencies .",
    "_ supernova remnants _ ( snr ) constitute a particularly bright and well studied class of galactic radio sources .",
    "nevertheless , existing compilations are believed to be very incomplete , especially with respect to young , bright and older , extended remnants ( see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "the broad general category of snrs actually encompasses a variety of objects with widely different properties , which have been divided into at least 4 subcategories .",
    "their radio emission is non - thermal , with spectral indices @xmath15 ( @xmath41 ) generally in the range 0.10.9 .",
    "planck is expected to detect a large fraction of the 145 snrs listed by green ( 1984 ) ; more than half of them will be resolved .",
    "planck will be particularly effective in studying the flat spectrum plerionic snrs , which are possibly related to type ii sn and derive their energy from the rotational energy losses of a central neutron star , rather than being powered by the shock wave of the sn explosion , like the other classes of snrs . the planck survey will greatly help in obtaining complete samples of snrs of the different classes , and in particular will allow to assess the , still debated , abundance of plerionic snrs and to derive more reliable estimates of their birthrates . moreover",
    ", the planck mission will provide accurate measurements of the continuum spectrum of the brightest snrs such as the crab nebula and cassiopeia a , still poorly known in the planck frequency range .",
    "the planck data will be valuable to investigate the high frequency behaviour of the synchrotron spectrum ( and hence the energy distribution of relativistic electrons within these snrs ) and the content of cold dust .",
    "an outstanding mm source is _",
    "sagittarius a_. this source , located at the dynamical center of the galaxy and presumed to be associated with a supermassive black hole ( @xmath42 @xcite ) has been a puzzle for many years ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "it is brightest in the radio / mm region .",
    "its radio spectrum appears to have an ankle at around @xmath43ghz , where it steepens from @xmath44 to @xmath45 , and is variable .",
    "planck covers this particularly interesting region and will provide simultaneous measurements at various frequencies .",
    "an extensive survey of millimeter continuum emission from stars was carried out by @xcite .",
    "a review of the subject has been published by @xcite .",
    "massive radiatively driven winds from hot stars have mm radio spectra dominated by optically thick free - free emission with @xmath46 .",
    "the two brightest sources of this class are @xmath47 carinae with a variable @xmath48 mm flux of up to @xmath49jy @xcite , making it probably the brightest stellar source at mm wavelengths , and mwc@xmath32349 with a flux of @xmath48jy at @xmath50 mm . optically thick free - free emission at mm wavelengths , with fluxes up to 1.5@xmath32jy , is also observed from _ symbiotic stars _",
    "@xcite , a class of active binaries involving mass transfer from a red giant to a compact , hot companion .",
    "the transition to the optically thin regime occurs at about 100 ghz for v1016 cyg @xcite and , in general , should not exceed 1 thz , i.e. is probably in the range covered by the planck mission .",
    "hot stars with shells , an heterogeneous class of objects , frequently have mm fluxes in the range 100 - 500@xmath32mjy , reaching up to 1.6 jy .",
    "their radio spectra usually have a turnover from optically thick to optically thin free - free emission around 510 ghz .",
    "the radio continuum spectra of _ planetary nebulae _ at ghz frequencies are generally consistent with optically thin free - free emission from the circumstellar material ionized by the hot central remnant .",
    "however a few cases are known of strongly inverted spectra , indicating optically thick emission up to 10 ghz ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the minimum of the spectral energy distribution for most classes of sources occurs at a few mm wavelengths , i.e. close to the peak frequency of the cmb .",
    "this is due to the steep increase with frequency of the dust emission spectrum in the mm / sub - mm region ( typically @xmath51 ) , which makes the crossover between radio and dust emission components only weakly dependent on their relative intensities ; moreover , dust temperatures tend to be higher for distant high luminosity sources , partially compensating for the effect of redshift .",
    "a consequence is that there is an abrupt change in the source populations of bright sources observed in channels above and below @xmath52 mm : radio sources dominate at longer wavelengths , while in the sub - mm region the planck instruments will mostly see dusty galaxies ( see figs . 1 and 2 ) .    by simply looking for peaks more than @xmath53 above the mean , we can recover sources brighter than a few to several hundred mjy , the exact value depending on the angular resolution of each channel and on the model dependent confusion noise ( see e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "it may be noted that only a negligible fraction ( @xmath54 in the case of gaussian fluctuations ) of true cmb anisotropies are misinterpreted as discrete sources by this approach .",
    "methods have been devised , allowing us to recover point sources from planck maps to substantially fainter flux levels .",
    "tegmark & de oliveira costa @xcite derived an optimal filter in the fourier domain , exploiting the point - like nature of sources , as opposed to the diffuse cmb and galactic emissions , to suppress the latter components .",
    "they showed that this method improves the ability to detect sources by factors between 2.5 and 18 , depending on the channel .",
    "hobson et al .",
    "@xcite applied a maximum entropy method to analyse simulated planck observations . by introducing information about the power spectrum of point sources in each frequency channel and the correlations between frequencies",
    ", they were able to effectively recover point sources down to 60 mjy for the 44 and 353 ghz channels , chosen because they lie near the centres of the frequency ranges of the lfi and hfi , respectively .",
    "ground based instruments , such as scuba on jcmt or the large mm / sub - mm arrays planned for the next decade , or dedicated space missions , such as first , will go much deeper but over small areas .",
    "for example , the scuba s field of view is @xmath55 arcmin@xmath56 , and the surveys carried out so far have covered areas between 0.002 and 0.1 square degrees , so that counts could be estimated only for sources fainter than about 10 mjy ( see fig .",
    "the field of view of the large millimeter array is expected to be @xmath57 ; about one month of observing time would be required to survey 2 square degrees to a sensitivity of 0.9 mjy ( @xmath53 ; see @xcite ) .",
    "the spire photometer on first , which has three bands with nominal wavelengths of 250 , 350 , and 500@xmath21 m , has a @xmath58 field of view ; a survey of 4 square degrees to a @xmath53 limit of 6.5 mjy would take about 1000 hours of observations @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the full sky coverage of the planck surveys makes it possible to determine the source counts up to jy levels , i.e. to extend them by about two orders of magnitude in flux .",
    "a broad range in fluxes is obviously essential to study the epoch dependent luminosity function .    a further important foreground component of the microwave sky is produced by the sunyaev - zeldovich effect in clusters of galaxies , whose flux changes of sign at mm wavelengths , passing through 0 at 217 ghz .",
    "planck covers the frequency range where the shape of the spectral energy distribution of active galactic nuclei is least known and where important spectral features , carrying essential information on physical conditions of sources , show up .",
    "observations at mm / sub - mm wavelengths often reveal the transition from optically thick to optically thin radio emission in the most compact regions .",
    "the self absorption frequency carries information on physical parameters .",
    "a systematic survey in the 30900 ghz range will , for example , allow us to see if there are systematic differences in the synchrotron turnover frequencies between e.g. bl lacs and quasars , as would be expected if bl lac emission is angled closer to our line of sight so that their turnovers are boosted to higher frequencies .",
    "correlations between turnover frequency and luminosity , which is also boosted by relativistic beaming effects , would help confirm current models .",
    "major high radio frequency flares have been observed in several compact radio sources ( e.g. pks  0528@xmath59134 , 3c  345 , ... ) .",
    "there are indications that the peak emission moves to lower frequencies as it ages .",
    "planck may catch the rise of the flare at the highest frequencies , missed by ground based observations .",
    "establishing the peak of the synchrotron emission is crucial also to understand if the emission at higher energies is to be attributed to compton scattering of the same synchrotron photons ( synchrotron self - compton ) or of seed photons external to the synchrotron emitting region .    the spectral break frequency , @xmath60 , at which the synchrotron spectrum steepens due to electron energy losses , is related to the magnetic field and to the `` synchrotron age '' @xmath61 ( in myr ) by : @xmath62 .",
    "the systematic multifrequency study at the planck frequencies will thus provide a statistical estimate of the radiosource ages .",
    "excess far - ir / sub - mm emission , possibly due to dust , is often observed from radio galaxies @xcite .",
    "planck data will allow us to assess whether this is a general property of these sources ; this would have interesting implications for the presence of interstellar matter in the host galaxies , generally identified with giant ellipticals , which are usually thought to be devoid of interstellar matter .      to date , the most detailed predictions of radio source counts at planck frequencies are those worked out by @xcite . the dotted line in figs .",
    "1 and 2 shows the predictions of a variant of their model , whereby the spectra of `` flat''-spectrum sources keep an @xmath63 slope up to frequencies of 1 thz , steepening to @xmath64 at higher frequencies .",
    "sokasian et al .",
    "@xcite have produced skymaps of bright radio sources at frequencies up to 300 ghz by means of detailed individual fits of the spectra of a large number of sources compiled from a number of catalogs , including the all sky sample of sources with @xmath65jy ( khr et al .",
    "their estimated number of sources brighter than @xmath66jy is about a factor of two below that predicted by @xcite .",
    "a very similar result was obtained by @xcite based on the observed distribution of 8.4@xmath67ghz spectral indices . on the other hand ,",
    "these empirical estimates yield , strictly speaking , lower limits , since sources with inverted spectra may be under - represented in the primary sample .",
    "furthermore , in the presence of substantial variability , estimates using mean fluxes underestimate actual counts of bright sources @xcite . anyway , as mentioned by @xcite , it is very encouraging that so different approaches yield results close to each other .    as shown by fig .",
    "1 , the models by @xcite predict that , at least for fluxes brighter than 0.1 jy , counts are dominated by radio sources for frequencies up to 217 ghz . these sources",
    "are therefore expected to have a considerable impact on cmb anisotropy measurements .      as already mentioned ,",
    "classes of sources are known with strongly inverted spectra , peaking at high frequencies , that would be either missing from , or strongly under - represented in low frequency surveys .",
    "ghz peaked spectrum radio sources ( gps ) appear to have a fairly flat distribution of peak frequencies extending out to 15 ghz in the rest frame @xcite , suggesting the existence of an hitherto unknown population of sources peaking at mm wavelengths @xcite . de zotti et al .",
    "@xcite suggested that from several tens to hundreds of gps sources could be detected by planck .",
    "thus , although these rare sources will not be a threat for studies of cmb anisotropies , we may expect that the planck surveys will provide crucial information about their properties .",
    "gps sources are important because they may be the younger stages of radio source evolution @xcite and may thus provide insight into the genesis of radio sources ; alternatively , they may be sources which are kept very compact by unusual conditions ( high density and/or turbulence ) in the interstellar medium of the host galaxy @xcite .",
    "high frequency free - free self absorption cutoffs may be present in agn spectra",
    ". ionized gas in the nuclear region free - free absorbs radio photons up to a frequency : @xmath68 free - free absorption cutoffs at frequencies @xmath69ghz may indeed be expected , in the framework of the standard torus scenario for type 1 and type 2 agns , for radio cores seen edge on , and may have been observed in some cases @xcite .",
    "they provide constraints on physical conditions in the parsec scale accretion disk or infall region for the nearest agns .",
    "planck may also allow us to study the nearest examples of another very interesting class of radio sources , powered by advection - dominated accretion flows @xcite .",
    "these may correspond to the final stages of accretion in large elliptical galaxies hosting a massive black hole .",

    "2 ) as well as of the far - ir to mm extragalactic background intensity ( fig .",
    "3 ) determined by @xcite . on the other hand , the model by @xcite overpredicts the background intensity at @xmath72 m . the model by @xcite yields a background intensity far in excess of the observational limits and will not be considered further .",
    "another important astrophysical foreground for cmb observations are clusters of galaxies . as predicted by @xcite the inverse compton scattering of cmb photons against the hot and diffuse electron gas trapped in the potential well of cluster of galaxies , and responsible for their x - ray emission ,",
    "yields a systematic shift of photons from the rayleigh - jeans to the wien side of the spectrum .",
    "thermal \" effect , arising from the thermal motions of the electrons , is described by the kompaneets @xcite equation which , in the non relativistic limit [ for a discussion of the relativistic sunyaev & zeldovich ( hereafter sz ) effect see , in this volume , itoh , rephaeli and sunyaev ] , leads to the familiar expression for the ( spectral ) intensity change across a cluster : @xmath73 where @xmath74 is the cmb temperature and @xmath75 . the spectral form of this  thermal effect \" is described by the function @xmath76/(\\hbox{e}^x -1)^2 $ ] , which is negative ( positive ) at values of @xmath77 smaller ( larger ) than @xmath78 , corresponding to a critical frequency @xmath79 ghz .",

    "the differences in the sz number counts are due to different assumptions and to the large uncertainties that we still have in the theoretical modelling of the effect . in short ,",
    "the differences are due to the following points :    * _ density fluctuation power spectrum _ : @xcite and @xcite use a simple power law power spectrum [ @xmath100 with spectral index of @xmath101 and @xmath102 , respectively ; @xcite and @xcite use scale - invariant initial conditions and take into account the transfer function appropriate for cold dark matter - like models [ @xmath103 . * _ normalization of the density fluctuation power spectrum _ : the amplitude of the power spectrum is normalized a posteriori in order to fit cluster observations ; @xcite normalize this amplitude in order to recover the cluster mass function of bahcall & cen @xcite , while @xcite normalize it to the cluster temperature function of @xcite ; @xcite normalize @xmath104 to the x - ray luminosity function of @xcite ( see also @xcite ) , while @xcite derive the integrated cluster temperature function from the original @xcite catalogue and use this function to normalize @xmath104 . * _ mass - temperature relation _ : simple scaling laws are used to derive , under the hydrostatic equilibrium hypothesis , the relation between the mass and the temperature of a cluster ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) : @xmath105^{1/2 } \\biggr({m\\over m_{15}}\\biggl)^{2/3 }   ( 1+z ) % \\eqno(6)\\ ] ] here @xmath106 is the non - linear density contrast of a cluster that collapsed at redshift @xmath97 , while @xmath107 is the temperature of a cluster of @xmath108 which collapses today . de luca et al . and barbosa et al .",

    "@xmath117 is not just a constant and can be written as follows : @xmath118 where @xmath119 is a constant and @xmath47 is assumed to be independent of @xmath86 : this is a good approximation if one considers only massive clusters ( see @xcite ) .",
    "this simple parameterization ( originally proposed by @xcite ) together with simple scaling laws provides in the case of a flat universe ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) : @xmath120 > from the observational point of view , the luminosity / temperature relation , @xmath121 , for x - ray clusters has been derived by several authors . as initially discussed by @xcite , the intrinsic dispersion of these @xmath122 relation",

    "@xcite derived the values @xmath125 and @xmath126 .",
    "this @xmath127 value , appropriate for a flat universe , lowers to @xmath128 for @xmath129 .",
    "thus , cluster formation is not a self  similar process : the mass of the ic gas is not a fixed fraction of the cluster total mass .",
    "the values of @xmath127 derived by @xcite provide very little evolution of the @xmath122 relation up to redshift @xmath130 , as found by @xcite with the asca data .",

    "the number of clusters that planck will be able to observe critically depends on the efficiency in separating planck observations into different physical components ( for a discussion on this point see @xcite and references therein ) . in any case it should be possible to select and measure a number of clusters , even without any component separation .",
    "the planck detection of sz clusters may provide an independent estimate of @xmath141 ( see , e.g. , @xcite ; see however @xcite for a different point of view ) , complementing the more precise one arising from the measurement of the angular power spectrum of the primary cmb anisotropy .",
    "the comparison of sz and x - ray measurements will yield an independent measure of the hubble constant @xcite ( see @xcite for a recent review ) .",
    "if the temperature structure of the cluster is simple , the relation between the sz flux and the x - ray temperature of a cluster provides a measure of the ic gas mass , independently of how the ic gas is distributed .",
    "this is due to the linear dependence of the sz effect on the electron density .",

    "this was confirmed to some extent by @xcite for the north celestial polar cap in a correlation of saskatoon data with the iras & dirbe maps .",
    "the h@xmath15 images of the north celestial pole ( ncp ) area made by @xcite have been analyzed by @xcite to provide an estimate of the spatial power spectrum on scales of 10@xmath147 to a few degrees .",
    "the slope they find , @xmath148 , is significantly flatter than that inferred by @xcite from cobe data ; however the rms amplitude is considerably lower , @xmath149 on @xmath150 scales at 53 ghz assuming a gas temperature @xmath151k , resulting in a lower signal at all scales of interest .",
    "the global power spectrum of dust emission fluctuations was determined by @xcite , based on iras @xmath152 m data , to be @xmath153 in the @xmath154@xmath58 range .",

    ". these are minimum at @xmath161ghz @xcite . for larger values of @xmath145",
    "the dominant contribution is from extragalactic sources ; their minimum contribution to the anisotropy signal occurs around 150 - 200@xmath32ghz .",
    "a poisson distribution of extragalactic point sources produces a simple white - noise power spectrum , with the same power in all multipoles .",
    "correspondingly , the point source fluctuations become increasingly important with decreasing angular scale ( i.e. , with increasing @xmath145 ) .",
    "thus the minimum in the global power spectrum of foreground fluctuations moves , at high galactic latitudes , from about 70 ghz for @xmath158 , where galactic emissions dominate , to 150 - 200@xmath32ghz at higher values of @xmath145 ( the exact value of the frequency of the minimum depends on the detailed spectral and evolutionary behaviour of sources ) .",
    "for the same reason , the frequency of minimum foreground fluctuations decreases with decreasing galactic latitude .",
    "figures 6 and 7 show the expected power spectra of the main foregrounds components in the lfi and hfi channels respectively .",
    "it is clear from fig .",
    "7 that the source removal is much more effective in reducing the fluctuation level at the lowest than at the highest frequencies .",
    "this is due to the fact that at @xmath162 mm , fluctuations are dominated by the brightest sources below the detection limit , while at shorter wavelengths the dominant population are evolving dusty galaxies whose counts are so steep ( see fig .",
    "1 ) that a major contribution to fluctuations comes from much fainter fluxes .",
    "figure 8 illustrates the frequency dependence of rms fluctuations in a beam of fwhm @xmath163 for several values of @xmath163 , while fig .",
    "9 shows the frequency dependence of the power spectrum for four values of @xmath145 .",
    "toffolatti et al .",
    "@xcite found that clustering contributions to fluctuations due to extragalactic sources is generally small in comparison with the poisson contribution .",
    "however , the latter contribution , at least in the case of radio sources , comes mostly from the brightest sources below the detection limit , while the clustering term is dominated by fainter sources .",
    "therefore , an efficient subtraction of sources decreases the poisson term much more effectively than the clustering term , which therefore becomes relatively more and more important .    in the case of a power law",
    "angular correlation function ( @xmath164 ) , the power spectrum of intensity fluctuations is ( eq .",
    "( 58.13 ) of @xcite ) : @xmath165 if this behaviour extends to large enough angular scales , i.e. to small enough values of @xmath145 , the clustering signal will ultimately become larger than the poisson anisotropy . on the other hand , for large values of @xmath163 , @xmath166 is expected to drop below the above power law approximation , and @xmath167 will correspondingly break down .    the preliminary estimates ( toffolatti et al .",
    ", in preparation ) reported in fig .",
    "10 are based on the correlation functions of radio sources derived by @xcite and by @xcite .",
    "the different slopes at large values of @xmath145 reflect different values of @xmath168 : the upper curve correspond to the larger value ( @xmath169 ) obtained by @xcite .",
    "scott & white @xcite have recently shown that if dusty galaxies cluster like the @xmath170 lyman break galaxies , at frequencies @xmath171ghz the anisotropies due to clustering may exceed the poisson ones on all scales accessible to planck ; in the 353@xmath32ghz ( @xmath71 m ) channel the clustering signal may exceed the primordial cmb anisotropies on scales smaller than about @xmath172 .",
    "it should be noted , however , that current models @xcite strongly suggest a broad redshift distribution of sources contributing to the autocorrelation function of the intensity fluctuations , implying a strong dilution of the clustering signal .",
    "a further substantial overestimate of the effect of clustering may follow from the extrapolation to degree scales , with constant slope , of the angular correlation function determined on scales of up to a few arcmin .",
    "indeed , a clustering signal much lower than estimated by @xcite was found by @xcite who modelled the full evolutionary history of galaxies .",
    "the polarized foreground spectra have not been studied as extensively as the intensity spectra . for a power law electron energy spectrum @xmath173 , the polarization level ,",
    "@xmath174 , yielded by a uniform magnetic field is @xcite : @xmath175 for a typical high frequency value of @xmath176 , @xmath177 .",
    "non - uniformities of the magnetic fields and differential faraday rotation decrease the polarization level .",
    "however , the faraday rotation optical depth is proportional to @xmath178 so that faraday depolarization is negligible at the high frequencies relevant for planck .    _",
    "free - free emission _ is not polarized .",
    "however , thompson scattering by electrons in the hii regions where it is produced , may polarize it tangentially to the edges of the electron cloud @xcite .",
    "the polarization level is expected to be small , with an upper limit of approximately 10% for an optically thick cloud .",
    "the intrinsic polarization of _ galactic dust emission _ is estimated to be @xmath179 @xcite .",
    "the observed polarization degree is smaller by a factor @xmath180 @xcite , where @xmath181 and @xmath182 are the reduction factors due to misalignments of grain axes with the magnetic field and to the different orientations of polarization vectors of different components along any line of sight , while the @xmath183 accounts for the projection of the direction of polarization on the plane of the sky .",
    "the level of polarized emission from galactic dust at high galactic latitudes has been estimated by @xcite . to ease the comparison with the cmb polarization , they considered two linear combinations of the stoke s parameters in fourier space : the e - mode , dominated by scalar perturbations , and the b - mode , produced by tensor perturbations . for galactic dust",
    "polarized emission , the power spectra of the two modes can be approximated by @xcite : @xmath184 @xmath185 they concluded that , at frequencies around 100 ghz , the power spectrum of this polarized component is below that of the scalar induced cmb polarization at @xmath186 , but is above the tensor induced cmb polarization expected for a flat , tilted cold dark matter model with spectral index of scalar perturbations @xmath187 .",
    "bouchet et al .",
    "@xcite have analized the possibility of extracting the power spectrum of cmb polarization fluctuations in the presence of polarized galactic foregrounds using a multifrequency wiener filtering of the data .",
    "they concluded that the power spectrum of e - mode polarization of the cmb can be extracted from planck data with fractional errors @xmath18830% for @xmath189 .",
    "the b - mode cmb polarization , whose detection would unambiguously establish the presence of tensor perturbations ( primordial gravitational waves ) , can be detected by planck with signal - to - noise @xmath1904 for @xmath191 by averaging over a 20% logarithmic range in multipoles .",
    "polarization of _ extragalactic sources _ , not considered by @xcite , can be an important issue as well .",
    "flat spectrum radio sources are typically 4 - 7% polarized at cm and mm wavelengths @xcite .",
    "for random orientations of the magnetic fields of sources along the field of view , the rms polarization fluctuations are approximately equal to intensity fluctuations times the mean polarization degree ( de zotti et al .",
    ", in preparation ) .",
    "as shown by figs . 6 and 7 , the experimental accuracy of the planck surveyor mission is effectively limited by astrophysical foregrounds . at high galactic latitudes , however ,",
    "fluctuations due to the galactic dust , free - free and synchrotron emission , which are the main foreground components for angular scales @xmath192 , are expected to be well below the primordial cmb anisotropies in several planck channels . on these angular scales ,",
    "i.e. for multipoles @xmath193 , foreground fluctuations are minimum at @xmath194ghz ( see figs . 8 and 9 ) .    on smaller scales ,",
    "the most troublesome foreground component are extragalactic sources . for wavelengths @xmath195 mm ,",
    "the dominant population is made of flat - spectrum and possibly of some inverted spectrum radio sources ; estimates using very different methods indicate that their counts can be evaluated , at the fluxes relevant to estimate fluctuations in planck channels , to better than a factor of 2 at frequencies up to at least 100 ghz .",
    "the uncertainty is larger for evolving dusty galaxies which are expected to dominate the counts at shorter wavelengths , but important constraints are set by scuba counts and by determinations of the extragalactic mm / sub - mm background spectrum .",
    "point source fluctuations are larger than cmb anisotropies on very small angular scales ( @xmath196 , see fig .",
    "9 ) . in the frequency region",
    "100200 ghz , however , their amplitude is significantly below the cmb signals for all scales accessible to planck instruments .",
    "fluctuations due to clustering are generally small in comparison with poisson fluctuations , at least in the case of radio sources ( fig .",
    "recent results indicating , in the case of evolving dusty galaxies , a clustering signal exceeding poisson fluctuations , are likely to be rather extreme upper limits .",
    "cmb polarization measurements are more challenging and the contamination by polarized foreground emissions has not been studied in depth . however , preliminary results suggest that the extraction of the cmb polarization is possible , with a signal to noise ratio @xmath197 , for @xmath198 .",
    "on the other hand , the study of foregrounds is of great interest per se .",
    "planck will carry out calibrated all - sky surveys at 9 frequencies between 30 and 860 ghz , covering an essentially unexplored spectral region .",
    "> from several hundred to many thousands of sources can be detected as @xmath199 peaks at each frequency .",
    "more refined analyses , exploiting the different spectral properties and the different angular scales of sources in comparison with cmb fluctuations , may increase the number of detectable source by substantial factors .",
    "planck will provide the best calibrated all sky maps of the diffuse galactic emissions ( synchrotron , free - free and dust ) , of the sunyaev - zeldovich effect in clusters of galaxies and of extragalactic sources .",
    "it will extend the counts of the latter by about two orders of magnitude in flux .",
    "the information provided by planck surveys will be unique : large area radio continuum surveys above 30 ghz are not feasible from the ground since the beam area of a given telescope scales as @xmath178 .",
    "planck measurements will also determine the spectral energy distribution of bright sources over a factor @xmath200 in frequency , covering a region where spectral features carrying essential information on physical conditions of sources show up ( self - absorption turnovers of very compact components , high frequency flares , breaks due to energy losses of relativistic electrons , ... ) .",
    "while lower frequency surveys provide much more detailed information relevant to define _ phenomenological _ evolution properties , surveys at mm wavelengths are unique to provide information on the _ physical _ properties .",
    "planck will also provide the first complete samples of the extremely interesting classes of extragalactic radio sources characterized by inverted spectra ( i.e. flux density increasing with frequency ) , which are very difficult to detect , and therefore are either missing from , or strongly underepresented in low frequency surveys and may be very difficult to distinguish spectrally from fluctuations in the cbr @xcite .    strongly inverted spectra up to tens of ghz can be produced in very compact , high electron density regions , by optically thick synchrotron emission or by free - free absorption .",

    "<S> although the planck surveyor mission is optimized to map the cosmic microwave background anisotropies , it will also provide extremely valuable information on astrophysical phenomena . </S>",
    "<S> we review our present understanding of galactic and extragalactic foregrounds relevant to the mission and discuss on one side , planck s impact on the study of their properties and , on the other side , to what extent foreground contamination may affect planck s ability to accurately determine cosmological parameters . </S>",
    "<S> planck s multifrequency surveys will be unique in their coverage of large areas of the sky ( actually , of the full sky ) ; this will extend by two or more orders of magnitude the flux density interval over which mm / sub - mm counts of extragalactic sources can be determined by instruments already available ( like scuba ) or planned for the next decade ( like the lsa - mma or the space mission first ) , which go much deeper but over very limited areas . </S>",
    "<S> planck will thus provide essential complementary information on the epoch - dependent luminosity functions . </S>",
    "<S> bright radio sources will be studied over a poorly explored frequency range where spectral signatures , essential to understand the physical processes that are going on , show up . the sunyaev - zeldovich effect , with its extremely rich information content , will be observed in the direction of a large number of rich clusters of galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> thanks again to its all sky coverage , planck will provide unique information on the structure and on the emission properties of the interstellar medium in the galaxy . at the same time , the foregrounds are unlikely to substantially limit planck s ability to measure the cosmological signals </S>",
    "<S> . even measurements of polarization of the primordial cosmic microwave background fluctuations appear to be feasible . </S>"
