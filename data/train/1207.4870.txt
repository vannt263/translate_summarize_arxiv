    "the central density of neutron stars exceed the nuclear saturation density ( @xmath2@xmath3 ) , thereby raising the idea that compact stars might contain deconfined and chirally restored quark matter in them .",
    "recently , @xcite the mass measurement of millisecond pulsar psr j1614 - 2230 has set a new robust mass limit for compact stars to be @xmath4m@xmath5 .",
    "this value , together with the mass of pulsar j1903 + 0327 of @xmath6m@xmath5 @xcite is much larger than any of the highest precisely measured pulsar mass .",
    "these measurement has set for the first time a very strong limit on parameters of the eos , which describes matter under extreme conditions @xcite .",
    "after the discovery of pulsar @xcite and connecting them with ns @xcite , various eos for nuclear matter has been proposed and refined @xcite .",
    "the quark sector is not much well understood as the nature of strong interaction at extreme condition still remains a challenge . the strange quark matter ( sqm )",
    "conjecture by itoh , witten @xcite consisting of almost equal number of up ( u ) , down ( d ) and strange ( s ) quarks was supported by model calculations @xcite .",
    "the most simple and popular model which describes the properties of quark matter at such high densities is the mit bag model @xcite .",
    "new refined models based on results from recent experiments in laboratories has been proposed @xcite",
    ". thus normal nuclear matter at high density and/or temperature is likely to be unstable against stable sqm and would eventually decay .",
    "compact objects therefore can be made of either nuclear matter or quark matter .",
    "stars which has only nuclear matter are called neutron stars ( ns ) .",
    "broadly there can be two classes of compact stars with quark matter .",
    "the first is the so - called ( strange ) quark stars ( ss ) of absolutely stable strange quark matter .",
    "the second are the so - called hybrid stars ( hs ) , along with the hadronic matter they have quarks matter in their interior either in form of a pure strange quark matter core or color superconducting matter . in between the quark and the hadronic phase a quark - hadron mixed phase exists .",
    "the size of the core depends on the critical density for the quark - hadron phase transition and the eos describing the matter phases .",
    "usually , the presence of strangeness in quark and hadronic matter provides an additional degree of freedom and softens the eos and therefore quark and hybrid stars can not reach high masses .",
    "thus the mass measurement of pulsar psr j1614 - 2230 puts forward a strong constraint on such eos .",
    "however , studies found that effects from the strong interaction , such as one - gluon exchange or color - superconductivity can stiffen the quark matter eos and increase their maximum mass @xcite .",
    "the first studies on the implications of the new mass limits from psr j1614 - 2230 for quark matter was done by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "they , however did not include the effects from color - superconductivity .",
    "the presence of magnetic field in compact stars has an important role in astrophysics .",
    "new observations suggests that in some pulsars the surface magnetic field can be as high as @xmath7 g .",
    "it has also been attributed that the observed giant flares , sgr 0526 - 66 , sgr 1900 + 14 and sgr 1806 - 20 @xcite , are the manifestation of such strong surface magnetic in those stars . such stars are separately assigned as magnetars .",
    "if we assume flux conservation from a progenitor star , we can expect the central magnetic field of such stars as high as @xmath8 g .",
    "such strong fields are bound to effect the ns properties .",
    "it can modify the metric describing the star @xcite or it can modify the eos of matter of the star .",
    "the effect of strong magnetic field , both for nuclear matter @xcite and quark matter @xcite has been studied earlier in detail .",
    "motivated by recent observations of maximum mass limits of compact stars and strong magnetic field in magnetars , in this work we want to explore their implications on the eos of both phases of matter that may be present inside a neutron star .",
    "we study the hadron - quark phase transition inside a compact star with a mixed phase region in between the quark core and nuclear outer region .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we discuss the nuclear eos and the effect of landau quantization due to magnetic field on the charged particles . in sec .",
    "iii we employ the simple mit bag model for the quark matter eos and the effect of magnetic field on the quarks ( also due to landau quantization ) . in section iv we develop the mixed phase region by glendenning construction .",
    "we show our results in section v for the density dependent bag constant and varying magnetic field for the mixed hs .",
    "finally we summarize our results and draw some conclusion in section vi .",
    "at normal nuclear density the degrees of freedom for the eos are hadrons .",
    "to describe the hadronic phase , we use a non - linear version of the relativistic mean field ( rmf ) model with hyperons ( tm1 parametrization ) which is widely used to construct eos for ns . in this model",

    "a compact star becomes unstable if the magnetic field strength becomes much greater than @xmath63 g , and so many authors have neglected quantum mechanical effect of magnetic field on s - quarks @xcite but in our calculation we include the quantum mechanical effect for all particles .    assuming the strange quark matter also to be charge neutral and in chemical equilibrium , we may write as @xmath64 @xmath65 the baryon number density is given by @xmath66 solving the above eqs([eq : ch ] , [ eq : cha ] , [ eq : ba ] ) numerically , we obtain the chemical potentials of all the flavors and electron .",

    "thus the matter can be treated as a two - component system , and can be parametrized by two chemical potentials , usually the pair ( @xmath71 ) , i.e. , electron and baryon chemical potential . to maintain mechanical equilibrium , the pressure of the two phases are equal . satisfying the chemical and beta equilibrium the chemical potential of different species",

    "initially , the mass for the star with magnetic field is higher , but the maximum mass is lower than the non magnetic case , because the non magnetic eos is steeper than the magnetic counterpart . the stiffness ( or flatness ) of the pressure vs energy density curve for a particular eos is reflected in the stiffness ( or flatness ) of the corresponding mass - radius curve .    0.2 in mev .",
    "curves are plotted without magnetic field and with same magnetic field , of field strength @xmath131 g but different @xmath105.,title=\"fig:\",width=288 ]    0.2 in mev and @xmath80mev .",
    "the curves are plotted without magnetic field and with magnetic field , of strength @xmath131 g having same @xmath124.,title=\"fig:\",width=288 ]    0.2 in mev .",
    "two curves are plotted , one without magnetic field and one with magnetic field , having strength @xmath131 g and @xmath124.,title=\"fig:\",width=288 ]    next in fig [ fig19 ] , we plot curves with varying bag constant ( @xmath82mev ) for two different value of alpha ( @xmath145 and @xmath146 ) , with field strength of @xmath147 g .",
    "both the magnetic field and bag pressure are density dependent .",
    "the magnetic field makes the mass - radius curve flatter . as the magnetic field variation becomes higher , increasing the magnetic field strength as we go inwards , and thereby making the eos flat .",
    "as the eos becomes flat the mass - radius curve also becomes flat , and the maximum mass decreases .",
    "t compare the mass dependence on varying magnetic field and varying bag pressure we have plotted curves for two different set of curves with varying bag pressure @xmath82 and @xmath80mev ( fig [ fig20 ] ) .",
    "each set comprising of two curves one without magnetic field and one with magnetic field , of strength @xmath147 g .",
    "the qualitative nature of the curves remains same due the reasons discussed earlier .",
    "as it has been pointed out , with varying bag constant and varying magnetic field we can have mixed phase eos with bag pressure of @xmath132mev . in fig [ fig21 ]",
    ", we have plotted the mass - radius curve for @xmath133mev , with ( @xmath147 g ) and without magnetic field .",
    "the magnetic field is varying having @xmath105 of @xmath146 .",
    "the maximum mass for this case is obtained without the magnetic field effect and the introduction of the magnetic field makes the curve flatter and also reduces the maximum mass .",
    "the maximum mass of a mixed hybrid star obtained with such mixed phase region is @xmath148 .",
    "recently , after the discovery of high - mass pulsar psr j1614 - 2230 @xcite with mass of about @xmath149 , the eoss describing the interior of a compact star have been put to severe constraint .",
    "the @xcite typical values of the central density of j1614 - 2230 , for the allowed eoss is in the range 2@xmath150 - 5@xmath150 . on the other hand",
    ", consideration of the eos independent analysis of @xcite sets the upper limit of central density at @xmath127 . for a constant bag pressure ,",
    "the mass of the hs is about @xmath151 solar mass ( fig [ fig18 ] ) . with a varying bag pressure",
    ", the maximum mass limit can be increased .",
    "the maximum mass limit of mixed phase eos star with the above given set of eos , with strange mass of @xmath132mev is calculated to be @xmath152 solar mass .",
    "the maximum mass for the mixed hybrid star can be increased to @xmath153 @xcite solar mass with s - quark mass of @xmath154mev and varying bag pressure of @xmath51 mev .",
    "therefore the mass limit set by the observation of pulsar prs j1614 - 2230 can be maintained by the mixed hybrid star having density dependent bag constant .",
    "but for this particular choice , the mixed phase region is very small .",
    "it should be mentioned here that this mass limit is only for this set of nuclear and quark matter eoss .",
    "using very stiff eos sets ( hadronic nl3 and quark quark njl model ) the maximum mass limit for the mixed hybrid star can be raised much higher as pointed by lenzi & lugones @xcite .",
    "the main aim of this paper was to show the effect of magnetic field on the mixed phase eos and its effect on the maximum mass of a star .",
    "we were also interested in showing whether simple eos ( hyperonic nuclear and mit bag quark ) can reach the limit set by psr j1614 - 2230 .",
    "the other most interesting fact of this calculation is that the mixed hybrid star has radius corresponding to the maximum mass , quite different from the nuclear and strange star .",
    "they are not as compact as strange stars and their radius lies between the nuclear and strange star .",
    "it is also clear from our calculation that , if the magnetic field influence the eos only through the landau quantization , it has a negative effect on the matter pressure thereby making the eos softer , and the star becomes less massive .",
    "to summarize , we have studied the effect of magnetic field on the nuclear and quark matter eos .",
    "we have taken into account landau quantization effect on the charged particles of both the eos .",
    "we have considered relativistic mean field eos model for the nuclear matter eos . for the quark matter eos",
    ", we have considered simple mit bag model with density dependent bag constant .",
    "the nuclear matter eos is much stiffer than the quark matter eos , and so the effect of magnetic field is much more pronounced in the quark matter . the magnetic field due to landau quantization softens the eos for both the matter phases since the magnetic pressure contributes negatively to the matter pressure .",
    "here we should mention that the effect of magnetization of matter is important for strong magnetic fields , however it is believed that in ns such magnetization is mall @xcite .",
    "therefore in our calculation we have neglected such effect .",
    "glendenning construction @xcite , determines the range of baryon density where both phases coexist . at densities below the mixed phase ,",
    "the system is in the charge neutral hadronic phase , and for densities above the mixed phase the system is in charge neutral quark phase .",
    "we have considered density dependent bag pressure , which has been parametrized according to the gaussian form .",
    "we have fixed the lowest value of the bag pressure to be @xmath97mev , known from the experiments @xcite .",
    "accordingly , we have also considered varying magnetic field .",
    "observationally , the inferred surface magnetic field of a ns may be as high as @xmath92 g and is believed to increase at the center . as the density decreases with increasing radial distance ,",
    "we have taken the parametrization of the magnetic field as a function of density , having maximum field strength at the core .",
    "considering density dependent bag pressure and magnetic field , we construct mixed phase eos following glendenning construction .    we find that the effect of magnetic field is insignificant unless the surface field is of the order of @xmath0 g .",
    "such constant magnetic field value has no effect on the nuclear matter eos and has very little effect on the mixed and quark matter eos . for a varying magnetic field",
    "whose surface value is @xmath0 g but whose central value is of the order of @xmath1 g , we find significant effect on the stiffness of the eos and also on the the extend of the mixed phase region in the eos .",
    "as the bag pressure increases the eos for the quark phase becomes soft , and hence more the effect of magnetic field . at the central region ,",
    "the bag pressure decreases but the magnetic field increases , and so their respective effect on the eos act in the opposite direction .",
    "the magnetic field increases as we go to much higher densities , and so the boundary between the mixed phase and the quark phase changes with increasing field strength . as the magnetic field increases , the eos becomes less stiffer and the phase boundary between the mixed and quark phase shifts upwards to the higher density value . towards the low density regime of the curve the effect of magnetic field",
    "is less pronounced , as the magnetic field strength is less and also the nuclear matter eos is much stiffer .",
    "therefore the phase boundary between the nuclear and mixed phase is less affected .    the maximum mass limit of mixed phase eos star is also shown in this paper .",
    "we obtain a significant mixed phase region with central bag constant of @xmath132mev having s - quark mass of @xmath51mev . for higher s - quark mass ( @xmath154mev )",
    "we get a small mixed phase region with bag pressure @xmath51mev .",
    "for such a case we find the maximum mass for a mixed hybrid star with the given set of eos is @xmath155 .",
    "the maximum mass is obtained without magnetic field effect and the introduction of the magnetic field reduces the maximum mass .",
    "therefore the mass limit set by the observation of pulsar prs j1614 - 2230 is maintained by the mixed star with varying bag constant .",
    "our calculation also shows that the mixed hybrid star has radius ( for the maximum mass ) quite different from the neutron or strange star , their radius lying between the neutron and strange star .",
    "observationally , the surface magnetic field of most of the pulsars are in the ranges of @xmath156 to @xmath157 g .",
    "such fields have almost no effect in the eos of matter in those stars .",
    "however , for magnetars the magnetic fields are very high ( @xmath158 g ) .",
    "flux conservation from progenitor stars can give rise to magnetic field of field strength @xmath159 orders higher .",
    "the mass - radius relationship for a mixed hybrid star is quite different from the pure neutron or strange star , and so it is likely to have different observational characteristics .",
    "it is also clear that magnetars are different from normal pulsars , as they have lesser mass due to flatter eos .",
    "it is to be mentioned here that we have only considered effect from landau quantization and found that they have significant effect on the mixed phase region once it is greater than @xmath0 g .",
    "here we have not considered the effect from anomalous magnetic moment .",
    "anomalous magnetic moment stiffens the eos , but their effect is significant if the magnetic field strength is of the order of @xmath160 g . for such high magnetic fields",
    "the ns becomes unstable .",
    "therefore our consideration of only the effect from landau quantization seems alright .",
    "as the interiors of the compact stars are hidden from direct observation , we have to rely only on the observations coming from their surface .",
    "recent developments has been made on measuring accurately the mass of compact stars but a exact measurement of their radius is still not possible @xcite .",
    "the knowledge of the radius of a compact stars can really give us the hint of the matter components at the star interiors , as we have seen here that different eos provide different mass - radius relationship .",
