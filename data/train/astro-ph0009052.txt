    "systematic distortions in the shapes and orientations of high redshift background galaxies are induced by mass inhomogeneities along the line of sight . in strong lensing ,",
    "a single massive foreground cluster will cause background galaxies to be significantly magnified and distorted .",
    "weak lensing , on the other hand , measures the cumulative effect of less massive systems along the line of sight statistically ( gunn 1967 ; blandford et al . 1991 ; miralda - escude 1991 ; kaiser 1992 ; see a recent review by bartelmann & schneider 1999 ) .",
    "the lensing effect depends only on the projected surface mass density and is independent of the luminosity or the dynamical state of the mass distribution .",
    "thus , this technique can potentially provide invaluable constraints on the distribution of matter in the universe and the underlying cosmological model ( bernardeau , van waerbeke & mellier 1997 ; van waerbeke , bernardeau & mellier 1999 ) .",
    "there has been considerable progress in theoretical calculations of the effects of weak lensing by large - scale structure , both analytically and using ray - tracing through cosmological n - body simulations ( kaiser 1992 ; bernardeau , van waerbeke & mellier 1997 ; jain & seljak 1997 ; jain , seljak & white 2000 ) .",
    "recently , several teams have reported observational detections of ` cosmic shear '  weak lensing on scales ranging from an arc - minute to ten arc - minutes ( van waerbeke et al .",
    "2000 ; bacon , refregier & ellis 2000 ; wittman et al",
    ". 2000 ; kaiser , wilson & luppino 2000 ) .",
    "at present , these studies are limited by observational effects , such as shot noise due to the finite number of galaxies and the accuracy with which shapes can actually be measured given the optics and seeing ( kaiser 1995 ; bartelmann & schneider 1999 ; kuijken 1999 ) .",
    "in addition , the intrinsic ellipticity distribution of galaxies and their redshift distribution is still somewhat uncertain .",
    "these observational difficulties can be potentially overcome with more data .",
    "however , an important theoretical issue remains . in modeling the distortion produced by lensing",
    ", it is assumed that the a priori intrinsic correlations in the shapes and orientations of background galaxies are negligible .",
    "correlations in the intrinsic ellipticities of neighboring galaxies are expected to arise from the galaxy formation process , for example as a consequence of correlations between the angular momenta of galaxies when they assemble .",
    "we compute the strength of these correlations in linear theory , in the context of gaussian initial fluctuations .    to do so , we approximate the projected shape of a galaxy on the sky by an ellipsoid with semi - axes @xmath2 , @xmath3 ( @xmath4 ) .",
    "the orientation of the ellipsoid depends on the angle @xmath5 between the major axis and the chosen coordinate system , while its magnitude is given by @xmath6 .",
    "both the magnitude of the ellipticity and its orientation can be concisely described by the complex quantity @xmath7 , @xmath8.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the superscript @xmath9 denotes the observed shape .    in the linear regime and under the assumption of weak lensing",
    ", the lensing equation can be written as , @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the complex shear and @xmath12 the intrinsic shape of the source ( kochanek 1990 ; miralda - escude 1991 ) .",
    "furthermore , in the weak regime , correlations of this distortion field are @xmath13 where the @xmath14 denotes complex conjugation .. ] in this paper we will examine the first term , which arises from intrinsic shape correlations .",
    "previous analyses have focused on the third term of this expression , correlations due to weak lensing .",
    "the second term , which is due to correlations between the lensing galaxies and the intrinsic shapes of the galaxies being lensed , will not be addressed here .",
    "naively however , we expect this contribution to be small , since the mean distance between the lensing and lensed galaxies far exceeds the distance scale over which angular momentum correlations are important .",
    "we will assume that shape correlations arise primarily from correlations in the direction of the angular momentum vectors of neighboring galaxies .",
    "spiral galaxies are disk - like with the angular momentum vector perpendicular to the plane of the disk , so that angular momentum couplings will be translated into shape correlations .",
    "we will assume that for ellipticals the angular momentum vector also lies along its shortest axis on average , as it does for the spirals .",
    "however , since elliptical galaxies are intrinsically more round , the correlation amplitude will be smaller .",
    "below we will use the observed ellipticity distributions of each morphological type in the computation of the shape correlations . for weak lensing , in contrast , the induced shape correlations are independent of the original shapes of the lensed galaxies . in the next sub - sections we will briefly review the origin of angular momentum and recent work on understanding intrinsic ellipticity correlations .",
    "the angular momentum of the matter contained in a volume @xmath15 is defined as , @xmath16 \\times { \\mathbf { v}}({\\mathbf { r } } , t)\\,\\rho({\\mathbf{r}},t ) \\,d^3 r,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath17 is the center of mass and @xmath18 is the density .",
    "hoyle ( 1949 ) suggested that the origin of galactic angular momentum is tidal torquing between the proto - galaxy and the surrounding matter distribution .",
    "most of the angular momentum of an object is imparted before the over - dense region completely collapses . after collapse",
    ", tidal torquing will be inefficient and the object will simply conserve its spin .",
    "peebles ( 1969 ) used perturbation theory to calculate the growth rate of angular momentum contained within a comoving spherical region .",
    "for such a spherical region , there are no torques initially , so the growth occurs at second order as a result of convective effects on the bounding surface .",
    "in contrast , doroshkevich ( 1970 ) showed that the angular momentum of a proto - galaxy grows at first order since , in general , proto - galactic regions are not spherical , generating an initial tidal torque .",
    "white ( 1984 ) described this process using the zeldovich ( 1970 ) approximation and showed that the spin grows linearly in time , for an einstein - de sitter universe .",
    "following white ( 1984 ) , we consider the growth of fluctuations in an expanding friedmann universe filled with pressure - free dust ( @xmath19 ) in lagrangian perturbation theory .",
    "the trajectory of a dust particle can be written in comoving coordinates @xmath20 in terms of the gradient of the gravitational potential @xmath21 , @xmath22 ( zeldovich 1970 ) .",
    "@xmath23 describes the growth of modes in linear theory and is proportional to the cosmological expansion factor , @xmath24 , for an einstein de - sitter model . in terms of the lagrangian coordinates @xmath25 , the expression for angular momentum becomes @xmath26 \\times   { \\mathbf { \\dot x}}\\,\\,d^3 q \\simeq \\rho_0 a^5 \\int_{v_l}[{\\mathbf { q } } -   { \\bar{\\mathbf { q } } } ] \\times   { \\mathbf { \\dot x}}\\,\\,d^3 q,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath27 is the present mean matter density and @xmath28 is the lagrangian volume that corresponds to @xmath15 .",
    "the latter expression is correct to second order since @xmath29 is parallel to the displacement .",
    "we can progress by expanding the gradient of the gravitational potential in a taylor series around the center of mass , @xmath30 where the shear tensor is defined as the second derivative of the gravitational potential , @xmath31 the angular momentum of a collapsing proto - galactic region before turnaround then is given by , @xmath32 @xmath33 is the moment of inertia of the matter in the collapsing volume , @xmath34 note that the volume element that initially contains the matter is in fact much larger than that of the final galaxy in comoving coordinates . in this picture , the angular momentum is constant after turnaround .",
    "this formalism has been used to study how angular momentum arises during galaxy formation .",
    "heavens and peacock ( 1988 ) used eulerian perturbation theory to compute the modulus of the angular momentum for galaxies , assuming the object to form at the peak of a gaussian field ( bardeen et al .",
    "they found that there is a broad distribution in the angular momenta of collapsed objects , which is only weakly correlated with the heights of the density peaks around which galaxies form .",
    "catelan & theuns ( 1996a [ ct96a ] ) expanded on this , working in lagrangian space instead of eulerian space .",
    "the results from these two approaches are very similar , but the resulting expressions are simpler for the lagrangian case .",
    "ct96a approximated the shape of the object in lagrangian space by an ellipsoid , which allowed the study of how angular momentum was correlated with other aspects of the matter distribution , such as its mass or its prolateness .",
    "the results of this analysis allows one to compute joint probability distributions , for example between the mass and spin of a halo .",
    "these were found to be in good agreement with the results from numerical simulations ( sugerman , summers and kamionkowski 2000 ) .",
    "extending their approach , catelan and theuns ( 1996b ) used second - order lagrangian perturbation theory to estimate the contribution of non - linear effects , which they showed to be small .",
    "they also investigated the consequences of non - gaussian primordial perturbations ( catelan & theuns 1997 ) , which they showed could have a significant effect on galactic spins .",
    "lee & pen ( 2000 ) re - examined the origin of angular momentum on galaxy scales and studied the statistics of both the magnitude and the direction of the present day spin distribution using numerical simulations .",
    "they developed a method to reconstruct the gravitational field , using only the direction of the angular momenta , since the predictions for its magnitude have a large variance .",
    "a central issue in determining the magnitude of @xmath35 is the degree of correlation between the principal axes of the inertia tensor and gravitational shear tensor .",
    "ct96a attempted to take this into account around peaks , and found that such a correlation reduces the angular momentum by a small factor .",
    "lee & pen ( 2000 ) demonstrated using numerical simulations that this factor is in fact non - negligible .",
    "they however conclude that the approximation made by ct96a is adequate for determining the direction of the angular momentum vector but not for the magnitude . here",
    "we extend the treatment of lee & pen ( 2000 ) and much of our notation and formalism follows their paper .",
    "there have been a number of preprints on this subject recently .",
    "we briefly review some of the results obtained by other groups here and we will compare our calculations and results with these in more detail in subsequent sections .",
    "two groups , heavens et al .",
    "( 2000 ) and croft & metzler ( 2000 ) , have attempted to measure the strength of intrinsic correlations from high resolution cosmological n - body simulations ( that evolve only the dark matter component ) of the virgo collaboration ( jenkins et al .",
    "1998 ; thomas et al . 1998 ; pearce et al . 1999 ) .",
    "some assumption must be made to relate the dark matter halos in numerical simulations to the expected ellipticity of the luminous galaxies that form within them .",
    "croft & metzler ( 2000 ) measure the projected ellipticities of dark matter halos and the correlation of pairs as a function of separation .",
    "they then assumed that halo shapes are synonymous with galaxy shapes , and having done so claim to find a positive signal for the correlation on scales of the order of 20 h@xmath36 mpc ( limited by the largest box size available ) .",
    "the results obtained in three dimensions were then projected into two dimensional angular ellipticity correlation functions , taking into account the viewing angle .",
    "they compute the induced correlations in the ellipticity and compare to recent reported measurements of the observed lensing signal . while there is a large uncertainty arising due to the unknown redshift distribution of the sheared background galaxies",
    ", they find that at most 10 - 20% of the measured signal could be attributed to contamination from residual intrinsic correlations .",
    "heavens et al .",
    "( 2000 ) have studied correlations in the intrinsic shapes of spiral galaxies also using the virgo simulations .",
    "they use the angular momentum of the halo ( rather than the actual shape as done by croft & metzler ) and assume that its direction is perpendicular to that of a thin disk .",
    "they compute the 3-d ellipticity correlation function and its 2-d projection directly from simulations populated by @xmath37 halos .",
    "they also conclude on comparing with recent measurements of the shear induced by lensing on large scales that the contamination from intrinsic correlations is small on most angular scales of interest - the contamination is roughly at the 10 - 20% level on scales of @xmath38 .",
    "catelan , kamionkowski & blandford ( 2000 ) have recently presented an analytic calculation to assess the importance of intrinsic galaxy shape alignments and the consequent mimicking of the signal produced by weak gravitational lensing .",
    "they make the _ ansatz _ that the ellipticity is linearly proportional to the tidal shear and calculate correlations due to intrinsic shape correlations as a function of scale .",
    "( while originally meant to apply to ellipticity correlations resulting from angular momentum couplings , catelan et al .",
    "now use this _ ansatz _ only for ellipticities induced by the halo shapes .",
    "[ m. kamionkowski , private communication .",
    "] ) they also consider possible means of discriminating the lensing signal from intrinsic allignments .",
    "very recently , the first observational detection of the magnitude of spin - spin correlations has been reported by pen , lee & seljak ( 2000 ) .",
    "they construct the simplest quadratic two - point spin - spin correlation function in the context of linear perturbation theory and compare the statistic computed for galaxies in the tully catalog .",
    "they claim a detection at the 97% confidence level out to a few mpc .",
    "several authors have pointed out that one of the important discriminants between the correlations arising due to lensing versus those from intrinsic alignments is the prediction of the existence of non - zero ` b - type ' curl modes in the shear field in the intrinsic case ( kaiser 1992 ; stebbins 1996 ; kamionkowski et al . 1998 ) . a detailed decomposition of the shear field into the ` b ' and `",
    "e ' , or pure gradient , modes for intrinsic correlations is presented in crittenden et al .",
    "( 2000 ) .",
    "our goal is to calculate the two point correlation of the intrinsic shape distribution of galaxies , @xmath39 , as a function of projected distance .",
    "since the following calculation is quite complex , we present a brief schematic outline to guide the reader and to clarify the simplifying assumptions that we make .",
    "our approach is primarily analytic , but we also use numerical realizations of gaussian fields to verify some of our results .",
    "the intrinsic ellipticity of a galaxy depends on its three dimensional shape , its orientation and on the direction of its angular momentum , @xmath40 .",
    "here we use @xmath41 to denote the shape and orientation degrees of freedom .",
    "we will implicitly assume that the galaxy is ellipsoidal and that its angular momentum lies parallel to the shortest axis of the ellipsoid .",
    "the expected correlation between ellipticities at different points is @xmath42 where @xmath43 denotes the joint probability distribution .",
    "the present three - dimensional shapes of galaxies , quantified via their axis ratios , are primarily determined by ` local ' processes like the extent of dissipation within the collapsing dark matter halo .",
    "thus , we will assume that they are uncorrelated between neighboring galaxies , so that we can rewrite , @xmath44 .",
    "for each galaxy , we can then integrate over all possible shapes and orientations to find the average ellipticity of a galaxy with angular momentum in a given direction , @xmath45 .",
    "this integration is described in detail in section 2 .",
    "the resulting correlation is then simply given by , @xmath46 to proceed we need to understand the correlations between the directions of the angular momentum vectors of galaxies , or explicitly the nature of @xmath47 rather than attempt to calculate the angular momentum correlations directly , we instead relate them to correlations in the shear tensor , @xmath48 , which yields itself more easily to linear theory .    as discussed above , the angular momentum of a given galaxy depends on the tidal field and the moment of inertia , @xmath49 , of all the matter that has turned around and which will eventually collapse to form the galaxy . to compute @xmath50 , one needs the full joint probability function , @xmath51 .",
    "we make the simplifying assumption that the moment of inertia at a given point is significantly correlated only with the shear at that point , so that @xmath52 . given a form for @xmath53 , one can derive @xmath54 .",
    "however , since the local stress tensor depends on the details of the mass distribution outside the collapsed object as well , @xmath53 is not accurately known . in section 3 , we follow lp00 and assume that @xmath54 is gaussian , and use the most general form that the correlation matrix could have as a function of the shear tensor .",
    "this allows us to derive an expression for @xmath55 , the expected mean ellipticity for a given shear tensor .    with these assumptions ,",
    "the ellipticity correlation depends only on how the tidal field is correlated from place to place , @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the correlation matrix of the shear tensor , which will be gaussian distributed if the underlying fluctuations are gaussian .",
    "the ellipticity correlation is now only a function of the separation @xmath58 . in section 4",
    ", we calculate the correlations of the shear tensor as well as the moments required to find @xmath59 . later in section 4",
    ", we also examine how the correlations of the shear change if they are sampled only at peaks of the density .",
    "this is to account for the fact that we are sampling galaxies , which do not form at random positions in space .",
    "till now , the ellipticity correlations we have been considering are in three dimensions . these correlations must be projected into two dimensions to compare with weak lensing predictions and measurements . in section 5",
    ", we do this projection using limber s equation ( limber 1953 ) .",
    "this allows us to take into account the clustering of galaxies whose ellipticities are sampled .    in section 6",
    ", we examine the implications of our results for weak lensing observations and the prospects for measuring the intrinsic signal in on - going surveys like the sdss and 2df .",
    "we conclude in section 7 , with a more detailed discussion of our assumptions and the uncertainties involved in our calculations .",
    "in this section , we relate the observed , projected shapes of galaxies to their three - dimensional shapes in the absence of lensing . when calculating intrinsic shape correlations , it is important to take into account the distribution of three dimensional shapes since the strength of the signal depends strongly on it .",
    "for example , a spherical galaxy will appear round when viewed from any angle , consequently its presence will tend to suppress intrinsic shape correlations .",
    "we first consider the simplest case , where the galaxies are modeled as thin disks , with the angular momentum vector perpendicular to the disk plane .",
    "this is a fairly good approximation for spiral galaxies .",
    "we then consider the effects of projecting more realistic galaxy shapes , modeling them to be tri - axial with gaussian distributed axis ratios .",
    "for a galaxy with a thin disk , the exact dependence of the observed ellipticity is easy to calculate .",
    "the shape of such a disk - like galaxy depends strongly on the observing angle , appearing round ( @xmath60 ) when viewed face on and very elongated ( @xmath61 ) when viewed edge on .",
    "when viewed from an angle @xmath62 with respect to the perpendicular , the disk will be foreshortened by a factor of @xmath63 in one direction .",
    "the magnitude of the observed ellipticity is then , @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the unit spin vector .",
    "the observed ellipse has its long axis oriented perpendicular to the projected angular momentum vector , so that @xmath66    for realistic galaxies , however , the relation between the observed and intrinsic shapes can be much more complicated .",
    "the finite thickness of the galaxy puts an upper limit on how elongated the observed shape can be .",
    "observed galaxy samples also contain a mix of morphological types  ellipticals , spirals and spheroidals  each of which has a different distribution of intrinsic shapes .",
    "we consider the intrinsic shape distributions found by lambas , maddox & loveday ( 1992 ; lbl hereafter ) , extracted from the bright galaxy survey of the apm catalog .",
    "they used triaxial models to describe the observed ellipticity distributions of the various morphological classes and obtained fits for the distribution of the underlying axes ratios .",

    "the best - fit parameters for spirals were found to be @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",
    "lml also demonstrated that simple oblate or prolate models were not capable of reproducing the observations for elliptical galaxies and that triaxial models were required .",
    "for ellipticals , the best - fit parameters were found to be @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",
    "finally , the best - fit parameters for spheroidals were found to be @xmath74 and @xmath75 .",

    ", @xmath78 is different for each morphological type .",
    "the maxima , corresponding to when the galaxies are seen edge on , are significantly less than 1 due to the finite thicknesses of the galaxies .",
    "interestingly , however , the dependence of @xmath78 on @xmath62 for each of the morphological classes roughly scales identically to the disk case .",
    "that is , it is a good approximation to assume the same functional dependence on angle with an overall scaling : @xmath79 where @xmath80 is a measure of the relative galaxy thickness . for the more realistic distributions ,",
    "@xmath81 ranges from 0.85 for spirals , down to around 0.5 for spheroids and ellipticals .",
    "the mean redshift of the apm survey is @xmath82 and the composition of the sample is roughly 10% ellipticals , 25% spheroidals and 65% spirals .",
    "while these fractions might be representative of a local field sample , the redshift distribution of background galaxies of interest in lensing studies is considerably higher , so the morphological mix could be much different . to examine if this is the case , we plot both the distribution of ellipticities for the lbl populations and that measured for lensing studies @xmath83 ( brainerd et al .",
    "1996 ; ebbels et al . 2000 ) , which is represented by the dashed curve on the right panel .",
    "the lbl distributions provide a poor fit to the results of the higher redshift field surveys",
    ". this could be due to two effects : either a different morphological mix or a different , perhaps non - gaussian , distribution of intrinsic axis ratios for spirals .",
    "in addition , since the higher redshift surveys are more likely to be dominated by irregulars , the intrinsic shape distributions are expected to evolve .    though we find that the lbl distributions on the whole provide a poor - fit to that from lensing studies",

    "this is consistent with the mean value for @xmath81 computed from the apm sample on the left panel of figure 1 . in the following sections",
    ", we will be explicitly computing correlations between the components of @xmath88 in order to calculate @xmath89 based on the definition in eqn . ( 15 ) .",
    "we wish to relate the ellipticity directly to the tidal field .",
    "the easiest way to do so is to consider the real and imaginary pieces of the distortion field separately : @xmath90 when the observation frame coincides with the frame where the stress tensor is diagonal , @xmath91 and the expected distortion is purely real .",
    "next we need to relate the angular momentum to the tidal field .",
    "one central assumption in this work is that the expectation value of the angular momentum at a point is solely a function of the tidal tensor at that point . as the next step in calculating ellipticity correlations , we need to understand this relationship more quantitatively .",
    "that is , we need to know the probability of a given spin direction for a specified shear field , or effectively the form of @xmath92 as discussed above , the angular momentum of a collapsing region is given by @xmath93 the crucial issue is how the moment of inertia for a collapsing object is related to the tidal field that it experiences .",
    "unfortunately , this requires a precise understanding of what determines the region which eventually collapses into the galaxy , which in turn depends on the positions of nearby over - densities .",
    "this remains a major unsolved problem .",
    "catelan and theuns ( ct96a ) , studying the variance of the amplitude of the angular momentum of galaxies , initially assumed that the tidal tensor and the moment of inertia are entirely uncorrelated .",
    "however , since galaxies form preferentially at density peaks , ct96a also consider the suppression of angular momentum that arises around peaks in a gaussian due to correlations between the inertia and the shear . in both of these cases , if one considers the frame where the inertia tensor is diagonal , the off - diagonal terms of the shear tensor are expected to be uncorrelated with the inertia tensor .",
    "however , around peaks the amplitude of these off - diagonal terms is suppressed , which results in lower angular momenta .",
    "as we will show , the amplitude of the angular momentum has little effect on the magnitude of ellipticity correlations , which is chiefly determined by correlations in the directions of the spins . for simplicity , we will assume each component of the inertia tensor to be gaussian distributed , so that the resulting distribution for the angular momentum given some shear tensor is also gaussian distributed , @xmath94 where @xmath95 is the correlation matrix . in the frame where the shear is diagonal ,",
    "the inertia tensor is uncorrelated with it and the correlation matrix has the form , @xmath96 .",
    "\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this has the same form in the peaks case studied by ct96a . the relation can be rewritten as @xmath97 where @xmath98 is the unit normalized traceless tidal tensor ( @xmath99 ) .",
    "note that the angular momentum is independent of the trace of the tidal tensor , so we can consider @xmath98 to be traceless without loss of generality .",
    "our final expression for the ellipticity correlations will be independent of the proportionality factor @xmath100 , so uncertainties in this factor will be irrelevant here .",
    "it has been argued that the approximations made by ct96a underestimate the correlations between the moment of inertia and the tidal field , and result in overestimating the angular momentum that is produced when compared to simulations .",
    "lee and pen ( lp00 ) suggest that the ct96 approximations may do well in predicting the direction of the angular momentum , but not its amplitude .",
    "they consider the most general correlation between the shear and inertia tensors , @xmath101 where @xmath102 the ct96a case of uncorrelated moment of inertia corresponds to @xmath103 . in the extreme @xmath104 case ,",

    "ironically , stronger correlations between the moment of inertia and the tidal field make the direction of the expected angular momentum more , not less , random .",

    "the typical 3-d separation of galaxies with a given angular separation is directly proportional to the survey depth @xmath232",

    "one issue is whether the correlation function or the tophat variance is plotted . for a simple @xmath266 correlation function ,",
    "the variance is nearly a factor of two larger than the correlation at the same scale .",
    "in addition , some authors plot the variance as a function of the tophat smoothing radius , while others instead plot it as a function of the diameter .",
    "finally , some authors quote the variance of each component of the complex shear field , while others quote the variance of the modulus of @xmath12 . here",
    "we plot the theoretical predictions for @xmath263 , the correlation of the modulus of the ellipticity .",
    "in contrast , when plotting the data , we have used the modulus variance for a given tophat radius . since the correlation function implied by the data is slightly lower than the variance , the relative contribution of the intrinsic correlations is somewhat larger than is naively implied by the figure .",
    "the relative importance of the intrinsic correlations increases dramatically as the depth of the survey is reduced .",
    "as the observed galaxies are closer to us , the lensing signal falls because there is less intervening matter to lens them , while the intrinsic signal grows since the galaxies are physically closer to each other for a given angular separation .",
    "jain & seljak ( 1997 ) show that the lensing signal scales as @xmath267 for a flat @xmath268 universe .",

    "the latter is beyond the stated range of validity , but should give an approximate idea of the lensing amplitude . for low @xmath275 , the intrinsic signal is significant and may dominate over the lensing contribution on most scales .",
    "clearly , large surveys like 2df and sdss offer exciting possibilities for measuring intrinsic shape correlations .",
    "there are other important distinctions between the lensing and the intrinsic correlation signals .",
    "for example , the lensing signal depends on the amplitude of the mass fluctuations , parameterized by @xmath276 .",
    "in contrast , the intrinsic correlations depend only on correlations of the direction of the shear field and are therefore largely independent of the amplitude of the fluctuations .    in addition",
    ", another difference arises in how the intrinsic signal depends on morphological type .",
    "weak lensing is in some sense democratic , as all galaxy types are distorted in the same way .",
    "this is not the case for intrinsic correlations however .",
    "we have shown that this signal depends on the distribution of axis ratios .",
    "spiral galaxies are characterized by @xmath277 , while ellipticals and spheroidal galaxies typically have @xmath278 .",
    "in addition , the alignment of the angular momentum with the shortest axis is likely to have more scatter in elliptical galaxies , resulting in an effective lowering of the value of @xmath2 .",
    "thus we expect the intrinsic correlation to be suppressed by more than a factor of two .",
    "this hypothesis can be checked observationally by using color criteria to separate the morphological types of galaxies , since ellipticals tend to be redder than spirals .",
    "in this paper , we have presented a calculation of intrinsic correlations in the observed ellipticities of galaxies resulting from angular momentum couplings .",
    "we have focused on the angular momentum which arises in linear theory and is associated with the local tidal field .",
    "the three dimensional spin correlations were projected using limber s equation to obtain the expected 2-d ellipticity correlations .",
    "these intrinsic correlations were shown to dominate over the weak lensing signal for shallower surveys .",
    "a number of assumptions were made in order to make the calculation tractable .",
    "foremost of these is the assumption that angular momentum plays the central role in aligning the observed galaxy shapes .",
    "other factors , such as the initial distribution of matter which fell in to form the galaxy , could also conceivably have contributed to the observed shapes . however , the angular momentum is special in that it is approximately constant during the later evolution of the galaxies .",
    "galaxies typically have had many dynamical times to virialize , and we expect most of the dependence on the initial matter distribution to be lost . this is particularly true for spirals , and holds for ellipticals which are slow rotators and have spin parameters of the order of 10% . although their rotational time scale ( @xmath279 gyr ) is much longer than their dynamical time ( @xmath280 myr ) , they have undergone enough rotations in a hubble time to erase any memory of the alignment of the principle axis ( dubinski 1992 ) .    at small separations , other factors , such as the recent history of galaxy collisions ,",
    "might also affect the ellipticity correlations .",
    "in addition , it is important to remember that we are probing only the light distributions , which reflect the matter distribution only at the very central parts of the galaxies .",
    "it is essential to understand precisely how the ellipticity correlations depend on the angular momenta .",
    "the dominant contribution to the correlations comes from alignments in the orientations of the galaxy ellipticities .",
    "the elongations of the galaxy light distributions are expected to be orthogonal to the direction of their projected angular momenta .",
    "the magnitude of the ellipticity may to some extent depend on the magnitude of @xmath35 ; for example , galaxies with larger angular momenta may appear more disk - like .",
    "even so , the form of this relation is largely irrelevant for understanding the ellipticity correlations .",
    "this is because the galaxy orientations are expected to be isotropic on average , so there must be correlations in the alignments for ellipticity correlations to occur .",
    "however , the magnitude of the ellipticity has a significant mean value .",
    "therefore , galaxy _ alignments _ already introduce ellipticity correlations even in the absence of correlations in the _ magnitude _ of the ellipticities .    to see this , consider the ellipticity correlation @xmath281   \\langle e^{2i(\\psi - \\psi')}\\rangle .",
    "\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the first relation follows from assuming that the magnitudes of the ellipticities are independent of their orientation correlations . recall that the distribution for ellipticities described in eqn .",
    "( [ eqn - p_e ] ) has a large mean value , @xmath282 .",
    "the variance of this distribution is significantly smaller than the square of the mean , @xmath283 , so that even perfect correlations between magnitude of the ellipticities would only result in a small modulation of the overall correlation .    since the ellipticity is proportional to @xmath284 , it is quadratic in the angular momentum components perpendicular to the line of sight ( eqn .",
    "( [ eqn - e_l ] ) . )",
    "the ellipticity correlation is therefore quartic in the angular momenta : @xmath285 this result should be contrasted with the _ ansatz _ of catelan , kamionkowski and blandford , which assumes the correlation to be quadratic in the angular momenta . ]",
    "the correlation strength @xmath286 also depends on the mean ellipticity , which in turn depends on the galaxy type .",
    "spiral galaxies are more flattened than elliptical galaxies , and thus will have a larger correlation .",
    "we have also assumed that the angular momentum is parallel to the shortest axis of the galaxies , which should be a good approximation for spirals , but may not be as good for elliptical galaxies and could suppress their correlation further .",
    "another major simplifying assumption we have made is that linear theory is sufficient to calculate these angular momentum correlations .",
    "we might hope that this is a good approximation , since most of the angular momentum is expected to be imparted before the object starts to collapse and enters the non - linear regime . while there are non - linear corrections , n - body simulations",
    "have shown the linear approximation to be surprisingly robust ( lee and pen 2000 , sugerman et al . 2000 ) .",
    "we have attempted to account for the effects of non - linear evolution by parameterizing the extent to which spin alignments are suppressed in comparison with linear predictions .",
    "this parameter was estimated from the n - body simulations of lee and pen ( 2000 ) and heavens et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , as well as by comparison to measurements of observed ellipticity correlations seen in the tully catalog ( pen et al .",
    "2000 ) .    the amplitude and shape of the ellipticity correlation function can be understood intuitively .",
    "recall that the ellipticity is a function of the shear tensor , which is the second derivative of the potential . by virtue of poisson s equation ,",
    "the trace of the shear tensor is the density .",
    "therefore we expect the correlation of the other components of the shear field will drop at the same rate as the density correlation function . since the ellipticities are quadratic in the shear field , correlations in them will fall as the density correlation function _ squared _ , @xmath287 .",
    "the order - of - magnitude of the amplitude of the correlation at zero - lag follows from simple symmetry arguments .",
    "the shear tensor has six degrees of freedom , but only five are relevant since angular momentum is independent of the trace .",
    "the typical magnitude of a fourth order moment of a unit tensor in a five dimensional space is 1/35 .",
    "therefore , these considerations suggest that the ellipticity variance will have a comparable amplitude .",
    "fuller consideration shows that , from equation([eqn : rough ] ) , @xmath288 our analytic calculations are valid for random points in a gaussian field , but galaxies are usually assumed to form at density peaks .",
    "we performed large realizations of gaussian fields and checked that our results are good approximations for such special sampling .",
    "we have compared the strength of the intrinsic correlation to that expected for weak lensing .",
    "the intrinsic signal grows as the depth of the survey decreases , because then galaxies close on the sky are on average also physically closer together , hence they are more correlated .",
    "the weak lensing signal , on the other hand , becomes weaker , since there is less matter between us and the lensed objects . for surveys typical of weak lensing , with a median redshift of @xmath0 ,",
    "the intrinsic signal is of order of 1 per cent of the weak lensing amplitude .",
    "however , for shallower surveys such as sdss or 2df , the intrinsic signal may dominate the lensing one , on small scales .",
    "therefore , sdss and 2df are ideally suited for studying intrinsic correlations in the orientations of galaxies .",
    "the intrinsic ellipticity depends on the square of the tidal field , whereas the lensing distortion is linear in the shear . as a direct consequence ,",
    "the distortion field is curl - free when induced by lensing , but not when intrinsic correlations are present as well ( crittenden et al . 2000 ) .",
    "the detection of such magnetic   modes will be an invaluable way of separating lensing from intrinsic correlations .",
    "finally , in this paper we have concentrated on intrinsic correlations of galaxies . applying a similar reasoning to clusters",
    ", one could hope to study the shear field on much larger scales .",
    "the alignment of clusters of galaxies is dominated by the intrinsic alignment of the major shear axis .",
    "their dynamical time is longer , and they form later , so we would expect the initial formation alignment to persist , implying ellipticities linearly proportional to the shear .",
    "the correlation should then drop as the correlation function @xmath289 instead of its square as is the case for spin alignments .",
