    "string theory has made some important progress in explaining the entropy of certain black holes by counting microscopic degrees of freedom , and thus scenarios with extra , compact dimensions must be taken seriously . in turn , some of the most interesting objects to be studied within string theory are those that possess event horizons , possibly extended in the compact extra dimensions .",
    "higher - dimensional theories of gravitation have recently attracted much attention , and static symmetrical homogeneous solutions have played an important role in revealing various aspects of gravitation peculiar to higher dimensional systems @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite .",
    "a noteworthy fact is that , compared to the severely constrained situation in four space - time dimensions @xcite",

    "a natural higher dimensional generalization of a black hole  also known as a schwarzschild - tangherlini black hole @xcite  has been assumed to be ( or believed to be ) stable , like its four - dimensional counterpart , and for this reason it has been conjectured that this black hole describes a final equilibrium state of evolution of an isolated system , or a certain class of unstable static solutions in higher dimensions .",

    "we can truncate to mass - less modes and read off the effective theory in the first two dimensions .",
    "we need not restrict ourselves to just two dimension either .",
    "in fact , higher dimensions have become very fashionable in the last twenty years , mainly due to the success of _ string theory _ as a possible quantum theory of gravity . at the quantum level ,",
    "boson string theory is only consistent in twenty - six ( ! ) dimensions , although this figure is reduced to ten when we introduce super symmetry . furthermore , there are five distinct string theories which can be viewed as different elements of an embracing new theory , m - theory  @xcite @xcite @xcite .",
    "m - theory lives in eleven dimensions and has eleven - dimensional super gravity as its low energy limit .",
    "traditionally we achieve the reduction down to the first two dimensions using tangherlini techniques .",
    "if we start with a @xmath35-dimensional theory , we compact on a small ( @xmath36)-dimensional manifold .",
    "different manifolds generally give different effective theories in the first two dimensions .",
    "the one thing all of these manifolds have in common is that they are very small , and compact .",
    "there is , however , an alternative to tangherlini compactification .",
    "this is the idea that we live on something called a _",
    "braneworld _ , where the extra dimensions can be infinite .",
    "in 1+@xmath37 space - time dimensions , an event horizon can be topologically a sphere @xmath38 , but when extended to @xmath39 extra dimensions , it could naturally have topologies either @xmath40 in which case it is a higher dimensional black hole , or @xmath41 being then a black @xmath39-brana or a black string in the @xmath39=1 case @xcite @xcite @xcite .",
    "the @xmath42 topology of the transverse dimensions can be compacted giving flat toroidal topological spaces @xmath43 .",
    "one of the first steps towards understanding these extended higher dimensional solutions is to investigate their classical stability against small perturbations .",
    "if a solution is unstable , then it most certainly will not be found in nature ( unless the instability is secular ) and the solution looses most of its power .",
    "of course the next question one must ask is what is the final stable result of such instability .",
    "now , in ( 1+@xmath37)-space - time dimensions , the schwarzschild - tangherlini geometry is stable against all kinds of perturbations , massive or mass - less @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , quite surprisingly , gregory and laflamme @xcite showed that this is not the case for higher dimensional black branes and black strings .",
    "these objects are unstable .",
    "the kind of black @xmath39-branes originally studied in @xcite were solutions of ten dimensional low energy string theory with metric of the form @xmath44 where @xmath45 stands for the ( 1+@xmath37)-dimensional schwarzschild- tangherlini line element , the @xmath46 are the coordinates of the compact dimensions , and @xmath47 runs from @xmath48 to @xmath39 .",
    "the total dimension of the space - time is 1+@xmath0 . in string or super gravity theories",
    "one takes 1+@xmath49 or 1+@xmath50 , but for generality one can leave it as a free natural parameter .",
    "the specific metric we shall be interested in is given by a time - independent symmetric metric that can be written in schwarzschild - tangherlini coordinates @xcite as ( [ 2 ] ) .",
    "after this general explanation of our background space - times , we give in the next section our formalism for gravitational perturbations , and the basic strategy of our analysis of the asymptote of a perturbation . at this stage , our arguments",
    "are not limited to the case of black holes , but are equally applicable to any case of maximally symmetric static homogeneous space - times with a non - vanishing cosmological constant .",
    "the study of symmetric perturbations of the schwarzschild - like solution is reduced to solving a single partial differential equation ( [ 3 ] ) .",
    "we attempt to solve this perturbation equation with initial data in a general static symmetrical homogeneous space - time .",
    "deriving the analytic formula for the solutions is important and useful for further study .",
    "the computation of gravitational radiation was done only numerically in a preceding study , e.g. ref @xcite .",
    "the first decision to be made is to choose our coordinates and ansatz for the analysis .",
    "we choose to work with one coordinate patch for the whole space - time . in our coordinates ( where the metric in the @xmath27 line is in the form @xmath51 ) the coordinate size of the horizon is an invariant and hence the coordinate patch does not change .",
    "consider a function @xmath52 of the variable @xmath27 .",
    "we denote by @xmath53 the laplace operator in the metric h.    consider a base @xmath54 of eigen - vectors of @xmath53 .",
    "let us consider a field with configuration space @xmath55 with @xmath0 even and global coordinates @xmath56(@xmath27 , @xmath57 , @xmath28 ) described by a singular euler - lagrange equation , @xmath58 @xmath59 the symmetry of the background guarantees that time and spatial variables will separate .",
    "in other words , if we rewrite equation ( [ 3 ] ) in @xmath27 and @xmath57 coordinates we find that the coefficients of the differential equation do not depend on time @xmath57 , and so the problem can be reduced to one dimension by applying a formal transform with respect to the time variable @xmath57 .",
    "however , the perturbation equation ( [ 3 ] ) is not invariant under simultaneous rescaling of time and space variables @xmath60 , @xmath61 .",
    "this lack of invariance reflects the presence of mass / length scale in the model .",
    "the solution is most conveniently analyzed in terms of the phase space coordinates @xmath62 , @xmath63 , @xmath64 .    in absence of explicit solutions of the perturbation equation ,",
    "the best we can do is to construct a solution by performing a _ quasi-_transformation from coordinate variables ( @xmath57 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 ) to phase space variables ( @xmath63 , @xmath62 , @xmath64 ) . on the other hand",
    ", such transformation must have the remarkable property that , in the _ special regimes _ with @xmath65 , the variables @xmath66 and @xmath67 form a basis of off - shell observables for the gravitational field _ even if _ the solution of the perturbation equation is not known .",

    "we propose a solution of the equation ( [ 3 ] ) of the form ( [ 4 ] ) so the derivatives of the original problem will enter as multiplicative terms .",
    "a vector @xmath74 satisfies @xmath75 the functions of bessel satisfy @xmath76 we substitute ( [ 4 ] ) into ( [ 3 ] ) .",

    "now , the usefulness of this approach with respect to previous ones is that we can derive the late - time behavior of fields in this background ( see ref .",

    "this property is concretely enforced by using a technique introduced by @xcite @xcite for the selection of space - times admitting asymptotically flat ( 1+@xmath0)-coordinates at spatial infinity .",
    "these facts entail that _ there is an effective evolution in the mathematical time _",
    "@xmath57 which parametrizes the leaves of the foliation associated with any 1+@xmath0 splitting .    the idea behind a new quantization scheme is to arrive directly to the physical hilbert space by quantizing only the observables of the system and treating the configuration variables as _ c",
    "- numbers _ ( like _ time _ in the time - dependent schrodinger equation ; the momenta become derivatives with respect to the configuration variables , like the energy is replaced by the time derivative ) . in gravity",
    "this scheme would make sense only if the configuration variables are coordinate - independent .",
    "there will be as many coupled schrodinger equations as configuration variables ( gauge invariant ) and the wave function will depend on as many _ times _ ( besides the standard one ) as configuration variables .",
    "every line in this parameter space will correspond to a configuration of the classical theory .",
    "now consider the evolution of a mass - less scalar field @xmath56 in the background described by ( [ 2 ] ) .",
    "the evolution is governed by the curved space klein - gordon equation @xmath103 the metric appearing in ( [ 14 ] ) should describe the geometry referring to both the black brana and the scalar field , but if we consider that the amplitude of @xmath56 is so small that its contribution to the energy content can be neglected , then the metric ( [ 2 ] ) should be a good approximation to @xmath104 in ( [ 14 ] ) .",
    "we shall thus work in this perturbation approach .",
    "it turns out that it is possible to simplify considerably equation ( [ 14 ] ) if we separate the horizon variables from the radial and the time variables , as is done in four dimensions @xcite @xcite . for higher dimensions we follow @xcite .",
    "the evolution of a minimally coupled scalar field @xmath56 is described by the mass - less klein - gordon equation ( [ 8 ] ) @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite , with @xmath105 where ( [ 8 ] ) is a partial differential operator that contains information about the initial shape of the wave packet at @xmath57=0 .",
    "the explicit form of the operator ( [ 8 ] ) is the simplest in this general setting .    in section [ seccion 2 ] ,",
    "the linear perturbation equation is derived and solved .    setting @xmath106",
    "we see that far from the horizon a mass - less field decays as @xmath1 in time , where @xmath2 is the harmonic mode of the sphere .",
    "this indicates that it behaves like @xmath107 for fixed @xmath27 .",
    "@xcite clarify that the field behaves like @xmath107 for even @xmath0 , and @xmath108 for odd @xmath0 .",
    "the situation for the tangherlini hyper sphere is clear . near the hyper sphere",
    "the fluctuations in the field behave in the same way as for flat hyper spheres .",
    "however , the field does vanish at the point at infinity , and close to it the field perturbations start to decrease .",
    "since this point lies far from the hyper sphere we might yet believe that gravity is localized at low enough energies . at finite temperature",
    "we could hide the point at infinity behind another black hole horizon .",
    "why a fluctuation about a black hole is regular at infinity ? this is an important problem in gravitation and has been studied for long time . although we do not have a definite answer to this question yet ,",
    "we have rather well established answers to the questions of stable ( unstable ) gaussian fluctuations about our black hole , which are summarized as the instabilities of gravitation .    in local particle physics problems in the present universe , the assumption of the asymptotic flatness will be a good approximation .",
    "however , the success of the inflationary universe model implies that the cosmological constant can not be neglected even locally in the early universe .",
    "further , recent developments in unifying theories suggest the possibility that the universe has dimensions higher than four on microscopic scales @xcite @xcite and that mini black holes might be produced in elementary particle processes in colliders as well as in high energy cosmic shower events . therefore , it is a quite important problem whether the regular character of a fluctuation about a black hole also holds in the non - vanishing cosmological constant case and/or in higher dimensions .",
    "here we explain the derivation of the master equation for the perturbation of a higher - dimensional schwarzschild black hole .",
    "our purpose is to study and present an analytic procedure to obtain solutions for the master equation of a small perturbation in a static symmetrical homogeneous space - time .",
    "we investigate the asymptote of a linear perturbation of higher dimensional space - times in the framework of a gauge - invariant formalism for gravitational perturbations of maximally symmetric static homogeneous space - times .",
    "this formalism was recently developed by ishibashi and kodama @xcite .    in the four - dimensional case ,",
    "the perturbation analysis of a black hole was first carried out by reggae and wheeler @xcite , and its stability was essentially confirmed by vishveshwara @xcite , followed by further detailed studies @xcite @xcite @xcite .",
    "the basic observation of those works is that unstable perturbations , whose growth in time is unbounded , are initially divergent at the event horizon ( provided that they are vanishing at large distances ) and therefore are physically unacceptable .",
    "a key step in the analysis is the reduction of the perturbation equations to a simple , tractable form . for this purpose , in the case of a four - dimensional black hole , the symmetry of the background space - time is utilized to classify the black hole perturbations into two types , axial ( odd ) modes and polar ( even ) modes , according to their behavior under the parity transformation on the two - sphere .",
    "to linear order , the perturbation equations for these two types of perturbations are independent , and therefore they reduce to a set of two schrodinger - type second - order ordinary differential equations , the reggae - wheeler equation for axial perturbations and the zerilli equation @xcite @xcite for polar perturbations .    in the higher dimensional case ,",
    "the role of the two - sphere is played by an ( @xmath161)-variety : according to their tensorial behavior on the ( @xmath161)-variety , perturbations are classified into three types , those of _ tensor , vector _ , and _",
    "modes , according to their tensorial behavior on the section of the background space - time .",
    "the first of these is a novel type of perturbation that exists only in the higher dimensional case , while the vector- and scalar - type modes correspond , respectively , to the axial and polar modes in the four - dimensional case .    in order to investigate the asymptote of a perturbation of higher dimensional space - times",
    ", one must study the asymptote of all the types of perturbations mentioned above .",
    "however , besides from ishibashi and kodama s work , all analysis made to this time has been carried out for only tensor perturbations @xcite , and the situation for vector and scalar perturbations has not yet been investigated : the asymptote of a perturbation of space - times in higher dimensions is not yet established .",
    "the treatment of scalar perturbations is the most difficult part of this analysis , because the linearized einstein equations for a scalar perturbation are much more complicated than those for a tensor perturbation and do not reduce to the form of a single second - order schrodinger - type in the higher dimensional case .",
    "recently , this reduction was carried out by ishibashi and kodama @xcite in the background of maximally symmetric black holes with a non - vanishing cosmological constant in an arbitrary number of space - time dimensions . from the result of that work , along with",
    "the previously obtained ordinary differential equations for tensor and vector perturbations @xcite , we have the full set of equations for the perturbations of higher dimensional maximally symmetric black holes in the form of a single self - ad - joint second - order ordinary differential equation  which we refer to as the _ master equation _  for each tensorial type of perturbation .",
    "these master equations of course , can be applied to the perturbation analysis of higher dimensional space - times .",
    "let us mention , furthermore , that these master equations have been derived in the framework of the gauge - invariant formalism for the perturbations , and for this reason , they do not involve the problem of the choice of gauge .    in the gauge invariant",
    "approach we can isolate the _ configuration variables _ , which carry the descriptive arbitrariness of the theory , from the _ observables _ , which are gauge invariant quantities providing a coordination of the reduced phase space of general relativity , and are subjected to hyperbolic ( and therefore _ causal _ in the customary sense ) evolution equations . in physics",
    "the _ hole argument _ is an aspect of the fact that also einstein s theory is interpreted as a gauge theory .",
    "recall that we consider as background the cartesian product of a two - dimensional orbit space @xmath14 and a horizon with @xmath161 compact dimensions , where 1+@xmath0 is the total space - time dimension and @xmath4 4 ( in order to avoid space - times with one or less compact spatial dimensions where the presence of a massive source is inconsistent with asymptotic flatness )",
    ".    in this background one expects two linearly independent master solutions .",
    "when the size of the radial variable is small ( the order of the size of the horizon ) one expects that the solutions closely resemble a ( 1+@xmath0)-dimensional static homogeneous space - time , while as one increases the distance one expects that at some point the perturbed solution will be flat .    as mentioned above , we have already obtained the master equation for each tensorial type of perturbation in the background space - time .",
    "our main focus in this section is therefore to prove that for each harmonic mode of the horizon there are two solutions that behave similarly at large . in the basic mode ,",
    "this behavior is @xmath3 . in particular ,",
    "an eigentensor of the lichnerowicz operator in a ( possibly higher dimensional ) black hole with zero eigenvalue decays at infinity in this way .",
    "these solutions occur in an integral form .",
    "in particular , there exist no unstable solutions to the master equation with physically acceptable initial data .",
    "ishibashi and kodama showed that there exist no well - behaved perturbations that are regular everywhere outside the event horizon .",
    "this is consistent with the uniqueness @xcite of a certain class of black holes in an asymptotically flat background .",
    "although our main interest is in the standard higher dimensional black holes , that is , asymptotically flat , spherically symmetric static vacuum solutions in higher dimensions , we also investigate the asymptote of a perturbation of other maximally symmetric static homogeneous space - times with a non - vanishing cosmological constant with respect to tensor- and vector - type perturbations .",
    "there is a reason to expect a good analytic control of static homogeneous space - time perturbations even if we do not have a complete analytic solution since we have a good approximation : the space - time is expected to resemble closely a ( 1+@xmath0)-dimensional static homogeneous black hole @xcite .",
    "the motivations for this research are first to obtain a theoretical description of a small perturbation which is important on its own right , and second to gain understanding of perturbation physics through combination with analytical work .",
    "the symbiosis with analytical work comes close to serve as a partial substitute of experiments ( which are sorely absent in this field ) : the analytics are essential for understanding static solutions close to perturbation where the approximation is expected to hold , and serves to formulate the aims and methods of the theory . as it turns out",
    ", the black holes obtained numerically show only a single multi - pole mode perturbation to their horizon @xcite @xcite , and that lends some hope that the analytic approximation would retain some validity for static homogeneous space - times as well .",
    "our objective is to describe the perturbation process ( to first order ) . writing down the equations of motion and separating the horizontal variables we find that a ric flatness condition in the horizontal directions yields a relation among the radial functions which is similar to a trace condition and allows us to simplify the fields .",
    "after substitution one can express the fields in terms of first and second derivatives .",
    "we are left with a second order tensor differential equation which reduces to a single second order ordinary differential equation in the radial direction , for each metric function ( and for each harmonic mode ) from which the whole metric may be recovered .",
    "this is the master equation , which after a change of variables simplifies further",
    ". it would be nice to have a deeper understanding why these reductions were to be expected .",
    "the master equation belongs to the class of _ fuchsias equations _ , where fuchsias means that the equation has only regular singular points on the complex sphere which includes infinity , and means that there are exactly three such points .",
    "as the _ hyper - geometric _ case of 3 regular singularities there is a general solution to the equation , and several methods are available .",
    "our case is a rather special case of the hyper - geometric equation . in this case , it turns out that the solutions can be written in terms of an _ integral transformation _ , and it would be nice to understand why that had to be the case .",
    "interestingly , we observe that in some of the relevant cases these integral transformations simplify further to _ explicit functions _ , and in particular , all relevant solutions are explicit functions at infinity ( solutions which are of even multi - pole number and are regular at the horizon ) .",
    "we started working out this problem before we were aware of the results of kodama and ishibashi @xcite @xcite @xcite . even though their papers were published more than three years ago , we continued independently after learning about them the formalism of gauge invariant perturbation theory , and the various changes of variables which are employed there .",
    "we were able to do so and actually found a somewhat similar master equation .",
    "yet the final reduction of our master equation to a hyper - geometric one was motivated by those papers .    in subsection [ subseccion 4.1 ]",
    "we briefly overview the present status of the investigations of this problem and discuss what kind of new information can be obtained by the linear perturbation theory . in subsection [ subseccion 4.2 ] we discuss properties of the eigentensors of the lichnerowicz laplacian for a space - time with applications to the asymptote of a linear perturbation of higher dimensional black holes . in subsection",
    "[ subseccion 4.3 ] we determine the linearized perturbations of the space - time . we have actually solved the perturbation equation with initial data of a static symmetrical homogeneous space - time in section [ seccion 2 ] .",
    "we apply this to perform the analysis of the asymptote of a perturbation for tensor , vector and scalar perturbations separately .      in this subsection",
    "we write the static einstein equations in a form that will be convenient for expansion around a background space - time .",
    "this type of expansion is known as _ gauge invariant perturbation _ and we follow here the usual conventions for this type of expansion .",
    "we denote in this subsection the ( 1+@xmath0)-dimensional space - time metric by @xmath109 . for the gauge invariant",

    "thus , we expect the attraction between the two sources to decrease rapidly to zero over the distance 1/@xmath119 .",
    "far from horizon @xmath306 0 , we can approximate the double integration by an integration on a line defined by the relation of energy and momentum of a free particle , that is to say , by an integration on @xmath272+@xmath273 , @xmath307 we calculate @xmath308 @xmath309 the integral gives @xmath310 the result is as we expected : the potential drops off exponentially over the distance scale 1/@xmath119 .",
    "obviously , @xmath311/@xmath312 0 : the two massive lumps sitting on the space - time can lower the energy by getting closer to each other .",
    "what we have derived is one of the most celebrated results in twentieth - century physics .",
    "yukawa proposed that the attraction between nucleons in the atomic nucleus is due to their coupling to a field like the @xmath56 field described here .",
    "the known range of the nuclear force enabled him to predict not only the existence of the particle associated with this field , now called the @xmath313 meson or the peon , but its mass as well .",
    "as the reader probably knows , the peon was eventually discovered with essentially the properties predicted by yukawa .    in deriving ( [ 29 ] )",
    "we direct our attention to the region far from the horizon . in this case , @xmath63 does not depend on @xmath27 , i.e. @xmath63 is reduced to the ordinary relation in the case of a flat space - time .",
    "this means that our result ( [ 29 ] ) is correct even if gravity is taken into account .",
