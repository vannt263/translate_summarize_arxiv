    "recently , the rosat all - sky survey ( rass ) has shown the existence of a widely dispersed population of x - ray active stars around nearby star - forming regions .",
    "this discovery has opened a lively debate on the nature of such objects .",
    "after the first proposal that these sources are pre - main sequence ( pms ) stars far from star - forming regions ( neuhuser et al .",
    "@xcite ) , some groups have argued that these are young stars close to the main sequence , aged up to @xmath1 ( e.g.   briceo et al .",
    "the study of the radio properties of the rass sources can cast new light on this debate .",
    "carkner et al .",
    "( , hereinafter ) performed a 8.4 ghz vla survey of 91 rass sources , in the vicinity of the taurus - auriga star - forming cloud cores .",
    "the optical counterparts of these sources had been classified as pms objects by neuhuser et al .",
    "( @xcite ) and wichmann et al .  ( @xcite ) .",
    "carkner et al .",
    "( ) get a @xmath2 detection rate of 32% , with a sensitivity limit of @xmath3 .",
    "they find no systematic difference between the sample of detected and undetected stars , as far as their spatial distribution is concerned . instead , when considering the radio fluxes , outline a significant difference of their sample from stellar groups like pleiades zams and active main sequence stars , and a similarity with weak - lined t tauri stars ( wtts ) previously detected at radio wavelengths . in their conclusions",
    "they support the identification of most rass sources around star - forming regions as genuine wtts rather than zams stars .    independently from , we have conducted a 8.4 ghz vla survey of 50 optical counterparts to 46 rass sources south of taurus - auriga . according to the strength of the @xmath4 doublet in their spectrum , 30 of these objects",
    "had been classified by magazz et al .",
    "( @xcite ) as genuine pms stars ( 100% of their pms stars ) , and the other 20 as possible pms stars ( 87% of their possible pms stars ) .",
    "twelve objects resulted in common with . in this paper",
    "we present our observations , together with a new classification for the objects in our sample , and discuss our results in the light of the debate on the nature of rass sources around star - forming regions .",
    "the observations were carried out by using the vla at 8.4 ghz with a total bandwidth of 100 mhz ( two contiguous 50 mhz bands ) , in three different runs , namely 1997 february 18 , february 20 and march 9 .",
    "for all the observing runs the array was in b configuration .",
    "the sky was reported covered and partially covered during the first two observational runs , i.e.  on february 18 and 20 , respectively , being clear during the last run .",
    "each on - source measurement consisted of a total of 14 - 15 minute integration time , preceded and followed by 2 - 3 minute observations of a nearby phase calibrator .",
    "the flux scale was fixed by daily observations of 3c48 , whose flux density was assumed to be 3.28 jy at 8.4 ghz . to avoid any spurious detection due to correlator offsets , for each pointing of our targets we shifted the phase centre by few arcsecs from the optical position .",
    "the data were edited , calibrated and mapped using the astronomical image processing system ( aips ) , i.e. the standard software of the nrao . to achieve the highest possible signal - to - noise ratio ,",
    "the mapping process was performed by using the natural weighting and the dirty map was cleaned down as close as possible to the theoretical noise .",
    "we estimated the noise level in the maps by analyzing a map area reasonably far away from the phase centre and checked its consistency with the expected theoretical noise .",
    "typical root - mean square ( rms ) of the noise level of the maps was of the order of 40 @xmath5 , as can be seen in table  [ sample ] , where the rms is reported for each observation .",
    "this corresponds to a sensitivity limit ( @xmath6 ) of @xmath0 .",
    "[ cols= \" < , > , > , < , > \" , ]     it is worthwhile , at this point , to look at radio emission of stars in the light of the classification by martn & magazz ( @xcite ) , shown in table  [ nature ] for 34 out of 91 stars .",
    "the radio flux is also shown , if detected at a level higher than @xmath6 .",
    "we see that the detection rate among pms stars ( wtts+ctts+ptts ) is 0.33 , similar to ( and even lower than ) the detection rate ( 0.44 ) in the group of remaining objects .",
    "moreover , radio fluxes in the two groups are quite similar . therefore , there seems to be no significant difference between radio emission in pms stars of taurus - auriga and other radio - emitting rass sources found in the same region .",
    "it is interesting to note that for wtts+ctts the detection rate is 0.45 , while for ptts this rate lowers to 0.14 .",
    "we have observed with vla 50 optical counterparts to 46 rass sources south of taurus - auriga .",
    "merging our observations with those of carkner et al .",
    "( ) we obtain the following results :    * although spatial distribution of radio sources may be uniform among rass sources inside the taurus - auriga molecular clouds , rass sources south of the clouds show scarce radio emission ; * there is evidence that our rass sources south of taurus - auriga are older than wtts and sources inside the clouds",
    ".    moreover , there seems to be no significant difference between radio emission in pms stars of taurus - auruga and other radio - emitting rass sources found in the same region .",
    "more radio observations of rass sources in star - forming regions , together with accurate classification of the optical counterparts will be essential in order to improve our understanding about the age , status , and origin of these objects .",
