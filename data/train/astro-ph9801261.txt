    "informations about the structure and evolution of elliptical galaxies ( es ) are commonly inferred from their morphology . roughly speaking ,",
    "this is justified by the fact that their internal two - body relaxation time is longer than the hubble time , so that the shape and internal dynamics of such systems probably reflect the conditions present immediately after the end of their formation process ( binney & tremaine 1987 , hereafter bt87 ) . however , a problem with this scenario is that es in clusters are not isolated objects , being subject to the effects of their environment .",
    "since these effects are acting on time scales shorter than the hubble time , it is of the utmost importance to be able to isolate them when using the present morphology to infer the conditions at the galaxy formation epoch . in particular , the cluster s tidal field ( tf ) acts continuously , and affects in general any galaxy in the cluster .",
    "thus , although the tf is not as strong as other interactions ( e.g. , galaxy - galaxy encounters ) , its effects can become important on the long term .    a first possibile effect of the tf is a modification of the shape of galaxies belonging to the cluster itself .",
    "ciotti & dutta ( 1994 , hereafter cd94 ) , using n - body numerical simulations , have shown that this is not the case , since es behave like rigid bodies in the cluster tf , at variance with disk galaxies ( valluri 1993 ) .",
    "such a conclusion seems to be confirmed by observational results , because no systematic differences are found between cluster and field es ( for a review see cd94 and references therein ) .",
    "a second possible effect on galaxies is their alignment with the cluster major axis , or with the radial direction in the case of a nearly spherical cluster . to this respect , hawley & peebles ( 1975 )",
    "reported _ `` a possible indication that the galaxies are preferentially aligned along the radius vector to the center of the [ coma ] cluster '' _ ; this result was confirmed by thompson ( 1976 ) .",
    "macgillivray & dodd ( 1979a , b ) observed an analogous alignment for es in the cluster centered on ngc439 ; in this case they found also a number of galaxies with their major axis _",
    "perpendicular _ to the radial direction of the cluster .",
    "the same authors , observing another spherical cluster , found a preferential alignment of es major axes with the cluster s radial direction .",
    "adams , strom & strom ( 1980 ) found a general trend for es to be aligned with the cluster s major axis in 7 very elongated clusters .",
    "they also reported _",
    "`` a small but significant number of es with their major axes perpendicular to the cluster s major axis''_. fong , stevenson & shanks ( 1990 ) found a moderately significant radial alignment of es , together with a less significant tendency of es to be oriented _ perpendicularly _ to this direction .",
    "the best evidence for alignment is for the brightest cluster ellipticals : trevese , cirimele & flin ( 1992 ) described a _",
    "`` strong alignment of the brightest galaxy major axis with the long axis of the parent cluster''_.    a third effect strictly related to the previous one is the possible _ resonant _ interaction between stellar orbits inside the galaxies and the cluster tf : if this is the case then we can speculate on the possibility of _ collisionless evaporation _ of stars from galaxies in clusters .",
    "the n - body simulations of prolate es in radial and circular orbits inside clusters show that an alignemnt , due to the cluster tf , can in fact be expected ( cd94 ) . in this paper",
    "we establish on more firm grounds the analytical discussion of the results of cd94 concerning the alignment .",
    "in particular , we discuss the equilibrium positions of a triaxial galaxy at the center of a triaxial cluster , and of a triaxial galaxy in circular orbit inside a spherical cluster , analyzing also the stability of these equilibrium configurations . for small displacements near the stable positions we obtain the oscillation frequencies , which are then compared with the internal orbital periods of the stars . throughout our discussion",
    "( following the n - body results of cd94 ) , a galaxy is described as a rigid body ( rb ) placed in an external gravitational field . by linearizing the external field ,",
    "the problem is reduced to that of the integration of the equations of motion for a rb in a tensorial force field , corresponding to the tf .",
    "although this problem is not integrable , one can still determine the equilibrium positions and their stability , along with the proper frequencies of the system .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we assume that the center of mass of the rb is at rest inside an unspecified external density distribution . in section 3 we study the more complicate case of a rb on a circular orbit inside an external , spherically symmetric potential . in both cases , we first determine the equilibrium configurations , and then we study their stability . for the stable positions",
    "the frequencies are determined analitically .",
    "finally , in section 4 we discuss the astronomical application of the previous analysis to the problem of the alignment of galaxies inside galaxy clusters , and of galaxies on circular orbits within spherical clusters .",
    "in addition , we compare the mean stellar orbital times inside galaxies with the frequencies induced by the tf , and we consider the possibility of a collisionless evaporation induced by resonances .",
    "we start discussing the simple case of an initially spinless rb with its center of mass at rest in an equilibrium point of an external potential .",
    "we introduce an inertial reference system @xmath0 , the time - independent density distribution @xmath1 producing the external field @xmath2 .    without loss of generality",
    "we can assume that the equilibrium point of the potential is at @xmath3 .",
    "we also assume that the characteristic dimensions of the rb are much smaller than the typical length scale over which the external potential changes .",
    "thus , near the equilibrium position @xmath4 where the brackets indicates the usual inner product in @xmath5 and @xmath6 is the tf tensor .",
    "note the minus sign in eqs .",

    ". the acceleration of the center of mass is given by @xmath11 it is evident that the last integral vanishes , i.e. , the motion of @xmath10 is not perturbed in the tf approximation ; it is only in higher order terms of the force expansion that the coupling appears . as a result of the initial conditions imposed , only rotational motions around @xmath3 are possible . as usual",
    "we indicate with @xmath12 the generic component of the rb inertia tensor @xmath13 , as seen from @xmath0 .      in order to find the equilibrium configurations of the rb in the tf we make use of the second cardinal equation of dynamics , and we search for the vanishing of the torque due to the tf .",

    "( [ eq : torque3 ] ) it is evident that the torque along a particular axis is affected only by the _ difference _ between the tf components along the two orthogonal directions .",
    "it is also obvious that if the external gravitational field is spherically symmetric around @xmath3 , or if the rb itself is spherically symmetric , then no net momentum acts on the rb , i.e. , all its positions are of equilibrium .",
    "we use eq .",
    "( [ eq : torque3 ] ) to find the equilibrium configurations of the rb .",

    "the rb is at rest , and its inertia tensor is diagonal , with the three principal components @xmath24 .",
    "we consider only a non - degenerate situation ( i.e. , @xmath25 and @xmath26 ) . if @xmath27 acts on the vectors @xmath28 of @xmath22 as @xmath29 , then the following relation holds :    @xmath30    from eq .",
    "( [ eq : torque3 ] ) , assuming @xmath31 , we conclude that the rb is in equilibrium if and only if @xmath32 for @xmath33 , i.e. , if and only if @xmath13 is diagonal .",
    "this is true if and only if @xmath0 and @xmath22 are coincident ( apart from a renaming of the rb principal axes of inertia ) .",

    "as proved in  2.1 , apart from a renaming of the inertia axes , the equilibrium positions are given by @xmath49 .",
    "the linearized kinetic and potential energy near this point are simply @xmath50 note how both the quadratic forms are already diagonal : this means that the chosen coordinates ( angles ) are also the normal coordinates for the problem .",
    "the differential equations of the motion are readily obtained : @xmath51 and their solution is trivial . note that in the determination of stability positions and relative frequencies , only the _ ratios _ of the inertia moments matter .",

    "4 the physical meaning of points 1 and 2 above will be discussed for our astronomical application , and an explicit calculation of some typical frequencies will be derived for galaxy and clusters models matching observational constraints .",
    "in this section we discuss the case of a triaxial rb on a circular orbit inside a spherically symmetric potential .",
    "note that the assumption that the rb s orbit remains circular is justified by the fact that the external field , truncated at the tf approximation , does not affect the motion of @xmath10 ( see  2 ) .    without loss of generality",

    "this could be an explanation of the result numerically found by cd94 that n - body galaxies behaves in the cluster tf as rigid bodies .    finally , we have pointed out the possible effect of resonances between stellar orbits in the external parts of the galaxies , and the oscillations frequencies induced on the galaxies by the tidal field of the parent cluster .",
    "we found that the induced frequencies on galaxies can be of the order of the stellar orbital times in their outer halos , and this fact suggests the existence of a possible resonant collisionless evaporation of stars from galaxies in clusters .",
