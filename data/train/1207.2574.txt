    "for several experimental setups , a description that completely specifies the nature of each device is unsatisfactory .",
    "for example , in a realistic scenario the assumption that the provider of the devices is fully reliable is often overoptimistic : imperfections unavoidably affect the implementation , thus turning it away from its ideal description .",
    "a device independent description of an experimental setup does not make any assumption on the involved devices , which are regarded as `` black boxes '' , while only the knowledge of the correlations between preparations , measurements and outcomes is considered . in this scenario ,",
    "a natural question is whether it is possible to derive some properties of the non - characterized devices instead of assuming them , building only upon the knowledge of these correlations . in general",
    "one could be interested in bounding the dimension of the systems prepared by a non - characterized device ; one could also ask whether a source is intrinsically quantum or can be described classically .",
    "the framework of device independent dimension witnesses ( didws ) provides an effective answer to these questions , suitable for experimental implementation and for application in different contexts , such as quantum key distribution ( qkd ) or quantum random access codes ( qracs ) .",
    "didws were first introduced in @xcite in the context of non - local correlations for multi - partite systems .",
    "subsequently , the problem of didws was related to that of qracs in @xcite , and in @xcite it was reformulated from a dynamical viewpoint allowing one to obtain lower bounds on the dimensionality of the system from the evolution of expectation values . a general formalism for tackling the problem of didws in a prepare and measure scenario",
    "was recently developed in @xcite .",
    "the derived formalism allows one to establish lower bounds on the classical and quantum dimension necessary to reproduce the observed correlations .",
    "shortly after , the photon experimental implementations followed , making use of polarization and orbital angular momentum degrees of freedom  @xcite or polarization and spatial modes  @xcite to generate ensembles of classical and quantum states , and certifying their dimensionality as well as their quantum nature .",
    "didws also allow reformulating several applications in a device - independent framework .",
    "for example , dimension witnesses can be used to share a secret key between two honest parties . in  @xcite ,",
    "the authors present a qkd protocol whose security against individual attacks in a semi - device independent scenario is based on didws .",
    "the scenario is called semi - device independent because no assumption is made on the devices used by the honest parties , except that they prepare and measure systems of a given dimension .",
    "another application is given by qracs , that make it possible to encode a sequence of qubits in a shorter one in such a way that the receiver of the message can guess any of the original qubits with maximum probability of success .",
    "in @xcite qracs were considered in the semi - device independent scenario , with a view to their application in randomness expansion protocols .    clearly",
    "any experimental implementation of didws is unavoidably affected by losses - that can be modeled as a constraint on the measurements - and can reduce the value of the dimension witness , thus making it impossible to witness the dimension of a system .",
    "based on these considerations , it is relevant to understand whether it is possible to perform reliable dimension witnessing in realistic scenarios and , in particular , with non - optimal detection efficiency .",
    "we refer to this problem as the _ robustness of device independent dimension witnesses_. despite its relevance for experimental implementations and practical applications , this problem has not been addressed in previous literature .",
    "the aim of this work is to fill this gap .",
    "we consider the case where shared randomness between preparations and measurements is allowed .",
    "our main result is to provide the threshold in the detection efficiency that can be tolerated in dimension witnessing , in the case where one is interested in the dimension of the system as well as in the case where one s concern is to discriminate between its quantum or classical nature .",
    "the paper is structured as follows . in section [",
    "sect : didw ] we introduce the sets of quantum and classical correlations and the concept of dimension witness as a tool to discriminate whether a given correlation matrix belongs to these sets .",
    "section [ sect : sets ] discusses some properties of the sets of classical and quantum correlations . in section [",
    "sect : robustness ] we provide a threshold in the detection efficiency that is allowed in witnessing the dimensionality of a system or in discriminating between its classical or quantum nature , as a function of the dimension of the system .",
    "we summarize our results and discuss some further developments - such as dimension witnessing in the absence of correlations between preparations and measurements or entangled assisted dimension witnessing - in section [ sect : conclusion ] .",

    "the non convexity of the relevant sets allows the exploitation of non - linear witnesses - as opposed to what we did in the present work .",

    "the dimension of the hilbert space @xmath0 is @xmath200 , but a pair of maximally entangled qubits is shared between the parties . in this case , the results of  @xcite imply that a classical system of dimension @xmath201 ( quart ) can be sent from alice to bob by sending a qubit ( corresponding to half of the entangled pair ) .",
    "consider the general scenario where now the two parties are allowed to share entangled particles .",
    "the super - dense coding protocol automatically ensures that by sending a qubit alice and bob can always achieve the same value of any didw as attained by a classical quart .",
    "remarkably , the super - dense coding protocol turns out not to be optimal , as we identified more complex protocols beating it .",
    "in particular , we found a @xmath202 situation for which , upon performing unitary operations on her part of the entangled pair and subsequently sending it to bob , alice can achieve correlations that can not be reproduced upon sending a quart .",
    "this thus proves the existence of communication contexts in which sending half of a maximally entangled pair is a more powerful resource than a classical quart .",
    "this observation is analogous to that done in @xcite , where it was shown that entangled assisted qracs ( where an entangled pair of qubits is shared between the parties ) outperform the best of known qracs . for these reasons",
    "we believe that the problem of entangled assisted didws deserves further investigation .",
    "we are grateful to nicolas brunner , stefano facchini , and marcin pawowski for very useful discussions and suggestions .",

    "given a linear dimension witness @xmath145 the following algorithm converges to a local maximum of @xmath95 .",

    "normalize @xmath209 with @xmath210 .",
    "as for all steepest - ascent algorithm , there is no protection against the possibility of convergence toward a local , rather than a global , maximum .",
    "hence one should run the algorithm for different initial ensembles in order to get some confidence that the observed maximum is the global maximum ( although this can never be guaranteed with certainty ) .",
    "any initial set of states and any initial set of povms can be used as a starting point , except for a subset corresponding to minima of @xmath95 .",
    "these minima are unstable fix - points of the iteration , so even small perturbations let the iteration converge to some maxima .",
    "the parameter @xmath211 controls the length of each iterative step , so for @xmath211 too large , an overshooting can occur .",
    "this can be kept under control by evaluating @xmath95 at the end of each step : if it decreases instead of increasing , we are warned that we have taken @xmath211 too large .    referring to fig .",
    "[ fig : setup ] , the simplest non - trivial scenario one can consider is the one with @xmath105 preparations and @xmath212 povms each with @xmath213 outcomes , one of which corresponding to no - click event . in this case one has several tight classical didws . applying algorithm [ thm : algo1 ]",
    "we verified that among them the most robust to loss is given by eq . with coefficients given by eq . .",
    "the following lemma proves that the povms maximizing @xmath161 for any dimension @xmath10 are such that one of their elements is a projector on a pure state , thus generalizing a result from @xcite .      for any fixed set @xmath218 of pure states",

    "the optimum of @xmath161 is achieved when @xmath216 is the sum of the eigenvectors of @xmath228 corresponding to positive eigenvalues .    upon denoting with @xmath229 the eigenvalues of @xmath230 , the weyl inequality ( see for example @xcite ) @xmath231 holds for any @xmath232 . since @xmath233 and @xmath234 for any @xmath62 and for any @xmath235",
    ", the thesis follows immediately .",
    "the same remarks made about algorithm [ thm : algo1 ] hold true for algorithm [ thm : algo2 ] .",
    "nevertheless , we verified that in practical applications algorithm [ thm : algo2 ] always seems to converge to a global , not a local maximum .",
    "this can be explained considering that without loss of generality it optimizes over a smaller set of povms when compared to algorithm [ thm : algo1 ] .",
    "moreover , we noticed that the optimal sets of states and povms are real , namely there exists a basis with respect to which states and povm elements have all real matrix entries .",
