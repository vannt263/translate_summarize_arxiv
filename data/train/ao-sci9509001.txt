    "although it is well understood that two - dimensional axisymmetric models are important for studying the hadley circulation ( schneider , 1977 ; held and hou , 1980 ) , this kind of model has not been thought useful for large - scale motions in the extratropics , since non - axisymmetric baroclinic waves are essential in the real atmosphere . until the beginning of this century",
    ", however , meridional cellar structure in an axisymmetric situation had been a major problem of the general circulation of the atmosphere ( e.g. , thomson , 1892 ; lorenz , 1967 ) : not only the hadley circulation but also the cellar structure in the extratropics .",
    "views of the general circulation has changed from that given by hadley(1735 ) in which only a direct cell exists in each hemisphere ( upward motion in the equatorial side and downward motion in the polar side ) to that given by ferrel(1856 ) and thomson(1892 ) in which a direct cell co - exists with an indirect cell ( downward motion in the equatorial side and upward motion in the polar side ) .",
    "although various cellar structures had been presented , the problem of the cell shapes was almost settled by the requirement of the angular momentum balance ; the direct cell must override the indirect cell in the axisymmetric circulations , and the cell boundary is inclined to the pole as in the upper layers .",
    "this cellar structure is presented by bjerknes(1937 ) and eliassen(1951 ) .",
    "the numerical experiments by schneider(1977 ) and held and hou(1980 ) have qualitatively reproduced this structure .",
    "satoh(1994a ) has calculated the axisymmetric circulations of a moist atmosphere by using a two - dimensional model in the global domain ( hereafter , referred to as s94 ) .",
    "the surface temperature is externally fixed and the free atmosphere is cooled by the gray radiation model .",
    "large - scale convective motions are naturally resolved in the model and the stratification is stabilized , even if no cumulus parameterization except for the large - scale condensation is introduced .",
    "the results show that , in the low - latitudes , there exists a large - scale direct cell which corresponds to the hadley cell .",
    "the cell widths are broader as in the upper layers , so that the cell shape is very similar to that presented by bjerknes(1937 ) and eliassen(1951 ) . in the extratropics , however , unsteady multiple cells exist instead of an indirect cell and they propagate toward the equator ( s94 , fig .",
    "3 ; reproduced as fig .",
    "2(c ) of the present paper ) .",
    "hereafter , the multiple cells calculated in s94 in the mid- and high - latitudes are referred as the symmetric cells .",
    "the circulations in the mid - latitudes of s94 are different from those obtained by schneider(1977 ) and held and hou(1980 ) .",
    "the difference may be ascribed to the maintenance mechanism of the stratification of the models . in s94",
    ", the stratification tends to be unstable because of the radiative cooling in the troposphere and the heating from the surface .",
    "convective motions must be generated in order to suppress the unstable stratification .",
    "in contrast to this , schneider(1977 ) and held and hou(1980 ) used a stable temperature profile as a reference state of the newtonian cooling , so that no local convection exist in their models .    in the extratropics of the real atmosphere ,",
    "non - axisymmetric motions such as baroclinic waves are dominant , and the symmetric cells calculated in s94 is hardly observed . as will be shown in sections 2 and 3 , however",
    ", the symmetric cells generally exist in all experiments of the two - dimensional model , and play an important role in the transport of the angular momentum .",
    "it is required that dynamical mechanisms of the symmetric cells should be clarified , in particular , for their propagation and horizontal scales , to gain a complete view of the axisymmetric systems .",
    "the symmetric cells are also valuable , since they will provide a further insight into the hadley circulation .",
    "it will be shown that the hadley cell can be regarded as one of the symmetric cells .    in this paper ,",
    "the circulations in the mid - latitudes of the axisymmetric atmospheres are focused . a two - dimensional model in horizontal - vertical section",
    "is utilized to investigate the dynamics of the symmetric cells .",
    "two kinds of coordinates are used ; the model in the spherical coordinate is referred as the global model , and the model in the cartesian coordinate is referred as the @xmath3plane model .",
    "formulation of the model is described in the appendix . in section 2 ,",
    "the angular momentum budget of the standard experiment of s94 is analyzed , and additional results for the global model are shown . in sections 3 and 4 ,",
    "the symmetric cells are discussed with the results for the @xmath3plane model .",
    "section 5 summarizes the relationship between the symmetric cells and the hadley circulations and discuss the generalization of these findings .",
    "the angular momentum budget plays a key role in meridional circulations of the axisymmetric atmosphere .",
    "when steady direct and indirect cells co - exist as depicted by bjerknes(1937 ) and eliassen(1951 ) , the cell shapes are determined by the requirements of the angular momentum balance in the following manner .",
    "the direct cell transports the angular momentum upward , and the indirect cell transports it downward , so that there must be an exchange of the angular momentum between both cells . in the axisymmetric system , the viscous stress is the only process of the momentum exchange between steady cells .",
    "if coefficients of the viscosity are isotropic , horizontal transport caused by the viscous stress is much smaller than vertical transport by the viscous stress , since the aspect ratio of the atmosphere is very small .",
    "thus , the angular momentum is vertically transported by the viscous stress which is associated with the vertical shear of the zonal winds . in order for the zonal shear to be maintained , the direct cell must override the indirect cell , and the cell boundary",
    "is inclined to the pole as in the upper layers .    in the beginning , we examine the angular momentum budget of the results for the global model of s94 , and compare it with the above consideration . in the standard experiment of s94 , the surface temperature is given by @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the latitude , @xmath6 k , and @xmath7 k. the diffusion coefficient of momentum flux is 5 m@xmath8/s , and that of heat and moisture fluxes is 1 m@xmath8/s .    in the standard experiment , the hadley cell exists in the low - latitudes , and a multiple cellar structure which propagates equatorward exists in the mid- and high - latitudes . in order to isolate transports by the symmetric cells in the mid- and high - latitudes",
    ", we divide convergence of the angular momentum into steady and unsteady parts : @xmath9 @xmath10 is the absolute angular momentum , @xmath11 is the meridional velocity , and @xmath12 is the divergence in the meridional plane .",

    "( [ eq : lcnv ] ) . the total component ( a ) shows a large divergence ( gain of the angular momentum in the atmosphere ) in the lower boundary layers of the hadley cell . at the polar boundary of the hadley cell ( the latitudes 10@xmath1520@xmath15 ) , divergent and convergent regions are vertically adjacent to each other .",
    "both regions are inclined to higher latitudes in the upper layers .",
    "the steady component ( b ) is uniformly divergent in the lower layers in every latitude , while it is convergent in the upper layers in the extratropics .",
    "conversely , the unsteady component ( c ) is divergent in the upper layers , while it is convergent in the lower layers .",
    "1 indicates that it is the symmetric cells that transport the angular momentum downward in the mid - latitudes .",
    "the angular momentum is supplied to the atmosphere in the surface easterly regions in the low - latitudes , and is transported upward and poleward by the hadley cell .",
    "it is transferred downward by the viscous stress at the polar boundary of the hadley cell , where a large vertical shear of the westerlies exists . in the mid- and high - latitudes , westerly shear",
    "is maintained by the poleward transport of the angular momentum by a weak steady direct cell , which has a hemispheric scale as shown by fig .",
    "on the other hand , the unsteady symmetric cells transport the angular momentum downward in these regions .",
    "although both easterlies and westerlies exist at the surface boundary of the symmetric cells , the westerly component is a little stronger , hence the angular momentum is transferred from the atmosphere to the ground due to the net effect of the surface friction .",
    "the role of the hadley cell in the angular momentum budget is the same as that depicted by bjerknes(1937 ) and eliassen(1951 ) . in the extratropics , however , the symmetric cells play a role of the downward transport of the angular momentum instead of a steady indirect cell .",

    "2 shows the time sequences of the latitudinal distribution of the precipitation for @xmath18 0k , 20k , 40k ( the standard experiment ) , and 80k .",
    "the temperature at the equator is @xmath19 300k for every case . in the standard experiment",
    ", the symmetric cells are propagating equatorward at a speed of approximately 1 m / s , and have a period of about 20 days .",
    "the speed of the propagation becomes faster as @xmath0 becomes larger . in the case of @xmath1 ,",
    "the precipitation patterns are periodic and they do not change their positions except for the equatorial latitudes .",
    "these results imply that the gradient of the surface temperature and the coriolis parameter affect the propagation of the symmetric cells .",
    "it should be noted that , in the case of @xmath20 0 ( fig .",
    "2(a ) ) , precipitation is not concentrated at the equator but randomly distributed in the low - latitudes .",
    "that is , the hadley cell no longer exists in this model , when the surface temperature gradients are sufficiently small near the equator .",
    "3 displays the dependencies of the precipitation on the viscosity coefficients of the free atmosphere ( @xmath17 ) and of the surface layer ( @xmath21 ): @xmath22 1 and 25 m@xmath8/s . in the case of @xmath22 25 m@xmath8/s , the symmetric cells around the latitudes 30@xmath15",
    "do not propagate .",
    "this result indicates the propagation of the symmetric cells is related with the angular momentum transport , since the viscous diffusion controls the vertical momentum transport .",
    "in this section , an `` @xmath3-plane model '' is used to investigate the symmetric cells in the mid - latitudes ; the model is two - dimensional ( horizontal - vertical ) with a uniform rotation rate in the cartesian coordinate . as summarized in the appendix ,",
    "the formulation of the model , i.e. the basic equations , the discretization , and the physical processes , is almost the same as that of the global model . only the metrics and the domain are different .",
    "the model is based on the primitive equations with a @xmath23 coordinate ( @xmath24 ; @xmath25 the pressure and @xmath26 the surface pressure ) .",
    "the lateral widths of the domain is @xmath27 m. here , the lateral coordinate is denoted by @xmath28 , which corresponds to the latitude of the global model ; larger @xmath28 indicates the northward direction .",
    "the lateral boundaries are assumed to be walls with slip and insulating conditions .",
    "the number of grid points is 100 in the horizontal direction and 50 in the vertical direction .",
    "the grid intervals are @xmath29 0.02 and @xmath30 0.02 , respectively .",
    "the coriolis parameter is prescribed as @xmath31 rad / s , which is the value at the latitude 30@xmath15 ( @xmath32 is the rotation rate of the earth ) .    as for the radiation process , a uniform cooling rate 2k / day is given below the level @xmath33 to the ground just for simplicity .",
    "the level @xmath33 can be regarded as the tropopause .",
    "the surface temperature is externally fixed , and the ground surface is assumed to be wet everywhere .",
    "moisture is supplied from the surface to the atmosphere by the bulk formula . in the same way as section 3a of s94 , only the `` large - scale condensation '' is employed as the moist process in the atmosphere , and any other cumulus parameterization is used ; phase change of moisture is explicitly calculated at each of the grid point , and the liquid part of the air is removed as precipitation when it is saturated .",
    "diffusion coefficients for the momentum , heat , and moisture are set to be constant as in s94 .",
    "the surface temperature is linearly prescribed as @xmath34 the temperature difference in the domain is denoted by @xmath16 .",
    "4 shows time variations ( 0  100 days ) of precipitation for ( a ) @xmath35 300 k , ( b ) @xmath19 305 k , @xmath36 295 k , ( c ) @xmath19 310 k , @xmath36 290 k , and ( d ) @xmath19 320 k , @xmath36 280 k. in every case , there exists a systematic cellar structure similar to that in the mid - latitudes of the global model .",
    "the precipitation occurs in the upward motion regions of the symmetric cells .",
    "when there is no temperature difference ( @xmath20 0 ) , the precipitation patterns have a periodicity of about 20 days .",
    "when there is a temperature difference ( @xmath37 0 ) , the precipitation patterns propagate to the warmer regions ( smaller @xmath28 ) . as",
    "the temperature difference becomes larger , the velocity of the propagation becomes larger . although the lateral intervals between the precipitating regions are not sensitive to @xmath0 , they are larger in the warmer regions .",
    "the periodicity or the propagation of the precipitation is associated with the circulations of the symmetric cells .",
    "structure and mechanism of the symmetric cells will be examined in the following subsections .",
    "the symmetric cells in the case @xmath20 0 ( fig .",
    "4(a ) ) are examined here .",
    "5 shows the time variation of the surface zonal winds for the days 0  100 .",
    "westerlies exist in the southern side of the precipitating regions , whereas easterlies exist in the northern side .",
    "their phases correspond to those of the precipitation .",
    "6(a ) and ( b ) show the zonal winds in the meridional plane ( @xmath28-@xmath23 ) for the averages of the days 4655 and the days 5665 , respectively .",
    "7(a ) and ( b ) are the temperature perturbation from the @xmath28-average for the same periods .",
    "the phase of the precipitation changes at about the day 55 .",
    "for instance , precipitation occurs at @xmath38 0.52 during the days 4655 , and it jumps to @xmath38 0.41 and 0.62 at the day 55 . at the precipitating regions , the circulations of the lower layers are cyclonic with convergence of lateral winds , while those of the upper layers are anticyclonic with divergence of lateral winds .",
    "the temperatures in the upward motion regions are warmer than those in the downward motion regions irrespective of height .",
    "the temperatures are almost in thermal wind balance with the zonal winds .",
    "the periodicity of the symmetric cells can be explained as follows .",
    "associated with the convective circulation , cyclonic winds develop in the lower layers , and anticyclonic winds develop in the upper layers . in the northern part of a precipitating region ( upward motion region ) ,",
    "easterlies develop in the lower layers while westerlies develop in the upper layers . as the convective motion continues ,",
    "the westerlies in the upper layers gradually come down . by the time they reach the ground , the lateral gradient of pressure changes its sign due to the geostrophic adjustment to the westerlies .",
    "the inverted pressure gradient force causes lateral winds of the opposite direction near the ground .",
    "finally , the circulations are reversed ; the downward motions are generated in the previously upward motion region , and upward motions are generated in the previously downward motion region .",
    "the period is given by the overturning time @xmath2 , which is defined by @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the height of the troposphere and @xmath41 is the speed of the downward motion .",
    "( this is also estimated by eq .",
    "( 29 ) of s94 . )",
    "the lateral scale of the symmetric cells @xmath42 can be estimated in the following manner .",
    "note that there are two cells between adjacent precipitating regions , so that the lateral interval of the precipitating regions is expressed by @xmath43 . if one denotes the lateral temperature difference in the middle of the troposphere by @xmath44 , the thermal wind balance is expressed by @xmath45 where @xmath46 is",
    "the maximum value of the zonal wind at the tropopause @xmath40 , and @xmath47 is the mean temperature . by estimating @xmath48 from the angular momentum conservation at the height @xmath40 , one obtains @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the acceleration of gravity .",
    "the value of @xmath44 should be known in order to obtain @xmath42 .",
    "as shown below , only an upper bound of @xmath44 can be given from the consideration of the stratification .",
    "however , it will be shown that @xmath44 is actually close to the upper bound .",
    "if one supposes a thermal wind balance of a large @xmath42 , @xmath44 also becomes larger as @xmath42 is increased . in this case , the temperature profile in the upward motion regions does not change , since it is prescribed by a moist adiabat .",
    "thus , the temperature in the downward motion regions must be cooler in this balance .",
    "since the surface temperature is uniform , the stratification of the downward motion regions becomes unstable .",
    "this implies that another convective motion will occur from these regions .",
    "although the downward motion regions are , in general , conditionally unstable , they would be absolutely unstable in the balance of a sufficiently large @xmath42 . therefore , the upper bound of @xmath44 is given by that in the case when temperature lapse rate in the downward motion regions is equal to the dry adiabat .",
    "8 displays a time variation of lapse rate ( @xmath51 ) at @xmath52 which is just above the mixed layers .",
    "the values above 8 k / km are shown by hatching .",
    "comparison with fig .",
    "4(a ) shows that the lapse rate is about 9k / km at the downward motion regions when the circulation changes its direction .",
    "this lapse rate is close to the dry adiabat @xmath53 9.8k / km ( @xmath54 is specific heat for constant pressure ) . from this",
    ", one may conclude that the temperature difference @xmath44 is given by this upper bound .",
    "the temperature difference is given by @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the lapse rate of the moist adiabat .",
    "one obtains , therefore , by using eq .",

    "the lateral scale is given by the rossby deformation radius @xmath59 .",
    "it is estimated as @xmath60 for the values in the case of fig .",
    "4(a ) : @xmath61 [ sec@xmath62 , @xmath63 [ m ] and @xmath64 [ sec@xmath65 . fig .",
    "4(a ) shows that the lateral interval of the precipitating regions is approximately 0.18 @xmath66 ; that is , @xmath67 , which is very close to the above estimation .",
    "one might suspect that the result that the scale of the convective cell is given by the rossby deformation radius is only a trace of linear theories ( e.g. , gill , 1982 ; emanuel , 1983 ; bretherton , 1987 ) .",
    "however , the present case is considered in the nonlinear statistically equilibrium states , to which the linear theories are not directly applied . the nonlinear advection of the angular momentum and the asymmetry between the lower and the upper boundary conditions for the momentum ( the angular momentum is exchangeable at the lower surface ,",
    "but it is not at the upper boundary ) are key points of the above derivation .",
    "if , instead , one applies the slip conditions in which momentum exchange is forbidden both at the lower and the upper boundaries , the angular momentum will be horizontally uniform in the whole layer around the cumulus region in the nonlinear equilibrium states . in this case ,",
    "the vertical component of the absolute vorticity becomes zero , so that the circulation field associated with cumulus heating will not feel the basic rotation @xmath3 and the scale of the convective cell will be larger than the rossby deformation radius . in the present study , however , the circulation field can feel the basic rotation through the angular momentum exchange at the lower surface , and , as a result , the rossby deformation radius becomes a natural scale for the convective cell .      as an example for @xmath37 0 , the wind fields in the case of @xmath19 320 k and @xmath36",
    "300 k are examined .",
    "9 shows a time variation ( the days 0  100 ) of the precipitation .",
    "the wind fields are averaged for 50 days along the propagating precipitating region a @xmath68 b of fig . 9 ( a : @xmath38 0.68 at the day 51 , b : @xmath38 0.45 at the day 100 ) .",

    "10 . in the lower layers ,",
    "the northern side of the precipitating region ( @xmath38 0.5 ) is westerly , while the southern side is easterly . in the upper layers ,",
    "contrary to this , the northern side of @xmath38 0.5 is easterly , while the southern side is westerly .",
    "the region of the upper westerlies is connected with that of the surface westerlies ( @xmath38 0.6  0.66 ) , which are associated with the inflow to the next precipitating region ( @xmath38 0.66 ) . as shown by the stream functions , each precipitating region has both northern and southern cells . the northern cell is broader than the southern cell especially in the upper layers , and the northern cell spreads over the next southern cell which is associated with the next precipitating region ( @xmath38 0.66 ) .",
    "that is , the direct cell ( positive sign of the stream functions ) is in contact with the indirect cell ( negative sign ) by an inclined boundary ( the contour of zero ) .",
    "the angular momentum is transported upward by the direct cell , and is transported downward by the indirect cell , hence the angular momentum should be transferred from the direct cell to the indirect cell .",
    "the inclination of the cell boundary makes possible the vertical transfer between the cells by the viscosity .",
    "this cellar structure is similar to the relation between the hadley cell and the ferrel cell depicted by eliassen(1951 ) , and is essential for the angular momentums transport between the two cells .",
    "11 shows the temperature and the normalized angular momentum @xmath69 at the day 100 .",
    "the upper angular momentum and temperature is uniform in the regions @xmath38 0.22  0.4 and @xmath38 0.41  0.64 , for example .",
    "these uniform regions are associated with the precipitation at @xmath38 0.24 and 0.46 , respectively ( fig .",
    "the lateral gradient of the temperature is larger as in the lower layer , and the temperature is in the thermal wind balance . in this respect ,",
    "the structure of the symmetric cells is very similar to that of the hadley cell ; the angular momentum is conserving in the upper layers and the temperature is balanced with the vertical shear ( compare with figs . 2 and 4 of s94 ) .",
    "as for the relationship with the hadley cell , the symmetric cells in the @xmath3-plane model should be investigated in terms of the argument by plumb and hou(1992 ) , in which the symmetric circulations are classified into two regimes : a non - meridional circulation regime in thermal wind balance with the prescribed heating ( a thermal equilibrium ( te ) solution ) and a meridional circulation regime with an angular momentum conserving flow in the upper layer ( an amc solution ) .",
    "they argued that the response takes the form of the te solution if the thermal forcing is weak or broad or it is far from the equator ( eq .",
    "( 8) and appendix of plumb and hou ) .",
    "although the newtonian cooling is used as the thermal forcing in plumb and hou , the similar argument is partly applied to the present study if their reference temperature @xmath70 is replaced by the surface temperature @xmath71 . in the @xmath3-plane model ,",
    "( 8) of plumb and hou corresponds to @xmath72{t_{s}}{y } < f.                                                       \\label{eq : te}\\ ] ] if this condition is satisfied , the angular momentum balanced with the surface temperature does not have an extremum in the interior of the atmosphere and the te solution is regular provided . plumb and hou further argued that the amc solution can not exist when the te solution is regular provided .",
    "if the surface temperature is linearly distributed ( eq .",
    "( [ eq : ts_f ] ) ) , the left hand side of ( [ eq : te ] ) vanishes and the inequality holds .",
    "however , it should be pointed out that the proof in their appendix is insufficient for the @xmath3-plane model , since they implicitly assumed that two hadley cells coexist : the summer cell and the winter cell .",
    "their relation ( a13 ) , which is derived from this assumption , does not hold in the present situation .",
    "thus , the possibility of the amc solution is not precluded even if ( [ eq : te ] ) is satisfied .",
    "in contrast to plumb and hou , s94 derived the condition for the amc solution and the latitudinal scale of the hadley cell from the relation between the surface temperature @xmath71 and the temperature in the middle layer @xmath73 which is in the thermal wind balance with the angular momentum conserving flow ( figs .",
    "11 and 13 of s94 ) . from this",
    ", the amc solution can exist when @xmath73 is higher than @xmath71 around the upward motion region .",
    "this condition is rewritten in terms of the gradients : @xmath74 the temperature deviation in the middle layer from that at the upward motion region of the amc solution is given by @xmath44 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : l_f ] ) . replacing @xmath42 by the distance from the upward motion region @xmath75 and @xmath44 by @xmath76 , one obtains @xmath77 from this ,",

    "( [ eq : l_delt_f ] ) estimates @xmath86 , which is much smaller than the cell width shown by fig .",
    "furthermore , eq . ( [ eq : l_delt_f ] ) approaches zero as @xmath87 and contradicts eq .",
    "( [ eq : l_f2 ] ) .",
    "one of the reasons for this underestimation is that the effect of static stability , which is important in the case of @xmath20 0 , is not taken into account in the derivation of eq .",

    "11 , the temperatures in the middle layers are maximum around @xmath88 where the precipitation occurs , and the temperatures are minimum near @xmath38 0.40 and 0.64 .",

    "as shown in the previous subsection , the symmetric cells are periodic rather than propagating .",
    "it has been argued that , if the upper angular momentum descends in the northern side , zonal winds become westerlies , and that these westerlies lead to the change of direction of the circulation and hence the periodicity . in order for the symmetric cells to preserve their circulation structure , the surface winds must be easterly in the northern side of the precipitating region .",
    "the zonal winds can be easterly only if the symmetric cells propagate southward during the overturning period , since the upper angular momentum descends to a more southern place than the place where it is supplied ( this is schematically shown by fig . 13 ) .",
    "the above consideration suggests that , as a convenient estimation , the upper bound of the speed of the propagation of the symmetric cells is given by @xmath96 , where @xmath2 is the overturning time and @xmath42 is the cell length .",
    "this corresponds to the ultimate case in which the angular momentum is conserved ( fig .",
    "the value of the angular momentum is reduced by the viscous transfer with the adjacent indirect cell in the northern side , and it is also preferable for the easterly .",
    "the viscosity also affects the speed as shown by fig .",
    "3 , though this effect is not easy to be taken into account in the simple scaling argument .",
    "it should be noted , however , that the above consideration does not tell which is the preferable direction for the propagation .",
    "the experiments show that the symmetric cells always propagate southward ( toward the warmer regions ) .",
    "the direction of the propagation seems to be controled by the requirement of the surface easterlies .",
    "one can suppose a basic state that has a westerly shear in thermal wind balance with the prescribed surface temperature gradient .",
    "the upper westerly does not change its direction if it descends at the same @xmath28 . only if it descends southward",
    ", it becomes easterly .",
    "there must be both easterlies and westerlies in the surface zonal winds on the constraint of the angular momentum conservation .",
    "the symmetric cells should move southward as a whole in order to cancel the basic westerly component and to produce surface easterlies by the advection .",
    "if they move northward , westerlies would be stronger at the surface .",
    "in this section , the symmetric cells in the case of @xmath37 0 are examined in terms of the symmetric instability ( si ) ( e.g. , stone , 1966 ; emanuel , 1979 , 1982 ) .",
    "it should be noted that it is impossible in the strict sense to say which instability is the origin of the symmetric cells , since the symmetric cells of the present study are disturbances in the statistically equilibrium states of a long time integration .",
    "stability of a prescribed initial field and time evolution of the field are mainly concerned in the instability problems .",
    "when one relates disturbances in the equilibrium states to some kind of instability , one should appropriately choose a reference state that is thought to be an initial state for the instability .",
    "a reference state is sometimes defined by an idealistic balanced state of forcings prescribed to the systems under consideration .",
    "an alternative definition of a reference state is given by a simple average ( in time or in space ) of the equilibrium states . in the following",
    ", relation between the symmetric cells and instabilities is considered according to the two kind of the reference states .",
    "forcings imposed on the present system are the radiative cooling below the tropopause ( @xmath97 0.1 ) and the sensible and the latent heats from the surface .",
    "if any motion is suppressed , a balanced state of the forcings is in principle statically unstable .",
    "convective motions will be produced to release the unstable stratification . in this respect , it is natural to consider the symmetric cells to be the circulations derived from the `` convective instability''(ci ) rather than si .",
    "as for the reference state as an average of the equilibrium states , a time - mean or space - mean state has , in general , no relation with the initial state for the instability ; the initial state will be lost when instability occurs , and may be no longer similar to the state of the full development of the instability .",
    "it is well known , however , that the equilibrium state is sometimes very close to the critical state for the instability , or becomes a slightly unstable state , as represented by `` convective adjustment '' and `` baroclinic adjustment '' .",
    "if this idea is also true for the present study , one may infer the origin of the symmetric cells by examining a reference state as a time - average of the equilibrium states .",

    ", then it seems difficult to relate the properties of the symmetric cells to si . in the moist situation , however , a view of the moist si may still be applied to the symmetric cells , if one isolates circulations associated with cumulus heating from the effect of moist process on stratification .",
    "emanuel ( 1982 ) considered moist si as cisk in a conditionally statically unstable state with a baroclinic flow .",
    "he pointed out that a symmetric mode which propagates toward warmer regions exists .",
    "this result is consistent with the present study , in which the symmetric cells are always propagating toward the warmer regions .",
    "it should be reminded that , in the present case , it is not clear whether moist circulations can be separately considered from its effect on the stratification as in emanuel , since the stratification of the system is maintained by the symmetric cells themselves .    as for the scale of the symmetric cells , it does not seem to be relevant to the scale predicted by the theories of si .",
    "according to the dry si theory , there are two horizontal scales : the horizontal wavelength and the horizontal projection of the isentropes based on the layer depth ( emanuel , 1979 ; thorpe and rotunno , 1989 ) .",
    "the wavelength of the dry si is controlled by frictional process particularly in the inviscid limit , but the viscosity is not important for the cell scale of the present study , although it may control the scale of the upward branch .",

    ", the cell scale is also approximately @xmath103 , although they did not clearly argue about the scale .",
    "however , the scale of the present symmetric cells is irrelevant to @xmath103 ; the scale is rather related to the slope of the angular momentum : @xmath104 where the effect of stability is neglected as in eq .",
    "( [ eq : l_delt_f ] ) .",
    "14(a ) shows that this scale is much smaller than @xmath103 .",
    "the symmetric cells which exist in the two - dimensional model are examined through the dependency on the surface temperature gradient . in the case of no surface temperature gradient ( @xmath20 0 ) , the circulations of the symmetric cells oscillate .",
    "the oscillation period is given by the convective time @xmath2 , and the cell scale by the rossby deformation radius .",
    "advection of the angular momentum by the convective motion of the cells is essential for the oscillation . in the case of a surface temperature gradient",
    "( @xmath37 0 ) , the symmetric cells propagate toward warmer regions .",
    "each symmetric cell consists of a cell in the warmer side of the precipitating region and a cell in the colder side .",
    "the cell shapes are different between the two types of the cells ; the width of the cells in the colder side is broader as in the upper layers , whereas the width in the warmer side is smaller as in the upper layers .",
    "successive cells are sloping and vertically in contact with each other , so that the angular momentum is vertically transferred by diffusive process from the upper cell ( in the warmer region ) to the lower cell ( in the colder region ) .",
    "the hadley cell in the axisymmetric model can be viewed as an extreme case of the symmetric cells ; it is the only symmetric cell that does not move .",
    "it is because a pair of the hadley cells of both hemisphere is symmetric about the equator and the upward motion of the hadley cells is located at the warmest region ( the equator ) .",
    "the structure of the symmetric cells is very similar to that of the symmetric hadley cell ; the cell width of colder regions ( higher latitudes ) is broader as in the upper layers .",
    "the scale of the symmetric cells is also determined by a similar mechanism to that of the hadley cell .",
    "it is determined by the relation between the surface temperature and the vertical mean temperature which is in the thermal wind balance with the angular momentum flow in the upper layers . in the hadley case ,",
    "the latitudinal dependency of the coriolis parameter ( the equatorial @xmath105 effect ) must be considered in the estimation of the cell width ( s94 , fig .",

    "the paths in the higher latitudes than 60@xmath15 are omitted .",
    "15 shows that eq .",
    "( [ eq : cell_pos ] ) reproduces a similar pattern to that of fig .",
    "according to eq .",
    "( 46 ) of s94 , the hadley scale is given by @xmath116 .",
    "it is comparable to the scale of the symmetric cells at the moment they reach the equator .    as for the results for @xmath20 0 as shown by fig .",
    "4 , the concentration of the precipitation to the equator becomes less clear as the surface temperature gradient becomes smaller , while a cellar structure still exists in the mid - latitudes .",
    "this difference may be attributed to the effect of rotation ; moist convective motions are organized into a cellar structure if there is sufficient rotation .",
    "the discussion by schneider(1977 ) should be reconsidered in terms of these results .",
    "schneider estimated the hadley width on the assumption that a reference temperature is horizontally uniform .",
    "this assumptions corresponds to the case @xmath20 0 of the present study .",
    "however , the hadley cell no longer exists in this case and schneider s estimation is not applicable .",
    "of course , it is too early to say that the hadley cell in a three - dimensional model will show the same behavior as in the present two - dimensional models in the case of @xmath20 0 .",
    "it has been reported that the concentration of the precipitation to the equator is sensitive to cumulus parameterization , in particular , when the surface temperature gradient is small near the equator ( hess et al . , 1993 ; numaguti , 1993 ) .",
    "it is not clear how the symmetric cells are relevant to the phenomena in the observed atmospheres .",
    "the latitudinal motion of the cumulus bands such as itcz may have a common mechanism of the movement of the symmetric cells .",
    "goswami and shukla(1984 ) simulated a northward propagation of the indian monsoon by using an axisymmetric gcm . in their calculation , there exists a disturbance propagating toward the warmer region with period around 15 days , and this disturbance has many similarities to the observed fluctuation of the indian monsoon .",
    "the structure of their disturbance is confined to the lower atmosphere and they pointed out the interaction with the land surface through the evaporation plays a key role . these properties are not seen in the present study , so it is not clear their disturbance and the symmetric cells of the present study have the same origin .",
    "although the symmetric cells are convective modes , they should be re - examined in terms of the symmetric instability ( e.g. , stone , 1966 ; emanuel , 1979 , 1982 ) . in particular , emanuel(1982 ) pointed out that a symmetric mode which propagates toward warmer regions exists in a shear flow of moist atmosphere .",
    "his results are consistent with the present study .",
    "it will be also interesting to study the relationship with the motion of the spiral bands of typhoon or with the phenomena in the planetary atmospheres such as the striped pattern of jupiter .",
    "the symmetric cells are also expected to exist in the dry atmosphere or in the boussinesq fluid , although all the experiments in the present study are for the moist atmosphere .",
    "they will oscillate under the uniform surface temperature condition , and will propagate toward warmer regions if there is a surface temperature gradient , since these are the consequences of the conservation of the angular momentum",
    ". the difference will be in their horizontal scale ; horizontal viscosity will play a major role in the scale of the cells in the dry atmosphere or in the boussinesq fluid , as in the case of the bnard convection .",
    "the symmetric cells should be discussed in a more general context , in which they are viewed as a convective motion on a rotating plane with a rigid boundary below and a slip boundary above .",
    "it should be also examined how the symmetric cells are modified in a large - scale three - dimensional field , particularly in the situation where both vertical convection and baroclinic waves co - exist in a vertically unstable basic stratification .",
