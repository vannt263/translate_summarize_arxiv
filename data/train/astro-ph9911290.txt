    "x - ray novae are outbursts of x - ray emission , often from black hole candidates , that exceed their quiescent flux levels by many orders of magnitude .",
    "about 50 x - ray novae have been detected in the last 35 years , each lasting typically several hundred days before their return back to quiescence ( @xcite ) .",
    "perhaps all of them are recurrent , but the recurrence period is unknown for most .",
    "probably , just small percentage of such systems in the galaxy have been discovered so far .    during outburst , x - ray novae",
    "are typically found in one of several distinguishable spectral states(e.g .",
    "@xcite ) . in the _ high _ state ,",
    "the spectrum is composed of a bright thermal component and an extended steep power - law with photon index around @xmath02.5 . in the _ low _ state , the spectrum is a hard power - law with a photon index of @xmath01.5 and an exponential high energy cutoff .",
    "a third state , the so - called _ very high _ state has also been recognized .",
    "it has a two component spectrum similar to the _ high _ state , but with somewhat stronger power - law component and with much more prominent fast variability ( @xcite ) .",
    "many x - ray novae demonstrate state transitions during the outburst that are associated with x - ray flux changes .",
    "it is widely believed that both the state transitions and the flux variations are regulated by variations in the accretion rate .",
    "similar states and state transitions were also observed in the persistent black hole systems , namely , cyg x-1 and gx 339 - 4 , but the dynamics of these systems is much slower , so they are more often observed in one of these states for extended period of time with occasional unpredictable transitions ( @xcite ) .    a new hard x - ray source grs 1739 - 278 was discovered near the galactic center on march 18 , 1996 by the sigma / granat gamma - ray telescope",

    "the rxte satellite observed x - ray nova grs 1739 - 278 on march 31 , 1996 and nine more times from may 10 through may 29 of that year , each with an exposure of several kiloseconds .",
    "the total exposure was about 24 ksec .",
    "the rxte satellite has two co - aligned spectrometers with @xmath01 degree field of view each : a set of five xenon proportional counters , pca , with maximum sensitivity in 4 - 20 kev energy range ; and a scintillation spectrometer , hexte , which consists of eight nai(tl)/csi detectors that are sensitive to 15 - 250 kev photons .",
    "hexte detectors are combined into two independent clusters of four detectors each , which alternate between measuring the source and the x - ray background .",
    "we used pca _ binned _ and _ single binned _ mode data in our timing analysis .",
    "we generated power density spectra ( pds ) in the 0.001256 hz frequency range ( 213 kev energy band ) .",
    "for lower frequencies ( below 0.3 hz ) a single fourier transform on the data binned in @xmath1 s time intervals was performed . for higher frequencies we summed together the results of fourier transforms made over short stretches of data with @xmath2 s time bins .",
    "the resulting spectra were logarithmically rebinned when necessary to reduce scatter at high frequencies and normalized to square root of @xmath3 fractional variability .",
    "the standard technique of subtracting the white  noise level due to the poissonian statistics , corrected for the dead  time effects , was employed ( @xcite ) . for spectral analysis we used ftools v.4.2 and the pca response matrix v.3.3 ( see jahoda et al .",

    "overall shape of the outburst may be characterized as fast - rise - exponential - decay ( fred - @xcite ) . however , the rise of this outburst was not particularly fast , and decay was interrupted by multiple secondary maxima .",
    "secondary maxima were observed in fred - type light curves of many x - ray novae ( @xcite ) .",
    "the rxte pointed instruments observed grs  1739278 during the decay of the outburst . the first observation ( march 31 )",
    "was made during the initial decay after the main maximum .",

    "construction of the pds for the first pca / rxte observation ( march 31 , 1996 - fig .  [ pds_spectra ] ) revealed the presence of a qpo feature with central frequency near 5 hz ( see table 1 for the qpo parameters ) .",

    "the pointing direction for the observations of grs  1739278 was offset by about 11 arcmin in order to reduce count rate from the pulsar - burster gro  j174428 ( @xcite ) .",
    "however , we were still concerned about the possible contamination of our power density spectra by this bright nearby source .",
    "so we analyzed the data from its observation of march 30 , 1996 , just one day before the first observation of grs  1739278 with rxte took place .",
    "the flux from gro  j174428 in the pca band ( 2 - 30 kev ) was 925 mcrab , while for grs  1739278 ( next day ) it was only 604 mcrab .",

    "so we conclude that contamination of the grs  1739278 observations by gro  j174428 , if any , was not a significant factor , and that the detected @xmath05 hz qpo do belong to grs  1739278 .",

    "are well fitted by a two - component model composed of `` multicolor '' accretion disk component ( makishima et al .",
    "1986 ) in the soft part of the spectrum with a power - law component at higher energies . detailed spectral analysis of grs  1739278 observations was presented by borozdin et al .",
    "( 1998 , 1999 ) . during the observation on march 31 , 1996 , when the qpo was detected , the power - law component in the energy spectrum was more prominent . during the subsequent observations in may 1996",
    "the qpo was not detected , the power - law component waned , and no hard flux was detected by hexte .",
    "strong rapid variability in x - ray band and extended power - law component in energy spectrum are both features of black hole binaries , when in _ very high _ state ( @xcite ) .",
    "we see that grs  1739278 was in this state on march 31 1996 , and made a transition down to a _",
    "high _ state sometime before may 10 .",
    "qpo features in power density spectra have been identified for a variety of black hole candidates including gx  3394 ( @xcite ) , nova muscae ( @xcite ) , xte  j1748 - 288 ( @xcite ) , and 4u  163047 ( @xcite ) .",
    "significant low - frequency variability has been observed in galactic microquasars grs  1915 + 105 ( @xcite ) and gro  j165540 ( @xcite ) , and also during the 1998 outburst of recurrent x - ray nova 4u  163047 ( @xcite ) .",
    "all of these objects were in their _ very high _ states during those observations .",
    "in many cases a correlation between the intensity of pds noise components and relative strength of the power - law spectral component was reported ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "grs  1739278 fits well into this picture as another example of transient lmxb ( low - mass x - ray binary ) and a black hole candidate .",
    "an interesting energy spectrum was observed with ttm telescope on mir - kvant module in march 1996 during the rise of the flux from the grs  1739278 ( @xcite ) .",
    "it is well described by a power law with absorption and does not require the introduction of an additional soft blackbody component . at the same time , the slope of the power - law component ( 2.3 - 2.7 ) is much steeper than the typical value for the _ low _ state of black - hole candidates ( 1.5 - 2.0 ) .",
    "a similar spectrum was observed earlier by ginga and granat satellite from the x - ray nova muscae 1991 ( @xcite ) and by ttm / kvant and sigma / granat from ks 1730 - 312 ( @xcite ) .",
    "later this type of spectrum was observed with rxte from xte  j1748 - 288 ( @xcite ) , 4u  1630 - 47 ( @xcite ) , and xte  j1550 - 564 ( @xcite ) .",
    "these examples show that the power - law shape of the spectrum with a variable slope is typical of soft x - ray novae during their flux rise and near the primary maximum .",
    "there is a clear tendency for the spectrum to steepen as the outburst progresses .",
    "however , the total x - ray luminosity is sometimes even higher than in the _ very high _ state observed later during the same outburst ( @xcite ) .",
    "the observation of power law spectrum with variable slope at the early phase of x - ray novae outbursts is important because this is when an accretion disk around black hole is formed .",
    "the generation of such spectrum should be a key element of any sound dynamical model for an accreting black hole .",
    "using pca / rxte archival data we detected , for the first time , a qpo feature in the pds of x - ray nova grs  1739 - 278 .",
    "qpo harmonics near 10 hz and strong band - limited noise at low frequencies were also observed .",
    "both the pds and the two - component energy spectrum for this observation displayed the properties typical for the _ very high _ state in black hole candidates .    in the later stages of the 1996 outburst , grs  1739 - 278 transitioned into a _",
    "high _ state with much weaker rapid variability and soft energy spectra that were dominated by thermal component with an effective temperature @xmath01 kev .",
    "observation of the two canonical states strongly supports the identification of grs  1739 - 278 as a black hole candidate based on the similarity of its x - ray properties with other black hole x - ray binaries .",
    "we note , that at the beginning of the outburst grs  1739 - 278 exhibited a power - law energy spectrum with a variable slope and tendency to steepen with time ( @xcite ) .",
    "similar spectra have been measured from several other x - ray novae during the early stages of their outbursts .",
    "these black hole candidates therefore seem to display a clear pattern in their spectral evolution .",
    "the rxte public data were extracted from the heasarc electronic archive operated by the goddard space flight center ( nasa ) .",
