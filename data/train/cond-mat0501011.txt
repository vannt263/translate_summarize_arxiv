    "de gennes ( 1972 ) identified an analogy between the meisner state of a superconductor and the smectic state of a liquid crystal . in the meisner state , magnetic field is expelled from the solid ; equivalently twist is expelled from the smectic state .",
    "abrikosov ( 1957 ) predicted a vortex solid state in type ii superconductors in an applied magnetic field .",
    "de gennes ( 1972 ) hinted at and renn and lubensky ( 1988 ) described the analogous phase for a liquid crystal . in the abrikosov vortex lattice ,",

    ", the state returns to a normal metal via a vortex liquid phase .",
    "twist is introduced into a smectic when the molecules have chirality and a single enantiomer is present .",
    "this contributes a term @xmath1    to the frank free energy density ( which describes the energy cost of distortions to the orientational order ) . here , @xmath2 is the strength of the twist and @xmath3 is the nematic director .",
    "renn and lubensky ( 1988 ) detailed a twist - grain - boundary state with blocks of well ordered smectic separated from one another by walls of regularly spaced dislocations .",
    "the layer normal is offset by an angle @xmath4 from one block to the next with an axis parallel to the planes .",
    "the angle is given by @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the thickness of the smectic layers and @xmath7 is the separation between screw dislocation lines .",
    "the structure thus has a helical axis and twist has been incorporated into the phase .",
    "chiral liquid crystals often have a cholesteric phase at high temperatures ; a full pursuit of the analogy would suggest that a twist line liquid phase , n@xmath8 , should occur between the cholesteric phase and the twist - grain - boundary phase in parallel to the vortex liquid phase .",
    "kamien and lubensky ( 1993 ) have discussed the structure of the n@xmath8 phase , concluding that the screw dislocation lines should themselves have cholesteric order .",
    "the tgb phase was discovered by goodby _",
    "et al _ ( 1989a , 1989b ) following the theoretical impetus . for the x - ray studies on oriented samples , which followed ,",
    "very long correlation lengths were required to see many ordered blocks of twist - grain - boundary phase .",
    "sample holders tens of microns thick with rubbed surfaces were used to create the orientational order .",
    "detailed studies of the tgb sma ( tgba ) phase and the tgba to n@xmath8 transition were carried out by navailles _",
    "the tgba phase was found to be made up of a series of blocks of sma order each with a layer normal which is perpendicular to the helical axis ( as implied by fig .",
    "the layer normal rotates in discrete steps from one block to the next at a grain boundary .",
    "it was shown that the size of sma blocks , @xmath9 , in the tgba phase was approximately equal to the distance between the screw dislocations , @xmath7 , in the grain boundaries as predicted ( renn & lubensky , 1988 ) .",
    "measurements using ac - calorimetry revealed a large @xmath10 peak ( chan & garland , 1995 ) consistent with the cholesteric phase evolving into a twisted line liquid phase n@xmath8 .",
    "the warming of the tgba phase into the n@xmath8 phase is the analogue of the abrikosov vortex lattice melting and here was shown to be a first - order transition .",
    "the transition from the vortex solid phase to the vortex liquid phase tgba to n@xmath8 was found to be marked by the helical twist angle becoming incommensurate ( navailles _ et al . _ , 1998 ) and a steady decrease in the sma order parameter ( here the parallel correlation length , @xmath11 , is reported to remain unchanged ) .",
    "further studies of the transition from the tgba to n@xmath8 phase have been made by ybert and coworkers ( ybert _ et al .",
    "_ , 2003 ) .",
    "they found the temperature dependence of the smectic correlation length consistent with the melting via the n@xmath8 phase .",
    "the different result to that reported above is likely due to an increase in the wave - vector resolution for the second study .",
    "renn and lubensky ( 1991 ) predicted a smc variant of the twist - grain - boundary phase where the molecules acquire a tilt angle in the plane perpendicular to the helical axis .",
    "further complications can occur .",
    "the smc phase is modified by chiral molecules to give the smc@xmath0 phase . the azimuthal angle associated with the tilt precesses from one plane to the next .",
    "this creates a helix with a pitch @xmath12 @xmath13 m . with chiral molecules",
    "there is the possibility of a tgb phase with twist along two orthogonal axes as predicted by renn ( 1992 ) for the tgb smc@xmath0 ( tgbc@xmath0 ) phase . here",
    "the smc slabs are grouped in larger clusters called helislabs with a shared helical axis for smc@xmath0 order .",
    "the tgb smc ( tgbc ) phase was discovered by nguyen _",
    "historically , x - ray measurements on oriented samples were made on tgbc phase before the tgba phase .",
    "on cooling from the n@xmath0 phase into the tgbc phase the continuous ring of scattering from short - range smectic correlations is seen to become strongly modulated in intensity ( navailles _ et al .",
    "_ , 1993 ) .",
    "the period of the modulation varies discontinuously on cooling .",
    "each peak on the ring is due to scattering from one set of blocks of smectic order . the orientation of these blocks jumps at the grain boundaries by angles commensurate with the pitch of the helix .",
    "both the pitch of the helix and the size of the blocks may vary with temperature .",
    "it was predicted by renn and lubensky ( 1991 ) that the layer normal would be perpendicular to the axis of the helix .",
    "experiments showed that this is not the case ( navailles _ et al .",
    "_ , 1995 ) , at least not for this variant of the tgbc phase .",
    "the tgbc phase studied in bordeaux and described above is designated b - tgbc .",
    "the situation is shown in fig.2 with the layer normal at angle @xmath14 to the direction of the molecules ( which are orthogonal to the helical axis ) .",
    "the tilt angle , @xmath14 , grows from zero with a power law on entering the tgbc phase .",
    "this observation implies that the grain boundaries are more complicated than a grid of screw dislocations .",
    "based on these results a model was created in which it was demonstrated that in the tgbc structure described by renn ( 1992 ) the director orientation can barely vary across a smc block ( dozov , 1995 ) .",
    "this limits the amount of twist that can be accommodated in this defect structure .",
    "dozov ( 1995 ) proposed a structure with a component of the layer normal in the tgb axis direction and with melted grain boundaries . with this structure",
    "the director can then precess across a block while maintaining a constant angle to the planes .    a further anomaly with the b - tgbc structure",
    "is that it has only been observed as a commensurate structure ( the ratio of the helical pitch @xmath15 to the block thickness @xmath9 is always an integer ) . with an incommensurate tgbc phase the plane spacing",
    "would be observed to decrease without the discrete spots developing .",
    "the fact that the structure is always commensurate implies that there are surprisingly long - range interactions between the smc blocks or between the defects in the boundaries ( galerne , 2000 ) .    ; the director field and layer normal for the @xmath16 slab are @xmath17 and @xmath18 respectively ( adapted from petit _",
    "et al . _ , 1996 ) . ]",
    "subsequently a range of other tgbc and tgbc@xmath0 phases were discovered .",
    "the most prominent feature with the new phases is that order is observed on @xmath13 m length scales in the plane perpendicular to the tgb axis .",
    "the first to be found was reported by pramod _",
    "the tgbc@xmath0 phase was observed in a binary mixture and exhibited a square grid pattern of in - plane undulations ; it is designated u - tgbc@xmath0 .",
    "subsequently x - ray studies were made on a single component tgbc material which also exhibited a square superstructure in - plane ( ribeiro _ et al .",
    "_ , 1999 ) .",
    "the spots from the smc blocks were substantially broadened in the tgb axis direction suggesting that the direction of the plane normal was varying within a block .",
    "it has not been determined whether the structure is commensurate .",
    "this phase was characterized by a team in strasbourg and hence is denoted the s - tgbc phase .",
    "a brief account has also been published ( brunet _ et al .",
    "_ , 2002 ) of a tgbc phase in which the normal to the plane is perpendicular to the tgb axis as predicted by renn and lubensky ( 1991 ) . in this case",
    "six spots are observed from the smc blocks and there is a simultaneous hexagonal grid pattern .",
    "galerne ( 2000 ) and subsequently brunet _ et al . _",
    "( 2002 ) have attempted to unify these results by extending renn s model of the tgbc@xmath0 phase ( renn , 1992 ) .",
    "galerne has shown that the helislab structure remains possible when the director is predominantly perpendicular to the tgb axis .",
    "for smc@xmath0 blocks the component of the director in the smectic plane , @xmath19 , precesses around the layer normal , @xmath20 .",
    "this can occur if there is a modulation of @xmath21 with wave vector @xmath22 in the yz plane and a simultaneous modulation of @xmath20 with the same wave vector but in the xz plane .",
    "the second modulation must have a phase shift of @xmath23 from the first .",
    "this construction gives smc@xmath0 order but requires that there is a compression and dilation of the layers .",
    "this could be possible for small smectic blocks and indeed is consistent with the peak broadening observed for the s - tgbc phase .",
    "it is shown that angular lock - in may occur due to elastic interactions between disclination lines .",
    "if so the helislabs will be commensurate and the disclination lines from different boundaries will overlay each other .",
    "disclination lines scatter light and so will be visible using microscopy . for large commensurate angles superstructures",
    "will be observed .",
    "this is consistent with some of the known behaviour of tgbc@xmath0 materials .",
    "brunet _ et al . _",
    "( 2002 ) introduced a perspective on tgbc and tgbc@xmath0 structures based on experience with smc@xmath0 materials sandwiched between glass plates .",
    "the model presented is somewhat similar to those of renn ( 1992 ) and galerne ( 2000 ) except that the helislabs are the same thickness as the smectic blocks .",
    "the blocks are polarization - splayed smectic slabs with boundaries that have a lattice of unwinding lines on either side .",
    "overlapping unwinding lines give the observed superstructures .",
    "the experimental results might be consistent with the models of galerne ( 2000 ) and brunet _ et al . _",
    "( 2002 ) with different size helislabs for the different structures observed .",
    "chiral molecules reduce the symmetry of the smc phase by facing , on average , a particular in - plane direction ( meyer _ et al . _ , 1975 ) . for molecules with a transverse dipole moment ( which is the usual case )",
    "this gives the ferroelectric smc@xmath0 phase .",
    "the structure has a slight precession of the tilt giving a helix with a pitch @xmath12 @xmath13 m .",
    "an antiferroelectric smc@xmath24 phase was discovered in the late 1980 s during attempts to synthesise new ferroelectric materials ( hiji _ et al .",
    "_ , 1988 ; furukawa _ et al .",
    "_ , 1988 ) as described by fukuda _",
    "the tilt and transverse dipole moment directions alternate by close to @xmath25 from one plane to the next , the deviation being due to the long helical pitch ( fig.3 ) .",
    "further cooling from this phase leads directly to either a solid crystal phase or a hexatic phase .",
    "subsequently new phases have been discovered which are stable both at higher temperature than the smc@xmath0 phase ( smc@xmath26 ) and also in the temperature range between the smc@xmath0 and smc@xmath24 phases ( fukuda _ et al .",
    "_ , 1994 ) . in the latter range",
    "two phases have been identified .",
    "one of the most powerful techniques for unraveling the nature of these phases is resonant x - ray diffraction ( mach _ et al .",
    "_ , 1998 ) .",
    "it has been possible to discriminate between plane ordering configurations for stacked planes of liquids .",
    "x - ray reflectivity studies have also been employed to study the stacking sequence of thin films ( fera _ et al .",
    "_ , 2001 ) .",
    "conventional x - ray diffraction studies of higher order reflections have probed the interdigitation of smectic layers ( takanishi _ et al . _ , 1995 ) .",
    "the observed phases are now the subject of theoretical research",
    ".      x - ray scattering at energies close to an atomic absorption edge reveals information about the environment of that atom .",
    "it is called resonant scattering and it has been used for two decades to study solid crystals .",
    "a key feature was demonstrated by templeton and templeton ( 1982 ) who showed that resonant scattering depends on the polarization direction for anisotropic molecules .",
    "the reason for this is that resonant scattering involves virtual transitions of the inner shell electron to an intermediate state ( als - nielsen & mcmorrow , 2001 )",
    ". the resonant effect probes the unoccupied states which are connected to the inner shell by an electric dipole transition .",
    "due to selection rules the possibility of transitions depends on the relative orientation of the x - ray electric field and the orbital .",
    "additional reflections can occur if the anisotropy of the electron environment exhibits a new periodicity .",
    "dmitrienko ( 1983 ) considered how resonant scattering would modify the signature of glide planes and screw axes .",
    "the form factor and polarization conditions for the new scattering at previously forbidden reflections were calculated .",
    "levelut and pansu ( 1999 ) extended the studies of dmitrienko : they calculated the tensor structure factor for different incommensurate helical phases and for specific plane sequence commensurate structures . in practice @xmath27 polarized radiation is usually used .",
    "the first - order reflections are then predicted to be @xmath28 polarized whereas the second - order reflections are elliptically polarized . in this case",
    "the balance between @xmath27 and @xmath28 depends on @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the scattering angle , leading to predominantly @xmath27 polarization .",
    "levelut and pansu ( 1999 ) note that models can be discriminated using polarization analysis and that distortion angles can be found from the relative intensities of the resonant reflections .",
    "a synchrotron x - ray source is essential to obtain the continuous spectrum of polarized radiation required for resonant diffraction .",
    "the low energies used for the sulfur k - edge are strongly scattered by air .",
    "this implies that the whole apparatus needs to be evacuated .",
    "figure 3 shows the range of different antiferroelectric phases that can occur for chiral materials with a smc phase .",

    "( 1998 ) presented the first attempt in this direction and they showed clearly that different antiferroelectric structures had different stacking sequences in terms of azimuthal orientation ( see fig.3 ) .",

    "if the n - sma transition occurs close in temperature to the i - n transition , then the n order is strongly enhanced by the sma order ( garland & nounesis , 1994 ) .",
    "this coupling leads to a tricritical point ( mcmillan , 1971 ; de gennes & prost , 1993 ) .",
    "conversely , if the n order is fully saturated before the n - sma transition , then the critical properties more closely resemble those for a two - component order parameter ( xy ) system in three dimensions ( 3d ) .",
    "coupling between the n fluctuations and the sma order parameter leads to an anisotropic critical regime .",
    "this picture has recently been confirmed with unprecedented precision via x - ray studies of samples aligned in a 5 t magnetic field ( primak _ et al .",
    "_ , 2002a & 2002b ) .",
    "the theory of this behaviour is not yet complete .",
    "any changes to these couplings due to the gel environment may well be instructive .",
    "anomalous elasticity in bulk sma materials was first discussed by grinstein & pelcovits ( 1981 ) .",
    "displacements in the layering direction and those perpendicular to the layers are coupled due to the non - linear stress - strain relation ( de gennes & prost , 1993 ) . due to the landau - peierls instability , there are always angular fluctuations .",
    "hence when the stress is zero the displacements in the in - plane direction cause displacements in the layering direction .",
    "this modifies the layer thickness .",
    "an imposed stress can easily be accommodated by suppressing the tilt fluctuations .",
    "a related effect occurs for the splay .",
    "the compression , b , and splay , k@xmath36 , elastic constants vanish and diverge respectively on long length scales .",
    "disorder may modify the tilt fluctuations and this may be reflected in the elastic properties .",
    "two models for the effect of the gel are considered .",
    "the first is the random - field model ( larkin & ovchinnikov , 1979 ) corresponding to the pinning of the layer position by the random disorder .",
    "the n - sma transition is described by a two component order parameter @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the strength of the density modulation , @xmath39 where @xmath6 is the layer periodicity , and @xmath40 is the layer displacements away from perfect order .",
    "the contribution to the smectic free energy density is @xmath41    the random disorder , @xmath42 , pins the phase of the density wave .",
    "these random fields would be expected to destroy the ordered state , replacing it with finite sized domains ( imry & ma , 1975 ) .",
    "the size of the domains and the structure factor are predicted to vary systematically with the variance of the layer pinning field ( aharony & pytte , 1983 ) .",
    "the changes depend on the lower marginal dimensionality of the system .",
    "the second model is due to radzihovsky and toner ( 1999 ) .",
    "they emphasise two important effects of the gel on the liquid crystal : the pinning of the position of the smectic layers and the pinning of the orientation of the nematic director .",
    "the contribution to the smectic free energy density is @xmath43    in this case @xmath44(@xmath45 ) represents a random tilt effect imposed by the gel on the director .",
    "the effect of the field , @xmath42 , is to destroy the ordered phase , replacing it with finite sized ordered domains since this is the random - field model described above .",
    "the effect of the field , @xmath46 , which pins the orientation of the nematic director , is to perturb the smectic order via the interaction between the two order parameters and their fluctuations .",
    "radzihovsky and toner ( 1999 ) found that the effect of disorder on the director would produce novel changes on the smectic state .",
    "a new smectic bragg glass state was predicted characterized by short - range smectic order , glassy dynamics and enhanced anomalous elasticity .",
    "fluctuations created by the perturbation of the director strongly enhance the anomalous elasticity effect ( radzihovsky & toner , 1999 ) .",
    "this model predicts that the correlation length should have a temperature dependence related to that of the layer compression modulus , b ( bellini _ et al .",
    ".    in the studies reviewed here liquid crystals are confined in chemically bonded porous silica structures ( aerogels ) or alternatively in a weakly bonded gel formed by hydrogen bonds between silica nanoparticles ( aerosils ) .",
    "with increasing quantities of silica the samples became progressively more opaque to x - rays .",
    "the availability of high brilliance synchrotron x - ray sources has facilitated the study of liquid crystal phase transitions within a silica gel environment .",

    "the smectic correlation length was found to saturate at a finite value at low temperatures and this value depended on the density of the gel structure ( fig.5 ) .",
    "both the 3d - xy random - field model and the model due to radzihovsky and toner ( 1999 ) predict that the structure factor characterizing the smectic fluctuations will be altered in the gel .",
    "the solid lines in fig.5 are the result of fits of the anticipated two - component line - shape to 8ocb - aerosil data .",
    "the finite correlation length indicates that the qlro sma phase has been destroyed , although there remains a pseudo - transition between a high temperature regime where thermal fluctuations dominate and a low temperature regime where static quenched - random effects dominate .",

    "_ , 2003b ) .",
    "the two - component line - shape also gave a very good account of these results .",
    "a low temperature correlation length could not be extracted in this case due to the intervention of the sma - smc phase transition .",
    "the correlation lengths at low temperature for 8cb - aerosil and 8ocb - aerosil are plotted in fig.6 as a function of the density of the gel ( @xmath48 = mass of silica / volume of liquid crystal ) . since each new particle perturbs the average phase which is favourable to the existing aerosils ,",
    "the gel density is taken to be a measurement of the variance of the random field .",
    "the solid lines in fig.6 are the expected behaviour according to 3d - xy random - field model ( aharony & pytte , 1983 ) .",
    "the good agreement suggests that layer pinning may be the dominant effect in these systems .",

    "low n susceptibility implies little coupling between n and sma order parameters and @xmath49 approaches the 3d - xy value . for the n - sma transition in an aerosil gel @xmath49 moves toward the 3d - xy value with increasing gel density .",

    "_ , 2003 ; iannacchione _ et al .",

    "the evidence suggests that the n - sma anisotropic criticality moves toward 3d - xy pseudo - criticality in the presence of quenched random disorder .",
    "this observation is consistent with the gel causing the n susceptibility to decrease toward zero .",
    "this effect is not currently part of either theoretical model .",
    "one of the key differences between x - ray results for the n - sma in aerogel and aerosil is the temperature dependence of the correlation lengths and the susceptibility .",

    "this prediction is for the case of disorder which has been stretched so that the nematic director has a preferred orientation .",
