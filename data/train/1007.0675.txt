    "since 1998 a huge amount of data has been accumulated which directly or indirectly back up the conclusion , first obtained in @xcite , that our current universe entered a phase of accelerated expansion .",
    "direct support is provided by the luminosity - distance data of supernovae of type ia ( snia ) @xcite ( but see also @xcite ) , indirect support comes from the anisotropy spectrum of the cosmic microwave background radiation @xcite , from large - scale - structure data @xcite , from the integrated sachs ",
    "wolfe effect @xcite , from baryonic acoustic oscillations @xcite and from gravitational lensing @xcite .",
    "most current cosmological models rely on the assumption that the dynamics of the universe is described by einstein s general relativity and a material content that is dominated by two so far unknown components , pressureless dark matter ( dm ) and dark energy ( de ) , a substance equipped with a large negative pressure . for reviews of the actual situation see @xcite and references therein .",
    "the preferred model is the @xmath1cdm model which also plays the role of a reference model for alternative approaches to the de problem . according to the interpretation of the data within this model ,",
    "our universe is dynamically dominated by a cosmological constant @xmath1 which contributes more than 70% to the total cosmic energy budget .",
    "more than 20% are contributed by cold dark matter ( cdm ) and only about 5% are in the form of conventional , baryonic matter .",
    "because of the cosmological constant problem in its different facets , including the coincidence problem ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , a great deal of work was devoted to alternative approaches in which a similar dynamics as that of the @xmath1cdm model is reproduced with a time varying cosmological term , i.e. , the cosmological constant is dynamized .",
    "both dm and de manifest themselves so far only through their gravitational interaction .",
    "this provides a motivation for approaches in which dm and de appear as different manifestation of one single dark - sector component .",
    "the chaplygin - gas model and its different generalizations @xcite realize this idea .",
    "unified models of the dark sector of this type are attractive since one and the same component behaves as pressureless matter at high redshifts and as a cosmological constant in the long time limit .",
    "while the homogeneous and isotropic background dynamics for the ( generalized ) chaplygin gas is well compatible and even slightly favored @xcite by the data , the study of the perturbation dynamics resulted in problems which apparently ruled out all chaplygin - gas type models except those that are observationally almost indistinguishable from the @xmath1cdm model @xcite .",
    "the point here is that a generally finite adiabatic speed of sound in generalized chaplygin gas ( gcg ) models predicts oscillations ( or instabilities ) in the power spectrum which are not observed .",
    "also the analysis of the anisotropy spectrum of the cosmic microwave background disfavored these models @xcite , except possibly for low values of the hubble parameter @xcite . to circumvent this problem ,",
    "nonadiabatic perturbations were postulated and designed in a way to make the effective sound speed vanish @xcite . but this amounts to an ad hoc procedure which leaves open the physical origin of nonadiabatic perturbations",
    ". there exists , however a different type of unified model of the dark sector , namely viscous models of the cosmic medium .",
    "it was argued in @xcite , that a viscous pressure can play the role of an agent that drives the present acceleration of the universe .",
    "the option of a viscosity - dominated late epoch of the universe with accelerated expansion was already mentioned in @xcite , long before the direct observational evidence through the sn ia data . for",
    "more recent investigations see , e.g. @xcite and references therein . in the homogeneous and isotropic background viscous fluids",
    "share the same dynamics as gcgs @xcite .",
    "but while perturbations in a ( one - component ) gcg are always adiabatic , viscous models of the dark sector are intrinsically nonadiabatic . in a recent paper",
    "we showed explicitly that , different from the chaplygin - gas case , the power spectrum for viscous matter is well behaved and consistent with large - scale - structure data .",
    "in particular , it does not suffer from the mentioned oscillation problem @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "what is observed in the redshift surveys is not the spectrum of the dark - matter distribution but the baryonic matter spectrum . including a baryon component into the perturbation dynamics for a universe with a chaplygin - gas dark sector , it turned out , that the mentioned oscillation within the dark component are not transferred to the baryons @xcite .",
    "the baryonic matter power spectrum is well behaved and consistent with observation .",
    "instead , there appears the new problem that the unified chaplygin - gas scenario itself is disfavored by the data .",
    "it is only if the unified scenario with a fixed pressureless ( supposedly ) baryonic matter fraction of about @xmath2 ( according to the wmap results ) is _ imposed _ on the dynamics , that consistency with the data is obtained .",
    "if the pressureless matter fraction is left free , its best - fit value is much larger than the baryonic fraction .",
    "in fact it becomes even close to unity , leaving only a small percentage for the chaplygin gas , thus invalidating the entire scenario .",
    "in other words , a chaplygin - gas - based unified model of the dark sector is difficult to reconcile with observations .",
    "one may ask now , whether the status of unified models can again be remedied by replacing the chaplygin gas by a viscous fluid .",
    "it is exactly this question that we are going to investigate in the present paper .",
    "it is our purpose to study cosmological perturbations for a two - component model of baryons and a viscous fluid , where the latter represents a one - component description of the dark sector .",
    "we shall show that such type of unified model is not only consistent for a fixed fraction of the baryons but also for the case that the matter fraction is left free .",
    "our analysis demonstrates that the statistically preferred value for the abundance of pressureless matter is compatible with the mentioned baryon fraction @xmath2 that follows from the synthesis of light elements .",
    "the contents of the paper is as follows : in section [ the two - component model ] we establish our two - component model of a viscous dark component and baryons and discuss its background dynamics .",
    "section [ perturbations ] is devoted to the perturbation dynamics of this mixture .",
    "subsection [ total ] considers the nonadiabatic total energy - density perturbations , subsection [ relative ] presents a dynamical equation for the relative entropy perturbations and in subsection [ baryons ] we obtain the fractional baryonic energy - density perturbations which are shown to be adiabatic at high redshifts . a numerical integration and tests against data from the matter power spectrum , the hubble function @xmath3 and snia are given in section [ numerical analysis ] , which also contains a statistical analysis of the validity of the viscous unified model itself .",
    "finally , section [ discussion ] summarizes and discusses our main results .",
    "the cosmic medium is assumed to be describable by an energy - momentum tensor @xmath4 which splits into a matter part @xmath5 and viscous fluid part @xmath6 , @xmath7 with @xmath8 where the subscript  m \" stands for matter and the subscript  v \" stands for viscous . the total cosmic fluid is characterized by a four velocity @xmath9 while @xmath10 represents the four velocity of the matter part and @xmath11 represents the four velocity of the viscous fluid .",
    "energy - momentum conservation is supposed to hold separately for each of the components , @xmath12 in particular , the energy balances are @xmath13 and @xmath14 where ( up to first order ) @xmath15 and @xmath16 . in general , the four velocities of the components are different .",
    "we shall assume , however , that they coincide in the homogeneous and isotropic zeroth order , @xmath17 difference will be important only at the perturbative level .",
    "let the matter be pressureless and the viscous fluid be characterized by a bulk viscous pressure @xmath18 , @xmath19 where @xmath20 const and @xmath21 is the fluid expansion . under this condition",
    "the total pressure coincides with the pressure of the viscous component .",
    "the total background energy density is @xmath22 , where @xmath23 the total energy balance is @xmath24 . in the homogeneous and isotropic background one has @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the hubble rate .",
    "if , moreover , the background is spatially flat , the friedmann equation @xmath27 implies @xmath28 , such that @xmath29 .",
    "this coincides with the special case @xmath30 for the equation of state @xmath31 of a generalized chaplygin gas , if we identify @xmath32 . in terms of the present value @xmath33 of the deceleration parameter",

    "these relations show that it is the total energy density that behaves as a gcg , not the component @xmath41 .",
    "this type of unified model differs from unified models in which the total energy density is the sum of a gcg and a baryon component . only if the baryon component is ignored , both descriptions coincide . for the total equation of state parameter",
    "we obtain @xmath42 consequently , in the homogeneous and isotropic background , a generalized chaplygin gas with @xmath43 can be seen as a unified description of the cosmic medium , consisting of a separately conserved matter component and a bulk viscous fluid with @xmath20 const , where the latter itself represents a unified model of the dark sector .",
    "the system is characterized by the equations of state ( [ pmv ] ) .",
    "it is expedient to emphasize that we have neither an equation of state @xmath44 nor an equation of state @xmath45 .",
    "it is only in the spatially flat background when , via friedmann s equation , the relation @xmath46 reduces to @xmath47 and the corresponding energy density coincides with the energy density of a gcg . neither the component @xmath41 nor the system as a whole are adiabatic . because of @xmath46 , the pressure perturbation is @xmath48 , where a hat on top of the symbol denotes the ( first - order ) perturbation of the corresponding quantity .",
    "the nonadiabaticity of the system as a whole is characterized by @xmath49 where we have introduced the abbreviations @xmath50 the quantity ( [ p- ] ) is governed by the dynamics of the total energy - density perturbation @xmath51 and by the perturbations @xmath52 of the expansion scalar , which is also a quantity that characterizes the system as a whole .",
    "the behavior of these quantities is described by the energy - momentum conservation for the entire system and by the raychaudhuri equation , respectively . both of these equations are coupled to each other .",
    "the remarkable point is that these quantities and , consequently , the total energy density perturbation , are independent of the two - component structure of the medium .",
    "the reason is the direct relation @xmath48 between the pressure perturbations and the perturbations of the expansion scalar .",
    "this is different from perturbations in a two - component system where each of the components is adiabatic on its own .",
    "it will turn out that the total energy - density perturbations are characterized by a homogeneous second - order differential equation .",
    "these perturbations , which are intrinsically nonadiabatic , then act as source terms in the evolution equation for the relative entropy perturbations .",

    "the difference to the latter might appear surprising since @xmath33 characterizes the system as a whole and the addition of a small fraction of baryons should , at the first glance , not have a large impact on the total dynamics . however , it is not the background dynamics that counts here . in the present case",
    "the pdf for @xmath33 is inferred from power - spectra data that are related to the fluctuations @xmath129 , while in the one - component model these data were related to the fluctuations @xmath103 of the total energy density . as relation  ( [ del1 ]",

    "the appearance of a maximum for @xmath143 means , that the results of a first - order analysis may well be compatible with the results for the background , which imply @xmath143 .",

    "it is well known that , in a homogeneous , isotropic and spatially flat background universe , there exists an equivalence between viscous and generalized chaplygin - gas models for a unified description of the cosmological dark sector @xcite .",
    "the cosmic substratum at the present time is then approximated as a mixture of one of these dark components and baryons .",

    "the present viscous model , on the other hand , remains an option for a unified description of the dark sector , at least as far as the matter power spectrum is concerned .",

    "<S> we investigate the cosmological perturbation dynamics for a universe consisting of pressureless baryonic matter and a viscous fluid , the latter representing a unified model of the dark sector . in the homogeneous and isotropic background </S>",
    "<S> the _ total _ energy density of this mixture behaves as a generalized chaplygin gas . </S>",
    "<S> the perturbations of this energy density are intrinsically nonadiabatic and source relative entropy perturbations . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting baryonic matter power spectrum is shown to be compatible with the 2dfgrs and sdss ( dr7 ) data . </S>",
    "<S> a joint statistical analysis , using also hubble - function and supernovae ia data , shows that , different from other studies , there exists a maximum in the probability distribution for a negative present value @xmath0 of the deceleration parameter . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , while previous descriptions on the basis of generalized chaplygin - gas models were incompatible with the matter power - spectrum data since they required a much too large amount of pressureless matter , the unified model presented here favors a matter content that is of the order of the baryonic matter abundance suggested by big - bang nucleosynthesis . </S>"
