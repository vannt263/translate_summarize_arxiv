    "gamma - ray line spectroscopic analyses of solar flare emissions have shown that the composition of the gamma - ray production regions is generally close to coronal ( see @xcite ) : the abundances of the low fip ( first ionization potential ) elements mg , si and fe relative to the high fip elements c and o are enhanced by a factor of 45 @xcite in comparison with photospheric abundances .",
    "we took the coronal abundances from ref .",
    "@xcite , except for he / h for which we adopted the helioseismological value he / h=0.084 @xcite . for the accelerated particles",
    ", we used an impulsive - flare average composition obtained from solar energetic particle measurements @xcite , except for @xmath15/@xmath7 for which we used an abundance ratio of 0.5 .",
    "such a relatively high concentration of accelerated @xmath15-particles has been proposed to explain the intense @xmath15-@xmath3he fusion lines observed in several flares ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the two gamma - ray spectra shown in fig .",
    "8 were calculated for @xmath0he/@xmath15=0 ( _ dotted line _ ) and @xmath0he/@xmath15=0.5 ( _ solid line _ ) .",
    "the latter value is typical of the @xmath0he enrichment of the solar energetic particles accelerated in impulsive flares ( see @xcite ) . for the source energy spectrum of the fast ions",
    ", we took for all species a power law in kinetic energy per nucleon , @xmath69 , with @xmath70=4 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "we see in fig .",
    "8 that the 937 kev line is relatively strong in comparison with other lines produced by accelerated protons and @xmath15-particles .",
    "however , we also see from the gamma - ray spectrum calculated without accelerated @xmath0he , that analysis of this line can be complicated by the proximity of another line at 931 kev , which is produced in the reaction @xmath71fe(@xmath7,@xmath72)@xmath73fe@xmath8 @xcite . in fig .  9a",
    ", we show the fluence ratio of the 931 kev line to the 937 kev line , as a function of the power law spectral index of the accelerated particle energy spectrum .",
    "we used for @xmath54(931  kev ) the values supplied in table  a3 of ref .",
    "the relative contribution of the 931  kev line rapidly diminishes for increasing @xmath70 , because this line is produced for proton energies above the reaction threshold @xmath74=11.4  mev , whereas @xmath54(937  kev ) peaks at significantly lower @xmath0he energy per nucleon , @xmath752.4  mev / nucleon ( see table  1 and fig .  4 ) .",
    "given the assumed coronal abundance ratio @xmath71fe/@xmath1o=0.16 and the adopted accelerated particle composition with @xmath0he/@xmath7=0.25 , the 931  kev line fluence is @xmath445% of that of the 937  kev line for @xmath70@xmath434 .",
    "as shown in fig .",
    "8 , the @xmath0he line at 1042 kev can also be blended with another significant line , which is produced from the reaction @xmath71fe(@xmath15,@xmath76)@xmath77co @xcite .",
    "9b illustrates that the 1049  kev line should generally be considered , especially if the accelerated particle spectrum is hard ( i.e. low values of @xmath70 ) . in addition , the analysis of the 1042 kev line can be complicated as in this experiment by the proximity of the 1054 kev line also produced in the reaction @xmath1o(@xmath0he,@xmath7)@xmath2f@xmath8 ( see fig .  1 and   iii ) .",
    "the 1081 and 1887  kev lines are expected to be separated from other important lines ( fig .",
    "they are , however , weaker than the 937 and 1042  kev lines .",
    "the 1887  kev line is broader than the three other @xmath0he lines , because it is produced at higher @xmath0he energies .",
    "9c shows the fluence ratio of the 1887 kev line to the 937 kev line , as a function of the spectral index @xmath70 .",
    "we see that the calculated ratio decreases by one order of magnitude , from 0.4 for @xmath70=2 to 0.04 for @xmath70=6 .",
    "since both lines are produced from @xmath0he - induced reactions on the same @xmath1o target , this ratio is independent of the ambient medium and accelerated particle compositions .",
    "it depends only on the accelerated @xmath0he energy spectrum , which is important in understanding the acceleration mechanism in impulsive solar flares ( see @xcite ) .",
    "it is noteworthy that a significant synthesis of @xmath2f nuclei in solar flares could also be identified through the characteristic , long living , 511  kev emission expected from the @xmath9 decay of this isotope ( @xmath10=109.77  m ) .",
    "the detection of this delayed emission , maybe with the _ rhessi _ satellite , would furthermore provide a new insight into mixing and transport processes in the solar atmosphere .    in summary , the four cross sections measured in this experiment could allow one to determine with a good accuracy the abundance of @xmath0he accelerated in solar flares and interacting in the solar atmosphere .",
    "the strongest of the gamma - ray lines from @xmath0he - induced reactions is the one at 937 kev from the reaction @xmath1o(@xmath0he,@xmath7)@xmath2f@xmath8 , which however , can overlap with a line at 931 kev , produced in the reaction @xmath71fe(@xmath7,@xmath72)@xmath73fe@xmath8 .",
    "if observed , the 1887 kev line from the reaction @xmath1o(@xmath0he,@xmath11)@xmath2ne@xmath8 would furthermore provide unique information on the energy spectrum of the accelerated @xmath0he .",
    "we would like to thank the operator crew of the orsay tandem accelerator for their engagement in the preparation of the experiment , as well as frdrico garrido , claire boukari , jacques chaumont and catherine clerc for their assistance in the rbs measurements .",
