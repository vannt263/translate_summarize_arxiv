    "also measurement of both @xmath0 and @xmath3 is clearly desirable to partly resolve the discrete ambiguity in @xmath2 .    in this talk",
    "i will review the theory of measuring the ckm angle @xmath4 from various @xmath5 decays to charm final states .",

    "the @xmath24 system originating from @xmath25 can , in principle , have any integer spin but it is found experimentally that , below 1.3 gev , the @xmath26 and @xmath27 waves dominate . assuming that the strong interactions between the @xmath28 and the @xmath29 are small , one can obtain additional information about the p - wave phase shift by an angular analysis of the decay @xmath25 .",
    "this additional information can then be used to resolve the sign ambiguity in @xmath19 measurement .",
    "the result of such an analysis yields a positive value for @xmath19 @xcite , which combined with that the value of @xmath18 obtained in @xmath1 results in a value of @xmath2 which is consistent with standard model expectations .",
