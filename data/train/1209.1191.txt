    "theoretical understanding of the so - called higgs boson of qcd namely the @xmath0 or @xmath2 meson is important as they play an important role in chiral symmetry breaking and can be used as a probe for qcd vacuum .",
    "while the confirmation of its existence from @xmath3 scattering process puts an end to the decades - long controversy @xcite , the agreement on the nature of @xmath4 however has not yet been achieved .",
    "the tetraquark model @xcite supports @xmath4 to be a tetraquark state .",
    "whereas , recent data from @xmath3 and @xmath5 scattering @xcite suggest it has a sizable fraction of glueball and another study from k - matrix analysis @xcite suggested that @xmath6 should be a glueball dominant state .",
    "on the other hand the agreement on the lowest possible iso - scalar and pseudoscalar glueball states has neither been acheived .",
    "the result from lattice simulations suggests @xmath7 or @xmath8 could be a glueball rich iso - scalar , while @xmath9 can be a glueball rich pseudoscalar @xcite .",
    "the great success of chiral symmetry in understanding the nature of lightest pseudo - scalars motivates us to use an extended version of linear @xmath0 models @xcite to study the nature of these low - lying isoscalars and pseudoscalars . the motivation for constructing an extended linear sigma model consisting of effective quarkonia",
    ", tetraquark and glueball fields comes from the physical considerations that scalar condensates are allowed by the qcd vacuum .",
    "so in principle apart from quarkonia and tetraquark condensates , scalar glueball condensate should also be present in the qcd vacuum and need to be considered while studying the vacuum excitation .",
    "the mixing pattern followed in our framework comes from the consideration that mesons having identical external quantum numbers can mix even if they have different internal flavour structures .",
    "based on these premises we attempt to study the nature of @xmath4 meson as well as lowest iso - scalar and pseudoscalar glueball candidate . in the following section we briefly review the model lagrangian and the symmetry breaking pattern .",
    "at last we will present our results and conclude .",
    "the extended linear @xmath0 model can be systematically formulated under the symmetry group @xmath10 .",
    "three types of chiral fields are included : a @xmath11 matrix field @xmath12 which denotes the quarkonia states , a @xmath11 matrix field @xmath13 which denotes the tetraquark state , and a complex chiral singlet field @xmath14 which denotes the pure glueball states .    up to the mass dimension @xmath15 ( we assume that they are the most important operators to determine the nature of light scalars of ground states ) , the lagrangian of our model can include two parts : the symmetry invariant part @xmath16 and the symmetry breaking one @xmath17 .",
    "the symmetry invariant part includes those terms which respect @xmath18 symmetry as well as @xmath1 symmetry :    @xmath19 + [ k \\,\\ , y det(\\phi ) + h.c.],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    while the symmetry breaking part includes the following terms -0.2 in @xmath20 + [ tr(b^\\prime.\\phi^\\prime ) + h.c . ]   + ( d.y + h.c . )",
    "- [ \\lambda_m tr(\\phi \\phi^{\\dagger \\prime } ) + h.c . ] .",
    "\\label{sbt}\\ ] ] to construct the symmetric terms in the lagrangian we closely follow @xcite where the choice of terms are limited by the number of internal quark plus antiquark lines at the effective vertex , which is set to 8 . this condition is relaxed for two terms with coupling constants @xmath21 and @xmath22 and the reason to include these two terms stems from the practical consideration of making sure our potential is bounded",
    ". for detailed discussion on the terms appearing in the lagrangian please refer to @xcite . as evident from the lagrangian",
    "both chiral symmetry @xmath23 and @xmath24 symmetry are explicitly broken by the terms in @xmath17 .",
    "the @xmath25 matrices @xmath26 and @xmath27 responsible for the breaking of the symmetry can be parametrized as : @xmath28 ( @xmath29 are the generators of @xmath30 with @xmath31 ) .",
    "since the vacuum expectation values of the quarkonia and tetraquark fields can carry those quantum numbers which are allowed by the qcd vacuum , only @xmath32 fields are allowed .",
    "the choice of this external fields @xmath33 control the nature and extent of the symmetry breaking .",
    "out of various possible symmetry breaking scenarios , we consider the following case in our present study where :    * @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 . in this case ,",
    "@xmath37 and @xmath38 both are explicitly broken and @xmath38 is broken to @xmath39 . as a result @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is the quark mass of the @xmath42 flavour .",
    "this is reasonable considering the up and down quark masses are nearly equal to each other and thereby indicating @xmath39 is a good ( approximate ) symmetry .",
    "the remnant @xmath39 isospin symmetry allows us to represent two condensates for quarkonia and teraquark fields each as : @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 , @xmath46 respectively . while the gluonic condensate in our theory is labeled as @xmath47 .",
    "due to the unbroken @xmath48 isospin symmetry , physical scalar and pseudo - scalar states can be categorized into three groups with isospin quantum numbers as @xmath49 ( triplet ) , @xmath50 ( doublet ) and @xmath51 , respectively .",
    "only bare quarkonia , tetraquark and glueball fields with the same isospin quantum number can mix with each other to form physical states . moreover , there is no mixing between scalar and pseudoscalar fields .",
    "thus the chiral singlet glueball field can only mix with the isospin singlets of quarkonia and tetraquark fields . using these facts , the physical states below 2 gev can be tabulated as given in table [ mixing ] , where the isodoublet @xmath52 is connected with the isodoublet \\{@xmath53 } by charge conjugation .",
    "and a similar relation holds for @xmath54 , @xmath55 and @xmath56 , @xmath57 .",
    "it is found that the condition @xmath58 can predict the lightest glueball scalar should be around 2.0 gev or so , as can be read off from fig .",
    "( [ figf]b ) , while the lightest glueball pseudo scalar should be @xmath59 .",
    "the mass splitting between these two glueball states is controlled by parameters @xmath60 and @xmath61 and is found to be around @xmath62 gev . when compared with the lattice qcd prediction for the glueball bare mass reported in @xcite where the mass is @xmath63 gev ,",
    "our result @xmath64 gev is slightly heavier than this prediction .",
    "when @xmath65 gev is taken , then the predicted mass of the lightest glueball is @xmath66 gev .",
    "3 ) the lightest scalar @xmath67 is found to be @xmath68 gev or so and is a quarkonia dominant state .    in figure",
    "[ figf ] , we demonstrate the dependence of @xmath61 and @xmath69 masses upon the free parameter @xmath70 with the rest of parameters are given in table ( [ chi1-prm ] ) . as shown in fig .",
    "( [ figf]a ) , when @xmath70 is larger than @xmath71 gev@xmath72 , the @xmath61 becomes negative .",
    "then the potential of our model has to confront with the problem of unbounded vacuum from below . in the allowed values of @xmath70 , the masses of @xmath73 are almost independent of its value , as demonstrated in fig .",
    "( [ figf]b ) .",
    "the upper bound of @xmath70 is determined from the condition @xmath74 gev .    to conclude",
    ", our model predicts that the isoscalar glueball should be heavier than @xmath75 gev when the pseudoscalar @xmath76 is the best glueball candidates .",
    "the lowest isoscalar @xmath2 is found to be quarkonia dominant state with a considerable tetraquark component .",
