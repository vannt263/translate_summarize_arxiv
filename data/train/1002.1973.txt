    "in the past decade , studies of the central regions of the virgo and fornax galaxy clusters have revealed dozens of massive compact objects in the luminosity range @xmath8 mag , with half - light radii between 10 and 30 pc and central velocity dispersions @xmath9 km  s@xmath10 @xcite .",
    "@xcite dubbed the new objects `` ultra - compact dwarf '' galaxies ( ucds ) , a term that was immediately controversial because of the galaxian origin that it implies .",
    "the term has since come to describe a  mixed bag of objects \" , in the words of @xcite , defined only by observational parameters and saying nothing about evolutionary history . when combined with other structural parameters ,",
    "these objects show similarities to both massive globular clusters , and nuclear star clusters in dwarf elliptical galaxies @xcite , raising the possibility of a shared formation history among some of these objects .",
    "the gc system of the nearby giant elliptical galaxy ngc 5128 offers an interesting target to compare the properties of massive stellar systems to those of typically less massive systems contained within the local group .",
    "the relatively simple structures of gcs are fairly well approximated by isotropic , single - mass king ( 1966 ) models and the structural parameters of these stellar systems such as core- and half - light radii , central concentrations , surface brightnesses , velocity dispersions , mass - to - light ratios , etc .",
    ", have been shown to inhabit only a narrow region called the fundamental plane ( fp ; @xcite ) .",
    "while the fp relations are well established for milky way gcs , there have been only limited studies done for the properties of gcs in external galaxies . the external galaxy for which similar studies have mostly been done",
    "is m31 , a disc galaxy similar to the milky way .",
    "the structures of its gcs appear to share similar properties to those in the milky way @xcite .",
    "@xcite undertook one such study and report velocity dispersions for four of the m31 clusters being as high as @xmath11 @xmath12 20 kms@xmath10 , implying masses of the order of the largest galactic globular cluster @xmath13cen @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to note that both @xmath13cen and g1 , the largest of the four m31 clusters , share similar peculiarities .",
    "@xmath13cen is the most flattened galactic globular cluster @xcite with significant [ fe / h ] differences among its member stars @xcite , two characteristics shared by g1 , although it should be noted that g1 s metallicity spread was inferred from the photometric width of the rgb @xcite .",
    "a possible explanation for the odd properties of these massive clusters is that they could be the nuclei of tidally stripped dwarf elliptical galaxies ( des ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this idea seems to be supported by studies of massive , compact stellar systems in the virgo ( dgtos ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and fornax ( ucds ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) galaxy clusters , which appear to share characteristics with both nuclear star clusters in des ( de , ns ) and the most massive globular clusters in m31 and the mw .",
    "the virgo and fornax dgto / ucds show a size - luminosity relation similar to that of de / de , ns while having a range of sizes similar to that of massive local gcs @xcite .",
    "another explanation is that massive compact systems could be merged young massive clusters ( ymcs ) produced by violent galaxy - galaxy mergers @xcite . @xcite",
    "present [ fe / h ] estimates from a spectroscopic study of 26 compact objects in the central regions of fornax which were compared to 5 known fornax de , ns .",
    "it was found that the mean metallicities of compact objects with @xmath14 mag are @xmath15 dex higher than for the de , ns while their @xmath16 colors suggest that they are generally younger ( and/or more metal - poor ) than the dwarf nuclei .",
    "the mean metallicities agreed much more with those for ymcs of comparable masses , thus consistent with the ymc merging formation scenario",
    ". studies of massive star clusters discovered in the virgo cluster @xcite reveal brighter and bluer objects compared to fornax compact objects and are suggestive of the stripping scenario .",
    "these results together imply that both formation scenarios are possible , perhaps even likely , but that what occurs could be dependent on environmental factors such as local galaxy density .    to make progress on the question of the origin of compact stellar systems it is necessary to study clusters that bridge the mass gap between the systems like @xmath13cen and g1 , and dwarf galaxies in a variety of environments .",
    "being the central galaxy in a large group , ngc 5128 not only provides a less dense environment compared to the central regions of galaxy clusters , but evidence for recent merger activity in the form of the dust lane , faint shells @xcite , and a young tidal stream @xcite make it a likely environment for ymcs to be formed .",
    "ngc  5128 is also the nearest giant galaxy to the milky way beyond m31 and thus it is possible to get high resolution spectra and structural parameters of its large population of @xmath17 star clusters , many of which are at the upper end of the globular cluster mass distribution @xcite .",
    "all of these features make ngc 5128 an interesting target for such a study .",
    "the goal of this work is to study correlations between dynamical properties , such as dynamical masses and mass - to - light ratios , and basic evolutionary parameters , e.g.  relative ages , metallicities , and [ @xmath3/fe ] ratios .",
    "the ratio of @xmath3-capture to fe - peak elements [ @xmath3/fe ] ) can provide information on the star formation history ( sfh ) of stellar populations .",
    "super - solar [ @xmath3/fe ] is indicative of a short burst of sf , typical of gcs and elliptical galaxies , while sub - solar values mean a more quiescient or drawn out sfh .",
    "ages , metallicities , and [ @xmath3/fe ] ratios are usually estimated from integrated - light spectra by the measurement of absorption - line features that have been calibrated to the lick / ids index system @xcite and compared to models that assume simple stellar populations ( ssps ; see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "these parameters then provide useful clues to the evolutionary pasts of the objects .    in this work we measure dynamical masses of compact star clusters in ngc 5128 using a homogeneous analysis method based on the penalized pixel fitting ( ppxf ) code of @xcite .",
    "the results compare favourably with those of @xcite , who derive dynamical masses for 27 objects based on @xmath11 measured using a cross - correlation technique .",
    "these dynamical masses are then combined with photometric structural parameters to derive the fp relations and we compare them to those of objects ranging in mass from the smallest local group gcs to giant elliptical galaxies .",
    "chemical abundances from the literature for the ngc 5128 objects derived using the lick / ids system are used to investigate the ages and star formation histories .",
    "these properties , along with dynamical masses and mass - to - light ratios , are directly compared to those for early - type galaxies , ucds and local group gcs .",
    "the paper is organised as follows .",
    " 2 summarizes the data and observations .",
    "the measurement of @xmath11 is described in  3 as well as the calculations that lead directly to dynamical mass estimates ( @xmath18 ) and both photometric and dynamical mass - to - light ratios ( @xmath19 and @xmath20 ) .  ",
    "4 compares the ngc 5128 clusters to other compact stellar systems using a comparison of key structural parameters , a fundamental plane and @xmath21-space analysis as well as a comparison of stellar population properties .",
    "we conclude with a discussion of the main results in light of the various formation scenarios in  5 .",
    "high resolution spectra of gcs in ngc  5128 were obtained with the uves spectrograph at the 8.2 m very large telescope on cerro paranal in chile .",
    "uves is a two - arm , cross - dispersed echelle spectrograph operating at the nasmyth b focus of ut2 ( kueyen ) .",
    "the two arms of uves cover the wavelength ranges 32504500   and 47006800   for the blue and red arms respectively .",
    "the spectrograph was set to its dichroic # 1 mode for the observations taken in program 69.d-0094 in order to obtain spectra on both arms simultaneously , whereas the spectra obtained in program 69.d-0169 were taken with the red arm only . with the 1  slit used for all observations , uves",
    "provides a spectral resolution of @xmath22 , corresponding to a velocity resolution fwhm of 7.5 km s@xmath10 ( @xmath23 km s@xmath10 ) .",
    "for further details of the uves operating specifications we refer to @xcite .",
    "pipeline - reduced high - resolution spectra for 23 globular clusters were obtained from the eso / uves archive and are summarized in table  [ tab : gcobs ] , which lists cluster identifications according to @xcite ( old ) along with the newer , homogeneous identifiers of @xcite ( new ) , the total integration times , apparent @xmath24-band magnitudes , and the average s / n over the wavelength ranges used .",
    "the total integration times listed are sums of three or four individual sub - exposures taken during the observations .",
    "the apparent @xmath24 magnitudes listed are taken from the @xcite catalogue where available ; otherwise , the magnitudes are from the original discovery publications .",
    "the airmass was in the range 1.0541.986 for all cluster observations and the seeing ranged from 0.52to 1.35 .",
    "all template stars were observed with the same instrumental setup as the clusters , but with only single exposures of a few seconds each .",
    "the template stars cover a spectral range of g0m0.5 and luminosity classes iab , ib , iia , ii , and iii as listed in table  [ tab : stars ] .",
    "the seeing and airmass during the collection of the template spectra were comparable to the cluster observations .",
    "all template stars were observed around april 2002 in two separate observing programs with some overlap in their target lists .  to increase the s / n , any of the template stars for which multiple observations were made were summed together .",
    "because of the heliocentric @xmath25 corrections applied to the spectra prior to their combination a systematic uncertainty of not more than @xmath26 km s@xmath10 is introduced to the final velocity dispersion measurement .",
    "this is added in quadrature to the total error budget resulting from the ppxf analysis ( see sect .  [",
    "ln : losvd ] ) using the corresponding template star .",
    "the basic data reduction was done by the eso - uves pipeline , which provided flux- and wavelength - calibrated , de - biased spectra that were further processed using a combination of iraf tasks and idl programs .",
    "the signal - to - noise ratios ( s / n ) per pixel for all of the clusters and template stars were measured over the wavelength ranges described in  2 using the _ splot _ task in iraf and are listed in tables  [ tab : gcobs ] and [ tab : stars ] .",
    "the s / n over the redl(@xmath648005750 ) and redu(@xmath658006800 ) regions of the spectra were high enough to perform the convolutions for the subsequent velocity dispersion analysis .",
    "it was found that the s / n over the blue arm ( @xmath633004500 ) was too low for accurate @xmath27 measurements with errors well above the expected velocity dispersion of our target clusters .",
    "for this reason the @xmath11 values measured from the blue ccd are dropped from the subsequent analysis .",
    "we use the penalized pixel - fitting code ( ppxf ) described in detail in @xcite to measure the line - of - sight velocity dispersion ( losvd ) , @xmath11 , of our target gcs . in summary , ppxf expands the losvd as a gauss - hermite series of the form @xmath28\\ ] ] where @xmath29 and @xmath30 is the @xmath31-th hermite polynomial .",
    "ppxf then makes use of an input ` initial guess ' for the relative radial velocity , @xmath25 , of the template star as well as an estimated @xmath11 for the cluster in order to calculate the best fitting @xmath25 , @xmath11 and the gauss - hermite moments @xmath32 for the best fitting losvd .",
    "the code uses a penalty function that is derived from the integrated square deviation of the line profile from the best - fitting gaussian .",
    "the fit is iterated until the perturbed penalty function can not decrease the variance of the fit any further .",
    "this key feature of ppxf serves to bias the solution towards a gaussian shape when the s / n is low but allows the solution to reproduce the higher - order details of spectral features when the s / n is high .",
    "features of note , that are implemented in the ppxf routine , include fitting of an optimal template together with the kinematics to minimize the impact of template mismatches as well as an iterative sigma clipping routine that acts to clean the spectra of any residual bad pixels or cosmic rays ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for details ) .",
    "in order to maximize the accuracy of the losvd measurements the wavelength range of the object spectra was constrained to @xmath6500600 sections around prominent features .",
    "extensive experimentation showed that the wavelength regions which provided the most robust results from the redl and redu ccds were 49515550 containing the mg__b _ _ triplet and several fe features , and 58506400 , containing the nad doublet and two tio molecular bands .",
    "figure  [ fig : spec ] shows a representative sample of our cluster spectra constrained to these regions for both redl and redu ranging from the lowest s / n spectra at the top to the highest s / n at the bottom .",
    "the spectra were left with enough continuum for ppxf to perform the convolutions up to @xmath33 km s@xmath10 .    in order to minimize the input scatter , one of the parameters required by ppxf , @xmath25 ,",
    "was measured using the _ fxcor _ task in iraf for all of the clusters against each of the template stars .",
    "the averaged results , which are in good agreement with those in the literature ( e.g * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , are listed in table  [ tbl : sigcomp ] along with the standard errors .",
    "the measured @xmath25 from _ fxcor _ was obtained with welch filtering using cut - on and cut - off wavenumbers of 0 and 500 , respectively , in the constrained regions .",
    "adjusting the filtering parameters can produce small variations in the measured @xmath25 , which might add to uncertainties in the final @xmath11 . to test this ,",
    "ppxf was used to measure @xmath11 with the input @xmath11 held constant as the input @xmath25 was varied for each cluster against the templates .",
    "the results of this test showed that the scatter in the measured @xmath11 values was no more than 1 km s@xmath10 , indicating that ppxf is relatively insensitive to variations in @xmath25 assuming that the input @xmath25 is a ` good ' guess within a few tens of km s@xmath10 .",
    "therefore , any uncertainty in measuring the ` initial guess ' @xmath25 with _ fxcor _ should not translate into larger uncertainties of the final @xmath11 measurement .",
    "the ppxf code does indicate a sensitivity to very high or low input estimates for @xmath11 , so before any @xmath11 measurements were made , the input @xmath11 was varied between 550 km s@xmath10 in steps of 5 km s@xmath10 while @xmath25 was held constant at the measured values .",
    "this range was selected because the typical @xmath11 of massive clusters in the local group is of the order of @xmath34 km s@xmath10 @xcite .",
    "for this reason , all of the input @xmath11 estimates are ` good ' guesses , and account for any under- or over - estimates of the cluster velocity dispersions .",
    "the resulting measurements from all template star - gc combinations were @xmath35 clipped to within one standard deviation based on measurements from all 21 templates , which includes any @xmath25 uncertainties from _ fxcor _ , the stellar template library , and systematic uncertainties intrinsic to the ppxf code due to template mismatches .",
    "for each cluster , the mean of the clipped @xmath11 was calculated and recorded for both redu and redl spectral regions .",
    "the errors were taken as one standard deviation of the mean - clipped @xmath11 measurements .",
    "due to the strength and distinctiveness of the mg__b _ _ triplet in the redl spectral range compared to the many , but less distinct , features in the redu range ( 58506400  ) , the measured @xmath11 has much more robust results from the redl ccd than from the redu ccd .",
    "figure  [ fig : sigs ] ( top and lower right panels ) shows a comparison of the @xmath11 measurement from both ccds combined against those from only the redl or redu ccd , and against each other .",
    "the plots indicate that almost all of the results from both ccds fall within errors from either of the single ccds , thus justifying the use of the weighted mean from both ccds , as listed in table  [ tab : ds ] . as as check against the possibility of interstellar absorption affecting the @xmath11 measurements around the nad regions of the redu spectra",
    ", measurements were made for the representative spectra shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : spec ] as well as the outlier gc0382 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : sigs ] both with and without these features .",
    "the results suggest a negligible effect for low s / n spectra ; however , for higher s / n , @xmath11 could be over - estimated by @xmath36 km s@xmath10 , indicating that the larger error bars for the redu measurements could be at least in part due to interstellar absorption .",
    "the range of @xmath11 measured from our sample was @xmath37 km s@xmath10 with the former measured for gc0217 and the latter for gc0330 .",
    "figure  [ fig : sigs ] ( lower left panel ) shows the ppxf results against the @xmath11 recorded by @xcite , which were obtained using a cross - correlation technique and whose measurements were shown to agree well with those of @xcite .",
    "the measurements agree very well for 21 out of the 23 clusters , although we measure significantly higher @xmath11 for the two clusters gc0330 and particularly gc0382 .",
    "@xcite reported @xmath11=4.9 km s@xmath10 for gc0382 , but this was based on a ccf with multiple peaks due to additional absorption features in the spectrum .",
    "they suggest that these abnormalities could be due to spatially unresolved galactic foreground stars .",
    "while we do not offer an explanation for this discrepancy , considering the restricted spectral ranges described above and the fact that ppxf has a certain amount of robustness against features such as these , we tend to prefer our measurements over previous determinations from the literature , but bear in mind the significant confusion regarding this object .      structural parameters , such as projected core - radius , @xmath38 , the king concentration parameter , c , and the projected half - light radius , r@xmath39 , are important for aperture corrections to our losvd measurements and are listed in table  [ tab : ds ] . for",

    "the central velocity dispersion , @xmath43 , plays a pivotal role in dynamical mass estimates .",
    "however , losvd measurements in the literature are often performed at various radii depending on the instrumental setup and target sample of the particular study . because of varying seeing conditions , target distances , and variations in the instrumental specifications , such as spectral and spatial resolution and sampling , the light entering a given aperture may not be representative of the object being observed as a whole and thus the true central velocity dispersion is often inaccessible and must be extrapolated using assumptions on stellar orbit distributions .",
    "@xcite show that aperture corrections for objects in the mass range of massive gcs or ucds can be significant , and so appropriate corrections were applied to the ngc 5128 objects .",
    "the aperture corrections applied to our data were performed using the code discussed in detail in @xcite and @xcite , which uses the basic cluster structural parameters that define the shape of the cluster light profile ( i.e.  r@xmath44 and @xmath45 , see table  [ tab : ds ] ) . to create a 3-dimensional stellar density profile ,",
    "a king surface density profile is assumed , from which the cumulated mass function m(@xmath46 ) , potential energy @xmath47 , and energy distribution function @xmath48(e ) are computed . the 3-d profile and @xmath48(e )",
    "are then used to create an n - body representation of the cluster ; in our case , @xmath49 particles were simulated for each cluster .",
    "each particle is then convolved with a gaussian corresponding to the seeing during the observations . a light profile",
    "is then generated and used to calculate the velocity dispersion at a given radius or within a given aperture .    to estimate the uncertainties of the inferred central velocity dispersions , each of the clusters were modeled three times .",
    "firstly , the code was run using @xmath50 , @xmath45 , and @xmath51 from table  [ tab : ds ] to get @xmath43 .",
    "maximum and minimum values for @xmath51 , @xmath50 and @xmath45 were calculated by adding or subtracting the errors listed in table  [ tab : ds ] which were used to determine the upper and lower uncertainties for @xmath43 by re - modelling the clusters using @xmath52 , @xmath53 and @xmath54 ( for @xmath55 ) and @xmath56 , @xmath57 and @xmath58 ( for @xmath59 ) .",

    "first they model the objects as des , fitting a srsic model to the surface brightness profile for @xmath65 , then as de , ns by fitting a plummer model to the surface brightness profile within @xmath66 .  while their profile fitting method is not completely consistent with ours , we use their measurements to distinguish , at least , between the core and envelope parameters of nucleated dwarf ellipticals .  in the following we break their @xmath11 measurements into three groups : one non - nucleated de , five de , ns ( core plus envelope ) , and only the cores of the same five de , ns . @xcite",

    "he suggests that a general formation scheme can be considered in light of a mass break - point of a few @xmath203 ; below this mass limit clusters can be considered to be `` single - collapse '' globular clusters ( scgcs ) , while above it the formation physics predict `` multiple - collapse '' globular clusters ( mcgcs ) . in the case of scgcs , the present day objects would be expected to host a ssp comprised of stars sharing both the same age and metallicity , i.e.  ` classical ' gcs , while for mcgcs , the timescales of formation can vary from myr to gyr , thus , allowing for chemically distinct multiple stellar generations with a range of ages .",
    "if the most massive gcs form within the most massive giant molecular clouds ( gmcs ) , and the most massive gmcs form in / around the most massive galaxies ( from purely statistical arguments ) , then it naturally follows that the most massive clusters would be found preferentially near massive galaxies such as ngc  5128 , or near the central galaxies in clusters like fornax and virgo .  if multiple scgcs are formed through the fragmentation of a massive gmc , then a mcgc would form through the merging of the scgcs on a timescale of @xmath204 myr .",
    "a mcgc formed through this channel would result in a single - aged stellar population , probably with similar metallicities @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , if a timescale of gyr is invoked , the idea of stripped de , ns could be explained if the nuclear clusters are formed through gradual merging of ` classical ' gcs , or if there are periods of star formation triggered by gas being funneled to the centre of a gas - rich galaxy .",
    "regardless of what mechanism allowed the massive clusters to grow , the evolution over a hubble time in the tidal field of a @xmath205 potential well can result in objects with structural properties similar to ucds .",

    "interestingly , the three most metal - rich clusters have super - solar [ @xmath3/fe ] and slightly younger ages than the others , suggestive of shorter sfhs .",
    "these features are consistent with a monolithic , fractional collapse and subsequent merging of massive gmcs . on all counts , the least massive clusters of our gc sample show similarities to the ` classical ' gcs in the local group and should probably be considered as such .",

    "@xcite refers to ucds as a `` mixed bag of objects '' , but in light of this study the expression may be even better suited to our sample of objects .",
    "the lowest - mass clusters in our sample represent the ` classical ' gcs of the local group in every aspect , without requiring dark matter or any combination of strange imf , composite stellar populations or galactic interaction to explain their observed parameters .",
    "thus , we consider them to be typical single - collapse gcs .",
    "the objects falling above @xmath210 confirm the mass break reported by @xcite in that their high mass - to - light ratios begin to require non - baryonic components .",
    "most of these objects share metallicities similar to those of the de , n cores ; combined with the ages and [ @xmath3/fe ] ratios , these objects support the notion that they are the present - day remnants of de , ns that have been stripped of their envelopes .",
    "three of our ngc 5128 objects indicate short sfhs by having super - solar [ @xmath3/fe ] ratios ; combined with slightly lower ages compared to the other objects , thus is suggestive of the merging of single - collapse gcs , that possibly formed from a fragmented massive gmc .",
    "altogether , our results are consistent with the interpretation of @xcite  single vs.  multiple - collapse formation  as well as formation by the tidal stripping of de , ns in massive potential wells @xcite .",
    "more observations of transitional objects such as these in galaxy clusters and massive galaxies like ngc 5128 will hopefully serve to further constrain the formation mechanisms , and advance our understanding of the evolutionary processes of massive , compact spheroidal systems .",

    "<S> it is found that the properties of these massive stellar systems match those of nuclear clusters in dwarf elliptical galaxies and ucds better than those of local group gcs , and that all objects share similarly old ( @xmath0 gyr ) ages , suggesting a possible link between the formation and evolution of de , ns , ucds and massive gcs .  </S>",
    "<S> we find a very steep correlation between dynamical mass - to - light ratio and dynamical mass of the form @xmath1 above @xmath2 .  </S>",
    "<S> formation scenarios are investigated with a chemical abundance analysis using absorption line strengths calibrated to the lick / ids index system .  </S>",
    "<S> the results lend support to two scenarios contained within a single general formation scheme .  </S>",
    "<S> old , massive , super - solar [ @xmath3/fe ] systems are formed on short ( @xmath4 myr ) timescales through the merging of single - collapse gcs which themselves are formed within single , giant molecular clouds .  more intermediate- and old - aged ( @xmath5 gyr ) , solar- to sub - solar [ @xmath3/fe ] systems are formed on much longer ( @xmath6gyr ) timescales through the stripping of de , ns in the @xmath7 potential wells of massive galaxies and galaxy clusters . </S>"
