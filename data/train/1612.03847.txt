    "one hundred and seventy years ago , stokes pointed out that waves described by nonlinear models can be periodic @xcite .",

    "the new terms will then be of second order .",

    "this second order equation was called by marchant and smyth @xcite the _ extended kdv_. it was also derived in a different way in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we call it * kdv2*. it is not integrable .",
    "however , by keeping the same terms but changing one numerical coefficient we can obtain an integrable equation @xcite .",
    "not only is kdv2 non integrable , it only seems to have one conservation law ( volume or mass ) @xcite .",
    "a simple derivation of adiabatically conserved quantities can be found in @xcite .",
    "we look for periodic nonlinear wave solutions of kdv2 ( [ kdv2 ] ) .",
    "introduce @xmath9 .",
