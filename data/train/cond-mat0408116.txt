    "the transport mechanism and in turn the cause of resistance is of fundamental importance . various model , especially for thin films ,",

    ", ( ii ) from film surface and ( iii ) due to grain boundaries which would be predominant in polycrystalline films@xcite .",
    "different models exist to explain the dependence of resistance on film thickness . in the case of scattering from the film surface",
    "the variation from film resistivity with film thickness was given by the fuchs- sondheimer ( f - s ) relationship@xcite @xmath1 \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath2 is the mean free path , d is the film thickness and @xmath3 the resistivity of the bulk sample .",
    "the constant p indicates the fraction of electrons being reflected from the surface .",
    "the value indicates the scattering mechanism , for example p=1 indicates specular reflection .",
    "a similar relationship was established by mayadas and shatzkes ( m - s ) @xcite to explain the scattering from grain boundaries , with a very similar functional dependence with film thickness .",
    "however , the model is limited to very thin films with an added restriction that the grain size are of the order of film thickness .",
    "the grain boundary is defined as region between two grains where crystal orientation changes .",
    "the transport properties of @xmath0 films like resistivity , hall coefficient , mobility and seeback coefficient have been extensively studied @xcite , and reports in literature indicate films to be p - type with narrow band gap .",
    "however , all these reports are silent on the mechanism of scattering and in turn the source of resistivity . only damodara das et al @xcite",
    "have reported resistivity as a function of thickness @xmath4 .",
    "the article states average grain size to be of the order of film thickness and indicates the scattering mechanism to be that of grain boundary scattering in accordance to the m - s model .",
    "however , no report exists on the variation of resistance or resistivity of @xmath0 films with grain size in thicker films .",
    "this article investigates variation of resistance in films whose thickness is enough to assume that the variation in resistivity is independent of defects and specular scattering .",
    "films of @xmath0 were grown on glass substrates kept at room temperature , using thermal evaporation method .",
    "@xmath0 ingot of high purity ( 99.99% ) supplied by aldrich ( usa ) were used as the starting material .",
    "the crushed ingot were evaporated from molybdenum boat at a vacuum better than @xmath5torr .",
    "the film thickness was measured using dektek iia surface profiler .",
    "the movement of the mechanical stylus across the edge of the film determines the step height or the films thickness .",
    "indium contacts were grown on the glass substrates before they were placed in the chamber , such that a strip of @xmath0 film of dimensions @xmath6 could be fabricated on these contacts using a mask .",
    "the i - v characteristics of the films were measured by four probe method .",
    "it was found to be linear between 25mv-24v , showing the ohmic nature of indium contacts as well as the polycrystalline film for applied field .",
    "the films resistance were measured by an high input impedance digital multimeter . the structural and compositional analysis of these films",
    "were done using phillips pw1840 x - ray diffractometer and shimadzu esca750 ( electron spectroscopy for chemical analysis ) .",
    "the films were found to be stoichiometrically uniform over the area 5 cm x 5 cm as determined by esca carried out in various regions of the film .",
    "the morphological analysis was done with joel 840 scanning electron microscope ( sem ) .",
    "the as grown films showed tendency of ageing @xcite , where the resistance of the film varied with time and saturated to a constant value in couple of weeks .",
    "the results presented in this article are of films which had achieved such saturation .",
    "the average grain size was determined from both sem micrographs and x - ray diffractograms .",
    "the grain size was calculated using the full width at half maxima ( fwhm ) of x - ray peaks @xcite .",
    "the results of grain size found by both methods were in agreement .",
    "a plot between the film thickness and grain size shows no trend ( fig 1 ) .",
    "this variation in grain size with film thickness may be a result of not having perfectly identical conditions during film evaporation .",
    "it also represents the randomness of the growth process .",
    "this shows that the average grain size is not proportional to the film thickness and resistance or resistivity will have to be studied both as a function of thickness and grain size to resolve the main contributor in scattering mechanism .",
    "the f - s theory shows that the contributions from the surface leads to an inverse proportionality with thickness ( equation 1 ) , where the model is restricted to cases where the charge carriers mean free path is of the order of the film thickness @xmath7 .",
    "however , since the samples in our study have thickness between 130 - 500 nm , the film thickness is far greater then the mean free path . beyond this limit",
    "one can assume the films resistivity to be same as that of the bulk , showing no further change with increasing film thickness .",
    "thus , film s resistance in this limit should only fall inversely with thickness .",
    "figure 2 shows the resistance of aged @xmath0 films falling linearly with increasing thickness .",
    "it can be understood trivially , that for the resistance of the film to vary linearly with thickness as shown in figure 2 , the resistivity would have to show a parabolic relationship with film thickness .",
    "another important contributor to resistance is the grain boundary .",
    "however , that too requires an inverse proportionality with thickness .",
    "this lack of trend may be due to the assumption in m - s theory that the grain size is proportional to the film thickness , which is not the case here .",
    "it is clear that in the present study the surface scattering and grain boundary scattering do not contribute to the film resistance .",
    "hence , to investigate the influence of the grain size on transport properties , variation of resistance with grain size was studied .",
    "figure 3 shows the variation of film resistance with grain size .",
    "as stated earlier the average grain size was determined from both sem micrographs and x - ray diffractograms .",
    "the grain boundary is defined as region between two grains where crystal orientation changes .",
    "the representative micrographs of @xmath0 in figure 4 however , show large distances between two grains .",
    "the grains tend to have the resistivity of the bulk , however , even if there is an inter - connectivity between two neighbouring grains this region will have high resistivity by purely geometry of narrowing @xcite . these voids , hence would definitely contribute differently from the defined grain boundary in m - s theory .",
    "volger s model @xcite assumes the film to be made up of cubical grains of edge size a arranged in an ordered manner , as shown in fig .",
    "5a , with equal spacing between the neighbouring grains .",
    "the inter - grain distances are different along x , y and z directions and are same along any one direction .",
    "consider the film has q number of grains arranged regularly at equal inter- grain spacing @xmath8 along the length l and r and p grains arranged along the width and thickness of the film . also , the resistance is measured along the length of the film by taking the contacts across the cross - section in the yz plane , then the points a - b , c - d etc . shown in fig .",
    "5a are at equal potential",
    ". the equivalent dc circuit of this arrangement of measurement would be as shown in figure 5b , where @xmath9 represents the high resistance of the inter - grain voids @xcite . as can be seen in figure 5b ,",
    "the whole film can be considered to be a parallel combination of pr resistive elements , where resistance of each element is given by @xcite @xmath10 thus , the net resistance along the length of the film between the two contacts would be given as @xmath11    seto @xcite made a similar simplification step by assuming the problem to be that of one dimension .",
    "@xmath9 , the high resistance of the inter - grain voids , is a function of @xmath8 which in turn would depend on the mechanism by which charge carriers would cross the inter - grain boundary .",
    "many suggestions have been made for explaining the cross over , such as ohmic conduction , tunnelling or thermionic emission @xcite .",
    "it may also be a combination of these , depending on the actual inter - grain distances .",
    "the resistance of such a film , assuming ohmic conduction in between grains is given as @xcite @xmath12 where @xmath13 is a proportionality constant , given as @xmath14 in true sense @xmath13 is not a constant since @xmath15 will depend on the grain size , as also film dimensions , including it s thickness .",
    "however , @xmath15 is assumed to be a slow varying function of film thickness , or constant .",
    "the constant k represents a ratio of the inter - grain region s resistivity to the grain s resistivity .",
    "since the void resistivity is large , k obviously is a very large entity .",
    "the variable is a ratio of the inter - grain length and the grain edge or @xmath16 where a is the grain size , assuming as in volger s model , the grains to be cubic in nature .",
    "the inter - grain distance , @xmath8 is extent of void in x direction ( along length of the film strip ) , since the resistance is measured along the length of the film .",
    "the inter - grain distance varies as a function of the grain size depending the mechanism of grain growth . since , the @xmath0 films aged to a hexagonal crystal state , with @xmath17 , it should show easier grain growth along the length and width as compared with that along restrictive film thickness .",
    "the films hence aged with the c - axis aligned normal to the substrate plane @xcite . as per volger s model",
    "q , the grain number along the length , would be decreasing more rapidly than p , that along the film s thickness , leading to a general trend of decrease in resistance .",
    "thus , the variation of inter - grain distance with grain size for the films in consideration would be given as @xcite @xmath18 where @xmath19 .",
    "thus , it can be seen that the variable , is a function of the grain size , a. the increase in void size with increasing grain size can be appreciated from the representative sem micrographs .",
    "equation 2 , is physically valid for positive values , which requires @xmath20    considering a extreme case of @xmath21 along with the stated assumption that @xmath22 is constant , then equation 2 maybe written as @xmath23 the variable x required for equation ( 1 ) can then be expressed as @xmath24    this increase in inter - grain distance with growing grain size was discussed in our earlier work @xcite .",
    "hence , using equation ( 3 ) the films resistance given by equation ( 1 ) , can be expressed as @xmath25 equation ( 4 ) fits quite well to the experimental observations as shown by the solid line in figure 4 .",
    "the values of the constants evaluated by fitting are @xmath13 = 2308 @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 . as stated earlier , the constant k is a ratio of the high resistivity of the inter - grain region as to the low resistivity of the grains .",
    "the numerical value shows the resistivity of the inter - grain region will be nearly @xmath29 times that of the low resistivity region , which is consistent with the with the assumption that inter - grain region can be assumed to be a path of high resistance .",
    "the voids between neighbouring grains would present itself as a barrier which the charge carriers would have to transverse to establish current flow .",
    "the magnitude of the barrier height can be computed from the slope of the plot between @xmath30 and temperature inverse ( 1/t in kelvin ) .",
    "the barrier height was calculated using this method for various film thickness .",
    "the variation is shown in figure 6 .",
    "the variation in barrier height with film thickness maybe due to one or a cumulative effect of the following ( i ) variation in the grain size of the polycrystalline film , ( ii ) a large density of dislocations , ( iii ) quantum size effects and ( iv ) change in film stoichiometry . since the film thickness of this study is large the quantum size effect",
    "is immediately ruled out .",
    "careful growth technique followed by ageing would minimise the contribution due to dislocation and off stoichiometric compositions , however , can not be completely ruled out .",
    "the major contribution hence would be due to the size of the grains .",
    "slater @xcite estimated the barrier height as a function of grain size by modelling grain boundary as a pn type of structure . the variation is given as @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the doping concentration , n the carrier concentration , k the dielectric constant of the material .",
    "the barrier height increases with grain size for @xmath33 , which would be the case in pure samples @xmath34 .",
    "a fit for the experimental data using equation 3 , which states that the barrier width in proportional to the square of the grain size , along with the estimated proportionality constant ( b ) and equation 5 is shown by the continuous line in figure 6 .",
    "the fit shows reasonable agreement , however it does indicate possible contributions from dislocations etc .",
    "the values of the coefficients of equation 5 are @xmath35=5.66mev , @xmath36 = 90 and @xmath37 .",
    "the ratio of @xmath36 may appear to be very small , however , it should be noted that the curve fitting was done using the earlier estimated proportionality constant ( @xmath38 ) .",
    "thus , the influence of the inter - grain voids and grain size on the magnitude of barrier height and various characterising parameters of the film is evident .",
    "this though expected is different from an earlier study by rajagopalan et al @xcite on films of @xmath0 with thickness between 160 nm and 800 nm which reported that the barrier height was independent of the film thickness . in the next section we investigate the role of the inter - grain voids on another parameter used to characterise the transport properties of a material .",
    "the resistance of the film is a function of temperature .",
    "the variation of resistance with temperature in general is expressed as @xmath39 thus the temperature coefficient of resistance or tcr @xcite is given as @xmath40 while tcr is positive for metals , it is negative in case of semiconductors . the f - s model for very thin films states",
    "that the variation of tcr with film thickness follows an identical form as expressed by equation ( 1 )",
    ". however , there seems to be no model in the literature to explain the variation of tcr with either film thickness or grain size for films with thickness greater then the mean free path of their charge carriers .",
    "a plot between tcr and grain size seems scattered ( not shown ) .",
    "however , the plot between tcr and barrier height is a straight line , figure 7 , with slope @xmath41 and intercept @xmath42 .",
    "it immediately follows from the linearity between tcr and @xmath43 along with equation ( 5 ) that the tcr would be a polynomial function of the grain size .",
    "this explains the seemingly scattered data points of tcr with grain size as discussed .",
    "it also explains the lack of any model or theory on the variation of tcr with grain size .",
    "the relationship shows that with increasing barrier height , the rate of change of resistance with temperature ( dr / dt or tcr , equation 6 ) becomes increasingly smaller .",
    "the negative temperature coefficient of resistance in semiconductors is a result of increasing charge carriers due to breaking covalent bonds .",
    "an increased barrier height implies its more difficult for the charge carriers to escape into the voids from the grains , confining the increased number of carriers inside the grain itself .",
    "this rapidly brings down the resistance of the grain contributing to a negative tcr proportional to the barrier height .",
    "the dc transport properties of @xmath0 films with thickness between 130 - 500 nm have been discussed .",
    "the properties showed no size effects as was expected , since the film thickness was far greater then the charge carriers mean free path .",
    "the films resistance , the barrier height and temperature coefficient of resistance ( tcr ) showed a strong dependence on both the grain size and inter- grain void .",
    "the inter - grain void was approximated to vary with increasing grain size , enabling to study the above properties of the films as a function of grain size ."
