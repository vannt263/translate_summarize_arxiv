    "in 1993 , a huge mass - loss event was detected in the central star of the planetary nebula lmc - n66 ( also smp 83 and ws 35 ) .",
    "the star developed features of a wolf - rayet star ( wr ) of the n - sequence and its brightness increased by a large factor while the nebular characteristics remained unchanged ( pea et al .",
    "1994 ; pea et al .",
    "the event was monitored at uv and optical wavelengths .",
    "the mass - loss gradually decreased and the star returned to its quiet state in about 6 years .",
    "a detailed analysis of the stellar evolution , using advanced non - lte models for expanding atmospheres fitting the uv and optical data across these epochs , was performed by hamann et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , who showed that the stellar luminosity increased from log ( @xmath1)=4.6 at the end of 1990 ( quiescence ) to 5.4 in 1994 and then returned gradually to the initial value . in the same period",
    "the mass - loss rate increased ( quiescence ) 10@xmath2 m@xmath3 yr@xmath4 to 10@xmath5 m@xmath3 yr@xmath4 at maximum , while the stellar temperature remained constant during the whole event ( t@xmath6 = 112 @xmath7 20 kk ) .",
    "the chemical composition of the ejecta corresponded to that of an incompletely cno - processed material : dominated by helium ( x@xmath8= 0.8 ) with a small amount of hydrogen ( x@xmath9=0.2 ) , nitrogen slightly enhanced ( x@xmath10=3 e-03 ) and carbon very depleted ( x@xmath11 1 e-04 ) .",
    "several possible scenarios for the nature of lmc - n66 ( single massive star , post - agb star , high - mass binary system with mass transfer , or white dwarf accreting mass ) are discussed by hamann et al .",
    "although none of the scenarios are completely satisfactory , it is suggested that the most probable ones are those involving an evolved binary system . in particular , lmc - n66 could be a white dwarf accreting matter at a high rate in a close binary .",
    "the large accretion may bring the stellar mass to the chandrasekhar limit within a few hundred thousand years , making it a candidate for a type ia supernova precursor .",
    "due to its extraordinary characteristics we have kept monitoring this object at irregular intervals over the years .",
    "the last spectrum obtained that showed no outburst was taken in january 28 , 2006 .",
    "fifteen months later , on april 26 , 2007 , a new outburst was discovered .",
    "once the outburst was detected , a follow - up program was started right away , thanks to a director discretionary time ( ddt ) program , with emmi and the ntt at european southern observatory ( eso ) .",
    "concurrently we obtained ddt with the fuse satellite . in this section",
    "we describe these observations .",
    "a spectrum obtained with the eso vlt and fors1 spectrograph in january 28 , 2006 shows the star in quiescence , presenting a faint continuum and faint 4686 wide component .",
    "the outburst was discovered in april 26 , 2007 with an optical spectrum of n66 obtained at las campanas using the dupont telescope equipped with the b&c spectrograph .",
    "right after the discovery , eso ddt was granted through program i d 279.d-5024 .",
    "the eso - ntt + emmi spectrograph with a combination of gratings has been used to gather spectroscopic data in the 3250@xmath08000   wavelength range .",
    "spectra were obtained on july 22 , august 14 , august 30 , september 14 , and october 22 , 2007 .",
    "the exposure times were of 20 min in the blue and 10 min in the red .",
    "the spectrum in august 30 , 2007 is shown in fig .",
    "1 together with the data obtained on january 28 , 2006 ( quiescence ) and a spectrum of august 2 , 1994 ( maximum of previous outburst ) .",
    "some stellar characteristics , derived from these spectra , are presented in table  1 .",
    "it is evident that during outbursts the star increases its brightness and develops wide and prominent wn features ( mainly , and lines ) .",
    "for the two observed outbursts the spectra are very similar presenting the same wn features ; although the stellar magnitude in 2007 , as measured from the continuum flux at 5450  , is brighter than in 1994 for 0.5 mag and about 2.2 mag brighter than in quiescence .",
    "notice that due to the differences in slit widths , the flux listed for 1994 and 2006 correspond to the whole stellar flux , while in the 2007 observation some of the emission could have been lost due to seeing conditions .",
    "the mass - loss rate listed in table  1 for 1994 was taken from hamann et al .",
    "( 2003 ) and for 2006 we adopted the quiescent value derived by hamann et al . ;",
    "alternatively , for 2007 we estimated @xmath12 by scaling the value of 1994 , taking into account that f ( 4686 ) is 1.7 times more intense in 2007 and that @xmath13 .    in 2007",
    "the stellar continuum is brighter and also the wr emission lines are more intense , which could be understood in terms of a higher mass - loss rate . on the other hand ,",
    "the wr features present very similar fwhms in both outbursts , indicating similar wind velocities .",
    "there are other small differences between outbursts , for instance the 3484    is stronger in 2007 than in 1994 , and the 5808 doublet is more prominent , relative to 5411   and 5876  , as can be observed in fig . 2 where we present the 5300@xmath0 6000   zone normalized to the continuum .",
    "it is known that the stellar spectrum of lmc - n66 undergoes small variations in short time scales ( of about a month ) , therefore it seems likely that the observed differences in the spectra between 2007 and 1994 could be due to short time variations of the wind parameters and do not necessarily reflect differences in chemical composition or other important parameters .",

    "fuse ddt was granted through the program i d z018 . the observations covered the wavelength range 905@xmath01187  , at a spectral resolution of r @xmath18 20,000 .",
    "originally an exposure time of 27000 s was approved , but unfortunately the termination of the fuse science mission on august 2007 made it impossible to complete the full exposure .",
    "only two observations ( i d z0180101000 of 8235 s and z0180101000 of 5783 s ) were acquired on july 2007 .",
    "nevertheless the stellar brightness was sufficient to obtain data with significant signal - to - noise .",
    "the fuse lwrs ( @xmath19 ) aperture was used .",
    "the data , taken in `` tag time '' mode , were calibrated using the fuse data reduction pipeline .    a combination of the signal obtained through the four channels ( lif1 , lif2 , sic1 , sic2 ) of the two detectors ( a & b ) is presented in fig .",
    "3 . this spectrum was smoothed to reduce the spectral resolution to 0.2  .",
    "wide emission lines from the central star are clearly appreciated .",
    "the most prominent lines correspond to , , , and . according to willis et al .",
    "( 2004 ) these features correspond to a high excitation wn ( see their figures 2a and 2b and their  4.2 ) . the most important stellar lines and their characteristics are listed in table 2 .",
    "previous fuse data for lmc - n66 central star were published by herald & bianchi ( 2007 ) . in comparison with their spectrum , obtained in 2003 at quiescent state ( see their fig .",
    "1 ) , our 2007 spectrum shows a continuum 5 times more intense and well developed wr lines .",
    "in addition to the wide stellar lines , narrow emission lines from the lyman series are conspicuous .",
    "these lines correspond to the airglow , but some nebular lines like 977  , 1032 , 1038   and 1086   are observed .",
    "narrow absorptions displaced 1   to the red from the lyman airglow lines are produced by interstellar absorption in the lmc ( 1   corresponds to the radial velocity of 300 km s@xmath4 measured for lmc - n66 by pea et al .",
    "by comparing the characteristics of the far uv stellar lines with those of the fuse spectra for massive wr stars published by willis et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , we find that the spectral classification for the central star of lmc - n66 corresponds to an early wn , probably a wn3 . in the previous outburst , and based on optical spectra only , we classified it as a wn4.5 .",
    "certainly this object is not a classical wr star as it is much less luminous , it presents outbursts difficult to understand , and in addition , its spectrum shows short - time variability that yields a slightly different spectral classification . for 2007 ,",
    "the optical spectrum shows and lines , so the wn4.5 classification is still valid .",
    "but , as said , the spectral classification for this object is not as direct as in the case of massive wrs due to its peculiarities .",
    "undoubtedly the central star of lmc - n66 is undergoing a new huge mass - loss event only 13 years after the previous episode . in this event",
    ", the star appears about 0.5 mag brighter than in the previous one and shows more intense wr features .",
    "a period as short as 13 yr for a new outburst was not expected .",
    "although the star was reported by nail & shapley ( 1955 ) as a variable ( hv5967 ) with @xmath20m@xmath180.9 mag , subsequent variations were not reported for more than 30 years , although this object was observed at least in 1975 , 1976 , 1983 , 1985 , 1988 , 1989 and 1990 by different authors ( e.g. , dopita et al .",
    "1985 ; monk et al . 1988 ; pea & ruiz 1988 ; meatheringham & dopita 1991 ; dopita et al .",
    "none of these observations were made in a year corresponding to a probable maximum in an apparent 13-yr period ( going back in time , the years for a maximum would have been 1981 , 1968 , 1955 ) . but taking into account that the 1994 outburst declined slowly and that the star was a couple of magnitudes brighter than in quiescence and the stellar lines were prominent for a few years after maximum , such features would have been detected had they been present in other epochs . therefore there is no evidence for an outburst of the intensity of the ones in 1994 and 2007 to have taken place from 1955 to 1990 .",
    "thus there is no evidence for periodicity in the stellar variations .",
    "the lmc - n66 central star can only be classified as an irregular variable with a mass - loss that can increase enormously occasionally and we can not predict the next outburst .",
    "we continue to monitor the star in the optical range , to follow its evolution and to verify if the spectral differences between 2004 and 1994 persist ( see  2.1 and table  1 ) . the data obtained will be used to compute new atmosphere models to detect any variation in the stellar parameters .",
