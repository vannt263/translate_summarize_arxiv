    "following the main text , the evolution operator associated with the embedding hamiltonian @xmath90 can be implemented via 4 control-@xmath91 gates ( @xmath92 ) , and a single qubit rotation @xmath93 .",
    "these gates act as @xmath94 with @xmath95 , and @xmath96 . the indices @xmath97 and @xmath98 indicate on which particle the operators act .",
    "the circuit for the embedding quantum simulator consists of a sequence of gates applied in the following order : @xmath99 simple algebra shows that this expression can be recast as @xmath100 explicitly exhibiting the equivalence between the gate sequence and the evolution under the hamiltonian of interest .",
    "the evolution of the reduced circuit is given by a @xmath93 rotation of qubit @xmath16 , followed by two consecutive control - z gates on qubits @xmath51 and @xmath12 , both controlled on qubit @xmath16 , see fig .",
    "[ fig : sm1 ]  ( a ) .",
    "these logic operations are experimentally implemented by devices that change the polarization of the photons , where the qubits are encoded , with transformations as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : sm1 ]  ( b ) . for single qubit rotations , we make use of half - wave plates ( hwp s ) , which shift the linear polarization of photons . for the two - qubit gates , we make use of two kinds of partially - polarizing beam splitters ( ppbs s ) .",
    "ppbs s of type @xmath51 have transmittances @xmath101 and @xmath102 for horizontal and vertical polarizations , respectively .",
    "ppbs s of type @xmath12 , on the other hand , have transmittances @xmath103 and @xmath104 . their effect can be expressed in terms of polarization dependant input - output relations  with the transmitted mode corresponding to the output mode  of the bosonic creation operators as @xmath105 where @xmath106 ( @xmath107 ) stands for the @xmath97-th input ( output ) port of a ppbs with transmittance @xmath108 for @xmath109-polarized photons .",
    "our circuit is implemented as follows : the first @xmath93 rotation is implemented via a hwp oriented at an angle @xmath110 with respect to its optical axis .",
    "the rest of the target circuit , corresponding to the sequence of two control - z gates , can be expressed in terms of the transformation of the input to output creation operators as @xmath111 where @xmath112 , @xmath113 , and @xmath114 denote the creation operators acting on qubits @xmath16 , @xmath51 , and @xmath12 , respectively .",

    "[ fig : sm1 ]  ( b ) implement the following transformations @xmath122 if events with @xmath16 photons in some of the three output lines of the circuit are discarded .",
    "thus , this linear optics implementation corresponds to the evolution of interest with success probability @xmath123 .",
    "given the probabilistic nature and low efficiency of down - conversion processes , multi - photon experiments are importantly limited by low count - rates . in our case ,",
    "typical two - photon rates from source are around @xmath124  khz at @xmath74 pump ( two - photon rates are approx . linear with pump power ) , which after setup transmission ( @xmath125 ) and @xmath126 success probability of one controlled - sign gate , are reduced to about @xmath127  khz ( @xmath51  khz ) at @xmath74 ( @xmath72 ) pump .",
    "these count - rates make it possible to run the two - photon protocol , described in the main text , at low powers in a reasonable amount of time .",
    "however , this situation is drastically different in the three - photon protocol , where we start with @xmath128  hz of @xmath39-fold events from the source , in which case after setup transmission , @xmath115 success probability of two gates , and @xmath129 transmission in each of two @xmath12  nm filters used for this case , we are left with as few as @xmath130  mhz ( @xmath131  mhz ) at @xmath74 ( @xmath72 ) pump ( @xmath39-fold events reduce quadratically with pump ) .",
    "consequently , long integration times are needed to accumulate meaningful statistics , imposing a limit in the number of measured experimental settings .",
    "to estimate the effect of power - dependent higher - order terms in the performance of our protocols , we inspect the pump power dependence of extracted concurrence from both methods .",
    "[ fig : sm2 ] shows that the performances of both protocols decrease at roughly the same rate with increasing pump power , indicating that in both methods the extracted concurrence at @xmath72 pump is close to performance saturation .",
    "the principal difference between the two methods is that in the three - qubit protocol one of the photons originates from an independent down - conversion event and as such will present a slightly different spectral shape due to a difficulty in optimizing the phase - matching condition for both forward and backward directions simultaneously . to reduce this spectral mismatch , we used two @xmath12  nm filters at the output of the two spatial modes where interference from independent events occurs , see fig .",
    "[ fig : sm3 ] .",
    "note that not identical spectra are observed .",
    "this limitation would be avoided with a source that presented simultaneous high indistinguishability between all interfering photons ."

    "<S> however , a condition closer to the ideal one is reached . </S>",
    "<S> this observed pump power behavior and the high amount of measured concurrence suggest a high - quality gate performance , and that higher - order terms  larger for higher pump powers  are indeed the main cause of performance degradation .    </S>",
    "<S> while only mixed states are always involved in experiments , different degrees of mixtures are present in the @xmath22- and @xmath12-qubit protocols , resulting in different extracted concurrence from both methods . </S>",
    "<S> an inspection of the pump - dependence , see supplemental material , reveals that both methods decrease similarly with pump power and are close to performance saturation at the @xmath72 pump level . </S>",
    "<S> this indicates that in the limit of low higher - order emission our @xmath22-qubit simulator is bounded to the observed performance . </S>",
    "<S> temporal overlap between the @xmath22 photons was carefully matched . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , we attribute the remaining discrepancy to spectral mismatch between photons originated from independent down - conversion events . </S>",
    "<S> this disagreement can in principle be reduced via error correction  @xcite and entanglement purification  @xcite schemes with linear optics .    </S>",
    "<S> _ discussion . </S>",
    "<S> _  we have shown experimentally that entanglement measurements in a quantum system can be efficiently done in a higher - dimensional embedding quantum simulator . </S>",
    "<S> the manipulation of larger hilbert spaces for simplifying the processing of quantum information has been previously considered  @xcite . however , in the present scenario , this advantage in computing concurrence originates from higher - order quantum correlations , as it is the case of the appearance of tripartite entanglement  @xcite .    the efficient behavior of embedding quantum simulators resides in reducing an exponentially - growing number of observables to only a handful of them for the extraction of entanglement monotones . </S>",
    "<S> we note that in this non - scalable photonic platform the addition of one ancillary qubit and one entangling gate results in count rates orders of magnitude lower as compared to direct state tomography on the @xmath12-qubit dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> this means that in practice absolute integration times favor the direct @xmath12-qubit implementation </S>",
    "<S> . however , this introduced limitation escapes from the purposes of the embedding protocol and instead belongs to the specific technology employed in its current state - of - the - art performance .    </S>",
    "<S> this work represents the first proof - of - principle experiment showing the efficient behavior of embedding quantum simulators for the processing of quantum information and extraction of entanglement monotones . </S>",
    "<S> this validates an architecture - independent paradigm that , when implemented in a scalable platform , e.g. ions  @xcite , would overcome a major obstacle in the characterization of large quantum systems . </S>",
    "<S> the relevance of these techniques will thus become patent as quantum simulators grow in size and currently standard approaches like full tomography become utterly unfeasible . </S>",
    "<S> we believe that these results pave the way to the efficient measurement of entanglement in any quantum platform via embedding quantum simulators .    </S>",
