    "scientific publications in peer reviewed journals serve as the standard medium through which most of the progress of science is recorded .",
    "besides offering a mechanism for claiming priorities and exposing results to be checked by others , publishing is also a way to attract attention of other scientists working on related problems .",
    "attention , measured by the number and lifetime of citations , is the main currency of the scientific community , and along with other forms of recognition forms the basis for promotions and the reputation of scientists  @xcite . as franck  @xcite ,",
    "klamer and van dalen  @xcite have pointed out , there is an attention economy at work in science , in which those seeking attention through the production of new knowledge are rewarded by being cited by their peers , whose own standing is measured by the amount of citations they receive .",
    "the attention economy is also at work in many other fields besides science , ranging from entertainment to marketing , and is responsible for the phenomenon of stars , i.e. , people whose income in attention far exceeds the norm in their own endeavors .",
    "moreover , attention is a strong motivator of productivity .",
    "recently , it has been shown that the productivity of youtube videos exhibits a strong positive dependence on the attention they receive , measured by the number of downloads  @xcite .",
    "conversely , a lack of attention leads to a decrease in the number of videos uploaded and the consequent drop in productivity , which in many cases asymptotes to no uploads whatsoever .",
    "decision making and marketing , among others , are based on the mechanisms ruling how attention is stimulated and maintained  @xcite . over the past years , thanks to the internet , a huge amount of data has allowed a thorough investigation of the dynamics of collective attention to online content , ranging from news stories  @xcite , to videos  @xcite and memes  @xcite . here",
    "attention is measured by the number of users views , visits , posts , downloads , tweets .",
    "it is also noted that the attention decays over time , not only because novelty fades , but also because the human capacity to pay attention to new content is limited .",
    "a typical temporal pattern is characterized by an initial rapid growth , followed by a decay .",
    "the decay turns out to be slower than exponential : power law fits give the best results , stretched exponentials being preferable in particular cases  @xcite .",
    "in this paper we focus on the decay of attention in science , on the basis of scientific articles , which like any other content , become obsolete after a while .",
    "typically this happens because their results are surpassed by those of successive papers , which then `` steal '' attention from them .",
    "the problem of the obsolescence of scientific contents has received a lot of attention in scientometrics .",
    "the typical approach is to study the evolution of the number of citations received by a paper in a given time frame ( usually one year ) , since its publication .",
    "the nature of the decay has been controversial , between claims of an exponential trend  @xcite and analyses supporting a slower power law curve  @xcite .",
    "this is partly due to the different types of analysis and the use of distinct data sources .",
    "note that patterns of individual papers are usually noisy , as one can not count on the high statistics available for online contents : the number of tweets posted on a single popular topic may exceed the total number of scientific publications ever made",
    ".    on the other hand , in contrast to online sources , bibliographic databases enable one to perform a longitudinal study of the life cycles of papers . in this work",
    "we make a systematic analysis of papers life cycles , across different scientific fields and historical periods .",
    "we find that the decay of attention for individual papers can be described both by exponential and power law behaviors .",
    "exponential fits turn out to be preferable in the majority of cases .",
    "these results are compatible with a relaxation of attention modeled by ultradiffusion , as observed for the popularity of online content  @xcite .",
    "we also found that attention is dying out more rapidly with time .",
    "however , due to the ongoing exponential growth of scientific publications , which is known to influence citation patterns @xcite , we conjecture that the faster decay observed nowadays is a consequence of the much larger pool of papers among which attention has to be distributed .",
    "in fact , if time is renormalized in terms of the number of papers published in the corresponding period ( e.g. , in each given year ) , we find that the rescaled curves die out at comparable rates across the decades .",
    "our data set consists of all publications ( articles and reviews ) written in english till the end of 2010 included in the database of the thomson reuters ( tr ) web of science . for each publication we extracted its year of publication , the subject category of the journal in which it is published and the corresponding citations to that publication . based on the subject category of the journal ( determined by tr ) of the publication , the papers were categorized in broader disciplines such as physics , medicine , chemistry and biology ( see table 1 ) .",
    "most analyses are carried out using the top 10% papers ( based on their total number of citations ) , as it allows to include a sufficient number of papers from older times , but still keeping the number of yearly citations large enough to allow for a statistically valid analysis .",
    "the analysis of papers with relatively lower citations follow qualitatively similar behavior and is shown in the appendix .    [",
    "tab : stats ]    .basic statistics of the different scientific fields we considered : clinical medicine , molecular biology , chemistry and physics .",
    "they represent the most active fields in terms of the total volume of publications . here , @xmath0 is the number of publications in a given field , @xmath1 is the maximum number of citations to a given paper in that field and @xmath2 is the average number of citations to all the papers in that field . [ cols=\"<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]      we measure the trend in the temporal evolution of the different plots using the least square method .",
    "we consider the f - statistics for a significant linear regression relationship between the response variable and the predictor variable .",
    "we used it to compare the statistical models that best fit the population from which the data were sampled .",
    "as the f - score takes into account both the number of data points available for the fit and the number of degrees of freedom of the model , it is possible to compare the accuracy of the fit for different models with different parameters or between data sets of different size .",
    "we first look at the way citations received by a paper change with time .",
    "since different scientific fields are characterized by different volumes of publications and citations , many features of the citation trajectory are field dependent . however , for most fields the number of yearly citations @xmath3 to a given paper @xmath4 rises after its publication and peaks within 2 - 7 years .",
    "the peak is followed by a decay in the number of citations that reflects the obsolescence of older knowledge .",
    "[ fig : citation_trajectory ] ( top panels ) shows the normalized citation trajectory @xmath5 of papers in physics and biology . here , @xmath6 is the maximum number of citations received by paper @xmath4 in any given year after its publication .",
    "[ fig : individual ] shows a summary of the renormalization process and different measures used for analysis . for both disciplines ,",
    "the citation trajectories of papers published over different years show systematic changes with time .",
    "new papers have higher citation rates for the first few years , whereas over longer periods of time old papers have higher citation rates .",
    "some irregularity in the tail of the citation trajectories might be due to the heterogeneity in the time to reach the peak number of citations @xmath7 .",
    "the change in the citation rate over time is more evident when we group the papers based on their _ peak year _ , i.e. , year in which they receive the maximum number of citations .",
    "thus , the peak year represents the year in which a paper is at the peak of its attention .",
    "[ fig : citation_trajectory ] ( bottom panels ) show that the decay pattern is more robust when the papers were aggregated according to their peak year as compared to their publication year .",
    "this is true for other groups of papers as well : appendix fig .",

    "[ fig : time_to_peak ]  ( a - d ) we plot the distribution of @xmath7 for papers published in the same year , for all four disciplines and for several years .",
    "the majority of the papers peak within a few years since publication .",

    "for all fields the distribution of @xmath7 is time dependent , with its value decreasing steadily in time .",
    "[ fig : time_to_peak ]  ( e , f ) shows the time evolution of the mean of @xmath7 for different fields and two groups of papers : the most cited 10@xmath8 and the [ 11 - 30 ] percentile .",
    "the decreasing mean of the time to peak indicates that in recent times papers are taking less time to reach the peak of their attention .",
    "this result seems to be consistent with previous findings @xcite showing , both theoretically and empirically , that the average reference age is an increasing function of time .",
    "this would suggest that more recent papers are able to dig deeper in scientific literature , reducing the amount of attention available for papers published in recent years and therefore causing a shortening of the time needed to peak .",
    "also , this behavior is shown to be independent of the citation volume of the papers , although papers with fewer citations take less time to reach the peak .",

    "we fit the normalized citation trajectories of each paper and determine the best fit parameters using the least square method .",

    "contrary to the previous measure , the evolution of the renormalized half - life @xmath56 shows a relatively stable behavior .",
    "note that , this observation is highly non - trivial as the stable renormalized half - life is only expected in the case when the exponential increase in the number of publications exactly compensate for the decay in citation rate .",
    "a similar behavior is also observed when lower thresholds @xmath48 are used , i.e. , by forcing the drop to be more significant ( see appendix fig .",
    "the renormalized half life defined in equation [ eq : renormalization ] provides a measure of the time required for a paper to fall below a certain arbitrarily defined threshold of attention in terms of number of publications , which can be seen to represent the amount of `` competition '' a paper is about to withstand before dropping to significantly lower values of attention .",

    "[ fig : halflife ] suggests that , even though papers are now taking on average less time to drop below a certain threshold of attention , the number of published papers after which a work becomes obsolete does not show the same behavior . on the contrary ,",
    "our data indicates an approximately constant value throughout the time period of the study .",
    "so , the growing number of publications proportionally increases the likelihood of a paper to become obsolete , but the contribution of each paper to this process is about the same , regardless of the age of the paper .",
    "we have studied how attention towards scientific publications diminishes over time , due to the obsolescence of knowledge . for millions of papers in four different disciplines",
    "we find that after reaching a peak , typically a few years since publication , the number of citations goes down relatively fast .",
    "we find that exponential decays are to be generally preferred over power law decays , though the latter are providing better and better descriptions of the data for recent times .",
    "the existence of many time - scales in citation decay and our ability to construct an ultrametric space to represent this decay , leads us to speculate that citation decay is an ultradiffusive process , like the decay of popularity of online content .",
    "interestingly , the decay is getting faster and faster , indicating that scholars ",
    "forget \" more easily papers now than in the past .",
    "we found that this has to do with the exponential growth in the number of publications , which inevitably accelerates the turnover of papers , due to the finite capacity of scholars to keep track of the scientific literature .",
    "although search engines and digitalization have made it easier for scientists to discover relevant information , the amount of information that can be successfully processed is still limited .",
    "in fact , by measuring time in terms of the number of published works , the decay appears approximately stable over time , across disciplines , although there are slight monotonic trends for medicine and biology .",
    "however , we must emphasise that we normalized time by using the number of published papers in the discipline at study .",
    "this is the simplest choice to make , but it is not necessarily the most sensible one .",
    "the fields we considered are rather broad , and subdivided in many different topics .",

    "it is very difficult to isolate the relevant literature case by case .",
