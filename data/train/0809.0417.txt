    "the phenomenon of synchronization has been studied in contexts ranging from the synchronization of clocks and the flashing of fire - flies @xcite to synchronization in oscillator networks @xcite and in complex networks @xcite .",
    "synchronized states have been seen in the context of traffic flows as well @xcite , and investigations of traffic flow on substrates of various geometries have been the focus of recent research interest @xcite .",
    "the synchronization of processes at the nodes , or hubs , of complex networks can have serious consequences for the performance of the network @xcite . in the case of communication networks ,",
    "the performance of the networks is assessed in terms of their efficiency at packet delivery .",
    "such networks can show a congestion - decongestion transition @xcite .",
    "we note that an intimate connection between congestion and synchronization effects has been seen in the case of real networks @xcite .",
    "the aim of this paper is to study the interplay of congestion and synchronization effects on each other , and examine their effect on the efficiency of the network for packet delivery in the context of two model networks based on two dimensional grids .",
    "the first network consists of nodes and hubs , with the hubs being connected by random assortative or gradient connections@xcite . in the case of the second network , in addition to nearest neighbour connections between nodes ,",
    "the nodes are connected probabilistically to other nodes , with the probability of a connection between nodes being dependent on the euclidean distance between them@xcite .",
    "such networks are called waxman networks and are popular models of internet topology@xcite .",
    "synchronisation effects are observed in the congested phase of both these model networks .",
    "in addition to these two networks , we also discuss synchronisation effects seen in actual internet data .",
    "we first study synchronization behavior in a two dimensional communication network of nodes and hubs .",
    "such networks have been considered earlier in the context of search algorithms @xcite and of network traffic with routers and hosts @xcite . despite the regular @xmath0 geometry",
    "such models have shown log - normal distribution in latency times as seen in internet dynamics @xcite .",
    "the lattice consists of two types of nodes , the regular or ordinary nodes , which are connected to each of their nearest neighbors , and the hubs , which are connected to all the nodes in a given area of influence , and are randomly distributed in the lattice .",
    "thus , the network represents a model with local clustering and geographical separations @xcite .",
    "congestion effects are seen on this network when a large number of messages travel between multiple sources and targets due to various factors like capacity , band - width and network topology @xcite .",
    "decongestion strategies , which involve the manipulation of factors like capacity and connectivity have been set up for these networks .",
    "effective connectivity strategies have focused on setting up random assortative@xcite , or gradient connections@xcite between hubs of high betweenness centrality .",
    "we introduce the ideas of phase synchronization and complete synchronization in the context of the queue lengths at the hubs .",
    "the queue at a given hub is defined to be the number of messages which have the hub as a temporary target . during multiple message transfer ,",
    "when many messages run simultaneously on the lattice , the network tends to congest when the number of messages exceed a certain critical number , and the queue lengths tend to build up at hubs which see heavy traffic .",
    "the hubs which see heavy traffic are ranked by the co - efficient of betweenness centrality ( @xmath1 ) , which is the fraction of messages which pass through a given hub .",
    "we focus on the top five hubs ranked by cbc .",
    "phase synchronization is seen between pairs of hubs of comparable betweenness centrality .",
    "the hub which is slowest to decongest ( generally the hub of highest cbc ) drives the slower hubs with a cascading master - slave effect in the hub hierarchy .",
    "when the network starts decongesting , the queue lengths decrease , and synchronization is lost .",
    "these results are reflected in the global synchronization parameter .",
    "when decongestion strategies which set up random assortative , or gradient , connections between hubs are implemented , complete synchronization is seen between some pairs of these hubs in the congested phase , and phase synchronization is seen between others .",
    "we demonstrate our results in the context of the gradient decongestion strategy , but the results remain unaltered for decongestion strategies based on random assortative connections .",
    "similar results are seen for constant density traffic where a fixed number of messages are fed on the system at regular intervals .",
    "total synchronization is also seen in the queue lengths of the hubs of high cbc .",
    "all the results obtained for the first model are observed for message transport on waxman topology network , where again synchronisation of hubs of high cbc is observed in the congested state .",
    "we demonstrate these results . finally we study internet traffic data and demonstrate that phase synchronisation is seen in this data as well .",
    "intermittent phase synchronization is also seen in this data .",
    "we first study traffic congestion for a model network with local clustering developed in ref.@xcite .",
    "this network consists of a two - dimensional lattice with ordinary nodes and hubs ( see fig . [",
    "fig : asgr ] ) .",
    "each ordinary node is connected to its nearest - neighbors , whereas the hubs are connected to all nodes within a given area of influence defined as a square of side @xmath2 centered around the hub@xcite .",
    "the hubs are randomly distributed on the lattice such that no two hubs are separated by less than a minimum distance , @xmath3 .",
    "constituent nodes in the overlap areas of hubs acquire connections to all the hubs whose influence areas overlap .",
    "the source s@xmath4 and target t@xmath5 are chosen from the lattice and separated by a fixed distance @xmath6 which is defined by the manhattan distance @xmath6 = @xmath7 + @xmath8 .",
    "it is useful to identify and rank hubs which see the maximum traffic .",
    "this is done by defining the co - efficient of betweenness centrality ( cbc ) where the cbc of a given hub @xmath9 is defined as @xmath10 , i.e. the ratio of the number of messages that go through a hub @xmath9 to the total number of messages running on the lattice .",
    "these are listed in table  [ tab : table1 ] .",
    "efficient decongestion strategies have been set up by connecting hubs of high cbc amongst themselves , or to randomly chosen other hubs via assortative connections @xcite .",
    "gradient mechanisms @xcite can also be used to decongest traffic @xcite(see fig .",
    "[ fig : asgr](b ) ) .    [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     we observe similar behavior when the data is studied for @xmath11 nov @xmath12 .",
    "it is observed that the two websites ( youtube , rediffmail ) peak together during the time interval @xmath13 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : phasesynch1](a ) ) . during this time interval",
    "the two websites are synchronized as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : phasesynch1](a(ii ) ) .",
    "as soon as the values of @xmath14 start decreasing for both the sites , phase synchronization is lost .",
    "when we compared the sites google and yahoo it was observed that for yahoo , the number of views increases intermittently .",
    "hence intermittent behavior of phase synchronization is observed for yahoo and google ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : phasesynch1](b ) ) .",
    "no phase synchronization is observed between google and rediffmail .",
    "this is similar to the absence of phase synchronization in queue lengths between higher cbc hubs and hubs of low cbc values as in fig .",
    "[ fig : randhub ] for the @xmath0 communication network .",
    "also we observed that hubs of comparable cbc phase synchronize .",
    "similarly in the internet data , websites of comparable volume of traffic phase synchronize .",
    "we also study the traffic data of the global top five websites ranked by the percentage of global internet users who visit the respective website .",
    "[ fig : phasesynch2](a ) shows the plot of percentage of global internet users,@xmath15 for the top ranked websites for a period of @xmath16 days from 08/02/2009 to 24/02/2009 .",
    "the data has been collected from the website @xmath17 .",
    "the websites are @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 . here",
    "also phase locking is observed for the pairs of websites ( fig .",
    "[ fig : phasesynch2](b ) ) .",
    "to summarize , we have established a connection between synchronization and congestion in the case of two communication networks based on @xmath0 geometries , a locally clustered network , and a network based on random graphs , viz . the waxman topology network .",
    "we first considered the case where many messages are deposited simultaneously on the lattice .",
    "we observed that the queue lengths of the top five hubs get phase synchronized when the system is in the congested phase i.e. the queue lengths at the hubs start piling up . phase synchronization is lost when messages start getting delivered to their destinations and queue lengths start decreasing .",
    "complete synchronization in queue lengths between certain pairs of top five hubs is observed when decongestion strategies are implemented by connecting the top five hubs by gradient connections or by assortative linkages .",
    "phase synchronization is also seen between nodes of comparable cbc in the waxman topology despite the fact that the degree distribution of the waxman graphs is entirely different from that of the locally clustered network and @xmath23@xcite . ] .",
    "the phenomenon of synchronization in queue length in the congested phase is thus a robust one .",
    "we also observed that the phase synchronization does not exist between hubs of widely separated cbc - s , as can be seen from the lack of synchronization between the high cbc hubs and any randomly chosen hub ( which turn out to have lower cbc values ) .",
    "it is has been seen , for typical configurations , that the central most region of the lattice is the most congested due to flow of messages from both sides of the lattice@xcite .",
    "the top hubs ranked by their cbc values were also seen to be located at the central region of the lattice and were close to each other . in such cases ,",
    "the hub with the highest cbc value gets congested first and the remaining hubs follow , resulting in increase in queue lengths at the remaining hubs after a time lag resulting in a phase difference between the queues at different hubs .",
    "this phase difference tends to a constant in the congested phase .",
    "thus , phase synchronization in queue lengths exists pairwise for hubs of comparable cbc values .",
    "global synchronization is also seen between hubs of comparable cbc - s .",
    "this is demonstrated by the behavior of the global synchronization parameters for the top five hubs .",
    "similar phase synchronized behavior is observed when messages are fed on the lattice at a constant rate . the parameters of synchronization , such as the phase difference and the global synchronization parameters , show small fluctuations in this case , indicating stronger synchronization as compared to simultaneous deposition .    thus , synchronization is associated with the inefficient phase of the system .",
    "similar phenomena can be found in the context of neurophysiological systems @xcite and in computer networks @xcite .",
    "we observed that the most congested hub drives the rest .",
    "as soon as this hub decongests , the synchronization is lost . in the case of our communication network , this is usually the hub of highest cbc . due to",
    "the master - slave relation between the most congested hub and the rest , there is cascading effect by which successive pairs lose synchronization .",
    "cascading effects have been seen in other systems such as power grids @xcite and the internet @xcite .",
    "it will be interesting to see if synchronization effects can be observed in these contexts .",
    "finally we studied the internet traffic data obtained in indian institute of technology , madras , india as well as the global internet data obtained from the alexa website . despite the irregular pattern of traffic in this data , phase synchronization in the number of views",
    "is observed between two websites of comparable volume of traffic .",
    "phase synchronization breaks down if the volume of traffic changes abruptly .",
    "global synchronization is also observed for the internet data .",
    "this data also shows the existence of intermittent synchronization .",
    "these observations can be of great utility in the practical situations .",
    "for example , e.g. synchronization can be considered as a predictor of congestion .",
    "synchronization can also be used to detect changes in the pattern of traffic or to detect abnormal traffic from a given hub .",
    "the hub from where the attack originates can be easily identified via a synchronization effect .",
    "synchronization in transport may also provide information about the way in which the network is connected . thus our study may prove to be useful in a number of application contexts .",
