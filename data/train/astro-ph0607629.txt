    "the formation of massive elliptical galaxies is a major conundrum in modern cosmology .",
    "observationally , it is clear that such galaxies formed the bulk of their stars at redshifts greater than two , with evidence coming from a variety of studies , including observations of clusters and groups of galaxies , optical / nir galaxy count and colour studies @xcite and spectroscopic surveys of field galaxies over a range of redshifts @xcite .",
    "these studies also suggest that the evolution of a majority of these massive ellipticals is consistent with a simple passive model of stellar evolution .",
    "for example , @xcite have used the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; * ? ? ? * ) to study the evolution of luminous early  type galaxies ( out to @xmath10 ) and find that , for a fixed velocity dispersion , older ellipticals are redder and fainter in luminosity , fully consistent with the expected fading of their stellar populations with time .",
    "they also find that the environment ( as measured by local density ) of luminous ellipticals has only a weak effect upon their properties , e.g. , the fundamental plane fades by only 0.075 mags / arcsec@xmath11 from the field to the cores of clusters ( consistent with cluster galaxies forming at a slightly earlier epoch than field ellipticals ) .",
    "several other studies have also found very similar results @xcite .",
    "however , several authors have found evidence for recent and/or on - going star - formation in a fraction of local massive ellipticals @xcite .",
    "this fraction appears to increase with redshift @xcite and decrease with mass @xcite .",
    "one potential problem for studies of massive elliptical / early - type galaxies , particularly those tracking the evolution with redshift , is that of _ progenitor bias _ @xcite . by studying only galaxies that look like massive early - type systems at high redshift ,",
    "some of the progenitors of the low redshift massive early - type galaxies may be missed .",
    "an effective way to counter this problem is to study the evolution in the number density , or luminosity function ( lf ) , of massive early - type galaxies with redshift .",
    "if these galaxies did indeed form at high redshift , then there will be little evidence for the evolution of their lf with redshift .",
    "such studies have only just begun , e.g. , the combo17 ( c17 ) survey , which reported on the evolution of @xmath12 red ( and thus implied early - type ) galaxies and found at most a factor of two evolution out to @xmath13 ( corresponding to 9 gyrs in look ",
    "back time ; * ? ? ?",
    "this is consistent with earlier ( but smaller in number ) studies of high redshift red ( early  type ) galaxies from the cfrs @xcite , cnoc2 @xcite and k20 surveys . at higher redshifts ( @xmath14 ) , recent spectroscopic surveys suggest that a significant fraction of massive galaxies are already in place at these early epochs @xcite .    theoretically , the existence of massive , passively ",
    "evolved ellipticals has been a major challenge for some models of galaxy evolution . for example , in the favoured hierarchical cold dark matter ( cdm ) model of structure formation , such massive galaxies are expected to reside in the largest dark matter haloes , that form at late times through the merger of smaller mass haloes ( see @xcite for early predictions ) . in recent years",
    ", there have been a number of prescriptions proposed to solve the `` anti  hierarchical '' nature of the formation and evolution of massive ellipticals and thus better match the observations discussed above , including : _",
    "i ) _ the reduction of the gas cooling rate @xcite ; _ ii ) _ super - winds that eject the gas once it has cooled , but before it can form stars @xcite ; _ iii ) _ shock heating of infalling gas and -pdv work of the gas @xcite ; _ iv ) _ feedback from active galactic nuclei ( agn ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the latter of these proposed effects ( agn feedback ) is appealing because of the observed empirical relationship between the luminosity , central concentration and mass of galactic bulges and the mass of their central super - massive black holes @xcite .",
    "agn feedback comes in two flavors : _",
    "i ) _ the merger of gas  rich galaxies causing an initial starburst , followed by the growth of the central black hole and a `` quasar wind '' which quenches further star  formation @xcite ; _ ii ) _ radio feedback from low luminosity agn that suppresses the cooling of gas in massive halos resulting in the termination of late ",
    "time star - formation @xcite .",
    "detailed simulations of these agn feedback models on the evolution of ellipticals has helped resolve the discrepancy between present observations and the naive hierarchical expectations of the cdm model @xcite .",
    "for example , @xcite predict that for galaxies more massive than @xmath15 , over 50% of their stars have formed by a median redshift of @xmath16 , while the typical assembly redshift of these galaxies ( when these stars reside in a single object ) is only @xmath17 .",
    "this requires `` dry mergers '' of the smaller galaxies ( i.e. without gas ) to avoid causing bursts of new star  formation .",
    "several authors have found evidence for such dry mergers ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    in this paper",
    ", we present an accurate measurement of the evolution of the luminosity function ( lf ) of luminous red galaxies ( lrgs ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , that are predominantly massive elliptical galaxies and thus provide strong constraints on the physical mechanisms that have been suggested to produce anti - hierarchical galaxy formation in a cdm universe .",
    "we utilise two samples of lrgs , one from the sdss ( @xmath18 ) , and a new survey of higher redshift lrgs ( @xmath19 ) selected from the multi  colour sdss photometry , but spectroscopically observed using the 2df spectrograph on the anglo ",
    "australian telescope ( aat ) .",
    "this new survey is known as the 2df - sdss lrg and qso ( 2slaq ) survey .",
    "the lrg component of the 2slaq survey is a significant advance over previous surveys of massive early - type galaxies due to an increase in both the volume surveyed ( @xmath20 ) , thus reducing the problem of cosmic variance , and the number of galaxy redshifts obtained , thus greatly increasing the statistical accuracy of the lf at bright magnitudes . in section [ sec : data ] , we describe the 2slaq survey , while in section 3 we present a detailed discussion of the k and evolutionary corrections , photometric errors and consistent colour selections for the sdss and 2slaq samples . in section [ sec : lf ]",
    "we present the luminosity functions of the sdss and 2slaq surveys . in section [ sec : dis ] , we discuss our results in terms of models of galaxy evolution and conclude . throughout , we adopt a cosmology of @xmath21 = 0.3 , @xmath22 = 0.7 and @xmath23 = 70 km s@xmath24 mpc@xmath24 .",
    "we present in this paper an analysis of lrgs taken from both the sdss survey and the 2df  sdss lrg and qso ( 2slaq ) survey . for the sdss data",
    ", we only use the lrg cut i photometric selection ( using the @xmath25 and @xmath26 colours of galaxies ) as defined and discussed in eisenstein et al .",
    "( 2001 ; e01 ) .",
    "this provides us with a pseudo volume  limited sample of lrgs , with @xmath27 and @xmath28 , selected from the sdss data release ( dr3 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) dataset . below @xmath29 , the space density of sdss lrgs increases by nearly 50% because of contamination by low redshift star  forming galaxies in the colour selection , while above @xmath30",
    ", the space density of sdss lrgs begins to decrease because of the flux limit and the degeneracy between the colours and redshift of lrgs close to @xmath31 where the @xmath32break feature passes out of the sdss @xmath33band into the @xmath34band @xcite . within the range @xmath35 , the space density of sdss cut i lrgs is approximately constant with redshift ( see e01 ) .    in 2003 , the 2slaq survey began with the goal of producing a pseudo volume  limited sample of 10,000 lrgs , with a median redshift of @xmath36 , and 10,000 faint @xmath37 quasars , both selected from the sdss multi ",
    "colour imaging data . in this paper",
    ", we focus on the 2slaq lrgs which are selected using similar criteria as the cut ii sdss lrgs in e01 .",
    "the key differences are : _",
    "( i ) _ the apparent magnitude limit has been lowered to @xmath38 , thus extending the volume  limited lrg samples to @xmath9 ; _ ( ii ) _ the effective rest  frame colour cut ( @xmath39 in e01 ) has been shifted slightly bluer than in the sdss lrg selection to accommodate the density of 2df fibres available .",
    "this provides a less conservative colour cut , at these higher redshifts , which is essential for studying potentially small changes in their colour .",
    "the details of the 2slaq lrg selection and observations are presented elsewhere @xcite .",
    "however , we have measured over 11000 lrg redshifts , covering @xmath40 of sdss imaging data , from 87 allocated nights of aat time . over 90% of these galaxies",
    "are within the range @xmath41 .",
    "the targeted lrgs where split into three subsamples as detailed in @xcite , with the primary sample ( sample 8) accounting for two thirds of these .",
    "we only focus on sample 8 in this paper due to its high completeness and uniform selection",
    ". the overall success rate of obtaining redshifts from the 2df spectra for sample 8 lrgs is 95% , while the centers of the 2df fields were spaced by 1.2@xmath42 , resulting in an overall redshift completeness of sample 8 lrg targets of @xmath4375% across the whole survey area ( see section [ sec : comp ] ) .",
    "these data have recently been used to calibrate lrg photometric redshifts @xcite .",
    "although the sdss magnitude system was designed to be on the ab scale @xcite , the final calibration has differences from the proposed values by a few percent .",
    "we have applied the corrections m@xmath44 = m@xmath45 $ ] for @xmath46 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 respectively ( eisenstein , priv .",
    "comm . ) . all magnitudes and colours presented throughout this paper",
    "are corrected for galactic extinction @xcite .",
    "the galaxy samples discussed in this paper were originally selected under the assumption that lrgs are old , passively  evolving galaxies . here , we continue this fundamental assumption when investigating the evolution of the lrg luminosity function by applying the same passively  evolving models to our data when computing k and evolutionary ( e ) corrections , luminosity functions and colour selection boundaries .",
    "if this assumption is correct , then our k+e corrected luminosity functions will be identical over the whole redshift range studied here , with any additional evolution in the lrg population ( beyond the simple passive model ) being displayed as a change in the lf with redshift .",
    "however , as we are using two slightly different selections of lrgs to generate our total lrg sample , it is vital that we select the same galaxy population at all redshifts .      in order to make a fair comparison between the sdss and 2slaq lrg samples ( at different redshifts )",
    ", we must correct the properties of our observed galaxies ( magnitude , colours _ etc .",
    "_ ) into rest  frame quantities by applying k  corrections .",
    "in addition , we can also correct these rest  frame quantities for the expected evolutionary changes over the redshift range studied . these e  corrections",
    "are usually performed assuming a model for the galaxy spectral energy distribution ( sed ) and its evolution with redshift . in this paper",
    ", we therefore generate our k+e corrections using the @xcite stellar population synthesis code . in detail",
    ", we generate two stellar population models the first of which forms all its stars in a single instantaneous burst at @xmath48 = 9.84 ( solar metallicity ) and then evolves passively with no further star formation .",
    "the second model forms the bulk of its stars in a similar burst , but includes a small amount of continuous star formation throughout the rest of its evolution , accounting for 5% of its final mass .",
    "these two models are shown in figure 1 and are labelled `` passive '' and `` passive+sf '' respectively .",
    "figure [ fig : colz ] shows the colour evolution as a function of redshift for these two models along with the actual measured colours of the sdss and 2slaq lrgs .",
    "some differences between the models and data are evident , e.g. , the models are too red in @xmath25 and too blue in @xmath26 for the lowest redshift lrgs , with the opposite effect for the highest redshift lrgs .",
    "this offset between models and data in the lower redshift lrgs was noted in e01 and a correction to the @xmath25 colours of 0.08 magnitudes was applied .",
    "however , with the addition of the higher redshift sample , it is clear that a simple offset is an inadequate correction over our entire redshift range .",
    "such differences between the models and observed colours of early - type galaxies has been seen before , e.g. , @xcite were unable to match the red sequence colours in galaxy clusters at similar redshifts , while a similar offset is seen in the colour  redshift plots of @xcite from the goods / cdfs fields .",
    "simple changes to the models , such as the formation redshift , metallicity and imf of the models , are unable to improve the model fits to the data .",
    "we also note that using the pegase stellar population synthesis model produced very similar results .",
    "it appears that the models are not accurately reproducing the shape of the spectrum between @xmath32  and @xmath49 causing an offset in @xmath25 and @xmath26 as the @xmath34 filter passes through this ( rest  frame ) wavelength region .",
    "the @xmath50 colours of lrgs are well reproduced by the models .    in order to minimise the systematic uncertainties in the models , and thus uncertainties in our k+e corrections",
    ", we will exploit the fact that the redshifted sdss @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 passbands at @xmath36 ( i.e. , the median redshift of the 2slaq lrgs ) approximately overlap the @xmath46 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath47 passbands at @xmath51 ( the typical redshift of a sdss lrg ) . this effect is illustrated in figure [ fig : filz ] where the transmission curves of the sdss filters are plotted at @xmath52 and @xmath53 and compared to the rest  frame spectral energy distribution of our passively evolved stellar population model as discussed above .",
    "therefore , for each lrg , we estimate its k+e correction by interpolating between the two sed models using the observed @xmath50 colour of the galaxy . for the sdss lrg sample",
    ", we simply correct the observed @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath47 magnitudes to @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath47 at @xmath54 .",
    "the median size of these k+e corrections ranges from 0.01 in @xmath47 passband to 0.43 in @xmath33band . for the 2slaq lrg sample",
    ", we again use the observed @xmath50 colour to interpolate between the two sed models , but this time correct from observed @xmath34 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 passbands to @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath47 at @xmath54 .",
    "the median size of these k and k+e corrections are 0.32 and 0.7 respectively when going from the @xmath34band to the @xmath33band , 0.1 and 0.4 going @xmath47band to @xmath34band , and 0.1 and 0.4 when correcting from @xmath48band to @xmath47band .",
    "tables of these corrections for the two different sed models are given in appendix [ sec : k+e ] .    throughout the rest of this paper",
    ", we use the notation m@xmath55 to represent the absolute magnitude of an lrg observed through a sdss @xmath34band filter redshifted to @xmath56 .",
    "this notation is similar to that used in @xcite , except here we include an evolutionary correction in addition to the k - correction .",
    "we note that m@xmath55 @xmath57 m@xmath58 + 0.11 for the colour of a typical lrg .",
    "the differences in the sdss and 2slaq selection criteria discussed above are explicitly illustrated in figure [ fig : selectioncmp ] .",
    "here , we have taken a sample of sdss main galaxies @xcite with @xmath59 and k+e corrected all of them to @xmath48 = 0.2 .",
    "the sdss main sample consists of all galaxies with @xmath60 17.77 and provides a representative sample of the whole galaxy population . for this sample ,",
    "we generate the k+e corrections by interpolating between a passive model and one with continuous star formation based on the observed @xmath50 colour of the galaxy .",
    "we then applied the sdss and 2slaq lrg selection criteria at the two redshifts respectively .",
    "we plot in figure [ fig : selectioncmp ] the colour  magnitude relation ( @xmath61 versus m@xmath55 ) for these galaxies , where @xmath62 is the @xmath33 filter at @xmath48 = 0.2 , illustrating which galaxies would be selected by each criteria and their combination .",
    "this figure clearly illustrates the bluer 2slaq selection as well as the magnitude dependence of the sdss lrg colour selection ( e01 ) as the selection cuts through the red sequence starting at m@xmath63 -22.8 .",
    "although the detailed colour evolution of lrgs remains unknown , we will proceed by assuming a simple passive model for lrgs evolution and thus make a self  consistent colour selection at both @xmath51 and @xmath36 .",
    "we can then check whether the observed lf evolution is consistent with this simple hypothesis and whether any further evolution ( beyond passive ) is required to explain our observations . to do this",
    ", we first use the k+e corrections described above to correct all the lrgs in both samples to the redshift of the other sample @xmath64 we correct the 2slaq lrgs to @xmath48 = 0.2 and the sdss lrgs to @xmath48 = 0.55 .",
    "we then require that for any individual lrg to be included in our analysis of the lrg lf it must satisfy both the sdss criteria ( at @xmath48 = 0.2 ) and the 2slaq criteria ( at @xmath48 = 0.55 ) . as might be expected , considering the broader colour and magnitude ranges of the 2slaq selection criteria , most of the sdss lrgs ( @xmath5790% )",
    "would still be selected as lrgs at @xmath48 = 0.55 .",
    "the opposite is not true with only @xmath5730% of the 2slaq lrgs satisfying the stricter sdss cut",
    "i lrg criteria .",
    "figure [ fig : coldistcont ] shows the colour distributions of all the 2slaq lrgs ( _ red _ ) and all the sdss lrgs ( _ blue _ ) convolved with the typical photometric errors of the 2slaq lrgs , k+e corrected to @xmath48 = 0.2 .",
    "the left  hand panel shows the colour distributions of the full sample of sdss and 2slaq lrgs considered in this paper ( i.e. , the raw data ) , while the middle panel shows only those galaxies which satisfy both the sdss and 2slaq lrg selection criteria at @xmath48 = 0.2 and @xmath48 = 0.55 respectively . as mentioned previously",
    ", the 2slaq lrgs in the left  hand panel have bluer colour distributions compared to the sdss lrgs , reflecting their bluer and fainter selection criteria . when the joint sdss and 2slaq selection criteria are applied , the colour distributions of this restricted set of 2slaq lrgs now become redder and much closer to the sdss lrg colour distributions",
    ". however , an offset between the 2slaq and sdss lrg colour distributions is still evident ( in the middle panel ) , i.e. , 0.05 magnitudes in the mean @xmath25 colour of lrgs .",
    "we believe this offset is due to residual inaccuracies in the models used for our k - corrections , although we have tried to reduce this problem by correcting between overlapping filters .",
    "the wide redshift range of our samples ( particularly in the sdss ) results in the errors in our k - corrections still being significant and detectable .    to improve the agreement between the 2slaq and sdss lrg samples , we restrict the redshift ranges of these two samples to be closer to the redshifts where the sdss filters have their greatest overlap ( figure 2 ) .",
    "we restrict the sdss lrg sample to @xmath65 and 2slaq lrg sample to @xmath66 , which reduces the amplitude of the k - corrections at z = 0.2 for the sdss lrgs to a range of 0.005 to 0.06 , compared to @xmath67 to @xmath68 without this restricted redshift range .",
    "likewise , the amplitude of the 2slaq lrg k - corrections reduce to a range of 0.08 to 0.30 , compared to @xmath68 to @xmath69 without the restricted redshift range",
    ". the right  hand panel of figure [ fig : coldistcont ] shows the colour distributions of lrgs that satisfy both the sdss and 2slaq selection criteria within the restricted redshift ranges discussed above .",
    "this results in the colour distributions of the two lrg samples being almost identical ; the median colour difference is now less than 0.01 magnitudes .",
    "these restricted redshift lrg samples give us greater confidence that , under the assumption of passive evolution , we are now selecting the same type of galaxy in both the sdss and 2slaq surveys .",
    "it also suggests that the discrepancy between the observed and model colours is only affecting the k - corrections and not the evolution corrections .",
    "the final redshift  restricted samples contain 6326 sdss lrgs , with @xmath70 , and 1725 2slaq lrgs , with @xmath66 . clearly making such tight redshift cuts",
    "has resulted in a significant reduction in the size of our samples .",
    "however , we believe that minimising the errors in the k+e corrections is vital to ensure that the lrg samples from the sdss and 2slaq are as close as possible ."
