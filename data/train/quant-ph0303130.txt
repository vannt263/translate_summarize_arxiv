    "one of the most important potential applications of quantum computers ( qc s ) is studies of quantum many - body effects .",
    "it is particularly interesting to find new many - body effects in condensed - matter systems that could be easily simulated on a qc . in the present paper",
    "we discuss one such effect : antiresonance , or destructive quantum interference between two - particle excitations in a system with defects .",
    "we also study interaction - induced two - particle localization on a defect and discuss implications of the results for quantum computing .",
    "the basic elements of a qc , qubits , are two - state systems .",
    "they are naturally modeled by spin-1/2 particles . in",
    "many suggested realizations of qc s , the qubit - qubit interaction is `` on '' all the time @xcite . in terms of spins , it corresponds to exchange interaction .",
    "the dynamics of such qc s and spin systems in solids have many important similar aspects that can be studied together .    in most proposed qc",
    "s the energy difference between the qubit states is large compared to the qubit - qubit interaction .",
    "this corresponds to a system of spins in a strong external magnetic field .",
    "however , in contrast to ideal spin systems , level spacings of different qubits can be different .",
    "a major advantageous feature of qc s is that the qubit energies can be often individually controlled @xcite .",
    "this corresponds to controllable disorder of a spin system , and it allows one to use qc s for studying a fundamentally important problem of how the spin - spin interaction affects spin dynamics in the presence of disorder .",
    "several models of qc s where the interqubit interaction is permanently `` on '' are currently studied . in these models",
    "the effective spin - spin interaction is usually strongly anisotropic .",
    "it varies from the essentially ising coupling @xmath1 in nuclear magnetic resonance and some other systems @xcite ( @xmath2 enumerate qubits , and @xmath3 is the direction of the magnetic field ) to the @xmath4-type ( i.e. , @xmath5 ) or the @xmath0-type ( i.e. , @xmath6 ) coupling in some josephson - junction based systems @xcite .",
    "the ising coupling describes the system in the case where the transition frequencies of different qubits are strongly different .",
    "then @xmath1 is the only part of the interaction that slowly oscillates in time , in the heisenberg representation , and therefore is not averaged out .",
    "if the qubit frequencies are close to each other , the terms @xmath7 become smooth functions of time as well .",
    "they lead to resonant excitation hopping between qubits . in a multiqubit system with close frequencies , both ising and @xmath4 interactions",
    "are present in the general case , but their strengths may be different @xcite . in this sense",
    "the @xmath0 coupling is most general , at least for qubits with high transition frequencies .",
    "the interqubit interaction often rapidly falls off with the distance and can be approximated by nearest neighbor coupling .",
    "many important results on anisotropic spin systems with such coupling have been obtained using the bethe ansatz . initially the emphasis was placed on systems without defects @xcite or with defects on the edge of a spin chain @xcite .",
    "more recently these studies have been extended to systems with defects that are described by integrable hamiltonians @xcite .",
    "however , the problem of a spin chain with several coupled excitations and with defects of a general type has not been solved .    in this paper",
    "we investigate interacting excitations in an anisotropic spin system with defects .",
    "we show that the excitation localized on a defect does not decay even where the decay is allowed by energy conservation .",
    "we also find that , in addition to a single - particle excitation , a defect leads to the onset of two types of localized two - particle excitations .",
    "the analysis is done for a system with the @xmath0 coupling .",
    "the coupling anisotropy is assumed to be strong , as in the case of a qc based on electrons on helium , for example @xcite .",
    "the ground state of the system corresponds to all spins pointing in the same direction ( downwards , for concreteness ) .",
    "a single - particle excitation corresponds to one qubit being excited , or one spin being flipped .",
    "if the qubit energies are tuned in resonance with each other , a qc behaves as an ideal spin system with no disorder .",
    "a single - particle excitation is then magnon - type , it freely propagates through the system .    in the opposite case where",
    "the qubit energies are tuned far away from each other ( as for diagonal disorder in tight - binding models ) , all single - particle excitations are localized . if the excitation density is high , the interaction between them may affect their localization , leading to quantum chaos , cf .",
    "understanding the interplay between interaction and disorder is a prerequisite for building a qc .",
    "we will consider the case where the excitation density is low , yet the interaction is important . in particular , excitations may form bound pairs ( but the pair density is small ) .",
    "one of the important questions is whether the interaction leads to delocalization of excitations .",
    "more specifically , consider an excitation , which is localized on a defect in the absence of other excitations .",
    "we now create an extended magnon - type excitation ( a propagating wave ) , that can be scattered off the localized one .",
    "the problem is whether this will cause the excitation to move away from the defect .",
    "we show below that , due to unexpected destructive quantum interference , the scattering does not lead to delocalization .",
    "we consider a one - dimensional array of qubits which models a spin-1/2 chain .",

    "we will consider effects due to a single defect . respectively , all on - site spin - flip energies @xmath17 are assumed to be the same except for the site @xmath18 where the defect is located , that is , @xmath19    in order to formulate the problem of interaction - induced decay of localized excitations , we preview in fig .
