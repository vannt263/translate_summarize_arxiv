    "the aim of this paper is the derivation of macroscopic hyperbolic models of biological tissues from the underlying description at the microscopic scale delivered by kinetic theory methods .",
    "we consider the hyperbolic asymptotic limit for microscopic system that connect the biological parameters , at the level of cells , involved in this level of description .",
    "the first step of the derivation of macroscopic models in biology from the underlying description at the microscopic scale is arguably due to alt  @xcite and othmer , dunbar and alt  @xcite , who introduced a new modeling approach by perturbation of the transport equation by a velocity jump - process , which appears appropriate to model the velocity dynamics of cells modeled as living particles .",
    "this method has been subsequently developed by various authors , among others , we cite  @xcite .",
    "the survey on mathematical challenges on the qualitative and asymptotic analysis of keller and segel type models  @xcite reports an exhaustive bibliography concerning different mathematical approach on the aforementioned topics . the interested reader can find a further updating of the research activity on the study of keller - segel models and their developments in  @xcite , as well as on applications to population dynamics with diffusion  @xcite and pattern formation in cancer  @xcite .",
    "different time - space scalings lead to equations characterized by different parabolic or hyperbolic structures .",
    "different combinations of parabolic and hyperbolic scales also are used , according to the dispersive or non - dispersive nature of the biological system under consideration .",
    "the parabolic ( low - field ) limit of kinetic equations leads to a drift - diffusion type system ( or reaction - diffusion system ) in which the diffusion process dominate the behavior of the solutions@xcite .",
    "on the other hand , in the hyperbolic ( high - field ) limit the influence of the diffusion terms is of lower ( or equal ) order of magnitude in comparison with other convective or interaction terms .",
    "possible applications refer to modeling cell invasion , as well as chemotaxis and haptotaxis phenomena and related pattern formation@xcite .",
    "models with finite propagation speed appear to be consistent with physical reality rather than parabolic models .",
    "this feature is also induced by the essential characteristics of living organisms who have the ability to sense signals in the environment and adapt their movements accordingly .",
    "our analysis is quite general as it can be applied to different species in response to multiple ( chemo)tactic cues @xcite .",
    "therefore , the derivation of hyperbolic models can contribute to further improvements in modeling biological reality .",
    "in fact , it seems that the approach introduced by patlak  @xcite and keller - segel @xcite is not always sufficiently precise to describe some structures as the evolution of bacteria movements , or the human endothelial cells movements on matrigel that lead to the formation of networks interpreted as the beginning of a vasculature @xcite .",
    "these structures can not be explained by parabolic models , which generally lead to pointwise blow - up  @xcite , moreover the numerical experiments show the predictability of the hyperbolic models in this context .",
    "we now briefly describe the contents of this paper .",
    "section 2 , presents the kinetic model and the scaling deemed to provide the general framework appropriate to derive , by asymptotic analysis , models at the macroscopic scale .",
    "section 3 , referring to  @xcite , presents the general kinetic framework to be used toward the asymptotic analysis .",

    "the case @xmath17 corresponds to a steady state assumption for @xmath16 .",
    "the problem of studying the relationships between the various scales of description , seems to be one of the most important problems of the mathematical modelling of complex systems .",
    "different structures at the macroscopic scale can be obtained corresponding to different spacetime scales .",
    "subsequently , more detailed assumptions on the biological interactions lead to different models of pattern formation . however , a more recent tendency been the use hyperbolic equations to describe intermediate regimes at the macroscopic level rather than parabolic equations , for example @xcite .    the next section deals with the derivation of macroscopic equations using a champan - enskog type perturbation approach for @xmath18 and a closure by minimization method for @xmath19 .",
