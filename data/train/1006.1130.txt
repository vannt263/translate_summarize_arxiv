    "it is clear that illuminated hydrocarbon molecules around stars with different effective temperature are chemically different .",
    "herbig ae stars are by nature strong photospheric uv emitters . because of the rather low accretion rates in most targets , the additional uv excess due to accretion energy dissipation is relatively unimportant for these stars .",
    "we can therefore consider the effective temperature as a direct indicator of the stellar uv radiation field .",
    "strong uv radiation appears to preferentially destroy or convert the aliphatic component in the disks .",
    "photodestruction of the ch bonds is expected from laboratory experiments ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "this effect is stronger for aliphatic molecules , as aromatic rings give more stability to the molecule by allowing distribution of the uv - induced excitation energy .",
    "this is consistent with the lower line fluxes of the 8.6-@xmath0mfeature relative to the aliphatic ch features observed in cooler stars .",
    "the disappearance of the 6.8 and 7.2-@xmath0mfeatures , both linked to ch bonds in aliphatic hydrocarbons , could therefore point to a more rapid dehydrogenation of the aliphatic molecules , rather than a complete removal of this component .",
    "however , the experiments of @xcite show that the aromatic ch bonds are also eventually destroyed by the uv radiation .",
    "the aromatic feature at 8.6@xmath0mshould therefore become weaker with increasing uv strength as well .",
    "the opposite trend is observed : sources with strong uv fields display a higher aromatic ch / cc flux ratio .",
    "we note that this interpretation relies on the identification of the 8.6-@xmath0mfeature as due to aromatic ch modes .",
    "alternatively , it may be that also aromatic cc modes contribute to its strength .",
    "in the latter case , the observations show that the aromatic hydrocarbons undergo structural changes induced by uv field , resulting in class  a features and an increased contribution of cc modes to the 8.6-@xmath0mfeature .",
    "the observed increase in the aromatic ch strength at higher temperatures is consistent with experimental work by @xcite , who suggest that the heating of carbon grains should reduce the number of aliphatic ch bonds and increase the number of aromatic ch bonds .",
    "also uv irradiance increase the relative degree of aromatic clustering , but in thermal annealing at temperatures above 300k , this increase is accompanied with a growth of the graphitic clusters . under uv irradiation ,",
    "the clusters remain small @xcite .    in diffuse",
    "interstellar clouds , large ( @xmath19  c atoms ) pahs are expected to have normal hydrogen coverage ( i.e.  one h atom per peripheral c atom ; aromatic bond ) , while very large pahs may be fully hydrogenated ( i.e.  two h atoms ; aliphatic bond , * ? ? ?",
    "the transition of full to normal hydrogen coverage could occur through uv photolysis of the aliphatic ch bonds and replacement with aromatic ch bonds .",
    "this would reduce the aliphatic fingerprint in the infrared spectrum and pump the aromatic ch / cc ratio . because uv processing keeps the cluster sizes small , thermal annealing",
    "may be needed to grow the clusters and increase the aromatic ch emission strength .",
    "the observational trends in our sample then indicate that not only uv photodestruction , but also thermal annealing of carbon grains and hydrogenation in the uv - shielded disk interior , is important in circumstellar disks around herbig ae stars .",
    "in this paper , we have investigated hydrocarbon emission in the spitzer irs spectra of a sample of 53 herbig ae stars .",
    "we find that 70% of the sources display pah emission , and 55% aliphatic features at 6.8 and/or 7.2@xmath0 m .",
    "five targets ( 9% ) display a feature complex at 1619@xmath0 m .",
    "below we list our main conclusions .",
    "* we confirm the correlation between the pah feature - to - stellar luminosity ratio and the shape of the infrared spectral energy distribution , first mentioned by @xcite .",
    "pahs are a tracer of the gas disk , while the sed probes the thermal dust emission .",
    "if the dust and gas disk are colocated , the trend indicates that the illuminated surface of a flared disk is larger than that of a flattened disk .",
    "the volume occupied by excited pahs is therefore larger in the first group .",
    "it is suggested in the literature that sources with settled dust disks can nonetheless produce strong pah emission if their gas disk is still flared and exposed to stellar uv flux .",
    "this could explain the existence of the few targets with flattened dust disks but strong pah emission .",
    "however , most targets follow the general trend .",
    "we conclude that pahs in the dust - poor disk atmosphere are either rapidly removed from the gas phase , or that the gas and dust in most disks are well coupled and settle together .",
    "* the stellar radiation field determines the chemistry of the hydrocarbon population in the circumstellar disk .",
    "ranked according to increasing stellar effective temperature , the infrared spectra of herbig ae stars show an increase of the aromatic ch emission , but a decrease of the aliphatic ch emission .",
    "aliphatic ch bonds are more easily destroyed than aromatic ch bonds , which explains the decrease in aliphatic signature .",
    "however , this effect can not explain the increase in the aromatic ch / cc ratio with increasing uv strength .",
    "the solution may be found in thermal annealing and the hydrogenation balance of the pahs .",
    "the latter can only influence the pah chemistry if turbulent vertical mixing is important at the disk s surface , and brings pah molecules from uv - immersed regions to the disk interior and back . *",
    "the 6.2 and 7.8-@xmath0mcc features are redder in cooler stars .",
    "the link with the relative strength of the aliphatic features indicates that the wavelength shift indeed is a measure for the aliphatic / aromatic content ratio of the hydrocarbon mixture . * the strong connection between spectral fingerprint and stellar effective temperature shows that hydrocarbons immediately react to the uv field to which they are exposed .",
    "therefore , the chemistry of hydrocarbon molecules does not in general trace disk evolution .",
    "however , the observations indicate that targets with a flattened dust disk harbor hydrocarbons which may be more processed .",
    "they appear to have rougher molecular edges and/or are smaller than those in flared dust disks .",
    "we have expanded the knowledge of the chemistry of hydrocarbon molecules in disks .",
    "once irradiated , the free - flying molecules are quickly chemically altered by the stellar uv field and their history is deleted .",
    "however , pahs in disks must have a significant aliphatic component when they are appear at the disk surface .",
    "laboratory experiments have shown that the formation of aliphatic ( ch@xmath3 ) groups on the edges of pah molecules can already occur under very mild conditions ( * ? ? ?",
    "* t @xmath20 400k ) .",
    "such conditions are available in the warm regions of disks around herbig ae stars , which makes it probable that in - situ production and ( re-)hydrogenation of the hydrocarbon mixture are processes which take place below the disk surface .",

    "<S> the chemistry of astronomical hydrocarbons , responsible for the well - known infrared emission features detected in a wide variety of targets , remains enigmatic . </S>",

    "<S> there are indications that the strength of the 11.3-@xmath0mfeature also depends on dust disk structure , with flattened disks being less bright in this feature . </S>",
    "<S> we confirm that the cc bond features at 6.2 and 7.8@xmath0mshift to redder wavelengths with decreasing stellar effective temperature . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , we show that this redshift is accompanied by a relative increase of aliphatic ch emission and a decrease of the aromatic 8.6-@xmath0mch feature strength . </S>",
    "<S> cool stars in our sample are surrounded by hydrocarbons with a high aliphatic / aromatic ch ratio and a low aromatic ch / cc ratio , and vice versa for the hot stars . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that , while the overall hydrocarbon emission strength depends on the dust disk s geometry , the relative differences seen in the ir emission features in disks around herbig ae stars are mainly due to chemical differences of the hydrocarbon molecules induced by the stellar uv field . </S>",
