    "simulation of hadron production at low energies ( @xmath1 gev ) is relevant for various physical problems . as the cross - section in this region",
    "is considered to be saturated with intermediate resonances , it is possible to study the properties of these resonances through mass , momentum and angular distributions .",
    "simulation of different channels allows one to better account for selection rules and interference effects .",
    "in particular , the problem of measuring r ( total cross - section of @xmath0 annihilation into hadrons ) is a crucial information for contemporary high energy physics , especially for the @xmath2 problem @xcite . at low energies this value",
    "can only be obtained from an experiment .",
    "simulation allows to calculate the ratios between different channels and estimate the accuracy of measurements",
    ".    of other related problems we can highlight the studies of @xmath3 at @xmath4 and @xmath5 decays allowing to check the vector current conservation hypothesis in the standard model @xcite , studies of the @xmath6 decay mode as well as @xmath7- and @xmath8-meson decays .",
    "at this moment there is no theory , describing the strong interactions reliably at low energies .",
    "we used a common phenomenological approach , assuming the production of a final state in consequent resonance decays : + @xmath9 only tree - level diagrams including 2- and 3-body decays , are considered ; + @xmath9 there may be several interfering mechanisms ( e.g. @xmath10 ) which may contribute to different final states ( e.g. @xmath11,@xmath12 ) in accordance with charge and strong isospin conservation ; + @xmath9 possible permutations of final particles are taken into account .",
    "+ to simplify adding new matrix elements , we introduced the following requirements : + @xmath9 the tensor structures are chosen according to the field transformation properties ( spin , isospin , parities ) ; + @xmath9 expressions for matrix elements are written in gauge - invariant form with the help of specialized tensor library ( e.g. , @xmath13 ) ; + @xmath9 indices contraction and particles permutations are performed by the software . + allowed charge states and relative phases of permutations are based on the strong isospin part of the matrix element .",
    "scalar parts of propagators may have arbitrary forms , including form - factors and dependence of width on virtuality . in case of the vector intial state ( @xmath14 )",
    ", the absolute value of the transverse part of hadronic current is used as the value of matrix element .",
    "several interfering matrix elements with arbitrary complex relative coefficients may be used .",
    "by now the package has been used to calculate 4 and 6-pion production cross - sections in @xmath0-collisions .",
