    "recently it has been conjectured that a non - perturbative formulation of m theory may be realized as a large-@xmath3 supersymmetric matrix model @xcite formulated in the light - cone hamiltonian approach . in this paper",

    "we start by considering @xmath5 coupled to dirac adjoint fermions . here",
    ", the virtual creation of fermion - antifermion pairs is not suppressed in the large-@xmath3 limit  in contrast to the case for fermions in the fundamental representation @xcite  and so one may study the structure of boundstates beyond the valence quark ( or quenched ) approximation .",
    "we also anticipate that the techniques employed here will have special interest in the context of solving supersymmetric matrix theories .",
    "the @xmath5 theory coupled to adjoint fermions may be reduced to a @xmath1 dimensional field theory by stipulating that all fields are independent of the transverse coordinates @xmath6 .",
    "the resulting theory is @xmath7 coupled to two @xmath1 dimensional complex adjoint spinor fields , and two real adjoint scalars .",
    "one also finds yukawa interactions between the scalars and fermion fields .",
    "while this approach is not equivalent to solving the full @xmath4 theory and then going to the regime where @xmath8 is relatively small , it may share many qualitative features of the higher dimensional theory , since the longitudinal dynamics is treated exactly .",
    "studies of this type for pure glue and with fundamental quarks have yielded a number of interesting results @xcite .",
    "the unique features of light - front quantization @xcite make it a potentially powerful tool for the nonperturbative study of quantum field theories .",
    "the main advantage of this approach is the apparent simplicity of the vacuum state . indeed",
    ", naive kinematic arguments suggest that the physical vacuum is trivial on the light front .",
    "since in this case all fields transform in the adjoint representation of @xmath0 , the gauge group of the theory is actually @xmath9 , which has nontrivial topology and vacuum structure . for the particular gauge group @xmath10",
    "this has been discussed elsewhere @xcite .",
    "while this vacuum structure may in fact be relevant for a discussion on condensates , for the purposes of this calculation they will be ignored .    in the first section",
    "we formulate the @xmath4 dimensional @xmath0 yang - mills theory and then perform dimensional reduction to obtain a @xmath1 dimensional matrix field theory .",
    "the light - cone hamiltonian is then derived for the light - cone gauge @xmath2 following a discussion of the physical degrees of freedom of the theory .",
    "singularities from coulomb interactions are regularized in a natural way , and we outline how particular `` ladder - relations '' take care of potentially troubling singularities for vanishing longitudinal momenta @xmath11 . a short section on exact massless solutions of the boundstate integral equations is given .",
    "in the final section we discuss and present the numerical results of our work , including mass spectra , evidence for phase transitions at certain critical couplings , and the behavior of polarized and unpolarized structure functions for the lightest meson - like and baryon - like boundstates .",
    "we first consider @xmath4 dimensional @xmath0 yang - mills coupled to a dirac spinor field whose components transform in the adjoint representation of @xmath0 : @xmath12 \\ ; , \\label{3 + 1theory}\\ ] ] where @xmath13 $ ] and @xmath14 $ ] . we also write @xmath15 where @xmath16 is normalized such that @xmath17 . the projection operators , and @xmath18 . ]",

    "the dimensional reduction of the original @xmath4 dimensional theory yields the canonical values @xmath51 .",

    "note that @xmath59 should be distinguished from @xmath60 , since in the former the quantum conjugate operator @xmath61 acts on ( color ) indices , while it does not in the latter .",
    "the latter formalism is sometimes customary in the study of matrix models .",
    "the precise connection between the usual gauge theory and matrix theory formalism may be stated as follows : @xmath62 the commutation and anti - commutation relations ( in matrix formalism ) for the boson and fermion fields take the following form in the large-@xmath3 limit ( @xmath63 ; @xmath64 ) : @xmath65 = \\ { b_{h ij}(k ) , b_{h ' kl}^{\\dagger}({\\tilde k } ) \\ } = \\ { d_{h ij}(k ) , d_{h ' kl}^{\\dagger}({\\tilde k } ) \\ } = \\delta _ { h h ' } \\delta_{jl}\\delta_{ik } \\delta(k-{\\tilde k } ) , \\label{rhccrs}\\ ] ] where have used the relation @xmath66 .",
    "all other ( anti)commutators vanish .",
    "the fock space of physical states is generated by the color singlet states , which have a natural ` closed - string ' interpretation .",
    "they are formed by a color trace of the fermion , antifermion and boson operators acting on the vacuum state @xmath67 .",
    "multiple string states couple to the theory with strength @xmath68 , and so may be ignored .",
    "for the special case @xmath69 , the light - cone hamiltonian is simply given by the current - current term @xmath70 in equation ( [ hamiltonian ] ) . in momentum space",

    "it should be stressed , however , that several @xmath74 parton processes are suppressed by a factor @xmath68 , and so are ignored in the large-@xmath3 limit .",
    "no terms involving @xmath75 parton interactions are suppressed in this limit , however .",
    "one can show that this hamiltonian conserves total helicity @xmath76 , which is an additive quantum number .",
    "moreover , the number of fermions _ minus _ the number of antifermions is also conserved in each interaction , and so we have an additional quantum number @xmath77 .",
    "states with @xmath78 will be referred to as _ meson - like _ states , while the quantum number @xmath79 will define _ baryon - like _ states .",
    "the instantaneous coulomb interactions involving @xmath74 parton interactions behave singularly when there is a zero exchange of momentum between identical ` in ' and ` out ' states .",
    "the same type of coulomb singularity involving @xmath74 boson - boson interactions appeared in a much simpler model @xcite , and can be shown to cancel a ` self - induced ' mass term ( or self - energy ) obtained from normal ordering the hamiltonian .",
    "the same prescription works in the model studied here .",
    "there are also finite residual terms left over after this cancellation is explicitly performed for the boson - boson and boson - fermion interactions , and they can not be absorbed by a redefinition of existing coupling constants .",
    "these residual terms behave as momentum - dependent mass terms , and in some sense represent the flux - tube energy between adjacent partons in a color singlet state . for the boson - boson and boson - fermion interactions they are respectively",
    "@xmath80 where @xmath81 denote boson momenta , and @xmath82 denotes a fermion momentum .",
    "these terms simply multiply the wavefunctions in the boundstate integral equations .",
    "if we now include the contributions @xmath83 in the light - cone hamiltonian ( [ hamiltonian ] ) , then we will encounter another type of singularity for vanishing longitudinal momenta @xmath84 .",
    "this singular behavior can be shown to cancel a ( divergent ) momentum - dependent mass term , which is obtained after normal ordering the @xmath85 interactions and performing an appropriate ( infinite ) renormalisation of the bare coupling @xmath52 .",
    "this momentum - dependent mass term has the explicit form @xmath86 the mechanism for cancellation here is different from the coulombic case , since we will require specific endpoint relations relating different wavefunctions . before outlining the general prescription for implementing this cancellation",
    ", we consider a simple rendering of the boundstate integral equations involving the @xmath85 interactions .",
    "in particular , let us consider the helicity zero sector with @xmath87 , and allow at most three partons .",
    "then the boundstate integral equation governing the behavior of the wavefunction @xmath88 for the two - boson state @xmath89|0\\rangle$ ] takes the form @xmath90 + \\dots\\label{int1 } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath91 , and @xmath92 are ( boost invariant ) longitudinal momentum fractions .",
    "evidently , the integral ( [ int1 ] ) arising from @xmath93 parton interactions behaves singularly for vanishing longitudinal momentum fraction @xmath94 , or @xmath95 .",
    "however , these divergences are precisely canceled by the momentum - dependent mass terms ( [ nom ] ) , which represent the contribution ( [ not2 ] ) .    to see this , we may consider the integral equation governing the wavefunction @xmath96 for the three - parton state @xmath97|0\\rangle$ ] : @xmath98   f_{b_+ d_+ a_-}(x_1,x_2,x_3 ) \\nonumber \\\\ & - & msg \\sqrt{\\frac{n}{2\\pi } }   \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{x_1+x_2 } }   \\left ( \\frac{1}{x_1 }            + \\frac{1}{x_2 } \\right ) f_{a_+ a_-}(x_1+x_2,x_3 ) + \\dots\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] if we now multiply both sides of the above equation by @xmath99 , and then let @xmath100 for @xmath24 , we deduce the relations @xmath101 @xmath102 it is now straightforward to show that the singular behavior of the integral ( [ int1 ] ) involving the wavefunction @xmath103 may be written in terms of a momentum - dependent mass term involving the wavefunction @xmath104 .",
    "similar divergent contributions are obtained from the the wavefunctions @xmath105 , @xmath106 and @xmath107 , all of which may be re - expressed in terms of the wavefunction @xmath104 by virtue of corresponding ` ladder relations ' .",
    "the sum of these divergent contributions exactly cancels the self - energy contribution ( [ nom ] ) .",
    "an entirely analogous set of ladder relations were found for the case of fermions in the fundamental representation of @xmath0 @xcite .    for the general case where states are permitted to have more than three partons , the correct ladder relations are not immediately obvious from an analysis of the integral equations alone .",
    "nevertheless , they may be readily obtained from the constraint equation governing the left - moving fermion field @xmath22 .",
    "in particular , we have @xmath108 , and so vanishing fields at spatial infinity would imply @xmath109 for color singlet states @xmath110 .",
    "the analysis of this condition in momentum space is quite delicate , since it involves integrals of singular wavefunctions over spaces of measure zero @xcite .",
    "viewed in this way we see that the ladder relations are the continuum equivalent of zero mode constraint equations that have shown to lead to spontaneous symmetry breaking in discrete light - cone quantization @xcite .",
    "for the special case , _ except _ @xmath111 , the ladder relations are singular at @xmath112 .",
    "therefore , in the context of the present analysis , we may only omit the fermion mass term if the yukawa interactions are also omitted .",
    "of course , one may consider the limiting case @xmath113 for @xmath114 , but this is at present a numerically intractable problem , and is perhaps better tackled using analytical considerations . ]",
    "@xmath115 , the only surviving terms in the hamiltonian ( [ hamiltonian ] ) are the current - current interactions @xmath70 .",
    "this theory has infinitely many massless boundstates , and the partons in these states are either fermions or antifermions .",
    "states with bosonic @xmath73 quanta are always massive .",
    "one also finds that the massless states are pure , in the sense that the number of partons is a fixed integer , and there is no mixing between sectors of different parton number . in particular , for each integer @xmath116 , one can always find a massless boundstate consisting of a superposition of only @xmath117-parton states .",
    "a striking feature is that the wavefunctions of these states are _ constant _ , and so these states are natural generalizations of the constant wavefunction solution appearing in thooft s model @xcite .",
    "we present an explicit example below of such a constant wavefunction solution involving a three fermion state with total helicity @xmath118 , which is perhaps the simplest case to study .",
    "massless states with five or more partons appear to have more than one wavefunction which are non - zero and constant , and in general the wavefunctions are unequal . it would be interesting to classify all states systematically , and we leave this to future work .",
    "one can , however , easily count the number of massless states . in particular , for @xmath119 , @xmath120 states ,",
    "there is one three - parton state , @xmath121 five - parton states , @xmath122 seven - parton states and @xmath123 nine - parton states that yield massless solutions .",
    "let us now consider the action of the light - cone hamiltonian @xmath42 on the three - parton state @xmath124|0\\rangle\\ ] ] the quantum number @xmath77 is 3 in this case , and ensures that the state @xmath125 must have at least three partons .",
    "in fact , one can deduce the following : @xmath126 \\times \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\frac{1}{n^{3/2}}\\mbox{tr } \\left[b_+^\\dagger(\\alpha)b_+^\\dagger(\\beta)b_+^\\dagger(k_3)\\right ] \\mid 0 \\rangle   \\nonumber \\\\ % % % % % % % % % % % % % % & & + { { g^2 n}\\over 2\\pi}\\int^\\infty_{0 }   d\\alpha d\\beta d\\gamma \\sum_h { \\delta(\\alpha + \\beta + \\gamma - k_1 )   \\over ( \\alpha+\\beta)^2 } f_{b_+ b_+ b_+}(\\alpha + \\beta + \\gamma , k_2,k_3 ) \\times \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\frac{1}{n^{5/2}}\\mbox{tr}\\left [ \\{b_h^\\dagger(\\alpha),d_{-h}^\\dagger(\\beta)\\}b_+^\\dagger(\\gamma ) b_+^\\dagger(k_2)b_+^\\dagger(k_3)-   \\{b_h^\\dagger(\\alpha),d_{-h}^\\dagger(\\beta)\\ } b_+^\\dagger(k_2)b_+^\\dagger(k_3)b_+^\\dagger(\\gamma ) \\right ] \\mid 0 \\rangle \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\nonumber \\\\",

    "the expression ( [ exacts ] ) vanishes if the wavefunction @xmath127 is constant .",
    "one may perform a numerical analysis of the boundstate integral equations by discretising the longitudinal momentum fractions @xmath99 so that @xmath128 , where @xmath129 is some ( ideally ) large positive integer . the problem is then reduced to finite matrix diagonalisation @xcite .    in this initial investigation , we are primarily interested in the qualitative behavior of the theory , and so we make a choice of couplings which we believe summarizes the general properties of the theory . a more detailed study of the coupling - constant space of the theory",
    "will be presented elsewhere @xcite . in fig .",
    "1(a ) we have plotted the mass spectrum for the baryon - like sector @xmath130 with the special choice of couplings @xmath131 .",
    "the horizontal axes @xmath132 represents the average number of partons in a boundstate .",
    "pure massless states of length @xmath133 , @xmath134 , @xmath135,@xmath136 are found , and there is in general a high level of degeneracy .",
    "massless states of length @xmath121 , @xmath137 , @xmath138,@xmath136 appear in the meson - like sector @xmath139 , and the associated spectrum is qualitatively the same . in particular ,",
    "one finds a concentration of states with average length @xmath132 nearly an integer .    in fig .",
    "1(b ) we have allowed the coupling constants @xmath140 and @xmath141 to be non - zero .",
    "there is now a lower trajectory of states concentrated near @xmath142 .",
    "the presence of yukawa interactions means there are @xmath143 parton processes which flip the sign of the helicity for a fermion or antifermion .",
    "this dramatically reduces the high degeneracy exhibited in fig .",
    "these ` helicity - flip ' terms are responsible for the complicated dynamics governing the polarized distribution of fermions and bosons in a given boundstate .",
    "figs 1(c ) and 1(d ) represent plots of the polarized and unpolarized fermion and boson structure functions for the lightest baryon - like boundstate appearing in fig .",
    "these curves are normalized such that the area under the polarized quark structure function _ plus _ the area under the polarized gluon structure function is equal to the total ( conserved ) helicity , which is @xmath144 in this case .",
    "evidently , a better understanding of the small-@xmath145 behaviour of these structure functions can only be achieved if larger values of @xmath129 are investigated , since one expects sea - quarks and small-@xmath145 gluons ( ` wee partons ' ) to contribute significantly to the overall polarization of a boundstate .",
    "finally , in figs 1(e ) and 1(f ) we provide evidence for a phase transition of the field theory if the quartic coupling @xmath49 is sufficiently large and negative . in particular , we observe a regime where the theory sharply becomes tachyonic , and the groundstate has diverging average length @xmath132 . this behavior is entirely consistent with earlier work on the phase transitions of large-@xmath3 matrix models with cubic and quartic interactions @xcite .",
    "we have presented a non - perturbative hamiltonian formulation of a class of @xmath1 dimensional matrix field theories , which may be derived from a classical dimensional reduction of @xmath5 coupled to dirac adjoint fermions .",
    "we choose to adopt the light - cone gauge @xmath2 , and are able to solve numerically the boundstate integral equations in the large-@xmath3 limit .",
    "different states may be classified according to total helicity @xmath76 , and the quantum number @xmath77 , which defines the number of fermions minus the number of antifermions in a state .    for a special choice of couplings that eliminates all interactions except those involving the longitudinal current @xmath146",
    ", we find an infinite number of pure massless states of arbitrary length .",
    "the wavefunctions of these states are always constant , and may be solved for exactly . an example was presented in section iv . in general , a massless solution involves several ( possibly different ) constant wavefunctions .",
    "we anticipate that the massless solutions observed in studies of @xmath1 dimensional supersymmetric field theories @xcite are analogous to the constant wavefunction solutions found here .",
    "when one includes the yukawa interactions , singularities at vanishing longitudinal momenta arise , and we show in a simple case how these are canceled by the boson and fermion self - energies .",
    "this cancellation relies on the derivation of certain ` ladder relations ' , which relate different wavefunctions at vanishing longitudinal momenta .",
    "these relations become singular for vanishing fermion mass @xmath141 , and so in the context of the numerical techniques employed here , one is prevented from studying the limit @xmath113 . analytical techniques which are currently under investigation",
    "are expected to be relevant in this limiting case @xcite .    in the figures 1(a)-(f ) , we have summarized some of the generic features exhibited by these matrix models .",
    "the plot of spectra suggests that the density of states grows with average length .",
    "however , larger values of the cutoff @xmath129 will be necessary before we can draw any firm conclusions .",
    "a particularly important property of these models is that virtual pair creation and annihilation of bosons and fermions is not suppressed in the large-@xmath3 limit , and so our results go beyond the valence quark ( or quenched ) approximation .",
    "this provides the scope for strictly field - theoretic investigations of the internal structure of boundstates where ` sea - quarks ' and small-@xmath145 gluons are expected to contribute significantly to the overall polarization of a boundstate . in this work , we were able to calculate structure functions for the baryon - like and meson - like states , but only for relatively low values of @xmath129 .",
    "the baryon - like state with total helicity @xmath147 perhaps best resembles a nucleon , and so we provide plots of spectra and structure functions in fig.1(a)-(d ) .",
    "the most important aspect of these structure functions is perhaps the behavior at small-@xmath145 , but much larger values of @xmath129 will be necessary in order to probe this region numerically .",
    "the techniques employed here are not specific to the choice of field theory , and are expected to have a wide range of applicability , particularly in the light - cone hamiltonian formulation of supersymmetric field theories .",
