    "the hecke algebras @xmath8 of the symmetric groups are classical objects of study and the most important open problem in their representation theory is to determine the structure of the specht modules @xmath9 where @xmath4 is a partition of @xmath10 . in this area",

    "in particular , results of fayers and martin  @xcite have given us techniques to compute @xmath13 for more general @xmath4 ( which they used in the same paper to give an elementary proof of the carter - payne theorem ) .",
    "in this paper , we extend the most useful of their results to the hecke algebra @xmath0 .",
