    "the results obtained in this paper will be applied to queueing analysis . in general , there are two main performance measures of queueing analysis , one is the number of customers @xmath7 in the system and the other is the sojourn time @xmath8 in the system .",

    "the author already had results on the exponential decay of the tail probability for a discrete random variable @xcite , and those for a general random variable @xcite .",
    "the main theorem in @xcite is as follows .",

    "[ theo:1 ] , we know that the tail probability @xmath9 decays exponentially as @xmath45 .    next , in @xcite , the exponential decay of the tail probability @xmath1 is investigated for a general non - negative real valued random variable @xmath0 .",

    "this is because of the difference of the convergence regions . in theorem",
    "[ theo:1 ] , the boundary of the convergence region of a power series is a circle , which is a compact set , so if the probability generating function is meromorphic , then the singularities on the circle of convergence are necessarily a finite number of poles . on the other hand , in theorem [ theo:2 ] ,",
    "the axis of convergence is not a compact set , so we need some verification to see that the singularities on the axis of convergence are a finite number of poles .",
    "we want some simple sufficient condition to guarantee the exponential decay of the tail probability .",
