    "short - lived radionuclides ( srs ) are radioactive elements with half - lives of the order of 1 myr . their presence in the nascent solar system is inferred from an excess of their daughter isotopes in meteorite components ( russell , gounelle & hutchison 2001 ) .",
    "some srs [ @xmath8be ( t@xmath9 = 1.5 myr ) , @xmath0al ( t@xmath9 = 0.74 myr ) , @xmath10cl ( t@xmath9 = 0.30 myr ) , @xmath11ca ( t@xmath9 = 0.10 myr ) , @xmath12mn ( t@xmath9 = 3.7 myr ) , @xmath2fe ( t@xmath9 = 1.5 myr ) ] were present in the protoplanetary disk at abundances substantially higher than the levels expected for average interstellar medium ( meyer & clayton 2000 ) .",
    "these srs can not therefore be inherited from the interstellar medium and require a last minute origin ( e.g. wadhwa et al . 2007 ) .",
    "the origin of srs is highly debated in the cosmochemistry community , because it has important consequences for e.g. early solar system chronology ( e.g. mckeegan & davis 2004 ; gounelle & russell 2005a , b ) and planetesimal heating ( urey 1955 ; ghosh & mcseen 1998 ) .",
    "in addition , understanding the origin of srs will provide key constraints on the astrophysical environment in which our solar system was born ( e.g. hester & desch 2005 ; goswami et al .",
    "2005 ; gounelle 2006 )",
    ".    generally speaking , srs can be made either by thermal nucleosynthesis , at kev energies in the interior of stars , or by non - thermal nucleosynthesis , i.e. nuclear reactions involving cosmic rays or accelerated particles at mev energy from the sun .",
    "there are therefore two possible sources for short - lived radionuclides in the solar protoplanetary disk : ( a ) injection into the molecular cloud core or protoplanetary disk from a nearby , late - type star ( e.g. busso , gallino & wasserburg 2003 ) , ( b ) _ in situ _ production in the protoplanetary disk by irradiation of dust and gas with accelerated particles from the proto - sun ( e.g. gounelle et al .",
    "2006 ) .",
    "we focus here on the possible delivery of srs by a late type star .",
    "asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) stars are possible candidates ( wasserburg et al .",
    "2006 ) , but this source of srs in the early solar system is considered highly unlikely because of the low probability of an encounter between an agb star and a star forming region ( kastner & myers 1994 ) .",
    "type ii supernovae represent an alternative to agb stars as a source of srs ( cameron et al .",
    "1995 ) .    of models based on a supernova ( sn ) origin for srs",
    "there are two types .",
    "either a sn injects freshly synthesized srs into a nearby molecular cloud core , triggering its gravitational collapse ( cameron & truran 1977 ; cameron et al .",
    "1995 ; boss & vanhala 2000 ) , or directly into a nearby protoplanetary disk ( chevalier 2000 ; hester & desch 2005 ; ouellette et al . 2005 ) . the first sn scenario is now considered less likely because only very specific conditions allow a supernova shockwave to trigger the collapse of a molecular cloud core and , at the same time , inject srs ( e.g. boss & vanhala 2000 ) . in the second scenario , which is currently receiving a lot of attention ( chevalier 2000",
    "; hester & desch 2005 ; ouellette et al . 2005 ; ouellette , desch & hester 2007 ) , the sn has to be very close ( @xmath4 0.3 pc ) to the protoplanetary disk in order to allow the disk to intercept enough sn ejecta to account for the solar system inventory of srs .",
    "it is thus assumed that the massive star , which evolved into a sn , and the protoplanetary disk were coeval and formed in the same stellar cluster ( e.g. hester & desch 2005 ) .",
    "massive stars form in large stellar clusters ( lada & lada 2003 ) .",
    "the nearby sn injection model therefore implies that our sun was born in a large stellar cluster . the orion nebula cluster ( onc )",
    "is often cited as a good analog for such an environment ( hester & desch 2005 ) .    however , if the sun was born in a stellar cluster massive enough to contain a sn , it has important implications for the childhood of our solar system .",
    "massive stars are known to power winds carving large bubbles of hot gas in surrounding cold molecular gas ( weaver et al .",
    ". they also emit large uv fluxes , which create hii blisters in cold molecular gas ( odell 2001 ) and photoevaporate nearby protoplanetary disks ( e.g. johnstone , bally & hollenbach 1998 ) .",
    "the presence of numerous massive stars close to planetary systems can also dynamically modify the orbits of the giant planets and of kuiper belt objects ( e.g. adams & laughlin 2001 ) .",
    "it is therefore essential to evaluate the _ a priori _ probability of our sun to be born in such an harsh astrophysical setting .",
    "adams & laughlin ( 2001 ) estimated the probability of the sun to have been born in a stellar environment large enough to contain a massive star ( which could deliver srs via a sn explosion ) and small enough to preserve both the orbits of the giant planets as well as those of the kuiper belt objects .",
    "these authors made the assumption that _ any _ star more massive than 25 m@xmath13 was able to deliver srs to the solar protoplanetary disk , and they did not place constraints on the time window during which srs were injected into the disk .",
    "the spatial structure of the cluster was not included in this model .",
    "subsequently , williams & gaidos ( 2007 ) provided an estimate for the probability of the nearby sn injection scenario . however",
    "this estimate did not take quantitatively into account the disk photoevaporation and overestimated the time window during which sn injection of srs in a nearby protoplanetary disk can occur .",
    "the present work is organized as follows .",
    "first , we review the cosmochemical constraints on the origin of srs (  2 ) .",
    "second , we present recent observations and models of molecular cloud dynamics , star formation rate , accretion disk lifetime and evolutionary timescales of massive stars pertinent to an evaluation of the proposed onc - like setting for the formation of the solar system (  3 ) .",
    "third , we calculate the probability for a protoplanetary disk attached to a low - mass star to receive srs from a nearby sn at the levels inferred for the early solar system , with the necessary constraints that sr delivery happens within the time window specified by the cosmochemical data , and that the disk is not destroyed by uv photoevaporation (  4 ) .",
    "our model assumptions and limitations are discussed in section  5 . in section",
    " 6 we present the implications of our findings for the origin of short - lived radionuclides .",
    "among the srs that could have been delivered by a supernova to the protoplanetary disk around the young sun , @xmath0al provides the strongest constraint on the timing of such an event ( e.g. wadhwa et al .",
    "2007 ; russell et al . 2006 ) .",
    "aluminium-26 is more abundant in primitive chondrite components , such as calcium- , aluminium - rich inclusions ( cais ) and chondrules ( e.g. galy et al .",
    "2000 ) than in more evolved asteroidal crustal rocks ( e.g. srinivasan et al . 1999 ) .",
    "cais have the oldest measured pb - pb ages of any solid matter in the solar system ( bouvier et al . 2007 ) .",
    "some iron meteorites , believed to sample the cores of differentiated asteroids , have model hf - w ages as old as those of cais ( markowski et al .",
    "they must therefore have formed contemporaneously with cais .",
    "this implies that @xmath0al , which is believed to have been the main heat source responsible for asteroidal differentiation , was present in the protoplanetary disk already at the time of iron meteorite parent - asteroid accretion ( bottke et al .",
    "both observations suggest that @xmath0al was present in the protoplanetary disk from the early stages of its evolution , certainly as far back in time as the meteorite record can bring us ( e.g. wadhwa et al .",
    "2007 ; russell et al . 2006 ) .",
    "although the exact timescale is not known , it is reasonable to assume that if @xmath0al was delivered to the solar system from a sn source , this injection occurred during the class 0 or class i stage of our protosun ( e.g. montmerle et al .",
    "the combined duration of the class 0 and class i phases is @xmath4 10@xmath14 yr . here",
    "we will conservatively assume that the sn delivery of srs to the protoplanetary disk occurred within a time interval , @xmath15 , of @xmath4 1 myr after the formation of the disk ( see also ouellette et al .",
    "2005 ; looney , tobin & fields 2006 ) .",
    "the distance @xmath16 between the sn and the protoplanetary disk can not be too small , otherwise the disk will be destroyed by the impact of the ejecta .",
    "nor can this distance be too large because this would limit the amount of injected srs .",
    "there is a restricted distance interval , the minimum ( @xmath17 ) and the maximum ( @xmath18 ) acceptable distance between the sn and protoplanetary disk , referred to as the enrichment zone , which satisfies these two important constraints .",
    "chevalier ( 2000 ) estimated that at distances smaller than @xmath19 pc , momentum transfer between the sn ejecta and the disk will cause the later to be stripped away .",
    "based on 2d numerical simulations , ouellette , desch & hester ( 2007 ) concluded that a disk as close as 0.1 pc from a 25 m@xmath13 sn can survive disruption . for the minimum distance , @xmath17 , we will adopt a conservative value of 0.1 pc .    the maximum distance @xmath18 , below which the protoplanetary disk receives enough srs to account for solar system abundances depends on a limited number of parameters . though it is beyond the scope of the present paper to explicitly derive @xmath18 ,",
    "we indicate how it can be calculated and summarize the estimates given by several groups ( ouellette et al .",
    "2005 ; looney , tobin & fields 2006 ) .    for any radionuclide ,",
    "the mixing fraction , @xmath20 , of the supernova ejecta mixed into the protoplanetary disk is : @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the initial mass of the radionuclide in the solar system ( in m@xmath13 ) , y@xmath23 is the total yield of the radionuclide from the considered supernova ( in m@xmath13 ) , @xmath24 is the mean life , @xmath25 the injection efficiency and @xmath26 is the time interval between the end of nucleosynthesis in the supernova and incorporation into refractory meteorite components ( cais ) . note that @xmath27 as @xmath28 and @xmath29 ( see below ) . following cameron et al .",
    "( 1995 ) , we translate the mixing fraction @xmath20 into a geometrical relationship , @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the size of the disk and @xmath32 the distance between the disk and the massive star . putting these two expressions together ,",
    "we obtain the general expression : @xmath33    @xmath34 is estimated from the disk mass , the solar abundances and the initial abundance of the considered radionuclide identified to that of cais ( e.g. gounelle & meibom 2007 ) . using sn yields calculated by state - of - the art nucleosynthetic models corresponding to a large range of progenitor masses and metallicities ( rauscher et al .",
    "2002 ; woosley & weaver 1995 ) , and assuming an injection efficiency of 1 , looney , tobin & fields ( 2006 ) as well as ouellette et al .",
    "( 2005 ) calculate that the solar protoplanetary disk had to be at a distance between 0.02 and 0.3 pc from the massive star for disk sizes varying between 30 and 100 au .",
    "@xmath26 is constrained by the decay of short - lived radionuclides and is of the order of @xmath4 1 myr .",
    "note that the disk size can not be significantly larger than 100 au because , before any injection occurs , the disk has been sitting nearby a strongly ionizing o star for some myr ( see section [ sec - orion ] ) , resulting in severe disk truncation ( ouellette et al . 2005 ) .",
    "the alternative case of larger disks examined by looney , tobin & fields ( 2006 ) is therefore not relevant here . for more realistic values of @xmath25 ( i.e. @xmath35 1 )",
    "the injection distance is reduced to values approaching the minimum acceptable distance ( 0.1 pc ) , which would cause a problem with regard to disk survivability .",
    "we will consider here that a generous maximum distance between the protoplanetary disk and the supernova is @xmath18 = 0.4 pc .",
    "therefore , the acceptable distance interval for which the sn explosion delivers srs at the level observed in the solar system , but does not destroy the protoplanetary disk is quite narrow .",
    "the enrichment zone lies therefore between @xmath17 = 0.1 pc and @xmath18 = 0.4 pc .",
    "the orion nebular cluster is the epitome of a massive star forming region in the solar neighborhood , often invoked as an analog for the birthplace of our sun ( hester & desch 2005 ; ouellette et al .",
    "2005 ; bally , moeckel & throop 2005 ) .",
    "the onc is dominated by the four bright trapezium o and b stars , which are named @xmath36 and numbered from a to d ( odell 2001 ) .",
    "it is situated @xmath4 450 pc away from the sun and contains roughly half a dozen stars massive enough to end their lives as sn ( hillenbrand 1997 ) . in the onc ,",
    "the most massive object is the o7 star @xmath36_c _ ori , which has a mass of @xmath37 m@xmath13 . within @xmath38 pc of @xmath36_c",
    "_ ori are thousands of low - mass protostars , @xmath39% of which have disks ( hillenbrand et al .",
    "1998 ) . some of the disks are as close as a few tenths of a parsec from @xmath36_c _ ori .",
    "though evolving on substantially shorter timescales than low - mass stars , high mass stars still need a finite time to complete hydrogen and helium burning , and explode in a sn ( schaller et al .",
    "1992 ; romano et al .",
    "it takes @xmath37 myr for a @xmath40 m@xmath13 b3 star and @xmath41 myr for an extremely massive @xmath42 m@xmath13 o3 star to reach the sn stage respectively . a @xmath43 m@xmath13 star , such as @xmath36_c _",
    "ori , evolves for @xmath44 myr before it goes supernova ( figure [ fig - schaller ] ) .",
    "the age of the onc is estimated to be @xmath5 1 myr ( e.g. hillenbrand 1997 ) .",
    "the age of @xmath36_c _ ori is not precisely known , although this star is probably among the youngest members of the onc , because early formation of @xmath36_c _ ori would have halted star formation through rapid photoionization of the surrounding gas ( odell 2001 ; boss & goswami 2007 ) .",
    "odell ( 2001 ) argues that @xmath36_c _ ori is _ the _ youngest star in the onc cluster .",
    "palla & stalher ( 2001 ) determined the age of another trapezium star , @xmath36_d _ ori , and find an upper limit of 0.1 myr . here",
    "it is conservatively assumed that @xmath45_c _ ori is 1 myr old and will go sn 5 myr after the onset of star formation in the onc , i.e. @xmath4 4 myr from now .",
    "the protoplanetary disks that are currently within a few tenths of a parsec from @xmath36_c _ ori will suffer severe mass - loss due to photoevaporation driven by the uv radiation from this and other massive stars in the region ( johnstone , hollenbach & bally 1998 ; strzer & hollenbach 1999 ; richling & yoke 2000 ; balog et al . 2007 ) .",
    "typical mass loss rates due to photoevaporation are 10@xmath46 m@xmath13/yr ( johnstone , hollenbach & bally 1998 ; strzer & hollenbach 1999 ) . the typical lifetime of a minimum mass solar nebula of mass 0.01 m@xmath13 ( hayashi et al .",
    "1985 ) in such an environment is therefore @xmath4 10@xmath14 yr .",
    "johnstone , hollenbach & bally ( 1998 ) studied the specific case of @xmath36_c _ ori and showed that , at a distance of 0.3 pc , a protoplanetary disk would shrink to a size of about 1 au in about 1 myr , i.e. well before @xmath36_c _ ori becomes a sn .",
    "disk evaporation simply prevents injection of sn ejecta because disks in the vicinity of the sn have essentially disappeared before the sn explosion takes place .",
    "it is possible that disks adjacent to @xmath36_c _ ori could partially survive photo - evaporation if their orbits around the massive star are highly elliptical rather than circular ( e.g. adams & bloch 2005 ) , or if the photo - evaporation rate decreases rapidly with time ( e.g. adams et al . 2006 ) .",
    "however , in 4 myr from now , when @xmath36_c _ ori goes supernova , such surviving disks will be highly evolved , harboring large planetesimals as well as giant planets ( e.g. montmerle et al .",
    "2006 ) . in an orion - like setting",
    ", planetary formation is accelerated by photoevaporation ( throop & bally 2005 ) , reducing accordingly the time window for sr injection .",
    "disks which survive evaporation will therefore not receive srs from the sn explosion until very late in their evolution , inconsistent with cosmochemical evidence for early delivery , which indicates that the injection happened within 1 myr of disk formation ( see section [ sec - prolog ] ) .    over the next @xmath47 million years",
    ", there will be few new low - mass stars forming within 1 pc of @xmath36_c _ ori .",
    "star formation is certainly more vigorous during the first myr of a molecular cloud lifetime and decreases sharply with time ( see lada & lada 2003 ) .",
    "after a few myr , the gas in a molecular cloud has dissipated , and new star formation no longer takes place ( leisawitz , bash & thaddeus 1989 ; elmegreen 2000 ; hartmann , ballesteros - paredes & bergin 2001 ; lada & lada 2003 ) . winds from massive stars and outflows from low - mass stars are primarily responsible for the quick dissipation of the molecular gas ( bally , moeckel & throop 2005 ) .",
    "in fact , young clusters , such as ngc1333 and serpens , contain relatively large populations of class 0 sources and are rich in bipolar flows , both features indicative of the earliest stages of star formation ( e.g. knee & sandell 2000 ; sandell & knee 2001 ) .",
    "in contrast , older clusters , such as ic348 , contain few protostellar sources and outflows ( lada & lada 2003 ) .",
    "the fraction of disks in a given cluster , which is homologous to the star formation rate , also steeply decreases with the cluster age ( see figure 1 of haisch , lada & lada 2001 ) .",
    "the decrease with time of the star forming rate is even more dramatic in the immediate vicinity of a massive star ( @xmath48 few pc ) than at the global molecular cloud scale .",
    "hillenbrand ( 1997 ) argues that star formation in the trapezium , i.e. in the vicinity of @xmath36_c _ ori , is now over . more generally , star formation can not occur in the absence of molecular gas , which is ionized by the enhanced uv flux of massive stars .",
    "wren & odell ( 1995 ) estimate that the ionized hii region created by @xmath36_c _",
    "ori is now @xmath49 pc wide and is growing at the rate of @xmath50 km / s . within the next @xmath47 myr",
    ", this region will expand to a @xmath4 @xmath51 pc wide hii cavity around @xmath36_c _ ori , where star formation will be effectively halted .",
    "hillenbrand & hartmann ( 1998 ) estimate that the @xmath4 1 pc wide gaseous region surrounding @xmath36_c _ ori will be photoevaporated on a timescale of @xmath5 1 myr .",
    "it is not only the ionizing power of massive stars , such as @xmath45_c _ ori , that contributes to the sharp decrease in star formation rate in their immediate vicinity .",
    "the winds emanating from the massive stars create bubbles .",
    "the linear dimension of a wind bubble increases with the mass of the star ( chevalier 1999 ) .",
    "a 20 m@xmath13 star creates a cavity as large as 11 pc in 7 myr ( chevalier 1999 ) , suggesting that the molecular gas surrounding @xmath36_c _ ori will be dissipated by winds in addition to photoionization on timescales significantly shorter than the lifetime of @xmath36_c _ ori .",
    "after a few myr of evolution , star formation in onc - like settings occurs mainly in photo - dissociation regions ( pdrs ) at the interface of the hii region and the molecular gas ( healy , hester & claussen 2004 ) , a few parsecs away from the massive star .",
    "the fate of the onc is well illustrated by the 2 - 3 myr old ngc2244 cluster , whose most massive star , hd206267 , has the same spectral type as @xmath45_c _ ori . in ngc2244 ,",
    "star formation is occurring in the outskirts of the cluster , at distances 5 - 10 pc from the central o6 star ( hartmann 2005 ) .",
    "in addition , reach et al .",
    "( 2004 ) note that these stars , which formed @xmath4 2 myr before hd206267 goes supernova , are the last generation of stars forming in the cluster .",
    "low - mass stars formed 3 myr after the onset of star formation in a given molecular cloud are too far away to be contaminated by srs at any significant level .",
    "figure [ fig - sketch ] illustrates the discrepancy between the timescales of massive star evolution and low - mass star formation for an onc - like setting .",
    "in this section , we calculate two numbers : ( 1 ) within a cluster of a given size @xmath52 , what is the probability for a young disk ( @xmath5 1 myr ) attached to a low - mass star to be contaminated in srs by a nearby supernova explosion at the level observed in the early solar system ?",
    "( 2 ) what is the probability for _ any _ protoplanetary disk in the galaxy to be contaminated in srs from a nearby sn explosion at the level observed in the solar system ?",
    "the latter number will be calculated by integrating the former with the cluster size distribution ( section [ sec - any ] ) .    the probability for a disk surrounding a low - mass star in a cluster of a given size ( @xmath52 ) to be enriched in srs by a nearby supernova at the observed solar system abundance without being disrupted by uv photoevaporation is given by the expression : @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the fraction of young ( @xmath5 1 myr ) low mass stars ( or young stellar objects ) present in the cluster at the time ( @xmath55 ) of the supernova explosion , @xmath56 is the fraction of low - mass stars present in the enrichment zone , @xmath57 is the fraction of disks which have survived uv photoevaporation and @xmath58 is the probability that the most massive star in a cluster containing @xmath52 stars has a mass @xmath59 .",

    "the second expression for @xmath94(t ) is a linearly decreasing function , terminating on a timescale of t = @xmath47 myr , due to molecular gas dissipation ( leisawitz , bash & thaddeus 1989 ; elmegreen 2000 ; hartmann , ballesteros - paredes & bergin 2001 ; lada & lada 2003 ) . @xmath96    the third expression for @xmath94(t )",

    "we emphasize that all the star forming regions considered in this plot have similar sizes ( i.e. similar contents of gas ) .",

    "the onc is the most massive example ( lada & lada 2003 ) .",
    "finally , a more massive cluster contains more massive stars which are more efficient in dissipating molecular gas by ionization and photo - dissociation ( e.g. bally , moeckel & throop 2005 ) . despite these difficulties , the massive carina nebula star - forming region",
    "is now proposed by some authors ( e.g. smith & brooks 2007 ) , instead of orion , as a good analog for the astrophysical environment of our solar system formation .",
    "the carina nebula ( ngc3372 ) is a star forming region situated at 2.3 kpc from the sun and containing @xmath4 65 o stars ( smith 2006 ) .",
    "@xmath25 carinae , the most massive star contained in the carina nebula ( @xmath116 100 m@xmath13 , davidson & humphreys 1997 ) , needs @xmath4  3 myr to go supernova ( smith 2006 ) . since the age of the cluster is @xmath4 3 myr , assuming it formed at the beginning of the cluster s life , @xmath25 carinae can go supernova anytime now ( smith 2006 ) .",
    "most of the molecular gas in the vicinity of @xmath25 carinae has however been cleared away , creating an extended hii region where star formation is halted ( smith et al .",
    "2000 and figure 5 of de graauw et al .",
    "1981 ) .",
    "a few evaporating protoplanetary disks were tentatively detected in the carina nebula and await confirmation ( smith , bally & morse 2003 ) . from the coordinates given by smith , bally & morse ( 2003 ) , we calculate that the protoplanetary disk closest to @xmath25 carinae lies at a minimum distance of 2.4 pc , a factor of @xmath4 10 too large compared to the distance needed to inject srs in sufficient number .",
    "in addition , the putative protoplanetary disks detected by smith , bally & morse ( 2003 ) are significantly more massive ( by a factor of @xmath4 100 ) than the protoplanetary disks observed in orion ( johnstone , hollenbach & bally 1998 ) , or than the expected solar protoplanetary disk ( 0.013 m@xmath13 , hayashi et al .",
    "1985 ) , suggesting that they belong to young intermediate - mass stars rather than to solar - like stars .",
    "the scarcity of solar - like protoplanetary disks in the vicinity of @xmath25 carinae is due to the extreme ionizing power of that star which emits @xmath119 ionizing photons per second , which can be compared to the @xmath120 photons per second emitted by @xmath36_c _ ori ( odell 2001 ) .",
    "it confirms that in the immediate vicinity of very massive stars , protoplanetary disks are extremely rare because ( 1 ) those accompanying low - mass stars which formed contemporaneously with massive stars were photoevaporated or formed planets ( throop & bally 2005 ) and ( 2 ) the efficient gas clearing by winds and uv emission has halted new low - mass star formation .",
    "triggered star formation in the carina nebula occurs in the gas - rich region named south pillars ( smith & brooks 2007 ) .",
    "smith & brooks ( 2007 ) argue that young stars in the south pillars region will be pelted by supernova ejecta containing srs . while it is true that these young stars will be exposed to the supernova ejecta",
    ", the south pillars lie 20 pc away from @xmath25 carinae ( smith et al .",
    "2000 ) , almost two orders of magnitude further away than the distance required to incorporate srs at the abundance observed in the solar system ( see section [ sec - prolog ] ) .",
    "massive stars which form now in the south pillars will need several myr to explode and deliver srs to the interstellar medium and therefore suffer from the same difficulties discussed above .",
    "in calculating the different probability estimates for the injection of srs into a young protoplanetary disk attached to a low - mass star , we made several assumptions and simplifications that we discuss in the following .",
    "we used a minimum distance between the supernova and the disk , @xmath121 pc , proposed by ouellette , desch & hester ( 2007 ) from models simulating the interaction of a 25 m@xmath13 sn with a protoplanetary disk .",
    "a more massive star , more likely to achieve that goal , would have a more massive ejecta and therefore a more disruptive effect ( through momentum transfer ) on the disk ( chevalier 2000 ) .",
    "the minimum sn - disk distance we adopted is therefore a lower limit , which turns into an upper limit for @xmath56 ( see equation [ eq - p1 ] ) and therefore into an upper limit for the probability of sr delivery by a nearby sn in a young disk .",
    "the distance @xmath32 varies with the square root of the injection efficiency ( @xmath25 ) and with the inverse square root of the initial abundance of short - lived radionuclides ( @xmath122 ) ( equation ( [ eq - r ] ) ) .",
    "the initial abundance of srs is known within a factor of a few ( gounelle 2006 ) .",
    "therefore , changes in their adopted abundance will not change much the results . in the case of injection into a protoplanetary disk , ouellette , desch & hester ( 2007 )",
    "show that the injection efficiency is below 1 % for the gas fraction of the ejecta .",
    "though they suggest that srs could be injected in the disk in the form of dust grains , it remains to be demonstrated how plausible dust injection is , especially given that sn dust condensation efficiency ( defined as the ratio of mass of refractory elements condensed into dust to that of refractory elements in the ejecta ) is @xmath5 0.12 ( sugerman et al .",
    "2006 and references therein ) .",
    "ercolano et al .",
    "( 2007 ) estimate an upper limit as low as 4 @xmath6 10@xmath7 for the dust condensation efficiency of supernova sn 1987a . if @xmath25 is reduced to one order of magnitude in equation ( [ eq - r ] )",
    ", it will reduce the maximum acceptable distance by a factor of @xmath123 , i.e. from 0.4 pc to @xmath4 0.15 pc .",
    "the maximum distance @xmath18 calculated in section [ sec - prolog ] is thereore a strict upper limit , which turns into an upper limit for @xmath56 ( see equation [ eq - p1 ] ) and , accordingly , for the probability of sr delivery by a nearby sn in a young disk .      to estimate the fraction of disks which survived uv photoevaporation(@xmath57 ) , we calculated from the data of johnstone , bally & hollenbach ( 1998 ) the fraction of disks in orion which are larger than the minimum inferred original size of the solar protoplanetary disk ( 35 au , gomes et al .",
    "this provides a strong upper limit for @xmath57 for three reasons .",
    "first , the onc is only @xmath4 1 myr old and at the time of @xmath36_c _ ori explosion ( 4 myr from now ) many more disks will have their sizes reduced below 35 au .",
    "second , this estimate does not include the disks which have already fully evaporated and will not capture any srs .",
    "third , more massive stars , more likely to deliver srs , have also larger uv fluxes which will result in a more rapid photoevaporation ( johnstone , bally & hollenbach 1998 ) .",
    "the fraction of disks that survive uv photoevaporation , @xmath124 , which we used in our calculations is therefore an upper limit , as is accordingly the probability of sr delivery by a nearby sn in a young disk .      in calculating @xmath54",
    ", we considered @xmath94(t ) , the temporal evolution of the star formation rate , at the global molecular cloud scale , and did _ not _ take into account the dissipation of molecular gas in the immediate vicinity of the most massive star .",
    "this is a simplification as discussed in section [ sec - orion ] . because massive stars create very rapidly after their formation a hii region in which star formation is impossible , star formation in molecular clouds occurs in the outskirts of hii regions , at several parsecs from the massive star ( reach et al .",
    "2004 ; balog et al . 2007 ; hartmann 2005 ) .",
    "in other words , after 2 - 3 myr of evolution , the star formation rate , @xmath94(t ) , in the immediate vicinity ( @xmath48 2 pc ) of any massive star is virtually zero . by assuming non - zero star formation rates , we definitely calculated a strong upper limit for @xmath54 and therefore for the probability of contamination of a young protoplanetary disk by a nearby supernova .",
    "in calculating @xmath125 ( equation ( [ eq - p1 ] ) ) and @xmath54 ( equations ( [ eq - fd ] ) and ( [ eq - time ] ) ) , we implicitly assumed that star formation was coeval in the considered star forming region . in fact , it is only if the most massive stars in a cluster formed in advance relative to low - mass stars that the probability of injection can increase .",
    "in such a case , the rapid evolution timescale of protoplanetary disks could be reconciled with the slower evolution timescale of massive stars ( figure [ fig - sketch ] ) and the destructive effect of massive stars would play a less important role .    it is commonly argued that molecular clouds have short lives ( @xmath4 4 myr ) and that star formation within them proceed as soon as the cloud is assembled ( e.g. ballesteros - paredes et al .",
    "this implies that the star formation age spread is small ( though non zero , e.g. hartmann 2001 ) . on the other hand palla & stalher ( 2000 )",
    "have argued that molecular clouds live some tens of myr and that some stars form in advance compared to the majority of stars .",
    "even if this is correct , it would not solve the timescale problem , because all stars which possibly formed early relative to the majority of stars in the cluster have ( at least in the case of the onc ) masses below 0.3 m@xmath13 ( palla et al .",
    "such stars are far from being massive enough to go sn and deliver srs to a nearby protoplanetary disk .",
    "we note that , in general , high - mass stars are likely to form last in a cluster ( bally et al .",
    "1998 ; strzer & hollenbach 1999 ; odell 2001 ; kroupa & weidner 2005 ; henriksen 1986 ; boss & goswami 2007 ) .",
    "this implies again that the probability estimates given in the previous sections are upper limits .",
    "the contamination probability in the case of multiple supernovae was explicitly overestimated in assuming ( equation ( [ eq - msn ] ) ) that every low - mass star in the cluster will witness a supernova explosion in its youth ( t @xmath5 1 myr ) .",
    "the overall contamination probability was also implicitly overestimated by keeping @xmath56 identical to that calculated in the single supernova case .",
    "this is because , in calculating @xmath126 ( section [ sec - fe ] ) , we assumed that the most massive star is located at the center of the cluster , where the density of stars is highest . in the case of multiple supernovae ,",
    "the additional massive stars are located in the cluster periphery ( as only the most massive star occupies the cluster center ) where low - mass stars are rare , decreasing accordingly @xmath126 .",
    "even with those gross approximations , the effect of multiple supernovae is to increase the probability by a factor of only a few .",
    "this factor of a few would cancel if the physical effect of many more massive stars were properly taken into account .",
    "more massive stars would lead to increased photoevaporation power , clearing very large hii regions where star formation is halted .",
    "for example the hii region surrounding @xmath25 carinae has an expansion radius of 110 pc ( smith et al .",
    "in addition , the presence of many more massive stars would also increase the probability of close stellar encounters , and therefore planetary disruption ( see below ) .",
    "for all these reasons , we will ignore the increase by a factor of a few in the calculated probability due to multiple supernovae .      a low - mass star born in a large cluster where many massive stars are present can endure close stellar encounters , which have the possibility to disrupt the orbits of planets and small bodies .",
    "this was modeled by adams & laughlin ( 2001 ) .",
    "they showed that for clusters larger than @xmath4 2500 members , the cluster density is such that stellar encounters would modify the orbits of the giant planets and the kuiper belt .",
    "this led adams & laughlin ( 2001 ) to suggest that the sun formed in a cluster smaller than a few thousand stars . in doing so , they considered relatively long relaxation timescales for clusters .",
    "this was criticized by hester & desch ( 2005 ) .",
    "though small clusters live only up to 10 myr before disruption , there is a non zero fraction of clusters , corresponding to the most massive ones , which live hundreds of myr ( lada & lada 2003 ) , similarly to the lifetimes of the pleiades .",

    "although improbable does not mean impossible , this very low probability suggests that other sources should be considered for explaining the overabundance ( compared to the interstellar medium average value ) of srs in the early solar system ( wadhwa et al .",
    "2007 ) . some of the srs , such as @xmath0al , @xmath10cl , @xmath11ca and @xmath12mn can be made by _ in situ _ irradiation together with @xmath127be and @xmath8be ( e.g. gounelle et al .",

    ", it was also assumed that the supernova shockwave triggered the collapse of the dense core .",
    "this proposition has a number of problems .",
    "first , very special conditions are needed to inject short - lived radionuclides in a dense molecular cloud core without disrupting it ( e.g. boss & vanhala 2000 and references therein ) .",
    "the supernova shockwave needs to impact the core with a fine - tuned velocity of @xmath4 20 km / s .",
    "a higher shockwave velocity would disrupt the dense core , while a slower one would fail to induce collapse and inject radioactivities .",

    "2006 ) , but treat the cloud as an homogeneous and dense matter .",
    "a supernova shockwave within a molecular cloud will follow the path of less resistance , and will probably avoid the denser regions and instead expand into the interclump matter ( chevalier 1999 ) delivering very few , if any at all , short - lived radionuclides to molecular cloud cores .",
    "third , though the larger size of a molecular cloud core compared to a protoplanetary disk allows it to collect srs from a sn ejecta at larger distances ( see equation [ eq - r ] ) , it can not be much further away than a few pc ( looney , tobin & fields 2006 ) , and many of the difficulties described above hold in that case too .      for some years",

    "the study of the eucrites chervony kut and juvinas lead shukolyukov & lugmair ( 1993 ) to put an upper limit of 2 @xmath6 10@xmath46 for the initial @xmath2fe/@xmath128fe ratio .        while a high ( 1 @xmath6 10@xmath129 ) initial @xmath2fe/@xmath128fe ratio could be interpreted as a strong evidence for a nearby sn contamination , revision to a lower initial value ( @xmath2fe/@xmath128fe @xmath4 3 @xmath6 10@xmath46 ) changes the outcome because it is compatible with a galactic background origin for @xmath2fe .",
    "the present average galactic value of the @xmath0al/@xmath132al ratio has been estimated to be 8.4 @xmath6 10@xmath129 ( diehl et al .",
    "recent measurements of @xmath133-ray lines in the interstellar medium with the integral satellite have yielded a ratio @xmath2fe/@xmath0al = 0.148 ( wang et al .",

    "this latter value is identical to the lower estimates of the early solar system inferred from meteorites ( see above ) .",
    "even if the initial solar system @xmath2fe/@xmath128fe ratio was as high as 4 @xmath6 10@xmath46 ( e.g. quitt et al .",
    "2007 ) , fluctuations around the average value could easily explain the presence of @xmath2fe due to an inherited origin in the solar system .",
    "it is important to note that this estimate is that of the _ present _ interstellar medium .",
    "it might have been significantly different 4.6 gyr ago .",
    "in addition , this number is averaged on the entire inner galaxy .",
    "heterogeneities in the @xmath0al abundance in the galaxy ( kndlseder et al .",
    "1999 ) suggest that both @xmath0al and @xmath2fe abundances can fluctuate around the average value calculated above .",
    "such calculations show that if the initial solar system @xmath2fe/@xmath128fe ratio was only a few times 10@xmath46 , the need for a single supernova vanishes and an inherited origin can account for the @xmath2fe found in the early solar system . though @xmath0al decays faster than @xmath2fe , an inherited origin can not be excluded for this radionuclide eitherfe ( bizzarro et al .",
