    "the immense luminosities of the gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) , coupled with their origin in the core collapse of massive stars @xcite and their @xmath4-ray penetration through dust , open up a variety of intriguing cosmological applications .",
    "much effort has been directed into the use of grbs for studying star formation ( e.g. @xcite ) , as backlights for exploring high - redshift galaxies and the intergalactic medium ( e.g. @xcite ) , and even as probes of cosmological parameters ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "although the grb population observed until the end of 2004 had enabled much progress in the field , it was widely expected that the launch of _ swift _ , and the subsequent order of magnitude increase in the number of grbs open to detailed study , would allow further insight into the high - redshift universe @xcite . indeed , the ability of _ swift _ to locate and follow - up a fainter burst population than was previously possible @xcite has allowed the study of more distant bursts .",
    "the mean redshift of pre-_swift _ bursts was @xmath5 , while we show here that bursts discovered by _",
    "swift _ now have @xmath2 , including the first burst to have been discovered with @xmath6 , grb050904 at @xmath7 ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "our multiband observations of the grb050814 afterglow are presented in @xcite .",
    "they allowed the construction of its spectral energy distribution ( sed ) , displayed in fig .",
    "[ sed.fig ] , where we have corrected the observed data points for foreground ( galactic ) extinction .",
    "the sed has a strong break blueward of the @xmath8-band , exhibiting colours of and , corresponding to spectral slopes of and , respectively ( @xmath9 ) .",
    "the latter value is unreasonable for grb afterglows , implying an electron energy power - law index more than ten times higher than normally observed . even in the case of high local extinction ( @xmath10 ) ,",
    "such steep slopes can not be obtained ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the strong break blueward of the @xmath8-band is too strong to be readily explained by reddening alone and is best fit by the presence of the ly@xmath11 break at @xmath12 .",
    "the solid curve is a fit to the data at that redshift .",
    "the dashed line shows the spectral slope expected from a synchrotron emission in the fireball model with @xmath13 .",
    "the filter response functions are also shown .",
    "the horizontal error bars represent the fwhm of each filter .",
    "the @xmath14-band upper limit is 2@xmath15 .",
    "the inset shows the @xmath16 observations ( filled squares ) along with the x - ray spectrum ( filled triangles ) at @xmath17hr .",
    "the dashed line is the same @xmath13 slope as in the main panel.,scaledwidth=80.0% ]    the most likely explanation for the steep break observed is due to the presence of the ly@xmath11 break at a redshift of @xmath18 . to provide a more robust estimate of the grb050814 redshift",
    "we fit the available photometry at different redshifts , allowing for a range in @xmath19 and @xmath10 modelled using the parametrization of @xcite .",
    "the models of @xcite provide the average hydrogen opacity as a function of redshift .",
    "the minimum @xmath20 is obtained for @xmath0 .",
    "however , we are only able to obtain weak constraints on @xmath19 and @xmath10 . fixing @xmath21 , a typical value for grb afterglows , results in a best fit of a restframe @xmath22mag and an unchanged redshift .",
    "this @xmath10 is marginally higher than has been inferred from the seds of pre-_swift _ bursts @xcite with bright optical afterglows ( oas ) , but is a necessary consequence of the red @xmath23 colour .",
    "the extrapolated @xmath21 line , normalized for @xmath22mag , slightly overestimates the predicted x - ray flux ( inset of fig .",
    "[ sed.fig ] ) , indicating that @xmath19 is a bit steeper ; @xmath24 would make the x - ray data fall on the line .",
    "since the best fit x - ray spectral index is consistent with the assumed optical / nir one , a cooling break between the optical and x - rays can be ruled out .",
    ".an update to the list of 28 long - duration grbs from table  2 in @xcite ; these additional nine bursts were detected after 30 september 2005 . here",
    "@xmath25 is the sun - to - field distance , @xmath26 the moon - to - field distance and @xmath27 the moon illumination at the time the burst occurred . for a burst detected in the optical but without a reported redshift , an upper redshift limit is estimated based on the filter it is detected in .",
    "[ cols=\"<,^,^ , > , > , > , > \" , ]     in order to study the redshift distribution of grbs , it is important to carefully select a sample containing bursts which have `` observing conditions '' favorable for redshift determination .",
    "in @xcite we introduced four criteria with the aim of constructing such a sample . here",
    "we recap those criteria and add a fifth one : ( 1 ) small error circles , hence the bursts have to be localised with the xrt .",
    "( 2 ) the galactic extinction in the direction to the burst has to be sufficiently small or @xmath28mag .",
    "( 3 ) the xrt error circle should be distributed quickly ( within 12 hours ) for a relatively rapid follow - up .",
    "although the automatic slewing of _ swift _ was enabled in the middle of january 2005 , part of the following month was dedicated to calibration which could not be interrupted .",
    "therefore , we have only included bursts occurring after 1 march 2005 .",
    "( 4 ) rejection of bursts with a declination unsuitable ( above @xmath29 or below @xmath30 ) for follow - up observations . ( 5 ) the sun - to - field distance has to be large enough , with @xmath31 .",
    "the first 28 bursts in the sample were listed in table  2 in @xcite .",
    "nine additional bursts are presented in table  [ sample.tab ] . for each burst",
    "we have also listed the moon - to - field distance ( @xmath26 ) and the moon illumination at the time of the burst .",
    "this is done to examine if these parameters affect the redshift determination significantly , e.g. a full moon close to a burst location .",
    "this is of course difficult to quantify as the oa brightness also plays a role .",
    "for example , grb050820a ( table  2 in @xcite ) has a measured redshift even if it occurred during a full moon and @xmath32 .",
    "therefore , we decided not to limit the sample further .",
    "this relatively `` clean '' sample of 37 bursts has a redshift recovery rate of roughly 50% ( 19/37 ) .",
    "figure  [ z.fig ] shows the redshift distribution of the 19 bursts with a reported redshift in our _ swift _ sample .",
    "both the mean and the median is @xmath33 , more than twice as large as the corresponding numbers for pre-_swift _ bursts .",
    "a natural explanation for this increase is the lower trigger threshold of _ swift _ compared to previous missions , giving rise to fainter ( _ swift _ events are on average 1.7mag fainter in the @xmath34-band at a similar epoch : @xcite ) and higher redshift bursts .",
    "this is complemented by the accurate positions provided by _",
    "swift _ and the rapid response of a variety of telescopes aimed at redshift determinations .",
    "this _ swift _ sample is the most uniform to date and it is of interest to compare its redshift distribution to models predicting the fraction of grbs expected to occur at a given redshift .",
    "@xcite have modelled the expected redshift distribution for grbs , utilising several models including those which follow the globally averaged star formation rate ( model ii ) , and those which scale according to the average metallicity of the universe at a given redshift ( model iv , see e.g. @xcite ) . @xcite",
    "have also carried out a similar exercise , where the grb rate is assumed to be proportional to the star formation rate .",
    "these models are plotted in fig .",
    "[ z.fig ] .",
    "it is remarkable how similar the observed _ swift _ redshift distribution is to the model predictions ; we can now reason that grbs indeed trace star formation ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "however , with the available sample and the limited flux sensitivity of the _ swift_/bat for @xmath3 bursts , it is currently not possible to determine if grbs are unbiased tracers of star formation .",
    "for example , models ii and iv from @xcite are nearly indistinguishable when comparing to the relatively small sample of 19 bursts .",
    "note that although model ii from @xcite and the @xcite model both presuppose that the grb rate is proportional to the star formation rate , they use different assumptions regarding the poorly determined grb luminosity function and the intrinsic spectral shape , explaining their difference in fig .",
    "[ z.fig ] .    by including all the bursts in table  [ sample.tab ] and table 2 in @xcite",
    ", we are able to constrain the number of bursts above a specific redshift . for example , 5%40% of the bursts are located at @xmath3 .",
    "the @xcite and @xcite predictions are 10% and 2% , respectively , suggesting that the grb luminosity function parameters and/or the grb spectral index assumed in @xcite might be more appropriate .",
    "@xcite also predict that 10% of the _ swift _ grbs should originate at @xmath3 .",
    "the mean redshift of our relatively unbiased _ swift _ sample ( @xmath2 ) is larger than the median redshift of sub - mm galaxies ( @xmath35 : @xcite ) and is similar to that of type 2 agns ( @xmath36 : @xcite ) . with two @xmath3",
    "grbs discovered within a space of a month , and primarily due to the spectroscopic redshift of @xmath37 for grb050904 @xcite , we are finally accessing the grb high - redshift regime .",
    "are we starting to probe the era of pop iii stars ? if the transition between the dark ages and the era of reionization occurred around @xmath387 ( see e.g. @xcite for a review ) , the answer might be positive .",
    "however , @xcite have calculated that at most one massive metal - free star forms per pre - galactic halo , and since the grb progenitor may need to be a member of a close binary system in the collapsar scenario ( e.g. @xcite ) , it seems unlikely that pop iii stars could end their lives as grbs . @xcite",
    "have proposed a non - binary possibility in the collapsar scenario , introducing unusually rapidly rotating massive stars .",
    "it is therefore possible that pop iii stars are grb progenitors , although the number of unknowns is currently too large to arrive at a concrete conclusion .",
    "the sample contains grb050814 , whose oa was particularly faint in the @xmath34-band ; the observed optical to x - ray spectral slope is flatter ( @xmath39 ) than expected for the fireball model .",
    "hence , grb050814 is classified as a dark burst as defined by @xcite .",
    "we have argued that this is most likely due to the high - redshift nature ( @xmath12 ) of this burst ; the @xmath40 colour is extremely red which is impossible to explain by strong extinction given the observed @xmath23 colour .",
    "indeed , a similar conclusion was proposed for grb980329 @xcite .",
    "it is clear that grbs have now opened up a window to the very high - redshift universe .",
    "the emerging grb redshift histogram ( fig .",
    "[ z.fig ] ) strongly indicates that grbs can be used to trace the star formation in the universe over a wide redshift range ( @xmath41 ) .",
    "future instrumentation , such as the x - shooter @xcite , will hopefully shed light on the end of the dark ages and the possible grb / pop iii connection .",
