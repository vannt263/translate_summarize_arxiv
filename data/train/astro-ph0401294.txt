    "today , there is a wide consensus that almost all local galaxies harbor supermassive black holes ( smbhs ) in their centers ( e.g. begelman 2003 , kormendy & richstone 1995 ) . we can estimate the mass of these smbhs with dynamical motion of gases or stars around the center of galaxies ( e.g. ghez et al .",
    "1998 , richsotne et al .",
    "1998 , gebhardt et al.2003 ) .",
    "it is well - known that there are some correlations between central smbhs and its galactic bulges .",
    "for example , the mass of smbhs is proportional to the mass of their galactic bulges ; @xmath12 , though its tightness and linearity is still under discussion ( kormendy & richstone 1995 , maggorian et al .",
    "1998 , laor 2001 , mclure & dunlop 2002 , marconi & hunt 2003 ) .",
    "another tight correlation is so - called @xmath13 relation , where @xmath14 is the stellar velocity dispersion in the bulges .",
    "this relation is expressed as the power - law form , @xmath15 ( e.g. gebhardt et al .",
    "2000 , ferrarese & merritt 2000 , tremaine et al .",
    "recently , ferrarese ( 2002 ) and baes et al .",
    "( 2003 ) argue that smbh mass is related to the dark halo mass beyond the bulge , @xmath16 .",
    "graham et al .",
    "( 2001 ) point that there is another correlation that bulges with more massive smbhs have steeper central cusps . in spite of discoveries of many correlations and great efforts which have been devoted to clarify the physical meanings of these correlations ( e.g. silk & rees 1998 , ostriker 2000 , umemura 2001 , adams , graff & richstone 2001 )",
    ", we do not have a consensus yet regarding physical link between the formation process of smbhs and that of their host galaxies ( bulges ) .    to understand how the central smbhs formed and how their formation history is related to that of galaxies",
    ", we must at least know when smbhs were formed in galaxies .",
    "therefore , it is very important to know whether high-_z _",
    "( not active ) galaxies already had smbhs or not . in this respect , it is interesting to note that the so - called lyman - break technique , for example , has made it possible to discover a significant number of high-_z _ ( @xmath17 ) galaxies , i.e. , lyman - break galaxies ( lbgs , steidel et al .",
    "these lbgs are widely known as high-_z _ starburst galaxies and their typical starformation rate is @xmath18 .",
    "papovich et al .",
    "( 2001 ) and shapley et al .",
    "( 2001 ) applied the population synthesis models to infer uv - to - optical spectrum of lbgs at their rest frame and examined various properties of lbgs . despite uncertainties their results are consistent at some points ; lbgs are typically young ( their ages are several hundred myr since last star - formation events ) and small ( their typical stellar mass is @xmath19 ) , though there were some old lbgs .",
    "ridgway et al . (",
    "2001 ) point that the sizes and magnitudes of the host galaxies of the radio - quiet qsos at @xmath20 are similar to those of lbgs in hst imaging study .",
    "steidel et al.(2002 ) observed about 1000 lbgs and argue that 3% of these lbgs are optically faint agns based on their uv spectrum .",
    "nandra et al.(2002 ) confirmed by using _",
    "observatory that the same number fraction , 3% , of lbgs are extremely bright in the rest - frame hard x - ray band , and asserted that these lbgs show agn activity .",
    "they discussed that this number fraction , 3% may reflect the duty cycle of mass accretion to smbhs in lbgs .",
    "that is , if the typical age of lbgs is 300 myr ( e.g. shapley et al .",
    "2001 ) and the accretion timescale is @xmath21 yr , remaining 97% of lbgs may have inactive smbhs .",
    "this situation may be compared with the local universe . in the local universe ,",
    "almost all galaxies harbor smbhs in their centers , but there are much inactive galaxies than agns . the pioneering work ( dressler , thompson & shectman 1985 ) found that the number franction of agns to all galaxies is only several % , though this franction recently increases to 20 - 40 % due to the accurate observations ( kauffmann et al",
    ". 2003 , miller et al .",
    "furthermore , vestergaard ( 2003 ) and vestergaard ( 2004 ) discusses that the lbgs with agn activity may have smbhs of order @xmath22 from the virial mass estimate using c iv line width .",
    "if these lbgs have typical stellar mass of @xmath23 , the mass ratio becomes @xmath24 , which is larger than @xmath12 of local galaxies .",
    "incidentally , normal galaxies and agns have the same mass ratio , @xmath25 , in the local universe ( wandel 2002 ) . whereas , granato et al .",
    "( 2001 ) found that lbgs may be equivalent to the galaxies which are in the pre - agn phase based on their semi - analytic model of the joint formation of qsos and galaxies .",
    "kawakatu et al.(2003 ) argue that it may be physically difficult to feed a black hole in optically thin galaxies , such as lbgs , based on the idea by umemura ( 2001 ) . in the local universe , almost all",
    "the smbhs observationally accompany the stellar spheroidal ( bulge ) component ( m33 , which is the bulgeless galaxy , appears to have no smbhs ( gebhardt et al .",
    "2001 ) ) , therefore , the bulge component may be indispensable to form a smbh . if lbgs are still in the initial phase of forming the bulge component ( matteucci & pipino 2002 ) , lbgs may not have smbhs .",
    "of course , it is difficult to resolve the central parsec scale region of lbgs and search the ( inactive ) smbhs observationally . in this paper",
    ", we theoretically examine the possibility that lbgs have smbhs from the viewpoints of the demographics .",
    "we consider the cosmological accretion history derived from the observed hard x - ray ( 2 - 10kev ) luminosity functions ( hxlfs ) of agns at @xmath0 ( ueda et al .",
    "2003 , hereafter uaom03 ) .",
    "yu & tremaine ( 2002 ) ( hereafter yt02 ) use the continuity equation for the number density of smbhs ( see also soltan 1982 , small & blandford 1992 ) and show that the accreted mass estimated with optical lfs ( olfs ) of qsos at @xmath0 is comparable with the smbh mass density of the local universe .",
    "however , we can see only a part of various populations of agns in the optical band , thus the analysis with hard x - ray lfs , which include absorbed agns , is important .",
    "we consider the cosmological accretion history estimated with hxlfs and compare it with the accretion history estimated with olfs ( yt02 ) .",
    "furthermore , we basically extend the formulation of yt02 and crudely estimate how many and how massive smbhs are allowed to exist in the high-_z _ universe .",
    "if most lbgs already had very massive smbhs at @xmath4 , the accreted mass into smbhs until @xmath8 should exceed the bh mass density of the local universe . in this way",
    ", we will be able to set constraints on the mass density of smbhs in lbgs .",
    "below , we use the continuity equation of smbh population as the leading principle . in  2 , we first transform the continuity equation to the useful integrated form (  2.1 ) .",
    "we then compare the cosmological accretion history at @xmath0 with the local population of smbhs and constrain the physical parameters ; the energy conversion efficiency , @xmath1 and the eddington ratio , @xmath26 ) (  2.2 ) . in this time , we compare the accretion history with hxlfs and that with olfs . in  3 , we extend yt02 s formulation and derive the upper limit of the population of smbhs at @xmath4 (  3.1 ) .",
    "furthermore , we consider the tentative smbhs in lbgs with mass ratio , @xmath27 ( @xmath6 is the stellar mass of lbgs ) , and crudely estimate the upper limit of the probability that one lbg has a smbh (  3.2 ) . in  4 , we summarize and discuss the results . throughout this paper ,",
    "we adopt the @xmath28-dominant universe and the cosmological parameters are @xmath29 .",
    "we begin with the continuity equation for the number density of smbhs : @xmath30 ; that is @xmath31}{\\partial m } = \\gamma_{\\rm merge}(m , t)+\\gamma_{\\rm form}(m , t ) \\label{conti}\\ ] ] ( soltan 1982 , small & blandford 1992 , yt02 ) . hereafter , we simply express the black hole mass as @xmath32 .",
    "the source terms on the right - hand side , @xmath33 and @xmath34 , represent the smbh - smbh merger rates ( e.g. haehnelt 1994 ) and the rates of the direct formation of smbhs by , say , collapse of the supermassive stars ( sms ) ( @xmath35 , or may be more massive ) .",
    "we can express these terms explicitly .",
    "the merger term is , @xmath36 , \\label{mg}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath37 is the distribution function which represents the merger rates among the smbhs of mass @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "the factor 1/2 is necessary to correct the double counts of the merger rates in the integral in eq.([mg ] ) .",
    "several recent studies investigate the distribution function of mergers , @xmath37 with the semi - analytic model of galaxies and qsos ( e.g. kauffmann & haehnelt 2000 , volonteri , haardt & madau 2003 ) .",
    "however , the key problem of the smbh merger is the timescale .",
    "that is , the timescale to refill the `` loss cone '' of the smbh binary ( see begelman et al .",
    "1980 or milosavijevi & merritt 2003 ) .",
    "although the hardening timescale of the binary have been actively studied , this problem is still under discussion ( makino 1997 , milosavijevi & merritt 2001 , milosavijevi & merritt 2003 , makino & funato 2004 ) .",
    "therefore , we treat @xmath37 as the unknown function . here",
    ", we assume that the total mass of smbhs is conserved through merger events . as for @xmath40",
    ", we only note that this numerical value is not negative , @xmath41 recently , the gravitational collapse of sms is being studied with the general relativistic numerical simulations ( e.g. shapiro & shibata 2002 , shibata & shapiro 2002 ) . however , it is still uncertain how and when the initial condition of the simulations is realized . eventually , these source terms are highly uncertain and we do not know whether these terms exist or not ( the merger term will be at least non - negligible ( e.g. merritt & ekers 2003 ) ) .",
    "yt02 successfully avoid this difficulty by multiplying eq.([conti ] ) by the function , @xmath42 and integrate by @xmath43 from 0 to @xmath44 and by @xmath45 from @xmath46 to @xmath47 ( cosmological time at @xmath48 ) , assuming that @xmath49 in the limit of @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "the result is @xmath52 here , @xmath53 , @xmath54 and @xmath55 are defined by @xmath56 @xmath57 @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the average mass accretion rate into the smbhs of mass @xmath43 . since @xmath55 is 0 or positive , we obtain the inequality , @xmath60    these mathematical derivation of eq.([ineq ] ) is the same as that in yt02 , whereas we explain the physical meaning of eq.([ineq ] ) here .",
    "to do so , we transform inequality ( [ ineq ] ) as @xmath61 in this form , we can understand the meanings of each term . clearly , the left - hand side of eq.([mod_ineq ] ) represents the mass density contained by smbhs more massive than @xmath32 at @xmath48 .",
    "the first term of the right - hand side represents the mass accreted into the smbhs more massive than @xmath32 per unit volume during @xmath62 ( i.e. @xmath63 ) .",
    "the second term on the right - hand side represents another contribution ; that is , the mass density of smbhs at the moment that smbhs become more massive than @xmath32 . in our consideration , the smbhs more massive than @xmath32 can form through the mass accretion , mergers , or gravitational collapse of the sms .",
    "the mass of a smbh continuously grows by the mass accretion , whereas the mass of a smbh grows discontinuously by the mergers and/or direct formation .",
    "therefore , the mass of smbhs at the moment that smbhs become more massive than @xmath32 is equal to @xmath32 for the case with the mass accretion , whereas it is more than @xmath32 otherwise .",
    "the total number of smbhs which became more massive than @xmath32 until @xmath48 is necessarily larger than @xmath64 since the mergers reduce the number of smbhs .",
    "totally , the lower limit of the contribution of the mass density of smbhs at the moment that smbhs become more massive than @xmath32 is @xmath65 , which is the second term on the right - hand side of eq.([mod_ineq ] ) .",
    "the physical meaning of this term may be considered as the `` advection '' of smbh mass across the mass @xmath32 in terms of the continuity equation of the population of smbhs .",
    "this `` advection '' term is the heart of this inequality .",
    "we can calculate @xmath53 with the local mass function of smbhs .",
    "we adopt the mass function of smbhs given by aller & richstone ( 2002 ) ( hereafter ar02 ) based on the luminosity functions of galaxies at @xmath48 for each morphology .",
    "they convert the local lfs of normal galaxies to the mass function of smbhs with some empirical relations among total luminosity , bulge luminosity , velocity dispersion and smbh mass .",
    "one of these relations is @xmath66 relation mentioned above .",
    "ar02 derive the two local mass functions of smbhs for different galactic lfs ; mass function ( a ) is derived from lfs by marzke et al .",
    "( 1994 ) , whereas mass function ( b ) is derived from lfs by madgwick et al .",
    "below , we show the results of the calculation for the cases with mass function ( a ) and refer the results of the other cases in text .",
    "we use the fitting formulae for the mass functions of smbhs given by ar02 . with the mass functions ( a ) and ( b ) , the local mass density of smbhs more massive than @xmath67 is @xmath68 and @xmath69 respectively . yt02",
    "adopt the lfs based on the sdss ( sloan digital sky survey ) and their calculated value is @xmath70 with @xmath71 .",
    "salucci et al .",
    "( 1999 ) and merritt & ferrarese ( 2001 ) also obtain similar results .    to calculate @xmath54 , there is a difficulty in that we do not know the number density of smbhs at cosmological time @xmath45 , @xmath72 , and the average accretion rate of smbhs , @xmath73 .",
    "here , we assume that the mass accretion into smbhs occurs mainly at bright agn phase .",
    "the average accretion rate of agns is assumed to be @xmath74 where @xmath75 is the bolometric luminosity of agns and @xmath1 is the energy conversion efficiency . with eq.([mdot ] ) , we can express @xmath54 as @xmath76 here , @xmath77 is the lfs of agns and we use observed hxlfs ( uaom03 ) .",
    "very recently , uaom03 build the hxlfs of agns over the wide luminosity range , @xmath78 , and wide redshift range , @xmath79 , from the combination of surveys with _ heao1 _",
    ", _ asca _ and _ chandra _ satellites .",
    "the shape of hxlfs of agns at @xmath48 are fitted by so - called double power - law function well .",

    "the redshift evolution of hxlfs are described as the luminosity - dependent density evolution ( ldde ) , which is suggested by miyaji et al .",
    "( 2001 ) for the evolution of the soft x - ray luminosity functions of agns .",
    "the ldde model is expressed as @xmath84 where @xmath85^{p2 } , &                               \\quad \\mbox{for $ z \\geq z_c ( l_{\\rm x})$ } ,             \\end{array}\\right.\\ ] ] and @xmath86 the parameters which represent redshift dependence of @xmath87 are @xmath88 and @xmath89 .",
    "then , @xmath90 corresponds to the peak redshift at which the number density of agns with luminosity of @xmath91 is the maximum .",
    "the cut - off redshift , @xmath90 , increases as the luminosity increases ( @xmath92 ) ( see fig.10 of uaom03 ) .",
    "that is , the number density of the more luminous agns reaches the maximum at the higher redshift and decrease as @xmath93 ( see fig.12 of uaom03 ) .",
    "we simply extrapolate the fitting formulae given by above ldde model at @xmath94 .    to calculate @xmath54 , we need the relation between the hard x - ray luminosity , @xmath91 and the bolometric luminosity , @xmath95 .",
    "we assume the relation as @xmath96 , where @xmath97 is constant value @xmath98 ( alonso - herrero et al . 2002 ) .",
    "generally , the ratio of b - band ( 4400  ) , hard x - ray ( 2 - 10 kev ) luminosity to the bolometric luminosity , @xmath99 and @xmath97 should depend on the mass accretion rate and the black hole mass .",
    "this may be important to compare the local mass function of smbhs with the mass accretion history estimated with olfs and that estimated with hxlfs .",
    "we will discuss this issue in the next subsection in some details .",
    "we suppose that the qsos radiate as @xmath100 .",
    "the parameters here are the energy conversion efficiency , @xmath1 , and the eddington ratio , @xmath2 .      here , we compare the mass accretion history estimated with hxlfs and that with olfs based on the continuity equation .",
    "for both cosmological accretion history with hxlfs and that with olfs , the relation to the local mass function of smbhs can be investigated with ineq.([ineq ] ) derived from the continuity equation .",
    "yt02 noted that their calculated @xmath54 with olfs of qsos with the typical parameter , @xmath101 and @xmath102 is larger than @xmath53 , especially in the large mass range , @xmath103 ( inequality ( [ ineq ] ) is not satisfied ) .",
    "that is , there is the problem of the overaccretion compared to the local mass function of smbhs .",
    "yt02 discussed the possible origin of this discrepancy .",
    "for example , they argue that the optically bright qsos may radiate at large mass - to - energy conversion efficiency , @xmath1 ( e.g. @xmath104 ) .",
    "however , we can see only a part of the light emitted in the mass accretion process to smbhs in the optical band .",
    "this is partly because the optical luminosity emitted through the mass accretion can be absorbed by obscuring torus ( type ii agns ) ( e.g. antonucci 1993 ) .",
    "we can miss the reddened qsos due to the dust extinction in the host galaxies when the typical color selection criteria ( e.g. uv excess ) is adopted to build the qso lfs ( e.g. webster et al .",
    "thus , we calculate @xmath54 with hxlfs and compare it to @xmath54 with olfs and to @xmath53 . of course",
    ", as yt02 noted , it seems to make the problem worse to use the hxlfs .",
    "this is because hxlfs include extra populations of agns besides the optically bright agns .",
    "however , this is not the case . the redshift evolution of hxlfs and that of olfs are different , then we can make the situation better ( see below ) .",
    "the upper panel of fig.1 represents the results with the local mass function of smbhs ( a ) . for olfs of qsos ,",
    "we adopt ones given by boyle et al.(2000 ) at @xmath105 derived from about 6,000 qsos detected by 2qz survey and simply extrapolate it at @xmath106 .",
    "we assume the constant bolometric correction , @xmath107 ( elvis et al .",
    "yt02 use the same olfs and adopt the same assumptions .",
    "like yt02 s result , our results show that the inequality ( [ ineq ] ) is not satisfied in all mass range ( especially at high mass end ) with olfs and typical parameters , @xmath108 .",
    "if we use mass function ( b ) , the calculated @xmath53 is larger than ( a ) by a factor 1.4 , but equation ( [ ineq ] ) is not still satisfied at @xmath109 .",
    "however , fig.1 also shows that calculated @xmath54 with hxlfs with the same parameter set do not exceed @xmath53 in @xmath110 . at first sight",
    ", this looks strange . since in hxlfs",
    "optically absorbed agns and reddened agns are considered besides the optically bright qsos , @xmath54 calculated based on hxlfs should become larger than @xmath54 based on olfs .",
    "the origin of this puzzle lies in our assumption on @xmath111 and @xmath97 .",
    "we assume that both of @xmath111 and @xmath97 are constant ; @xmath112 and @xmath98 .",
    "if this were actually the case , the ratio between b - band luminosity and hard x - ray luminosity , @xmath113 , must be constant .",
    "however , uaom03 compare their hxlfs of only optical type - i agns to olfs by boyle et al .",
    "( 2000 ) and find that @xmath91 is not proportional to @xmath114 .",
    "they obtained a power - law relation between the 2kev and @xmath115 luminosities , @xmath116 in the @xmath117 universe .",
    "this relation is approximately transformed to the relation between @xmath118 and @xmath119 as @xmath120 + 131.5 .",
    "\\label{mb_lx}\\ ] ] that is , @xmath121 .",
    "therefore , the assumption that both of @xmath111 and @xmath97 are constant is not justified .",
    "as noted by uaom03 , if @xmath122 were constant , the redshift evolution of olfs would be more quick than that of hxlfs .",
    "the bright end of olfs grows more quickly than hxlfs as @xmath123 increases .",
    "then , calculated @xmath54 based on olfs is larger than that based on hxlfs .",
    "kawaguchi , shimura & mineghige ( 2001 ) build a disk - corona model for the broad - band spectral energy distributions ( seds ) of agns . based on their model , hosokawa et al .",
    "( 2001 ) and alonso - herrero et al .",

    "though their dependence on @xmath32 and @xmath124 is not simple , @xmath97 comparatively remains constant for varying @xmath32 and @xmath124 .",

    "alonso - herrero et al .",
    "( 2002 ) show the similar dependence , @xmath127 based on kawaguchi , shimura & mineshige ( 2001 ) , though the dependence is somewhat weaker .",
    "even if we use hxlfs , the calculated @xmath54 with @xmath128 becomes larger than @xmath53 in the high mass end ( @xmath129 ) .",
    "however , this may be an inevitable result .",
    "we calculate @xmath53 with the local mass function of smbhs derived with the schechter - type lfs of galaxies , which declines exponentially at the bright end , whereas we calculate @xmath54 with the hxlfs which is power - law function at the bright end .",
    "yt02 point that the qso lfs at the bright end or @xmath66 relation at the high mass end may be uncertain .",
    "then , we use the energy conversion efficiency , @xmath1 , and eddington ratio , @xmath130 as constant free parameters to calculate @xmath54 , and search the region of the parameter space of @xmath131 where inequality eq.([ineq ] ) is satisfied only at @xmath132 for given @xmath133 .",
    "we choose @xmath134 and @xmath135 .",

    "this conclusion will not change , even if we adopt mass function ( b ) . in fig.[fig.search ] , we show the same parameter regions when we use olfs of qsos to calculate @xmath54 . to satisfy inequality ( [ ineq ] ) to high mass end , high eddington ratio ( @xmath142 ) and high energy conversion efficiency ( @xmath143 ) are needed .",

    "we roughly estimate the necessary condition to neglect the merger term in eq.([geq ] ) .",
    "for example , for the major merger between smbhs of @xmath278 , the loose upper limit is about 1 event per one year .",
    "if we observe these merger events one or more times per year , we can not neglect the smbh - smbh mergers .",
    "totally , the possibility that nearly all lbgs have smbhs with large mass ratio , @xmath279 , is reliably ruled out .",
    "even if agn - like lbgs have smbhs with large mass ratio as vestergaard ( 2003 ) and vestergaard ( 2004 ) suggested , remaining normal lbgs will not have inactive smbhs with the same mass ratio .    though we consider the tentative smbhs in lbgs with mass ratio , @xmath271 , this proportional relation is only a trial one .",
    "papovich et al.(2001 ) note that the stellar mass estimated with the rest - frame uv - to - optical spectrum is only the mass of young stars .",
    "that is , additional population of old stars may exist .",
    "papovich et al .",
    "estimate that the upper limit of the mass of old stars is 3 - 8 times as large as that of young stars .",
    "since the smbh mass is not correlated with the younger disk component but older bulge component in the nearby galaxies , it may be better to relate the tentative smbh mass with the mass of old stars if they exist",
    ". however , our approach will be still valid , since we simply try another values of @xmath171 .",
    "of course , even if smbhs actually exist in the high - z galaxies , the proportional relation between @xmath32 and @xmath280 itself is never guaranteed .",
    "fortunately , it is known that @xmath272 of nearby agns is the same as that of local galaxies ( wandel 2002 ) .",
    "it will be the first step to investigate the relation between the stellar mass and smbh mass of lbgs which show the agn activity .",

    "<S> we study the demographics of supermassive black holes ( smbhs ) in the local and high-_z _ universe . </S>",
    "<S> we use the continuity equation of the population of smbhs as the leading principle . </S>",
    "<S> we consider three physical processes for the growth of smbhs : mass accretion , mergers , and direct formation of smbhs . </S>",
    "<S> the mass accretion history of smbhs is estimated by the hard x - ray luminosity functions ( hxlfs ) of agns . </S>",
    "<S> first , we compare the mass accretion history at @xmath0 with optical luminosity functions ( olfs ) of qsos previously studied and that with hxlfs . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that the constraints on parameters of mass accretion ( energy conversion efficiency , @xmath1 and eddington ratio , @xmath2 ) based on the continuity equation appear to be adequate using hxlfs rather than olfs . the sub - eddington case ( @xmath3 ) </S>",
    "<S> is allowed only when we use hxlfs . </S>",
    "<S> next , we extend the formulation and we can obtain the upper limit of the cumulative mass density of smbhs at any redshifts . for an application , we examine if lyman - break galaxies ( lbgs ) at @xmath4 already have smbhs in their centers which is suggested by recent observations . </S>",
    "<S> we tentatively assume the presence of smbhs in lbgs and that their mass , @xmath5 is proportional to the stellar mass of lbgs , @xmath6 with the mass ratio @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> if most of lbgs already has massive smbhs at @xmath4 , the resultant mass density of smbhs at @xmath8 should exceed the observational estimate because such smbhs should further grow by accretion . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , we can set the upper limit of the probability that one lbg has a smbhs . </S>",
    "<S> since the merger rates and direct formation rates of smbhs are uncertain , we consider two limiting cases : ( i ) mergers and/or direct formations are not negligible compared with mass accretion and ( ii ) mass accretion is the dominant process to grow the smbhs . </S>",
    "<S> the special conditions should be met in order that a large part of lbgs have smbhs in both cases . in case ( i ) , we may assume the constant parameters of mass accretion of agns for simplicity . </S>",
    "<S> then , large energy conversion efficiency and frequent mergers and/or direct formations at @xmath9 are needed so that a large part of lbgs have smbhs with @xmath10 to 0.005 . whereas , in case ( ii ) , energy conversion efficiency should be mass dependent and the constraint is strict ; the fraction of lbgs which have smbhs must be less than 10 - 40% . in both cases , </S>",
    "<S> the possibility that nearly all lbgs have smbhs with large mass ratio , such as @xmath11 , is reliably ruled out . </S>"
