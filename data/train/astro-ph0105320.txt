    "it has been long recognized that galaxy peculiar motions introduce distortions in the clustering pattern observed in redshift surveys . on small scales ,",
    "the random motions of galaxies in virialized clusters causes structures to appear elongated along the line of sight , often referred to as the fingers - of - god . on large scales ,",
    "the coherent inflow of galaxies into over dense structures causes these to appear flattened along the line of sight ( peebles 1980,76 , and references therein ) .    in a seminal paper kaiser ( 1987 )",
    "showed that in the linear regime the galaxy peculiar velocities are expected to introduce a quadrupole anisotropy in @xmath9 the power - spectrum in galaxy redshift surveys , the relation between @xmath9 and its real space counterpart @xmath10 being @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the cosine of the angle between @xmath13 and the line of sight .",
    "he proposed that this effect could be used to measure the cosmological density parameter @xmath14 .",
    "this possibility has led to a lot of work on linear redshift distortions and the reader is referred to hamilton ( 1998 ) for a comprehensive review .",
    "although in principle kaiser s original proposal is quite simple , there are a large number of problems which arise in the actual analysis of redshift distortions .",
    "one of the main problems arises from the possibility that galaxies may be biased tracers of the underlying mass distribution which determines the peculiar velocities .",
    "the fact that galaxies of different types cluster differently ( e.g. , dressler 1980 ; lahav , nemiroff & piran 1990 , santiago & strauss 1992 ; loveday 1995 ; hermit 1996 ; guzzo 1997 ) implies that not all of them can be exact indicators of the mass distribution .",
    "the presence of bias is a consequence of the complex process of galaxy formation and this suggests a scale dependent , stochastic and nonlinear bias ( e.g. cen & ostriker 1992 , mann , peacock & heavens 1998 , ue - li pen 1998 , dekel & lahav 1999 ) . various studies ( e.g. taruya 2001 , benson 2000 , kauffmann , nusser & steinmetz 1997 ) indicate that deterministic linear biasing is a reasonably good assumption at large scales where the density fluctuations are linear . in this situation biasing",
    "is described using only one scale independent parameter @xmath7 which relates the fluctuation in the galaxy density and the mass density through a linear relation @xmath15 .",
    "it then follows that the analysis of linear redshift distortions allows the determination of the quantity @xmath16 , and not @xmath14 and @xmath7 individually .",
    "the analysis of different redshift surveys has given values of @xmath17 which vary considerably in the range @xmath18 ( table .",
    "1 of hamilton 1998 ) .",
    "a part of the large spread in values is related to uncertainties in the nature and extent of bias in the different galaxy samples .",
    "the parameter @xmath17 can also be measured by comparing the observed peculiar velocities with the observed galaxy distribution ( eg .",
    "strauss and willick , 1995 ) .",
    "the spread in the values of @xmath17 determined using this method ( table 3 . of strauss and willick , 1995 )",
    "is comparable to that in the values determined using redshift distortion .",
    "another method of measuring @xmath17 is based on the observed cluster abundance ( wu , 2000 ) .",
    "melott ( 1998 ) have proposed that the `` bulls - eye effect '' which arises due to redshift distortion offers a different way of probing @xmath14 .",
    "kaiser s original work and much of the subsequent work is based on the plane - parallel - approximation ( ppa ) which is valid if the angles subtended by the pairs of galaxies in the analysis are small .",
    "the radial nature of the redshift distortions has to be taken into account when analyzing wide angle surveys .",
    "different strategies for incorporating this effect have been studied by fisher , scharf & lahav ( 1994 ) , heavens & taylor ( 1995 ) , hamilton & culhane ( 1996 ) , zaroubi & hoffman ( 1996 ) , szalay , matsubara & landy ( 1998)and bharadwaj ( 1999 ) .",
    "the radial gradients of the galaxy selection function and the motion of the observer introduce new effects when the radial nature of the redshift distortions are taken into account .",
    "these two effects do not contribute in the plane parallel approximation .",
    "the linear analysis of redshift distortions , applicable on large scales where the real space density is linear @xmath19 , incorporates the distortion due to peculiar velocities only to linear order when transforming from real to redshift space .",
    "n - body simulations suggest that non - linear effect are significant in redshift space even at considerably large scales where the real space density field is linear ( e.g. suto & suginohara 1991 ; fisher et al .",
    "1993 ; graman , cen & bahcall , 1993 ; brainerd et al . , 1996 ;",
    "bromley , warren & zurek , 1997 ) .",
    "this is also seen in the two - point correlation function measured in redshift surveys .",
    "in addition to the flattening predicted by the linear analysis , the two - point correlation function remains elongated along the line of sight at scales as large as @xmath20 ( e.g. figure 2 .",
    "peacock 2001 ) .",
    "this indicates that there is a regime where the density and peculiar velocity fields in real space are adequately described by linear theory , and it is the mapping from real to redshift space which is non - linear .",
    "this is often referred to as the translinear regime .",
    "it is important to incorporate the non - linear effects in the analysis of redshift distortions in this regime and there have been two different approaches to this problem .    the first approach ( e.g. fisher 1994 , peacock & dodds 1994 , ballinger , peacock & heavens 1996 ) )",
    "is phenomenological and the effect of the non - linearity is incorporated by convolving the linear redshift two - point correlation function with the line of sight component of a random isotropic pairwise velocity distribution function ( eq . [ eq : dis1 ] ) .",
    "equivalently , these effects are introduced into the power spectrum through a function @xmath21 which multiplies the linear redshift power spectrum .",
    "the resulting redshift power spectrum is given by @xmath22 different forms , including a gaussian and an exponential , have been used for the distribution function and this approach is found to match the results of n - body simulations well ( hatton & cole 1998 ) .",
    "the other approach is based on the zeldovich approximation .",
    "taylor & hamilton ( 1996 ) , fisher & nusser ( 1996 ) and hatton and cole ( 1998 ) have used the zeldovich approximation to analytically study the behaviour of the redshift - space power spectrum in the translinear regime .",
    "they find that the results from zeldovich approximation are in agreement with n - body simulations in predicting the shape of the quadrupole to monopole ratio for the redshift power spectrum .",
    "they also demonstrate that there can be departures from the linear predictions even at relatively large scales .",
    "the first two groups of authors also conclude that the agreement between the zeldovich approximation and n - body simulations suggests that it is the coherent infall into over dense structures and not random motions in virialized clusters which is responsible for departures from the linear behaviour in the translinear regime .",
    "recently hui , kofman & shandarin ( 2000 ) have used the zeldovich approximation to study the probability distribution function of density in redshift space .",
    "they find that the peculiar velocities may significantly increase the multi - streaming in redshift space even when this is insignificant in real space .",
    "this suggests that non - perturbative effects may be important in the mapping from real to redshift space even when the real space density is relatively linear .",
    "it is the aim of this paper to analytically study the redshift two - point correlation function in the translinear regime focusing on the non - linear effects which arise from the mapping from real to redshift space .",
    "it is hoped that such a study will help elucidate the relation between the redshift correlation function and the different real space quantities on which it depends .",
    "we consider a situation where the density fluctuations and peculiar velocities are linear in real space , and we calculate @xmath0 the two - point correlation function in redshift space taking into account all non - linear effects of the redshift distortion .",
    "the calculation closely follows the method used to calculate the real space two - point correlation function in the zeldovich approximation ( bharadwaj 1996b ) .",
    "our result is non - perturbative and hence it incorporates the effects of multi - streaming in redshift space .",
    "our calculation assumes the plane - parallel approximation and hence the effect of gradients in the selection function and the motion of the observer have been ignored .",
    "the calculation is presented in section  2 .    in  3",
    "we compare our results with the predictions of linear redshift distortion and investigate the nature and extent of the deviations from the linear results .",
    "the effects of linear redshift distortion are quantified by a single parameter @xmath23 , and it not possible to determine @xmath14 and @xmath7 separately .",
    "we investigate whether this degeneracy is broken and if it becomes possible to determine @xmath14 and @xmath7 if the non - linear redshift distortions are taken into account .",

    "we now come back to the interpretation of equation ( [ eq : a20 ] ) . one of the main features is that it incorporates all the effects of the anisotropy and scale dependence of the pair velocity dispersion . as noted earlier , these two features arise because of the coherent flows . whereas the convolution in equation ( [ eq : dis1 ] ) accounts only for the effects of random motions , the convolution with the distribution function in equation ( [ eq : a20 ] ) also includes the effect of the coherent flows .",
    "the coherent flows reduce the width of the distribution function , causing a reduction in the elongation in @xmath0 .",
    "the effect of the coherent flows is also present in the terms involving ratios of @xmath62 and @xmath63 , the contribution of these terms increasing with the effect of coherent flows .",
    "all the terms involving @xmath144 arise due to the non - linear redshift distortions .    in the linear analysis",
    "the redshift distortions produced by the coherent flows give rise to a flattening of the two - point correlation function along the line of sight .",
    "this effect is best captured by the quadrupole moment @xmath117 which is predicted to be negative .",
    "the linear analysis also predicts a positive hexadecapole moment arising from the term involving the second derivative of @xmath130 in equation ( [ eq : b1 ] ) for @xmath133 .    comparing our result with the predictions of the linear analysis of redshift distortions we see that the non - linear redshift space effects are more pronounced on the higher spherical moments @xmath145 of the redshift space two - point correlation function . while the monopole @xmath1 shows no significant deviations from the linear predictions , the deviations are around @xmath146 on scales of @xmath147 for @xmath117 .",
    "the moment @xmath2 shows very large deviations from the linear predictions , the non - linear predictions differing by a factor of @xmath148 on scales of @xmath149 .",
    "a point which should be noted is that our analysis ignores all non - linear effect in the real space density fluctuations and peculiar velocities , and focuses only on the non - linear redshift distortions .",
    "while this assumption is expected to be valid for @xmath84 and @xmath62 at scales greater than @xmath150 , we do not expect this to hold for @xmath63 which has a constant isotropic part @xmath151 arising from the random motions .",
    "this has a large contribution from small scales which are non - linear and we do not expect the linear results used here to give a realistic estimate of @xmath63 .",
    "we also expect this effect to be present in our estimates on the effects on non - linear redshift distortions on the different angular moments of @xmath0 .",
    "a possible solution is to use n - body simulations to determine the constant , isotropic part of @xmath63 and to use linear theory to calculate the contribution of the coherent flows .",
    "this possibility has not been explored here , and we plan to continue future work in this direction .",
    "another possibility which might arise but has not been taken into account is non - linear bias .",
    "a quadratic bias relation gives rise to two bias parameters @xmath152 and @xmath153 , and the relation between the fluctuations in the galaxy number density and the matter density is @xmath154 .",
    "in this situation @xmath155 will no longer be a gaussian random field and this will give rise to a new series of terms in equation ( [ eq : a14 ] ) which could be summed up following the same procedure .",
    "the effects of linear redshift distortion can be parametrized by a single parameter @xmath8 and the analysis of redshift surveys based on this do not yield @xmath6 and @xmath7 separately .",
    "we find that @xmath2 , the hexadecapole moment of @xmath0 , depends on @xmath6 and @xmath7 separately when the non - linear effects of redshift distortions are taken into account .",
    "this holds the possibility of separately determining @xmath6 and @xmath7 from redshift surveys .",
    "although this effect increases at small scales , the range @xmath156 is possibly best suited for putting it to use .",
    "non - linear effects in real space and non - linear biasing will become important at smaller scales . at these scales",
    "the hexadecapole moment is expected to be @xmath146 of the quadrupole moment .",
    "further investigations are needed to determine the range of validity of the results presented here before they can be applied to the analysis of redshift surveys .",
    "the author would like to thank debaprasad giri and akhilesh singh for their help while writing this paper .",
    "the author is also thankful to mri , allahabad for its hospitality during a part of the period when this was being completed .      in this appendix",
    "we discuss , in some detail , the relation between @xmath157 , @xmath158 , @xmath159 and @xmath160 . in the linear regime @xmath161 , the fluctuation in the dark matter density , can be expressed in terms of a potential @xmath162 as @xmath163 and the peculiar velocity @xmath164 can be expressed as @xmath165          we next consider @xmath159 which can be expressed as @xmath174 [ \\n \\cdot \\grad \\psi(\\rw ) ] \\rangle + \\sigma^2   \\nonumber \\\\ & = & 2 f^2   \\frac{\\partial^2 } { \\partial r^2_{\\parallel } } \\phi(r ) + \\sigma^2   \\label{eq : ap4}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath175 is the one dimensional peculiar velocity dispersion .",
    "the expression for @xmath159 can be further simplified using ( [ eq : ap1 ] ) to obtain @xmath176 \\label{eq : ap5}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]      in this appendix we consider a limiting situation where the separation @xmath96 at which the redshift two - point correlation is being calculated is very large .",
    "we also assume that the real space two - point correlation function is a power law @xmath177 with @xmath178 at large separations .",
    "the power law requirement is not crucial and the arguments presented here are valid provided the integral @xmath179 converges for @xmath180 .    with the power law assumption we have @xmath181 ( eq . [ eq : ap3 ] ) , @xmath182 ( eq .",
    "[ eq : ap5 ] ) and @xmath129 for large values of @xmath96 .",
    "the point to note is that at large separations the correlation between the galaxy peculiar velocities is very small and the pair velocity dispersion is nearly isotropic and has a constant value @xmath131 .",
    "we next shift our attention to equation ( [ eq : a14 ] ) which expresses @xmath0 as a series of different terms involving @xmath84,@xmath62 and @xmath63 . in the linear regime",
    "each of these quantities is characterized by a small number @xmath183 and @xmath184 .",
    "identifying all the terms of order @xmath185 in equation ( [ eq : a14 ] ) we have @xmath186^{m }   + \\frac{1 } { 2^{m-1 } ( m-1 ) ! } \\frac{\\partial^{2m-2}}{\\partial \\st^{2m-2 } } \\ ,   [ \\sig(\\s)]^{m-1 } \\xi_r ( \\s ) \\nonumber \\\\   & + &   \\frac{1 } { 2^{m-1 } ( m-1 ) ! } \\frac{\\partial^{2m-1}}{\\partial \\st^{2m-1 } } \\ ,   [ \\sig(\\s)]^{m-1 } \\vp ( \\s ) \\nonumber \\\\   & + &   \\frac{1 } { 2^{m-2 } ( m-2 ) ! } \\frac{\\partial^{2m-2}}{\\partial \\st^{2m-2 } } \\ ,   [ \\sig(\\s)]^{m-2 } \\frac{\\vp^2(\\s)}{4 } \\sim \\epsilon^{2m}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this contains terms involving different powers of @xmath96 .",
    "the terms whose @xmath96 dependence is @xmath187 fall off slowest with increasing @xmath96 and these terms dominate at large separations . retaining only these terms",
