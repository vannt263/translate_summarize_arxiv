    "electron attachment to sf@xmath0 is a fascinating problem . in spite of a lot of attention and a wealth of experimental data @xcite , some basic questions , e.g. that of lifetimes of metastable sf@xmath2 , lack definitive answers . in this paper",
    "we show that the electron capture process is described well by a zero - range - type model @xcite .",
    "we determine the parameters of the model by comparing the theory with experimental data on the attachment , total and vibrational excitation cross sections .",
    "we then study the autodetachment widths of sf@xmath2 , and analyze its lifetimes and nonexponential decay . here",
    "the experimental situation is less clear .",
    "our calculation yields characteristic lifetimes of about a millisecond , using possibly the most accurate set of sf@xmath2 vibrational frequencies @xcite .",
    "we investigate the nature of nonexponential decay of metastable anions due to level - to - level fluctuations of the widths and a distribution of the incident electron and target energies .",
    "sulfur hexafluoride ( sf@xmath0 ) has long been know as an electron scavenger because of its large low - energy electron attachment cross section .",
    "this feature of sf@xmath0 is important for its applications as a gaseous dielectric and makes for the rich physics of low - energy electron collisions with it .",
    "the energy dependence of the electron capture cross section is well established experimentally @xcite . below 10 mev",
    "it shows @xmath3 behavior characteristic of @xmath1-wave inelastic processes . at higher energies towards 100 mev",
    "it approaches 60% of the unitary limit @xmath4 for the reaction cross sections , where @xmath5 is the incident electron momentum ( atomic units are used throughout ) .",
    "in addition , sf@xmath0 also has a large elastic scattering cross section reaching @xmath6 a.u . at electron energies of a few mev , which can be inferred from the measured total cross section @xcite .",
    "note though that experimental data on low - energy elastic collisions , including differential cross sections @xcite , and inelastic scattering cross sections , e.g. those of vibrational excitations @xcite , are relatively scarce .",
    "low - energy electron attachment leads primarily to the formation of long - lived parent negative ions , @xmath7 at electron energies @xmath8 ev ( and below 3 ev ) dissociative attachment , @xmath9 becomes dominant .",
    "although this process is usually regarded as a channel separate from ( [ eq : att ] ) , some recent evidence suggests that sf@xmath10 can be formed in the decay of metastable sf@xmath2 @xcite , @xmath11 however , at low energies the lifetimes of sf@xmath12 in the absence of collisions are limited by electron autodetachment , @xmath13 numerous sf@xmath12 lifetime measurements @xcite show considerable variation , depending on the technique used .",
    "time - of - flight experiments @xcite typically yield values of several tens of microseconds , while ion - cyclotron - resonance methods @xcite give values of about a millisecond or larger .    using the ion - cyclotron - resonance method , odom _ et al . _ @xcite found that the apparent lifetime of sf@xmath12 varied as a function of the observation time , and surmised that sf@xmath2 were formed in a distribution of states with different lifetimes .",
    "the most recent study that used a penning ion trap @xcite also points to the formation of ions with a range of 110  ms lifetimes .",
    "a similar conclusion was derived from the time - of - flight measurements by delmore and appelhans @xcite at microsecond time scales .",
    "their analysis of the sf@xmath12 decay indicated multiple lifetimes or groups of lifetimes in the interval between 2 to 30  @xmath14s , and showed that the population of states with different lifetimes depended on the temperature of sf@xmath0 molecules . on the other hand , ref .",
    "@xcite where a free jet expansion was used to cool down the sf@xmath0 molecules , reported a single lifetime of @xmath15s .",
    "all these differences are usually attributed to the differences in the experimental conditions under which sf@xmath12 are formed , i.e. , the incident electron energy and the internal energy of the target molecule @xcite . however , detailed understanding is still lacking .",
    "in contrast to the problem of lifetimes , the process of low - energy electron attachment to sf@xmath0 is described well by a simple zero - range - type model of gauyacq and herzenberg @xcite . according to this model , the incoming @xmath1-wave electron undergoes strong resonant scattering on a virtual or weakly bound level of the sf@xmath0 molecule , with a near - zero energy .",
    "electron trapping occurs via population of this fully symmetric state which is strongly coupled to the symmetric stretch ( `` breathing '' ) vibrational mode @xmath16 .",
    "electron capture initiates the motion of the fluorine nuclei towards the equilibrium configuration of the negative ion .",
    "this process is accompanied by rapid intramolecular vibrational redistribution ( ivr ) of the breathing mode energy among other vibrational degrees of freedom . as a result ,",
    "the probability for the nuclei to return to the equilibrium configuration of the neutral sf@xmath0 becomes small , and long - lived metastable anions are formed .    in this paper",
    "we perform a comprehensive study of electron attachment using the zero - range model .",
    "the attachment cross section is sensitive to the behavior of the sf@xmath0 and sf@xmath2 potential energy curves , as a function of the s ",
    "f bond length , near their merging point .",
    "details of this behavior are incorporated in the model via two parameters , namely the energy of the virtual ( or weakly bound ) level and its coupling to the breathing mode .",
    "we develop a new effective matching procedure that connects the region of electron capture near the merging point , where the zero - range model can be applied , with the outer region of adiabatic semiclassical nuclear motion .",
    "we also generalize the model to include the possibility of the nuclear framework to oscillate back to its initial configuration , in order to study the influence of the rate of ivr on @xmath17 collisions .",
    "our aim here is to test the model by comparison with experimental data on the attachment , total and vibrational excitation cross sections , and thus determine its parameters .",
    "another goal is to compare these parameters with the results of potential curve calculations .",
    "the sf@xmath0 and sf@xmath2 potential curves have been established quite well by now @xcite , overcoming earlier uncertainties @xcite .",
    "a somewhat different theoretical approach was taken recently by fabrikant _",
    "it starts from the @xmath18-matrix formalism , and goes beyond the model of gauyacq and herzenberg by including the long - range polarization potential @xmath19 and dipole coupling between the @xmath1 and @xmath20 waves .",
    "contributions of higher electron partial waves are also included , to describe the elastic and vibrational excitation cross sections more accurately . in this theory the two parameters of the @xmath1-wave coupling to the @xmath16 mode are allowed to be complex .",
    "their values are found by fitting the experimental attachment and total cross sections",
    ". however , the use of complex parameters makes them phenomenological , and the physical connection with the molecular potential curves is lost .    the second part of our paper concerns the evaluation of lifetimes of sf@xmath12 due to electron autodetachment .",
    "the first estimates of the metastable anion lifetimes and their relation to the attachment cross section , vibrational spectrum density of sf@xmath2 and electron affinity of sf@xmath0 were made in ref .",
    "the rate constants of the processes ( [ eq : dissoc ] ) and ( [ eq : detach ] ) , were later studied @xcite using the quasi - equilibrium ( or rrkm ) theory @xcite . the approach of refs .",
    "@xcite is based on the principle of detailed balance , and requires the knowledge of the attachment cross section and the anion vibrational spectrum density .",
    "the standard rrkm approach is similar , assuming in addition that the transition probability is unity , i.e. , that the attachment cross section is equal to its unitary limit . on the other hand ,",
    "the rrkm requires the knowledge of the density of so - called transition states .",
    "the autodetachment lifetime depends strongly on such parameters as the electron affinity @xmath21 and vibrational spectrum density of sf@xmath2 , which were not known well . using different sets of data , lifetimes from microseconds to milliseconds",
    "were obtained in a wide range of incident electron energies .",
    "it should be noted that these methods yield the detachment rates ( inverse lifetimes ) _ averaged _ over the ensemble of metastable anion states .",
    "the distribution of lifetimes within such ensemble that may cause a variation in the observed lifetimes , has not been studied .    in the present paper",
    "we analyze the dependence of the autodetachment rate on the incident electron energy in the interval from zero to 300 mev for different target temperatures .",
    "our calculations are based on the accurate values of the attachment cross section , and take into account the distribution of the target sf@xmath0 molecules over the rotational and vibrational states , as well as the rotational and vibrational degrees of freedom of the sf@xmath2 anion .",
    "we also analyse fluctuations of the decay rate over the ensemble of metastable sf@xmath2 , to see if they can explain observations of nonexponential decay .",
    "following the approach of gauyacq and herzenberg @xcite we employ the zero - range potential ( zrp ) model to describe the electron interaction with sf@xmath0 .",
    "zrp theory is a well - known tool suitable for problems of low - energy electron scattering and negative ions @xcite , especially in those cases when the cross section is enhanced by the existence of a shallow bound state or low - lying virtual level with zero angular momentum ( i.e. , in the @xmath1 wave ) .",
    "application of the zrp method to the @xmath17 system provides the wavefunction for the continuous spectrum electron and sf@xmath0 in the vicinity of its equilibrium configuration . on the other hand ,",
    "the wavefunction of sf@xmath2 formed as a result of electron attachment can be described in the born - oppenheimer approximation , treating the nuclear motion semiclassically .",
    "matching of these wavefunctions yields the electron attachment cross section together with those of elastic scattering and vibrational excitation .",
    "the electronic state responsible for the capture process is a fully symmetric weakly bound state of @xmath17 . outside the molecule",
    "the electron wavefunction @xmath22 is spherically symmetric , and is given by @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the electron coordinate and @xmath25 is related to the bound state energy @xmath26 .",
    "the energy @xmath27 depends on all nuclear coordinates",
    ". however , due to its symmetry , this electron state is most strongly coupled to the breathing ( symmetric stretch ) vibrational mode of sf@xmath0 .",
    "this allows one to consider @xmath28 and @xmath25 as functions of the normal coordinate @xmath29 of the breathing mode , @xmath30 , where @xmath18 is the s ",
    "f bond length , and @xmath31 is its value at the equilibrium of sf@xmath0 . near the equilibrium , @xmath32 can be expanded in a power series . keeping the first two terms @xcite , @xmath33 where @xmath34 , since the binding increases with the increase in @xmath18 ( @xmath35 a.u . at the equilibrium of sf@xmath2 , while @xmath36 a.u .",

    "in addition to nonexponential features at small times , the presence of long - lived anions formed by low - energy electrons leads to a nonexponential decay at large times . to illustrate this effect we show for comparison in fig . [",
    "fig : decay34 ] the decay curve for anions formed by monoenergetic electrons with the energy of @xmath264 . also shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : decay34 ] is the decay curve calculated assuming that @xmath192 is conserved ( i.e. , neglecting the effect of the rotational motion on the number of decay channels ) .",
    "as expected , this decay curve is strongly nonexponential , with the apparent lifetime growing as @xmath265 .",
    "this feature of the sf@xmath2 decay was observed experimentally in refs .",
    "it is a consequence of the fact that the fraction of surviving long - lived ions increases with @xmath237 . on the other hand , allowing for the mixing of the rotational quantum number @xmath192 makes for a faster ( exponential ) depletion of sf@xmath2 , which makes it hard to explain how the anion signal can be observed at much longer times .    there is another effect that molecular rotations can have on the sf@xmath12 lifetimes , and that has not been taken into account in the present consideration .",
    "due to a difference between the equilibrium s  f bond lengths of the neutral and anion , the moment of inertia of sf@xmath2 is about 20% greater than that of the neutral .",
    "this means that the contribution of the rotational energy @xmath266 in sf@xmath0 and sf@xmath2 differs by 20% as well . at room temperatures this difference is close to 10 mev , which means that the amount of energy available for ivr in different rotational states is different , and is larger for higher @xmath190",
    "this is another source of fluctuations in the detachment widths , which can in principle affect the anion decay curves .",
    "comparison of calculated cross sections with experimental data demonstrates that low - energy electron attachment to sf@xmath0 proceeds via capture into a virtual state with a strong coupling to the breathing vibrational mode .",
    "the model provides an accurate description of the attachment cross section , and is in agreement with the measured total and vibrational excitation cross sections . from this comparison",
    ", we have determined the two parameters of the model which describe the behaviour of the sf@xmath0 and sf@xmath2 potential curves near the equilibrium of the neutral .",
    "this behaviour is in accord with the quantum chemistry calculations of the potential curves .    by allowing a reflected wave in the nuclear dynamics of the sf@xmath0 breathing mode ,",
    "we have studied the effect of the ivr rate on the cross sections .",
    "comparison with experiment indicates that the ivr in sf@xmath2 formed by electron attachment is very fast , its rate being comparable to the frequency of the breathing mode .    we have evaluated the autodetachment widths of metastable sf@xmath12 resonances , assuming statistical distribution of the energy over the vibrational spectrum of the molecule .",
    "the magnitude of the widths depends strongly on the set of sf@xmath2 vibrational frequencies used , as well as on the adiabatic electron affinity of sf@xmath0 . using the recommended value of 1.06 ev together with the best calculated fundamentals we obtain estimates of sf@xmath12 lifetimes in the 100 @xmath14s to 1 ms range , shorter lifetimes corresponding to the anions formed by higher - energy electrons .",
    "these lifetimes are broadly in agreement with the values inferred in laser photoelectron attachment experiments and found in ion - cyclotron - resonance experiments and in traps . at the same time",
    ", we can not explain the observation of tens of @xmath14s lifetimes in time - of - flight experiments .",
    "such values would be compatible with a much stiffer set of sf@xmath2 fundamentals ( similar to the neutral ) , or smaller electron affinity values .    by using the porter - thomas distribution we have modelled the effect of fluctuations of autodetachment widths due to statistical ( `` chaotic '' ) nature of highly - excited vibrational states of sf@xmath2 .",
    "we have also investigated the effect of sf@xmath0 temperature and electron energy on the sf@xmath12 decay curves .",
    "fluctuations of the widths result in nonexponential decay of sf@xmath12 .",
    "however , the presence of a large number of rotational channels for all but very low temperatures of the neutral molecule makes these effects relatively small .",
    "finally , dissociative attachment into @xmath267 has been largely ignored in the present work .",
    "we believe that it can have only a very small effect on the lifetimes of metastable sf@xmath2 formed at low electron energies .",
    "it appears that for electron energies below 0.2 ev the @xmath268 ions originate from ( thermally activated ) metastable sf@xmath2 .",
    "however , the dissociation signal is low due to a small branching ratio in comparison with autodetachment . at higher electron energies",
    "the sf@xmath10 signal has a large peak . here",
    "the dissociation cross section exceeds that of the @xmath1-wave attachment model . in our view",
    "this means that the main dissociation mechanism at these energies is different from that responsible for the long - lived sf@xmath2 .",
    "when this work was completed , we became aware of two very recent studies of the electron - sf@xmath0 problem .",
    "in the first of these @xcite , the autodetachment lifetimes of metastable sf@xmath2 were studied with a time - of - flight and penning ion trap techniques , for very low ( @xmath269  mev ) electron energies as a function of the gas temperature . at room temperatures only long - lived sf@xmath12 with @xmath270  ms were seen . at higher temperatures shorter lifetimes were observed ( @xmath271 ms ) , together with a small signal of short - lived anions ( @xmath272  @xmath14s ) .",
    "these values are broadly in agreement with our decay curve modelling .",
    "the second set of papers @xcite used kinetic modelling within the framework of the statistical unimolecular rate theory .",
    "it analysed the attachment and dissociation data in a wide range of target and electron temperatures , as well as sf@xmath0 and carrier gas pressures , allowing for additional effects ( e.g. , the rate of ivr as a function of the incident electron energy ) by model factors and fitting parameters .",
    "one of the results of this analysis is an indication of a larger electron affinity of @xmath273  ev .",
    "this value would result in a factor of 35 decrease of our autodetachment widths , and a corresponding increase of the lifetimes .",
    "given the sensitivity of the decay curves to the conditions under which sf@xmath12 are formed , such change still leaves the lifetimes in the 110 ms range , for the conditions similar to those used in ref .",
