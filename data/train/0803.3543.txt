    "the new era of quantum information processing attracts an increasing interest to investigate the intrinsic properties of small - scale electronic devices .",
    "one of the most interesting of such devices is the so called quantum point contacts ( qpcs ) , where a quantized current is transmitted through it under certain conditions  @xcite .",
    "they are constructed on two dimensional electron systems ( 2des ) either by inducing electrostatic potential on the plane of 2des and/or by chemically etching the structure .",
    "the essential physics is that , the small size of the constraint creates quantized energy levels in one dimension ( perpendicular to the current direction ) therefore , transport takes place depending on whether the energy of the electron coincides with this quantized energy or not . in the ideal case at low bias voltages ,",
    "if the energy of the electron is smaller then the lowest eigen - energy of the constraint , no current can pass through the qpc . otherwise , only a certain integer number of levels ( channels ) are involved , therefore conductance is quantized  @xcite . beyond being a useful play ground for the basic quantum mechanical applications",
    "many other interesting features are reported in the literature such as the 0.7 conductance anomaly  @xcite , which became a paradigm since then .",
    "another adjustable parameter which induces quantization on the 2des is the magnetic field @xmath0 applied perpendicularly to the system .",
    "such an external field changes not only the density of states ( dos ) profile of the 2des but also the screening properties of the system drastically . the interesting physics dictated by this quantization",
    "is observed as the quantum hall effects  @xcite .",
    "recent theoretical investigations point out the importance of the electron - electron interactions in explaining the integer quantum hall effect  @xcite , believed to be irrelevant in the early days of this field  @xcite , which we discuss briefly in this work .",
    "the basic idea behind the inclusion of the interaction is as follows : due to the perpendicular magnetic field the energy spectrum is discrete , known as the landau levels ( lls ) , and is given by @xmath1 where @xmath2 is a positive integer and cyclotron energy is defined as @xmath3 , with effective electron mass @xmath4 .",
    "taking into account the finite size of the sample , i.e. the confinement potential , and the mutual interaction ( hartree ) potential , one obtains the total potential . in the next step for a fixed average electron density one calculates the resulting electron density distribution and from this distribution re - calculates the potential distribution iteratively .",
    "this self - consistent calculation ends in formation of the _ compressible _ and _ incompressible _ regions .",
    "in a situation where fermi energy @xmath5 is pinned to one of the lls , then the system is compressible .",
    "otherwise , if @xmath5 falls in between two consecutive lls , the system is known to be incompressible and , since there are no available states at the @xmath5 for electrons to be redistributed , screening is poor .",
    "however , within these incompressible regions the resistivity vanishes , hence all the applied current is confined to these regions .",
    "we will be discussing the details of this model in sec.[sec:4 ] .",
    "most recently , the experiments performed at the 2des including the qpcs , in the presence of an external magnetic field , manifested peculiar results  @xcite . in the first set of experiments electron interference , such as mach - zehnder ( mz )  @xcite and aharonov - bohm ( ab )  @xcite , was investigated .",
    "the mz interference experiments exhibit a novel and yet unexplained behavior , regarding the interference contrast ( visibility ) at the interferometer in the nonlinear transport regime ( finite transport voltage ) . as a function of voltage ,",
    "the visibility displayed oscillations whose period was found to be independent of the path lengths of the interferometer , in striking contrast to any straightforward theoretical model ( e.g. using landauer - bttiker edge states ( lbes )  @xcite ) . in particular , a new energy scale , of order of @xmath6ev , emerged , determining the periodicity of the pattern .",
    "this unexpected behavior of interfering electrons is believed to be related to electron - electron interactions  @xcite .",
    "the most satisfying model existing in the literature is proposed by i. p. levkivskyi and e. v. sukhorukov  @xcite .",
    "however , other schemes also including interactions are present  @xcite and models , which consider a non - gaussian noise as a source of the visibility oscillations  @xcite , without interaction .",
    "the novel magnetic focusing experiments concerning qpcs has revealed the scattering processes taking place near these devices@xcite .",
    "it was explicitly shown that , the experimental realization of the sample and the device itself strongly effects the transport properties .",
    "it is reported that , the potential profile generated by the donors ( impurities ) and the gates deviates strongly from the ideal `` point '' contact . even in each cool down process , since the impurity distribution changes , the quantum interference fringes differ considerably .",
    "hence a realistic modelling of a qpc is desirable , which we partially attack in this work .",
    "another interesting set of experiments within the integer quantum hall regime is conducted by s. roddaro et.al@xcite , where the transmission is investigated as a function of the gate bias .",
    "the findings show that current transmission strongly deviates from the expected chiral luttinger liquid  @xcite behavior , since the transmission is either enhanced or suppressed by changing the gate bias .",
    "this effect was attributed to the particle hole symmetry of the luttinger liquid and is discussed in detail in ref .",
    ". however , the explicit treatment of the qpc was left unresolved . since the essential physics can be still governed by considering a finite size qpc opening , therefore assuming formation of a ( integer ) filling region sufficient .",
    "the theoretical investigation of qpcs covers a wide variety of approaches , which can be grouped into two : i ) the models that include electron - electron interactions and ii ) the models that do not . at the very simple model in describing the qpcs ,",
    "one considers a potential barrier perpendicular to the current direction quantizing the energy levels .",
    "therefore the electrons are considered to be plane waves before they reach to the qpc and transmission and reflection coefficients are calculated from this potential profile .",
    "a better ( 2d ) approximation is to model the qpcs with well defined functions@xcite , such as ellipses which lead to analytic solutions for the energy eigenfunctions and energies .",
    "about a decade ago j. davies and his co - workers developed the `` frozen charge '' model  @xcite to calculate the potential profile induced by the gates defining the qpc .",
    "this approach is still one of the most used technique to obtain the potential profile , however , it is not self - consistent and completely ignores the donors and surface charges .",
    "there exists many theories which takes the potential profile from the frozen charge model as an initial condition , and provides explicit calculation schemes to obtain charge , current and potential distributions  @xcite .",
    "one of the most complete scheme , even in the presence of an external @xmath0 field , is the local spin density approximation ( lsda ) within the density functional theory ( dft )  @xcite . the lsda+dft  @xcite approaches are powerful to describe the essential physics of density distribution and even 0.7 anomaly phenomenologically , however , the description of the current distribution is still under debate .",
    "the scattering problem through the qpcs is usually handled by the `` wave packet '' formalism and is very successful in explaining the magnetic focusing experiments .",
    "however , the potential profile is not calculated self - consistently and therefore , the effect of the incompressible strips resulting from electron - electron interaction is not taken in to account .    back to early days of the theories that account for electron interactions , i.e. chklovskii , shklovskii and glazman  @xcite ( csg ) and chklovskii , matveev and shklovskii  @xcite ( cms ) models ,",
    "the influence of the formation of the incompressible strips has been highlighted . in the cms paper",
    ", it was even conjectured that , _",
    "the ballistic conductance of the qpc in strong magnetic field is given by the filling factor at the saddle point of the electron density distribution multiplied by _",
    "@xmath7 , which is quantized only if an incompressible strip ( region ) resides at the saddle point . in one of the recent approaches , in the presence of a strong @xmath0 field ,",
    "the electron - electron interaction is treated explicitly within the thomas - fermi approximation ( tfa ) self - consistently , meanwhile the current distribution is left unresolved  @xcite . in this model ,",
    "similar to other approaches , the bare confinement potential is obtained from the `` frozen charge '' approximation , which in turn lead to discrepancies due to its non - self - consistent approach . here , we improve on this previous work in two main aspects : i ) the electrostatic potential is obtained self - consistently in 3d , which allows us to treat also the etched structures ii ) the current distribution is calculated explicitly using the local version of the ohm s law , also in the out of linear response regime .",
    "we organize our work as follows : in sec.[sec:2 ] , we briefly describe the numerical scheme to calculate the potential profile at @xmath8 following ref .",
    "[ ] , which is based on iterative solution of the poisson equation in 3d .",
    "in particular , we study the effect of different gate geometries and focus on the comparison of the potential profiles of gate and etch defined qpcs . the numerical scheme to calculate potential and density profiles at finite temperature and magnetic field is introduced in sec.[sec:3 ] .",
    "here , we review the essential ingredients of the tfa and discuss the limitations of our approach .",
    "sec.[sec:4 ] is dedicated in investigating the current distribution within the local ohm s law  @xcite , where we consider both the linear response ( lr ) and out of linear response ( olr ) regimes . in the olr",
    ", we show that the large current bias induces an asymmetric distribution of the incompressible strips , due to the tilting of the landau levels resulting from the position dependent chemical potential .",
    "we conclude our work by a summary .",
    "the realistic modelling of 2des relies on solving the 3d poisson equation for given boundary conditions , set by the hetero - structure ( gaas / algaas in our calculations ) and the gate pattern , which describes the charge and potential distribution .",
    "the hetero - structure , shown in fig.[fig:1]a , consists of ( metallic ) surface gates ( dark semi - elliptic regions on surface ) , a thin donor layer ( denoted by light thin layer and @xmath9 silicon doping ) which provides electrons to the 2des and the 2des itself indicated by minus signs confined to a thin area .",
    "the 2des is formed at the interface of the hetero - structure .",
    "the average electron density @xmath10 ( and its spatial distribution @xmath11 ) is dictated by the donor density @xmath12 and the metallic gates .",
    "once the number of donors and the gate voltage @xmath13 are fixed , the potential and charge distribution of the system can be obtained by solving the poisson equation , self - consistently .    for typical nanoscale devices with many ( or at least a few ) electrons in each of the electrostatically - defined regions , the charge distribution and the major energy scales",
    "are described to a good approximation by classical electrostatics . due to the strong electric fields generated by segregating charge in a 2des",
    ", the coulomb energy is the dominant energy scale . in this sense , it is desirable to have a self - consistent electrostatic description of the system if one expects a good quantitative description thereof .",
    "for solving the electrostatics of the system in three dimensions we used a code developed and successfully applied in previous studies  @xcite .",
    "it is based on a 4@xmath14 order algorithm operating on a square grid .",
    "the code allows flexible implementation of many boundary conditions relevant for nanoscale electrostatics : standard boundaries such as conducting regions at constant voltage ( potential gates ) , of constant charge ( large quantum dots ) or charge density ( doping ) , but also boundaries such as a depletable 2deg , dielectric boundaries and surfaces of semiconductors with the fermi energy pinned due to surface charges . since the calculation is constrained to a finite volume of space including the surface of the sample , the outer boundary is considered open and is also obtained self - consistently along with the rest of the calculation .",
    "overall the code provides a reliable description of the potential landscape and thus the electric field as well as the charge distribution for the sample under consideration .    as an illustrating example in fig.[fig:1 ]",
    "we show the hetero - structure under investigation together with the charge distributions at different layers .",
    "area of the unit cell is @xmath15 @xmath6m@xmath16 , whereas the hight is chosen to be @xmath17 nm .",
    "the donor and the electron layer lies @xmath18 nm and @xmath19 nm below the surface , respectively .",
    "the metallic gates are deposited on the surface of the structure and are biased with @xmath20 v and a homogeneous donor distribution is assumed , fig .",
    "[ fig:1]c .",
    "the induced charge distribution on the metallic gates exhibits apparent inhomogeneities shown in fig.[fig:1]b .",
    "the electrons are accumulated near the boundaries of the gates , a well known behavior for metallic boundary conditions .",
    "however , here we provide the explicit distribution which strongly differs from the previously used `` frozen charge '' model where only a constant potential profile is assumed .",
    "the influence of these induced charges become more important when considering an external @xmath0 field . since , the steepness of the external potential profile determines the effective widths of the current carrying incompressible strips .",
    "we should note that , our self - consistent model enables us also to handle the ( side ) surface charges which becomes important when considering chemical etching . in the following part",
    "we investigate systematically , the effects of the gate voltage and the device geometry on the electrostatic quantities .",
    "( color online ) ( a ) the silicon doped hetero - structure , the 2des is formed at the interface of the gaas / algaas ( denoted by minus signs ) and the metallic gates are deposited on the surface . at zero gate bias ,",
    "the electron density is determined by the number of donors , which we chose to be @xmath21 @xmath22 .",
    "charge distribution at different layers , at the gates ( b ) , the dopant layer ( c ) and the 2des ( d ) .",
    "it is clearly seen that not all the excess electrons are captured by the 2des , rather a significant amount is accumulated on the surface .",
    "the electrostatic quantities are normalized with the relevant scales , i.e. charge ( density ) is normalized with the average electron density ( e.g. @xmath23 ) and electrostatic potential ( energy ) with the potential energy of a single electron . ]",
    "( color online ) spatial distribution of the electrons as a function of the gate voltage . at zero bias ( a ) more",
    "electrons are populated under the gate which changes till depletion starts ( b - d ) , where the gate voltage is set to be ( b ) -0.3v ( c ) -0.7v ( d ) -1.0 v. almost no electrons are left beyond -1.5v applied to the gates , ( e ) -1.5v ( f ) -2.0 v. ]      in this subsection we compare the electron density profiles calculated for different qpc geometries applying various bias voltages , which exhibits strong non - linear behavior in contrast to many models used in the literature .",
    "we start our discussion with a rather smooth configuration , where the distance between the gates ( @xmath24 ) is chosen to be @xmath25 nm ( see fig.[fig:1]a ) . in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] we show the cross section of the electron density profile for different gate voltages .",
    "interestingly , at @xmath26 we see that more electrons are residing beneath the gates .",
    "this effect is due to inhomogeneous ( induced ) charge distribution at the metallic gates similar to the distribution shown in fig.[fig:1]d .",
    "the induced charges are mostly accumulated near the gate boundaries , whereas the center of the gates has almost a constant charge profile .",
    "increasing @xmath13 to -0.3 volts , already starts to depopulate electrons under the gates and the depopulation rate remains linear to the applied gate potential until the 2des becomes depleted . in the @xmath27 $ ] volt interval , the density distribution changes relatively smooth , since the electrons can still screen the external potential quite well .",
    "it is important to recall that , in the absence of an external @xmath0 field , the dos of a 2des is just a constant @xmath28 ( @xmath29 mev@xmath30 @xmath22 for gaas ) , which is set by the sample properties , therefore screening is nearly perfect . whereas this changes considerably when the electrons are depleted under the gate",
    "this is observed by the strong drop of the potential when the depletion bias is reached around @xmath31 v. a sudden variation appears at the potential profile when the electrons are depleted beneath the gates ( @xmath32 nm ) where the @xmath13 becomes larger than -1.5 v. therefore , the simple picture describing the qpcs as a smooth function of the applied gate voltage fails . in that picture it is assumed that the fermi energy of the system remains constant and the potential profile , given by a well defined function , of the constriction is simply shifted by the amount of potential applied to the gates .",
    "such a model is reasonable in the regime where the gate voltage is small enough that no electrons are essentially depleted .",
    "however , as mentioned above , when the barrier hight is larger than the fermi energy there exists no electrons to screen the external potential and the potential distribution must be calculated self - consistently .",
    "another adjustable parameter which can be accessed experimentally is the geometry of the structure .",
    "of course , in the simplistic models describing qpcs this does not play an important role , since the constriction is assumed to be isotropic in the current direction , in contrast to the experimental findings .",
    "it is well known that , the shape of the qpcs , as well as the cooling and biassing procedure , is important when measuring interference or magnetic focusing . in fig.[fig:4 ] , we compare two different gate patterns considering typical gate separations @xmath24 for a fixed gate voltage , @xmath33 v. the smooth configuration ( c1 ) , exhibits a stronger non - linear behavior when @xmath24 is changed from @xmath25 nm ( black dashed line ) to @xmath34 nm ( red dashed line ) .",
    "this relies on the fact that , at the first order approximation , the screening is better when more electrons are accumulated at the opening of the qpc .",
    "however , since the screened potential @xmath35 can be obtained from the external potential @xmath36 via the thomas - fermi screening , v _",
    "scr^q = v_ext^q/(q ) , [ screen1 ] where @xmath37 , is the thomas - fermi dielectric function with @xmath38 being the momentum and @xmath39 nm for gaas ) the effective bohr radius , the long range fluctuations ( large @xmath38 ) , compared to @xmath40 , are less screened whereas the short range fluctuations are predominantly screened .",
    "considering the sharp configuration ( c2 ) this observation becomes more evident , since the potential profile across the qpc varies smoother than of the configuration ( c1 ) , when varying @xmath24 . from an experimentalists point of view , therefore , drawing shaper qpc structures by electron beam lithography may lead to a better ( linear ) control of the potential profile which is closer to the ideal potential profile .",
    "this is certainly in contrast to what we would expect from an non - interacting model , however , it is known by the experimentalists that defining the qpcs with sharper edges increase the quality of the visibility signal  @xcite .",
    "for the c2 configuration we also observe that , the potential profile becomes almost insensitive to the width @xmath24 above 300 nm , which coincides with our previous finding of better screening of the long range fluctuations .",
    "it is worth to note that , our calculation scheme is beyond the simple thomas - fermi screening scheme in obtaining the bare confinement potential  @xcite .",
    "it fully takes into account the interaction effects , however , does not include any quantum mechanical effects . in a better approximation , of course , one should also solve the schrdinger equation self - consistently in 3d .",
    "this procedure is known to be costly in terms of computational cost even only if the 2des is treated quantum mechanically .",
    "since we are interested in either zero or very strong magnetic fields , representing electron as a point charge is still a reasonable and valid approximation .",
    "we will discuss the justification of this assumption in the presence of an external magnetic field in more detail in sec .",
    "[ sec:3 ] , where we also discuss the limitations of our model .",
    "( color online ) potential profile across the qpcs for two different geometrical patterns .",
    "insets depict the smooth ( c1 ) and the sharp edged ( c2 ) patterns .",
    "dark ( blue ) regions are electron depleted , i.e. the local potential is larger than the @xmath5 , denoted by the solid thick horizontal line .",
    "white contours denote the depletion boundary , where the width of the qpc is set to be 200 nm and the curvature is changed .",
    "the dashed lines stand for the first configuration and two different @xmath24 values ( @xmath41 nm ( black ) and @xmath34 nm ( red ) ) , whereas for the sharper configuration four @xmath24 values are selected . ]",
    "the different configurations of the gate patterns are also important when investigating the scattering processes by magnetic focusing experiments  @xcite .",
    "it is apparent that the scattering patterns of the electron waves will not only depend on the impurity distribution but also on the structure of the qpc s .",
    "we expect that for the sharper defined qpc ( c2 ) the scattering should depend weakly on the qpc opening , since the width does not change along the constraint .",
    "whereas , for c1 configuration small changes at @xmath24 should affect the scattered waves drastically .",
    "another comment on the experimental setups is to the roddaro  @xcite experiments , since the formation of ( stable ) integer filling region is important to explain  @xcite the findings , we believe that c2 type configurations would be leading to a better resolution of the transmission amplitudes .",
    "the choice of the structure and the width apparently depends on the experimental interest , which is believed to be irrelevant when modelling qpcs as ideal point contacts , and the qpc s are not only defined by gates but alternatively also by chemical etching .",
    "the gated structures are of course more controllable , however , at high gate voltages required for depletion , electrical sparks can occur , therefore the structure can even be destroyed . in such situations etching defined qpcs",
    "are preferred , although without further gates one loses the full control of the potential profile . in the next section , we will compare the potential profiles of etched and gate defined qpc s , to show that in some cases etch defined qpc s may be more useful to obtain steeper potential profiles .",
    "potential cross - section of ( a ) gated and respectively ( b ) etched qpc s at selected gate biases and etching depths for c1 at a fixed @xmath42 nm . insets focus on the high bias or shallow etching profiles ]    for simple calculation purposes , qpcs are modelled either as a finite potential well or with a parabolic confinement potential , perpendicular to the current direction . starting from the early experiments  @xcite , usually the conductance is measured as a function of the applied gate voltage which presents clear quantized values .",
    "this quantization can be well explained by the landauer formula  @xcite g=_n , m=1^n_c|t_n , m|^2 , [ eq : landauer]where ballistic transport is assumed to take place , i.e. the transmission is given by @xmath43 , and no channel mixing is allowed .",
    "the ( integer ) number of channels @xmath44 is defined by the fermi energy and the width of the constriction , in general .",
    "the gate defined qpcs , at a first order approximation , can be represented by parabolic or finite well potential profiles .",
    "however , it is known that the chemical etching process creates ( side ) surface charges , which in turn generates a steeper potential profile at the edges of the sample .",
    "in this situation it is apparent that , the confinement potential can not be assumed to be parabolic , rather a steeper potential should be considered . in this section",
    "we compare these two different constriction profiles , namely the gated and the etched ones .",
    "the self - consistent potential across the qpc at the center is plotted versus the lateral coordinate in fig .",
    "[ fig:5 ] .",
    "the 2des under the gates is depleted at the gate voltages larger than @xmath45 v , similarly when the depth of the etching is larger than @xmath46 nm . in both cases , till the depletion is reached the potential profile is varying rather smoothly and the depth of the potential depends linearly on the applied gate bias or the depth .",
    "this behavior is drastically changed when electrons are depleted , the potential now strongly depends on the gate potential or depth .",
    "moreover , for the etched structure , potential becomes very steep at the edge of the qpc when @xmath47 nm , i.e. is deeper than the donor layer .",
    "the transition from linear behavior to non - linear behavior is simply due to the significant change of the screening properties of the system .",
    "once the electrons are depleted , the external potential can no longer be screened , therefore the amplitude of the self - consistent potential increases by a large amount .",
    "therefore , screening calculations based on the formula given in eqn .",
    "( [ screen1 ] ) can not account for such situations , where the dielectric function is not aware of the fermi energy , i.e. the occupancy .",
    "a better approximation to this approach is to consider a linhard type dielectric function , which also takes into account the fermi momentum  @xcite .",
    "it is known that , such an improvement will also cover some of the quantum mechanical aspects ( such as the wave functions ) , which brings extra oscillations to the potential profile  @xcite . however , for our present interest we neglect this correction knowing that the self - consistency of the calculation scheme already takes into account the occupation and the 1d electron density at the qpc satisfy the validity condition @xmath48 of the tfa  @xcite .",

    "[ fig:6 ] , where we show the electron density ( left ) and potential profiles ( right ) for typical gate biases @xmath49 and etching depths @xmath50 versus the spatial coordinate .",

    "figure  [ fig:6]a depicts the density profile for selected depths of etching varying from shallow ( @xmath54 nm ) to deep ( @xmath55 nm ) . for the smallest two @xmath50 s , the 2des is not depleted beneath the pattern and the density profile is rather smooth .",
    "depletion is observed when the depth is larger than @xmath56 nm , however , until the etching depth reaches to the depth of 2des ( @xmath57 nm ) we do not see the surface charges ( the spike like point , indicated by the arrow ) at the level of the 2des .",
    "the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig:6]b shows the electron density distribution in a color coded contour plot together with the corresponding potential profile across the white ( dashed ) line .",
    "the thin ( green ) lines contouring the depleted ( red ) region indicates the spatial distribution of the surface charges .",
    "the potential is steeper compared to that of the gated one ( fig .",
    "[ fig:6]d ) and the profile does not show any considerable variation once the etching depth reaches the plane of the 2des .",
    "this behavior clearly exhibits the uncontrollability of the etched samples , since the corresponding potential profile obtained for the gated samples vary slowly on the length scales of the fermi wavelength , even if the 2des is completely depleted beneath the gates .",
    "moreover , the amplitude of the potential strongly depends on the applied gate voltage .",
    "the slow variation of the potential is not the case for the etched sample , for example consider the case when @xmath50 is changed from 57.3 to 78.4 nm , and compare it with that of the gated sample when voltage is changed from @xmath58 v to @xmath59 v. for the gated sample the potential profile remains still smooth , however , the spatial distribution of the electron density is almost unchanged .",
    "meanwhile , for the deeply etched sample both the electron density and the potential profile are steep and the steepness depends very weakly on the etching depth .    from the above discussion",
    "we conclude that , for the gated samples the electron density distribution is weakly effected by the applied gate potential when the depletion is once obtained , meanwhile the potential is smooth and strongly depends on @xmath60 . for the etched samples ,",
    "potential profile becomes very steep when the etching depth exceeds the depth of the 2des , since the ( side ) surface charges pin the fermi level at the mesa surface to the mid gap of gaas forming a schottky like barrier  @xcite .",
    "we should also note that , at zero bias , more electrons are populated under the gates , which is not the case for the etched samples . as a rule of a thumb , when a steeper potential profile is required one should consider chemical etching where the etching depth is deeper than the electron layer and one should keep in mind that biasing gates with high potential does not necessarily imply that the electron density profile is also changed considerably .",
    "spatial distribution of the electron density ( a , c ) and screened potential ( b , d ) for etched ( upper panel ) and gated samples ( lower panel ) , @xmath61 nm . ]    the outcome of the self - consistent solution of the 3d poisson equation considering qpcs at zero magnetic field is two fold : i ) the geometrical properties ( i.e. considering c1 or c2 type patterns ) strongly change the potential landscape in the close vicinity of the qpcs .",
    "we found that the smoother constrictions with a larger width @xmath24 can be modelled better with the ideal point contacts , i.e. parabolic confinement .",
    "the sharper constrictions can be considered as finite well profiles , up to a first order approximation and potential profile remains unchanged when considering @xmath62 nm . ii ) due to surface pinning the etched samples , generate steeper potential profiles and the density profile remains unaffected once etching is deeper than the depth of the 2des .",
    "these numerical results , show a strong deviation from the the widely used `` ideal point contact '' and `` frozen charge '' models , proposing that depending on the experimental interest it is important to reconsider the geometrical ( c1 , c2 ) and structural ( gated / etched ) factors defining the qpc under investigation . as final remark ,",
    "the artifacts , such as local minima and maxima at the potential and density profiles , resulting from the previous non - self consistent thomas - fermi  @xcite and `` frozen charge '' models  @xcite are resolved by considering the 3d calculation scheme .",
    "the aim of this and the next section is to calculate , and compare , the density and subsequently the current distributions , in the close vicinity of the qpcs , within interacting and non - interacting models in the presence of an external perpendicular magnetic field .",
    "here we take into account electron - electron interaction within the thomas - fermi theory of screening also considering strong magnetic fields using the potential profile calculated in the previous section , as an initial configuration of the landscape .",

    "then we can replace the wavefunctions in both directions by wave packets centered at @xmath89 , and at @xmath52 and the center coordinate dependent eigenenergy @xmath90 can be approximated to @xmath91 .",

    "the computational effort to calculate electron and potential profiles within the tfa is much less than that of the full quantum mechanical calculation procedures .",
    "the results of both agree quantitatively very well in certain magnetic field intervals where the widths of the incompressible strips @xmath100 ( in which the potential changes strongly ) is larger than @xmath101 .",

[ ] , where a simpler quasi - hartree scheme is proposed to recover the artifacts arising from tfa .",
    "historically , the first implementation of the tfa , including electron interactions , to quantum hall systems goes back to the seminal work by chklovskii et.al  @xcite .",
    "there it was shown that within the electrostatic approximation the 2des is divided into two regions which have completely different screening properties . in this model , a translation invariance",
    "is assumed in the current ( @xmath103 ) direction . due to finite widths of the samples in the @xmath51 direction",
    "the electrostatic potential is bent upwards at the edges of the sample , hence the landau levels , @xmath104 .",
    "inclusion of the coulomb interaction and the pinning of the fermi energy to the landau levels result in two regions ( strips ) : i ) the fermi energy is pinned to one of the highly degenerate landau levels , then the screening is perfect , effective potential is completely flat ( metal like ) and electron density varies spatially ii ) the fermi energy falls in between two consecutive landau levels , screening is poor , effective ( screened ) potential varies ( the amplitude of the variation is @xmath69 ) and electron density is constant over this region . it is apparent that , if the potential varies rapidly on the scale of @xmath101 , the tfa fails and the results become unreliable .",
    "this condition is realized when considering narrow incompressible strips having a width smaller than the magnetic length .",
    "therefore , one should include the effect of wave functions within these narrow strips .",
    "one way is , of course , to do full hartree calculations .",
    "we already mentioned the challenges in the computational effort .",
    "a simpler approach is to replace the delta wave functions of the tfa with the unperturbed landau wave functions , i.e. quasi hartree approximation  @xcite(qha ) .",
    "the findings of the qha is shown to be more reasonable than of the tfa , which now also includes the finite extend of the wave functions in the close vicinity of the incompressible strips . therefore , as an end result , when the @xmath102 condition is reached the incompressible strip disappear due to the overlap of the neighboring wave functions .",
    "based on this fact , in our calculations in the following we will exclude the effects arising from the artifacts of the tfa by considering a spatial averaging of the electron density on the length scales smaller than @xmath101 , which is known to be relevant in simulating the quantum mechanical effects  @xcite .",
    "we should also make one more point clear that with the nscesa usually a gate defined quantum hall bar is considered .",
    "it is more common to define hall bars by chemical etching and the edge potential profile is much more steep compared to gated samples which was shown in the previous section .",
    "therefore , to fit the predictions of this model concerning the widths and the positions of the incompressible strips with the experimental data one has to assume that  @xcite i ) the 2des and the gates are on the same plane and ii ) the gate voltage applied should be fixed to the half of the mid gap of the gaas , i.e. pinning of the fermi energy at the gaas surface .",
    "in fact , after making these two crucial assumptions the experimental findings of e. ahlswede  @xcite perfectly fits with the nscesa .",
    "however , the widths ( and the existence ) of the incompressible strips strongly deviate from the predictions , since only the innermost incompressible strip can be observed .",
    "we have argued that , the widths of the incompressible strips strongly depend on the slope of the potential , i.e. if the external potential is steep the incompressible strips are narrow",
    ". therefore one can easily conclude that , since the widths of the outermost incompressible strips become smaller than the magnetic length , the outer incompressible strips , i.e. the ones close to the edge , disappear and could not be observed .",
    "the overestimation of the @xmath100 within the tfa becomes more severe when an external current is imposed to the system , which we will discuss in the next section . before discussing the results of the relaxed tfa",
    ", we want to touch another locally defined quantity , namely the dos , and comment on the implementation of the global dos to our local tfa .    in the absence of impurity scattering the dos of an infinite ( spin - less ) 2des",
    "is given by the bare landau dos as d(e)= _ n(e - e_n ) however , this dos is broadened by the scattering processes , which can be described in self - consistent born approximation  @xcite accurately for short range impurity potentials yielding a semi elliptic broadening .",
    "of course , other impurity models and scattering processes can also be considered resulting in gaussian or lorentzian broadened landau dos  @xcite . in such descriptions of the dos broadening an infinite 2des",
    "is assumed and the dos is calculated for impurity distributions averaged over all possible configurations . inserting this ( global ) dos in eqn .",
    "( [ eq : tfadensity ] ) can be justified again if the tfa condition is satisfied .",
    "we have already shown that this condition is violated when a narrow incompressible strip is formed where the external potential is poorly screened .",
    "therefore , the actual distribution of the impurity potential becomes more effective at these transparent regions .",
    "we should also note that the effect of screening on the dos of an infinite system has been investigated in detail in ref .",
    "[ ] and it has been shown that , since the screening is poor within the incompressible regions , the dos becomes much broader than that of the non - interacting case . hence , the gap between two consecutive landau levels is narrower within the incompressible strips compared to compressible strips .",
    "moreover , recently it has been shown that the ( local ) electric field within the sample also leads to broadening of the ( local ) dos  @xcite .",
    "the idea is basically that one calculates the greens function for the given potential profile , which is a function of the applied magnetic field and external current , and obtains the local dos from the general expression d(e,(x , y))=_n|_n , k_y(x , y)|^2(e-_n , k_y),where @xmath105 is the @xmath2th eigenfunction of the hamiltonian given at eqn .",
    "( [ eq : effecham ] ) with the eigenvalue @xmath106 . in our above discussion about the formation of the compressible / incompressible strips we have mentioned that the potential varies locally whenever an incompressible strip is formed , where the variation is linear in position up to a first order approximation .",
    "now let us consider a linear potential profile and re - obtain the local dos ( ldos ) following  @xcite for the @xmath107th landau level , d_k(e)=e^-e^2_k/^2[h_k(e_k/)]^2 [ eq : ldos]with the level width parameter = _ xl where @xmath108 is the electric field in the @xmath51 direction and @xmath109 .",
    "the immediate consequence of a strong electric field in the @xmath51 direction is a broadening of the ldos , which happens at the incompressible strips .",

    "these integers are just the number of channels @xmath44 , i.e. the number of eigen energies below the fermi energy . a similar path is followed when considering an external @xmath0 field , which assumes that the conductance is ballistic within 1d channels and neglects the electron interactions .",
    "these 1d channels are formed whenever the fermi energy coincides with a landau level ( landauer - bttiker picture ) . before proceeding with the full self - consistent solution of the density and current distribution problem",

    "the relation between @xmath126 and @xmath135 is interesting , the conductance is quantized , as soon as @xmath135 vanishes at large fields , however , becomes non - quantized even though the @xmath136 at the lower edge of the zero resistance state .",
    "let us first discuss the @xmath0 dependence of the @xmath135 , it is finite if the system is compressible and is zero if an incompressible strip percolates from one edge of the sample to the other edge in the current direction , i.e. from source to drain .",
    "therefore , existence of an is percolating is sufficient enough to measure zero longitudinal resistance .",
    "however , to have a conductance quantization the center of the qpc should be incompressible , which is a stronger restriction  @xcite .",
    "hence , in the lower edge of the qhp , the is percolates but the center of the qpc is compressible .",
    "the implication of this fact to the coherence is a bit more complicated , we have seen that as soon as one enters to the qhp a large bulk is is formed therefore the phase of the electrons is highly averaged .",
    "this implies that the coherence is relatively less than that of the two well separated iss . on the other hand , at the lower edge of the conductance plateau , the iss become narrower and are less immune to decoherence effects arising from the environment , hence , the coherence is reduced .",
    "our above discussion coincides with the recent experiments performed in small mach - zehnder interference devices ( mzi ) , where the visibility is measured as a function of the external magnetic field  @xcite .",
    "it is fair to note that , some other mechanisms providing @xmath0 dependence of decoherence can also account for such a behavior .    in the mentioned mzi experiments  @xcite and also the measurements performed at the group of s. roddaro  @xcite a finite ( and large ) source drain voltage @xmath137",
    "is applied either to measure the @xmath137 dependency of the visibility or the transmission .",
    "the intensity of the applied current , in these experiments , can not be treated within the linear response regime , where the electrochemical potential remains constant , i.e. position independent . in the next section , we present the current and the density distribution calculated where eqn .",
    "( [ eq : linearrespone ] ) does not hold any more .      in the absence of an external current an equilibrium state",
    "is obtained by solving the eqns .",
    "( [ eq : tfadensity ] ) and ( [ eq : tfapotential ] ) self - consistently . even in the presence of a small current ,",
    "a hall potential is generated which , in principle , modifies the electrochemical potential , i.e. tilts the landau levels .",
    "this modification can be compensated by the redistribution of the electrons , which certainly modifies the total electrostatic potential .",
    "if the applied current is sufficiently small , the modification is negligible , i.e. linear response .",
    "however , if the current is large , the resulting hall potential is also large and one should re - calculate the electron density , and therefore the potential distribution till a steady state is reached . in this section",
    "we present the current and density distribution in the presence of a large external current , where a local equilibrium is assumed implicitly .",
    "the local filling factor distribution and the corresponding local current density calculated at the default temperature .",
    "the current intensity is sufficiently high ( @xmath138 a / m ) to induce an asymmetry on the density distribution via position dependent electrochemical potential . ]",
    "[ fig:10]a shows the electron density distribution in color scale for @xmath139 t , where the intensity of the applied current is in the out of linear response regime .",
    "note that the @xmath0 value is chosen such that the hall resistance is quantized , however , the conductance is not .",
    "the general behavior is similar to that of linear response , however , it is clearly seen that the widths of the iss are asymmetric with respect to @xmath140 nm line , where current is driven in @xmath52 direction .",
    "the asymmetry is induced by the large current , since the electrons are redistributed according to the new ( self - consistent ) potential distribution . the corresponding current density distribution is plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig:10]b , once more the one to one correspondence between the positions of the iss and the local current maxima is apparent .",
    "the consequence of the asymmetry and thereby the widening of the iss can be observed in the conductance and the @xmath135 , such that the narrow is at the upper side is smeared out much earlier than the one on the lower side .",
    "we should note that , such large currents heat the sample therefore the local temperature within the iss is larger compared to the lattice temperature due to joule heating  @xcite . such a ( local ) temperature dependence",
    "is treated explicitly by h. akera  @xcite and his co - workers and a strong evidence is provided towards explaining the breakdown of the iqhe within this approach .",
    "our present approach lacks such a treatment , therefore the competition between the widening of the iss and heating due to large currents is thought to be more complicated than presented here . as a consequence ,",
    "the discussion of the coherence is far beyond our model , however , we think that the amplitude of the current when measuring visibility  @xcite ] is assumably still in the linear response regime .    in conclusion , by exploiting the local equilibrium and the properties of a steady state",
    "we have calculated the current distribution near a qpc in the out of linear response regime .",
    "we have shown that a asymmetry is induced on the density profile due to the bending of the landau levels generated by the large hall potential .",
    "we estimate that , the system can still be considered in the linear response regime if the 1d current density is smaller than @xmath141 a / m , which certainly depends on the details of the sample geometry .",
    "in this paper , we provided a self - consistent scheme to obtain the electron density , potential profile and current distribution in the close vicinity of a qpc , within the thomas - fermi approximation .",
    "starting from a lithographically defined 3d sample , we calculated the charge distribution at the surface gates , at the plane of 2des and for etched samples at the side surfaces .",
    "the 3d self - consistent solution of the poisson equation enabled us to present the similarities and differences between an etched and gate defined qpc .",
    "we found that , the relatively deep etched samples present a sharp potential profile near the edges of the sample . if the depth of the etching exceeds the depth of the 2des , surface charges are calculated explicitly . in the presence of a quantizing perpendicular magnetic field",
    ", we have calculated the distribution of the incompressible strips as a function of the field strength .",
    "we have argued that , if an incompressible strip becomes narrower than the magnetic length and/or if the transverse electric field is sufficiently large , due to level broadening , the narrow incompressible strip is smeared . in the next step ,",
    "the current distribution is obtained both in the linear response and out of linear response regimes using a local version of the ohm s law assuming a steady state at local equilibrium .",
    "it is shown that the current is confined to the incompressible strips , due to the absence of back scattering , otherwise is distributed all over the sample .",
    "we have commented on the relation between the existence and percolation properties of the incompressible strips and the measured quantities such as the longitudinal resistance and conductance across the qpc .",
    "for the ideal clean sample , i.e. in the absence of long range fluctuations , it is shown that the qh plateau extends wider than that of the conductance plateau . in the out of linear response regime ,",
    "a current induced density asymmetry is presented for the first time in such geometries under quantized hall conditions .",
    "the observable effects of such an asymmetry are not clarified , since it is also know that large currents increase the temperature locally due to joule heating .",
    "a natural extension of the existing model is to include the spin degree of freedom and thereby exchange and correlation effects  @xcite .",
    "a local spin density functional theory approach  @xcite is the much promising one among others such as monte carlo  @xcite and exact diagonalization , from computational and application point of view .",
    "in fact , such an approach already exists , however , the current is handled within the landauer - bttiker formalism , which we think is not reasonable in the presence of large incompressible strips .",
    "on the other hand , a time dependent spin density functional model would be a good candidate to describe current for the geometries under investigation .",
    "the implementation of the akera s theory , i.e. joule heating , to our model is of course desirable which is been worked presently .    finally , in order to have a predictive power on the interference experiments we would like to utilize the existing coherent transport models in describing the current together with our electrostatic model , which we are not able at the present .",
    "another challenge is to simulate the real experimental geometries which already includes more then a single qpc and contacts etc .",
    "the numerical routine we developed is now able to do such large scale calculations within the linear response regime , however , still lacks describing the exchange and correlation effects .      the authors would like to thank r.r .",
    "gerhardts for his initiation , supervision and contribution in developing the model . the enlightening discussions with v. golovach and l. litvin are also highly appreciated .",
