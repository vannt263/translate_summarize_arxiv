    "large - scale quantum computing will require quantum error correction ( qec ) to protect qubits from the effects of noise and undesired measurements .",
    "the basic approach is to encode a qubit in such a way that any errors can be identified and corrected without measuring the value of the qubit itself @xcite .",
    "various qec protocols have recently been demonstrated in nmr @xcite and ion - trap @xcite approaches to quantum computing . in linear optics quantum computing ( loqc ) , the most common error consists of a measurement of the value of a qubit , which can occur during quantum logic operations @xcite .",
    "measurement errors of that kind can be corrected using two - qubit encoding combined with fast feed - forward control @xcite .",
    "several encoding @xcite and feed - forward experiments @xcite have recently been reported . in this paper",
    "we combine these two techniques to demonstrate qec for measurement errors in loqc .    in loqc",
    ", failures in the probabilistic logic gates correspond to situations in which the value of a single - photon qubit is measured in the computations basis ( a z - measurement ) @xcite . the same situation applies to the recent zeno gate approach as well @xcite .",
    "however , these intrinsic measurement errors can be corrected by using the following two - qubit encoding @xcite :    @xmath0    in this code a single - photon qubit with value 0 ( or 1 ) is encoded into a logical qubit represented by the two - photon bell state @xmath1 ( or @xmath2 ) .",
    "the value of the logical qubit corresponds to the parity of the two physical qubits .",
    "the same encoding must also be applied to superposition states .    from equations ( [ eq : twoqubitcode ] ) it can be seen that if a z - measurement occurs on either of the two photons , and the value 0 is found , the state of the remaining photon simply corresponds to that of the initial single - photon qubit . on the other hand , if the z - measurement results in the value 1 , the state of the remaining photon corresponds to the bit - flipped value of the initial qubit . in this latter case ,",
    "a fast feed - forward - controlled bit - flip is used to restore the original qubit value .    a quantum circuit diagram",
    "@xcite illustrating this encoding and feed - forward - control is shown in figure [ fig : overview ] .",
    "a single - photon qubit in an arbitrary state @xmath3 and an ancilla photon in the state @xmath4 are sent into an encoding device which produces the two - photon logical qubit @xmath5 . if an unwanted z - measurement @xmath6 occurs on bit 1 , and the value 1 ( or 0 ) is found , the state of the photon in the lower path is bit - flipped ( or left alone ) to recover the original qubit @xmath3 .",
    "the same procedure is used to recover @xmath3 in the event of a measurement @xmath7 on bit 2 @xcite . in either case ,",
    "the two - photon logical qubit @xmath5 can be recovered by regenerating a new ancilla photon and repeating the encoding process .    in our demonstration of the qec technique of figure [ fig : overview ] ,",
    "the qubit @xmath3 and ancilla state @xmath4 were represented by the polarization states of two single - photons from a parametric down - conversion pair .",
    "the encoding to produce @xmath5 was done probabilistically using linear optics and post - selection , and the feed - forward - controlled bit - flip was accomplished using an electro - optic polarization rotator ( pockels cell ) triggered by the output of single - photon detectors .",
    "the basic idea of the experiment was to intentionally inflict a z - measurement on one of the photons , and then verify the success of the qec procedure by comparing the corrected polarization state of the remaining output photon with the input state @xmath3 .",
    "the subsequent repetition of the encoding operation to regenerate the two - photon logical qubit @xmath5 was not included in this demonstration .",
    "generating the two - qubit code of equation ( [ eq : twoqubitcode ] ) requires a non - trivial entangling operation between the qubit and ancilla photons . in principle",
    ", operations of this kind can be performed near - deterministically in loqc by incorporating large numbers of additional photons and very high - efficiency detectors @xcite .    for laboratory demonstrations ,",
    "however , these requirements can be greatly reduced by working in the so - called `` coincidence basis '' , which utilizes destructive measurements to ensure that photons were actually present in the desired optical paths @xcite . in many cases ,",
    "this simplification can be used to successfully demonstrate the essential features of a two - qubit logic operation while overcoming the effects of random photon sources , loss , and limited detector efficiency associated with current technology .",
    "for example , a coincidence - basis photonic cnot gate @xcite was recently used to demonstrate the encoding ( and decoding ) of equation ( [ eq : twoqubitcode ] ) @xcite .",
    "the encoding box of figure [ fig : overview ] can be further simplified by exploiting the fact that the ancilla photon is always in the fixed state @xmath4 .",
    "this allows one to use linear optics to construct a robust specific - purpose encoding device that does not require the general functionality of a full cnot gate . in our experiment with polarization qubits , this encoding was done using a single polarizing beam splitter ( pbs ) .",
    "the use of a pbs to implement two - qubit logic operations has been done in other contexts as well ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "a pbs is a four - port device that transmits horizontally polarized single photons ( @xmath8 ) and reflects vertically polarized single photons ( @xmath9 ) .",
    "we use the following polarization definitions for the computational basis : @xmath10 ( a photon polarized at @xmath11 ) , and @xmath12 ( a photon polarized at @xmath13 ) .",
    "a qubit photon in an arbitrary state @xmath14 is sent into one of the input ports of of the pbs , while the ancilla photon ( in fixed state @xmath4 ) is sent into the second input port of the pbs .",
    "provided that one photon exits each output port , it can be shown that the two - qubit code of equation ( [ eq : twoqubitcode ] ) is achieved :    @xmath15    for any qubit value @xmath3 , the probability that one photon will exit each output port is @xmath16 .",
    "this can be viewed as the ideal success probability of this probabilistic encoding device . in our experiment ,",
    "coincidence basis measurements were used to monitor only those cases in which that occurred .",
    "an overview of the qec experiment is shown in figure [ fig : experiment ] .",
    "the shaded areas are used to relate several key aspects of the apparatus to the quantum circuit diagram of figure [ fig : overview ] : qubit @xmath3 preparation , the encoding device described in section [ sec : encoding ] , a z - measurement with feed - forward control , and qubit analysis to verify the qec procedure .    a type - i down - conversion source ( pdc ) produced pairs of horizontally polarized photons at 780 nm that were used as the qubit and ancilla ( source details can be found in @xcite ) . a half - wave plate ( hwp2 )",
    "was used to fix the polarization state of the ancilla photon at @xmath11 ( logical @xmath4 ) , while a rotatable half - wave plate ( hwp1 ) could be used to prepare different linear polarization qubit states @xmath3 .",
    "the qubit and ancilla photons were injected into a single - mode fiber - coupled pbs for the encoding . for a general qubit value @xmath3",
    ", the encoding operation can essentially be understood as a two - photon quantum interference effect that uses a beam splitter and post - selection to generate polarization entanglement ( in the coincidence basis ) from an initial product state of two single photons @xcite .",
    "this required the photons to arrive at the pbs within a time defined by their coherence lengths , and alignment of the encoder involved optimizing various polarization - dependent hong - ou - mandel - type quantum interference effects @xcite .",
    "the fidelity of the encoded logical qubit @xmath5 was directly related to the quality of these two - photon interference effects .",
    "this , in turn , impacted the ability to recover the initial single qubit state @xmath3 after a z - measurement on one of these photons .",
    "fibers a and b containing the two - photon logical qubit @xmath5 were connected to fibers d and c which led , respectively , to the z - measurement device and to the feed - forward - controlled bit - flip and output qubit analysis zone . as shown by the dashed arrows in the figure",
    ", these fiber connections could be easily swapped to make the connections a : c and b : d , or a : d and b : c .",
    "this allowed us to make a z - measurement on either of the photons comprising the logical qubit @xmath5 , and then correct the state of the remaining photon to recover @xmath3 .",
    "the z - measurement was accomplished using a second fiber - coupled pbs . a fiber polarization controller ( fpc )",
    "was used to rotate the alignment of the transmission / reflection axes of this pbs into the computational basis . in this way",
    ", a photon with polarization corresponding to the state @xmath17 would be transmitted by the pbs to a single - photon detector @xmath18 , while a photon with polarization corresponding to the state @xmath4 would be reflected by the pbs to a single - photon detector @xmath19 .",
    "all detectors were preceded by 10 nm bandpass interference filters centered at 780 nm .",
    "the feed - forward - controlled bit - flip was implemented using a pockels cell ( pc ) that was triggered only by the output of detector @xmath18 .",
    "additional technical details about this part of the experiment can be found in our earlier work on feed - forward control @xcite .",
    "here the pc was oriented with its fast axis in the horizontal direction , so that the application of a half - wave voltage pulse triggered by @xmath18 would cause a bit - flip in the computational basis .",
    "because this feed - forward control process took roughly 100 ns @xcite , a 30 m fiber delay line was used to delay the output photon before entering the pc .",
    "the polarization state of the corrected ( or uncorrected ) photons exiting the pc were then measured using a rotatable polarization analyzer @xmath20 and detector @xmath21 .",
    "a coincidence logic circuit was used to record only those events in which one photon was detected by the z - measurement detectors , and the second photon was detected by @xmath21 .",
    "this enforced the required coincidence - basis operation of the encoding device by rejecting those cases in which both photons of a pdc pair exited the same port of the encoding pbs .",
    "in practice , the demonstration of quantum error correction consisted of using hwp1 to specify a qubit value @xmath3 , and then monitoring the coincidence counting rate between detectors @xmath21 and @xmath19 , or @xmath21 and @xmath18 , as a function of the analyzer angle @xmath20 .",
    "the results obtained for several different examples of @xmath3 are shown in figure [ fig : data ] .",
    "for the data shown in figure [ fig : data](a ) , the hwp1 was used to prepare the qubit in the state @xmath4 ( a photon polarized at @xmath11 ) , and the fiber connections a : c and b : d were used .",
    "the solid - circle data points show the number of @xmath22 coincidence counts as a function of @xmath20 .",
    "this corresponds to a z - measurement returning the value 0 . in accordance with equation ( [ eq : twoqubitcode ] ) ,",
    "no correction is needed , and the output qubit is expected to be in the same state as the input @xmath3 .",
    "the results agree with this prediction ; a malus law dependence on @xmath20 consistent with a linear polarization state of @xmath11 is clearly seen .",
    "the solid line is a sinusoidal fit to the data points , with a visibility of ( 92.2 @xmath23 0.3)% .",
    "the data points obtained with the polarizer @xmath20 set to @xmath24 ( corresponding to the qubits @xmath4 and @xmath17 ) can be used to estimate a recovery of @xmath25 from the z - measurement error with a fidelity of @xmath26 .",
    "the solid - square data points in figure [ fig : data](a ) show the number of @xmath27 coincidence counts as a function of @xmath20 .",
    "this corresponds to a z - measurement resulting in the value 1 , which requires a feed - forward controlled bit - flip on the output qubit to recover @xmath25 . here ,",
    "however , the pc was intentionally disconnected so that no bit - flip was applied . as expected , the data is indicative of an output qubit @xmath17 . in this example",
    ", the dashed line fit to the data had a visibility of ( 92.5 @xmath23 0.3)% .",
    "the solid - triangle data in figure [ fig : data](a ) correspond to the same situation , but with the pc connected and the bit - flip applied . in this case",
    "the data clearly shows the recovered qubit @xmath25 .",
    "the dotted - line fit to this data has a visibility of ( 92.1 @xmath23 0.3)% , indicating the ability to successfully apply the feed - forward - controlled bit - flip using the pc .    from an experimental point of view ,",
    "a comparison of the results in figures [ fig : data](a ) and [ fig : data](b ) highlights the non - classical nature of the encoding operation .",
    "the conditions were exactly the same for these two data sets , except that for ( b ) the qubit photon was delayed relative to the ancilla photon by roughly twice its coherence length before entering the encoding pbs .",
    "this temporal information rendered the two photons distinguishable , which destroyed the quantum interference effects necessary for successful encoding @xcite .",
    "the resulting flat lines in figure [ fig : data](b ) are what would be expected from `` classical '' statistics in this case : roughly half of the photons emerging in fiber a were horizontally polarized , and the other half were vertically polarized .    the data shown in figure [ fig : data](c ) corresponds to the conditions of figure [ fig : data](a ) , except that the outputs of the encoding device were swapped by making the fiber connections a : d and b : c .",
    "the three sets of data are nearly identical to those in figure [ fig : data](a ) , which demonstrates the ability of the two - qubit code ( [ eq : twoqubitcode ] ) to recover from a z - measurement on either of the two photons comprising the logical qubit @xmath5 .    for the data shown in figures [ fig : data](d ) and [ fig : data](e )",
    "the hwp1 was used to prepare input qubits @xmath3 in the states @xmath17 and @xmath28 ) . in both cases ,",
    "the malus law dependence on @xmath20 agrees with the expected output states .",
    "similar results were also obtained with the output fibers swapped .",
    "the average visibility of the three fits in figure [ fig : data](d ) was 93.6% , while it was 98.2% for figure [ fig : data](e ) .",
    "the higher visibility in the latter case is due to the fact that the encoding operation does not depend on two - photon interference effects for the superposition state @xmath29 , which simply corresponds to a horizontally polarized photon .",
    "the slight deviation from 100% visibility in this case can therefore be used to estimate the magnitude of the remaining technical errors in the experiment .    the average visibility of the nonclassical two - photon interference patterns corresponding to the corrected qubits in figures [ fig : data](a),(c),(d ) , and ( e ) was 93.6% ; in contrast , the visibilities in figure [ fig : data](b ) ( with no quantum interference ) were essentially zero .",
    "these examples clearly show the ability to recover the qubit @xmath3 from a z - measurement error .",
    "the results of figure [ fig : data ] demonstrate the ability to combine two - qubit encoding and feed - forward control to recover from the z - measurement errors intrinsic in probabilistic loqc logic gates .    within the coincidence basis",
    ", the two - qubit encoding of equation ( [ eq : twoqubitcode ] ) can be accomplished using a photonic cnot gate , as was first demonstrated in reference @xcite , or by using a specific purpose encoding device such as the one constructed here .",
    "the required feed - forward control was implemented here using real - time polarization rotations via the techniques of reference @xcite .",
    "all of these preliminary studies have shown that intrinsic error correction is feasible in an loqc approach .",
    "however , it should be noted that the two - qubit code and feed - forward used here can not correct for more general physical errors such as bit - flips , phase - shifts , and loss . in order to overcome errors of that kind ,",
    "the procedure demonstrated here would need to be embedded in a more general qec code @xcite .",
    "the realization of these more complex codes , as well as operation outside the coincidence basis , will place significant demands on the photon sources and detectors ."
