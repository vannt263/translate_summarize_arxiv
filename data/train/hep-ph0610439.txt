    "the seesaw mechanism is implemented by the inclusion of a majorana mass @xmath6 for the right handed neutrinos ( allowed due to their singlet character under all the symmetries of the standard model ( sm ) ) and by considering a large separation between this mass and the electroweak ( ew ) scale  @xcite .",
    "after ew symmetry breaking , the full @xmath7 neutrino mass matrix is given in terms of the @xmath8 dirac mass matrix , @xmath9 , and the @xmath8 majorana mass matrix @xmath6 . here",
    "@xmath10 is the @xmath8 neutrino yukawa coupling and @xmath11 with @xmath12 gev .",
    "the ratio of the two higgs doublets vacuum expectations values is @xmath13 .",
    "the assumption of @xmath14 leads to the usual seesaw equation , @xmath15 , which guaranties the smallness of the light neutrino masses .",
    "after the diagonalisation of the full @xmath7 neutrino mass matrix one obtains six physical majorana neutrinos : three light @xmath16 , with masses @xmath17 , and three heavy @xmath18 , with masses @xmath19 .",
    "notice that we work in a lepton basis where both the right handed mass matrix and the charged lepton mass matrix are diagonal in flavour space .",
    "the flavour mixing in the light neutrino sector is given by the maki - nakagawa - sakata matrix @xmath20  @xcite for which we use the standard parameterization , which is written in terms of three mixing angles @xmath21 , @xmath5 and @xmath22 and three cp violating phases @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "we use here the parameterisation proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the solution to the seesaw equation is written as @xmath26 , with @xmath27 being a @xmath28 orthogonal complex matrix , defined by three complex angles @xmath29 ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "the attractiveness of this parameterisation is that it allows to easily implement the requirement of compatibility with low energy neutrino data .",
    "it also clearly shows that in the singlet seesaw scenario one can have large neutrino yukawa couplings , @xmath30 , by simply choosing large entries in @xmath31 .",
    "the main implication of these large yukawa coupling is that they can induce large lepton flavour violating ( lfv ) rates  @xcite .",
    "the total number of parameters of the neutrino sector in this scenario is 18 , which in this particular parameterisation are summarised by @xmath32 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath29 . by adjusting the light neutrino parameters to the low energy neutrino data , one",
    "is left with 9 input parameters given by @xmath34 and @xmath29 .    regarding the numerical estimates we consider two scenarios .",
    "the first one with quasi - degenerate light neutrinos , with masses @xmath35 ev , @xmath36 and @xmath37 , and degenerate heavy neutrinos with mass @xmath38 .",
    "the second one is with hierarchical light and heavy neutrinos , with masses @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "here we use @xmath41 ev , @xmath42 ev , @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 , and for simplicity we fix @xmath46 .",
    "in addition to the previous seesaw parameters , there are the susy sector parameters which , within the assumed constrained minimal supersymmetric standard model ( cmssm ) framework , are given by @xmath47 and @xmath48 . the universality of the soft - susy breaking terms is imposed at a high scale @xmath49 which we fix here to the @xmath50-@xmath51 gauge couplings unification scale @xmath52 gev . in particular ,",
    "in the numerical analysis we consider specific choices of these parameters , given by the msugra - like `` snowmass points and slopes '' ( sps ) @xcite listed in table  [ sps : def:15 ] , which represent different examples of possible susy spectra .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     there are several important conclusions to be drawn from fig .",
    "[ fig : modt2:argt2:1214 ] .",
    "let us first discuss the case @xmath53  ev .",
    "we note that one can obtain a baryon asymmetry in the range @xmath54 to @xmath55 for a considerable region of the analysed @xmath56 range .",
    "notice also that there is a clear separation between the predictions of @xmath57 and @xmath58 , with the latter well above the present experimental bound .",
    "this would imply an experimental impact of @xmath5 , in the sense that the br predictions become potentially detectable for this non - vanishing @xmath5 value . with the planned meg sensitivity  @xcite",
    ", both cases would be within experimental reach . however , this statement is strongly dependent on the assumed parameters , in particular @xmath59 .",
    "for instance , a larger value of @xmath60  ev , illustrated on the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : modt2:argt2:1214 ] , leads to a very distinct situation regarding the sensitivity to @xmath5 .",
    "while for smaller values of @xmath56 the branching ratio displays a clear sensitivity to having @xmath5 equal or different from zero ( a separation larger than two orders of magnitude for @xmath61 ) , the effect of @xmath5 is diluted for increasing values of @xmath56 .",
    "let us now address the question of whether a joint measurement of the brs and @xmath5 can shed some light on experimentally unreachable parameters , like @xmath62 .",
    "the expected improvement in the experimental sensitivity to the lfv ratios supports the possibility that a br could be measured in the future , thus providing the first experimental evidence for new physics , even before its discovery at the lhc .",
    "the prospects are especially encouraging regarding @xmath63 , where the experimental sensitivity will improve by at least two orders of magnitude . moreover , and given the impressive effort on experimental neutrino physics , a measurement of @xmath5 will likely also occur in the future  @xcite . given that , as previously emphasised , @xmath64 is very sensitive to @xmath5 , whereas this is not the case for br(@xmath65 ) , and that both brs display the same approximate behaviour with @xmath62 and @xmath66 , we now propose to study the correlation between these two observables .",
    "this optimises the impact of a @xmath5 measurement , since it allows to minimise the uncertainty introduced from not knowing @xmath66 and @xmath62 , and at the same time offers a better illustration of the uncertainty associated with the @xmath27-matrix angles . in this case",
    ", the correlation of the brs with respect to @xmath62 means that , for a fixed set of parameters , varying @xmath62 implies that the predicted point ( br(@xmath65 ) ,  br(@xmath67 ) ) moves along a line with approximately constant slope in the br(@xmath65)-br(@xmath67 ) plane . on the other hand ,",
    "varying @xmath5 leads to a displacement of the point along the vertical axis .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : doublebr ] , we illustrate this correlation for sps 1a , choosing distinct values of the heaviest neutrino mass , and we scan over the bau - enabling @xmath27-matrix angles ( setting @xmath68 to zero ) as @xmath69 we consider the following values , @xmath70 , @xmath71 , @xmath72 and @xmath73 , and only include in the plot the br predictions which allow for a favourable bau .",
    "other sps points have also been considered but they are not shown here for brevity ( see  @xcite ) .",
    "we clearly observe in fig .",
    "[ fig : doublebr ] that for a fixed value of @xmath62 , and for a given value of @xmath5 , the dispersion arising from a @xmath74 and @xmath75 variation produces a small area rather than a point in the br(@xmath76)-br(@xmath67 ) plane .    the dispersion along the br(@xmath65 ) axis is of approximately one order of magnitude for all @xmath5 .",
    "in contrast , the dispersion along the br(@xmath64 ) axis increases with decreasing @xmath5 , ranging from an order of magnitude for @xmath77 , to over three orders of magnitude for the case of small @xmath5 ( @xmath78 ) . from fig .",
    "[ fig : doublebr ] we can also infer that other choices of @xmath62 ( for @xmath79 $ ] ) would lead to br predictions which would roughly lie within the diagonal lines depicted in the plot . comparing these predictions for the shaded areas along the expected diagonal `` corridor '' , with the allowed experimental region ,",
    "allows to conclude about the impact of a @xmath5 measurement on the allowed / excluded @xmath62 values .",
    "the most important conclusion from fig .",
    "[ fig : doublebr ] is that for sps  1a , and for the parameter space defined in eq .",
    "( [ doublebr : input ] ) , an hypothetical @xmath5 measurement larger than @xmath78 , together with the present experimental bound on the br(@xmath64 ) , will have the impact of excluding values of @xmath80 gev .",
    "moreover , with the planned meg sensitivity , the same @xmath5 measurement can further constrain @xmath81  gev .",
    "the impact of any other @xmath5 measurement can be analogously extracted from fig .",
    "[ fig : doublebr ] .    as a final comment",
    "let us add that , remarkably , within a particular susy scenario and scanning over specific @xmath74 and @xmath75 bau - enabling ranges for various values of @xmath5 , the comparison of the theoretical predictions for br(@xmath64 ) and br(@xmath65 ) with the present experimental bounds allows to set @xmath5-dependent upper bounds on @xmath62 .",
    "together with the indirect lower bound arising from leptogenesis considerations , this clearly provides interesting hints on the value of the seesaw parameter @xmath62 . with the planned future sensitivities",
    ", these bounds would further improve by approximately one order of magnitude .",
    "ultimately , a joint measurement of the lfv branching ratios , @xmath5 and the sparticle spectrum would be a powerful tool for shedding some light on otherwise unreachable susy seesaw parameters .",
    "it is clear from this study that the connection between lfv and neutrino physics will play a relevant role for the searches of new physics .",
