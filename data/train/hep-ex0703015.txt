    "neutrino mass - induced oscillations are the best explanation of the atmospheric neutrino problem @xcite .",
    "two flavor @xmath5 oscillations are strongly favored over a wide range of alternative solutions @xcite .",
    "these alternative mechanisms have been considered under the hypothesis that each one of them solely accounts for the observed effects .",
    "we address the possibility of a mixed scenario : one mechanism , the mass - induced flavor oscillations , is considered dominant and a second mechanism is included in competition with the former .",
    "we studied , as sub - dominant mechanism , neutrino flavor transitions induced by violations of relativity principles , i.e. violation of the lorentz invariance ( vli ) or of the equivalence principle ( vep ) .    in this mixed scenario",
    ", we assume that neutrinos can be described in terms of three distinct bases : flavor eigenstates , mass eigenstates and velocity eigenstates , the latter being characterized by different maximum attainable velocities ( mavs ) , and consider that only two families contribute to the atmospheric neutrino oscillations .",
    "when both mass - induced and vli - induced neutrino oscillations are considered simultaneously , the @xmath6 survival probability can be expressed as  @xcite @xmath7 where @xmath8 and @xmath9 are given by : @xmath10 the terms @xmath11 and @xmath12 contain the relevant physical information and the whole domain of variability of the parameters can be accessed with the requirements @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "the functional form of the oscillation probabilities for mass induced ( vli induced ) oscillations exhibits an @xmath17 ( @xmath18 ) dependence on the neutrino energies and pathlengths respectively .",
    "the same formalism also applies to violation of the equivalence principle , after substituting @xmath19 with the adimensional product @xmath20 ; @xmath21 is the difference of the coupling constants for neutrinos of different types to the gravitational potential @xmath22  @xcite .",
    "as shown in  @xcite , the most sensitive tests of vli can be made by analysing the high energy tail of atmospheric neutrinos at large pathlength values .",
    "as an example , fig .",
    "[ fig : ftest ] shows the energy dependence of the @xmath23 survival probability as a function of the neutrino energy , for neutrino mass - induced oscillations alone and for both mass and vli - induced oscillations for @xmath24 and sin@xmath25 2@xmath26 = @xmath41 .",
    "notice that for @xmath27 ev , neutrinos with energies larger than 100 gev are extremely relativistic , with lorentz @xmath28 factors larger than @xmath29 .",
    "survival probability for mass - induced oscillations alone ( continuous line ) and mass - induced + vli oscillations for @xmath30 and sin @xmath31 = @xmath41 , dashed lines for positive values , dotted lines for negative values .",
    "the neutrino pathlength was fixed at @xmath32 = 10000 km.,width=264 ]",
    "in order to analyse the macro data in terms of vli , we used a subsample of 300 upward - throughgoing muons whose energies were estimated via multiple coulomb scattering in the 7 horizontal rock absorbers in the lower apparatus  @xcite .",
    "the energy estimate was obtained using the streamer tubes in drift mode , which allowed to considerably improve the spatial resolution of the detector ( @xmath333 mm ) .",
    "the overall neutrino energy resolution was of the order of 100% , mainly dominated by muon energy losses in the rock below the detector ( note that @xmath34 ) .",
    "upgoing muon neutrinos from this sample are particularly suited for sensitive tests of vli and vep , since they have large energies ( @xmath35 50 gev ) and large zenith angles ( @xmath36 ) , which correspond to a median value of neutrino pathlengths of about 10000 km . following the analysis in ref .",
    "@xcite , we selected a low and a high energy sample by requiring that the reconstructed neutrino energy @xmath37 should be @xmath38 30 gev and @xmath39 130 gev .",
    "the number of events surviving these cuts is @xmath40 = 49 and @xmath41 = 58 , respectively ; their median energies , estimated via monte carlo , are 13 gev and 204 gev ( assuming mass - induced oscillations ) .",
    "the analysis then proceeds by fixing the neutrino mass oscillation parameters at the values of @xcite .",
    "then , we scanned the plane of the two free parameters ( @xmath42 , @xmath26 ) minimizing the @xmath43 function comprehensive of statistical and systematic uncertainties  @xcite .",
    "for the monte carlo simulation described in  @xcite the neutrino fluxes in input is given by @xcite .",
    "the largest relative difference of the extreme values of the mc expected ratio @xmath44 is 13% .",
    "however , in the evaluation of the systematic error , the main sources of uncertainties for this ratio ( namely the primary cosmic ray spectral index and neutrino cross sections ) have been separately estimated and their effects added in quadrature ( see  @xcite for details ) : in this work , we use a conservative 16% theoretical systematic error on the ratio @xmath44 .",
    "the experimental systematic error on the ratio was estimated to be 6% .",
    "the inclusion of the vli effect does not improve the @xmath45 in any point of the ( @xmath42 , @xmath26 ) plane , compared to mass - induced oscillations stand - alone , and proper upper limits on vli parameters were obtained .",
    "the 90% c.l .",
    "limits on @xmath42 and @xmath26 , computed with the feldman and cousins prescription  @xcite , are shown by the dashed line in fig .",
    "[ fig : super].the energy cuts described above ( the same used in ref .",
    "@xcite ) , were optimized for mass - induced neutrino oscillations . in order to maximize the sensitivity of the analysis for vli induced oscillations",
    ", we performed a blind analysis , based only on monte carlo events , to determine the energy cuts which yield the best performances .",
    "the results of this study suggest the cuts @xmath38 28 gev and @xmath39 142 gev ; with these cuts the number of events in the real data are @xmath46 = 44 events and @xmath47 = 35 events .",
    "the limits obtained with this selection are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : super ] by the continuous line .",
    "as expected , the limits are now more stringent than for the previous choice .",
    "an independent and complementary analysis was performed on a sample of events with a reconstructed neutrino energy 25 gev @xmath48 75 gev .",
    "the number of events satisfying this condition is 106 .",
    "a negative log - likelihood function was built event by event and then fitted to the data .",
    "we allowed mass - induced oscillation parameters to vary inside the macro 90% c.l .",
    "region and we left vli parameters free in the whole ( @xmath42 , @xmath26 ) plane . the upper limit on",
    "the @xmath42 parameter resulting from this analysis is slowly varying with @xmath49 and is of the order of @xmath50 .",
    "we have searched for `` exotic '' contributions to standard mass - induced atmospheric neutrino oscillations arising from a possible violation of lorentz invariance .",
    "two different and complementary analyses were performed on the data , both of them yielding compatible upper limits for the vli contribution .",
    "we used a subsample of macro muon events for which an energy measurement was made via multiple coulomb scattering .",
    "the inclusion of vli effects does not improve the fit to the data , and we conclude that these effects are disfavored even at the sub - dominant level  @xcite . the vli parameter bound is ( at 90% c.l . ) @xmath51 .",
    "this result may be reinterpreted in terms of 90% c.l .",
    "limits of parameters connected with violation of the equivalence principle , giving the limit @xmath52 .",
    "the second approach exploits the information contained in a data sub - set characterized by intermediate muon energies .",
    "it is based on the maximum likelihood technique , and considers the mass neutrino oscillation parameters inside the 90% border of the global result  @xcite .",
    "the obtained 90% cl upper limit on the @xmath42 vli parameter versus the assumed @xmath49 values is also around @xmath53 .",
