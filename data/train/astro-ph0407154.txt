    "there is strong support  from the composition of cometary and meteoritic materials  for the notion that the solar nebula , from which the planets formed , passed through a phase of warm , dense gas with a rich chemistry .",
    "while much observational effort has been dedicated to the study of such hot cores around massive protostars , hot cores around low mass protostars have received little attention .",
    "only very recently has the first hot core around a solar - type protostar been discovered towards the typical class 0 source , iras162932422 ( hereafter iras16293 ) , exhibiting all characteristics of such regions : warm temperatures ( @xmath1 k ) and high densities ( @xmath2 @xmath3 : ceccarelli et al .",
    "2000a ) , high abundances of hydrides ( ch@xmath0oh , h@xmath4co , h@xmath4o : ceccarelli et al .",
    "2000a , b ; schier et al . 2002 ) , high deuteration levels ( @xmath5% : ceccarelli et al . 1998 , 2001 ;",
    "parise et al .",
    "2002 ; roberts et al .",
    "2002 ) , and complex molecules ( hcooch@xmath0 , hcooh , ch@xmath0och@xmath0 , ch@xmath0cn , c@xmath4h@xmath6cn : cazaux et al . 2003 ) .",
    "the definition of `` hot core '' used for massive protostars implies the presence of a relatively large amount of warm and dense gas , along with a complex chemistry triggered by the grain mantle evaporation ( e.g. walmsley et al .",
    "1992 ) . in order to make clear that hot cores of low and high mass protostars are , however , substantially different in the involved amount of material",
    ", we will use hereinafter the term `` * hot corino * '' to identify the warm inner regions of the envelope surrounding the low mass protostars .    the chemical composition of the ( massive ) hot cores",
    "is thought to reflect a variety of sequential processes ( wamsley et al .",
    "1992 ; charnley et al . 1992",
    "; caselli et al . 1993 ; charnley 1995 ; rodgers & charnley 2001 , 2003 ) .",
    "specifically , in the pre - collapse cold cloud phase , simple molecules form on grain surfaces by hydrogenation of co and other heavy elements ( notably examples are h@xmath4co , ch@xmath0oh and h@xmath4s ) . upon heating by a newly formed star ,",
    "these molecules , called `` first generation '' or `` parent '' molecules , evaporate into the gas and undergo fast neutral - neutral and ion - neutral reactions producing complex organic molecules , i.e. `` second generation '' or `` daughter '' molecules .",
    "the first part of this sequence , i.e. the formation of fully hydrogenated molecules on the grain surfaces , has been demonstrated to occur in low mass protostars too , for example by studies of multiply deuterated molecules : formaldehyde ( ceccarelli et al . 1998 , bacmann et al . 2003 ) , methanol ( parise et al . 2002 , 2004 ) and sulfide ( vastel et al . 2003 ) .",
    "evaporation from grain mantles of these first generation species ( in particular h@xmath4co and ch@xmath0oh ) has been observed in iras16293 ( ceccarelli et al .",
    "2000b , schier et al . 2002 ) and in about a dozen low mass protostars ( maret et al . 2004 ) .",
    "however , since the timescale necessary to convert first generation molecules into complex , second generation molecules ( around @xmath7 yr ; e.g. charnley et al .",
    "1992 , 2001 ) is much longer than the transit time of the gas in the hot corinos ( few 100 yr ; e.g. schier et al .",
    "2002 ) , the formation in the gas of second generation molecules seems improbable ( e.g. schier et al . 2002 ) .",
    "the detection of a high abundance of complex molecules in the hot core of iras16293 ( cazaux et al .",
    "2003 ) has evidently been a challenge to the simple theoretical sequence described above .",
    "the key question has shifted from `` is a hot core present in low mass protostars ? '' to `` what is the origin of molecular complexity in these sources ? '' in particular , there may well be chemical pathways to complex molecules involving grain surface networks ( e.g. charnley 1995 ) . in order to answer this question ,",
    "more observations in other low mass protostars are necessary .",
    "this will allow the development of a solid observational framework within which we might search for clues to the formation of second generation molecules .",
    "as remarked in previous studies , the question is far from being academic , since the molecules in the hot corinos constitute the material which will eventually form the proto - planetary disk and , possibly , the planets of the forming sun - like star .    in this letter",
    "we present the first results of a survey we are carrying out on the sample of class 0 sources studied by maret et al .",
    "( 2004 ) . here",
    "we report the detection of complex , second generation molecules in ngc1333-iras4a ( hereafter iras4a ) , a well known class 0 protostar , and a target of several studies of molecular emission ( e.g. blake et al .",
    "iras4a is part of the binary system iras 4 , located in the ngc1333 reflection nebula , in the perseus cloud .",
    "it is separated by @xmath8 from the other component , iras 4b , and was itself resolved into two components with a separation of @xmath9 , by lay et al .",
    "the distance to the ngc1333 cloud is uncertain ( see e.g. maret et al .",
    "2002 ) , but assuming a value of 220  pc ( derived by cernis 1990 , for consistency with previous work ) , iras4a has a luminosity of @xmath10 and an envelope mass of @xmath11 ( sandell et al .",
    "iras4a is associated with a very highly collimated outflow , detected in co , cs , and sio ( blake et al .",

    "the observations were carried out in june 2003 with the iram 30-meter telescope . the position used for pointing was @xmath16(2000 ) = @xmath17 and @xmath18(2000 ) = @xmath19 .",
    "based on the observations of iras16293 by cazaux et al .",

    "detected transitions have been identified using the jpl molecular line catalog ( pickett et al .",
    "1998 ) and are reported in table  [ detections ] .",
    "we considered as good identifications only lines with a 3-@xmath24 detection and a @xmath25=6.8@xmath260.3 .",
    "we detected three of the five targeted molecules : 10 transitions for hcooch@xmath0 ( a and e ) , 2 for hcooh and 9 for ch@xmath0cn .",
    "we also have a possible detection for c@xmath4h@xmath6oh at 90.118 ghz ; unfortunately , no other transition with a low enough energy and high enough einstein coefficient was contained within the frequency ranges we observed to confirm the correct identification .",
    "no transitions of ch@xmath0och@xmath0 and c@xmath4h@xmath6cn were detected to a noise limit of 6 and 2 mk respectively .",
    "all detected lines have linewidths @xmath27 , with few exceptions , likely due to the presence of unresolved triplets or to the contamination of unidentified lines . in order to derive the rotational temperature and column density , we built rotational diagrams ( fig .",
    "[ rotdia ] ) in which the observed fluxes were corrected for beam dilution , assuming a source size of 0@xmath285 ( derived from a hot core radius of 53  au and a distance of 220  pc , as found by maret et al .",
    "the assumption that the complex molecules are confined to the hot corino is supported by a plateau de bure interferometric study of iras16293 which shows localized emission in a region @xmath29 around the protostar ( bottinelli et al . in preparation ) .",
    "the rotational temperatures , total column densities and abundances for the dectected molecules are presented in table  [ t+n ] .",
    "note that the large errors in the hcooh ( this work ) and ch@xmath0och@xmath0 ( cazaux et al .",
    "2003 ) abundances are due to a poor constraint of the rotational temperature , and hence column density , of these two molecules , even though each molecule is clearly detected in each case .",
    "the most important result of the present work is the detection of complex molecules in the hot corino of iras4a , the second class 0 in which those molecules have been searched for , after iras16293 ( cazaux et al . 2003 ) .",
    "this result demonstrates that as soon as a warm region is created in the center of the envelope of low mass protostars , complex molecules are readily formed and/or injected on timescales lower than the estimated class 0 source ages ( @xmath30  yr in iras16293 and @xmath31  yr in iras4a ; e.g. maret et al . 2002 ) , and , most importantly , shorter than the transit time in the hot corinos .",
    "the latter is @xmath32  yr and @xmath33  yr in iras16293 and iras4a respectively , based on the hot corino sizes quoted in maret et al .",
    "( 2004 ) and assuming free - falling gas .",
    "we compare the measured composition of the hot corino of iras4a to iras16293 ( cazaux et al .",
    "2003 ) and the massive hot core of omc-1 ( sutton et al . 1995 ) in table  [ t+n ] .",
    "note that the latter abundances are derived from single dish measurements with a @xmath34 beam , which encompasses several hot cores ( wright et al .",
    "1996 ) . unfortunately ,",
    "not all the molecules considered here have interferometric measurements available , so that we can only use these @xmath34 beam - averaged estimates of the abundances .",
    "the first remark is that the absolute abundances of the observed molecules are one order of magnitude smaller in iras4a than in iras16293 , but their relative abundances with respect to h@xmath4co are quite similar , with the exception of methanol , which is underabundant with respect to h@xmath4co by about a factor 10 in iras4a ( fig .",
    "[ xratio ] ) .",
    "there are two reasons to consider abundances with respect to formaldehyde .",
    "the first one is observational : while the iras16293 hot core has now been imaged with the plateau de bure interferometer ( bottinelli et al . in preparation ) and its size confirmed to be @xmath29 , the iras4a core size is only indirectly estimated from dust continuum single dish ( @xmath35 ) observations to be @xmath36 and no interferometric observations are available yet with such a high resolution .",
    "so the iras4a core size might be wrong by up to a factor three ( maret et al .",
    "2004 ) and the abundances by up to a factor ten , i.e. the absolute abundances of iras4a could be comparable to those of iras16293 . using abundance ratios",
    "allow us to remove this size uncertainty .",
    "the second reason is theoretical : `` standard '' hot core models predict that molecules like methyl formate or methyl cyanide are second generation molecules formed in the warm gas from the evaporated grain mantle constituents ( formaldehyde , ammonia and methanol : e.g. charnley et al .",
    "1992 ; caselli et al . 1993 ; rodgers & charnley 2003 ) .",
    "it is therefore interesting to compare the abundances of the complex molecules to those of one of these supposed parent molecules .",
    "formaldehyde was chosen because we only have an upper limit on the methanol abundance ( maret et al . in preparation ) and no measurements of the ammonia abundance are available .",
    "a possible interpretation for the similarity in the complex molecules relative abundances , with respect to h@xmath4co and not with respect to ch@xmath0oh , is that the former is the mother molecule of the observed o - bearing species , e.g. likely the case of hcooch@xmath0 ( charnley et al .",
    "1992 ) , and that the chemical evolution timescale is shorter than the age of the youngest source .",
    "charnley et al .",
    "( 1992 ) also predict that methanol is the mother molecule of ch@xmath0och@xmath0 , but we can not say whether the available data confirm this hypothesis since we only have an upper limit on the abundance of this molecule in iras4a and a large error in iras16293 . similarly , the n - bearing molecules ch@xmath0cn and c@xmath4h@xmath6cn could both be daughters of the same mother molecule , probably ammonia . this would imply that the two sources have a similar ammonia mantle abundance .",
    "alternatively , ( some of ? ) the reported molecules are possible mantle constituents themselves",
    ". this may be the case for formic acid , as predicted by tielens & hagen ( 1982 ) , and suggested by the observational study by liu et al .",
    "moreover , the analysis of iso absorption spectra towards the massive hot core w33a ( e.g. schutte et al . 1997 ) is consistent with the presence of solid formic acid and would also support the idea of this species being a mantle constituent .",
    "however , these considerations do not take into account the evolutionary state of the objects and the fundamental question is : does the abundance of any of these complex molecules have anything to do with the age and/or evolutionary stage of the protostar , or is it dominated by the initial mantle composition ?",
    "evidently , two sources are not enough to answer this question , and observations of more low mass sources are required .    regarding the comparison with the massive hot core(s ) in orion , fig .",
    "[ xratio ] would suggest that , with respect to formaldehyde , there is a deficiency of methanol and of n - bearing complex molecules in the low mass hot corinos .",
    "it is possible that these differences are mostly due to a different grain mantle composition , i.e. to a different pre - collapse density . however , recall that the abundance ratios of ch@xmath0cn and ch@xmath0oh in figure [ xratio ] refer to the @xmath34 beam - averaged values around the omc-1 hot core , which in fact includes several smaller cores ( wright et al . 1996 ) .",
    "therefore , in order to make precise comparisons , higher resolution observations of the omc-1 hot core are needed .",
    "it is also worth noting that if we consider for example the measurements by wright et al .",
    "1996 in the compact ridge component ( a region about @xmath37 away from the hot core central position , which is also a site of mantle evaporation and of active gas phase chemistry ; e.g. charnley et al .",
    "1992 ) , the ch@xmath0cn and ch@xmath0oh abundance ratios with respect to h@xmath4co are ( surprisingly ) close to those found for the hot corinos of iras16293 and iras4a . hence , interferometric observations of a larger number of massive hot cores are necessary to provide a significant comparison of the hot corinos with their high mass counterparts .    in summary , although the present observations do not allow us to answer the questions why and how complex molecules are formed , they do show that hot corinos , in the wide definition of chemically enriched regions , are a common property of solar - type protostars in the early stages .",
    "the evidence is that the types of complex molecules that are formed are determined primarily by the composition of the grain mantles . at this stage , it is not clear whether the evolutionary stage of the protostar plays any role at all , other than governing the presence and size of the mantle evaporation region .",
