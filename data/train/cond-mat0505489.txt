    "lately , there has been renewed interest in the subject of the kondo lattice and its relation to the single - impurity kondo model .",

    "et al.__@xcite have proposed a two - fluid model that thermodynamic and transport properties of ce@xmath6la@xmath7coin@xmath8 by the superposition of a single - impurity part and a coherent heavy - fermion liquid part .",
    "it has been shown for the concentrated ce alloys ( @xmath9 ) that only 10% of the low - temperature specific heat corresponds to the single - impurity part , and that this part can be described by the same kondo temperature @xmath10 for all concentrations @xmath11 .",
    "this remarkable result , which suggests that the specific heat is essentially a coherent lattice property , requires reexamination of previous investigations concluding that single - impurity physics accounts rather well for the thermodynamic properties of a number of heavy fermions . of particular note is the alloy series ce@xmath6la@xmath7pb@xmath2 , for which the zero - field specific heat scales with ce concentration for @xmath12 , and the specific heat per ce is accounted for quantitatively by the @xmath3 single - impurity kondo model.@xcite the absence of coherence effects in ce@xmath6la@xmath7pb@xmath2 is surprising given that the pure compound cepb@xmath2 orders antiferromagnetically at @xmath13k , pointing to the presence of significant inter - ion correlations .    in order to provide a more rigorous test of the single - impurity picture in ce@xmath6la@xmath7pb@xmath2 ,",
    "we have measured the specific heat of polycrystalline ce@xmath0la@xmath1pb@xmath2 in magnetic fields ranging from 0 to 14 t .",
    "the @xmath14 concentration was chosen to satisfy two criteria : the system should be sufficiently concentrated and it should not order magnetically at any temperature .",
    "after subtraction of a lattice contribution , we find that the specific heat between 1k and 10 k is well described by the @xmath3 single - impurity kondo model with just one adjustable parameter : the zero - field kondo temperature , @xmath15k .",
    "in particular , the variation in the temperature and the height of the peak in @xmath4 vs @xmath5 is captured with good accuracy .",
    "this fit is non - trivial , given that the impurity has a field - dependent @xmath16 factor arising from field - induced mixing of ce crystalline electric field levels .",
    "two polycrystalline samples of ce@xmath0la@xmath1pb@xmath2 were synthesized independently in an arc melter , using highest available grade elements ( ce and la from ames national laboratory , pb 6n from aesar johnson matthey ) . because of the high vapor pressure of pb , the starting material had additional pb to compensate for vapor losses . the starting composition for sample 1 had 3% more pb than indicated by stoichiometry , while that for sample 2 had an additional 2% .",
    "each sample was repeatedly remelted to improve the homogeneity . after each remelting ,",
    "the sample mass was compared to that expected for the stoichiometric material under the assumption that there were no vapor losses of ce and la at the low arc current used .",
    "the process was repeated until the final stoichiometry ( assuming no loss of ce and la ) was ce@xmath0la@xmath1pb@xmath17 .",
    "each sample was then annealed for two weeks at 600@xmath18c in the presence of additional free lead to minimize further pb losses from the sample .",
    "( no such losses were detected . )",
    "excess specific heat @xmath19 vs temperature @xmath5 for sample 1 ( open symbols ) and sample 2 ( filled symbols ) at magnetic fields @xmath20 ( circles ) and @xmath21 t ( triangles ) .",

    "the specific heat @xmath4 of sample 1 was measured by the thermal relaxation method over temperatures @xmath5 between 0.4k and 10k in magnetic fields @xmath20 , 5 , 8 , 10 , and 14 t .",
    "sample 2 was measured between 0.7k and 4.2k at zero field and 10 t to provide a basis for estimating the likely degree of sample dependence in the data .",
    "figures  [ fig : both_samples ] and  [ fig : compare ] plot the excess specific heat @xmath22 normalized per mole of ce . here , @xmath23 is the lattice ( phonon ) contribution , estimated from the data of lin _ _ et al.__@xcite figure  [ fig : both_samples ] also shows error bars for a few representative points .",
    "the uncertainties reflect possible errors both in the measured total specific heat and in the lattice correction . by 10k",
    ", @xmath23 makes up roughly 90% of @xmath4 , so the uncertainty in @xmath19 is particularly large at the upper end of the measured temperature range .",

    "it is probable that the cef scheme is affected only weakly by substitution of la for some ce atoms since the immediate environment of each remaining ce is unaffected , so we set @xmath61k in our calculations .    in a magnetic field @xmath62 ,",
    "the cef states are mixed by the zeeman interaction .",
    "therefore , the effective hamiltonian governing the atomic @xmath63 ce@xmath50 multiplet is @xmath64 where @xmath36 is the bohr magneton and the land @xmath16 factor for ce@xmath50 ( @xmath55 , @xmath65 , @xmath66 ) is @xmath67 .    for a given @xmath62 , we diagonalized @xmath68 and found the splitting @xmath69 between the lowest two energy eigenvalues .",
    "we then used the relation @xmath70 to deduce an effective value of @xmath71 to insert into the @xmath72 kondo impurity model .",
    "this effective @xmath16 factor is dependent on both the magnitude of @xmath62 and its orientation relative to the crystal axes .",
    "the strongest variation of @xmath31 with @xmath30 is found for fields oriented along the @xmath73 directions , while the weakest variation occurs for fields along @xmath74 .    to model the random orientation of our polycrystals relative to the field , we averaged @xmath71 over all directions of @xmath62 at fixed @xmath75 .",
    "table  [ table ] shows the largest value , the smallest value , the mean , and the standard deviation of @xmath31 for each field @xmath30 at which the specific heat was measured , as well as the minimum splitting @xmath51 between the second and third lowest eigenenergies .",
    "the table shows that over the range of fields covered in our experiments , the lowest - lying pair of states remains well separated in energy from the remaining four states .",
    "this separation ( @xmath76k ) justifies the neglect of the higher levels at temperatures @xmath77k .",
    "second , it turns out that although the field causes quite strong mixing of cef levels , the distribution of @xmath31 values remains fairly narrow , and the mean value shows a rather weak dependence on @xmath30 .",
    "we used just the mean value @xmath32 in a nrg calculation of @xmath29 at each magnetic field .",
    "( the nrg calculations are computer intensive , and it was therefore impractical to average over the entire distribution of @xmath31 values . ) we discuss the likely effect of this approximation in the next section .",
    "figure  [ fig : both_samples ] shows the excess specific heat for samples 1 and 2 , at fields @xmath78 and @xmath79 t . at each field , the data for the two samples lie close to one another .",
    "in particular , the location ( in temperature ) and height of the peak in @xmath19 are very consistent between the samples .",
    "given that samples 1 and 2 were synthesized independently , the agreement between their specific heats ( both in zero and nonzero fields ) suggests that the data represent the intrinsic properties of ce@xmath0la@xmath1pb@xmath2 , and are not merely sample - specific artifacts .",
    "figure  [ fig : compare ] compares all the excess specific heat data for both samples with the impurity specific - heat contribution @xmath29 computed as described in the preceding section .",
    "given that there is no adjustable parameter beyond the kondo temperature @xmath10 deduced from the zero field data , there is good agreement between experiment and theory .",
    "the kondo model reproduces the field variation of the height of the specific heat peak with very high accuracy .",
    "the temperature of the peak in @xmath19 is also well described , the only significant deviation occurring for @xmath80 t .    in all cases",
    "@xmath81 , the peak in the experimental data is somewhat broader than predicted by the kondo model , particularly on the low - temperature side of the maximum in @xmath19 .",
    "this broadening may be partially attributable to the spread in @xmath31 values arising from the distribution of angles between the magnetic field and the cubic crystal axes .",
    "as indicated by the maximum and minimum values listed in table  [ table ] , the @xmath31 distribution has longer tails on the low-@xmath31 side of @xmath82 , which should tend to produce an asymmetry of the type seen in @xmath19 vs @xmath5 .",
    "the rather minor differences between the field dependence observed in the specific heat of ce@xmath0la@xmath1pb@xmath2 and that predicted by the single - impurity kondo model suggest that there is no significant coherence effect in the specific heat of this system , at least at temperatures of order the single - ion kondo scale and higher .",
    "this provides a clear counter example to the two - fluid model advanced@xcite for ce@xmath6la@xmath7coin@xmath8 and ce@xmath6la@xmath7irin@xmath8 , where coherence effects set in at temperatures more than an order of magnitude above @xmath10 .",
