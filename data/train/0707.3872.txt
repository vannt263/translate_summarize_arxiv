    "accessible information about a quantum system is restricted by the noncommutability of observables .",
    "the nature of this restriction can be classified essentially into two categories : fluctuations inherent in a quantum system and the error caused by the process of measurement .",
    "these aspects of uncertainty constitute the two distinctive features of quantum mechanics .",
    "the kennard - robertson uncertainty relation such as @xmath0 describes quantum fluctuations that are independent of the measurement process  @xcite .",
    "according to bell s theorem  @xcite , this type of quantum fluctuations prohibits us from presupposing any `` element of reality ''  @xcite behind the probability distributions of observables . the measurement error , on the other hand",
    ", is determined by the process of measurement which is characterized by a positive operator - valued measure ( povm )  @xcite . in the idealized error - free limit",
    ", quantum measurement is described by projection operators which , however , can not always be implemented experimentally .",
    "information about more than one observable can be obtained from a single povm in simultaneous measurement of two noncommuting observables and quantum - state tomography .",
    "it is known , however , that , in simultaneous measurements , at least one of the observables can not be measured without incurring a measurement error  @xcite . in this context , various uncertainty relations between the measurement errors of noncommuting observables have been studied  @xcite .    in this paper , we quantify the measurement accuracy and the measurement error of observables in terms of a given povm @xmath1 by introducing @xmath2 accuracy matrix @xmath3 calculated from the povm . based on this accuracy matrix , we derive trade - off relations between the measurement accuracy of two or three observables , these being stronger trade - off relations than those derived in our previous work  @xcite",
    ". they can be interpreted as the uncertainty relations between the measurement errors of noncommuting observables in simultaneous measurements or as the uncertainty relations between the measurement error and back - action of the measurement  @xcite .",
    "in addition , a no - cloning inequality  @xcite is derived from the trade - off relations .    in a rather different context",
    ", the maximum - likelihood estimation  @xcite has been investigated as the standard scheme of quantum state tomography for a finite number of samples .",
    "several studies have focused on the efficiency and optimality of the estimation of an unknown quantum state  @xcite .",
    "we show that our characterization of the measurement accuracy can be related to the maximum - likelihood estimation and that the accuracy matrix can be interpreted as an average of the fisher information matrix over the state to be measured .",
    "the trade - off relations can also be interpreted as those concerning the accuracy of the estimate of various probability distributions of noncommuting observables .",
    "the constitution of this paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we formulate the general quantum measurement of a qubit ( spin-1/2 ) system . in sec .",
    "iii , we define the accuracy matrix and investigate its properties . based on this accuracy matrix , we define the accuracy parameter and error parameter in a particular direction of measurement . in sec .",
    "iv , we derive the trade - off relations between the accuracy parameters or the error parameters in two or three directions . in sec .",
    "v , we apply the trade - off relations to specific problems : the uncertainty relations between measurement errors in nonideal joint measurements , the uncertainty relations between the error and back - action , a no - cloning inequality , and quantum state tomography . in sec .",

    "( [ projection - povm ] ) that any measurement process described by a povm consisting of two positive operators is formally equivalent to a measurement process in which a classical error is added to the projection measurement .",

    "other important examples such as nonideal joint measurements and quantum state tomography are discussed in sec .",
    "we will characterize the accuracy of an arbitrary observable in such a manner that it depends only on the process of measurement and not on the measured state @xmath61 .",

    "the physical meaning and useful properties of the accuracy matrix will be investigated subsequently , and its foundation from an information - theoretic point of view will be established in terms of the maximum - likelihood estimation of the probability distribution of observables in sec .  vi .",
    "in fact , the accuracy matrix is closely related to fisher information matrix ( [ fisher1 ] ) or ( [ fisher2 ] ) , although physical quantities such as the measurement error can be directly derived from the accuracy matrix without resort to fisher information .",
