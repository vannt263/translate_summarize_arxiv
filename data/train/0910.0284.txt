    "it is well - known that the linear inequalities always satisfied by ranks of subspaces of a vector space ( referred to here as _ linear rank inequalities _ ) are closely related to the linear inequalities satisfied by entropies of jointly distributed random variables ( often referred to as _ information inequalities _ ) . for background material on this relationship and other topics used here , a useful source is hammer , romashchenko , shen , and vereshchagin @xcite .",
    "the present paper is about linear rank inequalities ; nonetheless , the basic results from information theory will be useful enough that we choose to use the notation of information theory here .",
    "we use the following common definitions : @xmath0    there are two interpretations of these equations .",
    "when @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 are random variables , @xmath4 denotes the joint random variable combining @xmath1 and @xmath2 ; @xmath5 is the entropy of @xmath1 ; @xmath6 is the entropy of @xmath1 given @xmath2 ; @xmath7 is the mutual information of @xmath1 and @xmath2 ; and @xmath8 is the mutual information of @xmath1 and @xmath2 given @xmath3 .",
    "but when @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 denote subspaces of a vector space , then @xmath4 denotes the space spanned by @xmath1 and @xmath2 , which is @xmath9 or , since @xmath1 and @xmath2 are subspaces , just @xmath10 ; @xmath5 is the rank of @xmath1 ; @xmath6 is the excess of the rank of @xmath1 over that of @xmath11 ; @xmath7 is the rank of @xmath11 ; and @xmath8 is the excess of the rank of @xmath12 over that of @xmath3 . in either interpretation ,",
    "the equations above are valid .",
    "the basic shannon inequalities state that @xmath8 ( as well as the reduced forms @xmath7 , @xmath6 , and @xmath5 ) is nonnegative for any random variables @xmath13",
    ". any nonnegative linear combination of basic shannon inequalities is called a shannon inequality .",
    "we will use standard shannon computations such as @xmath14 ( one can check this by expanding into basic @xmath15 terms ) and @xmath16 ( because the difference is @xmath8 ) throughout this paper ; an excellent source for background material on this is yeung  @xcite .",
    "a key well - known fact is that all information inequalities ( and in particular the shannon inequalities ) are also linear rank inequalities for finite - dimensional vector spaces . to see this",
    ", first note that in the case of a _ finite _ vector space @xmath17 over a finite field @xmath18 , each subspace can be turned into a random variable so that the entropy of the random variable is the same ( up to a constant factor ) as the rank of the subspace : let @xmath19 be a random variable ranging uniformly over @xmath20 ( the set of linear functions from @xmath17 to @xmath18 ) , and to each subspace @xmath1 of @xmath17 associate the random variable @xmath21 .",
    "the entropy of this random variable will be the rank of @xmath1 , if entropy logarithms are taken to base @xmath22 .",
    "for the infinite case , one can use the theorem of rado  @xcite that any representable matroid is representable over a finite field , and hence any configuration of finite - rank vector spaces over any field has a corresponding configuration over some finite field .",
    "the converse is not true ; there are linear rank inequalities which are not information inequalities .",
    "the first such example is the ingleton inequality , which in terms of basic ranks or joint entropies is @xmath23 but which can be written more succinctly using the @xmath24 notation as @xmath25 ingleton  @xcite proved this inequality and asked whether there are still further independent inequalities of this kind .    a key tool used by hammer et al .",
    "@xcite is the notion of common information .",
    "a random variable @xmath26 is a _ common information _ of random variables @xmath1 and @xmath2 if it satisfies the following conditions : @xmath27 , @xmath28 , and @xmath29 . in other words",
    ", @xmath26 encapsulates the mutual information of @xmath1 and @xmath2 . in general , two random variables @xmath1 and @xmath2 might not have a common information .",
    "but in the context of vector spaces ( or the random variables coming from them ) , common informations always exist ; if @xmath1 and @xmath2 are subspaces of a vector space , one can just let @xmath26 be the intersection of @xmath1 and @xmath2 , and @xmath26 will have the desired properties .    hammer et al .",
    "@xcite showed that the ingleton inequality ( and its permuted - variable forms ) and the shannon inequalities fully characterize the cone of linearly representable entropy vectors on four random variables ( i.e. , there are no more linear rank inequalities to be found on four variables ) .",
    "we will answer ingleton s question here . using the existence of common informations",
    ", one can prove the following twenty - four new linear rank inequalities on five variables ( this is a complete and irreducible list , as will be explained below ) .",
    "@xmath30    @xmath31    ( note that there is much more variety of form in these inequalities than there is in the four - variable non - shannon - type inequalities from  @xcite . )",
    "each of these inequalities is provable from the shannon inequalities if we assume that each mutual information on the left - hand side of the inequality is in fact realized by a common information .",
    "( hence , since such common informations always exist in the linear case , the inequalities are all linear rank inequalities . ) for instance , inequalities ( 1)(10 ) all hold if we assume that there is a random variable @xmath26 such that @xmath32 and @xmath33 ; inequality ( 23 ) holds if there exist random variables @xmath26 and @xmath34 such that @xmath35 , @xmath33 , and @xmath36 ; and so on .",
    "these assertions can all be verified using the program itip  @xcite .",
    "in fact , all of these become shannon inequalities if we replace the left - hand mutual information(s ) with terms @xmath37 or @xmath38 and add to the right - hand side appropriate terms like @xmath39 for a sufficiently large coefficient @xmath40 ( @xmath41 suffices for all of these inequalities ) .",
    "for example , for inequality ( 1 ) , one can show that @xmath42 is a shannon inequality ; if we set @xmath26 to be a common information for @xmath1 and @xmath2 , we get inequality  ( 1 ) . again",
    "the verifications of these shannon inequalities can be performed using itip , or one can work them out explicitly . in section  [ proofs ]",
    "we will present various alternate proof techniques .",
    "these inequalities can be written in other equivalent forms .",
    "obvious rewrites ( move the first term on the right to the left ) : @xmath43    obvious rewrites ( enlarge terms on the left so they can be combined ) : @xmath44    non - obvious rewrites : @xmath45 note that , for these variant forms , we do _ not _ make the claim that the inequality follows from the existence of common informations corresponding to the left - hand - side terms .",
    "for instance , inequality  ( 19c ) does not follow from the shannon inequalities and the existence of a common information for @xmath2 and  @xmath3 .",
    "it turns out that inequality  ( 24b ) is provable from existence of a common information for @xmath46 and @xmath47 , and inequalities ( 19b ) , ( 21b ) , ( 22b ) , and  ( 23b ) are provable from existence of a common information for @xmath1 and  @xmath48 , but inequalities ( 18b ) and  ( 20b ) are not ; in fact , no single common information ( together with the shannon inequalities ) suffices to prove ( 18 ) or ( 20 ) .",
    "in this section we will provide some alternate proof techniques for the inequalities .",
    "this will lead to natural generalizations .",

    "we then examined the vectors generating the extreme rays to see whether they were representable ( over the reals ; we did not try to get representations working over all fields until after the iterative process was complete ) .",
    "when such a vector provably could not be represented , the proof ( in each case we ran into here ) yielded a new linear rank inequality provable via common informations ; when we examined a vector where we had difficulty determining whether it was representable or not , we ran exhaustive tests on all ways of specifying a single common information ( toward the end , we had to try a pair of common informations ) to see whether itip could verify that the specified vector contradicted the shannon inequalities together with the common information specification .",
    "again each such verification led to a new linear rank inequality .",
    "( of course , this is a highly sanitized version of the process as it actually occurred . )",
    "the testing of extreme rays for linear representability soon became a large task , so we gradually developed software to automatically find such representations in a number of cases ( and we added more cases when we found new ways to represent vectors ) .",
    "this software used combinatorial rather than linear - algebra methods ; for instance , the output of the program for the sample vector @xmath221 used above was a specification of five vector spaces @xmath184 which could be paraphrased as : `` @xmath1 is generated by one vector , @xmath2 is generated by one vector not in @xmath1 , @xmath3 is generated by one vector not in @xmath10 [ the space spanned by @xmath1 and @xmath2 ] , @xmath223 is generated by one vector in general position in @xmath224 , and @xmath225 is generated by two vectors , one in @xmath226 and one in @xmath3 .

    "if there is a problem with specifying that the vector is in such a sum of basic subspaces , then we may have to specify that the vector is in the intersection of two sums of basic subspaces .",
    "once the first vector is chosen , we take quotients of all of the existing spaces by this vector to get the new situation in which the second vector needs to be chosen .",
    "this is all done by counting dimensions , not by constructing actual numerical vectors .",
    "for instance , suppose the first vector is chosen to be in general position in subspace @xmath228 which is a sum of basic subspaces from @xmath227 ( e.g. , @xmath229 ) .",
    "for each other sum subspace @xmath120 , if the new vector is in @xmath120 , then the quotient by the chosen vector will reduce the dimension of @xmath120 by 1 ; if the chosen vector is not in @xmath120 , then the quotient will not change the dimension of @xmath120 . since the vector is in general position in @xmath228 , the vector will be in @xmath120 if and only if @xmath230 , and to check whether @xmath230 one simply has to see whether @xmath231 .",
    "the case where the vector is chosen from an intersection of two sum subspaces @xmath228 and @xmath232 is more complicated ; more on this below .",
    "consider the example .",
    "suppose that we have already constructed the representations for subspaces @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and @xmath223 , and we are now ready to construct the representation for subspace  @xmath225 .",
    "the current situation can be summarized by the following two - row array : @xmath233 here the first row is the ranks of sums from @xmath227 in the order given by , but starting with the empty space . for each of these sums",
    ", the second row gives the amount by which adding the new subspace @xmath225 will increase the dimension of the sum .",
    "( so the second entry in this row is @xmath234 , the fourth entry is @xmath235 , and so on . )    from this array , we can see that , since @xmath225 has dimension 2 but only increases the dimension of @xmath10 by 1 , one of the nonzero vectors in @xmath225 must be in @xmath10 .",
    "so let us start by assuming that one of the vectors in @xmath225 is a vector chosen in general position in @xmath229 .",
    "we can now check for all sums from @xmath227 whether the sum will contain this chosen vector ; this information is summarized in the row @xmath236 where 1 means the chosen vector is in the corresponding sum . to get the result of taking a quotient by ( the subspace generated by ) the chosen vector , we subtract from the first row of   ( because we have used up one vector from each of the indicated subspaces ) and subtract the one s complement of   from the second row of   ( because we have taken care of one of the new vectors for @xmath225 beyond each of the indicated subspaces ) .",
    "so the situation after the first vector is chosen is given by : @xmath237 of course , the negative entry in this array means that a problem has occurred : we tried to take a new vector not in @xmath238 , but the given ranks require all vectors in @xmath225 to be in @xmath238 .",
    "so we will try again ; instead of taking a vector in general position in @xmath239 , we take a vector in general position in @xmath240 , where @xmath241 .",
    "this leaves the problem of determining , for each sum subspace @xmath120 , whether the chosen vector is in @xmath120 ; as before , this is equivalent to determining whether @xmath242 .",
    "this is not as straightforward as it was to determine whether @xmath243 ; in fact , there are situations where the given data on ranks of sum subspaces simply do not determine whether @xmath244 .",
    "but we have identified many situations where the given data do allow this determination to be made .",
    "here is a list ; note that ( a ) each such test can also be applied with @xmath228 and @xmath232 interchanged , and ( b ) reading this list is not necessary for understanding the rest of the algorithm .    * if @xmath230 , then @xmath244 . *",

    "these tests do suffice for the example here ; the resulting membership vector is @xmath299 and the new array after taking a quotient by the first chosen vector is : @xmath300 let us call the new quotient spaces @xmath301 .",
    "the new ranks indicate that the remaining vector in @xmath302 must be chosen to be in @xmath303 .",
    "if we take the new vector in general position in @xmath303 , then the resulting membership vector is : @xmath304 ( note that we needed the chosen vector to be in @xmath305 as well as in @xmath303 , but this turned out to be automatic , because the given ranks implied @xmath306 . ) and the result of taking a quotient by the second chosen vector is : @xmath307 the all-0 row means that the representation of @xmath225 has been successfully completed .",
    "the current algorithm does not try many possibilities for the next vector to choose ; it simply chooses one sum subspace ( usually at the beginning of the list of available ones ) to try to add a vector to , and , if that yields an immediate contradiction , perhaps tries one intersection of two sum subspaces .",
    "if any such step fails ( either because of a contradiction , or because the algorithm can not determine whether @xmath244 in some case ) , the algorithm gives up .",
    "however , the algorithm does give itself up to 120 chances by trying all permutations of the 5 basic variables .",
    "each time a new extreme ray was produced , the above algorithm was applied as a positive test for representability , while tests against common informations were used as negative tests .",
    "if both sides failed , the ray was examined by hand .",
    "sometimes this examination yielded a representation because we found a new way of determining whether @xmath308 ; if so , this new test was added to the algorithm . at the end ,",
    "the algorithm was able to verify representability of 152 of the final 162 extreme rays , leaving only 10 to be done by hand ( by methods which did not fit in the framework of this algorithm ) .",
    "there are other possibilities for improving the algorithm that we have not yet implemented .",
    "one is doing a backtrack search to consider more possibilities for choosing vectors to add ; another is to use the information on representation of previous subspaces in the construction of the representation of the current subspace .",
    "( in the preceding example , we used only the dimension data for @xmath227 in the construction of the representation for @xmath225 ; we did not use the actual representations constructed for @xmath227 . )",
    "more ambitious would be to allow more options for choosing new vectors in terms of the known relations between the current subspaces .",
    "this iterative process for finding all linear rank inequalities is likely to be infeasible to complete for six or more variables .",
    "( each cddlib polytope computation in 31 dimensions took about 23 days ; in 63 dimensions it would take far longer , as well as rapidly exceeding the memory available . ) but we plan to continue the study , because we expect to find new phenomena at higher levels , possibly including extreme rays that are representable over some fields but not over others ( hence yielding rank inequalities which hold only over those other fields ) , and inequalities which hold for ranks of vector spaces but are not provable via common informations . for instance , such situations could come from the variables associated with the fano and non - fano networks in @xcite , or the network in @xcite .    in order to make any progress at all , we had to take some shortcuts ( since , as noted above , 63-dimensional polytope computations were out of the question ) .",
    "one of these was to reduce the dimension of the search by assuming equality for one or more of the inequalities found so far ; in effect , this is just concentrating on one face , corner , or intermediate - dimensional extreme part of the current region .",
    "another was to work hard on trying to improve already - obtained inequalities , find additional instances of them , or strengthen them in multiple ways if they were not already faces of the region .",
    "we will show here some of the 6-variable inequalities we have found so far ; a much longer list is available at :    http://zeger.us/linrank    all of these have been verified to be faces of the linear rank region ( so they can not be improved ) . to do this",
    ", we used a stockpile of linearly representable 6-variable polymatroids ( the representability was proved by the algorithm described in the preceding section ) encountered during the polytope computations .",
    "if a 6-variable linear rank inequality is satisfied with equality by 62 linearly independent vectors from the stockpile , then it must give a face of the linear rank region .",
    "( the stockpile currently contains 3220 polymatroids , or 1846734 after one takes all instances obtained by permuting the six basic variables .",
    "it is also available at the above website . )",
    "first , there are the 6-variable elemental shannon inequalities ; there are 6 of these if one lists just one of each form , but 246 of them if all of the permuted - variable versions are counted .",
    "then there are 12 instances of the ingleton inequality ( 1470 counting permuted forms ) .",
    "again , see yeung  @xcite and guill , chan , and grant  @xcite for the proof that these inequalities imply all of the other shannon and ingleton inequalities .",
    "next come the instances of the 5-variable inequalities ( 1)(24 ) .",
    "the initial computation found 183 of these instances that ( with permuted forms ) proved all of the others .",
    "however , 16 of these instances did not pass the face verification above and were later superseded by other 6-variable inequalities ; this left 167 ( 61740 counting permuted forms ) 5-variable instances which were faces of the 6-variable rank region .",
    "finally , there are the true 6-variable inequalities .",
    "we have found 3490 of these so far ( 2395095 counting permuted forms ) which pass the face verification , along with several hundred more which do not pass and which we expect to be superseded later ( though this is not guaranteed ; perhaps our stockpile of representable polymatroids is insufficient , although the face test has been very reliable so far ) .",
    "we give some examples of these here ; see the website mentioned above for the full list .",
    "some inequalities follow directly from theorem  [ thm : tree1 ] , such as : @xmath309 and others follow directly from theorem  [ thm : tree2 ] , such as : @xmath310 then there are inequalities which follow from theorem  [ thm : tree1 ] or theorem  [ thm : tree2 ] using equivalent forms : @xmath311 all of the sharp inequalities found so far using one common information have been verified to be instances of theorem  [ thm : tree2 ] .",
    "it seems quite possible that this theorem generates all one - common - information inequalities , but we have no proof of this .",
    "there are also hundreds of inequalities that required two common informations to prove .",
    "( inequalities requiring more than two common informations are beyond the range of our software at present . )",
    "these are of two types .",
    "one type is those like inequalities ( 18 ) and ( 20 ) which have two information terms on the left side and use the common informations corresponding to those terms : @xmath312 the other type has just one information term on the left side but requires a second common information in addition to the one from the left term : @xmath313 inequality   is proved using a common information for @xmath1 and @xmath2 along with a common information for @xmath225 and @xmath314 ; inequality   is proved using a common information for @xmath315 and @xmath316 along with a common information for @xmath317 and @xmath318 ; and inequality   is proved using a common information  @xmath26 for @xmath1 and @xmath319 along with a common information for @xmath18 and @xmath26 .",
    "( the possible need for such iteration of common informations along with joining of variables makes it conceivable that an unbounded number of common informations could be needed to prove linear rank inequalities even on a fixed number of initial variables such as  6 . )    since the inequalities in this paper have been proven using only common informations and the shannon inequalities , they apply not only to linear ranks but also in any other situation where we have random variables which are known to have common informations . for instance , chan notes in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* definition  4 ) that abelian group characterizable random variables always have common informations ( which are still abelian group characterizable random variables ) ; hence , the inequalities proven here hold for such variables .",
    "the following theorem shows that there will be essentially new inequalities for each number of variables :    [ thm : independence ] for any @xmath320 , the inequality @xmath321 is a linear rank inequality on @xmath322 variables which is not a consequence of instances of linear rank inequalities on fewer than @xmath322 variables .",
    "first , it is not hard to show that is equivalent to , and we have already seen that is a linear rank inequality ( this can also be proved using theorem  [ thm : tree2 ] ) , so is a linear rank inequality .    in the following , if @xmath323 , we will write @xmath324 for @xmath325 .",

    "we construct rank vectors @xmath330 , each of which is the same as @xmath189 except for one value .",
    "the changed values are : @xmath331    we will show that each of these @xmath332 vectors is linearly representable over any infinite or sufficiently large finite field @xmath18 . in each case , the representation will use a vector space @xmath17 over @xmath18 of dimension @xmath333 , with a basis @xmath334 , and the variable @xmath335 ( @xmath336 ) will be represented by the two - dimensional subspace @xmath337 .    for the representations of @xmath1 and @xmath2 , instead of giving explicit formulas , it will be convenient to use the following concept .",

    "a point @xmath338 is said to be _ in general position _ in @xmath190 ,",

    "if the set @xmath232 is of size bounded by @xmath341 , then the `` in general position '' condition excludes at most @xmath342 proper subspaces of @xmath190 ( including the trivial subspace ) , so there is no problem finding points in general position as long as the field size is greater than @xmath342 .",
    "if we refer to multiple points being chosen in general position , then they should be considered as chosen successively , with later points being in general position relative to earlier points as well as the previous set @xmath232 .",
    "this concept has been referred to by various terms ; for instance , in in  @xcite such points are referred to as `` freely placed '' .",
