    "[ sec_intro ]    fundamental studies of the thermodynamic and structural properties of ions in water and near proteins are important for understanding a wide range of chemical and biological phenomena . for example , in the central nervous system , ion - coupled membrane transporters regulate signaling by utilizing the electrochemical potential of specific ions to pump organic substrates and amino acids across the cell membrane.@xcite as another example , chloride transporters exchange two chloride ions for one proton during the transport cycle.@xcite to gain more insight into the mechanism , specificity , and function of these transporters , the binding properties of specific ions to the transporters and the ion hydration process in bulk water need to be characterized .",
    "the hydration of atomic and molecular ions has been the focus of intensive research for over 100 years .",
    "more recently , specific ion effects have resurfaced in diverse fields,@xcite including hydration free energies , ion activities , surface tension increments , bubble interactions , colloid interactions , biological membrane multilayer swelling,@xcite and polymer phase equilibria,@xcite to name several examples .",
    "such specificity requires theoretical treatments that go beyond simple dielectric models .",
    "specific interactions at the molecular level are involved , and that specificity can lead to dramatic changes in bulk properties when one ion is substituted with another.@xcite it has been argued that ion specificity is a central problem in connecting physical science to biological systems , and that the connection has not been fully made so far.@xcite    calculation of the solvation and binding properties of an ion in water and near proteins for a classical model is now routine on modern workstations . the accuracy of these calculations depends sensitively on the classical model potential used , however . in the same spirit as doren , wood , and",
    "coworkers,@xcite we are interested in incorporating quantum mechanical calculations in the study of the thermodynamics of ions in water and near proteins . the basic idea in refs .",
    "@xcite is to perform classical simulations , obtain the free energy from those classical simulations , and then use the classical configurations coupled with statistical mechanical perturbation theory to correct those free energies towards the quantum result .",
    "this method is less expensive than a direct _ ab initio _ molecular dynamics ( aimd ) quantum simulation@xcite since it uses a classical simulation to generate configurations for thermal averages .",
    "it is also more accurate than a classical simulation since it can in principle represent the electronic properties near the ions from first principles .    as a first step , here we study the aqueous solvation structures of the chloride ion in bulk water by utilizing the classical polarizable amoeba force field simulations and then by performing detailed quantum mechanical calculations on local solvation clusters extracted from the classical simulations .",
    "the cluster refers to the chloride ion and the coordinating water molecules in the first solvation shell , including interactions with more distant waters at the amoeba level .",
    "the polarization of the water molecules and ions in their solvation environment is explored by analyzing charges and dipoles generated from the charge distribution in the quantum mechanical model .",
    "higher - level electronic structure methods ( mp2 level ) are employed to include electron correlation effects at a modest level of accuracy .",
    "also , the first - shell water polarization is studied as a function of the cluster size .",
    "the present approach allows efficient calculation of configurational averages for an accurate qm / mm model .",
    "this paper is part of a series developing and exploiting computational methods for calculating the electronic and thermodynamic properties of ions in water.@xcite future work will focus on ion binding in proteins .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we next discuss the classical and quantum computational approaches employed for the study of local hydration structure .",
    "the results of the calculations are then presented , followed by our conclusions and discussion of implications for simulations of ion hydration and future research directions .",
    "in this section , we present our approach for studying the electronic structural properties of the anion solvation shell .      the molecular dynamics ( md ) trajectories were generated using the polarizable amoeba force field@xcite as implemented in the amber package.@xcite the amoeba force field has been shown to reproduce the expected dipole moment , dielectric constant , and energetics of bulk water from the gas phase to the bulk phase@xcite and over a wide range of temperatures and pressures.@xcite in addition , this force field has been extended to include ion - water interactions , and excellent results for ion hydration free energies have been obtained.@xcite    the simulated bulk system consists of a single cl@xmath0 ion and 215 water molecules .",
    "the simulations were performed using a timestep of 1.25 fs .",
    "configurations were saved every 0.5 ps for later analysis .",
    "periodic boundary conditions were applied in all three dimensions .",
    "long - range electrostatic interactions were handled using the pme algorithm@xcite with a real - space cutoff of 8  .",
    "the nonbonded interactions were truncated at 10  .",
    "the temperature was maintained at 300 k using langevin dynamics with a collision frequency of 5ps^-1^.  the pressure was maintained at 1.0 atm using the isotropic position scaling scheme with a pressure relaxation time of 2.0 ps .",
    "the cubic simulation box was allowed to scale in size isotropically in order to maintain constant pressure .",
    "the system was equilibrated for 120 ps ( the system density was seen to converge within the first 20 ps ) , and then a production run of 500ps was performed for further analysis .",
    "the geometries of the anion - water clusters were extracted from the amoeba molecular dynamics trajectories for the subsequent electronic structure calculations .",
    "the clusters for a given system configuration consisted of the chloride ion and all waters that satisfied a hydrogen - bonding condition discussed below .",
    "there is of course no guarantee that these configurations accurately represent the solvation environment at the quantum level . in another paper,@xcite",
    "we have found that anion solvation anisotropy in classical polarizable force field simulations is significantly affected by the polarizability of the anion .",
    "in addition , we found that the amoeba model over - polarizes the chloride ion by roughly a factor of 2 relative to aimd simulations.@xcite thus we performed simulations both with the default amoeba chloride ion polarizability ( 4 @xmath1 ) and with the polarizability reduced by a factor of 2 . while the solvation anisotropy decreases with the lower polarizability value , the results for water dipole magnitudes and charge transfer computed quantum mechanically did not substantially change ; as expected , the ion dipoles from the amoeba model decreased substantially to 62% of the computed average from the default simulation , and the estimated quantum mechanical ion dipoles decreased slightly due to the reduced hydration anisotropy ( below ) .",
    "the electronic structure calculations were performed at the 2nd - order perturbation theory level .",
    "the mp2 calculations were performed with the gaussian 03 package@xcite using augmented correlation - consistent polarized valence basis sets of double @xmath2 quality ( aug - cc - pvdz).@xcite this basis set has been shown to yield accurate molecular electrostatic interaction energies@xcite and charge transfer estimates compared with experiment.@xcite the total energy was converged to a precision of 10 ^ -8^ hartrees .",

    "the average value of the dipole moment of the water molecules in the first solvation shell is close to , but slightly less than , the bulk amoeba water value ( 2.78 d ) for both the mp2-chelpg and the amoeba calculations ; the mp2-chelpg estimate is 2.67 d while the amoeba model prediction is 2.72 d. figure [ fig : dips ] presents the distributions of instantaneous first - shell water dipole magnitudes ; neither the mp2-chelpg nor the amoeba distributions change appreciably with reduced chloride ion polarizability in the amoeba simulations .",
    "raugei and kleins@xcite cpmd study of the bromide ion in water also suggested the water molecules in the first shell possess dipole moments close to those of bulk water molecules .",
    "recent extensive aimd simulations have shown slighly suppressed water dipoles in the first solvation shell for the larger halides@xcite and the k@xmath4 ion,@xcite in agreement with our amoeba and mp2 results .    to further investigate which interactions are most responsible for the polarization of water molecules in the first shell and the interplay of ion - water and water - water interactions",
    ", we studied the magnitude of the average dipole moment of the water molecules neighboring the chloride ion as a function of increasing cluster size _",
    "n _ , as shown in figure [ fig : dips_n ] .",
    "this was done to account for the impact of increasing numbers of waters surrounding the ion . only the default chloride ion polarizability case was considered in examining the size dependence , since the anion polarizability had a relatively small effect on the water dipole distributions .",

    "_ of water molecules neighboring a cl@xmath0 ion as a function of increasing cluster size _",
    "n_. on the left , the system modeled included the ion and the given number of water molecules . on the right ,",
    "6 waters were treated quantum mechanically in the first shell , and the rest of the waters in the qm / mm cluster were represented with amoeba charges distributed as described in section [ sec_methods ] . on the right ,",
    "average dipoles over the nearest 6 waters are presented , but those waters interact with increasing numbers of surrounding amoeba waters . ]    for this analysis , we present the thermally averaged results for clusters of the ion with the @xmath5 nearest waters extracted from the simulations and plot the results as a function of @xmath5 . on the left side of figure [ fig : dips_n ] , average dipole magnitudes were computed for the @xmath5 nearest waters at the quantum level with no interactions with more distant waters . as we increase the ion - water cluster size ( @xmath6 ) , we find that the average dipole moment of the water molecules in the first hydration shell of the ion ( at the qm / mm level ) first increases to a value around 2.2 d and then stays roughly constant ( decreasing slightly with increasing @xmath5 ) .",
    "we note that , in our calculations , the numbering is such that the second and successive water molecules are chosen as the nearest water to the preceding water oxygen .",
    "this choice was made in order to explore the effects of nearby water - water interactions .",
    "the average distance between the two water molecules , measured by the distance between the two o atoms , is around 3.5  .",
    "the addition of a second water molecule significantly increases the polarization of the first water molecule , even though there is no direct hydrogen bonding between the two water molecules .",
    "the appreciable deviation between the quantum and amoeba results for the @xmath7 case may be tied to the larger charge transfer to the closest water discussed above , and may reflect limitations of the classical polarizable model .",
    "further addition of water molecules in the first hydration shell does nt substantially affect the polarization of water molecules on average .",
    "previous reports examining polarization for hydration shell water molecules of anions displayed a different @xmath5 dependence for the water dipoles.@xcite this is likely because of the different cl@xmath0/(h@xmath3o)@xmath8 cluster structures investigated .",
    "we utilize the instantaneous cluster structures extracted from the molecular dynamics simulation , while ref .",
    "@xcite used optimized gas phase cluster structures . comparing our mp2 calculations with the amoeba calculations , we find the amoeba model slightly overestimates the dipole moments of the water molecules in the first shell for @xmath9 , with better agreement as @xmath5 increases .",
    "finally , we study the effect of the second solvation shell and further shell water molecules on the polarization of the first shell water molecules . on the right of figure [ fig : dips_n ] , the average dipole magnitudes of the nearest 6 waters are presented , but those waters interact electrostatically with the remainder of the @xmath10 waters handled at the amoeba level .",
    "we find that the addition of the second solvation shell ( represented as sets of charges so as to reproduce the amoeba multipole potential ) with formation of direct hydrogen bonding to those external waters increases the average dipole moment of the first shell water molecules further by about 20% .",
    "third and further solvation shells do nt appear to have a large impact on the polarization of the first shell water molecules .",
    "as discussed above , upon full hydration the average dipole magnitude is 2.67 d for the inner - shell water molecules , which is slighly smaller than the amoeba value of 2.72 d and close to the amoeba value for bulk water ( 2.78 d ) .",
    "we note that the water dipole values presented here are somewhat below those observed in aimd - dft simulations;@xcite an experimental estimate for bulk water is 2.9 d.@xcite the results support the picture suggested by raugei and klein,@xcite krekeler and delle site,@xcite and gurdia , skarmoutsos , and masia@xcite that the anion scarcely influences the polarization of the water molecules in the first solvation shell ; in fact the inner - shell waters appear to have average dipole magnitudes slightly reduced from the bulk value .",
    "we observe that the first - shell water - water interactions ( modified by interactions with the ion ) and the h - bonding environment from the second solvating shell are the major factors that determine the polarization of the first shell water molecules .",
    "this result supports the idea suggested by devereux and popelier that the local h - bonding environment of a water molecule determines its charge distribution and electronic properties.@xcite",
    "this paper has examined the local structure and polarization involved in chloride ion hydration with a qm / mm treatment .",
    "classical polarizable force field molecular dynamics simulations were performed with the amoeba model .",
    "clusters were extracted from the simulations for further analysis with quantum chemical methods at the mp2-level of electronic structure theory .",
    "the clusters treated quantum mechanically involved the ion and the nearest waters in the first solvation shell .",
    "the inner - shell clusters interacted with more distant waters modeled with amoeba charge distributions . in particular , we examined the average dipole magnitudes for the chloride ion and the nearby waters , and charge transfer from the anion to the waters .",
    "the role of interactions with waters outside the first shell was explored by successively increasing the size of the qm / mm clusters .    in the classical polarizable amoeba simulations ,",
    "anisotropic solvation structures were observed around the chloride ion , consistent with other classical models@xcite and aimd simulations.@xcite the anisotropy decreases with decreasing chloride ion polarizability , but is still significant with the polarizability reduced by a factor of 2 .",
    "the solvation anisotropy is clear from visual inspection of representative configurations , and from examination of the location of the center - of - mass of the inner - shell waters relative to the chloride ion location .",
    "the most probable coordination number observed in the amoeba simulations is 6 based on a standard hydrogen - bonding criterion .",
    "the first - shell water molecule dipoles computed quantum mechanically ( in the external field of surrounding waters ) are slightly reduced relative to the amoeba model , and both exhibit slightly reduced values compared with bulk amoeba water .",
    "this result is somewhat surprising , but is consistent with recent aimd - dft simulations.@xcite reducing the chloride ion polarizability in the amoeba simulations had little effect on the first - shell water dipoles .",
    "we find that water - water interactions within the inner shell and further interactions with more distant waters are all crucial in determining the polarization state of the inner - shell waters .",
    "in fact , the water - water interactions appear to dominate over the ion - water interactions in the polarization.@xcite    the average chloride ion dipole moments computed quantum mechanically are significantly lower than those observed in the amoeba simulations , however .",
    "such behavior has also been found in several aimd simulations,@xcite and it thus appears that the amoeba model , even with thole - type damping incorporated for the nearby electrostatic interactions , is over - polarizing the chloride ion .",
    "since we showed in another study@xcite that the polarization is linked to solvation anisotropy , this finding raises the issue that some of the previous classical polarizable models may be consistently over - estimating solvation anisotropy .",
    "the quantum mechanical ion dipoles were reduced slightly when the configurations were sampled with the lower chloride polarizability , presumably due to the lower anisotropy in the first - shell waters .",
    "the issue of designing damping functions that properly represent the ion dipoles in classical simulations has been addressed by masia.@xcite    in addition , we observe significant charge transfer from the chloride ion to the nearby waters ( 0.2e from the qtaim method ) .",
    "charge transfer has been implicated in a wide range of biophysical solvation problems@xcite and has been previously observed in dft simulations@xcite and quantum chemical studies.@xcite it is possible that the over - polarized ions observed in the amoeba model somehow mimic this charge transfer effect in an average way , but further work is necessary to quantify the relation of the classical models to the more realistic quantum calculations ( the results for the small @xmath5 cases in figure [ fig : dips_n ] suggest that some of the essential physics is missing from the multipole representation , however ) .",
    "since most models used to study the surface affinity of anions to the water liquid - vapor interface have employed no electrostatic damping , or limited versions as in the amoeba model , these issues should be revisited in modeling the specific ion effects . a recent study has confirmed that reduced ion polarization in turn reduces anion surface affinity.@xcite    we have chosen a qm / mm approach with an mp2-level treatment of the inner shell for several reasons .",
    "first , this level of theory should generate relatively accurate charge distributions for analysis of local polarization around the ions.@xcite second , mp2 calculations include many - body dispersion interactions at a decent level of accuracy , and we believe this may be important for modeling ion - water and water - water interactions accurately.@xcite third , we plan to couple this qm / mm approach to computations of solvation free energies via quasi - chemical theory.@xcite in the quasi - chemical approach , the solvation free energy is exactly partitioned into inner - shell , outer - shell packing , and outer - shell long - range contributions .",
    "the conditioning inherent in this partitioning allows for a mean - field treatment of the long - range contribution .",
    "we have observed in another study@xcite that relatively small conditioning radii already lead to gaussian behavior in the long - ranged contribution . with such small conditioning radii , most of the hydration free energy",
    "is contained in the long - ranged part , and that term can then be examined for the various contributions to ion specificity .",
    "we plan to compute the solvation free energies in our mp2-level qm / mm model , and further explore the various contributions to the free energy ( first - order electrostatic , induction , dispersion , charge transfer ) via an sapt energy division.@xcite even though there have been multiple indications that anion polarization is crucial in hydration , it may be possible that , due to the observed charge transfer in quantum models and over - polarization in the classical models , that higher - level quantum mechanical treatments are necessary to accurately represent the local hydration structure and energetics .",
    "computing effective water and ion charges and dipoles can provide helpful insights into the local solvation structure .",
    "these charges and multipoles could then serve as input for the development of more refined molecular dynamics force fields .",
    "an alternative suggestion , however , is that the ion solvation environment involves complicated and diffuse charge distributions best represented with electronic structure methods .",
    "the quasi - chemical treatment of solvation thermodynamics provides a natural statistical mechanical framework for representing the first solvation shell at an accurate quantum mechanical level , with a lower - level representation of more distant waters.@xcite",
