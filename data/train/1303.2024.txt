    "astri (  astrofisica con specchi a tecnologia replicante italiana \" ) is a flagship project of the italian ministry of education , university and research strictly linked to the development of the ambitious cherenkov telescope array ( cta ,  @xcite ) .",
    "cta plans the construction of many tens of telescopes divided in three kinds of configurations , in order to cover the energy range from a tens of gev ( large size telescope , lst ) , to a tens of tev ( medium size telescope , mst ) , and up to 100 tev and beyond ( small size telescope , sst ) . within this framework",
    ", inaf is currently developing an end - to - end prototype of the cta small - size telescope in a dual - mirror configuration ( sst-2 m ) to be tested under field conditions , and scheduled to start data acquisition in 2014 .",
    "for the first time , a wide field of view ( fov = @xmath2 in diameter ) dual - mirror schwarzschild - couder ( sc ,  @xcite ) optical design will be adopted on a cherenkov telescope , in order to obtain a compact ( f - number f/0.5 ) optical configuration and equipped with a light and compact camera based on silicon photo - multipliers with a logical pixel size of 6.2 mm @xmath1 6.2 mm , corresponding to an angular size of @xmath3 ( obtained by means of an optimization process among the commercially - available detectors , the optics performance , and the overall costs of the prototype ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : st2_eew ] ( left panel ) shows the proposed telescope layout , whose mount exploits the classical alt - azimuthal configuration , and which is fully compliant with the cta requirements for the sst array .",
    "the astri sst2 m prototype will be placed at serra la nave , 1735 m a.s.l .",
    "on the etna mountain near catania , at the inaf  m.g .",
    "fracastoro \" observing station , and will begin data acquisition in 2014 ( @xcite ) .",
    "the proposed layout  ( @xcite ) is fully compliant with the cta requirements for the sst array .",
    "moreover , our design has been optimized in order to ensure a light concentration higher than 80% within the dimension of the pixels over the entire field of view ( figure  [ fig : st2_eew ] , right panel ) and taking into account the segmentation of the primary mirror ( m1 ) and the dimension and position of the camera .",
    "the telescope design is compact having a 4.3m - diameter m1 , a 1.8m - diameter secondary mirror ( m2 ) and a primary - to - secondary distance of 3 m .",
    "the sc optical design has an f - number f/0.5 , a plate scale of 37.5mm/@xmath0 , a logical pixel size of approximately @xmath3 and an equivalent focal length of 2150 mm . considering 1984 pixels ,",
    "this setup delivers a fov of @xmath2 in diameter and a mean value of the active area of about 6.5m@xmath4 , taking into account : the segmentation of m1 , the obscuration of m2 , the obscuration of the camera , the reflectivity of the optical surfaces as a function of the wavelength and incident angle , the losses due to the camera s protection window and the efficiency of the silicon detectors as function of the incident angles ( ranging from @xmath5 to @xmath6 ) .",
    "the primary mirror m1 is segmented into 18 tiles ; the central one is not used because completely obstructed by the secondary mirror m2 .",
    "the segmentation requires three types of segments having different surface profiles .",
    "figure  [ fig : mir ] shows an image of a prototype of one m1 mirror segment manufactured with the glass cold - shaping technology .",
    "the segments have hexagonal shape with an aperture of 849 mm face - to - face .",
    "each segment will be equipped with two actuators plus one fixed point for alignment .",
    "only tilt misplacements will be corrected .",
    "the secondary mirror is monolithic , and has a radius of curvature of 2200 mm and diameter of 1800 mm .",
    "m2 will be equipped with three actuators .",
    "the third actuator also makes the piston / focus adjustment for the entire optical system available .",
    "the optical design will be implemented by means of a telescope structure composed of primary and secondary mirrors cells , a pillar and counterweights , the drives systems and a focal surface interface .",
    "the telescope mount exploits the classical alt - azimuthal configuration ( see figure  [ fig : st2_eew ] , left panel ) .",
    "the sc optical configuration allows us to design a compact and light camera .",
    "currently , the astri camera has a dimension of about 500mm@xmath1500mm@xmath1500 mm , including the mechanics and the interface with the telescope structure , for a total weight of about 50 kg ( see figure  [ fig : cam_eps ] for a camera system breakdown ) .        such small detection surface , in turn , requires a spatial segmentation of a few square millimeters to be compliant with the imaging resolving angular size . among the available light sensors that offer photon detection sensitivity in the 300700 nm band , a fast temporal response and a suitable pixel size , we selected the hamamatsu silicon photomultiplier ( sipm ) s11828 - 3344 m  ( @xcite ) . in order to cover the full 9.6@xmath7 fov",
    ", we used a modular approach , as shown in figure  [ fig : cam_ps ] .",
    "we call _ unit _ the physical aggregation ( imposed by the manufacturer ) of 4@xmath14 pixels ( 3mm@xmath13 mm each pixel )",
    ". the logical aggregation of 2@xmath12 pixels is called _ logical pixel _ , which turns out to be of 6.2mm@xmath16.2 mm ( 0.17@xmath0 ) , while the _ photon detection module _ ( pdm ) is composed of @xmath8 units .",
    "the astri focal surface , covering the whole fov , requires 37 pdms .",
    "the advantage of this design is that each pdm is physically independent of the others , allowing maintenance of small portions of the camera .",
    "to fit the curvature of the focal surface , each pdm is appropriately tilted with respect to the optical axis .",
    "figure  [ fig : eve ] shows an on - axis simulated event for a primary gamma - ray with e=10tev , a core distance of 142.77 m and including a night - sky background of @xmath9phm@xmath10s@xmath11sr@xmath11 , ( about 3p.e.pixel@xmath11 ) .",
    "the color - bar shows the number of photo - electrons ( p.e . ) in each pixel .     for details .",
    "]      although astri sst2 m will mainly be a technological prototype , it will perform scientific observations on the crab nebula , mrk  421 , and mrk  501 .",
    "preliminary calculations  ( @xcite ) show that in the maximum sensitivity range ( @xmath12 tev ) we can detect a flux level of 1  crab at 5@xmath13 in a few hours , while in the energy range @xmath14tev a flux level of 1  crab at 5@xmath13 can be reached in a few tens of hours .",
    "figure  [ fig:1ts ] shows a comparison among the expected astri prototype sensitivity as a function of the energy ( yellow stars , computed at 5@xmath13 and 50hr of observation ) and those of a few image atmospheric cherenkov telescope ( iact ) ones ( whipple , magic , h.e.s.s . ,",
    "cta ) and of large field of view detectors for one - year integration ( fermi - lat )     and 50hr of observation ) . adapted from  @xcite and reference therein . ]    because of their strong flux and spectral variations in the two markarian sources , estimates of exposures are more uncertain . in case of large flares , with fluxes up to 510 crab units , detection could be reached on a much shorter time - scale  ( @xcite ) , allowing intra - night variability studies .",
    "a remarkable improvement in terms of performance could come from the operation , in 2016 , of a mini - array , composed by a few sst-2 m telescopes and to be placed at final cta southern site .",
    "preliminary monte carlo simulations ( @xcite ) yield an improvement in sensitivity that for 7 telescopes could be a factor 1.5 at 10tev w.r.t .",
    "h.e.s.s . , as shown in figure  [ fig : ar1 ]",
    ". the astri sst2 m mini - array will be able to study in great detail relatively bright ( a few @xmath15ergcm@xmath10s@xmath11 at 10  tev ) sources with an angular resolution of a few arcmin and an energy resolution of about 1015% .",
    "the astri sst2 m mini - array sensitivity were calculated taking into account 5 energy bins per decade , a 5@xmath13 significance , a number of event / energy - bin @xmath14 , a signal rate @xmath17% w.r.t .",
    "the background rate , an integration time of 50hr , a minimum number of images used in the event reconstruction of 3 and 5 , respectively , and for an array configuration as shown in figure  [ fig : ar2 ] .     and 50hr of observation ) , compared with h.e.s.s . and cta ones ( see section  [ sect : miniarray ] for details ) . from  @xcite . ]",
    "moreover , thanks to the array approach , it will be possible to verify the wide fov performance to detect very high energy showers with the core located at a distance up to 500 m , to compare the mini - array performance with the monte carlo expectations by means of deep observations of few selected targets , and to perform the first cta science , with its first solid detections during the first year of operation .     for details ) . from  @xcite . ]",
    "prominent sources such as extreme blazars ( 1es  0229@xmath18200 ) , nearby well - known bl  lac objects ( mkn  501 ) and radio - galaxies , galactic pulsar wind nebulae ( crab nebula , vela - x ) , supernovae remnants ( vela - junior , rx  j1713.7@xmath193946 ) and microquasars ( ls  5039 ) , as well as the galactic center can be observed in a previously unexplored energy range , in order to investigate the electron acceleration and cooling , relativistic and non relativistic shocks , the search for cosmic - ray ( cr ) pevatrons , the study of the cr propagation , and the impact of the extragalactic background light on the spectra of the sources .        the large field of view of the astri mini - array will allow us to monitor , during a single pointing , a few tev sources simultaneously .",
    "figure  [ fig : fov ] shows the current tev sources as listed in the tevcat compilation .",
    "red , green and cyan circles represent the @xmath2 ( optical ) field of view diameter for three possible pointings along the galactic plane .",
    "the grey line represents the celestial equator .",
    "although the actual sensitivity will substantially drop for off - axis sources , a few targets can be monitored simultaneously , as shown in the three panels on the left .",
    "simultaneous detection of hard and intense galactic sources could be feasible , e.g. in the case of vela  x and vela  jr .",
    "several scientific cases can be addressed by the astri mini - array .",
    "for the first time , the energy range above a few tens of tev can be explored with an improved sensitivity compared to the current iacts . the nearby and powerful pulsar wind nebula ( pwn ) vela - x is a typical source which can be considered as a primary target for the astri mini - array .",
    "figure  [ fig : vex ] shows its spectral energy distribution ( sed ) , as reported in  @xcite , where a clear peak is visible in the h.e.s.s . data ( ) at about 10  tev , and a cut - off at about 70  tev , making the astri mini - array crucial to explore this portion of the sed .",
    "supernova remnants ( snr ) are typical galactic tev emitters .",
    "rx  j1713.7@xmath193946 is a young shell - like snr which could be considered as an excellent laboratory to investigate the cosmic ray acceleration ( see   and  ) .",
    "see  @xcite for details . ]",
    "the recent detection of this snr by _ fermi _ ( @xcite ) and the combined study with h.e.s.s .",
    "( see figure  [ fig:171 ] ) , show that the high - energy and very high - energy ( vhe ) emission could be interpreted in the framework of a leptonic scenario .",
    "nevertheless , the good energy resolution of the astri mini - array above 10  tev and its improved sensitivity beyond a few tens of tev , will improve our knowledge on the main emission mechanism acting in this source in the gev and tev energy bands .",
    "the astri mini - array will be extremely important to investigate the vhe emission from extragalactic sources as well .",
    "figure  [ fig:022 ] shows the sed of the extreme blazar 1es  0229@xmath18200 ( @xcite ) .",
    "200 ( see  @xcite for details ) . ]    a clear detection of vhe emission above a few tens of tev from such a blazar could provide fundamental information on the long - standing debate on the emission mechanisms in this energy band .",
    "in particular , since the cosmic - ray - induced cascade displays a significantly harder spectrum above 1020 tev , a detection above @xmath20tev would be only compatible with an hadronic origin of the gamma - rays ( @xcite ) .",
    "the astri sst2 m end - to - end prototype will be installed and operated during spring 2014 at the inaf observing station in serra la nave , sicily .",
    "the astri prototype performance will provide crucial information on several topics , such as the dual - mirror schwarzschild - couder optical design , the sipm - based focal surface and the software / data - handling architecture , all of them innovative with respect to the current iact design .",
    "moreover , the prototype site will allow us to obtain a direct measurement of prominent gamma - ray sources , such as the crab nebula , mrk  421 and mrk  501 .",
    "the planned astri mini - array , operated starting from 2016 , will constitute the first _ seed _ of the future cta project , and will be open to the cta consortium for both technological and scientific exploitation .",
    "this work was partially supported by the astri flagship project financed by the italian ministry of education , university , and research ( miur ) and lead by the italian national institute of astrophysics ( inaf ) ."
