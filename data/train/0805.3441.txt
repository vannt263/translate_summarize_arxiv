    "the main idea in the framework of the clustering of color sources is the fact that elementary color sources -strings- can overlap forming clusters , so the number of effective sources is modified .",
    "the procedure is the following : in each collision , color strings are stretched between the colliding partons .",
    "those strings act as color sources of particles which are successively broken by creation of @xmath1 pairs from the sea .",
    "the color strings correspond to small areas in the transverse space filled with the color field created by the colliding partons .",
    "if the density of strings increases , they overlap in the transverse space , giving rise to a phenomenon of string fusion and percolation @xcite .",
    "percolation indicates that the cluster size diverges , reaching the size of the system .",
    "thus , variations of the initial state can lead to a transition from disconnected to connected color clusters .",
    "the percolation point signals the onset of color deconfinement .",
    "these clusters decay into particles with mean transverse momentum and mean multiplicity that depend on the number of elementary sources that conform each cluster , and the area occupied by the cluster . for a cluster of @xmath2 overlapping strings ,",
    "the vectorial sum of the color charges of the individual strings leads to the following values for the total color charge , the mean multiplicity and the mean transverse momentum : @xmath3 moreover , it is possible to obtain the following analytic expression that relates the areas with the density of strings @xmath4 : = .",
    "the clustering reduces the average multiplicity and enhances the average @xmath5 of an event in a factor @xmath6 with respect to those resulting from pure superposition of strings : @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the number of strings and @xmath9 is a function of the density of strings @xmath4 .    the invariant cross section can be written as a superposition of the transverse momentum distributions of each cluster , @xmath10 schwinger formula for the decay of a cluster , weighted by the distribution of the different tensions of the clusters , @xmath11 .",
    "this weight function behaves as a gamma function whose width is proportional to @xmath12 where @xmath13 is a determined function of @xmath4 related to the measured dynamical transverse momentum and multiplicity fluctuations @xcite : @xmath14    for ( anti)baryons the equation ( [ average ] ) must be changed to @xmath15 to take into account the fact that baryons are enhanced over mesons in the fragmentation of a high density cluster @xcite .",
    "the parameter @xmath160.09 is fixed from the experimental dependence of @xmath17 on @xmath18 .",
    "the ( anti)baryons probe higher densities than mesons , @xmath19 . on the other hand , from the constituent counting rules applied to the high @xmath20 behavior we deduce that for baryons @xmath21 . in fig . 1",
    ", we show the ratios @xmath22 and @xmath23 compared to rhic experimental data for pions and antiprotons together with the lhc predictions . in fig .",
    "2 ( left ) we show the nuclear modification factor @xmath24 for pions and protons for central collisions at rhic .",
    "lhc predictions are also shown .",
    "we note that @xmath25 collisions at lhc energies will reach enough string density for nuclear like effects to occur . because of this , in fig .",
    "2 ( right ) we show the ratio @xmath22 for @xmath26 as a function of @xmath20 , where the denominator is given by the minimum bias inclusive cross section and the numerator is the inclusive cross section corresponding to events with twice the multiplicity of the minimum bias one . according to our formula ( [ spectra ] ) a suppression at large @xmath20 occurs .",
    "non - statistical event - by - event fluctuations in relativistic heavy ion collisions have been proposed as a probe of phase instabilities near de qcd phase transition .",
    "these fluctuations show a non - monotonic behavior with the centrality of the collision : they grow as the centrality increases , showing a maximum at mid centralities , followed by a decrease at larger centralities .",
    "different mechanisms have been proposed in order to explain those data . in the string clustering approach ,",
    "the behavior of the @xmath0 @xcite and multiplicity @xcite fluctuations can be understood as follows : at low density , most of the particles are produced by individual strings with the same transverse momentum @xmath27 and the same multiplicity @xmath28 , so fluctuations are small . at large density , above the critical point of percolation , we have only one cluster , so fluctuations are not expected either . just below the percolation critical density",
    ", we have a large number of clusters formed by different number of strings @xmath2 , with different size and thus different @xmath29 and different @xmath30 so the fluctuations are maximal .    the variables to measure event - by - event @xmath0 fluctuations are @xmath31 and @xmath32 , that quantify the deviation of the observed fluctuations from statistically independent particle emission :",
    "= -  , where @xmath33 is defined for each particle and @xmath34 is defined for each event , and f_p_t = ,  =  . moreover , in order to measure the multiplicity fluctuations , the variance of the multiplicity distribution scaled to the mean value of the multiplicity has been used . its behavior is similar to the one obtained for @xmath35 , used to quantify the @xmath0-fluctuations , suggesting that they are related to each other .",
    "the @xmath36-measure is independent of the distribution of number of particle sources if the sources are identical and independent from each other .",
    "that is , @xmath36 should be independent of the impact parameter if the nucleus - nucleus collision is a simple superposition of nucleon - nucleon interactions .          in fig .",
    "3 we present our results on @xmath0 fluctuations at lhc .",
    "note that the increase of the energy essentially shifts the maximum position to a lower number of participants @xcite . in fig .",
    "4 we show our values for the scaled variance of negatively charged particles at sps , rhic and lhc energies .",
