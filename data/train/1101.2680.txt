    "<S> we report on the aperiodic x - ray timing and color behavior of the accreting millisecond x - ray pulsar ( amxp ) igr j175113057 , using all the pointed observations obtained with the _ rossi x - ray timing explorer _ </S>",
    "<S> proportional counter array since the source s discovery on 2009 september 12 . </S>",
    "<S> the source can be classified as an atoll source on the basis of the color and timing characteristics . </S>",
    "<S> it was in the hard state during the entire outburst . in the beginning and </S>",
    "<S> at the end of the outburst , the source exhibited what appear to be twin khz quasi periodic oscillations ( qpos ) . </S>",
    "<S> the separation @xmath0 between the twin qpos is @xmath1 120 hz . contrary to expectations for slow rotators , instead of being close to the 244.8 hz spin frequency , it is close to half the spin frequency . however , </S>",
    "<S> identification of the qpos is not certain as the source does not fit perfectly in the existing scheme of correlations of aperiodic variability frequencies seen in neutron star low mass x - ray binaries ( ns lmxbs ) , nor can a single shift factor make it fit as has been reported for other amxps . </S>",
    "<S> these results indicate that igr j17511 - 3057 is a unique source differing from other amxps and could play a key role in advancing our understanding of not only amxps , but also ns lmxbs in general . </S>"
