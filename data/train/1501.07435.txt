    "one has a strong natural suppression of the most dangerous fcnc , with , for example , the strangeness changing neutral currents , proportional to @xmath10 , which implies a very strong natural suppression of the contribution to the @xmath11 transition . with this suppression ,",
    "the neutral higgs masses need not be too large .",
    "bgl models have been extended to the leptonic sector @xcite , their relation to minimal flavour violation models has been studied @xcite and their phenomenological implications have been recently analysed @xcite .    in this paper",

    "there is up - down misalignment .",

    ", we propose a symmetry which leads to up - down alignment in the quark sector and when extended to a 2hdm leads to a natural alignment of the two higgs doublets in flavour space .",
    "we introduce the following @xmath88 symmetry under which the quark left - handed doublets @xmath89 , the right - handed up quarks @xmath90 , and the right - handed down quarks @xmath91 transform in the following way : @xmath92 where @xmath93 corresponds to @xmath94 and @xmath95 to @xmath96 with : @xmath97 and @xmath98 .",

    "this breaking will also lead to higgs mediated fcnc , but these couplings will be suppressed by the smallness of the quark masses . in order to illustrate how a realistic pattern of quark masses and mixing can be obtained , we shall assume that the breaking of the @xmath88 symmetry occurs in two steps .",

    "<S> in the context of two higgs doublet models , we study the conditions required in order to have stable quasi - alignment in flavour space . </S>",
    "<S> we show that stability under the rge imposes strong constraints on the flavour structure of the yukawa couplings associated to each one of the higgs doublets . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we find a novel solution , where all yukawa couplings are proportional to the so - called democratic matrix . </S>",
    "<S> this solution is rather unique , since it is the only stable solution which is a good starting point for reproducing the observed pattern of quark masses and mixing . </S>",
    "<S> we also show that this stable solution can be obtained by imposing on the lagrangian a @xmath0 flavour symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> quark masses of the lighter quark generations are generated through the breaking of this discrete symmetry , and , at this stage , scalar mediated fcnc arise , but are naturally suppressed by the smallness of light quark masses . in this way , we relate higgs alignment to the hierarchy of quark masses through a discrete family symmetry .    </S>",
