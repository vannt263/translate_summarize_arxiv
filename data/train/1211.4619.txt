    "highway traffic estimation and prediction are of pivotal importance for traffic operation and management . from an estimation perspective",
    ", it is desirable to have a substantial amount of information available .",
    "this has been made possible by emerging technology in fixed and mobile sensing and by the advancement of cyber - physical infrastructure , see @xcite for a specific discussion . depending on the characteristics of sensing devices and the underlying modeling framework , traffic sensing can be categorized as eulerian sensing ( such as using loop detector , virtual tripwire , and video camera ) and lagrangian sensing ( such as using gps and smart phone ) .",
    "this paper is concerned with using the lighthill - whitham - richards model to estimate traffic states , subject to constraints imposed by sensing data that are large in quantity , and high in dimension .",
    "the lwr model is described by a _ partial differential equation _ ( pde ) , more specifically , by a _",
    "scalar conservation law _",
    "( scl ) . for general mathematical background on scl ,",
    "the reader is referred to @xcite .",
    "the lwr scl is closely related to a hamilton - jacobi equation , via the moskowitz function @xcite , also known as the newell curve @xcite .",
    "it is shown in @xcite that a weak entropy solution to the lwr scl leads to the viscosity solution of the corresponding h - j equation ; and vise versa .      from a pde perspective ,",
    "additional information on the traffic stream provided by sensors imposes multiple initial / boundary and/or internal boundary conditions that may lead to non - existence of a well - defined solution , namely , entropy solution to the scalar conservation law ; or viscosity solution to the h - j equation .",
    "recently , @xcite extended the viscosity solution of h - j equations to a solution class known as the barron - jensen / frankowska solutions @xcite .",
    "the generalized solution , called viability episolution @xcite , is lower semi - continuous , and satisfies the initial / boundary and/or internal boundary conditions in an inequality sense . such a relaxation , while excluding some nice mathematical properties of the solution , does allow the pde to incorporate multiple value conditions and produce solutions that are well - informed of traffic states transmitted by the sensors . based on this idea ,",
    "a sequence of seminal papers , @xcite were created , which performed highway traffic estimation as well as data assimilation and inverse modeling .",
    "the lwr model is commonly formulated as a scalar conservation law in _",
    "eulerian coordinate _ ( ec ) , i.e. with independent variables @xmath0 ( time ) and @xmath1 ( location ) .",
    "a list of selected references in this line of research includes @xcite .",
    "another way of formulating the traffic dynamic is through _ lagrangian coordinate _ ( lc ) , which identifies @xmath0 ( time ) and @xmath2 ( vehicle label ) .",
    "in contrast to ec , lc describes time evolution of traffic quantities associated with a moving vehicle .",
    "such a framework was initially introduced by @xcite in the context of gas dynamics .",
    "lc was introduced to traffic flow modeling by @xcite , and subsequently studied by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "a more detailed review of the lwr model in both ec and lc is presented later in section [ lwrel ] .",
    "the lwr pde in lc can be derived from the eulerian - based pde ; and vise versa .",
    "this procedure was given an intuitive illustration in @xcite , provided that all quantities of interest were continuously differentiable .",
    "in @xcite , the authors related the equivalence of ec- and lc - based pdes to an earlier work @xcite on gas dynamics .",
    "however , we point out that @xcite studied an euler equation , which is a system of conservation laws ; results regarding such a system do not apply immediately to the scalar conservation law of interest . in this paper",
    ", we provide a rigorous proof of the equivalence between the two systems , in the context of hamilton - jacobi equation and viscosity solutions .",
    "the result will apply to the lwr conservation laws even if the solutions are not continuous , let alone differentiable .",
    "technical result is presented in section [ lcequivalence ] .    as mentioned before , solution to the h - j equation",
    "has been extended to treat multiple value conditions , using viability theory @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we apply the framework of viability theory to the lagrangian - based hamilton - jacobi equations .",
    "the goal is to explore the unique modeling and computational advantages of the lc in highway traffic estimation .",
    "in particular , using the lax - hopf formula , we derive explicit solutions to the lc - based h - j equation with various value conditions including initial / intermediate condition , upstream / downstream boundary condition , internal boundary condition , and a combination of the above .",
    "this is presented in section [ simplesol ] . as pointed out by recent studies @xcite and @xcite , lc - based conservation law has certain computational advantage over ec - based ones , in the context of godunov scheme @xcite .",
    "namely , the godunov scheme reduces to an upwind scheme for lc - based conservation law , since the corresponding fundamental diagram is monotonically increasing .",
    "as we show in this paper , when solved with the lax - hopf formula , the lc - based h - j equation also reduces the computational complexity , compared with the ec - based h - j equation . finally , we test the framework of lagrangian - based traffic sensing and estimation with dataset obtained from the mobile century field experiment @xcite .",
    "the lagrangian - based approach provides traffic information associated with each moving vehicle , such as trajectory and speed .",
    "such information are relatively difficult to obtain from the eulerian - based approach : one has to perform partial inversion of the moskowitz function .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in section [ lwrel ] ,",
    "we briefly review the lighthill - whitham - richards model in both eulerian and lagrangian coordinates . a rigorous equivalence result regarding the ec - based and lc - based h - j equations",
    "is presented in section [ lcequivalence ] .",
