    "prior to these observations , the intergalactic magnetic field was observationally only limited to be smaller than a few ng . ]",
    "a leading possible explanation is that these large - scale magnetic fields are the amplified remnants of a primordial seed magnetic field generated in the early universe @xcite .",
    "such early magnetogenesis models include those in which seed magnetic field generation occurs during inflation or shortly thereafter , or during a cosmological phase transition ( such as the electroweak or qcd transition ) .",
    "clearly the strength of the seed magnetic field should be small enough so as to not generate a larger than observed cosmological anisotropy .",
    "magnetic field energy density contributes to the relativistic ( radiation ) energy density and thus another requirement is that it not exceed the big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) bound on the radiation energy density .",
    "there are two main questions that need to be answered : ( l ) are the amplitude and statistical properties of any of these seed magnetic fields such that , after amplification by a realistic model , they can explain the strengths and correlation lengths of the observed magnetic fields in large - scale structures ( lsss ) such as galaxies ? and , ( 2 ) are any of the seed magnetic fields detectable through cosmological observations , such as cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) measurements or lss observations ? and , if yes , what are the observational constraints on such primordial magnetic fields ?    in this paper",
    "we focus on the second question and consider two cosmological consequences of a primordial magnetic field , faraday rotation of the cmb polarization plane and the effect on lss formation . as two of the effects of a primordial magnetic field ,",
    "these have been widely discussed in the literature .",
    "see refs.@xcite for discussions of magnetic field induced cmb anisotropies , refs .",
    "@xcite for the faraday rotation effect , and refs.@xcite for effects of a primordial magnetic field on lss formation .",
    "it has become conventional to derive the cosmological effects of a seed magnetic field by using a magnetic field spectral shape ( parametrized by the spectral index @xmath1 ) and the smoothed value of the magnetic field ( @xmath2 ) at a given scale @xmath3 ( which is usually taken to be 1 mpc ) .",
    "we develop here a different and more correct formalism based on the effective magnetic field value that is determined by the total energy density of the magnetic field . as a striking consequence ,",
    "we show that even an extremely small smoothed magnetic field of @xmath4 g at 1 mpc , with the batchelor spectral shape ( @xmath5 ) at large scales , can leave detectable signatures in cmb or lss statistics .",
    "we also show that the conventional approach based on the smoothed magnetic field results in some confusion when considering phase - transition generated magnetic fields @xcite with spectral shape sharper ( on large scales ) than the white noise spectrum ( i.e.with @xmath6 ) . in this case",
    "the total energy density of the magnetic field , @xmath7 , is mainly concentrated on large wavenumbers ( small length scales ) . in what follows",
    "we show that primordial magnetic field effects on cosmological scales are determined not by the amplitude of the magnetic field on these scales , but rather by the total energy density of the magnetic field .    here",
    "we consider limits on a seed magnetic field from the observational constraint on the cmb polarization plane rotation angle and observational constraints on the formation of the first bound structures .",
    "both tests give comparable limits on the effective magnetic field , ranging from @xmath8 g to @xmath9 g , depending on the spectral shape of the magnetic field .",
    "note that these limits are of order of the bbn bound .",
    "the best limit on the seed magnetic field is for the scale - invariant case that can be generated during inflation @xcite .    in a universe with",
    "only scalar mode perturbations the cmb @xmath10-polarization signal vanishes . the cmb @xmath10 polarization signal can arise from vector or tensor perturbations , and thus @xmath10-polarization detection based tests are powerful tools for probing non - standard cosmological models and the relic gravitational wave background . since a cosmological magnetic field can source a cmb @xmath10-polarization signal , a crucial test to limit the magnetic field is based on cmb @xmath10-polarization measurements . in a separate paper",

    "it has been shown that the dissipation of magnetic fields in the post - recombination era can substantially alter the thermal and ionization history of the universe @xcite .",

    ", we neglect the impact of the @xmath91cdm model on the process of reionization .",
    "as the density fields induced by the @xmath91cdm model and the magnetic field are uncorrelated , the matter power spectra owing to these two physical phenomena would add in quadrature .",
    "the smallest structures to collapse at @xmath87 in the wmap - normalized @xmath91cdm model are 2.5@xmath92 fluctuations of the density field as opposed to the magnetic field case where 1@xmath92 collapse is possible ( fig .  3 ) .",
    "this means the number of collapsed halos is more abundant in the latter case .",
    "therefore , depending on the star - formation history , if the magnetic - field - induced halo collapse made an important contribution to the reionization process , the far rarer halos from @xmath91cdm would have made a negligible impact ( for further details and references see ref .",

    "we derive the corresponding limits on a primordial magnetic field energy density , expressed as limits on the effective value of the magnetic field , @xmath27 .",

    "the difference between @xmath114 and @xmath27 is enormous ( greater than @xmath115 ) .",
    "we show that using the smoothed magnetic field can result in some confusion ; e.g.  an extremely small smoothed magnetic field on large scales does not mean that this field can not leave observable traces on cosmological scales .",
