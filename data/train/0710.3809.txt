    "the evolution between the end of the asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) and the planetary nebula ( pn ) phases has for a long time been a poorly understood link in the late stages of intermediate - mass stars ( 1  8 m@xmath5 ) .",
    "it is in this transition phase where the fast stellar wind of the emerging pn interacts with the slow wind from its precursor agb star ( kwok , purton , & fitzgerald 1978 ) , shaping the final morphology of the pn .",
    "other ingredients that can contribute to the final shape of a pn are the presence of interacting binary stars ( e.g. morris 1987 ; balick & frank 2002 ; soker & bisker 2006 ) or magnetic fields ( e.g. garca - segura & lpez 2000 ; blackman et al . 2001 ; garca - segura , lpez & franco 2005 ) .",
    "thus , the study of objects in this transition phase can give us important clues about the physical mechanisms responsible for the different morphologies observed in pne .",
    "k 3 - 35 is a very young pn with a characteristic s - shaped emission morphology that suggests the presence of precessing bipolar jets ( aaquist & kwok 1989 ; aaquist 1993 ; miranda et al . 2000 ; 2001 ) .",
    "the detection of oh and h@xmath6o maser emission as well as the presence of co and hco@xmath7 emission suggest that k  3 - 35 departed from the proto - pn phase only a few decades ago ( miranda et al .",
    "2001 ; tafoya et al .",
    "2007 ) .",
    "miranda et al . ( 2001 ) estimate a dynamical age of @xmath8 15 years for the ionised inner core , which expands at @xmath925 km  s@xmath10 . for the jets , assuming a modest jet velocity of @xmath9100 km  s@xmath10 , an age of @xmath9800 years is obtained .",
    "therefore , the jet formation in k  3 - 35 occurred during the proto - pn phase . in this paper",
    "we show that the radio morphology of k 3 - 35 can be explained by a precessing jet model .",
    "frame corresponds to the computational domain .",
    "the physical system is given by the @xmath11  frame , which is obtained by rotating the @xmath12-plane around @xmath13-axis by 36with respect to the plane of the sky ( @xmath14-plane ) . ]",
    "the pn k 3 - 35 belongs to the point - symmetric pn group because it shows a bipolar structure , with an ` s ' shaped morphology in radio - continuum maps at 8.3  ghz @xcite .",
    "this kind of morphology is more often observed in galactic and extragalactic jets .",
    "several theoretical studies have employed precessing jets for modelling these objects and explaining the ` s ' shape observed at different frequencies .",
    "for instance , in the galactic case , @xcite carried out 3d numerical simulations of the hh  34 jets , and compared jet models with and without precession . in the field of extragalactic jets",
    ", @xcite made a 3d hydrodynamical simulation of a precessing jet moving into an intragalactic cluster medium , and compared their results with the abell 1795 galaxy cluster .",
    "the similarity between these jets and point - symmetric pne has recently motivated models of this type of pne as jets , considering precession , density and/or variable ejection velocity , etc .",
    ", in order to explain their kinematics , emission , and morphology .",
    "an excellent review of these works is given by @xcite .",
    "as an example , we can mention the observational study of the proto - planetary nebula ( ppn ) hen 3 - 1475 by @xcite . in h@xmath15 , [ nii ] , and [ oiii ]",
    "images , this ppn exhibits several knots forming an ` s ' shape .",
    "also @xcite made radial velocity and proper motion studies , showing that the knotty structure of hen 3 - 1475 can be explained by means of a jet with a variable ejection velocity and precession .",
    "based on these hypotheses , @xcite have computed 2d ( axisymmetric ) and 3d hydrodynamical simulations of such a jet , showing that this model can reproduce both the observed morphology and the kinematical characteristics of the outflows of hen 3 - 1475 .    in the present paper ,",
    "we model the pn k 3 - 35 with 3d numerical simulations of a precessing jet . due to the fact that the bipolar structure of k 3 - 35 looks almost continuous ,",
    "we do not find necessary to consider also a time variability for the jet velocity and/or density .    in pne , the surrounding circumstellar medium ( csm )",
    "is strongly modified by the central star , which injects material and increases the density of the csm .",
    "based on the work of @xcite , this perturbed csm can be described by :    @xmath16 ( r_0/r)^{2}\\ , , \\label{agb}\\ ] ]    where @xmath17 is the distance from the jet source on a 3d cartesian frame .",
    "the angle @xmath18 is measured with respect to the equator , which we have chosen to coincide with the @xmath19-plane , yielding @xmath20 .",
    "[ agb ] describes the stratification of the surrounding csm produced by a star in agb phase .",
    "the parameter @xmath21 in eq .",
    "[ agb ] is related to the ratio of the density at the equator ( @xmath19-plane ) and at the pole ( @xmath22-axis ) , and @xmath23 determines how the density varies from the equator to the pole @xcite .",
    "the value of @xmath24 is calculated from the mass loss rate as  : @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the expansion velocity of the agb remnant .",
    "these maps were obtained integrating the density along the @xmath13-axis . at t=40  yr , the jet achieves an extension of @xmath27  cm , which is equivalent to 2.4 , i.  e. , the angular extension of bipolar structure of pn k 3 - 35 ( for an assumed distance of 5 kpc ) .",
    "both axes are labelled in units of @xmath28  cm , and the bar on the right represents the logarithmic gray - scale , given in units of @xmath29 . ]",
    "the numerical simulations were carried out employing the 3d adaptive grid code yguaz - a @xcite . together with the gas - dynamic equations , several rate equations for atomic / ionic species ( h i - ii , he i - iii , c ii - iv , and o i - iv ) are integrated in order to calculate a non - equilibrium ionisation cooling function for the gas ( for temperatures above @xmath30  k the cooling rate is approximated by an equilibrium ionisation parameterised function ) .",
    "the gas - dynamic equations are integrated with the `` flux - vector splitting '' algorithm of @xcite .",
    "details of the reaction and cooling rates included in the code are described in the appendix of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the simulations were performed in a five level , binary adaptive grid , with a maximum resolution of @xmath31  cm ( along the three axes ) .",
    "the computational domain had an extent of @xmath32  cm in the @xmath13- and @xmath33-directions , and of @xmath34  cm in the @xmath22-direction .",
    "both the cone precession axis and the csm density distribution were rotated around the @xmath13-axis , by 36with respect to the plane of the sky ( @xmath12-plane , see fig.[fcroquis ] ) .",
    "this inclination angle was found by @xcite , who modelled the h@xmath6o maser emission of the accretion disk around the k 3 - 35 central star .",
    "the configuration is shown in fig .",
    "[ fcroquis ] .",
    "the jet is placed at the centre of the computational domain with an initial radius @xmath35  cm ( equivalent to 30 pixels at the maximum grid resolution ) and a length @xmath36  cm .",
    "initially ( integration time @xmath37  yr ) , the jet axis lying on the @xmath38-plane and starts to move ( counterclockwise ) into a precession cone , with a semi - opening angle @xmath39 . at @xmath37",
    "yr , the jet velocity components are @xmath40 , in the @xmath11  frame ( see fig . [ fcroquis ] ) , or @xmath41 , in the @xmath42  frame ( the computational domain frame ) .",
    "after several tests , a precession period of @xmath43  yr was chosen .",
    "two runs were computed considering that the jet material is injected as singly ionised or neutral gas .",
    "k  3 - 35 has a bright centre when it is observed at radiofrequencies , because the central source strongly ionises the csm gas .",
    "this process is not taken into account in our simulations .",
    "since we continuously impose the jet inflow conditions within a cylindrical volume ( see  2 ) , when we calculate synthetic radio - continuum maps we obtain a strong central emission component ( coming from this cylinder ) for the initially ionised jet simulation , giving a good morphological agreement with the observations .",
    "however , this central component in the simulated radio emission is exclusively a result of the chosen jet inflow conditions , and for this reason only synthetic maps obtained for the run with the `` neutral jet '' will be employed for calculating total fluxes .",
    "a good fit with the observations is obtained when the velocity and mass loss rate of the jet were set to @xmath44 and @xmath45 , respectively .",
    "these parameters let an equivalent density @xmath46 of @xmath47 .",
    "the neutral csm is modelled by eq.[agb ] , with a mass lose rate @xmath48 , @xmath49 , and the parameters @xmath21 and @xmath23 , were set to 0.1 and 3 , respectively .",
    "these parameters give an almost isotropic density distribution with a contrast of 20% between the density at the equator and the poles . from this relationship , densities between @xmath50 and @xmath51",
    "are obtained for distances from the source of @xmath52  cm and @xmath28  cm along the @xmath53 direction , respectively .",
    "these high densities are supported by the recent detection of hco@xmath7 toward k  3 - 35 , that reveals the presence of high density molecular gas @xcite .",
    "taking into account the csm density distribution , and the jet density and velocity , it is possible to estimate the speed of the leading ` working surface ' ( i.  e. the head ) of the jet  :    @xmath54    where @xmath55 is the jet injection velocity , and @xmath56 and @xmath57 are the jet and csm densities , respectively .",
    "it is straightforward to show from eqs .",
    "( [ vws ] ) and ( [ agb ] ) that for large distances @xmath58 from the jet source , @xmath59 increases .",
    "for instance , considering the values for @xmath55 , @xmath56 , and @xmath57 , speeds of @xmath60 and @xmath61 , are found at @xmath62  cm and @xmath63  cm , respectively .",

    "both spatial axis are in units of @xmath28  cm .",
    "strong emission is observed in the centre due to the fact that this is the region where a singly ionised jet inflow condition is continuously imposed . ]    to generate synthetic thermal radio - continuum maps , the radiative transfer equation was integrated along different lines of sight .",
    "first , the optical depth @xmath64 was calculated by integrating the absorption coefficient @xmath65 along lines of sight  : @xmath66 ( with @xmath67 being the spatial coordinate along the line of sight ) .",
    "the absorption coefficient @xmath65 is given by @xcite :    @xmath68    where @xmath69 is the gaunt factor .",
    "we obtain directly from our simulations @xmath70 , @xmath71 , and @xmath72 ( the spatial distributions of temperature , electronic , and ionic number densities , respectively ) , which are used in eq .",
    "( [ taunu ] ) to calculate @xmath65 ( in units of @xmath73 ) .",

    "based on an expansion rate of @xmath89 taken from the he ii lines , they obtained a dynamical age of @xmath90 for the core , while assuming a jet velocity of @xmath91 , a dynamical age of @xmath92 is deduced for the jets .",
    "our simulations required a much larger jet velocity to explain the radio emission of the lobes in the pn k 3 - 35 , thus yielding a short dynamical age for the jets , which is comparable with that of the core .",
    "this is interesting because it may suggests that the process that originated the ionisation of the jets and the core occurred almost simultaneously .",
    "synthetic maps were generated ( as described in section 3.2 ) for the following frequencies : 1.5 , 2.4 , 5 , 8.3 , 10 , 15 , and 22 ghz .",
    "very similar morphologies are obtained for all of these frequencies .",
    "figure [ f2 ] shows the maps obtained at 8.3 ghz .",
    "the left panel of figure [ f2 ] displays the simulated radio - continuum emission when the @xmath93 ( eq . [ jnu ] ) is integrated along the @xmath33-axis , giving the emission on the @xmath14-plane .",
    "the right panel of figure [ f2 ] shows the 8.3 ghz emission on the @xmath12-plane ( i.  e. , the integration of @xmath93 was carried out along the @xmath13-axis ) .",
    "the map on the right was shown to illustrate how the morphology strongly depends on the projection chosen . in the @xmath14-projection",
    ", the radio emission has an ` s ' shape ( which is the morphology of k 3 - 35 ) , while in the @xmath12-projection , we have a ` z ' shape . these maps are displayed in units of @xmath94 .    comparing the left panel of figure [ f2 ] with the column density map at @xmath88  yr of figure [ f1 ] , we see that the radio - continuum emission traces very well the precessing jet morphology .",
    "it is also possible to compare simulated and observed total fluxes .",
    "however , since we are not simulating the radio emission from the central region , we can only compare the radio emission from the lobes or jets , which were called the ` halo ' in @xcite . from each simulated radio map we measured the corresponding total flux from these structures .",
    "these fluxes are listed in table [ tab1 ] , where one can see that the total fluxes in the simulations ( at all frequencies ) are of the order of the observed ones . at an integration time of 40  yr , the simulated flux gives an optically thin behaviour for the spectrum . on the other hand , for integration times of 50  yr",
    ", the simulated flux has a maximum at a frequency between 5 and 8.3 ghz , in good agreement with the aaquist ( 1993 ) results . at frequencies higher than 8.3 ghz ,",
    "the spectral index is of @xmath95 , which corresponds to optically - thin thermal free - free emission .",
    "a direct comparison between both observed and simulated 8.3 ghz maps is shown in figure [ fcomp ] .",

    "also , the synthetic map was tilted in 48(with respect to @xmath97  axis , see fig .",
    "1 ) in order to do the position angle ( p.a ) of the jet direction ( in the @xmath98  plane ) equal to 65 , the observed p.a.@xcite .",
    "several 3d hydrodynamical simulations were carried out employing the adaptive grid code yguaz - a , in order to model both the morphology and the thermal radio emission of the planetary nebula k 3 - 35 .",
    "after analysing our results , we found that the bipolar structure of this pn can be described as the result of the interaction of a dense jet ( with an initial number density of @xmath99  @xmath100 or @xmath101 ) moving into a dense environment , previously swept up by the agb wind of the central star .",
    "the ` s ' morphology shown by k  3 - 35 in 8.3 ghz radio - continuum images @xcite can be reproduced if the modelled jet precesses with a period of 100  yrs on a cone with a half - opening angle of 20 .    for an integration time of 40  yrs",

    "this time is almost 20 times smaller than the one given by @xcite for the jet , where a slower velocity was assumed .",
    "however , it is only @xmath102 times larger than the dynamical age of the inner core ( also in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , suggesting that the two events are more related than previously thought , and further supporting the idea that k 3 - 35 is a young object .",
    "synthetic radio - continuum maps were generated from our numerical results .",
    "these maps show that the predicted morphologies and fluxes are in reasonable agreement with the observations . at an integration time of 40  yrs ,",
    "the obtained spectral index is the one of optically thin emission . for an integration time of 50  yrs ,",
    "the observed change of the spectral index with frequency ( aaquist 1993 ) is also reproduced by our simulation .",
    "a direct comparison between the observational and numerical results is given in fig .",
    "[ fcomp ] , where we show the observed and synthetic ( for an integration time of 40  yrs ) 8.3 ghz radio maps .",
    "we must note that the values for the velocity and mass loss rate employed in the simulation for the jet and the csm seem to be rather high .",
    "it is difficult for agb and post - agb starts to launch jets at velocities of the order of @xmath103 ( although riera et al .",
    "2003 have reported this kind of velocity for the outflows of the ppn 3 - 1475 ) .",
    "besides , the mass injection is also a bit extreme , in 40 years both jets have injected @xmath104 into the surrounding csm",
    ". this scenario might be explained in terms of a binary system , if the jet is produced by a companion accreting material ( at a rate about ten times higher than @xmath105 ) from a massive star ( the agb progenitor that produced the density distribution of the circumstellar material ) .",
    "the primary in the last 40 years has lost @xmath106 .",
    "this means that it started with an envelope containing this mass , which appears to correspond to an agb star rather than a post - agb star ( even though at the present time the star has already evolved to the planetary nebula stage ) .",
    "furthermore , the csm is very dense . with the parameters employed , in a radius of @xmath28  cm , a mass of 1 m@xmath107",
    "is contained , implying a massive pn .",
    "there is observational evidence that favours a very dense surrounding csm .",
    "however , the total mass derived from hco@xmath7 observations ( tafoya et al .",
    "2007 ) is quite low ( @xmath108m@xmath5 ) , so that the molecular emission from this molecule would be confined to a small , possibly shock excited volume , in order to be consistent with our much higher mass csm .",
    "these values imply that this scenario would be plausible if it is a short lived event .",
    "clearly , a better determination of these parameters could be done with proper motion studies and better distance determinations .    notwithstanding the extreme values for the employed parameters , it is important to note that a simple model of a precessing dense jet moving into an also dense csm , successfully reproduces the observed morphology of the pn k 3 - 35 , obtaining a qualitatively and quantitatively good agreement between the model predictions and the observations , although this scenario would be a short lived event .     and it is shown in the same scale that the observed one .",
