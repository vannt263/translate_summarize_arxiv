    "recently , we have used the x - boson method @xcite to study the superconducting phase diagram of the pam in the @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the on - site coulomb repulsion , in the presence of an attractive interaction between the localized @xmath1-electrons , @xmath4 where we only considered site independent local energies @xmath5 and a constant hybridization @xmath6 .",
    "the operator @xmath7 , creates cooper pairs , where @xmath8 is the hubbard operator .",
    "we have shown @xcite that the existence of superconductivity is constrained to a region where the @xmath1-band densities of states @xmath9 at @xmath10 is sufficiently high .",
    "a high @xmath11 usually implicates higher values of @xmath12 , what suggests that the kondo behavior of the system favors superconductivity in the x - boson approach .",
    "nevertheless , as charge carriers are added to the system the superconductivity was found both for configurations where the system presented intermediate valence ( iv ) and heavy fermion ( hf ) behavior and we have recovered the three characteristic regimes of the pam : kondo , iv and magnetic . this behavior which can not be found for the same model by the slave - boson treatment @xcite , since it breaks down when the @xmath1-occupation number @xmath13 . despite the fact that the model was primarily designed to the study of the heavy fermion compounds , theoretical descriptions of the superconducting phases based on two - band models have application for a large variety of systems and the model could fit into the description of the high temperature superconductors compounds ( htsc ) @xcite or into the new two - band superconductor mgb@xmath14 .",
    "meanwhile , unconventional superconductors may exhibit different pair symmetries .",
    "for instance , htsc cuprates appears to present @xmath15 superconductivity for some compounds and @xmath16-wave for others while for the hf compounds the crystallographic anisotropies and strong spin - orbit coupling make the task of determining the pair symmetry very difficult , athough @xmath17-wave model is still one of the leading candidates to describe superconductivity in upt@xmath18 @xcite .    in this paper we employ the x - boson approach to compare the results for the superconducting phase diagram of an isotropic @xmath16-wave superconductor with the results provided by a @xmath15 superconductor .",
    "the x - boson approach consists of introducing the variational parameter @xmath19 , which modifies the green s functions ( gf ) so that it minimizes an adequate thermodynamic potential while being forced to satisfy the `` completeness '' relation @xmath20 , where @xmath21 . to this purpose we added to the model the product of each `` completeness '' relation into a lagrange multiplier @xmath22 , and",
    "use this new hamiltonian to generate the functional that shall be minimized by employing the lagrange s method .    at the critical temperature",
    "the green s functions yields to the previous result found in the chain approximation of the pam , @xcite but now with the localized energy levels @xmath23 and @xmath24 renormalized , and we solve the mean - field superconducting gap equation @xcite at @xmath25 constrained to the `` completeness '' relation above . for the two dimensional @xmath15 superconductor we use the tight - binding band dispersion @xmath26 and",
    "an attractive interaction with a @xmath27 dependence in @xmath28-space leads to the same superconducting gap symmetry . on the other hand ,",
    "the superconducting phase diagram for the @xmath16-wave isotropic gap is obtained using a constant conduction density of states , @xmath29 , only defined for the interval @xmath30 .",
    "we make @xmath31 , @xmath32 and the superconducting interaction @xmath33 in units of the half - bandwidth @xmath34 or the hopping parameter @xmath35 .",
    "finally , the total electron number @xmath36 , is kept constant and the chemical potential is calculated self - consistently while the electrons are allowed to transfer between bands .",
    "in fig . [ figtcxnt_v03 ] the superconducting phase diagrams for a 2-@xmath37 @xmath38 superconductor and an isotropic @xmath16-wave superconductor are shown .",
    "as previously obtained @xcite the superconductivity is constrained to a region where @xmath11 is high and our results show that @xmath17-wave pairing exhibits the highest @xmath39 up to occupations of about @xmath40 , which is in the vicinity of the kondo regime . for higher occupations , both systems present a superconductor - insulator transition when the chemical potential @xmath41 crosses the hybridization gap , what means that @xmath41 lies in the region between the peaks of the density of states and the system presents a iv behavior .",
    "notice that for even more higher occupations , @xmath42 reaches the upper band , what can not be obtained by the slave - boson method , since it breaks down when @xmath43 . for @xmath44",
    "a crossover occurs into a regime where the isotropic @xmath45-wave pairing becomes the most stable for the parameters considered .",
