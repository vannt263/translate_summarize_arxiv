    "recall that our objective is to maximize throughput in a wireless network subject to a delay constraint and a wireless interference constraint .",
    "more precisely , the constraints can be viewed as follows :    1 .   wireless interference :",
    "throughput is limited due to the fact that transmissions interfere with each other .",
    "2 .   mobility : a packet may not be delivered to its destination before the delay deadline since neither the packet s source nor any relay node may get close enough to the destination .    in this section , we present some heuristic arguments to obtain an upper bound on the maximum throughput subject to these two constraints and derive the key results of the paper",
    ". while the heuristics are far from precise derivations of the optimal delay - throughput trade - offs , they may be useful to the reader in understanding the main results .",
    "in addition , the heuristic arguments provide the right order for the  hitting distance \" ( to be defined later ) which plays a critical role in the optimal scheme used to achieve the delay - throughput trade - offs .",
    "consider the two - dimensional i.i.d .",
    "mobility model with fast mobiles .",
    "we say that a packet _ hits _ its destination at time slot @xmath67 if the distance between the packet and its destination is less than or equal to @xmath68 under the two - dimensional i.i.d .",
    "mobility model , a packet hits its destination with probability @xmath69 at each time slot .",
    "so given a delay constraint @xmath0 the probability that a packet hits its destination in one of @xmath29 time slots is @xmath70 furthermore under the fast mobility , only one - hop transmissions are feasible at each time slot .",
    "so the transmission radius needs to be at least @xmath71 to deliver packets to the destinations when their distance is @xmath68 assume all nodes use a common transmission radius @xmath71 and that all nodes wish to transmit at each time slot , then each node has @xmath72 fraction of time to transmit , and the throughput per s - d pair is no more than @xmath72 where @xmath73 is a positive constant independent of @xmath42 thus the network can be regarded as a system where there are two virtual channels between each s - d pair as in figure [ fig : virtual2 ] .",
    "the packets are first sent over the erasure channel with erasure probability @xmath74 and then over the reliable channel with rate @xmath75 bits per time slot .",
    "each source can transmit at most @xmath55 bits per time slot on average .",
    "so in this virtual system , the maximum throughput of a s - d pair is @xmath76 and the corresponding optimal hitting distance @xmath77{nd}$ ] where @xmath78{c_1\\pi w}.$ ]    to achieve this throughput , we first need to use the optimal @xmath68 furthermore , _ a coding scheme achieving the capacity of the erasure channel _ is needed . since the erasure probability is determined by @xmath71 and @xmath0 which are different under different delay constraints , rate - less codes become a reasonable choice . the key idea in this paper",
    "is to encode data packets using raptor codes , which are near optimal rate - less codes with low complexity .",
    "we also note that the idea of using coding to improve reliability of packet delivery has also been considered by shah and shakkottai in @xcite for ad hoc sensor networks in a different context .",
    "our first result is as follows .    *",
    "main result 1 : * under the two - dimensional i.i.d . mobility model with fast mobiles , the throughput per s - d pair is @xmath79 given a delay constraint @xmath38 for @xmath29 is both @xmath80{n})$ ] and @xmath81 this throughput can be achieved using a joint coding - scheduling algorithm .",
    "note that the heuristic arguments leading up to the above result have many flaws .",
    "for example , it suggests that one can wait for the source to hit the destination to deliver the packet . in reality , such a scheme will not work since we deliver only one packet to the destination during each encounter between the s - d pair .",
    "thus other packets at the source which are not delivered may violate their delay constraints .",
    "this problem in the heuristic argument is due to the fact that it assumes that we have an independent erasure channel for each packet despite the fact that the transmitting node is the same source . despite the flaws , the heuristic argument surprisingly captures the delay - throughput trade - off and the optimal hitting distance correctly up to the right order . in practice ,",
    "the bound is achievable by exploiting the broadcast nature of the wireless channel to transmit each packet to several relay nodes and allowing relay nodes to independently attempt to deliver the packet the destination .",
    "next consider the two - dimensional i.i.d .",
    "mobility model with slow mobiles .",
    "since multi - hop transmissions are feasible at each time slot , using a precise version of the result @xcite which was obtained in @xcite , the maximum throughput per s - d pair under the slow mobility assumption is @xmath82 where @xmath83 is a positive constant independent of @xmath42 we provide a crude version of the argument from @xcite here for ease of readability .",
    "suppose each node uses a transmission radius @xmath84 and the distance between a s - d pair is @xmath85 then each bit has to travel @xmath86 hops .",

    "the main result is summarized as follows .",

    "however , they do not form the basis of the proofs in the rest of the paper .",
    "several assumptions have been made in deriving the virtual channel representation :    1 .",
    "the hitting events for various packets are assumed to independent which is difficult to ensure since the same node may act as a relay for multiple packets .",
    "it assumes a fixed hitting distance which is not reasonable to obtain an upper bound on the throughput .",
    "an upper bound must be scheme - independent .    in view of these limitations , we use the virtual channel model to only provide some insight into the results and the hitting distance we should use in the achievable algorithms , but rigorous proofs of the main results are provided in subsequent sections .",
    "in this section , we investigate the two - dimensional i.i.d . mobility model with fast mobiles .",
    "assuming that all mobiles have wireless communication and coding capability , we investigate the maximum throughput the network can achieve by using relaying and coding to recover packet loss as discussed in the heuristic arguments . given a delay constraint @xmath0 we will first prove that the maximum throughput per s - d pair which can be supported by the network is @xmath102 then a joint coding - scheduling scheme will be proposed to achieve the maximum throughput when @xmath29 is both @xmath80{n})$ ] and @xmath40      in this subsection , we show the maximum throughput the network can support without network coding , i.e. , under the following assumption .",
    "* assumption 1 : * packets destined for different nodes can not be encoded together .",
    "further , we assume that coding is only used to recover from erasures and not for data compression .",
    "specifically we assume that at least @xmath103 coded packets are necessary to recover @xmath103 data packets , where all packets ( coded or uncoded ) are assumed to be of the same size .",
    "assumption @xmath93 is the only significant restriction imposed on coding / routing / scheduling schemes .",
    "we also make the following assumption .",
    "* assumption 2 : * a new coded packet is generated right before the packet is sent out .",
    "the node generating the coded packet does not store the packet in its buffer .",
    "assumption 2 is not restrictive since the information contained in the new packet is already available at the node .",
    "* assumption 3 : * once a node receives a packet ( coded or uncoded ) , the packet is not discarded by the node till its deadline expires .",
    "assumption 3 is not restrictive since we are studying an upper bound on the throughput in this section .",

    "the @xmath332 condition on delay is used in our paper only to ensure that our cell partitioning , scheduling and coding strategy works .    in the case of fast mobiles ,",
    "when @xmath29 is @xmath290{n}),$ ] then the number of packets that can be transmitted in @xmath29 time slots is a constant and hence one can not use coding to ensure that the probability of packet loss is arbitrarily small . in this case , one can obtain a bound that is a logarithmic factor smaller than the upper bound using packet replication techniques as has been done in @xcite for the slow - mobile case .",
    "however , the best achievable lower bound is unknown . again the @xmath332 requirement is not significant since a throughput of @xmath24 can be achieved if the delay requirement is larger @xcite .",
