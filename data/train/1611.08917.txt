    "it is worth mentioning that , although the haldane model is realized in the cold atom setup , the topological ground state for this system is generally hard , if not impossible , to be reached .",

    "the idea of a quantum quench , which starts with the ground state of a topologically trivial hamiltonian @xmath2 supplemented by the evolution of a topologically trivial / nontrivial hamiltonian @xmath3 , provides an alterative way to studying the properties of the haldane model ( and haldane - like topological models )  @xcite .",
