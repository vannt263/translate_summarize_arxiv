    "the problem of a drop on a horizontal surface with the effect of surface tension being balanced with gravity has been studied for more than a century .",
    "the early numerical solutions go back to 1883 @xcite , with updates by different authors @xcite .",
    "different perturbative treatments of the problem have been developed over the years , among them are those by @xcite for small drops ( small bond number ) .",
    "as large drops ( or vanishing surface tension drops ) are theoretically an infinitely large and thin film of liquid subjected to the boundary conditions at the outer edge , the limit of large bond number falls and has been studied in the context of singular perturbation problems @xcite . based on the similarity between the truncated oblate spheroid and drop s shape ,",
    "an approximated profile is suggested in @xcite for the shape of the drop . in @xcite a new numerical treatment of the problem",
    "is given based on a variational method to minimize the total energy of the drop , by which the use of the tables by @xcite is more direct than the earlier treatments . as another effort in this direction , in @xcite",
    "the singular perturbation technique is used to obtain the asymptotic expressions describing the shape of small sessile and pendant drops .",
    "the study of the profiles of resting drops in different situations is particularly important for practical purposes .",
    "in fact , one of the most common methods to measure the surface tension of liquids is based on the matching between calculated drop s profiles and measured drop s shapes . over the years",
    ", the optimization of matching methods between the calculated profiles and the experimental data on drop s profiles has been the subject of several research pieces @xcite .",
    "treating a sessile drop as a boundary value problem , it is shown that the multi - parameter shooting method is applicable ( see _ e.g. _ @xcite ) .",
    "it is the purpose of this note to show that a one - parameter shooting method is applicable to sessile drops as well .",
    "the reduction of parameters is the result of using an identity directly derived from the young - laplace equation @xcite . by this identity the numerical procedure to reach the solution",
    "can be controlled by only one shooting parameter .",
    "the scheme of the rest of this note is as follows . in sec .",
    "2 the basic notions are shortly reviewed . in sec .",
    "3 the mathematical setup as well as the derivation of the mentioned identity is presented .",
    "is devoted to some results and comparisons with some available numerical and experimental data . in appendix a code in ` mathematica ` based on the developed shooting procedure is presented .",
    "the shape of a drop of liquid on a solid surface , in the idealized case ( absence of impurities and pinning effects ) , is determined by the quantities : 1 ) the surface tension of liquid @xmath2 , 2 ) the solid - liquid adhesion coefficient @xmath3 , 3 ) the shape of the solid surface , and due to the weight , 4 ) the drop s volume . at the solid - liquid - vapor ( s.l.v . )",
    "point of contact , the contact angle @xmath4 in the equilibrium condition is given by the young equation @xmath5 three classes of possibilities for the contact angle are presented in fig .  1 .        at every point on the drop surface the young - laplace relation holds @xmath6",
    "in which @xmath7 is the pressure jump across the surface , and @xmath8 are two principal radii of curvature of the surface at the point . provided by the hydrostatic laws , @xmath9 is expressed in terms of the surface equation .",
    "hence , the young - laplace relation is the partial differential equation which , accompanied by appropriate boundary conditions , determines the shape of the drop s surface .",
    "heuristically , the final shape of drop is the result of the balance between the surface effects and the bulk ones .",
    "while the surface tension tends to decrease the surface of the drop , the adhesion coefficient tends to increase the surface of the contact region , and the gravity tends to lower the center of mass of the drop . in many practical cases the surface tension and the adhesion coefficient , though with opposite effects ,",
    "may be considered at the same order , meaning @xmath2 and @xmath3 are comparable . for a drop with volume @xmath10 and density @xmath11 ,",
    "the so - called bond number defined by the dimensionless combination @xmath12 would determine whether weight has the dominant contribution or not .",
    "when the weight is ignorable , only the contribution from the surface effects exist . minimizing the area for a fixed volume , the drop s surface is part of a sphere .",
    "using the cylindrical coordinate setup given in fig .  2 ,",
    "the total curvature of a surface with azimuthal symmetry , represented by @xmath13 is given by @xcite @xmath14 where @xmath15 .",
    "the pressure jump in presence of gravity gets contribution from the weight of the drop s layers as well , leading to @xmath16 in which @xmath17 is the height of the drop s apex , and @xmath18 is a constant representing the pressure jump due to the surface tension .",
    "so , the young - laplace relation reads @xmath19 in which @xmath20 and @xmath21 are denoting the upper and lower parts of the drop , respectively ( see fig .",
    "2b ) , and @xmath22 .",
    "at apex ( @xmath23 ) we have @xmath24 , and so by ( [ 2 ] ) , @xmath25 is simply the curvature at apex of drop .",
    "we mention @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "the boundary conditions for @xmath28 are : @xmath29 in case with @xmath30 ( [ 7 ] ) and ( [ 8 ] ) are valid for @xmath20 .    , b ) @xmath31 . ]    the main issue with equation ( [ 5 ] ) is that the parameters @xmath17 and @xmath25 are not known at the first place , and would be determined only after the complete solution is available .",
    "so at starting point the main equation is not fully known .",
    "further , the contact radius @xmath32 ( fig .  2 ) , as the limiting value for the variable @xmath33 , is not known at first place .",
    "these all indicate that the young - laplace equation can not be treated as straightforward as an ordinary boundary value problem .",
    "as will be seen shortly , by integrating the young - laplace equation an identity is obtained which relates the three unknown parameters in a very helpful way . in what follows",
    "we mainly consider the case with @xmath31 . the generalization to case with @xmath34",
    "is rather straightforward . integrating the young - laplace equation for the upper and lower parts of drop leads to @xcite @xmath35",
    "in which we have used @xmath36 for @xmath31 .",
    "subtracting ( [ 9 ] ) and ( [ 10 ] ) gives @xcite @xmath37 in which we have used the relation for the volume of drop , @xmath38 it is easy to show that identity ( [ 12 ] ) is valid for the acute contact angle ( @xmath34 ) as well .",
    "it is reminded that in obtaining ( [ 12 ] ) no approximation is used , and so it is an exact relation .",
    "now , using the identity ( [ 12 ] ) , the combination @xmath25 and @xmath17 in right - hand side of ( [ 5 ] ) can be replaced in favor of @xmath32 , and the young - laplace equation turns to : @xmath39 in above the only unknown parameter is @xmath32 . for the case with @xmath34",
    "only @xmath20 in above should be kept .    for later use ,",
    "let us remind the spherical solution of weightless drop .",
    "it is easy to check that , by setting @xmath40 and @xmath41 , the expression @xcite @xmath42 satisfies ( [ 5 ] ) .",
    "the radius @xmath43 is fixed by the volume of spherical cap , @xmath44 following a simple geometrical argument in the sphere ( fig .",
    "2 ) , we have @xmath45    .",
    "the dashed curve is the sphere solution of weightless drop . ]    as in case with @xmath31 around the equatorial radius @xmath46 ( fig .",
    "2b ) @xmath47 , it would be convenient to switch to the spherical coordinates in which the whole surface of drop is covered by one function . among many others , we found the choice illustrated in fig .  3 more convenient",
    ", in which @xmath48 in the new coordinates the young - laplace equation takes the following form @xmath49= \\delta p_\\gamma+ \\varrho g ( h- z),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in which @xmath50 . using the identity (",
    "[ 12 ] ) leads to @xmath51r^2\\cos\\theta , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in which @xmath52 , the so - called the capillary constant . as we are considering axisymmetric drops ,",
    "it is sufficient to restrict the polar coordinate @xmath53 only to the left - side of drop , @xmath54 using ( [ 6])-([8 ] ) and ( [ 18])-([19 ] ) the boundary conditions in new coordinates are found @xmath55 therefore the shooting method by one controlling parameter @xmath32 can be employed to obtain numerical solutions of ( [ 21 ] ) .",
    "the value of @xmath56 of weightless drop can be chosen as the initial guess of the shooting parameter @xmath32 .",
    "as it is known that , due to weight , the radius of contact region increases ( see _ e.g. _ @xcite ) , upon stepwise increasing of the parameter @xmath32 and checking the condition ( [ 25 ] ) at apex of drop , one can reach the desired accuracy .    .",
    "in order to assess the accuracy of the present method , the results based on it are compared with some available data . however , it would be illustrative to begin with a demonstration of the results based on the method",
    ". the numerical solutions of ( [ 21 ] ) with different bond numbers for @xmath57 and @xmath58 are presented in fig .  4 and fig .  5 , respectively .",
    "the presented plots cover bond numbers from 0 to 15 . as expected , by increasing the bond number , the apex s height decreases while contact radius , as well as equatorial radius for case with @xmath28 , increase .",
    "as a further test , in tab .  1 the results of application of one - parameter shooting method to ( [ 21 ] ) are compared with those by @xcite by the adsa - d method .",
    "the input values used by @xcite are taken from the data generated by alfi program .",
    "it is mentioned that the present method returns the correct values with negligible errors .",
    ".the comparison between the numerical solutions by @xcite and those by the present work .",
    "the values by @xcite are taken from tabs .  1 & 2 . the parameter @xmath59 , as in this work",
