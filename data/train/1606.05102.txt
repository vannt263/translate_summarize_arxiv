    "cooperative spontaneous emission of light from excited atoms , which results from their common coupling with the surrounding electromagnetic field , is a central field of research in quantum optics . in the seminal paper  @xcite",
    ", dicke showed that spontaneous emission can be strongly enhanced when atoms are close to each other in comparison to the wavelength of the emitted radiation .",
    "this phenomenon , called superradiance , as well as its counterpart corresponding to reduced spontaneous emission , called subradiance , were first considered for distinguishable atoms at fixed positions .",
    "depending on the geometrical arrangment of the atoms in space , deeper analyses showed later that virtual photon exchanges between atoms were likely to destroy superradiance  @xcite . due to the complexity involved by the exact treatment of these dipole - dipole interactions , analytical characterizations of superradiance have been found only for particular geometries or for a small number of atoms @xcite . yet",
    ", cooperative emission processes are not restricted to small atomic samples .",
    "they can also be observed in dilute atomic systems for which the near - field contributions of the dipole - dipole interactions are insignificant .",
    "recent studies concern single - photon superradiance  @xcite , subradiance in cold atomic gases  @xcite , collective lamb - shift @xcite and localization of light @xcite .",
    "moroever , super- and subradiance can be explained using a quantum multipath interference approach and can be simulated from the measurement of higher - order - intensity - correlation functions on atoms separated by a distance larger than the emission wavelength  @xcite .",
    "the atomic motion can have a significant influence on the spontaneous emission and scattering of light  @xcite , and vice versa ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "however , its role on cooperative emission processes is not yet fully understood , especially in large laser driven atomic systems  @xcite .",
    "the interplay of atomic motion and cooperative processes has been the subject of recent experiments  @xcite and can lead to interesting effects such as supercooling of atoms @xcite or superradiant rayleigh scattering from a bec @xcite . in hot atomic samples ,",
    "the motion can be treated classically and leads to doppler broadenings of the spectral lines . in ( ultra)cold atomic samples , the quantum nature of the motion and the indistinguishability",
    "must be taken into account , as they also lead to strong modifications of the dynamics . in this paper , we study super- and subradiance from indistinguishable atoms , taking into account recoil , quantum fluctuations of the atomic positions , and quantum statistics . to this end",
    ", we solve a recently derived master equation describing the cooperative spontaneous emission of light by @xmath4 two - level atoms in arbitrary quantum motional states  @xcite .",
    "indistinguishability of atoms profoundly changes their internal dynamics as compared to that of distinguishable atoms .",
    "for distinguishable atoms with classical positions , the solution of the master equation depends considerably on the geometrical arrangement of the atoms in space .",
    "when describing each atom as a two - level atom , the internal state of the atoms thus evolves in the full hilbert space of dimension @xmath8 .",
    "the same general considerations can be made when the atomic positions are treated quantum mechanically since despite changed rates and level shifts the master equation @xcite then retains the same global form with the same lindblad operators .",
    "hence , each configuration must be dealt with case by case . however , for indistinguishable atoms , the global state has to be invariant under exchange of the atoms . for initial states that are separable between the internal degrees of freedom and the motional degrees of freedom ,",
    "both internal and motional states must be invariant under permutation of atoms .",
    "furthermore , on the time scale of the spontaneous emission in the optical domain , the motional state can be considered frozen such that the permutational symmetry of the motional state prevails throughout the entire emission process .",
    "this leads to permutationally invariant average lindblad - kossakowski matrix of emission rates and permutationally invariant dipole shifts , which limits the quantum dynamics also of the internal degrees of freedom to the permutation - invariant subspace of dimension @xmath9 of the global hilbert space @xcite , thus greatly simplifying the problem .",
    "however , the quantum fluctuations of the positions of the atoms modify the cooperative effect of collective emission , thus leading back from superradiance to individual spontaneous emission for large enough quantum uncertainty in the positions .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we discuss the general form of the master equation for the atomic internal dynamics derived in @xcite in the case of indistinguishable atoms . in particular , we show that the master equation preserves permutation invariance of the internal state . in section iii",
    ", we write the master equation in the coupled spin basis as it is particularly suited for permutation - invariant states . finally , in section iv",
    ", we solve the master equation analytically for @xmath3 and numerically for up to @xmath10 atoms in order to study the impact of the quantization of the atomic motion on super- and subradiance .",
