    "ngc  6520 ( c1800 - 279 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , j2000 . ) is a compact moderate age open cluster located in the sagittarius constellation only 4 degrees eastward of the galactic center direction .",
    "the region is very crowded ( see fig",
    ".  1 ) , and harbors also the dark molecular cloud barnard  86 ( @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xcite ) , a few arcmin westward of the cluster . the cloud is a very prominent feature , but other dust lanes are present across the field .",
    "in particular , the feature extends toward the cluster , and it is readily visible southward .",
    "moreover , by inspecting more closely fig .  1 , or sky maps , one has the clear impression that the dark nebula encompasses the whole cluster .",
    "+ this implies that across the region we expect the reddening to vary significantly , although within the small cluster radius variable reddening should not be a real issue .",
    "+ it seems quite natural to look for a possible relationship between the cluster and the cloud , due to their proximity .",
    "their mutual relationship can in fact turn out to be quite important for our understanding of the timing and outcomes of star clusters formation process .",
    "+ to address this issue , we obtained wide field optical photometry in the bvi filters , and @xmath0co(1@xmath10 ) data , which are presented and discussed in this paper .",
    "the aim is to derive estimates of the cluster and cloud distances from the sun , which is the basic step to clarify their possible relationship . + the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section  2 illustrates the data acquisition details and the data reduction procedures .",
    "section  3 is dedicated to the analysis of the optical data and the derivation of ngc  6520 fundamental parameters .",
    "section  4 deals with barnard  86 physical parameters determination , while section  5 highlights the paper results and proposes future lines of investigation .",
    "this section illustrates the data acquisition and the employed reduction techniques .",
    "bvi photometry of two overlapping fields in the region of ngc  6520 and barnard  86 was taken at the cerro tololo inter - american observatory ( ctio ) 0.90 m telescope on the nights of 24 and 25 june 1999 .",
    "the pixel scale of the 2048 @xmath10 2046 tek2k @xmath113 ccd is 0.396@xmath12 , allowing to observe a field of 13.5 @xmath13 squared arcmin in the sky .",
    "the total covered area amounts to @xmath14 squared arcmin .",
    "the two nights were photometric with an average seeing of 1.3 arcsec .",
    "we took several short ( 5 secs ) , medium ( 300 secs ) and long ( 600 secs ) exposures in all the filters to avoid saturation of the brightest stars .",
    "the data have been reduced with the iraf packages ccdred , daophot , allstar and photcal using the point spread function ( psf ) method @xcite .",
    "calibration was secured through the observation of @xcite standard fields g  26 , pg  1047 , pg  1323 , pg  1633 , pg  1657 , sa  110 , and sa  112 for a grand total of 90 standard stars .",
    "the calibration equations turned out of be of the form : + @xmath15 + @xmath16 + @xmath17 + @xmath18 , + and the final _",
    "r.m.s _ of the calibration turn out to be 0.03 for all the pass - bands .",
    "+ photometric errors have been estimated following @xcite.it turns out that stars brighter than @xmath19 mag have internal ( allstar output ) photometric errors lower than 0.15  mag in magnitude and lower than 0.21  mag in colour .",
    "the final photometric data ( coordinates , b , v and i magnitudes and errors ) consist of 50,000 stars will be made available in electronic form at the webda site maintained by j .-",
    "c . mermilliod .",
    "+ we finally estimated the completeness of our samples in the @xmath20 and @xmath21 filters .",
    "the completeness corrections have been determined by standard artificial - star experiments on our data ( see @xcite ) .",
    "basically we run several times the addstar task , adding 15  % of the number of detected stars and by counting the number of stars with the allstar task after performing all the steps and by using the same parameters as for the original images . in each run , a new set of artificial stars , following a similar magnitude distribution , was added at random positions .",
    "a comparison between the amount of added and detected stars , taking also into account that not all the stars are detected in both @xmath20 and @xmath21 filters , yield a completeness level of 100@xmath22 down to v = 16 , and larger than 60@xmath22 down to v=20 . at fainter magnitudes",
    ", the completeness level falls below 50@xmath22 , and therefore we are considering v = 20 as our limiting magnitude for the purpose of deriving the cluster mass ( but see also sect .",
    "3.1 ) .",
    "the observations were carried out in september 1998 with the columbia u .- u . de chile millimeter - wave telescope ( @xcite , @xcite ) located at cerro tololo interamerican observatory , chile .",
    "the telescope is a 1.2-m cassegrain with a beam - width of 8.8(fwhm ) at 115 ghz , the frequency of the co(@xmath23 ) transition .",
    "it was equipped with a super - heterodyne receiver with a ssb noise temperature of 380 k. the first stage of the receiver consisted of a schottky barrier diode mixer and a gaas field - effect transistor amplifier cooled to 77 k by liquid nitrogen .",
    "the spectrometer was a 256-channel filter bank of standard nrao design .",
    "each filter , 100 khz wide , provided a velocity resolution of 0.26 km s@xmath24 at 115 ghz and a coverage of 66 km s@xmath24 .",
    "the integration time for each position varied between 10 and 12 minutes , depending on source altitude and atmospheric opacity .",
    "spectra were intensity calibrated individually against a blackbody reference by the standard chopper - wheel method ( e.g @xcite and references therein ) , yielding a temperature scale @xmath25 corrected for atmospheric attenuation , resistive losses , and rearward spillover and scattering .",
    "sampling interval of 3.75(0@xmath26.0625 ) was used , almost half beam - width , to optimize the angular resolution of the instrument .",
    "position switching was used for all the observations with equal amounts of time spent on the source and on the reference positions .",
    "this radiotelescope has a main beam efficiency of 0.82 ( @xcite ) .",
    "in this section we use the optical data to derive ngc  6520 basic parameters , namely radius , reddening , distance , and age by means of star counts and isochrone fitting in the color magnitude diagrams ( cmds ) .",
    "+ the cluster was already studied in the past .",
    "the most recent study is by @xcite , who obtained ccd ubv photometry of about 300 stars in a @xmath27 arcmin area , and found that ngc  6520 is a 190 million years old cluster located 1.60 kpc from the sun with a reddening e@xmath3 = 0.43 .",
    "these results basically agree with previous investigation @xcite .",
    "we observed 50,000 stars down to v @xmath28 21 .",
    "we compared our photometry with @xcite one , and generally found a very good agreement at the level of 0.01 mag , but for the the brightest stars ( v @xmath29 11.4 ) , where our stars are brighter than @xcite ones by 0.2 - 0.3 mag .",
    "we believe that this is due to saturation problems in @xcite photometry .",
    "+      the aim of this section is to obtain the surface density distribution of ngc 6520 , and derive the cluster size in the magnitude space by means of star counts .",
    "the cluster radius is indeed one of the most important cluster parameters , useful ( together with cluster mass ) for a determination of cluster dynamical parameters .",
    "star counts allow us to determine statistical properties of clusters ( as visible star condensations ) with respect to the surrounding stellar background .",
    "+ by inspecting fig .  1",
    ", ngc 6520 appears as a concentration of bright stars in a region of about 1 - 2 arcmin . in order to derive the radial stellar surface density we first seek for the highest peak in the stellar density to find out the cluster center .",
    "the adopted center is placed at @xmath30 ; @xmath31 , as given by @xcite . then , the radial density profile is constructed by performing star counts inside increasing concentric annuli @xmath32 wide , around the cluster center and then by dividing by their respective surfaces .",
    "this is done as a function of apparent magnitude , and compared with the mean density of the surrounding galactic field in the same brightness interval .",
    "the contribution of the field has been estimated through star counts in the region outside 6 arcmin from the cluster center .",
    "poisson standard deviations have also been computed and normalized to the area of each ring as a function of magnitude , both for the cluster and for the field .",
    "+ the result is shown in fig .  2 , where one readily sees that ngc  6520 significantly emerges from the mean field above v@xmath2818 .",
    "at fainter magnitudes the cluster gets confused with the galactic disk population . based on the radial density profiles in fig .  1 , we find that stars brighter than v=18 provide a cluster radius smaller than 2 arcmin .",
    "we adopt as a final estimate of the radius the values @xmath33 arcmin .",
    "this is somewhat smaller than the estimate of 2.5 arcmin reported by @xcite , which was simply based on visual inspection .",
    "we shall adopt this values of the cluster radius throughout this work .",
    "+ we stress however that this radius is not the limiting radius of the cluster , but the distance form the cluster center at which the cluster population starts to be confused with the field population .",
    "the bvi photometry allow us to build up cmds in the v vs ( b - v ) and v vs ( v - i ) plane .",
    "they are shown in fig .",
    "3 panels , where we consider only the stars located within 1 arcmin from the cluster center .",
    "the main sequence ( ms ) extends from v = 11 to v = 20 , although at v = 18 the contamination by foreground stars starts to be significant .",
    "the ms has a width of about 0.2 - 0.3 mag , a bit larger than expected from simply photometric errors ( see sect  2 ) .",
    "there might be some differential reddening across the cluster area , but we believe it is not very important .",
    "unfortunately we do not have u photometry , but from the two color ( u - b ) vs ( b - v ) diagram by @xcite , one readily sees that the amount of differential reddening does not exceed 0.10 mag .",
    "therefore , differential reddening does not play an important role in a cluster that compact , and the ms width might be the result of the combination of the two effects , plus some probable interlopers and/or binary stars .",
    "the detailed shape of the turn off ( to ) region is much better defined than in @xcite , and deserves more attention , since the scatter of stars there is much larger than in the ms .",
    "the ms seems to stop at v = 12.5 and ( b - v ) = 0.25 ( ( v - i ) = 0.35 ) , and the brighter stars clearly are on the act of leaving it , since they lie red - ward of the ms .",
    "we are keen to believe that the few stars above the to , brighter than v = 12 , are field stars or blue stragglers , which are frequent in open star clusters .",
    "the global shape of the cmd is that of an open cluster of moderate age , like ngc  6204 ( @xcite ) or ngc  2287 ( @xcite ) .",
    "the fundamental parameters of ngc  6520 have already been derived in the past .",
    "both @xcite and @xcite agree that the cluster possesses a heliocentric distance of about 1600 pc and a reddening e@xmath3=0.42 . as for the age , there are some contradictory findings in the literature .",
    "in fact , while @xcite reports an age of 800 million years , @xcite suggest a much younger age of 190 million years .",
    "+ this is clearly due to the scatter in the upper part of the ms , which makes it difficult to recognize the turn off point ( to ) . before analysis our data we made use of the @xcite @xmath34 photometry to select photometric members basing on the @xmath35 method ( @xcite ) , and from the reddening corrected cmds ( see fig .",
    "4 ) we derived an absolute distance modulus @xmath36 by fitting an empirical zero age main sequence ( zams ) from @xcite . although the sequence is vertical and there might be problem in the brightest stars magnitude ( see sect .",
    "3 ) , the fit is quite good in both the cmds and provides a distance 1900@xmath2100 pc . + additionally , we derive ngc  6520 fundamental parameters by directly comparing the cmd with theoretical isochrones from the padova group ( @xcite ) .",
    "the results of the fit are presented in fig .  5 and fig .",
    "6 . in the left panel of fig  5",
    "we plot the v vs ( b - v ) cmd for all the stars within 1.5 arcmin from the cluster center .",
    "over - imposed is a zams from @xcite ( dashed line ) shifted by ( m - m)@xmath37 = 12.75@xmath38 and e@xmath3=0.42@xmath20.10 ( error by eyes ) , which fits very well the bulk of the cluster ms . together with the zams we over - imposed two solar metallicity isochones for the age of 100 ( dashed line ) and 200 ( dotted line ) million years from @xcite shifted by ( m - m)@xmath37 = 12.65 and e@xmath3=0.40 and ( m - m)@xmath37 = 12.75 and e@xmath3=0.42 , respectively",
    "this fit provides an estimate of the cluster distance from the sun , which turns out to be 1950 pc .",
    "this estimate is about 20% larger than the previous one by @xcite , and we believe this is due to the saturation of bright stars in @xcite which prevented to define clearly the upper part of the ms .",
    "+ however , on the base of this cmd one can not exclude a younger age due to the presence of several bright stars along the zams . to better understand the nature of these stars ,",
    "we isolate in the right panel of the same figure the stars within 0.5 arcmin from the cluster center , to minimize the effect of field stars contamination .",
    "the fit is still very good , and confirms previous findings about the distance and reddening , suggesting that the bright stars are just interlopers . + as for the age , a close scrutiny of the to region clearly favors an age around 200 million years .",
    "this is confirmed by the absolute magnitudes and colours of the brightest photometric members . with",
    "a to located at v @xmath28 12.5 - 13 , we expect that un - evolved stars still in the ms have m@xmath37 in the range -0.25 to 0.25 , and therefore a spectral type around b5-b8 , which implies an age around 150 million year ( @xcite ) . + finally , in fig .",
    "6 we achieve the same fit both in the b vs ( b - v ) ( left panel ) and in the v vs ( v - i ) diagram ( right panel ) . here",
    "we provide again a reasonable fit to the data for the same distance modulus , and a reddening e@xmath39=0.55 .",
    "the ratio @xmath40 turns out to be 1.30 , not far from the widely used 1.24 value from @xcite .",
    "+ in conclusion , we estimate the age of ngc  6520 to be 150@xmath250 million years , and provide a distance of about 1900@xmath2100 pc , @xmath41 larger than previous estimates .      in order to derive the cluster mass we firstly derive the cluster luminosity function ( lf ) and mass function ( mf ) , in the same way as in @xcite .",
    "briefly , we considered only the stars within 1.5 arcmin from the cluster nominal center , and brighter than v = 18 ( see sect .",
    "3.1 ) , and statistically derived the cluster population by subtracting the field population from a same area region outside 6 arcmin from the cluster nominal center .",
    "the subtraction is made bin by bin , with bin size of 0.5 mag , and any bin population has been corrected for the corresponding incompleteness .",
    "the mf turns out to be a power law with slope @xmath42 and therefore compatible with the standard @xcite mf . by integrating the mf over the v mag .",
    "range 11 to 18 , we estimate that the cluster mass is 364@xmath43 @xmath44 .",
    "in this section we derive the physical parameters of the molecular cloud associated with barnard 86 obtained from a gaussian fit to its composite spectrum , i.e. , the sum of all spectra across the cloud s projected surface .",
    "+ the quality of the spectra is shown is fig .  7 , together with the best gaussian fit .",
    "the figure shows the average of the two brightest co 1@xmath10 spectra .",
    "the cloud is clearly detected in at least 9 positions within a 30 position map .",
    "the _ rms _ noise of the spectrum shown is 0.15 k. the intensity scale is in antenna temperature , uncorrected by the main beam efficiency .",
    "this is a 9 sigma detection at the peak , or 15 sigma detection of the integrated intensity .",
    "the only effect of combining the central two spectra is to reduce the noise by a factor 1.41 , but the detection is strong in both spectra .",
    "we derive the cloud properties by assuming that the nebula lies at the same distance of the cluster ngc  6520 .",
    "this is naturally a crude assumption , which is mainly motivated by the appearance of fig .  1 .",
    "the center of the dark nebula lies 6 arcmin from the cluster center , but the two objects do not appear clearly detached .",
    "the whole cluster seems to be surrounded by some nebulosity , which gets denser in the southern regions , and which seems to form a bridge with the main body of the cloud northwest of the cluster .",
    "this is also confirmed by the appearance of the whole region in the southern h - alpha sky survey atlas ( @xcite ) , where one can clearly see that the nebula embraces the cluster .",
    "+ obviously , this assumption must be verified in some more quantitative way , which is not possible with the present data .",
    "+ the only way we envisaged was to count the number of stars in front of the cloud , and compare this number with the number of stars expected to lie within 1 , 2 and 3 kpc from the sun in the direction of the cloud , as derived from a galactic model ( @xcite , @xcite ) . from our photometry we can count in front of the dark cloud 15 stars in the magnitude range @xmath45 . in the same magnitude range , the galactic model predicts 3,046 , 17,138 and 41,360 stars per square degree within 1 , 2 and 3 kpc from the sun . by assuming an area of the dark cloud of 4 squared armin",
    ", we expect from the model about 3.5 , 19 and 46 stars in the same magnitude range in front of the nebula .",
    "although model - dependent , this results brings some support to our assumption of common distance for the cluster and the dark cloud .",
    "the peak of the co emission turns out to be located at l=2.875@xmath46 and b=-2.8125@xmath46 .",
    "the radial velocity @xmath47 and the linewidth @xmath48 result to be 11.28@xmath2 0.25 and 2.07@xmath20.25 km s@xmath24 , and corresponds to the peak and to the fwhm of the gaussian fit of the composite spectrum , respectively . the value of the velocity by the way is in nice agreement with the 11.6 km s@xmath24 estimate by @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , it is not possible to estimate the distance of the cloud from its radial velocity by means of the milky way rotation curve , due to the particular cloud position , located in the direction of the galactic center . + adopting the 2 kpc distance",
    ", we estimate an effective radius of 5.36@xmath20.56 pc .",
    "we define the effective radius of the cloud as @xmath49 , where @xmath50 is the actual projected area obtained from the angular extent of the cloud , measured from the spatial maps .",
    "+    the luminosity of co @xmath51 was found to amount to 5.1@xmath20.2 @xmath52 k km s@xmath24 pc@xmath53 , being @xmath51 the @xmath0co luminosity given by    @xmath54    where @xmath55 is the @xmath0co line intensity integrated over all velocities and lines of sight within the boundaries of the cloud , and @xmath56 is the heliocentric distance of the cloud ( 2 kpc ) .",
    "as for the mass , this is computed from the @xmath0co luminosity , and results to be @xmath57 . @xmath58 was estimated directly from its @xmath0co luminosity on the empirically based assumption that the integrated co line intensity is proportional to the column density of h@xmath59 along the line of sight ( e.g. @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "thus , the masses were computed using the relation    @xmath60    where @xmath61 is the mean molecular weight per h@xmath59 molecule , @xmath62 is the constant ratio of h@xmath59 column density to integrated @xmath0co intensity , and @xmath51 is the @xmath0co luminosity .",
    "a detailed description on this kind of mass calculation can be found in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "+ it is also possible to derive an estimate of the cloud virial mass .",
    "the virial mass @xmath63 was derived using the relation    @xmath64    where @xmath63 is in solar masses , @xmath65 is the effective radius of the cloud , in pc , and @xmath48 is the hpfw of the cloud s composite spectrum , in km s@xmath24 .",
    "this equation assumes that : 1 ) the cloud is in virial equilibrium , 2 ) the cloud is spherical with a @xmath66 density distribution , where @xmath67 is the distance from its center , 3 ) the observed @xmath0co line width of the cloud is an accurate measure of the net velocity dispersion of its internal mass distribution , which is believed to be clumpy on many scales under these assumptions , the mass turns out be be @xmath63 = 3000 @xmath44 .",
    "+ because of the large discrepancy between @xmath58 and @xmath68 , we can conclude that this molecular cloud is not in virial equilibrium , and therefore its mass is about 600 @xmath44 .",
    "in this paper we have presented deep ccd bvi photometry and @xmath0co(1@xmath10 ) in the region of the open cluster ngc  6520 and the dark molecular cloud barnard  86 .",
    "we provided updated estimates of the cluster parameters , suggesting that its heliocentric distance is 1900@xmath2100 pc , and the age is 150@xmath250 million years .",
    "+ we then derive barnard  86 physical parameters on the assumption that the cloud is at the same distance as the cluster . + as we discussed ,",
    "this assumption in the present study is only motivated by the particular distribution of the nebulosity in the region of the cloud and the cluster , which seems to support some association of the two objects . in fig .",
    "8 we show a dss map of the region where the cluster and the cloud are located , and we overimposed the iso - intensity contour in @xmath69 .",
    "the thick line is the full width half maximum ( fwhm ) of the gaussian fit , and clearly crosses the cluster . to us",
    "this might mean that the nebolosity close to the cluster is related to barnard  86 , although better resolution spectra are necessary to derive firmer conclusions .",
    "we corroborated this hypothesis by comparing the number of stars we can see in front of the cloud with the predictions of a galactic model , and it turned out that thei distance of 2 kpc is quite reasonable .",
    "+ the age of the cluster ( 150@xmath250 million years ) seems to be incompatible with this assumption , since the mean lifetime of a molecular cloud does not exceed a few time 10-million years ( @xcite ) .",
    "this makes the hypothesis of the connection between the cloud and the cluster puzzling .",
    "+ however , if we accept the common distance hypothesis , the scenario one might envisage is that both ngc  6520 and the dark cloud barnard  86 share the same origin , the latter being the remain of a star formation process finished about 150@xmath70 years ago .",
    "+ in this case , barnard  86 may be an interesting cloud to study the possible stability of gas condensations over a full galactic rotation .",
    "in fact , to our best knowlegde no other clouds are known to show evidences of a possible relation with an open cluster that old .",
    "clearly , our assumption on the distance must be better constrained , and we propose to derive for instance the radial velocity of a few ngc  6520 member stars which should be compared with the cloud velocity or the ir spectra of some bright stars inside the nebula to measure the properties of the h@xmath71 line ( @xcite ) .",

    "<S> wide field bvi photometry and @xmath0co(1@xmath10 ) observations are presented in the region of the open cluster ngc  6520 and the dark molecular cloud barnard  86 . from the analysis of the optical data we find that the cluster is rather compact , with a radius of 1.0@xmath20.5 arcmin , smaller than previous estimates . </S>",
    "<S> the cluster age is 150@xmath250 myr and the reddening e@xmath3=0.42@xmath20.10 . </S>",
    "<S> the distance from the sun is estimated to be 1900@xmath2100 pc , and it is larger than previous estimates . </S>",
    "<S> we finally derive basic properties of the dark nebula barnard  86 on the assumption that it lies at the same distance of the cluster . </S>"
