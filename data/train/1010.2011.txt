    "the study of the star formation process and the origin of stellar initial mass function ( imf ) , defined as the distribution of stellar masses at the time of birth , are key issues in astrophysics .",
    "since majority of stars tend to form in clusters or groups , young star clusters are considered to be the fundamental units of star formation ( lada & lada 2003 ) .",
    "young star clusters are useful tool to study the imf as they contain statistically significant number of young stars of rather similar age spanning a wide range of masses .",
    "since these objects are not affected by the dynamical evolution as the ages of these objects are significantly less in comparison to their dynamical evolution time , the present day mass function ( mf ) of these objects can be considered as the imf . however , a recent study by kroupa ( 2008 ) argues that even in the youngest clusters , it is difficult to trace the imf , as clusters evolve rapidly and therefore eject a fraction of their members even at a very young age .    in the last decade , there have been a large number of studies in great detail in several young clusters within 2 kpc of the sun investigating these issues ( e.g. , lada & lada 2003 , pandey et al .",
    "2008 , jose et al .",
    "although the theoretical expectation is that the imf of a cluster should depend on the location , size , metallicity , density of the star forming environment and other conditions such as temperature or pressure ( zinnecker 1986 ; larson 1992 ; price & podsiadlowski 1995 ) , for clusters located within 2 kpc , there is no compelling evidence for variation in the stellar imf above the solar mass ( e.g. meyer et al . 2000 ; kroupa 2002 ; chabrier 2005 ) .    with the aim of understanding the star formation process and imf in / around young star clusters",

    "since the distribution of youngest ysos on the border of clump c2 has a resemblance to the distribution of class i/ ii ysos in rcw 82 , the formation of these ysos could be due to the result of small - scale jeans gravitational instabilities in the collected layer , or interactions of the ionization front with the pre - existing condensations as suggested by pomars et al .",

    "the distribution of stellar masses that form in a star formation event in a given volume of space is called imf and together with star formation rate , the imf dictates the evolution and fate of galaxies and star clusters ( kroupa 2002 ) .",
    "young clusters are important tools to study imf since their mf can be considered as imf as they are too young to loose significant number of members either by dynamical or stellar evolution . to study the imf of ngc 1624 we used the data within @xmath86 .",

    "<S> we present a comprehensive multi - wavelength analysis of the young cluster ngc 1624 associated with the region sh2 - 212 using optical @xmath0 photometry , optical spectroscopy and gmrt radio continuum mapping along with the near - infrared ( nir ) @xmath1 archival data . from optical observations of the massive stars , </S>",
    "<S> reddening @xmath2 and distance to the cluster are estimated to be 0.76 - 1.00 mag and @xmath3 kpc , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> present analysis yields a spectral class of o6.5v for the main ionizing source of the region and the maximum post - main - sequence age of the cluster is estimated as @xmath4 4 myr . </S>",
    "<S> detailed physical properties of the young stellar objects ( ysos ) in the region are analyzed using a combination of optical / nir colour - colour and colour - magnitude diagrams . </S>",
    "<S> the distribution of ysos in @xmath5 nir colour - colour diagram shows that a majority of them have @xmath6 @xmath7 4 mag . </S>",
    "<S> however , a few ysos show @xmath6 values higher than 4 mag . </S>",
    "<S> based on the nir excess characteristics , we identified 120 probable candidate ysos in this region which yield a disk frequency of @xmath4 20% . </S>",
    "<S> however , this should be considered as a lower limit . </S>",
    "<S> these ysos are found to have an age spread of @xmath4 5 myr with a median age of @xmath4 2 - 3 myr and a mass range of @xmath4 0.1 - 3.0 @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> a significant number of ysos are located close to the cluster centre and we detect an enhanced density of reddened ysos located / projected close to the molecular clumps detected by deharveng et al . </S>",
    "<S> ( 2008 ) at the periphery of ngc 1624 . </S>",
    "<S> this indicates that the ysos located within the cluster core are relatively older in comparison to those located / projected near the clumps . from the radio continuum flux , </S>",
    "<S> spectral class of the ionizing source of the ultra - compact ( uc ) region at the periphery of sh2 - 212 is estimated to be @xmath4 b0.5v . from optical data , </S>",
    "<S> slope of the mass function ( mf ) @xmath9 , in the mass range @xmath10 can be represented by a single power law with a slope -1.18 @xmath11 0.10 , whereas the nir data in the mass range @xmath12 yields @xmath9 = -1.31 @xmath11 0.15 . </S>",
    "<S> thus the mf agrees fairly with the salpeter value . </S>",
    "<S> the slope of the @xmath13-band luminosity function ( klf ) for the cluster is found to be 0.30 @xmath11 0.06 which is in agreement with the values obtained for other young clusters .    </S>",
    "<S> [ firstpage ]    stars : formation @xmath14 stars : luminosity function , mass function @xmath15 stars : pre@xmath14main@xmath14sequence @xmath16 open clusters and associations : individual : ngc 1624 . </S>"
