    "the galaxy s h@xmath0 morphology ( martin 1998 ; calzetti et al . 2004 ; meurer et al .",

    "( 1997 , 1999 ) showed that the uv emission is dominated by a 34 myr old , relatively small star cluster , ngc 5253 - 4 ( meurer et al .",
    "on the other hand , a dust - enshrouded ( @xmath1835 mag ) very young central cluster ( 22.7 myr old ) , ngc 5253 - 5 , is responsible for most of the nuclear region s ionization ( tremonti et al .",
    "2001 ; cresci et al .",
    "2005 ) . at radio wavelengths , turner et al .",
    "( 1998 , 2000 ) derive ionization potentials driven by large numbers ( 2001000 ) of o - type stars , which they interpret to imply that very large clusters are the preferred mode of star formation in the central regions of the galaxy .",
    "it is thus clear that the galaxy s star and star cluster formation history is highly complex .",
    "despite the plethora of existing , detailed studies , many of the salient details of the galaxy s evolution remain open - ended .",
    "this realization is perhaps mostly driven by the object s proximity , which allows us to probe the star - forming environment in significantly greater detail than in more distant starbursts . on the other hand ,",
    "ngc 5253 s proximity also offers us the key advantage of it having been observed repeatedly across the full observable wavelength range .",
    "nevertheless , where the stellar component has been subject to detailed scrutiny , most studies have either focussed on careful , mostly spectroscopic studies of a few objects at a time , or systematic exploration of the galaxy s full extent but based on relatively simple approaches .",
    "this is particularly so for its star cluster population .",
    "previous statistical studies have relied on straightforward application of simple stellar population ( ssp ) analysis based on optical broad - band data ( e.g. , harris et al . 2004 ; cresci et al .",
    "2005 ; harbeck et al .",
    "however , in recent years , theory and computational approaches have made significant advances .    in this paper , we go significantly beyond previous studies of the ngc 5253 star cluster population in a number of complementary ways .",
    "first , although we still use primarily ( medium- and ) broad - band imaging observations , we base our results on the highest - achievable spatial resolution from the near - uv ( nuv ) to the near - infrared ( nir ) regimes . the gain in resolution compared to previous studies is of order a factor of two in both spatial dimensions , while our accessible wavelength range transcends previous studies by incorporation of the crucial nuv and nir passbands ( which will allow us to at least partially break the age ",
    "metallicity and age  extinction degeneracies ) .",
    "where relevant , we also refer to h@xmath0 emission - line results to further reduce the uncertainties .",
    "second , we focus specifically on one aspect of extragalactic star cluster populations where we take full advantage of the observational gains , i.e. , the importance and origin of a red or ir excess in the spectral - energy distributions ( seds ) of a relatively low - mass cluster population such as that in ngc 5253 . to address this aspect",
    ", we do not need to have access to a statistically complete sample of star clusters down to the lowest detection limits enabled by the observations worst signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section [ observations.sec ]",
    "we discuss the observational data which form the basis of our analysis , as well as our data reduction approach .",
    "the analysis methods adopted are outlined in section [ analysis.sec ] , while we discuss the robustness of the results and perform a comparison in section [ robust.sec ] .",
    "we offer a preliminary discussion of the effects of stochasticity in the stellar mass function separately , in section [ stoch.sec ] , and provide an overview of the physical state of the ngc 5253 cluster population in section [ overall.sec ] .",
    "finally , we summarize and conclude the paper in section [ summary.sec ] .    this is the first article in a series of three . in paper ii",

    ", we will present a detailed theoretical investigation of the effects of stochastic sampling on cluster age and mass determinations based on adopting fully sampled stellar mass functions using our own ssp models and analysis approach ( cf .",

    "( r. de grijs et al . , in prep . )",
    ", we will apply these insights to the data set analysed here , to explore in detail to which extent our results are affected by biases owing to stochastic sampling of the clusters mass functions .",
    "the present paper is meant to establish the baseline for this body of work .",
    "we mined the _ hst _",
    "data archive for available medium-/broad - band and h@xmath0 observations of ngc 5253 obtained with its main optical and nir cameras , i.e. , the advanced camera for surveys ( acs ) , the wide - field and planetary camera-2 ( wfpc2 ) and the near - infrared camera and multi - object spectrometer ( nicmos ) .",
    "since we had selected our target galaxy based on the availability of a large number of high - resolution _ hst _ data sets spanning the longest possible wavelength range , we could make a careful selection of the best possible data sets to reach our science goals .",
    "table [ data.tab ] includes details of the final set of observations used , which were selected to achieve the best possible combination of spatial resolution ( aimed at reducing contamination by neighbouring sources ) , s / n ( for which we initially used exposure time as a proxy ) and extensive , continuous wavelength coverage .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,<,>,>,<,^ \" , ]     despite these differences for a small number of clusters , the main features in the overall age and mass distributions ( bottom row ) are fairly well reproduced by both independent approaches . assuming a simple underlying skewed gaussian distribution , the peak in the age distribution resulting from our analysed analysis ( including all objects ) occurs at @xmath19 , with @xmath20 . for comparison ,",
    "the yggdrasil - based analysis returned @xmath21 , with @xmath22 . for the mass distributions ,",
    "we find @xmath23 versus 3.37 , and @xmath24 versus 0.77 , respectively .",
    "this excellent correspondence is much better than the feature - reproduction robustness reported in de grijs et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , where we quoted reproducibilities of @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "if we compare the age and mass determinations for the individual clusters , a similar result emerges .",
    "the mean differences between the yggdrasil - based analysis and the analysed results is @xmath27 and @xmath28 , respectively , with spreads ( gaussian @xmath29 s ) of 0.900 and 0.517 dex , respectively .",
    "so far , we have focussed on the power of ( medium- and ) broad - band sed analysis based on extensive wavelength coverage .",
    "this is the type of observational data one might expect to obtain most easily for any extragalactic star cluster system , and hence exploration of the limitations of such a data set is relevant . for our analysis of the specific star cluster sample of ngc 5253",
    ", we also obtained narrow - band f658n observations from the _ hst _ data archive , covering the h@xmath0 emission line .",
    "calzetti et al .",
    "( 1997 ) already extensively explored the galaxy s morphology and dust properties based on these observations , so that we will not repeat that analysis here . ] for most of the ngc 5253 clusters , numerous authors , including calzetti et al .",
    "( 1997 ) and cresci et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , provide support for the young ages resulting from their fits by referring to the h@xmath0 fluxes found associated with these objects .",
    "fluxes have also been found useful for analyses of numerous other ysc systems ( for recent references , see e.g. , chandar et al .",
    "2011 ; whitmore et al .",
    "2011 ; fouesneau et al . 2012 ; and references therein ) , although the present analysis represents the first full integration of h@xmath0 photometry in a simultaneous multi - passband ( @xmath30 filters ) approach .    in this section ,",
    "we add the f658n / h@xmath0 photometry to our seds for confirmation and reanalysis of the properties of the ngc 5253 clusters using the yggdrasil models .",
    "we obtained two sets of f658n photometry for our star cluster sample .",
    "first , we adopted the same apertures as for the nearest continuum filter , f550 m .",
    "however , h@xmath0 emission may be more extended than that of the associated continuum sources . as such",
    ", we determined the gaussian @xmath31 s on the f658n image itself and used these size estimates to determine a second set of f658n magnitudes ( using the source , inner and outer sky radii expressed in units of @xmath31 as defined in section [ photom.sec ] ) .",
    "a comparison of gaussian sizes ( not shown ) indicates that the h@xmath0 emission coincident with our sample clusters exhibits a much broader range than the associated continuum emission in the f550 m filter .",
    "[ halpha.fig]a shows the resulting f658n photometry as a function of aperture size used .",
    "although a reasonable one - to - one correlation between the f658n magnitudes resulting from using aperture sizes based on the f550 m and f658n @xmath31 s is apparent , there is a clear offset to brighter magnitudes if the f658n - based size criterion is used , particularly for objects returned as younger than 10 myr , based on the yggdrasil - based broad - band analysis ( indicated in red ) .",
    "this underscores the need to account for differences in source sizes as a function of passband .",
    "panel ( b ) shows the distribution of our sample clusters in the f550 m versus f658n magnitude plane ( the latter includes both continuum and line flux , if present ) .",
    "again , the red data points are the objects younger than 10 myr and the dotted line is the locus of equality , corrected for the difference in filter transmission windows .",
    "this panel shows that all sources that are more than twice their photometric @xmath32 uncertainties from the dotted line are young ( @xmath33 myr ) .",
    "note that we used the same apertures here for both axes , so that we can properly compare the presence of any h@xmath0 excess .",
    "figs [ halpha.fig]c and d compare the masses and ages , respectively , obtained using the photometry based on the differently sized apertures shown in panel ( a ) .",
    "we have left out the error bars for presentational clarity ( see , e.g. , fig . [ fig3.fig ] for guidance ) .",
    "these panels show that the impact of the different aperture sizes is very small , even at ages where significant h@xmath0 emission may be expected .    in fig .",
    "[ halpha2.fig ] ( top row ) we compare the ages , masses and extinction values based on using our ( medium- and ) broad - band photometry only ( ` bb ' ) , and that based on also including the f658n data .",
    "the bottom row shows the equivalent histograms of these parameters .",
    "the dotted histograms are the distributions based on the ( medium- and ) broad - band data only ; the solid histograms are based on additional inclusion of the f658n fluxes .",
    "the differences , in any of the panels , are very small and statistically negligible .",
    "this is exemplified by a quantitative comparison of the histograms characteristics .",
    "the peak and gaussian width of the age distribution resulting from our analysis including the f658n photometry are @xmath34 and @xmath22 dex , respectively , compared with 7.10 and 0.94 dex for the analysis based on the ( medium- and ) broad - band images only .",
    "similarly , the mean and gaussian width of the equivalent mass distributions are @xmath35 and @xmath36 dex , respectively , versus 3.37 and 0.76 dex .",
    "we thus conclude that the h@xmath0 photometry fully supports our age and mass determinations of the ngc 5253 cluster sample based on medium- and broad - band photometry alone .",
    "stochastic sampling of the stellar mass function , particularly of the massive stars in relatively low - mass ( @xmath37 a few @xmath5 m@xmath2 )  and therefore relatively poorly populated  clusters , may significantly affect the determination of fundamental cluster parameters based on broad - band seds ( e.g. , cervio , luridiana & castander 2000 ; cervio et al .",
    "2002 ; cervio & luridiana 2004 , 2006 ; barker et al . 2008 ; maz apellniz 2009 ; popescu & hanson 2010 ; fouesneau & lanon 2010 ; fouesneau et al .",
    "2012 ; popescu , hanson & elmegreen 2012 ) . in general ,",
    "stochastic sampling of cluster stellar mass functions leads to broad , asymmetric colour distributions compared with the equivalent distributions associated with fully sampled ssp models and , as a consequence , important local biases are introduced in cluster age determinations for masses @xmath38 a few @xmath5 m@xmath2 . the resulting cluster _",
    "masses _ are usually less affected by stochastic sampling than the corresponding age estimates ; they tend to scatter around the equivalent mass determinations derived using the traditional approach .",
    "inspection of the derived cluster masses in figs [ fig5.fig ] and [ fig7.fig ] clearly indicates that the majority of our sample clusters may be affected by stochastic sampling of their mass functions ( cf . the mass ranges quoted in harris et al .",
    "2004 ; cresci et al .",
    "this observation is further compounded by the results of our age determinations ( based on the assumption of fully sampled ssps ! ) , which imply that a large fraction of the ngc 5253 clusters have ages near @xmath39 yr ( as confirmed and tightly constrained by the h@xmath0 analysis in section [ halpha.sec ] ) .",
    "this corresponds to stellar population ages when luminous red stars are present .",
    "red - supergiant stars ( rsgs ; with stellar masses up to @xmath40 m@xmath2 ) , in particular , start to appear around this time in realistic stellar populations , while at the same time the massive , hot , ionizing stars that dominate at young ages may cause significant variations in the nebular emission from stochastically sampled clusters ( e.g. , cervio et al .",
    "2000 ; fouesneau et al .",
    "these stars are significantly brighter than their main - sequence counterparts , but not proportionally more massive .",
    "the absence or presence of a small number of such stars can significantly affect the observed integrated colours of a cluster .",
    "for instance , stochastic effects are expected to affect the colour and magnitude of a 10 myr - old , @xmath41 m@xmath2 cluster by @xmath42 and @xmath43 mag ( dolphin & kennicutt 2002 ) .",
    "in addition , these sources are relatively short - lived , and so the luminosity of the clusters might be expected to vary significantly on short timescales ( e.g. , kiss et al .",
    "2006 ; szczygie et al .",
    "2010 ; and references therein ) .",
    "this is of particular interest and relevance in the present context because our observational data were taken over a period spanning a total of @xmath44 years between the first and final images included in this study ( proposal ids 5479 and 10609 , respectively ) .",
    "we can obtain a better ( initial ) handle on the significance of the stochastic sampling effects associated with our cluster sample by examining fig .",
    "[ fig8.fig ] in detail .",
    "first , we note that most of our clusters are young and relatively unaffected by extinction . for @xmath45 mag",
    ", it appears that most of the clusters can be explained by a young age ( @xmath46 yr ) .",
    "however , in this case neither clusters redder than @xmath47 mag , nor those redder than the @xmath48 values defined by the ssp models can be explained .",
    "this implies that at least some amount of extinction is required to match the distribution of the clusters in colour  colour space .",
    "in addition , clusters that are redder in @xmath48 than the envelope of the ssp models with variable extinction are most likely explained by the presence of individual stars .",
    "this includes the majority of objects we identified as having an ir excess .",
    "( note that we can not exclude the possibility that , in a small number of cases , an additional photon source that is unaccounted for may also give rise to their violation of the observational boundaries for genuine stars and ssps . )    as such , we conclude that the ir excesses observed in 30 of the ngc 5253 clusters are consistent with the effects of stochastic sampling . similarly , the additional clusters found in the same part of the colour  colour diagram are likely also affected by stochastic sampling if we adopt the same reasoning .",
    "this includes 3040 per cent of the total sample discussed in this paper .",
    "a first investigation focussing on the accuracy of derived cluster ages obtained along similar lines as done in this paper was published by silva - villa & larsen ( 2011 ) .",
    "we are in the process of implementing direct stochastic modelling using the galev ssps as our basis .",
    "a preliminary comparison of our models with the results of silva - villa & larsen ( 2011 ) indicates good agreement ( e. silva - villa , priv .",
    "commun . ) .",
    "we note , however , that we are introducing important improvements with respect to their work . in particular , our observations of the ngc 5253 cluster system cover a much larger wavelength range , while we are also investigating the effects of extinction as a free parameter in our fits .",
    "a much more in - depth investigation of the effects of stochastic sampling on the ages and masses determined based on broad - band photometry will be published in paper ii .",
    "once we have fully validated our stochastic modelling approach , we will undertake a detailed study of the effects of stochastic sampling on the derivation of the ngc 5253 fundamental cluster parameters ( paper iii ) .",
    "this will have important consequences for our understanding of the system , given that many clusters have masses in the regime that is dominated by stochastic sampling effects .",
    "the current cluster parameters will then provide a very useful comparison data set .",
    "fig . [ agemass.fig ] shows the distribution of our final , well - fitted ngc 5253 star cluster sample ( of 149 objects ) in the diagnostic age ",
    "mass plane , as well as the age and mass distributions resulting from our ir - excess analysis .",
    "the cluster population is dominated by a significant number of relatively low - mass ( @xmath49 m@xmath2 ) objects .",
    "assuming fully sampled stellar mass functions , these objects have ages from a few @xmath3 to a few @xmath4 yr .",
    "this age range is in excellent agreement with the starburst age of the host galaxy , @xmath50 myr , and is confirmed by our age redeterminations based on the clusters h@xmath0 fluxes .",
    "our analysis has also revealed the presence of a small number of intermediate - age ( @xmath6 gyr - old ) , @xmath7 m@xmath2 clusters , as well as up to a dozen old clusters resembling true globular clusters ( gcs ) , in relation to both their ages ( @xmath8 gyr ) and masses ( @xmath51 m@xmath2 ) .",
    "we emphasize that our discovery of a small number of old gcs is secure .",
    "first , in our analysis we use a low metallicity of @xmath52 .",
    "it is expected that the oldest stellar population components in a given galaxy are characterized by the lowest metallicity , since they were formed at a time when there was little recycled gas in the interstellar medium .",
    "( this argument is valid under the assumption that these clusters formed in ngc 5253 and were not subsequently accreted ; see below . )",
    "our age estimates at the current low metallicity are already almost as old as the oldest ages in our ssp models , whereas at such old ages ssp models are quite insensitive to changes caused by metallicity differences . we confirmed that adopting an even lower metallicity will not result in a different conclusion .    in fig .",
    "[ agemass.fig ] , we have also indicated the expected detection ( 50 per cent completeness ) limit based on standard ssp analysis ( solid line ) ; the limit is a steeply increasing function of cluster mass with increasing age . although we did not set out to select a statistically complete sample of star clusters , it is satisfying to note that our sample clusters obey a similar , galaxy - wide average detection limit across the entire age range .",
    "we focus specifically on resolved yet compact clusters ( for which it is straightforward to obtain the integrated photometry and a generic completeness limit ) rather than on more dispersed stellar associations ( cf .",
    "annibali et al .",
    "this also enables a better comparison with previous studies of this galaxy , many of which were based on lower - resolution images than used in the present study .",
    "the selection of the final sample shown in fig .",
    "[ agemass.fig ] is governed by our observations with the lowest s / n .",
    "depending on the nature of the clusters ( i.e. , with or without an ir excess ) , the images with the lowest s / n are the f330w and the f222 m observations , respectively .",
    "the complex behaviour of the selection limit resulting from the data reduction and analysis steps , combined with the galaxy s highly variable background , renders determination of the ` true ' detection limit less than trivial .",
    "in addition , the effects of stochasticity will also play a role in the ( non-)detection of the clusters closest to the detection limit ( e.g. , silva - villa & larsen 2010 , 2011 ) . keeping in mind both of these issues , so that it is unrealistic to assign a single detection limit to the entire galaxy , the distribution of the data points in fig .",
    "[ agemass.fig ] implies that the _ average _ , galaxy - wide detection limit is @xmath53 mag ( @xmath54 mag ) , but we note that local variations , combined with the effects of stochasticity , could be up to 0.3 mag .    given the number and concentration of old gcs above our detection limit in the ngc 5253 data , we speculate that these are merely the surviving high - mass , high - luminosity clusters of an initially much larger population of clusters that formed around the time of galaxy formation , many of which may have been disrupted or naturally faded to below the detection limit because of stellar evolution .",
    "the young clusters are distributed in two narrow ` chimneys ' near @xmath55 and 7.2 , which are caused by the features in ssp models around that age ( cf . the ` wiggles ' in the ssp model used to indicate the selection limit in fig .",
    "[ agemass.fig ] ) , but are not necessarily associated with stochastic sampling of their mass functions . in reality , we would expect these clusters to be spread out more evenly across this young age range .",
    "the clusters in both chimneys are distributed randomly throughout the galaxy , similarly for objects with both @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "the yscs characterized by a clear ir excess are confined to the galaxy s main body ; the intermediate - age clusters in ngc 5253 , with ages @xmath58 , are found in the galaxy s outer region ( cf .",
    "harbeck et al .",
    "2012 ) , towards the south .",
    "finally , the complement of @xmath59 gyr - old clusters are predominantly located in the southeast of the main body of ngc 5253 ( cf .",
    "[ sources.fig ] ) . since our observational data reach similar depths across the galaxy ( except for the central region on the east featuring a wide dust lane )",
    ", we would have expected to detect such old massive clusters across the galaxy with a similar level of confidence . as such",
    ", we conclude that this spatial bias is likely real .",
    "if these clusters were moving on chaotic , freely tumbling orbits through the galaxy , one would have expected them to be well mixed on these long timescales .",
    "however , kobulnicky & skillman ( 1995 ) showed , based on observed hi gas dynamics , that the main body of the galaxy appears to be rotating as a solid body along the galaxy s _ major _ axis . under these circumstances , clusters that formed at one end of the gaseous central bar or disc , may have remained confined to a small area since the time of their formation .",
    "alternatively , the old clusters could have been accreted externally : to explain the galaxy s peculiar velocity field , kobulnicky & skillman ( 1995 ) also suggested that accretion of a low - metallicity , gas - rich companion galaxy on a higly inclined orbit is highly plausible ( but see davidge 2007 ) .",
    "this interpretation is supported by the unusual weakness of the galaxy s co emission , the morphology of the co gas and its unusual kinematic properties ( turner et al .",
    "1997 ) .",
    "we also note that almost all clusters affected by an @xmath60red excess , are found among the ysc population in clusters with masses @xmath61 m@xmath2 .",
    "adamo et al .",
    "( 2010a , b , 2011a , b ) identified two possible reasons for the occurrence of an ( infra-)red excess in more massive clusters in their sample bcg galaxies . for clusters younger than approximately 6 myr",
    ", they suggested that the ir excess could be due to diffuse , hot dust in which these yscs may still be embedded and/or a large fraction of young stellar objects and pre - main - sequence ( pms ) stars . in the optical @xmath62 band ( f814w ) ,",
    "the shallower red excess observed in such yscs may be owing to a dust photoluminescence bump in their seds at 0.70.9 @xmath63 m , often seen in the presence of very strong uv fields .",

    "these clusters , which they refer to as # 2 , 6 and 7 , form part of a more extensive population of intermediate - age and old clusters . from an initial focus on the galaxy s starburst core and its properties , more recent studies have attempted to explore the galaxy s overall star - formation history .",
    "the intermediate - age clusters of harbeck et al .",
    "( 2012 ) , as well as our larger population of intermediate - age and old clusters support the notion that ngc 5253 is a very active dwarf starburst galaxy that has undergone multiple episodes of star and star cluster formation ( see also calzetti et al .",
    "1997 and mcquinn et al .",

    "is generally flat , however , and does not show a clear peak at smaller sizes similar to what we find in this paper .",
    "this is likely caused by their cluster selection procedure , which was based on visual inspection of the acs images .",
    "in addition , we can not directly compare our cluster parameters derived in this paper with harbeck et al.s ( 2012 ) results , because both samples are complementary , without any spatial overlap .",
    "harris et al . ( 2004 ) also examined the ngc 5253 cluster sizes and include a figure showing their ( fwhm ) size distribution as a function of cluster magnitude .",
    "their size distribution is based on analysis of their f547 m image ( which is closest in wavelength to the f555w filter we used ) .",
    "the vast majority of their sample clusters have sizes which are similar to the psf size , with a small tail towards more extended clusters .",
    "although this trend is qualitiatively similar to our result , we point out that their size measurements were based on wfpc2/wf camera images , which have a factor of approximately 2 lower resolution than the acs / hrc images upon which we base our analysis .",
    "the bottom inset in fig .",
    "[ sizes.fig ] shows the equivalent figure for our data set , also using the f547 m magnitudes .",
    "the trend shown is similar to that found by harris et al .",
    "we re - emphasize here that we specifically selected objects that appeared compact , which implies that we selected against including stellar associations .",
    "finally , we consider the cluster size distribution in a wider context .",
    "bastian et al .",
    "( 2005 ) examined the effective radius ( @xmath79 ) distribution of their ysc sample in m51 and of the old gcs in the milky way .",
    "they represented the distribution by a power law of the form @xmath80 , and found best - fitting power - law indices of @xmath81 and @xmath82 for the m51 and milky way clusters , respectively .",

    ", we find a best - fitting power - law distribution of the clusters gaussian @xmath29 s characterized by @xmath84 , which agrees to within the uncertainties with these previous determinations  provided that there is a one - to - one correlation between @xmath85 and @xmath31 , which is a reasonable assumption if cluster profiles do not differ too significantly among galaxies .",
    "because of the wealth of available multi - wavelength data sets in the _ hst _ data archive , we chose ngc 5253 as target to compare two model approaches to determine fundamental star cluster parameters based on up - to - date input physics .",
    "we have gone significantly beyond previous studies of the ngc 5253 star cluster population .",
    "first , although we still used medium- , broad - band and h@xmath0 imaging observations , we base our results on the highest - achievable spatial resolution .",
    "the gain in resolution compared to previous studies is of order a factor of two in both dimensions , while our accessible wavelength range transcends previous studies by incorporation of both the nuv and nir passbands .",
    "crucially , this allows us to at least partially break the age ",
    "metallicity and age  extinction degeneracies .",
    "second , we applied two spectral synthesis methods to our _ hst _ observations in up to 10 filters , taking into account the updated effects of nebular emission and the improved physical understanding of the excess flux at red optical and ir wavelengths found for a subset of young clusters .",
    "we used the most recent models to explore the origin of excess emission of a fraction of the yscs in optical @xmath62 and longer - wavelength nir filters compared to ` standard ' ssp models , assuming fully sampled stellar mass functions .",
    "of the 182 objects in our sample with reliable photometry in at least 7 filters ( i.e. , uncertainties @xmath86 mag ) , we obtained best fits of sufficient quality ( i.e. , with sufficiently small @xmath87 and @xmath88 ) for 149 cluster candidates ; we discarded the remaining 33 objects from our final sample .",
    "of these 149 clusters , 30 were characterized by a clear ir excess , while the remaining 119 objects exhibited seds as expected for fully sampled clusters .",
    "we compared our derived cluster ages and masses based on application of our novel yggdrasil - based approach ( adamo et al .",
    "2010a , b , 2011a ,",
    "b ) with the results from application of galev+analysed sed matching .",
    "the main features in the overall age and mass distributions were well reproduced by both independent approaches . assuming a simple underlying gaussian distribution , the peak in the age distribution resulting from our galev+analysed analysis occurs at @xmath19 , with @xmath20 . for comparison ,",
    "the yggdrasil - based analysis returned @xmath21 , with @xmath22 . for the mass distributions ,",
    "we find @xmath23 versus 3.37 , and @xmath89 versus 0.77 , respectively .",
    "the ngc 5253 cluster population is dominated by a significant number of relatively low - mass ( @xmath90 m@xmath2 ) objects .",
    "assuming fully sampled stellar mass functions , they have ages ranging from a few @xmath3 to a few @xmath4 yr .",
    "this age range is in excellent agreement with the starburst age of the host galaxy ( @xmath50 myr ) .",
    "most of our ir - excess clusters are found in the younger ` chimney ' observed in the diagnostic age  mass plane based on our fully sampled ssp analysis , characterized by an age of @xmath91 yr and masses of up to a few @xmath5 m@xmath2 .",
    "the observational properties of these clusters are most likely affected by a combination of stochastic sampling effects and the presence of pms stars .",
    "the ir - excess clusters in the older chimney , at @xmath927.2 are also of relatively low mass and , hence , we expect them to be affected by stochastic sampling effects , while at this age the stochastic colour variations owing to luminous red stars ( including rsgs ) will also become apparent",
    ".    our analysis also revealed the presence of a small number of intermediate - age ( @xmath6 gyr - old ) , @xmath7 m@xmath2 clusters , as well as up to a dozen old clusters resembling true gcs , in relation to both their ages ( @xmath8 gyr ) and masses ( @xmath93 m@xmath2 ) .",
    "our detection of this fairly small number of true gcs is simply owing to selection effects and may not represent a genuine dearth of old , low - mass clusters in the galaxy .",
    "the presence of populations of young , intermediate - age and old clusters supports the notion that ngc 5253 is a very active dwarf starburst galaxy that has undergone multiple episodes of star cluster formation .",
    "the steeply increasing detection limit as a function of increasing age implies that even if there were large numbers of intermediate - age and old clusters of intermediate masses , we would not be able to detect them at the present time .",
