    "these new approaches have succeeded in significantly increasing the overall yield , but improvements in swcnt quality and control over chirality are still necessary , particularly when considering electrical and optical applications .    in a previous report  @xcite we presented an _ in situ _ optical absorbance measurement technique , by which the thickness of a va - swcnt film could be measured during growth . in the present study , we employ this real - time technique to investigate the growth dynamics of va - swcnts , and find that as growth progresses , the growth rate of the va - swcnts exponentially decreases from an initial maximum .",
    "we have also systematically investigated the temperature and pressure effects on the initial film growth rate , and find the optimum growth pressure changes with the cvd temperature .",
    "below this optimum pressure the growth reaction is first - order , with the arrival of ethanol at the catalyst being the rate - limiting step .",
    "these new findings are important in clarifying the processes governing the growth reaction .",

  "abstract_text": [
    "<S> an _ in situ _ optical absorbance measurement was used to study the growth dynamics of vertically aligned single - walled carbon nanotubes ( va - swcnts ) synthesized by chemical vapor deposition of ethanol . </S>",
    "<S> the growth rate of the va - swcnt film was found to decay exponentially from an initial maximum , resulting in an effective growth time of approximately 15 minutes . </S>",
    "<S> investigation of various growth conditions revealed an optimum pressure at which growth is maximized , and this pressure depends on the growth temperature . </S>",
    "<S> below this optimum pressure the synthesis reaction is first - order , and the rate - limiting step is the arrival of ethanol at the catalyst . </S>",
    "<S> we also present a novel method for determining the burning temperature of low - mass materials , which combines the _ in situ _ absorbance measurement with controlled oxidation .    </S>",
