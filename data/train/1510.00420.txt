    "evidences of the influence of weak electromagnetic fields including magnetic fields on many living organisms are abound @xcite .",
    "most spectacular and doubtless of such manifestations are related to navigation of honeybees , fishes , birds , rats , bats , and other animals @xcite in the magnetic field of earth of about @xmath0 in strength .",
    "various hypotheses related to profoundly different physical mechanisms have been suggested to explain this influence .",
    "they range from non - thermal quantum mechanisms related to spin - dependent electron transfer @xcite , which circumvent the so - called `` kt '' problem @xcite , to a variety of classical mechanisms based on a widespread occurrence of biomagnetite nanoparticles in tissues of many living organisms starting from magnetotactic bacteria @xcite and ending by the human brain @xcite . magnetite ( @xmath1 ) has a saturation magnetization of @xmath2 a / m , and elongated magnetite nanoparticles are in a single domain ferrimagnetic state when their sizes range from 20 nm to 200 nm depending on the short - to - long axis aspect ratio ( shape factor ) @xcite .",
    "hence , magnetic energy of a spherical magnetosome ( magnetic nanoparticle dressed in a lipid - protein membrane shell @xcite ) of the radius 100 nm with magnetic dipole moment @xmath3 is as large as @xmath4 , when its magnetic moment is aligned with the earth magnetic field .",
    "the whole cells with magnetic moments in the range @xmath5 were identified recently as candidate magnetoreceptor cells in trout olfactory epithelium @xcite .",
    "another recent study @xcite confirms the existence of cells possessing such large magnetic moments both in trouts and pigeons .",
    "however , it expresses doubts that this magnetic moment is caused by biomagnetite , and not by magnetic nanoparticles polluting environment , which are absorbed to the cell membranes . in this respect , the presence of iron - rich organelles filled by ferrihydrate in the hair cells of pigeons @xcite can spell out in support of biological origin of magnetite therein , rather than on contrary .",
    "even though the biochemical pathway of biomagnetite synthesis remains still controversial @xcite , the presence of ferrihydrate indirectly supports one of biochemical schemes earlier suggested @xcite .",
    "furthermore , about 10% of biomagnetite particles found in human brain @xcite ( about @xmath6 or even @xmath7 per one gram of tissue in grey matter and in meninges , correspondingly , and about 50 ng / g in hippocampus on average @xcite ) are about or larger than 100 nm in size . in bacteria",
    ", the length of elongated magnetoparticles can reach @xmath8 nm with shape factor @xmath9 @xcite and even larger , up to 200 nm @xcite .",
    "important is that genes encoding magnetosome specific proteins in some bacteria were identified @xcite .",
    "this provides one of the strongest argumentation in the favor of biological origin of magnetite in biological cells .",
    "importantly , the magnitude of own magnetic field produced by a spherical magnetosome can reach ( at peak of a highly anisotropic distribution ) @xmath10 near to its surface ( see in appendix [ append1 ] ) , independently of its radius .",
    "this is about @xmath11 larger than @xmath12 .",
    "thus , quantum magnetic effects can also be mediated by the magnetic near - field of a magnetosome reorienting in external magnetic field and positioned nearby an electron - transferring magneto - sensitive molecular complex , rather than directly by an external field itself @xcite .",
    "the particles of intermediate size @xmath13 nm , typical for magnetosomes met in magnetotactic bacteria @xcite have @xmath14 , and they easily make chains joined by magnetic cohesion force , being rigid enough @xcite in not too strong magnetic fields , smaller than @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "hence , a rod consisting of 5 such nanoparticles with magnetic moments aligned has @xmath16 , and it can easily serve as a quite classical , compass - like sensor element for magneto - sensitive ion channels , as it will be shown in this paper .",
    "when external field becomes compatible with @xmath17 it can disrupt the magnetosome chain , or make it unstable @xcite .",
    "this is why such a sensor will not work in too strong fields .",
    "it will be literally broken in pieces , presenting a disordered cluster of nanoparticles .",
    "for another typical size @xmath18 nm also commonly met in bacteria @xcite , @xmath19 for a single magnetosome . hence , sensor can consist also of a single nanoparticle .",
    "the idea that a magnetic nanorod can serve as a sensor and transducer of magnetic field torque has been first suggested by yorke @xcite .",
    "kirschvink @xcite proposed that it can be a magnetosensitive ion channel involved with a spherical magnetosome attached to a cytoskeleton element nearby an ion channel in biological membrane and coupled by an elastic linker to the ion channel gating machinery .",
    "external magnetic field creates a torque on the magnetosome , which rotates and opens the ion channel .",
    "the sensor is considered to be essentially monostable in the kirschvink model .",
    "this model has been refined recently for the chain of magnetosomes serving as sensor @xcite , but remained monostable as in the original proposal .",
    "binhi and chernavsky proposed a different model @xcite , based on bistability of magnetosome rotations induced by magnetic field for a spherical magnetosome elastically coupled to cytoskeleton .",
    "it is not related to gating of ionic channels .",
    "rather a change in distribution of the magnetic field induced by magnetosome is of interest , in the context of a related quantum mechanism @xcite .",
    "furthermore , it has been shown recently that streptavidin - linked magnetite nanoparticles of @xmath20 nm size ( in radius on average ) can induce ion channel like activity being absorbed on phospholipid bilayer @xcite .",
    "the corresponding ion current recordings remind somewhat the ion channel activity induced in electric fields by alamethicin peptides inserted into the membrane @xcite .    in this paper",
    "a further generalization of the model by kirschvink _",
    "is suggested and studied .",
    "the generalization consists in several profound aspects .",
    "first , stochastic motion of sensor is considered to be bistable because of bistability of ion channel gate to which the sensor is coupled .",
    "such a bistability is a common point in describing stochastic dynamics of ionic channels @xcite . to include it in the sensor dynamics we adopt a gating spring model @xcite assuming that the gate can take on just two conformations , open and closed .",
    "similar model has originally been suggested in relation to the hair cell dynamics .",
    "second , we consider a possibility that magnetic sensor can be coupled to gates of several ionic channels making a cluster , i.e. that a compact cluster of ionic channels and a magnetic nanoparticle serving as sensor make a magneto - sensitive complex in biological membrane .",
    "this can explain why such magnetosensitive ion channels , as separate units , were not found thus far .",
    "third , and most important in a more general context of gating stochastic dynamics of ionic channels : we consider the influence of viscoelasticity of the environment in which sensor is moving on the sensor dynamics .",
    "we show that viscoelasticity alone can result in profoundly non - exponential residence time distributions of the channels in their open and closed states such as stretched exponential distribution @xcite and power law distributions @xcite .",
    "this explanation of unusual gating kinetics is different from other physical theories suggested thus far which are based , in particular , on a complex free energy landscape for sensor or conformational dynamics of the whole ion channel with huge many multiply degenerated minima and maxima ( glassy like dynamics ) @xcite .",
    "the latter one can be modeled in a simplest possible fashion as a continuous normal diffusion in a potential box , which already allows to explain @xcite the origin of @xmath21 power law in the distribution of closed times @xcite in conjunction with the origin of hodgkin - huxley voltage dependence @xcite",
    ". such normal diffusion can become also anomalously slow ( fractional diffusion )  a modeling pathway explored in @xcite .",
    "recent work @xcite suggests , however , that the discussed anomalous kinetics can also result from standard bistable dynamics of sensor , commonly assumed in biophysics textbooks @xcite , as a result of memory effects caused by viscoelasticity of the environment .",
    "this is a very appealing and simple physical explanation indeed . in this respect ,",
    "both cytosol and plasma membrane are viscoelastic @xcite .",
    "hence viscoelasticity is considered as a major cause of experimentally observed anomalous diffusion in crowded colloidal and polymer solutions @xcite , and living cells @xcite , as well as in single protein molecules @xcite . to study such effects",
    ", the approach of generalized langevin equation ( gle ) characterized by a power law scaling memory kernel and power law correlated thermal noise of environment , which are related by fluctuation - dissipation theorem ( fdt ) , provides a major well - established theoretical framework in the case of linear dynamics @xcite .",
    "it is not easy to generalize this framework towards nonlinear dynamics in bi- and multistable potentials .",
    "for example , a corresponding _ exact _ fokker - planck description which would mirror and complement the gle approach , like in the case of memoryless dynamics , is simply not developed thus far for potentials other than linear and parabolic @xcite .",
    "in other words , any nonlinearity creates a problem for fokker - planck description of such a dynamics with memory @xcite .",
    "recently , we bypassed such difficulties within the gle approach using the road of multi - dimensional markovian embedding of gle dynamics within a generalized maxwell - langevin model of viscoelasticity @xcite",
    ". it has also been generalized to include negative correlations of stochastic force and corresponding memory effects leading to superdiffusion and supertransport @xcite .",
    "the utility of this approach has been demonstrated on various basic models of nonlinear stochastic dynamics such as bistable dynamics @xcite , washboard dynamics @xcite , anomalous rocking ratchets @xcite , anomalous flashing ratchets @xcite , and also in applications to molecular motor dynamics in viscoelastic cytosol @xcite .    in the context of magnetosomes dynamics in viscoelastic cytosol kirschvink _",
    "have repeatedly taken the cytosol influence into account by enhancement of the coefficient of _ normal _ viscous friction experienced by magnetosome by a factor of about @xmath22 @xcite .",
    "this was a standard way to think about influence of viscoelasticity and crowding in cytosol in biological applications until recently @xcite .",
    "however , recent results on anomalous diffusion of nano- and submicron particles in living cells suggest that this enhancement can be much larger , of the order of @xmath23 , and even larger @xcite , depending , in particular , on the size of particle @xcite .",
    "cytosol seem to normally operate at the edge of a phase transition from liquid - like state to a solid - like state with broken ergodicity @xcite",
    ". moreover , even for the enhancement factor @xmath22 the bistable orientational dynamics of magnetic nanoparticles would be so slow , as we show in this paper , that it would be completely out of interest within a biological context .",
    "however , a major effect , which introduces viscoelasticity , is emergence of transient subdiffusion which is much faster than the asymptotic limit of normal diffusion .",
    "in fact , this asymptotic regime can become completely irrelevant for mesoscopic dynamics .",
    "this paradoxical fact also follows from the non - markovian rate theory developed beyond the standard memoryless kramers theory @xcite , see @xcite for a review , and below . namely this `` much faster , not slower '' @xcite , paradoxically due to subdiffusion , makes operating of such bistable magnetic sensors possible in viscoelastic cytosol .",
    "this provides one of most important results of this work , which lends a further support to the idea of magnetic field sensing with classical dynamics of sufficiently large biomagnetite nanoparticles .",
    "we consider the following model . biomagnetite rod made of a chain of magnetosomes of total length @xmath24 , or a single elongated magnetic nanoparticle",
    "can rotate with one end fixed e.g. on on a cytoskeleton meshwork attached to the cell membrane inside the cell ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] for an idea ) .",
    "it is also elastically attached to the gates of ionic channels ( one is shown ) by flexible linkers , which are modeled here within a finite extensible nonlinear elastic ( fene ) model @xcite .",
    "the channel gate or rather a molecular latch , which fixes the gate in its either open or closed state , can be in two states .",
    "the closed state is characterized by the energy @xmath25 , and the open one has the energy @xmath26 , which depends on the linker elongation @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is a force constant characterizing the strength of coupling ( force exerted by the linker on the gate ) .",
    "elastic energy is @xmath29 within fene model , where @xmath30 is elastic spring constant , and @xmath31 is the maximal extension length of the linker , when it is fully stretched .",
    "statistical mean force exerted by the channel gate on the linker can be found as @xmath32 from the potential of mean force @xmath33 , where @xmath34 + \\exp[-\\beta(\\epsilon_2-f_0x)]$ ] is the statistical sum of gate , and @xmath35 is inverse temperature . here",
    ", one implicitly assumes that the own gate / latch dynamics ( transitions between two states ) is very fast , and , hence the actual gating dynamics is enslaved by the sensor dynamics and reflects the latter one .",

    "the motion of rod is assumed to be restricted to the plane orthogonal to the membrane , and characterized by the angle @xmath41 , @xmath42 counted from the membrane plane in the counter - clockwise direction .",
    "the linker elongation is approximated as @xmath43 $ ] , where @xmath44 is the rotation arm , and @xmath45 is an equilibrium angle .",
    "the external magnetic field @xmath46 is directed at the angle @xmath47 within the plane of motion .",

    "we shall scale the energy in units of @xmath52 , temperature in the units of @xmath53 , distances in units of @xmath44 , and forces in units of @xmath54 .",
    "@xmath55 will be fixed to @xmath56 , where @xmath57 is a typical room temperature , @xmath58 k. for a typical @xmath59 @xcite , this corresponds to @xmath60 nm and force units @xmath61 pn . for the purpose of illustration , magnetic nanorod",
    "is assumed to be made of magnetosomes of size @xmath62 . for the magnetosome core made of magnetite with saturating magnetization of @xmath63 ka / m",
    "its elementary magnetic moment is @xmath64 and its energy in the magnetic field of earth taken to be @xmath65 is @xmath66 , when it is aligned with the field direction . the sensor can be operable already for @xmath67 nanoparticles in the rod with @xmath68 , and a reliable operation can be achieved for @xmath69 with @xmath70 .",
    "for these two values we shall do illustrative calculations below , noting , however , once again that the sensor can consist also of just one sufficiently large ferro- or ferrimagnetic nanoparticle .",
    "for example , a particle with the size @xmath71 will have about the same @xmath72 as our rod with @xmath69 , and such nanoparticles are also customly found in living species .",
    "some examples of @xmath73 for various magnetic energies and the corresponding @xmath74 are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] .",
    "consider first the @xmath75 case ( full line ) , and notice , that when @xmath73 arrives at its maximum at @xmath76 , @xmath77 .",
    "for @xmath78 , a further increase of @xmath41 introduces a negative stiffness instability and the rod rotates to a new metastable minimum at @xmath79 , where the channel opening probability becomes @xmath80 . at the first metastable minimum , @xmath81 , @xmath82 .",
    "the corresponding energy differences between two metastable minima is @xmath83 , and the energy barriers are @xmath84 , and @xmath85 .",
    "being attached to a common sensor the channels will fluctuate stochastically but synchronously between their closed and open states following the sensor motion , with the averaged opening probability which can be roughly estimated as @xmath86\\approx 0.026 $ ] ( at room temperatures ) , i.e. the channels are closed most of time . actually , the opening probability will be lower that this rough estimate because the first minimum is shallower that the second one , i.e. it is also entropically preferred . judging from the value of @xmath87 , one can expect that for a sufficiently strong magnetic field at a proper angle @xmath47 such that @xmath88 , the second metastable minimum can be made lower relative the first one and the channel will become open on average .",
    "indeed , this is the case already for @xmath89 at @xmath90 , see fig .",
    "the entropic effects may , however , compensate somewhat for the field - induced negative @xmath87 , and the channels are indeed about half - open on average , see below . for a larger @xmath91 in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , the channels will predominantly be open .",
    "the averaged probability of the channel to be open can be found as @xmath92 where @xmath93 is the corresponding statistical sum ( integral ) .",
    "it accounts also for entropic effects .",
    "unfortunately , this expression can not be found in a closed compact analytic form for the model considered .",
    "however , its numerical evaluation can be easily done .",
    "the corresponding results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] and reveal that the direction of magnetic field can be detected by a bell - shaped increase of the opening probability within the angle @xmath94 . further sharpening of the detection of the field direction can be achieved via an adjusted threshold of excitation in the sensory cell .",
    "the averaged ionic current conducted by this sensory complex is thus @xmath95 , where @xmath96 is unitary current through one open channel .",
    "let us estimate it as @xmath97 being a typical value for large conductance cation channels @xcite .",
    "these should be either sodium , or calcium channels in order to cause depolarization of the cell membrane by their opening , given typically small out - of - equilibrium innercell concentrations of sodium and calcium ions with respect to the cell exterior . then , for @xmath98 and @xmath99 , @xmath100 .",
    "estimating the whole cell membrane resistance at rest as @xmath101 @xcite , the transmembrane potential change is estimated as @xmath102 mv .",
    "this can already be sufficient to depolarize an excitable cell membrane and to trigger a spiking activity mediating further information about external magnetic field changes .",
    "however , a detailed elaboration of related excitable cell model in the spirit of the hodgkin - huxley type conductances based approach is beyond the scope of the present work and is left for a future .      in order to operate as sensor",
    ", the opening - closing stochastic dynamics of the considered magnetic sensor should also be sufficiently fast .",
    "clearly , if it would take minutes on average to accomplish transitions to the open state , such a sensor would simply be too slow to be of any relevance in biology .",
    "the motion of sensor occurs in viscoelastic cytosol .",
    "it is considered to be overdamped with the inertial effects neglected .",
    "apart from the mean torque @xmath103 , it is subjected to viscoelastic memory - friction torque @xmath104 , which acts in addition to the viscous stokes friction torque , @xmath105 , caused by the primary water component of cytosol .",
    "the dissipative forces are complemented by the corresponding zero - mean gaussian thermal random noises of the environment at temperature @xmath106 , @xmath107 and @xmath108 , correspondingly .",
    "the friction and thermal noise are related by the ( second ) fluctuation - dissipation theorem ( fdt ) by kubo @xcite @xmath109 this ensures thermal detailed balance in the absence of external driving .",
    "stochastic dynamics is described by the generalized langevin equation ( gle ) @xcite @xmath110 the memory kernel reflecting viscoelasticity of complex polymeric fluids such as cytosol has often intermediate power law scaling @xmath111 , between two memory cutoffs , @xmath112 and @xmath113 , with @xmath114 .",

    "@xmath116 is a fractional friction coefficient @xcite corresponding to a fractional viscosity coefficient @xmath117 @xcite , @xmath118 .",
    "a strict power law is clearly an idealization and cutoffs must be present on physical grounds .",
    "the short time cutoff @xmath112 reflects molecular size effects or highest vibrational modes present in the environment ( which can not be captured by any continuous medium type approximation ) .",
    "the long time cutoff @xmath113 must also be present in any fluid - like environment making the overall integral @xmath119 finite .",
    "this reflects a finite macroscopic viscosity @xmath120 of such complex fluids on a large time scale @xmath121 .",
    "the model with @xmath122 , @xmath123 ( strict power law scaling ) corresponds to the so - called fractional langevin equation ( fle ) upon using the formalism of fractional time derivatives @xcite , or a strict sub - ohmic memory friction within dynamical approach to generalized brownian motion @xcite .",
    "then , the solution of a potential - free fle ( [ gle ] ) , @xmath124 , with the stokes friction neglected , @xmath125 , and for @xmath41 regarded as a linear , rather than cyclic variable , is fractional brownian motion ( fbm ) @xcite .",

    "this is , in fact , a generic feature of the gating spring model , which is not related in principle to viscoelasticity or nonlinear elastic effects .",
    "however , this fundamental feature has also been overlooked earlier . in our model , the value @xmath434 when the channel is half - open belongs to the attraction domain of sensor open state , rather than to the potential barrier ( transient state ) separating two domains of attraction , and the barrier value @xmath435 can be as small as @xmath436 , depending on @xmath292 and @xmath47 . even in the markovian memoryless case",
    ", this leads to a profoundly bursting character of the ion current recordings reflecting @xmath437 fluctuations within the open state of sensor , see in fig .",
    "theorists can believe that the most rigorous way to calculate the residence time distributions in open and closed states of channel is to use the detection thresholds placed at the minima of @xmath73 . for a purely markovian dynamics",
    "such a procedure leads to single - exponential distributions of residence times of _ sensor _ , see fig .",

    "[ fig5 ] , an experimentalist is expected to put one detection threshold at @xmath287 and another one somewhere at @xmath288 @xcite , e.g. at @xmath276 , as in our fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] ( d ) and fig .",

    "[ fig6 ] ( d ) , and @xmath439 in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] ( d ) , within the main power law regimes .",

    "[ fig6 ] ( d ) is , however , not that good , and a pareto law fit the same weight @xmath443 and @xmath444 is visually better .",
    "this happened clearly by chance , in a very particular case .",

    "[ fig6 ] ( a ) , ( b ) one can see that there generally exists an exponential tail with a time constant which roughly corresponds to @xmath445 in fig .",

    "the open times are nearly exponentially distributed in all parts of figs .",
    "[ fig6 ] , [ fig7 ] , with the time constants which depend strongly on the threshold choice .",
    "important is that even if the mean residence times and the detailed structure of survival probabilities do strongly depend on the choice of thresholds , the time averaged portion of open time @xmath447 is not changed dramatically .",
    "its value approximately corresponds to the ensemble average depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] at @xmath90 .",
    "this implies not only ergodicity , but also that a two - state reduction of continuous state dynamics is a reasonable one . with @xmath176 msec and @xmath179 msec estimated for the rods consisting of @xmath67 and @xmath69 magnetosomes ,",
    "correspondingly ( see in appendix [ append ] ) one has @xmath448 msec and @xmath449 msec in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] ( d ) , as well as @xmath450 msec and @xmath451 msec in fig .",

    "these are typical time scales for ion channel gating dynamics . however , with the bursts neglected the characteristic times lie in the hundreds of milliseconds range , which defines a characteristic time scale of the reaction of such a detector on changes of external magnetic field .",
    "furthermore , even in the absence of memory effects our model can explain the origin of power law distributions of closed times , @xmath452 , with @xmath453 in some range around @xmath454 , as our numerical results imply .",
    "similar bursting fluctuations with @xmath455 and exponentially distributed open times were indeed found in the locust large conductance bk channels @xcite .",
    "a proper generalization for bk channels is , however , out of the scope of this work .",
    "it is reserved for a future . in this respect",
    ", one should mention that a very different phenomenological model was suggested earlier to rationalize bistable dynamics of bk channels in terms of a fractional conformational dynamics @xcite .",
    "our sensor operates , however , in viscoelastic cytosol , and a common line of reasoning is to account for the enlarged effective cytosol viscosity by using @xmath335 instead of @xmath456 within a markovian langevin dynamics @xcite .",
    "this would mean the enlargement of @xmath338 and the corresponding @xmath445 and @xmath457 by about the same factor .",
    "then , already for @xmath458 @xcite the mean opening and closing times would become so large that such a magnetosensitive channel could not be of any potential relevance as biosensor",
    ". it would be far too slow .",
    "however , our results obtained by a proper treatment of non - markovian memory effects show that such simplistic estimations can be very misleading .",
    "our model channel can yet be functional in viscoelastic environment .",
    "it must be stressed that @xmath335 can only be finite , if subdiffusion is transient and normal diffusion is established again for @xmath459 .",

    "by comparison of the results in fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] ( a ) with the corresponding markovian case depicted in fig .",

    "also the initial pareto law regime for the closed times is almost not affected in fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] ( a ) .",
    "this is because non - markovian memory effects are still not at play on the relevant time scale smaller than @xmath165 of free subdiffusion .",

    "the latter feature is , however , not universally valid , see below , because ( i ) @xmath464 is strongly influenced by @xmath335 at fixed @xmath353 , and ( ii ) the transition from initially normal dynamics to subdiffusional is also strongly affected by the presence of potential .",
    "furthermore , the tails of distributions are changed dramatically .",
    "they became stretched exponential , in agreement with @xcite , as a major manifestation of viscoelastic effects .",
    "the stretched exponential tail of the closed time distribution describes the distribution of interburst time intervals , as it can be understood from fig .",

    "the distribution of both open and closed times is almost stretched exponential in fig .",

    "[ fig10 ] ( a ) one observes similar features by comparison with fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] ( d ) : the mean residence times are about the same ( within typical numerical error margins ) , and the exponential tails turn into the stretched exponential ones .",

    "the observed features provide a general physical explanation for the emergence of stretched exponential distributions in the statistics of ion channel fluctuations , as observed first by liebovitch _",
    "our theory explains it as a manifestation of viscoelastic memory effects for the sensor dynamics in cytosol .",
    "this explanation is rather general .",
    "it is expected to hold also for other models of ion channel gating dynamics with sensor moving within the membrane , or within the membrane protein itself .",
    "one should stress that the discussed results for fixed values of @xmath335 and @xmath353 are not expected to visibly change , if we enlarge @xmath353 and @xmath335 so that @xmath116 is not changed .",
    "this is because the main features we discuss are observed for the time intervals less than @xmath353 in our figures .",
    "a typical length of single stochastic trajectories used to obtain these figures exceeds greatly @xmath353 , and the diffusion becomes again normal on that time scale .",
    "what does matter indeed is the anomaly of diffusion caused by the memory of viscoelastic medium on the relevant time scales of transitions .",
    "for example , if we enhance @xmath353 by a factor of 100 ( using two additional auxiliary brownian particles in our simulations ) , and enhance @xmath335 by the factor of @xmath465 ( for the used @xmath216 ) , @xmath396 is not changed , and we do not expect any significant changes of the results discussed . however , if we increase @xmath335 by the factor of ten at the same @xmath353 , @xmath396 is tenfold increased , and this results into the further qualitative changes observed .",
    "what does matter indeed even for a finite @xmath353 is the fractional friction coefficient @xmath396 .",
    "indeed , for @xmath347 with the same @xmath353 , the qualitatively new additional features are observed in the part ( b ) of figs .",
    "[ fig9 ] , [ fig10 ] , see also in figs . 1 ( b ) and 2 ( b ) of supplement @xcite .",

    "however , in figs .",
    "[ fig9 ] ( b ) and [ fig11 ] ( b ) they are a little increased ( less than doubled ) . hence , the gating dynamics of our model channel remains in a physiologically acceptable range .",
    "such a sensor would slowly operate , yet be suitable to detect quasi - static or slowly changing magnetic fields .",
    "we see also how intermediate power law distributions can emerge naturally due to viscoelastic memory effects .",
    "clearly , our theoretical approach is not restricted by a particular model of magnetosensitive ion channels we proposed and studied in this work .",
    "in this paper we proposed and studied a novel model of magnetosensitive ion channels featured by a bistable magnetosensor moving in viscoelastic cytosol . it is shown that a cluster of ionic channels gated by such a sensor can operate for realistic parameters and provide a tentative explanation for biological manifestations of the influence of weak magnetic fields , in particular , such as navigation of different biological species in the magnetic field of earth , as suggested earlier by kirschvink _",
    "et al_. our model provides also a natural explanation of the origin of stretched exponential and power law distributions in the statistics of ion current fluctuations as ones caused by the viscoelasticity of the medium in which the sensor operates .",

    "larger spherical particles do not possess a permanent magnetic moment .",
    "they are in a multidomain superparamagnetic state . however ,",
    "if the particle is elongated it can still be in a ferrimagnetic state at ambient temperatures .",
    "next , the preferable direction of the magnetic moment is not completely fixed by the magnetic anisotropy of @xmath1 crystal , and the form of particle .",
    "thermally agitated it can flip its direction to the opposite one , i.e. small nanoparticles are in fact intrinsically bistable . the corresponding thermal magnetic reorientation time ( neel relaxation time )",

    "years , i.e. a metastable state can be considered as physically stable from a practical point of view . furthermore , physical anisotropy of nanoparticle , e.g. an elongated ellipsoidal form , or the form of a rectangular parallelepiped further stabilizes the single domain structure .",
    "many biomagnetite particles have proper sizes to be in the ferrimagnetic state .",
    "typical sizes considered in this paper ensure ferrimagnetic state at room and physiological temperatures .",
