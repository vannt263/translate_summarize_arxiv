    ", we have an evaluation of the truncated sum for @xmath47 @xmath48    the outline of this paper is as follows . in section 2",

    "in section 3 , based on two duality relations , we shall prove a generalized form .",
    "we obtain a simple relation by starting with a special truncated sum in section 4 and give a remark in the final section .",
    "for different purposes , different factors such as @xmath49 are attached to iterated integral representations of multiple zeta values to produce new multiple zeta values when differentiating with respect to the parameters .",
    "for example , the iterated integral @xmath50 obtained from the iterated integral of @xmath51 with the additional factor @xmath52 and it can be evaluated as @xmath53 in a similar manner we have for positive integer @xmath21 and @xmath22 @xmath54^{-1}k_p^{-q}. \\end{split}\\ ] ]    on the other hand , we add extra factors such as @xmath55 with @xmath56 integers to iterated integrals of multiple zeta values to produce sums of multiple zeta values of different weights . for examples , @xmath57 and @xmath58    here we consider a special multiple zeta value with a parameter @xmath59 and an additional factor related to the multiple zeta value @xmath60 . it is defined as @xmath61 and it can be evaluated as @xmath62^{-1}(k_p+r)^{-q}. \\end{split}\\ ] ]    now we are ready to prove our main theorem .",

    "@xmath65 and @xmath66 , we express the iterated integral as the double integral @xmath67 under the change of variables : @xmath68 the double integral is transformed into @xmath69 where @xmath70 now exchange @xmath71 to yield the double integral with the same value @xmath72 with the same change of variables @xmath73 we conclude that @xmath74    in light of the expression @xmath75 the double integral in the right hand side of ( [ eq2.2 ] ) can be evaluated as @xmath76 this leads to the identity @xmath77^{-1}(k_p+r)^{-q}\\\\ = & \\frac{1}{r!}\\sum_{t_{\\bm{\\ell}}(q)}\\frac{\\ell_1(\\ell_1 + 1)\\cdots ( \\ell_1+r-1)}{(\\ell_1+a)(\\ell_2+a)\\cdots ( \\ell_q+a)}\\sum_{j=0}^r ( -1)^j \\binom{r}{j } ( \\ell_q+j)^{-p}. \\end{split}\\ ] ] differentiating both sides of the above identity with respect to @xmath59 for @xmath15 times , we obtain our assertion .",
    "taking @xmath78 into ( [ eq1.3 ] ) and then letting @xmath79 , we get the special case of the duality and sum formula ( [ eq1.1 ] ) .",
    "so the equation ( [ eq1.3 ] ) can be viewed as a general identity of the special case of ohno s theorem .",
    "for nonnegative integers @xmath18 , the restricted sum formula @xcite asserted that @xmath80 there is another duality among restricted sums @xcite @xmath81 by proposition [ prop1.2 ] , the above relation is given by @xmath82 we now prove further .",

    "this proves the equality of @xmath93 and @xmath94 .",
    "on the other hand , we note that exchange @xmath95 and @xmath96 in ( [ int1 ] ) to yield the double integral of the same value @xmath97 this corresponds to the following double integral @xmath98 after making the change of variables : @xmath99 in terms of multiple zeta values , it is equal to ( [ eq3.3 ] ) .    in summary , in the proof of above theorem , we obtain that @xmath100    the parameter @xmath15 here can be a real number so that we can perform differentiations with respect to @xmath15 to produce more general identities concerning duality .",

    "when multiple zeta values are expressed as iterated integrals , most of duality theorems of multiple zeta values are obtained from the change of variables : @xmath113 or componentwise @xmath114 this also includes multiple zeta values or sums of multiple zeta values expressed as double integrals .",
    "for example , we have @xmath115 on the other hand , when multiple zeta values or sums of multiple zeta values are expressed in double integrals , the change of variables @xmath116 or @xmath117 provides an alternative way to obtain the duals .",
