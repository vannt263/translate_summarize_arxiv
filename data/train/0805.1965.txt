    "the lhc is expected to shed light on the origin of electroweak symmetry breaking .",
    "there is less expectation with regard to the flavor puzzle and the origin of the quark and lepton mass spectrum .",
    "this is because the latter is usually encoded in a set of yukawa couplings whose origins are typically expected to lie far beyond the scale of electroweak symmetry breaking . in this sense",
    "the belief in the existence of an elementary scalar field , the higgs boson , drastically reduces our hopes for new understanding about flavor .",
    "the picture is very different in the absence of elementary scalar fields . in this case",
    "the physics of flavor will likely have to be understood in terms of the dynamics of gauge theories .",
    "after all , nature provides an example of the dynamical breaking of chiral symmetries and the generation of mass with qcd .",
    "if we take the hint then we should consider the possibility of gauged flavor symmetries which are dynamically broken .",
    "in addition to the broken electroweak gauge symmetries , we have in mind more badly broken gauge symmetries that connect different families to each other .",
    "these interactions can serve to feed down mass from the heaviest fermions to the lighter ones .",
    "the physics of flavor will be characterized by scales that range from a tev up to at least several hundred tev , and these scales will be in some inverse relation to the masses of the fermions that are generated by the respective interaction .",
    "besides the small masses that the light quark and leptons receive , other effects of new flavor physics on the lightest fermions are highly suppressed .",
    "many such effects are characterized by effective 4-fermion operators , but in the case of the three light neutrinos their masses may have to arise from 6-fermion operators .",
    "the existence of neutrino masses in the sub - ev range then turns out to be an independent indication of flavor physics below 1000 tev .",
    "the lightest of the new interactions couples to the heaviest fermions and in this case the mass scale of the interaction and the fermion may be similar .",
    "in addition the heaviest fermion masses should be expected to serve as the primary order parameters for electroweak symmetry breaking .",
    "the most trivial way to accommodate this union of flavor and ewsb is to extend the known flavor structure of the standard model by adding a sequential fourth family , which will contain these heaviest fermions .",
    "we suppose then that the last remaining remnant of the flavor gauge symmetry exists down to roughly a tev .",
    "we assume that this flavor interaction is strong and that it plays some role in electroweak symmetry breaking . there may be no need for a new unbroken gauge symmetry underlying ewsb , such as technicolor .",
    "such a picture would constitute the most economical joining of flavor and ewsb physics , and thus it is interesting to consider its experimental implications .",
    "clearly , the lightest of the flavor gauge bosons should couple to the fourth family .",
    "we will focus on such a gauge boson associated with a diagonal generator of some original flavor gauge group , and call it the @xmath0 boson @xcite .",
    "of most interest to us is the likely coupling of the @xmath0 boson to the third family as well .",
    "the main reason for this coupling is that this is the simplest way to cancel the gauge anomalies involving the @xmath0 and the electroweak gauge bosons , by having the @xmath0 charges of the third and fourth families being equal and opposite .",
    "this is another link between four families and the @xmath0 boson . with such couplings",
    "it is nevertheless still possible that the complete flavor dynamics results in only one of the two heavy families receiving the main electroweak symmetry breaking mass .",
    "the top quark mass must reflect the presence of @xmath4 breaking physics at a higher scale , and a particular 4-fermion operator can feed mass from the @xmath5 to the @xmath6 while reducing the impact on the @xmath7 parameter @xcite .",
    "we have thus sketched a particular justification for the existence of a new massive gauge boson coupling to the third family .",
    "our assumption of the simplest possible flavor structure , along with the simplest cancellation of gauge anomalies , implies that the @xmath0 boson couples with equal strength @xmath8 to all members of the third family . the fact that it couples to both the @xmath9 quark and",
    "the @xmath10 will lead to our search strategy .",
    "thus our analysis will apply to any other scenario having a new massive gauge boson with this basic property .",
    "we stress that the observation of such a gauge boson , nearly decoupled from the two lightest families , would open up a new window onto the physics of flavor .",
    "although there has been much attention focussed on signals of new massive gauge bosons ( often referred to as @xmath11 s ) at the lhc , these studies usually involve family universal couplings .",
    "our interest is instead with nontrivial flavor physics that is connected with origin of the sequential family structure of nature , and for this we need to see family nonuniversal physics .    to calculate the width of the @xmath0 boson we assume for now that it decays by pair production to all members of the third family , and that it is below the threshold for pair production of fourth family fermions .",
    "the fourth family quarks can be expected to have masses roughly of order 600 gev . under this assumption",
    "the @xmath0 width is @xmath12 60 \\mbox { gev } .\\ ] ] the quantity we choose to fix in our study is the ratio @xmath13 , since this basically determines the size of possible low energy effects of the @xmath0 ( e.g.  see section 3 ) . with",
    "@xmath14 fixed we shall consider the values for @xmath15 in the range from 700 to 1300 gev .",
    "the corresponding couplings are quite strong ( these are couplings renormalized at the scale @xmath15 ) and the @xmath0 width can become quite large , ranging from 84 to 540 gev .",
    "@xmath0 is produced in @xmath16 collisions due to its coupling to @xmath9 quarks .",
    "due to the bottom sea quark component of the protons , the main parton - level processes in order of importance at the lhc are the following .",
    "@xmath17 the first process contributes about 2/3 of the cross section and the second about 1/4 .",
    "we focus on the decay mode @xmath18 .",
    "the reconstrution of the @xmath0 mass can be accomplished @xcite even though the @xmath10 decays produce missing energy .",
    "the point is that the @xmath10 s are highly boosted and so the missing component of their decay products are close to collinear with the visible components .. ] we can write the @xmath19 momenta as @xmath20 and @xmath21 , where @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the fractions carried by the visible components @xmath24 and @xmath25 . then the measured total transverse missing momentum is @xmath26 this vector relation determines @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "then the @xmath0 invariant mass is obtained by scaling up the invariant mass determined by the four - vectors @xmath27 and @xmath28 by a factor of @xmath29 .",
    "for background event generation we use the alpgen@xcite - pythia@xcite combination , while for signal generation we use madevent@xcite - pythia to accommodate the new physics model .",
    "we adopt the pythia tune d6 t ( due to r.  field ) which is based on the cteq6l1 pdf .",
    "decays treated internally and with @xmath30 s treated as stable . ] since we do not go beyond tree - level matrix elements in our event generation , it is important to choose a sensible renormalization / factorization scale that can be used consistently for both signal and background . we choose to set this scale to the partonic quantity @xmath31 ( which goes over to the canonical choice of @xmath32 for @xmath33 production close to threshold ) .",
    "we note that other popular choices for the renormalization scale involve some combination of @xmath34 s and masses of the particles produced , but in our case the mass of the @xmath0 is not well defined when it is a very broad resonance .",
    "madevent is run for the combined set of processes listed above with a constraint that the jets , including @xmath9-jets , are required to have @xmath35 gev .",
    "this is due to the issue of double - counting ; if the bottom sea quarks in the proton are thought to arise from gluon splitting @xmath36 , then the first process above could be thought to have the same topology as a diagram contributing to the third process .",
    "the overlap is expected to occur for @xmath9-jets at small @xmath37 and large @xmath38 , and hence the @xmath35 gev cut . with this cut the third process in total contributes less than 5% of the cross section and thus any remaining double - counting can not be significant .",
    "we find cross sections for @xmath0 production ( in collisions of 7 tev protons ) of 4.4 , 2.8 , 1.9 , 1.4 , 1.1 pb for @xmath39 gev ( with @xmath40 ) .",
    "alpgen generates background events with mlm jet matching involving 0 , 1 , and 2 extra hard jet samples , with jets having @xmath41 gev and pseudorapidity @xmath42 .",
    "pgs4@xcite is used for detector simulation , with the parameter choice for atlas as supplied by the madevent package .    for event selection",
    "we use the following cuts , where by ` lepton ' we mean an isolated electron or muon or a @xmath10-tagged jet .",
    "the @xmath10-tagged jets are in fact essential for the signal .- tags is also worth considering , which could give comparable results . ]",
    "* at least one pair of oppositely charged leptons , each with @xmath43 gev , with invariant mass @xmath44 gev * missing energy @xmath45 gev * @xmath46 gev * not more than one non-@xmath9-tag jet with @xmath43 gev * no jets or leptons with @xmath47 and @xmath43 gev    very effective is the 300 gev dilepton invariant mass constraint , which essentially eliminates the contribution from the @xmath48jets background . to reconstruct the @xmath0 mass we consider all such pairs of leptons and require that the @xmath22 and @xmath23 obtained by solving ( [ e1 ] ) satisfy @xmath49 . also effective",
    "is the requirement of not more than one non-@xmath9-tag jet to suppress backgrounds involving more jets , which includes @xmath50jets . a low rate for jets to fake @xmath10 s , along with the missing energy constraint , will help to suppress the pure qcd jet background . the missing energy constraint could be increased further if necessary .",
    "we will take the @xmath10 fake rate conservatively to be 1% ( lower values are described in @xcite for atlas ) .",
    "we are left with @xmath50jets and @xmath51jets as the main backgrounds . in our generation of events for the former",
    "we take both top quarks to decay semileptonically , and for the @xmath51jets background we take the @xmath52 to decay leptonically . for the @xmath51jets background ,",
    "at least one of the two leptons used to reconstruct the @xmath0 will be a jet that fakes a lepton ( most likely a fake @xmath10 ) .",
    "the pgs4 @xmath10 fake rate appears to be too large , and to implement our own fake rate we proceed as follows .",
    "we consider another set of events which has an additional jet which is neither @xmath9-tagged nor @xmath10-tagged which we use along with an identified lepton in the event to reconstruct the @xmath0 mass . by combining this set of events with the original set we then have both pgs4 @xmath10-tagged ( fake ) and non - tagged jets contributing to the reconstruction , and to this result we can multiply by our estimate of a @xmath10 fake rate ( 1% ) . for the signal and the @xmath50jets background",
    "there are two real leptons in the events and in these cases we do nt make any correction for the pgs4 @xmath10 fake rate .",
    "it is also useful to consider the relative orientation of the three vectors @xmath53 , @xmath54 and @xmath55 appearing in ( [ e1 ] ) . in particular",
    "consider the vector that bisects the angle between @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "let @xmath56 be the angle between this vector and @xmath55 .",
    "then the signal favors @xmath57 more so than the background .",
    "this is due to the fact that @xmath53 and @xmath54 tend to be close to back - to - back , in both signal and background , while for the signal the missing momentum from each @xmath10 decay aligns with @xmath53 and @xmath54 respectively .",
    "thus a cut @xmath58 for example will suppress the background more than the signal , especially for larger @xmath15 .",
    "we shall impose this cut , while noting that other related cuts can also be devised .",

    "the @xmath0 has a production rate that falls rapidly with its mass , and a width that is proportional to @xmath61 .",
    "both of these effects cause its detectability at the lhc to fall with increasing mass even while @xmath14 is held fixed .",
    "we show the @xmath0 mass reconstruction in figs .",
    "( 1,2 ) for @xmath39 gev for @xmath40 . in fig .",
    "( 1 ) we also display the case of a smaller coupling , @xmath62 for @xmath63 gev . by comparing these results",
    "one sees how both the height and width of the peak provides information on @xmath8 .",
    "( 3 ) shows that our cuts have been effective at reducing the backgrounds to levels small compared to the signal .",
    "even a high mass broad signal peak can be differentiated from the background since the background peaks around 700 gev .",

    "these histograms are stacked , not overlayed .",
    "the vertical scale differs from the previous figures .",
    "the @xmath0 boson should be easy to differentiate from a @xmath11 boson with family universal couplings . through its coupling to light quarks a @xmath11 can be found up to significantly higher mass . and a @xmath11 with a mass of order a tev is constrained to have couplings typical of the @xmath3 or smaller and",
    "would thus be much more narrow than we expect for the @xmath0 boson . to test the hypothesis that the @xmath0 couples equally to all members of the third family , we need to consider other decay modes of the @xmath0 boson",
    ".    decays to a pair of quarks can produce @xmath64 , @xmath65 and @xmath66 final states , but the extraction of these signals from background appears to be nontrivial and requires more study . the decay to @xmath67 can lead to @xmath68 , where the missing transverse momentum is that of the @xmath0 .",
    "but the latter is not expected to be large compared to the @xmath0 mass , and the result is that the signal is swamped by the @xmath69jets background where @xmath70 and the jets fake @xmath9-jets .",
    "more promising is the decay to the fourth neutrino @xmath71 if kinematically allowed . since mass mixing in the lepton sector",
    "can lead to the decay @xmath72 , this can lead to interesting signatures involving varying numbers of leptons and jets .",
    "of course @xmath73 could also be produced directly through a @xmath3 .",
    "we first discuss how mass mixing between the third and fourth families can affect the @xmath0 couplings to quarks .",
    "let us consider for example the @xmath9 and @xmath5 .",
    "in an interaction eigenstate basis with @xmath74 the @xmath0 couples with coupling strength @xmath8 to a vector current @xmath75 but the @xmath76 fields need not correspond to the mass eigenstates .",
    "the unitary transformations @xmath77 and @xmath78 to the mass eigenstate basis produce a nondiagonal current @xmath79 the third family @xmath80 and @xmath81 couplings are then determined by the respective components of the matrices @xmath82 and @xmath83 .",
    "these diagonal components vary between @xmath84 and 1 , and thus the @xmath80 and @xmath81 couplings independently vary between @xmath85 and @xmath8 . the off - diagonal left - handed couplings @xmath86 and @xmath87 have absolute value @xmath88 and they only vanish when the @xmath80 couplings are @xmath89 .",
    "the same is true for the right - handed couplings .",
    "the same story applies to the ( @xmath90,@xmath6 ) , ( @xmath91,@xmath10 ) and ( @xmath92,@xmath93 ) pairs , with potentially different unitary transformations .",
    "but we should assume that the @xmath0 couplings preserve to good approximation the usual custodial @xmath94 symmetry among @xmath90 and @xmath5 quarks .",
    "this implies that we can write the couplings to the third family mass eigenstates in terms of four parameters ( fourth family couplings are opposite in sign ) .",
    "@xmath95 if the @xmath0 boson has some axial quark coupling @xmath96 then it will receive a contribution to its mass from the dynamical @xmath90 and @xmath5 masses .",
    "given that essentially all of the @xmath3 mass arises from this source we have the bound @xmath97    an axial coupling can also imply some mass mixing between the @xmath0 and the @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "let us denote this by @xmath98 , the off - diagonal element of the @xmath99 mass - squared matrix .",
    "the @xmath90 and @xmath5 contributions cancel in the limit of @xmath90-@xmath5 mass degeneracy , but a @xmath6 loop contributes as long as @xmath100",
    ". we can write this contribution to @xmath98 in terms of @xmath101 , which is defined such that @xmath102 with @xmath103 gev gives the fractional contribution of the @xmath6-loop to @xmath104 , @xmath105 a standard estimate is @xmath106 gev @xcite .",
    "fourth family leptons could also contribute to this mixing , but as we shall see the @xmath91 must have mostly vectorial couplings to the @xmath0 and the @xmath107 mass is probably not large compared to the @xmath6 . in terms of the mass mixing @xmath98",
    "we have a shift of the @xmath3 couplings to the third family @xmath108    the current constraints from @xmath109 and @xmath110 are quite strong and imply that substantial shifts in the @xmath3 couplings are only allowed if the shift in the @xmath9 coupling is mostly right - handed ( @xmath111 if @xmath112 ) and the shift in the @xmath10 coupling is mostly vectorial ( @xmath113 if @xmath114 )",
    ". since the shifts ( [ e2 ] ) are proportional to the @xmath0 couplings , for illustration we consider the following choices @xmath115 this will essentially give the maximal shifts in quantities other than @xmath109 and @xmath110 .    also for illustration we will consider the case where @xmath116 is chosen to produce results similar to our monte carlo simulations where @xmath13 .",
    "for this we need to set @xmath117 to make up for the absence of the coupling to @xmath118 . if the decay to @xmath119 etc",
    ".  became possible .",
    "] the resulting @xmath120 is safely compatible with the bound in ( [ e3 ] ) . combining these values with the above results we obtain the following shifts in the @xmath3 couplings to the third family , @xmath121    we compare the resulting pattern of deviations to the experimental results @xcite in table 1 .",
    "the experimental @xmath122 and @xmath123 values were obtained from the departures from the standard model fit prediction . @xmath124 and",
    "@xmath125 were derived from the measured departures from lepton universality , assuming @xmath126 and @xmath127 .",
    "@xmath128 was attributed to the departure of the measured number of neutrinos from three .",
    "we see that the @xmath0 boson induced shifts are compatible with experiment except for two of the measurements of the @xmath10 asymmetry parameter .",
    "this apparently rules out this picture of maximal @xmath3 coupling shifts unless some experimental errors are seriously underestimated .",

    "we have considered a picture for minimal new flavor interactions , where the @xmath0 , a new massive gauge boson , couples preferentially to the quarks and leptons of the third family .",
    "the coupling can be of order one or more and this can lead to a large width for the @xmath0 . the @xmath0 is produced at the lhc through its coupling to the @xmath9 quark , while the decay @xmath18 produces the most striking signatures .",
    "these events will be deficient in non-@xmath9-jets .",
    "the @xmath0 mass can be reconstructed from the visible decay products of the @xmath10 s and missing @xmath34 .",
    "we have discussed event selection cuts that quite effectively suppress main backgrounds from @xmath50jets and @xmath51jets .",
    "this leads to a clear discovery potential for the @xmath0 with mass ranging up to at least a tev , with only a fb@xmath60 of integrated luminosity .",
    "we have restricted ourselves to @xmath0 masses at or above 700 gev because this is roughly the scale where we could expect that the physics of flavor comes together with the physics of electroweak symmetry breaking .",
    "this picture points towards a sequential fourth family with similar mass .",
    "a fourth family also allows the required cancellation of gauge anomalies associated with a @xmath0 boson .",
    "a heavy fourth family has its own signatures at the lhc @xcite , and in particular @xmath130 production provides a signal for which @xmath33 production is a dominant irreducible background , just as we have found for @xmath0 production .",
    "this indicates that a thorough understanding of the @xmath33 sample at the lhc will be a prerequisite in the search for new flavor physics .",
