    "the family of quasi - one - dimensional mixed valent vanadium oxides @xmath1-@xmath7v@xmath3o@xmath4 ( @xmath8=li , na , ag , ca , sr , and pb ) exhibit a variety of exotic phenomena such as metal - insulator transition , charge ordering , and pressure - induced superconductivity  @xcite .",
    "they provide fascinating opportunities to study mechanism for competing orders in a common monoclinic crystal structure shown in fig .",
    "1  @xcite .",
    "there are three types of one - dimensional v - o network extending along the most conducting @xmath5-axis : a zigzag chain formed by the v1 sites , another zigzag chain formed by the v3 sites , and a two - leg ladder formed by the v2 sites . at high temperatures ,",
    "the @xmath8 ions are distributed randomly over two sites with 50  % occupancy in the space group @xmath9 .",
    "they order below a certain temperature and fully occupy a single sites in the new space group @xmath10 .",
    "this doubles the unit cell along the @xmath5-axis and generates two inequivalent sites for each of the three vanadium sites , which are denoted as vna and vnb ( n=1 - 3 , see fig .  1 ) .",
    "-sr@xmath2v@xmath3o@xmath4 with the space group @xmath10 viewed from the ( a ) @xmath5- , ( b ) @xmath11- , and ( c ) @xmath12-directions . ]",
    "this ordering occurs above the room temperature ( rm ) in @xmath1-sr@xmath2v@xmath3o@xmath4 , which is a pauli paramagnetic metal at rt .",
    "it undergoes a metal - insulator transition at @xmath13 170 k accompanied by a simultaneous structural transition , that further triples the unit cell along the @xmath5-axis @xcite .",
    "the magnetic susceptibility in the low @xmath14 insulating phase indicates a singlet ground state with a spin gap . a spatial order of vanadium valence into v@xmath15 ( @xmath16 ) and v@xmath17 ( @xmath18 ) with 1:2 ratio was suggested for the low @xmath14 phase from structural analysis .",
    "however , the neutron diffraction  @xcite and the nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr )  @xcite experiments ruled out such atomic localization of @xmath19 electrons for @xmath1-na@xmath2v@xmath3o@xmath4 , which also shows simultaneous metal - insulator and structural transitions . in this paper",
    "we report results of @xmath0v - nmr experiments on a single crystal of @xmath1-sr@xmath2v@xmath3o@xmath4 and discuss charge distribution and spin dynamics in the high @xmath14 metallic phase .",
    "nmr data on @xmath1-sr@xmath2v@xmath3o@xmath4 have been reported only for a powder sample so far  @xcite .",
    "a single crystal of @xmath1-sr@xmath2v@xmath3o@xmath4 obtained by the czochralski method was used in this work .",
    "it has the size 0.5@xmath201.8@xmath200.2",
    "mm@xmath21 with the largest dimension along the @xmath5-axis .",
    "the @xmath0v nmr spectra were obtained by summing the fourier transform of the spin - echo signals with the frequency step of 0.3 mhz .",
    "the nuclear spin - lattice relaxation rate 1/@xmath22 was measured by the inversion recovery method .",
    "the magnetic field @xmath23 ( 10.509  t ) was applied in the @xmath24-plane .",
    "the direction of the field is specified by the angle ( @xmath25 ) measured from the @xmath26-axis .",
    "there are four v atoms for each of the six crystalographic sites in a unit cell of the metallic phase ( space group @xmath10 ) .",
    "when the magnetic field is applied in the @xmath24-plane , these four atoms become equivalent and give identical nmr spectra . since @xmath0v nuclei have spin @xmath27=7/2 , the electric field gradient ( efg ) splits the nmr spectrum into equally spaced seven lines at the following frequencies due to first order effect of the nuclear quadrupole interaction , @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the nuclear gyromagnetic ratio ( 11.193  mhz / t ) , @xmath30 is the knight shift , @xmath31 is the quadrupole splitting , and @xmath32 specifies the nuclear transitions @xmath33 .",
    "= 190  k. ]    the upper panel of fig .",
    "[ fig-2 ] shows the nmr spectrum at @xmath34 , while the lower panel displays the angle dependence of the resonance frequencies for all the lines at @xmath14=190  k. at each angle , there are several sets of equally spaced lines assigned as a - f. in many cases only a portion of the quadrupole split seven lines are clearly resolved .",
    "however , they are sufficient to determine @xmath30 and @xmath31 from eq .",
    "( 1 ) .        in fig .",
    "3(a ) and ( b ) , we plot the angle dependences of @xmath30 and @xmath31 for the a - f sites . since @xmath35 and @xmath36 , we need consider only the lowest order effect for the frequency shift",
    ". then @xmath30 and @xmath31 should obey the following angle dependences  @xcite , @xmath37 these equations indeed fit the data very well as shown by the solid , dashed and dotted lines in fig .",
    "3(a ) and ( b ) .",
    "thus we have completely determined @xmath30 and @xmath38 for all the vanadium sites .",
    "generally the knight shift at transition metal sites consists of the orbital and the spin contributions , @xmath39 .",
    "while @xmath40 may be either negative or positive , @xmath41 is always positive .",
    "the fact that @xmath30 is negative for the entire range of angle at all sites indicates that the dominant term is @xmath40 , which is related to the local spin susceptibility as @xmath42 . the core polarization coupling constant @xmath43 is isotropic and negative , while the dipolar coupling constant @xmath44 is purely anisotropic , i.e. its directional average is zero .",
    "since @xmath45 is nearly isotropic except for small anisotropy of the @xmath46-value , the observed angular variation of @xmath30 must be ascribed to the anisotropy of @xmath44 , which is determined by the spin density distribution of @xmath19-electrons .    in @xmath1-sr@xmath2v@xmath3o@xmath4 , each vanadium atom is surrounded by a distorted squared pyramid formed by oxygen atoms .",
    "the shortest vanadyl bonding between the vanadium and the apical oxygen lies nearly in the @xmath24-plane for all the v sites ( within 4@xmath47 ) .",
    "doublet and lepetit investigated the local electronic structure based on the extended hckel tight - binding calculation  @xcite .",
    "they proposed that the magnetic orbital accommodating the @xmath19-electrons is the @xmath48-orbital , where the local @xmath49-axis is parallel to the shortest v - o bonding and @xmath50 and @xmath51 point toward the oxygen atoms in the basal plane of the pyramid .",
    "the dipolar coupling @xmath52 to the spin density on the @xmath48-orbital takes the largest negative value when the field is along the @xmath49-axis .",
    "since @xmath43 is negative , @xmath30 is expected to be most negative when the field is along the shortest v - o bond direction .",
    ".the upper part lists the values of @xmath53 for the a to f sites .",
    "the lower part shows the directions of the shortest v - o vanadyl bonding projected onto @xmath24 plane .",
    "the angles were measured from the @xmath26-axis . [ cols=\"<,<,<,<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ table_1 ]    in table [ table_1 ]",
    "we compare the values of @xmath53 at which @xmath30 becomes most negative ( upper panel ) with the directions of the shortest v - o bonding projected onto the @xmath24-plane obtained from the structural data in ref .",
    "@xcite ( lower part ) .",
    "we can immediately assign the three groups of sites ( a , b ) , ( c , d ) and ( e , f ) to the ( v1a , v1b ) , ( v2a , v2b ) and ( v3a , v3b ) sites , respectively .",
    "we can not determine , however , which one in each group corresponds to `` a '' or `` b '' . with this assignment the directions for the minimum of @xmath30 and the shortest v - o bonding agree within ten degrees , supporting that the magnetic orbital indeed has @xmath48 symmetry .",
    "the data in fig .",
    "3(a ) indicate that while @xmath30 for the v3a and v3b sites are almost identical , it differs substantially between the v2a and v2b sites and between the v1a and the v1b sites .",
    "in particular , the amplitudes of the angular variation of @xmath30 ( @xmath54 in eq .",
    "2 ) for the v2a and the v2b sites differ by a factor two .",
    "since the angular variation of @xmath44 should be similar for all the sites , the local spin susceptibility @xmath45 must be significantly different for the v2a and the v2b sites .",
    "such alternation of @xmath45 should be ascribed to charge disproportionation . in other words , although the @xmath19-electron density is quite uniform in the v3 zigzag - chains , it alternates strongly in the v2 ladders .",
    "the strong charge disproportionation even in the metallic phase may appear surprising .",
    "however , this has been predicted by doublet and lepetit .",
    "they argued that ordering of sr leads to a large difference in the energy of the @xmath19-levels , therefore , the different charge density at the v2a and the v2b sites  @xcite . on the other hand , the three groups of sites , v1 , v2 , and v3 , show quite similar values of @xmath54 when averaged over the `` a '' and the `` b '' sites .",
    "thus the @xmath19-electrons are distributed rather uniformly over the three 1d structural units .",
    "the v2a and the v2b sites exhibit also distinct @xmath14-dependence of the knight shift .",
    "figure 3(c ) show the @xmath14-dependence of @xmath55 for several sites normalized by the value at @xmath14=300  k. they were measured at `` magic angles '' at which @xmath31=0 .",
    "( no measurements were done for the b sites which do not have a magic angle in the @xmath56-plane . )",
    "the steep increase of @xmath57 at the d sites with decreasing temperature is in strong contrast to the nearly constant behavior at the c sites .",
    "we also note peculiar decrease of @xmath57 with decreasing temperature at the f sites .",
    "although the bulk susceptibility shows little @xmath14-dependence ( the solid line ) , this must be a results of cancellation of opposite @xmath14-dependence at the d and f sites .",
    "we should mention that such strong heterogeneity within the same structural unit has not been observed in @xmath1-na@xmath2v@xmath3o@xmath4  @xcite    the angle dependence of @xmath31 shown in fig .",
    "3(b ) also reflects the local symmetry of each v sites .",
    "there is indeed noticeable correlation between the directions of shortest v - o bonding and extrema of @xmath31 for many sites .",
    "however , efg is rather difficult to analyze because of contributions not only from the on - site @xmath19-electrons but from the neighboring ions .",
    "hence we did not attempt to make any quantitative analysis .",
    "we now discuss the spin dynamics .",
    "the nuclear relaxation rate 1/@xmath22 was measured also with the field along magic angles .",
    "this enabled site - selective measurements of 1/@xmath22 even when the line is not well isolated from others , due to strongly enhanced signal , distinct rf - pulse width for optimum excitation , and simple exponential time dependence of the nuclear magnetization recovery at magic angles .",
    "for the e and f sites , which have nearly the same magic angle , the nuclear recovery curve was fit to sum of two exponential functions .",
    "the result was checked by separate measurements on well isolated quadrupole satellite lines .",
    "the @xmath14-dependences of @xmath6 are shown in fig.[fig-4 ] .",
    "again different sites show remarkably contrasting behavior .",
    "the v3a and v3b sites ( e and f ) show nearly constant behavior with the similar magnitude of @xmath6 , suggesting absence of strong spin correlations .",
    "precisely speaking , however , the e sites show slight increase of @xmath6 with decreasing temperature .",
    "such increase is more clearly visible for the a sites ( one of the v1 sites ) .",
    "the results for the v2a and v2b ( c and d ) sites are most anomalous .",
    "while @xmath6 at the c sites is nearly constant , it increases strongly at the d sites with decreasing temperature . at the d sites , @xmath6 and",
    "@xmath58 follow approximately the same @xmath14-dependence as indicated by nearly constant @xmath59 shown in fig .",
    ".    generally for quasi 1d electron systems , spin fluctuations both at @xmath60 and at @xmath61 contribute to @xmath6 , @xmath62 in the luttinger - liquid ( ll ) theories , which is expected to be applicable to quasi 1d conductors , the @xmath14-dependence of each term is given as @xmath63 , @xmath64 , where @xmath65=1 for non - interacting electrons but generally @xmath66 for repulsive interactions  @xcite .",
    "the nearly constant behavior of @xmath67 ( fig .",
    "4(d ) ) suggests that the dominant contribution to @xmath6 at the d sites comes from @xmath60 spin fluctuations .",
    "thus our results appear to support strong ferromagnetic correlation in the v2 ladder units in the high @xmath14 metallic phase .",
    "another peculiar result is the nearly constant behavior of @xmath6 at the f sites , in spite of the substantial decrease of the knight shift with decreasing temperature .",
    "we performed site - selective @xmath0v nmr measurements on a single crystal of @xmath1-sr@xmath2v@xmath3o@xmath4 in the high @xmath14 metallic phase .",
    "we found that the magnetic properties are remarkably heterogeneous even within the same structural unit .",
    "in particular , the v2 ladder unit shows strong charge disproportionation caused by the sr ordering . at one of the v2 sites , the absolute value of the knight shift and @xmath6 increases strongly with decreasing temperature , indicating development of ferromagnetic correlation .",
    "the local spin susceptibility at one of the v3 sites decreases substantially with decreasing temperature , although @xmath6 is nearly constant .",
