    "hysterisis loop for copper ferrite and cobalt ferrite shows that these two materials have net magnetization even before applying the magnetic field .",
    "but the copper - cobalt mixed ferrite loses this property .",
    "copper ferrite is known to be magnetically soft , with the low coercive values at room temperature .",
    "pure cu@xmath4 ions are diamagnetic in nature and hence the formation of copper ferrite gives the low coercive values . in copper ferrite , the effect of variation of crystallite size ( 50 - 220 nm ) on saturation magnetization ( 39 to 47 emu / g ) is reported @xcite .",
    "the observed ms value of 20 emu / g in the present work can be linked to the decrease in crystallite size as evident from xrd analysis and it is in agreement with the work of ahemed a. farghali @xcite .",
    "however the measured coercivity value of 838 oe is much larger and it can be attributed to the strength of magnetic moments formed due to the self - combustion preparation technique .",

    "the presence of co@xmath4 and cu@xmath4 ions at the same site has also been discussed through x - ray absorption spectroscopy elsewhere @xcite .",
    "the ferrite materials are porous in nature and have surface oxygen atoms which essentially arise due to the sample preparation technique . when the material adsorbs the humidity , its resistivity decreases due to the increase of charge carriers , protons , in the ferrite and water system @xcite .",
