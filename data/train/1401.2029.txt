    "we intend to study the global regularity of magnetohydrodynamics ( or mhd ) , which describes the evolution of electrically conducting fluids in the presence or absence of body forces , electric currents , and electromagnetic fields .",
    "we consider only the viscous and incompressible fluids which are permeated by magnetic fields .",
    "thus the governing equations are the navier - stokes equations of motion and pre - maxwell equations , coupled via the lorentz force and ohm s law .",
    "for the general theory of magnetohydrodynamics and its applications , consult the books by shercliff 1965 ; robert 1967 ; moffatt 1983 ; davidson 2001 ; lorrain _ et al _ 2006 .",
    "the _ local _ well - posedness of the cauchy problem for the mhd equations was known for a long time .",
    "one can trace the original ideas back to the work of leray and hopf on the navier - stokes equations ( leray 1934 ; hopf 1951 ) .",
    "duvaut and lions ( 1972 ) constructed a global weak solution and a local strong solution to the cauchy problem . roughly speaking , a weak solution or a suitable weak solution refers to a solution of the problem which has been shown to exist without known uniqueness and regularity properties",
    "while a strong solution is well - posed in certain designated lebesgue or sobolev spaces . for sobolev spaces",
    "@xmath0 , it was established in sermange & temam ( 1983 ) for any given initial data @xmath1 .",
    "however , the question of the _ global _ regularity is still an open problem for @xmath2 . on the basis of the partial regularity for the navier - stokes dynamics ( scheffer 1976 ; caffarelli _ et al _ 1982 ) , a generalized result on the partial regularity for mhd is treated in he & xin ( 2005 ) .",
    "particular attention should be paid to the fact that the solutions are not regular enough to ensure the law of conservation of energy .",
    "analogous regularity criteria to the widely - quoted serrin - prodi - ladyzhenskaya criteria in mathematical theory of the navier - stokes dynamics are available .",
    "the regularity criteria have been improved in chen _",
    "et al _ ( 2008 ) using fourier localization method and bony s para - product decomposition .",
    "the existence of a total energy cascade and the mechanisms of the energy transfers between the velocity and magnetic fields are investigated ( bradshaw & gruji 2012 ) .",
    "essentially , the results are derived by applying the concepts of the richardson energy cascades and of vorticity stretching .",
    "the study shows that it is the properties of hydrodynamic turbulence which first need to address satisfactorily .",
    "the concept of an energy cascade in mhd turbulence is popular in physics and fluid dynamics community , but there is considerable disagreement regarding the origin of the cascade .",
    "the debate is hardly new and it is largely the same problem in the navier - stokes dynamics .",
    "due to the interaction between the magnetic and vorticity fields , energy can also be transferred between the two fields and hence there are a number of transfer mechanisms .",
    "this fact simply makes the problem even harder to resolve .",
    "the main difficulty in the treatment of the mhd equations is that there has been a lack of _ a priori _ estimates for the fluid and magnetic fields .",
    "these estimates must be sufficiently strong to guarantee global regularity .    in the present paper",
    ", we shall follow the traditional approach to the mhd equations in which the motion is formulated as a system of evolution equations for the fluid velocity ( or vorticity ) and the magnetic field , along with an auxiliary equation for the electric field superimposed on the fluid . because of the recent progress in the theory of incompressible turbulence in @xmath3 ( lam 2013 ) , we intend to make an effort to analyze the mhd turbulence in @xmath3 which is clearly an idealized problem as the unknown currents inducing the electric and magnetic fields must be practically carried by conductors of finite extent .",
    "nevertheless , the mhd problem in @xmath3 would avoid some theoretical difficulties in analysis while it is a generic model in establishing the connection between the fluid turbulence and its interaction with the electric and magnetic fields .",
    "our experience in obtaining the global well - posedness for the navier - stokes dynamics suggests that we adopt a `` vorticity - current formulation '' which gives rise to a system of evolution equations for the unknown fluid vorticity and the magnetic field . when the system is converted into a system of integral equations , the result offers us a convenient platform where we can establish certain important _ a priori _ bounds .",
    "the availability of these bounds is crucial for regularity and uniqueness .",
    "the incompressibility hypothesis implies that the density remains constant throughout the motion so that any influence due to density stratification can only be assessed in a compressible mhd theory .",
    "we shall also postpone our efforts on the effects of coriolis and buoyancy forces to subsequent studies .",
    "in addition , we shall not go into the details whether a turbulent regime is physically reasonable for applications , such as the solar wind and the interstellar plasmas .",
    "rather we shall concentrate on the idealized problem of incompressible flows where the study is carried out to address the solutions of the mhd equations for finite , non - zero magnetic prandtl number ( the ratio of the fluid viscosity over the magnetic diffusivity ) .",
    "consequently , we shall work with real fluids with positive magnetic diffusivity so that both viscous and ohmic dissipations are operative over the entire course of flow evolution .",
    "we deal with flow evolution of a viscous , incompressible , electrically conducting fluid , in the whole space @xmath3 in the absence of a prescribed force .",
    "we are interested in the interaction of the forces of fluid dynamics , electric currents , and electromagnetic fields . in principle",
    ", the fluid flow is governed by the navier - stokes equations , coupled to maxwell s equations .",
    "we seek to solve a system of evolution equations for the fluid velocity @xmath4 and the magnetic field @xmath5 in the fluid ; both are solenoidal vector fields , depending on time @xmath6 $ ] and position @xmath7 .",
    "the time @xmath8 is given and is assumed to be finite .",
    "the coupled system has the form @xmath9 the laplacian is denoted by @xmath10 .",
    "the symbol @xmath11 is the pressure .",
    "the letter @xmath12 denotes the density of the fluid .",
    "the kinematic viscosity and the magnetic diffusivity are denoted by @xmath13 and @xmath14 respectively .",
    "( the electrical conductivity @xmath15 is a given positive constant .",
    "the symbol @xmath16 stands for the permeability of free space and is a universal constant . ) the vorticity and the total current density are obtained by taking the curl of the velocity and the magnetic field : @xmath17 the vorticity is a familiar fluid dynamics characteristic .",
    "the second relation is known as ampre s law ; it is a simplified version of the ampre - maxwell equation where the effect of maxwell s correction for the displacement current has been neglected .",
    "the current density @xmath18 in the fluid obeys ohm s law @xmath19 where @xmath20 denotes the ( unknown ) electric field . in a conducting fluid",
    ", we use an extended ohm s law to describe the total electromagnetic force per unit charge . the lorentz force ( per unit volume )",
    ", @xmath21 arises from the charge interaction in a magnetic field .",
    "it acts on all conductors carrying a current in the field .",
    "faraday s law states that the electric field is generated by the rate of change of the magnetic field : @xmath22 the first equation in ( [ eq : mhd ] ) is just the newton s second law of motion .",
    "compared to the navier - stokes momentum equation , the lorentz force acts on the current conductor and restrains the relative movement of the magnetic field and the fluid .",
    "its sign is opposite to the positive pressure gradient and appears to be a retarding force .",
    "the second equation is known as the induction equation .",
    "it is derived by taking the curl of ohm s law ( [ eq : ohm ] ) , and taking into account the relation in ( [ eq : electric - field ] ) .",
    "the third equation in ( [ eq : mhd ] ) is the continuity equation ; it is a consequence of the incompressibility hypothesis .",
    "the last equation , the magnetic field being solenoidal , is implied in faraday s law in view of the vector identity @xmath23 .",
    "furthermore , these solenoidal conditions assert that @xmath24    the initial velocity for the cauchy problem is given by @xmath25 and the initial magnetic field is specified as @xmath26 we are interested in the global regular solutions of the cauchy problem for the coupled system in @xmath3 . to facilitate our analysis",
    ", we consider the initial data as localized : @xmath27 for any values of @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "since we are working in @xmath3 , the total energy may appear to be infinite for an observer moving with a constant finite speed along any straight path which can be arbitrarily far away from the origin .",
    "it is defensible that the energy appears to be unbounded .",
    "such an anomaly is due to our choice of frame of reference .",
    "however , we can reformulate our magneto - fluid dynamics problem by choosing a galilean transform so that the observer becomes stationary relative the motion . thus the energy will remain finite unless the velocity is out of bound during the flow development . in subsequent analysis , we take it for granted that a galilean transform is effected .    most mathematics symbols and notations used in the present work",
    "are standard .",
    "the parabolic cylinder in space - time @xmath30 is written as @xmath31 $ ] for given fixed @xmath32 .",
    "we use a multi - index notation for the spatial partial derivatives of order @xmath33 @xmath34 for all multi - indexes @xmath35 with @xmath36 .",
    "all @xmath33 s are non - negative integers . for integrals over @xmath3 , we write @xmath37 for @xmath38",
    ". let the newtonian potential @xmath39 .",
    "we use the convolution notation @xmath40      the first equation in ( [ eq : mhd ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the bernoulli - euler pressure .",
    "the last term on the right in the first identity shows that the quantity @xmath43 acts on the fluid as if it is a pressure .",
    "as it is irrotational , hence it does not contribute to the vorticity .    to allow for possible singularities in the velocity and in the vorticity during the evolution of flow",
    ", we proceed our analysis by using a standard mathematical device .",
    "we introduce a sequence of regularizations of the solutions of the vorticity and magnetic equations ( see , for example , caffarelli _ et al _ 1982 ) . for fixed @xmath44 ,",
    "we denote the regularizations by @xmath45 . the symbol @xmath46 is referred as the mollification parameter .",
    "we introduce the notation @xmath47 to denote the mollification of the velocity @xmath4 in space and in time : @xmath48 the kernel function , @xmath49 , is a mollifier which is a smooth function in space and in time with compact supports . in addition",
    ", it has the properties : @xmath50 , and @xmath51    the structures of the second equation in ( [ eq : mhd ] ) and momentum equation ( [ eq : mhd - mod ] ) suggest that we only need to mollify the velocity such that @xmath52 we have omitted the mollification on the velocity continuity as the mollification preserves the solenoidal property of @xmath4 , in view of the well - known properties of mollifiers ( see , for example , adams & fournier 2003 ) .",
    "we take the curl on the momentum equation , and we find that the system reduces to @xmath53 the two terms in the middle equality of the first equation are the couple contributions from the velocity and magnetic fields .",
    "the signs of the couples are dynamically dependent on the local gradients of the velocity and the lorentz force . from the principle of conservation of angular momentum ,",
    "the presence of the magnetic field is equivalent to a prescribed non - conservative force and hence it exerts an additional torque on the vorticity evolution .",
    "first we observe that if we integrate the right - hand sides in ( [ eq : curls - mollified ] ) over space @xmath3 , and then carry out integration by parts , we obtain the following summability conditions @xmath54 it is evident that these relations are independent of the mollification parameter @xmath46 .",
    "this observation suggests that it is advantageous to work in terms of the total vorticity and the total magnetic field @xmath55 hence the totals are governed by equations @xmath56 respectively . by duhamel s principle",
    ", these total quantities satisfy scalar integral equations @xmath57 and @xmath58 the notations , @xmath59 and @xmath60 , stand for the total initial data respectively .",
    "the integral kernels @xmath61 and @xmath62 are the fundamental solutions of diffusion equation and are defined by @xmath63 and @xmath64    a further integration on ( [ eq : mag - int ] ) and trivial applications of the fubini s theorem enable us to infer the invariance of the total magnetic field .",
    "the same applies to the total vorticity .",
    "thus we assert that @xmath65 by virtue of the well - known properties of the fundamental solutions for diffusion .",
    "it follows that the first invariance implies @xmath66 consider @xmath67",
    "as a measurable , real - valued function , we write @xmath68 , where both @xmath69 and @xmath70 are measurable , non - negative and _ finite_. hence the set @xmath71 has measure zero . by the archimedean property of the real numbers ( royden & fitzpatrick 2010 )",
    ", we deduce that every component of vorticity satisfies the bound @xmath72 which holds except possibly on a set of measure zero .",
    "the symbol @xmath73 denotes a natural number and it can be suitably chosen for any @xmath74 $ ] . using the elementary identity @xmath75 and the fact that @xmath76 , the integrability bound can be upgraded to @xmath77 for some natural number @xmath78 . by analogy , we have @xmath79    in fact , we can generalize this integrability procedure as follows .",
    "for any integers @xmath80 and @xmath81 , we derive the equations @xmath82 and @xmath83 in view of the solenoidal conditions in ( [ eq : mhd ] ) and ( [ eq : continuity ] ) , we verify that @xmath84 because the operators @xmath85 and @xmath86 commute .",
    "similarly , we arrive at @xmath87 thus we establish the generalization of the invariants in ( [ eq : vort - mag - int ] ) : @xmath88 from these integral constraints and the sobolev embedding theorem ( see , for example , adams & fournier 2003 ) , we conclude that @xmath89 evidently , these remarkable _ a priori _ bounds are independent of the mollifications .",
    "thus we can work in the space of smooth bounded functions for the vorticity and magnetic fields in @xmath90 $ ] in our subsequent analysis .",
    "in fact , the first bound also implies that , _ a priori _ , @xmath91 .",
    "we remark that the solenoidal conditions , @xmath92 and @xmath93 , define a rather weak constraint on the velocity and the magnetic field as they suggest that every term in @xmath94 , and in @xmath95 is finite .",
    "consequently , the cauchy problem for magnetohydrodynamics is defined in the following coupled equations governing the vorticity and magnetic fields @xmath96 either field is solenoidal . the initial vorticity for the problem is given by @xmath97 and the initial current density is specified as @xmath98 in addition , the initial data are considered as solenoidal and localized .",
    "thus the well - posedness of the cauchy problem for the magnetohydrodynamics equations can be completely established according to the well - developed theory of parabolic systems with bounded smooth coefficients ( see , for example , ladyzhenskaya _ et al _ 1968 ; friedman 1964 ; eidelman 1969 ) .",
    "the following poisson s equation defines the kinematic relationship between the solenoidal field @xmath5 and its curl : @xmath99 , where @xmath100 denotes a vector function ( see , for example , lorrain & corson 1970 ) .",
    "the magnetic field is the distributional derivative of the vector and it is given by the biot - savart law @xmath101 at any instant of time .",
    "the biot - savart law also holds for the velocity field , we give the explicit form as @xmath102      lighthill questioned the validity of the induction equation in ( [ eq : mhd ] ) for certain applications in astrophysics ( lighthill 1960 ) where the main interest lies in the evolution of a plasma of electrons and positive ions . for real conducting fluids , the induction equation takes a modified form @xmath103 where the last term incorporates the so - called hall current effect , and @xmath104 denotes the inverse of the electron charge density . in high conductivity plasmas , the extra term or the hall term is considered to be responsible for the phenomena of magnetic reconnection that involve redistribution of magnetic energy and kinetic energy .",
    "thus the rate of change of @xmath105 plays a significant role in the evolution of the magnetic vorticity ( @xmath18 ) . on the basis of the mollifications , the induction equation now has a mollified form : @xmath106 where @xmath93 , and @xmath107 .",
    "evidently , the sum of the right - hand under the spatial integration remains an invariant .",
    "hence we can generalize our _ a priori _ bound ( [ eq : smooth - ap - bound ] ) to include the hall current effect .",
    "however , a plasma consisting electrons ( whose mass and number density are denoted by @xmath108 and @xmath109 respectively ) and ions ( @xmath110 and @xmath111 ) , the momenta of these two `` fluids '' take rather distinct values in space - time because their density ratio @xmath112 .",
    "consequently , the velocity @xmath4 in the hydrodynamic equations ( [ eq : mhd ] ) needs to be specified to allow for the momentum differentials .",
    "it is clear that the velocity of the two combined streams is actually closer to @xmath113 , the mean velocity of the ions , than to @xmath114 , that of the electrons .",
    "this fact calls for better approximations in the equations of motion .",
    "the ( vector ) vorticity equations and the induction equation are written separately for the electrons , the ions and the magnetic field as follows : @xmath115 where the coefficients of viscosity for the electrons ( @xmath116 ) and the ions ( @xmath117 ) take different values .",
    "the parameters , @xmath118 and @xmath119 , depend also on the electron charge .",
    "because of collisions with ions , there is a loss of electron momentum per unit volume .",
    "we denote the curl of the rate of the normalized loss by @xmath120 , and @xmath121 as just discussed , the stream velocity is far greater than @xmath114 ; the term involving @xmath114 in the induction equation is bound to be small compared to the hall term .",
    "the third equation in ( [ eq : sep - curls ] ) defines an invariance of the magnetic field , i.e. , the second integral relation in ( [ eq : vm - int ] ) .",
    "in particular , we have @xmath122 from the first two differential equations , we assert that the following _ a priori _ bounds hold @xmath123 where @xmath124 and @xmath125 stand for the total vorticity for electrons and ions respectively .",
    "the quantity of the last integral is completely specified by the initial data .",
    "it is clear how to compute the integrals of @xmath126 for @xmath127 .",
    "if the magnetic field is so weak that its interaction with the vorticity field can be neglected , then the fluid dynamics equations and the induction equation in mhd system ( [ eq : mhd ] ) become uncoupled .",
    "equations ( [ eq : curls ] ) reduce to the approximation @xmath128 these equations are to be solved subject to the initial conditions ( [ eq : vort - ic ] ) and ( [ eq : current - ic ] ) .",
    "it is evident that the role of the fluid dynamics is crucial in the global regularity of the incompressible mhd equations in @xmath3 since the velocity becomes a coefficient function in the induction equation .    the first equation in ( [ eq : curls - approx ] ) can be converted into an integral equation : @xmath129 where @xmath130 denotes the components of the vector function @xmath131 , which is given by @xmath132 the matrix @xmath133 is diagonal .",
    "its elements are identical and equal to @xmath61 .",
    "similarly , @xmath134 where @xmath135 is the mollified initial magnetic field @xmath136 the matrix @xmath137 is diagonal .",
    "its elements are identical and equal to @xmath62 . equations ( [ eq : vort - ie ] ) and ( [ eq : mag - ie ] ) define the vorticity and the current density as distribution solutions .    the global well - posedness for the navier - stokes equations or for the vorticity equation has been established in lam ( 2013 ) . in particular , the vorticity has a series solution : @xmath138^m\\big ) = \\gamma(x , t ) \\ : + \\sum_{m{\\geq}2}\\ : { s_m } \\ : v[\\gamma]^m   \\\\",

    "it is convenient to introduce some abbreviations : @xmath146 where the spatial differentiations for the newtonian potential @xmath147 are taken at every instant of time @xmath148 . in terms of these notations ,",

    "every term in the series expansion ( [ eq : vort - series - sol ] ) constitutes a space - time convoluted vorticity .",
    "each constituent is referred as an eddy .",
    "evidently , the initial vorticity lies in the core of every eddy .",
    "furthermore , the entire vorticity field is populated by the vorticity integro - power terms of all the degrees .",
    "this intricate vorticity field is the general solution of the vorticity equation and it is known as turbulence .",
    "the integral equation in ( [ eq : mag - ie ] ) for the magnetic field can be rewritten in the following vector form @xmath155 where the kernel @xmath156 denotes a @xmath157 matrix : @xmath158 and @xmath159 .",
    "hence the interaction between the vorticity and magnetic fields in the absence of lorentz force can be completely determined by evaluating the expression @xmath160 where @xmath161 is the resolvent kernel of @xmath156 . in view of ( [ eq : bs ] ) , @xmath5 is clearly solenoidal . in conclusion ,",
    "turbulence is exclusively generated by the vorticity and is relayed into the magnetic field .",
    "this finding is contrary to a long - held view that random stretching of magnetic lines of force causes a systematic decrease in scale of the magnetic field and hence leads to an increase of magnetic energy density , as long as ohmic dissipation can be neglected ( see , for example , batchelor 1950 ) .",
    "the essence is that the field @xmath5 is not subject to the curl constraint @xmath162 and hence the non - linearity itself on the `` forcing '' side in the induction is _ not _ the appropriate type to proliferate small scale motions .",
    "we proceed to establish a sequence of approximations to the solutions of the coupled system ( [ eq : curls ] ) .",

    "they are defined in the following iterative relations : @xmath167 the components of the function @xmath168 are calculated from the magnetic field @xmath169 we notice that the solenoidal conditions in ( [ eq : mhd ] ) and ( [ eq : continuity ] ) hold for all values of @xmath170 .    for @xmath171 ,",

    "it can be readily solved by method of fourier transform .",
    "explicitly , @xmath174 hence the solenoidal @xmath175 .",

    "the global regularity of the solution has been established ( lam 2013 ) .",

    "first we derive the equivalent integral equations .",
    "the first equation in ( [ eq : curls ] ) reduces to @xmath241 the magnetic field @xmath5 is the induced effect of the current , as shown in the biot - savart relation ( [ eq : bs ] ) .",
    "similarly , the velocity is induced by the vorticity . combining with ( [ eq : bs - vel ] ) and ( [ eq : bs ] ) ,",
    "the components of @xmath242 can be rewritten as @xmath243 where the scaled coefficient matrix @xmath244 .",
    "similarly , the second equation in ( [ eq : curls ] ) for the magnetic field is transformed into @xmath245 or into its vector form @xmath246 where the elements of @xmath247 are found from @xmath248 the kernel @xmath249 has the elements @xmath250 , and they are the elements of @xmath142 with every @xmath61 replaced by @xmath62 . in terms of the current density , equation ( [ eq : mag - t ] ) is expressed as @xmath251 where @xmath252 , and the kernel @xmath253 .",
    "we use the notations , @xmath254 , to denote the row matrices of the form @xmath255 by the rule of the curl , it is easy to see that , for instance , @xmath256 where all the space derivatives operate only on @xmath62 .",
    "next we need some knowledge of the integral kernels involved .",
    "the derivative of the diffusion kernel @xmath61 is bounded by @xmath257 where @xmath258 is constant , @xmath259 , and @xmath260 .",
    "similarly , it is known that @xmath261 where @xmath262 is constant , @xmath263 , and @xmath264 ( see , for example , friedman 1964 ; edelman 1969 ) .",
    "similar bounds hold for the fundamental solution @xmath62 .",
    "if the motion of the conducting fluid is set up in such a manner that the induced electrical field is rather weak or @xmath265 remains zero , then @xmath266 we have already treated this problem in the preceding section . on the basis of expression ( [ eq : f1 ] ) , we assert that the effect of the magnetic field is equivalent to a modification of the initial mollified vorticity data ( cf .",
    "( [ eq : omega1 ] ) ) .      if the conductivity is high , the current or the induced magnetic field is weak according to ohm s law .",
    "the `` forcing '' part in the induction is dominated by the imposed magnetic field ( say @xmath267 ) .",
    "moreover any spatial variations of this imposed field in the lorentz force can be neglected ; the lorentz force is assumed to be proportional to the velocity . hence the equations of motion are approximately given by @xmath268 the second equation is reduced to @xmath269 where the kernel @xmath270 . the vorticity equation can be transformed into the form @xmath271 in view of ( [ eq : mag - b0 ] ) .",
    "the additional initial mollified data , @xmath272 , is a function of @xmath267 and @xmath273 .",
    "the linear kernel @xmath274 which couples ohmic dissipation with the velocity field . in the component - wise form",
    ", this integral equation can be represented as @xmath275 where the initial condition @xmath276 is filtered @xmath277 by the resolvent of @xmath278 .",
    "similarly , the new integral kernel @xmath279 denotes the filtered @xmath144 .",
    "thus equation ( [ eq : mag - ie - b0 ] ) is in the identical form to the non - linear integral equation governing the vorticity in the navier - stokes dynamics .",
    "its solution has the analogous form to ( [ eq : vort - series - sol ] ) .",
    "one obvious way to solve our problem is to solve ( [ eq : mag - t ] ) so that @xmath5 is expressed in terms of @xmath242 in the volterra series : @xmath280 where @xmath281 is the resolvent of @xmath247 .",
    "the treatment of the general problem is clearly a prohibitive task . in particular , our non",
    "- linearity reduction does not seem to work any more because the resolvent becomes a `` polynomial '' of convolutions in @xmath242 .",
    "to get some insight into the way the flow and magnetic fields interacting with each other , we consider an idealized scenario .",
    "suppose that @xmath282 the last term is linear in the vorticity .",
    "then the integral related to the current density in ( [ eq : vort - t ] ) can be evaluated .",
    "the result is given in the following equation @xmath283 where @xmath284 the kernel @xmath285 depends on @xmath286 as it is the sum of kernel @xmath142 and the kernel arising from the product of the linear term in ( [ eq : mag - linear ] ) with itself .",
    "the kernel @xmath287 comes from the product of the linear term and the initial current density .",
    "let @xmath288 be the resolvent of @xmath287 .",
    "thus this non - linear integral equation can be reduced to @xmath289 where @xmath290 denotes the convoluted kernel of @xmath285 and @xmath288 .",
    "the initial condition @xmath291 is the filtered data by @xmath288 : @xmath292 the effects due to the linear term in ( [ eq : mag - linear ] ) are included in the kernels @xmath287 and @xmath285 . equation ( [ eq : vort - linear - res ] ) is essentially in the identical form as the vorticity equation in the navier - stokes dynamics .",
    "thus we assert that the solution has an analogous series expansion @xmath293^m.\\ ] ] hence the presence of a magnetic field affects the core of every eddy in the above series and the magnetic field in turn modifies every space - time integral convolution ; all the eddies are magnetized , as expected .",
    "the series defines an intricate spatio - temporal vorticity population ; it is known as turbulence .",
    "the initiation of the turbulence has nothing to do instability or the presence of a singularity in space or in time .",
    "( similarly , the solutions given in ( [ eq : vort - series - sol ] ) and ( [ eq : mag - ie - approx - sol ] ) consist in a structure of magneto - hydrodynamic turbulence which is not a result of instability . ) a series solution for the mhd equations , such as ( [ eq : linear - vort - series - sol ] ) , is a direct consequence of the non - linearity in the equations while the principal effect of the magnetic field is embedded in the core of the vorticity eddies .",
    "in general , every eddy has its own distinct strength and scale .",
    "the presence of a magnetic field adds an extra degree of complexity to this intricate turbulent field as we may interpret the effect of the magnetic field as an additional torque on the vorticity ( cf .",
    "( [ eq : vort ] ) ) .",
    "suppose that the size of the initial data is large , then the vorticity and magnetic fields will be observed as a laminar dynamics in a short time interval from the start of the motion .",
    "as the time goes by , the laminar flow field can no longer sustain and it becomes a turbulent flow via the process of the laminar - turbulent transition in the analogous manner to the navier - stokes flow field .",
    "if a magnetic field @xmath5 is large - scale and strong , its effect on the energy transfer process in small scales was discussed by kraichnan ( 1965 ) . in the present approximation ,",
    "if the lorentz force is much more stronger than the inertia force , the mhd equations ( [ eq : curls ] ) reduce to @xmath294 either differential equation can be transformed into an integral equation , namely @xmath295 where @xmath296 , and @xmath297 since the vorticity field is expected to be weak , we can eliminate @xmath242 from these two integral equations .",
    "the result is a non - linear integral equation in the current density .",
    "in fact , it is a cubic power in the current density .",
    "the explicit equation reads @xmath298 where @xmath299 is the filtered initial data @xmath273 by the resolvent of @xmath300 , @xmath301 and the kernel @xmath20 is the convoluted kernel of @xmath302 and the resolvent @xmath303 .",
    "the construction of the solution for integral equation ( [ eq : mag - lorentz ] ) is much more involved .",

    ", the series solution shows that , as a result of the cubic non - linearity , the integro - power terms or small scale motions in the magnetic field are more abundant than that in the vorticity field ( cf .",
    "( [ eq : vort - series - sol ] ) ) .    in the induction equation in the presence of a strong magnetic field ( cf .",
    "( [ eq : curls - lorentz ] ) ) , there are cancellations in the non - linear terms @xmath308 and @xmath309 when the equation is written as an integral equation .",
    "the first term is only responsible for the stretching of magnetic field lines .",
    "in fact , the stretching processes do not directly instigate the scale hierarchy of the motion .",
    "the resulting motion is a typical turbulent motion with the presence of multitudinous small scales , which are responsible for enhanced diffusivity .",
    "multiply the second equation in ( [ eq : curls - total ] ) by @xmath310 and integrate the result over space and time , we obtain an identity which expresses the law of conservation of energy : @xmath311 it is easy to assert that the enstrophy is also a conserved quantity of the motion as @xmath312 from these conservation laws , we deduce some additional flow quantities which elucidate the nature of turbulence in magnetohydrodynamics . equation ( [ eq : energy ] ) has an alternative form @xmath313 where the last equality sign holds only when the magnetic diffusivity @xmath314 vanishes . a similar bound holds for the vorticity @xmath315",
    "it is clearly that we can calculate similar bounds for the derivatives such as @xmath316 . in particular , we are interested in two motions with fluctuations in their initial data .",
    "we readily assert that @xmath317 and @xmath318 both the inequalities are independent of the diffusivity . in short ,",
    "the fluctuations in the initial conditions are not amplified over the flow evolution .",
    "therefore , the development of the mhd dynamics is _ insensitive _ to small variations in the initial conditions .",
    "this is a generalization of the vorticity dynamics in the navier - stokes system ( lam 2013 ) .",
    "thus the magnetohydrodynamics equations are deterministic in nature and they do not embody the characters of a typical chaos system .",
    "lam ( 2013 ) has made an attempt to explain the perceived macroscopic randomness on the basis of the boltzmann equation for maxwellian molecules with cut - off . in the mhd equations , both the viscous and ohmic dissipations are evident and they are the only irreversible processes during the dynamic evolution .",
    "there must be some mutual interaction between the two dissipative processes which is difficult to quantify . by analogy",
    ", we deduce that the apparent randomness in mhd has its microscopic origin ; the ohmic dissipation on the small - scale magnetic - vorticity eddies must be irregular . the random fluctuations on the dissipative scales are magnified and passed on , by the biot - savart action , to the whole flow field so long as the dissipations are intensive .",
    "it is shown in the present paper that the magneto - hydrodynamic equations in @xmath3 are globally well - posed for any finite - energy initial data which are smooth and localized .",
    "the mean flow quantities are well described by the equations . in the mhd system of a weak lorentz force ,",
    "the dominant effect is due to the fluid dynamics influence ; turbulence is an inherent feature of the dynamics if the size of the initial data are considerable . on the other hand ,",
    "if a strong lorentz force is present , the approximate dynamic equations contain a cubic non - linearity in the current density .",
    "it is shown that the non - linear integral equation can also be solved in a series expansion .",
    "the key ideas in the present paper are a generalization of the turbulent flows governed by the navier - stokes equations of motion",
