    "scanning tunnelling spectroscopy ( sts ) experiments on surfaces of several high-@xmath0 materials@xcite have discovered a host of fascinating phenomena , including checkerboard local density of states ( ldos ) modulations and inhomogeneous superconductivity with enormous gap modulations taking place at the nanoscale@xcite .",
    "recently , the size of the local gap was found to be positively correlated with simultaneously imaged atomic scale defects , thought to be interstitial oxygen dopants@xcite .",
    "this is a surprising result , since it had been expected that an oxygen , which donates two holes to the cuo@xmath1 plane , would overdope the system and lead to a smaller gap nearby .",
    "the positive correlation between the positions of the oxygens and the gap led nunner _",
    "et al._@xcite to suggest that the dopants might be increasing the pair interaction locally .",
    "this could occur if the local electronic structure were altered significantly , so as to modify a spin fluctuation exchange effective interaction , or possibly a local electron - phonon coupling constant .",
    "for example , it has been observed that a strong correlation exists between the distance of the apical oxygen from the cuo@xmath1 plane in high-@xmath0 materials and the critical temperature@xcite , and it might be imagined that a modulation of this displacement by dopant atoms could change the pairing interaction locally .",
    "et al._@xcite did not assume any specific microscopic model , but pointed out simply that the general assumption of dopants modulating the pair interaction could explain a remarkable number of experimental results and correlations .",
    "within a generalized inhomogeneous bardeen - cooper - schrieffer ( bcs ) pairing model adopted in this work , it correctly reproduces the anticorrelation of coherence peak height and position , the correlation of dopant position with gap size , and the detailed frequency dependence of the o : ldos(@xmath3 ) correlation .",
    "the theory is still controversial ; in almost all treatments of disorder in superconductors , impurities are assumed to simply scatter electrons as a screened coulomb potential , rather than modulate the pair interaction .",
    "there are , however , well - known exceptions@xcite , and it is certainly reasonable to expect modulation of the pair interactions to be largest in systems like the cuprates where the coherence length is small .",
    "strong correlations have not been included systematically in the theory , although some first steps have been made when j. x. zhu showed explicitly using an inhomogeneous slave - boson approach that the proposal of nunner _ et al . _",
    "that impurities might modulate the local exchange @xmath2 was consistent with the stm observations.@xcite .",
    "this scenario was investigated beyond the framework of mean field theory by mska _",
    "et al._@xcite . by assuming that ( i ) the cuprate superconductors can be described by the @xmath4 model , with the exchange interaction as the main pairing mechanism  @xcite , and ( ii ) that the presence of the dopant atoms induces a position - dependent shift of the atomic levels in the cuo@xmath1 plane",
    ", these authors calculated the effective superexchange interaction @xmath2 between copper ions in the presence of dopants from a perturbation expansion of the one - band hubbard hamiltonian up to second order .",
    "they showed that the diagonal disorder in the plane _ always _ leads to an enhancement of @xmath2 ; accordingly , with the assumption that pairing is due to superexchange , the superconducting gap increases in the vicinity of the dopant atoms , in agreement with ref . .",
    "if true , this conclusion would provide an important , apparently robust way to connect local atomic displacements with the increase of the pairing there , using the results of sts .",
    "however , recent results by johnston",
    "_ et al . _",
    "@xcite based on cluster model calculations for the three - band hubbard hamiltonian  @xcite , which account explicitly for the cu - o hopping processes , showed instead that electrostatic modifications due to the presence of the oxygen dopant locally suppress @xmath2 .",
    "they showed , in addition , that electronic coupling to local phonon modes was strongly modified by the dopant , and could enhance @xmath2 .",
    "this is consistent with the fact that the gap inhomogeneities are strongly ( anti)correlated to a local bosonic mode frequency identified in the tunnelling conductance by lee et al.@xcite , but still in apparent contradiction to the result of mska _ et al . _    in view of the present controversy , we investigate here the possibility that the mska _ et al .",
    "_ result is an artifact of an oversimplified model of the electronic structure of the cuo@xmath1 plane , and analyze the effect of a dopant impurity on @xmath2 by performing a perturbation expansion on the three - band hubbard model . as in ref .",
    ", we assume initially that the primary effect of the dopant is the shift of the atomic energy levels in the cuo@xmath1 plane , but account for the shifts in o levels as well as cu .",
    "our calculations show that the fifth - order contribution is as important as the fourth - order one , in agreement with the results for the pure case @xcite .",
    "we find that the sign of these contributions is very susceptible to the relative dopant - induced spatial variation of the atomic levels ; in contrast to the single - band case , it may be either positive or negative .",

    "these six parameters define the sign of the _ total _ fifth - order correction @xmath89 as well .    in order to quantify the effect that hopping to the corner o atoms has on the superexchange @xmath2 , we consider the case where @xmath90 and @xmath91 ( such a symmetry is realized when the dopant atom is located on the line connecting two cu atoms @xcite ) . for given @xmath68 and @xmath70",
    ", it is then possible to draw a phase diagram of the sign of the total correction , @xmath92 , in the space of @xmath93 and @xmath94 . in fig .",
    "[ 5th ] , we present , as an example , four such diagrams corresponding to different sets of @xmath68 and @xmath70 ( four points in fig .",

    "[ 5th ] , that the parameters @xmath97 , @xmath98 , @xmath99 , and @xmath100 have to be slightly larger than @xmath68 and @xmath70 to induce the change of sign of the correction to @xmath2 as compared to the fourth - order result .",
    "we are now concerned with trying to answer the following questions . is the sign of the correction to @xmath2 caused by the impurity uniformly positive , as occurred in the one - band calculation of ref . ?",
    "for physically reasonable assumptions regarding the magnitude and spatial dependence of the impurity potential for a dopant sitting several   from the cuo@xmath1 plane , can the modulation of @xmath2 be significant at all ?    regarding the first point , there is a simple argument that explains why the superexchange corrections due to doping derived from the three - band model can assume both positive and negative values while from the one - band model one finds that @xmath2 is always enhanced .",
    "let us consider what happens between neighboring cu and o ions when their energy levels shift due to a dopant by @xmath101 and @xmath102 , respectively . the local separation between their energy levels , which we denoted as @xmath20 for the homogeneous case , varies as @xmath103 . for @xmath104 , @xmath105 decreases compared with @xmath20 and vice versa . expressing @xmath2 in terms of @xmath105 instead of @xmath20",

    "[ 4th ] , the condition @xmath106 is fulfilled in the vicinity of the @xmath108 line ( on the line , @xmath109 ) and indeed @xmath2 is increased in the first quarter and reduced in the third quarter of the diagram . in the second and fourth quarters the relative variation of levels of cu atoms , @xmath110 , becomes equally important .",
    "the one - band model excludes completely the o atoms , thus ignoring one of the two microscopic factors ( change in the cu - o energy levels separation and the relative shift of the energy levels of two interacting cu ions ) that govern the variation of the local superexchange coupling @xmath2 .",
    "we would like to note that , as shown by eskes and jefferson @xcite for the homogeneous case , even the fifth - order perturbation expansion for @xmath2 is insufficient for quantitative estimates of @xmath2 and gives overestimated values compared with the experimental ( and cluster - model calculated ) values of @xmath2 .",
    "such trends , naturally , are also to be expected in the disordered case .",
    "we calculate the value of the forth- and fifth - order superexchange coupling corrections with the same model parameters as used in the cluster - model calculations @xcite [ fig .",
    "[ 4th ] and [ 5th ] ( d ) ] and find that the sign and the order of magnitude of the correction within our calculation , yielding a suppression of @xmath2 by @xmath111% ) , are in good agreement with cluster calculations@xcite when no modulation in the hopping integrals is considered , as it is our case here .",
    "consideration of other sets of model parameters@xcite lead to the same relative correction values .",
    "the question of the impact of a dopant atom on the local electronic properties in the cuo@xmath1 plane of the cuprates has been highlighted by stm measurements , indicating that dopants correlate with regions of large gap @xcite , and the theoretical proposal that the dopant itself is enhancing the pairing interaction @xcite .",
    "the appealing argument of maka _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , based on a single - band analysis , that the perturbation provided by the dopant necessarily enhances the superexchange locally and may therefore enhance pairing , has been shown to be a special result restricted to one - band systems . within a three - band hubbard model appropriate to the cuo@xmath1 plane , we have in this work performed a perturbative calculation to fifth order in the hoppings @xmath95 and @xmath96 , and shown that the sign of the correction to @xmath2 can be positive or negative depending on the potentials on nearby sites induced by the dopant impurity .",
    "the typical modulation is of order @xmath112 times the exchange for the homogeneous system , where @xmath113 is a typical dopant - dependent modulation of the local charge transfer energy between cu and o , and @xmath20 is the homogeneous value of this difference . using values of these shifts",
    "obtained from cluster calculations @xcite , we find that a typical modulation due to an o dopant in the bi-2212 system imaged by stm is of order 5% of the homogeneous value .",
    "it is possible that a more accurate microscopic calculation , accounting for the modulations of the hoppings and the apical oxygen degrees of freedom neglected here may produce a reliable description of this modulation . until then",
