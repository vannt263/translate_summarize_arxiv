    ".    also originates primarily in the shock ( paper  i ) .",

    "the absorption model assumes solar abundances , which could introduce an error as large as a factor of two in @xmath2 .",
    "we use the summed observation to determine @xmath15 and then predict fluxes for the three pointings .",
    "abundance ratios for oxygen , magnesium , and iron compared to neon are in the range of relative abundances found in paper  i. the observed fluxes of @xmath1013.45 along with the values of @xmath1 , @xmath0 , and @xmath14 determined from the diagnostics , give @xmath19 for each pointing .",
    "the predicted fluxes of the resonance lines @xmath109.17 , @xmath1018.97 and @xmath1015.01 are reasonably consistent with observations ; however , the observed fluxes show smaller differences than predicted . for all three ions ,",
    "a smaller difference in the transmission @xmath14 gives better agreement .",
    "for example , decreasing @xmath2 from @xmath21 @xmath22 to @xmath23 @xmath22 brings the line for the first two pointings into good agreement , while increasing @xmath2 from 0.9 @xmath24 @xmath22 to a value between 1.0 and 1.3 @xmath24 @xmath22 brings the line fluxes for all three ions into excellent agreement for the third pointing .",
    "the consistency for and is somewhat worse for the first two pointings , probably because their emissivity functions are steeply dropping at such low @xmath0 . given order of magnitude differences in emissivities and transmission over the range in @xmath0 and @xmath2 , the good agreement among the different shock diagnostics is remarkable .",

    ". arises primarily from the corona , but has a larger accretion contribution during the third pointing compared with the other two .",
    "the observed variation of @xmath2 provides new support for the idea that the accreting pre - shock stream is the absorber of the shocked , x - ray emission ( e.g. lamzin 1999 ; gregory et  al .",
    "2007 ; paper  i ) , since other potential sources of absorption ( e.g. interstellar , circumstellar ) are not expected to vary significantly .",
    "moreover , the nearly face - on view of the tw  hya system makes the disk itself an implausible absorber . to explore what the pre - shock gas as absorber implies about the geometry of the system , we use the strong shock condition to obtain the electron density of the pre - shock gas ( @xmath1/4 ) from the observed density @xmath1 of the shock .",
    "we assume the observed column density @xmath2 is through the same pre - shock gas , and estimate the path length @xmath25 . from , -dependence of the r - ratio , following smith et al .",

    "@xmath26 @xmath22 and @xmath27 @xmath28 , and thus @xmath29 km .",
    "this path length is much smaller than the stellar radius , and thus geometrical effects due to the curvature of the accretion column are insignificant .",
    "this estimate of @xmath30 is also an order of magnitude larger than the length of the post - shock cooling zone ( derived in paper  i ) .",
    "absorption by the cooling column appears to be ruled out .",
    "absorption by intervening stellar atmosphere can not be ruled out , although recent hydrodynamic models produce an `` observable '' shock in the upper chromosphere for conditions similar to those of tw  hya ( sacco et  al . 2008 ; 2010 ) .",
    "thus we proceed with the assumption that the pre - shock stream is the only absorber .    in the standard model of magnetospheric accretion ( calvet  & gullbring 1998 ; gnther et  al .",
    "2007 ) , the shock temperature can only vary if the accreting material originates at different distances from the star .",
    "knigl ( 1991 ) gives an expression for the inner truncation radius of the disk that depends only on the mass accretion rate @xmath31 and the surface poloidal magnetic field strength @xmath32 , in addition to the stellar mass @xmath33 and radius @xmath34 .",
    "thus the observed changes in @xmath0 indicate variations in @xmath31 , @xmath32 , or both .",
    "together @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 constrain the fundamental parameters of the standard accretion model , namely @xmath31 , @xmath32 , and filling factor @xmath35 .",
    "we assume a solar - type magnetic dipole , aligned with the rotation axis of the star ( cranmer 2008 , 2009 ) .",

    "the value of @xmath31 is calculated for the whole star , i.  e. in the pole - on case the model accretion rate is twice what we observe .",

    "several authors report significantly lower mass accretion rates from x - ray observations : @xmath50 ( curran et  al . 2011 ) ; @xmath51 ( stelzer  & schmitt 2004 ) ; @xmath52 ( gnther et  al .",

    "all of these studies use a lower @xmath2 value determined from global fits to the spectra , accounting for a factor of three or larger difference between their accretion rates and ours .",
    "the remaining differences may be due to differences in absolute abundances , filling factors , or relative accretion and coronal contributions to the spectrum , and to different spectra and methods .",

    "the large variations in @xmath55 and @xmath35 are unlikely to be the result of rotation or viewing angle , and thus it appears that the accretion rate changes substantially while the stellar magnetic field changes only slightly , if at all . the single spectrum obtained with the mike double - echelle spectrograph on magellan during the third _ chandra _  pointing ( dupree et  al .",

    "the observations indicate that at lower accretion rates , the stellar magnetic field exerts stronger control of the gas , producing a smaller hot spot at higher latitude , as expected .",
    "episodic events at lower latitudes occur in the data of donati et al .",

    "the time resolution of these variation signatures is of the order of several minutes , again much shorter than the effective time resolution of the x - ray spectroscopy .",
    "x - ray light curves derived from accretion lines show variability on timescales of a few ks ( see also paper  i ) , although these variations are not correlated with the optical photometry , and an enhanced accretion event ( during pointing 2 ) is followed by systematic changes in the optical emission lines ( dupree et  al .",
    "a decrease in the accretion rate leads to a complex response by the x - ray light curve : a decrease in intrinsic emission measure is countered by an increase in observed flux due to a decrease in the soft x - ray absorption by the accreting column itself .",
    "significant variability in x - ray accretion diagnostics occurs during the _ chandra _  hetg observations of tw  hya .",
    "in particular , variability of the column density @xmath2 implicates the pre - shock accreting gas as the x - ray absorber . @xmath2 and @xmath1 measurements from he - like lines support an absorbing path length short compared to the stellar radius but long compared to the shock cooling depth . with @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and",
    "@xmath2 together the x - ray data constrain all the fundamental parameters of the standard accretion model , namely @xmath31 , @xmath32 , and @xmath35 .    the resulting average mass accretion rate during the _ chandra_observation , @xmath46 m@xmath4 yr@xmath5 , based on diagnostics alone , agrees well with optical and ultraviolet techniques .",
    "the observations indicate that the mass accretion rate decreases by a factor of 5 during one pointing of @xmath7150  ks , compared with two others .",
