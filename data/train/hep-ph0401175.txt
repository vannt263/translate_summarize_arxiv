    "the ratios of the rates of the decays mentioned above are easily calculated through the expressions :    @xmath72    @xmath73    it is an interesting feature that the branching ratio for the leptonic decays of pions ( kaons ) into muons be much larger than the energetically favored decays in the electron channel . in fact , the branching ratios for @xmath74 , while for @xmath75 .",
    "the branching ratios for kaons show the same tendency : @xmath76 and @xmath77 .",
    "this due to the helicity suppression phenomena .",
    "in fact , the weak interaction current contains the left - handed projection operator which , in the massless limit , produces only left - handed particles and right - handed antiparticles .",
    "however , due to angular momentum conservation , the decay of a spin zero particle to massless @xmath78 is forbidden because the lepton would require to have combined angular momentum @xmath79 .",
    "thus the amplitude for the leptonic decays would vanish for @xmath80 .",
    "but when @xmath81 , the muon ( electron ) is in a state of mixed helicities , which allows the decay .",
    "since the coefficient of the positive helicity state in the mixed state is proportional to the muon ( electron ) mass , it is clear that a decay into a state of higher mass is prefered ; similar considerations apply to the kaon decays @xcite .",
    "it can also be noticed ( see table i ) that the ratios of the decay rates for kaons are lower by an order of magnitude relative to pions .",
    "this is because , due to the larger mass of the kaon , as compared to that of pion , a stronger helicity suppression of the electron mode relative to the muon mode is required .",
    "this argument leads us to expect that the amplitudes of leptonic decays of pions and kaons in the medium decrease considerably , since the masses of these mesons increase with density .",
    "we present in table i our results for the decay rates and ratios involved in the decays @xmath0 and @xmath1 in the vacuum , in comparison with experimental results .",
    "we can see that there is a good overall agreement ; the reason for the value of the kaons width being not so good is due to the fact that the value for @xmath82 in the njl model is lower than the experimental value ( exp : 113 mev , njl 97.7 mev ) and @xmath82 enters explicitly in the expression for this width ( see eq .",
    "10 ) .",
    "now let us discuss our results at finite density .",
    "we consider here the case of asymmetric quark matter imposing the condition of @xmath3 equilibrium and charge neutrality through the following constraints , respectively on the chemical potentials and densities of quarks and electrons : @xmath90 , with @xmath91 @xcite .",
    "as it has been discussed by several authors , this version of the njl model exhibits a first order phase transition @xcite .",
    "an interesting feature of quark matter in weak equilibrium is that at densities above @xmath92 the mass of the strange quark becomes lower than the chemical potential what implies the occurrence of strange valence quarks in this regime .",
    "this fact leads to meaningful effects on the behavior of meson observables @xcite .    in order to understand our results for @xmath93 and @xmath94 as functions of the density , we plot first ( see fig .",
    "2 ) the masses of the charged kaons and pions as well as its decays constants as functions of the density , and we can see the splitting between charge multiplets ( fig . 2 a ) ) : the increase of the masses of @xmath95 and @xmath96 with respect to those of @xmath97 and @xmath98 is due to fermi blocking . at the critical density",
    "the antikaons enter in the continuum , but they become again bound states above @xmath99 .      as for the pion decay constants ( fig . 2 b ) ) , although there is a splitting for moderate densities , as the density increase they go assimptotically to zero , which is an indication of the restoration of chiral symmetry in the non - strange sector .",
    "the decrease is more moderate for the kaon decay constant , which reflects the fact that chiral symmetry is weakly restored in the strange sector .",
    "the region of densities ( @xmath100 ) where the @xmath97 decay constant is flat corresponds to the region where this meson lies in the continuum .",
    "concerning the decay rate @xmath101 , a similar behavior to the observed with temperature @xcite is expected with density , but , since in the medium considered here there is flavor asymmetry , there is a meaningful difference between the behavior of @xmath102 at low densities ( see fig .",
    "3 a ) , upper panel ) , which is due the interplay between the behavior of the pion masses and decay constants . as the density increases , the two decay constants become closer , and goes to zero and , since @xmath103 has a dominant effect , the decay rates become almost degenerated and vanishing .",
    "a similar behavior is found for the charged kaons , although less pronounced , as expected ( fig .",
    "3 a ) , lower panel ) .",
    "we notice that , as the density increases , on one side , due to the increase of the meson masses , the phase space available ( @xmath104 increases ; on the other side @xmath56 decreases and this is the dominant effect in the decay rates .",
    "notice that the current of quarks bound inside the mesons is represented by @xmath105 ( see eq .",
    "( 7 ) ) , therefore the decrease of @xmath56 is an indication that the quark current becomes weaker , meaning that the mesons became less quark bound states .      concerning the ratios , @xmath94 , in the vacuum they are very small , due to helicity suppression as explained before .",
    "in the medium , since there is a splitting between the mesons masses , the phase space available is different for different charge multiplets and , therefore we observe a splitting in @xmath94 ( fig .",
    "3b ) ) . but as the density increases the phase space available for the decay into muons becomes closer to the one for the decay into electrons : @xmath106 due to the increase of meson masses .            , _ phys . rev . _",
