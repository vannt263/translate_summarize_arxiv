    "the relativistic mean field ( rmf ) theory @xcite has been very successful in describing the ground state ( zero temperature ) properties of nuclei over the entire periodic table in recent years .",
    "the binding energies , charge radii and the ground state deformations are reproduced very well ; the charge distributions also compare extremely well with the experimental data .",
    "this theory has proved to be very fruitful in explaining @xcite various details of exotic nuclei near the drip lines .",
    "in contrast to the nonrelativistic models , the rmf theory uses a single set of parameters to explain all these properties . to our knowledge , this approach has not yet been exploited to understand the properties of hot nuclei except some preliminary investigations for closed - shell nuclei @xcite .",
    "the response of nuclear shapes to thermal excitations , for example , has been experimentally studied from the shapes of the giant dipole resonances ( gdr ) built on excited states @xcite .",
    "theoretically such finite temperature effects have been studied till date in the nonrelativistic framework such as the hartree - fock - bogoliubov ( hfb ) theory @xcite and the landau theory of phase transition @xcite .",
    "such theories qualitatively explain , for example , the temperature evolution of nuclear shapes .",
    "recent experiments indicate , however , that a quantitative estimate of the persistence of the ground state deformation @xcite with temperature may be missing in some cases .    against this backdrop , we undertake the study of the thermal response to nuclear properties , particularly the deformation and the level density in the rmf framework .",
    "the hfb calculations employ a model hamiltonian in a limited model space with pairing - plus - quadrupole interaction .",
    "this may not be very realistic once temperature comes into play . moreover , to make the calculations numerically tractable , an inert core is assumed .",
    "this may be questionable at moderately high temperatures .",
    "the rmf approach we use is effectively free from these limitations .",
    "the model space employed is sufficiently large and all the nucleons are treated on equal footing .    in the present work ,",
    "we employ the nonlinear @xmath7 version of the rmf theory @xcite . in absence of a simple relativistic prescription for the pairing interaction ,",
    "it is introduced phenomenologically .",
    "we take two representative systems , namely , @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "we investigate the thermal evolution of the nuclear shapes and the pairing gaps .",
    "the temperature dependence of the specific heat as a possible signature of phase transition in pairing and nuclear shapes is explored .",
    "the temperature variation of the nuclear level density parameter which has a pre - eminent role in understanding nuclear reactions is further studied .",
    "effects of thermal fluctuations of the nuclear shapes on the deformation and the nature of the phase transition is also discussed .",
    "the theoretical framework used is briefly discussed in sec.ii .",
    "the results and discussions are presented in sec.iii and the sec.iv contains the concluding remarks .",
    "the lagrangian density for the nucleon - meson many - body system @xcite is taken as @xmath8 the meson fields included are the isoscalar @xmath9 meson , the isoscalar - vector @xmath10 meson and the isovector - vector @xmath11 meson .",
    "the arrows in eq .",
    "( [ lag ] ) denote the isovector quantities .",
    "the largrangian contains a nonlinear scalar self - interaction term @xmath12 of the @xmath9 meson : @xmath13 this term is important for appropriate description of the surface properties @xcite .",
    "the quantities @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the nucleon , @xmath9 , @xmath10 and the @xmath18meson masses , respectively , while @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the corresponding coupling constants for the mesons and the photon .",
    "the field tensors of the vector mesons and of the electromagnetic fields have the following structure : @xmath23    the variational principle gives the equations of motion .",
    "the mean field approximation is introduced at this stage by treating the fields as @xmath24numbers or classical fields .",
    "this results in a set of coupled equations , namely the dirac equation with potential terms for the nucleons and the klein - gordon type equations with sources for the mesons and the photon . for the static case , along with the time reversal invariance and charge conservation the equations get simplified .",

    "a constrained calculation is performed to generate the free energies for the deformations away from the equilibrium value .",
    "average value of a quantity then can be obtained as @xmath52 where @xmath53 and @xmath54 is the expectation value of the operator @xmath55 at a fixed value of @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "the quantity @xmath58 is a measure of the probablity for the nucleus to have deformation @xmath56 at the temperature @xmath57 .",
    "we have chosen @xmath0 and @xmath1 as two representative systems for our calculations .",
    "the results presented are obtained using the nlsh parameter set @xcite for the values of the coupling constants and masses for the mesons and nucleons .",
    "the pairing strength @xmath46 is taken to be @xmath59 and @xmath60 for protons and neutrons , respectively ; they reasonably reproduce the observed pairing gaps at zero temperature obtained from odd - even mass differences .",
    "the values of the chemical potential and the pairing gap are determined using all the single particle states up to @xmath61 above the fermi surface without assuming any core , i.e. , the mean field solution is generated by taking into account all the nucleons in the systems considered .    at finite temperatures ,",
    "the nucleus is not strictly in thermal equilibrium . in order to treat the system as an isolated one in equilibrium",
    ", one has to take into account corrections due to excitations of nucleons in the continuum .",
    "this is generally done through a subtraction procedure , by treating the liquid plus vapour phase together and then the vapour phase seperately @xcite .",
    "however , calculations of the nuclear level density parameter at finite temperature show that the results are insensitive @xcite to the continuum corrections for @xmath57 upto @xmath62 3 mev ; we have therefore not included the effects due to the continuum in the present calculations as temperatures above it are not relevant .    in subsec.3.1 , the results for the most probable values ( i.e , the mean field values ) of the different observables are presented . with increasing temperature ,",
    "thermal fluctions build up which may shift the average values from the most probable ones . in subsec.3.2",
    ", we discuss the results with the inclusion of thermal fluctuations .",
    "fluctuations in both the @xmath56 and @xmath63- degrees of freedom of the nuclear shape should be incorporated , however , because of simplicity and computational economy , we have included only the @xmath56- fluctuations in the present calculations .",
    "we have calculated the most probable values of the quadrupole deformation parameter , neutron and proton pairing gaps , heat capacity and the level density parameters for the aforesaid systems as a function of temperature .    in fig .",
    "1 , the variation of the quadrupole deformation parameter @xmath56 as a function of temperature is shown .",
    "the ground state deformations obtained here are almost close to the ones calculated in refs.@xcite using nonrelativistic mean field theory with pairing plus quadrupole ( p+q ) interaction .",
    "the nature of the temperature dependence of the deformation in the two cases are also not very different . however , whereas in the nonrelativistic case the phase transition from prolate to spherical shape occurs at @xmath641.8 mev , in the present case the said transition is found at a higher temperature , @xmath642.7 mev .",
    "the signature of the phase - transition can be inferred by examining other observables like heat capacity which we consider later .    in fig .",
    "2 , the results for the evolution of the neutron and proton pairing gaps with temperature are displayed .",
    "for both the nuclei the pairing gaps monotonically decrease with the increase in temperature .",
    "it is seen that for both the nuclei , the neutron pairing gaps vanish almost at the same temperature @xmath640.4 mev ; similarly the proton pairing gaps vanish at @xmath640.45 mev .",
    "these results are not much in variance with those obtained in the nonrelativistic p+q model .",
    "the vanishing of the nuclear deformation and the pairing gaps with temperature indicates that there is a shape transition from prolate to spherical and also a transition from the superfluid phase to the normal phase . to understand the nature of the transitions , the heat capacity at various temperatures",
    "are calculated .",
    "the specific heat @xmath65 for a given temperature is obtained using @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the excitation energy of the nucleus . in fig .",
    "3 , the temperature variation of the specific heat for @xmath0 and @xmath1 nuclei is plotted . at @xmath68 0.4 mev ,",
    "two closely seperated peaks in the @xmath69 curves are seen .",
    "they correspond to the dissolution of the neutron and proton pairing gaps .",
    "these are the characteristic signatures of second order phase transitions from superfluid to normal phase .",
    "it is further noted that the heat capacities for the two systems have broad bumps at @xmath2 mev .",
    "this signifies a weak second order phase transition corresponding to the transition of the nuclear shape .",
    "this result is at variance with those obtained in the p+q model or in the nonrelativistic calculation @xcite based on the landau theory of phase transitions where a strong second order phase transition is observed .",
    "we now present the results for the temperature dependent level density parameter @xmath70 .",
    "the parameter @xmath70 can be obtained using the excitation energy and the entropy as follows , @xmath71 the parameter @xmath70 obtained using above eqs .",
    "( [ ae ] ) and ( [ as ] ) would be equal provided it is independent of temperature @xcite . in fig .",
    "4 , the inverse level density parameter @xmath72 ( @xmath47 is the mass number of the nucleus ) is plotted as a function of temperature .",
    "the subscripts @xmath73 and @xmath74 are used to distinguish the two definitions given by eqs .",
    "( [ ae ] ) and ( [ as ] ) , respectively . at lower temperature , both @xmath75 and @xmath76 shoot up due to the collapse of the pairing gaps . at higher temperatures , @xmath75 and @xmath76",
    "are quite close to each other and there is no appreciable variations in their values in the temperature range considered .",
    "this is due to the weak transition of the nuclear shapes from deformed to spherical at @xmath77 mev .    in order to test the sensitivity of the results presented above to the choice of the parameter set and the model space , we have repeated the calculations for the nucleus @xmath0 with the nl3 parameter set @xcite . in comparison to the results for nlsh parameter set it",
    "is found that the nl3 parameter set gives slightly larger ( @xmath78 ) value of the ground state deformation .",
    "for @xmath79 , the values of deformation obtained in both nlsh and nl3 parameter sets are almost identical .",
    "the temperature evolution of the pairing gaps and level density parameters are practically the same with the two parameter sets .",
    "we extend the model space to include single particle states upto @xmath80 above the fermi surface instead of @xmath81 as used above .",
    "for this extended model space the pairing strength @xmath46 is adjusted to reproduce the ground state pairing gap .",
    "we do not find significant changes in the values of deformation parameter and the pairing energy in the temperature range of interest ( @xmath82 mev ) .",
    "in the extended model space , the value of the inverse level density parameter is also nearly the same .",
    "the model space used is thus found to be sufficient for our calculations . to estimate the importance of the continuum corrections to the inverse level density parameter we calculated the occupancy , @xmath83 , of the single - particle states with positive energy . for @xmath84 mev",
    "practically there is no particle in the positive energy states ( @xmath85 ) and at the highest temperature of interest studied @xmath86 which is very small .",
    "thus it is expected that the continuum corrections may not play an important role in the temperature range we study .",
    "the continuum effects may grow stronger for @xmath87 mev , however , this is beyond the transition temperatures and so we have not taken this into account .",
    "the shape transition temperature and the inverse level density parameter obtained in the present model are higher compared to those calculated in the ( p+q ) model @xcite . moreover , in the later model",
    ", the deformation falls to zero sharply whereas in the present case , this fall is comparatively a little slower .",
    "the origin of these differences can be attributed to the single - particle level spectra . in fig.5 ,",
    "the energy levels for the different proton orbitals around the fermi surface for the nucleus @xmath1 at @xmath57=3.0 mev are displayed .",
    "also the proton single - particle energies in the ( p+q ) model are shown at this temperature . in both models",
    "the orbits are spherical at this temperature .",
    "the striking difference between the orbitals in the two models is the large energy gap across the fermi surface in the rmf model .",
    "similar is the case for neutrons .",
    "these tend to reduce the entropy and the excitation energy and hence the level density parameter .",
    "the increase in the shape transition temperature ( by @xmath62 0.9 mev ) in the rmf model as compared to the p+q model may be traced back to the specific level structure and the gap across the fermi surface in the two models and their thermal response .",
    "experimental data on giant dipole resonances built on excited states give estimates of the average values of nuclear deformation at finite temperatures .",
    "they can be calculated by taking into account the thermal fluctuation effects around the most probable value .",
    "nuclei being finite systems , one expects that thermal fluctuations would play an important role in the quantitative estimation of various nuclear observables at finite temperatures .",
    "in fact , it has been shown in ref@xcite that the experimental data on gdr built on the excited states can be explained reasonably only if the effects from the thermal fluctuations of all the quadrupole degrees of freedom for nuclear shape are included . in the following , we consider the thermal fluctuations only in the @xmath56 degree of freedom .",
    "inclusion of fluctuations in the @xmath63-degrees of freedom is very involved and computer - intensive and therefore not considered presently .",
    "we perform constrained calculations for free energy at fixed deformations @xmath56 .",
    "the free energy surface shows multiple minima for temperatures below the shape transition temperature .",
    "the average value of @xmath56 is calculated using eq.(27 ) . in fig.6",
    ", we have displayed the plots of free energy surface @xmath88 for @xmath1 at a few temperatures ranging from 2.0 to 3.0 mev where @xmath88 is measured from the lowest minimum ( prolate in the present case ) at the corresponding temperature .",
    "for @xmath57 = 2.0 mev , the free energy surface has minima at @xmath89 and 0.23 .",
    "the free energy difference between these two minima is 0.70 mev ( i.e. @xmath90 ) . as the temperature approaches the shape transition temperature ( @xmath642.7 mev ) ,",
    "both the minima in the free energy surface merge and flatten the bottom part of the free energy surface .",
    "this is evident from the middle panel of fig.6 corresponding to @xmath91 2.65 mev . with further increase in temperature , the free energy surface with single minimum at zero deformation broadens .",
    "the variation of the average deformation ( @xmath92)as a function of temperature obtained through eq.([average ] ) for @xmath1 is shown in fig.7 .",
    "the average value of @xmath56 differs significantly from its most probable value ( see fig .",
    "1 ) for temperatures above 1 mev .",
    "the reason for such differences can be understood as follows .",
    "the free energy surface for @xmath1 at low temperatures ( @xmath93 mev ) shows two well seperated minima .",
    "one of these minima lies at prolate deformation ( @xmath94 ) and the other one is at oblate deformation ( @xmath95 ) .",
    "their difference @xmath96 as a function of temperature is shown in fig.8 . for @xmath97 mev , @xmath98 decreases monotonically to zero .",
    "the initial rise of @xmath98 can be attributed to the quenching of the pairing correlations ; it is seen that without pairing , @xmath98 decreases uniformly with temperature .",
    "the decrease in @xmath98 enhances the probability of finding the nucleus with oblate deformation and hence the average deformation is smaller than the most probable one for temperatures below the transition temperature .",
    "the deviation of the average deformation from the most probable value is also governed by @xmath99 . here , @xmath100 and @xmath101 are the deformations corresponding to the prolate and the oblate minima . with rise in temperature , they come closer and ultimately merge as shown in fig .",
    "the persistence of @xmath92 beyond the transition temperature is attributed to the asymmetry in the free energy surface as seen in the bottom panel of fig.6 .",
    "a similar behavior for @xmath0 is also seen .    in the mean field approximation ,",
    "the thermal evolution of the most probable value of the deformation is seen to be associated with two phase transitions , the first being a superfluid phase to normal phase transition at @xmath64 0.4 mev and the other a weak second order phase transition in the shape at @xmath68 2.7 mev .",
    "it would be interesting to see how thermal fluctuations affect these phase transitions . in fig .",
    "10 , the specific heat for the system @xmath1 is displayed as a function of temperature with inclusion of fluctuations . at low temperatures for @xmath102 mev , there is no perceptible change in the specific heat and thus the transition from superfluid to normal phase is not affected by fluctuations . at a little higher temperature ,",
    "however , the broad bump seen in fig.3 at @xmath103 2.7 mev is seen to be shifted to @xmath62 1.6 mev and becomes also a little sharper .",
    "the phase transition in nuclear shape thus occurs at a lower temperature and is not as weak as seen in the mean field approximation .",
    "normally , one would expect the phase transition to get diluted due to presence of fluctuations . here",
    "one sees the opposite .",
    "the evolution of the free energy and the energy profiles with temperature showing two minima ( one prolate and the other oblate ) in deformation space is responsible for this observation . here",
    "the role of thermal fluctuations becomes significant only in the intermediate temperature domain ( temperature in the range 1 - 2.5 mev , approximately ) due to decrease in @xmath104 and @xmath105 ( see figs . 8 and 9 ) .",
    "the delicate interplay of these quantities in the averaging augurs a change in the heat capacity signalling a somewhat sharper shape transition at a lower temperature compared to the most probable one .",
    "the effect of thermal fluctuations of the shape coordinate @xmath56 on the inverse level density parameter @xmath106 for the system @xmath1 is shown in fig.11 .",
    "the full line and the dashed line correspond to results of our calculations for @xmath76 and @xmath75 , respectively .",
    "the corresponding lines with circles represent those with inclusion of the fluctuations .",
    "it is seen that the fluctuations shift the minima for @xmath76 and @xmath75 from 2.7 mev to 1.6 mev , the corresponding transition temperature . beyond the transition temperature , the upward slope for @xmath106",
    "is also found to be higher with fluctuations included .",
    "similar is the behavior for @xmath0 .",
    "the relativistic mean - field approach together with pairing effects included through the constant gap approximation has been applied to study some properties of axially deformed @xmath0 and @xmath1 nuclei at finite temperature .",
    "the temperature dependence of the quadrupole shape for both the nuclei are found to be practically the same ; similar is the case for the pairing gaps .",
    "the deformation remains close to its ground state value ( @xmath107 0.3 ) for @xmath57 less than 1.5 mev and falls to zero quite sharply at @xmath642.7 mev .",
    "pairing gaps vanish at @xmath57 = 0.4 - 0.5 mev leading to transition from a superfluid phase to normal phase . compared with the results obtained in the nonrelativistic mean field framework , the relativistic calculations yield vanishing pairing gaps at practically the same temperature and the fall is a bit slower",
    ". the evolution of the heat capacity with temperature and the transition from superfluid to normal phase do not behave very differently .",
    "the nature of the shape transition obtained in the two approaches are also not too different except that in the present case , the approach of the deformation to zero is relatively slower .",
    "this slower fall results in a broad bump in the specific heat around the shape transition temperature ( @xmath108 2.7 mev ) .",
    "fluctuations are expected to influence the phase transitions . to explore these aspects ,",
    "we have taken into consideration thermal fluctuations in the @xmath109 degrees of freedom .",
    "the effects of fluctuations are found to be imperceptible below @xmath68 1 mev and therefore the pairing transitions are not affected .",
    "however , the influence on the shape transitions is found to be very significant ; the transition temperature drops down from @xmath103 2.7 mev to @xmath62 1.6 mev with inclusion of thermal fluctuations .",
    "it also becomes a little sharper .",
    "the specific nature of the free energy surface in the deformation space and its evolution with temperature are responsible for such a behavior .",
    "fluctuations in the @xmath110 degrees of freedom would also have a role to play in the phase transitions mentioned .",
    "we have not included these presently as they are computationally too intensive .",
