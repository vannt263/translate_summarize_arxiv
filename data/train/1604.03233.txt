    "long intervals ( @xmath5 @xmath6 year ) of accretion onto neutron stars in low - mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) cause the neutron stars to reach spin rates of many hundreds of times a second @xcite .",
    "slight geometric distortions ( @xmath7 on the star may lead to a quadrupole mass moment , for example , by a spin - misaligned temperature gradient arising from the deep crust of the neutron star @xcite . any such quadrupole moment will lead to persistent gravitational wave emission at twice the neutron star spin frequency ( @xmath8 ) . if one assumes that the accretion torque is balanced by the gravitational wave ( gw ) torque , the expected gravitational wave signal strength at earth is , @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the observed x - ray flux , @xmath11 is the spin frequency , @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the neutron - star radius and the mass , respectively @xcite . here",
    "the strain @xmath14 is the fractional change in the length of an interferometer arm ( for example ) .",
    "however , note that there are alternative explanations for the observed spin period distributions ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the strongest gravitational wave sources are likely those with short spin frequencies and high mass accretion rates @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , spin periods are still unknown for most of the brightest neutron - star binaries .",
    "spin measurements for about 20@xmath15 of the known lmxbs have been made by detecting persistent or transient x - ray intensity pulsations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , these phenomena have not been detected in the brightest lmxb sources . for sources that exhibit twin khz qpos ,",
    "spin frequencies have been estimated from the relationship between the twin khz qpo separation and the spin frequency ; i.e. , the khz qpo separation can be either the spin frequency or half the spin frequency @xcite .",
    "however , this may not be a reliable method of estimating the spin frequencies because the separations vary for some of the khz qpos @xcite .",
    "furthermore , comparison studies of the twin khz qpo separation and spin / burst oscillation frequency showed that there is no direct relationship between both phenomena ( @xcite ; hereafter w08 ) .",
    "inconsistencies of the relationship across sources has led to conclusions that the frequency difference of the twin khz qpos in neutron - star lmxbs can not be directly linked to the spin frequency @xcite .",
    "major obstacles in detecting gws from neutron - star binaries are the large parameter uncertainties of the system parameters ( w08 ) and the neutron - star spin uncertainty of the lmxb system .",
    "the parameter space that needs to be searched over is directly proportional to these uncertainties , and demands a large number of possible template models .",
    "therefore , minimizing the parameter space volume through improvements in the parameter uncertainties will contribute to a more sensitive and also a computationally less expensive search .",
    "gw searches have been already made with data from the intitial ligo detectors @xcite , focussing on the brightest of the known lmxbs , sco x-1 .",
    "the first search used a fully coherent search from the 2 month second science run ( s2 ) employing 6 hr of data .",
    "the second search used a method of cross - correlating the two outputs of the two ligo detectors utilizing 15 days of data from the fourth science ( s4 ) run @xcite .",
    "these searches were unsuccesful in detecting the signal likely due to the large uncertainties of the model parameters and limited computational power .",
    "another possible cause for the non - detection is that sco x-1 produces a very low gw amplitude . in our previous paper",
    ", we presented our results for sco x-1 , in order to improve the precision of the binary parameters @xcite .",
    "after sco x-1 , cyg x-2 is considered to be the best target for gw searches since it is x - ray bright and has an accessible optical counterpart .",
    "this low - mass x - ray binary , discovered in 1965 @xcite contains a neutron star and is also known as a z source .",
    "the neutron star accretes persistently near its eddington limit , and is a known thermonuclear burst source @xcite which confirms the neutron star nature of the compact object .",

    "@xcite placed an upper limit of @xmath26 on burst oscillation amplitudes between 1 and 256 hz using exosat data , while @xcite placed an upper limit of @xmath27 in the 200 - 600 hz frequency range using @xmath28 .",

    "<S> accreting neutron stars in low - mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) are candidate high - frequency persistent gravitational wave sources . these may be detectable with next generation interferometers such as advanced ligo / virgo within this decade . </S>",
    "<S> however , the search sensitivity is expected to be limited principally by the uncertainty in the binary system parameters . </S>",
    "<S> we combine new optical spectroscopy of cyg x-2 obtained with the liverpool telescope ( lt ) with available historical radial velocity data , which gives us improved orbital parameter uncertainties based on a 44-year baseline . </S>",
    "<S> we obtained an improvement of a factor of 2.6 in the orbital period precision and a factor of 2 in the epoch of inferior conjunction @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> the updated orbital parameters imply a mass function of 0.65 @xmath1 0.01 @xmath2 , leading to a primary mass ( @xmath3 ) of 1.67 @xmath1 0.22 @xmath2 ( for @xmath4 ) . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , we estimate the likely orbital parameter precision through to the expected advanced ligo and virgo detector observing period and quantify the corresponding improvement in sensitivity via the required number of templates . </S>"
