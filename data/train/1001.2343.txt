    "the fluctuation - dissipation theorem ( fdt ) is one of the cornerstones of modern statistical physics . roughly speaking ,",
    "the fluctuation - dissipation theorem states that for dynamical systems at statistical equilibrium the average response to small external perturbations can be calculated through the knowledge of suitable correlation functions of the unperturbed dynamical system .",
    "the fluctuation - dissipation theorem has great practical use in a variety of settings involving statistical equilibrium of baths of identical gas or liquid molecules , ornstein - uhlenbeck brownian motion , motion of electric charges , turbulence , quantum field theory , chemical physics , physical chemistry and other areas .",
    "the general advantage provided by the fluctuation - dissipation theorem is that one can successfully predict the response of a dynamical system at statistical equilibrium to an arbitrary small external perturbation without ever observing the behavior of the perturbed system , which offers great versatility and insight in understanding behavior of dynamical processes near equilibrium in numerous scientific applications @xcite . in particular , there has been a profound interest among the atmospheric / ocean science community to apply the fluctuation - dissipation theorem to predict global climate changes responding to variation of certain physical parameters @xcite , where the fdt has been used largely in its classical formulation @xcite . a vivid demonstration of high predictive skill in low - frequency climate response despite structural instability of statistical states is given in @xcite .",
    "recently , majda and the author @xcite developed and tested a novel computational algorithm for predicting the mean response of nonlinear functions of states of a chaotic dynamical system to small change in external forcing based on the fdt .",
    "the major difficulty in this situation is that the probability measure in the limit as time approaches infinity in this case is typically a sinai - ruelle - bowen probability measure which is supported on a large - dimensional ( often fractal ) set and is usually not absolutely continuous with respect to the lebesgue measure @xcite . in the context of axiom a attractors ,",
    "ruelle @xcite has adapted the classical calculations for fdt to this setting .",
    "the geometric algorithm ( also called the short - time fdt , or st - fdt algorithm in @xcite ) is based on the ideas of @xcite and takes into account the fact that the dynamics of chaotic nonlinear forced - dissipative systems often reside on chaotic fractal attractors , where the classical fdt formula of the fluctuation - dissipation theorem often fails to produce satisfactory response prediction , especially in dynamical regimes with weak and moderate chaos and slower mixing .",
    "it has been discovered in @xcite that the st - fdt algorithm is an extremely precise response approximation for short response times , and can be blended with the classical fdt algorithm with gaussian approximation of the state probability density ( quasi - gaussian fdt algorithm , or qg - fdt ) for longer response times to alleviate undesirable effects of expanding lyapunov directions ( which cause numerical instability in st - fdt for longer response times ) . further developing the st - fdt response algorithm for practical applications , in @xcite the author designed a computationally inexpensive method for st - fdt using the reduced - rank tangent map , and in @xcite the st - fdt algorithm",
    "is adapted for the response on slow variables of multiscale dynamics , which improves its computational stability and simultaneously reduces computational expense .",
    "however , dynamical systems describing real - world processes are often driven by a stochastic forcing . in this",
    "setting , the traditional approach is to use the classical fdt algorithm , which computes the linear response to small external forcing as a correlation function along a single long - term trajectory .",
    "typically , it is assumed that the single long - term trajectory samples the statistical equilibrium state of the model , however , suitable generalizations for dynamics with time - periodic forcing can also be made @xcite .",
    "a significant drawback of the classical fdt approach is that its computational algorithm requires the statistical state probability density together with its derivative to be explicitly computed , which is typically not possible for complex nonlinear systems . usually , an approximation is used , such as the gaussian approximation with suitable mean state and covariance matrix @xcite . in this case , if the actual statistical state is far from the gaussian , the predicted response is usually considerably different from what is observed by direct model perturbation ( so called ideal response @xcite ) .",
    "on the other hand , the st - fdt response algorithm is observed to be consistently superior to the classical fdt with gaussian approximation for deterministic chaotic dynamical systems with strongly non - gaussian statistical states for response times before the numerical instability occurs . in this work",
    "we adapt the st - fdt linear response algorithm to be used with stochastically forced dynamics ( further called stochastic st - fdt , or sst - fdt ) . below we observe that the sst - fdt response algorithm , adapted to stochastically driven dynamics and blended with the qg - fdt algorithm to avoid numerical instability , is also generally superior to the classical fdt with gaussian approximation of the statistical state for both the additive and multiplicative noise , just as the st - fdt algorithm in @xcite for chaotic deterministic systems .",
    "the manuscript is organized as follows . in section [ sec : fdt_stoch ] we develop the sst - fdt formula for general time - dependent stochastically forced dynamics , and design a practical computational algorithm for autonomous dynamics with invariant probability measure . in section [ sec : l96_app ]",
    "we test the new algorithm for the stochastically driven lorenz 96 model @xcite .",
    "section [ sec : summary ] summarizes the results of this work .",

    "it can be solved as follows : let us first introduce the integrating factor @xmath45 ( an @xmath46 matrix ) given by the solution of the equation @xmath47 and represent @xmath40 as a product @xmath48 where @xmath49 is an @xmath50-vector .",

    "observe that the @xmath148 error shows the general difference between the fdt and ideal responses , while the correlation function shows the extent to which the responses are collinear ( that is , how well the location of the response is determined , without considering its magnitude )     +     +     +     +     +    in figure [ fig : l96_errors ] we display the @xmath148 relative errors between the ideal response operator and the fdt response operators , together with the intrinsic error in the ideal response operator ( which is the result of slight nonlinearity in the ideal response due to small but finite perturbations ) .",

    "on the other hand , the qg - fdt response is not precise ( reaching about 80% by the time @xmath153 ) , due to the fact that the invariant probability measure associated with the deterministic regime is highly non - gaussian , and most probably not continuous with respect to the lebesgue measure ( that is , it does not even possess a density ) .",

    "apparently , the level of noise in the two stochastically driven regimes @xmath141 and @xmath142 is insufficient to `` smooth out '' the invariant probability measure enough for it to resemble the gaussian state and to destabilize the computation of the tangent map .",
    "however , in the @xmath143 multiplicative noise regime , the errors in the initial qg - fdt response are reduced to about 40% , which is due to the fact that in this regime the invariant probability measure is closer to the gaussian state because of strong noise .",

    "although the linear response operator at a given time is an @xmath157 matrix , it has the property of translational invariance ( just like the l96 model itself ) , and , thus , can be averaged along the main diagonal with wrap - around aliasing of rows ( or columns ) into a single vector .",

    "this is probably the consequence of the fact that the strong multiplicative noise changes the invariant probability density of the sl96 model to the point where it is relatively close to the gaussian . for other regimes ,",

    "the classical fluctuation - dissipation theorem , by its design , is suitable for computing the linear response for stochastically driven systems , as it assumes the continuity of the probability measure of the statistical ensemble distribution with respect to the lebesgue measure ( which is guaranteed in many stochastically driven systems ) .",
    "however , the drawback of the classical fluctuation - response formula is that it requires the probability density together with its derivative ( or their suitable approximations ) explicitly in the response formula .",

    "this formula is the analog of the general linear response formula @xcite for chaotic ( but not stochastically driven ) nonlinear systems .",
    "we demonstrate that , before the numerical instability due to positive lyapunov exponents occurs , the sst - fdt for the stochastically driven lorenz 96 model is generally superior to the classical fdt formula where the probability density of the statistical state is approximated by the gaussian density with the same mean and covariance ( qg - fdt ) .",
