    "complex plasmas are low - temperature plasmas including dust particles , typically in the micrometer range .",
    "these are dusty plasmas , which are specially prepared to study fundamental processes in the strong coupling regime on the most fundamental level when the observation of individual motion of particles and their interactions is possible . under microgravity conditions",
    "realized either in parabolic flights@xcite or onboard the international space station ( iss),@xcite such relatively weak forces as the ion drag force and the interparticle interactions become important and often determine the motion and structure formation in complex plasma . since the mobility of electrons is much greater than that of ions ,",
    "particles acquire a significant negative electric charge .",
    "this leads to formation of a strongly coupled plasma,@xcite in which large volumes of almost homogeneous three - dimensional complex plasma can be observed .",
    "this strongly coupled open system can exhibit a number of nonequilibrium phase transitions . among them , one of the most vivid effects is the lane formation when two kinds of particles are driven against each other .",
    "if the driving forces are strong enough like particles form `` stream lines '' and move collectively in lanes , which show an anisotropic structural order accompanied by a considerable enhancement of the particle mobility",
    ". examples of this phenomenon include driven bi - layer systems and two - species lattice gases,@xcite granular mixtures,@xcite molecular ions,@xcite highly populated pedestrian zones,@xcite and driven colloidal mixtures.@xcite lane formation in three - dimensional complex plasma of a dust cloud in the radio frequency low - pressure gas discharge was observed in refs .  .",
    "lane formation in complex plasmas is a special issue for two reasons .",
    "first , only one species of the dust particles is driven while the second one is quiescent .",
    "note that in this case , the only difference between the two species is the particle radius . obviously , this peculiarity is not of principal nature .",
    "second , the driving force is not an external one but it is a sum of the internal forces acting on the particle in plasma . in most cases ,",
    "these forces are the oppositely directed electric and ion drag forces , which can not be directly controlled . moreover , while , e.g. , the driving force in colloidal mixtures is treated as a preassigned parameter , it is not known for complex plasmas .",
    "thus , calculation of the driving force becomes a separate problem , which is addressed in this work .",
    "the force acting on an isolated dust particle is well - known.@xcite however , this approach is inappropriate for the strongly coupled dust cloud where the interparticle interactions are quite essential . in the recent studies,@xcite",
    "the electric and ion drag forces are calculated assuming that the coulomb potentials of neighboring particles overlap .",
    "this provides an interpretation for the particle number density in a dust cloud and determines a relationship between the number densities of all plasma charge carriers and the particle charge .",
    "we will term the force acting on an individual probe particle of the radius @xmath0 that finds itself in a dust cloud of particles of the radius @xmath1 the driving force .",
    "surprisingly , calculation of this force based on the model of similar complex plasmas ( sp)@xcite results in the force vanishing .    in this work",
    ", we will show that the _ nonzero _ driving force is a net result of the fact that the ion mean free path with respect to the collisions against neutrals can be comparable with the interparticle distance , which was not taken into account in ref .  .",
    "if we calculate the total mean free path with due regard for the ion scattering on the dust particles then the ionization equation of state ( ieos ) is modified so that the driving force does not vanish . in this way",
    ", we derive the modified model of similar complex plasmas ( msp ) .",
    "the calculation using msp shows that if @xmath2 , the larger _ subsonic _ particle that we term the probe moves through the dust cloud _ along _ the ion flux toward the outer boundary of a dust cloud , in correspondence with the experiments . for the larger supersonic particle ,",
    "the estimations show that due to the absence of a spherical cavity around the moving particle the ion drag force is much weaker than in the case of a subsonic particle .",
    "hence , the driving force is not much different from the electric force and the probe velocity is directed against the ion drag force toward the discharge center .",
    "the developed approach can be used as an ansatz for development of the theory of lane formation in complex plasmas .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ s2 ] , the ieos for the stationary dust cloud obtained in our previous studies is generalized to include the effect of finite ion mean free path affected by the collisions against dust particles . in sec .",

    "the results of this study are summarized in sec .",

    "consider a stationary dust cloud in the low - pressure gas discharge . here and in sec .",
    "[ s3 ] , we imply that the particles forming a cloud have the same radius . under microgravity conditions ,",
    "a dust particle is subject to three basic forces , namely , the electric driving force , the ion drag force arising from scattering of the streaming ions on dust particles , and the neutral drag force ( friction force ) due to collisions of the atoms against the moving particles . for a stationary cloud ,",
    "the latter force vanishes . note that in a strongly coupled system , the correlation energy originating from particle ordering results in the difference between the volume - averaged electric field and the electric field at the point of particle location .",
    "this effect can be included if we introduce the dust pressure .",
    "the effect of this pressure on the force balance equation in a stationary plasma is in most cases negligible ; however , it is responsible for propagation of a perturbation.@xcite the electric field driving force @xmath3 and the ion drag force @xmath4 acting on unit volume can be written in the form @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the dust particle charge in units of the electron charge , @xmath7 is the elementary electric charge , @xmath8 is the particle number density , @xmath1 is the particle radius , @xmath9 is the electron temperature , @xmath10 is the dimensionless potential of a dust particle , @xmath11 is the electric field strength , @xmath12 is the electron number density , and @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the ion mean free path , @xmath15 is the ion number density , and @xmath16 is a dimensionless free parameter . equation ( [ e2 ] ) implies that the cross section of momentum transfer from the ions to dust particles is @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the dust particle wigner  seitz cell radius .",

    "the difference between the theoretical estimate and experiment may also arise from a significant error of eq .",
    "( [ e2 ] ) at high ion drift velocity comparable with their thermal velocity , which is characteristic of experiment.@xcite another source of error could be the neglect of the mechanisms of particle charging other than the oml approximation such as the ion - neutral collisions.@xcite it was demonstrated that neglect of the collision effect overestimates somewhat the particle charge but this effect is small at the gas pressure less than @xmath141 and @xmath142 .",

    "we have modified our approach developed recently to include the effect of the ion collisions against the particles forming the cloud .",
    "this effect results in shortening the ion mean free path and , consequently , in the decrease of the moment transfer from the ions to the dust particles , i.e. , to the decrease of the ion drag force .",
    "however , we have shown that the modified ieos can be written in the form proposed in the early study.@xcite at the same time , the modified ieos extends the range of plasma parameters considerably .",
    "thus , it shifts the ieos critical point toward much higher number densities of the ions , electrons , and particles .",
    "fortunately , the velocity of dust acoustic waves calculated with the modified ieos has a minor difference from that calculated with the initial version of ieos and therefore , it still matches the experimental data .",
    "in contrast to our early model ( sp ) , in which the driving force vanishes , the modified model ( msp ) yields a nonzero force , whose direction is uniquely defined by the ratio between the radius of the probe and of the dust particle .",
    "namely , if the probe is smaller than a dust particle then the probe moves toward the discharge center against the ion flux , and the large probe moves in the same direction as the ions .",

    "<S> an example of the non - equilibrium phase transition is the formation of lanes when one kind of particles is driven against the other . according to experimental observation , </S>",
    "<S> lane formation in binary complex plasmas occurs when the smaller particles are driven through the stationary dust cloud of the larger particles . </S>",
    "<S> we calculate the driving force acting on a probe particle that finds itself in a quiescent cloud of particles in complex plasma of the low - pressure radio frequency discharge under microgravity conditions . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that the nonzero driving force is a result of the dependence of the ion mean free path on the particle number density . </S>",
    "<S> if this effect is properly included in the model of similar complex plasmas then one arrives at the driving force that changes its sign at the point where the probe and the dust particles have equal radii . </S>",
    "<S> if the probe is smaller than the dust particle then the driving force is directed toward the discharge center and vice versa , in accordance with experiment . </S>",
    "<S> obtained results can serve as the ansatz for future investigation of the lane formation in complex plasmas . </S>"
