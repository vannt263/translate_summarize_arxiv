    "over the past two decades , electrons in two  dimensional ( 2d ) surface states on closed packed surfaces of noble metals have been at the center of much experimental and theoretical attention @xcite . for a pristine surface",
    "the energies of such states lay in the gap around the l point of the bulk brillouin zone and the wavefunctions are confined to the surface .",
    "the corresponding dispersion relations have been determined by angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy and they have been found to be 2d free  electron like parabolas @xcite .",
    "moreover , they are partially filled and hence the electrons , which fill them , form a 2d metal .",
    "the most interesting feature of this remarkable state of matter is its response to perturbations such as caused by placing transition metal atoms on the surface .",
    "as might be expected , such response displays long range , friedel like , charge oscillations governed by the 2d fermi surface. indeed , one of the iconal experiments in nano ",
    "technology has been the fabrication of a circular arrangement of 48 fe atoms on a cu ( 111 ) surface and the direct observation , by scanning tunneling microscopy ( stm ) , of such oscillations within the circle @xcite . in this paper",
    "we wish to discuss the , as yet unexplored , magnetic properties of such quantum corrals .",
    "until recently stm studies of atoms on well defined cu , ag and au ( 111 ) surfaces imaged only the charge distribution of the surface electrons @xcite .",
    "but now , remarkable developments in spin  polarized stm ( spstm )",
    "@xcite make the observing of spatial variations in the magnetic density a distinct possibility and , therefore , an attractive new area of research .",
    "evidently , this opens up the possibility of building magnetic nanostructures for both scientific and technological purposes .",
    "for instance , while the observation of a single fe or co atom on a cu surface may be beyond the spatial resolution of the first generation of spstms , the magnetic state of a single quantum corral of 50 - 100 atoms can be readily identified @xcite .",
    "the motivation behind the theoretical work reported here is the need to identify the principle conceptual issues which govern the physics , in general , and the magnetism , in particular , of such structures .",
    "individual impurities and clusters of impurities embedded in the above surface2d  host  metals have been studied for friedel oscillations around them @xcite , for rkky interactions between them @xcite and for a rich variety of kondo  like phenomena they are host to @xcite .",
    "clearly , all these effects can occur inside a corral with the interesting aspect that now the electronic structure of the host can be controlled by the geometry of the corral .",
    "it is perhaps useful to note that these circumstances are rather analogous to that of quantum wells in semiconductor physics @xcite .    in the semiclassical limit",
    "the states of the quantum corrals can be associated with classical orbits of particles bouncing off confining walls .",
    "depending on the shape of the corral the classical motions may be integrable or chaotic .",
    "thus , quantum corrals can serve as examples of quantum chaos at work @xcite .    clearly , to think about using different impurities , different substrates and/or different confining geometries one needs simple but reliable models as guides .",
    "in the unfamiliar physical circumstances at hand , an efficient way to such models is to perform large scale first ",
    "principles calculations including all conceivably relevant effects and in interpreting the results in terms of simple models .",
    "this is the approach we take in the present paper .",
    "our first ",
    "principles calculations are a spin  polarized and relativistic generalization of the pioneering work of hrmandinger and pendry @xcite and crampin and collaborators @xcite .",
    "we interpret our results in terms of a flat bottom circular potential well , non  relativistic , model . to illustrate the power of this approach , once it has been established that the model faithfully reproduces the main features of the results from first ",
    "principles calculations , properties which would be too difficult to calculate from first principles are estimated .",
    "within multiple scattering theory of the electronic structure the information about each atom ( scattering center ) is coded in the scattering path operator ( spo ) matrix , @xmath0 , with @xmath1 and @xmath2 being angular momentum indices referring to atomic sites whose position vectors are labeled by @xmath3 and @xmath4 , respectively , and @xmath5 being the energy . for scatterers described by non  overlapping ( muffin  tin ) potential wells , the spo matrix , @xmath6^{-1}\\quad,\\label{eq : realtau}%\\ ] ] describes the full hierarchy of scattering events between any two particular sites , @xmath3 and @xmath4 . in ,",
    "@xmath7 and @xmath8 denote the single  site _",
    "t_-matrices on the energy shell and the real - space structure constants , respectively @xcite .",
    "we begin our investigations by two fully self  consistent calculations : one for a semi ",
    "infinite cu with a ( 111 ) surface and another one for a single fe adatom on this semi  infinite host . in the first case , above the cu layers",
    "there are two layers of sites occupied by atomic cells without nuclear charge which we call empty sites , but we note that they do contain electronic charge and their electrostatic potential is calculated fully self  consistently . in the second type of self  consistent calculation , one empty site above the topmost cu layer is occupied by an fe atom .",
    "we then construct crystal potentials for further single pass , one - electron calculations according to the following recipe : within the corresponding atomic spheres , all fe sites are described by the potential as obtained from the single impurity calculation and all other sites are described by the appropriate potentials from the pristine surface calculation .",
    "the configurations of interest are those in which some empty sites in the layer above the topmost cu layer are replaced by fe atoms , forming thus the wall of a corral as shown in . clearly , by this construction ,",
    "at the level of the crystal potential , we are neglecting the influence of neighbouring fe atoms on each other .",
    "fortunately , this frozen potential approximation was shown to be reasonable in the case of fe adatoms on ag(100 ) @xcite .    for a given crystal potential constructed according to the above recipe we solve the multiple scattering problem by means of the embedding method @xcite . in short ,",
    "we embed a cluster of sites labeled by @xmath9 , consisting of the corral fe atoms and selected empty sites inside and outside the corral , in the unperturbed semi  infinite cu host .",
    "a particular cluster @xmath9 can then be treated as perturbation of the host . in practice",
    ", we first calculate the spo matrix of the 2d translational invariant layered host , @xmath10 , within the framework of the skkr method @xcite , where @xmath11 and @xmath12 denote layers and the @xmath13 are vectors in the surface brillouin zone ( sbz ) .",
    "the real  space spo matrix is then given by @xmath14 where the atomic position vectors are decomposed as @xmath15 and @xmath16 with @xmath17 and @xmath18 being 2d lattice vectors , @xmath19 and @xmath20 the so  called layer  generating vectors , and @xmath21 is the unit area of the surface brillouin zone .    by replacing the _ t_matrices of the unperturbed host , @xmath22 , with those of the cluster - atoms , @xmath23 ,",
    "leads to the following dyson like equation , @xmath24 ^{-1 } \\quad,\\label{eq : dyson}%\\ ] ] where @xmath25 is the spo matrix corresponding to all sites in cluster @xmath9 , from which in turn local quantities , such as the densities of states ( dos ) , magnetic densities of states ( mdos ) , spin and orbital moments , as well as the total energy can be calculated .",
    "note , that takes into account all scattering events both inside and outside the cluster .",
    "the 48 fe atoms forming the corral were positioned on the surface along a circle with a diameter of 28  @xmath26 , where @xmath26 is the 2d lattice constant of the fcc(111 ) cu surface .",
    "the investigated geometry is shown in the inset of .",
    "this is similar to a popular experimental one @xcite .",
    "the corral sites refer to the positions of an ideal fcc parent lattice with the experimental cu lattice constant , therefore , there is some deviation from the exact circular shape .",
    "the positions of the adatoms were chosen such that the spacing between them is approximately constant .",
    "within the interior of the corral the physical properties ( dos , mdos ) of 55 empty spheres along a diameter were calculated .",
    "note that the rotational symmetry of the considered structure is not continuous .",
    "nevertheless , to reduce the computational effort , we followed crampin _",

    "the potentials were treated within the atomic sphere approximation ( asa ) . for the calculation of the @xmath27matrices and for the multipole expansion of the charge densities , necessary to evaluate the madelung potentials , a cut  off of @xmath28 was used .",
    "the energy integrations were performed by sampling 16 points on a semicircular contour in the complex energy plane according to an asymmetric gaussian quadrature . both for the self  consistent calculation of the cu(111 ) surface and for the evaluation of we used 70 @xmath29points in the irreducible wedge of the sbz ( isbz ) .",

    "the mca energy , defined as the difference of the lsda total energy between an in  plane and a normal  to  plane orientation of the magnetization , yielded 4.3 mev .",
    "both of these results are consistent with those already reported in the literature @xcite .",
    "we note that the orientation of the magnetic moments in the quantum corral built up from fe atoms is , in principle , also affected by the so  called shape anisotropy , arising from the magnetostatic dipole",

    "@xcite , we have also calculated the spin  resolved densities of states ( lmdos ) which are also presented in . clearly , the lmdos is more structured than the ldos suggesting that the quantum well states are exchange split . to lend further credence to such an interpretation we calculated the sum of the ldos and lmdos , @xmath47 along a diameter of the corral .",

    "the ldos has a maximum at the center similarly to the @xmath63 bessel function .",

    "reassuringly , these spatial densities have minimum at the center . for higher energies",
    "this correspondence is not so clear , nevertheless , this comparison serves as an explanation why the shape of the peaks differs from that of an ideal lorentzian .",
    "the small features between the prominent peaks which can be seen in , and in the experimental results @xcite also show some systematic trends which we assume can be explained n terms of a the circular quantum well model based on a two  dimensional dirac equation .    turning to the lmdos at the central position , we note that in the upper panel in the prominent dos peaks are split into a pair of up and down peaks .",
    "this oscillatory behaviour of the lmdos is a consequence of the spin  polarization of the corral fe atoms , namely of the perturbation of the surface - state electrons by the fe atoms forming the corral .",
    "this exchange splitting can be reproduced in the circular well model by choosing @xmath68 appropriately .",
    "it turns out that for a good fit @xmath68 should be non  uniform in energy .",
    "the corresponding energy values with the exchange splitting terms estimated from are shown in b. thus , the prediction of the model is that if the fermi energy falls between an exchange  split doublet then the whole corral has a net magnetic moment of one bohr magneton in addition to the magnetization due to the fe atoms forming the wall .",
    "furthermore , such a moment will not be uniformly distributed within the corral but varies from empty  cell to empty  cell as required by the wavefunction of the confined surface state , namely , it oscillates like the charge density in . of course , even for a relatively small corral of @xmath58  @xmath26 , as indicated by the highly structured summed lmdos in the upper panel of , there are many states near the fermi energy and hence the local magnetic moment can vary rapidly with fermi energy and spatial location .",
