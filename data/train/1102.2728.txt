    "one of the remaining opened questions in nuclear physics is the equation of state ( eos ) of isospin asymmetric nuclear matter , @xmath0 the density dependence of the symmetry energy ( se ) .",

    "intermediate energy nuclear reactions involving radioactive beams have allowed , by studying the thickness of neutron skins , deformation , binding energies and isospin diffusion to constrain the density dependence of se at densities below saturation  @xcite .",
    "existing theoretical models describing its density dependence generally agree with each other in this density regime , but their predictions start to diverge well before regions with densities @xmath1 are reached  @xcite .",
    "heavy - ion collisions are the only available opportunity to recreate in laboratory fractions of nuclear matter with densities significantly above saturation density , presenting the opportunity for a quantitative study of the high - density behavior of the symmetry energy together with a few other closely related topics : in - medium nucleon - nucleon ( nn ) cross - sections , in - medium nucleon masses and the eos of symmetric nuclear matter .",
    "these topics are aspects of the same , more fundamental , problem : the in - medium nn interaction .",
    "a quantitative study of the density dependence of se demands the identification of observables which exhibit a large sensitivity to changes in its magnitude , but show small or no change with respect to variations of other variables or model parameters ( compressibility modulus , elastic nucleon - nucleon cross - sections , etc . ) .",
    "such observables have been a topic of intensive search during the last decade and a couple of promising candidates have been identified : the ratio of neutron / proton ratio of squeezed out nucleons  @xcite , light cluster emission  @xcite , @xmath2 multiplicity ratio in central collisions  @xcite , double neutron to proton ratios of nucleon emission from isospin - asymmetric but mass - symmetric reactions  @xcite , @xmath3 dependence of balance energy  @xcite and others .",

    "@xcite favor a stiff scenario .",
    "identifying observables that can be compared to currently existing or in the near future available experimental data is therefore of great importance .",
    "this work is devoted to the study of other two observables that have been previously shown to present an important sensitivity to changes in the isospin dependent part of eos : elliptic flow ( ef )  @xcite and neutron - proton elliptic flow difference ( efd )  @xcite .",
    "their dependence on the eos of both symmetric and asymmetric nuclear matter , microscopic nucleon - nucleon cross - sections and model parameters is studied in detail and exemplified for the case of au+au collisions at incident energy of 400 amev .",

    "the sensitivity of @xmath38 to the in - medium nn cross - sections is moderate in size with the exception of the case when a density dependence above @xmath43pt is considered .",

    "a monotonous dependence on the @xmath30 parameters is observed with the exception of peripheral collisions in conjunction with a super - soft asy - eos .",
    "a similar conclusion holds for neutrons with the exception of an opposite direction of the monotonous variation of the ef parameter with increasing @xmath30 .",

    "[ neutronprotonflowauau400]where the values of neutron ( left panel ) and proton ( right panel ) ef as a function of the parameter @xmath30 are plotted for mid - central collisions .",
    "we notice , additionally , that the difference @xmath44 is in magnitude larger than the observed sensitivity on the nn cross - sections in the left panel of figure  [ protonflowauau400 ] .    the most reliable extraction of the compressibility modulus @xmath5 of nuclear matter has been made possible by studying the multiplicity ratio of @xmath45 production in heavy ( au+au ) over light ( c+c ) nuclei at incident energies close to 1 agev by the kaos collaboration  @xcite pointing towards a soft eos . at lower incident energies",
    "the situation is not as clear : kaos result points to an even softer eos while the study of sidewards flow by the fopi collaboration  @xcite favors a soft or hard eos of state depending on system size .",
    "other studies related to either sidewards flow or elliptic flow produce similar indecisive results for collision energies of the order of a few hundreds mev  @xcite . in view of these results",

    "variations in the values of ef due to changes of the compressibility modulus @xmath5 are seen to exceed those due to changes in the asy - eos scenario .",
    "an additional indetermination of theoretical estimates is brought in by the value of the nucleon wave - packet width @xmath4 .",
    "its value is usually set in literature  @xcite to @xmath6=4 @xmath7 for light systems . for heavy systems",

    "variations of the ef magnitude when changing the value of @xmath4 to the one customarily employed for light nuclei or alternatively to the next larger value are sizable , of the same order of magnitude as for changes in @xmath5 from a soft to a hard eos .    to summarize , in this section we have shown that while the proton and neutron efs show important sensitivity to changes in the asy - eos , their equally large of even larger sensitivity to model parameters like compressibility modulus @xmath5 or nucleon wave packet width @xmath4 limits their usefulness in an attempt to constrain the supra - normal density dependence of se in a model independent fashion .",
    "this section is dedicated to an analysis , similar to the one performed for the case of proton ef in the previous section , of the neutron - proton elliptic flow difference ( npefd ) : @xmath47 . due to these similarities",
    "many of the details of the last section are identical and therefore have been omitted where possible .",
    "the interest in this observable stems from the following reasons .",
    "the net isospin effect to the total eos is rather small and additionally the pp and nn elementary cross - sections are taken to be the same .",
    "one would therefore expect that the sensitivity to model parameters of the nucleon elliptic flow @xmath48 is similar to the one of protons .",
    "an analysis similar to the one performed for protons confirms that to be true .",
    "in addition , the dependence of the @xmath38 and @xmath48 elliptic flows on the variable @xmath30 parametrizing the asy - eos is opposite , in line with expectations , due the fact that the neutron asy - potential is repulsive while the proton asy - potential is attractive . on the experimental side",
    ", an accurate measurement of this observable would prove challenging as neutron distributions are rather difficult to measure accurately .    in figure  ( [ npdiffsqueezeout ] ) a similar analysis as the one performed for protons in figure  [ protonflowauau400 ] but for npefd",
    "is presented .",
    "the left side panel presents the dependence of this observable on the choice of the asy - eos .",
    "the splitting between the extreme cases , @xmath31 and @xmath32 , is constant as a function of the impact parameter and its magnitude represents about 30 - 40@xmath49 of that of either neutron or proton ef the same energy and impact parameter .",
    "additionally , the sensitivity to in - medium @xmath17 nucleon - nucleon cross - sections is almost an order of magnitude smaller ( see right panel of figure  ( [ npdiffsqueezeout ] ) ) .    a study of the dependence on model parameters like compressibility modulus and width of the gaussian wave packet shows a sizable suppression",
    "as compared to the proton or neutron ef case , see fig .",
    "[ diffa2senseosal ] .",
    "the width of the bands in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ diffa2senseosal ] represents the sensitivity of npefd to changes of the isospin independent eos from a soft to hard one .",
    "the results for various choices of variable @xmath30 are clearly disentangled from each another .",
    "complementary , variations of npefd due to changes in @xmath4 , the nucleon wave packet width , are also small , of the order of the statistical error of the presented results .    the results presented in fig .",
    "[ npdiffsqueezeout ] ) and  [ diffa2senseosal ] for npefd recommend it as a viable observable for constraining the high density behavior of the asy - eos in a model independent way .",
    "the results presented in these figures were obtained by simulating au+au collisions at an incident energy of 400 amev and applying the fopi filter . in figure  ( [ npdiffsqueezendep ] )",
    "we extend that study by varying the impact energy from 150 amev to 800 amev together with a variable impact parameter .",
    "we plot the impact parameter dependence of @xmath50=npefd@xmath51$]-npefd@xmath52 $ ] for various colliding energies , a close to zero value for this variable signaling no sensitivity of npefd to asy - eos .",
    "the most favorable energy domain stretches from t=250 amev to almost t=600 amev and as energy increases in this interval the impact parameter window shrinks to mid - central collisions . for incident energies larger than 600 amev",
    "only mid - central collisions show important sensitivity of npefd to the asy - eos scenario but with decreasing magnitude as energy increases .",
    "the magnitude of the of the observed effect demands , for a successful constraining of the asy - eos , experimental data for the elliptic flow of both charged and neutral particles of high quality , of an accuracy of 1% or better .    we have saved for last a comparison of our estimates for npefd with the experimental values of neutron - hydrogen efd ( nhefd )  @xcite and neutron-proton efd ( npefd )  @xcite obtained by the fopi - land collaboration .",
    "in addition to charged particles , the fopi - land experiment has succeeded to measure azimuthal distributions of neutrons , providing experimental evidence of their elliptic flow .",
    "results for charged particles with @xmath53=1 ( hydrogen ) have also been published in ref .",
    "@xcite . extracting pure proton distributions",
    "is not straightforward as the calorimeter resolution of the fopi - land experimental setup is insufficient to separate the h isotopes . in ref .",
    "@xcite conservative cuts , that leave out the tail contributions of proton energy spectra while retaining some deuteron events , have been applied to extract proton spectra ( denoted here as proton or p in order to stress the difference from a pure proton spectrum ) .",
    "the fopi - land experimental values for proton elliptic flow should therefore be considered as rough estimates only , and due to the controversial method employed to extract them a comparison with theoretical estimates should be viewed with care .",
    "it is well known that flow of heavier isobars is stronger and as a result the values of @xmath54 represent upper values ( in absolute magnitude ) for @xmath38 , nhefd being therefore an upper value for npefd .",
    "the comparison of our estimates for npefd with the fopi - land nhefd and npeft experimental results is presented in figure  ( [ npefdfopiland ] ) , providing an upper limit to the softness of the asy - eos .",
    "a comparison with theoretical estimates of nhefd should provide tighter constraints ; work in that direction is in progress .",
    "the npefd experimental data show a scattered dependence on the impact parameter most likely due to the procedure employed to eliminate deuteron and triton events from experimental spectra .",
    "they are shown here in an attempt to stress that further refinements on the experimental side are necessary for a meaningful comparison of this observable to theoretical models .",
    "the asy - eos collaboration , a follow - up of the land , fopi and chimera collaborations , is planning to measure both proton and neutron azimuthal distributions with an increased accuracy which will have the potential to constrain of the high density dependence of asy - eos through observables like npefd .",
    "we have employed an isospin dependent qmd transport model to study the dependence of elliptic flow observables on the asy - eos .",
    "the proton and neutron elliptic flows show a monotonous dependence on the variable @xmath30 that parametrizes the various asy - eos employed , but in opposite directions for protons ans neutrons respectively . a sizable dependence of these observable on model parameters like the compressibility modulus @xmath5 , the width of the gaussian wave packet describing particles in qmd , @xmath4 , and to a lesser extent to in - medium effects on the microscopic nn cross - sections renders them useless for constraining , in a model independent way , the high density dependence of asy - eos .",
    "the neutron - proton elliptic flow difference shows ( npefd ) , in contrast , a sizable dependence on the asy - eos and a almost an order of magnitude smaller dependence on model parameters and nn in - medium cross - sections .",
    "a study of the dependence of its magnitude on collision energy and impact parameter leads to the conclusion that neutron - proton differential squeeze - out can be effectively used to constrain the asy - eos when measured in mid - central heavy - ion collisions at incident beam energies between 250 - 600 mev .",
    "nevertheless , an effective constraint of the asy - eos would require experimental values for the elliptic flow of both charged and neutral particles of an accuracy of 1% or better .    a comparison with existing experimental data for the neutron - hydrogen elliptic flow difference , due to the fopi - land collaboration , sets and upper limit on the softness of the asy - eos .",
    "the experimental values for the neutron - proton elliptic flow difference show a scattered dependence on the impact parameter , most likely due to the controversial method used in the analysis of the experimental data , and as such a comparison with theoretical estimates is unreliable and should be viewed with care .",
    "the asy - eos collaboration promises to remedy these shortcomings and together with a higher accuracy measurement of neutron and proton elliptic flows will potentially present the opportunity to constrain the high dependence of asy - eos through observables like neutron - proton elliptic flow difference .",
