    "ongoing developments in quantum information processing stimulate an intense search for physical systems suitable for its implementation . beside solid - state and photonic systems , cold ions and neutral atoms represent major candidates in this direction .",
    "neutral atoms can be accurately manipulated in dipole traps @xcite , optical lattices @xcite or on atom chips @xcite .",
    "advanced evaporative and laser - cooling techniques allow their preparation in the vibrational ground state of different trapping potentials .",
    "single ions can be confined in paul or penning traps @xcite and sideband laser cooling allows to cool them down to the trap ground state .",
    "ultracold systems combining ions and neutral atom are currently being explored @xcite .",
    "besides several new quantum mechanical aspects of this system , the studies are motivated by potential applications .",
    "for example techniques of sympathetic cooling of trapped atoms by laser - cooled trapped ions can be developed @xcite . in this paper",
    "we propose a scheme for a quantum gate that combines the advantages of atoms and ions for quantum computation .",
    "the trapping potentials of atoms and ions , although both built up with oscillating electromagnetic fields , do not interfere with each other , since the oscillation frequencies of the respective fields typically differ by orders of magnitude . the strength of the effective ion potential can be much stronger than for neutral atoms .",
    "tight confinement enables fast transport and together with the good addressability of single trapped ions with lasers , this is among the advantages of ions for implementing quantum computation .",
    "realization of the mott insulator phase allows to prepare an array of atoms with well controlled number of particles in a single site of an optical lattice . in comparison to ions",
    "the possibility to prepare an array of atoms in the mott insulator phase in an optical lattice combined with the long decoherence times of neutral atoms is a reason to use atoms for the storage of quantum information .",
    "furthermore , the two - particle interaction of an atom and an ion is typically much stronger than for two neutral atoms , which allows fast gate operations .",
    "while qubits can be stored in internal electronic degrees of freedom of both kinds of particles , the state dependent dynamics suitable for two - qubit gates requires engineering of the two particle interaction . to this end",
    "one can use external electromagnetic fields , e.g. magnetic feshbach resonances that allow for a precise tuning of the two - body effective scattering properties .",
    "the long - range atom - ion interaction also supports a trap - induced type of resonance @xcite , because of their generally state dependent nature , they will constitute a basic element of our quantum computation scheme .",
    "in this work we solely make use of these trap - induced shape resonances that occur at relatively large distances . in this way",
    "we avoid some possible unwanted processes that may result from molecular dynamics at short distances .",
    "we nevertheless plan to include magnetic feshbach resonances to our theory , which can be applied to perform two - qubit operations in a controlled collisions @xcite .",
    "a possible setup for quantum computation is schematically depicted in figure  [ fig : olatomandion ] .",
    "atoms are stored in an optical lattice in a mott insulator phase such that each lattice site is occupied by exactly one atom .",
    "one movable ion is used to create long - distance entanglement between pairs of atoms and to perform quantum gates .",
    "the basic ingredient of this idea is the controlled and qubit - sensitive interaction between atoms and ions . in this paper",
    "we focus on the dynamics of a single atom interacting with a single ion , nevertheless ; our approach can be easily extended to the situation of many atoms , or more than one ion , at a later stage .    ,",
    "width=264 ]    in this work we develop a theoretical model for spin - dependent atom - ion collisions . for the case of an alkaline - earth ion and an alkali atom",
    "we formulate a model based on the multichannel quantum defect theory ( mqdt ) @xcite taking into account the presence of trapping potentials @xcite . within our model the atom - ion interaction is described by the long - range @xmath5 polarization potential combined with a set of quantum - defect parameters representing the effect of the short - range potential .",
    "the essential parameters for our approach are the singlet and triplet scattering lengths , which are not yet known with sufficient accuracy , but can probably be measured in upcoming experiments . in our paper we discuss several different regimes for the values of the singlet and the triplet scattering length .",
    "for some specific range of scattering lengths we are able to reduce the complexity of the problem by employing an effective single - channel model for the atom - ion dynamics .",
    "using the effective single - channel description we are able to simulate a two - qubit phase gate for an arbitrary combination of atom and ion species .",
    "applicability of the model , however , requires values of singlet and triplet scattering lengths that are nearly equal . in this case , within the single - channel description and for a specific system of @xmath0ba@xmath1 ion and @xmath2rb atom , we develop a phase gate process yielding a fidelity of @xmath3 within the gate time of @xmath6 s. being equivalent to the cnot gate , the phase gate is universal for quantum computation @xcite",
    ". therefore we demonstrate the feasibility of quantum computation on the system under consideration . in a general situation ,",
    "when the scattering lengths are not similar , the phase gate can be even faster ; however this requires going beyond the single - channel effective description and is outside the scope of the present paper .",
    "there are two main mechanisms that could lead to a failure of the quantum gate .",
    "one is the radiative charge transfer , which in our scheme leads to a loss of both particles in case of heteronuclear species .",
    "in contrast , for a homonuclear collision @xcite the charge transfer results in a physically equivalent situation and therefore can not be considered as a loss mechanism .",
    "heteronuclear alkaline - earth ion  alkali atom systems have the advantage of a relatively simple electronic level structure , and for the systems studied so far ; na - ca@xmath1 @xcite and rb - ba@xmath1 @xcite , the charge exchange rate remains much smaller than the elastic collisional rate , even in the presence of resonances .",
    "the second loss process results from spin changing collisions . in our scheme",
    "the qubits are encoded in hyperfine spin states , and collisions leading to final states outside of the computational basis have to be avoided . in the regime of applicability of our single - channel",
    "effective model , the coupling between different channels is by definition very weak and those kinds of losses can be safely neglected . even in a general situation , anyway , a multichannel treatment including all possible spin - state channels offers the possibility to gain control over spin - changing processes by appropriate engineering of the gate dynamics .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec  [",
    "sec : setup ] we describe the basic setup and model used throughout the paper .",
    "further we briefly discuss the atom - ion polarization interaction and we introduce the concepts of correlation diagrams and trap induced resonances .",

    "we consider a system consisting of a single atom and a single ion , stored in their respective trapping potentials .",
    "such potentials can be created with rapidly oscillating ( rf ) electric fields for ions and with optical traps based on the ac stark effect for atoms .",
    "these traps can be well approximated as effective time - independent harmonic traps , as long as the particles are close to the ground state of the potential . for this setup",
    "we introduce an effective hamiltonian @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the mass of the ion ( atom ) , @xmath9 and @xmath10 denote frequency and location of the harmonic trapping potential of the ion ( atom ) and @xmath11 is the interaction potential . a microscopic derivation of the hamiltonian eq .",
    "can be found in @xcite . here , for simplicity",
    "we have assumed spherically symmetric trapping potentials and the same trapping frequencies for atom and ion : @xmath12 .",
    "we stress , however , that our approach can be easily generalized to anisotropic trapping potentials and different trapping frequencies @xcite",
    ". a general treatment would imply coupled center - of - mass ( cm ) and relative degrees of freedom , thus a six dimensional equation , but there are no fundamental difficulties . in experiments",
    "both traps can be designed to be spherically symmetric , while the assumption of the same trapping frequencies allows us to decouple the relative and cm motions , thereby reducing the dimensionality of the problem from six to three .",
    "this choice simplifies our numerical calculations , on the other hand it allows to capture the most important features of the system .",
    "we transform the hamiltonian eq .  , introducing cm and relative coordinates , @xmath13 and @xmath14 , respectively . without loosing generality",
    "we can choose the coordinate frame such that the vector of trap separation @xmath15 points in the @xmath16 direction .",
    "in this way we obtain the relative hamiltonian @xmath17 is the hamiltonian for the special case @xmath18 .      at large distances the atom - ion interaction potential",
    "has the asymptotic behavior @xmath19 ( @xmath20 ) .",
    "this results from the fact that the ion charge polarizes the electron cloud of the atom , and the induced dipole and the ion attract each other .",
    "therefore , the atom - ion interaction falls into an intermediate category , between the long - range coulomb forces @xmath21 and the van der waals forces @xmath22 for neutral atoms . the interaction constant @xmath23 can be expressed in terms of the electric dipole polarizability @xmath24 of the atom in the electronic ground state ( s - state ) : @xmath25 .",
    "the electron charge is denoted as @xmath26 . at short distances",
    "the interaction is dominated by the exchange forces , and higher order dispersion terms ( @xmath27 , @xmath28 ) also become relevant . in our approach",

    "this consists in substituting the actual potential by the reference potential @xmath38 at all distances ( see fig .  [",

    ".   one can evaluate eigenenergies in the multichannel case , while the eigenstates are given by eq .  , with @xmath125 determined from eq .",
    "this procedure yields a set of eigenfunctions @xmath126 and corresponding eigenenergies @xmath127 , where @xmath128 is a constant vector , and the label @xmath129 enumerates the solutions : @xmath130 similarly to ordinary scalar wave functions , the multichannel eigenstates corresponding to different non - degenerate eigenenergies are orthonormal : @xmath131      at nonzero trap separation , the hamiltonian is no longer rotationally invariant , and the procedure presented in the previous section based on decoupling of states with different values of @xmath45 does not apply .",
    "nevertheless , we can utilize the previous solutions at @xmath133 to diagonalize the full problem eq .   at @xmath134 . to this end the total wave function is decomposed in terms of arbitrary expansion coefficients @xmath135 : @xmath136 substituting this into eq .   and setting @xmath137 we arrive at the set of coupled equations @xmath138 which in principle can be solved numerically with standard methods for matrix diagonalization . here",
    "@xmath139 and @xmath140      in the regime of ultracold collisions , the variation of the total energy @xmath141 and the height of the angular momentum barrier ( for the lowest partial waves which are important in the ultracold regime @xcite ) are much smaller than the depth of the potential at @xmath142 where the matrix @xmath100 is defined",

    "we label those channels by @xmath150 .    at short distances ,",
    "the potential matrix becomes diagonal in the molecular basis characterized by the total electron and nuclear spins and their projections , because the short - range forces depend on the electronic configuration of the entire atom - ion molecular complex .",
    "in fact , the molecular potentials that correlate with atom and ion electronic ground states at large distances depend only on the total electron spin @xmath151 @xcite . for our choice of species",
    "the electronic configurations are identical as in collisions of two hydrogen atoms .",
    "thus , @xmath151 can take the values @xmath152 ( singlet configuration ) and @xmath153 ( triplet configuration ) .",
    "hence the quantum defect matrix @xmath144 , which contains the full interaction information , can be parameterized with only two constants , the singlet @xmath154 and triplet @xmath155 scattering lengths .",
    "these constants depend only on the species .",
    "in our approach we apply a frame transformation to find @xmath144 in the basis of hyperfine states @xcite . as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , this approximation is very accurate for atom - ion collisions due to a clear separation of length scales associated with the short - range and long - range forces . on the one hand ,",
    "exchange interaction becomes significant only at distances of the order of few tens of @xmath156 ( atomic units ) , when the electronic wavefunctions of atom and ion begin to overlap . on the other hand ,",
    "the polarization forces are very long - ranged and they are modified by the presences of the centrifugal barrier only at large distances of the order of @xmath58 .      the off - diagonal matrix elements in the quantum defect matrix @xmath144 are proportional to the `` coupling '' scattering length , that is defined as @xmath158 @xcite .",
    "therefore in the case of @xmath157 the coupling between channels is weak and the many channel description can be effectively reduced to a single - channel model . to this end",
    "we solve the multi - channel problem at @xmath40 , and we find the corresponding eigenenergies @xmath159 and eigenstates @xmath160 from eq .   and eq .  .",
    "if the mixing between channels is weak , in each of the eigenfunction @xmath160 , there is only one channel that dominates , i.e. the vector @xmath128 has only one element which is close to unity .",
    "we divide the total multichannel spectrum into @xmath75 distinct subsets according to the channel that gives the leading contribution to @xmath160 , and for each of the subset we determine the effective short - range phase @xmath161 ( or the scattering length @xmath162 ) .",
    "this is done by matching the multichannel spectrum @xmath159 in each of the subsets with the single - channel generated by eq .   with the quantum - defect parameter @xmath161 .",
    "in the limit of zero coupling between channels , the effective scattering length @xmath163 is equal to @xmath164 . in the presence of weak coupling , @xmath163 is in general different from @xmath154 and @xmath155 , since the asymptotic channels typically correlate both to singlet and triplet molecular states at small distances .",
    "this procedure yields a set of @xmath75 short range phases @xmath165 , which are used at a later stage in the single - channel calculations .",
    "we note that the effective phases @xmath165 depend on the relative angular momentum , and in principle they weakly depend on the energy .",
    "we have verified , however , that within the considered range of energies limited to the bound states close to the dissociation threshold , and to a few tens of the lowest vibrational states , the variations of @xmath166 with the energy are negligible . for collisions",
    "when only a single open channel exists , the remaining closed channels are typically only weakly coupled to the open channel ( apart from the case of resonances ) , and the resulting multichannel wave function is dominated by the open - channel component . the situation changes , however , when there are more open channels , and the channel mixing can be significant .",
    "we have investigated this issue numerically , picking the specific ion and atom pair @xmath0ba@xmath1@xmath2rb and the trapping frequency @xmath167khz .",
    "we have considered collisions within the @xmath168 subspace , assuming that initially the particles are prepared in the channel @xmath169 .",
    "this choice is relevant for our modeling of the quantum gate , as we show later . for the collision energies above the dissociation threshold of the channel @xmath170 , a second open channel exists , with @xmath171 . in this case",
    "we find that admixture of the two remaining closed channels is negligible , whereas the contribution of both channels @xmath170 and @xmath172 in the multichannel eigenstates is typically large , and the contributions from @xmath170 and @xmath172 can not be separated .",
    "the only exception is the case of similar @xmath154 and @xmath155 , where the inter - channel coupling @xmath173 is small , and the multichannel eigenstates are dominated by the single - channel contributions .",
    "we estimate the validity of the single channel approximation by calculating the overlap of the exact multichannel and the single channel wave functions , in the range of trap separations @xmath60 , interesting for our dynamics .",
    "the minimum over @xmath60 yields some overall fidelity related to the reduction to the single channel model . for similar singlet and triplet phases , we have @xmath174 , and the multichannel wave functions differ from their single - channel counterparts by the presence of negligible contributions in the channels others than the dominating one .",
    "the relative contributions of individual channels are given by the vectors @xmath128 that are obtained in the calculation of eigenstates at @xmath40 .",
    "when @xmath175 one has to take into account that the multichannel wave functions are linear combinations of the solutions at @xmath40 ( see eq .  ) , and the overlap between single- and multi - channel eigenstates is a linear combination of the overlaps calculated at @xmath40 with the expansion coefficients given by @xmath176 .",
    "resonances occurring at @xmath40 can lead to significant channel mixing for few states , although the average fidelity is very high .",
    "the more these highly mixed states contribute to the wavefunctions , the larger is the error of the model . for the error estimation used in this work , we only use the trap ground state at maximal @xmath60 and a molecular state at minimal @xmath60 of interest .",
    "we find that the two fidelities lie in the same range , thus we take the minimum of them and assume the result as a lower bound for the fidelity at intermediate distances .",
    "we have additionally verified that reductions to the single channel model works best for positive values of singlet and triplet scattering lengths around @xmath177 .",
    "traps for individual ultracold atomic particles used in schemes for quantum information processing provide in most cases for the ability to manipulate the particles motion via appropriate tuning of external trap parameters .",
    "this is in particular the case for optical lattices and paul traps , where field polarizations and intensities can be changed to control the shape and position of the traps to a high degree of accuracy .",
    "our proposal relies on these standard techniques , thereby introducing the innovative aspect of combining traps for ions and atoms . as already discussed elsewhere @xcite , the physical mechanisms generating the traps for ions and atoms are different and lead , under appropriate conditions , to independent microscopic traps , which can be modeled as follows .    in this",

    "start to depend on the spin state as well as on @xmath60 itself , and positions of trap - induced resonances are determined by the internal state of both particles . in this way trap displacement",
