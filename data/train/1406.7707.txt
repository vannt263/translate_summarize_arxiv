    "superconducting josephson junction devices and circuits are proving to be promising systems for quantum information processing @xcite . due to the great controllability of the qubits and microwaves in the superconducting circuit systems , single - qubit @xcite ,",
    "two - qubit @xcite , and three - qubit @xcite operations have been experimentally demonstrated .",
    "the next natural step is to develop robust , high - fidelity and scalable gates for larger scale quantum computation .",
    "an essential prerequisite for quantum information processing and quantum computation is precise coherent control of quantum systems or quantum bits ( qubits ) . here , we focus our discussion on high - fidelity quantum control for superconducting flux qubit systems .",
    "the flux qubits have an advantage over other types of superconducting qubits in the larger anharmonic energy level structure , i.e. the difference between adjacent transition frequencies is larger @xcite and thus less leakage to higher energy - level states . several schemes to implement local qubit operations and controllable couplings using microwaves for multi - flux - qubit systems have been proposed or / and realized .",
    "these schemes may be categorized into two groups : ( i ) directly coupling between qubits @xcite and ( ii ) indirectly coupling through an intermediate coupler @xcite .",
    "for example , a scheme to control the effective qubit - qubit interaction for directly couping flux qubits with fixed qubit transition frequencies and large detuning between the neighboring qubits using time - dependent magnetic fluxes ( or microwaves ) was proposed in ref .  .",
    "while this approach is advantageous due to the resonant nature of the coupling , its disadvantage is that at least one of the qubits must be biased away from the coherence optimal point @xcite ; this makes the qubit susceptible to low - frequency flux noise and results in a shorter coherence time . for the case of indirect coupling through an intermediate coupler , the coupling subcircuit or coupling nonlinear element can also be driven with microwaves @xcite .",
    "these indirectly coupling schemes have the advantage of enabling the qubits to be operated at their optimal coherence points @xcite .",
    "however , in addition to the added circuit complexity , the effective couplings between two qubits in the indirectly coupling schemes are generally smaller so the two - qubit gating time is about @xmath4 ns , at least one or two order(s ) of magnitude longer than that of directly coupling schemes .",
    "schemes for microwave controllable coupling , which allow qubits to be operated at optimal bias points and without intermediate coupler subcircuit , exist @xcite .",
    "but the effective qubit - qubit couplings in these schemes are usually even smaller than those of the indirectly coupling schemes .",
    "smaller two - qubit coupling or equivalently longer two - qubit gating time will usually make the qubits suffer more decoherence effect during the gate operation , thus deteriorating the gate fidelity .",
    "the fidelities of single - qubit and two - qubit quantum gate operations in a multi - qubit register for the present directly / indirectly coupling schemes via microwaves in the unitary case ( without considering decoherence effect ) even under the two - level qubit approximation are not perfect @xcite .",
    "the microwave pulses for single - qubit gate operations are generally obtained and applied under the approximation that the qubit with large detuning with its neighboring qubits is effectively decoupled with its neighbors even though there exist fixed two - qubit couplings between them . but",
    "this decoupling is only valid in the first order of a small parameter that is the ratio of the two - qubit coupling to the detuning . for two - qubit operations ,",
    "the microwave pulses are commonly constructed and performed under the rotating wave approximation , the adiabatic approximation for the nonlinear coupler , or / and the approximation of neglecting other small residual two - qubit interactions .",
    "the qubit - decoupled approximation becomes excellent when the effective qubit - qubit coupling is very small ; however , a large qubit - qubit interaction is favorable for two - qubit operations .",
    "therefore , reaching a delicate balance between these two situations results in , for instance , single - qubit gate errors greater than @xmath5 for practical experimental parameters even in the ideal , unitary case of simple two - level approximation for each flux qubit .",
    "quantum optimal control theory is a powerful tool that provides a variational framework for finding optimal control field profiles or sequences by maximizing a desired physical objective ( or minimizing a physical cost function ) within certain constraints @xcite . in this paper , we apply the quantum optimal control theory to find the control pulse sequences of externally applied ac magnetic fluxes ( fields ) to implement fast and high - fidelity one - qubit and two - qubit gates on superconducting flux qubits .",
    "there have been optimal control studies of quantum gates for superconducting qubits , but all focusing on the gate operations of cooper - pair - box charge qubit systems @xcite .",
    "our investigation here is , to our knowledge , the first optimal control study for the flux qubit systems .",
    "the flux qubits we consider have fixed direct qubit - qubit couplings and fixed transition frequencies but with large detuning between neighboring qubits , which ensures the qubits are effectively decoupled ( to the first order ) in the absence of time - dependent control fields or signals .",
    "our optimal control scheme requires no additional bias or control lines beyond those used for the manipulation of individual qubits . in the absence of the time - dependent magnetic fluxes ,",
    "the flux qubits in our scheme are biased at the coherence optimal points @xcite to reduce dephasing due to flux noise , i.e.,to have a longer coherence time .",
    "furthermore , our optimal control scheme takes into account two - qubit interaction , qubit detuning and other time - dependent magnetic field induced residual single - qubit and two - qubit interactions when performing single - qubit and two - qubit gates .",
    "thus the gate fidelities ( errors ) in the unitary ( closed - system ) case can be as high ( low ) as one wishes , limited only by the accuracy of the approximated two - level qubit hamiltonian used and by the machine precision of the computation . besides , the two - qubit cnot gate operations of our scheme is about several folds to two orders of magnitude faster than the directly or / and indirectly microwave controllable coupling schemes @xcite . by considering leakage to higher - energy - level states , the gate errors for single - qubit gates using the optimal control pulse sequences obtained are in the order of @xmath6 and are in the order of @xmath7 for two - qubit cnot gates",
    "to take the effect of qubit decoherence into account , we model the qubit dynamics by a quantum master equation with experimentally available relaxation and dephasing rates .",
    "the gate errors in the presence of decoheence by considering the master equation are still in the order of @xmath7 for single - qubit gates and in the order of @xmath8 for two - qubit cnot gates .",
    "these gate errors are still below the error threshold @xmath9 ( @xmath5 in @xcite ; @xmath10 if surface code error correction is used @xcite ) required for fault - tolerant quantum computation .",

( 3 ) our scheme can cope with noise and decoherence very well as the qubits are biased at the optimal coherence point to reduce the influence of low - frequency flux noise , and the gate operation time ( @xmath3 ns ) is much shorter than the corresponding qubit decoherence time ( a few @xmath233s or larger ) @xcite so that the decoherence effect on such a fast gate is significantly diminished .",

    "the pulse sequences shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : x1 ] and , and in fig .",
    "[ fig : cnot ] and look experimentally challenging , but not impossible .",
    "commercial devices ( e.g. , tektronix awg70001a ) for generating arbitrary wave forms with 10 bits of vertical resolution at a sample rate of 50 gsa / s , a bit rate of 12.5 gb / s and a rise / fall time smaller than 27 ps are now available .",
    "such a device should enable generation of complex signals in a time scale of sub - nanoseconds to nanoseconds .",
    "this high - end arbitrary wave form generator combining with ultrafast josephson electronics should be or about to be able to fulfill the necessary specifications for implementing the optimal control pulse sequences we obtain for the quantum gate operations presented here .",
    "another challenge for the experimental implementations and applications of the quantum optimal control theory is one s imprecise knowledge of the quantum system s parameters .",
    "typically , the quantum gates constructed by the quantum optimal control theory are computed to very high precision assuming the parameters in the model hamiltonian are exactly known . however , for real systems controlled in the experiments , the parameters and also the hamiltonians usually are not known exactly .",
    "this poses a challenge to implement such high - fidelity gates successfully in the laboratory .",
    "recently , a hybrid open / closed - loop optimal control method called adaptation by hybrid optimal control ( ad - hoc ) has been proposed @xcite to overcome not only the problem of inaccurate knowledge of the system parameters but also shortcomings of the assumed physical model and errors on the controls themselves .",
    "the basic idea is to use the open - loop quantum optimal control theory to find the optimal control pulses with the best available model and parameters of the system .",
    "then the pulses are sent to the experiment and their performance are efficiently measured by using , for example , the method of randomized benchmarking @xcite .",
    "the closed - loop pulse calibration of ad - hoc , similar to adaptive model - free feedback control ( also referred to as closed - loop laboratory control or learning control ) @xcite , uses the physical system itself as a feedback to calibrate control pulses and optimize their performance . by using , e.g. , the robust and efficient nelder - mead algorithm @xcite ,",
    "the control pulses are updated experimentally and the procedure is iterated until a target performance is reached or convergence stops . after the calibration is finished , the optimized pulses can then be used . even though the precise experimental parameters are never identified , ad - hoc can reduce the initial gate errors of the numerically obtained optimal control pulses implemented in an experiment by at least an order of magnitude @xcite .",
    "thus the quantum optimal control theory is practical and applicable experimentally through , e.g. , the ad - hoc protocol @xcite . a recent experiment demonstrating single - qubit operations ( with fidelity of 0.99 ) and two - qubit entanglement for the electron spins of two proximal nitrogen - vacancy centers in diamond using optimal control has been reported @xcite .",
    "it is thus believed that high - fidelity quantum gates with optimal control pulses obtained via our scheme will be realized experimentally in the near future .",

    "<S> we apply the quantum optimal control theory based on the krotov method to implement single - qubit @xmath0 and @xmath1 gates and two - qubit cnot gates for inductively coupled superconducting flux qubits with fixed qubit transition frequencies and fixed off - diagonal qubit - qubit coupling . our scheme that shares the same advantage of other directly coupling schemes requires no additional coupler subcircuit and control lines . </S>",
    "<S> the control lines needed are only for the manipulation of individual qubits ( e.g. , a time - dependent magnetic flux or field applied on each qubit ) . </S>",
    "<S> the qubits are operated at the optimal coherence points and the gate operation times ( single - qubit gates @xmath2 ns ; cnot gates @xmath3 ns ) are much shorter than the corresponding qubit decoherence time . a cnot gate or other general quantum gates </S>",
    "<S> can be implemented in a single run of pulse sequence rather than being decomposed into several single - qubit and some entangled two - qubit operations in series by composite pulse sequences . </S>",
    "<S> quantum gates constructed via our scheme are all with very high fidelity ( very low error ) as our optimal control scheme takes into account the fixed qubit detuning and fixed two - qubit interaction as well as all other time - dependent magnetic - field - induced single - qubit interactions and two - qubit couplings . </S>",
    "<S> the effect of leakage to higher energy - level states and the effect of qubit decoherence on the quantum gate operations are also discussed . </S>"
