    "the theory of phase transitions  @xcite generally applies to homogenous systems . however , homogeneity is often an ideal limit of experimental conditions .",
    "inhomogenous conditions may significantly affect the experimental data at phase transitions , requiring an understanding of their effects for a correct interpretation .",
    "in particular , they generally smooth out the singularities of the thermodynamic quantities at phase transitions .",
    "notable examples are temperature gradient effects in general setups ( see e.g. @xcite ) , the gravity effects in experimental studies of fluids  @xcite ( in particular at the superfluid transition in @xmath3he systems  @xcite ) and in the phenomenology of dense astrophysical objects @xcite , the external confining forces in cold atom experiments  @xcite , and the intrinsic space - time inhomogeneity of the quark - gluon plasma formation in heavy - ion collisions  @xcite .",
    "however , inhomogeneity effects should not only be considered as a drawback of the experimental setup , but they may also give rise to interesting peculiar phenomena at phase transitions .    in the presence of smooth inhomogeneities , we may simultaneously observe different phases at different space regions ; for example experiments of cold atoms in optical lattices show the simultaneous presence of mott incompressible and superfluid phases in different regions of the inhomogenous harmonic trap  @xcite . in noncritical regimes , away from phase transitions",
    "when correlations do not develop long length scales , inhomogeneity effects may be effectively taken into account by local - equilibrium approximations ( lea ) , assuming a local equilibrium analogous to that of the homogenous system at the same thermodynamic parameters .",
    "an example is the local - density approximation widely used to study particle systems with an effective space - dependent chemical potential  @xcite . at continuous ( classical or quantum ) transitions , where correlations develop large length scales",
    ", lea can not provide a satisfactory description : critical modes get significantly distorted by the inhomogeneities , which give generally rise to a further length scale @xmath4 .",
    "however , for sufficiently smooth inhomogeneities we may still observe a peculiar universal scaling with respect to their length scale @xmath4 , controlled by the universality class of the transition of the homogenous system  @xcite .",
    "in this paper we study the effects of smooth inhomogeneities at first - order transitions , for which little is known .",
    "first - order transitions do not develop diverging length scales in the thermodynamic limit , thus one may naively expect trivial behaviors under smooth inhomogenous conditions , describable by lea .",

    "<S> , we note that the scaling behaviors induced by a smooth inhomogeneity appear quite similar in first - order and continuous transitions . </S>"
