    "it is currently known that at ( asymptotic ) higher energies , @xmath4 , the parton density inside hadrons increase and the scattering amplitude approaches to the unitarity limit .",
    "therefore , a linear perturbative qcd description breaks down and one enters the saturation regime , where the dynamics is described by a nonlinear evolution equation and the parton densities saturate @xcite .",
    "the transition border between the linear and nonlinear regimes is characterized by a typical momentum scale @xmath5 , the so - called saturation scale .",
    "the low momentum region is driven by this quantity and these effects might become important in the energy regime probed by current colliders .",
    "an interesting process where this approach has been successfully tested is the two virtual photon scattering @xcite .",
    "the formalism considered is based on the dipole picture @xcite , with the @xmath6 total cross sections being described by the interaction of two color dipoles , in which the virtual photons fluctuate into .",
    "the dipole - dipole cross section is modeled considering the interpolation between the color transparency domain and the saturation physics .",
    "this approach provides a very good description of the data on the @xmath7 total cross section for virtual and/or real photons and on the photon structure function at low @xmath8 .    recently , related studies in the exclusive meson production process @xmath9 have appeared @xcite , where @xmath10 denotes the vector meson . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the bfkl amplitude at next to leading order ( nla ) level for the exclusive diffractive two rho production is computed . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the amplitude for the forward electroproduction of two light vector mesons in nla is computed .",
    "a complete program for computation of double diffractive rho production in @xmath11 collisions has been put forward in ref .",
    "a shortcoming of those approaches is that they consider only the linear regime of the qcd dynamics and nonlinear effects associated to the saturation physics are disregarded . on the other hand , these processes offer good opportunity for studying the transition between the linear and saturation regimes .",
    "namely , the virtualities of both photons in the initial state can vary as well as the vector mesons in the final state . in the interaction of two",
    "highly virtual photons and/or double heavy vector meson production we expect the dominance of hard physics ( linear regime ) . on the contrary , for double light meson production on real photons scattering the soft physics",
    "is expected to be important .",
    "consequently , for exclusive processes where we have low momenta scales entering the game we may expect that the main contribution comes from semi - hard physics , described by saturation effects .    in this letter we study the application of the phenomenological saturation model for two photon scattering to the exclusive hard reactions such as the amplitude for deeply virtual compton scattering ( dvcs ) on a photon target , @xmath12 and vector meson production , @xmath13 ( @xmath14 ) .",
    "the real photon in the final state turns its qcd computation somewhat problematic and saturation model provides a suitable scheme for dealing with low momenta scales appearing in the problem .",

    "those investigations have shown that the amplitude can be factorized in a convolution of hard processes with the corresponding anomalous generalized parton distributions in the photon , which obey dglap - erbl evolution equations with an inhomogeneous term .",

    "here , @xmath31 stand for quarks of different flavors @xmath32 .",
    "the expressions for the photon wavefunctions are well known @xcite .",
    "the dipole - dipole cross section is represented by the quantity @xmath33 , which depends on dipole sizes and on energy through @xmath19 .    for the case double vector meson production in the color dipole picture , one consider the scattering process @xmath34 , where @xmath35 stands for both light and0or heavy mesons .",
    "the scattering process can be also seen as a succession on time of three factorizable subprocesses , where now in the step ( iii ) the pairs convert into the vector mesons . in order to obtain the total cross section , we assume an exponential parameterization for the small @xmath36 behavior of the amplitude .",
    "after integration over @xmath36 , the total cross section for double vector meson production by photons is written as , @xmath37 ^ 2}{16\\pi\\,b_{v_1 \\,v_2}}\\,(1+\\beta^{2 } ) , \\label{totalcs}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath38 is the ratio of real to imaginary part of the amplitude and @xmath39 is the slope parameter .",

    "it is well known that that the incorporation of asymptotic freedom into the bfkl equation makes the qcd pomeron a series of isolated poles in the angular momentum plane .",
    "the contribution of the each pole to scattering amplitudes satisfies the standard regge - factorization , which in the color dipole ( cd ) basis implies the cd bfkl - regge expansion for the vacuum exchange dipole - dipole cross section @xmath115 here the dipole cross section @xmath116 is an eigen - function of the cd bfkl equation @xmath117 with eigen value ( intercept ) @xmath118 . for the details on cd formulation of the bfkl equation , infrared regularization by finite propagation radius @xmath119 for perturbative gluons and freezing of strong coupling at large distances , the choice of the physically motivated boundary condition for the hard bfkl evolution and description of eigenfunctions we quote ref . @xcite and references therein .",

    "the node of @xmath127 is located at @xmath128 , for larger @xmath122 the rightmost nodes move to a somewhat larger @xmath129 and accumulate at @xmath130 . because the bfkl equation sums cross sections of production of multigluon final states , the perturbative two - gluon born approximation is a natural boundary condition .",
    "this leaves the starting point @xmath131 as the only free parameter which fixes completely the result of the hard bfkl evolution for dipole - dipole cross section , with the choice @xmath132 . because in the attainable region of @xmath129 the sub - leading solutions @xmath133 can not be resolved and they all have similar intercepts @xmath134 , in practical implementations the expansion ( [ eq:2.3 ] ) can be truncated at @xmath135 lumping in the term with @xmath135 contributions of all singularities with @xmath133 , with with the effective intercept @xmath136 .",
    "whereas scattering of small dipoles @xmath137 is dominated by the exchange of perturbative gluons , interaction of large dipoles with the proton target has been modeled by the non - perturbative soft pomeron with intercept @xmath138 .",
    "thus , an extra term @xmath139 is added in the r.h.s . of expansion ( [ eq:2.3 ] ) .        in fig .",

    "the energy dependence is clearly different at high energies .",
    "for sufficiently low energies the results are consistent .",
    "the tkm model gives a softer energy dependence in contrast with cd bfkl .",
    "this can be understood since at high energies the saturation scale is increasingly larger .",
    "the direct consequence of a larger saturation scale is the reduction of the effective energy exponent , @xmath63 .",
    "similar behavior is also observed in vector meson production .",
    "therefore , the high energy limit is a good place to investigate the production dynamics .",
    "we estimate the differential cross section for the high energy deeply virtual compton scattering on a photon target and also the related exclusive vector meson production processes .",
    "the qcd color dipole scattering formalism is considered for phenomenology because it allow to deal with soft momenta scales in problem .",
    "the absolute values for cross section are still small , but the exclusive meson production should be feasible .",
    "the main theoretical / experimental uncertainties are the slope parameter value and the choice for the meson wavefunction .",
