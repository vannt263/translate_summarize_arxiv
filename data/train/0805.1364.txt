    "streamer discharges determine the early stages of sparks and lightning ; they occur in various ionizable media in a large range of pressures and temperatures . in corona applications ,",
    "they are widely used for surface charging in copiers and printers , for the removal of dust in electric precipitators and for ozone production and gas and water cleaning  @xcite .",
    "streamers underlie the operation of spark plugs in internal combustion engines , and there are new initiatives to improve the control of ignition  @xcite .",
    "another new application is flow control in aviation  @xcite .",
    "streamers also play a role in the ignition of energy efficient high pressure metal halid lamps  @xcite . obviously , pressure , temperature and gas composition vary from one phenomenon to the next . in electrical engineering , the higher densities of liquids are desirable for fast switching , but pre - existing microbubbles largely influence streamer properties in fluids  @xcite . for this reason ,",
    "the operation of spark gaps filled with supercritical fluids is now under investigation  @xcite .",
    "we also recall experimental work on streamers in fluid nitrogen and argon  @xcite .",
    "streamer - like phenomena also occur in fast semiconductor switches  @xcite . while in all these cases , the density of neutral particles is of the order of or considerably larger than in air at standard temperature and pressure , much lower densities are of interest in geophysics . at altitudes of 40 - 90 km in the atmosphere ,",
    "enormous sprite discharges  @xcite were found to evolve above thunderclouds .",
    "they are thought to be related to streamer discharges through similarity laws  @xcite as elaborated in the next section",
    ".      bar . number and diameters of streamers are similar in the lower panels at some distance from the needle electrode .",
    "the pictures show the complete streamer evolution , hence the streamers in panel ( a ) do not reach the plate electrode .",
    "note also , that in the extreme zoom of panel ( d ) , the pixel structure of the camera becomes visible and diameter evaluations become inaccurate .",
    "the diameters reported in this paper are evaluated from pictures where the camera is moved physically so close to the discharge that such artifacts are avoided  @xcite.,width=604 ]    similarity laws between streamer discharges at different densities @xmath6 of the neutral gas or other medium follow from the fact that the basic length scale of the streamer discharge is the mean free path @xmath7 of the electron which is inversely proportional to the density of the medium : @xmath8 .",
    "an electron is accelerated over this length by the local electric field * e * before the next collision with a neutral particle ; on this length it gains the energy @xmath9 where e is the elementary charge ; this energy has to be compared to the ionization energy of the neutral particle on which the electron impacts .",
    "similarity for varying density @xmath6 therefore implies that the reduced electric field @xmath10 is the same at similar places , that the streamer velocity @xmath11 as well as velocity and energy distributions of individual electrons are the same at similar places , that all reduced lengths , i.e. , the ratio of lengths @xmath12 over the mean free electron paths @xmath13 are the same , and that the same electric potential is applied over the same reduced lengths  these similarities have motivated the introduction of the unit townsend for the ratio @xmath10 of electric field over density , and we therefore will denote these similarity laws as townsend scaling .",
    "the similarity can be tested on the experimental results as demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ drukzoom ] , for a detailed description of these experiments , we refer to later chapters .",
    "a minimal model  @xcite for negative streamers with drift and diffusion of electrons , local impact ionization and space charge effects obeys these similarity laws perfectly .",
    "the same is true when the model is extended by nonlocal photo - ionization in the low density limit ; this photo - ionization is commonly thought to explain the propagation of positive streamers in air  @xcite .",
    "corrections to the similarity laws come from three different sources .",
    "+ @xmath14 the similarity laws are based on the fast two - particle processes between a charged particle and one of the abundant neutral particles that dominate the dynamics in the streamer ionization front . at higher densities , three - body processes inside the gas volume",
    "can become important .",
    "important examples include collisional quenching of the excited states that otherwise lead to photo - ionization in nitrogen - oxygen mixtures like air , as well as electron attachment to oxygen or electron ion recombination  @xcite ; in all these cases the conservation of both momentum and energy requires the presence of a third particle , and the similarity laws break down on spatial or temporal scales where these processes become important .",
    "+ @xmath15 corrections also come from the presence of electrodes or other matter ( like dust particles or gas bubbles ) whose lengths do not change when the gas density changes  @xcite .",
    "+ @xmath16 finally , the total number of charged particles in similar streamers varies like @xmath17  @xcite , therefore similar streamers at higher densities @xmath6 contain a lower total number of charged particles , and discrete particle fluctuations are more pronounced .",
    "+ due to @xmath14 and @xmath15 , similarity laws for positive streamers in air are expected to hold only well below 30 torr , i.e. , 40 mbar ( 1 bar equals @xmath4  pa ) , where collisional quenching of photo - ionizing nitrogen states is negligible  @xcite , in the streamer head when it is far enough from the electrodes , and at time scales when the loss of streamer conductivity due to electron attachment is still negligible .",
    "we remark that the predicted propagation of positive streamers in absolutely pure nitrogen depends on the model input about photo - ionization in this gas , but the purity of our nitrogen is only 99.9% , therefore the common photo - ionization model for nitrogen - oxygen mixtures is still likely to apply .",
    "the basic physical similarity variable is the density @xmath6 of neutral particles , therefore reduced fields and lengths should be defined as @xmath10 and @xmath18 .",
    "the density @xmath6 is related to the pressure @xmath0 approximately as @xmath19 according to the ideal gas law , where @xmath20 is the boltzmann constant and @xmath21 is temperature . as our experiments are all performed at room temperature and as we measure pressure directly , we discuss the pressure dependence of our laboratory experiments rather than their density dependence and use @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "we extrapolate sprite measurements to room temperature using the ideal gas law .",
    "experimental investigations of the density dependence of streamers are rare .",

    "@xcite have varied the pressure in the range of 0.5 to 1 bar in a 2 cm point - plane gap in synthetic air at a fixed voltage of 24 kv ; they find that the streamer diameter increases from 0.4 mm to 2.6 mm with decreasing pressure .",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite have presented yet unpublished results in the pressure range of 0.01 to 0.06 bar at a recent workshop  @xcite .",
    "streamers in air in a dc corona at pressures of 1 - 10 bar were observed by marode _",
    "et al . _",
    "they conclude that the general discharge structures and , in particular , the streamer velocities , are similar when pressure changes .    in sprite discharges , channels have been imaged with a telescope  @xcite .",
    "channels of varying diameter at fixed height are reported , e.g. , 60 to 145 m ( @xmath24 12 m ) in the altitude range of 60 - 64 km ( @xmath24 4.5 km ) and 20 - 50 m ( @xmath24 13 m ) in the altitude range of 76 - 80 km ( @xmath24 5 km )  @xcite .",
    "the variation of sprite diameters resembles the variation of streamer diameters at 1 bar  @xcite .",
    "the sprites extend downward with velocities that vary by more than two orders of magnitude , ranging from 0.1 mm / ns (= @xmath4 m / s ) to more than 3@xmath25 m / s @xcite or even @xmath26 m / s  @xcite .",
    "other experimental work is concerned with the influence of voltage and gas composition at standard temperature and pressure on positive streamers . in previous and forth coming work  @xcite",
    ", we have shown that diameter and velocity of positive streamers in air at standard temperature and pressure in point - plane gaps of 4 and 8 cm can vary by more than an order of magnitude as a function of voltage , i.e. , from 0.2 to 3 mm and from 0.1 to 4 mm / ns for voltages between 5 and 96 kv ; furthermore , the diameters and velocities depend not only on the maximal voltage , but also on voltage rise time and possible current limitations  @xcite",
    ". a range of diameters is also presented by ono _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite where streamer diameters increase from 0.4 mm to 1.2 mm in a 1.3 cm point - plane gap in synthetic air at 1 bar when the voltage increases from 13 kv to 27 kv .",
    "the average streamer velocity is 0.5 mm / ns at 18 kv . in nitrogen",
    "they find the diameter to increase from 0.2 mm to 0.4 mm and the velocity to increase from 0.2 mm / ns to 0.5 mm / ns when the voltage increases from 16 kv to 27 kv and from 18 kv to 27 kv , respectively .",
    "streamers in a protrusion - plane gap of 13 cm at 1 bar for a range of nitrogen - oxygen ratios and in the voltage range of 83 to 123 kv are described by yi and williams  @xcite .",
    "they observe an increase in propagation velocity from about 0.3 mm / ns to 4 mm / ns for increasing oxygen concentration ( up to 10% ) and increasing applied voltage .",
    "obviously , there is a need to classify these phenomena . within the present paper",
    ", we will investigate experimentally whether there are similarity laws between positive ( cathode directed ) streamers in the same gas type at different densities .",
    "we will explore the density regime corresponding to pressures of 0.013 to 1 bar at room temperature and we will discuss whether our results over nearly two decades of density extrapolate to sprite discharges at much lower densities . if streamers at different densities are similar , then the huge sprite discharges at very low pressures can be investigated in small laboratory experiments at much higher pressure , and the fast temporal evolution of streamers in turn can be conveniently observed in slow motion and under the magnifying glass at lower pressures ; for the extreme case of sprites this has been recently demonstrated in  @xcite .",
    "most of our measurements have been performed in ambient air as it is most common in applications and in nature . however , air is a compound gas with 78% n@xmath27 , 20% o@xmath27 , 1% h@xmath27o , 0.03% co@xmath27 and 1% noble gases ; processes like photo - ionization between nitrogen and oxygen and electron attachment to oxygen have to be taken into account . for this reason",
    "also experiments in nitrogen as a simple gas are performed and presented ; however , we here only present results at a nitrogen purity of about 99.9  % , where impurities still seem to play a role .",
    "this paper concentrates on measurements of streamer diameters , and also reports the size of the initial ionization cloud at inception and the velocities , and it presents first results on branching lengths .",
    "branching angles were recently measured in  @xcite . as shown in  @xcite and discussed in more detail in  @xcite",
    ", there is a critical inception voltage required for streamer formation ; at the inception voltage , streamers at a given pressure always appear to attain the same minimal diameter .",
    "when a higher voltage is applied within a sufficiently short rise time , considerably thicker and faster streamers are formed  @xcite . however , when the voltage is increased sufficiently slowly , streamers emerge as soon as the inception voltage is reached , and they ( obviously ) have minimal diameter . in the present paper , we have chosen to test the similarity laws on these thinnest streamers for several reasons .",
    "first , it appears that there is a lower limit for the streamer diameter but an upper limit is not established @xcite .",
    "therefore , the minimal diameters at each pressure are appropriate quantities to compare .",
    "second , the thinnest streamers are furthest away from the electrodes that might break the similarity laws locally as discussed in section  [ townsend ] .",
    "third , the minimal streamers do not evolve into glow and/or spark as easily as the thick ones , and therefore they can be imaged more easily .",

    "the method is based on the observation that for exposure times as short as 1 ns , the actively growing streamer head in air and nitrogen is visible as a glowing ball  @xcite , this feature recently also has been demonstrated for sprites  @xcite . extended lines therefore indicate the trace of the propagating streamer head within a longer exposure time .",
    "delay @xmath21 and exposure time @xmath36 of the photographs are chosen in such a way that velocities conveniently can be determined , see below .",
    "we evaluate the velocities here only in the 16 cm gap and at three different locations ; near the anode tip , halfway the gap and near the cathode plate .",
    "the velocities are determined from the longest streamers in each picture since they propagate most parallel to the camera s focal plane .",
    "( this constraint could be dropped in future measurements when using stereographic imaging  @xcite . )",
    "note that the velocities are related to the diameters  @xcite .",
    "however , the diameters can not be accurately determined from the full photographs of the 16 cm gap as the camera resolution is insufficient , cf .  the extensive discussion of imaging artifacts in  @xcite that is briefly recalled in section  [ chn2airdiam ] .",
    "typical exposure times @xmath36 for the velocity measurements are 50 to 500 ns .",
    "these values are chosen in such a way that the propagation distance is short enough to contain little or no branching , but also long enough to limit relative errors in d@xmath42 and @xmath36 due to the extension of the streamer head , due to the emission time of the excited c - state of nitrogen ( @xmath432 ns ) that emits the light , and due to inaccuracies of the camera s gate time @xmath36 .",

    "therefore the number of time resolved photographs per parameter set is limited to only a few .",
    "furthermore , at low voltages , one must be sure that the streamer on the image finishes because the camera closes , and not because the streamer stops anyway .",
    "in air this constraint is particularly severe , as the maximal streamer length is typically shorter than in nitrogen , as is shown in figure  [ n2airvergelijk ] .",
    "for all these reasons , it is uncertain whether the velocity of streamers of minimal diameter is contained in our measured data set . in air at 1 bar",
    "the minimal velocity is of the order of 0.1 mm / ns = @xmath4 m / s ; far from the needle electrode it even decreases to @xmath45  m / s .",

    "the cloud size at the inception voltage approximately obeys a similarity law ; the reduced cloud height is approximately @xmath76 . in our n@xmath27 ,",
    "the cloud is less pronounced .",
    "elsewhere we have measured the distribution of branching angles  @xcite .",
    "here we have introduced and measured the branching ratio @xmath51 to characterize the shape of the streamer tree ; here @xmath49 is the distance between branching events and @xmath50 the streamer diameter just before branching . in air",
    ", this ratio is @xmath77 for streamers of minimal diameter for all pressures in the range from 0.065 to 1 bar . therefore the overall branching pattern is quite independent of pressure , even though the stochastic fluctuations are larger at higher pressures as discussed in section  [ townsend ] . if random ionization avalanches would play a major role in the branching process ( cf .",
    "the discussion in section 5 of  @xcite ) , we would expect relatively more branching , i.e. , a smaller @xmath51 , at higher pressures .    for thick streamers in air",
    "at 1 bar , we find @xmath51 = 8 @xmath24 4 .",
    "therefore for fixed pressure , thicker streamers are longer from one splitting to the next , but measured on the scale of their diameter , they branch slightly more frequently .",
    "this trend agrees with observations of yi and williams @xcite ; they report an average branching distance of 3 mm for positive streamers with a diameter of about 2 mm in n@xmath27 at 1 bar at 98 kv .",
    "this yields @xmath78 in qualitative agreement with our observation that the ratio @xmath51 decreases with increasing voltage at a fixed pressure .",
    "it also indicates that streamers in nitrogen branch more frequently than in air .",
    "the branching ratio in our n@xmath27 is @xmath79 for thin streamers in the same pressure range .",
    "this value is somewhat lower than in air . as also the diameter @xmath50 of n@xmath27 streamers",
    "is smaller , the absolute streamer length @xmath49 between branching is only half of that in air at the same pressure .",
    "this can be seen qualitatively in figure [ n2airsimpel ] . for a further comparison of streamers in air and in our n@xmath27",
    ", we refer to the [ app ] .",
    "we conclude that the reduced diameter @xmath57 of minimal streamers is constant for pressures in the range from @xmath62 to 1 bar at room temperature , while present theory predicts a change of behavior above approximately 0.04 bar .",
    "the velocity , initial cloud size and branching structure also scale quite well with pressure , but due to the experimental limitations this could only be tested in a less extended pressure range .",
    "evaluating the results in our n@xmath27 is somewhat problematic because presently the impurity level in the gas is not sufficiently controlled . in the near future we plan new experiments to improve this situation . in any case , the comparison of our experimental results with theory at varying pressure and gas composition and the discussion of the microscopic physical mechanisms will pose challenges for the future .",
