    "this paper is concerned with the study of the finite - size properties of a solvable two - dimensional vertex model based on the five - dimensional representation of the @xmath0 superalgebra .",

    "the particle moves along the bonds of the lattice and is scattered according to scattering rules fixed a priori once it reaches a given node . here",
    "the scatterers are constituted of mirrors tilted right and left , i.e.  by @xmath4 , with respect to the lattice @xcite .",
    "when the particle collides with a mirror it will turn right or left , depending on the orientation of the latter . in the absence of a mirror at a node",
    "the particle passes the node on a straight path .",

    "the kinetic properties of this lattice lorentz gas have been investigated by numerical simulations where an anomalous diffusive behavior was observed @xcite . in the case of partially occupied lattice by mirrors ( @xmath8 ) the fractal dimension of large trajectories",
    "was argued to be @xmath9 with the presence of logarithmic corrections @xcite .",
    "an alternative interpretation of the paths of particles in this lattice gas is in terms of the degrees of freedom of an intersecting loop model with periodic boundary conditions in both lattice directions imposed . in figure",

    "for the case of fugacity @xmath1 this intersecting loop model can be reformulated as the @xmath0 supersymmetric vertex model which is the subject of this paper .",
    "the integrability of this model provides a framework for the study of its critical behaviour and  exploiting the equivalences listed above  of the peculiar properties observed in the lorentz lattice gas .",
    "in fact , the finite - size analysis of the lowest excitation of the @xmath0 superspin chain found the respective critical exponent to be very small @xcite .",
    "this was taken as an indication for the presence of a zero conformal dimension on the spectrum implying the superdiffusive behaviour ( @xmath9 ) predicted for the lorentz gas .",
    "in the context of the loop model , it has been argued that this behaviour signals the existence of an unusual critical phase of intersecting loops : in two dimensions the crossing of loops , @xmath16 , is a relevant perturbation to the low temperature dense loops phase @xcite . as a consequence the long distance behaviour of correlation functions in the loop model with fugacity of closed loops",
    "@xmath17 should be that of the goldstone phase of the @xmath2 sigma model . for integer @xmath18 this regime",
    "can be described in a supersymmetric formulation of the field theory in terms of @xmath19 bosons and @xmath20 symplectic fermions , @xmath21 .",
    "the @xmath0 vertex model is one from a class of integrable lattice regularizations of these models .",
    "their central charges are @xmath22 as expected in the goldstone phase @xcite .",
    "there has been a series of attempts towards the identification of the other characteristic feature of this goldstone phase starting from integrable lattice models , i.e.  a finite density of vanishing critical exponents .",
    "the existence of a continuous spectrum of conformal weights has been established in several staggered superspin chains @xcite , including a model based on the four - dimensional representations of @xmath23 $ ] alternating with their duals which , in the self - dual case , is isomorphic a deformation of the @xmath24 chain relevant to the loop model with fugacity @xmath25 @xcite .",
    "further details of the spectral properties of these models have been uncovered when it was realized that hidden within the zero charge sector of this superspin chain there exists a staggered six - vertex model which already displays a continuous low energy spectrum .",
    "for the latter strong evidence has been accumulated that the effective theory describing the low energy excitations of the model is the @xmath26 sigma model at a level related to the anisotropy @xcite .",
    "we note , however , that the focus of these studies has been on the anisotropic deformations of the vertex models : while it has been established that the isotropic @xmath25 models are on the boundary of the critical region , the question of the critical properties at the isotropic point itself has not been addressed .    in this paper",
    "we want to return to the case of @xmath3 as described by the @xmath0 supersymmetric vertex model .",
    "as argued above , the critical properties of this model are those of the proposed goldstone phase of the @xmath27 sigma model and can be studied based on its solutions by means of the algebraic bethe ansatz . by means of an extensive finite - size study of the model",
    "we accumulate ample evidence for the existence of continua of critical exponents with lower edges at scaling dimensions @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32,  . with the exception of the the ground state of the superspin chain all of the states considered",
    "show strong logarithmic corrections to scaling governed by the flow of the model to weak coupling in the goldstone phase .",
    "this is complemented by the observation that many excitations which have energies @xmath33 for small system sizes but disappear from the low energy spectrum as the system size is increased .",
    "both of these features of the spectrum require very large system sizes to be studied for a reliable identification of the low energy effective theory : here we consider lattices with up to @xmath34 sites .    finally ,",
    "since recent numerical studies of the @xmath3 intersecting loop model have emphasized the importance of boundary conditions for the long distance behaviour of correlation functions @xcite we consider both periodic boundary conditions to the superspin chain and twisted ones depending on the fermion number .",
    "comparing the results we find that the amplitudes of the subleading ( logarithmic in the system size ) finite - size corrections do depend on the choice of boundary conditions .",
    "the statistical configurations of the lorentz lattice gas or intersecting loop model mentioned in the introduction have a one - to - one correspondence with the generators of the braid - monoid algebra .",
    "this fact has been elaborated previously in the work @xcite but for sake of completeness we have summarized this equivalence in appendix  [ app : braidmonoid ] .",
    "this algebra can be used to built solvable models and it turns out that integrability is assured when the weights are parameterized as @xmath35 where @xmath36 is a free spectral parameter and @xmath37 is an arbitrary normalization .",
    "this scale can be chosen to interpret the weights as probabilities but in our context we set it to unity .",
    "note that all three weights are positive for @xmath38 .",
    "furthermore , it has been shown that this integrable manifold can be realized in terms of a standard local vertex model .",
    "its bond states are constituted of three bosonic and two fermionic degrees of freedom realized in terms of the five - dimensional representation of the @xmath0 superalgebra , see appendix  [ app : osp ] .",

    "the @xmath49-matrix @xmath50 is the basic ingredient to built an explicit representation for the monoid operator and its expression depends much on the grading order basis , see for instance @xcite . here",
    "we will consider two specific grassmann orderings in which the two @xmath51 charges of the @xmath0 algebra commuting with the operator @xmath52 are organized in a way which is suitable to perform the bethe ansatz analysis .",
    "this turns out to be the @xmath53 and @xmath54 basis ordering and the corresponding forms for the matrix @xmath55 are @xmath56    for the vertex model on the square lattice with @xmath57 vertices and periodic boundary conditions for both bosonic and fermionic configurations in the horizontal direction we now construct the vertex model row - to - row transfer matrix .",

    "the partition function of any statistical model is dominated by the largest eigenvalue of the transfer matrix . in the present case",
    "the contribution of a single vertex to the partition function is the sum of the three weights @xmath69 .",
    "therefore , as long as the boltzmann weights are all non - negative ( i.e.  in the regime @xmath70 ) , we conclude that the largest eigenvalue of the transfer matrix @xmath71 for the lattice with linear dimension @xmath72 is @xmath73^{{l}}\\,.\\ ] ] the fact that there are no subleading ( in @xmath72 ) corrections is a consequence of the grading of the states together with the properties of the @xmath0 representations appearing in the hilbert space , see appendix  [ app : osp ] .",

    "( [ partfun ] ) implies that the partition function can be normalized to @xmath75 by rescaling of the local boltzmann weights .",
    "note that this does not necessarily mean that the low - lying excitations in the spectrum of the transfer matrix are trivial .",
    "in general , we can only infer that the critical properties are governed by a conformal field theory ( cft ) with central charge @xmath76 .",
    "since the hamiltonian ( [ o32hamil ] ) is a non - hermitian operator the continuum limit is not expected to be described by a _",

    "the diagonalization of the transfer matrix can be carried out within the algebraic bethe ansatz framework .",
    "the essential tools have already been discussed before @xcite and here we shall present only the main results .",
    "it turns out to be convenient to re - scale the spectral parameter by the imaginary unit to bring the resulting equations into a canonical form for performing numerical analysis . denoting by @xmath77 the eigenvalues of the transfer matrix ( [ transfm ] ) we find that they can be parametrized in terms of two sets of rapidities @xmath78 , @xmath79 .",
