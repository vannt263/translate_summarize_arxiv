    "on the other hand , the precise values of these parameters are not important in our present study .",

    "[ [ molecular - orbital - interaction - parameters - and - comparison - with - previous - theoretical - studies ] ] molecular orbital interaction parameters and comparison with previous theoretical studies ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~    in the main text of this paper , we have considered the microscopic atomic orbital(ao ) hubbard model with the local intraorbital coulomb interaction @xmath30 and interorbital coulomb interaction @xmath31 , hund s coupling @xmath32 , and pair hopping @xmath33 , among all five atomic 3d - orbitals @xmath285 .",

    "based on the symmetry argument , @xmath189 corresponds to the @xmath7-band with @xmath48 , denoted by the molecular orbital electron annihilation operator @xmath288 ( with @xmath289 ) in eq.(s2 ) . while @xmath290 and @xmath291 correspond to the @xmath8- and @xmath9-bands with @xmath190 , denoted by the molecular orbital electron annihilation operator @xmath292 ( with @xmath293 ) and @xmath294 ( with @xmath295 ) in eqs.(s5 ) and ( s7 ) , respectively .",
    "after some tedious but straightforward algebras thanks to symmetry properties of the matrices @xmath64 and @xmath72 , the following interaction matrices for various two - particle coulomb interactions and hund s couplings for the above three active molecular orbitals are deduced : @xmath296    in addition , a three - band interaction term @xmath297\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] emerges , with @xmath118 . note that this peculiar interaction is absent in the previous theoretical studies@xcite . however , as we shall show in the next section , this term does not influence the instabilities we concern .",
    "usually , we assume the orbital rotational symmetry of the interacting hamiltonian in the atomic orbital hubbard model , i.e. , @xmath160 and @xmath159.@xcite for a given material , it is understood that values of these local interactions can be meaningfully determined when band structure calculations as using the constraint density functional approaches are implemented by a complete description of the corresponding atomic hubbard model .",
    "so far such detailed calculations on the compound k@xmath178cr@xmath298as@xmath298 are not yet available .",
    "however , these local atomic interactions can be inferred from those in other cr - based oxides , like srcro@xmath2 . according to ref .",
    "@xcite , one has @xmath299 ev , @xmath300 ev in srcro@xmath2 .",
    "these values are relatively smaller than but still closed to those of fe@xmath301 systems like srfeo@xmath178 or iron pnictides , where @xmath302 ev , @xmath303 ev . @xcite the ratio @xmath172 of these systems does not change too much .",
    "hence as a rough estimate , we assume the similar values of srcro@xmath2 for the present compound , obtaining the local molecular orbital interaction matrices from eqs.(s15,s16 ) : @xmath304    notice that it is always possible for these values to be fluctuated within 20% or even more for a given material by using different approaches . with this understanding , it is interesting to compare our results with those in refs.@xcite . in our q1d luttinger theory , while the channel `` 3 '' is always critical for a much wider regime @xmath169 , the channel `` 2 '' is expected to be located at the spin triplet phase because @xmath305 . however , this triplet state should close to the border of the sdw phase , @xmath184 , as shown in fig.3 in the main text .    in ref.@xcite ,",
    "the following interaction matrices for phenomenological molecular bands are introduced : @xmath306 while in ref.@xcite , @xmath307 here , we use the same notations introduced in refs.@xcite , respectively .",
    "the relationships @xmath308 , @xmath309 , and @xmath310 were used in calcuations @xcite .",
    "it should be understood that ( i ) the parameters used in these studies are for the molecular orbital bands ; ( ii ) they do not rigorously correspond to our interaction matrices given by eqs.(s15-s17 ) .",
    "nevertheless , we may expect that if the largest elements in the interaction matrices @xmath185 and @xmath186 dominate in the random phase approximation ( rpa ) approach , the values of atomic interactions estimated in our case correspond to the case of @xmath311 , @xmath312 , and @xmath313 in ref.@xcite .",
    "so the channel `` 2 '' should correspond to the regime with small @xmath30 but large @xmath314 in ref.@xcite . as shown in fig .",
    "3(a ) in ref.@xcite , this phase favors the spin triplet @xmath188 pairing state .",
    "notice that these values are out of the calculated regime of the phase diagram fig ( 6 ) in ref.@xcite , but the same tendency is reached if this phase diagram is extended to large ration of @xmath314 .",
    "owing to the symmetry between the mo bands @xmath290 and @xmath291 , there are twelve permissible perturbations which can be classified in terms of the formal @xmath129-ology description @xcite using the same notation in @xcite :    @xmath315+(r\\leftrightarrow l)\\nonumber\\\\ & + & f^{(2)}\\sum_{\\sigma\\sigma'}[r^{\\dagger}_{1\\sigma}r_{1\\sigma}l^{\\dagger}_{2\\sigma'}l_{2\\sigma'}+(2\\leftrightarrow 3)]+(r\\leftrightarrow l)\\nonumber\\\\ & + & u\\sum_{\\sigma\\sigma'}[r^{\\dagger}_{1\\sigma}l^{\\dagger}_{1\\sigma'}l_{2\\sigma'}r_{3\\sigma}+(2\\leftrightarrow 3)]+h.c.\\nonumber\\\\ & + & v\\sum_{\\sigma\\sigma'}[r^{\\dagger}_{1\\sigma}l^{\\dagger}_{1\\sigma'}r_{2\\sigma'}l_{3\\sigma}+(2\\leftrightarrow 3)]+h.c .. \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    in this notation , the degeneracy between the mo bands @xmath290 and @xmath291 are explicit .",
    "the one - loop renormalization group ( rg ) equations for these coupling constants evolving with increasing scaling parameter @xmath316 are of common type , given by @xcite : @xmath317 in above , @xmath318 , and @xmath319 the corresponding bare mo interaction parameters , which are related to initial values of perturbations defined in eq.(s22 ) in solving the rg equations , are given in eqs.(s15-s17 ) .",
    "the initial values of perturbations @xmath320 and @xmath321 are the same in the present model , both induced by the three - band interaction @xmath322 .",
    "when @xmath316 approaches a sufficient large cutoff scale @xmath323 , the generic asymptotic solutions take the form @xmath324 .",
    "an instability takes place whenever some of the couplings diverge at a finite scale length @xmath325 .",
    "we numerically determine the most divergent coupling when @xmath316 approaches @xmath325 , which is taken to be unit , from below .",
    "for usual @xmath10-transition metals , @xmath326 , we find that @xmath327 or @xmath328 dominates in the large or small @xmath172 regimes , respectively , as plotted in figure [ rg](a ) .",
    "these two regimes correspond to the known single - band and the two - band instabilities respectively@xcite .",
    "it was suggested that in addition to these one - band and two - band instabilities , there may be a new instability driven by the presence of all three bands due to the perturbation @xmath320 or @xmath321 .",
    "we have checked that this instability does not occur if the initial @xmath320 and @xmath321 have the same sign as determined in the present case .",
    "we have also checked that if the initial values of @xmath320 and @xmath321 have the opposite sign , say , assuming @xmath329 and @xmath330 for very small @xmath32 , there is a regime where @xmath321 dominates over all other perturbations as shown in fig .",
    "[ rg](b ) .",
    "it is interesting to recall that the electron - phonon coupling , which has not been adequately considered in the present study , may result in deviations of effective perturbations away from the initial values determined in eq.(s22 ) .",
    "how such modification upon electron - phonon coupling takes place and whether it influences the superconductivity in the k@xmath178cr@xmath2as@xmath2 compound deserve further investigations .",

    "<S> as we shall find later , only symmetry property of the mo bands and local interactions between them play a crucial role in the luttinger liquid approach .        for simplicity , from now on , we shall use the band subscript @xmath96 ( @xmath97 ) to account for the three mo bands intersecting the fermi energy . </S>",
    "<S> these active mo bands are associated with phases @xmath98 , or chiralities @xmath99 , @xmath100 , and @xmath101 , respectively . in the full 1d brillouin zone </S>",
    "<S> , there are three pairs of fermi points ( @xmath102 ) , satisfying @xmath103 , as schematically shown in the inset of fig.[fit ] . by integrating out all inactive bands </S>",
    "<S> , we obtain the effective theory describing the low energy property of the active bands : @xmath104 where , @xmath105 is the density operator of electrons in the @xmath96th mo band , @xmath106 the residual short - range interactions in the mos in the @xmath44th unit cell , given by @xmath107.\\nonumber \\label{heffint}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in this expression , the electron annihilation operator in the @xmath44-th unit cell is defined by the fourier transformation @xmath108 ( with @xmath109 the lattice spacing taken as unit ) . only those terms preserving the neutrality condition @xmath110 could survive . the matrix @xmath111 is used in deducing eq.(5 ) as the short - range interactions are mainly due to the slowly varying part , leading to @xmath112 , @xmath113 ; @xmath114 ; @xmath115 ; @xmath116 ; @xmath117 ; and @xmath118 . </S>",
    "<S> the influence of inactive bands is mainly accounted to the renormalized tight - binding parameters .    _ </S>",
    "<S> the luttinger liquid in the weak - coupling regime._we now take the continuous limit , linearize the active bands near the fermi points , and decompose the electron operator into right and left moving components like @xmath119 . here , @xmath120 is the spatial coordinate along the tube direction , @xmath121 and @xmath122 represent the right and left moving fermions describing the low energy excitations near the fermi points ( @xmath123 , @xmath124 ) with linear dispersion @xmath125 . the long - wavelength , </S>",

    "<S> we shall assume the fermi velocities @xmath130 to be the same as this does not influence the nature of superconductivity we concern . </S>",
    "<S> the corresponding one - loop renormalization group ( rg ) equations resemble those for three - leg hubbard ladders@xcite or a variant of carbon nanotubes@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the instabilities of these rg equations are classified routinely : ( i ) the intraband instabilities as those developed in the single - channel luttinger liquid@xcite , and ( ii ) the interband instabilities as those developed in the two - channel band luttinger liquid . </S>",
    "<S> note that the three - band interaction in eq.(5 ) does not lead to the peculiar three - band instability suggested in ref.@xcite as shown in the sm@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> all these suggest the validity of the conventional bosonization approach based on spin - charge separation , where various ordering instabilities can be determined by luttinger parameters . </S>",
    "<S> the new ingredients here are the peculiar symmetry surviving in the active mo bands and their dependence on local electron interactions .    </S>",
    "<S> the right- and left - moving fields are then expressed in terms of the charge fields ( @xmath131 , @xmath132 ) and the spin fields ( @xmath133 , @xmath134 ) ( for each @xmath135 ) by @xmath136 the klein factors @xmath137 and @xmath138 ensure the fermionic statistics between the right and left moving fermions . </S>",
    "<S> next , in order to diagonalize the kinetic part , we need to introduce a set of new base @xmath139 where @xmath140 , @xmath141 for @xmath142 , @xmath143 , @xmath144 , @xmath145 , @xmath146 , @xmath147 are the normalization constants . </S>",
    "<S> similar relationships apply to the fields @xmath148 and @xmath149 for @xmath150 . </S>",
    "<S> hence , we arrive at the following three - channel tomonaga - luttinger liquid hamiltonian : @xmath151 \\label{hluttinger}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where , @xmath152 $ ] for @xmath142 , and @xmath153 , @xmath154 , @xmath155 . therefore , the luttinger parameters are obtained explicitly by @xmath156^{-\\frac{1}{2}},\\\\ k_{s , i}=\\left[1-\\frac{u}{4\\pi v_f}-\\frac{(-1)^{i}}{12\\pi v_f}\\sqrt{8j^2_h+u^2}\\right]^{-\\frac{1}{2 } } \\end{array}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for the channels @xmath142 , respectively , and @xmath157 for the third channel @xmath158 . </S>",
    "<S> here , we have adopted the conventional relations @xmath159 and @xmath160 , reflecting the rotational symmetry of the original aos@xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> now since @xmath161 and @xmath162 , one can find that : ( i ) @xmath163 in the entire region and @xmath164 only when @xmath165 ; ( ii ) @xmath166 in the region @xmath167 and @xmath168 in the entire region . specifically , in the physically relevant regime , @xmath169 , the spin excitations are always gapless , so @xmath170 could be fixed to the unit due to the spin - su(2 ) symmetry . because @xmath163 , the channel-``1 '' is in the spin - density - wave ( sdw ) phase@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the channel-``3 '' involves the antibonding of the mo bands @xmath171 as shown in eq.([newbase ] ) . in this channel </S>",
    "<S> both spin and charge excitations are critical . because of the absence of a spin gap , the dominating superconducting instability is the interband spin triplet pairing@xcite , driven by the interband scattering between the two q1d @xmath8 and @xmath9 bands . </S>",
    "<S> the intriguing case is the channel-``2 '' , whose property depends on the ratio @xmath172 . </S>",
    "<S> we plot in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ phase2 ] the phase diagram determined by the luttinger parameters in this channel .     </S>",
    "<S> everywhere , and @xmath166 only in the intermediate regime between the lines @xmath173 and @xmath174.,width=207 ]    we find that @xmath175 in the regimes separated by the orange - dotted and blue - dashed lines , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> in these two separated regimes , the dominating instability is still the spin - triplet pairing@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> but in the intermediate regime where @xmath166 , the sdw instability dominates . it should be noticed that in either case where the interband triplet superconducting instabilities dominate , the spin - singlet superconducting instability is the subdominating instability@xcite .    in order to see whether the above luttinger liquid results are robust against deviations from the atomic orbital rotational symmetry , </S>",
    "<S> we have also considered a small deviation @xmath176 away from the rotational symmetry by assuming @xmath177 . </S>",
    "<S> as shown in the sm , the channel-3 is still in the critical phase and the role of @xmath176 is to modify the value of u in a simple manner so that the results remain unchanged@xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> _ summary and discussions._we have focused on the microscopic formation of the mo bands in a twisted hubbard tube capturing the q1d nature of k@xmath178cr@xmath2as@xmath2 , a new q1d multiorbital superconducting molecular crystal with the moderate coulomb interaction and hund s coupling . </S>",
    "<S> a three - channel tomonaga - luttinger liquid hamiltonian describing the low energy physics of the three active mo bands ( the @xmath8 , @xmath9 , and @xmath7 bands ) is then derived , showing possible unconventional triplet superconducting instabilities within a reasonable range of interaction parameters .    </S>",
    "<S> the conclusions and implications of our study are compared with the previous studies @xcite where a phenomenological 3d hubbard model for the three active mo bands was proposed based on the elegant symmetry argument@xcite and investigated by the random phase approximation@xcite and the mean field treatment@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> first , the twisted structure of the q1d [ cras]@xmath0 tube showing the extended glide reflection symmetry in accordance with the @xmath49 group is explored in our approach so that the symmetry property of all the thirty mo bands ( including the three active mo bands ) could be identified . </S>",
    "<S> second , the interactions among the three active mo bands are derived from the microscopic atomic hubbard interactions , different from those proposed phenomenologically . </S>",
    "<S> third , the three diagonal channels in our tomonaga - luttinger hamiltonian are superpositions of the original dft bands , in contrast to the random phase approximation approach and the mean field treatment .    </S>",
    "<S> we found two kinds of spin - triplet pairing instabilities emerging out from two of the three channels . </S>",
    "<S> one involves the q1d @xmath8 and @xmath9 bands , another involves all three bands . in the luttinger liquid approach , </S>",
    "<S> triplet pairing instabilities are due to gapless spin excitations for @xmath169 and @xmath179 in the corresponding channels . </S>",
    "<S> the ferromagnetic correlation within the sublattice of cr atoms@xcite , though possible , is not a prerequisite of the triplet states . </S>",
    "<S> we also found an intermediate regime @xmath180 where the sdw phase emerges . </S>",
    "<S> our solution is sensitive to the symmetry or regularity of the two conjugated cr triangles , seemingly consistent with the recent hydrostatic and uniaxial pressure experimental study@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the exact mapping from the aos to mo bands will also pave the way for further investigations on related effects such as the spin - orbit coupling within a microscopic framework .    </S>",
    "<S> as the present study is limited to the q1d case , the spatial symmetry of the superconducting pairing states is not specified . however , the actual 3d superconductivity can be perceived based on the q1d physics because the identification of the three low energy mo bands is robust owing to the same symmetry argument . </S>",
    "<S> the local interactions among the mo bands are similar to those in the q1d case . </S>",
    "<S> if the local atomic interactions are estimated as those in other cr - based oxides , like srcro@xmath2@xcite , one has @xmath181 ev , @xmath182 ev , and @xmath183 , then in the q1d case the channel-2 is in the triplet phase but close to the sdw low boundary @xmath184 shown in fig.[phase2 ] . </S>",
    "<S> the corresponding residual mo interactions @xmath185 and @xmath186 in the 3d case are significantly suppressed , but the ratio @xmath187 enhanced@xcite , corresponding to the regime with small @xmath185 but relatively large @xmath187 in ref.@xcite , where the triplet @xmath188 pairing state is favored . </S>",
    "<S> of course , we have not considered the long - range coulomb interaction and the electron - phonon coupling , the suppression of residual mo interactions should necessitate further investigations on these influences .    finally , a more intriguing issue is the possible dimensional crossover from q1d to 3d which could be tuned by either chemical substitution@xcite or physical pressure@xcite . on one hand , </S>",
    "<S> one of the three active bands , corresponding to @xmath189 , evolves with the intertube hopping and crossovers to the 3d @xmath7 band which could lead to the line nodal feature . </S>",
    "<S> meanwhile , the ( @xmath8 , @xmath9 ) bands could remain in q1d because the intertube hopping among the aos with @xmath190 is reasonably small . on the other hand </S>",
    "<S> , the q1d superconducting instability can lead to a true long - range order when the intertube hopping is taken into account . recall that the interband triplet pairing instability in the channel-2 is driven not only by the @xmath7 band , but also by the ( @xmath8 , @xmath9 ) bands . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , the spin - triplet pairing instability in the channel-2 involves both the 3d and q1d bands . </S>",
    "<S> as such a 3d pairing state could emerge from a normal state of an essentially q1d luttinger liquid characteristic , a scenario which is likely consistent with available experiments . </S>",
    "<S> it is desirable to investigate the related crossover behavior in this class of materials in the future .    </S>",
