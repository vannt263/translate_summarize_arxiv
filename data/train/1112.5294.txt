    "in a number of cases complex systems can be treated in a simplified manner , if a position - dependent mass is introduced .",
    "one prominent example is the concept of an effective electron mass in solid - state physics where position - dependent masses provide a way to obtain corrections to the simplest approach in which a constant effective mass is used ( see , e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) . as a consequence ,",
    "schrdinger equations with a position - dependent mass have been considered in various contexts , for example to study electronic properties of semiconductors @xcite , he clusters @xcite , or super - lattice band structures @xcite .    also in molecular physics or theoretical chemistry position - dependent masses can occur , if high - dimensional nuclear motion is described using a lower dimensional effective hamiltonian .",
    "a rather well known example is the theoretical description of the inversion motion ( umbrella mode ) in ammonia molecules ( nh@xmath0 ) in which the nitrogen atom is moving from one side of the plane formed by the three hydrogen atoms to the other .",
    "in fact , this involves a collective motion , since the hydrogen - nitrogen bonds change their lengths while the nitrogen atom moves .",
    "this is thus an example of strongly coupled vibrational modes , in this case of the symmetric bending and stretching modes .",
    "while the main physics of this motion can be captured by an effective one - dimensional double - well potential , an improved approximation is achieved by introducing a position - dependent mass while still maintaining a one - dimensional treatment .",
    "the inversion motion of ammonia and its one - dimensional model has been studied extensively in several papers , e.g. , in @xcite , and has been exploited for the ammonia maser @xcite .",
    "especially aquino @xmath1 @xmath2  @xcite obtained very accurate results in comparison to experiment by reducing the two - dimensional problem to a one - dimensional problem with a position - dependent reduced mass .",
    "note that this ansatz is deduced from classical arguments and thus leads to quantum mechanical operator ordering ambiguities , since it is not clear anymore how to order the operators in the kinetic term @xmath3 .",
    "the accurate and efficient solution of a schrdinger equation with a position - dependent mass is non - trivial and various efforts were made even recently to find analytical or numerical solutions , e.g. , in @xcite .    in this work",
    "a matrix method is introduced that determines efficiently and accurately the bound states of schrdinger equations with a position - dependent mass .",
    "the algorithm is very flexible and allows to consider different symmetrized or non - symmetrized forms of the kinetic - energy operator .",
    "furthermore , also non - hermitian hamiltonians can be treated , including complex ones .",
    "non - hermitian pt - symmetric hamiltonians have recently stirred some interest @xcite in connection with the question under which circumstances the spectrum may still remain real .",
    "in addition to that , non - hermitian hamiltonians ( also without pt - symmetry ) occur for example in the context of complex optical potentials ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .    after a brief discussion of hamiltonians with a position - dependent mass or pt symmetry in sec .",
    "[ sec : pdm ] the method is presented in sec .",
    "[ sec : method ] . in sec .",
    "[ sec : examples ] the performance of the method is discussed for a number of examples . this includes a study of the inversion mode of nh@xmath0 ( sec .",
    "[ sec : nh3ex ] ) and nd@xmath0 ( sec .",
    "[ sec : nd3 ] ) , the morse potential ( sec .  [ sec : morse ] ) , a harmonic oscillator with position - dependent mass ( sec .  [ sec : pdmho ] ) , and examples of pt - symmetric and non - symmetric non - hermitian hamiltonians ( sec .",
    "[ sec : pttest ] ) .",
    "we also use the example in sec .  [",
    "sec : nh3ex ] to discuss the convergence properties of the method ( sec .",
    "[ sec : convergence ] ) .",
    "in addition to these one - dimensional examples , we discuss the application of the algorithm to the two - dimensional henon - heiles system ( sec .",
    "[ sec : hhs ] ) .",
    "we want to replace @xmath4 in one - dimensional quantum systems and , therefore , investigate various ways to order the operators in the kinetic - energy terms .",
    "a whole class of hermitian hamiltonians with position - dependent mass is given by the von roos hamiltonians @xcite , @xmath5 with @xmath6 and @xmath7 with the usual canonical operators @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "the choice @xmath10 , @xmath11 leads to @xmath12 while with @xmath13 , @xmath14 one finds @xmath15 while there is no _ a priory _ reason to favor any of the hermitian hamiltonians , for example a specific choice of @xmath16 , and @xmath17 , non - hermitian hamiltonians are often rejected for general reasons , since they can possess complex eigenvalues .",
    "however , in standard quantum mechanics _ closed _ systems are described by hermitian hamiltonians and real eigenvalue spectra .",
    "( note that non - hermitian hamiltonians occur , e.g. , in the approximate description of open systems with optical potentials . ) regarding the reality of the spectrum , non - hermitian pt - symmetric hamiltonians form a special class as discussed in @xcite .",
    "therefore , they are of special interest for possible extensions of standard quantum mechanics .",
    "note , however , that these extensions often also involve a complex potential instead of a position - dependent mass . for the nh@xmath0 molecule",
    "the position - dependent reduced mass @xmath18 in @xcite was derived within classical mechanics and then translated into quantum mechanics in the form @xmath19 which is non - hermitian , but convenient for computation . the advantage of eq .",
    "( [ eq : m01 ] ) is that no first derivative of the wavefunction occurs .",
    "this simplifies the numerical solution with standard approaches .",
    "for example , the numerov - cooley method @xcite can be adopted as was done in @xcite .",
    "another possible non - hermitian choice is @xmath20 ( note if both the potential @xmath21 and the mass @xmath22 possess inversion symmetry , @xmath23 and @xmath24 , as is the case for ammonia , then the hamiltonians in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : m01 ] ) and ( [ eq : m03 ] ) are p and t symmetric . )",
    "it is important to not only have an efficient and reliable solver for one version of the hamiltonian , but to be able to compare the results of different versions . ideally , the results agree sufficiently well and thus the question of the proper form becomes practically inessential for the attempted approximation level . a strong variation of the results with the chosen form of the hamiltonian , on the other hand , is a clear warning signal . since non - hermitian and ( for example for @xmath25 ) in principle even pt non - symmetric hamiltonians can be obtained for some versions of the hamiltonians with a position - dependent mass , it is also of interest to have a solver that can handle these cases and that detects possible non - vanishing imaginary components of the eigenvalues .",
    "this is , in fact , also an important issue in the general context of pt - symmetric hamiltonians ( or other proposals for extensions of standard quantum mechanics ) without position - dependent masses .",
    "since in the majority of cases physically relevant hamiltonians do not possess analytical solutions , it is important to numerically check whether the eigenvalue spectrum is purely real or not .",
    "the algorithm presented below provides a promising solution to this type of problems .",
    "position - dependent masses are easily handled , even for different formulations of the kinetic - energy operator .",
    "furthermore , a number of bound states are obtained simultaneously within a single calculation .",
    "finally , the algorithm can equally well be applied to complex hamiltonians and thus also to non - hermitian hamiltonians with either purely real or partly complex eigenvalues .",
    "the technique to investigate simple quantum systems reviewed below has been taught by one of us ( u.  w. ) in the computational physics courses at humboldt university since 2006 .",
    "it has also recently been used for supersymmetric quantum mechanics in @xcite .",
    "the basis is the so - called slac derivative that was proposed for lattice fermions in @xcite . while it had to be discarded for four dimensional quantum field theory due to incompatibilities with ultraviolet renormalization @xcite",
    "no such problems seem to hamper the present quantum mechanical applications .",
    "we define a one - dimensional position space lattice consisting of an odd number of @xmath26 points @xmath27 that are equidistantly spaced with the lattice spacing @xmath28 and lie symmetrically around the origin .",
    "wave ` functions ' in the schrdinger representation of quantum mechanics are restricted to this space @xmath29 and thus the hilbert space is approximated by @xmath30 .",
    "intuitively , a bound state that is centered around the origin , can be represented well in this framework , if its size is much smaller than @xmath31 such that the sites @xmath32 are deeply in the classically forbidden region",
    ". moreover @xmath28 must be small enough to allow for a good resolution of structures in the wave function .",
    "for example , for a simple harmonic oscillator of mass @xmath22 and frequency @xmath33 these conditions amount to @xmath34 .",
    "linear operators must become finite matrices now .",
    "functions of the position operator like the potential @xmath35 trivially translate into diagonal matrices @xmath36 to also implement a canonically conjugate momentum operator @xmath8 that has to mimic the derivative , we need to impose boundary conditions which we take periodic with period @xmath37 .",
    "note that this also implies a periodic extension of the diagonal elements of the position operator .",
    "this means that odd powers of @xmath9 create jumps at odd - integer multiples of @xmath38 , in particular at @xmath32 , which will , however , be seen to cause no problems in our applications here .",
    "the first idea that comes to mind now is to represent @xmath39 by a difference operator over three ( or more ) sites .",
    "this would clearly inflict leading discretization errors that are powers of @xmath40 .",
    "we found that a better precision is obtained by fourier transforming , then using a diagonal operator for @xmath39 analogous to the one in discrete position space and then transforming back .",

    "we discretize each direction as before and obtain a rectangle filled with sites @xmath62 with the unique compound index @xmath63 operators are embedded in the tensor product state space .",

    "note that in more than one dimension many vanishing matrix elements appear in a typical hamiltonian .",

    "for the two - dimensional henon - heiles system , around 5 minutes are needed to find the eigenenergies and around 60 minutes are required to find the eigenfunctions in addition when using 101x101 points .",
    "therefore , an implementation in programming languages like fortran or c which would speed up the algorithm is a possible future option , but was not needed for the examples considered in this work .",
    "furthermore , with only a single matrix diagonalization many bound states with eigenenergies @xmath58 are found simultaneously .",
    "other algorithms @xcite which were previously used to solve the one - dimensional schrdinger equation with position - dependent masses consist of `` guessing '' an eigenenergy @xmath69 and a subsequent test whether the resulting wave function has the correct behavior to fulfill the schrdinger equation or not .",
    "to calculate the energy levels describing the inversion motion in ammonia with our algorithm , we exactly follow the procedure in @xcite and first represent the data points ( from table 1 in @xcite ) for the double - well potential @xmath70 describing the inversion mode by an even polynomial of degree 20 .",
    "our coefficients are listed in the appendix .",
    "it might be noted that the potential obtained with dft is in good agreement with the experimental value for the equilibrium geometry in @xcite and the obtained barrier height of 2013.5 @xmath71 agrees well with the one from empirical procedures ( 2018 @xmath72 @xmath71 @xcite ) .",
