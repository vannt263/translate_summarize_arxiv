    "the phenomenon of @xmath11 violation , so far observed only in the neutral kaon system , can be accommodated by a complex phase in the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) quark - mixing matrix  @xcite . whether this phase is the correct , or only , source of @xmath11 violation awaits experimental confirmation .",
    "meson decays , in particular charmless @xmath0 meson decays , will play an important role in verifying this picture .",
    "the decays @xmath12 and @xmath13 , dominated by the @xmath14 tree diagram ( fig .",

    "additional measurements of @xmath18 , @xmath19 , or a flavor tagged proper - time dependent full dalitz plot fit for @xmath20 and the use of isospin symmetry may resolve these uncertainties  @xcite@xcite@xcite . alternatively , measurement of @xmath11 violation due to the interference of @xmath21 and @xmath22 in @xmath23  @xcite may provide information about the angle @xmath24 of the unitarity triangle .",
    "neither flavor tagging nor a measurement of the proper - time before decay of the @xmath0 meson is required in this case .",
    "extraction of the angle @xmath24 from this measurement is subject to theoretical uncertainties due to penguin pollution .",
    "however , factorization predicts this to be less severe here than in @xmath25 due to at least partial cancelation of the gluonic penguin contribution among short distance operators with different chirality .",
    "@xmath26  decays are dominated by the @xmath27 gluonic penguin diagram , with additional contributions from @xmath28 tree and color - allowed electroweak penguin ( fig .",
    "[ fig : feynman](d ) ) processes .",
    "interference between the penguin ( fig .",
    "[ fig : feynman](b),(d ) ) and spectator ( fig .",
    "[ fig : feynman](a),(c ) ) amplitudes can lead to direct @xmath11 violation , which would manifest itself as a rate asymmetry for decays of @xmath0 and @xmath29  mesons .",
    "several methods of measuring the angle @xmath24 using only decay rates of @xmath30 processes were also proposed  @xcite .",
    "this is particularly important , as @xmath31  is the least known parameter of the unitarity triangle and is likely to remain the most difficult to determine experimentally .",
    "the ratios @xmath32  @xcite , and @xmath33  @xcite , were recently suggested as a way to constrain @xmath24 .",
    "electroweak penguins and final state interactions ( fsi ) in @xmath34 decays can significantly affect the former method  @xcite , whereas the latter method requires knowledge of the ratio @xmath35 of spectator to penguin amplitudes in @xmath36 transitions .",

    "this is of interest because one probes the interference between the amplitudes for @xmath36 penguin and @xmath15  mixing , rather than @xmath43 tree and @xmath15  mixing , as done in the more ubiquitous @xmath44 decay .",
    "it has been argued  @xcite that a variety of new physics scenarios would affect the cp violating phase of the @xmath36 penguin only , leaving the phases of @xmath15  mixing and @xmath9 tree amplitudes unchanged .",
    "such new physics scenarios would thus lead to a difference between proper - time dependent @xmath11 violation as measured for example in @xmath0 decays to @xmath38 as compared to @xmath44 .",
    "the present paper presents preliminary cleo results on two - body charmless hadronic decays of @xmath0 mesons into final states containing two pseudo - scalar mesons ( @xmath45 ) , or a pseudo - scalar and a vector meson ( @xmath46 ) .",

    "results on @xmath45 and @xmath46 are presented in sections iii .",
    "section iv discusses possible implications of some of the measurements presented .",

    "roughly @xmath47 of the data is taken at the @xmath48(4s ) ( on - resonance ) while the remaining @xmath49 is taken just below @xmath50 threshold .",
    "the below - threshold sample is used for continuum background studies .",
    "the on - resonance sample contains 5.8  million @xmath50 pairs for all final states except @xmath51 ( @xmath52 being a charged kaon or pion ) , and @xmath53 . for those final states",

    "this is an @xmath54 increase in the number of @xmath50 pairs over the published analyses  @xcite .",
    "in addition , we have re - analyzed the cleo ii data set with improved calibration constants and track - fitting algorithm allowing us to extend our geometric acceptance and track quality requirements .",

    "the cleo detector has been decommissioned for a major detector and accelerator upgrade .",
    "preliminary results based on the full data set of roughly 10  million @xmath50 pairs are expected to be ready for the summer conferences in 1999 .",
    "cleo ii and cleo ii.5 are general purpose solenoidal magnet detectors , described in detail elsewhere  @xcite . in cleo ii , the momenta of charged particles are measured in a tracking system consisting of a 6-layer straw tube chamber , a 10-layer precision drift chamber , and a 51-layer main drift chamber , all operating inside a 1.5 t superconducting solenoid .",
    "the main drift chamber also provides a measurement of the specific ionization loss , @xmath57 , used for particle identification . for cleo ii.5",
    "the 6-layer straw tube chamber was replaced by a 3-layer double sided silicon vertex detector , and the gas in the main drift chamber was changed from an argon - ethane to a helium - propane mixture .",
    "photons are detected using a 7800-crystal csi(tl ) electromagnetic calorimeter .",

    "candidate @xmath60 are selected from pairs of tracks forming well measured displaced vertices .",
    "furthermore , we require the @xmath60 momentum vector to point back to the beam spot and the @xmath61 invariant mass to be within @xmath62  mev , two standard deviations ( @xmath63 ) , of the @xmath60  mass .",
    "isolated showers with energies greater than @xmath64  mev in the central region of the csi calorimeter and greater than @xmath65  mev elsewhere , are defined to be photons .",
    "pairs of photons with an invariant mass within @xmath66  mev ( @xmath67 ) of the nominal @xmath68 mass are kinematically fitted with the mass constrained to the @xmath68 mass . to reduce combinatoric backgrounds we require the lateral shapes of the showers to be consistent with those from photons . to suppress further low energy showers from charged particle interactions in the calorimeter we apply a shower energy dependent isolation cut .",
    "charged particles are identified as kaons or pions using @xmath57 .",
    "electrons are rejected based on @xmath57 and the ratio of the track momentum to the associated shower energy in the csi calorimeter .",
    "we reject muons by requiring that the tracks do not penetrate the steel absorber to a depth greater than seven nuclear interaction lengths . we have studied the @xmath57  separation between kaons and pions for momenta @xmath69  gev@xmath70  in data using @xmath71-tagged @xmath72 decays ; we find a separation of @xmath73 for cleo ii and @xmath74 for cleo ii.5 .",
    "we calculate a beam - constrained @xmath0 mass @xmath75 , where @xmath76 is the @xmath0 candidate momentum and @xmath77 is the beam energy .",
    "the resolution in @xmath78  ranges from 2.5 to 3.0  @xmath79 , where the larger resolution corresponds to decay modes with a high momentum @xmath68 .",
    "we define @xmath80 , where @xmath81 are the energies of the daughters of the @xmath0 meson candidate .",
    "the resolution on @xmath82 is mode - dependent . for final states without @xmath68 s the @xmath82 resolution for cleo ii(ii.5 )",
    "is @xmath83 20@xmath8426(17@xmath8422)mev . for final states with a high momentum @xmath68",
    "the @xmath82 resolution is worse approximately by a factor of two and becomes asymmetric because of energy loss out of the back of the csi crystals .",
    "the energy constraint also helps to distinguish between modes of the same topology .",
    "for example , @xmath82 for @xmath85 , calculated assuming @xmath12 , has a distribution that is centered at @xmath86  mev , giving a separation of @xmath87 between @xmath85 and @xmath12 for cleo ii(ii.5 ) .",
    "in addition , @xmath82 is very powerful in distinguishing @xmath88 from @xmath89 , especially if the positive track from the vector meson is of low momentum .",
    "we accept events with @xmath78  within @xmath90  @xmath91 .",
    "the fiducial region in @xmath82 depends on the final state .",
    "for @xmath45 we use @xmath92  mev for decay modes without ( with ) a @xmath68  in the final state .",
    "the selection criteria for @xmath46 are listed in table ii .",
    "this fiducial region includes the signal region , and a sideband for background determination .",
    "we have studied backgrounds from @xmath43  decays and other @xmath9  and @xmath36  decays and find that all are negligible for @xmath0 decays to two pseudo - scalar mesons .",
    "in contrast , some of the @xmath0 decays to a pseudo - scalar and a vector meson have significant backgrounds from @xmath43 as well as other charmless @xmath0 decays .",
    "we discuss these in more detail below in section iii .",
    "however , the main background in all analyses arises from @xmath93  ( where @xmath94 ) .",
    "such events typically exhibit a two - jet structure and can produce high momentum back - to - back tracks in the fiducial region . to reduce contamination from these events ,",
    "we calculate the angle @xmath95 between the sphericity axis@xcite of the candidate tracks and showers and the sphericity axis of the rest of the event .",
    "the distribution of @xmath96is strongly peaked at @xmath97 for @xmath98  events and is nearly flat for @xmath99events .",
    "we require @xmath100   which eliminates @xmath101of the background for all final states except those including @xmath102 or @xmath103 .",
    "for the latter final states a looser cut of @xmath104 is used .    using a detailed geant - based monte - carlo simulation  @xcite we determine overall detection efficiencies ( @xmath105 ) ranging from a few @xmath56 to @xmath106 in @xmath107 .",
    "efficiencies are listed for all decay modes in the tables in section iii .",
    "we estimate systematic errors on the efficiencies using independent data samples .",
    "additional discrimination between signal and @xmath98  background is provided by a fisher discriminant technique as described in detail in ref .",
    "the fisher discriminant is a linear combination @xmath108  where the coefficients @xmath109 are chosen to maximize the separation between the signal and background monte - carlo samples .",
    "the 11 inputs , @xmath110 , are @xmath111 ( the cosine of the angle between the candidate sphericity axis and beam axis ) , the ratio of fox - wolfram moments @xmath112  @xcite , and nine variables that measure the scalar sum of the momenta of tracks and showers from the rest of the event in nine angular bins , each of @xmath113 , centered about the candidate s sphericity axis .",
    "some of the analyses ( final states including @xmath102 or @xmath103 ) use @xmath114 ( the angle between the @xmath0 meson momentum and beam axis ) instead of @xmath112 as one of the inputs to the fisher discriminant .",
    "we perform unbinned maximum - likelihood ( ml ) fits using @xmath82 , @xmath78 , @xmath115 , @xmath114 ( if not used as input to @xmath115 ) and @xmath57 ( where applicable ) as input information for each candidate event to determine the signal yields .",
    "resonance masses ( @xmath102 and vector resonances ) and helicity angle of the vector meson are also used as input information in the fit where applicable . in each of these",
    "fits the likelihood of the event is parameterized by the sum of probabilities for all relevant signal and background hypotheses , with relative weights determined by maximizing the likelihood function ( @xmath116 ) .",
    "the probability of a particular hypothesis is calculated as a product of the probability density functions ( pdfs ) for each of the input variables .",
    "further details about the likelihood fit can be found in ref .",
    "the parameters for the pdfs are determined from independent data and high - statistics monte - carlo samples .",
    "we estimate a systematic error on the fitted yield by varying the pdfs used in the fit within their uncertainties .",
    "these uncertainties are dominated by the limited statistics in the independent data samples we used to determine the pdfs .",
    "the systematic errors on the measured branching fractions are obtained by adding this fit systematic in quadrature with the systematic error on the efficiency .    in decay modes for which we do not see statistically significant yields , we calculate @xmath117  confidence level ( c.l . )",
    "upper limit yields by integrating the likelihood function @xmath118 where @xmath119 is the maximum @xmath116  at fixed @xmath120  to conservatively account for possible correlations among the free parameters in the fit .",
    "we then increase upper limit yields by their systematic errors and reduce detection efficiencies by their systematic errors to calculate branching fraction upper limits given in table i and iv .",
    "given the enormous number of results to summarize in this section , we choose to show figures only for those decay modes for which we observe statistically significant yields , and no branching fraction measurements have previously been published .",
    "additional figures for preliminary updates on previously published branching fraction measurements can be found elsewhere .",
    "@xcite    the figures we show are contour plots of @xmath121 for the ml fit as well as projection plots for some of the fit inputs .",
    "the curves in the contour plots represent the @xmath122 contours , which correspond to the increase in @xmath121 by @xmath123 .",
    "contour plots do not have systematic errors included .",
    "the statistical significance of a given signal yield is determined by repeating the fit with the signal yield fixed to be zero and recording the change in @xmath121 . for the projection plots we apply additional cuts on all variables used in the fit except the one displayed .",
    "these additional cuts suppress backgrounds by an order of magnitude at signal efficiencies of roughly @xmath124 . overlaid on these plots",

    "[ cols=\"<,<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab : pv ]",
    "let us start by summarizing some of the more striking features seen in the data .",
    "first of all , we see no evidence for @xmath132 decays in either @xmath45 or @xmath46 .",
    "such decays would proceed either via highly suppressed @xmath133exchange ( e.g. @xmath134 ) and @xmath135 penguin diagrams ( e.g. @xmath136 , @xmath137 ) or via final state rescattering ( fsi ) . given that our upper limits for some of these decays are an order of magnitude smaller than at least some of the branching fractions we measure it seems fair to neglect fsi when trying to understand the dominant contributions to charmless hadronic @xmath0 decays .",
    "second , we see no evidence for @xmath138 decays while we observe both @xmath34 as well as @xmath139 decays .",
    "we try to make sense out of this in section  [ ss - model - pp ] in the context of isospin and factorization .",
    "third , we are so far unable to measure the branching fraction for any of the @xmath140 decay modes , despite the fact that we have measured @xmath139 and @xmath34 , and at least one of the @xmath141 decay modes .",
    "this is in full agreement with factorization predictions .",
    "factorization predicts destructive ( constructive ) interference between penguin operators of opposite chirality for @xmath140 ( @xmath34 ) , leading to a rather small ( large ) penguin contribution in these decays .",
    "in addition , factorization and cvc predict that only the left - handed penguin operator contributes in @xmath142 .",
    "destructive interference of penguin operators is therefore not expected in this decay mode .",
    "fourth , we want to note that the measured ratio @xmath143 is much smaller than naively expected . in @xmath139",
    "decays the @xmath144 can either come from the upper or lower vertex , and it is generally believed that upper vertex @xmath144 production clearly dominates due to favorable form factors as well as decay constants .",
    "in addition , @xmath145 is further suppressed by a factor two because only the @xmath146 part of the @xmath147 wave function contributes .",
    "the present cleo measurement of @xmath148 is the sum of upper and lower vertex @xmath144 production .",
    "it is therefore rather surprising that the measured @xmath149 is not significantly larger than two .",
    "measurements of @xmath150 as well as a flavor tagged measurement of @xmath151 would help to clarify the situation in @xmath139 decays .",
    "it remains to be seen whether or not such measurements are within reach using the full cleo data set",
    ".    finally , maybe the most striking observation in our data are the large branching fractions measured for charged as well as neutral @xmath0 decays to @xmath152 . violation of a sum - rule proposed by lipkin  @xcite seems to indicate that a significant flavor singlet contribution is needed to explain these rates .",
    "the literature is full  @xcite of attempts to explain this apparent discrepancy , the most interesting of which is the suggestion that r - parity violating couplings may explain the large @xmath152 as well as the stringent limit on @xmath153  @xcite .",
    "the latter is particularly amusing as one of the relevant couplings ( @xmath154 ) would also be present in @xmath155mixing  @xcite and could therefore lead to a different value for @xmath24 as inferred from @xmath34 decays and the limit on @xmath156 in the context of the usual analysis of the @xmath157 plane  @xcite .",
    "most theoretical predictions lead us to expect a branching fraction for @xmath25 at a level of @xmath159 .",
    "@xcite instead , the central value and 90@xmath56 confidence level upper limit presented here are @xmath160 and @xmath161 . with results like this",
    "a natural question to ask is `` _ how small can @xmath162 be ? _ '' .",
    "let us start our answer by describing a data based factorization prediction . assuming factorization , and neglecting w - exchange , penguin annihilation , and electroweak penguin diagrams one may expect the following expressions for the decay amplitudes :  @xcite    @xmath163    superscripts @xmath164 indicate the charge of the final state pions , and @xmath165 stand for external and internal w - emission , and gluonic penguin diagrams respectively ( fig .",
    "1(a ) , fig .",
    "1(c ) , and fig .",
    "1(b ) ) .",
    "we can arrive at `` data based factorization estimates '' of these amplitudes if we identify @xmath166 and use @xmath167 from measurements in @xmath168 decays  @xcite .",
    "we then estimate @xmath169 using factorization and the cleo measurement @xmath170  @xcite as follows :    @xmath171    the dominant error here is due to the spread among a variety of theoretical models for the @xmath172 dependence of the form factor  @xcite .",
    "we do not assign any error due to a possible breakdown of the factorization hypothesis . throughout this paper",
    "we express the absolute size of amplitudes in units of @xmath173 .",
    "the decay @xmath174 has three down type quarks in the final state .",
    "inspection of figure 1 shows that this final state can only be reached via penguin diagrams , or final state rescattering .",
    "furthermore , the electroweak penguin contribution to this decay is color suppressed , rather than the color allowed one shown in figure 1(d ) .",
    "it is therefore reasonable to estimate @xmath175 from the measured @xmath176 corrected by ckm and su(3 ) breaking factors .    using these numbers we arrive at @xmath177 .",
    "this leads to the factorization predictions @xmath178 , @xmath179 , and @xmath180 few @xmath181 .",
    "the last of these three estimates is not very meaningful given the errors on the quantities that enter .",
    "we assume maximum destructive interference ( @xmath182 ) .",
    "ignoring the penguin contribution ( i.e. @xmath183 ) leads to a prediction of @xmath184 .",
    "as an aside , we can calculate @xmath185 .",
    "this means that cp violating rate asymmetries as large as @xmath124 are in principle possible for decays like @xmath107 if the relevant weak and strong phases are close to @xmath186 .",
    "in addition to these factorization estimates , it is quite illustrative to look at the isospin decomposition of @xmath158 :  @xcite    @xmath187    here the subscripts @xmath188 indicate the two different isospin amplitudes .",
    "note that only the @xmath189 amplitude has any contribution from @xmath135 penguins , whereas the @xmath190 amplitude is a pure @xmath9 transition .",
    "we indicate this by making the dependence on weak ( @xmath191 ) and strong interaction phases ( @xmath192 ) explicit .. ] using the factorization estimates above , it is easy to show that @xmath193 , and @xmath194 are of the same order of magnitude .",
    "equation  [ eq : isoamp ] shows that @xmath195 can be estimated without making any assumptions about strong or weak phases .",
    "however very little can be said about the relative size of @xmath196 versus @xmath25 without making such assumptions about relative phases .",
    "common prejudice assumes @xmath197 and therefore @xmath198 due to the destructive interference between @xmath190 and @xmath189 in @xmath196 .",
    "however , as we allow for @xmath199 to increase towards @xmath200 we not only decrease ( increase ) @xmath201 but also increase the size of the `` penguin pollution '' in any future attempt of measuring @xmath202 via time dependent cp violation in @xmath25 .",
    "we are thus in the amusing situation that we would like @xmath196 to be large to make the gronau , london isospin decomposition  @xcite experimentally feasible .",
    "though at the same time , we can only hope for @xmath203 ( i.e. vanishingly small @xmath196 ) to avoid destructive interference between the two @xmath9 pieces in the amplitude for @xmath204 .",
    "we conclude that our present data is still consistent with factorization predictions for @xmath25 .",
    "however , @xmath25 could be significantly smaller than predicted by factorization if the strong interaction phase between isospin amplitudes is non - zero .",
    "as previously mentioned , the ratio @xmath33  @xcite , may be used to constrain @xmath205 if @xmath206 .",
    "our measurement of this ratio is @xmath207 .",
    "the relevant equation for bounding @xmath205 out of the paper by neubert and rosner  @xcite is :    @xmath208    the parameter @xmath209 is defined in terms of experimentally measurable quantities below .",
    "it is essentially given by the ratio of @xmath9 tree and @xmath36 gluonic penguin amplitudes .",
    "the @xmath210 terms were shown to be small in ref .",
    "@xcite . here",
    ", @xmath211 is the theoretically calculated contribution from electroweak penguin operators  @xcite .    the dominant uncertainty in equation  [ eq : eq1 ] is the unknown strong phase @xmath212 .",
    "taking the extreme values of @xmath213 and @xmath200 for this phase we thus arrive at an excluded region for @xmath205 rather than an actual measurement . to be conservative",
    ", one may choose values for @xmath214 such as to minimize this excluded region :    @xmath215    the structure of this is obviously to exclude values for @xmath205 near @xmath216 if @xmath217 .",
    "the size of the exclusion region is determined by the central value of @xmath218 as well as its error .",
    "the variable @xmath218 defined here is given in terms of measurable quantities up to small uncertainties due to non - factorizable su(3 ) breaking :    @xmath219    the two different values for @xmath220 are obtained using either the most likely value for @xmath221 based on the preliminary cleo results ( including statistical and systematic errors added in quadrature ) , or a weighted average of the latter with theoretical predictions based on factorization  @xcite .",
    "when calculating @xmath218 from these numbers we additionaly increase @xmath220 to conservatively account for theoretical uncertainties due to non - factorizable su(3 ) breaking ( @xmath222 rather than the experimental value of @xmath223 ) .",
    "the resulting values for @xmath218 are @xmath224 and @xmath225 respectively for the two different values for @xmath220 . in the following",
    "we will use @xmath226 .",
    "a number of comments are in order at this point .",
    "first , the central value for @xmath218 leads to a physical value for @xmath205 via equation  [ eq : eq1 ] only if the strong phase @xmath227 . in that case",
    ", the measured @xmath218 then prefers rather large values of @xmath228 .",
    "such values of @xmath24 are generally not the favored ones as they would tend to imply @xmath229 mixing to be smaller than the present limits and/or @xmath230 to be at the large end of the generally assumed range . it was pointed out by he , hou , and yang  @xcite that a number of other charmless hadronic @xmath0 decay results from cleo also suggest @xmath231 .",
    "second , only @xmath232 of a gaussian with mean @xmath233 and @xmath234 ly within the physically allowed region for @xmath205 . calculating a bound in this case is nt all that meaningful .",
    "instead one may consider @xmath235 to be ruled out at @xmath236 confidence level . using the usual procedure of calculating one - sided confidence levels based on the area inside the physical region only , results in the bound @xmath237 confidence level .",
    "third , the experimental errors on @xmath218 are large , roughly 1/4 of the physically allowed region total .",
    "it is fair to say that the only reason why we may deduce a non - zero exclusion region for @xmath205 from present measurements is because our present central value for @xmath218 indicates a prefered value for @xmath238 that is far away from @xmath216 .",
    "this is in contrast to some of the recent analyses of the @xmath239 plane  @xcite which tend to favor @xmath240 .",
    "in summary , we have measured branching fractions for three of the four exclusive @xmath34 decays , as well as the two @xmath129 decays , while only upper limits could be established for all other @xmath0 decays to two pseudo - scalar mesons .",
    "in addition , we have observed two of the four @xmath139 decays , as well as one of the four @xmath241 decays .",
    "we do not observe significant yields for @xmath0 decays to @xmath242 , @xmath243 , @xmath244 or @xmath153 .",
    "in addition , the neubert - rosner bound derived from present cleo data on charmless hadronic @xmath0 decays indicates @xmath245 confidence level .",
    "this is in slight disagreement with some of the more aggressive analyses of the @xmath246 plane found in the literature which prefer larger values of @xmath205 .",
