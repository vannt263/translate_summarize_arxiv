    "<S> in this paper the two - photon interactions at high energies are investigated considering different approaches for the qcd dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we calculate the @xmath0 total cross section in different theoretical approches and present a comparison among the predictions of the bfkl dynamics at leading and next - to - leading order with those from saturation physics . </S>",
    "<S> we analyze the possibility that the future linear colliders could discriminate between these different approaches .    </S>",
    "<S> the high energy limit of the perturbative qcd is characterized by a center - of - mass which is much larger than the hard scales present in the problem . </S>",
    "<S> the simplest process where this limit can be studied is the high energy scattering between two heavy quark - antiquark states , _ </S>",
    "<S> i.e. _ the onium - onium scattering . for a sufficiently heavy onium state , </S>",
    "<S> high energy scattering is a perturbative process since the onium radius gives the essential scale at which the running coupling @xmath1 is evaluated . in the dipole picture @xcite , the heavy quark - antiquark pair and the soft gluons in the limit of large number of colors @xmath2 are viewed as a collection of color dipoles . in this case , the cross section can be understood as a product of the number of dipoles in one onium state , the number of dipoles in the other onium state and the basic cross section for dipole - dipole scattering due to two - gluon exchange . at leading order ( lo ) , the cross section grows rapidly with the energy ( @xmath3 , where @xmath4 and @xmath5 ) because the lo bfkl equation @xcite predicts that the number of dipoles in the light cone wave function grows rapidly with the energy . </S>",
    "<S> several shortcomings are present in this calculation . </S>",
    "<S> firstly , in the leading order calculation the energy scale is arbitrary , which implies that the absolute value to the total cross section is therefore not predictable . </S>",
    "<S> secondly , @xmath1 is not running at lo bfkl . </S>",
    "<S> finally , the power growth with energy violates @xmath6-channel unitarity at large rapidities . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , new physical effects should modify the lo bfkl equation at very large @xmath6 , making the resulting amplitude unitary .    a theoretical possibility to modify this behavior in a way consistent with the unitarity is the idea of parton saturation @xcite , where non - linear effects associated to high parton density are taken into account . </S>",
    "<S> the basic idea is that when the parton density increases ( and the scattering amplitude tends to the unitarity limit ) , the linear description present in the bfkl equation breaks down and one enters the saturation regime , where the dynamics is described by a nonlinear evolution equation and the parton densities saturate @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the transition line between the linear and nonlinear regimes is characterized by the saturation scale @xmath7 , which is energy dependent and sets the critical transverse size for the unitarization of the cross sections . </S>",
    "<S> the saturation approach implies that the onium - onium cross section still grows with the energy , but the rise is slower than @xmath8 @xcite . in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , mueller has argued that these corrections become important at the values of rapidity of the order of @xmath9 .    </S>",
    "<S> another possible solution , which is expected to diminishes the energy growth of the total cross section , is the calculation of higher order corrections to the bfkl equation . </S>",
    "<S> after an effort of ten years , the next - to - leading order ( nlo ) corrections were obtained @xcite and the spurious singularities were solved considering renormalization - group improved regularizations ( for a review on nlo bfkl corrections , see e.g. ref . @xcite and references therein ) . in particular , in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite the brodsky - lepage - mackenzie ( blm ) optimal scale setting procedure @xcite was used to eliminate the renormalization scale ambiguity present in the @xmath10-scheme calculations . </S>",
    "<S> the nlo bfkl predictions , as improved by the blm scale setting , yields @xmath11 . in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite the authors have shown that due to the running coupling effects the nlo corrections become important at the rapidities of the order of @xmath12 . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , in principle , one has @xmath13 at parametrically small @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> that implies that the center of mass energy at which the saturation effects become important is much smaller than the energy at which the nlo corrections start playing an important role . </S>",
    "<S> however , it still is an open question , since it only can be definitively established once next - to - leading - logarithmic contributions are fully computed for the non - linear evolution equations present in the saturation approaches . </S>",
    "<S> one possibility to check this assumption is the analysis of the energy dependence of the onium - onium cross section , which could disentangle the qcd dynamics .    </S>",
    "<S> a reaction which is analogous to the process of scattering of two onia discussed above is the off - shell photon scattering at high energy in @xmath14 colliders , where the photons are produced from the leptons beams by bremsstrahlung ( for a review see , e.g. , ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) . in these two - photon reactions , </S>",
    "<S> the photon virtualities can be made large enough to ensure the applicability of the perturbative methods or can be varied in order to test the transition between the soft and hard regimes of the qcd dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> from the view of the bfkl approach , there are several calculations using the leading logarithmic approximation @xcite and considering some of the next - to - leading corrections to the total cross section @xmath0 process @xcite . in particular </S>",
    "<S> , the stable next - to - leading order program relying on the blm optimal scale setting @xcite has produced good results with opal and l3 data at lep2 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> on the other hand , the successful description of all inclusive and diffractive deep inelastic data at the collider hera by saturation models @xcite suggests that these effects might become important in the energy regime probed by current colliders . </S>",
    "<S> it motivated the generalization of the saturation model to two - photon interactions at high energies performed in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , which has obtained a very good description of the data on the @xmath15 total cross section , on the photon structure function at low @xmath16 and on the @xmath0 cross section . </S>",
    "<S> the formalism used in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite is based on the dipole picture @xcite , with the @xmath0 total cross sections being described by the interaction of two color dipoles , in which the virtual photons fluctuate into ( for previous analysis using the dipole picture see , e.g. , refs . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> the dipole - dipole cross section is modeled considering phenomenological models based on saturation physics . </S>",
    "<S> a current shortcoming of the saturation approaches is that the non - linear evolution equations ( bk and jimwlk ) were derived at leading order accuracy , resumming all powers of @xmath17 along with all the multiple scatterings in the target , but disregarding for instance any running coupling corrections in their kernels ( for recent efforts see , e.g. @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> another important aspect which should be emphasized is that these evolution equations contains the lo bfkl equation in the low density limit .    </S>",
    "<S> as the nlo bfkl predictions as well as the saturation one describes quite well the lep data @xcite , a current open question is if the future @xmath18 colliders will allow to discriminate between bfkl and saturation predictions . </S>",
    "<S> the main goal of this letter is to present a comparison of the ( lo and nlo ) bfkl and saturation predictions for the energy dependence of the total cross section and verify if it is possible discriminate between these approaches in the kinematical range of the future linear colliders .    </S>",
    "<S> lets start presenting the main formulas to calculate the total cross section in the bfkl formalism . </S>",
    "<S> one has that the total cross section of two unpolarized gammas with virtualities @xmath19 and @xmath20 in the lo bfkl formalism reads as follows : @xmath21   \\phi_{i}(\\nu ) \\phi_{k}(-\\nu ) \\biggl ( \\frac{s}{s_0}\\biggr)^{\\omega(q^2,\\nu ) } ,    \\label{eqn : sigma - g}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where one has used as kinematic variables the @xmath0 c.m.s . </S>",
    "<S> energy squared @xmath22 , with @xmath23 and @xmath24 being the photon momenta and the photon virtualities squared given by @xmath25 and @xmath26 . </S>",

    "<S> the high - energy asymptotics of the cross sections is determined by the highest eigenvalue , @xmath34 , of the bfkl equation @xcite : @xmath35 . at leading order </S>",
    "<S> it is rather large : @xmath36 for @xmath37 . </S>",
    "<S> on the other hand , the eigenvalue of the nlo bfkl equation at transferred momentum squared @xmath38 in the @xmath10-scheme reads @xmath39 , \\label{kernelact}\\ ] ] where @xmath40 is the function related with the lo eigenvalue , @xmath41 denotes the euler @xmath42-function , the @xmath43-variable is conformal weight parameter @xcite , @xmath2 is the number of colors , and @xmath19 is the virtuality of the reggeized gluon . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the nlo coefficient @xmath44 of eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ kernelact ] ) can be decomposed into a @xmath45-dependent and a conformal ( @xmath45-independent ) part [ @xmath46 ( for more details see ref . </S>",

    "<S> @xcite the nlo corrections as given in the @xmath10-scheme implies that the highest eigenvalue of the bfkl equation turns out to be negative and even larger than the lo contribution for @xmath51 . in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite the authors have demonstrated that this situation can be improved evaluating the intercept of the bfkl pomeron at nlo using the blm scale setting within non - abelian physical schemes , such as the momentum space subtraction ( mom ) scheme . in this case one </S>",

    "<S> the nlo value for the intercept of the bfkl pomeron has a very weak dependence on the virtuality @xmath63 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , it implies that @xmath64 . as emphasized before , using this approach it is possible to describe the opal and l3 data at lep2 @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> another alternative to cure the highly unstable perturbative expansion of the bfkl kernel was proposed in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , who realized that the large nlo corrections emerge from the collinearly enhanced physical contributions . </S>",
    "<S> a method , the @xmath65-expansion , was then developed to resum collinear effects at all orders in a sistematic way . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting rg improved bfkl equation was consistent with renormalization group requirements through matching to the dglap limit and resummation of spurious poles . in this approach </S>",
    "<S> the kernel is positive in a much larger region which includes the experimentally accessible one . </S>",
    "<S> based on this approach , but with a fixed coupling , khoze , martin , ryskin and stirling ( kmrs ) @xcite proposed recently a simpler model for the nlo corrected lo kernel ( see ref . </S>",

    "<S> this model interpolates between the small and large dipole configurations , providing color transparency behavior , @xmath114 , at @xmath115 and constant behavior at large dipole separations @xmath116 . </S>",
    "<S> the physical scale which characterizes the transition between the dilute and saturated system is denoted saturation scale , @xmath117 , which is energy dependent . in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite three different scenarios for @xmath110 has been considered , with the dipole - dipole cross section presenting in all cases the color transparency property ( @xmath118 for @xmath119 or @xmath120 ) and saturation ( @xmath121 ) for large size dipoles . </S>",
    "<S> we quote also ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite for further analytical studies in the role played by different choices for the effective radius . in </S>",
    "<S> what follows , we use the model i from @xcite , where @xmath122 , which is favored by the @xmath0 and @xmath123 data . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , in order to extend the dipole model to large @xmath90 it is necessary to taken into account threshold correction factors which constrain that the cross section vanish when @xmath124 as a power of @xmath125 . as in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , we multiply the dipole - dipole cross section by the factor @xmath126 . a comment is in order here . </S>",
    "<S> one shortcoming of the gbw model is that it does not contain the correct dglap limit at large virtualities . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , we may expect that its predictions are only valid at small values of the photon virtualities . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , in what follows we only consider photon virtualities up to 15 gev@xmath127 .     </S>",
    "<S> cross section considering distinct approaches for the qcd dynamics ( @xmath128 gev@xmath127 ) . ]    in what follows we present our results for the @xmath0 total hadronic cross section . </S>",
    "<S> the quark - box contribution is not included in our calculations . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , as the lo impact factors are @xmath1 dependent , we also estimate the effect in our predictions of a running coupling constant . following ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite we assume in the lo calculation that @xmath129 . </S>",
    "<S> this same value is used in the impact factors in the nlo bfkl calculations . </S>",
    "<S> the factor scaling the energy @xmath6 in the ressumed logarithms , @xmath30 , is a free parameter not predicted by the theory . </S>",
    "<S> here we assume that @xmath130 , where @xmath131 , and that @xmath63 is the scale of @xmath1 , when the running is considered .    </S>",
    "<S> let us proceed in comparing the different predictions for the total @xmath132 cross section as a function of the variable @xmath133 . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , for @xmath134 about 10 - 11 , the corresponding @xmath132 center of mass energy reaches 1 tev , whereas for @xmath135 one has @xmath136 gev . as a first analysis , in fig [ fig1 ] we consider photons sharing equal virtualities , @xmath128 gev@xmath127 . the lo bfkl result ( double dashed - dot line ) presents a steep increasing as a consequence of the large effective intercept , @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> clearly , this behavior is ruled out by the l3/opal experimental data at high energies @xcite . for the nlo bfkl approach , </S>",
    "<S> the blm scheme and kmrs approach are considered . </S>",
    "<S> we have tested the effect of running coupling constant within the impact factors and verified that the magnitude of the effect is similar in both cases . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , in what follows we only present the predictions considering the running coupling for the blm scheme . </S>",
    "<S> the fixed @xmath137 result is labeled by dashed line , whereas the running coupling calculation is the double dot - dashed curve . </S>",
    "<S> the effect reaches 10% in the overall normalization at high energies in the case of equal photon virtualities and the energy behavior seems to be unchanged . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , we have that the kmrs prediction ( dot - dashed line ) is similar to the blm one at this virtuality . </S>",
    "<S> finally , the solid curve shows the tkm model , which describe the low energy l3/opal data ( @xmath138 ) .    </S>",
    "<S> [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     the saturation model and the nlo bfkl approach have distinct energy behaviors . </S>",
    "<S> the underlying dynamics could be disentangled whether a sufficiently large energy collider to be available . for instance , at @xmath139 gev the deviation is a factor 2 and reaches a factor 3 at @xmath140 tev . </S>",
    "<S> the nlo bfkl has a flatter energy growth in contrast with the saturation model . </S>",
    "<S> roughly , at high energies one has @xmath141 for the tkm model and @xmath142 for nlo bfkl with fixed coupling constant in impact factor . </S>",
    "<S> an important remark is that although the energy growth of the total cross section predicted by the bfkl equation is slower when the nlo corrections are included , its solution still present the diffusion property , i.e. the random walk in the transverse momentum . as the mean width of this random walk increases as @xmath143 , we have that at large @xmath6 the solution eventually enters into the non - perturbative region . </S>",
    "<S> thus , independently how large are the transverse scales of the scattering objects , there is always an energy beyond which perturbative theory loses its predictive power .    in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2 ] , different configurations for photon virtualities are taken into account : ( a ) the assymetric case @xmath144 and @xmath145 gev@xmath127 and ( b ) the symmetric case @xmath146 gev@xmath127 with a somewhat larger virtuality . in both cases the deviations are stronger than the previous analysis . at @xmath147 the saturation model can reach a factor 6 above the nlo bfkl ( blm ) in plot ( a ) and a factor 7 in plot ( b ) . </S>",
    "<S> notice the small effect of running coupling constant in nlo bfkl when at last one of virtualities is large . </S>",
    "<S> the effective power for the saturation model has increased in such way that @xmath148 and for the nlo bfkl ( blm ) it remains unchanged . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the difference between the bfkl nlo ( blm ) and tkm predictions grows with @xmath63 . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , the virtuality dependence obtained using the kmrs approach is distinct , which implies a steeper energy dependence for the nlo bfkl ( kmrs ) prediction . in this case </S>",
    "<S> , we have that at @xmath147 the saturation model can reach a factor 2.5 above the nlo bfkl ( kmrs ) in plot ( a ) and a factor 3 in plot ( b ) . concerning the saturation model , </S>",
    "<S> we have also checked that the main contribution comes from the small size dipole configurations where @xmath149 and saturation becomes incleasingly important at @xmath150 tev . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , these effects must can be strong for the photon structure funtion , @xmath151 , where one of photons is real .    as a conclusion </S>",
    "<S> , the results presented here will be important at possible future @xmath152 colliders ( tesla , clic ) , where the available energies might reach 500 gev or even 1 tev . </S>",
    "<S> in that regime the underlying dynamics could be disentangled . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> it is interesting the comparison of the present results with those ones using bfkl approach corrected by sub - leading effects @xcite ( where the energy behavior seems to be similar to tkm model ) and regge phenomenology for @xmath132 interactions as the two - pomeron models @xcite . </S>"
