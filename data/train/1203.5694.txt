    "one of the most serious obstacles confronting particle physics is the extreme practical difficulty of probing the physics of the planck scale .",
    "one way planck - scale physics might be probed is by means of proton decay @xcite .",
    "there are general arguments that quantum gravity should violate global quantum numbers , such as baryon number ( @xmath8 ) and lepton number ( @xmath9 ) .",
    "therefore , proton decay should happen as a consequence of planck - scale physics . of course",
    ", proton decay could also happen as a result of grand unification , and grand unification is an extremely well - motivated idea .",
    "nevertheless , it is not absolutely certain that the idea of grand unification is correct , and even if it is , there could be other contributions to proton decay .",
    "therefore , if proton decay is observed , we should keep an open mind about what is causing it . as we shall see below ,",
    "if it is coming from planck - scale physics certain kinds of colored bosons should exist whose mass should be less than @xmath10 gev and very likely much less and within reach of accelerators , and certain decay modes of the proton should be seen . moreover , there would be a relation between the kind of light colored bosons and the proton decay modes .    at first glance , it would seem hopeless to see proton decay caused by planck - scale physics .",
    "if the operators violating baryon number were dimension-6 , with a suppression factor of order @xmath11 , the proton - decay rate would be much too small to be seen in the foreseeable future , or perhaps ever",
    ". on the other hand , if the operators were dimension-4 , proton decay would typically be too fast .",
    "so it is dimension-5 @xmath8-violating operators suppressed by a single power of @xmath12 that are of interest in this regard .",
    "no such operators can be constructed from standard model ( sm ) fields alone , but they can be if non - standard model fields exist .",
    "one possibility , already explored in @xcite , is that such operators may arise in the context of low - energy supersymmetry . in this paper",
    "we shall show that even in much more modest extensions of the standard model proton - decay amplitudes can arise at @xmath2 . in particular",
    ", we shall show that adding just a single type of non - sm field ( specifically , colored bosons , as noted above ) allows this possibility .",
    "we shall classify all such cases and the resulting effective @xmath8-violating operators , somewhat in the spirit of the classic analysis of weinberg and of wilczek and zee @xcite .",
    "let us call the single new field added to the standard model @xmath13 . if @xmath13 has both dim-5 @xmath8-violating couplings and also renormalizable couplings to sm fields , then integrating it out will yield effective @xmath8-violating operators involving only sm fields that are suppressed by @xmath14 , if @xmath13 is a boson .",
    "thus , as we will show later , for there to be observable proton decay , @xmath15 would have to be less than about @xmath10 gev , and probably even lighter , since there are likely to be small dimensionless couplings involved .",
    "we shall call such fields  light \" in what follows .",
    "a dim-5 operator would have to be either ( i ) a product of five boson fields or derivatives , or ( ii ) a fermion bilinear times a product of two boson fields or derivatives .",
    "suppose @xmath13 were a fermion field",
    ". then the only light boson would be the sm higgs doublet @xmath16 , and therefore no operator of type ( i ) would exist . and for type ( ii ) , the fermion bilinear would have to be a color - singlet , so that by assigning @xmath17 to all color - triplet fermions and @xmath18 and to all color anti - triplet fermions @xmath8 would be conserved .",
    "consequently , in order to violate @xmath8 at dim-5 , @xmath13 has to be a boson field .",
    "moreover , it is not difficult to see from reasoning similar to the above that it must be a color non - singlet .",
    "there are only ten color non - singlet scalars that can couple renormalizability to the fermions of the standard model .",
    "the possibilities are listed in table i.    in the second column of table i , we show all the dim-4 couplings of @xmath13 and @xmath19 to the sm fermions",
    ". the left - handed fermions of the standard model are denoted in table i and throughout this paper by @xmath20 , @xmath9 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , and @xmath23 . in certain cases ,",
    "not all the dim-4 yukawa couplings permitted by the gauge symmetries of the standard model can be present in the lagrangian without allowing catastrophic proton decay ( i.e. proton decay that is not suppressed by @xmath24 , but only by @xmath25 ) .",
    "these cases are therefore divided in table i into subcases a and b ( denoted by a subscript in column 1 ) , depending on which dim-4 operators are present . those not present must be forbidden by some symmetry beyond the sm gauge group .    in column 3 of table",
    "i , we show those dim-5 couplings of @xmath13 and @xmath19 to the sm fermions that violate baryon number and are linear in @xmath13 or @xmath19 .",
    "( an operator quadratic in @xmath13 would lead to a proton - decay rate of order @xmath26 because of the need to integrate out two @xmath13 bosons instead of one . ) in the last column of table i , we show the dim-7 four - fermion , @xmath0 operators that arise from integrating out the @xmath13 field .",
    "a general analysis of such dim-7 operators was carried out in @xcite . in the operators of table i , the fermions in parentheses",
    "are contracted into lorentz scalars ; the dots represent a contraction of @xmath27 doublets into singlets ; and the circles represent the contraction of @xmath27 doublets into triplets .",
    "a noteworthy feature of all the cases is that @xmath3 is conserved rather than @xmath28 .",
    "( @xmath3 conserving baryon decay was analyzed in the context of @xmath29-parity violating supersymmetric models by vissani in @xcite and more recently by babu and mohapatra in a large class of gut models @xcite . )",
    "consequently , the dominant proton decay decay modes are @xmath4 , @xmath30 , where @xmath6 or @xmath7 . of course",
    ", in practice one can not tell in the difference between the @xmath31 ( or @xmath32 ) , which occur in these models , and @xmath33 ( or @xmath34 ) , which arise in typical grand unified theories(guts ) .",
    "however , in guts these are accompanied by decay modes with positively charged anti - leptons , whereas in models we are looking at they are not . in table",
    "i , the operators that cause @xmath4 are called type ( a ) , while those that cause @xmath5 are called type ( b ) . for neutron decay",
    "the dominant modes are @xmath32 for type ( a ) , and @xmath35 for type ( b ) .",
    "suppose that we denote by @xmath36 and @xmath37 the coefficients of the dim-4 and dim-5 operators shown in the second and third columns of table i. these are matrices in flavor space , and the indices @xmath38 denote the families of the fermions in these operators . since we do nt know the flavor dependence of these matrices , for the purpose of making rough estimates let us denote the typical value of these couplings to the fermions of the first and second families simply by @xmath39 and @xmath40 , without indices .",
    "then the effective four - fermion @xmath41 operators in the last column of table i have coefficients of the form @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is the vacuum expectation value of the standard model higgs field @xmath16 . a two - body nucleon decay mode produced by such operators",
    "would therefore typically have a partial rate of order          by analogy with the yukawa couplings of the standard model higgs field , it is plausible that the coefficients @xmath39 and @xmath48 to the first and second families could be of order @xmath49 to @xmath50 , so that the @xmath13 bosons in these models could be in range of detection at accelerators .",
    "such light , colored bosons raise the question of the whether they would be in conflict with bounds on flavor - changing neutral current ( fcnc ) processes such as @xmath51 mixing and @xmath52 .",
    "the contribution of the @xmath13 scalars through box diagrams to the coefficients of @xmath53 operators would be of order @xmath54 . to avoid excessive cp violation in @xmath55 system",
    ", this must be less than about @xmath56 .",
    "this gives @xmath57 gev ) . for models 1 and 5 , where @xmath13 is a leptoquark ,",
    "one - loop diagrams involving virtual @xmath13 bosons would typically contribute to @xmath58 .",
    "the present limits for this process would require @xmath59 gev ) .",
    "more stringent limits on these leptoquark masses come from @xmath60 .",
    "present limits for this would give @xmath61 gev ) .",
    "of course , these are rough estimates . special patterns of flavor dependence of the matrices @xmath36 and @xmath62 could either relax or strengthen these limits significantly .    it is apparent that these models could allow observable nucleon decay rates , while satisfying limits from fcnc processes . for instance , if @xmath63 tev , the fcnc limits would be satisfied if @xmath64 , while observable two - body nucleon decay could occur if @xmath65 . similarly ,",
    "if @xmath66 tev , then the fcnc limits would require @xmath67 , while observable two - body proton decay could occur for @xmath68 .    because one does not know _ a priori _ the flavor dependence of the coefficients @xmath39 and @xmath48",
    ", one can not say for nucleon decay whether pion or kaon modes will be dominant , and whether electron or muon modes will be .",
    "all else being equal , phase space would lead one to expect that for proton decay the decay modes with neutrinos , which are two - body , would dominate over the decay modes with charged - leptons , which are three - body .",
    "however , in models 2 and 5 , different operators produce the neutrino and charged lepton modes .",
    "for example , in model 2 the neutrino modes come from the dim-5 operator @xmath69 , whereas the charged lepton modes come from the dim-5 operator @xmath70 .",
    "and one does not know _ a priori _ which of these operators has larger coefficients . in models 1 and 4 , on the other hand , the operators @xmath71 and @xmath72 , contribute to both neutrino and charged lepton decay modes of the proton .",
    "so the former should predominate because of phase space . in model 3 ,",
    "only neutrino modes are produced by the operators @xmath73 and @xmath74 .",
    "it is interesting to compare the kinds of non - supersymmetric models discussed here with models based on low - energy supersymmetry that can also give proton - decay amplitudes of order @xmath75 , as discussed in @xcite .",
    "there are several differences .",
    "first , one notes that in @xcite the baryon - number - violating operators are constructed out of chiral superfields that appear in the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) . while the first three cases we consider in table ii ( @xmath76 , @xmath77 , and @xmath78 ) correspond to fields that exist in the mssm , the other two cases do not .",
    "second , one sees that even in the cases where our @xmath13 field corresponds to a field of the mssm , many of the dim-5 @xmath0 operators in table i , and in particular those containing @xmath19 , have no analogue in the mssm .",
    "for example , in the case @xmath79 , there are the operators @xmath80 and @xmath81 . as far as gauge quantum numbers go",
    ", these would correspond to mssm operators of the form @xmath82 and @xmath83 .",
    "neither of these is an @xmath84 term , however , and therefore they can not appear in an effective superpotential .",
    "the same is true of the operators @xmath73 , @xmath71 , and @xmath72 in the last column of table i. the most dramatic difference is that in the models discussed here , proton decay conserves @xmath3 rather than @xmath28 as in the supersymmetric models of @xcite .",
    "this would not give a discernible difference for neutrino modes , since one can not tell the difference in practice between , for example , @xmath85 ( which arises in the mssm ) and @xmath86 ( which arises in the present models ) .",
    "in the mssm , however , the anti - neutrino modes would be accompanied by modes with positively charged anti - leptons , which would not appear in the planck - scale proton decay models discussed here .    as we are examining these questions  from the bottom up \" , we do not attempt to explain why the colored bosons we have called @xmath13 should be light compared to the planck scale .",
    "it is , however , interesting that if such bosons are lighter than about @xmath10 gev , they may allow a direct window onto physics at the planck scale .",
