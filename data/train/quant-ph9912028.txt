    "the experimental realization of bose - einstein condensation in dilute atomic systems @xcite has opened up exciting new directions of research in atomic , molecular and optical physics .",
    "recent developments of special interest in the context of the present paper include the first experimental demonstration of the four - wave mixing of de broglie waves in a sodium condensate @xcite , the generation of dark solitons by optically imposing a phase shift on a condensate wave function @xcite , the realization of several types of atom lasers @xcite , and , most importantly perhaps , the demonstration of superradiant rayleigh scattering in a condensate @xcite .",
    "this latter experiment is particularly significant in that it is the first example of a four - wave mixing process involving dynamically two optical waves and two atomic matter waves .    in recent work @xcite",
    ", we initiated a study of the mutual coherence between optical and matter waves , discussing possible measurement schemes , and illustrating our results in a simple example .",
    "the goal of the present paper is to extend these results to the study of higher - order coherence functions .",
    "this study is motivated by several reasons : first , it is well established in optics that higher - order detection schemes are required to test certain aspects of the nonlocal predictions of quantum mechanics .",
    "@xcite it would be useful to carry out similar experiments with massive particles .",
    "second , the generation of a quantum entanglement between optical and matter waves is of much interest in applications such as the optical manipulation and control of schrdinger fields . in particular ,",
    "a number of sophisticated techniques have been developed to generate optical waves of prescribed statistical properties .",
    "it would be desirable to develop methods to transfer them to matter waves , while possibly amplifying them in the process .",
    "this might for example open up the way to the generation of atomic fock states of known atomic number , which are of great potential interest in matter - wave interferometry . @xcite more generally , the interplay between maxwell and schrdinger waves is the cornerstone of most potential applications of atom optics , from situations such as lenses , gratings and mirrors where light plays a passive role to situations of dynamical coupling , including matter - wave amplifiers @xcite and ultra - sensitive atom - optical detectors .",
    "these developments require one to characterize not just the statistical properties of the optical and matter fields individually , but also their cross - coherence properties .    the general detection scheme that we consider consists of one or more standard photodetectors for the optical field , together with matter - wave detectors which operate by annihilating an atom via photoionization . as a result ,",
    "electrons and ions are produced , and the resulting electron current is measured .",
    "the atomic detection , while on the surface similar to photodection , is therefore fundamentally different in that the atoms , which are composite particles , are not so much destroyed by the detection process as transformed into a pair of two new particles .",
    "for example , if the atoms under consideration are composite bosons before detection , the resulting ions are fermions .",
    "the quantum statistics of the resulting particles is important in those situations involving exchange terms , as we discuss in detail later on .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : section ii reviews the model of joint atomic and optical detection of ref .",
    "@xcite and establishes the notation .",
    "section iii , which is the central part of the paper , discusses the kinds of correlation functions that can be detected .",
    "it accounts in detail for the quantum statistics of the ions and electrons resulting from photoionization , including the effects of particle exchange , and illustrates how different orderings can be achieved by a proper time - gating of the detectors .",
    "section iv illustrates these results in a simple atom optics example , and section v is a summary and conclusion .",
    "we consider the joint detection of the coherence properties of dynamically coupled optical and matter - wave fields , the latter one being assumed to be bosonic for concreteness . in ref .",
    "@xcite , we proposed a detection scheme that can achieve this goal .",
    "it consists of a series of standard photodetectors , which we call in the following _ maxwell detectors _ and of matter - wave _ schrdinger detectors . _",
    "the schrdinger detectors operate by tightly focussing a laser beam on the atoms , ionizing them , and measuring the resulting electron current .",
    "we describe the optical field by its electric field operator @xmath0 and the matter - wave field by the ( multicomponent ) schrdinger field operator @xmath1 , which satisfies the bosonic commutation relation @xmath2= \\delta_{\\alpha\\beta}\\delta(\\bf{r}-\\bf{r ' } ) .",

    "the dynamics of the compound system is governed by the hamiltonian @xmath6 where @xmath7 and @xmath8 describe the evolution of the light field and the matter - wave field , respectively , while @xmath9 is the interaction between these two fields , typically the electric dipole interaction .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , we considered the measurement of the lowest - order joint - correlations between the two fields . in that case , just one photodetector and one atom detector were required .",
    "in contrast , the measurement of higher - order correlations involves the use of several light and matter - wave detectors .    as in glauber s",
    "photodetection theory @xcite , the photodetectors are modeled as single two - level atoms whose excited state is in the continuum , corresponding to photoionization .",
    "the interaction of the system with @xmath10 such detectors is described as usual by the electric dipole interaction hamiltonian @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the electric dipole moment between the ground electronic state and the continuum state of the @xmath13 detector , located at the position @xmath14 .",
    "we assume for simplicity that the dipole moments are real and parallel to the field .",
    "similarly , the interaction between the matter - wave field and the @xmath15 schrdinger detectors , assumed to be point - like and at locations @xmath14 , is given by @xmath16 .",
    "\\label{e4}\\ ] ] here , @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the field operators associated with atoms in the ( ground state ) sample and the atomic continuum state @xmath19 , respectively , @xmath20 is the coupling constant proportional to the rabi frequency of the ionizing lasers of frequency @xmath21 . as pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite , the assumption of point - like detectors is justified for atomic samples at temperatures well below the recoil limit , in which case the ionizing lasers can easily be focused to a spot size much smaller than the thermal de broglie wavelength .",
    "the atoms in the schrdinger field @xmath22 are actually composite bosons which are photodissociated by the laser into an electron and an ion .",
    "hence , the creation operator @xmath23 should actually be understood as the product of two fermionic creation operators . since what is detected is the electron current , it is important to treat this property of the system properly .",
    "we proceed by expanding the continuum field @xmath24 in terms of plane waves of momentum @xmath25 as @xmath26 where @xmath27 @xmath28 and @xmath29= \\delta ( { { \\bf q}-{\\bf q}'})\\delta_{\\nu \\nu ' } , \\ ] ] the corresponding hamiltonian being @xmath30 we now decompose the atomic creation operators @xmath31 in terms of products of electron and ion creation operators . we assume for concreteness that the atoms under consideration are spin - zero particles , so that the spins of the resulting electrons and ions are opposite . as a result of the large difference between the ion and the electron masses , the kinetic energy of the system",
    "is carried almost entirely by the ion .",
    "if furthermore the photon energy is insufficient to excite the ion above its ground electronic state , we have that @xmath32 where @xmath33 are momentum - space electron wave functions .",
    "the sum appearing in this equation is over the spin states @xmath34 , and the ion and electron annihilation operators , @xmath35 and @xmath36 respectively , satisfy the fermi anticommutation relations @xmath37_+",

( [ b ] ) and ( [ e6 ] ) gives @xmath39 the schrdinger detectors measure the electron current , but are insensitive to the final state of the ions , which will therefore be summed over .",
    "the total hamiltonian describing the coupling of the system to the detectors is finally @xmath40 and the full hamiltonian including system , detectors and interaction is @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the hamiltonian of the maxwell detectors , modeled as usual as two level - atoms .",
    "the probability amplitude of exciting all detectors is given to lowest order by @xmath43-th order perturbation theory . to that order ,",
    "the probability amplitude for the transition from the initial state @xmath44 to a final state @xmath45 is given by @xmath46 where @xmath47 , and the interaction with the detectors is now expressed in the interaction picture as @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the free hamiltonian of the detectors .    when substituted into eq .",
    "( [ b1 ] ) , the interaction hamiltonian ( [ e7 ] ) yields @xmath50 terms .",
    "it is well known that for photodetectors operating by absorption , only the positive frequency part of the electric field operator contributes to the signal .",
    "a similar situation also occurs for the schrdinger detectors provided that no ion or electron is initially present , i.e. , the field @xmath51 is initially in the vacuum state .",
    "if that is the case , the only terms contributing to the detection signal are those proportional to @xmath52 , which result in the detection of normally ordered correlation functions of the schrdinger field . further neglecting terms involving multiple ionization at a single detector",
    "reduces the probability amplitude ( [ b1 ] ) to @xmath53 in this expression , @xmath54 can correspond to either the detection of a photon , or to the ionization of an atom .",
    "all permutations of such detection events such that a total of @xmath10 photodetections of the optical field and @xmath15 photoionizations of the schrdinger field take place must be included in the sum .",
    "the `` + '' superscrit refers to the familiar `` positive frequency part '' in the maxwell detectors and to the ordering of the schrdinger detectors discussed before eq .",
    "( [ b3 ] ) .",
    "hence this expression includes @xmath55 terms .",
    "since the optical and atomic field operators do not generally commute at different times , it is not possible to regroup them into just one contribution .",
    "however , it is possible to use a time - gated detection scheme @xcite to separately detect the various correlation functions of eq .",
    "( [ b3 ] ) , as we now discuss .",
    "we consider the experimental situation where the @xmath56-th detector is turned on at @xmath57 and turned off at some later time @xmath58 , so that @xmath59 becomes @xmath60.\\ ] ] where @xmath61 is the heaviside function .",
    "a given ordering of the switch - off times , for example @xmath62 results in just one term in eq .",
    "( [ b3 ] ) contributing to the counting rate.@xcite    as is the case in standard optical photodetection theory @xcite , we can safely assume that the photocurrents generated in the maxwell detectors are independent and distinguishable .",
    "however , more care must be taken when dealing with the schrdinger detectors : because the de broglie wavelength of the ultracold atoms can be very large , it is not correct in general to assume that the electrons generated by the photoionization process are distinguishable .",
    "hence , it is necessary to account for the various exchange terms arising in the detection signal @xcite .",
    "we illustrate how this work in the case of a detection scheme involving two maxwell detectors at positions @xmath63 and @xmath64 and turned off at times @xmath65 and @xmath66 , respectively , as well as two schrdinger detectors at @xmath67 and @xmath68 and closed at times @xmath69 and @xmath70 . for the time ordering @xmath71 , the only term resulting from the transition probability amplitude ( [ b3 ] ) that contributes to the counting rate turns out to be @xmath72 where we have introduced as usual a sum over a complete set of final states .",
    "note that in deriving this expression , we have factorized the expectation values into products of detector operators and of system operators correlation functions .",
    "this is appropriate in the absence of quantum entanglement between the states of the detectors and of the system to be characterized .    in order to properly account for the quantum statistics of the detector correlation function @xmath73 we reexpress it using eq .",

    "the first one , proportional to @xmath88 , is of the same nature as the expressions familiar from photodetection theory .",
    "it would take the same form in case the ionizing fields at @xmath89 and @xmath14 lead to completely distinguishable signals .",
    "the second and third terms are of different nature , resulting from the quantum statistics of the schrdinger detectors .",
    "the first of these , proportional to @xmath90 , originates in the exchange of the @xmath91 schrdinger field @xmath24 , which is bosonic .",
    "we note that the dependence of this term on the product @xmath92 rather than on an expression proportional to a fourth - order correlation function of @xmath24 , is a direct consequence of the assumption that this field is initially in a vacuum .",
    "finally , the third term , proportional to the cross - efficiency @xmath93 , involves the exchange of the electrons or of the ions _",
    "only_. physically , it accounts for the fact that the electrons do nt know their origin .",
    "this is the one term in eq .",
    "( [ b10 ] ) that depends explicitly on the fact that the composite bosons are annihilated and a pair of fermions is generated .",
    "the factor of 2 in @xmath93 results from the fact that either the electrons or the ions can be exchanged .",
    "hence , the first two terms can be thought of as being bosonic in nature , while the latter term is fermionic .",
    "we have previously mentioned that the @xmath43-th order transition probability amplitude contains @xmath55 terms .",
    "therefore @xmath94 is made of @xmath95 contributions , whose general form resembles that of expression ( [ b7 ] ) .",
    "hence , it is readily possible in principle to make measurements sensitive to both the bosonic and fermionic contributions to @xmath94 .",
    "however , if one is only interested in the electron counting rate @xmath96 then the specific ordering of @xmath97 selects just one of these contributions .",
    "in addition , since @xmath98 contains 4 partial derivatives , the fermionic contribution to eq .",
    "( [ b7 ] ) gives no contribution to the counting rate .",
    "specifically , for the time ordering @xmath99 one finds readily @xmath100 the first term in this expression is analogous to the standard fourth - order correlation function of optical coherence theory , with two of the electric fields replaced by the schrdinger field .",
    "the second term , which is as we have seen an exchange term resulting from the undistingushability of the detectors , can be eliminated if they are rendered distinguishable .",
    "this could be realized experimentally in several ways , for instance by using ionizaing lasers of different frequencies.@xcite in that case , the counting rate reduces to a simple measure of the normally ordered correlation function @xmath101 where @xmath102 .",
    "we conclude this section by noting once more that different gating schemes easily produce different cross - correlations functions between the optical and the matter - wave fields .",
    "it is easily shown that the gating scheme always selects the operators arrangement in such a way that time increases from the outside to the inside in the resulting correlations functions . as a result , of selecting the appropriate temporal ordering , it is possible to measure correlations functions involving different combinations of light and matter field operators .",
    "for example , the choice @xmath103 yields the correlation function @xmath104",
    "we now illustrate this theory by calculating selected third - order correlation functions of a system consisting of linearly coupled optical and matter - wave fields described by the effective hamiltonian @xmath105 where @xmath106 and @xmath107 are the number of modes in the optical and matter field , respectively , with eigenfrequencies @xmath108 and @xmath109 . in the following , we label the optical field with greek indices and the matter waves with roman letters .",
    "the mode annihilation operators @xmath110 and @xmath111 are the bosonic optical and matter mode operators associated with the mode functions @xmath112 and @xmath113 , respectively , and @xmath114 and @xmath115 are coupling constants which allow for a parametric amplification type of matter - light coupling as well .    the effective linear interaction of eq . ( [ a1 ] )",
    "while not conserving the number of particles , is a good approximation to the description of the coupling ( for instance via a two - photon raman transition ) between a macroscopically populated bose - einstein condensate ground state and some weakly populated side - modes , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "as long as the condensate is not significantly depleted by that interaction , one can invoke an `` undepleted '' mode approximation to replace the expectation value of the associated field mode operator by a c - number order parameter , leading to an interaction of the general form ( [ a1 ] ) , with @xmath114 and @xmath115 proportional to the order parameter .",
    "in addition to their hamiltonian evolution , we assume that the matter and light modes are also coupled to markovian thermal reservoirs which result in exponential losses at rates @xmath116 and @xmath117 . the langevin equations describing the evolution of this system are @xcite @xmath118 where @xmath119 are reservoir operators with @xmath120 and @xmath121 in the general expression ( [ a4 ] ) @xmath122 , @xmath123 ;",
    "@xmath124 , and @xmath125 is a @xmath126 matrix whose elements depend on the system parameters , and the difusion matrix is @xmath127 , where @xmath128 and @xmath129 are the thermal populations of the reservoir modes .",
    "we consider specifically the two - mode problem with drift matrix @xmath130 and diffusion matrix @xmath131 and evaluate the stationary value of the third - order correlation functions @xmath132 and @xmath133 using the derivation outlined in appendix a.    the normalized stationary cross - correlation function @xmath134 is shown in fig . 1 as a function of the time differences @xmath135 and @xmath136 .",
    "it corresponds to the time gating @xmath137 , so that @xmath138 . for the particular parameters at hand , and for a fixed time difference",
    "@xmath139 we observe a bunching - like behavior as a function of the time delay @xmath140 between the schrdinger detectors .",
    "this should be contrasted to fig .",
    "2 , which shows the normalized correlation function @xmath141 for the same parameters as in fig .",
    "1 . in this case",
    ", @xmath140 is the time difference between the photodetector and one of the schrdinger detectors , hence the behavior of the correlation function along @xmath140 exhibits a different behavior for fixed @xmath139 .",
    "note that the line @xmath142 yields identical information in both cases , since it corresponds to the identical physical situation where the optical detector and one of the matter - wave detectors are simulataneously turned off .",
    "the dynamical interplay between maxwell and schrdinger waves , which is the cornerstone of most novel applications of nonlinear and quantum atom optics , requires one to be able to manipulate and characterize not just the statistical properties of the optical and matter fields individually , but also their cross - coherence properties .    in this paper , we have extended the theory of mutual coherence between optical and matter waves to the study of higher - order correlation functions . while in most studies of degenerate atomic quantum gases it is sufficient to treat them as ( composite ) boson or fermion fields , this is no longer the case if the detection mechanism destroys the particles , as is the case for photoionization .",
    "the quantum statistics of the constituent particles play an important role , as illustrated by eqs .",
    "( [ b9 ] ) and ( [ b10 ] ) which show a bosonic term involving the simultaneous exchange of ions and electrons , and a fermionic term involving the exchange of ions or electrons alone .",
    "while it is possible to conceive specific counting schemes insensitive to these terms , it would be extremely interesting to observe them .",
    "the generalization of this analysis to fermionic fields is also of much interest , since in this case , the constituents involved are a fermionic field and a bosonic field instead of two fermionic fields as was the case in this paper .",
    "the exchange contributions to the ionization probability will be quite different in that case , since electron exchange , as well as the simultaneous exchange of ions and electrons , willl now lead to fermionic contributions , while the exchange of ions produces a bosonic term .",
    "from the expansions ( [ a2 ] ) and ( [ a3 ] ) of the schrdinger field operators , the correlation function @xmath143 is @xmath144 where @xmath145 is the matrix of eigenvectors of the system matrix @xmath125 , so that @xmath146 where @xmath147 are the eigenvalues of @xmath125 , and @xmath148 the correlation @xmath149 has a similar expression .",
