    "the standard model ( sm ) has been extremely compatible with all the experimental tests so far . however , there are many theoretical attempts to go beyond the sm in order to answer some fundamental issues in the sm namely the hierarchy problems , number of generations etc",
    ". theories with extra spatial dimensions have been proposed to answer the hierarchy problems of the sm @xcite . in what follows , in this paper",
    "we look for the graviton signals as predicted in the large extra dimensional model ( proposed by arkani - hamed , dimopoulos and dvali @xcite ) in the central diffractive processes at the lhc .",
    "forward physics has been used with great success in studying the standard model ( sm ) physics at colliders . in particular , hera ( hadron - electron ring accelerator ) has used forward detectors to greatly enhance our knowledge of perturbative quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) and its effects in deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) experiments . moreover ,",
    "the observation of diffractive events , those with large rapidity gaps between the final state particles , have been one of the most interesting aspects of hera physics .    in the last decade",
    "the importance of forward physics has been recognized for lhc ( large hadron collider ) physics too .",
    "this has resulted in a proposal to install forward particle detectors at atlas and cms in order to detect protons emitted in the forward direction , implying the existence of a centrally produced system with a rapidity gap between it and the protons  @xcite .",
    "more specifically , we are talking of a process of the kind @xmath1 , also known as central exclusive production ( cep ) . in this case , the outgoing protons are emitted with barely any loss of energy ( typically less than 2% of their longitudinal momenta ) along with a centrally produced system @xmath2 with a rapidity gap between it and the outgoing protons on either side .",
    "this is a clean production of the central system since it corresponds to just two forward protons in the final state along with the decay products used to identify the central particle @xmath2 and no hadronic activity between them .",
    "this has therefore been described as being like a vacuum fluctuation as the two protons pass each other , producing the central particle .",
    "some good review on the phenomenology of exclusive processes can be found in @xcite .",
    "recently , in @xcite a general framework of exclusive double diffractive processes and its prospects are discussed .",
    "one of the main aim of the forward physics at the lhc is to look for the exclusive higgs production events .",
    "first in @xcite , it was pointed out that higgs can be produced in diffractive processes with rapidity gaps on either side at hadron - hadron colliders .",
    "later this interesting scenario has been discussed in a series of papers  @xcite by several authors .",
    "recently , to compute the background for higgs searches , in @xcite authors have estimated the exclusive @xmath3 pair production cross section at the lhc . in exclusive processes higgs",
    "would be produced almost at rest through gluon - gluon fusion .",
    "the final state contains two protons and a higgs and , since the process is exclusive , the invariant mass of the higgs is directly related to the energy loss of the outgoing protons @xcite . in exclusive production , measuring the energy loss of the protons one can determine the mass of the central system without looking at its decay products .",
    "it was discussed in @xcite , if the outgoing protons scatter through small angles , the two - gluon system is in a @xmath4 c - even , p - even state , where the @xmath5-axis is the proton beam axis .",
    "this means that any new resonance must carry the @xmath6 quantum number in cep . in other words",
    ", this enables a clean determination of the quantum numbers of any new resonance @xcite .    with the possibility of tagging the forward outgoing protons ,",
    "the lhc can be turned into an effective gluon - gluon , photon - proton and photon - photon collider , giving rise to a major qcd and electroweak physics program  @xcite .",
    "in addition , the possibility of producing quarkonium states like @xmath7 , @xmath8 , is something being envisaged at the alice detector .",
    "as discussed in @xcite , the measurement of the two - body decay channels of @xmath9 to light mesons in exclusive process can be used to study the dynamics of heavy quarkonia and to test the qcd framework of cep .",
    "however all these studies require a qcd based model that allows us to couple the di - gluon system to the protons . the preferred model to describe",
    "this is the so- called durham model which we briefly describe in the next section .",
    "before we do that however , we should point out that various other processes in the cep scenario have recently been observed in the tevatron at cdf which have given physicists the confidence that the durham model is on the right track . even though the durham model was proposed almost a decade ago , it was not until 2006 that cdf saw diphoton production in the central rapidity region which was consistent with the gluon - gluon fusion durham model  @xcite .",
    "subsequently cdf also found another exclusive process - @xmath10 and @xmath11 production  produced by two photons  @xcite . here the tevatron ( and in future the lhc ) acts as a photon photon collider .",
    "these processes also allow the calibration of the forward proton detectors proposed by cms and atlas .",
    "quarkonium production of @xmath8 and @xmath12(2s ) as well as @xmath13 have also been observed through their decay products  @xcite .",
    "exclusive dijet production has been observed , at cdf  @xcite and d0 @xcite in line with the predictions of the durham model .",
    "these processes already seen at the tevatron have given confidence that we can use digluon fusion is accordance with the durham model to observe the signatures of new physics .",
    "it was indicated in @xcite that new physics like susy , extra dimensions etc .",
    "can be searched for in exclusive processes . in the exclusive configuration various bsm signatures",
    "namely mssm higgs @xcite , charged higgs @xcite , triplet higgs @xcite , radions @xcite , massive gravitons @xcite , long lived gluinos @xcite , effects of quantum gravity @xcite etc .",
    "have been discussed in the literature . in this work",
    "we study inclusive double diffractive process as a probe of large extra dimensions ( add model ) using dilepton and diphoton channels via the exchange of kk graviton .    in sec .",

    "[ sec : conclusion ] we offer our conclusions .",
    "in this section we give a very brief introduction of the add model @xcite .",
    "this model assumes that space is @xmath14 dimensional where @xmath15 is the number of extra spatial dimensions .",
    "all the sm particles are confined to the usual @xmath16d spacetime which is called `` brane '' . whereas , gravity can propagate in the extra dimensions . in this model ,",
    "the @xmath17d planck scale ( @xmath18 gev ) is a derived scale which is related to the fundamental planck scale ( @xmath19 tev ) by @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the extra dimensional volume and @xmath22 is the compactification radius .",
    "an important consequence of the add model is the appearance of a tower of kaluza - klein ( kk ) modes as a solution to the linearized einstein equation in @xmath14 dimensions .",
    "these kk modes are almost degenerate and separated in mass by @xmath23 ( @xmath24 @xmath25 ev to @xmath26 mev for @xmath27 ) terms .",
    "after kk decomposition , we have massive spin-2 kk gravitons ( @xmath28 ) which have interactions with the brane localized sm states via the energy momentum tensor @xmath29 of the sm @xmath30 where @xmath31 and the summation runs over all kk modes .",
    "the add model has been studied extensively both theoretically as well as experimentally .",
    "recently , the extra dimensions are being searched for using dilepton and diphoton channels at the lhc , both by atlas @xcite and cms @xcite .",
    "these searches has already put the lower bound on @xmath32 quite high .",
    "we consider two types of double diffractive ( dd ) mechanisms at the lhc as follows :    1 .",
    "central exclusive process ( cep ) : @xmath33 as shown in fig .",

    "the differential cross sections for exclusive and inclusive dd processes shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : dd_process ] can be expressed in the factorized form  @xcite , @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the cross section of the hard subprocess which produces the color singlet system of invariant mass @xmath2 ( @xmath39 ) and @xmath40 is the effective luminosity for the production of a system of invariant mass @xmath2 at rapidity @xmath41 .",
    "the total cross section @xmath42 can be calculated using @xmath43    in our calculation , we keep @xmath40 and @xmath38 in a factorized form as the effective luminosity is independent of the subprocess and for different processes we need to compute just the subprocess cross sections .",
    "although we keep @xmath40 and @xmath38 in a factorized form , we must remember that there might exist specific selection rules for different configurations . in the exclusive configuration",
    ", the fusing @xmath44 state obeys a special selection rule in the limit that the protons scatter through zero angle .",
    "the @xmath5-component of the angular momentum of a centrally produced system vanishes as the incoming state which consists of the fusing hard gluons has @xmath45 with positive @xmath46 and @xmath47 parity  @xcite .",
    "for inclusive production on the other hand , there is no such selection rule and therefore , the production rate is larger than that for the exclusive production .",
    "although the signals are very clear for cep , the luminosity and the event rates are very small due to the restricted kinematics .",
    "a much larger phase space is available due to the dissociation of the incoming protons in the inclusive dd case .",
    "the luminosities for exclusive and inclusive processes can be computed using the known parton distribution functions ( pdf ) of the protons .      to estimate @xmath40 we shall use what is known as the `` durham model '' , described in refs .",
    "the @xmath40 depends on off - diagonal or skewed gluon distribution functions ( off - diagonal , since we need to consider the coupling of two gluons with different momentum fractions , @xmath48 and @xmath49 , with a proton ) . however , as we see , for @xmath50 and @xmath51 , the relevant kinematic region for cep , it is possible to approximate the off - diagonal distributions using the integrated gluon distribution function @xcite . for cip",
    "the dominant ( leading logarithm ) contribution comes from the asymmetric configuration , @xmath52 . at the partonic level ,",
    "the inclusive production is equivalent to the exclusive production and the unintegrated gluon distributions in partons may be calculated perturbatively in terms of non - forward bfkl amplitudes .",
    "the effective luminosity depends also on two survival probabilities of the rapidity gaps - one to the qcd radiation and another to the non - perturbative soft rescattering of the protons .",
    "the first is expressed as a sudakov factor which ensures the fusing gluons remain intact up to the hard scale @xmath53 .",
    "the second factor is included as an explicit multiplicative factor @xmath54 , known as the `` gap survival factor '' .",
    "it accounts for the probability that apart from the perturbative processes , no other particle is produced via soft interactions between the protons  @xcite . in general @xmath54",
    "is expected to depend on the kinematics of the process and can be calculated using various qcd based models @xcite . typically , for lhc energies , @xmath54 for cep is estimated to be a few percent  @xcite ( e.g. , in @xcite authors found @xmath55 for 14 tev ( 8 tev ) lhc ) . for cip , relatively smaller absorption cross section leads to a larger @xmath54 . for simplicity , in our analysis",

    "the spin-2 gravitons can have three possible spin projections @xmath74 0 , 1 and 2 .",
    "due to the presence of special @xmath75 selection rule in the exclusive configuration , graviton can not be produced via leading order ( lo ) exclusive processes point - like @xmath44 coupling to a @xmath76 graviton , it can still be produced at next to lo ( nlo ) in the exclusive configuration . ]",
    "@xcite . in the unitary gauge ,",
    "the coupling of the spin-0 projection of @xmath73 with two gluons is zero as the lo coupling of spin-0 component with any two vector bosons is proportional to the square of the mass of the vector boson and gluons are massless in this case  @xcite . by the landau - yang theorem @xcite , it is impossible to produce a spin-1 particle via the fusion of two on - shell vector bosons but the production is not forbidden if those vector bosons are off - shell .",
    "though the gluons coming from protons are not purely on - shell , the degree of virtuality of the gluons is very small .",
    "thus , the contribution in any process from spin-1 projection of graviton is subdominant  @xcite .",
