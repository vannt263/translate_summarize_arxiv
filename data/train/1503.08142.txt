    "then we compare photoluminescence data with and without the presence of an aperture , to demonstrate that the oxide aperture plays an important role in trapping the charges , .",
    "these observations support our claim that the mechanism behind the observed nonlinear effects in the resonant qd scans , is the excitation of charges that are trapped by the oxide aperture .",

    "[ supplfig1 ] ( b ) we compare the absolute value of the photocurrent produced by the @xmath66 nm and @xmath53 nm laser , normalized by the pump laser intensity . for both lasers a strong bias voltage dependency is visible and the collected photocurrent is smaller at a larger bias voltage , which is closer to the flatband regime .",
    "this indicates that either the absorption , or the collection efficiency of the excited charges , is voltage dependent .",
    "the 940 nm laser gives rise to a photocurrent of about 0.5 ma / w at a bias voltage of 700 mv where charge neutral qds are typically operated , which at an intensity of @xmath67 nw corresponds to about @xmath68 charges being excited and collected per second .",

    "single qd lines ( marked by the arrows ) are hardly distinguishable from the background cavity emission , which originates from broadband wetting layer emission . for increasing pump laser intensity ,",
    "it is clearly visible that the qd lines appear at a lower bias voltage . for the qds in the region without an oxide aperture ,",

    "a shoulder is visible , which corresponds with the voltage range where the qds are on average charge neutral",
    ". the shoulder does shift to a lower voltage range , but the shift ( in total @xmath69 mv for 1100 @xmath55w ) is much smaller compared to the total @xmath70 mv ( for 1500 @xmath55w ) voltage shift of the qds in the microcavity .",
    "even though it is likely that roughly the same amount of charges are excited by the @xmath64 nm laser in the microcavity region compared to elsewhere in the sample , these results indicate that the oxide aperture provides a charge memory , causing a much larger effective charge buildup resulting in a larger voltage shift of the qds .",

    "<S> in an oxide apertured quantum dot ( qd ) micropillar cavity - qed system , we found strong qd hysteresis effects and lineshape modifications even at very low intensities corresponding to @xmath0 intracavity photons . </S>",
    "<S> we attribute this to the excitation of charges by the intracavity field ; charges that get trapped at the oxide aperture , where they screen the internal electric field and blueshift the qd transition . </S>",
    "<S> this in turn strongly modulates light absorption by cavity qed effects , eventually leading to the observed hysteresis and lineshape modifications . </S>",
    "<S> the cavity also enables us to observe the qd dynamics in real time , and all experimental data agrees well with a power - law charging model . </S>",
    "<S> this effect can serve as a novel tuning mechanism for quantum dots .    </S>",
    "<S> cavity quantum electrodynamics with quantum dots ( qds ) coupled to microcavities enables various applications such as single - photon switches @xcite , generation of non - classical states of light @xcite and hybrid quantum information schemes @xcite . however , qds deviate from an ideal atom - like systems as they strongly interact with their environment , for example through nuclear spins @xcite and via charge traps @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> ( d ) presents simulations that predict the scans in ( c ) . ]    in this letter we investigate such a qd - cavity system . for sufficiently low optical field intensity </S>",
    "<S> this system can be described by the qed of an effective 2-level system in a single - mode cavity . </S>",
    "<S> for increasing intensities we report on bistable and strong nonlinear behavior . </S>",
    "<S> the sample under study consists of inas self - assembled qds inside a pin diode structure embedded in a micropillar . </S>",
    "<S> this system combines qd charge and stark shift control by applying a bias voltage with high - quality polarization - degenerate cavity modes @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the mode confinement in the transversal direction is achieved by an oxide aperture formed through a wet oxidation step . </S>",
    "<S> the observed bistability and nonlinear behavior in the cavity qed system can be explained by attributing a second role to the oxide aperture , namely that of a charge memory . </S>",
    "<S> charges in this memory , created by resonant absorption , will cause a modification to the applied bias voltage which in turn shifts the qd frequency , and modify the amount of absorption . in figure  [ fig1 ]  ( a ) the sample structure , with charges trapped at the oxide aperture , </S>",

    "<S> upward and downward frequency scans overlap perfectly and can be fitted by theory for a dipole inside an optical cavity , which we will discuss later in detail . however , when a higher intensity of 1 nw is used , several strong deviations occur , see fig . </S>",

    "<S> finally , in order to obtain the same qd detuning compared to the low intensity scans , a lower bias voltage has to be applied . </S>",

    "<S> the qd transition is probed with a low intensity ( 1 pw ) probe laser such that no line shape modification occurs . </S>",
    "<S> we then add a second high intensity ( 1 nw ) pump laser with orthogonal polarization , such that it can be filtered out with a crossed polarizer in the detection channel . </S>",
    "<S> the pump laser is scanned in steps across the cavity resonance ; for each step the qd - cavity spectrum is measured with the weak probe laser . </S>",

    "<S> for every bias voltage the qd - cavity and pump laser - cavity detunings are determined , and the relative qd frequency as function of the pump laser - cavity detuning is shown in fig . </S>",

    "<S> the gray dashed curves are lorentzian lines convoluted with the @xmath16 power - law from fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2 ]  ( c ) and correspond to the data nicely . in conclusion , the data clearly shows that the qd resonance blueshifts when the intracavity field increases , and this effect is independent of the qd - laser or the qd - cavity detuning .    </S>",
    "<S> we now introduce a model that explains the dynamic line shape modifications . </S>",
    "<S> we start from the transmission amplitude of a cavity with a coupled dipole @xcite : @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the relative detuning between the laser ( @xmath14 ) and cavity ( @xmath19 ) angular frequencies , @xmath2 is the device cooperativity , @xmath20 is the relative detuning between the laser and qd transition ( @xmath21 ) , @xmath22 is the output coupling efficiency , @xmath23 is the total intensity damping rate of the cavity and @xmath3 is the qd dephasing rate . we obtain close to perfect mode - matching , and therefore the total transmittivity through the cavity is given by @xmath24 , and the total reflectivity is given by @xmath25 . in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1 ]  ( a ) we show that the model fits the low intensity measurements very well . </S>",
    "<S> the qd cooperativity and dephasing parameters @xmath2 and @xmath3 are noted in the subfigure windows , and a cavity damping rate @xmath26 ns@xmath13 and an output coupling efficiency @xmath27 is found , corresponding to a cavity @xmath28-factor of @xmath29 .    as a next step , </S>",
    "<S> we introduce a qd frequency @xmath30 that dynamically changes with the intracavity intensity , which is proportional to @xmath31 : @xmath32 where @xmath33 equals the qd frequency in the limit of vanishing intracavity intensity . based on the empirical values determined in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2 ]  ( c ) , we use @xmath34 ghz , with @xmath35 in pw , and @xmath36 . due to cavity qed effects </S>",
    "<S> , the intracavity field depends strongly on the qd frequency such that the cavity can change from being largely transparent to being largely reflective through only small changes in the qd frequency . </S>",
    "<S> this interplay leads to the observed nonlinear behaviour .    finally , we take into account that we are operating the qd  cavity system close to the saturation intensity , which slightly suppresses the qd features . </S>",
    "<S> we take this into account by calculating the reflectivity @xmath37 by taking the weighted sum of the reflectivities of a coupled ( @xmath38 ) and uncoupled ( @xmath39 ) cavity : @xmath40 , with @xmath41 . </S>",
    "<S> this is a strong simplification of a more rigorous approach based on the quantum master equation and calculation of the intracavity photon number @xcite , but is sufficient for our purpose . for qd cooperativity @xmath2 and dephasing rate @xmath3 </S>",
    "<S> we use the values obtained in the fits in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1 ]  ( a ) . </S>",
    "<S> figure  [ fig1 ]  ( c ) shows that the predicted scans match the actual measurements very well .    as the underlying physical mechanism </S>",
    "<S> we hypothesize that charges are excited by the resonant laser and get trapped at the oxide aperture . </S>",
    "<S> reasonably high doping concentrations were used , up to @xmath42 @xmath43 for the carbon p - doped layers and up to @xmath44 @xmath43 for the silicon n - doped layers , and it is well - known that absorption takes place in these doped layers @xcite , resulting in a non - neglible photocurrent ( see the supplemental material section i @xcite ) . the excited charges partly screen the internal electric field responsible for the quantum confined stark effect in the qd , leading to the observed blueshift of the qd transitions .    </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the fact that even for a very low cavity mean photon number of @xmath45 ( @xmath46 pw ) nonlinearities take place , indicates that the oxide aperture must form an efficient charge memory compared to the qd - cavity decay rate ( 77 ns@xmath13 ) . </S>",
    "<S> it is well known that the interface between gaas and aluminum oxide ( alo@xmath47 ) , produced by wet oxidation of alas , provides a very high density of charge traps , in the form of amorphous oxide and micro crystallites @xcite , and in the form of elemental interfacial as @xcite , leading to spatially non - uniform fermi level pinning @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the time - resolved charge decay measurements presented below confirm that the charges are relatively long - lived on a @xmath48 ms timescale . </S>",
    "<S> also , a comparison with qds observed outside of the oxide aperture region show that laser induced blueshift is neglible in these regions ( see supplemental material section ii @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the charging hypothesis agrees with the observed @xmath49 sublinear power - law , which would be the consequence of coulomb repulsion between trapped charges , possibly in combination with increased filling of trap states that have an increasing decay rate .    </S>",
    "<S> our results agree with observations in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , where single  charge fluctuations are probed at a gaas / alas interface located about 50 nm away from the qds , while a gradual variation was observed for charge traps more than 150 nm away . </S>",
    "<S> we did not observe any single  </S>",

    "<S> in contrast to our work , the gaas / alas interface studied in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite is located in the intrinsic region , while the aperture in our sample is located in the p - doped region , but a similar qd blueshift for increasing laser intensity and constant bias voltage was observed .     </S>",

    "<S> ]    finally , we performed a set of measurements to gain insight in the temporal dynamics of the charge build - up and decay . </S>",
    "<S> for this purpose we use a laser ( @xmath53 nm ) that is off - resonant with the cavity but is resonant with the wetting layer . at a larger laser intensity </S>",
    "<S> , more charges are excited compared to the resonant laser and larger qd shifts can be obtained . </S>",
    "<S> we now use the coupled qd - cavity system as a very sensitive probe of the internal electric field , a principle that was also used to monitor a single charge trap in real - time @xcite .    </S>",

    "<S> [ fig2 ] ( d ) , a clear sub - linear behavior @xmath54 is visible . at an even higher intensity of 100 @xmath55w , a bias voltage of 350 mv had to be applied to tune the qd in to resonance , clearly indicating that the charge buildup and qd blueshift is not easily saturated . </S>",
    "<S> strikingly , even for an excitation power of 200 nw , the qd has the same cooperativity @xmath2 and dephasing rate @xmath3 as when no off - resonant laser is present , see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig4 ]  ( b ) . </S>",
    "<S> this indicates that , even though many charges are excited , they are located relatively far away and give rise to a more - or - less constant effective electric field , thereby preserving the qd coherence .    in order to directly monitor the time dynamics of the charge buildup and decay , we fix a weak probe laser that will not excite any additional charges at the cavity resonance , and monitor the reflectivity as function of bias voltage and time . </S>",
    "<S> figure [ fig4 ] ( c ) shows , for various off - resonant pump laser intensities , reflectivity colormaps of the probe laser when the off - resonant pump laser is turned on at @xmath52 ms . </S>",
    "<S> for @xmath56 ms , the qd is resonant with the cavity resonance at @xmath57 mv ( white dashed lines ) , corresponding with a high probe laser reflectivity at this voltage and a low reflectivity at different voltages . </S>",
    "<S> the reflectivity at @xmath57 mv abruptly decreases as the pump laser is turned on , but is then restored at lower bias voltages , demonstating direct probing of the charge build - up . for increasing pump laser intensities , </S>",
    "<S> the reflectivity is restored at a lower voltage , but also the time for the charge build - up to reach an equilibrium decreases .    the decay of the charges is monitored in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig4 ] ( d ) , where the pump laser is turned off at @xmath52 ms . for @xmath56 ms the qd reflectivity signal is now highest for a low bias voltage when the charge reservoir is saturated . </S>",
    "<S> after the pump is turned off and the charges disappear , the reflectivity now gets restored at an increasing bias voltage . </S>",
    "<S> the charge decay rate is initially fastest , when many charges are still present and the qd is resonant at a lower bias voltage , but then strongly decreases and finally occurs on a @xmath410 ms timescale , much slower than the charge build - up rate .    </S>",
    "<S> we now introduce a simple power - law model to describe the charge build - up and decay dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> we assume that the qd voltage shift @xmath58 is proportional to the number of trapped charges @xmath28 , and increases as a function of the pump laser intensity @xmath59 , such that @xmath60 . as a result </S>",
    "<S> , the charge decay and buildup is described using : @xmath61 . </S>",

    "<S> [ fig4 ] ( b ) and the white - black dashed lines fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig4 ] ( c - d ) are reproduced with @xmath62 and the same power - law scaling factor @xmath36 as found earlier , and describe the data nicely .    </S>",
    "<S> the effect we found enables a novel method to tune qd transitions without the need for electrical contacts , or enable independent tuning of qds sharing the same voltage contacts . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore it could serve as a low power all - optical switch mediated by a charge memory . </S>",
    "<S> the cavity - enhanced feedback mechanism with the charge environment could in principle also occur in other solid - state microcavity structures , where doped layers are present in which charges can be excited and where material defects or interfaces could act as a charge trap . </S>",
    "<S> this interaction therefore also has to be taken into account when studying dynamical nuclear spin polarization ( dnp ) effects in a cavity , which is of general interest to prolong the qd coherence time and the potential to form a quantum memory . </S>",
    "<S> dnp gives rise to qd line shape modifications , hysteresis and bistabilitity behavior @xcite ; phenomena that could also give rise to cavity - enhanced feedback mechanisms .    in conclusion , </S>",
    "<S> we have studied a neutral qd transition coupled to a microcavity and observed strong cavity - enhanced feedback with the charge environment . </S>",
    "<S> hysteresis and modifications of the qd line shape are demonstrated at intensities of way less than 1 photon per cavity lifetime , which we explain and model by a qd frequency blueshift attributed to charges trapped at the oxide aperture as a function of the intracavity field . </S>",
    "<S> in general , these results demonstrate the potential of studying and controlling the qd environment using a cavity qed system .    </S>",
