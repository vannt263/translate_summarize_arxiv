    "in the steiner forest problem , given a metric space and a set of source - sink pairs @xmath2 , a feasible solution is a forest such that each source - sink pair lies in the same tree in this forest .",
    "the goal is to minimize the cost , i.e. , the total length of edges in the forest .",
    "this problem is a generalization of the steiner tree problem , and hence apx - hard .",
    "the constant - factor approximation algorithms currently known for it are all based on linear programming techniques .",
    "the first such result was an influential primal - dual @xmath3-approximation due to agrawal , klein , and ravi  @xcite ; this was simplified by goemans and williamson  @xcite and extended to many `` constrained forest '' network design problems .",
    "other works have since analyzed the integrality gaps of the natural linear program , and for some stronger lps ; see .    however , no constant - factor approximations are known based on `` purely combinatorial '' techniques .",
    "some natural algorithms have been proposed , but these have defied analysis for the most part .",
    "the simplest is the _ paired greedy algorithm _ that repeatedly connects the yet - unconnected @xmath4-@xmath5 pair at minimum mutual distance ; this is no better than @xmath6 ( see chan , roughgarden , and valiant  @xcite or full version  [ sec : girth - lbd ] ) .",
    "even greedier is the so - called _ gluttonous algorithm _ that connects the closest two yet - unsatisfied terminals regardless of whether they were `` mates '' .",
    "the performance of this algorithm has been a long - standing open question .",
    "our main result settles this question .",
    "[ thm : main - intro ] the gluttonous algorithm is a constant - factor approximation for steiner forest .",
    "we then apply this result to obtain a simple combinatorial approximation algorithm for the _ two - stage stochastic version _ of the steiner forest problem . in this problem",
    ", we are given a probability distribution @xmath7 defined over subsets of demands .",
    "in the first stage , we can buy some set @xmath8 of edges . then in the second stage , the demand set is revealed ( drawn from @xmath7 ) , and we can extend the set @xmath8 to a feasible solution for this demand set . however , these edges now cost @xmath9 times more than in the first stage .",
    "the goal is to minimize the total expected cost .",
    "it suffices to specify the set @xmath8once the actual demands are known , we can augment using our favorite approximation algorithm for steiner forest .",
    "our simple algorithm is the following : sample @xmath10 times from the distribution @xmath7 , and let @xmath8 be the steiner forest constructed by ( a slight variant of ) the gluttonous algorithm on union of these @xmath11 demand sets sampled from @xmath7 .",
    "[ thm : stoc - main ] there is a combinatorial ( greedy ) constant - factor approximation algorithm for the stochastic steiner forest problem .",
    "showing that such a `` boosted sampling '' algorithm obtained a constant factor approximation had proved elusive for several years now ; the only constant - factor approximation for stochastic steiner forest was a complicated primal - dual algorithm with a worse approximation factor  @xcite .",
    "our result is based on the first cost sharing scheme for the steiner forest problem which is constant strictwith respect to a constant factor approximation algorithm ; see for the formal definition .",
    "such a cost sharing scheme can be used for designing approximation algorithms for several stochastic network design problems for the steiner forest problem . in particular",
    ", we obtain the following results :    * for multi - stage stochastic optimization problem for steiner forest , our strict - cost sharing scheme along with the fact that it is also cross - monotone implies the first @xmath12-approximation algorithm , where @xmath13 denotes the number of stages ( see  @xcite for formal definitions and the relation with cost sharing ) . * consider the online stochastic problem , where given a set of source - sink pairs @xmath14 in a metric @xmath15 , and a probability distribution @xmath7 over subsets of @xmath14 ( i.e. , over @xmath16 ) , an adversary chooses a parameter @xmath13 , and draws @xmath13 times independently from @xmath7 .",
    "the on - line algorithm , which can sample from @xmath7 , needs to maintain a feasible solution over the set of demand pairs produced by the adversary at all time .",
    "the goal is to minimize the expected cost of the solution produced by the algorithm , where the expectation is over @xmath7 and random coin tosses of the algorithm .",
    "our cost sharing framework gives the first constant competitive algorithm for this problem , generalizing the result of garg et al .",
    "@xcite which works for the special case when @xmath7 is a distribution over @xmath14 ( i.e. , singleton subsets of @xmath14 ) .",
    "we first describe the gluttonous algorithm . call a terminal",
    "_ active _ if it is not yet connected to its mate .",
    "recall : our algorithm merges the two active terminals that are closest in the current metric ( and hence zeroes out their distance ) . at any point of time",
    ", we have a collection of _ supernodes _ , each supernode corresponding to the set of terminals which have been merged together .",
    "a supernode is _ active _ if it contains at least one active terminal .",
    "hence the algorithm can be alternatively described thus : merge the two active supernodes that are closest ( in the current metric ) into a new supernode .",
    "( a formal description of the algorithm appears in  [ sec : algo ] . )",
    "the analysis has two conceptual steps . in the first step ,",
    "we reduce the problem to the special case when the optimal solution can be ( morally ) assumed to be a single tree ( formally , we reduce to the case where the gluttonous solution is a refinement of the optimal solution ) .",
    "the proof for this part is simple : we take an optimal forest , and show that we can connect two trees in the forest if the gluttonous algorithm connects two terminals lying in these two trees , incurring only a factor - of - two loss .",
    "r0.3     the second step of the analysis starts with the tree solution @xmath17 promised by the first step of the analysis .",
    "as the gluttonous algorithm proceeds , the analysis alters @xmath17 to maintain a candidate solution to the current set of supernodes .",
    "e.g. , if we merge two active supernodes @xmath18 and @xmath19 to get a new supernode @xmath20 .",
    "we want to alter the solution @xmath17 on the original supernodes to get a new solution @xmath21 , say by removing an edge from the ( unique ) @xmath18-@xmath19 path in @xmath17 , and then short - cutting any degree two inactive supernode in @xmath21 ( see figure  [ fig : tree ] for an example ) .",
    "the hope is to argue that the distance between @xmath18 and @xmath19which is the cost incurred by gluttonous  is commensurate to the cost of the edge of @xmath17 which gets removed during this process",
    ". this would be easy if there were a long edge on @xmath18-@xmath19 path in the tree @xmath17 . the problem : this may not hold for every pair of supernodes we merge . despite this , our analysis shows that the bad cases can not happen too often , and so we can perform this charging argument in an amortized sense .",
    "our analysis is flexible and extends to other variants of the gluttonous algorithm .",
    "a natural variant is one where , instead of merging the two closest active supernodes , we contract the edges on a shortest path between the two closest active supernodes . first step of the above analysis does not hold any more .",
    "however , we show that it is enough to account for the merging cost of supernodes when the active terminals in them lie in the same tree of the optimal solution , and consequently the arguments in the second step of the analysis are sufficient .",
    "yet another variant is a _ timed _ version of the algorithm , which is inspired by a timed version of the primal - dual algorithm  @xcite , and is crucial for obtaining the strictcost - shares described next .",
    "loosely speaking , a cost - sharing method takes an algorithm @xmath22 and divides the cost incurred by the algorithm on an instance among the terminals @xmath14 in that instance .",
    "the `` strictness '' property ensures that if we partition @xmath14 arbitrarily into @xmath23 , and build a solution @xmath24 on @xmath25 , then the cost - shares of the terminals in @xmath26 would suffice to augment the solution @xmath24 to one for @xmath26 as well .    a natural candidate for @xmath22",
    "is the gw primal - dual algorithm , and the cost - shares are equally natural : we divide up the cost of growing moats among the active terminals in the moat .",
    "however , the example in figure  [ fig : ex ] shows why this fails when @xmath26 consists of just the demand pair @xmath27 .",
    "when run on all the terminals , the primal - dual algorithm stops at time  1 , with all terminals getting a cost - share of  1 . on the other hand ,",
    "if we run @xmath22 on @xmath25 , it finds a solution which has @xmath28 connected components , each connecting @xmath4 and @xmath29 for @xmath30 .",
    "then connecting @xmath31 and @xmath32 costs @xmath33 , which is much more than their total cost share .",
    "are 2 for all @xmath34 .",
    "further , @xmath35 for @xmath36 .",
    "the distances @xmath37 and @xmath38 are slightly larger than 2 .",
    "the dotted lines indicate the forest returned by the gw primal - dual algorithm when run on the demand set @xmath39,height=56 ]    to avoid this problem ,  @xcite run the primal - dual algorithm for longer than required , and give results for the case when @xmath26 contains a single demand pair .",
    "however , the arguments become much more involved than those in the analysis of gw algorithm  @xcite  the main reason is the presence of `` dead '' moats which cause some edges to become tight , and the cost shares of active terminals can not account for such edges . in our case , the combinatorial ( greedy ) nature of our algorithm / analysis means we do not face such issues . as a result , we can obtain such strict cost sharing methods ( when @xmath26 is a singleton set ) with much simpler analysis , albeit with worse constants than those in  @xcite ) .",
    "we refer to this special case of strictness property as _ uni - strictness_.    our analysis for the general case where @xmath26 contains multiple demand pairs requires considerably more work ; but note that these are the first known strict cost shares for this case , the previous primal - dual techniques could not handle the complexity of this general case . here ,",
    "we want @xmath22 to build as many edges as possible , and the cost share @xmath40 to be as large as possible .",
    "since the gluttonous algorithm tends to build fewer edges than primal - dual ( the dead moats causing extra connections and more edges ) , we end up using the primal - dual algorithm as the algorithm @xmath22 .",
    "however , to define the cost - shares , we use the ( timed ) gluttonous algorithm in order to avoid the issues with dead moats .",
    "the analysis then proceeds via showing a close correspondence between the primal - dual and gluttonous algorithms .",
    "although this is not involved , it needs to carefully match the two runs .",
    "we first describe some related work in , and give some important definitions in .",
    "then we describe the gluttonous algorithm formally in , and then analyze this algorithm in .",
    "then show that our analysis is flexible enough to analyze several variants of the gluttonous algorithm .",
    "we study the the timed version in , which gets used in subsequent sections on cost sharing .",
    "we also consider the variant of gluttonous based on path - contraction in the appendix ( see ) .",
    "the cost - sharing method for the uni - strictcase is in , and the general case is in .",
    "we briefly describe the timed version in , which gets used in the subsequent section on cost sharing .",
    "the cost - sharing scheme and its properties are described in  .",
    "the details of the analysis and the simpler analysis in the uni - strictcase are deferred to the full version .",
    "we also analyse the variant of the gluttonous which relies on contract shortest path between supernodes in the full version .",
    "the first constant - factor approximation algorithm for the steiner forest problem was due to agrawal , klein , and ravi  @xcite using a primal - dual approach ; it was refined and generalized by goemans and williamson  @xcite to a wider class of network design problems .",
    "the primal - dual analysis also bounds integrality gap of the the natural lp relaxation ( based on covering cuts ) by a factor of @xmath3 .",
    "different approximation algorithms for steiner forest based off the same lp , and achieving the same factor of @xmath3 , are obtained using the iterative rounding technique of jain  @xcite , or the integer decomposition techniques of chekuri and shepherd  @xcite .",
    "a stronger lp relaxation was proposed by knemann , leonardi , and schfer  @xcite , but it also has an integrality gap of  @xmath3  @xcite .    the special case of the steiner tree problem , where all the demands share a common ( source ) terminal , has been well - studied in the network design community . there is a simple 2-approximation algorithm for this problem : iteratively find the closest terminal to the source vertex , and merge these two terminals .",
