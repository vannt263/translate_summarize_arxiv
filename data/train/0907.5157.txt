    "fluorescence correlation spectroscopy ( fcs ) is a technique based on the analysis of the fluctuations of fluorescence that permits to quantify a wide range of phenomena such as photophysical , photochemical , interaction , diffusion and transport properties of fluorescently labeled molecules.@xcite benefitting from the dramatic progress of bright fluorescent molecules and high sensitivity detectors , this technique can now be performed within the confocal volume of high numerical aperture microscope objectives .",
    "the spatial resolution , the intrinsic steady - state regime , as well as the capability to record a huge number of events make it now a routine tool for cell biology.@xcite    however , the original fcs technique is limited by the fact the dynamic system under study is exclusively analyzed in terms of temporal fluctuations at a single location , at a spatial scale related to the measurement volume , while a much more complete description would require investigations in the spatio - temporal domain . as a consequence , various phenomena of similar timescale taking place within the same specimen",
    "can not be efficiently discriminated without a strong a priori knowledge of the system .",
    "for instance , fcs measurements of translational diffusion performed under photobleaching conditions may actually monitor the survival time of the fluorophores instead of their diffusion time.@xcite    in order to overcome this lack of spatial information , several fcs - based techniques have been proposed .",
    "the analysis can be performed by cross - correlating signals recorded at two distant locations ; this approach suits the best to transport phenomena@xcite but it can also successfully be extended to the measurement of absolute diffusion , although the time gating that is required in order to overcome the crosstalk between the two overlapping volumes makes it more difficult to implement.@xcite the two observation volumes can also be simply realized by splitting the detected fluorescence onto two shifted detectors,@xcite but this causes the two resulting measurement volumes to be slightly deformed .",
    "a more versatile scheme has been proposed using an array detector , but it is still limited by a finite readout speed.@xcite another approach allowing to achieve a better spatial description of a system is to perform fcs measurements at various spatial scales , by changing the observation volumes.@xcite it has been shown that this approach allows to discriminate between possible diffusion regimes of molecular species in cell membranes and even to quantify submicron structures.@xcite    another class of methods derived from fcs consists in scanning the observation spot in a repetitive fashion in the sample , and therefore collecting sequentially fluorescence information from many locations , which improves the statistical accuracy of the measurement and reduces photobleaching.@xcite line or circle scan are used in so - called scanning fcs ( sfcs ) experiments , while image scans produce image frames that are analyzed using image correlation spectroscopy ( ics ) techniques . although sfcs and ics are based on the same principle , they address different time scales .",
    "sfcs can analyze dynamics in a wide range down to a fraction of a millisecond.@xcite it was shown recently that this method allows to measure absolute diffusion coefficient in biological systems,@xcite and even to discriminate different dynamic processes of comparable timescale.@xcite except raster ics ( rics ) , which allows to analyze fast dynamics by exploiting the time taken by the raster scan,@xcite ics and its variants@xcite suit better to slowly diffusing systems .",
    "all these methods can be in principle easily implemented on any laser scanning confocal microscopy system .    in this article",
    ", we describe a fcs system that is based on two custom laser scanning confocal microscopes sharing the same objective , and creating within the specimen two fully independent diffraction - limited measurement spots .",
    "each spot can operate either in a static mode at an arbitrary location or in a scanning mode , along an arbitrary periodic trajectory that can be one or several image frames , circles , lines , or any other closed loop , while the signals of fluorescence are recorded by two dedicated confocal detection channels .",
    "the instrument has been designed in order to offer a high level of flexibility .",
    "the operating modes include dual spot twin measurements ( i.e. , simultaneous measurements performed in the same mode at two locations ) , dual spot cross analysis , as well as hybrid measurements that assign a different measurement mode to each spot .",

    "because spot @xmath67 is following spot @xmath68 , the first peak of @xmath65 corresponds to a quarter of an orbit , i.  e. , is obtained at @xmath69  ms , the following peaks occurring at @xmath70  ms , 2.25  ms , etc .",
    "finally , peaks for correlation @xmath64 are measured at @xmath71  ms , 1.75  ms , etc .",
    "obtaining scanning fcs data for short delays is a challenging issue in a single spot geometry because the shortest delay is directly given by the fastest scanning period , which is usually limited by mechanical response of the scanning system.@xcite without modifying the scanning features , the dual spot scheme that we propose allows to address correlation delays that are significantly shorter .",
    "therefore we believe that this approach can provide more accurate measurements . in the present example , although the scanning period is limited to 1  ms , scanning fcs cross correlation data have been obtained for delays down to 0.25  ms .",
    "given a scanning period , the limitation for the short delays is now constituted by the crosstalk between the two channels .",
    "the full potential of dual spot scanning fcs will be addressed in a dedicated article .",
