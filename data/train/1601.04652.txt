    "it is known @xcite that the probability @xmath10 that the position of the rightmost particle @xmath11 is concentrated around @xmath12 .",

    "these extensions of the bbm are expected to be described by noisy versions of the fkpp equation @xcite . in these noisy versions ,",
    "the main effect of the noise is to shift the velocity of the front @xcite and to make its position fluctuate @xcite .",
    "a phenomenological approach has been proposed in @xcite which gives a prediction for the cumulants of this position .",
    "our goal here is to understand the large _ positive _ deviations of this position .",
    "the case of large _ negative _ deviations ( studied in @xcite for branching random walks with coalescence ) would require a rather different approach and will not be discussed in this paper except for some comments in the conclusion ; in particular the large deviation function may depend on the number of particles one starts with .    in the present work we try to study how ( [ psi - bbm ] )",

    "this particle branches and diffuses like a usual branching brownian motion .",
    "the only difference with the usual bbm is that whenever a particle gets at a distance larger than @xmath0 from the rightmost particle , it is eliminated .",

    "this number of particles @xmath25 fluctuates but one can show ( see the discussion in section [ existence ] ) that the evolution of the @xmath0-bbm leads to a steady state where the event @xmath26 is recurrent .",

    "\\label{ld - lbbm}\\ ] ] one of our results ( see sections [ physical ] and [ proofs ] ) is the following upper bound for @xmath28 and large @xmath0 @xmath29 with @xmath30 where @xmath31 in ( [ res - lbbm ] ) and everywhere else in this paper , the symbol @xmath32 means that @xmath33 2 .",
    "* the @xmath1-bbm @xcite : * + in the @xmath1-bbm one starts as above with a single particle at @xmath20 which diffuses and branches but the size of the population can not exceed a fixed value @xmath1 .",
    "as long as the number of particles @xmath25 is less than @xmath1 the evolution is exactly the same as for the bbm .",
    "however , when @xmath34 , as soon as a new branching event occurs , the leftmost particle is eliminated so that the total number of particles remains subsequently equal to @xmath1 .",

    "in fact , as discussed in the conclusion , we believe that @xmath39 remains valid even for @xmath40 .",

    "in this section we explain a heuristic way of understanding the claims in the introduction .",
    "the main idea is rather similar for the three problems ( see figure 1 ) .",
    "consider first all the possible trees of a bbm which , starting with a single particle at the origin , contain at least one particle which reaches , at time @xmath4 , a position on the right of @xmath90 at time @xmath4 .",
    "here we focus on velocities @xmath91 ( for the bbm one knows that @xmath92 ) .",
    "the probability that the tree has at time @xmath4 at least one particle on the right of @xmath90 is ( [ ld - bbm],[psi - bbm ] ) for @xmath91 @xmath93 = \\exp \\left[t \\left(1- { v^2 \\over v_c^2 } \\right ) \\right ] \\ .\\ ] ] for each such tree event , we will call red particles all the particles which end up on the right of @xmath90 .",
    "given its position at time @xmath4 , the trajectory of a red particle is , up to a shift ( linear in time ) , a brownian bridge ( in fact it is more like a brownian excursion @xcite but this has no incidence on the discussion below ) .",
    "when one goes from the bbm to the @xmath0-bbm , a red particle will survive if between time @xmath94 and time @xmath4 no other particle of the bbm overtakes it by a distance @xmath0 .",
    "any tree of the bbm for which a red particle survives contributes to the event that the the rightmost particle of @xmath0-bbm is on the right of @xmath90 .",
    "so the probability that a tree of the bbm reaches position @xmath95 and that at least one red particle is never overtaken by any other particle of the bbm by a distance @xmath0 is a lower bound for the probablity that a @xmath0-bbm reaches position @xmath90 .",
    "this is why in the following , by estimating the survival probability of a red particle of a bbm , we will get an upper bound on the large deviation function ( [ ld - lbbm ] ) of the @xmath0-bbm .    as a red particle is moving on average faster than @xmath38 the only possibility for it to be killed is that for a relatively short time interval @xmath96 , i.e. a time @xmath97 , either this red particle moves slower than @xmath60 , or one of the other particles of the tree moves sufficiently fast to overtake it by a distance @xmath0 or both .",
    "so the picture is the following . a red particle moves at velocity @xmath60 . along its trajectory ,",
    "branching events occur which give rise to subtrees .",
    "this red particle is then killed if , shortly after one of these branching events , the red particle slows down and one of the particles of the subtree overtakes it by a distance @xmath0 .",
    "let us now be quantitative .",
