    "the virgo cluster is a fundamental milestone for the determination of @xmath5 because it is the nearest reasonably rich cluster which is tightly tied into the large - scale expansion field through excellent _ relative _ distances to more distant clusters , circumventing thus effects of local streaming velocities .    the distance of the virgo cluster has long been controversial mainly for three reasons . ( 1 )  the cluster which spans @xmath6 in the sky has a considerable depth effect making even good distance determinations of _ few _ member galaxies vulnerable to small - number effects .",
    "this becomes particularly precarious if the selection criteria of the few members are themselves distance - dependent .",
    "( 2 )  distance indicators with non - negligible intrinsic scatter lead always to too small distances if they are applied to only the brightest cluster members ( malmquist bias ) .",
    "this has made virgo cluster distances useless especially from the 21cm - line width ( tully - fisher ) method until a very deep virgo cluster catalogue became available ( binggeli , sandage , & tammann 1985 ) .",
    "the catalogue is _ complete _ as to normal e and spiral galaxies because it goes below the cutoff magnitude of these objects .",
    "( 3 )  undue weight has been given to distance indicators in the past which had never been tested in the relevant distance range .",
    "in the case of the bright tail of the luminosity function of planetary nebulae the ineffectiveness as distance indicator is now explained by the dependence on the sample ( i.e. galaxy ) size ( bottinelli et  al .",
    "1991 ; tammann 1993 ; mndez et  al . 1993",
    "; soffner et  al .",
    "1996 ) . the reasons why surface brightness fluctuations of e galaxies fail to provide useful absolute distances beyond @xmath7mpc are less clear .",
    "the applicability of the method to dwarf ellipticals is presently investigated ( jerjen , freeman , & binggeli 1998 ) .    with these difficulties in mind six different distance determinations of the virgo cluster are discussed in the following .",
    "cepheids are presently , through their period - luminosity ( pl ) relation , the most reliable and least controversial distance indicators .",
    "the slope and the zeropoint of the pl relation is taken from the very well - observed cepheids in the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) , whose distance modulus is adopted to be @xmath8 ( madore & freedman 1991 ) .    an old pl relation calibrated by galactic cepheids in open clusters , and",
    "now vindicated by hipparcos data ( sandage & tammann 1998 ) , gave @xmath9 ( sandage & tammann 1968 , 1971 ) .",
    "hipparcos data combined with more modern cepheid data give an even somewhat higher modulus ( feast & catchpole 1997 ) .",
    "reviews of cepheid distances ( federspiel , tammann , & sandage 1998 ; gratton 1999 ) cluster around @xmath10 ,  a value in perfect agreement with the purely geometrical distance determination of sn1987a ( @xmath11 ; gilmozzi & panagia 1999 ) . in his excellent review gratton ( 1999 ) concludes from the rich literature on rrlyr stars that @xmath12 .",
    "he also discusses five distance determination methods which give lower moduli by @xmath13mag , but they are still at a more experimental stage .",
    " there is therefore emerging evidence that the adopted lmc modulus of 18.50 is too small by @xmath14 or even @xmath15mag ( feast 1999 ) and that all cepheid distances in the following should be increased by this amount .",
    "there has been much debate about the possibility that the pl relation of cepheids depends on metallicity .",
    "evidence for a ( very ) weak metallicity dependence comes from the fact that the metal - rich galactic cepheids give perfectly reasonable distances for the moderately metal - poor lmc cepheids and the really metal - poor smc cepheids and , still more importantly , that their relative distances are wavelength - independent ( di benedetto 1997 ; cf .",

    "the resulting ( highly metal - insensitive ) pl relations in bolometric light have been transformed into pl relations at different wavelengths by means of detailed atmospheric models ; the conclusion is that any metallicity dependence of the pl relations is negligible ( sandage , bell , & tripicco 1998 ; alibert et  al .",
    "1999 ; cf . however bono , marconi , & stellingwerf 1998 , who strongly depend on the treatment of stellar convection ) .",
    "most extragalactic cepheid distances are now due to observations .",
    "the reduction of these observations is by no means simple .",
    "the photometric zeropoint , the linearity over the field , crowding , and cosmic rays raise technical problems .",
    "the quality of the derived distances depends further on ( variable ) internal absorption and the number of available cepheids in view of the finite width of the instability strip .",

    "( 1997 ) have proposed that the cepheid distances of the spiral galaxies ngc4501 and ngc4548 would be significant because these galaxies are spatially close to the virgo cluster center on the basis of their being stripped by the x - ray intracluster gas . in the case of ngc4548 there are some doubts because it is , like ngc4571 , exceptionally well resolved ( sandage & bedke 1988 ) . the resolution of ngc4501 is about intermediate between the two last - mentioned galaxies and the poorly resolved ngc4639 . a first rough distance of ngc4501 is provided by the tf method ( section  [ sec:4 ] ) which gives @xmath38 in good agreement with the preferred mean virgo cluster distance .",

    "there are two major clumpings a ( with m87 ) and b ( with m49 ) ( binggeli et  al .",

    "future determinations of the virgo cluster distance may include the brightness of the tip of the red - giant branch ( trgb ) .",
    "a first experiment is available ( harris et  al . 1998 ) , and if a sufficient number of cluster members will become available to beat the cluster depth effect the method may become competitive .    it has been argued many times that the recession velocity of the virgo cluster is too small to yield the cosmic value of the hubble constant @xmath5 .",
    "indeed the observed mean cluster velocity of @xmath161 , corrected to the centroid of the local group ( binggeli et  al .",
    "1993 ) and combined with the above cluster distance would provide too low a value of @xmath162 [ kms@xmath163mpc@xmath105 ] mainly due to the gravitational deceleration by the virgo complex . the virgocentric pull has decelerated the local group s recession velocity by @xmath165 ( kraan - korteweg 1986 ; tammann & sandage 1985 ; jerjen & tammann 1993 ) .",
    "@xmath5 becomes then rather 54 with some leeway as to remaining peculiar velocity effects .",
    "however the problem of the virgo cluster velocity can be entirely circumvented by using the distances of clusters out to @xmath166 _ relative _ to the virgo cluster ( sandage & tammann 1990 ; jerjen & tammann 1993 ; giovanelli 1997 ) .",
