    "to determine @xmath4 with good precision ( @xmath5 ) we must reach @xmath6 0.01 gev@xmath2 with an acceptance better than @xmath7 .      from the acceptance studies @xcite of the standard high-@xmath3 optics described in @xcite we could conclude that to have more than 50 % of acceptance for @xmath8 = 0.01 gev@xmath9 we need to improve the optics , i.e. we need to increase the effective distance , @xmath10 where @xmath11 .",
