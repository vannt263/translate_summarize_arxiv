    "edge magnetoplasmons ( emps ) in the two - dimensional electron system ( 2des ) have received much attention in recent years .",
    "experimental studies have been performed to determine the dispersion relation and the role of edge states in the transport properties of the 2des both on liquid helium@xcite as in high - mobility algaas - gaas heterostructures @xcite .",
    "the interest have even increased with the advent of time - resolved transport experiments @xcite . from a theoretical point of view , a lot of work have been also devoted to study the characteristics of these collective excitations propagating along the edge of the 2des in the presence of a normal magnetic field @xmath6 and different edge - wave mechanisms have been proposed @xcite .",
    "first , the emps dispersion were determined theoretically within essentially classical models @xcite in which the charge density varies at the edge , but the edge position of the 2des is kept constant .",
    "other , distinctly different , quantum - mechanical edge - wave mechanisms was proposed @xcite in which only the edge change and the density profile is taken as the unperturbed 2des with respect to the fluctuating edge .",
    "recently a microscopic model was proposed in refs.@xcite that effectively incorporates the edge - wave mechanisms mentioned above in the quantum hall effect ( qhe ) regime . even though emps have been studied in the limit of low temperatures @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the group velocity of the edge states and the magnetic length @xmath9 with @xmath10 , in the calculation of the current density @xmath11 was assumed that the components of the electric field @xmath12 of the wave are smooth on the @xmath13 scale . however , this assumption can not be well justified for emps at very low temperatures . here , we extend the approach of refs .",
    "@xcite for not - too - low temperatures , where @xmath14 . in this regime",
    "the typical scales of in - plane components of @xmath12 are of the order of @xmath15 , which is much larger than @xmath16 .    our model to treat emps consists in considering a 2des , of width @xmath17 , length @xmath18 , and negligible thickness , in the presence of a strong @xmath6 parallel to the @xmath19 axis , such that only the @xmath20 landau level ( ll ) is occupied .",
    "the 2des is confined along the @xmath21 axis by a parabolic potential at the edges given by @xmath22 , for @xmath23 , @xmath24 for @xmath25 , and @xmath26 for @xmath27 .",
    "we assume that the confinement is smooth on the scale of @xmath2 such that @xmath28 and @xmath29 such that it is reasonable to consider the emp along the right edge of the channel , in the form @xmath30 $ ] , totally independent of the left edge .",
    "we consider the qhe regime , at filling factors @xmath31 or @xmath32 in samples with areal dimensions sufficiently large , as it is typical in emp experiments .",
    "so , the inter - edge electron transitions and the inter - edge coulomb interaction can be neglected . at @xmath31 ,",
    "we assume that the spin - splitting , caused by many - body effects , is strong enough to neglect the contribution from the upper spin - split ll . at @xmath32",
    ", we neglect spin - splitting .",
    "there are at least two essential aspects to take into account in order to determine the dispersion relation as well the spatial structures of the emps , one is the role of dissipation even in the qhe regime .",
    "recently it was shown , for sufficiently smooth confinement , that the dissipation comes from the intralevel - intraedge electronic transitions due to scattering by piezoelectric phonons and occurs mainly near the edges of the channel @xcite . in the linear response regime , this is the main dissipation mechanism if @xmath33 , the speed of sound , _",
    "i.e_. , for channels of width @xmath34 m and @xmath35 k. the dissipation in the bulk is exponentially suppressed for @xmath36 .",
    "so , the properties of the emps must be strongly modified when the dissipation is localized near the edges in comparison with previous works in which the dissipation occurs homogeneously over the channel width @xcite .",
    "the second point is the profile of the unperturbed electron density @xmath37 across the edge .",
    "it was shown that the introduction of a smooth @xmath38 , considered in ref .",
    "@xcite , leads to the appearance of new acoustic modes in addition to those found in ref .",
    "@xcite in which the electron density drops abruptly at the edge . in fig . 1",
    ", we compare our calculated unperturbed density profile @xmath38 with the volkov - mikhailov@xcite and aleiner - glazman@xcite models .",
    "notice that @xmath39 is presented on the scale of @xmath40 near the edge instead of @xmath2 , as in fig . 1 of ref .",
    "our calculated exact density profile @xmath41 ( solid curve ) , where @xmath42 is the bulk value , is shown together with that of refs .",
    "@xcite ( short - dashed curve ) and @xcite ( dotted curve ) .",
    "the dash - dotted curve represents our approximate density profile given by @xmath43/2 $ ] , where @xmath44 .",
    "as we can see , our analytical profile is very close to the exact one in the actual region if the condition @xmath45 is fulfilled , where the characteristics edge wave number @xmath46 , with @xmath47 being the fermi energy measured from the bottom of the @xmath20 ll , or @xmath48 .",
    "the density profile in the aleiner - glazman model is obtained taking @xmath49 and @xmath50 which corresponds approximately to @xmath51  .",
    "as it can be seen , our density profiles are very different from the other ones . for the calculation of the solid curve ,",
    "the chosen parameters , related to gaas - based heterostructures , are @xmath52 t , @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 k , @xmath56 and taking @xmath57 such that @xmath58 cm / sec .",
    "we will show that the combination of our density profile and the fact that dissipation is localized near the edge leads to strong modifications of the emp behavior .",
    "these changes as well as the new emps resulting from the present microscopic approach in the regime of not - too - low temperatures are the subject of this work .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , for completeness , we present the expressions for the inhomogeneous current densities and conductivities for not - too - low temperatures and in the quasi - static regime following the treatment given in ref .",
    "we also obtain the general equation for the emps with dissipation at the edges .",
    "in contrast with emps at very low @xmath59 , we neglect the nonlocal contributions to the current density@xcite since their spatial structure is smooth in the scale of @xmath2 .",
    "further , in sec .",
    "iii , we elaborate on the integral equations for symmetric and antisymmetric emps and devise a method to solve them . in sec.iv",
    "we derive the dispersion relations and charge - density amplitudes of the symmetric and antisymmetric emps and describe in detail the new edge waves . finally , in sec .",
    "v , we compare our theory with experiment and make concluding remarks .",
    "in the low - frequency limit ( @xmath60 for the emp , the current density can be calculated in the quasi - static approximation and using the fact that wavelength @xmath61 cm and the characteristic scale along @xmath21 is typically of the order of @xmath62 for not - too - low @xmath59 ( this condition can be broken only for very high multi - pole modes ) .",
