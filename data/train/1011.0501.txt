    "recently , nonlinear coherent state and squeezed state have drew lots of attentions of physicists .",
    "filho and vogel @xcite defined the nonlinear coherent states as the right eigenstate of a generalized annihilation , whose concrete definition will be given in the following paragraph .",
    "they possessed not only some of the typical features of the standard coherent states but also the strong non - classical properties .",
    "b. roy and p. roy @xcite used displaced - operator technique to discover a new nonlinear coherent sates .",
    "its non - classical properties , such as quadrature squeezing , amplitude - squared squeezing and sub - poissonian behavior , was studied intensively .",
    "subsequently , kwek and kiang @xcite researched its nonlinear extension of the single - mode squeezed states and showed its sub - poissonian behavior .",
    "the above paragraph reviewed the developments of the nonlinear coherent and squeezed state , now we pay attention to the evolution of geometric phases .",
    "in retrospect , it is discovered by berry @xcite in the context of adiabatic , unitary , cyclic evolution of time - dependent quantum system .",
    "besides of the significance of physics , it also has a geometrical interpretation which is given by simon @xcite .",
    "it can be regarded as the holonomy of a line bundle @xmath1 over the space of parameters @xmath2 of the system , if @xmath1 is endowed with a natural connection .",
    "berry s result was generalized by aharonov and anandan @xcite via discarding the assumption of adiabaticity .",
    "the aharonov and anandan phase ( a - a phase ) could be obtained by the difference between the total phase and the dynamical one as well as be determined by the loop integral of a natural connection on a @xmath3 principle fiber bundle over projective hilbert space .",
    "afterwards , a - a phase was also generalized by samuel and bhandari @xcite . specifically speaking , depending on pancharatnam s earlier work @xcite , they found a more general phase in the context of non - cyclic and non - unitary quantal evolution .",
    "however , their definition is an indirect one , which depends on a geodesic closing the initial and the final points of the open path .",
    "moreover , it is not manifestly gauge invariant . soon pati @xcite gave another definition without the need of geodesic , where a canonical one - form was defined and its line integral gave the geometric phase .",
    "it is manifestly invariant under phase and gauge transformation .",
    "however , when the initial and final states are orthogonal , the above non - cyclic geometric phases become undefined .",
    "manini and pistolesi @xcite introduced abelian off - diagonal geometric phases under the condition of adiabatic evolution .",

    "@xcite generalized the concepts without the confinement of adiabaticity .",

    "al . @xciteextended the conceptions to the non - abelian cases .",
    "another line of development of geometric phase is the generalization to mixed states .",

    "@xcite addressed the non - degenerate geometric phase in non - cyclic and unitary evolution under the background of quantum interference .",
    "some other extensions @xcite were also made .",
    "including applications of the geometric phases in many areas of physics @xcite , new perspectives such as topological quantum computing @xcite and phase control @xcite were opened as well .",
    "based on the formulation given by pati @xcite , the present paper aims at giving non - cyclic and non - unitary geometric phases of nonlinear coherent and squeezed states .",

    "in addition , some of its features are discussed . at the end of this paper ,",
    "a conclusion is drawn .",
    "for nonlinear coherent states , the generalized annihilation and creation operators are introduced by@xmath5 where @xmath6 is the harmonic oscillator annihilation ( creation ) operator , @xmath7 , and @xmath8 is a reasonably well behaved real function . @xmath9 and @xmath10 satisfy the following nonlinear algebra@xmath11=(n+1)f^{2}(n+1)-nf^{2}(n).\\label{eq : commutator}\\ ] ] so we can construct the coherent operator , i.e. , @xmath12 however , because of eq .",
    ", we ca nt apply bch disentangling theorem to obtain the coherent operator @xcite .",
    "so we construct another two operators @xmath13 and @xmath14 which have the following commutation relations@xmath15=1\\ ] ] and@xmath16=1,\\ ] ] where @xmath17 and @xmath18 . as a result",
    ", the coherent state operators @xcite can be constructed as@xmath19 and@xmath20 it is worthy of note that the above two operators are not unitary .",
    "when both of them act on the vacuum state , we can get two coherent states which are@xmath21 and@xmath22 via bch theorem .",
    "both of them are represented in the energy eigenstates , i.e.,@xmath23 and@xmath24 where @xmath25 if @xmath26 takes a particular form , the first nonlinear coherent state @xmath27 is regarded as stationary states of a center of mass motion of a trapped and bi - chromatically laser - driven ion far from the so - called lamb - dicke regime . by comparison with the standard coherent states ,",
    "the nonlinear counterparts exhibit non - classical properties such as strong amplitude squeezing and self - splitting into two or more sub - states , which finally give birth to quantum interferences @xcite .",
    "with respect to the second nonlinear coherent state @xmath28 , it still displays various non - classical properties such as quadrature squeezing , amplitude - squared squeezing and sub - poissonian behaviour @xcite .",
    "furthermore , kwek and kiang @xcite pointed out that the squeezed operators could be defined as@xmath29\\ ] ] and@xmath30.\\ ] ] by the same procedure , when the above two operators act on the vacuum state , one can get the so - called squeezed states , i.e.,@xmath31|0\\rangle\\ ] ] and@xmath32|0\\rangle.\\ ] ] if the above two states are expanded in the energy eigenstates , we can find that they coincide with each other , that is to say,@xmath33 where @xmath34 is an indefinite coefficient and @xmath35 . by the way , the following formulas maybe useful in expanding the squeezed states , which are@xmath36a\\exp\\left[-\\frac{1}{2}(\\zeta b^{\\dagger2}-\\zeta^{*}a^{2})\\right]=\\cosh(r)a - e^{i\\varphi}\\sinh(r)b^{\\dagger}\\ ] ] and@xmath37b\\exp\\left[-\\frac{1}{2}(\\zeta a^{\\dagger2}-\\zeta^{*}b^{2})\\right]=\\cosh(r)b - e^{i\\varphi}\\sinh(r)a^{\\dagger}.\\ ] ] moreover , it is pointed out that unlike the normal squeezed states , the mandel q number of the non - linear case is negative and as a consequence it exhibits sub - poissonian statistics .    the above paragraphs are about nonlinear coherent and squeezed states . and",
    "it is well - known that the operators are non - unitary .",
    "hence , to calculate the geometric phases , we must know the methods of calculating the non - unitary case , which are reviewed in the following paragraphs .",
    "moreover , it is also applied to non - cyclic evolution .    for a non - cyclic evolution , a way must be found to compare two different quantal state . according to pancharatnam connection @xcite",
    ", the total phase @xcite can be formulated as @xmath38 where @xmath39 denotes the norm of the state vector @xmath40 and @xmath41 represents @xmath42 . and the dynamical phase can be written as@xmath43 hence the geometric phase @xcite reads@xmath44 in order to spell out the geometric aspects of the above equation , pati @xcite introduce the reference section which is@xmath45 in order to understand the above definition , we give a brief outline of fiber bundles . a quantum state @xmath46 and a relative phase",
    "are represented by a point of projective hilbert space @xmath47 and a circle @xmath3 respectively .",
    "take the cartesian product of @xmath47 and @xmath3 as well as define a projection map @xmath48 , where @xmath49 .",
    "hence , we can regard the triple @xmath50 as a fiber bundle , in which @xmath47 and @xmath3 are termed the base space and the fiber respectively .",
    "furthermore , the evolution of quantum state @xmath51 can generate a curve in @xmath47 .",
    "then , there exists another map @xmath52 such that the image @xmath53 of curve @xmath54 lies in the fiber over @xmath46 , i.e. , @xmath55 . and the map is called section .",
    "it is easy to know @xmath56 is a section of the fiber bundle @xmath57 .",
    "if @xmath56 is going to be defined as reference section , it has to satisfy the following condition that @xmath58 is always real and positive during the evolution , in another word the two state vectors are in phase , which is in accordance with the pancharatnam condition . moreover , by use of eq .",
    ", the non - cyclic and non - unitary geometric phase @xcite could be expressed as@xmath59 it is not very complex to verify that the geometric phase is independent of the choice of the phase of the quantum system state @xmath40 , reparametrization invariant and manifestly gauge invariant .",
    "furthermore the geometric phase could reduce to berry phase and a - a phase under a appropriate limit .    up to now , we have already reviewed both the nonlinear coherent and squeezed state , as well as non - cyclic and non - unitary geometric phase .",
    "hence we can research further on the geometric phases of nonlinear coherent and squeezed states .",
    "at any time @xmath60 , the first coherent state vector is given by@xmath61 where @xmath62 and we set @xmath63 for simplicity . in order to calculate the corresponding geometric phase",

    "it is regarded as the result of parallel transport with pancharatnam connection @xcite , which uncover the geometric meaning .",
    "furthermore , let s discuss about the above geometric phase .",
    "except for the general properties of geometric phase , such as reparametrization invariance and manifest gauge invariance under the gauge transformation @xmath74 @xcite , where @xmath75 is integer , let s discuss other ones . to begin with , when @xmath76 , the nonlinear coherent state is reduced to the normal coherent state , so is the corresponding geometric phase .",
    "it takes this form@xmath77 which coincides with the result @xcite .",
    "moreover , if the quantum state undergoes cyclic evolution , the geometric phase becomes@xmath78^{2}n!}\\frac{1}{[f(n+1)]^{2}}}{\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty}\\frac{|\\beta|^{2n}}{[f(n)!]^{2}n!}}~mod~2\\pi.\\ ] ] in addition , let s focus on the non - locality of eq . .",
    "pati @xcite has proved that the geometric phase along the geodesic is equal to zero .",
    "hence , if we join the end points by a geodesic , the line integral can be converted to a surface integral by stokes s theorem .",
    "so the non - locality for this specific problem is unveiled .",
    "finally , if the different nonlinear function @xmath26 is chosen , we will get different geometric phase . in this paper",
    ", we choose @xmath79^{-1},\\label{eq : nonlinearfunction}\\ ] ] which is important to describe the motion of a ion in a harmonic potential and interaction with two laser fields @xcite .",
    "@xmath80 are generalized laguerre polynomials which are characterized by the lamb - dicke parameter @xmath81 .",
    "to get some ideas about the evolution of the geometric phase with respect to time @xmath82 , we show it in fig .",
    ", where we choose @xmath83 and @xmath84 .",
    "all of these curves vary non - linearly with time in contrast with dynamical phases , which vary linearly with time .",
    "this is a main difference between the geometric phases and the dynamical ones .",
    "when @xmath85 , @xmath76 , so that the geometric phase of non - linear coherent states reduce to the standard case , which is shown in curve @xmath86 in the fig . .",
    "it is illustrated that when @xmath81 increases , the corresponding graph varies acutely .",
    "so we can conclude that non - linear functions tagged by @xmath81 in this case affect the geometric phase dramatically .",
    "the different functions @xmath26 in accord with different parameter @xmath81 sped the evolution of the geometric phase up or down , which make the evolution completely different .",
    "so @xmath81 can be regarded as a non - linear parameter which modulate the evolution of the corresponding geometric phase .",
    "hence , it probably has potential applications in controlling or measuring geometric phase .    when we set @xmath83 and @xmath84 , the geometric phase @xmath87 with respect to time @xmath82 according to eq .",
    "together with eq . is shown for various values of @xmath81 .",
    "( a ) , @xmath85 ; ( b ) , @xmath88 ; ( c ) , @xmath89 ; ( d ) , @xmath90 . ]    in the above paragraphs , we have discussed the above non - unitary and non - cyclic geometric phase of the first nonlinear coherent state .",
    "now let s study the counterpart of another nonlinear coherent state . for @xmath60 , the time evolution of the state vector reads@xmath91 by similar calculation , we can obtain the geometric phase , which is@xmath92^{2}}{n!}\\sin(e_{n}t)}{\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty}\\frac{|\\beta|^{2n}[f(n)!]^{2}}{n!}\\cos(e_{n}t)}+\\omega t\\left\\ { \\frac{1}{2}+|\\beta|^{2}\\frac{\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty}\\frac{|\\beta|^{2n}[f(n)!]^{2}}{n!}[f(n+1)]^{2}}{\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty}\\frac{|\\beta|^{2n}[f(n)!]^{2}}{n!}}\\right\\ } ~mod~2\\pi.\\label{eq : geometricphaseofthesecondcoherentstate}\\ ] ] in short , the similar properties with the above case are ignored .",
    "let s concentrate on the special ones .",
    "at first , let s consider the distinction between the geometric phase of the first nonlinear coherent state and the second one .",
    "it is not very hard to observe that @xmath26 which is the mark of the non - linearity is in the denominator position in the first case , whereas it becomes in the numerator position in the second case .",
    "so the geometric phase plays the pole of a criterion , which tell the geometric difference of the two coherent states .",
    "moreover , if @xmath76 , eq . is also reduced to the normal case . in addition , while @xmath93 go through cyclic evolution , the geometric phase is transformed to be@xmath94^{2}}{n!}[f(n+1)]^{2}}{\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty}\\frac{|\\beta|^{2n}[f(n)!]^{2}}{n!}}~mod~2\\pi.\\ ] ] last but not least , again in order to get the ideas of eq . , we show it in fig . .",
    "for the sake of comparison with fig . , we set the parameters @xmath95 and @xmath96 the same values as the previous case .",
    "again we can see the impact of @xmath26 , which is shown in curve @xmath97 , @xmath98 and @xmath99 .",
    "taking a glance at curves @xmath98 and @xmath99 , we can know there exist non - liner functions that makes the evolution of the geometric phase extremely slow .",
    "so in contrast with the geometric phase of normal coherent state , it maybe more convenient to measure and control the geometric phase precisely in experiments .",
    "when we set @xmath83 and @xmath84 , the geometric phase @xmath87 with respect to time @xmath82 according to eq . together with eq .",
    "is shown for various values of @xmath81 .",
    "( a ) , @xmath85 ; ( b ) , @xmath88 ; ( c ) , @xmath89 ; ( d ) , @xmath90 . ]",
    "in the previous section , the geometric phases of the two non - linear coherent states are obtained respectively .",
    "now , in this section , we will research the counterpart of squeezed states .",
    "however , the two non - linear squeezed states coincide with each other .",
    "so we can concentrate on one case , whose state vector of time evolution has this form@xmath100 where @xmath101 firstly , let s focus on the first fraction of the reference section , which is expressed as@xmath102,\\label{eq : firstfractionofsqueezedstate}\\ ] ] where @xmath65 represents the total phase .",

    "in addition , if we join the end - points of the open curve by geodesics , by use of stock s theorem , the line integral is converted to be surface integral , which unmask the non - locality of geometric phase of the state . at last ,",
