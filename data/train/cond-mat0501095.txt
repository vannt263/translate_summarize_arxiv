    "in the study of ultracold dilute atomic gases , the interparticle interactions are characterized by the @xmath0-wave scattering length @xmath1 . because of the low temperatures achieved , and the lack of long range or anisotropic interactions",
    ", the value of @xmath1 determines a wide variety of equilibrium and dynamical properties of quantum degenerate gases .",
    "furthermore the parameter @xmath1 can be tuned in many systems , from @xmath2 to @xmath3 by means of feshbach resonances @xcite , allowing the experimenter access to any desired interaction strength .",
    "this potential for real - time control over interactions is a unique feature of ultracold gas experiments .",
    "additionally the efficiency of evaporative cooling relies on a large elastic collision rate , which is proportional to @xmath4 . for these reasons ,",
    "the ability to accurately determine the scattering properties of dilute ultracold gases becomes essential for quantum gas experiments .    in their pioneering work with ultracold @xmath5cs atoms , monroe and co - workers showed that a relatively simple rethermalization measurement starting with a non - equilibrium gas could provide a determination of the elastic collision cross - section  @xcite , which is equal to @xmath6 for identical non - condensed bosons .",
    "the rethermalization rate for a gas in the so - called collisionless regime ( defined by a collision rate per particle much lower than the harmonic frequencies of the trapping potential ) , was measured by selectively removing energy from the gas in one spatial dimension and watching the subsequent cross - dimensional rethermalization .",
    "the relaxation in such experiments is driven by elastic collisions , and an analysis based on enskog s equation shows that the rate of relaxation is proportional to the mean rate of collisions @xcite , @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the number density of the gas , @xmath9 is the elastic collision cross - section , and @xmath10 is the relative collision speed ; brackets @xmath11 denote a thermal average , and we have used the assumptions of energy - independent @xmath0-wave collisions and boltzmann statistics to write the mean collision rate @xmath12 .",
    "the constant of proportionality @xmath13 , defined as the ratio of collision and relaxation rates , reflects the mean number of collisions per particle required for rethermalization .",
    "a variety of numerical and analytical studies have found that @xmath13 is between @xmath14 and @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "we have recently extended the method of cross - dimensional relaxation to probe the @xmath0-wave scattering length @xmath16 between bosonic and fermionic atoms in a bose - fermi mixture @xcite . in that work ,",
    "we compared single - species boson rethermalization to relaxation of fermions in the presence of bosons in order to eliminate the systematic calibration error associated with atom number that typically dominates cross - dimensional rethermalization measurements .",
    "since collisions between spin - polarized ultracold fermions are forbidden by the pauli exclusion principle @xcite , their rethermalization proceeds only through collisions with the bosons .",
    "the collision rate per fermion in the mixture therefore depends only on the number of bosons , allowing us to write the mean relaxation rate per fermion in analogy with the single - species case , @xmath17 here @xmath18 is the equilibrium density of the bosons , averaged over the fermion distribution , @xmath19 is the boson - fermion elastic cross section , and is the thermally averaged relative collision speed between bosons and fermions with reduced mass and temperature @xmath20 ( @xmath21 is boltzmann s constant ) .",
    "the cross - section is related to the interspecies scattering length by @xmath22 .",
    "the constant of proportionality @xmath23 reflects the mean number of collisions per fermion needed for rethermalization .",
    "knowledge of @xmath13 and @xmath23 was essential in achieving both the accuracy and precision of the measurement in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in this work ,",
    "we study the general dependence of @xmath23 on the masses of the fermions and bosons by means of detailed classical monte carlo simulations of the relaxation process .",
    "we additionally address the effect due to the finite initial departure from equilibrium . understanding this effect is a necessary component of the analysis of both the simulations and the measurements , where a larger initial perturbation improves the signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "we further develop a classical kinetic model based on enskog s equation for the case of bose - fermi mixtures that reproduces the behavior of the simulations .",
    "the analysis and simulations show the following : ( i ) equation ( [ eq : gammaf ] ) is valid for a wide range of parameters relevant to current experiments , ( ii ) the difference in mass between the bosons and fermions can lead to a @xmath24 times difference in @xmath23 between light and heavy fermions in mixtures of experimental interest , and ( iii ) the size of the initial perturbation must be taken into account to fully understand the results .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : montecarlo ] we describe the details of the monte carlo simulations and use the simulations to verify the validity of eq.([eq : gammaf ] ) . in sec .",
    "[ sec : model ] the mass dependence of the relaxation is investigated using the simulations and compared to a classical kinetic theory that is developed in some detail .",
    "it is shown that the model reproduces the behavior of the simulations over a wide range of masses . in sec .",
    "[ sec : discussion ] the importance of the size of the initial perturbation is addressed . finally , we conclude in sec . [",
    "sec : conclusion ] with a discussion of possible extensions of the model and further applications of the monte carlo simulations .",
    "implicit in the definition of @xmath23 in eq.([eq : gammaf ] ) are the assumptions that the energy anisotropy undergoes exponential decay @xcite and that @xmath23 depends only on intrinsic properties of the particles under study , such as the mass and quantum statistics , and not the bulk properties of the gases , such as the temperature or atom numbers ( assuming one remains always in the collisionless regime ) .",
    "these assumptions were verified by running monte carlo simulations of the relaxation .    in the experiment considered here , we start with a bose - fermi mixture that is in thermal equilibrium in a cylindrically symmetric harmonic trap and increase the radial trapping frequency by a factor of @xmath25 to produce the initial energy anisotropy in the system ; the axial frequency is unchanged .",
    "the change in trap strength is performed slowly with respect to the radial trap periods but quickly compared to the thermal relaxation time . the increase in radial energies",
    "@xmath26 is then the same for each species and is equal to the fractional increase in the trapping frequencies .",
    "therefore the ratio of radial and axial energies immediately before rethermalization is simply @xmath27 note that for gases prepared in this manner , @xmath28 at all times .",
    "since the gases rethermalize together , they reach the same final temperature . in the classical gas limit",
    ", the final temperature is given by @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the temperature before compression .",
    "it is important to note that for this type of rethermalization , there is no net transfer of energy between species during the relaxation process ; this fact is essential for the validity of eq.([eq : gammaf ] ) .",
    "an outline of the monte carlo simulation is as follows .",
    "an ensemble consisting of @xmath31 bosons and @xmath32 fermions is prepared in a cylindrically symmetric harmonic trapping potential .",
    "the ensemble is initialized by assigning a random position and velocity vector to each particle from separable gaussian distributions .",
    "the distributions are scaled such that there is a factor of @xmath25 imbalance between the mean energies per particle ( both kinetic and potential ) in the transverse ( @xmath33 ) and axial ( @xmath34 ) dimensions . the initial energy in a given dimension , however , is the same for both species .",
    "the positions and velocities are evolved for some small time step @xmath35 according to newton s laws in the trap , and then collisions are considered .",
    "only boson - boson and boson - fermion collisions are allowed , in accordance with the pauli exclusion principle for a system with spin - polarized fermions .",
    "if two particles are found within a critical distance @xmath36 of each other , the pair is given a chance to collide .",
    "the collision probability is given by @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is the collision cross section between particles @xmath39 and @xmath40 , @xmath41 is the relative collision speed , and @xmath42 is the volume of the sphere containing the colliding atoms . if @xmath43 is greater than a uniformly distributed random number between zero and one , then the relative velocity vector is rotated into a random direction ( conserving the total momentum and energy ) to represent an @xmath0-wave collision . finally , after all possible collision pairs have been considered ,",
    "the mean energies of each species in each of the three cartesian directions are recorded , and a new time step proceeds .    in agreement with ref.@xcite",
    "we find it essential for obtaining robust results to set @xmath35 and @xmath36 such that the ensemble average collision probability @xmath44 and occupation of the fictional spheres surrounding the atoms are both well below @xmath45 .",
    "typical values for our simulations are @xmath46 to @xmath47 times the collision time @xmath48 , and @xmath49 to @xmath47 times the root - mean - squared ( rms ) cloud radius . since the motion between collisions is known analytically , it is not necessary to keep @xmath35 small compared to the trap period .",
    "finally , we note that we have not observed any double - counting of collisions in consecutive time steps .",
    "this is because our time step @xmath35 typically satisfies @xmath50 , where @xmath51 is the characteristic speed of the particles .    a typical relaxation curve obtained from the simulation is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : decay ] .",
    "the relaxation rate @xmath52 of the energy anisotropy of the fermions is determined by fitting the ratio of radial and axial energies to the ratio of decaying exponentials , @xmath53 here , @xmath54 is the mean total energy per particle of the fermions in the @xmath55 direction , and @xmath56 characterizes the amount of initial perturbation from equilibrium .     in each direction is shown versus time during the equilibration process .",

    "the results show that @xmath52 varies linearly with @xmath31 , while it is constant when changing @xmath32 over the same range .",

    "[ fig : barchart ] were obtained for @xmath63 , corresponding to a ratio of cross - sections @xmath64 and @xmath65 , respectively .     as a function of @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "these calculations used the parameters from the @xmath59rb-@xmath58k experiment in ref.@xcite , with @xmath60 .",
    "[ fig : barchart ] ]",
    "the monte carlo simulation is a powerful tool for analyzing the behavior of relaxing bose - fermi mixtures , but it requires a considerable amount of computing resources . for example , one of our simulations using @xmath66 fermions and @xmath66 bosons with @xmath66 time steps took over 8 hours on a unix system with a @xmath67 ghz processor and 4 gb of ram .",
    "the computation time , which is dominated by the pairwise search for collision partners , scales roughly as the product of the number of time steps and @xmath68 , so that simulations become impractical for @xmath69 .",
    "furthermore , it is desirable to build up a physical picture of the relaxation that is not provided by the simulations . for these reasons ,",
    "we now consider an analytic model of the rethermalization .",
    "one new degree of freedom for two - species rethermalization is the appearance of a second mass . in order to see how the number of collisions per fermion needed for rethermalization depends on the masses of the particles involved ,",
    "we first consider the two limiting cases of very light and very heavy fermions .",
    "recall that energy is redistributed by means of @xmath0-wave collisions , which randomize the relative velocities of the colliding particles .",
    "for very light fermions , a single collision should be nearly enough to redistribute the energy .",
    "if the fermions are far heavier than the bosons , however , it should take many collision times to redistribute the energy , since a single collision has little effect on the motion of the heavy particle .",
    "we therefore expect the number of collisions needed for equilibration to be a monotonically increasing function of the normalized fermion mass @xmath70 . note that this is in contrast to the behavior of two gases initially at different ( isotropic ) temperatures and subsequently brought into contact for rethermalization . in the latter case ,",

    "[ fig : massdep ] ]    our analysis of the rethermalization process is based on enskog s equation , which is equivalent to the boltzmann transport equation @xcite .",
    "this treatment gives the rate of change of the ensemble average of any function of the boson and fermion positions and velocities , usually denoted @xmath76 , by @xmath77 where we have again used the assumption of energy - independent @xmath0-wave scattering to separate the collision cross - section @xmath9 from the ensemble average .",
    "the quantity @xmath78 is just the change in @xmath79 due to a single collision .",

    "also that @xmath95 for a gas with a cross - dimensional energy anisotropy .    calculating these ensemble averages for arbitrary masses and energy anisotropies ( which are in general different between species ) is non - trivial , but some simple approximations may be used . for the first term it is easy to show that for boltzmann distributions in equilibrium one has @xmath96 for cross - terms of the form @xmath97 , which vanish under equilibrium conditions , one can still consider the limit of small deviation from thermal equilibrium . in this case",
    "we obtain , similar to the above result , @xmath98 we verified by analytic means and with monte carlo integrations of gaussian distributions that these approximations are reasonable for small anisotropies .    combining these results",
