    "silicon photomultipliers ( sipm ) are arrays of microcells of avalanche photo diodes ( apd ) connected in parallel and operated in geiger mode .",
    "they are characterized by timing of the order of @xmath4ns , with recovery times comparable to those of conventional phototubes .",
    "their gain factors of @xmath5 make them proper detectors for the detection of single photons hitting their active surface .",
    "their compactness and robustness allow to easily deploy sipm sensors on wide area telescope focal planes .",
    "their endurances to the night sky background light will allow to extend the telescope duty cycles acquiring quality data also during bright moon nights .",
    "sipm are therefore ideal sensors to equip the cta telescope cameras .",
    "sipm sensors have been developed by fbk@xcite in cooperation with infn as a proposal to equip the focal plane of cta telescopes .",
    "the latest sensor technology is based on 6x6mm@xmath6 p@xmath7-n sipms with microcell area of 30x30@xmath8 , sensitive to uv light and with breakdown voltages of @xmath428v , named high density nuv ( nuv - hd , figure[fig : sipm ] ) .",
    "the sensors have been characterized in the clean room and laboratory tests with pulsed uv sources and in dark conditions , using a transimpedence amplifier asd - ep - eb - n developed by advansid for the evaluation of the fbk sensor performances@xcite .",
    "the devices show competitive performances with respect to commercial devices , with a photon detection efficiency ( pde ) better than 40% in the expected uv signal range , single photoelectron noise rate below 100khz / mm@xmath9 at operating temperature and an optimal signal / noise for single photoelectron detection ( figure[fig : perf ] ) .",
    "the nuv - hd sipm sensors described in the previous section have been selected to assemble a possible upgrade of the focal plane camera of the prototype schwarzschild - couder telescope ( psct)@xcite , a cta medium size telescope ( mst ) prototype that will be operated at the fred lawrence whipple laboratory in arizona ( us ) in 2017 . the current camera design is based on hamamatsu s12642 - 0404pa-50(x ) mppc modules .",
    "the improved sensitivity measured for the nuv - hd sipm sensors has driven the efforts to integrate this technology to the psct camera .",
    "infn together with italian universities has designed and developed multi - sipm modules compatible with the already existing psct camera mechanics and readout .",
    "each module is made of four independent units ( or quadrants ) , each equipped with 16 nuv - hd sipms .",
    "the units have been designed to cover a 26.9x26.9mm@xmath9 area , corresponding to 53.8x53.8mm@xmath9 area of each module .",
    "each 64 sipm module will be arranged in a chessboard geometry with a module - module distance of 200@xmath10 m .",
    "the mechanical layout of the 16 sipm pcb is shown in figure[fig : pcb ] . with this configuration ,",
    "the module pitch is 54 mm , while the sensor pitch is 6.75 mm , equally distributed all over the camera area .",
    "the nominal distance between sensor edges amounts to 510@xmath10 m .",
    "the bias voltage is applied at the back common cathode of all the 16 sensors , while the signal of each sensor is individually readout through a wire - bond connection between a conductive pad placed on the sensor edges and a bonding pad placed on the pcb and in conductive connection with the back of the pcb .    before the placement of sipms ,",
    "the pcb are thermally coupled to the copper blocks used as mechanical structure of the pcb and to radiate excess heat produced by the electronics .",
    "this step is crucial to achieve the best possible alignment of the modules when assembled in the camera mechanics .",
    "custom mechanical holders with holes and position pins allow to achieve a 50@xmath10 m accuracy for the alignment in the xy plane .",
    "a  pick & place \" machine is used to dispense the conductive glue to the pcb top layer metal pads and place the sipm sensors on the pcb .",
    "some examples of the products of assembly tests are shown in figure[fig : matrix ] .",
    "preliminary tests to validate the accuracy of the pick & place machine have shown a sensor alignment better than @xmath11 and a board flatness better than @xmath12 , well within the requirements ( figure[fig : alignment ] ) .",
    "after the sipm placement , the 16 sensor bonding pads are wire bonded to the pcb bonding pads and then tested to check the quality of the conductive connections .",
    "the characteristic current - voltage ( iv ) curves of each sensor of the unit are measured in series using a custom switching matrix with digital control of the multiplexer .",
    "an example of iv curves for 16 sensors of one unit is shown in figure[fig : iv ] . + a layer of uv transparent epoxy",
    "is finally dispensed over the sipm to protect the wire bonds and the sensor surface . since the uv light absorption probability increases with depth",
    ", the epoxy layer has to be dispensed with the highest possible level of uniformity over all the module , avoiding border effects .",
    "preliminary tests of epoxy deposition and transmittance are currently ongoing , with encouraging prospectives .",
    "to validate the camera concept , 9 quadrants of the psct camera will be initially equipped with the camera solution described in the previous section .",
    "a total of 100 modules , corresponding to 1600 sipm sensors , will be tested in the infn laboratories and a selection of 36 modules will be mounted on the psct camera .",
    "a daq system based on a 16-channel charge amplifier has been developed for this purpose . a pole - zero cancellation circuit , optimized to achieve a 20 ns pulse with an amplitude of 4mv / p.e . and to minimize the electronics signal offset , is applied to reshape the signal@xcite .",
    "the output signal of the preamplifier board is subsequently readout with a v792 qdc module .",
    "preliminary tests of the preamplifier performances have been performed on a 16-channel prototype unit using a pulsed 380 nm light@xcite .",
    "the response of each single sensor has been studied by covering all other channel with a custom mask .",
    "the results show an evident quantization of the signal down to the single photoelectron , with a signal / noise ratio of @xmath45 .",
    "subsequently , the whole daq system has been tested illuminating the whole unit and acquiring the 16 signals with the qdc module .",
    "the signal is integrated over a time window of 100ns .",
    "each adc channel corresponds to a charge of @xmath4100pc .",
    "the results show a good uniformity in the response of the 16-channel unit , with a slightly lower gain and signal / noise ratio probably introduced by the intrinsic impedences of the setup ( see figure[fig:16chan ] ) .",
    "further efforts are ongoing to optimize and calibrate the daq setup towards the massive 1600 sensor tests .",
    "sipm sensors present suitable properties to equip the focal planes of imaging air cherenkov telescope cameras , allowing to improve the camera performance with respect to the use of standard photomultipliers .",
    "the latest technology achieved in the sipm sensors produced by fbk has driven the design of a possible upgrade of the focal plane camera of the psct cta telescope , whose current design is using an older generation of hamamatsu mppc .",
    "modules made of 16 sipm sensors have been designed to be compatible with the current camera mechanics and readout , and are currently being assembled .",
    "preliminary tests and verifications have confirmed the quality of the assembly and of the performance of the modules . in 2017 at least 36 units of 16 sensors",
    "each will be ready for integration with the psct telescope camera and tested on site .",
