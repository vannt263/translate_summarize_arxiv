    "the nature of the sources of ultra - high - energy cosmic rays ( uhecrs ) is still poorly known though many efforts in detection of these particles with uhe energies .",
    "it is one of challenging problems in astroparticle physics .",
    "about 10 years ago , akeno giant air shower array ( agasa ) reported small - scale anisotropy of the uhecr arrival distribution within its angular resolution while it did large - scale isotropy with a harmonic analysis @xcite .",
    "it found five doublets and one triplet as event clusterings .",
    "it is enough evidence that origin of uhecrs is astrophysically point - like source .",
    "however , no obvious astronomical counterparts to the observed uhecrs have been found .",
    "one of this reasons is magnetic fields in the universe .",
    "extragalactic magnetic field ( egmf ) is poorly known theoretically and observationally . as an upper limit for its strength , @xmath5 , and correlation length , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , by faraday rotation measurements of radio signals from distant quasars ,",
    "is often adopted @xcite .",
    "based on its upper limit , uhecr propagation has been discussed in simply uniform turbulent magnetic field @xcite .",
    "it is also observationally known that clusters of galaxies have strong magnetic fields with 0.1 - a few @xmath8 g at its center @xcite .",
    "this is shown that there are not only uniform egmf but also relatively strong egmf incidental to the local structure . recently",
    ", several groups have performed simulations of large - scale structure formation with magnetic fields @xcite .",
    "they find that magnetic field traces the local density distribution .",
    "such magnetic field plays an important role in uhecr propagation since it is stronger than the uniform one .    in our previous study @xcite",
    ", we constructed a structured egmf model that reflects the local structures and discussed predicted arrival distribution of uhe protons at the earth in consideration with their propagation processes .",
    "we also considered galactic magnetic field ( gmf ) in the propagation . as a result",
    ", the number density of uhecr sources was constrained to @xmath9 under our luminosity - weighted source model ( explained in section [ model ] ) from observed arrival distribution .",
    "the egmf strength was normalized only to @xmath10 at the center of the virgo cluster",
    ". however , observational measurements of magnetic field in a galaxy cluster result in 0.1 - a few @xmath8 g , so that the strength of magnetic field has large uncertainty of about one order of magnitude .",
    "thus , it is important that the propagation process and the arrival distribution are investigated in several strengths of egmf .    in this study , we calculate propagation of uhe protons in a structured egmf with several strengths for normalization and simulate the arrival distributions at the earth . at first , comparing them to observational results , we constrain the source number density .",
    "we use agasa data for this purpose because agasa has observed the most number of events .",
    "such constraint is dependent on uhecr source model .",
    "we discuss about two simple source models .",
    "we find that the number density has large uncertainty of about an order of magnitude due to small number of observed events at present .",
    "so , we also discuss the possibility of a decrease in the uncertainty with future observations .    in section [ model ] , our models of uhecr source distribution , structured egmf , and gmf",
    "are briefly explained . in section",
    "[ method ] , a numerical method of uhe proton propagation , construction of the arrival distribution and statistical analysis are explained .",
    "we present our results in section [ result ] , and summarize in section [ summary ] .",
    "in this section , our distribution models of uhecr sources and magnetic fields are briefly explained .",
    "these models are almost the same as those in our previous work , thus , more detailed explanation is written in reference @xcite .",
    "our models of the source distribution and a structured egmf are constructed out of the _ infrared astronomical satellite _ point source catalogue redshift survey ( _ iras _ pscz ) catalog of galaxies @xcite .",
    "this catalog is thought to be the most appropriate galaxy catalog for these purposes since it has the largest sky coverage ( @xmath11 of all the sky ) .",
    "the selection effects in the observation are corrected with a luminosity function of the _ iras _ galaxies @xcite .",
    "a set of galaxies after this correction is called _ our sample galaxies _ below .",
    "our sample galaxies within 100 mpc are used for construction of our models since small number of galaxies can be detected outside 100 mpc .",
    "we adopt @xmath12 and @xmath13 as the cosmological parameters .",
    "we assume a subset of our sample galaxies to be an uhecr source distribution .",
    "the number density of uhecr sources is taken as our model parameter . for a given source number density , we randomly select galaxies from our sample galaxies with probabilities proportional to the absolute luminosity of each galaxy .",
    "source distribution outside 100 mpc is assumed to be isotropic and luminosity distribution of the galaxies follows the luminosity function .    in this study , we adopt two simple source models .",
    "one is a source distribution that all sources have the same power for injection of uhe protons , called _ normal source model _ , and the other is that each source has a power proportional to its luminosity , called _ luminosity - weighted source model_. in both the models , it is assumed that all sources have the same of maximum acceleration energy .",
    "our sample galaxies are over about five orders of magnitude in the luminosity .",
    "we construct 100 source distributions in each source number density .",
    "several simulations of the large - scale structure formation with magnetic field have found that the egmf roughly traces distribution of the baryon density @xcite . according to these results ,",
    "our structured egmf model is constructed based on simple assumptions .",
    "we constructed the matter density distribution from our sample galaxies with a spatial resolution of @xmath14 .",
    "in each cell , a strength of the egmf is related to the matter density , @xmath15 , as @xmath16 and a turbulent magnetic field with the kolmogorov spectrum is assumed .",
    "the strength of egmf is normalized at a cell that contains the center of the virgo cluster to @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "note that magnetized space covers about 5% of the universe within 100 mpc .",
    "the remaining 95% space has no magnetic field .",
    "outside of 100 mpc , we assume an uniform turbulent field with 1 ng .    as gmf model , a model in reference @xcite is adopted .",
    "this model consists of a bisymmetric spiral field and a dipole field .",
    "we neglect a turbulent component of the gmf though its field strength is in the range of @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the strength of the regular component of the gmf . the turbulent component little changes the arrival direction of uhe protons @xcite .",
    "in this study , propagation of uhe protons is calculated by an application for the backtracking method .",
    "uhe protons injected from their sources can not always reach the earth because of their deflections by magnetic fields .",
    "it wastes many cpu time to calculate the propagation of such protons and to construct the arrival distribution . in order to solve this problem",
    ", we suggested a new method of calculation of the propagation in intergalactic space with attention to an inverse process of uhecr propagation @xcite . in this method , we consider uhecrs with the charge of -1 that ejected from the earth , and calculate their trajectories in galactic space and intergalactic space .",
    "trajectories of these particles can be regarded as trajectories of uhe protons from extragalactic space .    in intergalactic space , we consider not only the deflections due to egmf , but also the energy - loss processes , which are adiabatic energy loss due to the expanding universe , the electron - positron pair creation and photopion production in collision with the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) @xcite .",
    "all of these processes are treated as continuous processes .",
    "the adiabatic energy loss results from the expansion of the universe . this energy loss rate is written as @xmath21^{1/2 }",
    "e.\\ ] ] for the pair creation we adopt the analytical fitting functions given by @xcite to calculate the energy - loss rate on isotropic photons .",
    "for the photopion production , the energy - loss length which is calculated by simulating the photopion production with the event generator sophia @xcite is used .    in galactic space ,",
    "all energy loss processes are neglected since the path lengths of uhe protons are enough shorter than energy - loss lengths of those processes .",
    "the arrival distribution of uhe protons at the earth can be generated from their trajectories calculated with a method explained above .",
    "we eject 2,500,000 particles from the earth isotropically with the ejection spectrum of @xmath22 and record their trajectories .",
    "the trajectories are calculated until their propagation times reach the age of the universe or their energies reach @xmath23 , which is assumed as maximum energy of accelerated proton at each source . with our source models , we calculate a factor for each trajectory , which represents the relative probability that the @xmath24 th proton reaches the earth , @xmath25 here @xmath26 labels sources on each trajectory , while @xmath27 , @xmath28 , and @xmath29 are the redshift , distance , and luminosity of such sources .",
    "@xmath30 is the energy of a proton at a source , which has the energy @xmath31 at the earth .",
    "thus , @xmath32 is the energy spectrum of uhe protons ejected from a source whose distance is @xmath28 .",
    "we assume that uhe protons are injected with a power - law spectrum in the energy range of @xmath33 .",
    "@xmath34 represents a correction factor for the variation of the shape of the energy spectrum through the propagation .",
    "the power - law index of @xmath35 is assumed to be 2.6 in order to fit the calculated energy spectrum above @xmath36ev to the observational result @xcite .",
    "this corresponds to an injection model that the ankle is assumed to be the pair creation dip @xcite .",
    "we randomly select trajectories according to these relative probabilities , @xmath37 , so that the number of the selected trajectories is equal to the required event number .",
    "the mapping of the ejected direction of each particle at the earth is the arrival distribution of uhe protons . if we have to select the same trajectory more than once to adjust the number of selected trajectories , we generate a new event whose arrival direction is calculated by adding a normally distributed deviation with zero mean and variance equal to the experimental resolution to the original arrival direction .      in this subsection , we introduce two statistical quantities needed to compare the arrival distribution of uhe protons with that obtained by the observation statistically .",
    "the two - point correlation function @xmath38 contains information on the small - scale anisotropy .",
    "we start from a set of events generated from our simulation .",
    "for each event , we divide the sphere into concentric bins of angular size @xmath39 and count the number of events falling into each bin .",
    "we then divide it by the solid angle of the corresponding bin , that is , @xmath40},\\ ] ] where @xmath41 denotes the separation angle of the two events .",
    "the angle @xmath39 is taken to be @xmath42 in this analysis .",
    "the agasa data show a correlation at small angles @xmath43 with a @xmath44 significance of deviation from an isotropic distribution for @xmath45 @xcite .    in order to investigate what number density of sources",
    "can best reproduce the two - point correlation observed by agasa , we introduce @xmath46 for a source distribution as @xmath47 ^ 2 } { { \\sigma(\\theta)}^2 } } ,   \\label{chi10}\\ ] ] where @xmath38 is the two - point correlation function calculated from a simulated arrival distribution within @xmath48 , which corresponds to the sky observed by agasa and @xmath49 is that obtained from the agasa data at angle @xmath50 .",
    "the @xmath51 is the statistical error of @xmath38 due to the finite number of simulated events .",
    "the random event selection is performed 20 times .",

    "the error bars originate from 100 times source selection .",
    "the gmf is considered in the lower panel while not in the upper panel . ]",
    "the arrival distributions of uhe protons are constructed by a method explained in section [ method_prop ] . comparing the simulated arrival distribution with the observed arrival distribution statistically , we constrain the number density of uhecr sources .",
    "first , we try to restrict the number density from small - scale anisotropy . as mentioned above",
    ", the two - point correlation function is a statistical indicator of the small - scale anisotropy .",
    "therefore , we compare the two - point correlation functions calculated from simulated arrival distributions and the functions calculated by agasa result above @xmath1 @xcite . in recent year , the authors of reference @xcite pointed out that small - scale anisotropy by agasa is statistically not consistent with the observed spectrum above @xmath54ev ( above greisen - zatsepin - kuzmin(gzk ) cutoff @xcite ) by them .",
    "our source models also predict gzk cutoff even if our structured egmf and gmf are taken into account , as shown in next subsection .",
    "thus , we assume that the super - gzk events are of another origin .",

    "@xmath56s of @xmath61 are relatively larger than those of the others .",

    "however , the remaining @xmath56s provide similar values .",
    "more discussion is needed in order to estimate the number density more precisely .",
    "uhecr source distribution must satisfy not only the small - scale anisotropy but also the large - scale isotropy .",
    "the large - scale isotropy is estimated quantitatively by harmonic amplitudes .",
    "thus , we recalculate the two - point correlation function only from source distributions that predict the large - scale isotropy comparable to agasa , which is quantified using the same method as in reference @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig_tp_isol0 ] shows such two - point correlation functions with several values of the number density and strengths of the egmf .",
    "the gmf is also considered .",
    "the histograms are the two - point correlation functions calculated from agasa events with energies from @xmath62 to @xmath63 ( 49 events ) .",
    "the error bars are due to the finite number of event selection , and the shaded regions are total 1@xmath55 error including errors due to different source distributions .",
    "the errors that originate from different source distributions are very small since source distributions that predicts large values of the function are excluded .",
    "such source distributions can not satisfy the large - scale isotropy .",

    "the mean values ( points ) are smaller than the observational data and can not reproduce it within 1@xmath55 error at small angular scale . on the other hand ,",
    "source distributions with number densities of @xmath3 predict stronger anisotropy at the small angle scale even if the large - scale isotropy is satisfied .",
    "thus , the appropriate number density that best reproduces the arrival distribution observed by agasa is @xmath65 in the case of @xmath64 .",
    "this is the same result as reference @xcite though they do not consider the gmf .    , but calculated in the luminosity - weighted source model . ]    in the other panels , similar tendencies to the case of @xmath64 can be found .",
    "the egmf diffuses cosmic rays during propagation , thereby weakening event clusterings .",
    "therefore , smaller number densities ( @xmath66 ) are favored in stronger egmfs . however , in the case of @xmath3 with @xmath67 , number of source distributions used is only about 30% of 100 source distributions while about 70% at @xmath0 .",

    "the error bars are larger than those in figure [ fig_chi10l0 ] because of additional degree of freedom in the uhecr source luminosities .",
    "mean values of @xmath56 are smallest at @xmath68 , about one or two orders of magnitude larger than those in the case of the normal source model , but with some uncertainty .",

    "the predicted function is too large to reproduce the observed one at @xmath70 within 1@xmath55 errors . when the strengths of the egmf are stronger , values of the functions at small angles are more suppressed and the two - point correlation functions reproduce the observational result well .",
    "however , the number of source distributions with @xmath0 , adopted in this calculation , is only about 10% while the number with @xmath68 is about 50% .",

    "even 500 events observation can not enable us to discriminate these source number densities , but to discriminate @xmath92 from the isotropic distribution .",
    "in this study , we discuss the possibility of accurately estimating the source number density of uhecrs with small - scale anisotropy .",
    "comparison between simulated arrival distribution and the observational results enables us to estimate the source number density . in order to construct the arrival distribution",
    ", we calculate the propagation of uhe protons in a structured egmf with several strengths consistent with measurements of magnetic field in clusters of galaxies .",
    "the gmf is also considered .",
    "we find that the source number density of @xmath0 in the normal source model and @xmath68 in the luminosity - weighted source model can best reproduce the agasa results , which are weakly dependent on strength of our structured egmf .",
    "however , these have large uncertainty of about one order of magnitude due to the small number of observed events .",
    "so , we discuss the possibility that future observations decrease the uncertainty . in the normal source model",
    ", auger can distinguish @xmath0 and @xmath3 sufficiently by our method in the near future .",
    "if the structured egmf is zero or very weak , @xmath68 is also discriminated from the less number density in 500 event observation above @xmath1 . in stronger",
    "egmf , more observations are requested because cosmic rays are diffused more strongly .",
    "number of events that needed for the distinction depends on egmf strength . in the luminosity - weighted source model , @xmath92 can be distinguished from the less number density by auger .",
    "the distinction between the less number densities is difficult due to large uncertainty which originates from different injection powers of the sources .",
    "s calculated from arrival protons above @xmath1 , in the normal source model .",
    "the gmf is not considered the strength of the structured egmf is normalized to 0.1 @xmath8 g and that of an uniform turbulent field is 0 ( _ upper panel _ ) , 1 ng ( _ middle panel _ ) , and 10 ng ( _ lower panel _ ) . the numbers of events are set to be 200 ( _ left _ ) and 500 events ( _ right _ ) within the southern hemisphere.,title=\"fig : \" ] s calculated from arrival protons above @xmath1 , in the normal source model .",

    "the numbers of events are set to be 200 ( _ left _ ) and 500 events ( _ right _ ) within the southern hemisphere.,title=\"fig : \" ]    we exclusively adopt the agasa results in this study . however , high resolution fly s eye ( hires ) claims no significant small - scale anisotropy , contrary to agasa @xcite .",
    "this discrepancy is one of well - known problems in uhecr experiments . at present , this is not statistically significant due to the small number of observed events @xcite",
    ". it will be able to solved by new experiments with large aperture , such as auger , telescope array @xcite , and extreme universe space observatory @xcite .",
    "hence , it is possible that these experiments do not observe sufficient small - scale anisotropy in the future .",
    "if auger does not observe small - scale clusterings during 2007 ( maybe it detects about 200 events above @xmath1 ) , the source number density is estimated at about @xmath68 or more in the normal source model by definition of @xmath74 in figure [ fig_chidisl0 ] .",
    "it is comparable with number density of active galactic nuclei@xcite .",
    "our egmf model within 100 mpc has about 95% of volume without magnetic field . in our model , uniform magnetic field",
    "is not considered . according to an upper limit mentioned in section [ introduction ] , deflection angle of uhe protons with energy of @xmath31 during propagation of distance , @xmath96 ,",
    "is estimated as @xmath97 this deflection is expected to generate more isotropic arrival distribution of uhecrs .",
    "therefore , uniform turbulent magnetic field affects determination of the source number density .    as a demonstration",
    ", we show @xmath74 distribution for @xmath98 , including the uniform field , in figure [ fig_chi_offset ] .",
    "the normal source model is adopted .",
    "the number of events is set to be 200 ( _ left panel _ ) , and 500 ( _ right panel _ ) .",
    "the strengths of the uniform turbulent field are 0 ( _ upper panel _ ) , 1 ( _ middle panel _ ) , and 10 ng ( _ lower panel _ ) .",
    "the distributions are shifted to lower value in stronger uniform turbulent field .",
    "the shifts are larger in more source number density . in stronger turbulent uniform magnetic field ,",
    "number of events needed for the distinction between @xmath2 and @xmath3 is smaller while it becomes difficult to discriminate @xmath4 from @xmath0 due to the diffusion of cosmic rays .",
    "strength of uniform egmf is also important for estimating the source number density .    in this work ,",
    "we adopt isotropic arrival distribution of uhecrs as a template of a future result since results of new experiments are still unpublished .",
    "auger should detect a few times more number of uhe events than that of agasa since it started observation about three years ago .",
