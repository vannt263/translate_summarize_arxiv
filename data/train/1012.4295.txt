    "the physics phenomena of nuclei are largely understood by considering the interaction between their building blocks , the nucleons . in 1935 , yukawa described the nucleon - nucleon ( nn ) force by the exchange of massive mesons  @xcite in analogy to the electromagnetic interaction which can be represented by the exchange of a massless photon .",
    "several phenomenological nucleon - nucleon potentials have been derived based on yukawa s theory and are able to reproduce data points in neutron - proton and proton - proton scattering with extremely high precision .",
    "these so - called high - quality nn potentials are used in faddeev equations  @xcite to give an exact solution of the scattering problem for the three - nucleon system .",
    "already , for the simplest three - nucleon system , the triton , an exact solution of the three - nucleon faddeev equations employing two - nucleon forces ( 2nfs ) underestimates the experimental binding energy  @xcite , showing that 2nfs are not sufficient to describe the three - nucleon system accurately .",
    "the existence of an additional force , the three - nucleon ( 3n ) interaction , was predicted a long time ago by primakov  @xcite and confirmed by a comparison between precision data and state - of - the - art calculations  @xcite .",
    "many high - precision measurements of nucleon - deuteron scattering processes at intermediate energies were carried out in the past decades with the aim to study 3nf effects and to compare the experimental observations with the predictions from rigorous faddeev calculations . in general , adding 3nf effects to the modern nn potentials gives a better agreement between the cross section data for the proton - deuteron scattering processes and the corresponding calculations  @xcite , whereas a similar comparison for the spin observables yields various discrepancies  @xcite .",
    "the overall conclusion is that the spin - dependent parts of the 3nfs are poorly understood and that more studies in this field are needed .",
    "the 3nf effects are in general small in the three - nucleon system .",
    "a complementary approach is to examine heavier systems for which the 3nf effects are significantly enhanced in magnitude .",
    "naively , one might expect that the 3nf effects increase by the argument that the number of three - nucleon combinations with respect to two - nucleon combinations gets larger with increasing number of nucleons .",
    "we , however , note that the saturation of 3nf effects sets in very quickly for large nuclei as well .",
    "this simple counting rule is supported by a comparison between predictions and data for the binding energies of light nuclei  @xcite .",
    "the predictions of a green s function monte - carlo calculation based on the argonne v18  @xcite nn interaction ( av18 ) and the illinois-2 ( il2 ) 3nf  @xcite are compared to experimental data . while a calculation which only includes the av18 nn potential deviates significantly from the experimental results , the predictions of calculations which include as well a 3nf come much closer to the data , especially for the first few light nuclei .",
    "note that the effect of the 3nf on the binding energy for the triton is 0.5 - 0.8  mev , whereas the effect increases significantly for the four - nucleon system , @xmath0he , to @xmath14  mev .",
    "for this , it was proposed to study the four - nucleon system at intermediate energies since the experimental database for this is presently poor in comparison with that of three - nucleon systems  @xcite .",
    "most of the available data have been measured at very low energies , in particular below the three - body break - up threshold of 2.2  mev .",
    "also , theoretical developments are evolving rapidly at low energies  @xcite , but lag behind at higher energies .",
    "this situation calls for extensive four - nucleon studies at intermediate energies .",
    "this paper addresses the feasibility of measuring polarization observables in the three - body break - up channel in deuteron - deuteron scattering , @xmath2 , for an incident beam energy of 65  mev / nucleon .",
    "this work is part of a more extensive experimental program which was carried out at kvi and that aims to provide precision data in various four - nucleon scattering processes at intermediate energies . with these data",
    ", we will significantly enrich the four - nucleon scattering database at intermediate energies and , thereby , provide a basis to test future calculations with the long - term aim to understand the details of 3nf effects .",

    "the experiment presented in this paper was carried out at kvi using the big instrument for nuclear - polarization analysis , bina , which meets all these requirements  @xcite .",

    "bina is a setup with a nearly @xmath8 geometrical acceptance and has been used in various few - nucleon scattering experiments to measure the scattering angles and energies of protons and deuterons with the possibility for particle identification .",

    "the thick scintillators were mounted in a cylindrical shape , thereby , facing the target .",
    "the thickness of these scintillators is sufficient to stop all the protons and deuterons originating from the processes described in this work .",
    "the forward wall has a complete azimuthal coverage for scattering angles from 10@xmath10 to 32@xmath10 , which is advantageous for the determination of the beam polarization and spin observables . with the wire spacing of 2 mm and for a distance of 29.7  cm between mwpc and target",
    ", we obtain an overall accuracy of 0.4@xmath11 for the polar angle and between 0.6@xmath11 and 2.0@xmath11 for the azimuthal angle .",

    "in addition , the polarization of the beam of deuterons was obtained at the high - energy beam line employing bina via @xmath15-asymmetry measurements of the @xmath16 reaction based on its well - known analyzing power .",
    "note that the same detector was used as well for the measurement of the polarization observables of the deuteron - deuteron break - up reaction . with the self - calibrating bina setup ,",
    "regular asymmetry measurements of the elastic deuteron - proton scattering process were performed during the actual experiment by switching rapidly the liquid target to a solid ch@xmath17 target .",
    "the polarization of the beam of deuterons was studied as a function of time to check the stability of polarization during the measurement .",

    "the total uncertainties of the polarizations was estimated by adding quadratically the statistical error and the systematic error .",
    "the systematic uncertainty stems from the uncertainty in the analyzing powers , and was found to be 6% and 5% for the vector and tensor polarizations , respectively .",
    "a comparison between the results demonstrates that the beam polarization was stable during the experiments and that there is a good agreement between the measured values obtained at the low - energy beam line with the lsp and those measured at the high - energy beam line with bina .",

    "for some parts of the @xmath9e detector , the yield of scintillation light reaching the photomultipliers was not sufficient to obtain a good particle identification .",

    "<S> in an experiment with a 65 mev / nucleon polarized deuteron beam on a liquid - deuterium target at kvi , several multi - body final states in deuteron - deuteron scattering were identified . for these measurements , a unique and advanced detection system , called bina , </S>",
    "<S> was utilized . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate the feasibility of measuring vector and tensor polarization observables of the deuteron break - up reaction leading to a three - body final - state . </S>",
    "<S> the polarization observables were determined with high precision in a nearly background - free experiment . the analysis procedure and some results are presented . </S>"
