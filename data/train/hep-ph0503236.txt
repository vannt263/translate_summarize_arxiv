    "the standard theoretical instrument for studying the structure function @xmath0 is the dglap@xcite . in this approach",
    ", @xmath1 can be represented as a convolution of the coefficient functions and the evolved quark distributions calculated with nlo approximation .",
    "those results , having been completed with appropriate fits for the initial quark distributions , provide a good agreement with the available experimental data .    on the other hand , the dglap evolution",
    "was originally obtained for operating in the range of rather large @xmath2 where higher - loop contributions to the coefficient functions and the anomalous dimensions are small .",
    "it is clear that when @xmath2 is decreasing , such corrections are becoming more and more essential and the dglap should stop to work well at certain values of small @xmath2 .    in the present paper",
    "we use the results of our previous papers @xcite to demonstrate that the impact of the high - order corrections on the @xmath3 and @xmath2 -evolutions of the non - singlet structure functions is quite sizable for @xmath4 .",
    "as the dglap -expressions for the non - singlet structure functions are well - known . in order to make the all - order resummation of the double - logarithmic contributions to @xmath0 , in refs .",
    "@xcite was used an alternative approach , composing and solving the infrared evolution equations .",
    "this approach was improved in refs .",
    "@xcite where the single - logarithmic contributions were accounted for and the qcd coupling was running while in refs .",
    "@xcite it was considered as fixed .",
    "in contrast to the dglap parametrization @xmath5 , refs .",
    "@xcite used the other parametrization .",
    "the argumentation in favor of such a parametrization was given in ref .",
    "in particular , it was shown there that this new parametrization coincides with the dglap -parametrization when @xmath2 is not far from 1 but those parameterizations differ a lot when @xmath6 .",
    "@xcite suggest the following formula for the non - singlet component of @xmath7 : @xmath8 with @xmath9 so that @xmath10 is the starting point of the @xmath3 -evolution . the new coefficient function @xmath11 is expressed in terms of new anomalous dimension @xmath12 : @xmath13 and the new anomalous dimension @xmath14 accounting for the total resummation of the double- and single- logarithmic contributions is    @xmath15\\ ] ]    where where @xmath16 and related to it the mellin transform of @xmath17 , @xmath18 are expressed in terms of @xmath19 , @xmath20 and the color factors ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for details ) .",
    "let us compare our results ( [ gnsint ] ) to the expressions for @xmath22 obtained with the nlo dglap .",
    "in order to be independent of fits for @xmath23 , we use the simplest input , the bare quark one . in other words",
    ", we compare pure evolutions for the non - singlets .",
    "we compare them when @xmath2 is changing while @xmath3 is fixed .",
    "we define @xmath24 as follows :    @xmath25    when @xmath3 is fixed and the initial quark distribution corresponds to the bare quark .",
    "the results for @xmath26 and are presented in fig .  1 taken from ref",
    ".  @xcite .",
    "it shows that for @xmath27 the nlo dglap evolution predicts the values for the non - singlets similar to the ones predicted by our evolution .",
    "however , for @xmath28 the situation is opposite .",
    "therefore , we gather that @xmath29 is the point where the impact of higher - loop contributions becomes sizable . however , it is known that dglap actually works successfully at lower values of @xmath2 .",
    "we suggest the following explanation to this fact : it is the impact of the standard fits for the initial quark density used in dglap . indeed ,",
    "all such fits contain the terms singular when @xmath30 and therefore they are able to mimic the impact of the higher - loop contributions absent in dglap .",
    "( [ gnsint ] ) accounts for the total resummation of the double- and single logarithmic contributions to the non - singlet anomalous dimension and the coefficient function .",
    "they are leading when @xmath2 is small but the method we have used does not allow to account for the other contributions , e.g. constants.one can neglect them when @xmath2 is small but they become important when @xmath2 is not far from 1 . on the other hand , such contributions are accounted in dglap where the non - singlet coefficient function @xmath31 and anomalous dimension @xmath32 are known with the two - loop accuracy :    @xmath33    therefore , we can borrow from dglap formulae the contributions missing in eq .",
    "( [ gnsint ] ) by adding @xmath31 and @xmath32 to the coefficient functions and anomalous dimensions of eq .",
    "( [ gnsint ] ) .",
    "however , both @xmath31 and @xmath32 contain also the terms already accounted for by eqs .",
    "( [ gnsint ] ) :    @xmath34    now let us make the new coefficient functions @xmath35 and new anomalous dimensions @xmath36 ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for more details ) :    @xmath37 + \\frac{a(\\omega)}{16\\pi^2c_f}\\gamma^{(0 ) } + \\big(\\frac{a(\\omega)}{16\\pi^2c_f}\\big)^2 \\gamma^{(1 ) } , \\\\ \\nonumber \\hat{c}_{ns } = \\big[c_{ns } - \\widetilde{c}_{ns } \\big ] +   1 + \\frac{a(\\omega)}{8\\pi^2 c_f } c^{(1)}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the new coefficient function and anomalous dimension of eq .",
    "( [ newch ] ) comprise the total resummation of the leading contributions from higher loops and the dglap expressions in which @xmath38 is replaced by @xmath18 and therefore can be used in the regions of small and large @xmath2 .",
    "however , the initial quark densities should be replaced by the new ones , without singularities when @xmath30 .",
    "the total resummation of the most singular logarithmic contributions to the anomalous dimensions and coefficient functions leads to the sizable deviation of @xmath0 from the conventional nlo dglap predictions at @xmath39 when the bare quark input is used for the initial parton density .",
    "it also leads to the regge asymptotics @xmath40 , with the value of the intercepts @xmath41 for the non - singlet @xmath0 and @xmath42 for the singlet @xmath0 .",
    "dglap compensates lack of the total resummation by using different kinds of singular in @xmath2 fits for the initial parton distributions and thereby can successfully work at @xmath39 .",
    "so , our results can be used for specifying the dglap fits , fixing their singular part .",
    "on the other hand , the dglap anomalous dimensions and coefficient functions contain the terms quite essential at @xmath2 not far from 1 whereas our approach can not account for them . in order to get an approach universally good for large and small @xmath2",
    ", we suggest combining the nlo dglap anomalous dimensions and coefficient functions and our formulae .",
