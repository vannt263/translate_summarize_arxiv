    "a )    b )    the most important feature of the proposed models is the existence of a wide region for parameter @xmath14 , @xmath284 , for which the limit @xmath74 means the purely radial systems .",
    "this will enable us to use them in consistent analytic and numerical study of roi , which can not be performed correctly using systems with purely radial orbits only .",
    "outside this range , @xmath285 , @xmath158 the potential degenerates into the keplerian one , @xmath286 , and models turn into points .",
    "we show that the global anisotropy @xmath287 varies linearly with polytropic index @xmath14 ( see ( [ lin_xi ] ) ) from 1 to 0 , which corresponds to transformation of models from purely radial to the isotropic ones .",
    "comparison of the parameter domains of pps polytropes and gp is possible , recalling the relation @xmath288 for gp . in @xmath289-plane",
    "the boundary is a trapezoid with a vertical straight line @xmath230 , two horizontal straight lines @xmath290 and @xmath139 and a sloping side @xmath291 ( hnon 1973 , barnes , etc .",
    "1986 ) or @xmath292 ( see fig.[fig : liso]b ) .",
    "the straight line @xmath139 corresponds to part of the boundary @xmath293 , @xmath74 , and the sloping side corresponds to another part of @xmath250-axis : @xmath294 , @xmath295 .",
    "the right boundary of our model @xmath296 corresponds to single point @xmath297 in the domain for the generalized polytropes ( the plummer model ) .",
    "thus , the domain boundary for pps polytropes coincide with the domain boundary of gp .",
    "this is not surprising , since if @xmath298 the mass of the system is localized near the center .",
    "in fact , it means that sphere radius @xmath184 tends to infinity .",
    "but just the same @xmath299 occurs when reaching the boundary @xmath300 in gp ( see hnon 1973 ) .    for a fixed @xmath23",
    ", central density concentration grows with increasing of the polytropic index @xmath14 . for @xmath156 ,",
    "the anisotropic models have intervals of growing density at the periphery of spheres .",
    "the agekyan s model ( 1962 ) which is a particular case of our series at @xmath230 , @xmath74 , also has this feature .    for the model @xmath301",
    ", we consider the precession rates at low angular momenta for nearly radial and purely radial orbits .",
    "features of its behavior play a significant role for stability , first of all in the emergence of roi ( polyachenko , etc .",
    "we have shown that in the limit of the purely radial systems , the derivative of the precession rate over @xmath17 at @xmath3 tends to infinity .",
    "this behavior is typical for all purely radial systems .",
    "thus , the conventional methods of stability theory can not be applied to study roi in models with purely radial orbits .",
    "suitable systems must have dfs with at least small but finite angular momentum dispersion .    note that the generalized polytropes are also unsuitable for studying the instability by analytical methods ( by solving the eigenvalue problem ) because of the singular behavior of the density and the potential at @xmath302 .    in a separate work we shall present results of our study of roi for families of models discussed above .",
