    "<S> 2 can not properly account alone for the observed behaviour ( see dashed lines in figs . 4b and 4c ) </S>",

    "<S> we should finally like to comment on two important figures of merit of the transistor : its power gain and speed of operation . </S>",
    "<S> even if the former is lacking in the present non - optimized devices , it can be made sizable by tuning the ratio between @xmath40 and @xmath71 @xcite , i.e. by fabricating sufficiently - long control lines . </S>",
    "<S> concerning speed , switching time @xmath72 is determined by how fast an out - of - equilibrium electron energy distribution can be established in the nw @xcite ; in our case we estimate @xmath73 , which can be decreased by shortening @xmath74 or increasing @xmath75 .    in light of possible applications , the present inas nw - based hot - electron josephson transistor concept offers a number of attracting features : ( i ) a large , yet tunable , critical supercurrent ; ( ii ) the possibility to achieve large power gains in optimized devices ; ( iii ) a high operating frequency ( easily up to @xmath76 ghz ) ; ( iv ) a reduced dissipation ( @xmath76 pw or below ) , ideal for low - temperature applications ; ( v ) the possibility to combine the josephson effect with custom quantum structures defined during the nw growth . the adoption of self - assembled nanostructures as the core element of this class of devices thus paves the way to rather broad opportunities since it allows the design and growth of epitaxial quantum systems characterized by atomically - defined potential profiles  @xcite , a crucial element for several innovative out - of - equilibrium nanodevice schemes  @xcite .    </S>",
