    "is being paid much attention today from theoretical as well as experimental point of view due to its potential application in nanoscience and nanotechnology .",
    "getting introduced in 1996 by s. wolf ` spintronics '  @xcite has outgrown as one of the most enriched and sophisticated areas in condensed matter physics over the past two decades revolutionizing the concept of information storage technology . it holds future promises to integrate memory and logic into a single device .",
    "the key idea of designing spin dependent nano - electronic devices is based on the concept of quantum interference effect  @xcite , and it is generally preserved throughout the sample having dimension smaller or comparable to the phase coherence length",
    ". therefore , ring type conductors or two path devices are ideal candidates where the effect of quantum interference can be exploited  @xcite .",
    "in such a ring shaped geometry , quantum interference effect can be controlled by several ways , and most probably , the effect can be regulated significantly by tuning the magnetic flux , the so - called aharonov - bohm ( ab ) flux , that threads the ring . a magnetic quantum ring penetrated by a magnetic flux @xmath0 yields a flux dependent spin transmission probability which may be useful for modeling of spin based logic gates and spin transistors .    in recent times , spin dependent transport through magnetic systems of ring shaped geometries has drawn much attention since these simple looking systems can be used to demonstrate several physical phenomena such as , many body correlation effect  @xcite , quantum phase transition  @xcite , resonant tunneling  @xcite , spin related conductance modulation  @xcite , spin filtering  @xcite , spin detecting  @xcite , etc . at the same time , much interest has also been shown in the study of spin based transport through a quantum ring in presence of an inhomogeneous magnetic field .",

    "@xcite have shown that in mesoscopic rings a spatially inhomogeneous spin - orbit ( so ) interaction enhances the spin - interference effects and the transport mechanism can be understood in terms of the ab physics with fictitious spin dependent magnetic fluxes .",
    "the inhomogeneous so interaction controls and enhances spin injection in two - terminal rings significantly and these aspects can be used for quantum computation .",
    "following a brief introduction of spin dependent transport through a magnetic quantum ring threaded by an ab flux @xmath0 , in the present work we will explore how such a quantum ring can be used for implementing classical logic gates .",
    "a single mesoscopic ring is used to design or , not , xor , xnor and nand gates , while and and nor gates are fabricated with the help of two such quantum rings .",
    "for all these logic gates , ab flux @xmath0 enclosed by a ring plays the central role and it controls the interference condition of electronic waves passing through two arms of the ring . within a non - interacting picture , a tight - binding framework is used to describe the model and all the calculations are done based on single particle green s function technique  @xcite .",
    "there are also several other methods like mode matching techniques  @xcite , transfer matrix method  @xcite , etc .",

    "@xmath103 reveals a ballistic transmission through the mqr .",
    "each resonant peak in the conductance spectrum is associated with a particular energy eigenvalue of the ring .",

    "the sharpness of resonant peaks drastically changes in the limit of strong ring - electrode coupling which is clearly visible from the sky blue curve of fig .",
    "[ ringcond](a ) .    in this strong - coupling limit",
    ", all resonant peaks get broadened where the contribution for the broadening comes from the imaginary parts of the self - energies @xmath104 and @xmath105  @xcite .",
    "these results predict that in the limit of weak - coupling a fine tuning in energy scale is required to get spin transmission across the ring , while for the strong - coupling limit since conduction takes place in a wide range of energy , fine tuning is not necessary to get electron conduction .",
    "this coupling effect provides an important signature in the study of electron transport and the effect becomes much clearer from our current - voltage ( @xmath83-@xmath82 ) characteristics . in the presence of ab flux @xmath0 , more resonant peaks appear in the conductance spectrum compared to the case when @xmath106 .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ ringcond](b ) where we set @xmath107 .",
    "appearance of more resonant peaks is associated with the existence of more discrete energy levels which is caused by removal of energy degeneracies in the presence of @xmath0 .",
    "all the results presented above ( fig .  [ ringcond ] ) are associated with the variation of only up spin conductance @xmath96 as a function of energy @xmath38 .",
    "the conductance - energy spectrum for a down spin electron is exactly mirror symmetric to the spectrum observed for an up spin electron , and accordingly , we do not plot the results further for down spin electrons . this mirror symmetric like feature",

    "in addition , it is also important to note that for this mqr where all moments are aligned along @xmath98 direction , no spin flip transmission takes place i.e. , @xmath108 .",
    "the explanation of zero transmission probability for spin flipping is given as follow .",
    "spin flip occurs due to the presence of the term @xmath109 in the hamiltonian ( see eq .",

    "for the local magnetic moments oriented along @xmath116 @xmath117 axes , @xmath109 @xmath118 becomes equal to @xmath119 .",
    "accordingly , the hamiltonian does not contain @xmath111 and @xmath112 and so as @xmath120 and @xmath121 , which provides zero flipping for up or down orientation of magnetic moments .      in fig .",
    "[ ringcondphi ] we show the dependence of up spin conductances as a function of ab flux @xmath0 for a magnetic quantum ring considering @xmath97 where all moments are aligned along @xmath98 direction .",
    "the magenta and green curves correspond to the up spin conductances for the weak- and strong - coupling limits , respectively , and these conductances are determined at the typical energy @xmath122 .",
    "it is observed that the up spin conductance in the case of weak - coupling is significantly reduced compared to the strong - coupling one , and , both for these two coupling cases up spin conductance varies periodically with @xmath0 showing @xmath123 ( @xmath124 in our chosen unit @xmath90 ) flux - quantum periodicity .",
    "quite interestingly we notice that at @xmath125 , where @xmath2 is an odd integer , conductance drops exactly to zero . this vanishing behavior can be explained as follows .    for a symmetrically connected ring ,",
    "the wave functions passing through the upper and lower arms of the ring are given by , @xmath126 where , @xmath127 and @xmath128 are used to indicate two different paths of electron propagation along the two arms of the ring .",
    "@xmath129 denotes the wave function in the absence of magnetic flux @xmath0 and it is same for both upper and lower arms as the ring is symmetrically coupled to the electrodes .",

    "these aspects can be utilized to design all possible logic gates which we will describe in the forthcoming sub - sections .",
    "all the basic features of spin dependent transport obtained from conductance - energy spectra of the magnetic quantum ring can be understood in a better way from our current - voltage characteristics .",

    "the reddish - yellow and blue curves represent the currents for @xmath106 and @xmath140 , respectively .    in the limit of weak - coupling , current shows step - like behavior as a function of bias voltage @xmath82 ( fig .",
    "[ ringcurr](a ) ) , where each step is associated with a sharp resonant peak in the conductance - energy spectrum . with the increment of bias voltage @xmath82 , electrochemical potentials @xmath7 and @xmath8 in the two electrodes shift gradually and eventually cross one of the quantized energy levels of the mqr , and therefore , a current step appears in the current - voltage characteristic curve . the effect of ab flux @xmath0 is quite interesting and it can be understood clearly by noting the curves presented in fig .",
    "[ ringcurr](a ) . in presence of @xmath0 ( @xmath107 )",
    "more steps appear in the current - voltage characteristic curve ( blue line ) associated with the conductance - energy spectrum , compared to the case when @xmath0 is set to zero ( reddish - yellow line ) . with this feature it also important to note that the typical bias voltage where electron starts to conduct through the electrode - ring - electrode bridge , the so - called threshold voltage @xmath141 , can be regulated significantly through the ab flux @xmath0 . as @xmath0 increases towards @xmath136 from @xmath9 value",
    ", @xmath141 gets increased gradually , and , at the typical value of @xmath142 , @xmath141 is maximum where electron conduction is stopped for the complete range of bias voltage .",
    "this phenomenon can be utilized in designing nano - electronic devices .",

    "the current amplitude is very high compared to the weak - coupling limit .",
    "this continuous like feature with large current amplitude can be easily explained from the conductance - energy spectrum discussed earlier .",
    "thus , in short we can say that for a fixed bias voltage , current amplitude can be controlled by tuning the ring - electrode coupling strength .    in the following sub - sections",
    "we will try to explore how these features of spin dependent transmission through a mqr can be implemented to fabricate several classical logic gates .",

    "a single ring is used to design or , not , xor , xnor and nand gates , while the rest two gates are fabricated by using two such rings and in all the cases each ring is penetrated by an ab flux @xmath0 which plays the crucial role for the whole logic gate operations .",
    "we have used a simple tight - binding framework to describe the model , where a magnetic quantum ring is attached to two semi - infinite one - dimensional non - magnetic metallic electrodes . based on a single particle green s formalism",
    "all the calculations have been done numerically which demonstrate two - terminal conductance and current through the system .",
    "our theoretical analysis may be useful in fabricating mesoscopic or nano - scale logic gates .    throughout our work ,",
    "we have studied seven possible logic gates . out of which",
    "five logic gates are designed by using a single magnetic quantum ring , while the rest two are fabricated with the help of two magnetic quantum rings . in the case of single rings",
    ", we have chosen the rings with total number of atomic sites @xmath97 .",
    "on the other hand , for the coupled ring systems , we have considered two identical rings , where each ring contains @xmath163 atomic sites . in our model calculations ,",
    "these typical numbers ( @xmath163 or @xmath164 ) are chosen only for the sake of simplicity .",
    "though the results presented here change numerically with the ring size ( @xmath6 ) , but all the basic features remain exactly invariant .",
    "to be more specific , it is important to note that , in real situation the experimentally achievable rings have typical diameters within the range @xmath165-@xmath166 @xmath167 m .",
    "in such a small ring , unrealistically very high magnetic fields are required to produce a quantum flux .",
    "to overcome this situation , hod _ et al .",
    "_ have studied extensively and proposed how to construct nanometer scale devices , based on aharonov - bohm interferometry , those can be operated in moderate magnetic fields  @xcite .    in the present paper",
    "we have done all the calculations by ignoring the effects of temperature , electron - electron correlation , disorder , etc . due to these factors ,",
    "any scattering process that appears in the mesoscopic ring would have influence on electronic phases , and , in consequences can disturb the quantum interference effects . here",
    "we have assumed that , in our samples all these effects are too small , and accordingly , we have neglected all these factors in this particular study .",
