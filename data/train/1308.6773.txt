    "the attempt to incorporate gravity into quantum theory meets great conceptual difficulties .",
    "the main reason for these problems seems to be the rather different roles played by space and time in quantum theory and in einstein s theory of gravity . in quantum theory ,",
    "an a priori notion of space and time enters the formulation and the interpretation of the theory in a crucial way . in einstein s theory of gravity , on the other side , the structure of space and time is dynamical and strongly influenced by the distribution of matter which is treated classically .",
    "these severe conceptual problems are accompanied by hard technical problems , hence testing ideas for solving the problem turns out to be extremely time consuming , and it is difficult to obtain reliable conclusions . in despair , rather radical approaches have been proposed as e.g. string theory and loop quantum gravity , but we think that it is fair to say that none of these approaches has reached its goal , up to now , nor could either of them be ruled out , neither by empirical results nor by inner theoretical reasons .",
    "if one is less ambitious and takes into account , that gravitational forces tend to be very small compared to other forces , one may consider , in a first step , gravity as an external field , producing a curved spacetime , and treat quantum matter by quantum field theory on such a background .",
    "one may then , in a second step , treat quantum gravity as a quantum field fluctuating around a given background .",
    "the second step meets severe problems : the arising theory is nonrenormalizable , which means that in every order of perturbation theory new interaction terms appear whose coupling constants have to be determined by experiments .",
    "moreover , the causal structure of the theory is determined by the background metric , whereas physics would require that it depends only on the full metric , including the quantum fluctuations .",
    "nevertheless , a consistent perturbative formulation was recently presented by brunetti , rejzner and one of us in @xcite .",
    "surprisingly , already the first step is by no means trivial .",
    "the reason is , that quantum field theory in its standard formulation heavily depends on the symmetries of minkowski space .",
    "these symmetries are used to define the vacuum and the concept of a particle , and one can then , under quite general conditions , derive the existence of scattering states and of an s - matrix .",
    "but on a generic lorentzian spacetime , no nontrivial symmetries exist , and as a consequence , neither the concept of a vacuum state nor that of particles can be intrinsically introduced .",
    "in particular , the classical picture of particles moving in an empty spacetime is not supported by quantum field theory . the most spectacular consequence of this fact is the evaporation of black holes as predicted by hawking .",
    "the problems of quantum field theory on a given curved back ground have been solved within the last 20 years by using the concepts of algebraic quantum field theory and by replacing techniques of operators on fock space by methods from microlocal analysis @xcite .",
    "a compilation of references on algebraic quantum field theory on curved spacetimes can be found in @xcite .",
    "algebraic quantum field theory was originally developed in order to understand the relation between the local degrees of freedom of quantized fields and the observed multi - particle states @xcite .",
    "it was then observed by dimock and kay that it provides a good starting point for formulating a theory on a curved spacetime @xcite .",
    "the absence of a distinguished hilbert space representation , however , was a severe obstacle for extending the theory to nonlinear fields , the most prominent being the energy momentum tensor .    for this purpose it was necessary to understand the singularities of correlation functions .",
    "there was overwhelming evidence that the so - called hadamard states yield a class of states with the correct singularity structure .",
    "a direct characterization of hadamard states turned out to be rather complicated @xcite , and its use for the determination of correlation functions of nonlinear fields seemed to be extremely cumbersome .",
    "the situation changed completely when radzikowski discovered that the hadamard condition could equivalently be replaced by a positivity condition on the wave front set of the 2-point function @xcite .",
    "this marked the breakthrough for the modern theory of quantum fields on curved back grounds , and within a few years it was possible to construct all kinds of composite fields @xcite and to prove the existence of renormalized time ordered products @xcite .",
    "renormalization , however , had still the problem that renormalization conditions at different points of spacetime could not be compared with each other in the absence of nontrivial symmetries .",
    "a new principle was needed , the principle of local covariance @xcite .",
    "this principle says that it is not meaningful to do physics on a special spacetime ; instead all structures should depend only on the local geometry . based on this principle ,",
    "hollands and wald were able to finish the renormalization program @xcite , which had been started by brunetti and one of us @xcite .",
    "one of the outcomes of this generalization of algebraic quantum field theory is that it is meaningful to consider the same field on different spacetimes .    a direct application of this fact is the use of the energy momentum tensor as a source term for einstein s equation .",
    "but as long as gravity itself is not quantized one has the problem to compare a quantum object with a classical object . on a pragmatic level this may be solved by using the expectation value of the energy momentum tensor .",
    "this might be reasonable as long as the fluctuations are small enough .",
    "but here new problems arise .",
    "one is the fact that the correlation functions of the energy momentum tensor diverge at coinciding points .",
    "one therefore looks at appropriate averages ; this , however , introduces a new parameter into the theory .",
    "the other problem is even worse : whereas fields exist which can be considered to be the same on different spacetimes , a corresponding identification of states on different spacetimes does not exist .",
    "the latter problem can presumably only be treated in a theory containing quantized gravitational and matter fields .",
    "one may , however , restrict oneself to situations with higher symmetries , as they arise in cosmological spacetimes of the friedmann - robertson - walker type .",
    "there , one may admit only states which are invariant under the spatial symmetries .",
    "still , this does not fix the states uniquely , hence additional choices have to be introduced .",
    "nevertheless , one can in this way reproduce the standard cosmological model from first principles , by modelling the matter - energy content of the universe entirely in terms of quantum fields rather than effectively by means of a classical perfect fluid @xcite .",
    "classically , a configuration of a scalar field may be understood as a smooth function on spacetime .",
    "let @xmath0 be the set of all smooth functions on a spacetime @xmath1 , and let @xmath2 be the subset of smooth solutions of the klein - gordon equation .",
    "classical observables are functions on @xmath0 modulo functions which vanish on solutions .",
    "the observables of the quantum theory form a suitable subspace on which the algebraic structures of quantum theory can be defined .",
    "this subspace can be characterized in the following way .",
    "we consider a globally hyperbolic time oriented spacetime .",
    "on such a spacetime the klein - gordon equation @xmath3 with curvature scalar @xmath4 , curvature coupling parameter @xmath5 and mass @xmath6 , possesses unique retarded and advanced green s functions @xmath7 considered as maps from compactly supported densities to smooth functions .",
    "their difference is the commutator function @xmath8 . a hadamard solution of the klein - gordon operator @xmath9 is a distributional bisolution @xmath10 with the properties :    1 .",
    "@xmath11 2 .",
    "@xmath12 where @xmath13 is the closed forward lightcone in @xmath14 .",
    "3 .   @xmath10 is a distribution of positive type .",
    "we want to introduce an associative product @xmath15 on a subspace @xmath16 of the space of maps @xmath17 by setting @xmath18 in order to make this definition meaningful we require for @xmath19 :    1 .",
    "@xmath20 is polynomial , therefore the sum over @xmath21 is finite .",
    "@xmath20 is smooth in the sense of the calculus on locally convex spaces , where @xmath0 is equipped with its standard topology ( uniform convergence of all derivatives on any compact set ) .",
    "from these two conditions it follows that @xmath20 is of the form @xmath22 with compactly supported distributional densities @xmath23 on @xmath24 .",
    "the wave front set of @xmath23 does not intersect @xmath25 nor @xmath26 .",
    "this condition guarantees by hrmander s theorem on the multiplicability of distributions , that , in view of the wave front set of the hadamard solution , the summands in the definition of the product are well defined .",
    "the product is associative .",
    "complex conjugation induces an involution on @xmath16 , @xmath27 hence @xmath16 gets the structure of a unital * -algebra , where the unit is the constant function @xmath28 .",
    "the subspace @xmath29 is an ideal , and the quotient is the enlarged ccr - algebra .",
    "it contains as a subalgebra the ccr - algebra generated by linear functionals of the form @xmath30 with a smooth density @xmath31 on @xmath1 and in addition all local polynomials in the field and its derivatives , @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the jet prolongation of @xmath34 , and @xmath31 is a smooth function on the jet bundle which is a polynomial in @xmath34 and its derivatives at every point @xmath35 , and which has compact spacetime support @xmath36    the definition of the enlarged ccr - algebra depends on the choice of the hadamard solution @xmath10 . since two hadamard solutions differ by a smooth symmetric and real valued bisolution @xmath37 , the arising algebras are isomorphic with the isomorphism @xmath38    every hadamard solution @xmath39 induces a family of coherent states by @xmath40 with @xmath41 .",
    "according to a result of verch , the arising gns - representations are locally equivalent @xcite .",
    "a further crucial ingredient for the interpretation of the theory are locally covariant fields @xmath42 .",
    "these are , for every spacetime @xmath1 , linear maps @xmath43 from the space of ( compactly supported ) test tensors to the algebra @xmath16 such that , for every isometric , time orientation and causality preserving embedding @xmath44 into a larger spacetime @xmath45 one has the relation @xmath46 where @xmath47 denotes the push forward of test tensors . in other words ,",
    "a locally covariant field is a natural transformation between the functor @xmath48 of test tensor spaces and the functor @xmath49 of observable algebras , both based on the category of globally hyperbolic spacetimes with isometric , time orientation and causality preserving embeddings as morphisms .    in a first attempt one may look at a polynomial @xmath50 in @xmath34 and its derivatives and set @xmath51 but this definition violates the naturality condition for locally covariant fields since there is no natural choice for the hadamard solution , i.e. no choice which is compatible with all possible embeddings of a spacetime into another one , a fact which is responsible for the nonexistence of a vacuum state .",
    "let @xmath52 be a polynomial in covariant derivatives ( with respect to the levi - civita connection ) and consider the functionals @xmath53 under the isomorphism @xmath54 , @xmath55 transforms as @xmath56 we now use the fact , that @xmath37 is the difference of 2 hadamard solutions .",
    "hadamard solutions admit an asymptotic expansion @xmath57 here @xmath58 are points in a geodesically convex open set , @xmath59 is the signed square of the geodesic distance between @xmath60 and @xmath61 , the functions @xmath62 and @xmath63 are solutions of the so - called transport equations and are uniquely determined by the local geometry .",
    "@xmath64 is a free parameter with the dimension of inverse length .",
    "@xmath65 is an @xmath66 times continuously differentiable function which depends on the choice of @xmath10 .",
    "we omit the @xmath67-prescription necessary for @xmath68 to be well - defined , see @xcite .",
    "we now set @xmath69 where @xmath45 is larger than or equal to twice the degree of @xmath70 , and find @xmath71 by expanding the exponential series we obtain a large class of locally covariant fields .",
    "these correspond to wick powers of the scalar field and its derivatives regularised by point - splitting and suitable subtractions of derivatives of @xmath68 .",
    "this class may be enlarged by the @xmath34-independent locally covariant fields constructed from the metric .",
    "further details may be found e.g. in @xcite .",
    "a locally covariant field of particular interest is the energy momentum tensor @xmath72 .",
    "however , it is by no means intrinsically clear which locally covariant field is the observable whose expectation value is the `` correct '' source term for einstein s equation . essentially this is due to the fact that gravity is sensitive to absolute energy densities rather than energy density differences .",
    "wald @xcite and later hollands and wald @xcite have suggested that a locally covariant field should satisfy standard commutation relations , covariant conservation @xmath73 and suitable analyticity conditions in order to be a meaningful energy momentum tensor . for a free scalar field",
    "this implies that the most general energy momentum tensor is of the form @xmath74 where @xmath75 is the einstein curvature tensor whereas @xmath76 and @xmath77 are local curvature tensors which are obtained as functional derivatives with respect to the metric of the action functionals @xmath78 and @xmath79 respectively .",
    "moreover , a possible  model ",
    "@xmath80 is the functional @xmath81 where @xmath82 is the classical energy momentum tensor of the scalar field , @xmath83 is a second order bi - differential operator defined by @xmath84 and the modification term @xmath85 is necessary in order to have a covariantly conserved @xmath80 @xcite .",
    "the four parameters @xmath86 are free parameters which can not be determined intrinsically within qft on curved spacetimes , but only by measurements or within a more fundamental theoretical framework .",
    "an alternative  model  @xmath80 can be obtained by taking the functional derivative with respect to the inverse metric of the `` one - loop effective lagrangean '' @xmath87 here @xmath88 is the regular part of the dewitt - schwinger hadamard solution @xmath89 which is a formal series in @xmath59 with purely geometric coefficients @xcite .",
    "in the standard cosmological model the universe is modelled by a friedmann - lematre - robertson - walker ( flrw ) spacetime @xmath90 with manifold @xmath91 and metric @xmath92 .",
    "we consider the case where the spatial slices are diffeomorphic to @xmath93 for simplicity and because this is favoured by observations . here",
    "@xmath94 is cosmological time , whereas the scale factor @xmath95 is a smooth non - negative function whose logarithmic @xmath94-derivative is the hubble rate @xmath96 , which is assumed to be strictly positive in what follows .",
    "further convenient time variables are the conformal time @xmath97 , the scale factor @xmath98 and the redshift @xmath99 , where @xmath100 is the scale factor of today .",
    "these time variables are related by @xmath101 .    given the high symmetry of @xmath90 and the einstein equation @xmath102 , the energy momentum tensor @xmath103 must be of perfect fluid form and thus determined by the energy density @xmath104 and pressure @xmath70 , which are related by the equation of state @xmath105 .",
    "moreover , the einstein equation is equivalent to the ( first ) friedmann equation @xmath106 and a conservation equation . according to the standard model of cosmology ",
    "the @xmath107cdm - model  our universe contains matter , radiation , and dark energy , modelled macroscopically as perfect fluids with equation of state @xmath108 , @xmath109 for matter , radiation and dark energy ( assuming that the latter is just due to a cosmological constant ) respectively . consequently , the friedmann equation can be conveniently rewritten as @xmath110 where @xmath111 is the present hubble rate  the hubble constant  and the constants @xmath112 , @xmath113 , @xmath114 denote the present fractions of the energy density due to dark energy , matter and radiation respectively .",
    "observations indicate approximately @xmath115 see @xcite for the latest exact values from the planck collaboration . in the context of cosmology",
    "the terms `` matter '' and `` radiation '' subsume all matter - energy with the respective macroscopic equation of state such that e.g. `` radiation '' does not encompass only electromagnetic radiation , but also the three left - handed neutrinos present in standard model of particle physics ( sm ) and possibly so - called dark radiation , and `` matter '' subsumes both the baryonic matter which is in principle well - understood in the sm and dark matter . here ,",
    "dark matter and dark radiation both quantify contributions to the macroscopic matter and radiation energy densities which exceed the ones expected from the knowledge of the sm and are believed to originate either from fields not present in the sm or from other sources , i.e. modifications of classical general relativity .",
    "notwithstanding , at least the contributions to the macroscopic matter and radiation energy densities which are in principle well - understood originate microscopically from excitations of quantum fields , thence it should be possible to derive those from first principles within qft on curved spacetimes .",
    "such an analysis of the standard cosmological model within qft on curved spacetimes has been performed by one of us in @xcite and we shall review it in what follows .",
    "a comprehensive analysis from this perspective could proceed as follows .",
    "one considers the full standard model of particle physics plus potential other fields and interactions as a perturbative interacting qft on curved spacetime .",
    "one then aims to find a pair @xmath116 , where @xmath117 is a hadamard state on the algebra of this field model and @xmath118 is a metric on the manifold @xmath91 of flrw type , such that a ) @xmath116 is a solution of the semiclassical einstein equation @xmath119 where @xmath103 is the energy momentum tensor of the field model and b ) are are satisfied up to suitably small corrections .",
    "unfortunately such an analysis is quite involved , but we can consider a number of simplifications .",
    "first , we disregard all field interactions .",
    "this is a legitimate approximation if we consider the cosmological evolution only after the primordial synthesis of light nuclei  the so - called big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn )  as field interactions",
    "are usually assumed to be irrelevant for the large - scale properties of the quantum state after this era . in the standard cosmological model ,",
    "this enters by assuming that the each component of the perfect fluid in satisfies an individual conservation equation . as a further simplification ,",
    "we disregard the spin of the quantum fields and model all massive fields , i.e. `` matter '' , by a single massive scalar field , and all massless fields , i.e. `` radiation '' , by a single massless scalar field , where both fields are considered to be conformally coupled to the scalar curvature ( @xmath120 ) .",
    "this is done for ease of presentation as computations with higher spin fields are in principle straightforward , see for instance @xcite ; the conformal coupling @xmath120 is chosen because it simplifies computations and because the massless dirac equation and the maxwell equation are invariant under conformal isometries . finally , provided one is able to assign a state @xmath117 to a flrw metric @xmath118 in a coherent way , @xmath117 is in general a non - trivial functional of @xmath118 and thus obtaining an explicit solution of the semiclassical einstein equation is at best difficult . in a recent yet unpublished work , pinamonti and siemssen",
    "have proven by a fixed point argument that the semiclassical einstein equation can be uniquely solved for a linear scalar field model and a large class of initial conditions on a cauchy surface , but for a quantitative analysis one needs to know the solution explicitly .",
    "we thus solve the semiclassical einstein equation in the following approximate sense .",
    "we assume that the flrw spacetime is given and determined by and . on this spacetime",
    "we seek to find a pair of quantum states @xmath121 and @xmath122 for the massive and massless scalar field such that the sum of the energy densities in this states satisfies @xmath123 and up to suitably small corrections in the time interval of interest @xmath124 $ ] , where @xmath125 marks the present and @xmath126 is the redshift at which bbn took place .    in order to follow this program ,",
    "it is useful to have at ones disposal a map which assigns a state @xmath117 to a flrw metric @xmath118 _ in a given coordinate system _ ; indeed this is necessary in order for the semiclassical friedmann equation @xmath127 to be well - defined in the first place .",
    "such a construction is provided by the so - called states of low energy introduced by olbermann @xcite .",
    "these states minimize the energy density integrated in ( cosmological ) time with a sampling test function @xmath31 and are pure , gaussian , isotropic and homogeneous states of hadamard type .",
    "their two - point wightman function is ( barring an @xmath67-prescription ) of the form @xmath128 where the modes @xmath129 satisfy the ordinary differential equation @xmath130 and the normalisation condition @xmath131 here , @xmath132 and @xmath133 denotes complex conjugation .",
    "the modes @xmath129 , which determine the state , are obtained by choosing arbitrary but fixed reference modes .",
    "the bogoliubov coefficients in this mode basis are suitable functionals of the reference modes and the sampling function @xmath31 .",
    "olbermann has proven the hadamard property of these states only for the case @xmath134 , but one can show that they are at least sufficiently regular in order to compute the energy density also in the case @xmath120 .",
    "if @xmath120 and @xmath135 , then the hadamard property follows from the fact that these states are related to the minkowski vacuum state by a conformal isometry . in the following , we set @xmath120",
    "a further assignment of a state to a flrw spacetime in a given coordinate system is given by the so - called adiabatic states of order 0 introduced in @xcite and further developed in @xcite .",
    "these are defined by the modes which satisfy and the initial conditions @xmath136 , @xmath137 , where @xmath138 the functions @xmath139 solve exactly but only approximately with error terms quantified by @xmath140 and @xmath141 .",
    "a detailed discussion of the error terms can be found in @xcite .    in the @xmath107cdm model , the radiation contribution @xmath142 to the energy density",
    "is mostly of thermal nature , while the matter contribution @xmath143 is mostly due to dark matter , which in some scenarios is believed to be of thermal origin as well .",
    "motivated by this we look for states which satisfy and among suitable `` thermal excitations '' of states of low energy .",
    "a fully satisfactory generalisation of the concept of thermal equilibrium to general curved spacetimes or even flrw ones does not exist so far .",
    "probably the most elaborated idea is the so - called local thermal equilibrium approach , see e.g. @xcite for a review .",
    "here we take a more pragmatic approach and consider the states introduced in @xcite .",
    "given a pure , gaussian , isotropic and homogeneous hadamard state @xmath117 specified by modes @xmath129 , one can construct a family of gaussian hadamard states @xmath144 by defining the two - point wightman function ( up to an @xmath67-prescription ) as @xmath145 with @xmath146 . if @xmath129 are the modes of a state of low energy , these states match the almost equilibrium states introduced by ksk in @xcite up to the form of @xmath147 . the hadamard property of the states defined by follows from results of @xcite . in the massless case ,",
    "these states are independent of @xmath148 and satisfy the conformal kms condition with respect to the conformal killing vector @xmath149 . in the massive case , they are considered to describe approximately the quantum state of a field which has been in thermal equilibrium in the distant past , and has `` frozen out '' of equilibrium at the time @xmath150 .",
    "this corresponds to the phenomenological picture behind dark matter of thermal origin in the standard literature see e.g. @xcite .",
    "given this choice of quantum states we are left with the cumbersome task to compute the energy density in these states . to this avail , we can rewrite the singular part @xmath151 of a hadamard solution in terms of a fourier integral in order to match the mode expansion of the states at hand , see @xcite . in this way we obtain a fourier integral expression for the regular part @xmath152 of the relevant two - point wightman function .",
    "the energy density is obtained by applying to this regular object a second order bi - differential operator and then taking the limit @xmath153 , cf . .",
    "this is well - defined and independent of @xmath45 if @xmath154 . as a result",
    ", we obtain the energy density as a convergent integral over @xmath155 . in the massless case , this integral can be computed analytically .",
    "in the massive case however , both the integrand and the integral have been computed in @xcite partly numerically and partly using analytical approximations .",
    "the reasons are manifold .",
    "to name a few , the mode equation can not be solved analytically on flrw spacetimes of the form if @xmath156 . moreover",
    ", even a numerical solution fails to be feasible for @xmath157  which is the realistic case as @xmath158ev  because the modes oscillate heavily . to overcome the latter problem the approximate adiabatic modes @xmath139 , cf .",
    ", have been used as reference modes for the computation of the modes of the state of low energy , as they approximate the exact adiabatic modes of order zero particularly well exactly in the the regime @xmath159 .",
    "altogether the following results can be obtained . to discuss these , we rewrite the total energy density of the massless and massive conformally coupled scalar fields in the respective generalised thermal states defined with respect to states of low energy as follows @xmath160    @xmath112 , @xmath161 and @xmath67 parametrise the freedom in the definition of the energy density as per .",
    "the number of free parameters in this equation has been reduced to three , because @xmath76 and @xmath77 are proportional in flrw spacetimes .",
    "we take the point of view that @xmath161 , which effectively renormalises newton s constant , is not a free parameter because newton s constant has been measured already . in order to do this",
    ", we have to fix a value for the inverse length scale @xmath64 in the singular part of a hadamard solution @xmath151 , we do this by confining @xmath162 to be a scale in the range in which the strength of gravity has been measured .",
    "because of the smallness of the planck length , the actual value of @xmath162 in this range does not matter as changing @xmath162 in this interval gives a negligible contribution to the energy density .",
    "one could also take a more conservative point of view and consider @xmath161 to be a free parameter , in this case comparison with cosmological data , e.g. from big bang nucleosynthesis , would presumably constrain @xmath161 to be very small once @xmath162 is in the discussed range .    on this occasion",
    ", we would like to highlight the point of view on the so - called cosmological constant problem taken here , as well as in most works on qft on curved spacetimes in the algebraic approach and e.g. the review @xcite .",
    "it is often said that qft _ predicts _ a value for the cosmological constant @xmath107 and thus for @xmath112 which is way too large in comparison to the one measured .",
    "this conclusion is reached by computing one or several contributions to the vacuum energy in minkowski spacetime @xmath163 and finding them all to be too large , such that , at best , a fine - tuned subtraction in terms of a negative bare cosmological constant @xmath164 is necessary in order to obtain the small value @xmath165 we observe . here",
    ", we assume the point of view that it is not possible to provide an _ absolute _ definition of energy density within qft on curved spacetimes , and thus neither @xmath163 nor @xmath164 have any physical meaning by themselves ; only @xmath165 is physical and measurable and any cancellation which happens in this sum is purely mathematical .",
    "the fact that the magnitude of @xmath163 depends on the way it is computed , e.g. the loop or perturbation order , cf .",
    "e.g. @xcite , is considered to be unnatural following the usual intuition from qft on flat spacetime .",
    "however , it seems more convincing to us to accept that @xmath163 and @xmath164 have no relevance on their own , which does not lead to any contradiction between theory and observations , rather than the opposite . in the recent work @xcite it",
    "is argued that a partial and unambiguous relevance can be attributed to @xmath163 by demanding @xmath164 to be analytic in all coupling constants and masses of the theory ; taking this point of view , one could give the contribution to @xmath163 which is non - analytic in these constants an unambiguous meaning .",
    "indeed the authors of @xcite compute a non - perturbative and hence non - analytic contribution to @xmath163 , which turns out to be small .",
    "in the view of this , one could reformulate the above statement and say that contributions to @xmath163 and @xmath164 which are analytic in masses and coupling constants have no physical relevance on their own .",
    "the term in proportional to @xmath166 , which is not present in the @xmath107cdm - model , appears due to the so - called trace anomaly , which is a genuine quantum and state - independent contribution to the quantum energy momentum tensor , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "this term is fixed by the field content , @xmath167 for two scalar fields .",
    "as @xmath168 in the @xmath107cdm - model for large redshifts , this term can be safely neglected for @xmath169 .",
    "the first terms in denote the genuinely quantum state dependent contributions to the energy densities of the two quantum fields .",
    "we have split these contributions into parts which are already present for infinite inverse temperature parameter @xmath170 in the generalised thermal states , and thus could be considered as contributions due to the states of low energy as generalised vacuum states ( @xmath171 , @xmath172 ) , and into the remaining terms , which could be interpreted as purely thermal contributions ( @xmath173 , @xmath174 ) .",
    "one can show that , up to the freedom parametrised by @xmath112 , @xmath161 and @xmath67 , @xmath175 for arbitrary sampling functions @xmath31 , whereas @xmath176 for small masses @xmath177 and large masses @xmath157 if the sampling function @xmath31 defining the state of low energy has sufficiently large support in time .",
    "this generalises results obtained by degner on de sitter spacetime @xcite and indicates that states of low energy with broad sampling functions are reasonable generalised vacuum states on flrw spacetimes .",

    "one sees nicely how the energy density is minimal in the support of the sampling function at around @xmath186 . ]    as for the thermal contributions , one finds in the massless case @xmath187 up to degree of freedom factors , this gives the @xmath107cdm value @xmath188 if the temperature parameter @xmath189 is in the range of the cosmic microwave background temperature @xmath190k . in the massive case , one can take typical values of @xmath170 , @xmath148 and @xmath6 from chapter 5.2 in @xcite computed by means of effective boltzmann equations . a popular candidate for dark matter",
    "is a weakly interacting massive particle ( wimp ) , e.g. a heavy neutrino , for which @xcite computes @xmath191 using this one finds for large @xmath6 @xmath192 and thus @xmath193 for @xmath194gev .    at this stage , we have already seen that there exist states for the field model under consideration for which the energy density in the time interval @xmath195 $ ] is of the form @xmath196 with @xmath107cdm values for @xmath113 , @xmath114 and @xmath112 .",
    "this is the desired result up to the term @xmath197 which is not present in the @xmath107cdm model , but quantified by the free parameter @xmath67 . to analyse the influence of this term",
    ", we solve the equation @xmath198 as @xmath199 contains second derivatives of @xmath96 , this equation can be rewritten as a second order ordinary differential equation for @xmath200 and solved by choosing e.g. @xmath107cdm initial conditions at @xmath125 .",
    "this analysis is consistent as the derivation of does not only hold for @xmath107cdm - backgrounds , but also for backgrounds of the form .",
    "one finds that for large redshifts @xmath201 , the solution of is of the form @xmath202 with @xmath203 , thus the term @xmath204 effectively generates additional energy density of radiation type in the early universe , i.e. dark radiation .",
    "surprisingly , one finds @xmath205 , but @xmath206 .",
    "this is well in line with earlier results on the stability of the einstein equation with additional higher order derivative terms , e.g. @xcite .",
    "the value of @xmath207 can be constrained by observations of the primordial fractions of light nuclei as predicted by bbn , since the synthesis of these nuclei depends sensitvely on the hubble rate at @xmath208 .",
    "it turns out that @xmath209 is in conflict with observations for @xmath210 , but that the bbn data are compatible with @xmath211 if all dark radiation is attributed to the origin discussed here .",
    "the value of @xmath67 can be constrained also by other means . on the one hand ,",
    "a further bound on @xmath67 can be obtained by analysing the effects of higher derivative contributions to the gravitational lagrangean in the context of inflation .",
    "in fact , an early inflationary model proposed by starobinsky in @xcite is based on an @xmath204 contribution to the energy density . confronting this inflationary model with current cosmic microwave background data yields @xmath212 @xcite .",
    "thus , if inflation occurred due to the @xmath204 contribution to the energy density , then @xmath67 is too small for generating a considerable amount of dark radiation .",
    "however , if inflation has a different origin or did not occur at all , then one obtains the lower bound @xmath213 .",
    "finally , an upper bound on @xmath67 can be obtained by considering the newtonian limit of the semiclassical einstein equation . in this limit , the higher order derivative terms @xmath76 and @xmath77 in generate two yukawa corrections to the newtonian potential of a point mass of opposite sign @xcite . assuming that these corrections do nt cancel on the relevant length scales , one can obtain bounds on the strength and typical length scale of these yukawa terms from torsion - balance experiments @xcite and consequently the upper bound @xmath214 @xcite .",
    "again , this upper bound would imply that @xmath67 is too small for generating a considerable amount of dark radiation .",
    "however , it is still possible that the aforementioned yukawa corrections cancel each other on the length scales relevant for the experiments described in @xcite , such that @xmath67 could be as large as our upper bound , which in this case would give a real bound on one and hence both yukawa corrections .",
    "moreover , the bounds inferred from @xcite and from the analysis reviewed here stem from phenomena on completely different length scales . as a rough estimate we note that the diameter of our observable universe , which today is about @xmath215 m , was at e.g. @xmath126 still @xmath216 m and thus much larger than the submillimeter scales relevant for the torsion - balance experiments .",
    "thus it could be that effects we have not considered yet , e.g. state - dependent effects which are due to the small - scale structure of the quantum states we have fixed only on cosmological scales so far , affect the comparison between the two different sources of input for the determination of @xmath67 .",
    "we conclude that a more fundamental understanding of the standard cosmological model appears to be possible within qft on curved spacetimes . in this framework one",
    "even finds a new free parameter not present in the standard model .",
    "this parameter can potentially account for dark radiation , the existence and nature of which are currently topics of active research .                      c.  dappiaggi , t.  -p .",
