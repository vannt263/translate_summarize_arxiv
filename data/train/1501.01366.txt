    "a main goal in educational assessment is the accurate estimation of each test - taker s ability , which is a kind of latent trait . in a conventional paper - pencil test , this estimation is based on the examinee s responses to a preassembled set of items . on the other hand , in computerized adaptive testing ( cat ) ,",
    "items are selected in real time , i.e. , the next item depends on the already observed responses . in this way",
    ", it is possible to tailor the difficulty of the items to the examinee s ability and estimate the latter more efficiently than that in a paper - pencil test .",
    "this is especially true for examinees at the two extreme ends of the ability distribution , who may otherwise receive items either too difficult or too easy .",
    "cat was originally proposed by lord @xcite and with the rapid development of modern technology it has become popular for many kinds of measurement tasks , such as educational testing , patient reported outcome , and quality of life measurement .",
    "examples of large - scale cats include the graduate management admission test ( gmat ) , the national council licensure examination ( nclex ) for nurses , and the armed services vocational aptitude battery ( asvab ) @xcite .",
    "the two main tasks in a cat , i.e. , ability estimation and item selection , depend heavily on item response theory ( irt ) for modeling the response of the examinee .",
    "this is done by specifying the probability of a correct answer as a function of certain item - specific parameters and the ability level , which is represented by a scalar parameter @xmath0 .",
    "for example , in the two - parameter logistic ( 2pl ) model , the probability of a correct answer is equal to @xmath1 , where @xmath2 .",
    "the item parameters for this model are the difficulty parameter @xmath3 and the discrimination parameter @xmath4 .",
    "the 2pl is an extension of the rasch model @xcite , which corresponds to the special case that @xmath5 . on the other hand",
    ", the 2pl can be generalized by adding a parameter that captures the probability of guessing the right answer ( 3pl model ) .    given",
    "the irt model , a standard approach for item selection , proposed by lord @xcite , is to select the item that maximizes the fisher information of the model at each step . for the above logistic models",
    ", this item selection procedure suggests selecting the item with difficulty parameter @xmath3 equal to @xmath0 .",
    "since @xmath0 is unknown , this implies that the difficulty parameter for item @xmath6 , @xmath7 , should be equal to @xmath8 , the estimate of @xmath0 based on the first @xmath9 observations . as it was suggested by wu @xcite ,",
    "the adaptive estimation of @xmath0 can be achieved via a likelihood - based approach , instead of the non - parametric , robbins - monro @xcite algorithm that had been originally proposed by lord @xcite and can be very inefficient with binary data @xcite .",
    "when @xmath10 is selected to be the maximum likelihood estimator ( mle ) of @xmath0 based on the first @xmath6 observations , the resulting final ability estimator was shown to be strongly consistent and asymptotically normal by ying and wu @xcite under the rasch model and chang and ying @xcite under the 2pl and the 3pl models .",
    "however , while the design and analysis of cat in the educational and statistical literature typically assumes dichotomous irt models , most operational cat programs employ multiple - choice items , for which dichotomous models are unable to differentiate among the ( more than one ) incorrect answers .",
    "this implies a loss of efficiency that could be avoided if a polytomous irt model , such as bock s _ nominal response model _ @xcite , was used instead .",
    "indeed , based on a simulation study , de ayala @xcite found that a cat based on the nominal response model leads to a more accurate ability estimator than a cat that is based on the 3pl model .",
    "however , to our knowledge , there has not been any theoretical support to this claim .",
    "in fact , generalizing the results in @xcite and @xcite in the case of the nominal response model is a very non - trivial problem , since for items with @xmath11 categories there are @xmath12 parameters need to be selected at each step and there is no convenient , explicit form for the item parameters that maximize the fisher information .",
    "our first contribution is that we study theoretically the design of a cat that is based on the nominal response model with an arbitrary number of categories .",
    "specifically , assuming that the response are conditionally independent given the selected items and that the item parameters belong to a bounded set , we prove ( theorem [ theo1 ] ) that the mle of @xmath0 ( with any item selection strategy ) is strongly consistent as the number of administered items goes to infinity .",
    "if additionally each item is selected to maximize the fisher information at the current mle of the ability level , we show that the mle of @xmath0 becomes asymptotically normal and efficient ( theorem [ theo3 ] ) .",
    "the significance of our first work is the design of a cat that is based on the polytomous nominal response model using the full capacity of multiple - choice items , in comparison to a dichotomous model that wastes information by treating them as binary(true / false ) .",
    "our second main contribution in this work is that we show that a cat design with the nominal response model can be used to alleviate the major criticism that is addressed to cat : the fact that test - takers are not allowed to review and revise their answers during the test .",
    "indeed , it is commonly believed that revision conflicts with the adaptive nature of cat , and , hence , decreases efficiency and leads to biased ability estimation @xcite .",
    "thus , none of the currently operational cat programs allows for response revision , which is allowed by the traditional paper - pencil tests .",
    "this has become a main concern for both examinees and testing companies , and for this reason some test programs have decided to switch from cat to other modes of testing @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , it is clear that the response revision feature can provide a more user - friendly environment , by helping alleviate the test - takers anxiety .",
    "it may even lead to a more reliable ability estimation , by reducing the measurement error that is associated with careless mistakes ( that the examinees may correct ) .",
    "therefore , it has been a long - standing problem to incorporate the response revision feature in cat .",
    "certain modified designs have been proposed for this purpose , such as cat with restricted review models @xcite and multistage adaptive testing @xcite , and it has been argued that if appropriate review and revision rules are set , there will be no impact on the estimation accuracy and efficiency @xcite .",
    "however , all these studies ( that either support or oppose response revision in cat ) rely on monte carlo simulation experiments and lack a theoretical foundation .    in this work ,",
    "we propose a cat design that allows for response revision and we establish its asymptotic properties under a rigorous statistical framework . specifically , assuming that we have multiple - choice items with @xmath13 categories , our main idea is to exploit the flexibility of the nominal response model in order to obtain an algorithm that gives partial credit when the examinee corrects a previously wrong answer .",
    "moreover , our setup for revision is very flexible : each examinee is allowed to revise a previous answer at any time during the test as long as each item is revised at most @xmath14 times .",
    "however , this leads to a non - standard experimental design problem which differs from the traditional cat setup in two ways .",
    "first , items need to be selected at certain random times , which are determined by the examinee .",
    "second , information is now accumulated at two time - scales : that of the observations/ responses and that of the items .    in order to address this problem , we assume , as in the context of the standard cat , that responses from different items are conditionally independent and that the nominal response model governs the first response to each item .",
    "however , we now further assume that whenever an item is revised during the test , the new response will follow the conditional pmf of the nominal response model given that previous answers can not be repeated .",
    "our final ability estimator is the maximizer of the conditional likelihood of all observations ( first responses and revisions ) given the selected item parameters and the observed decisions of the examinee to revise or not at each step .",
    "we show ( theorem [ llncat ] ) that this estimator is strongly consistent for any item selection and revision strategy .",
    "when in particular the items are selected to maximize the fisher information of the nominal response model at the current ability estimate and , additionally , the number of revisions is `` small '' relative to the number of items , we show that the proposed estimator is also asymptotically normal , with the same asymptotic variance as that in the regular cat ( theorem [ cltrcat ] ) .    from a practical point of view",
    ", the most important feature of our approach is that it incorporates revision without the need to calibrate any additional item parameters than the ones used in a regular cat that is based on the nominal response model . indeed ,",
    "if a dichotomous irt model was employed instead , incorporating revision would require calibrating the probability of switching from a correct answer to a wrong answer and vice - versa for all items in the pool .",
    "this is a very difficult task in practice and probably infeasible for large - scale implementation .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    ", we introduce the nominal response model and its main properties . in section 3 ,",
    "we focus on the design and asymptotic analysis of a regular cat that is based on the nominal response model . in section 4",
    ", we formulate the problem of cat design that allows for response revision , we present the proposed scheme and establish its asymptotic properties . in section 5 , we present the findings of a simulation study that illustrates our theoretical results .",
    "we conclude in section 6 .",
    "in this section , we introduce the nominal response model , which is the irt model that we will use for the design of cat in next sections . throughout the paper ,",
    "we focus on the case of a single examinee , whose ability is quantified by a scalar parameter @xmath15 that is the quantity of interest .",
    "thus , the underlying probability measure is denoted by @xmath16 .",
    "let @xmath17 be the response to a generic multiple - choice item with @xmath18 categories .",
    "that is , @xmath19 when the examinee chooses category @xmath20 , where @xmath21 , and the nominal response model assumes that @xmath22 where @xmath23 are real numbers that satisfy @xmath24 and the following identifiability conditions : @xmath25 the latter assumption implies that one of the @xmath26 s and one of the @xmath27 s is completely determined by the others . as a result , without loss of generality we can say that the distribution of @xmath17 is completely determined by the ability parameter @xmath0 and the vector @xmath28 . in order to simplify the notation we will write : @xmath29 note that in the case of binary data ( @xmath30 ) , the nominal response model recovers the 2pl model with discrimination parameter @xmath31 and difficulty parameter @xmath32 .",
    "in particular , implies @xmath33 , @xmath34 so that @xmath35 the log - likelihood and the score function of @xmath0 take the form @xmath36 \\ , { \\mathbbm{1}_{\\{x = k\\ } } } ,   \\label{score}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath37 is the following weighted average of the @xmath38 s : @xmath39 the fisher information of @xmath17 as a function of @xmath0 takes the form : @xmath40 = \\sum_{k=1}^{m } \\bigl ( a_{k}-\\bar{a}(\\theta;{\\mathsf{b } } ) \\bigr)^{2 } \\ ,   p_{k}(\\theta;{\\mathsf{b}}),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] whereas the derivative of @xmath41 with respect to @xmath0 does not depend on @xmath17 and is equal to @xmath42 , which justifies the following notation : @xmath43 moreover , @xmath44 is positive and has an upper bound that is independent of @xmath0 , in particular , @xmath45 where we denote @xmath46 and @xmath47 as the maximum and minimum of the @xmath38 s respectively , i.e .. @xmath48 the first inequality holds in because the @xmath26 s can not be identical , due to - .",
    "however , while for any given @xmath15 and @xmath49 we have @xmath50 , from it follows that @xmath51 as @xmath52 and @xmath53 as @xmath54 and , consequently , @xmath55 i.e. the fisher information of the model goes to 0 as the ability level goes to @xmath56 for any given item parameter .    since in practice items are drawn from a given item bank , we will assume that @xmath49 takes value in a compact subset @xmath57 of @xmath58 , a rather realistic assumption whenever we have a given item bank .",
    "this assumption will be technically useful through the following result ( maximum theorem ) , whose proof can be found , for example , in @xcite , p. 239 .",
    "[ lem1 ] if @xmath59 is a continuous function , then @xmath60 and @xmath61 are also continuous functions .",
    "thus , if @xmath62 , then @xmath63 .    as a first illustration of this result , note that since @xmath64 is jointly continuous , then @xmath65 are also continuous functions . moreover , from lemma [ lem1 ] and it follows that there is a universal in @xmath0 upper ( but not lower ) bound on the fisher information that corresponds to each ability level , i.e. , @xmath66",
    "in this section we focus on the design of a cat with a fixed number of items , @xmath67 , each of which has @xmath68 categories .",
    "let @xmath69 denote the response to item @xmath6 , thus , @xmath70 if the examinee chooses category @xmath20 in item @xmath6 , where @xmath21 and @xmath71 .",
    "we assume that the responses are governed by the nominal response model , defined in , so that @xmath72 where @xmath0 is the scalar parameter of interest that represents the ability of the examinee and @xmath73 is a @xmath57-valued vector that characterizes item @xmath6 and satisfies - .",
    "moreover , we assume that the responses are conditionally independent given the selected items , in the sense that @xmath74 however , while in a conventional paper - pencil test the parameters @xmath75 are deterministic , in a cat they are random , determined in real time based on the already observed responses .",
    "specifically , let @xmath76 be the information contained in the first @xmath6 responses , i.e. , @xmath77 .",
    "then , each @xmath78 is an @xmath76-measurable , @xmath57-valued random vector and , as a result , despite assumption , the responses are far from independent and , in fact , they may have a complex dependence structure .",
    "the problem in cat is to find an _ ability estimator _ ,",
    "@xmath79 , at the end of the test , i.e. , an @xmath80-measurable estimator of @xmath0 , and _ an item selection strategy _ , @xmath81 , so that the accuracy of @xmath79 be optimized .",
    "if we were able to select each item @xmath6 so that @xmath82 , where @xmath83 is the maximum fisher information an item can achieve ( recall ) at the true ability level @xmath0 , then we could use standard asymptotic theory in order to obtain an estimator , @xmath79 , such as the mle , that is asymptotically efficient , in the sense that @xmath84^{-1 } \\right ) $ ] as @xmath85 .",
    "of course , this is not a feasible item selection strategy , as it requires knowledge of @xmath0 , the parameter we are trying to estimate !",
    "nevertheless , we can make use of the adaptive nature of cat and select items that maximize the fisher information at the current estimate of the ability level .",
    "that is , @xmath78 can be chosen to belong to @xmath86 where @xmath87 is an estimate of the ability level that is based on the first @xmath6 responses , @xmath71 .",
    "we should note that this item selection method assumes that each @xmath88 can take any value in @xmath57 .",
    "of course , this is not the case in practice , where a given item bank has a finite number of items and there are restrictions on the exposure rate of the items @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , this item selection strategy will provide a benchmark for the best possible performance that can be expected , at least in an asymptotic sense .",
    "the item selection strategy calls for an adaptive estimation of the examinee s ability during the test process . from the conditional independence assumption",
    "it follows that the conditional log - likelihood function of the first @xmath6 responses given the selected items takes the form @xmath89 where @xmath90 is the log - likelihood that corresponds to the @xmath91 response and is determined by the nominal response model , according to .",
    "then , the corresponding score function takes the form @xmath92 where @xmath93 is the score function that corresponds to the @xmath91 item and is defined according to .",
    "we would like our estimate for @xmath0 after the first @xmath6 observations to be the root of @xmath94 .",
    "unfortunately , this root does not exist for every @xmath71 .",
    "indeed , @xmath94 does not have a root when all acquired responses either correspond to the category with the largest @xmath95-value , or to the category with smallest @xmath95-value .",
    "in other words , the root of @xmath94 exists and is unique for every @xmath96 , where @xmath97 for example , in a cat with @xmath98 items of @xmath99 categories where for each item the largest ( resp .",
    "smallest ) @xmath95-value is associated with category @xmath100(resp .",
    "@xmath101 ) , for the sequence of responses @xmath102",
    "we have @xmath103 .    for @xmath104 , an initial estimation procedure is needed to estimate the ability parameter .",
    "a possible initialization strategy is to set @xmath105 and , for every @xmath104 , @xmath106 ( resp .",
    "@xmath107 ) if the acquired responses have the largest ( resp .",
    "smallest ) @xmath95-value , whereas @xmath108 is a predetermined constant .",
    "we now focus on the asymptotic properties of @xmath109 as @xmath85 , thus we will assume without loss of generality that @xmath79 is the root of @xmath110 for sufficient large values of @xmath67 . specifically , we will establish the strong consistency of @xmath79 for any item selection strategy and its asymptotic normality and efficiency when the information maximizing item selection is adopted .",
    "both properties rely heavily on the martingale property of the score function , @xmath110 , which is established in the following proposition .",
    "[ prop1 ] for any item selection strategy , @xmath111 , the score process @xmath112 is a @xmath113-martingale with bounded increments , mean @xmath114 and predictable variation @xmath115 , where @xmath116 and @xmath117 is the fisher information of the @xmath118 item , defined in .",

    "[ theo1 ] for any item selection strategy , as @xmath85 we have @xmath131    let @xmath111 be an arbitrary item selection strategy . from proposition [ prop1 ]",
    "it follows that @xmath110 is a @xmath132-martingale with mean @xmath114 and predictable variation @xmath133 , since @xmath134 .",
    "then , from the martingale strong law of large numbers ( see , e.g. , @xcite , p. 124 ) , it follows that as @xmath85 @xmath135 from a taylor expansion of @xmath127 around @xmath79 it follows that there exists some @xmath136 that lies between @xmath109 and @xmath0 so that @xmath137 where the second equality follows from . from and we then obtain @xmath138 the strong consistency of @xmath109 will then follow as long as we can guarantee that the fraction in the last relationship remains bounded away from @xmath114 as @xmath85 .",

    "therefore , the proposed design leads to the same asymptotic behavior as that in the regular cat design , as long as the proportion of revisions is small relative to the number of distinct items .",
    "we expect that this is typically the case in practice , since most examinees tend to review and revise only a few items which they are not sure during the test process or at the end of the test .",

    "moreover , we assumed that whenever the examinee decides to revise , each of the previous items that have not been revised yet are equally likely to be selected .    for each of the above scenarios , we computed the root mean square error ( rmse ) of the final estimation on the basis of @xmath344 simulation runs .",
    "the results are summarized in table [ tabler ] .",
    "note that when revision is allowed , the design is denoted as rcat .",
    "we observe that revision often improves the ability estimation , especially when the number of revisions is large .",

    "second , because it can be used in a natural way to allow for response revision .",

    "this may call for modifications of the item selection strategy in order to make the proposed scheme more robust ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , more empirical work is required in order to understand the effect of response revision on the ability estimation , which can be much more substantial in practice than in the ( idealistic ) setup of our simulation study .    while our approach is robust , in the sense that we do not explicitly model the decision of the examinee to revise or not at each step given the selected items , it may result in a loss of efficiency when the revision strategy depends on the ability of the examinee . modeling",
    "this behavior is a challenge that could be addressed as soon as cats that allow for response revision begin to be implemented in practice and relevant data can be obtained .",
    "finally , it remains an open problem to incorporate response revision in the case of binary items , where a dichotomous irt model needs to be used and our approach can not be applied .",

    "<S> in computerized adaptive testing ( cat ) , items ( questions ) are selected in real time based on the already observed responses , so that the ability of the examinee can be estimated as accurately as possible . </S>",
    "<S> this is typically formulated as a non - linear , sequential , experimental design problem with binary observations that correspond to the true or false responses . </S>",
    "<S> however , most items in practice are multiple - choice and dichotomous models do not make full use of the available data . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , cat has been heavily criticized for not allowing test - takers to review and revise their answers . in this work , </S>",
    "<S> we propose a novel cat design that is based on the polytomous nominal response model and in which test - takers are allowed to revise their responses at any time during the test . </S>",
    "<S> we show that as the number of administered items goes to infinity , the proposed estimator is ( i ) strongly consistent for any item selection and revision strategy and ( ii ) asymptotically normal when the items are selected to maximize the fisher information at the current ability estimate and the number of revisions is smaller than the number of items . </S>",
    "<S> we also present the findings of a simulation study that supports our asymptotic results .    </S>"
