    "analyses of the distribution of final state hadrons world it is common to refer to all of the final state particles other than the scattered lepton as the `` hadrons '' . ] in @xmath0 scattering events can provide tests of the theory of strong interactions , quantum chromo - dymamics ( qcd ) .",
    "these studies have yielded information on the value and running of @xmath1 , on the physics of parton shower evolution , on the structure of the photon and proton and on the underlying parton scattering dynamics .",
    "there are too many recent results from h1 and zeus to attempt a complete review here .",
    "instead i will concentrate on the measurement of fragmentation functions in deep inelastic scattering ( dis )  @xcite , some results from the measurement of jet cross sections in photoproduction  @xcite , a study of prompt photon production  @xcite and some results from the comparison of the hadronic final state produced in deep inelastic scattering with that produced in photoproduction  @xcite .",
    "these results pertain to data collected in the 1994 and 1995 periods of data taking , during which hera provided collisions of 27.5  gev positrons against 820.0  gev protons , delivering about 3  nb@xmath2 and 6  nb@xmath2 of luminosity respectively .",
    "in the leading order quark parton model of dis , the incident positron scatters from a quark in the proton via the exchange of a boson whose negative invariant mass squared is denoted @xmath3 .",
    "the quark carries a fraction @xmath4 of the proton s longitudinal momentum and energy into the hard subprocess .",
    "this simple picture is sufficient to allow the appreciation of the results presented here .      to characterize the parton showering and subsequent hadronization which determine the distribution of hadrons in the final state",
    ", the distribution of the scaled momentum @xmath5 is measured .",
    "the scaled momentum is defined as the magnitude of a hadron s momentum relative to the maximum momentum available to it , @xmath6 .",
    "the measurement of scaled momentum distributions is carried out in the `` breit '' or `` brickwall '' frame where @xmath7 . in this frame",
    "the current hemisphere in dis is directly comparable to one hemisphere in an @xmath8 annihilation event where the centre - of - mass energy @xmath9 would represent the energy scale , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 .",
    "in fact a variable transformation is commonly made to @xmath12 which has an approximately gaussian distribution .",
    "the distribution of @xmath13 is called a fragmentation function . as an example ,",
    "fragmentation functions in two bins of @xmath3 are shown in figure  [ fig : fragf0_h1 ]    for data taken by h1 during the 1993 running period  @xcite .",
    "the data support the intuitive expectation that as @xmath3 increases , the average charged multiplicity should increase , @xmath14 should decrease , and @xmath15 should increase .    to quantify the @xmath3 evolution of @xmath16 ,",
    "a gaussian fit of the @xmath13 distribution has been made for several different @xmath10 bins .",
    "the resulting fit parameters for the peaks of the gaussian distributions , @xmath17 , are shown in figure  [ fig : fragf3_h1 ]  @xcite .",
    "the data are consistent with a qcd inspired picture of fragmentation in which @xmath17 is expected to scale approximately linearly with @xmath18 .",
    "a pure phase space model would entail a slope of unity in the dependence of @xmath17 on @xmath18 while a fit to the data yield @xmath19 .",
    "therefore the data prefer coherent fragmentation as predicted by qcd .",
    "( see also reference  @xcite and references therein . )",
    "results for the evolution of the @xmath17 fit parameter with @xmath9 for @xmath8 data are also shown in figure  [ fig : fragf3_h1 ] .",
    "the consistency of the @xmath8 data with the @xmath0 data supports the application of a single universal treatment of parton showering and hadronization .",
    "deep inelastic scattering processes ( figure  [ fig : hpp](a ) ) are characterized by rather high values of the negative squared four momentum of the boson ( usually a photon ) , @xmath20 @xmath21@xmath22  gev@xmath23 .    in photoproduction on the other hand",
    "the photon is nearly real .",
    "when jets are produced in photoproduction , their transverse energy sets the energy scale of the process , also often represented by @xmath3 .    at leading order there are two photoproduction processes which lead to the production of high transverse energy jets . in `` direct '' photoproduction",
    "the photon participates directly in a hard scattering with a parton from the proton as illustrated in figure  [ fig : hpp](b ) . in",
    "`` resolved '' photoproduction ( figure  [ fig : hpp](c ) ) the photon first fluctuates into a hadronic state a parton from which enters the hard subprocess .",
    "it is therefore necessary to introduce another bjorken scaling variable , denoted @xmath24 , which represents the fraction of the photon s momentum which is carried by the interacting parton .",
    "zeus has measured the dijet photoproduction cross section differential in the average jet pseudorapidity , @xmath25 , for events with at least two @xmath26  gev jets  @xcite . by making the requirement that @xmath27",
    ", we effectively examine the direct photoproduction cross section  @xcite .",
    "the results are shown in figure  [ fig : jets_hixg_zeus](a )    where three different jet finders have been used to define the cross section .",
    "eucell and pucell are cone algorithms which satisfy the snowmass convention  @xcite .",
    "the difference between them illustrates the sensitivity of the measurements to the choice of seed particle and the treatment of overlapping cones .",
    "ktclus is a cluster jet finding algorithm  @xcite .",
    "the results are compared to next to leading order ( nlo ) predictions for the cross sections using the ktclus algorithm and two different values of the r@xmath28 parameter  @xcite .",
    "( r@xmath28 defines the farthest distance in pseudorapidity and azimuth that two partons can have from one another and still be combined into one jet  @xcite . ) the prediction shown by the dashed line may be directly compared with either the pucell or ktclus cross sections which are equivalent at nlo and have an effective r@xmath28 value of 1 .",
    "the theory provides a reasonably good description of both the normalization and shape of the measured distribution . in eucell",
    "the effective value of r@xmath28 is not precisely defined but is in the range 1.5@xmath292 .",
    "the theory is therefore able to describe the spread of the cross sections due to the different jet finding algorithms .",
    "the situation is considerably worse for the resolved photon processes .",
    "the cross section @xmath30 for @xmath31 is shown in figure  [ fig : jets_hixg_zeus](b ) . here",
    "the nlo calculation for the ktclus algorithm ( dashed line ) does not describe the measured ktclus cross section . also the cross section suffers more variation under change of jet algorithm and this variation is not describable by the nlo calculation .",
    "however it must be noted that much of the uncertainty due to the photon structure is contained in the resolved sample and that also the higher order processes which are not included in the fixed order calculation would show up at low @xmath24 .",
    "it is possible to define an effective parton distribution of the photon , @xmath32 , which can be measured in photoproduction  @xcite .",
    "note that in contrast to deep inelastic @xmath33 experiments which only determine the quark content of the photon , the hera @xmath34 measurements are sensitive also to the gluonic term of @xmath35 . by comparison of measured parton level cross sections with the pythia  @xcite monte carlo",
    "leading order prediction h1 have extracted the effective parton distribution of the photon in three bins of @xmath24 as a function of the hard scattering scale , @xmath36 ( the square of the partonic transverse momentum ) .",
    "@xcite this is shown in figure  [ fig : jets_pdf_h1 ] .",
    "the data are consistent with a logarithmic rise of @xmath35 with @xmath36 .",
    "we recall that a calculation of the quark content of the photon from the box diagram @xmath37 yields the form @xmath38",
    "it is therefore interesting to speculate whether the logarithmic rise of @xmath39 with @xmath40 reveals a component of the resolved photon which results directly from a splitting of the photon into a @xmath41 pair .",
    "this has been called the `` anomalous '' component in contrast to that part of the photon s structure which behaves as though the photon has fluctuated into a vector meson .",
    "a particularly interesting photoproduction event topology occurs when a high transverse energy photon takes the place of one of the jets .",
    "such processes are called prompt photon processes .",
    "these events provide a clean qcd laboratory for the study of quark jet showering and fragmentation and for the measurement of the quark content of the resolved photon .",
    "this is also the best process for the study of initial - final state qcd coherence . in direct photoproduction",
    "there is a single flow of colour from the incoming to the outgoing quark , in contrast to the situation in generic dijet production where many different possible colour flows contribute to each event topology .    to select a sample of prompt photon events",
    "a jet and an isolated electromagnetic energy deposit in the zeus barrel calorimeter with no associated charged particle found in the tracking chamber , are required .",
    "however some dijet events , where one jet consists largely of a single @xmath42 or @xmath43 , can pass this selection .",
    "this contribution can be understood using a monte carlo simulation as shown in figure  [ fig : prompt_zeus](a )  @xcite .",
    "the fraction of the electromagnetic shower energy which is contained in the highest energy calorimeter cell is denoted @xmath44 .",
    "photons give signals with higher values of @xmath44 than the @xmath42 background and it is possible to describe the measured distribution of @xmath44 by allowing for a small @xmath42 component .",
    "this also allows for an admixture of @xmath43 s .    the @xmath24 distribution for prompt photon events after subtraction of the @xmath42 background is shown in figure  [ fig : prompt_zeus](b ) .",
    "the distribution is roughly consistent in shape and normalization with a leading order qcd prediction .",
    "most of the events have high values of @xmath24 and are therefore associated with direct prompt photon production .",
    "we look forward to a larger sample of prompt photon events with the 1996 and 1997 delivered luminosities .",
    "two interesting recent results compare the hadronic final states in deep inelastic scattering and photoproduction .",
    "these studies are particularly appealing to the experimentalist since it is possible to make some interpretation of the data which does not rely on a comparison of the data to theory .",
    "h1 has measured the flow of transverse energy in the hadronic centre of mass frame across a large range of @xmath3 , as shown in figure  [ fig : etflow1_h1 ]  @xcite .",
    "the hadronic centre of mass frame pseudorapidity , @xmath45 , is defined such that the proton direction is negative so the current region is at positive @xmath45 .",
    "the @xmath46 in the current region of course grows with @xmath47 .",
    "however the remarkable feature of this distribution is that the mean transverse energy in the central region , @xmath48 , is practically independent of @xmath3 from the soft photoproduction region , @xmath49 , up to the very deep inelastic region , @xmath50  gev@xmath23 .",
    "h1 therefore find that there is a smooth transition in the development of the global flow of transverse energy between the photoproduction and dis regimes .",
    "a complementary result from zeus concerns the internal structure of jets  @xcite .",
    "the jets are found using a cone algorithm with jet radius @xmath51 .",
    "the jet shape parameter , @xmath52 , has been defined as the fraction of the jets transverse energy which is contained within a smaller concentric cone of radius @xmath53 .",
    "this is shown in figure  [ fig : shapesgp9bw_zeus ] for a sample of photoproduction events which have two jets of @xmath54  gev and @xmath55 .",
    "the jet shape is shown separately for direct and resolved photon events .",
    "the jet shape for the @xmath56 sample is narrower than the shape of the jets for the resolved photon sample .",
    "this effect is reproduced by the parton shower monte carlo model pythia .",
    "allowing for secondary interactions between the photon and proton remnant particles in the simulation improves the description of the @xmath57 data .",
    "one can speculate that the observed difference in the high and low @xmath24 jet shapes is due primarily to the colour charge of the parton which initiates the jet . in direct photoproduction",
    "this parton is predominantly a quark whilst in resolved photoproduction the jets are much more often initiated by gluons .",
    "if the direct photoproduction jets are narrower than the resolved photoproduction jets because of the predominance of quark jets , then one would expect the jet shapes of the high @xmath24 events to be comparable to jet shapes in dis .",
    "this is indeed the case as shown in figure  [ fig : shapes61_zeus ]  @xcite .",
    "the high @xmath24 jet shape is shown in four bins of @xmath58 and is found to be comparable with the jet shape for dis events ( @xmath59  gev@xmath23 ) having at least one @xmath60  gev jet  @xcite .",
    "quantum chromodynamics is a successful theory . for a number of years",
    "it has been clearly established that in the perturbative regime qcd matrix elements describe the dynamics of parton scattering .",
    "here it is shown that @xmath0 scattering provides the means to perform detailed tests of the qcd inspired models for parton showering and hadronization .",
    "these models , as implemented in monte carlo event generators , are able to describe the measured observables .",
    "there is also strong evidence that the fragmentation process has a universal nature given the similarity of the hadronic final states in @xmath8 and in dis events as well as in dis and photoproduction events .",
    "my thanks to the members of the h1 and zeus collaborations who have performed the analyses discussed here .",
    "the organizers of the lake louise winter institute are to be congratulated for having succeeded to provide a most enjoyable and stimulating atmosphere for the exchange of ideas ."
