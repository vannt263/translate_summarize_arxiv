    "potential - energy curves for the interaction of two mercury atoms in their lowest excited configuration ( @xmath2 ) have previously been calculated and used to estimate the chemi - ionization cross sections for collisions of two such atoms @xcite . however , those potential curves were not accurate at distances beyond the valence region , which are of great importance in thermal and cold collisions .",
    "reactions at such energies are pertinent to modeling of fluorescent lamps as well as recent considerations of mercury as a candidate for an atomic clock @xcite . in the present work ,",
    "the long - range interactions are calculated and combined with the short - range parts of the previously calculated potential curves @xcite in order to provide better estimates of the chemi - ionization cross sections .",
    "chemi - ionization is allowed if the potential energy of the two interacting hg atoms lies higher than the potential energy of ground - state hg@xmath7 at any internuclear distance @xmath8 . for hg(@xmath3)+hg(@xmath3 ) , hg(@xmath4)+hg(@xmath3 ) , hg(@xmath4)+hg(@xmath4 ) , hg(@xmath5)+hg(@xmath3 ) , and hg(@xmath5)+hg(@xmath9 only associative ionization @xmath10 utilizing the attractive interaction energy between hg@xmath11 and ground - state hg , is possible at very low energies since their total excitation energies are smaller than the ionization potential of hg .",
    "however , as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , based on the potential curves of hg@xmath12 and hg@xmath7 , essentially all chemi - ionization in mercury at very low collision energies , even for the other reactant pairs , hg(@xmath5)+hg(@xmath5 ) , hg(@xmath6)+hg(@xmath3 ) , hg(@xmath6)+hg(@xmath4 ) , hg(@xmath5)+hg(@xmath6 ) , and hg(@xmath6)+hg(@xmath6 ) , can be expected to be of the associative type and will be referred to as associative ionization ( ai ) henceforth .    for nonsymmetric atomic states ( i.e. , both atoms having @xmath13 ) , the leading term in the long - range interaction is generally of the form @xmath14 , where @xmath15 can be positive or negative .",
    "however , we will show that @xmath13 is neither a necessary nor sufficient condition for @xmath16 . if @xmath15 is positive and sufficiently large , then reactions such as ai , which occur at short range , are precluded . in all cases there is also an attractive van der waals interaction of the form @xmath17 .",
    "for the ten possible combinations of the @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and @xmath6 states that may react , there are total of 90 potential - energy curves describing the interactions .",
    "the ai cross section of only one of these pairs  hg(@xmath4)+hg(@xmath3)has been measured experimentally ( although one experiment apparently misidentified these reactants as hg(@xmath3)+hg(@xmath3 ) ) .",
    "this experimental value is particularly useful in validating the present cross sections since the autoionization width has not yet been calculated but is assumed to be large .",
    "the experimental cross section , combined with the theoretical potential curves , suggests that the autoionization width is indeed sufficiently large to saturate ionization when the continuum is penetrated at short range .",
    "the quadrupole moments of the mercury atom in its @xmath2 @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and @xmath6 states ( the quadrupole moment of the @xmath3 atom vanishes by symmetry ) , as well as the off - diagonal matrix elements , are calculated using the _ ab initio",
    "_ relativistic valence configuration - interaction ( ci ) method based on the brueckner orbitals @xcite , which effectively includes core polarization . in addition , the random - phase - approximation ( rpa ) chain of diagrams is included .",
    "this method expands the two - particle basis functions as @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the parity of the state @xmath20 and @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the total angular momentum and its projection .",
    "the weights @xmath23 are determined by solving the eigenvalue problem based on the hamiltonian in the model space spanned by the basis functions defined in the subspace of virtual orbitals @xmath24 are normalization factors , the @xmath25 are creation operators , and the quasivacuum state @xmath26 corresponds to a closed - shell core containing 78 of the 80 electrons of the hg atom .",
    "the one - particle orbitals @xmath27 are determined by solving a dirac equation @xmath28 here @xmath29 includes the rest mass term , kinetic energy , and the coulomb interaction with the nucleus .",
    "@xmath30 is the dirac - hartree - fock ( dhf ) potential due to core electrons .",
    "@xmath31 is the self - energy operator computed in the second - order approximation ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "qualitatively , this correction describes a response of a valence electron to polarization of the core by the electron s own field and is the dominant correlation effect .",
    "the resulting one - particle orbitals are usually referred to as brueckner orbitals .",
    "once the brueckner orbitals are computed , we solve the ci problem in the model space .",
    "the model space hamiltonian includes the coulomb interaction between valence electrons .",
    "we do not include so - called screening corrections to the hamiltonian . as demonstrated  @xcite , these corrections , although computationally expensive , are relatively insignificant for divalent atoms .    with the determined ci wave functions we form a matrix element of the quadrupole operator .",

    "further we employ the rpa approximation @xcite , which accounts for shielding of an externally applied field by the core electrons and substitutes dressed matrix elements for the bare one - particle matrix elements .",
    "the quadrupole - quadrupole interaction energy between two atoms is given by @xcite @xmath36 where @xmath37 the quadrupole spherical tensor is defined by @xmath38 where the sum goes over all atomic electrons ( though in the case of hg(@xmath2 ) only the unpaired @xmath39 electron contributes ) .",
    "the quadrupole moments @xmath40 ) are defined , as conventional , by the component in the `` stretched '' @xmath41 state : @xmath42 ( note the factor of 2 ; some definitions do nt include this factor @xcite ) and is related to the reduced matrix element , given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : redmatel ] ) , by a factor derived from the wigner - eckart theorem @xcite , @xmath43 so that @xmath44 both the reduced matrix elements and the conventional quadrupole moments are given in table [ table : quadrupole ] .",
    "the accuracy of these moments is expected to be a few percent ( for example , we find that the rpa shielding reduces the ci values for quadrupole moments by less than 3% ) .",
    "we also note that nonrelativistically the ratio @xmath45 , while in our calculations this ratio is @xmath46 .",
    "this deviation reflects the importance of relativistic corrections for the heavy mercury atom .    for a particular pair of atomic states",
    "@xmath47 and @xmath48 , the hamiltonian @xmath49 for the reduced quadrupole moment can be obtained in a double atomic basis . for two atoms in the same state ,",
    "@xmath50 and @xmath51 for the initial and final state , respectively .",
    "for the two like atoms in different states , @xmath52 , symmetric and antisymmetric linear combinations of the functions on centers i and ii must be formed , @xmath53 and @xmath54 the quadrupole ",

    "thus the hg(@xmath3)+hg(@xmath5 ) collision possesses a long - range @xmath14 interaction even though the hg(@xmath3 ) atom has no quadrupole moment . using the conditions @xmath60 , where @xmath61 is the total angular momentum projection and a good molecular quantum number",
    ", we get the matrix elements @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",
    "the @xmath15 coefficients are given by the eigenvalues of this matrix .",
    "the eigenvectors can be used to complete identification of the molecular state @xmath64 where @xmath65 , @xmath66 , @xmath67 , and @xmath68 distinguishes states of the same symmetry . in a few cases of double zero eigenvalues it was necessary to take the symmetric and antisymmetric linear combinations of the degenerate eigenvectors .",
    "the resulting @xmath15 coefficients are given in table [ table : c5+c6 ] .",
    "it can be seen that of the total 90 distinct molecular states , 37 have positive ( repulsive ) @xmath15 coefficients , 32 have negative ( attractive ) @xmath15 coefficients , and 21 have zero @xmath15 coefficients .",
    "of the 21 states with zero @xmath15 coefficients , 12 are `` nonobligatory '' in the sense that nonzero values would be allowed by the selection rules .",
    "the dispersive van der waals interaction between two atoms , @xmath17 can be accurately calculated in terms of the dynamic polarizabilities of the two atoms .",
    "it can be approximately calculated in terms of the static polarizabilities of the two atoms , @xmath70 and @xmath71 . only the latter are available for excited mercury atoms .",
    "the most frequently used approximation @xcite for the @xmath69 coefficient in terms of the static polarizabilities is the slater - kirkwood formula @xcite @xmath72 where @xmath73 and @xmath74 are the numbers of electrons in the outer shells of the two atoms .",
    "however , there exists relatively little experience with excited states . to validate the approximation and get some idea of its accuracy we sought similar systems where _ both _ accurate static polarizabilites and accurate van der waals coefficients are available .",
    "two apropos systems were found : ( 1 ) rare - gas dimers with both atoms in excited @xmath5 states and ( 2 ) zinc dimers with one atom excited ( @xmath75 or @xmath76 ) and the other atom in the ground state . in both cases",
    "the @xmath69 coefficients were calculated using the exact casimir - polder formula @xcite in terms of the frequency - dependent polarizabilities .",
    "the comparison of the slater - kirkwood and casimir - polder results in table [ table : slater - kirkwood ] suggests an accuracy of @xmath77 .    the _ ab initio _ values obtained by rosenkrantz _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite for the static polarizabilities of the mercury atom in its @xmath2 @xmath78 and @xmath79 states with @xmath80 and @xmath81 projections , neglecting spin - orbit coupling , are given in table [ table : polarizabilities ] .",
    "these values have been transformed to the @xmath21-@xmath82 representation using the transformation matrix given in their paper , which was determined by fitting the experimental atomic term values @xcite .",
    "this transformation assumes that the radial functions of states with the same @xmath83 but different @xmath84 are essentially the same .",
    "no experimental values are available for the excited states , but their values for the ground - state of mercury , @xmath85 calculated with a 2-electron relativistic effective core potential ( ecp ) and 34.3 calculated with a 12-electron relativistic ecp , can be compared with the experimental value , @xmath86 @xcite .",
    "the excited - state polarizabilities that we use for the triplet states were calculated with the 12-electron relativistic ecp , but the singlet excited states were calculated only with the 2-electron relativistic ecp .",
    "rosenkrantz _ et al . _",
    "@xcite also did a similar calculation of the static polarizabilities of the excited zinc atom with a relativistic 2-electron ecp .",
    "we may get some additional idea of the accuracy of the mercury polarizabilities by comparing these results with those of ellingsen _ et al . _",
    "@xcite for zinc , given in table [ table : slater - kirkwood ] .",
    "the results of ellingsen _ et al . _",
    "presumably should be of of higher accuracy since they account for core polarization ; also , their value for the ground - state polarizability is in excellent agreement with the experimental value .",
    "this comparison is shown in table [ table : rosenkrantz - ellingsen ] .",
    "the triplet and singlet excited - state polarizabilties of rosenkrantz _",
    "_  are @xmath87 and @xmath88 larger , respectively , than those of ellingsen _",
    "et al._. this agreement is quite satisfactory for the triplet states , but less so for the singlet states .",
    "these comparisons suggest that the uncertainty in the @xmath69 coefficients , which we present below , arises more from the static polarizabilities themselves than from use of the slater - kirkwood approximation .",
    "the eigenvectors @xmath89 of eq .",
    "( [ eq : h2 ] ) were used to calculate the polarizabilities for the atomic states forming each molecular state @xmath90 where @xmath91 is a diagonal matrix containing the polarizabilities of table [ table : polarizabilities](b ) on the diagonal .",
    "the corresponding @xmath69 coefficient is then obtained using eq .",
    "( [ eq : sk ] ) .",
    "these eigenvectors , which were obtained for the leading asymptotic interaction , are expected to still be a reasonable approximation when higher - order terms are included .",
    "the resulting @xmath69 coefficients are given in table [ table : slater - kirkwood ] .",
    "they can be seen to vary significantly among the various states , with the interactions involving the singlet atom generally being the larger because of its greater polarizability .",
    "however , the comparison in table [ table : rosenkrantz - ellingsen ] suggests that the rosenkrantz _",
    "et al . _",
    "polarizabilities for the singlet states may be significantly too large .",
    "if these polarizabilities are reduced by the same factor , 0.56 , as for zinc , the @xmath69 coefficients would be reduced by a factor of about 0.66 for the molecular states arising from a @xmath6 atom interacting with a @xmath92 atom and a factor of about 0.42 for the molecular states arising from the interaction of two @xmath6 atoms . at least for zinc",
    ", the uncertainty in the triplet atomic polarizabilities appears to be much smaller  the values of ellingsen _ et al . _",
    "being only 10% smaller than those of rosenkrantz _",
    "et al . _ similar changes for mercury would reduce the @xmath69 coefficients by about a factor of 0.86 for molecular states formed from two triplet atoms and by about a factor of 0.92 for molecular states formed from a singlet and a triplet atom . with both changes",
    "simultaneously , the effect on the @xmath69 coefficients for a singlet and triplet pair are approximately multiplicative .",
    "the long - range potentials are very important , even dominant , for ai in low - energy collisions of two excited mercury atoms . for the present estimates of the cross sections ,",
    "we adopt a model similar to that used in ref .",
    "@xcite ; i.e. , ionization is assumed to occur if the trajectory on the quantum - mechanical potential curve has a classical turning point smaller than both the black - sphere distance @xmath93 and the crossing distance @xmath94 ( if any ) of the potential curve with the hg@xmath7 potential curve .",
    "the choice of @xmath95   is discussed in ref .",

    "also , note two typos in ref .",
    "@xcite : ( 1 ) in table ii , @xmath98 has only one state of @xmath99 symmetry , and ( 2 ) in the caption of fig .  3 , @xmath100=dash dot . ] for each potential curve , the ai cross section is taken to be @xmath101 ^ 2 .\\ ] ] the first two impact parameters depend only on the short - range potential .",
    "the largest impact parameter accessing the black - sphere distance is @xmath102 and the largest impact parameter accessing the crossing into the continuum is @xmath103 assuming the collision energy @xmath104 exceeds the potential energies @xmath105 at these points .",
    "the value of @xmath106 , determined by the long - range potential , is given by [ see appendix ] @xmath107 where @xmath108 is obtained by numerically solving @xmath109 with @xmath110 for its largest real root .",
    "it can be seen in table [ table : crossings ] that most of the contributions to the ai cross sections at a collision energy of 0.00095 a.u .",
    "are limited by the long - range potentials , which determine the classical orbiting impact parameter .",
    "however , it should be kept in mind that the potential energy at the curve crossing ( if any ) and the black - sphere distance provide a necessary condition . for ai to occur",
    ", the collision energy must exceed the potential energy at these distances .",
    "thus , without tunneling , which can be expected to be negligible except possibly in ultracold collisions , the cross section will vanish at sufficiently low energies if the interatomic potential energy is positive at either of these distances . at the collision energy of 0.00095 a.u .",
    ", 47 of the 90 potential curves do not contribute to ai for this reason . at still lower collision energies ,",
    "the contributions that are energetically allowed are increasingly determined by the long - range potentials . at @xmath111 a.u . , the non - zero contributions are entirely determined by the long - range potentials .",
    "we now examine the sensitivity of the cross sections to the parameters , in particular @xmath69 and @xmath93 , which are most uncertain .",
    "the classical orbiting cross section is simply obtained for pure power - law potential energy curves [ see appendix ] : for @xmath112 it is @xmath113 and for @xmath114 , @xmath115 . with the dependence @xmath116 , a reduction in @xmath69 by a factor of 0.66 would decrease the cross section by only a factor of 0.87 ,",
    "so the sensitivity is not too great .",
    "the uncertainty due to the parameters associated with the short - range potentials , in particular whether @xmath96 and @xmath97 are positive or negative , is greater than this .    for low - energy collisions ,",
    "there is little uncertainty due to @xmath117 , which is more - or - less arbitrarily chosen ( see ref .",
    "this does not necessarily mean that the magnitude of the autoionization width , which is presently unknown , is unimportant .",
    "it does mean that , accepting the black - sphere model , the value taken for @xmath93 is not critical . if the width is large enough to saturate ionization in the energetically allowed region , its exact magnitude will be unimportant . if not saturated , the width will reduce the size of the cross section by a factor that approaches a constant at low energies .",
    "the total ai cross sections are given by statistically weighted sums over all the potential curves arising from the pair of atomic reactants @xmath118 and @xmath119 , @xmath120 where the sum goes over the molecular states listed in table [ table : c5+c6 ] for each reaction .",
    "this sum reflects the double degeneracy of the @xmath121 states and the pairing of @xmath122@xmath123 states in the cases of nonidentical states .",
    "the resulting cross sections are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : xsecs ] .",
    "these cross sections are expected to be valid down to energies where the scattering is predominantly @xmath124-wave .",
    "the maximum contributing angular momentum is roughly @xmath125 where @xmath126 is the reduced mass and the impact parameter @xmath106 is given in the appendix .",
    "for an attractive @xmath14 potential , @xmath127 , and for a @xmath17 potential , @xmath128 for hg@xmath129+hg@xmath129 collisions . thus the semiclassical description , which requires @xmath130 , should be valid above collision energies of @xmath131 a.u .",
    "( temperature of @xmath132 @xmath126k ) with typical @xmath15 coefficients and above @xmath133 a.u .",
    "( temperature of @xmath134 @xmath126k ) when all @xmath15 coefficients vanish .",
    "given the uncertainty in the short - range potentials , it is of interest to consider another approximation to the ai cross sections that might have validity at very low collision energies .",
    "such an approximation can be obtained by considering only the long - range potentials , i.e. @xmath135 instead of eq .",
    "[ eq : xsecs ] .",
    "this approximation neglects any reduction due to repulsion in the short - range potential .",
    "these cross sections are shown as dashed curves in fig .",
    "[ fig : xsecs ] .    at very low energies",
    "the dependence of the cross section on energy tends to be a power law : @xmath136 in cases with contributing attractive @xmath14 potentials and @xmath137 otherwise . at sufficiently low energies ,",
    "potential curves with positive @xmath15 coefficients will cease to contribute to the cross section , and potential curves with negative @xmath15 coefficients will have this contribution dominate over any contribution from the @xmath69 potential .",
    "the thermal average @xmath138 is particularly easy to obtain for a cross section having power law dependence . for @xmath139 @xmath140 where @xmath141 is the euler gamma function , with pertinent values @xmath142 and",
    "@xmath143    the cross section for ai in the @xmath144 collision is displayed dotted because it is a special case , subject to additional uncertainty .",
    "this cross section is presented as an upper bound , as are all the black - sphere cross sections , but , unlike the other cases , the true cross section is expected to be _ considerably smaller_. in order for this reaction to occur at all in cold collisions , the hg@xmath145+hg@xmath145 asymptote must be above the minimum in the hg@xmath7 well .",
    "though not all previous work has agreed on the sufficiency of the binding energy of hg@xmath7 , the most reliable experimental and theoretical results now agree that this well depth is greater than the required 1.10 ev ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for discussion of this point ) .",
    "however , the single potential curve coming from the hg(@xmath146+hg@xmath145 asymptote does not cross the hg@xmath7 curve , so adiabatically ai still would not occur .",
    "the reason ai is nonetheless possible is that there is an avoided crossing of this curve with another curve of @xmath147 symmetry coming from the hg(@xmath9+hg@xmath148 asymptote .",
    "their diabatic crossing probability is @xmath149 , only weakly dependent on the collision energy as long as @xmath104 is small compared with the potential energy of 0.013 a.u .  at the crossing .",
    "an important point here is that the state corresponding to this potential curve has 93% quintet character and quintet states do not couple to the ionization continuum ( only singlet and triplet states can be formed by coupling hg@xmath7 to an electron , and the relevant coupling matrix element conserves spin ) .",
    "thus the autoionization width is reduced by a factor of @xmath150 .",
    "even if the black - body model is valid for the other reactions , it is much less likely to be valid with an autoionization width this small .",
    "the uncertainty of long - range barriers , which affected the results in ref .",

    "the most reliable values are 99 @xmath153 and 64 @xmath153 , with error bars of 25 @xmath153 , which come from two different analyses of the same experiment @xcite ( see footnote 5 of ref .",

    "the present thermally averaged value for temperature 300 k is 83 @xmath153 , in agreement with the most recent experiment .",
    "this agreement tends to validate the black - sphere model , which , in principle , provides an upper limit on the cross sections .",
    "another experimental value @xcite of @xmath154 @xmath153 has been published for the hg(@xmath146+hg@xmath145 reaction , but has been generally repudiated on experimental grounds @xcite and is inconsistent with the present upper limit on the cross section for this reaction .",
    "the cross section for ai in the hg@xmath145+hg@xmath145 deserves attention because of the proposed use of @xmath3 as an atomic clock state , even if the discussion is necessarily speculative .",
    "compared with the other reaction pairs , the `` strength '' of this reaction may be reduced by three factors : a factor of @xmath149 due to the required curve hopping , a factor of @xmath155 due to the non - ionizing quintet component , and a factor due to the time spent in the continuum being fairly short .",
