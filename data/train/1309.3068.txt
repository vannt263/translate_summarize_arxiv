    "quantum spin liquid ( qsl ) is one of the central issues in condensed matter physics .",
    "@xcite this is a new state of matter in insulating magnets , which shows no apparent symmetry breaking .",
    "experimental candidates for qsl were recently discovered in several quasi - two- and three - dimensional ( 3d ) compounds , which have been stimulating the study of qsl .",
    "@xcite in these compounds , the identification of qsl often relies on the lack of singularity in thermodynamic quantities , especially , the absence of magnetic long - range ordering down to the lowest temperature ( @xmath4 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "theoretically , in addition to a number of one - dimensional systems , several solvable models have been proposed and served as prototypes for qsl in higher dimensions .",
    "@xcite in addition , intensive numerical researches have also been done to explore qsl .",
    "@xcite    a fundamental question in the research of qsl is how to characterize qsl and distinguish it from a simple paramagnet .",
    "in general , liquid and gas have the same symmetry and they are not necessarily distinguished by a phase transition . in classical fluids , there is a first - order transition between liquid and gas , but the discontinuous phase boundary is terminated at a critical endpoint ; beyond that , liquid and gas are adiabatically connected with each other by a crossover .",
    "then , what is the case of a quantum fluid , qsl ? is the high-@xmath4 paramagnetic phase adiabatically connected to the low-@xmath4 qsl phase ?",
    "since there is no apparent symmetry breaking between these two phases as in the case of the classical liquid and gas , it is naively expected that qsl and paramagnet are adiabatically connected . on the other hand ,",
    "some qsl phases are characterized by a topological order related with the ground state degeneracy or finite topological entropy , while the paramagnetic phase is not .",
    "@xcite this implies the existence of some singularity related to the topological order , but it is not clear whether the singularity accompanies a conventional phase transition .",
    "the question is not only purely theoretical but also relevant to the interpretation of experimental results in the qsl candidates .",
    "the issue of the connection between qsl and paramagnetic state has been recently studied in the kitaev model and its generalizations .",
    "the advantage to adopt the models is the availability of exact solutions in the excited states as well as in the ground state .",
    "the original kitaev model defined on a two - dimensional ( 2d ) honeycomb lattice is exactly solvable by utilizing a local ising - type conserved quantity on each hexagon of the honeycomb lattice ,  @xcite and shows a qsl ground state with short - range spin correlation .",
    "@xcite meanwhile , when one type of three inequivalent bonds is much stronger than the other two , the model is mapped onto the toric code model : one of the prototypical models for qsl , where the existence of topological order was exactly proved .",
    "@xcite in the toric code limit , the effect of temperature was studied in both 2d and 3d ,  @xcite and in some cases , the topological order was shown to persist up to the critical temperature .",
    "it is highly desired to explore such expanding forefront for deeper understanding of qsl physics .    in this paper , we present convincing evidence of a finite-@xmath4 phase transition between qsl and paramagnet in a 3d variant of the kitaev model . this 3d kitaev model , which was originally introduced in ref .  , is defined on a 3d hyperhoneycomb lattice , and inherits the solvability of the 2d honeycomb counterpart in the ground state .",
    "the ground - state phase diagram has the same structure as that in 2d ; the model provides an example of 3d qsl .",
    "however , the limit of one stronger bond than the other two leads to a distinct model from the 2d toric code model ; the excitations are allowed only in the form of peculiar closed loops because of the local constraints on the ising - type variables , which makes the thermodynamics nontrivial . performing the numerically exact analysis by monte carlo ( mc ) simulation ,",
    "we show that , although the model is apparently noninteracting , it exhibits a phase transition at a finite critical temperature @xmath0 between qsl and paramagnetic phases because of the local constraints .",
    "we find that @xmath4 dependence of the internal energy largely deviates from the noninteracting one and that the specific heat exhibits a divergent singularity at @xmath0 .",
    "a large amount of entropy is released in the high-@xmath4 paramagnetic phase .",
    "we successfully calculate the magnetic susceptibility in terms of the original quantum spins .",
    "we show that the susceptibility obeys the curie law at high @xmath4 , while it exhibits a broad hump above @xmath0 .",
    "although the susceptibility decreases continuously at @xmath0 , its @xmath4 derivative shows divergent singularity .",
    "a nonzero van vleck - type contribution appears below @xmath0 .",
    "we also calculate the dynamical spin correlation function at finite @xmath4 .",
    "it is momentum independent due to the extremely short - range spin correlation , but shows quantized peaks as a function of excitation energy .",
    "the peak at the highest energy rapidly increases near @xmath0 as @xmath4 decreases , while other peaks are suppressed .",
    "the phase transition is hard to characterize in terms of the local variables , as it apparently accompanies no symmetry breaking .",
    "we characterize it by the emergence of extended loops of flipped ising - type variables .",
    "we define the flux for each loop and successfully identify the transition from the paramagnetic side in terms of the flux density .",
    "we find that the transition is characterized by the emergence of flux in the high-@xmath4 paramagnetic state which has a coulombic nature due to the local constraints .",
    "we also show that the finite - size scaling of the flux density suggests the critical exponents consistent with the 3d ising universality class .",
    "meanwhile , in addition to the local constraints , there are global constraints on the ising - type variables .",
    "we show that the global constraints are not relevant to the thermodynamics and the model omitting them also shows the same phase transition .",
    "the transition belongs to the 3d ising universality class because the effective model without the global constraints corresponds to an ising model on a diamond lattice .",
    "although this phase transition is continuous , we find that the parameter which describes the topology of loops is expected to show a discontinuous jump at @xmath0 in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "moreover , we analytically show that this parameter is given by a step function in a 2d loop model .",

    "<S> , we find a phase transition from quantum spin liquid to paramagnet at a finite critical temperature @xmath0 accompanied with divergent singularity of the specific heat . </S>",
    "<S> we also compute the magnetic properties in terms of the original quantum spins . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the magnetic susceptibility exhibits a broad hump above @xmath0 , while it obeys the curie law at high temperature and approaches a nonzero van vleck - type constant at low temperature . </S>",
    "<S> although the susceptibility changes continuously at @xmath0 , its temperature derivative shows critical divergence at @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> we also clarify that the dynamical spin correlation function is momentum independent but shows quantized peaks corresponding to the discretized excitations . </S>",
    "<S> although the phase transition accompanies no apparent symmetry breaking in terms of the ising - type variables as well as the original quantum spins , we characterize it from a topological viewpoint . </S>",
    "<S> we find that , by defining the flux density for loops of the ising - type variables , the transition is interpreted as the one occurring from the zero - flux quantum spin liquid to the nonzero - flux paramagnet ; the latter has a coulombic nature due to the local constraints . </S>",
    "<S> the role of global constraints on the ising - type variables is examined in comparison with the results in the two - dimensional loop model . </S>",
    "<S> a correspondence of our model to the ising model on a diamond lattice is also discussed . a possible relevance of our results to the recently - discovered hyperhoneycomb compound , @xmath1-li@xmath2iro@xmath3 , </S>",
    "<S> is mentioned . </S>"
