    "nature frequently exhibits regularly spaced channels that are formed by fluvial erosion .",
    "figure  [ firstexample ] shows one such example with approximately regularly spaced drainage outlets .",
    "the spacing in naturally occurring examples varies from tens of centimeters to tens of kilometers , spanning five orders of magnitude .",
    "some examples are more nearly periodic than others , but in either case there is a typical length - scale for the lateral separation of streams .",
    "this length - scale is of interest not only because it determines the shape of landforms around us , but also because it sets one of the scales of variation in the heterogeneities of sedimentary deposits @xcite .    ,",
    "width=340 ]    the ubiquity of this phenomenon further motivates its study .",
    "periodically spaced drainage outlets are observed in various climates and geologic settings , such as mountain belts @xcite , fault blocks @xcite , submarine canyons @xcite , valleys of volcanic islands @xcite , sapping canyons @xcite , and martian gullies @xcite .",
    "the ubiquity of the periodicity implies a common phenomenon but not a common cause .",
    "indeed , as we now proceed to review , theoretical formulations of erosion initiated by seepage and overland flow indicate that characteristic spacings are expected , but not necessarily for the same reasons .",
    "it is unclear whether the various forms of periodic channel spacing are due to a few basically similar mechanisms or if there are many essentially different explanations .",
    "there are many conceivable explanations for the periodicity .",
    "we approach this rich phenomenology by a detailed study of one specific example that is particularly accessible to study .",

    "when a subsurface flow erodes a porous material as it emerges from the material , the process is called seepage erosion ( or sapping ) .",

    "it was shown that under certain circumstances the eroding surface is unstable to sinusoidal channel - like patterns .",
    "however they found that the most unstable wavenumber was infinite , implying that the most unstable wavelength is at the microscopic granular scale . noting this deficiency",
    ", @xcite provided an alternative theory based on two components : a threshold condition for erosion and analysis of the full equations for shallow overland flow .",
    "the inclusion of the threshold condition yields an instability at a finite wavelength , a finite distance from the divide .",
    "this result shows that periodic channelization can occur entirely as a consequence of its own dynamics . under different circumstances ,",
    "a finite wavelength can even emerge without any threshold condition @xcite .",
    "the theory of seepage erosion is less well developed .",
    "as stated by @xcite , `` there have been no formal quantitative studies of the relation between the hydrogeologic properties [ of material undergoing seepage erosion ] and the average spacing of channels . ''",
    "@xcite , however , provides a physically appealing description .",
    "the pressure head in a horizontal or tilted plane leads to high pressure gradients at places of high local curvature , and hence presumably to enhanced erosion .",
    "this instability leads to the growth of channels .",
    "a similar but more complex situation is depicted in figure  [ cartoons]b , where a channel on an inclined slope is eroded below the point where the water table intersects the surface . once a channel forms , internal flow lines are focused toward it . as we show below",
    ", the focusing occurs over a large but finite transverse extent , which is presumably related to a characteristic channel spacing , the presence of which requires no heterogeneities in material properties .",
    "documented experimental studies go back at least a century @xcite . in the 1980 s , seepage experiments @xcite",
    "were frequently concerned with analogy to martian valleys .",
    "the question of whether ancient martian channels are created by seepage or vast amounts of surface water remains open today @xcite .",
    "our own experiments are motivated by terrestrial analogs .",
    "previous experimental work suggests that groundwater piracy plays a dominant role in the development of channels .",
    "@xcite studied the rate of seepage erosion in a narrow two - dimensional flow tank . @xcite",
    "has carried out computer simulation modeling of valley development by groundwater sapping .",
    "the present study is a first report of our effort to conduct field studies , experiments , and theory simultaneously to address the formation of channels , and rhythmic channelization in particular , by fluvial erosion when substantial groundwater flow is present .",
    "the following three sections cover , respectively , field study , experiment , and theory .",
    "the last section contains conclusions that we are able to draw so far .",
    "beach rills @xcite can serve as inspiration for larger - scale drainage channels forming over geologic time periods @xcite . while incised channels are not uncommon on sand beaches , periodic channelization is rarer .",
    "two suitable sites where small incised channels form when the tide recedes are located on cape cod .",
    "one is at provincetown , massachusetts , a few minutes walk north of the main pier , the other at mayo beach in wellfleet , massachusetts . at high tide",
    "the sand is soaked with water , which seeps out as the water recedes .",
    "the tidal difference at both locations is typically 3 meters .",
    "all channels are erased when the tide rises again and they reform at different locations during the next tidal retreat .",
    "one can observe the generation of the channels on a daily basis .",
    "the channels found on the beach are sharply incised ( figure  [ beachrills ] ) .",
    "they have steep side walls so that their cross section becomes almost rectangular and they are about one centimeter wide .",
    "the sand grains are fairly distributed in size , around a mean of about 1 mm . at the provincetown site ,",
    "the average channel spacing , based on over 200 measurements , is about 40 cm .",
    "the spacing is measured near the head of the rills .",
    "depending on the height of the tide , we observe 1 - 5 generations ( bands ) of channels , with typical lengths of 0.7 - 2 m .",
    "many channels begin at pebbles , others start without visible perturbation .",
    "further downhill , channels often merge and braid .",
    "the beach slope is 10 - 12% , terminated by a 1% slope that emerges only at low tide . at the wellfleet site ,",
    "the spacing is about 1 m , based on 38 channels , and the slope is 4% , also terminated by a lower slope .",
    "there are no pebbles at this site .",
    "we have observed channels several times during their initiation and growth at the provincetown site .",
    "a vertical test hole allows us to monitor the ground water level as a function of time .",
    "the water table inside the beach sinks 1 cm every 3  minutes during the hours before channel initiation . during the same time ,",
    "the sea level sinks about three times as fast .",
    "hence , the height difference between water table and sea level increases steadily until , about three hours after high tide , the pressure head suffices to form channels .",
    "the channels clearly form outside the water and are not directly related to the waves that hit the beach .",
    "waves arrive occasionally and wash water up the beach , subsequently leading to a sheet of water flowing downhill .",
    "pebbles interfere with this flow and temporarily cause cone - like flow patterns .",
    "these disturbances in the flow can lead to an incised streak downhill of the pebble which eventually grows into a channel .",
    "the initial incision happens within seconds or less and leaves a streak on the order of 10 cm long .",
    "not all channels are initiated this way .",
    "another frequent initiation mechanism results from `` fingers '' of runoff water from any sources higher up ( water ponding behind stones or from higher - lying , previous channels ) .",
    "areas without surface defects sometimes do not develop any channels . at other locations",
    "even tiny perturbations suffice for initiation and empty areas are `` filled in '' with channels . as far as one can see on the surface , the periodicity is established promptly ( within a minute or so ) .",
    "once a channel has initiated it grows downhill .",
    "sand is washed away at the lower end of the channel by water running in the channel . at the downward end of the channel , where the longitudinal extension occurs",
    ", the water appears to be fully loaded with sediment .",
    "there is mass wasting on the sides so that the channels widen slowly ; they also deepen slowly .",
    "sand grains are transported by the water flowing in the channel .",
    "the rills grow to their final size within minutes to tens of minutes .",
    "figure  [ choff ] shows a channel filled with water .",
    "the channel could be fed either by surface water that seeped out above the channel , or directly from groundwater provided from the bottom and sides of the channel .",
    "we found that they are directly fed by groundwater , for the following reasons .",
    "the film of water above the channel shows no movement visible to the eye .",
    "small grains , placed by us on the surface , diffuse only slowly at speeds that are insufficient to provide the large amounts of water seen inside the channels .",
    "the channels carry water for quite some time after the initiation and long channels continue to be filled with water when the surface at its head is already dry .",
    "all this shows that the channels are fed directly by groundwater .",
    ", width=226 ]    the beach rills provide a natural example of rhythmic channelization and the observations suggest that they require seepage for their explanation .",
    "prior experimental studies of seepage erosion @xcite have observed a few periodic channels . our own experimental setup is shown in figure  [ exp - setup ] .",
    "the plexiglass box is 120 cm wide and effectively 90 cm long .",
    "it is filled with 0.5 mm glass beads .",
    "water is pooled in the back and kept at a constant level using an overflow tube .",
    "the water seeps through the granular medium and creates channels on the slope , observed by a ccd camera .",
    "sideways illumination makes the channels clearly visible in the image .",
    "the experiments are carried out with a steady water reservoir , unlike the beach where the water table is receding .",
    "a ledge protrudes at the bottom to increase the flux through the system .",
    "a minimum flux is required to dislodge a grain on an inclined surface which is below its angle of repose .",
    "the ledge makes it possible to achieve the threshold in a finite sized experimental apparatus , by allowing us to increase the height of the water column in the reservoir above the height of the granular bed .",
    "the resulting flux is also similar to that observed at the beach when channels are formed .",
    "thus the ledge allows us to reproduce the processes observed on the beach in a finite sized experimental system .",
    "we did not observe any channels without the ledge .    the capillary height in the medium is measured to be 25 mm .",

    "these images are taken less than half an hour into the experiment .",
    "figure  [ expchannel]c shows about 10 drainage channels .",
    "figure  [ expchannel]d corresponds to a slump observed at high slopes . in this paper",
    ", we only report on patterns of fairly straight channels .",
    "other erosion patterns , some of which are found by @xcite in a different experimental setup , are observed in various parameter regions .    [ cols= \" < , < \" , ]     channels such as those in figure  [ expchannel]a - c are observed within a limited range of slopes and water column heights .",
    "figure  [ phase ] summarizes the parameter regions for which experiments were carried out . in our early experiments , parameters were not accurately controlled , but figure  [ phase ] corresponds to a later set of experiments conducted with a constant experimental setup .",
    "channel formation is observed for slopes @xmath617% .",
    "this slope is much less than the angle of repose of completely dry or saturated glass beads which is approximately 43% .",
    "for the particular level of box filling , channels are not observed below a water column height of 12 cm .     and water column height @xmath5 .",
    "filled circles ( @xmath7 ) correspond to spontaneous channelization .",
    "high slopes lead to slumping of the material ( @xmath8 ) . no channels ( @xmath9 ) form at low pressures and slopes.,width=302 ]    the mere observation of regularly spaced channels in the experiment immediately constrains possible explanations .",
    "the medium is composed of mono - disperse , cohesionless glass beads .",
    "the fluid is clean water .",
    "this is all that is required to create periodic channels .",
    "reproducing channelization in a clean and controlled environment is a major step in studying the phenomenon and provides the basis for theoretical modeling .",
    "figure  [ expchannels ] shows a time sequence of six images of the same experimental run .",
    "the channels are initiated after a sheet of water flows down the surface .",
    "the sheet disappears and the channels deepen , widen , and grow lengthward .",
    "this is similar to the beach rills , where channels are also initiated by surface water , then grow downhill by washing away sand at the lower end of the channel . unlike the beach , the experimental channels , in addition to growing downward , also grow headwards until they stop at the point where the ledge ends .",
    "channels grow initially ( quickly ) downwards and then slowly upwards ( headward ) . after the channels",
    "have reached their maximum length they still widen and occasionally meander and fan at the lower end .",
    "the spacing of initial channels , figure  [ expchannels]c , is also apparently not random .",
    "it may result from an instability in the initial sheet flow ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) or from the interaction of the sheet flow with the eroding surface .",
    "any threshold for incision is likely related to the sheet flow , rather than to the force exerted on the grains by water emerging directly from underground .",
    ".,width=377 ]    figures [ expchannels ] and [ coars ] show spatial coarsening over the period of channel development .",
    "only some of the initial channels grow into larger channels , while others cease their growth .",
    "for example , in figure  [ expchannels]f there are several smaller channels visible that have stopped growing .",
    "this is especially the case when another channel is nearby .",
    "growing channels tap into the groundwater supply of their neighbors , which then cease to grow due to the lack of groundwater . on the other hand",
    ", new channels still form after the initial incisions , especially when far from existing channels .",
    "figure  [ expchannels]d shows two examples . both of these processes ",
    "the competition of nearby channels and the formation of new channels away from existing ones  eventually lead to a more regular spacing .    in experiment ( a ) of figure  [ coars ]",
    "there are 11 initial channels , of which 5 eventually cease to grow .",
    "the other 6 initial channels grow into major final channels along with 2 channels that formed at a later stage . in experiment ( b )",
    "there are 11 initial channels , of which 3 cease to grow and two additional channels form at a later time .",
    "these numbers indicate that many of the big final channels have grown directly from small initial channels",
    ". however , the selection of which channels dry up and where new channels form is influenced by the distance to neighboring channels , so that the spacing is dynamically created or at least dynamically grown from the initial state .",
    "channel locations have more of an imprint of the initial state than does the spacing between them . incision behavior _ and _ groundwater piracy contribute to the final state . with more separation in time and space between initial and final configuration one would expect an even larger spacing , which has little to do with the initial state .",
    "as a result of the observations on the beach and in the experiment , the problem can be formulated theoretically in terms of flow through a porous medium . after channel initiation ,",
    "the supply of water to the channel is governed by groundwater flow .",
    "the erosion at the channel boundaries , especially at the lower end of the channel , is governed by the amount of groundwater collected in the channel .",
    "our aim is to determine the extent of the groundwater piracy which limits the growth of channels .",
    "the presence of long tubular structures in the soil , or `` macropores , '' could significantly influence the flux of water through the medium .",
    "we have not observed any such pores .",
    "the material is cohesionless and cohesionless grains can not sustain voids and therefore macropores are not expected . according to the observational and theoretical evidence",
    ", we discard this possibility ( no gophers ) .",
    "local density variations may be possible .    in a porous medium ,",
    "the velocity is given by darcy s law @xcite @xmath10 where @xmath3 is the seepage constant , @xmath11 is the pressure , @xmath12 the density , @xmath13 earth s acceleration constant , and @xmath14 the unit vector in the direction of gravity .",

    "the bottom of the tank is impermeable , the water column in the back is represented by a linearly varying pressure , and atmospheric pressure is applied at the seepage surface . at the water table there is atmospheric pressure , @xmath20 , and the velocity is tangential .",
    "the shape of this free surface adjusts such that both boundary conditions are satisfied simultaneously .",
    "the pressure distribution and the shape of the free surface are independent of the parameter @xmath3 , since neither the laplace equation ( [ eq : laplace ] ) nor the boundary conditions depend on @xmath3 .",
    "the shape of the water table is also independent of @xmath13 , since the boundary conditions and the laplace equation can be written in terms of @xmath21 .",
    "( the limit @xmath22 poses no physical problem , since for @xmath23 every shape is permissible . )",
    "while velocities depend on @xmath3 and @xmath13 , the water table is purely determined by the geometry of the boundaries .",
    "this is also obeyed by the known exact solutions for unconfined flow ( * ? ? ?",

    "evaporation should be negligible over the time period the channels form .",
    "on the beach and in the experiment the capillary height exceeds the depth of the channels , and hence the capillary forces may prevent the detachment of the water table from the surface .",
    "however , the capillary effect vanishes for larger scale landscapes . further consideration of the potential role of capillary forces will be necessary before detailed quantitative comparisons with experiments are made .",
    "we expect however , that our qualitative conclusions will be independent of these issues , because ground water piracy takes place in either case .",
    "@xcite provides a comprehensive collection of analytic solutions to problems of groundwater movement , but most geometries need to be solved numerically .",
    "we solve the laplace equation numerically with a conventional relaxation method on a regular grid .",
    "the scheme uses the pressure at the six neighboring grid points and iterates until the pressure field has converged . at the free boundary ,",
    "cells are no longer treated as rectangular , but in the three - dimensional finite difference approximation of the laplace operator , the exact location of boundary point(s ) is taken into account . at the free boundary , atmospheric pressure is imposed and the free surface is moved until it is stationary , using a simple first - order time integration .",
    "the time - advanced grid points representing the free surface no longer lie on a regularly spaced grid and are interpolated back onto a rectangular grid at each integration step . in three dimensions ,",
    "when the free surface is two - dimensional , the interpolation fits a plane through three nearby points .",
    "the three points are chosen such that without variations along the @xmath26-axis , one exactly recovers a one - dimensional , linear interpolation scheme . hence , three - dimensional simulations without variation along the @xmath26-direction yield exactly the same results as two - dimensional simulations .",
    "the numerics are tested by comparison with the analytic solution of the vertical dam ( * ? ? ?",

    "* eq . vii.12.12 ) .",
    "figure  [ beach ] shows the velocity field in a geometry similar to the beach ( without channels ) .",
    "as the height of the water table decreases along the horizontal direction , the velocity increases as a result of the incompressibility of the flow .",
    "there are approximate solutions for a wedge without tailwater @xcite .",
    "if the slope @xmath27 is small and the wedge is long , then the height @xmath24 at which the water table intersects the surface ( see figure  [ bc ] ) is approximately @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the flux per unit width and @xmath3 the seepage constant . the average horizontal velocity at the point where the water table intersects the surface is @xmath30 , hence @xmath31 the velocity increases with slope , because @xmath24 decreases with slope . since the velocity changes little along the vertical ( see figure  [ beach ] )",
    ", the average velocity @xmath32 is a good approximation to the velocity at the intersection , @xmath33 .",
    "hence , the velocity with which water emerges at the seepage face is higher for higher slopes .",
    "our numerical simulations show that for slopes of 10% or smaller the presence of tailwater does not change the velocity @xmath25 significantly .",
    "so far we have only considered seepage without channels .",
    "channels can be represented in the simulation by applying the atmospheric boundary condition at a properly shaped surface .",

    "the wentworth instability predicts that channels keep on growing and competing , until the externally given maximum length is reached . in a natural setting the maximum length may be determined by the length over which erosion occurs .",
    "the scale - separation in the experiment may not be large enough to distinguish whether spacing is proportional to channel width or channel length .",
    "however , in both theory and experiment competition for ground water controls channel development .",
    "the coarsening mechanism is qualitatively the same .    in summary , coarsening of the lateral inter - channel spacing",
    "is predicted by theoretical considerations .",
    "channels compete for groundwater , which slows and eventually stops the growth of some of them .",
    "the length - scale characterizing the distance between major channels increases with time , until the channels have reached their maximum length .",
    "eventually the lateral spacing should be only confined by the externally constrained maximum length .",
    "the lessons we have learned are about the role of runoff and seepage during channel formation , the generic nature of rhythmic channelization , and the importance of the water table s free surface .",
    "we observe the formation of drainage outlet channels in permeable ground , on the beach as well as in laboratory experiments . in both cases , initial channels",
    "are quickly incised by surface flow . even in a very permeable medium ,",
    "small amounts of surface runoff are more efficient in starting channels than is the emerging groundwater . following the incision ,",
    "groundwater from the vicinity seeps into the channel and flows inside the channel , enlarging it , mainly lengthwise , through erosion .",
    "an initial lateral separation may be related to the initial sheet flow .",
    "coarsening of the lateral inter - channel spacing is discernible in the experiment . for narrowly spaced channels",
    ", one channel often slows and eventually stops its growth , presumably due to piracy of groundwater by a nearby channel .",
    "a second process taking place is the belated formation of new channels far away from existing ones .",
    "rhythmic channel patterns arise as water seeps through a mono - disperse permeable material and erodes material as it emerges and pours down the channel .",
    "these observations lead us to a theoretical description in terms of flow of ground water in a homogeneous porous medium with a free water table .",
    "according to this theory , the response width of the water table is much wider than the channel is wide or deep and approximately proportional to the channel length .",
    "this underscores wentworth s insight that this an efficient ( and therefore the dominant ) instability mechanism , because it is prompt and far - reaching .",
    "the groundwater flow pattern , for a given channel geometry , is independent of material properties .",
    "we are indebted to many who have facilitated this research through discussion , logistics , or help with field work , experiment , and numerical simulation .",
