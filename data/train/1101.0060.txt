    "wave propagation in random media has been extensively studied for many years from both theoretical and applied points of view . in particular , the study of the effective shape of an acoustic pulse propagating through a layered medium has attracted a lot of attention @xcite .",
    "recently , applications to time reversal @xcite have also been the subject of much interest . currently , there is also a strong interest in problems related to noise and correlations @xcite . in all these situations the statistical properties of the medium are important since they affect the statistical properties of the wave field .",
    "in @xcite the authors consider an acoustic pulse propagating in aone - dimensional random medium with rapidly decaying correlations .",
    "they rigorously prove the classical result of odoherty and anstey @xcite which establishes that the effective transmitted pulse is characterised by deterministic spreading and a random time - shift .",
    "more precisely , the deterministic spreading is expressed as a convolution with a gaussian density , and the random time - shift is described in terms of a brownian motion .",
    "more recently , wave propagation and also homogenization in random media with long - range correlations and/or defined in terms of fractional brownian motion @xcite have been considered . in @xcite , we extend the result of @xcite to such a framework .",
    "then , the asymptotic description of the transmitted pulse is dramatically different from what happens in a mixing case .",
    "indeed , the pulse keeps its initial shape , and its random time - shift is now described in terms of a fractional brownian motion whose hurst index depends on the decay rate of the correlation function of the random fluctuations .",
    "we considered in @xcite a particular form of a random process describing the medium , such that it was roughly speaking close to a gaussian process .",
    "thus , it still remains to study more general cases under the long - range assumption .",
    "this is the aim of the present work .",
    "we establish that under general long - range assumptions on the medium , the effective pulse still keeps its initial shape as observed in @xcite , but the time - shift can be very different , non - gaussian , for instance , depending on the form of the random fluctuations .",
    "moreover , our general result allows us to deal with media with a decay rate of correlations that varies along the propagation direction .",
    "this leads to an effective time - shift , described in terms of a multifractional random process which is , roughly speaking , a fractional brownian motion with a varying hurst index that reflects the nonhomogeneity of the propagation medium .    in section [ sec1 ]",
    "we introduce the problem and review the basic wave decomposition approach .",
    "next , we establish the general technical result ( theorem [ main ] ) in section  [ sec2 ] .",
    "we apply this general result to non - gaussian media in section [ nongaussian ] , to multifractal gaussian media in section [ multifractal ] and to multifractal non - gaussian media in section [ nongm ] where we prove the main result of the paper ( theorem [ main4 ] ) .",
    "we present a numerical illustration in section [ secnum ] .",
    "finally , section [ secmain ] is devoted to the derivation of theorem  [ main ] .",
    "the governing equations are the nondimensionalized euler equations giving conservation of moments and mass @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the time , @xmath2 is the depth into the medium , @xmath3 is the pressure and @xmath4 the particle velocity .",
    "the medium parameters are the density @xmath5 and the bulk - modulus @xmath6 ( reciprocal of the compressibility ) .",
    "we assume that @xmath7 is a constant identically equal to one in our nondimensionalized setting , and @xmath8 is modeled as follows : @xmath9,$\\vspace*{2pt}\\cr 1 & \\quad $ \\mbox{for } z\\in\\re- [ 0,z],$}\\ ] ] where @xmath10 is a centered random process .",
    "the number @xmath11 is a parameter that all quantities depend on .",
    "as we will see below it is introduced to describe the scales of the problem .",
    "we introduce the right- and left - going waves @xmath12 the boundary conditions are of the form @xmath13 for a positive real number @xmath14 and a source function @xmath15 . in order to deduce a description of the transmitted pulse , we open a window of size @xmath16 in the neighborhood of the travel time of the homogenized medium and define the processes @xmath17 observe that the background or homogenized medium in our scaling has a constant speed of sound equal to unity and that the medium is matched so that in the frame introduced in ( [ decomp ] ) the pulse shape is constant if @xmath18 or if we consider the homogenized medium @xcite .",
    "we introduce next the fourier transforms @xmath19 and @xmath20 of @xmath21 and @xmath22 , respectively , @xmath23 that satisfy @xmath24 where we use the notation @xmath25 following @xcite we express the previous system of equations in terms of the propagator @xmath26 which can be written as @xmath27 and that satisfies @xmath28 with @xmath29 defining next the transmission coefficient @xmath30 and the reflection coefficient @xmath31 by @xmath32 we can write @xmath33 and @xmath34 hence , we shall study the asymptotics of the propagator @xmath35 in order to characterize  @xmath21 and @xmath22 as @xmath36 goes to 0 .",
    "we recall now what happens in a mixing ( or short - range ) model when @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "we assume that @xmath39 where @xmath40 is a bounded function and @xmath41 is a centered markov process with an invariant probability measure whose generator satisfies the fredholm alternative .",
