    "over the years various observational surveys such as the automatic plate measuring ( apm ) galaxy survey @xcite , sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) @xcite , etc . were carried out for studying galaxies and clusters .",
    "these observations demonstrated that almost all the active galactic nuclei or black hole candidates are surrounded by the gas clouds together with associated accretion disks .",
    "the sizes of these accretion disks vary from @xmath0 to several hundreds parsecs @xcite . the most powerful evidence for super massive black holes existence appeares from the very long baseline interferometry ( vlbi ) .",
    "it is imaging molecular h@xmath1o masers in the active galaxy ngc 4258 @xcite .",
    "this imaging was produced by doppler shift measurements assuming keplerian motion of the masering source .",
    "these results allowed a quite accurate estimation of the central mass : a @xmath2 super massive dark object within @xmath3 parsecs .",
    "hence the important astrophysical information can be obtained from the observation of gas streams motion in the gravitational field of compact objects .",
    "various independent high - precision observational data sets confirm ( with startling evidence ) that the universe is undergoing a phase of accelerated expansion @xcite .",
    "several ideas ranging from dark energy models to extended theories of gravity ( etgs ) @xcite were proposed to explain this phenomenon . specifically etgs",
    "assume that at large scales gr breaks down and the gravitational field is described by a more generic action .",
    "first consequences of the attempts to solve the hierarchy problem were the particle physics modifications around the tev scale .",
    "therefore the form of gravitational interactions at distances shorter than a millimeter @xcite is allowed to be more complicated than usual newtonian one .",
    "in particular such modification could be achieved by introducing of the extra dimensions . in older developments of string theory",
    "they were compact @xcite .",
    "randall and sundrum presented a new static classical 5d solution of einstein equations and showed that extra dimensions do not necessary need to be compact .",
    "two possible applications of this solution were proposed @xcite . in the first case ( which we refer to as rsi ) there are two branes with non - vanishing tensions placed at the orbifold fixed points @xcite .",
    "our universe lives on the brane with negative tension ( `` the visible brane '' ) .",
    "all the matter describing by three fundamental interactions ( strong , weak and electro - magnetic ) is localized on this brane",
    ". however gravity is able to propagate , in addition , along the 5th dimension into the bulk .",
    "the exponential warp factor appearing in the rsi model leads to a new natural solution of the hierarchy problem @xcite . in the second ( rsii ) proposal",
    "@xcite the visible brane has the positive tension while the second brane is moved to the infinity .",
    "such topology provides an exciting example of a non - compact extra direction , which nevertheless correctly reproduces newton s law on the visible brane .",
    "however the hierarchy problem is not completely solved in this particular case .",
    "rsii model needs an appropriately tuned value of the tension on the brane .",
    "such delicate adjustment is equivalent to the cosmological constant problem . the brane tension and bulk cosmological constant define the shape of the bound state graviton mode .",
    "in addition to the bound state one , there is a continuum of the kaluza - klein modes .",
    "these states have weak coupling to low - energy states on the brane , but are essential for the consistency of the full theory of gravity and would couple strongly to planck - energy brane processes @xcite .",
    "the mass accretion on rotating black holes in stationary axisymmetric spacetimes in the frames of gr was studied in details long ago @xcite . the radiation emitted by the accretion disk surface",
    "is studied under the assumption of thermodynamical equilibrium of the disk .",
    "that is why black body radiation is a good approximation in this case @xcite .",
    "so there is a possibility to test the rs model using astrophysical observations of the emission spectra from accretion disks .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to study the properties of a thin accretion disk around an rsii black hole and carry out an analysis of the radiation emerging from the surface of the disk .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ s : disk ] we review the formalism and the physical properties of the thin disk accretion onto compact objects for stationary axisymmetric spacetimes . in sec .",
    "[ s : rsbhs ] we analyze the basic properties of matter forming a thin accretion disk around large black holes in the rsii model .",
    "we discuss and conclude our results in sec .",
    "[ s : concl ] .",
    "throughout this work we use a system of units so that @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is boltzmann s constants .",
    "the description of accretion process onto black holes was developed in details by bardeen and press @xcite , novikov and thorne @xcite , shakura and sunyaev @xcite , page and thorne @xcite .",
    "the particles constituting the accretion disk are assumed to move in circular orbits in the frames of gr .",
    "the physical properties and the electromagnetic radiation characteristics of these particles are determined by the geometry of the spacetime around the compact object . for a stationary and axially symmetric geometry",
    "the metric is given in a general form as @xmath6 in the present work we consider a thin disk accretion , therefore the equatorial approximation is used .",
    "the metric components @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 depend on the radial coordinate @xmath12 only , and @xmath13 .    to compute the relevant physical quantities of thin accretion disks we determine the radial dependence of the specific angular velocity @xmath14 , the specific energy @xmath15 and the specific angular momentum @xmath16 of particles @xcite : @xmath17 the marginally stable orbit around the central object is given by @xmath18 where @xmath19 ( appearing as a cofactor in the metric determinant ) never vanishes . inserting into and solving the obtained equation for @xmath12",
    ", we find the radii of the marginally stable orbits , once the metric coefficients @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath11 are explicitly given .",
    "for a thin accretion disk its vertical size is assumed negligible compared to its horizontal extension .",
    "so the disk height @xmath20 , defined by the maximum of half disk thickness , is always much smaller than the characteristic radius @xmath12 of the disk , @xmath21 .",
    "the thin disk has an inner edge at the marginally stable orbit of the compact object potential , and the accreting plasma has a keplerian motion in higher orbits .    in steady - state accretion disk models the mass accretion rate @xmath22",
    "is assumed to be a constant in time .",
    "this quantity measures the rate at which the rest mass of the particles flow inward through the disk .",
    "the radiation flux @xmath23 emitted by the surface of the accretion disk can be derived from the conservation equations for the mass , energy and angular momentum respectively .",
    "then the radiant energy @xmath24 over the disk is expressed in terms of the specific energy , angular momentum and the angular velocity of the particles orbiting in the disk @xcite : @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the marginally stable orbit obtained from .",
    "the other characteristic of the accretion process is conversion efficiency .",
    "this value indicates how fast the central object converts the rest mass into the outgoing radiation .",
    "the efficiency is defined as the ratio of the rate of the radiation energy of photons , escaping from the disk surface to infinity , and the rate at which mass - energy is transported to the central compact object .",
    "both values are measured at the infinity @xcite .",
    "if all the emitted photons can escape to infinity , the efficiency is given in terms of the specific energy measured at the marginally stable orbit @xmath26 : @xmath27 for schwarzschild black holes the efficiency @xmath28 is about @xmath29 , whether the photon capture by the black hole is considered or not .",
    "the accreting matter in the steady - state thin disk is supposed to be in thermodynamical equilibrium .",
    "therefore the radiation emitted by a disk surface could be considered as a perfect black body radiation . thus the energy flux is given by @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the stefan - boltzmann constant .",
    "the observed luminosity @xmath32 has a redshifted black body spectrum @xcite : @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the distance to the source , @xmath35 is the thermal energy flux radiated by the disk ( planck distribution function ) , @xmath36 is the disk inclination angle , @xmath37 and @xmath38 indicate the position of the inner and outer edge of the disk respectively .",
    "following the work @xcite , we expect the flux over the disk surface to vanish at @xmath39 for any kind of general relativistic compact object geometry",
    ". therefore we take @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "the emitted frequency is given by @xmath42 , and the transfer function ( redshift factor ) can be written as @xcite @xmath43 where the light bending is neglected @xcite .    in the next sections we will calculate the energy flux , temperature and luminosity of the accretion disk around schwarzschild and rsii black holes .",
    "we adopt the following values for the two fundamental mass classes : @xmath44 , @xmath45 , which are the best estimates available for the well - known stellar - mass black hole cygnus - x1 @xcite , and @xmath46 , @xmath47 for the galactic centre black hole candidate sgr a * @xcite .",
    "several black hole solutions in rs model were presented in @xcite . however for a long time it was argued that stable static black hole solutions were applicable for rsii .",
    "some obtained solutions had a horizon radius not greater than the ads length @xmath48 @xcite .",
    "some authors @xcite proposed that stable rsii black holes could not exist at all .",
    "obviously , such an argument serves an extremely strong evidence against the viability of the rsii model .",
    "nevertheless new solutions for large stable black holes were found recently @xcite .",
    "the one obtained by abdolrahimi , catton , page and yaghoobpour - tari ( acpy solution ) @xcite is especially interesting .",
    "it represents a spherically symmetric static and asymptotically schwarzschild black hole solution .",
    "acpy solution was found using an explicit approximate metric for the black holes on the brane .",
    "abdolrahimi et al .",
    "have constructed an infinite mass axisymmetric 5d black hole solution of the bulk einstein equation . this black hole solution with infinite mass",
    "was used to find the metric of a large randall - sundrum ii black hole on the brane @xcite .",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite for details and present the final metric given by @xmath49 \\times \\\\      & \\times \\left ( 1 - \\cfrac{2m}{r } \\right)^{-1 } \\ ! \\ ! \\ ! \\ ! \\ ! \\",

    "now we compare the accretion properties of the acpy solution with the standard schwarzschild metric case .",

    "the main difference is the location of the marginally stable orbits ( fig .",

    "similar features can be found while plotting the temperature profiles of the disk ( fig .",
