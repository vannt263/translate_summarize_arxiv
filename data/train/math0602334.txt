    "in this paper we consider the system of @xmath0 elliptic equations @xmath1 for @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is a smooth , connected , bounded domain . systems of this form model the steady states of @xmath4 organisms which coexist in the area @xmath5 .",
    "the function @xmath6 represents the population density of the @xmath7-th species ( hence only @xmath8 are considered ) and @xmath9 describes the internal dynamic of @xmath6 .",
    "the coupling between different equations is the classical lotka - volterra interaction term : the positive constant @xmath10 prescribes the competitive character of the relationship between @xmath6 and @xmath11 and its largeness measure the strength of the competition .",
    "systems of this form have attracted considerable attention both in ecology and social science since they furnish a relatively simple model to study phenomena of extinction , coexistence and segregation states of populations .",
    "several theoretical studies have been carried out in this direction , mainly in the case of two competing species and for the logistic nonlinearities @xmath12 .",
    "we quote for instance @xcite , where it is shown that both coexistence and exclusion may occur , depending on the relations between the diffusion rates , the coefficients of intra  specific and of inter  specific competitions .",
    "in this paper we face the multispecies lotka - volterra system ( [ modellk ] ) in the different perspective investigated by @xcite and we study the possibility of coexistence governed by very strong competition . as we shall discuss in detail in section  [ asintotic ] , the presence of large interactions of competitive type produces the spatial segregation of the densities in the limit configuration as @xmath13 , namely if @xmath14 solves  ( [ modellk ] ) , then , for all @xmath2 , @xmath15 converges to some @xmath6 in @xmath16 which satisfies @xmath17 so that @xmath18 .",
    "furthermore , in the limit , the densities satisfy a system of differential inequalities of the form @xmath19 where @xmath20 and @xmath21 , in the sense of definition [ def : dise ] .",
    "the link between the differential inequalities and population dynamics is reinforced by considering another class of segregation states between species , governed by a minimization principle rather than strong competition  diffusion . in @xcite",
    "( see also @xcite ) , the following energy functional latexmath:[\\[j(u)=\\sum_{i=1,\\dots , k}\\left\\{\\int_\\omega\\left(\\frac12    of the internal energies of @xmath4 positive densities @xmath6 having internal potentials @xmath23 , was considered .",
    "the problem of finding the _ minimum _ of @xmath24 in the class of @xmath4-tuples @xmath25 satisfying @xmath26 a.e . on @xmath5 for @xmath27 was investigated in @xcite , where it is proved that any non - trivial minimizer @xmath28 ( if it exists ) satisfies the differential inequalities .",
    "this further motivates the study of the solutions of ( [ segrego][2kvar ] ) as a natural step in the understanding of segregation phenomena occurring in population dynamics .",
    "remarkably enough , coupled with can be naturally interpreted as a _ free boundary problem _ with multiple phases : the unknown free boundary set is given by @xmath29 which represents the collection of the boundaries of the disjoint supports of the densities . on its support each density @xmath6 solves the elliptic equation @xmath30 , while the free boundary conditions are implicitly contained in the global differential inequalities .",
    "the study of the properties of @xmath31 is important from the ecological point of view since it provides information about how the segregation occurs , in particular about the way the territory is partitioned by the segregated populations . in this direction , in @xcite a number of qualitative properties both of @xmath6 and the free boundary set @xmath31 is exhibited .",
    "we refer the interested reader to @xcite for a brief review of the regularity theory so far developed , and to the above quoted papers for proofs and details .",
    "another question of particular interest is the existence of a _ strictly positive _ solution to ( [ segrego][2kvar ] ) , that is a solution of the differential inequalities ( [ 2kvar ] ) with each component @xmath8 and @xmath6 positive on a set of positive measure . as a matter of fact ,",
    "since all the asymptotic states of the lotka - volterra system have to satisfy ( [ segrego][2kvar ] ) , the existence of such a solution is necessary to ensure that _ all _ the species survive under strong competition .",
    "it has to be stressed that in @xcite , the strict positivity is guaranteed by assuming positive boundary values for each component , in the form @xmath32 with @xmath33 on a set of positive @xmath34measure .",
    "hence a major problem consists in proving the existence of a positive solution under natural boundary conditions , such as dirichlet or neumann homogeneous boundary conditions .",
    "this is precisely the problem we face in this paper : we consider ( [ segrego][2kvar ] ) with the dirichlet condition @xmath35 and we look for a strictly positive solution @xmath36 . the interesting case of neumann condition will be treated elsewhere ( see the concluding remarks ) .",
    "this is an interesting and mathematically challenging problem : we can not expect in general to avoid extinction of one or more species .",
    "for instance , if @xmath5 is convex , it is shown in @xcite that two competing species can not coexist under strong competition . on the other end",
    ", the main variational procedure leading to solutions of , that is the minimization of the internal energy @xmath37 , may fail under dirichlet homogeneous conditions , since it in general provides @xmath4-tuple of the form @xmath38 with all but one component identically zero , see @xcite for a similar result .",
    "therefore , some mechanism of different nature must occur in order to ensure coexistence of the species .",
    "in the present paper we show that the geometry of @xmath5 can play a crucial role in segregation phenomena . in line with @xcite , where two populations in planar domains of dumbbell shape are dealt with",
    ", we consider a class of non convex domains @xmath39 , @xmath40 , essentially composed by @xmath4 balls connected by thin corridors , as depicted in figure [ fig : dd ] ( see @xcite and section [ ipotesi ] for the precise definition ) .    under the main assumption that the dirichlet problems on each ball admit a nondegenerate local minimizer , we are able to prove existence and uniqueness of positive solutions to the free boundary problem ( [ segrego][2kvar ] ) , where each component is close to such a local minimizer ( theorem  1 ) . in ecological terms",
    "this means that if in the unperturbed domain and in absence of interaction each species lives in a stable configuration , then strong competition leads to coexistence and segregation of the populations .    our second result ( theorem 2 ) , concerns the multispecies lotka - volterra system endowed with the dirichlet null condition . under the same topological and nondegeneration assumptions ,",
    "we first prove the existence of a positive solution , provided that the competition parameter @xmath41 is large enough .",
    "this is obtained by exploiting a degree technique introduced by dancer @xcite to control domain perturbation in the case of certain nonlinear equations .",
    "theorem 2 is by itself an interesting result in the framework of multispecies systems .",
    "in fact , in spite of the rich literature dealing with the case @xmath42 of two populations , the case of @xmath43 species is less understood .",
    "we quote for instance @xcite for three - species competing systems with cross - diffusion and @xcite for the lotka - volterra model , where various sufficient conditions for coexistence are provided , depending on the values of the parameters involved .",
    "next we perform the asymptotic analysis as @xmath41 grows to infinity , and we prove that this solution converges to the unique segregation state found in theorem 1 .",
    "the biological implication of this result is now clear : all the species survive under strong competition in a segregating configuration .",
    "furthermore , as we shall see , they divide the domain in such a way that the @xmath7-th species does not invade the native territory @xmath44 of the other populations .",
    "we call this phenomenon _ non invading property_.    both results come from the study of a multispecies system that can be seen as a generalized lotka - volterra model with presence of spatial barriers localized in the balls",
    ". we shall introduce it in , after some rigorous definitions and precise statements of our results .",
    "let @xmath45 be a finite union of open balls @xmath46 such that @xmath47 are disjoint , @xmath48 .",
    "following @xcite , we consider a sequence of domains @xmath49 approximating @xmath50 in the following sense : there exists a compact zero measure set @xmath51 such that @xmath52 see figure [ fig : dd ] .",
    "let us fix a bounded smooth domain @xmath5 strictly containing @xmath53 for all @xmath40 .",
    "notice that if @xmath54 and @xmath55 , it is possible to extend @xmath56 to an element of @xmath57 by defining it to be zero outside of @xmath5 .",
    "thus in all the paper we shall think of all our functions as being in @xmath57 .",
    "we will make the following set of assumptions ( for every @xmath2 ) :    * @xmath58 is a carathodory function , it is odd and @xmath59 in the variable @xmath60 , uniformly in @xmath61 ; * @xmath62 for large @xmath63 , uniformly in @xmath61 for some @xmath64 ( @xmath65 if @xmath66 ) ,    where @xmath67 .",
    "furthermore , for any @xmath2 , we assume that the problem @xmath68 admits a positive solution @xmath69 which is nondegenerate in the following sense :    * there exists @xmath70 such that @xmath71 for every @xmath72 and for every @xmath7 .",
    "note that this implies that the linearized problem at @xmath73 @xmath74 has only the trivial solution .",
    "this is precisely the assumption used in @xcite .",
    "condition * ( nd ) * is stronger and essentially means that @xmath73 is a local nondegenerate minimizer of the energy on @xmath75 ( see also @xcite ) . as a model for @xmath9",

    ", the proof of theorem 1 relies on a careful analysis of the following auxiliary system : @xmath100 for @xmath2 .",
    "this system can be seen as a modification of the lotka - volterra model , through linear terms which are localized in the single balls : this feature will be crucial in order to obtain solutions with the _ non - invading _ property .",
    "notice that , due to the presence of the barriers , systems lack of the maximum principle , so that we can not ensure the positivity of its solutions nor even , by now , the competitive character of the model .",
    "as we shall see , this will cause some technical difficulties .",
    "nonetheless , by careful energy estimates and eigenvalue theory , the system at fixed @xmath41 will be shown to be suitably nondegenerate on @xmath39 , if @xmath92 is large enough .",
    "this will allow the application of the degree technique introduced in @xcite to control domain perturbation , and as a result we will obtain the existence of a solution @xmath101 of the system , which is close to @xmath83 .",
    "the major feature of this approach is that the whole procedure turns out to be _ uniform _ with respect to @xmath102 .",
