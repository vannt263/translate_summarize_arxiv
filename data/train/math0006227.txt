    "modular categories are tensor categories with additional structure ( braiding , twist , duality , a finite set of dominating simple objects satisfying a non - degeneracy axiom ) .",
    "if we remove the last axiom , we get a pre - modular category .",
    "a pre - modular category provides invariants of links , tangles , and sometimes of @xmath0-manifolds .",
    "any modular category yields a topological quantum field theory ( tqft ) in dimension three @xcite .",
    "in this paper we give an elementary construction of modular and pre - modular categories arising from the kauffman skein relations , without use of the representation theory of quantum groups at roots of unity .",
    "our method is based on the skein - theoretical construction of idempotents in the birman - murakami - wenzl ( bmw ) algebras given in @xcite .",
    "this work follows the program of turaev and wenzl @xcite .",
    "we give four specifications of parameters @xmath1 and @xmath2 ( entering the kauffman skein relations ) which lead to different series of modular categories . in each case",
    ", the quantum parameter @xmath2 is a root of unity and @xmath3 is a power of @xmath2 .",
    "the order @xmath4 of @xmath5 plays a key role in the discussion .",
    "when @xmath4 is odd , then either @xmath6 or @xmath7 .",
    "we note that the two cases are quite different : only one of them lead to a modular category , the other one produces a non - modularizable pre - modular category .",
    "it is well - known that the link invariant associated with the fundamental representation of the quantum group of type @xmath8 is a specialization of the homfly polynomial .",
    "taking the fundamental representations of the quantum groups of types @xmath9 , @xmath10 or @xmath11 one obtains specializations of the kauffman polynomial @xcite .",
    "more generally , with each of these quantum groups at a root of unity @xmath12 a pre - modular category can be associated @xcite .",
    "the order of @xmath12 determines the _ level _ @xmath13 of the category .",
    "it turns out that categories obtained from the quantum groups of types @xmath8 and @xmath14 , where @xmath12 is @xmath15th root of unity , are isomorphic ; here one has to consider either a non standard choice of the framing parameter , or the _ projective _ subcategory .",
    "the isomorphism interchanges the rank @xmath16 and the level @xmath13 of the category and it is known as the level - rank duality .",
    "this duality has no natural explanation in the context of quantum groups , because the roles of the parameters @xmath16 and @xmath13 are completely different there .    in our setting , both parameters @xmath16 and @xmath13 serve to restrict the size of the weyl alcove , and we have natural symmetries interchanging them .",
    "therefore , each of our ( pre- ) modular categories has its level - rank duality partner .",
    "in fact , all our specializations of parameters can be interpreted in two different ways as a quantum group specialization .",
    "accordingly , we denote our categories by pairs of the letters @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 ( we use just one of them if both coincide ) .",
    "our main results can be formulated as follows .    * we recover the symplectic ( @xmath18 in our notation ) and @xmath20 series of modular categories already obtained by turaev and wenzl @xcite .",
    "these series are constructed by killing negligible morphisms in the idempotent completed kauffman category . in the @xmath20 case we further use bruguires modularization procedure @xcite .",
    "this could be avoided here by considering a subcategory ( see @xcite ) .",
    "* we obtain two new series of modular categories in the orthogonal case : one in the even orthogonal case ( @xmath19 series ) and one in the mixed odd - even orthogonal case ( @xmath21 series ) .",
    "all of them are constructed by using bruguires modularization procedure . * except for the even orthogonal categories , we describe explicitly the representative sets of simple objects and state the verlinde formulas , which give the dimensions of the tqft modules . in the even orthogonal case , the complete description of the set of simple objects depends on a tricky computation which has still to be done . * we find a correspondence between our categories and categories obtained by the quantum group method .",
    "we show that the categories constructed here give a complete set of invariants that can be obtained from quantum groups of types @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 by using non - spin modules .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the first section",
    "we give the general definitions and theorems concerning pre - modular and modular categories .",
    "this includes bruguires modularization criterion , and an explicit description of a modularization functor for a modularizable pre - modular category whose _ transparent _ simple objects are invertible . in the second section we recall the main definitions and properties of the minimal idempotents in the bmw algebras constructed in @xcite . in the third section",
    "we construct the completed bmw category and use it in order to define series of pre - modular categories . in section 4 , studying transparent objects in these categories , we show that the symplectic category is modular and three other series satisfy bruguires modularization criterion . then for modular categories",
    "we describe the representative sets of simple objects , give the verlinde formulas and discuss spin and cohomological refinements . in the last section",
    "we explain how our pre - modular categories can be interpreted in terms of quantum groups",
