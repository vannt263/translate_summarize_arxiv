    "the departure of market prices from their theoretical black - scholes ( bs ) values has been discussed for a long time , and many market factors have been used to explain those anomalies , such as volatility , interest rate , moneyness , time to expiration , transaction costs , market liquidation , trading volume , bid - ask spread , option open interest , and short sale constraints , etc .",
    "examples of these studies include @xcite , and the references therein .",
    "although the growth rate is an important factor to describe the dynamics of stock prices , it is rarely discussed in the literature for the biases of bs formula , except the work of @xcite .",
    "the purposes of this paper are to identify whether the growth rate of stock price can be used to explain the biases of bs formula , and to determine the price of european call option through an equilibrium argument under the bs model .",
    "risk neural valuation approach was first introduced by @xcite , and has been extended by @xcite , and others .",
    "the risk neural price of an option is the discounted expectation of its payoff under a risk neural pricing measure , which satisfies the martingale constraint that the discounted process of stock price is a martingale under this measure .",
    "the existence of risk neural martingale measure is equivalent to the absence of arbitrage opportunity .",
    "@xcite investigated the existence of martingale restriction using s&p 100 option prices , and found that the data strongly reject the martingale restriction .",
    "those observed anomalies of bs formula indicate that options should be valued by equilibrium methods rather than no - arbitrage models @xcite .",
    "it is the physical measure of the market that determines the dynamics of stock price , rather than the artificial equivalent martingale measure , therefore the true probability of an option to bring a positive return to the holder is calculated under the physical measure .",
    "the probability is determined by all of the market factors appearing in the bs formula , besides the growth rate of stock price .",
    "our numerical investigations show that when the growth rates are negative , there is almost no option with probability of positive return larger than @xmath0 with respect to their bs prices .",
    "when the growth rates are positive , the probabilities are on average larger than @xmath0 for in - the - money options , and less than @xmath0 for out - of - the - money options . therefore the equilibrium prices should be adjusted from their bs values , such that the market prices are on average larger than the bs values for in - the - money options , and less than the bs values for out - of - the - money options .",
    "these theoretical predictions are similar to the empirical results reported by @xcite , where the market prices are on average lager than the bs values for in - the - money options , and less than the bs values for out - of - money options .",
    "a equilibrium argument is applied to determine the option price through the probabilities of positive returns .",
    "the market clearing price is the price at which both parties in the transaction come to an agreement on the probability of positive return .",
    "the individual requirements for probabilities of positive returns can be different among the investors according to their attitudes to risk , and the option price can be calculated for each specified probability of positive return .    the performance of the proposed method and the bs formula are compared numerically under the bs model .",
    "it is found that the values of proposed method are on average larger than the bs values for in - the - money options , and less than the bs values for out - of - the - money options . and",
    "a typical smile shape of implied volatilities is also observed for different growth rates of stock prices .",
    "these theoretical phenomenon are similar to the empirical anomalies of bs values reported by @xcite , which indicate that the proposed valuation method may have some merit .",
    "the rest of this article is organized as follows .",
    "section 2 derives the probabilities of positive returns for european call options under the bs model , and investigates the influence of market factors on the probabilities numerically .",
    "section 3 determines the option price using probability of positive return .",
    "section 4 compares bs formula with the proposed method from their values and the implied volatilities respectively .",
    "section 5 summarizes this paper and discusses the results .",
    "in the black - scholes framework , the market is frictionless , and the dynamics of stock price is described by a geometric brownian motion , @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the stock price at time @xmath3 , @xmath4 is the expected growth rate of stock price , @xmath5 is the volatility , @xmath6 is a standard brownian motion .",
    "the solution of equation ( [ price ] ) is @xmath7,\\ ] ] where @xmath8 is the stock price at time zero , @xmath9 is the time to expiration of the option .",
    "the black - scholes price for a european call option is @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the strike price of the option , @xmath12 is the cumulated distribution function of standard normal distribution , @xmath13 is the compounded riskless interest rate , and @xmath14    the risk neural price of option is determined by those market factors , except the growth rate of stock price .",
    "therefore most of the empirical studies do not use growth rate of stock price to explain the biases of bs formula .",
    "it is the physical measure of the stock market which determines the dynamics of the stock price , therefore the true probability of positive return should be calculated under the physical measure , instead of the artificial martingale measure .",
    "let @xmath15 denote the price of a european call option at time zero , and @xmath16 denote the physical measure , then the probability of positive return is @xmath17 where @xmath18 .",
    "we have the following result .",
    "[ prop1 ] in the black - scholes model , when a european call option matures , the probability for a holder to achieve positive return is @xmath19 where @xmath20 @xmath12 is the cumulated distribution function of standard normal distribution , @xmath15 is the price of the call option , @xmath8 is the stock price at time zero , @xmath11 is the strike price , @xmath4 is the growth rate of stock price , @xmath5 is the volatility , @xmath13 is the riskless interest rate , and @xmath9 is the time to expiration .    see appendix a.    the probability of positive return is a decreasing function of @xmath15 , @xmath11 , @xmath5 and @xmath13 respectively , and is an increasing function of @xmath4 and @xmath8 respectively , when the other factors are held constant .",
    "the proof is directly from the monotonicity of distribution function .",
    "the probabilities of positive returns for different options will be observed by the investors from the historical data , and the holders will try to buy the options with probabilities beyond their individual requirements , and would nt buy the options with lower probabilities .",
    "the option price will be adjusted according to their probabilities of positive returns to clear the market .",
    "the equilibrium price of an option is a balance of probabilities for both parties in the transaction .      as the probability of positive return",
    "is determined by the market factors , we try to explain the observed biases of bs formula from the compositions of market factors .",
    "the probabilities of positive returns are calculated with respect to the bs values , and the compositions of market factors whose probabilities of positive returns are beyond @xmath0 are plotted in figure [ urstk ] .    set the market factors as @xmath21 , @xmath22 $ ] , @xmath23 $ ] per year .",
    "the compositions of @xmath24 are computed with @xmath25 per year , @xmath26 days , @xmath27 $ ] per year .",
    "the compositions of @xmath28 are calculated with @xmath29 per year , @xmath26 days , @xmath30 $ ] per year . and",
    "the compositions of @xmath31 are calculated with @xmath29 per year , @xmath32 per year , @xmath33 $ ] days .    from figure ( [ urstk ] )",
    ", we can see that the probabilities of positive returns must be less than @xmath0 , when the growth rates of stock prices are negative .",
    "the probabilities are on average beyond @xmath0 for in - the - money options , and below @xmath0 for out - of - the - money options , when the growth rates of stock prices are positive .",
    "the option holders will try to buy the options with probabilities beyond @xmath0 , and not to buy the options with probabilities below @xmath0 , which makes the market prices are on average larger than the bs values for in - the - money options , and less than the bs values for out - of - the - money options .",
    "it is interesting to find that these theoretical predictions are consistent with the empirical observations of @xcite , where the market prices are on average lager than the bs values for in - the - money options , and less than the bs values for out - of - the - money options .",
    "therefore the observed anomalies of bs values may be correlated with the growth rates of stock prices , and the probabilities of positive returns should be taken into account in derivative valuation .",
    "when there are transaction costs or other frictions , @xcite show that the no - arbitrage conditions only place bounds on option prices , therefore the prices of options should be determined through equilibrium methods , rather than no - arbitrage models @xcite .",
    "the financial market without friction has been discussed in the previous section , and the numerical investigations indicate that the bs values should be adjusted according to their probabilities of positive returns , therefore bs values are not the equilibrium prices of options .    an equilibrium argument can be applied to determine the fair price of option through the probability of positive return . if the probability of positive return is larger than the equilibrium level , the investors would try to buy this option until the option price increases to eliminate the extra possibility of positive return . and",
    "the investors would not buy the options with probabilities below the equilibrium level , until the option price decrease enough to compensate the risk of negative return . on the other hand",
    ", the requirements of probabilities to achieve positive returns may be different among the investors according to their attitudes to risk .",
    "the option price can be deduced from ( [ pequation ] ) , if the equilibrium probability @xmath34 is determined previously , and we have the following proposition .    [ propprice ] in the black - scholes market , if the equilibrium probability of positive return is @xmath34 , and @xmath35 , the equilibrium price of a european call option is @xmath36 otherwise , the required probability of positive return is beyond the the probability of the option to be exercised , therefore @xmath37 does not exist ( nan ) . where @xmath38 is the inverse function of the standard normal distribution function .    from equation ( [ call ] ) , we can find that the individual attitude to risk is important to option valuation .",
    "the true probability of an option to be exercised is @xmath39 , and those investors , whose individual requirements for the probabilities of positive returns are beyond @xmath39 , would not buy this option . as",
    "market prices should lie in the no - arbitrage bounds , the option price @xmath37 will be modified as @xmath40 .    in the black - scholes model , the equilibrium option price @xmath37 is a decreasing function with respect to @xmath34 .",
    "it is directly from equation ( [ call ] ) .",
    "this proposition says that the investors , whose requirements for probabilities of positive returns are larger than @xmath34 , would not buy the options with prices beyond @xmath37 . on the other hand , these investors will buy the options with prices below @xmath37 .",
