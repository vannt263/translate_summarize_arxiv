    "scalar - tensor theories belong to a class of theories that modify the einstein s theory of gravity and have been under intense investigation over the last few years .",
    "the most interesting class of scalar - tensor models are described by the horndeski lagrangian @xcite , which gives second - order field equations in four dimensions .",
    "it was soon realized that these scalar - tensor models of modified gravity share a classical galilean symmetry @xcite , and most of these models represent a special case of horndeski s theory .",
    "one of the terms appearing in the horndeski lagrangian is the derivative coupling of a scalar field to einstein tensor .",
    "the cosmological implications of the derivative coupling to gravity was first discussed in @xcite , and subsequently it was shown that the presence of this coupling in the lagrangian gives second - order field equations @xcite , in accordance with horndeski s theory .",
    "a cosmological model was discussed in @xcite , where the derivative coupling was introduced to explain early as well as late expansion of the universe .",
    "quintessence and phantom cosmology in the presence of this coupling was presented in @xcite , while accelerating expansion was discussed in @xcite .",
    "the early inflationary phase was studied in @xcite , where it was found that the derivative coupling acted like a friction term .",
    "it was also found that this term had a galilean symmetry @xcite .",
    "observational tests of inflation with a field coupled to the einstein tensor was presented in @xcite , while in @xcite it was shown that the derivative coupling to gravity provided a natural mechanism to suppress the overproduction of heavy particles after inflation .",
    "particle production after the end of inflation in the presence of derivative couplings was also discussed in @xcite .",
    "this interesting cosmological behavior of the derivative coupling of a scalar field to the einstein tensor stems from the fact that this term introduces a scale in the theory and effectively acts as a cosmological constant @xcite .",
    "as is well known , the presence of the cosmological constant alters the local properties of spacetime , allowing the evasion of the no - hair theorems .",
    "hairy black hole solutions were found in the presence of a cosmological constant .",
    "therefore , it is natural to ask whether black hole solutions exist in gravity theories with derivative couplings in the absence of a cosmological constant .    in the case of a positive cosmological constant with a minimally coupled scalar field with a self - interaction potential ,",
    "black hole solutions were found in  @xcite , and a numerical solution , albeit an unstable one , was presented in  @xcite .",
    "if the scalar field is non - minimally coupled , a solution exists with a quartic self - interaction potential  @xcite .",
    "however , this solution was also shown to be unstable  @xcite . in the case of a negative cosmological constant",
    ", stable solutions were found numerically for spherical geometries  @xcite , and an exact solution in asymptotically ads space with hyperbolic geometry was presented in  @xcite , and later generalized to include charge  @xcite , and further generalized to non - conformal solutions @xcite .",
    "also , an exact solution of a charged c - metric conformally coupled to a scalar field was presented in  @xcite .",
    "further hairy solutions in the presence of a cosmological constant were reported in @xcite with various properties .",
    "black hole solutions in the general horndeski theory are not known . in theories resulting from the truncation of higher - dimensional theories , which in four dimensions give second - order field equations ,",
    "black hole solutions were discussed in @xcite . in a gravity model with a scalar field coupled to the einstein tensor , an instability was found outside the horizon of a reissner - nordstrm black hole , by calculating the quasinormal spectrum of scalar perturbations @xcite .",
    "it was shown that for higher angular momentum quantum numbers and derivative coupling constant larger than a certain critical value , the effective potential develops a negative gap near the black hole horizon .",
    "this indicates that a phase transition to a hairy black hole configuration can occur .    in our previous work @xcite",
    ", we investigated this effect in detail .",
    "we considered a gravity model consisting of an electromagnetic field and a scalar field coupled to the einstein tensor with vanishing cosmological constant .",
    "we showed that a reissner - nordstrm black hole undergoes a second - order phase transition to a hairy black hole configuration of generally anisotropic hair at a certain critical temperature .",
    "using perturbation theory , we calculated analytically the properties of the hairy black hole configuration near the critical temperature and showed that it is energetically favorable over the corresponding reissner - nordstrm black hole .",
    "spherically symmetric black hole solutions were also discussed in @xcite .",
    "the recent advances in holography , and in particular the application of the gauge / gravity duality to condensed matter systems ( for a review , see @xcite ) has revived the interest on the dynamics of a scalar field outside a black hole horizon .",
    "the transition from a metallic state to a superconducting state in a strongly - coupled system can be described by its dual weakly - coupled gravitational system using the ads / cft correspondence @xcite . the simplest holographic superconductor model @xcite is described by an einstein - maxwell - scalar field theory with a negative cosmological constant . at high enough temperatures the black hole - scalar system is decoupled and the black hole is stable .",
    "the boundary gauge theory describes a metallic state .",
    "when the temperature is lowered , the black hole becomes unstable and a new black hole configuration with scalar hair forms .",
    "the dual gauge theory describes a superconducting state ( for a review , see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "an exact gravity dual of a gapless holographic superconductor was discussed in @xcite .",
    "the dynamics of a holographic superconductor depends crucially on the behavior of the scalar field near the horizon of the black hole .",
    "a model was presented in @xcite consisting of an electromagnetic field and a scalar field minimally coupled to gravity in the presence of a negative cosmological constant .",
    "it was shown that the effective mass of the scalar field becomes negative for large values of the charge of the background reissner - nordstrm black hole , thus breaking an abelian gauge symmetry outside the horizon of the reissner - nordstrm black hole . in the language of gauge / gravity duality",
    ", this corresponds to the formation of a condensate in the boundary gauge theory , which below a certain critical temperature triggers the transition from a metallic state to a superconducting one . a heuristic way to explain this behavior of the scalar field outside the black hole horizon",
    "was presented in @xcite .",
    "if the scalar particle is highly charged , then its gravitational attraction to the black hole is overcome by its electrostatic repulsion , and because the space has a boundary ( being asymptotically ads ) , it reflects back and condenses outside the black hole horizon . a generalization to higher dimensions and to other horizon topologies",
    "was presented in @xcite .    in this work ,",
    "our main motivation is to study possible instabilities of a black hole near its horizon in asymptotically flat space ( vanishing cosmological constant ) .",
    "we consider a gravitational system consisting of an electromagnetic field and a charged scalar field which , together with the standard minimal coupling to gravity , also couples to the einstein tensor . as it was discussed in @xcite , in the absence of the derivative coupling to the einstein tensor",
    ", we can not have a ",
    "geometrical \" breaking of the abelian symmetry near the black hole horizon , since the space is asymptotically flat .    by turning on the derivative coupling to the einstein tensor , and solving the resulting dynamical system of einstein - maxwell - scalar field equations",
    ", we will show that there is a critical temperature at which a phase transition to a hairy black hole configuration occurs .",
    "the dimensionful coupling constant of the derivative coupling to the einstein tensor provides the scale for the confining potential , which is an effect similar to the ads radius provided by the cosmological constant .",
    "we argue that the new hairy black hole configuration results from the breaking of the abelian symmetry near the horizon by curvature effects . we obtain a hairy black hole which is spherically symmetric .",
    "our discussion is organized as follows . in section  [ sect1 ]",
    ", we set up the theory and derive the field equations . in section  [ sect2 ] , we solve the field equations perturbatively .",

    "we considered a gravitating system without a cosmological constant term ( therefore living in asymptotically flat space ) consisting of an electromagnetic field , and a massive charged scalar field which had a derivative coupling to the einstein tensor of strength @xmath7 . for small values of the scalar field we solved the coupled system of einstein - maxwell - scalar field equations perturbatively .",
    "we found that for sufficiently large values of the coupling constant @xmath54 , an abelian @xmath125 gauge symmetry was broken in the vicinity of the horizon of the black hole , leading to a new black hole configuration with isotropic hair .",

    "the scale introduced by the dimensionful coupling constant @xmath7 acted similarly to the scale of the negative cosmological constant in ads space , producing a potential well that could trap scalar particles near the horizon . unlike in ads space , which yields a power law asymptotic behavior for the scalar field , in our case we showed that the scalar field decayed exponentially away from the horizon .",
