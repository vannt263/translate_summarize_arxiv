    "analysis of pioneer and groundbased observations of jupiter , summarized by @xcite , led to an expected jovian cloud structure that included an upper ammonia cloud layer starting near 700-mb and a putative nh@xmath2sh cloud top near 2 bars , which was thought to be optically thick outside the hot spot regions .",
    "the putative ammonia cloud was thought to have two particle populations : a vertically compact layer of large particles ( of 3 to 100 @xmath0 m in radius ) and a vertically diffuse component of small particles ( @xmath5 m ) extending up to 200 - 300 mb in low latitude regions .",
    "however , the more diffuse component should have produced prominent spectral signatures at 9.4 @xmath0 m and 26 @xmath0 m , which were not observed @xcite . after considering possible masking of these features by the likely tetrahedral shapes of these particles ,",
    "@xcite concluded that these particles could not be primarily composed of ammonia ice .",
    "it was also the case that neither voyager infrared interferometer spectrometer ( iris ) observations @xcite , nor microwave observations @xcite , ever found an ammonia vapor profile that would support a 700-mb condensation level .",
    "carlson s derived condensation pressure was closer to 500 mb , while a later analysis of microwave observations @xcite suggested nh@xmath4 condensation near 600 mb .    only in the last decade or",
    "so has there been even a hint of the spectral signatures expected of nh@xmath4 ice clouds . from an analysis of a 3-@xmath0 m absorption anomaly in a central - disk spectrum of jupiter",
    ", @xcite inferred the existence of a layer of ammonia ice particles of 10 @xmath0 m in radius , beginning at 550 mb with a scale height of 30% of the gas scale height .",
    "the wide field of view covered by the observation ( roughly a quarter of the jovian disk ) suggested that the ammonia ice was widely distributed .",
    "@xcite found a similar absorption anomaly in analysis of observations by the galileo near infrared mapping spectrometer ( nims ) , but concluded that it was not due to nh@xmath4 ice because a key spectral signature at 2.0 @xmath0 m was missing .",
    "the subsequent @xcite detection of spectrally identifiable ammonia clouds ( siacs ) in other nims observations was based on depressed reflectivity at 2.7 @xmath0 m as well as at 2.0 @xmath0 m , but these detections covered a very tiny fraction ( @xmath6% ) of jupiter s cloud features . on the other hand , @xcite inferred more widely distributed ammonia ice , at least in some latitude bands , from a detection of a 9.4-spectral feature in jovian spectra obtained from the cassini composite infrared spectrometer ( cirs ) .",
    "the model calculations of @xcite implied that the 9.4-@xmath0 m ice feature could only be detected when the aerosols were at pressures @xmath7500 mb and the particle effective radius was within a factor of two of 1 @xmath0 m .",
    "new band models for absorption developed by @xcite and recent additions to the hitran line data base motivated @xcite to update exponential sum models for absorption .",
    "they found substantial changes relative to the absorption models used in the analysis by @xcite and undertook a reanalysis of the iso spectrum .",
    "they found that the best fit to the 3-absorption feature was obtained not with as the sole absorber , but instead when particles of and were both present , with the predominant opacity provided by .",
    "two types of solutions were found to provide good fits to the iso spectrum : one had relatively large and particles at nearly the same pressure , near 500 mb , and the other had small -coated particles closer to 350 mb , with large particles again near 500 mb .",
    "the large fov of the iso measurement did not permit any conclusions concerning the spatial distribution of these two components , i.e. whether some clouds had only particles , and others had only particles , or whether the two types existed in the same physical location .    in the following analysis we present new results based on near - ir spatially resolved spectral observations of the cassini visual and infrared mapping spectrometer ( vims ) .",
    "our analysis takes advantage of recently improved models of methane and ammonia gas absorption , and uses refractive index properties of putative cloud materials in constraining model structures and composition .",
    "we first describe the vims observations , then the radiation transfer methods , the modeling results , how they compare with other models based on other observations at visible , near - ir , and thermal wavelengths , and finally summarize their implications for jovian cloud structure .",
    "we show that vims observations display a widely distributed strong absorption in the 3.1-@xmath0 m region of the spectrum , and evidence for a much weaker absorption near 2 @xmath0 m , both of which are qualitative features expected from a cloud consisting of ammonia ice particles . however , it is only the darker cloud features , with smaller optical depths , that can be well fit with ammonia ice as the sole absorber .",
    "we find that brighter clouds require more absorption at 3 without increased absorption at 2 and that this can be provided by nh@xmath2sh .",
    "for constraining models of low - latitude jovian cloud structure we used spectra acquired by vims during cassini s flyby of jupiter in december 2000 .",
    "the vims instrument and investigation are described by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the instrument s spectral range is 0.35 - 5.1 @xmath0 m , with an effective pixel size of 0.5 milliradians on a side and a near - ir spectral resolution of approximately 15 nm ( sampled at intervals of approximately 16 nm ) .",
    "our analysis focuses on the 1 - 3.2 interval where scattering by aerosols predominates over rayleigh scattering and where a wide range of atmospheric pressures can be sampled and discriminated by means of variations in gas absorption with wavelength ( fig.[fig : pendepth ] ) . in this wavelength",
    "range the contribution of jupiter s thermal emission is everywhere less than 0.1% of the observed",
    "i / f . to provide an approximate comparison with prior low phase angle observations we chose vims data cube cm_1355256529 , obtained on 11 december 2000 at a phase angle of 2.5 .",
    "this provides a pixel size of 9925 km at the sub - spacecraft point . in fig .",

    "the encircled pixels in the figure are locations from which we extracted vims spectra , taking samples from the north equatorial belt ( neb ) , and from the equatorial zone ( ez ) . the pixel labeled 12x16y , which is brightest at 4.798 @xmath0 m , is located in a region where deep cloud opacity is at a relative minimum , corresponding to a relatively low reflectivity at 1.864 @xmath0 m . to obtain samples at higher spatial resolution and less sensitive to details of backscatter phase functions , we also selected data cube cm_1356976257 , obtained on 31 december 2000 at a phase angle of 67.8 , with a sub - spacecraft pixel size of 4887 km , which is about twice the resolution obtained from the low phase angle cube . sample images and target selections from this cube",
    "are shown in fig.[fig : imvims2 ] .",
    "vims image cubes were processed using the pipeline processing code downloaded from the planetary data system , described by @xcite .",
    "the cubes were navigated by manual adjustments of planet center coordinates using visual comparisons of model and image limbs at window wavelengths to find an approximate best fit , which is estimated to be within a fraction of a pixel .",
    "this provided sufficient definition of view angles and latitudes near the disk center to allow a meaningful comparison of spectral characteristics in broad latitude regions , as appropriate for the relatively low spatial resolution of these observations .",
    "the vims calibration obtained by the pipeline processing has an uncertainty that has not yet been documented , but is at least as large as the near - ir solar spectral irradiance uncertainty of @xmath83%-5% @xcite .",
    "it appears to be less than 10% uncertain , based on window - region comparisons with independent spectra of jupiter , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : vimscalcomp ] . in the 0.9 - 0.98 @xmath0 m region",
    "the disk - integrated vims spectrum is @xmath88% brighter than that of @xcite . in the 0.9 - 2.2 @xmath0 m region we computed a central - disk vims spectrum to compare with the groundbased central - disk spectrum of @xcite . in the brighter window regions , where thin upper - level hazes and low - level artifacts have much reduced impact , the vims observations are within @xmath85% of the @xcite spectrum , except near 1.6 @xmath0 m , where an order - sorting filter joint in the vims detector array apparently results in poor response corrections .",
    "the vims spectrum averaged over the same angular fov as a 1996 iso spectrum @xcite is found to be about 20% brighter , which might be entirely due to temporal variations or even phase angle variations ( the vims and iso phase angles in this comparison are 2.5and 11respectively ) .",
    "another possible contribution to the vims - iso difference is the iso calibration uncertainty , which could be as large as 12% for wavelengths less than 3.8 @xcite .",
    "overall , there seems to be a tendency for the vims spectra to be on the high side , but how much of the differences are due to calibration errors as opposed to temporal variation or phase - angle differences is uncertain .",
    "there are two important artifacts that need to be considered in the interpretation of vims spectra .",
    "the first has to do with responsivity corrections at wavelengths in close proximity to joints between order sorting filters overlaid on the vims linear detector arrays .",
    "the joints of concern here appear at wavelengths of 1.64 and 2.98 .",
    "the required responsivity correction factors to compensate for shading effects are very large for the former ( @xmath8300 ) and relatively small for the latter ( @xmath82 ) . to test the correction near 2.98 we used a comparison between the iso 3-spectrum of @xcite and a central disk vims spectrum covering approximately the same field of view . when the iso spectrum is empirically scaled by a factor of 1.2 , the two spectra are in generally excellent agreement ( fig .",
    "[ fig : isocomp ] ) , including the region of the filter joint near 2.98 .",
    "however , we do see a significant disagreement near 2.58 , where the iso spectrum reaches a deeper minimum .",
    "this may be related to the second kind of artifact , which is discussed later .",
    "there is also a small discrepancy near 2.52 , where the iso spectrum has a local minimum that is not seen in the vims spectrum .",
    "a similar discrepancy is also seen between model spectra and the vims observations in this region .",
    "the rather large responsivity correction near 1.64 does have significant errors , which can be seen from a comparison between a groundbased spectrum of @xcite and a vims spectrum from a nearby latitude region ( fig .",
    "[ fig : banfieldcomp ] ) .",
    "the discrepant region is from about 1.60 to 1.68 .",
    "this can also be seen from a comparison to the @xcite spectrum shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : vimscalcomp]c .",
    "it is also apparent in the striking disagreement between model and observations in this region , as discussed in later sections .    1.2 ( dot - dash ) with comparable fields of view covering about 1/4 of the disk .",
    "the iso spectrum was converted from the flux spectrum of @xcite .",
    "vertical dotted lines mark the locations of an absorption feature of ice at 2.95 and the vims filter joint at 2.98 .,width=336 ]        the second type of artifact is evident in the 2.3-spectral region where the groundbased spectrum in fig .  [",
    "fig : banfieldcomp ] has a minimum that is a factor of 10 lower than that of the vims spectrum .",
    "this can not be attributed to local variations because the latitude difference is small and the i / f disagreement is typical of several comparisons . to resolve which of these two measurements is more believable we used 1997 nicmos observations ( hst program 7445 , reta beebe pi ) , selecting an image ( n49o01mvs ) made with the f237 m filter , which heavily weights the region of disagreement , as shown by the filter transmission plot in fig .",
    "[ fig : banfieldcomp ] .",
    "we computed synthetic f237 m i / f values from the groundbased i / f spectrum and from vims i / f spectra along a central meridian scan using weighted integrals over the spectra .",
    "the weighting function was the product of filter throughput and solar spectral irradiance , normalized to yield a unit integral over the same spectral range .",
    "as shown in fig.[fig : f237mcomp ] , the synthetic photometry result for the @xcite spectrum is in good agreement with the nicmos scan . but synthetic f237 m values obtained from vims spectra are @xmath84.5 times as large as the nicmos values .",
    "the artifact is not a simple offset error , because that does not provide the correct spectral shape .",
    "it seems more likely that the artifact is due to light scattered by the grating , which allows light in bright regions of the spectrum to contaminate measurements of dark regions .",
    "this may also be responsible for the discrepancy with the iso spectrum near 2.58 evident in fig .",
    "[ fig : isocomp ]",
    ". in any case , the defect in the vims measurements near 2.3 has the effect of distorting our model fits in the stratosphere , suggesting far more particulate reflectivity than is actually present .    .",
    "the plus symbols are for a central meridian latitude scan with a 3-pixel longitudinal average .",
    "offset ( dashed ) and scaled ( dotted ) versions of the nicmos scan are also shown.,width=307 ]      for most applications at moderate signal levels , the random noise level of vims is very small , nominally less than one digital quantization number ( dn ) ( kevin baines , personal communication , january 2010 ) .",
    "as there is no published equation defining how vims measurement noise depends on signal level , exposure time , and wavelength , we tried to better characterize the noise by comparing spectra in cubes that imaged the same region of jupiter with as small a time difference as possible .",
    "we chose cm_1355309574 and cm_1355309697 cubes , which were exposed only two minutes apart .",
    "these results were consistent within about 1.2 dn rms for a single measurement , even for signal levels up to 2000 dn or more . for the cubes we used in our detailed spectral analysis , which had exposures much shorter than these comparison cubes",
    ", the noise level would still be only 0.14% at 2.7 and thus not a significant error source .",
    "however , at signals 100 times smaller , as found near 2.3 , the noise becomes a much larger fraction of the total signal .",
    "this is evident from the rapid variations with wavelength observed in that region of the spectrum , which are up to 50% or more of the signal level .",
    "this can be roughly characterized as an offset noise in i / f , which we crudely estimated as @xmath85@xmath9 from the on - disk spectra .",
    "other possible sources of uncertainty , though not strictly random noise , are scattered light inside the spectrometer , wavelength errors , line - spread uncertainties , and variable absolute calibration and wavelength calibration errors .",
    "we lumped all these potential uncertainties into a somewhat arbitrary 2.5% error proportional to signal , and an i / f offset error of @xmath85@xmath9 .",
    "we did look into the possibility of wavelength errors by making fits with shifted wavelength scales , and determining @xmath10 as a function of shift .",
    "we found that the minimum @xmath10 was within 1 nm of the nominal wavelength scale and that no revision was needed .",
    "we followed the same approach described by @xcite . in summary , we used the tabulated results of @xcite for jupiter s temperature structure down to the 22-bar level , and assumed an atmospheric composition of he / h@xmath11=0.157@xmath120.003 @xcite and ch@xmath2/h@xmath11= 2.1e-3@xmath120.4e-3 @xcite , which are expressed as number density ratios .",

    "if all the cloud layers were composed of broken cloud fields of opaque elements , a linear combination of reflecting layer contributions would be an ideal model for representing the combined i / f of the vertical cloud structure . by fitting parameters of such a model to obtain agreement with the observed i / f spectra or variation of i / f with angle , it can also be used to obtain a rough idea of the distribution of scatterers when the cloud layers are optically thin .",

    "we assigned a value of 6% to the error in computed optical depth , but converted this to i / f under the crude assumption that i / f would be proportional to the negative exponential of optical depth .",
    "this leads to a fractional i / f error estimate of 1-(i / f)@xmath58 , where @xmath59 is the fractional error in optical depth .",

    "these results show some of the tendencies observed in the reflecting layer parameters .",
    "the cloud layers seem to descend to higher pressures moving from zone to belt , but there is not a clear tendency in optical depth .",
    "the remarkable feature is the close proximity of the layer of small particles to the layer of much larger particles , suggesting that both particle populations might actually overlap in the same layer , perhaps with different scale heights .",
    "the descent to higher pressures in the neb also helps to hide the particles from observations at thermal wavelengths , helping to explain the latitudinal dependence of features detected by @xcite , as we discuss later in sec.[sec : wong ] .",
    "there are two counter examples to the general rule of near overlap of and layers .",
    "these are for two near equatorial spectra ( 11x14y and 11x15y ) , for which these two layers are separated by nearly 300 mb .",
    "for these spectra the layer stayed at low pressures characteristic of the equatorial zone , but the layer moved to higher pressures , as did the bottom cloud layer .",

    "this shows that the -coated particle layer ( 336 mb ) provides important contributions in several regions , including near 1.5 , near 2 , and from 2.95 to 3.2 .",
    "the layer ( 635 mb ) provides important contributions near 2 , 2.5 , and from 2.65 to 2.95 , but has so much absorption beyond 2.97 that it contributes essentially nothing to the i / f from 2.97 to 3.2 .",
    "thus , these two different absorbers are seen to make distinctly different contributions . the deepest cloud layer ( 1252 mb )",
    "is seen to make significant contributions only to the window regions .",
    "the sensitivity of model spectra to specific model parameters can be discerned from the fractional derivatives of a model spectrum with respect to each of the model parameters .",

    "this example illustrates the relative independence of the spectral derivatives from each other , confirming the possibility of using observations to independently constrain the parameters .",
    "for example , although the upper layer of particles is only important in the more opaque regions of the spectrum , the fractional derivatives with respect to pressure ( right , top row ) and optical depth ( right , third row ) are distinctly different .",
    "a similar difference can be found for other layers , and especially large differences exist between different layers .",
    "note that particle size changes in layer 2 ( the -coated layer ) have the greatest effect at 2.97 and from there to 3.2 , while the size changes in layer 3 ( the layer ) have the largest impact between 2.5 and 2.9 .",
    "if we had used as the example a fit at low phase angles , and included an appropriately large number of quadrature points to capture the backward phase function peak , then the large particle layer ( layer 3 ) would also have an important effect at short wavelengths .",
    "but models with such phase functions do nt fit as well as models without strong backward peaks .    in spite of the distinctive derivative spectra shown in fig.[fig : derivatives ]",
    ", there are many spectra where the best fit and layers are so close together that they become much more highly correlated with respect to pressure and optical depth variations . to fit these spectra and derive reasonable uncertainty estimates , we revised the model to use a fixed pressure offset between layers 2 and 3 , so that the uncertainty for the layer 2 pressure then becomes the same as that for the layer 3 pressure , except that the two layers have correlated uncertainties .",
    "this tendency for both small -coated particles and much larger particles to reside at nearly the same pressure level suggests that they might actually be members of two different populations in the same layer .",
    "it is also possible that forms as a coating on the larger particles , although that would not work well for the entire contribution , because the small particle component is needed to raise the reflectivity at short wavelengths , and the coated large particles do nt seem capable of producing the 2.97-feature .              the effects of different ammonia and para hydrogen profiles",
    "are illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : profilespecs ] .",
    "the difference between neb and ez profiles is relatively small , and our best fits were obtained with the the ez profile for all spectra for which we did fits with both profiles , suggesting that the neb profile we chose did not contain quite enough at high altitudes .",
    "the probe profile makes a huge difference and is not a best fit with even the darkest spectrum we observed ( 13x14y ) . while we can not rule it out in a local region , due to lack of spatial resolution , it is certainly not acceptable over an extended region comparable to the area sampled by a vims pixel .",
    "the difference between normal and equilibrium hydrogen profiles is also relatively small and restricted to a region that does not provide a significant constraint on the cloud models . given that atmosphere appears to be intermediate between these states at low latitudes @xcite , the actual difference is about half that between the extreme cases shown in the figure .",
    "thus , we did not try to account for potential variations in the ortho - para ratio .",
    "instead we assumed equilibrium hydrogen in all the fits , confident that this convenience would have no significant effect on our conclusions .",
    "we fit several spectra with the nominal calibration and also with the vims i / f spectra multiplied by a scaling factor to simulate the effect of a change in absolute calibration . for a uniform fractional decrease in the measured i / f , we found that derived pressures and optical depths also decreased , the former by relatively little , just a fraction of the fractional calibration change , and the latter by much more , changing by one ( at low optical depths ) to several times ( at higher optical depths ) the fractional change in calibration ( large optical depths require a larger fractional change to produce the same fractional change in reflectivity ) .",
    "this is not too surprising , since the overall brightness ( which is changed by the scaling ) is a strong function of the aerosol loading , while the shape of the spectrum ( which is not changed ) is strongly controlled by the vertical distribution of the aerosols .",
    "these results suggest that opacities we derive have additional uncertainties contributed by calibration uncertainties of about 5% to 20% , while the pressures have additional uncertainties 0 - 4% .",
    "we also found about a 10% affect on the wavelength dependence exponent for the bottom layer .",
    "the particle radius error contribution was not significant for layer 2 but 5 - 10% for layer 3 .",
    "all these contributions should be combined with prior estimates using the root - sum - square method .",
    "the galileo probe entered the atmosphere of jupiter on 7 december 1995 at a latitude of 6.6n , near the boundary between the equatorial zone and neb , and at the edge of a 5-hot spot , which is a region of unusually low aerosol opacity ( in the deeper layers ) .",
    "the nephelometer @xcite and the net flux radiometer @xcite both detected a cloud near the 1.2-bar level ( base near 1.35 bars ) at the edge of a hot spot , with roughly unit opacity at a wavelength of 5 .",
    "this pressure and optical depth are roughly comparable to that of the bottom cloud derived from several of the vims spectra , but there is not a good match to any obtained close to the probe entry latitude .",
    "this mismatch is not too surprising ; given the large size of the vims pixels and the small scale of a typical hot spot , a close agreement can not be expected .",
    "an additional cloud layer was detected indirectly .",
    "a cloud above the level at which probe measurements began ( 440 mb ) was inferred from net flux radiometer observations of spin - induced modulations of the direct solar beam signal at multiple wavelengths @xcite .",
    "the optical depth was estimated to be @xmath81.5 - 2 at a wavelength of 0.5 , and the particle size between 0.5 and 0.75 .",
    "this upper cloud seems reasonably consistent with our vims results for nearby latitudes ( 12x16y and 26x31y ) . as clouds close to this level",
    "are found throughout the equatorial zone , it is plausible that these might also be present at the edge or even over a hot spot .",
    "although we find a combination of small and large particles , their spectral effects on the solar beam intensity in the nfr passbands might be similar to those of a single population of particles of intermediate size .",
    "our lowest opacity model ( for the 12x16y spectrum ) has two contributions that would come from above the probe deployment level . at 2.0",
    "the layer has a small optical depth of 0.23 , which would not increase much at 0.5 because of the large particle size in this layer .",
    "the layer of -coated particles , with an optical depth of 0.37 at 2 , would provide most of the opacity at 0.5 , which could plausibly 4 - 5 times greater than its 2-value .",
    "this would yield a total 0.5-opacity comparable to the probe estimate , which is for a layer that does not vary much in optical depth for any of our spectral models , making it more likely that the probe comparison is a meaningful one .",
    "our vims model results also agree with a lack of cloud particles in the 700 mb region , and we do find lower cloud layers close to the probe cloud density maximum near 1.2 bars , although the optical depth we find there is generally much higher than obtained by the probe , which was in an unusually transparent region of the atmosphere .",
    "we do nt agree with the probe - derived ammonia profile however ; when we try to fit the least cloudy region ( 13x14y ) with that ammonia profile , the best fit @xmath10 value is nearly double what we obtained using either equatorial zone or neb ammonia profiles .",

    "we did scale the @xcite results from their 1-reference wavelength to our 2-reference using their derived particle radius profile and calculations of the wavelength dependence of mie scattering efficiency ( using their refractive index of 1.4 + 0i ) .",
    "we find a rough agreement on the fractional increase of opacity with depth and agreement on the pressure level of the local peak in opacity , but do nt agree well on the absolute values of opacity .",
    "our results contain several times as much optical depth as the obtained by @xcite , and disagree even more with the profile of @xcite , which has nearly an order of magnitude less opacity when scaled to a wavelength of 2 . at that wavelength",
    "it also disagrees with @xcite .",
    "a factor that might introduce disagreements with the nims analysis of @xcite and @xcite is the difference in treatments of absorption .",
    "@xcite show that prior ammonia absorption models provided too little absorption at 1.59 , 1.9 , and 2.3 . as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : profilespecs ] , variations in the amount of ammonia absorption have a significant impact on the i / f observed in the deeply penetrating windows at 1.28 and 1.59 , which provide important constraints on the vertical location of aerosols .",
    "likewise , variations in absorption models might affect the pressure derived from fitting the spectra .",
    "another difference that might affect the comparisons is that our fits result in different particle sizes , with the layer having much larger particles than were derived by @xcite .",
    "our and layers are made with refractive indexes of specific materials , while @xcite used conservative particles .",
    "have a strong influence on scaling results to other wavelengths .",
    "our results are also in partial agreement with results based on galileo solid state imager ( ssi ) observations .",
    "@xcite , who analyzed ssi data in three channels at 756 nm , 727 nm , and 889 nm , conclude that below an ubiquitous upper tropospheric haze , which exhibits little small scale variation , there is a highly variable cloud component ( 0 to 20 in optical depth ) , usually at p = 750@xmath12200 mb , less than a scale height in vertical extent , and the principal cause of features seen at red and longer wavelengths . at first , this appears to be in serious conflict with our vims results , but it is only the lower end of the pressure range that is most in conflict , as a comparison of cumulative opacities will soon demonstrate . the subsequent analysis by @xcite , reached similar conclusions , though somewhat less discrepant with near - ir results , specifically that a white cloud exists at pressures of 880 - 970 mb in belts and 620 - 720 mb in zones .",
    "these models use a relatively simple cloud structure with a small number of parameters , befitting the small number of spectral constraints provided by the observations .",
    "the structure consists of a stratospheric haze extending to a pressure that marks the top of the main cloud layer with a bottom pressure at which ( generally ) is located a physically thin sheet cloud .",
    "the main cloud is assumed to have the same scale height as the gas , leaving two pressures and three optical depths to be constrained by the models .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : simon ] we provide comparisons for a belt ( panel a ) and a zone ( panel b ) between our vims cumulative optical depths and those of @xcite and @xcite . here",
    "our vims - derived opacities are scaled to their wavelength of 0.75 .",
    "we scaled up the stratospheric haze opacity by a factor of 19 ( assuming a @xmath68 dependence ) and the layer near 300 mb by a factor of ten , which is appropriate for our composite particle with a radius of 0.3 .",
    "the bottom layer was scaled up by a factor of 2.67 , to account for the approximate @xmath69 dependence we inferred for that layer .",
    "the main 500 - 600 mb layer , was not scaled because its opacity is relatively flat for the best - fit particle sizes , although its reflectivity can increase significantly at shorter wavelengths due to its high real index and reduced absorption . at ssi wavelengths this layer appears to make a relatively small contribution compared to the layers surrounding it .    turning to the ssi - vims comparison itself , it is not surprising that our stratospheric haze opacity is much too high because of the excessive i / f values in the vims spectra near 2.3 . otherwise , there is gross agreement on the opacity levels deeper in the atmosphere . for the belt comparison ( panel a ) the cumulative opacity",
    "maximum is in close agreement with the @xcite result , while for the zone comparison ( panel b ) the best agreement is with the @xcite result , although there is a significant disagreement in the vertical location of the high - opacity bottom cloud .",
    "our vims analysis puts it close to 1.1 bars , while the ssi results place it closer to 700 mb .",
    "on the other hand , we do find a significant cloud layer close to 700 mb in this region , and perhaps with a different scaling from 2 to 0.75 the disagreement might be substantially reduced , suggesting that the particle size is smaller or the inferred wavelength dependence is greater than what we obtain from our best fit over the 1 - 3.2 region .",
    "another point worth remembering is that we are not comparing a large statistical sample , and some of the differences observed might be attributable to spatial and temporal variations . in the belt region , for example we obtain somewhat better agreement with the 25x35y spectrum . clearly , a larger sampling of variations would allow for a more meaningful comparison .",
    "features of the ssi analysis that might contribute the disagreement in bottom cloud locations include changes made in the methane absorption coefficients of @xcite , failing to include hydrogen collision - induced opacity from the third overtone band , which provides significant opacity in the 756-nm window , and uncertainties in the actual transmissions of the galileo ssi filters . according to @xcite ,",
    "the 756-nm absorption coefficient was increased by a factor of 10 and the 727-nm coefficient from 0.17 to 0.22 .",
    "the latest constraints on these coefficients , given by @xcite , have resulted in only a factor of two increase in the 756-nm coefficient and no change in the 727-nm coefficient .",
    "the two galileo ssi analyses thus place more absorption at higher altitudes than current best estimates would imply , and thus the pressures of the deeper cloud layers might be underestimated somewhat .",
    "particle size differences are also a potential source of disagreements on opacity .",

    "our results provide a weaker vertical opacity ( after smoothing ) , while the cirs analysis yields a very strong gradient .",

    "analysis might need to be revised to take account of scattering effects .",
    "the comparison might also be affected by local variations , and might be better if we had a larger statistical sample .",
    "it may also be a problem for one or the other analyses to obtain accurate results for regions with very high cloud opacity , since sensitivity beyond the first few optical depths is very diminished for both vims and cirs analyses .",
    "perhaps the greatest uncertainty in this comparison is associated with the uncertainty in how to scale the bottom cloud results to the same wavelength .",
    "currently we can only say that the two results might be consistent .",

    "perhaps the top layer of clouds is the small - particle component that displays these features , while the bulk of the cloud is larger particles that do nt show the features .",
    "we tried a number of models for the bottom cloud .",

    "this cloud might be composed of , but using that material in spherical particles degraded the fit quality .",
    "if we used a large number of quadrature points to capture the wavelength dependence of the phase function with higher accuracy , we found the details of that variation did not match the observations . on the other hand , if we used a small number of quadrature points to suppress the backscatter peak and its variations , this also made the lower cloud insufficiently bright , resulting in poor fits to the window regions .",
    "it appears that if is the main component of this cloud , it must have a lower imaginary index in the near - ir window regions , or have increased backscatter with a wavelength dependence different from that of spherical particles .",
    "there may also be accompanying variations in deeper regions of the atmosphere that are not constrained by the observations we used .      at first glance , a scenario",
    "in which provides the main component of cloud particles in vicinity of 500 mb seems implausible .",
    "such a scenario is certainly not consistent with a uniform upwelling in zones and descending air in belts , as commonly suggested in early studies of jovian dynamics ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "however , there is an observational conflict with that simple belt - zone dynamical model , namely the galileo discovery that most of the lightning occurs within belts , where air was thought to be descending , and is associated with rapidly growing cloud clusters reaching pressures of a few hundred millibars @xcite .",
    "these events would certainly dredge up condensible material from deeper levels , including , h@xmath11s , water , and likely particles of . if these events provided a major source of condensibles in the upper troposphere , then it is less difficult to understand how particles might contribute a major source of cloud material near 500 mb .",
    "the potentially important role of these thunderstorms in controlling the composition of the upper troposphere is also highlighted by @xcite , who provide a dynamical explanation for another non - intuitive observation , namely the global depletion of vapor between 500 mb and 5 bars in both belts and zones .",
    "their explanation is based on the idea `` ( 1 ) that the majority of air that ascends across the 5 bar interface resides in isolated thunderstorms , and ( 2 ) that 50% of the ammonia within these storms is lost through the 4 - 6 bar level either by direct ammonia rainout through the base of the storms or downward transport of ammonia vapor in convective downdrafts moistened by evaporation of rainfall . ''",
    "they speculate that `` air undergoing large scale ascent above the 0.5-bar cloud tops in zones is probably supplied horizontally from the belts ( where thunderstorms predominantly occur ) rather than from below . ''",
    "the belt - to - zone mass flux could be provided by eddies @xcite .",
    "it also seems plausible that during the strong convective events , composite particles could form , including ammonia - coated .",
    "when distributed horizontally , such particles would be mixed with less ammonia - rich air , promoting evaporation of the coating and leaving behind the core , which might also contain some component of h@xmath11o , although the vims spectra would not be consistent with a large fraction of water ice in such composite particles . a quantitative microphysical investigation of this scenario is needed to provide a better understanding of its plausibility .",
    "detections of spectral features near 10 @xmath0 m were first obtained by @xcite .",
    "they used the brightness temperature difference between 1040 and 1060 to measure the strength of the ammonia ice signature .",
    "this parameter peaked at the equator and at 23n , and was much more widely distributed than the very rare discrete ammonia ice clouds identified by @xcite , but was clearly not as omnipresent as the 3-absorption feature .",
    "they modeled their observations with 4:1 prolate spheroids of a volume equivalent radius of 0.79 , a cloud base of 790 mb , and extending up to 100 mb with a 1:1 particle to gas scale height , accompanied by a much more compact ( 1/8 the gas scale height ) gray absorber , which they modeled as 10-ice spheres . for average spectra from two regions ( 22 - 25n , covering 140 - 240w , and 14 - 17n , covering 10 - 70w ) they obtained for the small particle component optical depths of 0.75 and an upper limit of 0.2 respectively .",
    "the larger optical depth is likely roughly comparable to optical depths in the equatorial region where they also found a peak in the ice signature .",
    "although the vertical variation in opacity of the @xcite cloud models is not a good match to ours , the latitudinal variation in ammonia ice they infer is at least qualitatively consistent with our results in fig .",
    "[ fig : latvar ] . in our models",
    "the -containing layer descends from 400 mb to 600 mb from the equator to 14n .",
    "this change is especially relevant because of the @xcite conclusion that ammonia ice present deeper than 500 mb would not be detectable at 10 because it would be too far below the peak of the contribution function of the observations .",
    "this implies that their observations would detect much less in the neb .",
    "their broad vertical distribution of the small particle component for the cloudiest region , which should be similar to the equatorial region , would place about half its optical depth at pressures less than 450 mb , which would be about 0.38 extinction optical depths , comparable to what we would estimate for the layer of small ammonia - coated particles . their more compact cloud could easily be composed of .",
    "@xcite identified anomalous discrete cloud features in the wake of the grs , which they termed spectrally identifiable ammonia cloud ( siacs ) based on low reflectivity at 2.7 relative to high reflectivity at 1.6 , and a local dip in reflectivity at 2 relative to 1.94 , both depressions characteristic of ammonia ice absorption ( the longer wavelength absorption is only apparent in optically thick clouds , and not noticeable in fig.[fig : reflections ] ) .",
    "these features were observed in galileo nims spectra , taken at very high spatial resolution , and appear to occupy less than 1% of jupiter s cloud - top surface .",
    "the vims spectra we analyzed ( or any other vims spectra ) have far too low a spatial resolution to detect siacs .",
    "unlike siacs , the 3-absorption feature we analyzed appears to be very widely distributed on jupiter .",
    "although we focused on low - latitude spectra for detailed analysis in this paper , we did look at vims spectra over a wide range of latitudes and longitudes , and found obvious strong absorption at 3 everywhere we looked .",
    "the siacs appear to be the result of unusually strong localized vertical transport that causes significant condensation of ammonia vapor , such that the ammonia spectral features become significantly enhanced .",
    "it appears from our results , that most locations on jupiter do nt have very much condensed , so that the the spectral character of siacs is rarely observed .",
    "the alternative possibility that is in fact the major cloud component , but has its spectral signature significantly altered by some photochemical `` tanning '' process remains to be quantitatively investigated , and whether it could satisfy known spectral and photochemical constraints seems doubtful .",
    "saturn s near - ir spectrum does not contain the broad and strong 3-absorption feature so apparent in jupiter s spectrum @xcite . the stark difference between spectra of these two planets",
    "is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : saturn ] , where we compare a typical low - latitude saturn spectrum from vims data cube cm_1587635989 with a vims jupiter spectrum ( 12x16y ) .",
    "the high reflectance of saturn s clouds at 3.0 ( @xmath80.2 ) , just where jupiter s i / f is quite low ( @xmath80.02 ) , implies that the main cloud layer contributing to saturn s reflection spectrum in the near ir is not composed of medium sized pure ammonia ice particles ( nor particles ) .",
    "this is likely the layer of upper troposheric haze that @xcite found to extend from a base at 300 mb - 500 mb to a top near 40 mb - 80 mb , varying with latitude and season , but generally of substantial optical depth ( @xmath13 6 - 20 at @xmath81 ) , with a weak dependence on wavelength .",
    "this layer is probably thick enough at 3 to obscure the much deeper ammonia cloud thought to reside between 1.4 and 1.8 bars .     between 2.8 and 3.0 , but does not display the broad absorption from 3.0 to 3.2 that is characteristic of the typical jovian spectrum , such as the plotted 12x16y vims spectrum ( dashed ) .",
    "the cloud albedo ( dot - dash ) inferred by @xcite from analysis of a groundbased high - resolution spectrum contains a local absorption qualitatively consistent with a layer of small particles containing a minor fraction of ammonia ice , either as a core or coating .",
    "the vertical dotted line is at 2.965 .,width=336 ]    however , there is some evidence for at least a component of ammonia ice in saturn s tropospheric haze . from analysis of a high - resolution groundbased spectrum of saturn",
    ", @xcite developed evidence for a weak cloud absorption feature at 2.96 , where their inferred model cloud layer at 460 mb had its albedo drop by @xmath820% , which they suggested might be due to ammonia ice .",
    "a small absorption feature at the same wavelength is also seen in many spatially resolved vims spectra of saturn ( also evident in fig .",
    "[ fig : saturn ] ) , and is not a characteristic of the phosphine spectrum that provides the main absorption in this region .",
    "this very well may be due to a population of ammonia - coated particles within the main tropospheric haze layer of saturn .",
    "a small composite particle of this type with @xmath830% ammonia content , would lack the broad absorption feature of larger pure ammonia ice , and have a relatively narrow , but subdued , peak absorption displaced towards the ammonia imaginary index peak at 2.965 , as is shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : coatex ] .",
    "this shifted and attenuated feature could also be produced by particles with a small core of ammonia ice coated by a thick layer of hydrocarbons , as demonstrated by the benzene - coated example of @xcite .",
    "it seems likely , but remains to be demonstrated , that a moderately thick tropospheric haze containing a component of such particles could provide accurate fits to saturn s near - ir spectra .",
    "from an analysis of vims low and medium phase angle spatially resolved spectra obtained during the cassini 2000 flyby of jupiter , we obtained the following main conclusions regarding the vims instrument performance , the source of jupiter s 3-absorption , and jupiter s low - latitude cloud structure .    1 .   by comparing vims spectra with groundbased spectra , selected nicmos observations , and an iso spectrum",
    ", we were able to confirm that the vims absolute calibration is relatively consistent with other observations , but that vims measurements have two significant artifacts , one in the 1.60 - 1.68 region where a huge responsivity correction turns out to be insufficiently accurate , and the other is an excessively high i / f measurements at low signal levels , which caused model fits to yield stratospheric haze opacity @xmath810 times that derived from groundbased spectra .",
    "2 .   we found that vims spectra contain evidence for a prominent and widespread 3-absorber in jupiter s clouds and a much weaker absorber active near 2 .",
    "this was made obvious by reflecting layer fits constrained outside the absorbing region , which produce more than the observed reflectivity in the absorbing regions , by @xmath820% at 2.04 and by 300 - 500% at 3 - 3.1 .",
    "we were able to fit a low - opacity vims spectrum quite well using ice as the only 3-absorber , but were not able to fit very well the spectra from much cloudier regions , the main defect being an absorption feature near 2 in the model spectra that was much larger than observed .",
    "models with as the only absorber in a similar layer structure were more successful in fitting high opacity spectra and almost as good fitting low opacity spectra , the main defect being lack of a 2.97-spectral feature which appears to require a contribution from .",
    "the best fits to vims spectra were obtained with both and absorbers present in jupiter s clouds , but the contribution appears to help most in the form of a coating or as a core material comprising less than half the total particle volume .",
    "we roughly simulated -coated particles using a synthetic refractive index with absorption similar to that of but significantly weaker .",
    "a layer of these small ( r@xmath80.3 ) particles above a layer of much larger ( r@xmath810 ) particles provided the best fits to all the spectra . the -coated cloud layer ( modeled as physically thin but ranging from 330 to 550 mb )",
    "was found to have the least variability in optical depth among the eight low latitude spectra , with an average of 0.38 and a standard deviation of only 0.05 .",
    "the main 3-absorbing layer varies in optical depth from 0.23 to 2.1 , a factor of nine , with pressures ranging from 358 to 635 mb . in most cases",
    "the -containing layer was found in such close proximity to the layer that they could be intermingled .",
    "a caveat in these results is that the simulation of the -coated particle does not closely follow the size and wavelength dependence of a true -coated particle , and thus some other structure may be required to provide physically consistent fits .",
    "comparison with galileo probe results provided crude agreement on the vertical location of clouds , the upper level cloud opacity , the pressure of the lower cloud , and the relative lack of cloud particles near 700 mb , but did not agree with the nfr - derived vertical profile of .",
    "comparison with the analysis of galileo nims observations by @xcite shows a rough agreement with the vertical trend of opacity and the location of the peaks in opacity , but we find greater absolute opacity values . we can not confirm ( or rule out ) the large belt - zone differences they found in the 1.5 - 2 bar region . when the results of @xcite , which apply to belt regions , are scaled to 2 , there is an even larger discrepancy than with @xcite . 7 .",
    "comparison of our results scaled to a wavelength of 0.75 with galileo ssi results by @xcite and @xcite finds reasonable agreement with cumulative opacity profiles , with the exception of the location of the lower high - opacity cloud in zone models , which the ssi analysis places near 700 mb and our analysis places near 1100 mb .",
    "comparison of our absorption profiles with the analysis of cassini cirs observations by @xcite , with plausible scalings with wavelength , reveals a rough agreement , but with cirs opacities less than ours by a factor of two or more .",
    "however , the validity of the comparison is uncertain because of the large uncertainty in appropriate scaling factors to use for the lower cloud .",
    "the presence of a layer of sub - micron ice coated particles at pressures of 300 - 500 mb does not appear to conflict with thermal spectra in the 9 - 10 region , where only a weak ammonia signature is observed .",
    "this is possible because the coated particle can produce the reflective contribution needed to match the near - ir spectra , but ten times less extinction optical depth at 9.4 than would be obtained from pure particles of the same size .",
    "our estimated extinction optical depth for this layer is crudely compatible with the optical depth estimate of @xcite in the latitude band we analyzed .",
    "the increased pressure we find for the layer in the neb is qualitatively consistent with the low signature found by wong et al . in a similar region .",
    "saturn s spectra do not exhibit the broad 3-absorption feature characteristic of jovian spectra , perhaps because the cloud layer containing that absorber is obscured by the moderately thick tropospheric haze that overlies it .",
    "however , saturn spectra do exhibit a small absorption feature near 2.965 , which is qualitatively consistent with absorption when diluted by combining with a substantial conservative core or shell .",

    "<S> although these fits put nh@xmath4 ice at pressures less than 500 mb , this is not inconsistent with the lack of prominent features in jupiter s longwave spectrum because the reflectivity of the core particles strongly suppresses the absorption features , at both near - ir and thermal wavelengths . </S>",
