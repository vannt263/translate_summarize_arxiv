    "the discovery of the higgs boson@xcite and measurements of its properties@xcite at the lhc provide us a clue to explore the essence of electroweak symmetry breaking , which is possibly described by new physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) at the tev scale . on the other hand , new physics",
    "is required to explain phenomena such as neutrino oscillation , existence of dark matter ( dm ) and baryon asymmetry of the universe ( bau ) .",
    "if the origins of these phenomena are related to the essence of the higgs sector , they should also arise from new physics at the tev scale . in such cases ,",
    "their origins can be found at current and future collider experiments .",
    "for example , let us consider the scenario of generating neutrino masses by the quantum effect@xcite , in which tiny neutrino masses are explained by perturbation of the dynamics at the tev scale .",
    "there is a class of models with right - handed ( rh ) neutrinos which are assigned the odd - parity under an additional @xmath2 symmetry@xcite .",
    "the @xmath2 symmetry forces the neutrino masses to be generated only at the quantum level , giving loop suppression to the neutrino masses .",
    "also , the lightest @xmath2-odd particle can be a dm candidate if the @xmath2 symmetry is unbroken .",
    "we call such scenarios as radiative seesaw scenarios",
    ". the ma model is the simplest one in such a scenario , in which neutrino masses are generated at the one - loop level by the contribution of an extra @xmath2-odd @xmath3 scalar doublet ( inert doublet ) and @xmath2-odd rh neutrinos@xcite .",
    "a neutral component of the inert doublet field or the lightest rh neutrino can be the dm .",
    "on the other hand , in the aoki - kanemura - seto model ( the aks model)@xcite , where @xmath2-odd charged and neutral singlet scalars as well as @xmath2-odd rh neutrinos are added to a two higgs doublet model , neutrino masses are induced at the three - loop level and at the same time the lightest @xmath2-odd particle ( the @xmath2-odd neutral singlet or the rh neutrino ) can be the dm .",
    "in addition , in this model , electroweak baryogenesis can be simultaneously realized due to strong first - order electroweak phase transition(1stopt ) and the cp violating phases in the higgs sector@xcite .",
    "these models of radiative seesaw scenarios have been introduced as purely phenomenological models .",
    "for example , in the aks model , some of the coupling constants in the higgs sector and the new yukawa coupling constants for the rh neutrinos are of order one in order to satisfy the condition of strong 1stopt and also to reproduce the neutrino data .",
    "consequently , these coupling constants blow up as the energy scale increases and the landau pole appears at the point much below the planck scale or the gut scale , and the model is well - defined only below the landau pole@xcite .",
    "this suggests that the model is a low energy effective description of a more fundamental theory above the cutoff scale which corresponds to the landau pole .",
    "it is then a very interesting question what kind of a fundamental theory can lead to such a low energy effective theory .    in this paper",
    ", we propose a concrete model of the fundamental theory whose low - energy description gives a phenomenological model@xcite of radiative seesaw scenarios with electroweak baryogenesis . in this model ,",
    "the origin of the higgs force above the cutoff scale of the low energy theory is a new gauge interaction with asymptotic freedom . in order to describe this picture",
    ", we consider the supersymmetric ( susy ) su(@xmath4 ) theory with @xmath5 flavors@xcite . for @xmath6",
    ", confinement occurs at an infrared ( ir ) scale @xmath7@xcite .",
    "we here consider the simplest case with @xmath0 and @xmath1 doublet and one singlet higgs superfields appear as composite states of fundamental superfields of the @xmath8 gauge symmetry , corresponding to the field content of the nearly - minimal susy sm ( nmssm)@xcite . ] . in the low - energy effective theory below the confinement scale @xmath7 ,",
    "higgs superfields @xmath9 appear as the composite states of the fundamental superfields @xmath10 which are doublets of the @xmath8 gauge symmetry@xcite . in order to realize radiative seesaw scenarios in the low - energy effective theory , we add elementary rh neutrino superfields @xmath11 ) to the model .",
    "we further impose a @xmath2 symmetry to the model assuming that @xmath12 and some of @xmath13 s are @xmath2-odd .",
    "below the confinement scale , the symmetries of the model are @xmath14 , under which fifteen higgs superfields appear@xcite .",
    "all the scalar particles required in the aks model are included in these fifteen higgs superfields .",
    "it is quite interesting that the complicated particle content of the aks model is predicted by this @xmath15 theory above the cutoff scale without any artificial assumption .",
    "the condition of strongly 1stopt , @xmath16 , which is required for successful electroweak baryogenesis determines the size of the coupling constants of the higgs potential at the electroweak scale .",
    "this property commonly results in the enhanced triple higgs boson constant  @xcite .",
    "the electroweak baryogenesis scenario can partially be tested by measuring the triple higgs boson coupling at future collider experiments . by the renormalization group equation ( rge )",
    "analysis of the coupling constant , the scale of the landau pole is evaluated as @xmath17@xcite , which is identical to the confinement scale @xmath7 under the na@xmath18ve dimensional analysis ( nda)@xcite .    in our model ,",
    "the lightest @xmath2-odd particle in the effective theory can be a dm candidate as in usual radiative seesaw scenarios .",
    "if the @xmath19-parity is also imposed , there are two discrete symmetries , and a rich possibility for the multi - component dm scenario occurs@xcite . in this paper , however , we do not specify the scenario of dm . detailed analysis for the multi - component dm scenario",
    "will be performed in our model elsewhere@xcite .",
    "we show that the neutrino masses are generated at the loop level in the low - energy effective theory of our model .",
    "it contains diagrams of both the ma model and the aks model .",
    "we find benchmark points in the parameter space where all the current experimental data for higgs bosons , neutrino data , constraints of lepton flavor violation processes and the condition of strongly 1stopt are satisfied .",
    "we also discuss the possibility of testing this model at current and future collider experiments .",
    "in this section , we will briefly review a susy model with @xmath20 symmetry and six chiral superfields , denoted by @xmath21 , which are doublets of the @xmath8 gauge symmetry .",
    "the superfields @xmath13 s are also charged under the sm gauge groups @xmath22 .",
    "the sm charges and @xmath2 parity assignments on @xmath13 s are given in table  [ tfields ] .    .",
    "the sm charges and @xmath2 parity assignments on the @xmath8 doublets @xmath13 .",
    "[ tfields ] [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     we have found that the benchmark points defined in table  [ tab : bench ] can reproduce the correct values of neutrino masses and mixing angles with satisfying the constraint from lepton flavor violations and with keeping strong enough 1stopt for electroweak baryogenesis .      in this paper , we do not perform any complete analysis of specific collider signals .",
    "we here give some comments , and detailed analysis of collider signatures in our model will be discussed elsewhere .      as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , in the parameter region where 1stopt becomes strong enough for successful electroweak baryogenesis , the non - decoupling effect gives significant contributions to higgs couplings such as the @xmath23 coupling and the @xmath24 coupling .",
    "the direction of deviations for these coupling constants are related to each other .",
    "both couplings can deviate as large as @xmath25% from the sm predictions , which can be tested by future collider experiments . at the lhc",
    ", the branching ratio of higgs to diphoton process will be measured at about 20% accuracy , but the measurement of triple higgs boson coupling is very challenging . at the hl - lhc with the luminosity of 3000@xmath26 , @xmath27 will be measured with 10% accuracy@xcite .",
    "the triple higgs boson coupling can be measured at the hl - lhc and much better at the ilc .",
    "it is expected that the @xmath23 coupling can be measured with the accuracy of about 20% or better at the ilc with @xmath28tev with 2ab@xmath29@xcite .",
    "there are many extra fields which can provide collider signals in our model .",
    "the @xmath2-even sector of our model is essentially same as the nmssm .",
    "therefore we can expect that the collider signals relevant to the @xmath2-even particles are same as them in the nmssm which are studied in the literature@xcite .",
    "our model is characterized by the @xmath2-odd sector , so that the collider signals in this sector are very important . in the case ( a ) of our benchmark points , inert doublet - like scalars are light .",
    "collider signatures of the inert doublet scalars have been studied in the literature@xcite .",
    "the inert doublet scalars are color singlet particles , then it is not easy to discover them at the lhc .",
    "even though they can be fortunately discovered at the lhc , precise determination of their masses and quantum numbers are challenging@xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the ilc is a very powerful tool to study such non - colored inert doublet particles . at the ilc",
    ", the mass of charged inert scalar can be measured in a few gev accuracy , and the mass of neutral inert scalar can be measured in better than 2gev accuracy@xcite .    in the case",
    "( b ) , the @xmath2-odd singlet - like charged particle is required to be light . as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , such the light singlet - like charged particle can be studied at the ilc via the pair production such as @xmath30 .",
    "furthermore , due to the interaction of @xmath31 , the production process such as @xmath32 is possible .",
    "this process will be a strong evidence of three - loop neutrino mass generation mechanism@xcite .",
    "the process can be detected at the @xmath33 collision option of the ilc or the clic@xcite .",
    "in addition , the susy extended higgs sector of this model includes several color singlet susy partner fermions of the extra scalars .",
    "if such susy partner particles are discovered , it discriminates our model from non - susy models with radiative seesaw scenarios .        for baryogenesis",
    ", we focus on the strength of 1stopt which gives a necessary condition for successful electroweak baryogenesis , and we have not numerically evaluated the prediction on the bau in our scenario . in order to complete the numerical evaluation of the bau , we should also take care of the cp phases .",
    "since it is known that the cp violation in the sm is too small for getting the enough large bau@xcite , extra cp phases are also required in addition to the mechanism to enhance 1stopt . in susy models ,",
    "new sources of the cp violation which can contribute to the generation of the bau can be introduced@xcite . in the literature@xcite , numerical evaluation of the bau due to the electroweak baryogenesis in the mssm",
    "is discussed . in principle",
    ", we can introduce the cp phases to the model in the similar ways as the works mentioned above .",
    "we then expect to obtain sufficient amount of bau , once the strong enough 1stopt is realized .",
    "this model includes an unbroken @xmath2 parity , which provides dm candidates .",
    "since the @xmath2-odd extra fields except for the rh neutrino have quite strong coupling with the higgs bosons , they conflict with the bounds from direct detection experiments of the dm . we choose the both benchmark points in such a way that the lightest @xmath2-odd particle is the rh neutrino and/or the rh sneutrino . if the @xmath19 parity is also imposed , the lightest susy particle also qualifies as the dm candidate .",
    "it leads to a rich possibility of the multi - component dm scenario@xcite . in this paper",
    "we do not specify the scenario of dm .",
    "detailed analysis of the relic abundance and the direct detection constraints are performed elsewhere .      due to the non - renormalization theorem , the neutrino masses are not generated supersymmetric ; _ i.e. _ , soft susy breaking terms are necessary for loop induced neutrino mass models . in our model , susy breaking terms in the last line of eq .",
    "( [ eq : softbrreakingterms ] ) are essential .",
    "these terms are not forbidden by the gauge symmetry , but no relevant terms are in the superpotential given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : superpotentialweff ] ) .",
    "it may suggest a specific mediation mechanism for the susy breaking .",
    "it is a quite interesting point that the neutrino mass generation is a key to explore the mediation mechanism of susy breaking in our model .",
    "we have considered a model based on the susy gauge theory with @xmath0 and @xmath1 with an additional exact @xmath2 symmetry . by adding @xmath2-odd rh neutrinos to the model",
    ", we have proposed a concrete model which can be a fundamental theory of a low energy effective theory with radiative seesaw scenarios and with strong 1stopt .",
    "we have shown that radiative seesaw scenarios can be realized in our model and there can be two types of contributions to the neutrino mass matrix ; _ i.e. _ , by one - loop diagrams and also by three - loop diagrams .",
    "these contributions correspond to the susy versions of the ma model and the aks model , respectively .",
    "we have also found out the benchmark point for each contributions , where the neutrino oscillation data are correctly reproduced with satisfying the condition of strong 1stopt and with satisfying the current experimental constraints .",
    "our model is a candidate of the fundamental theory whose low energy effective theory provides solutions to three serious problems in the sm ; _ i.e. _ , neutrino mass , dm and baryogenesis by physics at the tev scale .",

    "<S> in a class of supersymmetric gauge theories with asymptotic freedom , the low energy effective theory below the confinement scale is described by the composite superfields of the fundamental representation fields . </S>",
    "<S> based on the supersymmetric gauge theory with @xmath0 and @xmath1 with an additional unbroken @xmath2 symmetry , we propose a new model where neutrino masses , dark matter , and baryon asymmetry of the universe can be simultaneously explained by physics below the confinement scale . </S>",
    "<S> this is an example for the ultraviolet complete supersymmetric extension of so - called radiative seesaw scenarios with first - order phase transition required for successful electroweak baryogenesis . </S>",
    "<S> we show that there are benchmark points where all the neutrino data , the lepton flavor violation data , and the lhc data are satisfied . </S>",
    "<S> we also briefly discuss higgs phenomenology in this model . </S>"
