    "a _ mass _ in our sense is a finite measure on the borel @xmath5-algebra on  @xmath2 for which hyperplanes are zero - sets .",

    "a triple of positive integers @xmath0 is _ admissible _ if for any @xmath1 given masses in @xmath2 there exist @xmath3 hyperplanes that cut each of these masses into @xmath4 equal pieces .",
    "the famous ham sandwich theorem states that @xmath6 is admissible , which is due to banach @xcite .",
    "the problem of finding other admissible tripes arose in the sixties .",
    "grnbaum @xcite asked which triples of the form @xmath7 are admissible , and hadwiger @xcite showed the admissibility of the triples @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "the general problem was posed by ramos @xcite .",
    "it admits interesting topological approaches , see e. g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , ( * ? ? ?",
    "it is seen as one of the prime model problems for equivariant algebraic topology ; compare ( * ? ? ?",
    "if @xmath0 is admissible then so is @xmath10 : project the masses from @xmath11 to @xmath2 , find cutting hyperplanes , and take their pre - image under the projection .",
    "hence , let @xmath12 be the smallest dimension @xmath13 such that @xmath0 is admissible .",
    "the famous ham sandwich theorem states @xmath14 .    here",
    "we present a new reduction , lemma [ lemmasspartinductiononmfordelta ] .",
    "the idea of the following lemma [ lemmasspartinductiononhfordelta ] was already used by hadwiger @xcite and by ramos @xcite .",
    "[ lemmasspartinductiononhfordelta ] @xmath15 , for all @xmath16 , @xmath17 .",
    "that is , if @xmath18 is admissible then so is @xmath0 .",
    "suppose that @xmath18 is admissible and we are given @xmath1 masses in @xmath2 .",
    "we can first bisect them with one hyperplane using the ham sandwich theorem , since @xmath19 .",
    "the resulting @xmath20 masses can then be cut into equal parts using @xmath21 further hyperplanes , by the definition of @xmath22",
    ".    the next reduction will give new admissible triples .",
    "[ lemmasspartinductiononmfordelta ] @xmath23 , for all @xmath24 .",

    "assume we are given @xmath1 masses in @xmath26 , which is embedded in @xmath27 with last coordinate equal to zero .",
    "add a ball with radius @xmath28 at the point @xmath29 and view it as another mass .",
    "thicken the first @xmath1 masses by an @xmath30 into the direction of the last coordinate , such that they are now actually masses in @xmath27 ( the thickened masses have in fact the property that hyperplanes are zero - sets ) .     + an example for @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "we then find an equipartition of the @xmath33 masses by @xmath3 hyperplanes .",
    "all of the hyperplanes go through the point @xmath34 , therefore they intersect @xmath26 in hyperplanes of @xmath26 .",
    "these yield an equipartition of the given @xmath1 masses up to a small error which depends on the chosen @xmath35 .",
    "a limit argument finishes the proof ( take a convergent subsequence ) .",
    "e. ramos @xcite has shown among other things the following inequalities ( @xmath36 ) : @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 .",
    "note that the factors in front of @xmath42 are of the form @xmath43 , except for @xmath44 it is @xmath45 .",
    "his formula @xmath41 gives together with the above lemmas new admissible triples .",
    "[ cornewresults ] let @xmath46 , @xmath47 and write @xmath48 @xmath49 .",

    "we note that ramos mentioned results together with the above reduction lemmas give all known admissible triples , except for one , @xmath51 , which is due to mani - levitska , vreica , and ivaljevi @xcite .",
