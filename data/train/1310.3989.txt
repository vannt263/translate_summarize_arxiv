    "an inflationary stage in the early time evolution of the universe can address successfully at least some of the problems of the standard big bang cosmology such as the flatness , horizon and relics problems .",
    "the simplest inflationary scenario , is the one in which the universe is dominated with a single scalar field whose potential energy dominates over the kinetic term  @xcite .",
    "another important property of the inflationary paradigm is that , it provides a causal mechanism for production of density perturbations needed to seed the formation of structures in the universe . in a single field inflationary scenario , the dominant mode of the primordial density fluctuations",
    "is predicted to be adiabatic and gaussian to a very good approximation  @xcite .",
    "but , many inflationary models predict a level of non - gaussianity which is detectable by current experiments  @xcite . also , any footprint of the non - gaussianity in observations carries a large amount of information on the cosmological dynamics which derived the inflationary expansion of the universe  @xcite .",
    "while the evolution of the primordial fluctuations during inflation is usually studied within the linear theory , to explore the non - gaussianity of the density perturbation one has to go beyond the linear theory .",
    "in fact , one has to study the three - point correlation function of the scalar perturbations or its fourier transform called the bispectrum . for a gaussian signal",
    ", all odd @xmath0-point correlation functions are vanishing .",
    "also , the higher even @xmath0-point correlators are given in terms of the sums of the products of the two - point functions .",
    "so , in order to look for a departure from gaussianity we should look for a non - zero three - point correlation functions . to study the three - point correlation functions , it is required a perturbative treatment up to the second order  @xcite .",
    "so , a non - gaussian distribution of the perturbations implies non - linearity in the cosmological perturbations .",
    "a three - point correlation function , in the fourier space , depends on the three momenta or wave numbers ( @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 ) .",
    "because of the translation invariance , these momenta add up to zero ( @xmath4 ) and thus form a triangle .",
    "also , the rotational invariance implies that the three - point correlation function depends on the three independent scalar products of these momenta ( or the shape of the triangle )  @xcite .",
    "it is believed that einstein gravity is a low - energy limit of a quantum theory of gravity .",
    "string theory is the leading candidate for quantum gravity .",
    "this theory suggests that to have a ghost - free action , quadratic curvature corrections to the einstein - hilbert action is proportional to the gauss - bonnet term ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "such term plays a significant role in the early time universe dynamics  @xcite .",
    "however it turns out that this term makes no contribution in the equation for dimension @xmath6 .",
    "but , any coupling between a scalar field and the gauss - bonnet term makes the gauss - bonnet term effective even in four dimension @xcite . for higher dimensional extensions",
    "see for instance  @xcite .",
    "there is another proposal in the string theory that has attracted much attention over the past years . in this proposal ( which is based on the dirac - born - infeld ( dbi ) action  @xcite ) , the inflaton field is identified with radial coordinate ( position ) of a d3 brane moving in a  throat \" region of a warped compactified space with a speed limit imposed upon its motion , affected by both its speed and the warp factor of the throat ( often assumed an @xmath7 throat ) .",
    "the effective action in this model involves a non - standard kinetic term and a function of the scalar field besides the potential which is related to the local geometry of the compact manifold traversed by the d3-brane @xcite .",
    "an interesting phenomenological feature of the dbi inflation is that it leads to the non - gaussian signatures in the cosmic microwave background  @xcite .",
    "based on these preliminaries , in this paper we consider a gauss - bonnet term in the action that is non - minimally coupled to the dbi field . after obtaining the main equations of the model , we study cosmological inflation and the primordial perturbations with details in this setup .",
    "also , the issue of non - gaussianity of the perturbations will be considered and the amplitude of the non - gaussianity in the equilateral and orthogonal configuration will be calculated .",
    "finally we perform a comparison between the inflationary parameters and the joint planck+wmap9+bao data @xcite . by this comparison",
    "we find some constraint on the gauss - bonnet coupling parameter @xmath8 .",

    "since the dbi field is non - minimally coupled to the gauss - bonnet term , the perturbations are expected to be non - adiabatic . to explore the first order cosmological perturbation ( linear perturbation )",

    "@xmath76 is constant if the pressure perturbation is adiabatic on the large scales . in our setup , since the non - adiabatic perturbation is expected , the curvature perturbation would vary with time .    in general , the pressure perturbation ( in any gauge )",
