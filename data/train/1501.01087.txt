    "synchronization of self - sustained oscillators @xcite is crucial in many systems , including cardiac cells @xcite , circadian clock cells @xcite , and power grids @xcite . these systems are inevitably subject to various kinds of perturbations such as inherent noise , inhomogeneity and environmental changes , and therefore coupling of such oscillators needs to be strong enough to overcome the effect of these disturbances and ensure synchronization .    it is known that strong coupling can be a source of instabilities including oscillation death @xcite and chaotic dynamics @xcite .",
    "however , many of previous studies on coupled oscillators in the presence of noise focus on the competition of coupling and noise @xcite , where coupling is expected to suppress noise , leading to fast and stable synchronization .    in this paper",
    ", we present a new synchronization - breaking scenario which can occur in the strong coupling regime .",
    "naturally , synchronization does not occur for too weak coupling because of the effect of noise .",
    "we find that , in addition to this trivial desynchronization , synchronization is disrupted also for too strong coupling .",
    "such a reentrant transition occurs even with very weak noise .",
    "we elucidate the condition and mechanism of this reentrant synchronization through the analysis of a phase oscillator model .",
    "furthermore , we verify that the same reentrant transition occurs in limit - cycle oscillators by using the brusselator model and confirm the validity of our theory .",
    "our study demonstrates that the reentrant transition appears quite generally in coupled noisy oscillators .",
    "we consider the following phase oscillator that is subject to noise and is influenced by a noise - free pacemaker : @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the phase , @xmath2 and @xmath3 are the frequency of the oscillator and the pacemaker , respectively , and @xmath4 is a gaussian white noise satisfying @xmath5 .",
    "interaction is determined by @xmath6-periodic functions @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "a large class of limit - cycle oscillator models can be reduced to this model when the stability of a limit - cycle oscillator is high enough compared to noise and coupling strengths @xcite . here",
    "we adopt the following simple functions : @xmath9 with a parameter @xmath10 .",
    "below we mostly consider the case @xmath11 .",
    "let us first examine the averaged dynamics .",
    "when the coupling strength @xmath12 and the noise strength @xmath13 are sufficiently small compared to @xmath2 , eq . is well approximated by an averaged phase model .",
    "when @xmath14 , the phase difference @xmath15 obeys @xmath16 where the interaction function @xmath17 is obtained as @xcite @xmath18 the present choice of @xmath19 and @xmath20 yields a sakaguchi - kuramoto type interaction function @xcite @xmath21 in the absence of noise , the state @xmath22 is stable when @xmath23 is negative , i.e. , @xmath24 , which we always consider in the present paper .",
    "it is convenient to rewrite eq . as @xmath25 where",
    "the potential @xmath26 is given by @xmath27 if @xmath28 , the phase difference @xmath29 tends to stay around the potential minima , and occasionally jumps to the two adjacent minima , driven by noise .",
    "if @xmath30 , the right and the left potential barriers are the same height , and no net drift appears . on the other hand , if @xmath31 , the imbalance of the two barriers causes nonzero drift in the positive direction for @xmath32 , or in the negative direction for @xmath33 .",
    "the rate of phase slip is well approximated by kramers formula @xcite : given a barrier height @xmath34 , the rate of overcoming the barrier is proportional to @xmath35 .",
    "since the difference between the right and the left barriers is @xmath36 , the net jump rate is proportional to @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the height of the left barrier .",
    "that is , in the averaged dynamics , the rate of phase slip decreases exponentially as @xmath39 increases , with its direction determined by the sign of @xmath10 , and no reentrant transition occurs .      when @xmath39 or @xmath13 is not sufficiently smaller than @xmath2 , the averaging is no longer valid . in this case",
    ", the situation changes drastically . to see this",
    ", we numerically solve eq .",
    "( [ eq : phase ] ) . the frequency @xmath2 can be set to unity without loss of generality .",
    "figure [ fig : phase_diag](a ) shows three types of behavior for different values of @xmath39 with @xmath40 and @xmath30 : for @xmath41 , the system is dominated by noise ( incoherent region ) .",
    "synchronization is observed when @xmath39 is increased to @xmath42 .",
    "however , as we further increase @xmath39 up to @xmath43 , synchronization is disturbed by a jump of the phase difference by @xmath44 ( i.e. , a phase slip ) .",
    "measuring the rate of phase slip events against @xmath39 and @xmath13 for different values of @xmath10 , we observe the reentrant transition from the synchronized state to the phase slip state [ fig.[fig : phase_diag](b ) ] .",
    "the critical value of @xmath39 for this transition decreases as @xmath13 increases .",
    "unidirectionality of the slips is seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : phase_diag](c ) . here , for each @xmath39 and @xmath13 , we plot @xmath45 , where @xmath46 and @xmath47 are the number of slips in the positive and the negative directions , respectively , and @xmath48 is inserted to circumvent zero division . in the incoherent region ,",
    "the slip direction and frequency is determined by the sign of @xmath10 , reflecting the drifting force @xmath49 appearing in the averaged dynamics . on the other hand , in the reentrant region ,",
    "the slip direction is negative for all @xmath10 values , implying that the phase slip in the non - averaged dynamics is qualitatively different from that in the averaged dynamics .",
    "the local stability analysis can not explain the reentrant transition .",
    "linearizing eq . around the synchronized state @xmath50 with @xmath51 yields @xmath52 where @xmath53 .",
    "the linear stability of the state @xmath22 is determined by the time average of @xmath54 , i.e. , @xmath55 , which is the same as the stablity in the averaged model .",
    "the state @xmath22 is thus linearly stable for @xmath56 .",
    "however , it should be noted that @xmath54 can be negative for some range of time even when its time average is positive .",
    "hence it seems likely that the system is more easily destabilized in the non - averaging model than the averaging one .",
    "nevertheless , the reentrant transition is observed even when there is no time interval for the coefficient to be negative .",
    "in fact , considering the case @xmath30 , where @xmath57 , the synchronized state is never destabilized at any time , which suggests that nonlinearity is responsible for the reentrant transition .        to understand the global structure of the system , we again utilize a potential description .",
    "equation can be rewritten as @xmath58 where @xmath59 note that the potential @xmath60 is now time dependent . in general , @xmath60 is a 2@xmath61-periodic function in @xmath62 .",
    "choosing @xmath19 and @xmath20 as in eq . , @xmath26 is @xmath61-periodic in @xmath62 .",
    "figure [ fig : potential ] shows the space - time plot of @xmath60 for @xmath30 .",
    "it is clearly seen that , in addition to the minimum @xmath22 , which exists in the case of the averaged dynamics as well , there is another minimum traveling in the negative direction of @xmath29 .",
    "one can easily confirm that @xmath60 has the traveling minimum @xmath63 and the two maxima @xmath64 and @xmath65 .",
    "it is expected that , in the non - averaged dynamics , phase slip occurs along this traveling minimum .",
    "the potential is not tilted if @xmath30 , and tilted if @xmath66 .",
    "since the former is easier to analyze , below we first present our analysis for @xmath30 , and then extend the analysis to the case @xmath66 .      the mechanism and condition of the phase slip",
    "can be understood through the analysis of the following fokker - planck equation : @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the probability distribution function for the phase difference @xmath29 . by numerically solving eq . with eq . for @xmath30",
    ", we obtain time evolution of @xmath68 .",
    "figure [ fig : snapshots](a ) shows @xmath68 together with the trajectories of the extrema of @xmath60 .",
    "note that , for @xmath30 , three of them cross each other at the same time . when the coupling is sufficiently large , @xmath69 splits into two components at some moment , one localized at @xmath22 corresponding to the synchronized state , and the other traveling along @xmath63 , which corresponds to the phase slip state .",
    "this traveling component appears only for sufficiently strong coupling , although the distribution around @xmath22 is sharper for stronger coupling [ fig.[fig : snapshots](b),(c ) ] .",

    "the scenario of how the traveling component emerges is as follows .",
    "let us focus on a short time interval around @xmath74 .",
    "when @xmath76 , @xmath69 is localized at @xmath22 . at @xmath74 , the three extrema of @xmath26",
    "cross each other [ fig .",
    "[ fig : snapshots](a ) ] . around this time , the curvature of the potential at @xmath22 almost vanishes , and hence the diffusion dominates the dynamics .",
    "then , for @xmath77 , a potential maximum located at @xmath78 gradually grows , and , at some time @xmath79 the drift force caused by the potential becomes comparable to the effect of diffusion .",
    "at this moment , the part of @xmath68 located beyond the maximum ( i.e. , @xmath80 ) is separated from the component around @xmath22 and thus conveyed with the potential minimum located at @xmath63 .",
    "this process repeats itself with period @xmath61 .",
    "we can roughly estimate the above @xmath79 and the transition line through a dimensional analysis .",
    "first , @xmath79 is determined by balancing the drift and the diffusion terms in eq .",
    "evaluated at the potential maximum @xmath78 : @xmath81 because diffusion is dominant for @xmath82 , the width of @xmath69 grows roughly as @xmath83 within this duration .",
    "if this width is comparable to distance to the potential maximum at @xmath84 , i.e. , @xmath85 a substantial part of @xmath69 will be conveyed . from eqs . and , and noting that the potential height for small @xmath86 is @xmath87 , we obtain the following scaling relation : @xmath88 by substituting eq .   into eq .",
    ", we obtain the relationship between @xmath39 and @xmath79 : @xmath89 the reason why stronger coupling induces more phase slips is now clear : since larger coupling strength @xmath39 implies smaller @xmath79 , the condition @xmath90 is easier to satisfy .      in the case of small but nonzero @xmath91 ,",
    "where the three extrema cross each other at different timings , a similar argument can still be made to obtain the transition lines : if @xmath33 , @xmath22 becomes unstable when @xmath92 crosses 0 at @xmath74 .",
    "on the other hand , if @xmath32 , @xmath22 loses its stability at @xmath93 , when @xmath94 crosses @xmath22 . in both cases ,",
    "the potential barrier is located at @xmath95 .",
    "these situations are schematically shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : schematic ] .",
    "hence , instead of eq .",
    ", we have different balance equations @xmath96 ( @xmath97 ) and @xmath98 ( @xmath32 ) , where a parameter @xmath99 has been introduced .",
    "the transition line is thus obtained by eliminating @xmath79 from the following equations : @xmath100 substituting @xmath30 obviously reproduces eqs . and .",

    "[ fig : phase_diag](b ) , although for @xmath103 it slightly deviates from the numerical data particularly for large @xmath39 .",

    "solid ( dotted ) lines correspond to minima ( maxima ) of the potential @xmath60 . ]",
    "we can further extend our scaling argument for @xmath30 to the case @xmath104 . since the frequency difference @xmath105 serves as a drifting force , eq .",
    "is now modified as @xmath106 where @xmath107 is another parameter .",
    "combining eq .",
    "with eq . , we obtain @xmath108 figure [ fig : freq_diff](a ) shows the phase slip rates for different values of @xmath109 . rescaling according to eq .",
    "results in the collapse of data points [ fig.[fig : freq_diff](b ) ] , which strongly supports the validity of our theory .     for different @xmath110 , with @xmath111 , @xmath30 and @xmath112 .",

    "we have studied the non - averaged phase model using a specific form of @xmath19 and @xmath20 as in eq .. now let us consider reentrant transition in more general settings . for simplicity , we again focus on the case @xmath11 . as we have observed above",
    ", the extrema of the potential @xmath60 , which are given by zeroes of @xmath115 and @xmath116 for @xmath117 , play important roles on phase slip .",
    "obviously @xmath118 has a zero at @xmath22 , which corresponds to the synchronized state .",
    "now we assume that the functions @xmath19 and @xmath20 are unimodal and that @xmath19 has two zeroes , which are reasonable in many practical cases .",
    "then it follows that @xmath118 has another zero @xmath119 , which we call the moving @xmath118-branch , corresponding to phase slip .",
    "in fact , from the above assumption it is easy to show that @xmath120 is a monotonically decreasing function of @xmath86 that satisfies @xmath121 , crossing @xmath122 ( @xmath123 ) twice within one oscillation period , reflecting the fact that phase slips occur in the negative direction .",
    "in addition , two zeros of the response function @xmath115 , denoted by @xmath124 and @xmath125 , give the other potential extrema moving linearly along @xmath126 , which we call @xmath19-branches . note that , in the case of eq .",
