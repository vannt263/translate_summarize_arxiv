    "an observer with constant self - acceleration @xmath0 in vacuum minkowski space - time sees himself immersed in a thermal bath at temperature @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "this is the unruh effect .",
    "one explanation for this phenomenon is that the constant acceleration impedes this observer to be in contact with all the minkowski space .",
    "in fact , there is a portion of the space - time ( a rindler wedge ) , including half of a spatial hyperplane , from which the signals can not reach the observer . in consequence ,",
    "the degrees of freedom lying in this region are not relevant for the description of the physics in the observer s world .",
    "if we trace over them , the vacuum state becomes a mixed state on the observer s half space @xmath2 .",
    "this mixing reflects the presence of quantum entanglement between the seen and the hidden regions .    in a more general case",
    ", we can consider localization in a different region @xmath2 .",
    "the corresponding local state @xmath3 is defined by the property that it leads to the same expectation values for the operators localized in @xmath2 than the vacuum state . in presence of a regularization",
    ", @xmath3 can be written in terms of a density matrix , in such a way we have @xmath4 for any operator @xmath5 localized in the region @xmath2 ( or more precisely localized in the domain of dependence of @xmath2 ) . in this paper",
    "we will assume implicitly such a regularization ( a lattice regularization for example ) , which will allow us to use the language of local density matrices ( in the continuum limit the local algebras of operators are a special kind of von neumann algebras , and the states on the local algebras should be treated with more sofisticated mathematical machinery than density matrices ) .",
    "any density matrix can be written as an exponential @xmath6 of a hermitian operator @xmath7 , and where @xmath8 is a normalization constant .",
    "the thermal interpretation of the local state @xmath3 arises when one considers an internal time @xmath9 , with unitary evolution given by the operator @xmath10 , inside the algebra of the fields in the region @xmath2 . with respect to this notion of time evolution ,",
    "@xmath3 is indeed thermal , with temperature rescaled to 1 .    in the algebraic axiomatic approach to quantum field theory , the internal time evolution",
    "is called the modular flow and the hermitian operator corresponding to @xmath7 the modular hamiltonian @xcite .",
    "these are well defined using the tomita - takesaki theory , which plays an important role in the structure .",
    "the ciclic and separating vector state of the tomita - takesaki theory ( here the vacuum state @xmath11 ) is related to @xmath3 through eq .",
    "( [ an ] ) .    in a different context",
    ", this mechanism of time flow generation from a thermodynamical state has been related with the time problem in quantum gravity @xcite .",
    "the thermal time hypotesis aims to explain the emergence of a physical time flow in a general covariant quantum theory as determined by the thermodynamical state rather than been a universal property of the mechanical theory .    in the unruh effect",
    "the set @xmath2 corresponds to a rindler wedge .",
    "this particular case has a remarkable feature .",
    "the hamiltonian has the universal expression @xmath12 , in terms of the boost operator @xmath13 which keeps the rindler wedge fixed .",
    "this is valid for any quantum field theory @xcite .",
    "the internal evolution is local and causal .",
    "it is given by point transformations along the integral curves of the boost operator , which are precisely the trajectories of constant acceleration observers .",
    "in curved space - time a similar universality occurs for the black hole , where the local hamiltonian for the outside region and the hartle - hawking state is proportional to the time translation operator for asymptotic observers .    for different type of sets these features",
    "should be lost in general .",
    "an exception is the internal evolution corresponding to spherical sets @xmath2 ( which are single intervals in two dimensions ) in conformal theories .",
    "this is also local , and given by the one parameter group of global conformal transformations which keep @xmath2 fixed @xcite .",
    "however , no other explicit example of internal evolution is known in quantum field theory . in particular",
    "no non local example has been explicitly computed .    in this work",
    "we provide one such example .",
    "we calculate @xmath3 when @xmath2 is formed by several disjoint spatial intervals in two dimensional minkowski space , for a massless dirac field .",
    "we explicitly diagonalize the reduced density matrix in this case , and obtain the internal evolution .",
    "we find some surprising features .",
    "even if the internal evolution is non local , it does not mix all the operators on the cauchy surface , but the operators in selected points on each interval . also , we find that the total posible teleportation between the different regions appears to be limited .    in curved space",
    "a similar phenomena should be present in the case of several black hole regions . in this context",
    ", the present example provides an exactly solvable toy model in order to explore the subtle effects of the multipartite entanglement present on the vacuum fluctuations , and their relation with the geometry .",
    "also , these effects should give place in flat space to correlations on the meassurements of two or more accelerated observers .",
    "as an application of the results , we also calculate the multicomponent entanglement entropy in the massive case under some approximations .",
    "we show the property of extensivity of the mutual information which holds for the massless case is lost in the massive one .",
    "an expression for the reduced density matrix @xmath14 in terms of the two point correlators is known for free dirac fields @xcite .",
    "this follows from the fact that the expectation values of polynomials on the fields located in @xmath2 computed with the help of @xmath14 must obey wick s theorem ( here the global state is the vacuum ) .",
    "this fixes @xmath14 to be of the form ( [ rho1 ] ) where @xmath7 is a hamiltonian for @xmath2 which is quadratic on the fields inside this region . for discrete bosonic systems",
    "analogous expressions for @xmath7 exist which are quadratic on the field and momentum operators .",
    "however , the generalization of these expressions to the continuum case is not known @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we are interested in free dirac fields in two dimensions .",
    "however , the formulas in this section apply to any dimensions with the obvious modifications .",
    "let us consider the general case of regions which are arbitrary spatial curves , not necessarily included in a single spatial line , as shown in figure 1 .",
    "thus we write @xmath7 as @xmath15 where @xmath16 , and @xmath17 are length parameters along the spatial curve @xmath2 .",
    "the dirac field @xmath18 satisfies the dirac equation @xmath19 and the canonical ( equal - time ) anticommutation relations @xmath20 for the fields @xmath21 parametrized with the length @xmath22 on the surface @xmath2 the slope of the curve ( its relative lorentz boost with respect to the @xmath23constant lines ) has to be taken into account , and equation ( [ hacha ] ) generalizes to @xmath24 where we have written @xmath25 and @xmath26 the unit vector normal to the surface @xmath2 at the point @xmath22 .",

    "heuristically , this means the information can not travel faster than the light speed , and in consequence it must be the same in the surfaces @xmath2 and @xmath36 in figure 1 . in order to show this ,",
    "consider the equation @xmath37 which is valid for any space - time point @xmath38 in the domain of dependence of @xmath2 , and where @xmath22 is again a distance parameter along the curve @xmath2 .",
    "this follows by the uniqueness of the solution of the dirac equation since the right hand side satisfies the dirac equation in @xmath38 , and on the surface @xmath2 the equation is satisfied due to ( [ algebra ] ) .",
    "then , let us call @xmath39 where @xmath40 is a field on @xmath36 and @xmath41 is a field on @xmath2 .",
    "we have the following identities in operator notation @xmath42 where @xmath43 now , considering the anticommutator in the surface @xmath36 @xmath44 thus , @xmath45 and @xmath46 are inverse to each other .",
    "it is then easy to see that the similarity transformation of the correlator ( [ un]-[tre ] ) can not change @xmath7 in eqs .",
    "( [ uno]-[tree ] ) .",
    "this means that we can use any spatial slice for a given causally complete set ( that is , a diamond shaped set arising as a domain of dependence of a spatial set ) in order to compute the density matrix .",

    "let us define the chirality operator @xmath54 , with @xmath55 and @xmath56 , and the chirality projectors @xmath57 .",
    "let us also introduce the null coordinates @xmath58 the massless dirac equation leads to @xmath59 , where @xmath60 are the field components of definite chirality ( note that @xmath61 has chirality @xmath62 ) .",
    "then we have @xmath63 these fields depend only on one of the null coordinates , and satisfy the anticommutation relations @xmath64    using this decomposition and the massless limit of the correlator ( [ yuyi ] ) in eqs.([uno]-[tree ] ) we have ( for any choice of surface ) @xmath65 here @xmath66 are the projections of @xmath2 in the @xmath67 and @xmath68 coordinate axis respectively , and @xmath69 is now the scalar kernel @xmath70 where the domain of the real variables @xmath71 is @xmath66 . here and in the following the distribution @xmath72 is taken with the principal value regularization .      therefore , in the massless case , the problem of finding an explicit expression for the local density matrix and related quantities is equivalent to the one of solving the operator with kernel @xmath73 .",
    "fortunately , the resolvent of the kernel @xmath74 in multicomponent subsets of the real line is known from the theory of singular integral equations of the cauchy type @xcite .",
