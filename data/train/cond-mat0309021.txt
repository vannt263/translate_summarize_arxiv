    "the vortex state in layered superconductors has a very rich phase diagram in the multidimensional space of temperature - field - anisotropy - field orientation .",
    "especially interesting subject is the vortex phases in layered superconductors with very high anisotropy such as bi@xmath0sr@xmath0cacu@xmath0o@xmath1 ( bscco ) .",
    "relatively simple vortex structures are formed when magnetic field is applied along one of the principal axes of the layered structure .",
    "a magnetic field applied perpendicular to the layers penetrates inside the superconductor in the form of pancake vortices ( pvs ) .",
    "@xcite pvs in different layers are coupled weakly via the josephson and magnetic interactions and form aligned stacks at low fields and temperatures ( pv stacks ) .",
    "these stacks are disintegrated at the melting point . in",
    "another simple case of the magnetic field applied parallel to the layers the vortex structure is completely different .",
    "such a field penetrates inside the superconductor in the form of josephson vortices ( jvs).@xcite the jvs do not have normal cores , but have rather wide nonlinear cores , of the order of the josephson length , located between two central layers . at small in - plane fields",
    "jvs form the triangular lattice , strongly stretched along the direction of the layers , so that jvs form stacks aligned along the @xmath2 direction and separated by a large distance in the in - plane direction .",
    "a rich variety of vortex structures were theoretically predicted for the case of tilted magnetic field , such as the kinked lattice , @xcite , tilted vortex chains @xcite , coexisting lattices with different orientation.@xcite a very special situation exists in highly anisotropic superconductors , in which the magnetic coupling between the pancake vortices in different layers is stronger than the josephson coupling . in such superconductors a tilted magnetic field",
    "creates a unique vortex state consisting of two qualitatively different interpenetrating sublattices.@xcite this set of crossing lattices ( or combined lattice @xcite ) contains a sublattice of josephson vortices generated by the component of the field parallel to the layers , coexisting with a sublattice of stacks of pancake vortices generated by the component of the field perpendicular to the layers .",
    "a basic reason for such an exotic ground state , as opposed to a simple tilted vortex lattice , is that magnetic coupling energy is minimal when pancake stacks are perfectly aligned along the @xmath2 axis . a homogeneous tilt of pancake lattice costs too much magnetic coupling energy , while formation of josephson vortices only weakly disturbs the alignment of pancake stacks .    even at high anisotropies jvs and",
    "pancake stacks have significant attractive coupling.@xcite the strong mutual interaction between the two sublattices leads to a very rich phase diagram with many nontrivial lattice structures separated by phase transitions . at sufficiently small c - axis fields ( 10 - 50 gauss )",
    "a phase separated state is formed : density of the pancake stacks located at jvs becomes larger than the stack density outside jvs.@xcite this leads to formation of dense stack chains separated by regions of dilute triangular lattice in between ( mixed chain+lattice state ) .",
    "such structures have been observed in early decoration experiments @xcite and , more recently , by scanning hall probe @xcite , lorentz microscopy @xcite , and magnetooptical technique.@xcite at very small c - axis fields ( @xmath3 several gauss ) the regions of triangular lattice vanish leaving only chains of stacks.@xcite moreover , there are experimental indications @xcite and theoretical reasoning @xcite in favor of the phase transition from the crossing configuration of pancake - stack chains and jvs into chains of tilted vortices .",
    "jvs also modify the interaction between pancake stacks leading to an attractive interaction between the stacks at large distances.@xcite as a consequence , one can expect clustering of the pancake stacks at small concentrations .",
    "many unexpected observable effects can be naturally interpreted within the crossing lattices picture .",
    "the underlying jv lattice modifies the free energy of the vortex crystal state .",
    "an observable consequence of this change is a shift of the melting temperature .",
    "strong support for the crossing - lattices ground state is the linear dependence of the c - axis melting field on the in - plane field observed within a finite range of in - plane fields.@xcite in an extended field range several melting regimes have been observed @xcite indicating several distinct ground states of vortex matter in tilted fields .",
    "transitions between different ground state configurations have also been detected by the features in the irreversible magnetization.@xcite in this paper we consider in detail the properties of an isolated jv in the pancake lattice .",
    "we mainly focus on the regime of a dense pancake lattice , when many rows of the pancakes fit into the jv core .",
    "the pancake lattice forms an effective medium for jvs which determines their properties .",
    "the dense pancake lattice substantially modifies the jv structure . in general , the phase field of the jv is built up from the continuous regular phase and the phase perturbations created by pancake displacements .",
    "such a jv has a smaller core size and smaller energy as compared to the ordinary jv.@xcite the pancake lattice also strongly modifies the field and current distribution far away from the core region.@xcite    the key parameter which determines the structure of the jv core in the dense pancake lattice is the ratio @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the in - plane london penetration depth , @xmath6 is the anisotropy ratio , and @xmath7 is the period of layered structure .",
    "the core structure experiences a smooth yet qualitative evolution with decrease of this parameter .",
    "when @xmath8 is small ( large anisotropies ) pancakes have only small displacements with respect to positions of the ideal crystal and the jv core occupies several pancakes rows .",
    "in this situation the renormalization of the jv core by the pancake vortices can be described in terms of the continuous vortex phase which is characterized by its own phase stiffness ( effective phase stiffness approach).@xcite at large @xmath8 ( small anisotropies ) the core shrinks to scales smaller than the distance between pancake vortices . in this case pancake stacks in the central row form soliton - like structure smoothly transferring between the neighboring lattice position .",
    "we consider dynamic properties of jvs in the case of small @xmath8 : the critical pinning force which sticks the jv to the pv lattice and the viscosity of the moving jv due to the traveling displacement field in the pv lattice .",
    "the pinning force has a nonmonotonic dependence on the c - axis magnetic field , @xmath9 , reaching maximum when roughly one pancake row fits inside the jv core region . at higher fields the pinning force decays exponentially @xmath10 .",
    "we study jv motion through the pv lattice and find that the lattice strongly hinders the mobility of jvs .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section [ sec : jvstructure ] is devoted to the static structure of an isolated jv inside the pv lattice . in this section",
    "we    * consider small c - axis fields and calculate the crossing energy of jv and pv stack ( [ sec : cren ] ) ; * consider large c - axis fields and introduce the `` effective phase stiffness '' approximation , which allows for simple description of jv structure inside the dense pv lattice in the case of large anisotropy ( [ sec : effphstiff ] ) ; * investigate a large - scale behavior and jv magnetic field ( [ sec : largescale ] ) ; * analyze the jv core quantitatively using numeric minimization of the total energy and find crossover from the jv core structure to the soliton core structure with decrease of anisotropy ( [ sec : quantcore ] ) ; * formulate a simple model which describes the soliton core structure for small anisotropies ( [ sec : soliton ] ) .",
