    "fractal function _ as a function whose graph is an attractor of an iterated function system ( ifs ) and such fractal functions and fractal interpolation are widely studied to construct fractal curves and surfaces in many papers ( @xcite ) .",
    "one _ classical method _ of construction of fractal surfaces is to use fractal curves @xcite .",
    "this approch is usefull in the case when data sets ( _ measurement data _ ) are given only on the _ boundaries of the domain_. the history and recent developments of this approach are described in @xcite .",
    "another ( _ direct _ ) method of construction of fractal surfaces is to use bivariate fractal interpolation functions .",
    "this metod is useful in the case when data sets are given on the _ mesh - points of the whole domain_. massopust @xcite provided a construction of self - affine fractal interpolation surfaces with data set on triangular domain , where the interpolation points ( data points ) on the boundary are assumed coplanar .",
    "this results was generalized to allow more general boundary data and domains in @xcite .",
    "many authors studied construction methods of fiss with the data set given on rectangular grids ( @xcite ) . in @xcite for such data sets on a rectangular grid that interpolation points on the boundary are collinear , a construction of fiss which are attractors of ifss was provided .",
    "this was generalized in malysz @xcite , where ifs was constructed by using constant vertical scaling factors , linear contraction transformations of domain and quadratic polynomials . in @xcite the authors allowed an arbitrary data set and constructed ifs using _ function scaling factors _ and lipschitz transformations of domain , and estimated lower and upper bounds for the box - counting dimensions of the constructed surfaces .",
    "this estimation for box - counting dimension is improved in @xcite(see @xcite , too . )",
    "a _ recurrent iterated functions system _ ( rifs ) defined in @xcite is generalization of ifs and in @xcite they suggested a construction of _ recurrent fractal interpolation surfaces _ ( rfiss ) using rifs .",
    "this is a more flexible method of constructing fractal surfaces than using ifs and applied to the image compression ( @xcite ) .",
    "bouboulis and dalla @xcite provide a general construction of _ recurrent fractal interpolation functions_(rfifs ) on @xmath0 by rifs .",
    "in @xcite they used domain contraction transformations and _ constant scaling _ factors .",
    "this paper is a continuation and extension of @xcite and @xcite where they used ifs and function vertical scaling factors .",
