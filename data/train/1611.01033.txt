    "electronegativity is the measure of an atom , molecule or solid substance to attract electrons to itself . the first connection of the electronegativity ( @xmath0 ) concept with quantum mechanics within density - functional theory ( dft ) is assigned to parr _",
    "@xcite , where @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the chemical potential in dft @xcite .",
    "slater claimed that the total energy ( @xmath3 ) of an atom was a continuous function of its orbital occupations @xcite . in a more general way one can describe the electronegativity of ions as    @xmath4    for an ion with atomic number @xmath5 and a variable number @xmath6 of electrons . if @xmath7 , then eq . [ eq:1 ] is valid for the neutral atom . by writing @xmath8 as a parabolic function of @xmath9 @xcite , and choosing coefficients from atomic first ionization energy ( i ) and electron",
    "affinity ( a ) , we reach the following :    @xmath10    therefore , the partial derivative of eq .",
    "[ eq:2 ] with respect to @xmath6 , according to eq .",
    "[ eq:1 ] , gives    @xmath11    which is precisely mulliken s electronegativity formula @xcite with which i will work in this manuscript , with @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "usually , as a first approximation to the calculation of excitation energies , we simply take the difference between the ground - state kohn - sham eigenvalues . however , the kohn - sham eigenvalues ( and wave functions ) do not have any physical interpretation , excepting those related to the highest occupied state , which is regarded as the negative of the ionization energy of the system @xcite .",
    "atomic ionization energies can be accurately calculated using dft with many local or gradient types of exchange - correlation functionals , and so the atomic electronegativities @xcite , given that total energy can be differentiable with respect to the number of electrons @xcite .",
    "the electronegativity can be written in terms of the electron affinity and ionization energies of a system with @xmath14 electrons as one - electron energy differences , supposing a maximum of two orbitals involved @xcite :    @xmath15 \\\\ & = -\\frac{1}{2}[e(z , z-1 ) - e(z , z+1 ) ] \\\\ & = -\\frac{1}{2}(\\varepsilon_i + \\varepsilon_j ) , \\end{split}\\ ] ]    where @xmath16 and @xmath17 refer to atomic states which , for convenience , we label highest occupied atomic orbital ( hoao ) and lowest unoccupied atomic orbital ( luao ) .",
    "this means one has to be able to calculate excited states to calculate electronegativities .",
    "however , dft does not account for calculating excited states , as is widely known and described in many references elsewhere@xcite .",
    "therefore , the calculation of @xmath18 gap within dft defined at a first approximation by @xmath19 ( not considering spin - orbit effects ) is not accurately determined within dft , as the exchange - correlation energy @xmath20 is only roughly approximated @xcite . in this work ,",
    "theoretical results for periodic properties of ionization energy , electron affinity and electronegativity are presented using a method of fractional occupations of the orbitals involved in the transition from neutral atoms to ions ( @xmath210.5 electron , for negative / positive ions ) using different exchange - correlation functionals within density - functional theory .",
    "the numerical fact of the ( piecewise ) linearity of the eigenvalue as a function of its occupation ( at least for the range tried , of @xmath210.5 electron , for which it proved valid from h to xe ) is used to calculate self - energy of the orbital(s ) involved in the transition , for each element , and those same properties were determined and compared with the direct ion calculation .",
    "details are described in next section .",
    "electronegativity calculations by means of fractional occupations is not novelty , and was performed successfully several times @xcite . to rewrite the electronegativity expression in terms of half - occupations ,",
    "let us consider a system - let s say , an atom - in its ground state to have a fully occupied valence orbital and unoccupied conduction orbital .",
    "if we write @xmath22 as the explicit dependence of the eigenvalue with the occupations at hoao ( @xmath23 ) and luao ( @xmath24 ) , then we can label @xmath25 the formerly luao of the atom in its ground state , @xmath26 , that has just received half - electron .",
    "similarly , @xmath27 will be the formerly occupied valence state of the ground state system , @xmath26 , that has been half - ionized .",
    "assuming that the @xmath18 gap depends only on @xmath16 and @xmath17 orbitals occupations ( @xmath23 and @xmath24 ) , we can expand the energy in taylor series around the ground state @xmath28 until second order :    @xmath29    with second derivatives with respect to total energies being regarded as the hardness tensor @xcite .",
    "now , janak proved that the variation of total energy in dft , with respect to the orbital occupation is equal to the eigenvalue of that orbital @xcite ,    @xmath30    in which @xmath3 is the total energy and @xmath31 is the occupation of the kohn - sham state @xmath32 with eigenvalue @xmath33 .",
    "differentiating eq .",
    "[ eq : janak ] a second time with respect to the orbital occupation , we obtain the relation @xmath34 , in which @xmath35 is regarded as being the ( electrostatic ) self - energy function for the state @xmath32 @xcite ( _ v_. appendix for details on this derivation ) .",
    "writing    @xmath36    with @xmath37 , we rewrite eq . [ eq : e - expansion ] as    @xmath38    where @xmath39 is the ground state energy .",

    "[ eq : eigenvalues_selfenergy ] as @xmath48 and @xmath49 , respectively . @xmath50 and @xmath51 can be calculated from the slope of the @xmath52 _ vs _ @xmath31 trend line .",
    "it is essential bearing in mind that there can be four situations for @xmath53 and @xmath54 , which can be [ a ] @xmath53 and @xmath54 are orbitals of the same spin and same quantum numbers @xmath55 and @xmath56 ( _ e.g. _ si , b , c ) ; [ b ] @xmath53 and @xmath54 are orbitals of different spins but same quantum numbers @xmath55 and @xmath56 ( _ e.g. _ n , p , as ) ; [ c ] @xmath53 and @xmath54 are orbitals of the same spin , but different quantum numbers @xmath55 and @xmath56 ( _ e.g. _ tc , nb , fe ) ; and [ d ] , @xmath53 and @xmath54 are orbitals of different spins and different quantum numbers @xmath55 and @xmath56 ( e.g. ar , ti , kr ) .",
    "all the calculations were `` all - electron '' and performed with the atom program , contained in siesta package @xcite .",
    "the preferred exchange - correlation functional used was the gga by perdew , burke and ernzerhof ( pb ) @xcite .",
    "i encountered numerical convergence problems when trying to calculate electron affinities for some elements due to the prediction of unbound states@xcite , specially when adding half - electrons to _ d_-states . here , differently from previously described by robles and bartolotti @xcite , where they calculate @xmath43 indirectly through @xmath57 , i simply changed the exchange - correlation functional to the blyp functional @xcite , or the lda by perdew and wang ( pw ) @xcite , and calculated @xmath43 directly . in the cases it also failed , as a common practice i then extrapolated the fitted trade line to @xmath58 _ versus _ @xmath31 until @xmath59 @xcite .",
    "although ionization energies were easily calculated for all elements using the pbe functional , for the final electronegativities table , i preferred to choose the best fit result regardless the exchange - correlation functional .",
    "i will comment this in more details in results section .",
    "ionization energies are presented in tab .",
    "[ tab:1 ] . also indicated in tab .",
    "[ tab:1 ] are the exchange - correlation functionals used for each element .",
    "it is worth mentioning that any single functional used ( blyp , pb and pw ) provides very accurate results  _",
    "e.g. _ an average percent error of less than 1.6% if only pb is used ",
    "but i decided to filter the best results out of the three functionals used for each element .",
    "catches the eye the impressive agreement with experimental results , with an average error of just 0.9% ( _ v_. fig .",
    "[ fig : figure1 ] ) . specially for heavier elements",
    " and for 3__d _ _ transition metals as well  relativistic corrections ( excluding spin - orbit ) improved the results@xcite .    .",
