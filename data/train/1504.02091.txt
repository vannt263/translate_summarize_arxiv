    "the local group can be thought of as the closest laboratory for testing cosmological predictions on small scales , including the dynamical formation and evolutionary history of galaxies @xcite . in this context",
    "the dwarf spheroidal ( dsph ) galaxies are of particular interest , as they represent the smallest of galactic systems , and are thought to be embedded in primordial dark matter subhalos , thus giving us insights on the earliest epochs of galaxy formation in the universe .",
    "the investigation of these satellites is thus one of the most active areas of local group research at present @xcite .",
    "their morphological parameters , their masses , their spatial distribution around their host , or the number of observed satellites , can be confronted with predictions of the @xmath2 cold dark matter ( @xmath2cdm ) model @xcite .",
    "for example , their spatial distribution can provide insights on the shape of the dark matter halo of the host galaxy @xcite , whilst the dwarf galaxies morphological characteristics can provide insights on their formation history @xcite .",
    "the very nature of the dsphs as faint , poorly populated systems , poses several observational challenges , even for their identification in the local group .",
    "generally , they have been discovered through the identification of small overdensities of stars over the contaminating foreground stellar populations ( and background population of mis - identified compact galaxies ) .",
    "improvements in instrumentation and analysis techniques have led to the discovery of several new local group dsph galaxies in recent years @xcite .",
    "the known population of dsphs in the local group has thereby increased considerably @xcite , which is now beginning to allow us to draw statistically firm conclusions about the properties of the dsph population .",
    "for instance , a recent discovery has shown that half of the dwarf galaxy satellites of the andromeda galaxy ( m31 ) reside in a vast thin plane around their host ( vtp ) , and appear to have coherent motions @xcite .",
    "this observational dynamical alignment is still not fully understood within the @xmath2cdm framework where the subhalos that might host dsphs are a priori expected to possess only a weak alignment @xcite .",
    "finding whether the satellites that partake in the alignment have a particular intrinsic shape and orientation that distinguishes them from the other dsphs orbiting around m31 may help in assessing whether the two sub - populations have experienced a different dynamical history .",
    "the morphological properties of satellite dwarf galaxies can also provide tests of theoretical frameworks of galaxy formation on small scales .",
    "these galaxies are usually described as a baryonic component embedded in a massive dark matter halo @xcite , meaning that their stars are relatively protected from the tidal field of their giant host .",
    "but the formation of a plane of satellites ( as apparently required in m31 ) , or any past interactions could have produced strong tidal effects that could have strongly affected their baryonic distribution and make them partly lose their dark matter halo .",
    "another possibility is that some dsphs galaxies are actually not embedded in dark matter halos at all , but are rather remnants of so - called tidal dwarf galaxies which would have been created in an encounter between two major galaxies in the distant past , a scenario which might explain the formation of thin planes of galaxies such as the one observed around andromeda @xcite and around the milky way ( e.g. , @xcite )",
    ". such tidal dwarf galaxies would be mostly devoid of dark matter @xcite , and would presumably be much more prone to tidal deformation than those embedded in primordial dark matter halos .",
    "some of the problems of this picture are in principle alleviated if the modified newtonian dynamics framework @xcite is adopted @xcite .",
    "some other solutions consider the possibility of dissipative dark matter , as for example , in @xcite or in @xcite .    in cosmological simulations ,",
    "subhalos are generally rounder than the host halos .",
    "subhalos that have masses that are large enough to host dwarf galaxies have axis ratios : @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "observed dsphs are observed to be approximately roughly round : for the milky way , @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "but we know that this observed ellipticity is just a projected view , and the third dimension could thus hide more elongated shapes . however , deprojecting to recover the intrinsic ellipticity is a challenge because distance uncertainties to different sides of the same dsph are currently far too large to allow any differential depth measurement except maybe in the magellanic clouds @xcite .",
    "therefore , in this paper , we propose a method which allows us to probe the third dimension , and we focus ourselves on m31 .    in section  [ method ] we summarize the general method employed in this contribution , justify our hypotheses and present our data .",
    "section  [ code ] presents all dwarf galaxies parameters used in the analysis , which have been extracted from the observations . in section  [ deprojection ]",
    ", we define how our deprojection procedure is built .",
    "results are then discussed in sections  [ results ] and [ individual ] , and our conclusions are drawn in section  [ conclusion ] .",
    "in order to deproject the view and try to see which intrinsic ellipticity distribution can fit the observed projected distribution of stellar populations in the target dwarf , some simplifying hypotheses need to be made . in the following ,",
    "two main hypotheses are adopted .",
    "first , we consider that dsphs have a prolate shape , like a cigar .",
    "this is indeed the natural shape of dark matter halos in the relevant mass range @xcite . in simulations",
    "in which dwarf satellites galaxies are initially made of rotating stellar discs , this is a less natural assumption , but they can in principle also be deformed into a prolate shape through bar - like instabilities caused by ongoing small tidal interactions with the host @xcite .",
    "our second assumption will be to take an orientation of the prolate body that is consistent with the observed projection of the major axis , as sketched in figure  [ 3dview ] .",
    "three cases will be considered :    1 .",
    "the prolate dwarf galaxy is oriented perpendicular to the radial vector linking the host and the satellite 2 .",
    "the major axis of the prolate dwarf galaxy is oriented as close as possible to the radial vector 3 .",
    "the prolate dwarf galaxy has a random orientation that is consistent with the observed projection .          in the present contribution",
    ", we will examine the structural properties of the dwarf galaxies surrounding the andromeda galaxy ( m31 ) .",
    "our observational data are derived from the pan - andromeda archaeological survey ( pandas ) @xcite . this photometric survey with",
    "the megacam camera on the canada - france - hawaii telescope has mapped a large area around andromeda ( @xmath5 400 deg@xmath6 ) , allowing the discovery and characterization of the dwarf satellite galaxies of m31 .",
    "a detailed account of the processing of the pandas survey through to the final catalogue of aperture magnitudes is given in @xcite .",
    "the pandas photometry was also used to estimate the distances to the dwarf galaxies , using the tip of the red giant branch ( trgb ) method @xcite . by using a markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) approach that incorporated bayesian priors on the expected morphology of the satellites and their luminosity function ,",
    "@xcite were able to derive a posterior probability distribution function ( pdf ) for the distance to each of the satellites present in the survey .    from the homogeneous pandas data set , we also inferred the morphological parameters of all dwarf galaxies that fall in the survey footprint . these were derived using a version of the @xcite algorithm , updated for a full mcmc treatment , and which will be presented in another publication that is to be submitted soon ( martin et al .",
    "2015 , in preparation ) .",
    "the code developed by @xcite infers the following observational parameters : the projected ellipticity ( @xmath7 , with @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the minor axis of the adjusted ellipse and @xmath10 the semimajor axis ) , the position angle ( @xmath11 , the angle between the equatorial north and the major axis ) , and the half - light radius ( @xmath12 , taken along the major axis ) .",
    "the code was run on 23 dwarf galaxies present in the pandas survey and outputs posterior pdfs in the form of mcmc chains .",
    "we have also included in our study the dwarf elliptical satellites , ngc 147 and ngc 185 . for them ,",
    "realistic mcmc chains have been created by simultaneous drawings from gaussian pdfs built from @xcite , also derived from the pandas survey . according to @xcite ,",
    "among these 25 satellites , 14 are in the vtp : and i , and iii , and ix , and xi , and xii , and xiii , and xiv , and xvi , and xvii , and xxv , and xxvi , cass ii , ngc 147 and ngc 185 . whereas 11 are outside the vtp : and ii , and v , and x , and xv , and xviii , and xix , and xx , and xxi , and xxii , and xxiii and and xxiv .",
    "thus , for each satellite @xmath13 of andromeda , the code provides us with a markov chain that contains at each step @xmath14 the positional and morphological parameters of interest : @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "for example , in figure  [ nico ] we display the pdf derived from @xmath18 draws ( this is typically the number of draws in all mcmc chains used in this study ) of the projected ellipticity from the markov chain of andromeda i , an example of a rather round dsph galaxy with a large number of resolved red giant stars and andromeda xxii , an example of an extended dsph galaxy with a small number of resolved red giant stars .",

    "the vertical bars are one sigma standard deviations of the number of satellites per bin , derived from @xmath22 draws .",

    "satellite galactic coordinates ( @xmath23 , @xmath24 ) are considered perfect . we have chosen to take them from the literature in @xcite for cassiopeia ii and in @xcite for the other ones . for the third dimension ,",

    "they define a possible representation in space of the centre around andromeda in association with three possible projected morphological characteristics : @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath27 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 .      in all the following analysis , the intrinsic shape of the dwarf galaxies",
    "is approximated as a prolate ellipsoid , which is a natural outcome of dark matter satellites in @xmath2cdm simulations @xcite . with this assumption",
    "the satellites have two equal minor axes ( @xmath9 ) and one major axis ( @xmath10 ) .",
    "consequently , since a prolate structure is symmetrical by rotation around the major axis , the projected minor axis remains identical , irrespective of the point of view .",
    "thus the apparent minor axis of the ellipse given by the projected satellite is taken to measure the real minor axis ( @xmath9 ) .",
    "on the other hand , @xmath28 is known , defined by @xmath11 and @xmath29 .    of course , due to the projection on the sky , the real major axis",
    "@xmath30 is not equal to @xmath28 : @xmath30 can have any orientation in the plane ( @xmath31 ) defined by the line of sight and @xmath28 ( see figure  [ 3dview ] ) .",
    "thus , an additional condition is required to fix the three - dimensional orientation of the major axis , and consequently the intrinsic ellipticity of the satellites .",
    "we consider three possibilities which will be discussed in section  [ deprojection ] .      as defined above , the intrinsic major axis @xmath30 has to lie in the plane @xmath31 .",
    "however , depending on the parameter set drawn from the chain , it is possible that @xmath10 can take on physically implausible values . to avoid this situation",
    ", we implement a filter to reject solutions where @xmath10 would be larger than the tidal radius of the satellite ( tidal rejection criterion ) .",
    "thus , the tidal radius is considered as the maximal radius : @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the satellite mass and @xmath34 the mass of the host galaxy contained in the sphere of radius @xmath35 ( distance between the satellite centre and the host galaxy centre ) .",
    "we estimate @xmath34 using an nfw @xcite halo model ( with virial mass @xmath36 , a mean value of recent results @xcite ) .",
    "the value of @xmath33 is derived from the line of sight velocity dispersion ( @xmath37 ) listed in @xcite for ngc 147 and ngc 185 and in @xcite for the other galaxies , taking : @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the gravitational constant .",
    "consequently , with equation  ( [ tidal ] ) and  ( [ disp ] ) , the following limit can be set to @xmath10 : @xmath40 given the large uncertainties in @xmath37 , we wish to remain conservative and so as not to eliminate physically possible cases , we adopt the values corresponding to the listed value of @xmath37 plus one standard deviation . in the following analysis ,",
    "this criterion is always automatically applied , and it forces the rejection of approximately 5% of the mcmc parameter trial values . finally , to avoid the mcmc process from exploring unrealistic solutions , we limited the projected half - light radius to 20 arcmin .",
    "we constructed a simple toy model to test the algorithms that we developed and to obtain a first assessment of the magnitude of the effect of de - projection on the ellipticity distribution .",
    "three - dimensional prolate dwarf galaxies are generated with a random size ( in the range of the observed dwarf satellites galaxies ) and are placed at random locations around the andromeda galaxy ( again in the observed range ) . in figure  [ obsell_reproj ]",
    "we show the consequence of assuming that the intrinsic ellipticity is given by the observed _ projected _ distribution previously displayed in figure  [ projectedellipticity ] ( red dots ) .",
    "these prolate structures are observed from a position corresponding to earth , and we measure the projected ellipticity that the artificial structures would then be seen to possess ( purple triangles ) . as expected",
    ", the projected distribution will appear rounder than the intrinsic distribution .",
    "the differences in the rounder bin is about 2@xmath41 , thus confirming that the projected distribution can not be seen as the 3-dimensional one .",
    "green circles represent the intrinsic ellipticity chosen for this test .",
    "purple triangles represent the distribution of projected ellipticity for 1000 3-dimensional systems of 25 dsph galaxies generated from a random distribution of position and from the green distribution for the ellipticity .",
    "red dots are the observed ellipticities previously seen in figure  [ projectedellipticity ] .",
    "vertical error bars indicate one standard deviation . ]",
    "our next task is to find the distribution of intrinsic ellipticities that is consistent with the observed projected distribution of figure  [ projectedellipticity ] , and with the observed orientations and distances of the real satellites . as stated above , this will require an additional geometric constraint , which we will implement via an assumption regarding the 3-dimensional orientation of the satellites .      as a first hypothesis , we suppose that each satellite is oriented tangentially with respect to the vector @xmath42 connecting it to m31 , i.e. that the real semimajor axis ( @xmath10 ) of the modeled dwarf galaxy is on the plane @xmath43 perpendicular to @xmath42 . for satellite @xmath13 ,",

    "once the direction of @xmath30 is known , @xmath46 is determined by requiring that it correspond to the projected view of the dwarf galaxy whose apparent semimajor axis is @xmath47 . finally , the intrinsic ellipticity @xmath48 assuming this `` tangential hypothesis '' , is calculated ( see figure  [ tang ] ) . in appendix  [ annexetangent ]",
    "we describe this deprojection in more detail .",

    "the red curves are the observed ellipticity previously seen in figure  [ nico ] . ]    as the tangential deprojected chain of each of the dwarf galaxies is now known , a random draw from each of the markov chains gives a system of satellites all of which are in tangential orientation .",
    "this procedure is repeated to obtain the global ellipticity distribution of the dwarf galaxy system , which is shown in figure  [ all_tang ] . under this `` tangential '' assumption ,",
    "the intrinsic distribution of ellipticity is substantially flatter than the projected ellipticity , and produces a long tail of highly flattened systems .",

    "red dots are the observed ellipticities previously seen in figure  [ projectedellipticity ] .",
    "vertical error bars indicate one standard deviation . ]",
    "the second hypothesis that we explore in this analysis is to consider that the satellites are oriented as close as possible to the radial direction with respect to andromeda .",
    "as before , the major axis @xmath30 must lie on @xmath31 .",
    "for this `` radial '' deprojection , we would like @xmath30 to lie along @xmath42",
    ". however , the prolate ellipsoid must also be consistent with the observed ( projected ) orientation of the galaxy .",
    "in this situation , we have three spatial unknowns that have to respect four independent equations , so that the problem turns out to be over - constrained .",
    "thus , an exact radial orientation is , in general , impossible .    a way to resolve",
    "the problem is to attempt to orient the prolate ellipsoid as close as possible to a radial direction . to this end , we minimise the angle @xmath49 , between @xmath42 and @xmath30 such that the projection of @xmath30 yields @xmath28 .",
    "consequently , @xmath49 is the minimum angle , an incompressible lower limit , that can exist between the radial vector and the major axis vector of a dwarf galaxy according to our data .",
    "the intrinsic ellipticity ( assuming this `` radial '' hypothesis ) @xmath50 is thus obtained ( see figure  [ rad ] ) coupled with @xmath51 ( see figure  [ beta ] ) . for more details , see appendix  [ annexeradial ] .",

    "again , differences between galaxies within the vtp of galaxies and outside of it are not significant .      in the previous subsections we considered a `` tangential '' and a `` radial '' de - projection .",
    "we have seen that a satellite can always be fit to a 3-d tangential orientation , but that a prolate system can not be placed closer to a radial direction than a minimum angle @xmath49 ( which depends on the structure and position of the satellite ) .",
    "however in reality , we do not have observational information that allows us to favor either of these orientations , and we only know that the major axis lies within the line of sight plane @xmath31 .",
    "this motivates our final deprojection , where we instead make the minimal assumption that the satellites are randomly oriented within @xmath31 .",
    "the random angle @xmath52 , is the angle between the line of sight and the major axis @xmath30 .",

    "]    the resulting deprojection is shown in figure  [ gamdeproj ] and presents a rather flat ellipticity distribution .",
    "again , there is almost no difference between the dwarf galaxies that belong to the vtp and those outside of it .",
    "the distributions of ellipticity obtained in figures  [ all_tang ] and  [ all_rad ] take into account the observational information with a hypothesis on the orientation and on the prolate shape of the satellite galaxies .",
    "in contrast , the distributions of ellipticity obtained in figure  [ gamdeproj ] take into account the observational information assuming that the shape of the satellite galaxies is prolate , but that no particular direction can be privileged .",
    "if either of these approaches is realistic , one of the resulting deprojected distributions should be the real intrinsic ellipticity .    to test the consistency of this approach , we decided to examine whether the derived deprojected ellipticity distributions would give rise to projected distributions similar to the observed distribution of @xmath7 for random viewing directions .",
    "to this end we modelled systems containing 25 ( 3-dimensional ) prolate ellipsoids with random orientation .",
    "the ellipticity , and so the semimajor axis , is randomly picked from the 3-d tangential - deprojected ellipticity distribution .",

    "a set of 1000 such systems were generated and observed from a position equivalent to that of the earth point at @xmath56 from the host galaxy .",
    "the final 2-d projected ellipticity is shown figure  [ tan_reproj ] . the same test is applied with the 3-d radial - deprojected ellipticity and the 3-d @xmath52-deprojected one .",

    "this means that if dwarf galaxies are prolate structures , and if our viewing direction is not special , the galaxies are not oriented in a radial configuration .",
    "however , the projected distributions based on tangential ( figure  [ tan_reproj ] ) or the @xmath52-deprojection ( figure  [ gam_reproj ] ) methods are perfectly consistent with the observed distribution of ellipticity .",
    "we consider that this is a good consistency test of our method . thus modelling dwarf galaxies as possessing prolate shapes",

    "column 5 is the mean distance from m31 to the centre of the dsph galaxy obtained by @xcite .",
    "note that these observed average values ( columns 3 , 4 and 5 ) take into account the fact that some values have been rejected by our tidal criterion in the @xmath52-deprojection method .",
    "columns 6 , 8 and 10 represent respectively the mean of the tangential - deprojected , radial - deprojected and @xmath52-deprojected ellipticity obtained with our method .",
    "columns 7 , 9 and 11 are the percentage of excluded cases by our tidal criteria for the 3 deprojections . the last column is the angle @xmath49 previously defined as the geometrically minimum possible angle between the radial direction and the plane @xmath31 .",

    "objects in a radial configuration are falling toward their host with a compact shape whereas objets in tangential or random orientation are suspected to have been strongly disrupted in their orbits around their host .",
    "as expected , each kind of deprojection gives a larger ellipticity ( with a minimum of 0.44 ) than the projected observations .",
    "thus , these dwarf galaxies tend to possess an elongated shape with a minor to major axis ratio ( @xmath57 ) of approximately 1/2 .",
    "@xcite and @xcite find a sightly larger but coherent axis ratio in the inner regions ( @xmath58 ) of the dark matter satellites in the aquarius simulation that could possibly host stars .",
    "thus our conclusion appears to be consistent with the possibility that stellar components in the andromeda satellite galaxies possess the same shape .",
    "this is perhaps not incompatible either with them being remnants of ancient tidal dwarf galaxies .",
    "these observational values can in any case serve as a test of various models in the future .",
    "first of all , we have seen that adopting a prolate shape for the dwarf satellite galaxies of andromeda gives a coherent solution in the sense that the derived ellipticity distribution for the real viewing direction is similar to what would be derived from a random vantage point .",
    "this simplifying assumption has allowed us to derive the intrinsic ellipticity for the entire population of satellites .",
    "the resulting ellipticity distribution is found to be relatively flat between @xmath59 of @xmath20 to @xmath60 before decaying at larger ellipticities .",
    "some of the dwarf galaxies are found to be intrinsically significantly elongated .",
    "this is probably not incompatible with them being remnants of ancient tidal dwarf galaxies as recently found by , e.g. , @xcite , but it could also be consistent with dwarf galaxies having the same shape as their hosting dark matter subhalo . secondly , no clear difference in ellipticity between the satellites inside the vtp and those outside of it was noticed .",
    "the two populations of galaxies seem to be made of the same type of objects as also recently concluded by @xcite .",
    "nevertheless we noted that the distribution of ellipticity versus distance to m31 in the tangential deprojection case was slightly different for galaxies inside and outside of the vtp .",
