    "this distribution of @xmath38 is the null hypothesis that i will use to compare to the distribution of @xmath38 measured in the transiting exoplanet systems under the assumption of spin - orbit alignment .",
    "i collected the properties of the 80 transiting exoplanets systems known as of may 2010 , of which the 75 listed in table  [ tbl-1 ] have measured mass , radius , @xmath20 , and orbital inclination . in this case , the stellar masses and radii are more precisely measured than those available in the spocs catalog , and the inclination of each exoplanet s orbit is known from transit photometry .",
    "i again use a monte carlo simulation to determine the range of observable @xmath17 .",

    "if there are only upper limits on @xmath20 in the literature , i assume that the true value corresponds to the published upper - limit , as this is the most conservative way to approach a search for stars with anomalously slow projected rotation . in those situations ,",
    "i assume that the error in @xmath20 is 1 km s@xmath41 .",
    "i assume that the inclination of the host star s spin relative to the line of sight @xmath8 is the same the inclination of the exoplanet s orbit @xmath5 .",
    "i repeat this process 1000 times and compute the rotation statistic @xmath38 for each stellar host ; i report the results of this calculation in table  [ tbl-1 ] .",
    "i plot the distribution of @xmath38 for both samples in figure  [ fig03 ] .",
    "the @xmath38 distribution of the control sample peaks near @xmath42 , indicating that the simple empirical model is accurate in that the expected residual between the model and the observations is close to zero .",
    "the distribution of @xmath38 falls off quickly as @xmath38 increases , and there are no control stars from the spocs catalog with @xmath43 .",
    "however , there does exist a tail of stars with much larger than expected @xmath11 values , and therefore large negative @xmath38 values .",
    "in other words , some stars in the control sample of spocs stars are fast rotators ; this is to be expected in any sample of sun - like field stars . on the other hand ,",
    "there is no tail of spocs stars rotating arbitrarily more slowly than the simple empirical model predicts .",
    "for that reason , host stars of exoplanets that are observed to have @xmath43 are apparently unlike any of the 866 stars in the control sample  either they rotate more slowly relative to the model than any star in the control sample or their anomalously slow projected rotation is due to a pole - on view of the star and therefore spin - orbit misalignment .",
    "i define fast rotators as those stars with @xmath44 , corresponding to the fastest 5% of the @xmath38 distribution for the spocs control sample .",
    "note that the fraction of fast rotators in each sample is statistically indistinguishable ",
    "about @xmath45 in the spocs sample and about @xmath46 in the transiting exoplanet host star sample .",
    "the consistency of the two samples in the fraction of stars that are fast rotators is in sharp contrast to the disparity at the other end of the distribution .",
    "also , the peak of the @xmath38 distribution of transiting exoplanet systems is offset to more negative values of @xmath38 ( and therefore faster rotation ) than the field star sample .",
    "nevertheless , the distribution of the sample mean of @xmath38 for the 90% of the spocs control sample with @xmath47 is @xmath48 ; for the host stars of transiting exoplanets an equivalent calculation yields @xmath49 .",
    "i plot @xmath38 as a function of stellar mass for both samples in figure  [ fig04 ]",
    ". there is a very sharp cutoff in the control sample at @xmath50 at all masses , and this sharp cutoff is due to lack of a constraint on the inclination of individual stars in the control sample . as a result ,",
    "@xmath51 in equation  [ eq2 ] can be large , resulting in small values of @xmath38 .",
    "i find that hat - p-7 , hat - p-14 , hat - p-16 , hd 17156 , kepler-5 , kepler-7 , tres-4 , wasp-1 , wasp-12 , and wasp-14 have @xmath52 , indicating @xmath20 too small to be explained by the uncertainties in their masses , radii , or ages if each star s spin and its exoplanet s orbit have the same inclination to the line of sight .",
    "unless the host stars of these transiting exoplanets are slower rotators relative to the model prediction than any of the 866 stars in the control sample from the spocs catalog , the most natural explanation for these discrepancies is that the inclination of the spin of these host stars @xmath8 is significantly different that the inclination of their exoplanet s orbit @xmath5 .",
    "if these anomalously slow projected rotation values are the result of spin - orbit misalignment , then the difference between @xmath20 and @xmath21 can be used to compute the four possible degenerate values of @xmath8 ( because @xmath53 is not one - to - one for @xmath54 ) .",
    "i report these values for the potentially spin - orbit misaligned systems in table  [ tbl-2 ] .",
    "i also identify corot-2 , hat - p-2 , hd 189733 , kepler-8 , and xo-3 as fast rotators .",

    "hat - p-2 has been observed to have a large radial velocity jitter , which may indicate an active and possibly quickly rotating star @xcite .",
    "all ten candidate misaligned systems have host stellar mass @xmath55 . again",
    ", either these stars have rotation properties unlike any of the 276 control stars in the mass range @xmath56 , or these stars are observed pole - on and therefore spin - orbit misaligned .      in order to verify the robustness of this result",
    ", i have repeated my calculations with several different sets of input parameters .",
    "indeed , there are two potentially uncertain inputs to my simple empirical model : the power - law exponent @xmath57 in the relation @xmath58 and the ages of the stars in the spocs control sample .",
    "it is certain that the rotation of isolated sun - like stars slows down with time , so @xmath59 always . to determine",
    "if my result is sensitive to @xmath57 , i have repeated my calculation for @xmath60 , @xmath61 , and @xmath62 .",
    "if @xmath63 , then all of the systems identified with anomalously slow projected rotation in  2.3 are again identified as anomalously slow projected rotators . if @xmath61 , eight of the original ten systems are identified as anomalously slow projected rotators ( hat - p-7 , hat - p-14 , kepler-5 , kepler-7 , hd 17156 , tres-4 , wasp-12 , and wasp-14 ) .",
    "if @xmath62 , only three of the original ten systems are identified as anomalously slow projected rotators ( hat - p-7 , hat - p-14 , and wasp-14 ) .",
    "i have also redone my calculation using a completely uninformative prior on the ages of the stars in spocs sample .",
    "that is , i assumed that the age of each star was uniformly distributed between 650 myr and its main sequence lifetime .",
    "again , all ten systems identified in  2.3 as anomalously slow projected rotators and therefore possibly spin - orbit misaligned are again identified in this case .",
    "angular momentum exchange between a host star and its close - in planetary companion is also unlikely to significantly slow the rotation of the host star and produce an anomalously slow projected rotation velocity .",
    "for that to occur , the transfer of angular momentum from host star to exoplanet via tidal forces requires the rotation period of the star to be shorter than the orbital period of the planet .",
    "indeed , the median orbital period of the transiting planets orbiting the stars identified as anomalously slow projected rotators is @xmath64 days , while the median expected rotation period of their host stars is @xmath65 days .",
    "the presence of slightly evolved stars among the host stars of transiting exoplanets will also not produce false identifications as anomalously slow projected rotators . to see why , note that there are also slightly evolved stars in the control sample of spocs stars and recall that the threshold @xmath38 required to identify a star as an anomalously slow projected rotator was set by the maximum disagreement between model and observation in the control sample . in other words , the presence of slightly evolved stars has already been accounted for in setting the threshold .",
    "i plot in figure  [ fig05 ] the distribution of the spocs sample in a theoretical hr diagram along with those transiting exoplanet hosts with trigonometric parallaxes .",
    "i also indicate the locations of those stellar hosts that i identified as anomalously slow projected rotators and therefore potentially spin - orbit misaligned systems .",
    "figure  [ fig05 ] shows that many of the systems i identified as anomalously slow projected rotators appear to be evolving off of the zero - age main sequence ( zams ) .",
    "nevertheless , the fact that there are many stars in the control sample of spocs stars in similar evolutionary states suggests that the effects of stellar evolution on the rotation properties of evolved stars have already been accounted for in my analysis .",
    "moreover , there are several hosts of transiting exoplanets that have evolved off of the zams that i do not identify as anomalously slow projected rotators .",
    "collectively , these facts suggest that effects of stellar evolution can not explain the rotation properties of the ten systems i identified as anomalously slow projected rotators .    additional selection effects in either the spocs control sample or the transiting exoplanet sample are unlikely to affect this result .",
    "indeed , the fact that spocs stars were preferentially selected to be those stars with small enough @xmath11 to enable high precision doppler radial velocity measurements biases my control sample to smaller @xmath11 at fixed stellar mass and age .",
    "however , since the candidate spin - orbit misaligned stars appear to have anomalously slow projected rotation , the bias acts against the false identification of a star as an anomalously slow projected rotator .",
    "though magnitude - limited transit surveys are biased toward stars slightly more massive than the sun , there are 276 stars in the control sample with @xmath66 to compare with .",
    "in addition , though targeted transit surveys are biased toward less active stars , the control sample of spocs stars in similarly biased .",
    "transit surveys should also not be biased toward evolved stars , as though both transit probability and transit duration increase linearly with host stellar radius ( favoring evolved systems ) , transit depth decreases quadratically with host stellar radius ( favoring unevolved systems ) .",
    "for that reason , the chance of detecting a transiting planet is roughly insensitive to host stellar radius .      for the anomalously slow projected rotators identified in  2.3 , i list in table  [ tbl-2 ] the inclination to the line of sight of the stellar rotation axis if the anomalous projected rotation is due to spin - orbit misalignment along the line of sight .",
    "i also note published rm measurements for four of the systems i identify as apparent slow projected rotators ; hat - p-7 and wasp-14 has been identified as a spin - orbit misaligned system @xcite , while hd 17156 and tres-4 are consistent with spin - orbit alignment in the plane of the sky @xcite .    though hd 17156 is consistent with spin - orbit alignment in the plane of the sky from rm measurements , my technique measures misalignment along the line of sight .",
    "there is other circumstantial evidence that hd 17156 is misaligned along the line of sight .",
    "@xcite measured a @xmath67 km s@xmath41 , a stellar radius @xmath68 and used ca ii h and k to infer a rotation period @xmath69 days . if the system has @xmath70 , then a period @xmath69 days and the inferred stellar radius @xmath68 implies @xmath71 km s@xmath41 ( as compared to @xmath72 km s@xmath41 expected based on my simple model ) .",
    "clearly , it s possible that in this case the activity indicator gives a spurious period estimate ; still , if the discrepancy is due to misalignment then @xmath73 ( as compared to @xmath74 degrees from my measurement ) .",
    "tres-4 is consistent with alignment in the plane of the sky from measurements of the rm effect .",
    "however , that is a different angle than that measured through my analysis",
    ". it could be that the geometry of the tres-4 system is apparently aligned in the plane of the sky but misaligned along the line of sight ; alternatively , tres-4 could simply be an anomalously slow rotator .",
    "i find that ten of the 75 systems in table  [ tbl-1 ] have anomalously slow projected rotation and are likely spin - orbit misaligned along the line of sight .",
    "in contrast , the latest rossiter - mclaughlin measurements reported and summarized in triaud et al .",
    "( 2010 , submitted ) suggest that eight of the 26 systems with rm measurements have significant spin - orbit misalignment in the plane of the sky . the higher fraction of systems observed to be misaligned by the rm effect",
    "is expected , as the rm effect can detect much smaller degrees of misalignment than the coarser technique described here .",
    "assume for the moment that the smallest degree of misalignment this technique can identify is @xmath75 ( as suggested by the minimum difference from table  [ tbl-2 ] ) .",
    "of the 26 systems with measurements of the rm effect , six have @xmath76 . at the same time",
    ", the slightly higher incidence of misaligned systems in the sample of rm measurements might be related to the fact that rm measurements are resource intensive .",
    "that is , systems that seem to have a higher a priori probability of spin - orbit misalignment based on the current understanding of spin - orbit misalignment ( e.g. eccentric systems ) are more likely to be targeted for rm measurement .",
    "the fact that this analysis includes all known transiting exoplanet systems without the targeting biases inherent in the current sample of rm measurements may even produce a less biased spin - orbit misalignment distribution .",
    "i identify ten host stars of transiting exoplanet systems in which either the host star is more slowly rotating relative to the simple model than any of the stars in the control sample of spocs stars or in which the star is viewed pole - on and the system is spin - orbit misaligned .",
    "this degeneracy can be broken for at least kepler-5 and kepler-7 , as high precision kepler photometry should reveal their rotation periods .",
    "if the periods are indeed short , then the small observed @xmath11 indicates spin - orbit misalignment along the line of sight .",
    "alternatively , if the observed rotation periods are long , then kepler-5 and kepler-7 are systems in which the host star has somehow lost angular momentum much more quickly than expected by models of sun - like stellar spin - down .",
    "high precision photometry from other sources might enable similar measurements for the other systems identified as anomalously slow projected rotators .",
    "all ten of the candidate misaligned systems have host stars more massive than the sun . to determine the significance of this observation",
    ", i performed a monte carlo simulation in which i randomly selected with replacement ten stars from the 75 listed in table  [ tbl-1 ] .",
    "i repeated this process 10@xmath77 times .",
    "less than 0.01% of the monte carlo trials produced a sample in which all ten stars had @xmath78 .",
    "therefore , the probability that all ten candidate misaligned systems would be identified around massive stars by chance is less than one in ten thousand .",
    "similarly , the median mass of the planets in the candidate misaligned systems is @xmath79 jupiter - masses , while the median mass of the whole sample of 75 systems is @xmath80 jupiter - masses .",
    "interestingly , there may be a hint of the same apparent overrepresentation of massive planets in spin - orbit misaligned systems from rossiter - mclaughlin measurements @xcite .",
    "eccentricity also seems to be related to misalignment probability .",
    "indeed , of the nine transiting systems with fgk stellar hosts and eccentricity @xmath81 ( hd 80606 , hd 17156 , hat - p-2 , wasp-8 , xo-3 , hat - p-11 , wasp-17 , corot-9 , and hat - p-14 ) , there is now evidence from either measurements of the rm effect or this analysis that six of those systems are significantly misaligned ( hd 80606 , hd 17156 , wasp-8 , xo-3 , wasp-17 , and hat - p-14 ) .",
    "the other three systems are unlikely to be observed to be spin - orbit misaligned for a number of reasons : hat - p-2 is likely an intrinsically fast - rotator and therefore unlikely to be identified as misaligned along the line of sight by the method described in this paper even if it does have significant spin - orbit misalignment along the line of sight , hat - p-11 may have too small a radius for measurements of the rm effect , and corot-9 has the largest pericenter distance by far of the known transiting planets and almost certainly has had a different evolutionary history than the other known transiting planets . to determine the significance of the apparent correlation between eccentricity and spin - orbit misalignment , i performed a monte carlo simulation to determine the expected number of systems with eccentricity @xmath81 from a sample of 16 transiting systems  the total number of significantly misaligned systems from rm measurements and this analysis ",
    "expected if spin - orbit misalignment is unrelated to eccentricity .",
    "i randomly selected with replacement the eccentricities of 16 planets from the 75 systems listed in table  [ tbl-1 ] , and i repeated this process 10@xmath77 times .",
    "i find that the mean number of systems with @xmath81 in a sample of 16 systems under the assumption that eccentricity is unrelated to spin - orbit misalignment is @xmath82 .",
    "the observation of six systems with @xmath81 from a random sample of 16 systems occurs in less than one in 150 trials , indicating that eccentricity and spin - orbit misalignment are related .    in an attempt to derive some constraint on the underlying spin - orbit misalignment distribution in the 75 systems in table  [ tbl-1 ] , i performed two completeness calculations for two different @xmath8 distributions resulting from two different @xmath2 distributions : ( 1 ) corresponding to planet - planet scattering ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , a case in which the inclination of the host star is completely independent of the alignment of the orbit of its planet @xmath83 , where @xmath84 ; and ( 2 ) corresponding to kozai cycles and tidal friction ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , a case in which the distribution of @xmath8 is derived from the @xmath2 distribution as given in figure 10 of @xcite and the @xmath9 distribution as given in the rm compilation in table 5 of triaud et al .",
    "( 2010 , submitted ) .",
    "assuming a threshold detectable misalignment that corresponds to the smallest degree of misalignment identified ( @xmath85 ) in 75 systems , i find that the expected number of detections in case ( 1 ) is @xmath86 and in case ( 2 ) it is @xmath87 .",
    "even though each individual system in this analysis is securely identified as an anomalously slow projected rotator and therefore possibly spin - orbit misaligned , both completeness calculations are strongly dependent on the smallest degree of misalignment this technique can identify . that quantity is uncertain , and as such more data is necessary before any conclusive statements about distribution of spin - orbit alignments is made .",
    "the full sample of kepler transiting planet detections and host star properties available at the end of its four year mission might resolve this issue .",
    "collectively , this analysis indicates that predictions of spin - orbit misalignment for a population of close - in planets entirely produced by planet - planet scattering or kozai cycles with tidal friction overpredict the number of misaligned systems . as a result",
    ", there seems to be two populations of close - in planets : a population that is spin - orbit aligned and a population that is apparently spin - orbit misaligned .",
    "the processes that lead to misalignment or to the survival of misaligned systems seem to operates most efficiently in systems with massive host stars and planets .",
    "indeed , the striking appearance of candidate misaligned systems at @xmath88 in figure  [ fig04 ] indicates that the processes that lead to spin - orbit misalignment and survival are threshold processes , similar to the rapid increase in exoplanet incidence with host stellar metallicity ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    ". in this case , the transition to frequent apparent spin - orbit misalignment occurs at the same stellar mass at which sun - like stars with near solar metallicity develop radiative envelopes .",
    "this dramatic change in stellar structure will likely strongly effect the poorly - understood tidal processes that play a major role in the formation , evolution , and long - term survival of spin - orbit misaligned systems .",
    "there are ten transiting exoplanet systems from a larger sample of 75 systems in which the projected rotation velocity of the host star assuming spin - orbit alignment is apparently smaller relative to a simple empirical model of stellar spin - down than any of 866 stars in a representative control sample of stars in the same mass range from the spectroscopic properties of cool stars ( spocs ) catalog : hat - p-7 , hat - p-14 , hat - p-16 , hd 17156 , kepler-5 , kepler-7 , tres-4 , wasp-1 , wasp-12 , and wasp-14 . unless the host stars of these transiting exoplanets are slower rotators relative to the model prediction than any of the 866 stars in the representative control sample , the anomalously low @xmath11 values",
    "are best explained by a pole - on view of the star and therefore spin - orbit misalignment .",
    "i only identify significant possible spin - orbit misalignment in systems with host stars more massive than the sun , as in all ten systems the host stars have stellar masses @xmath0 in the range @xmath89 .",
    "this observation is significant , as there is less than a one in ten thousand chance of its occurrence by chance .",
    "there is evidence that systems with massive and eccentric planets are also those most likely to be significantly spin - orbit misaligned . given current measurements of the rossiter - mclaughlin effect and frequency of misalignment along the line of sight determined in this analysis , models of close - in planet formation invoking planet - planet scattering or kozai cycles and tidal friction alone",
    "overpredict the number of misaligned systems . as a result",
    ", there seems to be two populations of close - in planets : those that are aligned and those that are apparently misaligned .",
    "the process that leads to misalignment or survival of misaligned systems likely operates more efficiently in systems with both massive stars and planets .",
    "interestingly , apparently misaligned systems appear to occur preferentially in systems in which the envelope of the host star is radiative , and this transition in stellar structure is likely related through tidal processes to the formation , evolution , and long - term survival of spin - orbit misaligned systems .",

    "<S> there has lately been intense interest in the degree of alignment between the orbits of transiting exoplanets and the spin of their hosts stars . indeed , of 26 transiting exoplanet systems with measurements of the rossiter - mclaughlin ( rm ) effect , eight have now been found to be significantly spin - orbit misaligned in the plane of the sky . </S>",
    "<S> unfortunately , the rm effect only measures the angle between the orbit of a transiting exoplanet and the spin of its host star projected in the plane of sky , leaving unconstrained the compliment misalignment angle between the orbit of the planet and the spin of its host star along the line of sight . </S>",
    "<S> i use a simple model of stellar rotation benchmarked with observational data to statistically identify ten exoplanet systems from a sample of 75 for which there is likely a significant degree of misalignment along the line of sight between the orbit of the planet and the spin of its host star . </S>",
    "<S> i find that hat - p-7 , hat - p-14 , hat - p-16 , hd 17156 , kepler-5 , kepler-7 , tres-4 , wasp-1 , wasp-12 , and wasp-14 are likely spin - orbit misaligned along the line of sight . </S>",
    "<S> all ten systems have host stellar masses @xmath0 in the range @xmath1 , and the probability of this occurrence by chance is less than one in ten thousand . in addition , the planets in the candidate misaligned systems are preferentially massive and eccentric . </S>",
    "<S> i combine the distribution of misalignment in the plane of the sky from rm measurements with the distribution of misalignment along the line of sight from this analysis , and the result suggests that transiting exoplanets are more likely to be aligned along the line of sight than expected given predictions for the spin - orbit misalignment distribution of a population produced entirely by planet - planet scattering or kozai cycles and tidal friction . </S>",
    "<S> for that reason , there are likely two populations of close - in exoplanet systems : a population of aligned systems and a population of apparently misaligned systems in which the processes that lead to misalignment or to the survival of misaligned systems operate more efficiently in systems with massive stars and planets . </S>"
