    "0.3 in the possibility of the existence of pentaquark @xmath0@xmath5has been theoretically discussed for many years.in 1997 , diakonov , petrov , and polyakov , in the framework of the chiral soliton model , predicted a exotic baryon @xmath0 with mass @xmath6,@xmath7,spin 1/2 and isospin 0@xcite . however , the subject has been thrust to the fore- front during the past two years by the experimental discovery of an exotic baryon@xcite.it has @xmath8 quantum numbers(b=+1 , q=+1 , s=+1 ) , and its minimal quark content should be @xmath9 .",
    "the remarkable features of the @xmath0 are its small mass ( 1540mev ) and very narrow width ( @xmath1025mev)@xcite.the discovery of the exotic baryon @xmath11 with positive strangeness opens new possibilities of forming exotic @xmath11 hypernuclei as same as in the case of negative strangeness @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 hypernuclei .",
    "d. cabrera et al have suggested that @xmath11 could be bound in nuclei and calculated self energy of the @xmath11 pentaquark in nuclei@xcite.they shown that the in - medium renormalization of the pion in the two meson cloud of the @xmath11 leads to a sizable attraction , enough to produce a large number of bound and narrow @xmath11 states in nuclei .",
    "on other hand , the relativistic mean field approximation have been a widely used and successful approach to describe properties of nuclear matter and finite nuclei@xcite.the density dependent relativistic hadron ( ddrh ) theory was introduced previously as an effective field theory for isospin nuclei@xcite.in ddrh theory the meson - baryon interactions is described by meson - nucleon vertices which are functionals of the fermion field operators.the coupling coefficients are not constants but field operators.ddrh theory reduces to a hartree description with density dependent coupling constants similar to the initial proposal of brockmann and toki in mean - field approximation and its development has been achieved a significant progress in recent years@xcite.for including the scalar isovector @xmath15 meson , ddrh is successfully applied to asymmetric matter at extreme neutron - to - proton ratios@xcite .    in the present paper",
    "we attempt to extend ddrh theory to inclusions of pentaquark @xmath0 and investigate properties of matter with inclusions of @xmath0.we study medium modifications within the mean field theory and get the mass modifications of baryons in-medium.we calculate the binding energy at different baryon fractions.we find the system becomes more bound with inclusions of @xmath0 but when too much @xmath0 added it becomes less bound .",
    "the critical fraction of @xmath0 is 0.56 in isospin symmetric matter and it becomes lower in isospin symmetric matter .",
    "the isospin effects on the effective mass and the binding energy are also discussed .finally , we calculate the minimum of binding energy and the fractions of all baryons as functions of baryon density when the system is the most stable .",
    "0.3 in the density dependent relativistic hadron field theory has been proven to give a good description of nuclear matter in bulk and of the properties of finite nucle@xcite .assuming the interaction between nucleons and mesons is similar to @xmath0 and meson , we start from the effective lagrangian density which includes pentaquark @xmath11 @xmath16 @xmath17    @xmath18    @xmath19    where    @xmath20    here,@xmath21 and @xmath22 are the free baryonic and the free mesonic lagrangians , respectively , and interactions are defined by @xmath23.the meson fields are denoted by @xmath24,@xmath25 , @xmath26 , and @xmath27 , and their masses by @xmath28 , @xmath29,@xmath30 and @xmath31 , respectively . the isospin pauli matrices are written as @xmath32 , @xmath33 being the third component of @xmath32 . for exotic baryon @xmath0 , as we assume isospin @xmath34 , @xmath35 , there is no coupling to @xmath36 and @xmath15 mesons.the main difference to ddrh theory in ref.@xcite is that the lagrangian density includes the interactions of pentaquark @xmath0 and mesons.in contrast to standard qhd models@xcite , the meson - baryon vertices @xmath37 ( @xmath38 ) are not constant numbers but the baryon field operators @xmath39 dependent .    in the mean field",

    "the baryon fraction is @xmath90 the energy per baryon for multi - theta matter is defined @xmath91",
    "0.3 in we first calculate the effective baryonic masses with different @xmath0 fractions in isospin symmetric matter and isospin asymmetric matter.the results are presented in fig.1(a ) and fig.1(b).it is shown that the effective masses all decrease as the baryon density increases , whether the nucleons or the @xmath0.the isospin effects on the effective nucleon mass can not be neglected due to the interaction between the scalar isovector @xmath15,especially at high density.the neutron - proton(n / p ) effective mass splits.but the effects on the @xmath92 is negligible.the effective theta masses always decrease more slowly than the nucleons.the fraction @xmath93 can also affect on baryonic masses.at the same baryon density , the baryonic masses all increase with more conclusion of pentaquark @xmath0 .",
    "fig.2(a ) shows the binding energy in isospin symmetry matter.we plot the binding energy with different @xmath0 fractions.our calculation show that the binding energy is sensitive to the variation of the @xmath0 fraction.the absolute minimum of binding energy increases until the @xmath0 fraction reaches about 0.23,witch is up to nearly 24mev at the baryon density 1.4@xmath94.but when the fraction of @xmath0 reaches to 0.56,the system becomes not bound anymore .",
    "the binding energy of the system without proton is presented in fig.2(b).the system with inclusion of a small fraction of pentaquark @xmath0 becomes stable.the absolute minimum reaches the peak at the fraction 0.3.more @xmath0 added , system becomes less bound.when the percent of pentaquark @xmath0 reaches to half an whole , system becomes unstable again.it shows that the binding is also sensitive to the isospin by comparing with the curves in fig.2(a ) .",
    "minimizing the @xmath95 with respect to @xmath93 and @xmath96,we got the minimum of the binding energy.the results are given in in fig.3.it is shown that the minimum of binding energy occurs at the density about 1.5@xmath94.in low - density region(@xmath97),the binding energy increases with the increasing baryon density.the opposite dependence occurs in hight - density region(@xmath98 ) .",
    "fig.3(b ) displays the fractions of neutron , proton and pentaquark @xmath0 as calculated by minimizing the energy.the curves display the neutron - to - proton ratio is near 1:1.it is easily to comprehend since the asymmetric nuclear matter is more stable than symmetric matter .    in summary",
    ", we calculate the multi - theta matter could be bound in the framework of density dependent relativistic hadron field theory.it seems possible that there is a large fraction of pentaquark @xmath0.whether nucleons or pentaquark @xmath0,it s effective mass in - medium is decreasing with the increasing baryon density.but effective mass of pentaquark @xmath0 is larger than that of the @xmath99 .",
