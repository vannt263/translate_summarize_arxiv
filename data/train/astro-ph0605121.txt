    "an important goal of star formation research is the development of an understanding of the formation of molecular clouds , since these clouds host all observed galactic star formation .",
    "the main constituent of these clouds is molecular hydrogen , @xmath0 , which forms in the interstellar medium ( ism ) on the surface of dust grains , as its formation in the gas phase by radiative association occurs at a negligibly slow rate @xcite .",
    "the basic physics of @xmath0 formation on dust is believed to be well understood , although uncertainties remain about various issues such as the relative importance of physisorption versus chemisorption ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) or the role of dust grain porosity @xcite .    however , many other questions remain unanswered . in particular",
    ", there is little consensus regarding the physical mechanism responsible for cloud formation .",
    "one school of thought holds that molecular clouds are transient objects , formed and then dispersed on a timescale of only a few million years by the action of large - scale turbulent flows in the interstellar medium ( ism ) , which are themselves driven by energy input from supernovae and from the magnetorotational instability @xcite .",
    "several lines of evidence in favour of this picture , such as the absence of post - t tauri stars with ages greater than @xmath3 in local star forming regions , are discussed by @xcite .",
    "an alternative school of thought holds that clouds are gravitationally bound objects in virial equilibrium which evolve on timescales of the order of @xmath4 or longer , and are supported by magnetic pressure @xcite , or by turbulence driven by the expansion of internal h  ii regions@xcite . in this picture , it is easier to reconcile the observed mass of molecular gas in the galaxy ( @xmath5 ; @xcite ) with the inferred galactic star formation rate ( @xmath6 ; @xcite ) without requiring the average star formation efficiency of molecular clouds to be very small .",
    "one argument often advanced in favour of longer cloud lifetimes is the apparent difficulty involved in producing sufficient @xmath0 in only one or two myr to explain observed clouds , given the relatively slow rate at which @xmath0 forms in the ism .",
    "the @xmath0 formation timescale in the ism is approximately @xcite @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the number density in @xmath9 , which suggests that in gas with a mean number density @xmath10 , characteristic of most giant molecular clouds @xcite , conversion from atomic to molecular form should take at least @xmath4 , longer than the entire lifetime of a transient cloud .",
    "however , estimates of this kind do not take account of dynamical processes such as supersonic turbulence or thermal instability which may exert a great deal of influence on the effective @xmath0 formation rate",
    ". the impact of these processes can be investigated through the use of numerical modelling , but in most models published to date either the dynamics of the gas have been highly simplified , with the flow restricted to one or two dimensions and with only highly ordered large - scale flows considered ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , or insufficient chemistry has been included to address the question at hand ( e.g.  @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite  2002a , b ,  2004 ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .    in (",
    "* hereafter paper i ) we described how we have modified the publicly available zeus - mp hydrodynamical code @xcite to allow us to accurately simulate the thermal balance of the atomic and molecular gas in the ism , and to follow the growth of the molecular hydrogen fraction with time .",
    "an important feature of our approach is the use of simple approximations to treat the effects of @xmath0 self - shielding and dust shielding , allowing us to approximate the @xmath0 destruction rate without requiring us to solve the radiative transfer equation for the photodissociating radiation , which could only be done at a prohibitively high computational cost .",
    "we also presented results from some simple tests of our modified code and showed that it produces physically reasonable results .",
    "finally , we used our modified code to model molecular cloud formation by the gravitational collapse of quasi - uniform , initially static gas .",
    "we showed that in this scenario , large - scale conversion of atomic to molecular gas occurs on a timescale @xmath11 , equivalent to at least 12 free - fall times ( for simulations performed with our canonical value for the initial gas number density , @xmath12 ) .",
    "in the current paper , we present results from a set of simulations performed with a supersonically turbulent initial velocity field , and show that the presence of turbulence dramatically reduces the time required to form large quantities of @xmath0 . in supersonically turbulent gas ,",
    "the large density compressions created by the turbulence allow @xmath0 to form rapidly , with large molecular fractions being produced after only 12  myr , consistent with the timescale required by rapid cloud formation models .",
    "we also find evidence that much of the @xmath0 is formed in high density gas and then transported to lower densities by the action of the turbulence , a phenomenon that may have a significant impact on the chemistry of the ism @xcite .",
    "the plan of this paper is as follows . in   [ numeric ] , we briefly describe the numerical method we use to simulate the gas and in   [ init_cond ]",
    "we discuss the initial conditions used for our simulations . in",
    "  [ timescale ] , we examine the timescale for @xmath0 formation in turbulent gas , and in   [ mol_distrib ] we analyze the resulting distribution of the molecular gas . in ",
    "[ thermo ] , we discuss the temperature distribution of the gas and its evolution with time , and also examine the behaviour of the effective polytropic index , @xmath13 . in ",
    "[ sense ] we examine how sensitive our results are to variations of our initial conditions .",
    "we conclude in   [ summary ] with a summary of our results .",
    "we solve the equations of fluid flow for the gas in the ism using a modified version of the zeus - mp hydrodynamical code @xcite .",
    "our modifications are based on those developed for zeus-3d by @xcite and @xcite , which in turn are built on earlier work by @xcite , and involve two major changes to the code .",
    "first , we have added a limited treatment of non - equilibrium chemistry to the code .",
    "we treat the chemistry in an operator split fashion . during the source step",
    ", we solve the coupled set of chemical rate equations for the fluid , together with the portion of the internal energy equation dealing with compressional and radiative heating and cooling , under the assumption that the other hydrodynamical variables ( e.g.  density ) remain fixed . during the subsequent advection step , we advect tracer fields which track the abundances of the chemical species of interest and which advect as densities , while the internal energy is advected as it would be in the unmodified version of zeus - mp .",
    "for stability , we solve the coupled equations implicitly , using gauss - seidel iteration . on the rare occasions that the iteration fails to converge , we use a more expensive bisection algorithm that is guaranteed to find a solution .    to improve the efficiency of the code ,",
    "we make use of subcycling .",
    "since the cooling time is generally much shorter than the chemical timescale for gas with the range of physical conditions of interest in this study , we evolve both the chemical rate equations and the energy equation on a cooling timestep , @xmath14 , given by : @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the net rate at which the gas gains or loses energy due to radiative and chemical heating and cooling : in the convention used in our code , @xmath17 corresponds to cooling and @xmath18 to heating",
    ". often , @xmath14 will be much shorter than the hydrodynamical timestep , @xmath19 , which is calculated as detailed in @xcite . in that case ,",
    "rather than constraining the code to evolve the hydrodynamics on the cooling timestep , we allow the chemistry code to subcycle : to take multiple source steps , each of length @xmath14 , until the total elapsed time is equal to @xmath19 .",
    "the cooling time is recomputed following every chemistry and cooling substep , and the code also ensures that the total elapsed time can not exceed @xmath19 by shortening the last substep ( if required ) . to further improve the efficiency of the code , our implementation of subcycling functions at the level of individual grid zones , so that only zones for which @xmath20 are subcycled .    in our chemical model ,",
    "we adopt standard solar abundances for hydrogen and helium , together with metal abundances taken from @xcite .",
    "we assume that metals with ionization potential less than that of atomic hydrogen ( e.g.  carbon , silicon ) remain singly ionized throughout the calculation , and that metals with ionization potentials greater than that of hydrogen ( e.g.  helium , nitrogen ) remain neutral .",
    "the ionization state of oxygen , which has very nearly the same ionization potential as hydrogen , is assumed to track that of hydrogen , owing to the influence of rapid charge transfer reactions .",
    "we also assume that minor ions such as @xmath21 , @xmath22 or @xmath23 can be ignored , and so are left with only four species of interest : free electrons , @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath0 .",
    "the abundances of these four species are constrained by two conservation laws  conservation of charge and of the number of hydrogen nuclei  and so only two of these species need to be tracked directly .",
    "we choose to follow the abundances of @xmath0 and @xmath24 .",
    "the reactions included in our chemical model , and further details including justification of our simplifying approximations , are given in paper i. we discuss photodissociation further below .",
    "the second major modification to the zeus - mp code that we have made is to incorporate a detailed treatment of the radiative and chemical heating and cooling of the gas .",
    "the main heat source in gas with a low level of extinction is photoelectric heating ( caused by the ejection of photoelectrons from dust grains and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons illuminated by photons with energies in the range @xmath26 ) , while in gas with high extinction , cosmic ray heating dominates .",
    "our treatment of these processes is based on @xcite ( as modified by @xcite ) and @xcite respectively , with the effects of extinction modelled using the approximation discussed in   [ shield ] below .",
    "the main coolants at the temperatures and densities of interest in our simulations are the fine structure lines of @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "we compute the cooling from these species exactly , using atomic data from a variety of sources ( see paper i ) .",
    "we also include heating and cooling from a variety of other processes , which are generally of lesser importance , and which are also summarized in paper i.      following @xcite , we assume that the @xmath0 photodissociation rate can be written as the sum of an optically thin rate , @xmath31 , and two separate shielding factors , @xmath32 and @xmath33 that account for the effects of @xmath0 self - shielding and dust shielding respectively : @xmath34 for the optically thin rate , we adopt the expression @xmath35 where we have assumed that the ultraviolet ( uv ) field has the same spectral shape as the @xcite field , and where @xmath36 is a dimensionless factor which characterizes the intensity of the field at @xmath37  relative to the @xcite field ; note that for the original @xcite field , @xmath38 .",
    "to treat the effects of self - shielding , we use the approximation for @xmath32 suggested by @xcite : @xmath39 , \\label{fsh}\\ ] ] where @xmath40 , with @xmath41 being the @xmath0 column density between the fluid element and the source of the uv radiation , and with @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is the doppler broadening parameter .    as in paper",
    "i , we use two different approximation to compute @xmath41 for every grid zone . in most of our simulations ,",
    "we use a local shielding approximation . in this approximation",
    ", we assume that the dominant contribution to the self - shielding of any given fluid element comes from gas in the immediate vicinity of that element , and consequently approximate @xmath41 as : @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the @xmath0 number density in the zone of interest and @xmath46 is the width of the zone , measured parallel to one of the coordinate axes . note",
    "that since our grid zones are cubical , the choice of axis is immaterial .",
    "this approximation is intended to capture , in a crude fashion , the effects on @xmath0 self - shielding of the significant doppler shifts along any particular line of sight .    in a few simulations , however , we use an approach that we referred to in paper i as the six - ray shielding approximation . in this approach , we compute an effective @xmath0 column density for each grid zone by first computing exact values along a small number of lines of sight and then averaging these values appropriately . to simplify the implementation , the lines of sight are chosen to be parallel to the coordinate axes of the grid .",
    "an approach of this type has previously been used by @xcite and @xcite . to treat shielding due to dust",
    ", we use a similar approach .",
    "we follow @xcite and write @xmath33 as @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the optical depth due to dust at a wavelength of @xmath49 , @xmath50 is the corresponding effective attenuation cross - section ( which has a value @xmath51 for the diffuse ism ) , and @xmath52 is the total column density of hydrogen nuclei between the zone of interest and the source of the uv .",
    "to compute @xmath52 , we use the same approximations as described above .",
    "in other words , when we use the local shielding approximation , we assume that the dominant contribution to @xmath52 comes from local gas , and so write it as : @xmath53 while in the six - ray approximation , we again compute it exactly along a small number of lines of sight .",
    "the main advantage of our local shielding approximation ( aside from its simplicity and speed ) is the fact that it allows us to be certain that we are _ underestimating _ the true amount of shielding and hence _ overestimating _ the @xmath0 photodissociation rate in simulations that use it .",
    "we can therefore be confident that the @xmath0 fractions computed in these simulation are lower limits on the true values and hence that the timescales for @xmath0 formation that we find are _ upper limits _ on the actual values . as we will see later",
    ", this fact serves to strengthen the conclusions that we draw from these simulations .",
    "a major disadvantage of our local shielding approximation is that they make the photodissociation rate depend explicitly on the numerical resolution @xmath46 .",
    "consequently , the equilibrium @xmath0 abundance , @xmath54 , also becomes resolution dependent , as can easily be seen from the following equation for @xmath54 @xmath55 where @xmath8 is the number density of hydrogen nuclei , @xmath56 is the formation rate of @xmath0 on dust grain surfaces , @xmath57 , and where the @xmath0 abundance @xmath58 is defined such that @xmath59 .",
    "it must also be said that the physical justification for treating dust shielding using the local approximation is somewhat lacking since the shielding provided by the dust should not be significantly affected by doppler shifts along the line of sight . in paper i , we saw that for initially static , uniform density gas , these drawbacks are very serious and results obtained using the local approximation are of questionable accuracy .",
    "however , in the turbulent flows studied in the present paper , the performance of the local shielding approximation is very much better , as we will see in   [ timescale ] & [ mol_distrib ] below .",
    "a major disadvantage of the six - ray approximation is the extremely coarse angular resolution of the radiation field that it provides .",
    "this poor angular resolution will cause us to overestimate the amount of shielding in some regions , and underestimate it in others : the precise details will depend on the particular form of the density field , but in general we will tend to underestimate the amount of shielding whenever the volume filling factor of dense gas is small . on the other hand , the fact that this approach does not take account of velocity structure along any of the lines of sight means that it may significantly overestimate @xmath32 in a supersonically turbulent flow .",
    "it is therefore difficult to determine whether the amount of @xmath0 produced in simulations using this method is an overestimate or an underestimate of the true amount . for the main problem that we are interested in investigating  the determination of the @xmath0 formation rate in dynamically evolving ,",
    "cold atomic gas  this is problematic , as it may lead us to derive an artificially short timescale for @xmath0 formation . in view of this , we have adopted the local shielding approximation in most of our simulations , and have run only a few simulations using the six - ray approximation for the purposes of comparison .",
    "as we will see later , the results of these simulations agree surprisingly well with those of simulations using the local approximation .",
    "finally , we note that to compute the effect of the dust shielding on the photoelectric heating rate , we again use a very similar approximation : we use our value of @xmath52 computed above to calculate @xmath60 , the extinction of the gas in the v band , and then compute the photoelectric heating rate using a radiation field strength attenuated by a factor @xmath61 , as suggested by @xcite .",
    "since our aim in this paper is to model the transition from atomic to molecular gas , we have chosen to consider relatively small volumes , which we visualize as being smaller sub - regions within larger , gravitationally collapsing clouds of gas , such as those found in the simulations of @xcite or @xcite .",
    "we therefore consider a cubical volume of size @xmath62 , and apply periodic boundary conditions to all sides of the cube .",
    "as we discussed in paper i , in choosing a value for @xmath62 we aimed to strike a reasonable balance between simulating a large , representative region of a cloud ( which argues for large @xmath62 ) and maximizing our physical resolution for any given numerical resolution ( which argues for small @xmath62 ) . for most of the simulations presented here , we settled on @xmath63 as an appropriate value , but in   [ turb_box ] we examine the effects of varying @xmath62 .",
    "the value of @xmath62 used in each simulation is summarized in table  [ turb_runs ] , together with the values used for our other adjustable parameters .    within the box",
    ", we assumed an initially uniform distribution of gas , characterized by an initial number density @xmath64 . in most of our simulations ,",
    "we take @xmath12 as this value is consistent with the inferred mean densities of many observed molecular clouds @xcite . however , in ",
    "[ turb_n0 ] we explore the effects of reducing @xmath64 .",
    "atomic gas with @xmath65 lies well within the cold neutral medium regime @xcite and has a short cooling time ( @xmath66 ) , and so our results are insensitive to the initial temperature @xmath67 . in most of our simulations ,",
    "we adopt a rather arbitrary initial temperature @xmath68 , but as we demonstrate in   [ temp ] , simulations with @xmath69 produce essentially identical results for times @xmath70 .      since there is now considerable observational evidence for the presence of dynamically significant magnetic fields in interstellar gas @xcite , we included a magnetic field in the majority of our simulations . for simplicity , in simulations where a field was present , we assumed that it was initially uniform and oriented parallel to the @xmath71-axis of the simulation .",
    "the strength of the field was a free parameter , and the values used in our various simulations are summarized in table  [ turb_runs ] .",
    "observational determinations of the local magnetic field strength give a typical value of @xmath72 g , and so we ensured that our fiducial value for the initial magnetic field strength , @xmath73 , was consistent with this value .",
    "our choice of this slightly odd value was motivated by our desire that the mass - to - flux ratio of the gas should be some simple multiple of the critical value @xcite @xmath74 at which magnetic pressure balances gravity in an isothermal slab . for a fully atomic cloud of gas",
    ", the mass - to - flux ratio can be written in units of this critical value as @xcite @xmath75 where @xmath76 is column density of atomic hydrogen in units of @xmath77 and @xmath78 is the strength of the magnetic field , in units of @xmath79 . for a simulation with a box size of @xmath80 and an initial atomic hydrogen number density @xmath12 ,",
    "this gives @xmath81 , where @xmath82 is the initial magnetic field strength ( in units of @xmath79 ) , and so if @xmath83 , then @xmath84 .",
    "observations of magnetic field strengths in molecular cloud cores , summarized in @xcite and @xcite , find a smaller mean value , @xmath85 , but there is significant scatter around this value , and in any case it is far from clear that we would expect to find the same value of @xmath86 in dense cloud cores as we would find in the much lower density neutral atomic gas .",
    "in addition to this fiducial case , we ran simulations with a number of other initial field strengths , as detailed in table  [ turb_runs ] and in   [ mag_field ] .",
    "we generate the initial velocity field required for our simulations of turbulent gas by using the method described in @xcite and @xcite . in this method",
    ", we produce values for each component of velocity in each grid zone by drawing values from a gaussian random field constructed to have a flat power spectrum for wavenumbers @xmath87 in the range @xmath88 and zero power outside of that range .",
    "the normalization of the resulting velocity field was then adjusted until the root mean square velocity , @xmath89 , matched a previously specified initial value , @xmath90 .    in most of our simulations , we set @xmath91 .",
    "our choice of this value is motivated by observations of molecular clouds on scales @xmath92 @xcite which find line - of - sight velocity dispersions @xmath93@xmath94 . if due primarily to turbulent motions in the clouds , these velocity dispersions imply rms turbulent velocities in the range @xmath95@xmath96 .",
    "our chosen value lies towards the top end of this range , but in   [ turb_vrms ] we examine the effects of adopting smaller initial values .",
    "finally , it should be noted that in the simulations presented in this paper , we consider only decaying turbulence , i.e.   turbulence which is not maintained by a regular input of kinetic energy , and which therefore largely dissipates within a few turbulent crossing times @xcite . however , we find that significant amounts of @xmath0 form within only 1@xmath97 , before the rms velocity has decayed by more than a factor of two .",
    "we therefore anticipate that the results for driven turbulence would be quite similar .",
    "we hope to investigate this further in future work .",
    "as in paper i , we first consider the formation of @xmath0 in some detail in a set of fiducial simulations differing only in numerical resolution , before going on to consider in later sections the effects of changing the various input parameters .",
    "parameters for the full set of simulations are listed in table  [ turb_runs ] .",
    "the values we adopted for our fiducial runs are an initial density @xmath12 , an initial temperature @xmath68 , an initial rms turbulent velocity @xmath91 , an initial magnetic field strength @xmath98 and a box size @xmath63 . with these parameters",
    ", there is initially @xmath99 of gas in the box , but this number rapidly increases to @xmath100 as the gas cools to a thermal equilibrium temperature of approximately @xmath101 .",
    "this initial period of cooling takes place in less than 0.05  myr , just as in the initially static simulations discussed in paper i. this is a much shorter timescale than the turbulent crossing time of the box , @xmath102 , and so the gas reaches thermal equilibrium before the turbulence has had time to strongly perturb the density structure .",
    "the initial mass - to - flux ratio of the gas in the box is @xmath103 , in units of the critical value .",
    "we performed four runs with these parameters , with numerical resolutions of @xmath104 , @xmath105 , @xmath106 and @xmath107 zones , which we designate as mt64 , mt128 , mt256 and mt512 respectively . in figure  [ h2-mt - fid ]",
    ", we plot the evolution with time in these four runs of the mass - weighted mean molecular fraction , @xmath108 , defined as @xmath109 where @xmath110 is the mass density of @xmath0 in zone @xmath111 , @xmath112 is the volume of zone @xmath111 , @xmath113 is the total mass of hydrogen present in the simulation , and where we sum over all grid zones .",
    "as figure  [ h2-mt - fid ] makes clear , the @xmath0 abundance evolves rapidly in turbulent gas .",
    "large quantities of @xmath0 are produced within a short time , with mass - weighted mean molecular fractions of approximately 40% being produced within only @xmath97 . for comparison , in our fiducial static runs in paper",
    "i , we found that @xmath108 exceeded 40% only for @xmath114 in the run performed using the local shielding approximation ( run ms256 in the notation of paper i ) , and at @xmath115 in the run performed using the six - ray shielding approximation ( run ms256-rt ) .",
    "the latter time is probably the better estimate , but even in this case there is a factor of 34 difference in the @xmath0 formation timescale between the static and turbulent runs .",
    "indeed , @xmath0 forms significantly faster in our fiducial turbulent runs than in a static run in which there was no ultraviolet background and hence no photodissociation of @xmath0 ( run ms256-nr ; in this run , the time at which @xmath116 is again approximately @xmath117 ) .",
    "it is also apparent from figure  [ h2-mt - fid ] that although the evolution of @xmath108 in these simulations shows some dependence on the numerical resolution of the simulation , for reasons which we will explore later , the effect is not large , and the simulations converge on very similar values for @xmath108 after the first couple of megayears of evolution .",
    "figure  [ h2-mt - fid ] therefore demonstrates one of the main results of this paper : _ the timescale for @xmath0 formation in turbulent gas is much shorter than in quiescent gas with the same mean density and large quantities of molecular gas can be produced in turbulent regions within only a few megayears_. as we will see as we proceed , we obtain qualitatively similar results for a wide range of initial conditions .",
    "examination of the evolution of the peak density , @xmath118 , and the rms density , @xmath119 , in our turbulent simulations ( plotted in figure  [ dens - mt ] with thick lines and thin lines respectively ) gives us a strong hint as to why @xmath108 grows so rapidly in turbulent gas .",
    "the turbulence very quickly produces strong compressions in the initially uniform density field , significantly increasing the rms density of the gas within a megayear , and producing large peak densities . at times",
    "@xmath120 , the growth in @xmath119 and @xmath118 slows as the turbulence starts to become fully developed , before accelerating again at @xmath121 ( in the high resolution @xmath106 and @xmath107 runs ) or @xmath122 ( in the lower resolution @xmath104 and @xmath105 runs ) due to the onset of runaway gravitational collapse .",
    "it is clear from figure  [ dens - mt ] that the values of @xmath119 and @xmath118 that we obtain from our simulations have not converged , and therefore that the density field is not fully resolved even in our @xmath107 run .",
    "this is a major cause of the differences apparent in the evolution of @xmath108 in the various runs  in the higher resolution runs , we resolve more of the dense structure , and so form more @xmath0 .",
    "we would expect this trend to continue as we increase the numerical resolution until we reach a point at which the flow is fully resolved . however , as discussed in   4.3.2 of paper i , to fully resolve shocks at the densities of interest",
    "requires a physical resolution of less than 0.001  pc , which we can not realistically achieve with a fixed grid code .",
    "fortunately , these resolution issues do not seem to have a large impact on the values we obtain for @xmath108 ( other than in run mt64 , which is very poorly resolved ) , suggesting that our results are not particularly sensitive to the accuracy with which we can follow the densest parts of the flow . as we shall see in ",
    "[ morph ] , this is probably because dense gas in our simulations quickly becomes almost fully molecular , at which point it clearly ceases to contribute significantly to the growth of @xmath108 .",
    "hence , even fairly large errors in the computed densities in these fully molecular regions have little impact on @xmath108 .",
    "one obvious question is whether the rapid growth in the value of @xmath108 in our simulations is driven directly by gravitational collapse , which we expect to occur much earlier in a supersonically turbulent medium due to the density enhancements created by the turbulence , or whether it is these density enhancements alone that are responsible for the increased rate of @xmath0 formation .",
    "figure  [ dens - mt ] suggests that at early times , it is turbulence which plays the major role , with gravitational collapse becoming important only at later times .    to investigate this point in more detail",
    ", we ran a set of simulations in which we disabled the effects of self - gravity in the code . the results of these simulations , which we denote as mt64-ng , mt128-ng , mt256-ng and mt512-ng are summarized in table  [ xh2_at_end ] , while in figure  [ h2-mt - comp ] we compare the evolution of @xmath108 in the highest resolution simulation , mt512-ng , with its evolution in run mt512 . from the figure it is clear that gravitational collapse is responsible for very little of the @xmath0 formation seen in the simulations .",
    "most of the @xmath0 that forms in our turbulent simulations does so in dense regions that are _ not _ gravitationally bound .",
    "this is an important point , as it means that the rapid @xmath0 formation that we see in our simulations is not specific to the case of gravitationally bound clouds : we would expect to see a similar effect in unbound atomic regions in which significant turbulence is present ( such as the thin , dense sheets formed in the simulations of @xcite or @xcite ) provided that enough gas is present to allow for effective self - shielding of the resulting @xmath0 . indeed , a similar effect has been noted in a different context by @xcite , who simulate the effects of high - speed ( @xmath123 ) , decaying turbulence in dense gas ( @xmath124 ) , and show that following an initial period of dissociation , the @xmath0 reforms rapidly in the turbulent gas .",
    "it is also important to establish how sensitive our results are to the approximations that we have made in order to treat the effects of the uv radiation field . in figure",
    "[ h2-mt - rt]a we compare the time evolution of @xmath108 in run mt256 with its evolution in run mt256-rt , a run performed using the same initial conditions as run mt256 , but which used the six - ray shielding approximation instead of the local shielding approximation .",
    "it is clear that the difference between the two runs is small .",
    "slightly more @xmath0 forms in run mt256-rt , which is just as we would expect given the greater amount of shielding in that run , but the difference between the two runs is no more than 30% at @xmath125 . in this plot",
    "we also show how @xmath108 evolves in the absence of an ultraviolet background , using results from run mt256-nr , which used the same initial conditions as run mt256 , save that @xmath126 .",
    "the results from this run are very similar to those from run mt256-rt .",
    "this figure demonstrates that for supersonically turbulent flow , our approximations work reasonably well . at early times , the rate of growth of @xmath108 is determined primarily by the time taken to form the @xmath0 , which is essentially the same in all three simulations , and so the results agree very well . at later times",
    ", @xmath0 photodissociation begins to have more of an impact in run mt256 , and the results of this run slowly diverge from those of runs mt256-rt and mt256-nr .",
    "the continued agreement of the latter runs indicates that there is enough shielding in run mt256-rt to make @xmath108 almost insensitive to the value of @xmath36 ( at least for the range of values examined here ) .",
    "it may be that the results from this run are closer to the true behaviour than the results of run mt256 .",
    "however , as we can not be certain of whether the value of @xmath108 we obtain from run mt256-rt is an overestimate or an underestimate , whereas we can be certain that the value in run mt256 is an underestimate , we prefer to focus on the latter results , since they allow us to draw conclusions that are more robust .",
    "a further point to investigate is how accurately our simulations can follow @xmath127 , the volume - weighted @xmath0 fraction , defined as @xmath128 where @xmath129 is the @xmath0 fraction in the grid zone with coordinates @xmath111 , and where @xmath130 is the total number of grid zones . in a turbulent simulation , where the distribution of mass is highly inhomogeneous ( see   [ morph ] ) , @xmath127 will be far more sensitive to the behaviour of gas in low - density regions than @xmath108 .",
    "the evolution of @xmath127 in runs mt256 , mt256-rt and mt256-nr is plotted in figure  [ h2-mt - rt]b .",
    "it is clear from the figure that in this case there is more disagreement between the results obtained with our two different shielding approximations , and hence more uncertainty in the true value of @xmath127 .",
    "however , even in this case , the uncertainty is no more than a factor of two at @xmath125 .",
    "the fact that we find better agreement for @xmath108 than for @xmath127 implies that our approximations do a better job of modelling the behaviour of high density , @xmath0-rich regions than of low density , @xmath0-poor regions .",
    "however , this is just what we expect : in regions in which @xmath131 , even large errors in @xmath32 or @xmath33 will cause only small errors in the @xmath0 fraction , whereas in regions with @xmath132 , small errors in @xmath32 or @xmath33 can lead to large errors in the @xmath0 fraction .    finally , it is necessary to address the question of whether gravitationally unstable regions in our turbulent simulations are well - resolved .",
    "@xcite showed that in order to properly resolve collapse and avoid artificial fragmentation , it is necessary to resolve the local jeans length of the gas by at least four grid zones .",
    "in other words , collapse is resolved only while @xmath133 where @xmath46 is the width of a single grid zone , and @xmath134 is the jeans length , given by @xmath135 where @xmath136 is the adiabatic sound speed . since",
    "the densest gas in our simulations is also the coolest and so has the smallest sound speed , we can determine when ( and if ) the truelove criterion is first violated by following the evolution with time of @xmath134 in the grid zone with the highest gas density .",
    "we have done this for each of our simulations , and list the results in table  [ xh2_at_end ] .",
    "we see that in most of our simulations , the truelove criterion is violated within the first 12  myr .",
    "this would appear to call into question our results at later times .",
    "however , as we discussed previously in paper i , the fact that we no longer properly resolve gravitational collapse in dense gas once the truelove criterion is violated does not necessarily invalidate all of our subsequent results : the key question is _ how much _ gas is found in unresolved regions . to quantify this , we examined intermediate output dumps of density , internal energy and @xmath0 fraction from each of our standard runs , determined which zones were unresolved in each case , and computed the fraction of the total gas mass in resolved regions , @xmath137 , and the fraction of the total @xmath0 mass in the same resolved regions , @xmath138 for every output time for each run .",
    "the values of @xmath137 and @xmath138 that we found at the end of each run are summarized in table  [ fres_at_end ] .",
    "we found that in most of our simulations , we resolved zones containing more than 90% of the mass and of the @xmath0 for the whole duration of the simulation , and that in our highest resolution run ( mt512 ) we resolved more than 99.8% of the mass and 99.4% of the @xmath0 .",
    "the only run in which our resolution was significantly poorer than this was our lowest resolution @xmath104 run mt64 , in which we resolve no more than 5060% of the gas mass and @xmath0 mass .",
    "we therefore argue that any errors we make in following the subsequent evolution of regions that fail to satisfy the truelove criterion will not have a major effect on the evolution of @xmath108 and so will not significantly alter our main conclusions .",
    "in addition to determining the timescale for @xmath0 formation , we would also like to know how the resulting @xmath0 is distributed in the gas .",
    "we can get an immediate visual impression of this by looking at how @xmath58 varies within a planar slice taken from the simulation volume .",
    "for example , in figures  [ h2-mt - slice]a and [ h2-mt - slice]b we show slices through run mt512 at time @xmath139 in the @xmath140-@xmath141 and @xmath140-@xmath71 planes respectively . we have made use of the periodic boundary conditions to orient the datacube so that both figures are centered on the zone with the largest density in the simulation .",
    "these figures demonstrate that the distribution of molecular gas in the box is highly inhomogeneous , with the largest concentrations being found in thin , filamentary structures that fill only a small fraction of the total volume .",
    "comparison of the two figures suggests that there is a higher degree of structure in the @xmath140-@xmath71 plane than in the @xmath140-@xmath141 , possibly due to the fact that the magnetic field is initially aligned parallel to the @xmath71-axis , but the highly ordered structure found in the simulations of magnetized collapse without turbulence analyzed in paper i is clearly absent .",
    "an alternative way of visualizing the @xmath0 distribution is to look at the molecular gas in projection , by computing the @xmath0 column density distribution that would be seen by a distant observer . in figures",
    "[ nh2-mt]a and [ nh2-mt]b , we show the @xmath0 column density distribution that would be seen by an observer looking along the @xmath141 axis or the @xmath71 axis respectively .",
    "these images again highlight the inhomogeneous nature of the @xmath0 distribution , and also demonstrate that considerable small - scale structure exists in this distribution , despite the fact that our initial turbulent velocity field included power only on large scales .",
    "we can study the @xmath0 distribution in a more quantitative fashion by examining how the @xmath0 fraction varies with density . to do this , we computed @xmath58 and @xmath8 for each of the zones in run mt512 at @xmath139 and then binned the data by number density , using bins of width 0.05 dex .",
    "we then computed the mean and standard deviation for @xmath58 in each bin .",
    "the resulting values are plotted in figure  [ xh2vn - mt ] . note that although the mean values we compute here are volume weighted , we would not expect the mass weighted values to differ greatly , since the narrow width of our density bins means that there is little variation in the gas mass from zone to zone within a given bin .",
    "we also plot in figure  [ xh2vn - mt ] the mean value of @xmath54 for each density bin , computed using the local shielding approximation .",
    "three features of figure  [ xh2vn - mt ] deserve particular comment .",
    "first , it is clear that there is considerable scatter in the value of @xmath58 at a given density .",
    "comparison with the plots of @xmath58 versus @xmath8 presented in paper i for smoothly collapsing gas shows that the scatter is much greater in the turbulent case . despite this , however , there is still an obvious underlying trend in the distribution of @xmath58 with @xmath8 , which runs in the direction that we would expect ( i.e.  high density gas is more highly molecular than low density gas ) .",
    "second , even though @xmath142 at this point in the simulation , there are already regions where the @xmath0 fraction is very much higher , and indeed gas with a number density @xmath143 is already almost entirely molecular .",
    "finally , comparison of the distribution of @xmath58 with @xmath8 with the equilibrium distribution ( computed using the same local shielding approximation as is used in the simulation , and given by the dashed line in figure  [ xh2vn - mt ] ) indicates that in most of the gas , the @xmath0 fraction has yet to reach equilibrium . for densities in the range @xmath144",
    ", the actual @xmath0 fraction lies below the equilibrium curve , indicating that the @xmath0 fraction in this gas is still growing .",
    "more interestingly , in gas with @xmath145 , the mean @xmath58 lies _ above _ the equilibrium curve , implying that the @xmath0 fraction in this gas must be decreasing : in other words , more @xmath0 is being destroyed by photodissociation than is being formed on dust grains . to confirm that this interpretation is correct ,",
    "we have computed the values of the formation and photodissociation rates of @xmath0 for each grid zone in run mt512 at @xmath139 .",
    "the resulting values were binned in a similar fashion to the @xmath0 abundance , and the mean values in each density bin are plotted in figure  [ dxh2-mt ] .",
    "as we can see , the formation rate is larger than the photodissociation rate in gas with @xmath146 , but is smaller than the photodissociation rate in gas with @xmath145 .",
    "since our simulations start with fully atomic gas , there are only two ways to explain the fact that @xmath58 exceeds @xmath54 at low densities : either @xmath54 must have been much higher in the past , or some ( or all ) of the molecular content of the low density gas must have actually formed in higher density gas and then been transported to lower densities by the action of the turbulence . of these two explanations , the first does not appear to be viable  most of the parameters that determine the value of @xmath54 at a given density in our simulations ( such as the strength of the uv background ) are fixed , and the one parameter that does vary , the gas temperature , can not give us the effect we seek . to demonstrate why , we have plotted in figure  [ xh2eq - vt ] the variation of @xmath54 with temperature for gas with a number density @xmath65 .",
    "the mean temperature of the @xmath147 gas in our simulation is approximately @xmath148 , and the corresponding value of @xmath54 is indicated in figure  [ xh2eq - vt ] by a cross . from the figure it is clear that if the temperature were slightly higher at early times in the simulation ( i.e.  if @xmath149300  k ) , then @xmath54 may also have been slightly higher , but at most by about 20% . on the hand ,",
    "if the temperature had been much higher , or much lower , then @xmath54 would have been smaller than its present value .",
    "given that we find a mean value of @xmath58 at @xmath65 that is actually five times greater than the equilibrium value , it is clear that temperature variations at earlier times can be responsible for no more than a small portion of this excess , and that most or all of it must therefore be due to the transport of @xmath0 from high density regions to low density regions .    to test this hypothesis , we performed several simulations at @xmath106 resolution in which we artifically suppressed @xmath0 formation in gas with a number density smaller than some threshold value @xmath150 . in runs mt256-th3e2 , mt256-th1e3 and mt256-th3e3 we used values for @xmath150 of 300 , 1000 , and @xmath151 respectively .",
    "our standard set of input parameters were used for all three runs . in figure  [ h2-mt - nth ] , we show how @xmath108 evolves in these runs ; we also plot the corresponding evolutionary track from run mt256 for comparison .",
    "unsurprisingly , we see that as we increase @xmath150 , the total amount of @xmath0 that forms in the simulations decreases . however , the reduction in @xmath108 is less than a factor of two for @xmath152 , suggesting that most of the @xmath0 that forms ( and persists ) in the simulation does so in the high density gas .    to examine how the @xmath0 in these simulations is distributed with density , we computed the mean value of @xmath58 in a set of density bins of width 0.05 dex in all three runs at time @xmath139 , and compared the values with those previously computed for run mt256 .",
    "the results are plotted in figure  [ xh2vn - mt - nth ] ; for clarity , we do not indicate the size of the standard deviations in these values , although they are comparable to those in figure  [ xh2vn - mt ] .",
    "there are two important conclusions that we can draw from this figure .",
    "first , it is clear that although the imposition of a density threshold for @xmath0 formation substantially reduces the amount of @xmath0 present in gas with @xmath153 , it does not eliminate it : some @xmath0 remains , and since it can not have formed _ in situ _ in these simulations , it must have formed in higher density gas and been transported to the low density gas by the turbulent velocity field .",
    "second , imposing a density threshold also affects the @xmath0 abundance at densities above the threshold : although the results of the various runs eventually converge at high density , there are clear differences for densities @xmath154 , rather than at @xmath155 as we might have initially expected .    in retrospect , this behaviour should perhaps have been expected . since the @xmath0 formation rate scales as the square of the number density , @xmath156 ,",
    "overdense gas makes a disproportionately large contribution to the overall @xmath0 formation rate compared to underdense gas or gas with densities near the mean value .",
    "however , previous numerical work on isothermal turbulence has shown that many of the overdense structures formed in supersonically turbulent flows are transient objects with short lifetimes ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "therefore , any @xmath0 formed within these transient overdensities will not remain at high densities for long , but will quite quickly find itself carried into much lower density surroundings .",
    "the results of runs mt256-th3e2 , mt256-th1e3 and mt256-th3e3 suggest that a large fraction of the @xmath0 in the gas is produced in this fashion .",
    "it would clearly be of great interest to determine the extent to which @xmath0 formed in transient overdensities is actually mixed into lower density material as the overdensities expand and are broken up by the flow ; i.e.  the amount of turbulent mixing of material which occurs .",
    "unfortunately , to determine this with an eulerian code such as zeus - mp , we would need to use tracer particles to follow individual fluid elements and these are not currently implemented in our version of the code .",
    "we intend to revisit this issue in future work .",
    "finally , we have investigated how sensitive our results on the density distribution of @xmath0 are to the choice of shielding approximation . in figure",
    "[ xh2vn - mt - rt ] we plot @xmath58 as a function of @xmath8 in runs mt256 and mt256-rt at time @xmath139",
    ". above @xmath157 , the results of these two runs are almost indistinguishable .",
    "since , as we have just seen , the majority of @xmath0 in these simulations forms at densities @xmath158 , this provides a simple explanation for the insensitivity of @xmath108 to our choice of shielding approximation . at lower densities ,",
    "the difference between runs mt256 and mt256-rt is greater .",
    "however , for @xmath159 , the mean value of @xmath58 derived in run mt256-rt lies within the range of values found in run mt256 , and the two runs only differ significantly at @xmath160 . in run",
    "mt256 , the @xmath0 fraction at @xmath160 very quickly falls to almost zero , as there is not enough shielding at these densities to maintain a large @xmath0 fraction . in run mt256-rt , on the other hand , shielding by the surrounding gas enables @xmath0 to survive in some regions , even at these low densities , producing the extended tail seen in the distribution .",
    "we can further characterize the @xmath0 distribution produced in our simulations by determining at which densities the bulk of the molecular gas resides .",
    "we have already seen that the highest molecular fractions are found in the densest gas , but in order to quantify how much of the total molecular mass is located at high densities , we need to characterize the density distribution of the gas . to do this ,",
    "we have computed the mass - weighted density probability function ( pdf ) for run mt512 at @xmath161 ( plotted in figure  [ den - pdf - mt ] ) .",
    "for ease of comparison with other values in the literature , we plot the pdf here as a function of @xmath162 , where @xmath12 is the mean number density of hydrogen nuclei , which in our simulations is identically equal to the initial number density of hydrogen nuclei . we also plot in figure  [ den - pdf - mt ] a log - normal function of the form @xmath163 , \\label{logn - pdf}\\ ] ] where @xmath164 and @xmath165 are the mean and dispersion of the log - normal distribution , respectively ; note that these are related by @xmath166 . to construct the log - normal distribution in figure  [ den - pdf - mt ] we have set @xmath167 , which is the mean of the actual dataset .",
    "figure  [ den - pdf - mt ] demonstrates that at densities above the mean ( @xmath168 ) , the density pdf of run mt512 is close to a log - normal in form . on the other hand , at densities below the mean ,",
    "clear deviations from a log - normal are apparent : there is a pronounced excess of power at @xmath169 , corresponding to @xmath170 , and a deficit of power at lower densities .",
    "previous investigations by @xcite and @xcite of the influence of the polytropic exponent @xmath171 on the shape of the density pdf produced by a turbulent flow suggested that a highly turbulent flow with @xmath172 should produce a power - law density pdf at densities above the mean , and that a log - normal pdf is only recovered if @xmath173 ; i.e.  if the gas is isothermal . however , this prediction is based primarily on the results from one - dimensional simulations and the predicted behaviour is not seen in the three - dimensional simulations of @xcite or @xcite .",
    "our simulations have an effective polytropic exponent @xmath174 ( see   [ gamma ] below ) , but we also see no convincing evidence for power - law behaviour at high density , suggesting that in this case the results of one - dimensional simulations are also not a good guide to the three - dimensional behaviour .    for driven _ isothermal _ turbulence , there is general agreement that the resulting density pdf should have a log - normal form @xcite . however , there is less agreement on the dispersion of this pdf . based on the results of three - dimensional turbulence simulations ,",
    "@xcite predict that the dispersion , @xmath165 , is related to the rms mach number of the flow , @xmath175 , by @xmath176 on the other hand , based on their one - dimensional simulations , @xcite predict that the relationship between @xmath165 and @xmath175 is actually @xmath177 . at @xmath178 ,",
    "the rms mach number in run mt512 is @xmath179 , and so according to the @xcite prediction , we should find that @xmath180 , and hence that @xmath181 . on the other hand",
    ", the @xcite prediction gives @xmath182 and hence @xmath183 . in figure  [ den - pdf - mt ] ,",
    "we compare these predictions with the actual density pdf in run mt512 at this time .",
    "we see that although neither prediction fits the data perfectly , the @xcite prediction comes very much closer to doing so than the @xcite prediction ; the former merely underestimates the amount of dense gas slightly , while the latter dramatically overestimates it .",
    "since @xcite simulate driven turbulence in isothermal gas without self - gravity , whereas we simulate decaying turbulence in non - isothermal gas with self - gravity , it is perhaps not surprising that we obtain a slightly different result .",
    "we have examined whether the difference that we find between the @xcite prediction and the true pdf is due to the inclusion of self - gravity in our simulations by comparing the density pdf we obtained from run mt512 at @xmath184 with that in run mt512-ng at the same time .",
    "we find no significant difference , suggesting that self - gravity has so far had little effect on the pdf .",
    "the difference may rather be due to the fact that we are examining decaying rather than driven turbulence , since the highest density portion of the pdf appears to be established at an earlier time than the one which we examine here , as can be seen from comparison of the density pdf at @xmath185 ( the long - dashed line in figure  [ den - pdf - mt ] ) with that at @xmath139 .",
    "alternatively , the difference may be due to our softer equation of state .",
    "@xcite find a slightly higher level of disagreement between the dispersions of the density pdfs in their simulations and the predictions of @xcite , using highly non - isothermal turbulent gas to model the larger - scale ism .",
    "further investigation of this point might be worthwhile . nevertheless , whatever the reason for the residual differences , it is clear that the @xcite prescription provides a good description of the density pdf of the gas , while the @xcite prescription does not .    as far as the distribution of molecular gas is concerned , the main lesson to be drawn from figure  [ den - pdf - mt ] is that only a small fraction of the gas is found at densities @xmath143 .",
    "therefore , even though this material is fully molecular , it does not represent a large fraction of the total mass of @xmath0 .",
    "instead , most of the @xmath0 is found in regions with number densities in the range @xmath186 , as can be seen more easily by examining the behaviour of the cumulative mass distribution of @xmath0 , plotted in figure  [ xh2vn - mt - times]b below .    finally , as part of our effort to understand the sensitivity of our results to our treatment of uv shielding ,",
    "we have compared the cumulative mass distribution of @xmath0 in runs mt256 and mt256-rt , performed using the local shielding approximation and the six - ray shielding approximation respectively .",
    "the results are shown in figure  [ cuml - h2-rt ] .",
    "we see that although slightly more of the total mass of @xmath0 is found at low densities in run mt256-rt than in run mt256 , the difference is small , suggesting that the results discussed above are not significantly affected by our choice of shielding approximation .",
    "so far , we have focused primarily on understanding the distribution of @xmath0 in our simulations at a single moment in time .",
    "the particular time that we have chosen , @xmath139 , corresponds to slightly less than a turbulent crossing time at our initial rms turbulent velocity , and so represents a point in time at which the turbulence in the simulations is already well - developed , but has not yet decayed to insignificance .",
    "moreover , it is also early enough that we can be reasonably confident that even in those cases where the runaway gravitational collapse of one or more dense clumps is occurring in the cloud , widespread star formation has not yet had sufficient time to occur , and therefore that our neglect of star formation and the associated feedback processes does not lead us to derive misleading results .",
    "however , the choice of this particular moment in time remains somewhat arbitrary , and it is also not immediately obvious how the @xmath0 morphology of the gas at this point in time is related to the @xmath0 morphology at earlier or later times . to investigate this ,",
    "we have therefore examined the distribution of @xmath0 in run mt512 at several different output times between @xmath187 and @xmath188 .    in figure  [ xh2vn - mt - times]a",
    ", we show how the dependence of @xmath58 on @xmath8 varies as the gas evolves . for clarity ,",
    "we have omitted any indication in this plot of the scatter around the mean values at the different output times , but in each case this is similar to the scatter already seen in figure  [ xh2vn - mt ] . at @xmath187 ,",
    "most of the gas is still atomic : the molecular fraction exceeds 50% only at densities @xmath189 , and at this point in the simulation very little gas is found at these densities .",
    "furthermore , a significant quantity of atomic hydrogen ( @xmath190 ) remains in this highly dense gas .",
    "by @xmath185 , much more @xmath0 has formed , as is evident both from figure  [ xh2vn - mt - times]a , and from our previous plot of the time evolution of @xmath108 ( figure  [ h2-mt - fid ] ) , which shows that it has increased from @xmath191 at @xmath187 to @xmath192 at @xmath185 , an increase of almost a factor of four .",
    "we see from figure  [ xh2vn - mt - times]a that gas at densities @xmath193 is now more than 50% molecular , and that gas at densities @xmath143 is almost entirely molecular . on the other hand , gas at densities",
    "@xmath194 remains almost entirely atomic . between these limits",
    ", there seems to be a simple relationship between the mean @xmath58 fraction and the density , although this relationship is not well described by a simple power - law fit . at later output times , the dependence of @xmath58 on @xmath8 remains qualitatively similar to the relationship found at @xmath185 , but the curve shifts to progressively lower densities , indicating that as @xmath195 increases , the mean @xmath58 fraction found at a given gas density also increases .",
    "we have also computed the cumulative @xmath0 mass distribution for run mt512 for the same set of output times .",
    "this is plotted in figure  [ xh2vn - mt - times]b .",
    "we see that at all of the output times that we examine , the majority of the @xmath0 is found in the density range @xmath186 . as we saw in the previous subsection , only a small fraction of the gas in our simulations",
    "has densities @xmath143 and so little of the total @xmath0 mass is located at these densities . on the other hand , while there is a significant amount of gas which has @xmath160 , the molecular fraction in this gas is small , and so its contribution to the total @xmath0 mass is also small .",
    "figure  [ xh2vn - mt - times]b suggests that lower density gas contributes a larger fraction of the total @xmath0 mass at later times , consistent with the increase in the mean molecular fraction at fixed @xmath8 noted above : gas closer to the peak of the density pdf is becoming more molecular and so is contributing a larger fraction of the mass .    finally , the fact that it takes @xmath196 before the rms density in our highest resolution runs stops increasing rapidly , as can be seen in figure  [ dens - mt ] , suggests that it takes at least this long for the turbulence to become fully developed .",
    "this implies that our results at times @xmath197 will be significantly affected by initial transients , and so may be unrepresentative of the behaviour at later times .",
    "the results presented in figure  [ xh2vn - mt - times ] certainly appear to be consistent with this conclusion , as the distribution of @xmath0 at @xmath187 is qualitatively different from the distribution at our three later output times .",
    "this suggests that were we to allow the turbulence to develop fully in our simulations before beginning to follow the @xmath0 formation , we would find somewhat different results at early times .",
    "specifically , we would expect that in this case the @xmath0 formation timescale would be even shorter than that found in the present work .",
    "however , it must be stressed that although our current set of initial conditions are rather artificial , deliberately suppressing @xmath0 formation until after large density inhomogeneities have developed is equally artificial . since",
    "our main aim in this paper is to put an upper limit on the @xmath0 formation timescale , we believe that our current procedure is justified .",
    "in order to verify that our results are not sensitive to the initial temperature of the gas in our simulations , we ran a @xmath106 simulation ( run mt256-t100 ) in which we set @xmath198 but kept all of the other input parameters the same as in run mt256 . the evolution with time of the minimum and maximum gas temperatures , @xmath199 and @xmath200 , in this run and in run mt256",
    "are plotted in figure  [ t - mt ] .",
    "we see that following a short initial period of cooling , the behaviour of the two runs is indistinguishable .",
    "we have also verified that there is no significant difference in the evolution of @xmath108 between the two runs .",
    "it is also interesting to examine how the gas temperature varies as a function of number density in these simulations . to do this",
    ", we took the output data from run mt512 , binned it by number density @xmath8 , and then computed the mean temperature and the standard deviation in the mean for each bin .",
    "the resulting values are shown in figure  [ tvn - mt ] .",
    "comparison of these results with those obtained from run ms256 in paper i demonstrates that we recover the same mean temperature in our fiducial turbulent run as in the analogous , initially static runs , at least within the range of number densities occupied by gas in the latter .",
    "this is unsurprising , as the short cooling times lead us to expect that most of the gas in both sets of simulations should be in thermal equilibrium , but it is good to verify that this is actually the case .",
    "however , the results from our turbulent runs do differ from those from the initially static runs of paper i in two important respects .",
    "the first is that gas is found at a very much wider range of densities in the turbulent runs , thanks to the strong compressions and rarefactions produced by the turbulence .",
    "the second is that at low densities ( @xmath201 ) , there is considerable scatter in the temperatures found in the gas , as can be seen from the size of the error bars in figure  [ tvn - mt ] ; this scatter is absent in the static runs .",
    "the cause of this scatter is the large number of strong shocks present in the turbulent simulations , or , more precisely , the large post - shock temperatures , which can be as large as a few thousand kelvin , as can be seen from figure  [ t - mt ] .",
    "however , since the post - shock cooling regions are generally under - resolved in our simulations , it is likely that this scatter is overstated .",
    "another thermodynamical quantity of interest is the effective polytropic index of the gas , @xmath13 , defined here as @xmath202 where @xmath203 is the gas pressure .",
    "most simulations of turbulence within molecular clouds assume an isothermal equation of state , in which case @xmath204 at all densities .",
    "however , simulations of turbulent fragmentation performed by @xcite for gas with a polytropic equation of state ( in which case @xmath205 but is independent of @xmath206 ) and by @xcite for gas with a piecewise polytropic equation of state ( @xmath207 for @xmath208 and @xmath209 for @xmath210 , with @xmath211 ) show that the outcome of the fragmentation process is dependent on the value of @xmath13 .",
    "gas with a soft equation of state ( low @xmath13 ) fragments more easily than gas with a hard equation of state ( high @xmath13 ) , producing a larger number of fragments with a smaller characteristic mass . in view of this , it is interesting to examine how @xmath13 varies with density in our simulations .    the variation in @xmath13 with @xmath8 is plotted in figure  [ gamma - mt ] for run mt512 at @xmath139 . to compute the values of @xmath13",
    "plotted here , we first computed the mean gas temperature as a function of density , as in the previous section , and also the mean molecular fraction as a function of density , as in   [ morph ] .",
    "we then used these values to compute the gas pressure as a function of density , and from this computed @xmath13 through the use of equation  [ geff ] .",
    "we see that although the gas in our simulations is not a simple polytrope , since @xmath13 varies with density , its rate of change is small for densities in the range @xmath212 , suggesting that at these densities a polytropic approximation with @xmath2 may actually be adequate for many applications .",
    "this value of @xmath13 is in reasonable agreement with the value of @xmath213 derived by @xcite for these densities from a synthesis of various observational and theoretical sources .",
    "however , it is significantly smaller than the values computed by @xcite for this range of densities .    at densities @xmath214 , we find larger values of @xmath13 , indicating a stiffening of the equation of state . however , at these densities the large scatter present in the gas temperature implies that the gas is not well described by an equation of state that is purely a function of density and so the values of @xmath13 that we have derived for this density regime are of questionable validity .",
    "we also discount the large fluctuations we see in @xmath13 at high densities ( @xmath143 ) .",
    "these are caused by small fluctuations in the mean temperature , with bin - to - bin variations of less than a degree , and our treatment of cooling at these densities is not sufficiently accurate for us to trust in the reality of these features .",
    "as previously discussed in paper i , measurements of the cosmic ray ionization rate in diffuse gas @xcite and dense gas @xcite give results that differ by an order of magnitude or more . in most of our simulations , both in paper i and here",
    ", we adopted an ionization rate @xmath215 , consistent with the value measured in dense gas .",
    "however , in order to establish the sensitivity of our results to the assumed ionization rate , we also performed one @xmath106 zone simulation with @xmath216 , a value that lies near the high end of current determinations . aside from @xmath217 , the remaining input parameters of this simulation , which we designate mt256-cr , were the same as in run mt256 , and so comparison of these two runs serves to highlight the effects of varying @xmath217 .",
    "we compare the evolution of @xmath199 and @xmath200 in runs mt256 and mt256-cr in figure  [ t - mt - cr ] .",
    "we see two main effects : both @xmath199 and @xmath200 are increased by about 1020  k at times @xmath218 , and @xmath200 ( but not @xmath199 ) is increased by a factor of a few at times @xmath219 .",
    "interestingly , there is little difference between the runs in the interval @xmath220 during which much of the @xmath0 forms .",
    "we would therefore expect to find little difference in the @xmath0 formation rates in the two simulations , and this is borne out by our results .",
    "after @xmath97 of evolution , run mt256-cr has formed only 2% more @xmath0 than run mt256 , demonstrating that the influence of variations in @xmath217 is small .",
    "as with the runs discussed in paper i , it is interesting to ask what happens as we vary some of the more important input parameters .",
    "the effects of varying the initial temperature of the gas have already been considered in the previous section ; the effects of varying the box size @xmath62 , the initial magnetic field strength @xmath221 , the initial turbulent velocity dispersion @xmath90 and the initial density @xmath64 are examined in   [ turb_box][turb_n0 ] below .      to investigate the extent to which the quantity of @xmath0 formed in our simulations and the rate at which it forms depend upon our choice of box size @xmath62 , we have performed further @xmath106 zone simulations with @xmath222 , 30 and @xmath223 , which we have designated as runs mt256-l10 , mt256-l30 and mt256-l40 respectively .",
    "the evolution of @xmath108 in these simulations is plotted in figure  [ h2-mt - box]a , along with the results from run mt256 for comparison .",
    "we see that as we decrease @xmath62 , we increase the amount of @xmath0 to form within the first 12  myr of the simulation .",
    "this is most likely due to the fact that the network of dense sheets and filaments that characterizes the density field in our turbulent runs takes less time to develop in simulations run with a smaller @xmath62 , since the turbulent crossing time of the box is directly proportional to @xmath62 .",
    "evidence for this can be seen in our plot of @xmath118 versus time in figure  [ h2-mt - box]b .    in runs mt256 , mt256-l30 and mt256-l40 the differences resulting from the change in @xmath62 are small , and",
    "have mostly vanished by @xmath224 , with the value of @xmath108 in all three runs having converged at about 0.4 .",
    "the behaviour of run mt256-l10 , on the other hand , differs markedly : @xmath108 reaches a peak value at @xmath225 of @xmath226 and then begins to decline , decreasing by approximately 20% by @xmath224 .",
    "the reason for this fall off in @xmath108 is hinted at in figure  [ h2-mt - box]b : in the @xmath227 simulation , none of the gas in the dense shocked regions undergoes gravitational collapse , and so the peak density begins to decrease as the turbulence decays .",
    "the total amount of dense gas also decreases as the turbulence decays , and so increasing amounts of @xmath0 formed in high density gas finds itself in moderate or low density regions where @xmath0 photodissociation occurs faster than @xmath0 formation .",
    "consequently , the total amount of @xmath0 present in the simulation declines . however , it should be noted that since our treatment of @xmath0 photodissociation leads us to overestimate the @xmath0 photodissociation rate , it also causes this decline to occur much faster in our simulations than would be the case in a real cloud .",
    "we ran three @xmath106 simulations in which we varied only @xmath221 in order to determine how sensitive our results are to the strength of the magnetic field . in the first of the simulations , run ht256 , we set @xmath228 and so examined purely hydrodynamical turbulence . in the second , run",
    "mt256-bx2 , we set @xmath229 , twice our standard value , while in the third , run mt256-bx10 , we set @xmath230 , ten times as large as our standard value .",
    "the mass - to - flux ratios in these three runs are @xmath231 respectively ; note that the gas in run mt256-bx10 is magnetically subcritical and so will not undergo gravitational collapse .    in figure  [ h2-mt - mag - comp ]",
    ", we show how @xmath108 evolves in these three runs and how this compares to its evolution in run mt256 .",
    "clearly , the growth of @xmath108 is more rapid in the @xmath228 run than in any of the magnetized runs .",
    "this is not unexpected : in our @xmath232 runs , the magnetic pressure of the gas helps it to resist compression by the turbulence , and so we would expect it to take longer to build up the same amount of high density structure in the @xmath232 runs as in the @xmath228 run . indeed , if we compare how the density pdfs of the four runs evolve , we find that at early times , there is significantly more dense gas in run ht256 than in any of the magnetised runs , as illustrated in figure  [ mt - mag - pdf]a , while by @xmath121 the pdfs in the four runs have almost converged , at least for densities near the peak ( figure  [ mt - mag - pdf]b ) . similarly ,",
    "if we compare the evolution of @xmath119 in the four runs ( figure  [ mt - mag - drms ] ) , we see that at @xmath197 , @xmath119 is between 50% and 100% larger in run mt256 than in any of the magnetized runs .    another interesting feature of figure  [ h2-mt - mag - comp ] is the fact that in the @xmath232 runs , the relationship between @xmath108 and @xmath221 is not what we might expect : as we increase @xmath221 , and so increase the magnetic pressure of the gas , we find that @xmath108 also increases .",
    "this behaviour is due to an effect previously noted by @xcite in their simulations of isothermal mhd turbulence .",
    "they note that as the strength of the magnetic field increases , the density enhancements found in their simulations become greater .",
    "they attribute this to the fact that when the magnetic field is strong , it remains highly ordered , causing the magnetic pressure to remain highly anisotropic .",
    "gas can therefore flow along the field lines , forming dense shocked layers that are oriented perpendicularly to the mean field .",
    "on the other hand , when the field is weak it is easily tangled by the turbulent velocity field , and so the magnetic pressure becomes far more isotropic , making it harder to form highly dense regions .",
    "figures  [ mt - mag - pdf ] and [ mt - mag - drms ] , which show that more dense gas is present at early times in runs mt256-bx2 and mt256-bx10 than in run mt256 , suggest that a similar effect is at work in our simulations",
    ". further confirmation of this comes from an examination of the magnetic energy associated with the x , y and z components of the magnetic field in runs mt256 and mt256-bx10 , as plotted in figure  [ mt - mag - en ] . in run",
    "mt256-bx10 , the magnetic energy associated with the z - component of the field remains orders of magnitude larger than the energy associated with either the x or y - components throughout the simulation , demonstrating that the field remains highly anisotropic . in run mt256 , on the other hand , the difference between the three components is much smaller , indicating that the magnetic field is far more isotropic .",
    "finally , the significant @xmath0 formation that occurs in magnetically subcritical run mt256-bx10 , which is not gravitationally unstable , is further confirmation that gravitational instability does not cause the rapid @xmath0 formation seen in our simulations , and that turbulent compressions dominate even in strongly magnetized gas .      to examine the extent to which our results depend upon the strength of the turbulence , as quantified by the initial rms velocity , @xmath90 , we have run several simulations with differing values of @xmath90 . in figure  [ h2-mt - vdisp - comp ] , we show how @xmath108 evolves in runs mt256-v1 , mt256-v2.5 and mt256-v5 , which have @xmath233 , 2.5 and @xmath234 respectively .",
    "we see that as we decrease the strength of the turbulence , we increase the @xmath0 formation timescale , with the time taken to reach @xmath235 approximately doubling from @xmath121 to @xmath122 as we decrease @xmath90 from @xmath236 to @xmath237 .",
    "however , the impact of varying @xmath90 on the _ amount _ of @xmath0 to form during the simulation is surprisingly small : runs mt256 , mt256-v5 and mt256-v2.5 have all formed roughly the same amount of @xmath0 by the time the simulations end , and only in run mt256-v1 is the final value of @xmath108 significantly smaller .",
    "the reason we find faster @xmath0 formation in runs with a larger @xmath90 becomes clear if we examine how the rms density of the gas varies in these runs . in figure  [ drms - vrms ] , we plot the time evolution of @xmath119 in all four runs . we see that as we increase @xmath90 , we find a faster increase in @xmath119 at early times .",
    "this behaviour is easily understood on the basis of a simple timescale argument : runs with a larger @xmath90 have a shorter turbulent crossing time , @xmath238 , and so in these runs less time is required to produce the highly overdense regions where most of the @xmath0 forms . at @xmath239 in run mt256 and at @xmath240 in runs mt256-v5 and mt256-v2.5 , we see a sudden increase in @xmath119 , consistent with the onset of runaway gravitational collapse at one or more locations in the simulation volume , but prior to this the evolution of the rms density in these runs is dominated by turbulence . since the turbulent compressions produce a very similar rms density in all three cases , it is not surprising that we also find similar values for @xmath108 .",
    "note also that the spread in @xmath0 formation timescales seen in figure  [ h2-mt - vdisp - comp ] is comparable to the spread in rms density growth rates in figure  [ drms - vrms ] , and that the values of @xmath108 in the three runs converge later than the values of @xmath119 because @xmath0 formation is not instantaneous , causing the growth in @xmath108 to lag behind the growth in @xmath119 .",
    "finally , although run mt256-v1 appears , on the basis of figure  [ h2-mt - vdisp - comp ] , to behave differently from the other runs , figure  [ drms - vrms ] suggests that this is not actually the case : it is simply taking significantly longer to produce large overdensities and the associated high @xmath0 fractions in this run , which is to be expected given the smaller @xmath89 and hence greater turbulent crossing time .      in figure  [ h2-mt - n0 ] , we show how the evolution with time of @xmath108 changes as we reduce the initial density of the gas in our simulations . plotted in the figure",
    "are results from two runs performed using the local shielding approximation , mt256-n10 and mt256-n30 , which had initial densities of @xmath241 and @xmath242 respectively , and one run performed using the six - ray shielding approximation , mt256-rt - n10 , which had an initial density @xmath243 . to ensure that the mass - to - flux ratio @xmath244 remained approximately the same in these runs as in our runs with @xmath12 , we reduced @xmath221 to @xmath245 in run mt256-n30 and to @xmath246 in runs mt256-n10 and mt256-rt - n10 .",
    "all of the other input parameters had the same values as in run mt256 .",
    "it is clear from figure  [ h2-mt - n0 ] that reducing @xmath64 has a dramatic effect on the amount of @xmath0 that forms in the simulations , particularly in the runs using the local shielding approximation .",
    "the decrease in @xmath64 by about a factor of three between runs mt256 and mt256-n30 causes a roughly proportionate decrease in @xmath108 at late times .",
    "similarly , the reduction in @xmath64 by an order of magnitude between runs mt256-rt and mt256-rt - n10 leads to an order of magnitude decrease in @xmath108 .",
    "the difference between runs mt256 and mt256-n10 is even more striking , with an order of magnitude decrease in @xmath64 leading in this case to a reduction in @xmath108 by more than a factor of 40 .",
    "the reason for this sensitivity is clear if we look at how the density distribution varies as we vary @xmath64 . in figure  [ pdf - mt - n0 ]",
    ", we plot the mass - weighted density pdf for the suite of runs at different densities at @xmath139 . in each case , @xmath247 , where the mean density @xmath64 is of course different in each run . as we decrease @xmath64 , the peak of the pdf moves closer to the mean and the amount of overdense gas decreases .",
    "since the mean density has also decreased , the net effect is a sharp drop in the amount of high density gas : in run mt256 , at this output time , approximately 22% of the total gas mass is in regions with @xmath193 , while in runs mt256-n30 and mt256-n10 , this figure decreases to 2% and 0.05% , respectively .",
    "the density pdfs in the six - ray runs strongly resemble those in the local approximation runs with the same initial density , and so a similar effect occurs in this case .",
    "since we already know that most of the @xmath0 that forms in our simulations does so in dense gas , it is not surprising that substantially reducing the amount of dense gas available has a dramatic effect on @xmath108 .",
    "it is clear from a comparison of runs mt256-n10 and mt256-rt - n10 in figure  [ h2-mt - n0 ] , however , that the magnitude of this effect does depend on our choice of self - shielding approximation : we see a significantly greater reduction when using the local shielding approximation than when using the six - ray approximation",
    ". this is unsurprising given our previous discussion of the dependence of @xmath58 on @xmath8 in our turbulent models ( see   [ xh2n ] ) .",
    "we have already seen that far more @xmath0 survives at low densities when we use the six - ray approximation .",
    "this low density @xmath0 represents only a small fraction of the total molecular mass present in our @xmath12 simulations , but is far more significant in simulations with a lower value of @xmath64 .",
    "nevertheless , even in the six - ray run there is a large reduction in @xmath108 when @xmath64 is reduced , and so although the quantitative details of the relationship between @xmath64 and @xmath108 depend on the treatment of self - shielding , the basic qualitative result does not : conversion of @xmath25 to @xmath0 is strongly suppressed at @xmath248 .",
    "the simulations presented in this paper demonstrate that the timescale for @xmath0 formation in turbulent gas is much shorter than the corresponding timescale in quiescent gas .",
    "for gas with a mean number density @xmath12 , and with a magnetic field strength and rms turbulent velocity consistent with observations , we find that @xmath249 of the initial atomic hydrogen can be converted to @xmath0 on a timescale of 1@xmath97 . moreover , since these results are derived from simulations that use a local approximation to treat @xmath0 shielding , they represent a _ lower limit _ on the amount of @xmath0 formed .",
    "( comparison between a run using a a six - ray shielding approximation and one with @xmath0 photodissociation entirely absent suggests that this lower limit must lie within about 30% of the true value ) .",
    "the @xmath0 formation timescale that we obtain is consistent with that required by models in which molecular clouds have short lifetimes , of the order of a turbulent crossing time ( see e.g.  @xcite , @xcite ) , and so criticism of these models on the grounds that they do not provide enough time to form the large quantities of @xmath0 required is shown to be groundless .    by comparing the rate of @xmath0 formation in simulations",
    "performed both with and without self - gravity , we have shown that the rapid growth of @xmath0 is due to the large density enhancements created by the turbulent compressions .",
    "self - gravity becomes important only at later times , as part of the gas goes into runaway gravitational collapse .",
    "we therefore predict that @xmath0 should form rapidly in any dense turbulent atomic cloud , regardless of whether or not the cloud is gravitationally bound and regardless of whether it is magnetic subcritical or supercritical .",
    "our finding that @xmath0 forms quickly in a supersonically turbulent flow is consistent with the previous work of @xcite , who find a similar effect in simulations of high - speed decaying turbulence in @xmath124 gas .",
    "we have investigated the distribution of the @xmath0 formed in our simulations , and have shown that most is located at densities between 1 and 100 times our mean number density @xmath12 .",
    "gas denser than @xmath250 is fully molecular , but contributes little to the total @xmath0 mass as only a small fraction of the gas is found at these densities . on the other hand , gas that is less dense than @xmath251 contributes little because it is still primarily atomic .",
    "a surprising result of our simulations is that in low density regions ( @xmath252 ) , there is more @xmath0 than we would expect if the gas were in photodissociation equilibrium .",
    "we have shown that this is explained by the fact that a large fraction of the @xmath0 found at low densities actually formed at high densities , in gas with @xmath158 , and that it has subsequently been transported to low densities by the action of the turbulence .",
    "this is consistent with previous findings that a large proportion of the dense structures produced in a supersonically turbulent flow are transient objects which are not gravitationally bound @xcite .",
    "our results show that these transient density enhancements have a profound impact on the @xmath0 chemistry of the low density gas .",
    "previous work by @xcite , using a highly simplified dynamical model , suggests that such transient density enhancements will also have a large impact on the chemistry of many other tracer species , such as cs .",
    "we might also speculate that strong , transient density enhancements associated with turbulence in the diffuse ism are the cause of the puzzling small area molecular structures discovered by @xcite .    to fully characterize the impact of the turbulence on the chemistry of the gas , it is important to determine the amount of mixing which occurs @xcite .",
    "our current simulations have not allowed us to do this , since they are strictly eulerian in nature , but we plan to address this point in future work .",
    "we have also examined the sensitivity of our results to the choice of several of our main input parameters : the initial temperature of the gas , @xmath253 , the box size @xmath62 , the initial magnetic field strength @xmath221 , the initial turbulent velocity dispersion @xmath90 , and the initial density @xmath64 .",
    "we find very little sensitivity to the initial gas temperature .",
    "the gas in our simulations cools rapidly and reaches thermal equilibrium within only @xmath254 and at later times displays no memory of its initial temperature .",
    "indeed , if we look solely at the mean gas temperature at times @xmath255 , then we find that it behaves rather like a polytrope , with @xmath256 and @xmath2 .",
    "however , at low gas densities , the scatter of the actual gas temperature around this mean value is considerable , and the polytropic approximation does not capture the full range of behaviour of the gas .    simulations performed with different values for the box size @xmath62 do show some differences in behaviour , with @xmath0 forming faster when @xmath62 is small .",
    "this appears to be due to the fact that altering @xmath62 alters the turbulent crossing time , which in turn alters the time required for large density enhancements to build up within the box . nevertheless , in every case our main result ",
    "that @xmath0 forms rapidly , on a timescale of a few megayears  remains the same .",
    "varying the strength of the initial magnetic field also leads to some differences in behaviour , although again in every case we find the same basic result .",
    "@xmath0 forms more rapidly and in greater quantities when @xmath257 than when @xmath258 , apparently because large overdensities develop faster in the former case than in the latter .",
    "surprisingly , @xmath0 also forms more rapidly when the magnetic field is strong and the gas is subcritical than when it is weak ( but still dynamically significant ) and the gas is supercritical .",
    "this appears to be due to the fact that when the field is strong , it remains highly ordered , causing gas to flow preferentially along the field lines and leading to the formation of dense shocked layers that are oriented perpendicularly to the mean field .",
    "an effect of this kind was previously noted by @xcite in their simulations of isothermal mhd turbulence .",
    "decreasing the strength of the turbulence by decreasing @xmath90 lengthens the @xmath0 formation timescale , as it again takes longer to build up the same amount of dense structure .",
    "however , @xmath0 formation remains rapid compared to quiescent models ( cf .",
    "paper i ) and mass - weighted mean molecular fractions of @xmath249 can be produced in less than @xmath259 as long as @xmath260 .",
    "since observations of molecular clouds on scales @xmath92 find one - dimension velocity dispersions of @xmath261@xmath94 @xcite , corresponding to values of @xmath95@xmath262 , this implies that @xmath0 formation will be rapid in real clouds .",
    "the input parameter to which our results are most sensitive is the initial number density @xmath64 . decreasing @xmath64 substantially decreases the amount of dense gas produced in the simulations , which has the effect of dramatically reducing the production of @xmath0 .",
    "based purely on our results , we would expect significant @xmath0 formation to occur only in clouds with mean densities greater than @xmath263 , although we caution that this is no better than an order of magnitude estimate at this point .    in summary , we suggest that the key to understanding the formation of molecular clouds is understanding the process ( or processes ) that produce large , dense clouds of turbulent _ atomic _ gas , since our results demonstrate that such clouds will very quickly become molecular . our results also show that the many transient overdense regions that are created by the turbulence play a central role in bringing about this rapid rate of @xmath0 formation .",

    "<S> the characteristic lifetimes of molecular clouds remain uncertain and subject to debate , with arguments having recently been advanced in support of short - lived clouds , with lifetimes of only a few myr , and in support of much longer - lived clouds , with lifetimes of 10  myr or more . </S>",
    "<S> one argument that has been advanced in favour of long cloud lifetimes is the apparent difficulty involved in converting sufficient atomic hydrogen to molecular hydrogen within the short timescale required by the rapid cloud formation scenario . </S>",
    "<S> however , previous estimates of the time required for this conversion to occur have not taken into account the effects of the supersonic turbulence which is inferred to be present in the atomic gas .    in this paper , we present results from a large set of numerical simulations that demonstrate that @xmath0 formation occurs rapidly in turbulent gas . starting with purely atomic hydrogen , large quantities of molecular hydrogen </S>",
    "<S> can be produced on timescales of 12  myr , given turbulent velocity dispersions and magnetic field strengths consistent with observations . moreover , as our simulations underestimate the effectiveness of h@xmath1 self - shielding and dust absorption , we can be confident that the molecular fractions that we compute are strong lower limits on the true values . </S>",
    "<S> the formation of large quantities of molecular gas on the timescale required by rapid cloud formation models therefore appears to be entirely plausible .    </S>",
    "<S> we also investigate the density and temperature distributions of gas in our model clouds . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the density probability distribution function is approximately log - normal , with a dispersion that agrees well with the prediction of padoan , nordlund & jones  ( 1997 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the temperature distribution is similar to that of a polytrope , with an effective polytropic index @xmath2 , although at low gas densities , the scatter of the actual gas temperature around this mean value is considerable , and the polytropic approximation does not capture the full range of behaviour of the gas . </S>"
