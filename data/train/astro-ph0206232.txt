    "analytic calculations @xcite and numerical simulations @xcite suggest that protoplanets in a protoplanetary disk migrate rapidly into the star they orbit ",
    "so rapidly that it is a wonder any planets survive at all .",
    "small protoplanets torque the disk at lindblad and corotation resonances , and the resulting back - torque can propel a planet into the star in a matter of @xmath3 years @xcite .",
    "@xcite has dubbed this conundrum the shiva problem , after the hindu god of destruction .",
    "large protoplanets may open a gap in the disk via their resonant torques , and so become locked to the disk s viscous spreading , a process which may dump the most of the disk and planet onto the star within @xmath4 years or less , depending on the disk viscosity .",
    "figure  [ fig : ahistogram ] shows the distribution of the orbital periods of the innermost doppler planet candidates , summarizing data from @xcite .",
    "these candidate planets all orbit stars with masses in the range 0.71.4 @xmath5 .",
    "figure  [ fig : ahistogram ] suggests that whatever mechanism halted the migration of these planets operates best at an orbital period of @xmath6  days and ceases to operate at shorter periods . of the 20 planets with periods less than 20 days , 8 have periods in the range 34 days .",
    "no planet has a period less than 2.98 days .",
    "this trend appears to be real and not an artifact of observational selection ; the primary precise - doppler surveys are complete for jupiter mass planets out to a period of @xmath7 years @xcite .",
    "occasionally the interactions among two planets and a star can leave a planet trapped by stellar tides into a circular orbit at @xmath8 au @xcite .",
    "sometimes an accreting planet may overflow its roch lobe , losing mass to the star , and this process may halt the planet s migration @xcite .",
    "but these phenomena appear to be rare .",
    "scenarios in which planets migrate by interacting with a disk of planetesimals without gas @xcite provide a disk truncation radius where planets may gather : the radius where planetesimals become hot enough to sublimate .",
    "the problem with gas - less migration schemes is that substantially changing the orbit of a jupiter - mass planet requires roughly a jupiter mass of planetesimals .",
    "in contrast , optically - thick disks with more than a jupiter mass of gas appear to be ubiquitous around young stars . @xcite",
    "have suggested that planet migration ends where the gaseous protoplanetary disk meets the stellar magnetosphere .",
    "we suggest an alternative explanation for the pile - up of planets near the 3-day period : a gas disk truncated at a temperature of 1500  k by the onset of magneto - rotational instability ( mri ; chandrasekhar 1961 ; balbus & hawley 1991 ) .",
    "a planet with orbital period @xmath9 and semimajor axis @xmath10 interacts with a disk at lindblad resonance sites , located where the natural epicycle period of the gas in the disk ( roughly the keplerian orbital period ) is @xmath11 .",
    "the most distant lindblad resonances from the planet are the @xmath12 and @xmath13 , located at roughly @xmath14 and @xmath15 respectively .",
    "the planet torques the disk at these resonances , and the back - torque from the inner lindblad resonances tends to add angular momentum to the planet s orbit , while the back - torque from the outer lindblad resonances tends to remove angular momentum to the planet s orbit @xcite .",
    "however , over a wide range of disk pressure and density gradients , the torques from the outer lindblad resonances dominate the torques from the inner lindblad resonances , causing the planet to spiral into the star @xcite .",
    "consider a planet contained in a protoplanetary disk with an inner truncation radius of @xmath0 , corresponding to an orbital period of @xmath16 .",
    "when the planet migrates inward to where it has an orbital period @xmath17 ( @xmath18 ) , it may begin to migrate inwards faster than normal because its interior lindblad resonance sites lie in the evacuated regions , so the outward torques from these resonances disappear .",
    "when the planet reaches an orbital period of @xmath19 ( @xmath20 ) , and all of the planet s inner and outer lindblad resonances are contained in a central evacuated region , the disk - planet interaction may stall , ending the planet s migration @xcite . a planet with a gap",
    "is not immune ; it must also stop migrating at a period of @xmath19 , where it can no longer dynamically communicate with enough mass in disk material to substantially affect its orbit .",
    "we propose that protoplanetary disks are evacuated interior to radius @xmath0 because of the powerful magneto - rotational instability which afflicts conducting keplerian disks .",
    "protoplanetary disks may suddenly become conducting where they reach a temperature of 1500k and potassium ionizes @xcite and dust sublimates , removing recomination sites @xcite .",
    "numerical simulations of saturated mri show that it can provide a disk @xmath21 viscosity @xcite in the range of @xmath22 to @xmath23 @xcite depending on the assumed resistivity .",
    "exterior to @xmath0 , the mri may be damped completely @xcite .    in a steady state disk , the accretion rate @xmath24 is uniform and continuity dictates that @xmath25 constant , where @xmath26 is the radial coordinate , @xmath27 is the surface density , and @xmath28 is the radial drift velocity . in a viscous accretion disk , @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the viscosity .",
    "so roughly speaking , @xmath31 , or using the @xmath21 prescription for disk viscosity , @xmath32 .",
    "magnetorotational instability can plausibly cause the effective @xmath21 to climb by a factor of 101000 interior to @xmath0 , which translates into a comparable drop in surface density .",
    "when planets reach @xmath20 in the centers of disks evacuated by mri - driven accretion , their migration will slow by this factor of 101000 .",
    "the high viscosity in this zone also acts to inhibit gap formation and close up existing gaps around massive planets .    in radiative - transfer models of protoplanetary disks ,",
    "a surface layer of small grains intercepts the starlight first and rations it to the disk midplane @xcite .",
    "these small grains have hotter equilibrium temperatures than a blackbody at a given distance from the star , so they sublimate farther from the star than larger grains .",
    "we can find @xmath0 by iteratively solving the radiative equilibrium equation for the temperature of the small grains as a function of distance from the star @xcite .",
    "we performed such a computation assuming @xmath33 m grains  bodies whose emissive and absorptive efficiencies stay constant at wavelengths shorter than 0.1  @xmath34 m , but decline as @xmath35 at longer wavelengths .",
    "we find that the grains reach 1500  k at @xmath36 au ( @xmath37 days ) for a solar type star , or @xmath38 au ( @xmath39 days ) for star with solar luminosity and mass , but effective temperature of @xmath40  k , a common model for a t tauri star .",
    "planet migration in a disk with such an inner truncation radius would halt at @xmath41  2.4  days ; near the observed pile - up of precise - doppler planets .",
    "the luminosity of a solar - mass star varies over roughly a factor of @xmath42 during the time from 1 million to 10 million years after its birth @xcite , so the value of @xmath16 relevant to halting the migration of a given planet could conceivably range over a factor of @xmath43 due to this effect .",
    "for comparison , if we assume a 1 jupiter mass planet has a radius of 2.3 jupiter radii at an age of 1 million years @xcite , we calculate that the orbital period where it overflows its roche radius is @xmath44  days .",
    "the likely hosts of protoplanetary disks are t tauri stars ( @xmath45 ) and herbig ae / be stars ( @xmath46 28@xmath47 ) .",
    "near - infrared photometry of herbig ae / be stars reveals a curious pattern ; many of these stars have two - humped infrared excesses  broad emission peaks in the mid- or far - infrared , and then second emission peaks near @xmath48 m @xcite . a model in which accretion luminosity powers the near - ir hump requires optically - thick gas interior to the dust - sublimation point , a feature not corroborated by the observed seds @xcite or measurements of optical veiling @xcite .",
    "the near - ir humps appear to represent the thermal emission peak of a population of dust at a temperature of 1500 k @xcite .",
    "the prominence of these near - ir humps may indicate the importance of @xmath0 in the structure of herbig ae disks .",
    "further evidence for the structural importance of @xmath0 comes from long - baseline optical interferometry .",
    "@xcite resolved 11 herbig ae stars at baselines of 21 and 38 m with the iota interferometer in the near - infrared .",
    "the visibilities of the 11 resolved targets and their near - ir excesses were well modeled by dusty rings with inner radii of 0.35 au , possibly corresponding to @xmath0 .",
    "measurements of the near - ir sizes of the central regions of other young stars , including some t tauri stars , with the palomar testbed interferometer @xcite and using a single keck telescope with an aperture mask @xcite support this association ; the observed near - ir sizes show a trend of increasing with the luminosity of the young star , which is consistent with the increase of @xmath0 with luminosity ( j. monnier & r. millan gabet , in preparation ) .",
    "@xcite and @xcite have interpreted the photometric and interferometric observations of herbig ae / be stars as signs that protoplanetary disks may have tall , passively - heated inner walls ; hot dust on the wall provides the @xmath48 m emission peak . this inner wall could conceivably represent the zone where the opacity and the surface density suddenly drop in our model .",
    "further high - resolution interferometric studies of herbig ae / be and t tauri disks should help clarify how disk structure affects planet migration .",
    "@xcite review a theory of the interiors of protoplanetary disks which centers on the interaction between the stellar magnetic field and the inner edge of the conducting gas disk . in this `` x - wind '' theory ,",
    "the disk is replaced by magnetic accretion columns and a bipolar wind interior to the radius @xmath49 .",
    "earlier explanations of halting planet migration @xcite have pointed to @xmath49 as the critical radius rather than @xmath0 .    directly measuring @xmath49",
    "is difficult .",
    "however , in equilibrium , the stellar rotation period matches the keplerian period at @xmath49 , so measuring the stellar rotation rate and assuming that t tauri stars are rotationally locked to their disks may provide an estimate of @xmath49 .",
    "however , the process of breaking the stellar rotation is probably slow @xcite , and the rotation periods of t tauri stars range from 0.5 to @xmath50 days @xcite .",
    "consequently , it is hard to associate the 3-day period of the closest - in extrasolar planets with a special stellar rotation rate , or with @xmath49 .    in the x - wind model of chondrule formation ,",
    "a geometrically - thin , optically - thick disk of planetesimals interior to @xmath49 suffers mutual collisions and heating from magnetic flares @xcite .",
    "material from these planetesimals become proto - chondrules . in our picture ,",
    "type i migration helps deliver planetesimals to the magnetically - active zone .",
    "we imagine a ring of planetesimals collecting near @xmath51 . objects smaller than a few km may migrate in further than @xmath51 via plasma drag @xcite .",
    "we briefly considered the following alternative mechanism for halting planet migration . continuing the calculations of @xcite",
    "shows that with only a slight positive temperature gradient ( @xmath52 , i.e. the disk temperature increases with radius faster than roughly @xmath53 ) , the torque on the planet from disk tides can reverse .",
    "such a positive temperature gradient could conceivably occur where the disk regains sight of the star beyond the shadow of the disk s tall inner wall .",
    "however , the models of @xcite suggest that the positive temperature gradient in this region is largely confined to the surface layer of the disk , which does not have enough surface density itself to affect planet migration .",
    "we have painted a picture of the central regions of protoplanetary disks in which a low - surface - density , rapidly accreting central region catches inwardly - migrating planets like flypaper . a good way to test our conjecture that disk temperature",
    " not the stellar magnetic field",
    " determines the orbital radii of the innermost surviving planets is to extend the sample of planet search target stars to include a wider range of stellar masses .",
    "for example , we predict that planets around early a main sequence stars will collect at a radius much farther from the star ( @xmath54 au ) than planets around solar type stars .",
    "the high rotation rates of main sequence a stars betray that magnetic disk truncation can not rescue planets migrating into these stars until they reach near 0.03 au .",
    "doppler planet search techniques may not work for a stars because of their rotationally - broadened spectral lines .",
    "however , astrometric searches , transit searches , and direct - imaging searches for extrasolar planets are not so limited .",
    "this work was performed in part under contract with the jet propulsion laboratory ( jpl ) through the michelson fellowship program funded by nasa as an element of the planet finder program .",
