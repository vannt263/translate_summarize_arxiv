    "in last three years the observation of a narrow baryon state named @xmath4 predicted by diakonov , petrov and polyakov@xcite has been reported by a large number of experiments in the @xmath5 or @xmath6 decay channels .",
    "several experiments , mostly at high energies , did not confirm the existence of @xmath4 .",
    "the present situation and complete list of references to positive and null results can be found in the reviews@xcite .",
    "here we present a new study of the reaction @xmath7 ,  @xmath8 , @xmath9 , with two independent samples of @xmath2 used@xcite .",
    "a detailed description of svd-2 detector and its trigger system can be found elsewhere@xcite .",
    "the components of the detector used in current analyses are : the high - precision microstrip vertex detector with active(si ) and passive(c , pb ) nuclear targets ; large aperture magnetic spectrometer ; multicell threshold cherenkov counter . for the analyses we use data obtained in the 70 gev proton beam of ihep accelerator at intensity @xmath10 protons / cycle .",
    "the total statistics of @xmath11 inelastic events was collected .",
    "the sensivity of this experiment for inelastic @xmath12-interactions taking in account the triggering efficiency was @xmath13 .",
    "svd-2 has performed the searches of @xmath4-baryon in two independent samples of the data selected by the @xmath2 decay point .    in the first one @xmath2 decayed within the vertex detector",
    "were used . the first step in",
    "the analysis was to find out events with a well defined secondary vertex at the distance of 0 to 35 mm by the beam direction from the beginning of the active target ( corresponding to the sensitive area of the vertex detector ) .",
    "tracks from secondary vertex were explored to the magnetic spectrometer and their momenta were reconstructed .",
    "the @xmath6 invariant mass spectrum ( fig.[fig1 ] ) shows a clear peak at the @xmath14 with the significance of about 6.2@xmath15 ( 205 signal over 1050 background events ) . to estimate the natural width of the observed peak additional quality cuts",
    "were used : 1 ) the distance of the closest approach between @xmath16 tracks @xmath17 3 standard deviations and 2 ) the number of hits on the track in the magnetic spectrometer @xmath18 12 ( of 18 present ) . taking into account the experimental resolution of the svd-2 detector ( calculated using well - known resonances ) it was estimated that intrinsic width of the @xmath19-resonance is @xmath20 at 95% c.l .    for analysis",
    "ii , the `` distant '' @xmath2 ( decay region is @xmath21 , outside the vertex detector ) were used .",
    "@xmath2-mesons were identified by their charged decay mode @xmath22 . to eliminate contamination from @xmath23",
    "decays , candidates with ( @xmath24 ) mass hypothesis giving less than @xmath25 were rejected .",
    "about @xmath26 @xmath2-mesons from the mass window @xmath27 were found in the selected events .",
    "proton candidates were selected as positively charged tracks with a number of spectrometer hits more than 12 with a momentum @xmath28 .",
    "pions of such energies should leave a hit in the cherenkov counter , therefore absence of hits in tcc was also required .",
    "effective mass of the @xmath29 system is plotted in fig.[fig2 ] .",
    "an enhancement is seen at the mass @xmath30 with a @xmath31 with statistical significance of 5.6@xmath15 .",
    "it was verified that observed @xmath6-resonance can not be a reflection from other ( for example @xmath32 ) resonances . the mechanism for producing spurious peak around @xmath33 involving @xmath2 and @xmath23 decays overlap",
    "was also checked .",
    "the events were scanned using svd-2 event display and no `` ghost '' tracks were found .",
    "it is impossible to determine the strangeness of this state in such inclusive reaction , however we did not observe any narrow structure in @xmath34 invariant mass spectrum in @xmath35 mass area ( fig.[fig4]a ) . when applying a different cut on @xmath23 momentum , @xmath36 , we observe a structure near @xmath37 ( fig.[fig4]b ) .",
    "this peak may correspond to the @xmath38 , marked as one - star resonance in the pdg review@xcite .",
    "our search for @xmath4-particle is an inclusive experiment with a significant background contribution .",
    "we have made an attempt to apply a subtraction method to investigate @xmath39 creation region in terms of @xmath40 .",
    "an effective mass distribution in a peak region was fitted with a sum of background ( b ) and gaussian functions .",
    "background was taken as a product of a threshold function and a second degree polinomial , .",
    "all the fit parameters were given reasonable seeds but no boundaries , to prove a fit stability .",
    "we have chosen a peak region as a gaussian mean @xmath41 2 gaussian @xmath15 .",
    "a number of effective background events under the peak , @xmath42 , was evaluated by integrating background function over the peak region .",
    "@xmath40 distributions were plotted separately for a peak and an out - of - peak regions(``wings '' ) ; the latter ranged from the threshold to the 1.7 gev with a peak region cut out , and a result was scaled to a @xmath42 .",
    "assuming that the background characteristics are uniform , we subtract `` wings '' distribution from the peak one .",
    "choosing more narrow `` wings '' does not change the general shape of distribution ( a rise at @xmath43 ) but shows larger fluctuations .",
    "these operations were performed over the data from both analyses .",
    "acceptance corrections were taken from the simulations and were specific for each type of analysis .",
    "the results are shown at figs.[fig3 ] and [ fig4 ] .",
    "we plot also normalized curves of the predictions made in a baranov regge - based model@xcite . in this model ,",
    "overall distribution comes from the sum of quark fragmentation(bell - shaped at @xmath43 ) and diquark one(seagull - shaped ) , taken with somewhat arbitrary weights . in @xcite the weights are taken as 1:10 , as coming from the analysis of non - exotic baryons creation .",
    "our data may indicate some favoring to the quark fragmentation part of the model .",
    "note that the analysis ii has a specific narrow acceptance in x due to the proton momentum restrictions .",
    "we `` projected '' the @xmath40-result of analysis i to a second one to check the consistence of our observations .",
    "for that , the _ inverse _ acceptance correction for analysis ii was applied to the result of analysis i. we found a plausible agreement of the distribution shapes ( fig.[fig6 ] ) and some difference in a total number of events .",
    "the latter makes a contribution to the cross section error calculations .    as positive as negative results on the theta particle search are very often presented as the ratio of theta to @xmath44 cross sections . in our case , we estimate it as 0.04 .",
    "however we should note that these two particles may have quite different creation mechanisms .",
    "for example , extracting @xmath40 for @xmath44 the same way as described above resulted in much more forward - oriented distribution ( not shown here ) , than for theta particle .",
    "it weakens the reasons of making this comparison .",
    "one may suppose that a best way to present such a ratio would be to accompany it with corresponding acceptances .",
    "the re - evaluation of the theta creation cross section gives @xmath45 @xmath46 for @xmath47 .",
    "it differs significantly from our previous estimates@xcite .",
    "the main reason is an unusual form of @xmath40 distribution , assumed flat in our first publications .",
    "taking into account our situation of using inclusive data , and undiscovered yet mechanism of theta particle creation ( that means difficulties in acceptance evaluation ) , we believe that the cross section value is subject to future investigations .    in conclusion , svd-2 observes in two independent samples a signal in @xmath48 mass distribution with @xmath49,@xmath50 , significance of @xmath51 , @xmath45 @xmath46 for @xmath47 .",
    "@xmath40 peaks at zero with , that agrees qualitatively to a regge - based model suggested by baranov@xcite . while in agreement with evidences of @xmath4 observation , there is no direct contradiction to null results in hadron - hadron fixed target collisions , mainly due to different acceptances at @xmath52 .",
    "we thank ichep06 organizing committee for creating an excellent scientific atmosphere during the conference . s.p.baranov",
    "kindly supplied us with the data used in his work@xcite , the discussions with him were also very useful ."
