    "observations of quasi - periodic oscillations ( qpos ) following giant flares in soft gamma - ray repeaters @xcite suggest a close coupling between the seismic motion of the crust after a major quake and the modes of oscillations in a magnetar . the analysis of x - ray data in sgr 1900 + 14 @xcite and sgr 1806 - 20 @xcite has unveiled a number of periodicities , with frequencies that agree reasonably well with the expected torsional ( or toroidal shear ) oscillation modes of the neutron star ( ns ) crust : see e.g.  @xcite for a review , and @xcite for recent progress in explaining apparent discrepancies between theoretical models and observations .",
    "these observations are very exciting because they allow us , for the very first time , to test ns oscillation models .",
    "the foundations of crustal torsional oscillation theory in general relativity ( gr ) were laid in a classic paper by schumaker and thorne @xcite .",
    "recent work motivated by qpo observations explored how torsional oscillation frequencies are affected by various physical effects , including crustal elasticity @xcite , magnetic fields @xcite , superfluidity @xcite , the nuclear symmetry energy @xcite and electron screening @xcite .",
    "the main motivation of this paper is to answer the following question : could torsional oscillation frequencies carry observable imprints of strong - field dynamics , and possibly hint at dynamics beyond gr ? vice versa , can we ignore effects due to hypothetical strong - field modifications of gr when we explore the dependence of torsional oscillation frequencies on the various physical mechanisms listed above ?",
    "we address these questions within the simplest class of modifications of gr , namely scalar - tensor theory .",
    "damour and esposito - farse @xcite showed that a wide class of scalar - tensor theories can pass solar system tests and exhibit nonperturbative strong - field deviations away from gr ( `` spontaneous scalarization '' ) that can potentially be measured by observations of the bulk properties of nss , and of binary systems containing nss .",
    "the magnitude of these deviations is very sensitive to the value of a certain theory parameter @xmath0 , defined in eq .",

    "static nss in theories with spontaneous scalarization were first studied in @xcite .",
    "their stability was investigated using catastrophe theory by harada @xcite .",
    "the formation of scalarized nss in gravitational collapse was studied in @xcite , and a possible mechanism to `` seed '' macroscopic scalar fields from quantum vacuum instabilities was recently suggested @xcite .",
    "slowly rotating nss were studied at first @xcite and second @xcite order in rotation by extending the hartle - thorne formalism @xcite .",
    "recent work  @xcite addressed the properties of rapidly rotating ns models .",
    "widely - separated binary systems of compact objects in scalar - tensor theory have been studied in @xcite , and the results have been combined with binary pulsar timing data in order to obtain bounds on scalar - matter coupling parameters , in particular @xmath0 .",
    "recent pulsar timing data continue to improve these bounds @xcite .",
    "recently there has been interest in close binaries and mergers , and it was found that _ dynamical scalarization _ may take place : a close ns binary may scalarize even if the nss would not scalarize in isolation @xcite .",
    "the possibility of exploiting this mechanism in order to obtain bounds on scalar - matter coupling parameters from future gravitational wave observations has been explored in @xcite .",
    "a second motivation for this work comes from the surprising finding that there are universal `` i - love - q '' relations between a ns s moment of inertia , tidal love number and quadrupole moment in gr @xcite .",
    "these relations are `` universal '' in the sense that they are independent of the poorly known equation of state ( eos ) of matter at high densities .",
    "yagi and yunes @xcite pointed out that if these relations were different in alternative theories of gravity , measurements of these bulk ns properties could be used to constrain alternative theories or even hint at possible strong - field modifications of gr .",
    "however , stellar structure calculations in scalar - tensor theories show that the i - love - q relations are remarkably insensitive to scalarization for values of the theory parameters allowed by binary pulsar tests @xcite .",
    "if the static properties of nss ( multipole moments and tidal deformation coefficients ) can not be used for this purpose , it seems natural to explore qpos and torsional oscillation frequencies as promising observational avenues to look for smoking guns of new physics .",

    "these studies were motivated by gravitational - wave asteroseismology , i.e. by the prospect of constraining the stellar properties and the eos from direct observations of gravitational radiation from oscillating nss .",
    "this is one of the major science goals of third - generation gravitational - wave detectors such as the einstein telescope , but it seems highly unlikely that we will measure ns oscillation accurately enough to constrain alternative theories of gravity with upcoming second - generation experiments , such as advanced ligo and virgo ( cf .",
    "@xcite for reviews ) .",
    "the connection between torsional oscillations and qpos means that our results have more immediate experimental relevance .",
    "another noteworthy aspect of this work is that , whereas models of nss in alternative theories of gravity usually adopt simple eos models , none of these investigations have studied the effect of scalarization on the structure of the ns crust .",
