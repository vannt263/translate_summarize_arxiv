    "the standard model is extended by including three generations of right - handed ( rh ) neutrinos , which are majorana fermions and couple to the lepton doublets through yukawa couplings .",

    "the cosmological baryon asymmetry is naturally connected to the neutrino properties through the seesaw mechanism@xcite , which is the most natural explanation for the tiny neutrino masses observed in the neutrino oscillation experiments@xcite . as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , the amount of the baryon asymmetry generated in this minimal thermal leptogenesis scenario can be characterized by four parameters : the maximal cp asymmetry @xmath6 , the lightest rh neutrino mass @xmath7 , the effective light neutrino mass @xmath8 and the quadratic mean of the light neutrino masses @xmath9 , under the assumption that the dominant contribution to the lepton asymmetry is given by the decay of the lightest rh neutrino , @xmath10 .",
    "the detailed calculations show that to produce the observed baryon asymmetry , it requires @xmath11 and @xmath12 which corresponds to @xmath13 .",
    "although it is theoretically elegant and simple , this scenario seems to need a high reheating temperature , @xmath14 , which is only marginally compatible with the bound from the gravitino problem , @xmath15 , in supersymmetric models@xcite .",

    "being a dynamical component , the scalar field dark energy is expected to interact with the ordinary matter . in the literature",
    "there have been a lot of studies on the possible couplings of quintessence to baryon , dark matter and photons@xcite .",
    "recent data on the possible variation of the electromagnetic fine structure constant reported in@xcite has triggered interests in studies related to the interactions between quintessence and the matter fields .",
    "recently we have studied various possible interactions , with or without supersymmetry , between quintessence and the matter field of the electroweak standard model@xcite . in a previous paper@xcite we considered a possibility of neutrinos coupling with quintessence and studied its implications on cosmology . in this paper",
    "we propose a scenario that the right - handed neutrinos in the minimal seesaw model couple to quintessence and examine its implications on the thermal leptogenesis .",

    "the form of @xmath30 for a specific model and an explicit form of @xmath31 will be given in sec .",
    "the quintessence dependent masses of the right - handed neutrinos give rise to different majorana masses at the early epoch from that at the present epoch , which is the key for the difference of our model from the usual leptogenesis scenario .",

    "<S> in this paper we consider the possibility of neutrino mass varying during the evolution of the universe and study its implications on leptogenesis . specifically , we take the minimal seesaw model of neutrino masses and introduce a coupling between the right - handed neutrinos and the dark energy scalar field , the quintessence . in our model , </S>",
    "<S> the right - handed neutrino masses change as the quintessence scalar evolves . </S>",
    "<S> we then examine in detail the parameter space of this model allowed by the observed baryon number asymmetry . </S>",
    "<S> our results show that it is possible to lower the reheating temperature in this scenario in comparison with the case that the neutrino masses are unchanged , which helps solve the gravitino problem . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , a degenerate neutrino mass patten with @xmath0 larger than the upper limit given in the minimal leptogenesis scenario is permitted . </S>"
