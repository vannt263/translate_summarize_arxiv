    "many applications , such as nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) spectrometry or mass - spectrometry , measurements are often made of mixtures of physical components which can be identified by their specific spectrum . discriminating between these elementary components or sources can be made by acquiring several measurements at different times or locations in order to observe different mixtures , yielding multispectral data .    in this context ,",
    "blind source separation ( bss ) aims at recovering the spectra from measurements in which the components sources are mixed up together in an unknown way .",
    "the instantaneous linear mixture model assumes that the @xmath0 measurements @xmath1 are linear mixture of @xmath2 sources with spectra @xmath3 . in other words , there exist mixture coefficients @xmath4 such that : @xmath5 where the vectors @xmath6 are added in order to account for noise and model imperfections .",
    "this mixing model can be conveniently rewritten in matrix form : @xmath7 where :    * @xmath0 is the number of measurements .",

    "* @xmath9 is the measurements matrix in which each row is a measurement . * @xmath10 the unknown source matrix in which each row is a spectrum / source . * @xmath11 the unknown mixing matrix which defines the contribution of each source to the measurements .",
    "* @xmath12 is an unknown noise matrix accounting for instrumental noise and/or model imperfections .    with the notation @xmath13{\\sum_{ij}|x_{ij}|^p}$ ] ( frobenius norm for @xmath14 ) and for independent and identically distributed gaussian noise , the maximum - likelihood estimate",
    "is then provided by the standard problem : @xmath15    however , this problem presents an infinite number of solutions which are not necessarily of any interest with respect to a given application .",
    "it is therefore standard to constrain @xmath16 and/or @xmath17 so as to limit the search to minima with a desired structure . in this article , we focus on the assumption that both @xmath16 and @xmath17 are non - negative , yielding non - negative matrix factorization ( nmf ) .",
    "the non - negativity assumption arises naturally in many applications , including text mining @xcite , clustering @xcite , audio processing @xcite and spectrometry @xcite .",
    "indeed , the sources in @xmath17 can for instance be mass or power spectra , which are non - negative , and the mixtures can represent concentrations , which can not be negative either .",
    "the problem is written under the constrained form :    @xmath18    @xmath19 can be the @xmath20 distance such as in or any divergence taking into account other priors on the noise @xcite . in this article",
    ", we focus on gaussian noise and therefore use the @xmath20 distance .",
    "the first publications dealing with this type of problems comes from paatero & tapper @xcite and lee & seung @xcite who provided convergent gradient descent type algorithms .",
    "they emphasized on the importance of the non - negativity constraint which yields a ",
    "part - based \" representation of the data .",
    "indeed , only additive / constructive , and not subtractive / destructive combinations are then allowed in order to represent the data .",
    "nmf shares a couple of indeterminacies with other bss problems :    * _ permutations _ :",
    "if @xmath21 is a permutation , @xmath22 so that one can not hope to recover the order of the rows of @xmath17 and columns of @xmath16 . * _ scales _ : if @xmath23 is diagonal with strictly positive diagonal coefficients , @xmath24 so that if @xmath25 is a solution of , @xmath26 is also solution .",
    "however , unlike problem for which a solution can be conveniently obtained through svd decomposition for instance , nmf is np - hard @xcite and can present numerous local minima . for this reason , additional constraints or priors information can be helpful to recover the sought sources . in the next sections , we impose a sparse prior on the sources , together with their non - negativity .",
    "this article details and extends the preliminary work in @xcite with more complete experimental study and a more advanced understanding of the algorithms .",
    "specifically , noise is accurately accounted for .",
    "it illustrates the proposed approach on realistic data as well . in section  [ sec : soa ] , we first give a review of the state - of - the - art nmf methods and sparse nmf techniques proposed so far .",
    "our approach aims at obtaining a better management of the noise through an ad hoc regularization strategy . for that purpose ,",
    "we introduce in section  [ sec : secngmca ] an extension of the sparse bss algorithm gmca ( generalized morphological component analysis ) to tackle the problem of sparse and non - negative bss from noisy data .",
    "this extension is motivated by the robustness of gmca to additive noise contamination .",
    "we further show that a special care has to be taken to constrain both the sparsity and the non - negativity of the signals . more specifically",
    ", improperly constrained methods can lead to unstable and sub - optimal solutions .",
    "we therefore introduce the non - negative gmca ( ngmca ) which has the ability to provide exact solutions of the constrained and penalized sub - problems , thanks to proximal calculus methods .",
    "last but not least , the proposed algorithm is a simple to use technique since it barely requires any parameter tuning .    in section  [ sec : experiments ] the proposed approach is compared with standard nmf and sparse nmf algorithms .",
    "exhaustive experiments show that ngmca allows for better robustness to noise , large numbers of sources and the conditioning of the mixing matrix , and therefore outperforms most algorithms for a broad variety of settings . finally , in section [ sec",
    ": application ] , we illustrate how ngmca performs also well to separate out synthetic nmr spectra .",
    "the minimization of the cost function from problem is generally solved by alternately updating @xmath16 and @xmath17 . indeed ,",
    "while this problem is not convex , the sub - problem in @xmath16 writes : @xmath27 and the equivalent sub - problem in @xmath17 are often convex and their minimization is therefore much easier .",
    "these alternating updates are then repeated for a large number of iterations .",
    "the first converging nmf algorithm , designed by lee & seung @xcite , updates @xmath16 and @xmath17 with a weighted gradient descent .",
    "the weights insure that the gradient steps do not increase the cost function in and keep @xmath16 and @xmath17 non - negative , since the update can be recast as a pointwise product of non - negative matrices . with @xmath28 the element - wise matrix multiplication and @xmath29 the element - wise matrix division ,",
    "the update rule for @xmath16 and @xmath17 in the case of a least square cost function can be written as follows : @xmath30    the multiplicative update rule is usually considered as a standard because of its convenience , with no parameter to set .",
    "as well , it was the first convergent algorithm proposed to solve the nmf problem .",
    "however , it has been shown to be slow and that the monotone decrease of the algorithm does not insure convergence to a local minimum @xcite .",
    "first - order methods are also used in projected / proximal gradient descent algorithms @xcite , interior point gradient @xcite , and quasi - newton algorithms @xcite .",
    "another standard approach is the alternating least square ( als ) algorithm explained in @xcite , which solves exactly the unconstrained cost function with a pseudo - inverse and projects the result on the non - negativity constraint : @xmath31_+,\\notag \\\\",
    "\\bs_{k+1}&\\leftarrow \\big [ ( \\ba_{k+1}^t\\ba_{k+1})^{-1}\\ba_{k+1}^t\\by\\big]_+,\\label{eq : als_update_rule}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with the operator @xmath32_+= \\text{max}(x,0)$ ] .",
    "this algorithm is also widely used due to its easy implementation and its efficiency in decreasing the cost function .",
    "however , it does not necessarily converge .",
    "in hierarchical als ( hals , @xcite ) , the columns of @xmath16 and rows of @xmath17 are processed one by one .",
    "this yields a simple and fast optimization process to solve the constrained sub - problems .",
    "it is however possible to solve exactly the constrained sub - problems of type at each iteration as follows : @xmath33 in @xcite for instance , lin uses a projected gradient descent subroutine to solve the sub - problems .",
    "guan et al . later provided a faster first - order method @xcite .",
    "it has to be mentioned that other approaches based on geometrical methods have also been investigated to solve nmf problems@xcite ; these approaches are however generally very sensitive to noise .",
    "as was previously stated , non - negativity is not always sufficient to recover the actual sources and mixing matrix . in non - negative ica @xcite ,",
    "one additionally enforces the independence of the sources .",
    "however , this approach is also sensitive to noise .",
    "sparsity , on the other hand , has been shown to provide robustness to noise .",
    "we give a short introduction about this prior in the next section , before presenting sparse nmf algorithms .",
    "+ [ sec : sparsity ]    sparsity constraints have already proved their efficiency to solve a very wide range of inverse problems ( see @xcite and references therein ) . in the context of bss",
    ", sparsity has been shown to increase the diversity between the sources which greatly helps their separation @xcite . in the wide sense ,",
    "a sparse signal is such that its information content is concentrated into only a few large non - zero coefficients , or can be well approximated in such a way .",
    "the sparsity of a signal however depends on the basis or dictionary in which it is expressed .",
    "for instance , a sine wave will be sparse in the fourier domain since it can be encoded with one coefficient in this domain , while in the direct domain most of its coefficients are non - zero : the more a basis captures the structures of a signal , the sparser will be in such a basis . in this article we will however only focus on sparsity in the direct domain .",
    "+ [ sec : sparsealgorithms ] in many applications the non - negativity and sparsity of the sources arise naturally as for instance in ms or nmr spectroscopy .",
    "recent works have emphasized the fact that this knowledge can indeed help perform more relevant factorizations @xcite .",
    "in @xcite , kim & park have proposed to formulate the nmf problem as : @xmath34 in this equation , the sparsity - enforcing regularizer @xmath35 favors solutions where a single source dominates at each sample .",
    "however , it does not enforce the intrinsic sparsity of each of the sources .",
    "the authors made use of an active - set method to solve this problem .",
    "this technique can solve exactly each constrained sub - problem in a similar way than in problem .",
    "however , it is not clear how the parameters @xmath36 and @xmath37 must be set .",
    "the authors provide an implementation on their website .",
    "in @xcite , zdunek & cichocki used a similar regularization term for @xmath17 but with @xmath37 decreasing during the algorithms in order to be more robust to local minima , and without exactly solving the sub - problems .    in @xcite ,",
    "hoyer used a sparse regularization of the form @xmath38 that uniformly enforce the sparsity of @xmath17 .",
    "the author later used a different type of sparse prior in @xcite defined for some vector @xmath39 as follows : @xmath40 this sparseness function goes from 1 when @xmath41 is perfectly sparse only 1 active coefficient to 0 when it is not at all all coefficients active , with the same value .",
    "the idea is therefore to optionally impose a chosen level of sparsity for the sources and/or the mixtures : @xmath42 this problem is solved by using projected gradient descent steps followed by a projection on the sparseness constraint if the constraint is active and with a multiplicative update otherwise .",
    "however , the constraint is directly related to the expected sparseness level of the sources which is not necessarily known beforehand . furthermore , hard - constraining the sparseness level may make the solution very dependent on the sparseness parameters @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "an implementation of this algorithm is available online .",
    "sparse hals @xcite aims at solving problem with a sparsity penalization of the form @xmath38 . in the case of an @xmath20 data fidelity term",
    ", this problem can be rewritten as : @xmath45 in this algorithm , the columns of @xmath16 and lines of @xmath17 are updated one by one . as each sub - problem admits a straightforward analytic solution and no matrix inversion",
    "is required , the hals algorithm turns to be a simple and fast nmf solver . in a recent implementation of the hals @xcite , the parameter @xmath46 of",
    "is automatically managed in order to obtain a required sparsity rate ( defined as the ratio of coefficients smaller than @xmath47 times the largest coefficient ) .",
    "it is important to note that none of these algorithms makes use of the sparse prior explicitly to deal with additive noise ; therefore they may not be robust in case of noise contamination .",
    "in the last decade the use of sparsity in the field of bss has been widely explored . in @xcite ,",
    "the authors have introduced a sparsity - enforcing bss technique coined generalized morphological component analysis ( gmca ) which has been shown to be effective at separating out sparse signals from noisy data .",
    "morphological diversity has been defined in @xcite as a mean to characterize separable sources based on their geometrical structures or morphologies : separable sources with different morphologies do not share the same significant coefficients in a given sparse representation .",
    "when sparsity holds in the direct domain this means that the entries of each source with the most significant amplitudes should be different .",
    "this does not mean that their supports are disjoint but rather their most significant elements should be disjoint .",
    "the objective of this paper is to extend this sparsity - enforcing bss algorithm to deal with non - negative mixtures .",
    "following @xcite , the gmca with an additional non - negative constraint estimates the mixing matrix and the sources by minimizing the following optimization problem :    @xmath48    the @xmath49 pseudo - norm counts non - null coefficients in @xmath17 and therefore limits their number , thus enforcing the sparsity of @xmath17 . in the vein of alternating least squares",
    ", gmca alternately and iteratively estimates the unconstrained least square solution and projects on the non - negativity constraint , with an additional thresholding step for the sources in order to keep only the most significant coefficients .",
    "these updates are provided in lines 6 and 7 of * algorithm [ alg : ngmcanaive ] * where the hard - thresholding operator @xmath50 is defined as follows : @xmath51    it has been emphasized in @xcite that one crucial feature of gmca is the use of a decreasing threshold @xmath46 . at the beginning , this parameter is first set to a high value and then decreases throughout the iterative down to a final value that depends on the noise level .",
    "simulated annealing has already inspired decreasing @xmath20 and @xmath52 regularizations in nmf @xcite .",
    "the motivation behind a decreasing threshold is however different :    1 .   first estimating the mixing matrix from the entries of the sources that have the highest amplitude and thus likely to belong to only one source .",
    "help removing the smallest coefficients which are more sensitive to noise contamination .    in the same way as in the original gmca , for a source with index @xmath53 ,",
    "the threshold @xmath54 is set to @xmath55 where @xmath56 is an empirical estimator ( the median absolute deviation ) of the source noise variation .",
    "@xmath57 is chosen at each iteration in order to obtain a linear increase of the number of active coefficients in @xmath17 , so as to refine the estimation while maintaining some continuity .",
    "the final @xmath57 , @xmath58 , is usually taken in the range @xmath59 $ ] as a trade - off between sufficient denoising and correct separation . indeed , for a sparse signal contaminated by i.i.d .",
    "gaussian noise with standard deviation @xmath60 , thresholding at 3@xmath60 rejects noise samples with probability 0.99 .",
    "still , in bss , too large a final threshold could leave some leakage between the sources .",
    "this ngmca will be considered as a _ naive _ extension of gmca and used as a reference algorithm .",
    "it will be coined naive non - negative gmca ( ngmca@xmath61 ) .",

    "this means that the solution given by this type of algorithm may not be stable and be sub - optimal .",
    "the solution may not provide the sparsest non - negative sources .",
    "this is due to the fact that it deals with the data fidelity term and the constraints in a completely independent way , thus not exactly solving the sub - problems such as in problem .",
    "next , we therefore propose an alternative algorithm which exactly solves the non - negatively constrained and @xmath71 penalized sub - problems and should allow for more robust and stable solutions .",
    "we first propose to tackle the sparse non - negative bss problem using an @xmath72 sparse regularization with @xmath73 such as in .",
    "this then amounts to solving the following optimization problem : @xmath74 where @xmath75 is the characteristic function of the non - negative orthant , which enforces the non - negative constraints .",
    "the characteristic function of the non - negative orthant is defined as : @xmath76 in the previous section , we emphasized that a naive approach based on projected least - square does not necessarily provide a stable and thus optimal solution to the problem . to go beyond the aforementioned naive extension of gmca",
    ", one has to alternatively and exactly minimize the constrained sub - problems in @xmath16 and @xmath17 so as to obtain stable solutions with the sought structure .",
    "let s first have a look at the sub - problem in @xmath17 ; assuming @xmath16 is fixed , the sources are estimated as follows : @xmath77    this problem minimizes a function which can be split into the sum of a differentiable quadratic term and two non - smooth and non - differentiable terms : the @xmath72 norm and the characteristic function of the non - negative orthant @xmath75 .",
    "the choice @xmath78 provides the closest convex surrogate to the sparse @xmath49 norm and in this case , the problem admits a unique solution which , however , can not be formulated explicitly .",
    "fortunately , thanks to recent advances in proximal calculus and splitting techniques , efficient algorithms can be designed to solve this type of problems .",
    "proximal splitting methods @xcite aim at minimizing convex functions which may not be differentiable .",
    "the idea of these methods is to split the cost function into the sum of several convex functions which are alternately locally minimized .",
    "many problems can be decomposed into the general form : @xmath79 where @xmath80 is a smooth and convex data fidelity term ; and @xmath81 a convex regularization term which may not be differentiable .",
    "since @xmath82 is differentiable , it can be locally minimized with a gradient descent step .",
    "when @xmath83 is not , but if it is convex , proper and lower semi - continuous , one can define the proximal operator of @xmath83 : @xmath84 in this case , the following process called forward - backward splitting algorithm ( fbs , see @xcite ) : @xmath85 has been shown to converge to the solution of problem if @xmath86 is @xmath87-lipschitz .",
    "the update of @xmath16 is made by solving the following problem : @xmath88 which can be recast in the general form by defining @xmath89 and @xmath90 . in this case , the gradient of @xmath82 is trivially equal to : @xmath91 , it is @xmath87-lipschitz with @xmath92 where @xmath93 is the matrix spectral norm .",
    "the proximal operator of @xmath83 is the projector onto the non - negative orthant @xmath94_+$ ] .",
    "the fbs then reduces to a projected gradient algorithm similar to the updates in @xcite .",
    "similarly , the update of @xmath17 in problem   with @xmath78 can be solved with fbs , with @xmath95 .",
    "the proximal operator of this function also takes an explicit form usually termed skewed - position soft - thresholding operator :    @xmath96_+,\\ ] ]    where the soft - thresholding operator is defined as : @xmath97_+.\\ ] ]    this soft - thresholding , induced by the @xmath71 norm , is well - known to introduce a bias .",
    "it is therefore customary to use @xmath98 . in the fbs",
    "this is made by replacing the soft - thresholding operator with the hard - thresholding .",
    "rigorously , it is not a proximal operator since @xmath99 is not convex nor semi - continuous ; this means that there is no convergence guarantee of the forward - backward splitting algorithm when hard - thresholding is used .      in the same vein as the naive ngmca introduced in the previous section , @xmath16 and @xmath17",
    "are alternately updated with the exception that , now , each sub - problem is solved exactly , which guarantees that the solution @xmath100 is stable and has the sought structure .",
    "the main steps of the algorithm are given in * algorithm [ alg : ngmcas]*. one must notice that exactly solving each sub - problem is costly since it requires sub - iterations at each step .",
    "fortunately , it has been recently showed that the speed of convergence of the fbs algorithm can be greatly improved by using the multi - step techniques introduced by nesterov @xcite .",
    "both steps have the algorithm make use of an accelerated version of the fbs algorithm @xcite .",
    "a detailed description of how this accelerated algorithm is used to update @xmath17 is given in appendix [ app : fistasubproblem ] .",
    "a special care has to be given to renormalizations since the @xmath71 regularization tends to reduce the norm of @xmath17 .",
    "more specifically , since the norm of @xmath16 can keep increasing to compensate the reduction of the norm of @xmath17 , the algorithm can converge to the degenerate solution @xmath101 and @xmath102 . in the algorithm ,",
    "the columns of @xmath16 are therefore renormalized to @xmath20 unity before updating @xmath17 .",
    "this also assigns to the coefficients of @xmath17 their overall importance in the estimation of @xmath62 .",
    "following the general thresholding strategy used in gmca and its extensions , the threshold @xmath46 decreases from step to step .",
    "however , the strategy used in this version ngmca differs from the one used in the naive approach . in the former ,",
    "the threshold is applied to the sources as defined by their least - square estimate . on the contrary the threshold in ngmca@xmath103 applies at each gradient descent step .",

    "iterative soft - thresholding therefore operates on the gradient and not directly on the source values like in the naive ngmca .",
    "also , unlike with hard - thresholding , a variation of @xmath46 affects all active coefficients .",
    "our strategy consists in starting with a large parameter @xmath106 which forces the coefficients of @xmath17 to be non - increasing in the first iteration .",
