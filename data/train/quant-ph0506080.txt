    "in recent years , the theoretical and experimental use of quantum systems to store , transmit and process information has spurred the study of how much of classical information theory can be extended to the new territory of quantum information and , vice versa , how much novel strategies and concepts are needed that have no classical counterpart .",
    "we shall compare the relations between the rate at which entropy is produced by classical , respectively quantum , ergodic sources , and the complexity of the emitted strings of bits , respectively qubits .    according to kolmogorov @xcite",
    ", the complexity of a bit string is the minimal length of a program for a turing machine ( _ tm _ ) that produces the string .",
    "more in detail , the algorithmic complexity @xmath0 of a string @xmath1 is the length ( counted in the number of bits ) of the shortest program @xmath2 that fed into a universal _ tm _ ( _ utm _ ) @xmath3 yields the string as output , i.e. @xmath4 . for infinite sequences @xmath5 , in analogy with the entropy rate , one defines the _ complexity rate _ as @xmath6 , where @xmath1 is the string consisting of the first @xmath7 bits of @xmath5 , @xcite .",
    "the universality of @xmath3 implies that changing the _ utm _ , the difference in the complexity of a given string is bounded by a constant independent of the string ; it follows that the complexity rate @xmath8 is _ utm_-independent .",
    "different ways to quantify the complexity of qubit strings have been put forward ; in this paper , we shall be concerned with some which directly generalize the classical definition by relating the complexity of qubit strings with their algorithmic description by means of quantum turing machines ( _ qtm _ ) .    for classical ergodic sources , an important theorem , proved by brudno @xcite and conjectured before by zvonkin and levin @xcite ,",
    "establishes that the entropy rate equals the algorithmic complexity per symbol of almost all emitted bit strings .",
    "we shall show that this essentially also holds in quantum information theory .",
    "for stationary classical information sources , the most important parameter is the _ entropy rate _ @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the shannon entropy of the ensembles of strings of length @xmath7 that are emitted according to the probability distribution @xmath11 . according to the shannon - mcmillan - breiman theorem  @xcite",
    ", @xmath12 represents the optimal compression rate at which the information provided by classical ergodic sources can be compressed and then retrieved with negligible probability of error ( in the limit of longer and longer strings ) .",
    "essentially , @xmath13 is the number of bits that are needed for reliable compression of bit strings of length @xmath7 .",
    "intuitively , the less amount of patterns the emitted strings contain , the harder will be their compression , which is based on the presence of regularities and on the elimination of redundancies . from this point of view , the entropy rate measures the randomness of a classical source by means of its compressibility on the average , but does not address the randomness of single strings in the first instance .",
    "this latter problem was approached by kolmogorov @xcite , ( and independently and almost at the same time by chaitin @xcite , and solomonoff @xcite ) , in terms of the difficulty of their description by means of algorithms executed by universal turing machines ( _ utm _ ) , see also  @xcite .    on the whole ,",
    "structureless strings offer no catch for writing down short programs that fed into a computer produce the given strings as outputs .",
    "the intuitive notion of random strings is thus mathematically characterized by kolmogorov by the fact that , for large @xmath7 , the shortest programs that reproduce them can not do better than literal transcription  @xcite .    intuitively , one expects a connection between the randomness of single strings and the average randomness of ensembles of strings . in the classical case , this is exactly the content of a theorem of brudno  @xcite which states that for ergodic sources , the complexity rate of @xmath14-almost all infinite sequences @xmath5 coincides with the entropy rate , i.e. @xmath15 .    quantum sources can be thought as black boxes emitting strings of qubits .",
    "the ensembles of emitted strings of length @xmath7 are described by a density operator @xmath16 on the hilbert spaces @xmath17 , which replaces the probability distribution @xmath11 from the classical case .",
    "the simplest quantum sources are of bernoulli type : they amount to infinite quantum spin chains described by shift - invariant states characterized by local density matrices @xmath16 over @xmath7 sites with a tensor product structure @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is a density operator on @xmath20 .",
    "however , typical ergodic states of quantum spin - chains have richer structures that could be used as quantum sources : the local states @xmath16 , not anymore tensor products , would describe emitted @xmath21qubit strings which are correlated density matrices .",
    "similarly to classical information sources , quantum stationary sources ( shift - invariant chains ) are characterized by their entropy rate @xmath22 , where @xmath23 denotes the von neumann entropy of the density matrix @xmath16 .",
    "the quantum extension of the shannon - mcmillan theorem was first obtained in  @xcite for bernoulli sources , then a partial assertion was obtained for the restricted class of completely ergodic sources in  @xcite , and finally in  @xcite , a complete quantum extension was shown for general ergodic sources .",
    "the latter result is based on the construction of subspaces of dimension close to @xmath24 , being typical for the source , in the sense that for sufficiently large block length @xmath7 , their corresponding orthogonal projectors have an expectation value arbitrarily close to @xmath25 with respect to the state of the quantum source .",
    "these typical subspaces have subsequently been used to construct compression protocols  @xcite .",
    "the concept of a universal quantum turing machine ( _ uqtm _ ) as a precise mathematical model for quantum computation was first proposed by deutsch @xcite .",
    "the detailed construction of _ uqtms _ can be found in  @xcite : these machines work analogously to classical _ tm_s , that is they consist of a read / write head , a set of internal control states and input / output tapes .",
    "however , the local transition functions among the machine s configurations ( the programs or quantum algorithms ) are given in terms of probability amplitudes , implying the possibility of linear superpositions of the machine s configurations . the quantum algorithms work reversibly .",
    "they correspond to unitary actions of the _ uqtm _ as a whole .",
    "an element of irreversibility appears only when the output tape information is extracted by tracing away the other degrees of freedom of the _",
    "uqtm_. this provides linear superpositions as well as mixtures of the output tape configurations consisting of the local states @xmath26 and blanks @xmath27 , which are elements of the so - called _",
    "computational basis_. the reversibility of the _ uqtm _",
    "s time evolution is to be contrasted with recent models of quantum computation that are based on measurements on large entangled states , that is on irreversible processes , subsequently performed in accordance to the outcomes of the previous ones  @xcite . in this paper",
    "we shall be concerned with bernstein - vazirani - type _ uqtms _ whose inputs and outputs may be bit or qubit strings @xcite .",
    "given the theoretical possibility of universal computing machines working in agreement with the quantum rules , it was a natural step to extend the problem of algorithmic descriptions as a complexity measure to the quantum case .",
    "contrary to the classical case , where different formulations are equivalent , several inequivalent possibilities are available in the quantum setting . in the following",
    ", we shall use the definitions in  @xcite which , roughly speaking , say that the algorithmic complexity of a qubit string @xmath19 is the logarithm in base @xmath28 of the dimension of the smallest hilbert space ( spanned by computational basis vectors ) containing a quantum state that , once fed into a _ uqtm _ , makes the _ uqtm _ compute the output @xmath19 and halt .    in general , quantum states",
    "can not be perfectly distinguished .",
    "thus , it makes sense to allow some tolerance in the accuracy of the machine s output . as explained below , there are two natural ways to deal with this , leading to two ( closely related ) different complexity notions @xmath29 and @xmath30 , which correspond to asymptotically vanishing , respectively small but fixed tolerance .    both quantum algorithmic complexities @xmath29 and @xmath30 are thus measured in terms of the length of _ quantum _ descriptions of qubit strings , in contrast to another definition  @xcite which defines the complexity of a qubit string as the length of its shortest _ classical _ description .",
    "a third definition  @xcite is instead based on an extension of the classical notion of universal probability to that of universal density matrices .",
    "the study of the relations among these proposals is still in a very preliminary stage . for an approach to quantum complexity based on the amount of resources ( quantum gates ) needed to implement a quantum circuit reproducing a given qubit string",
    "see  @xcite .",
    "the main result of this work is the proof of a weaker form of brudno s theorem , connecting the quantum entropy rate @xmath31 and the quantum algorithmic complexities @xmath29 and @xmath30 of pure states emitted by quantum ergodic sources .",
    "it will be proved that there are sequences of typical subspaces of @xmath17 , such that the complexity rates @xmath32 and @xmath33 of any of their pure - state projectors @xmath34 can be made as close to the entropy rate @xmath31 as one wants by choosing @xmath7 large enough , and there are no such sequences with a smaller expected complexity rate .",
    "the paper is divided as follows . in section 2 , a short review of the @xmath35-algebraic approach to quantum sources",
    "is given , while section 3 states as our main result a quantum version of brudno s theorem . in section 4 ,",
    "a detailed survey of _ qtm_s and of the notion of _ quantum kolmogorov complexity _ is presented . in section 5 ,",
    "based on a quantum counting argument , a lower bound is given for the quantum kolmogorov complexity per qubit , while an upper bound is obtained in section 5 by explicit construction of a short quantum algorithm able to reproduce any pure state projector @xmath34 belonging to a particular sequence of high probability subspaces .",
    "in order to formulate our main result rigorously , we start with a brief introduction to the relevant concepts of the formalism of quasi - local @xmath35-algebras which is the most suited one for dealing with quantum spin chains . at the same time",
    ", we shall fix the notations .",
    "we shall consider the lattice @xmath36 and assign to each site @xmath37 a @xmath35-algebra @xmath38 being a copy of a fixed finite - dimensional algebra @xmath39 , in the sense that there exists a @xmath40-isomorphism @xmath41 . to simplify notations ,",
    "we write @xmath42 for @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "the algebra of observables associated to a finite @xmath45 is defined by @xmath46 .",
    "observe that for @xmath47 we have @xmath48 and there is a canonical embedding of @xmath49 into @xmath50 given by @xmath51 , where @xmath52 and @xmath53 denotes the identity of @xmath54 .",
    "the infinite - dimensional quasi - local @xmath35-algebra @xmath55 is the norm completion of the normed algebra @xmath56 , where the union is taken over all finite subsets @xmath57 .    in the present paper",
    ", we mainly deal with qubits , which are the quantum counterpart of classical bits .",
    "thus , in the following , we restrict our considerations to the case where @xmath39 is the algebra of observables of a qubit , i.e. the algebra @xmath58 of @xmath59 matrices acting on @xmath60 . since every finite - dimensional unital @xmath35-algebra @xmath39 is @xmath40-isomorphic to a subalgebra of @xmath61 for some @xmath62 ,",
    "our results contain the general case of arbitrary @xmath39 .",
    "moreover , the case of classical bits is covered by @xmath39 being the subalgebra of @xmath58 consisting of diagonal matrices only .",
    "similarly , we think of @xmath49 as the algebra of observables of qubit strings of length @xmath63 , namely the algebra @xmath64 of @xmath65 matrices acting on the hilbert space @xmath66",
    ". the quasi - local algebra @xmath55 corresponds to the doubly - infinite qubit strings .",
    "the ( right ) shift @xmath67 is a @xmath40-automorphism on @xmath68 uniquely defined by its action on local observables @xmath69}\\mapsto a\\in\\mathcal{a}_{[m+1,n+1]}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath70 \\subset \\mathbb{z}$ ] is an integer interval .",
    "a state @xmath71 on @xmath55 is a normalized positive linear functional on @xmath68 .",
    "each local state @xmath72 , @xmath73 finite , corresponds to a density operator @xmath74 by the relation @xmath75 , for all @xmath76 , where @xmath77 is the trace on @xmath78 .",
    "the density operator @xmath79 is a positive matrix acting on the hilbert space @xmath80 associated with @xmath81 satisfying the normalization condition @xmath82 .",
    "the simplest @xmath79 correspond to one - dimensional projectors @xmath83 onto vectors @xmath84 and are called pure states , while general density operators are linear convex combinations of one - dimensional projectors : @xmath85 , @xmath86 , @xmath87 .",
    "we denote by @xmath88 the convex set of density operators acting on a ( possibly infinite - dimensional ) hilbert space @xmath89 , whence @xmath90 .",
    "a state @xmath91 on @xmath55 corresponds one - to - one to a family of density operators @xmath74 , @xmath92 finite , fulfilling the consistency condition @xmath93 for @xmath94 , where @xmath95 denotes the partial trace over the local algebra @xmath49 which is computed with respect to any orthonormal basis in the associated hilbert space @xmath80 .",
    "notice that a state @xmath71 with @xmath96 , i.e. a shift - invariant state , is uniquely determined by a consistent sequence of density operators @xmath97 in @xmath98 corresponding to the local states @xmath99 , where @xmath100 denotes the integer interval @xmath101\\subset \\mathbb{z}$ ] , for each @xmath102 .",
    "as motivated in the introduction , in the information - theoretical context , we interpret the tuple @xmath103 describing the quantum spin chain as a stationary quantum source .",
    "the von neumann entropy of a density matrix @xmath19 is @xmath104 . by the subadditivity of @xmath105 for a shift - invariant state @xmath71 on @xmath55 , the following limit , the quantum entropy rate , exists @xmath106 the set of shift - invariant states on @xmath55 is convex and compact in the weak@xmath40-topology .",
    "the extremal points of this set are called ergodic states : they are those states which can not be decomposed into linear convex combinations of other shift - invariant states . notice that in particular the shift - invariant product states defined by a sequence of density matrices @xmath107 , @xmath108 , where @xmath109 is a fixed @xmath110 density matrix , are ergodic .",
    "they are the quantum counterparts of bernoulli ( i.i.d . )",
    "most of the results in quantum information theory concern such sources , but , as mentioned in the introduction , more general ergodic quantum sources allowing correlations can be considered .    more concretely , the typical quantum source that has first been considered was a finite - dimensional quantum system emitting vector states @xmath111 with probabilities @xmath112 .",
    "the state of such a source is the density matrix @xmath113 being an element of the full matrix algebra @xmath114 ; furthermore , the most natural source of qubit strings of length @xmath7 is the one that emits vectors @xmath115 independently one after the other at each stroke of time . is a vector in a hilbert space and a ket @xmath116 is its dual vector . ]",
    "the corresponding state after @xmath7 emissions is thus the tensor product @xmath117    in the following , we shall deal with the more general case of _ ergodic _ sources defined above , which naturally appear e.g. in statistical mechanics ( compare 1d spin chains with finite - range interaction ) .    when restricted to act only on @xmath7 successive chain sites , namely on the local algebra @xmath118",
    ", these states correspond to density matrices @xmath16 acting on @xmath17 which are not simply tensor products , but may contain classical correlations and entanglement .",
    "the qubit strings of length @xmath7 emitted by these sources are generic density matrices @xmath119 acting on @xmath17 , which are compatible with the state of the source @xmath71 in the sense that @xmath120 , where @xmath121 denotes the support projector of the operator @xmath119 , that is the orthogonal projection onto the subspace where @xmath119 can not vanish .",
    "more concretely , @xmath16 can be decomposed in uncountably many different ways into convex decompositions @xmath122 in terms of other density matrices @xmath123 on the local algebra @xmath124 each one of which describes a possible qubit string of length @xmath7 emitted by the source .",
    "it turns out that the rates of the complexities @xmath29 ( approximation - scheme complexity ) and @xmath30 ( finite - accuracy complexity ) of the typical pure states of qubit strings generated by an ergodic quantum source @xmath125 are asymptotically equal to the entropy rate @xmath126 of the source .",
    "a precise formulation of this result is the content of the following theorem .",
    "it can be seen as a quantum extension of brudno s theorem as a convergence in probability statement , while the original formulation of brudno s result is an almost sure statement .",

    "in contrast to the classical situation , there are uncountably many qubit strings that can not be perfectly distinguished by means of any quantum measurement .",

    "@xcite , and is on the other hand intimately connected with the notion of entropy . the latter relation is best exemplified in the case of longer and longer strings : by taking the ratio of the complexity with respect to the number of bits , one gets a _ complexity per symbol _ which a theorem of brudno shows to be equal to the _ entropy per symbol _ of almost all sequences emitted by ergodic sources .",
    "the fast development of quantum information and computation , with the formalization of the concept of _ uqtms _ , quite naturally brought with itself the need of extending the notion of algorithmic complexity to the quantum setting . within such a broader context , the ultimate goal is again a mathematical theory of the randomness of quantum objects .",
    "there are two possible algorithmic descriptions of qubit strings : either by means of bit - programs or of qubit - programs . in this work ,",
    "we have considered a qubit - based _ quantum algorithmic complexity _ , namely constructed in terms of quantum descriptions of quantum objects .",

    "possible strengthening of this relation following the strategy which permits the formulation of a quantum breiman theorem starting from the quantum shannon - mcmillan noiseless coding theorem  @xcite will be the matter of future investigations .    in order to assert that this choice of quantum complexity as a formalization of  quantum randomness \" is as good as its classical counterpart in relation to  classical randomness ",
    ", one ought to compare it with the other proposals that have been put forward : not only with the quantum complexity based on classical descriptions of quantum objects  @xcite , but also with the one based on the notion of _ universal density matrices _  @xcite .    in relation to vitanyi s",
    "approach , the comparison essentially boils down to understanding whether a classical description of qubit strings requires more classical bits than @xmath31 qubits per hilbert space dimension .",
    "an indication that this is likely to be the case may be related to the existence of entangled states .    in relation to gacs",
    "approach , the clue is provided by the possible formulation of  quantum martin - lf  tests in terms of measurement processes projecting onto low - probability subspaces , the quantum counterparts of classical untypical sets .",
    "one can not however expect classical - like equivalences among the various definitions .",
    "it is indeed a likely consequence of the very structure of quantum theory that a same classical notion may be extended in different inequivalent ways , all of them reflecting a specific aspect of that structure .",
    "this fact is most clearly seen in the case of quantum dynamical entropies ( compare for instance  @xcite ) where one definition can capture dynamical features which are precluded to another .",
