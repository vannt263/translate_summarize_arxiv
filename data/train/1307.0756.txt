    "the boolean model appeared early in applied probability , typically in attempts to describe random geometrical structures of physics and materials science by overlapping spherical grains .",
    "it was matheron who created the general theory of the boolean model and studied its basic properties @xcite .",
    "let @xmath0 be a stationary poisson point process in @xmath1 with intensity @xmath2 , and let @xmath3 be independent , identically distributed random compact sets with distribution @xmath4 , which are independent of the point process @xmath5 . then , under the integrability assumption on @xmath4 , the union of the translated grains @xmath6 is a random closed set , which is called the stationary boolean model with intensity @xmath7 and grain distribution @xmath4 ; see @xcite for a review of recent developments in this context .",
    "the boolean model is a popular model in materials science and the physics of heterogeneous media @xcite relating shape to physical properties .",
    "many porous materials are built up by the successive addition of inclusions ( grains , pores or cracks ) within a background phase @xcite ; such materials can be modeled by a boolean process .",
    "it has been applied , in particular , on foamed materials , ceramic powders @xcite , wood composites @xcite , sedimentary rock @xcite , fractured materials or hydrating cement - based materials @xcite .",
    "depending on the specific application , either the pore space or the solid phase of a material may be described as a boolean model @xmath8 .",
    "for example , the pore space of bread @xcite was modeled by the boolean model , whereas for sintered ceramic composites it is the solid phase which is described as a boolean model ; see @xcite . in particular , for the reconstruction of two - phase materials the boolean model is successful , which finally allows excellent predictions of the shape dependence of thermodynamic quantities @xcite and transport properties @xcite in porous media .",
    "various other physical phenomena can be described and studied by the boolean model including percolation @xcite and elasticity @xcite .",
    "many attempts have been made to predict mechanical properties from structural features ; some of these are based on boolean models and other random set models @xcite . in practice ,",
    "measurements taken on samples of a random structure are used to adjust the boolean model to the given structure .",
    "then one tries to draw reasonable conclusions from the properties of the properly adjusted boolean model on physical properties of the real structure .",
    "obviously it is crucial to take measurements which capture the significant geometric properties of the real structure and have as little redundancy as possible . here",
    "the scalar - valued intrinsic volume densities have already shown to be a useful choice @xcite .",
    "on the foundational side , the importance of the intrinsic volumes @xmath9 is expressed by hadwiger s @xcite famous characterization theorem , which states that the intrinsic volumes are a basis of the space of real - valued continuous , additive and motion invariant functionals on the space of convex bodies @xmath10 . as a consequence of the motion invariance , the intrinsic volumes reach their limits when it comes to the proper characterization of non - isotropic structures . therefore one is interested in finding functionals which are sensitive to anisotropy and have as little redundancy as possible .",
    "a set of functionals which serves these purposes has been found and explored in recent years .",
    "all this has been done in the more general context of convex geometric analysis where the classification and characterization of additive functionals ( valuations ) on the space of convex bodies @xmath11 enjoying specific properties is a highly active field of research .",
    "generalizations of hadwiger s result , which concerns scalar - valued functionals , to vector - valued valuations which are motion covariant have already been found in the early 70s by hadwiger and schneider @xcite .",
    "more recently , tensor - valued valuations of higher rank have come into focus and it immediately turned out that in this case a basis can not be determined that easily .",
    "the current mathematical study of tensor valuations has been initiated by mcmullen @xcite . for @xmath12 and integers @xmath13 and @xmath14 ,",
    "the minkowski tensors are defined by @xmath15 and @xmath16 where we use the notation introduced in section [ sectionprel ] . in @xcite mcmullen",
    "conjectured that the basic tensor valuations @xmath17 with @xmath18 , span the space of continuous , additive and isometry covariant @xmath19-valued functionals , for every @xmath20 .",
    "furthermore , it was already observed by mcmullen that the basic tensor valuations satisfy linear dependencies and therefore do not form a basis of the vector space they span .",
    "mcmullen s conjecture was almost immediately confirmed by alesker @xcite .",
    "later it was shown how a basis can be constructed and the dimension of the corresponding vector spaces was determined ; see @xcite .",
    "more information on the mathematical and physical background of the minkowski tensors can be found in @xcite .",
    "in particular , in @xcite minkowski tensors have already proved to be useful shape descriptors for anisotropic structures . of the many characterization theorems for valuations with values in some abelian group @xmath21 and related to the present work",
    ", we only mention @xcite which are concerned with characterizations of curvature measures , moment vectors , moment matrices , covariance matrices and local tensor valuations .",
    "a nice visualisation of a boolean model can be obtained by a dewetting process of thin liquid films .",
    "films rupture at random distributed defects and form holes , which grow in time , until the fluid material is pushed completely in thin filaments , which finally break up in droplets @xcite .",
    "the time dependence of the experimentally measured minkowski functionals of the film regions can be compared with analytic minkowski density formulas for a boolean model , which shows a good agreement .",
    "other applications of a boolean model on characterising spatial patterns are possible in the analysis of inhomogeneous distributions of galaxies @xcite , the measurement of biometrical data @xcite , or in the estimation of percolation thresholds @xcite . while in most of the applications , the boolean model was isotropic ( and stationary ) , we focus here the non - isotropic case and analyze its distributional properties by tensorial quantities , the minkowski tensors .",
    "non - isotropic ( and non - stationary ) boolean models should be exploited further , since many applications are possible on composite and porous media but also on complex fluids such as colloidal dispersions , which show qualitatively rich phase diagrams and spatial structures .",
    "minkowski tensors have already been used , for instance , to derive a density functional theory for non - spherical particles @xcite .",
    "furthermore , local stereological estimators of the minkowski tensors have been developed based on rotational integral formulas @xcite .",
    "finally , we emphasize that in two and three dimensions , algorithms and free software for the computation of the minkowski tensors are available ; see @xcite .",
    "the structure and scope of the article are as follows .",
