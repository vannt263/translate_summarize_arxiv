    "lattice simulations @xcite of quantum chromodynamics predict that nuclear matter , at extreme conditions , e.g. high temperature or pressure , can undergo a confinement - deconfinement cross - over transition .",
    "the deconfined matter , comprising quarks and gluons , even at very high temperature , is not totally free from interaction and one calls the matter strongly interacting quark gluon plasma ( sqgp ) .",
    "heavy ion collisions at relativistic energies provides a convenient method to produce and study properties qcd matter at extreme conditions .",
    "recent experiments in au+au collisions at rhic @xcite , produced convincing evidences that in central and mid - central au+au collisions , a hot , dense , strongly interacting , collective qcd matter is created .",
    "whether the matter can be characterized as the lattice qcd @xcite predicted quark - gluon - plasma ( qgp ) or not , is still a question of debate .    for long ,",
    "strangeness enhancement is considered as a signature of qgp formation @xcite . in qgp environment",
    ", @xmath5 is abundant .",
    "if not annihilated before hadronisation , early produced strange and anti - strange quarks will coalesce in to strange hadrons and compared to elementary pp collisions , strange particle production will be enhanced .",
    "however , strangeness enhancement could also be obtained in a purely hadronic scenario , mainly due to volume effect @xcite .",
    "strangeness production in small volume elementary pp collisions can be canonically suppressed due to strict strangeness conservation @xcite . in bigger volume aa collisions ,",
    "locally , strangeness conservation condition can be relaxed to produce strange particles . in the language of statistical mechanics , while canonical ensemble is applicable in pp collision , grand canonical ensemble is more appropriate in heavy ion collisions .",
    "additionally , strange particle phase space appears to be undersaturated in elementary pp or peripheral heavy ion collisions @xcite .",
    "the deviation from strangeness equilibrium is parameterized by strangeness undersaturation factor @xmath6 . in a statistical model , fits to particle multiplicities are unsatisfactory , unless @xmath6 is not accounted for .",
    "@xmath6 shows an increasing trend from ags to rhic energy . at rhic , @xmath7 .",
    "a possible interpretation is that the total amount of strangeness available at the hadronisation is determined in the pre - hadronic stage .",
    "the change in @xmath6 between pp and a+a collisions then reflect the difference between initial conditions of the respective systems .",
    "recently star collaboration published their measurements of @xmath0 production in au+au and cu+cu collisions at rhic energy ( @xmath1=200 gev ) @xcite .",
    "both in au+au and cu+cu collisions , @xmath0 meson production is enhanced .",
    "the enhancement factor is @xmath8 2 .",
    "@xmath9 mesons are hidden strange particles , unaffected by the canonical suppression .",
    "star data on @xmath0 meson production is consistent with models with recombination of thermal strange quarks , indicating that in au+au collisions a robust partonic system in created @xcite .",
    "interestingly , strangeness enhancement is observed even at much lower energy . at sps , na49 collaboration measured @xmath0 meson production in 20a , 30a , 40a , 80a and 158a gev pb+pb collisions @xcite .",
    "@xmath0 meson production is enhanced also at sps energy .",
    "enhancement factor , @xmath83 - 4 , is even larger than that in rhic collisions .",
    "one naturally wonders about the sources of @xmath0 meson enhancement in low sps energy collisions .",
    "is it due to formation of a deconfined medium like in au+au collisions at rhic ?",
    "na49 collaboration analyzed the data in the statistical hadronisation model @xcite .",
    "statistical hadronisation model , including the strangeness undersaturation factor @xmath6 , provides a good description of the data .",
    "apparently , as in au+au collisions at rhic , initial partonic content of the system also drive the @xmath0 meson production in pb+pb collisions at sps .",
    "statistical hadronisation model is not a dynamic model .",
    "a statistical model can not comment whether or not the initial system is in a deconfined state .",
    "relativistic hydrodynamics is the only dynamical model , which can , within certain limitations , comment on the initial condition of the fluid .",
    "it is assumed that in the collision a fireball is produced .",
    "constituents of the fireball collide frequently to establish local thermal equilibrium sufficiently fast and after a certain ( proper ) time @xmath10 , hydrodynamics become applicable . if the macroscopic properties of the fluid e.g. energy density , pressure , velocity etc . are known at the equilibration time @xmath10 , the relativistic hydrodynamic equations ( i.e. energy - momentum conservation equations ) can be solved to give the space - time evolution of the fireball till a given freeze - out condition such that interactions between the constituents are too weak to continue the evolution . using suitable algorithm ( e.g. cooper - frye )",
    "information at the freeze - out can be converted into particle spectra and can be directly compared with the experimental data .",
    "thus , hydrodynamics , in an indirect way , can characterize the initial condition of the medium produced in heavy ion collisions .",
    "hydrodynamics equations are closed only with an equation of state ( eos ) and one can investigate the possibility of phase transition in the medium .    in the present paper , in an ideal hydrodynamic model",
    ", we have analyzed the na49 data @xcite on @xmath0 meson production in 20 - 158 a gev central pb+pb collisions and the star data @xcite on @xmath0 meson production in @xmath1=62 , 130 and 200 gev central au+au collisions , effectively scanning the c.m .",
    "energy range @xmath1=6 - 200 gev",
    ". an important ingredient of the model is a lattice based eos with a confinement - deconfinement cross over transition at @xmath2=196 mev .",
    "our analysis indicate that ideal hydrodynamics , with the lattice based eos , reasonably well explain the @xmath0 meson production in the energy range , @xmath11=6 - 200 gev .",
    "analysis also indicate that above a threshold energy @xmath12 gev , the medium crosses over from a confined phase to a deconfined phase .",
    "it was also indicated that the transition is rather sharp , occuring over a narrow energy range @xmath13 gev .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section [ sec2 ] , we briefly describe the construction of a lattice based equation of state .",
    "initial conditions used to compute fluid evolution etc . , are also discussed in section [ sec2 ] .",
    "experimental data e.g. @xmath0 meson s multiplicity , @xmath14-spectra , mean @xmath14 are analyzed in section [ sec3 ] .",
    "summary and conclusions are given in section [ sec4 ] .",
    "assuming boost - invariance , we have solved the energy - momentum conservation equation , @xmath15 in @xmath16 coordinates , using the code \" ` azhydro \" , details of which can be found in @xcite .",
    "as mentioned earlier , we have used a lattice based equation of state .",
    "equation of state ( eos ) is one of the most important inputs of a hydrodynamic model . through this",
    "input macroscopic hydrodynamic models make contact with the microscopic world .",
    "most of the hydrodynamical calculations are performed with eos with a 1st order phase transition .",
    "however , lattice simulations @xcite indicate that confinement to deconfinement transition is a cross over , rather than a 1st or 2nd order phase transition .",
    "it is then essential that hydrodynamic simulations are done with eos with cross - over transition rather than with eos with 1st or 2nd order transition .",
    "huovinen @xcite reported an ideal hydrodynamic simulation with a cross - over phase transition .",
    "he concluded that an eos with 1st order phase transition better explain the experimental data ( e.g. elliptic flow of proton or antiproton ) than an eos with cross over transition .",
    "presently , we have used an eos based on recent lattice simulation of cheng et al .",
    "@xcite . in fig.[f1 ] , simulation results @xcite for the entropy density is shown .",
    "the dotted line in fig.[f1 ] is a parameterisation of the entropy density .",
    "@xmath17[1+tanh\\frac{t - t_c}{\\delta t}],\\ ] ]    with @xmath18=0.64 , @xmath19=6.93 , @xmath20=0.55 , @xmath21=196 mev , @xmath22 . from the parametric form of the entropy density",

    "the entropy density of the complete eos is obtained as ,    @xmath24s_{hrg } + 0.5 [ 1-tanh(x)]s_{lattice}%lattice}\\ ] ]    with @xmath25 .",
    "compared to lattice simulation , entropy density in hrg drops slowly at low temperature .",
    "it is consistent with the observation that at low temperature , trace anomaly , @xmath26 drops faster in lattice simulation than in a hrg model @xcite .",
    "it is difficult to resolve whether the discrepancy between lattice simulations at low temperature and hrg model is due to failure of hrg model at lower temperature or due to the difficulty in resolving low energy hadron spectrum on a rather coarse lattice @xcite .",
    "we note that , lattice simulations @xcite were performed with zero baryon density @xmath27=0 .",
    "@xmath27=0 is only approximately valid in rhic energy collisions . in lower sps energy collisions",
    ", there can be considerable stopping and @xmath27 can be appreciably different from zero .",
    "however , lattice simulations with finite baryon density have yet not reached the state of application .",
    "we therefore continue to use the @xmath27=0 lattice based eos , even at low sps energy collisions .",

    "the rapidity distribution do not show plateau like structure , rather the distribution could be fitted with a gaussian , width of the gaussian increasing with energy @xcite .",

    "the confinement - deconfinement transition will be sharper than estimated presently .",
    "to summarise , assuming that in high energy heavy ion collisions , a fluid medium is created , which become amenable to hydrodynamic description after @xmath10=0.6 fm , we have analysed the recent na49 data on @xmath0 meson production in pb+pb collisions in the energy range @xmath1=6.3 - 17.3 gev and the star data on @xmath0 meson production in @xmath1=62,130 and 200 gev au+au collisions .",
