    "the 2d es spectra obtained with femtosecond and picosecond time resolutions give a wealth of information regarding both evolution of population and coherent states of the molecular system under consideration .",
    "special attention should be taken into consideration when analyzing the processes occurring on different timescales .",
    "thus , before turning to the analysis of the femtosecond evolution of the measured spectra , let us discuss a few mechanisms that contribute to the spectral lineshape formation : pulse overlap , spectral diffusion , dynamic stokes shift and coherence beatings .",
    "they can be important factors that might lead to ambiguities and errors when interpreting the time - dependencies of the 2d spectrum .",
    "pulse overlap effects dominate during the initial delay time evolution , comparable to the length of the laser pulses .",
    "that is , besides the double - coherence pathways , additional rephasing contributions appear in the phase matching direction when the @xmath8 and @xmath9 pulses do overlap@xcite .",
    "therefore , the initial evolution of the 2d spectrum ( in our case first 30  fs ) is dominated by the sharp decay of these additional pulse - overlap contributions and should be considered very carefully as they could be confused with some ultra - fast relaxation mechanisms .",
    "spectral diffusion can also make an evident influence on the 2d spectrum@xcite .",
    "it accounts for the loss of correlation of the narrow - bandwidth excitation and spectrum is manifested by the increase of the anti - diagonal width of the peaks in the absorptive 2d spectrum with the delay time .",
    "the spectral diffusion affects both the rephasing and nonrephasing spectral contributions . for a simple two - level system the rate of the spectral diffusion can be related to the bath relaxation time and results in exponential decrease of the height of the main absorption peak in the 2d spectrum@xcite .",
    "as such an exponential evolution overlaps with the other temporal lineshape formation mechanisms , it becomes troublesome not to overinterpret the spectral diffusion as a relaxation - type signal . comparing the evolution of the peak height against its anti",
    "- diagonal width provides a possible way to evaluate the contribution of the spectral diffusion .",
    "however , sometimies this is not possible because of overlaps of closely - positioned coupled states and cross - peaks .",
    "the other method is to check the time evolution of the integral over some area of the spectrum in the vicinity of the peak under consideration in the absorptive spectrum .",
    "if the radius of the integrated area is larger than the homogeneous linewidth , the spectral diffusion is averaged out from such signal .",
    "system states during the delay time @xmath20 experience relaxation processes through the vibronic pathways .",
    "such a vibrational cooling is often referred to as the dynamic stokes shift and expressing itself as the shifting of peaks down in the energy scale along the emission axis with @xmath20 in the 2d spectrum .",
    "as the ground state bleaching and excited state emission contributions can , in principle , experience the dynamic stokes shift on different timescales , it can cause some overlaps of these positive and negative contributions , giving a complex time - dependence of both diagonal peaks and cross - peaks .",
    "moreover , the timescale of the dynamic stokes shift can be around a few hundreds of femtoseconds  therefore , without a careful analysis such evolution might once again be wrongly assigned to some ultrafast relaxation pathway .    finally , the initial evolution of the 2d spectrum is seriously affected by the coherence beatings .",
    "lifetimes of the electronic coherences can be as short as tens of femtoseconds and vibrational / vibronic coherences can result in oscillations for as long as a few picoseconds .",
    "although static disorder tends to dephase electronic coherences very quickly , their contribution to the initial dynamics can still be substantial .",
    "for example , in spectra recorded with a low @xmath20 resolution , the coherent signal adding on top of the population evolution can be as significant as the population signal itself .",
    "thus , coherence beatings can seriously impede interpretations of the population dynamics if the 2d spectrum is of low resolution in delay time @xmath20 .",
    "in the 2d es spectra of fcp we would expect coherences of various origins and amplitudes to appear : ground state vibrational coherences of chl  @xmath1 , chl  @xmath2 and fx , excited state vibronic coherences of the same frequencies , mixed coherences of shifted or combinational frequencies@xcite and electronic coherences due to excitonic coupling of chlorophylls . such distinction between the coherences of different origin",
    "is conveniently observed in the fourier amplitude maps . in the rephasing spectrum ,",
    "ground state coherences are manifested by strong beatings below and on the diagonal@xcite while the corresponding vibronic coherences  symmetrically above the diagonal@xcite .",
    "mixed coherences , that represent superpositions of quantum mechanically mixed states , are observed as complex and asymmetric patterns of oscillating peaks in the fourier maps@xcite .",
    "electronic coherences in the rephasing spectrum manifest themselves exclusively as oscillatory cross - peaks and no oscillations on the diagonal and vice versa for the nonrephasing spectrum@xcite .",
    "however , oscillations in the nonrephasing contribution of the spectrum are more sensitive to static disorder of pigment energies and , thus , in the systems with large inhomogeneous broadening coherences from the rephasing contributions will dominate over those from the nonrephasing contribution .",
    "let us discuss about the origin of coherences in the spectra of fcp by comparing the obtained dependencies of the intensity of oscillations ( fig .",
    "[ fig : frobenius]a ) with known frequencies corresponding to the intramolecular vibrational modes of chl  @xmath1 .",
    "we refer to the hole burning experiments on single chlorophylls carried out in 1.6  k by gillie  et  al.@xcite ( green sticks in fig .",
    "[ fig : frobenius]b ) and a recent study of du  et  al.@xcite , in which the frequencies were obtained from the time and frequency resolved pump  probe spectra at 297  k by the fourier analysis , similar to the one employed here .",
    "frequencies , reported in these studies as well as obtained by our experiment , are summarized in table  [ tab : frequencies ] .",

    "obviously , the situation calls for more delaited study of vibrational / vibronic coherences of chlorophylls in coupled pigment  protein complexes .    after performing analysis of the fourier maps of the other coherences , we were not able to extract any oscillatory features that could be assigned to the vibrational / vibronic coherences of chl  @xmath2",
    "this is probably due to too weak signal .",
    "indeed , the chl  @xmath2 absorption signal is at least 5 times weaker than the main absorption band of chl  @xmath1 .",
    "thus , the signal of coherent oscillations might become too weak to be distinguished from the experimental noise .",
    "a close inspection of oscillations around the proposed @xmath0 transition band of chl @xmath2 ( @xmath68 ) revealed only very weak signatures of vibrational coherences of chl @xmath1 and fx .",
    "the former might be coming from the nonrephasing vibrational contribution and the latter  from the overlap of a wide peak of the fucoxanthin ground state vibrational coherence .",
    "obviously , the strongest high - frequency electronic coherence in the spectra of fcp would be the coherence of @xmath0 transitions of excitonically coupled chl  @xmath2 and chl  @xmath1 .",
    "from the position of the corresponding peaks in the absorption spectrum , the frequency of such a coherence should be around @xmath69 or @xmath70 . by comparing the peak heights and assuming that the franck  condon factors of vibrational transitions are as small as @xmath71 , it could easily be deduced that the amplitude of electronic coherence should be higher than the vibrational coherence of chl  @xmath2 .",
    "but the dephasing rate of the electronic coherences is known to be much shorter than the vibrational ones@xcite .",
    "this would prevent the electronic coherence to be captured by the fourier maps , except of a few cases .",
    "one of them is the inhomogeneous distribution induced picosecond electronic coherence lifetime , as it was recently shown by dong et al.@xcite . in the inhomogeneously broadened spectrum",
    "the sub - ensemble of molecules , having similar energies provides long - lived coherent signal in the two - color photon echo experiment .",
    "such mechanism could also be significant in the 2d electronic spectroscopy , however , it requires the absorption spectra of chl  @xmath2 and chl  @xmath1 to overlap significantly .",
    "another mechanism allowing for long - lived electronic coherences is substantial electronic  vibrational mixing in the excited state , resulting in a vibrational coherence lifetime borrowing mechanism@xcite . for this effect to be noticeable ,",
    "the excitonic energy gap between the excitonic states should closely match some strong discrete vibrational mode . in our case ,",
    "the proposed excitonic energy gap is close to a very strong vibrational modes of @xmath42 or @xmath70 and in the fourier amplitude maps the ground state vibrational contribution dominates .",
    "therefore , if there are observable signatures of electronic coherence beatings , they are hindered by strong signals of vibrational coherences .      in our previous study of the 2d spectra of the fcp complex at room temperature ,",
    "the ultrafast energy transfer ( occurring on timescale of 60  fs ) from excitonically coupled chl  @xmath2 to chl  @xmath1 was proposed@xcite .",
    "it was obtained by tracing the time dynamics of the spectral feature at @xmath72 , assigned to the @xmath0 transition of chl  @xmath2 . here",
    "we report that there are two peaks at @xmath29 and @xmath30 instead of one .",
    "this doublet was not resolved in the experiment at the room temperature .",
    "moreover , we found significant differences in their decay dynamics .",
    "considering times up to 30 ps , the lower peak decays with the timescale of @xmath73 femtoseconds , while the the shortest temporal dynamics of the upper peak is @xmath74  ps .",
    "the timescales were obtained from temporal traces , taken by averaging over the area of a circle of 100  @xmath18 radius in spectra and omitting the first 30  fs , thus limiting amount spectral diffusion and pulse overlap contributions appearing in peak dynamics .",
    "we can thus conclude that the obtained two different chl  @xmath2 states directly transfer energy to chl  @xmath1 on different timescales .",
    "notice that energy transfer via intermediate states ( presumably from fucoxanthins ) is not consistent with fluorescence ",
    "excitation spectrum of fcp@xcite , which implies 100% efficiency of chl  @xmath2 to chl  @xmath1 energy transfer , and the fact that significant portions of excitation from fx @xmath75 ( internal charge transfer ) state , which could be suggested to be a bridge between chl  @xmath2 and chl  @xmath1 , are lost due to the decay to the ground state@xcite .",
    "recent studies suggest that there are two chl  @xmath2 molecules in the complex@xcite .",
    "also , some of them can be of different types ( i.e. chl  @xmath76 , @xmath77 or @xmath78 ) that have slightly different absorption spectra@xcite . even if the discussed spectral features are caused by the chlorophylls of different types ( thus , causing signals in different frequencies )",
    ", the temporal dynamics of the corresponding peaks indicate that their interaction with the rest of the system or a surrounding environment is different .",
    "the simplest picture is that one chl  @xmath2 is situated in the periphery of the fcp complex and is weakly coupled to the rest of chl  @xmath1 , thus , the excitation transfer to the core pigments is slow and we observe a picosecond decay of the peak at @xmath30 . at the same time , the protein environment causes it to have higher energy .",
    "another chl  @xmath2 , absorbing at @xmath29 , must be coupled to chl  @xmath1 stronger for faster excitation transfer . since the cross - peak between these two transitions as well as",
    "the relevant excited state absorption contribution is absent , chlorophylls @xmath2 in fcp are not coupled .",
    "this implies that they probably are spatially well separated .",
    "however , the ultrafast energy transfer from the lower energy chl  @xmath2 state still remains an issue to be explained .",
    "the strength of coupling between chl  @xmath2 and chl  @xmath1 is not known , although it may be estimated from lhcii , which shares considerable sequence homology@xcite .",
    "couplings between chlorophylls in the lhcii complex were calculated to be less than 100  @xmath18@xcite .",
    "considering this and the fact that the transition dipole moment of the @xmath0 band is smaller for chl  @xmath2 than for chl  @xmath1 , one can be certain that coupling between chl  @xmath2 and chl  @xmath1 in fcp should be even weaker .",
    "this is also supported by the absence of clear excitonic cross - peaks between chl  @xmath1 and chl  @xmath2 states in our 2d spectra .",
    "the frster energy transfer could apply in this range of parameters .",
    "however , it leads to slower picosecond transfer rates .",
    "the 320  fs transfer timescale observed in 2d  es can be understood by including two ingredients in the consideration .",
    "first , the lower energy chl  @xmath2 can be coupled to several chl  @xmath1 molecules , thus , it transfers energy to a few chl  @xmath1 molecules at once .",
    "the rates effectively sum - up and lead to the fast decay of the chl  @xmath2 population .",
    "second , vibrations - assisted energy transfer enhancement might be significant for the chl  @xmath2chl  @xmath1 energy transfer .",
    "the energy gap of @xmath69 is close to the strongest vibrational chl  @xmath1 mode of @xmath42 , thus allowing for electronic ",
    "vibrational resonance@xcite .",
    "recently , specific vibrational modes were suggested to speed up the initial charge transfer step in the photosystem ii ( ps ii ) reaction center@xcite .",
    "finally , this does not contradict our previous suggestion that chl  @xmath2 is coherently coupled to chl  @xmath1@xcite , however , the coherent mechanism may be far more complicated and calls for future studies .",
    "we propose a schematic spatial arrangement of chl  @xmath1 and chl  @xmath2 molecules ( shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : schematic - illustration - of ] ) .",
    "this functional scheme is comparable to the cp29 photosynthetic antenna of photosystem ii@xcite .",
    "the structure of the cp29 complex is similar to the light harvesting complex lhcii , which shares the sequence homology with fcp . in cp29",
    "there are eight chl @xmath1 and four chl @xmath3 ( the absorption maximum of chl  @xmath3 is around @xmath79 , similarly as to chl  @xmath2 ) and one more chlorophyll binding site can be occupied by either type of chlorophyll@xcite , although previously it was assumed that there are 8 chl  @xmath1 and 2 chl  @xmath3 molecules@xcite .",
    "however , in both models one chlorophyll @xmath3 molecule is well spatially separated from the other which is strongly coupled to the rest of chlorophylls @xmath1 of the complex .",
    "consequentially , two absorption bands at @xmath80 and @xmath81 are observed in the absorption and in the pump  probe spectrum have completely different temporal dynamics : the energy transfer from chl  @xmath3 at higher energy is transferred to chl  @xmath1 with the rate of 350  fs , while transfer from the lower energy chl  @xmath3 band occurs in 2.2  ps@xcite .",
    "this implies that having two accessory chlorophylls that are in different spatial situations might be a property shared by a number of light - harvesting complexes , thus probably it has a functional significance .",
    "proposed functional scheme of spatial arrangement of chlorophyll @xmath2 and @xmath1 molecules in the fcp complex .",
    "couplings between pigments are shown by solid lines .",
    "dashed lines indicate weaker coupling between spatially separated chl  @xmath2 absorbing at @xmath82 .",
    "chl  @xmath1 molecules shown here do not represent their actual number in fcp . ]    in a recent study of fcp based on resonance raman technique@xcite , signatures of two distinct chl  @xmath2 molecules were observed . in that",
    "study a possible pigment organization scheme in fcp was discussed , based on the pigment binding sites of the lhcii from plants@xcite .",
    "it was suggested that one of the chl  @xmath2 should be bound at either the site of a614 ( which is preserved in fcp ) or a613 ( not preserved in fcp ) , while the other chl  @xmath2 should be bound at the site of b609 ( preserved ) or a604 ( not preserved ) .",
    "for the faster transferring chl  @xmath2 the site of b609 would be a logical choice , as it is in the vicinity of several pigments .",
    "meanwhile , the higher energy ( 15810  @xmath18 ) chl  @xmath2 could indeed be situated at the site of a614 , as that site is relatively isolated and would be in accord with slower energy transfer from this pigment . since this pigment is situated at the periphery of the complex , it might be responsible for the inter - complex chl  @xmath2 to chl  @xmath1 transfer in the fcp  psii supercomplexes@xcite .",
    "in this work we studied low - temperature and high - resolution experimental two - dimensional spectra of fcp complex .",
    "short time ( femtosecond ) dynamics of the spectra show complex oscillation patterns .",
    "they are dominated by vibrational and vibronic coherences of chl  @xmath1 and fucoxanthin ; electronic coherences could not be identified due to their short lifetime and being hindered under high - amplitude oscillations originating from chl  @xmath1 .",
    "most notably , we have resolved two distinct states , that can be assigned to chlorophylls @xmath2 .",
    "these states were not found in the previous studies of fcp and their energies were not known . the two chl  @xmath2 molecules transfer energy to chl  @xmath1 with rates that differ by about an order of magnitude .",
    "we suggest that the lower energy chl  @xmath2 molecule is situated in the core of the complex and is coupled to an aggregated pool of chl  @xmath1 molecules and the chl  @xmath2-to-@xmath1 energy transfer might be vibronically - enhanced .",
    "the higher energy chl  @xmath2 should be in the periphery of the complex to transfer energy on the picosecond timescale .",
