    "until now , a general theoretical framework for quantum phases and phase transitions of strongly correlated electron systems , such as cuprate and other oxides , has not been established yet . as an alternative approach ,",
    "ads / cft correspondence  @xcite is a powerful tool to attack these strongly correlated problems and to get some possible clues on the basic principle behind these numerous correlated electron systems .    indeed , some exotic states of matter , including fermi liquid , non - fermi liquid , mott phase and pseudo - gap phase , have been found or identified by ads / cft correspondence @xcite . by adding a probe fermion on rn - ads background ,",
    "a non - linear dispersion relation is observed  @xcite , indicating that a non - fermi liquid phase emerges .",
    "also , it is found that the low energy behavior of a fermionic system on the rn - ads background is controlled by the @xmath1 near horizon geometry  @xcite .",
    "later , the properties of a fermionic system on gauss - bonnet , lifshitz as well as hyperscaling violation geometry have been extensively studied @xcite .",
    "furthermore , a dipole coupling between the gauge field and the dirac field can be introduced to model the mott phase  @xcite .",
    "many extended works on the dipole coupling effects have been explored in more general geometries in @xcite .",
    "recently , in terms of the  pole - zero mechanism \" , a pseudo - gap phase has been detected in a holographic fermionic system with dipole coupling in rn - ads black hole and the schwarzschild - ads black hole  @xcite .",
    "moreover , they observed a remarkable duality between zeroes and poles in this holographic system  @xcite , which should be interesting for experimental scientists in condensed matter physics , although this phenomenon has not been captured by experiments yet . in this paper , we shall address the pseudo - gap phase and the duality in a holographic fermionic system with dipole coupling on q - lattice geometry .",
    "motivated by the idea of q - balls @xcite , a q - lattice model in a holographic framework was first constructed in @xcite , in which the translational symmetry was broken and a metal - insulator transition observed through the study of optical conductivity . a lot of relevant work has been investigated in this context @xcite . in  @xcite , we study a holographic fermionic system with dipole coupling on q - lattice geometry and find that a mott gap opens when the dipole coupling parameter @xmath0 is beyond a certain critical value @xmath2 .",
    "an interesting result is that the mott gap opens much more easily when the q - lattice background is dual to a deep insulating phase rather than a metallic phase . here",
    ", we shall probe the pseudo - gap phase in this system by the  pole - zero mechanism \" and study how the lattice parameters affect the formation of the pseudo - gap .",
    "our paper is organized as follows . in section [ qd ] , a brief review of the holographic q - lattice geometry and the dirac equation",
    "is presented .",
    "our main results on the classification of quantum phases of holographic fermionic system with dipole coupling are presented for isotropic and anisotropic q - lattice geometry in section [ iql ] and section [ aiql ] , respectively .",
    "specifically , we will focus on the pseudo - gap phase and discuss how the lattice parameters affect its formation .",
    "finally , the conclusion and discussion are presented in section [ conclusion ] .",
    "in this section , we give a brief introduction on the holographic q - lattice model which breaks translational symmetry in both spatial directions and then demonstrate how to simplify the dirac equation over a specific q - lattice background . for detailed discussion",
    ", we refer to @xcite .",
    "the action with q - lattice structure in both of the spatial directions can be written as @xmath3,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath4 .",
    "@xmath5 and @xmath6 are the complex scalar fields simulating the lattices . from the above action",
    ", the equations of motion can be deduced as @xmath7 to find solutions to the above equations of motion , we take the following ansatz @xmath8 with @xmath9 where @xmath10 and @xmath11 are two wave - numbers along @xmath12 and @xmath13 directions , respectively , such that the @xmath14 is periodic in @xmath15 direction with lattice constant @xmath16 . in addition , in this paper , we will set @xmath17 for definiteness , which avoids the violation of the @xmath1 bf bound near the horizon .",
    "based on the above ansatz , we obtain five second order odes for @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 and one first order ode for @xmath23 . to solve the odes numerically ,",
    "we impose a regular boundary condition at the horizon @xmath24 and impose the following conditions on the conformal boundary : @xmath25 we will only focus on the standard quantisation of the scalar field where the asymptotic behavior of @xmath26 is described as @xmath27 , with the uv behavior corresponding to q - lattice deformation with lattice amplitude @xmath28 , where @xmath29 , is the scaling dimension of the dual field of @xmath14 .",
    "in addition , the hawking temperature of the black hole is given by @xmath30 as a result , each of our q - lattice solutions can be specified by five dimensionless quantities @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "we shall abbreviate these quantities to @xmath36 respectively in what follows for simpleness .",
    "now , we introduce the dirac equation with dipole coupling on this q - lattice geometry .",
    "we consider the following action , which involves the interaction between the spinor field and the gauge field @xmath37 in the above action , @xmath38 and @xmath39 , where @xmath40 form a set of orthogonal normal vector bases and @xmath41 is the spin connection 1-forms . with the redefinition @xmath42 , and by denoting the fourier transform of @xmath43 as @xmath44 with @xmath45 , and choosing the following gamma matrices , @xmath46 the dirac equation deduced from eq.([actionspinor ] )",
    "can be written in a simple form as @xmath47 @xmath48 to solve the dirac equation , we need to impose the following independent ingoing boundary condition at the horizon @xmath49 the near boundary behavior of the dirac field will be @xmath50 finally , we can read off the retarded green function by holography @xmath51 to obtain the boundary green function , we need to construct a basis of finite solutions , @xmath52 and @xmath53 due to the four components of the dirac fields being coupled to one another .",
    "there is competition between the poles ( @xmath54 ) and zeros ( @xmath55 ) in the green function of a strongly coupled fermionic system in condensed matter physics . by the  pole - zero mechanism \"",
    ", we can classify the different phases of a strongly coupled fermionic system  @xcite .",
    "the criterion of the phase classification is given as below .",
    "@xmath56 in a holographic framework , this  pole - zero mechanism \" was first introduced in @xcite to characterize different phases . here",
    ", we will use this mechanism to probe the pseudo - gap phase in the holographic fermionic system with dipole coupling on q - lattice geometry .",
    "we explore the case of an isotropic q - lattice in this section , i.e. , @xmath57 and @xmath58 , in which we can set @xmath59 without loss of generality .",
    "the case of anisotropic q - lattice geometry will be discussed in the next section .    for definiteness , we fix @xmath60 as well as @xmath61 and work at an extremely low temperature @xmath62 throughout this paper .",
    "firstly , for @xmath63 , neither poles nor zeros can be observed in the determinant of the green function @xmath64 because the poles ( zeros ) of green function are cancelled ( fig .",
    "however , once the dipole coupling is turned on , the poles or zeros emerge in @xmath64 so that we can classify the phases for the fermionic system with dipole coupling in terms of the  pole - zero mechanism \" .",
    "[ p4p5 ] shows the determinant of the green function @xmath64 as a function of @xmath65 at @xmath66 for @xmath67 ( fig .",
    "[ p0:a ] ) and @xmath68 ( fig .",
    "[ p0:b ] ) with @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",
    "one pole emerges at @xmath71 for @xmath67 , indicating a ( non-)fermi liquid state , and a zero can be found at the same momentum @xmath72 for @xmath68 , indicating a mott state .",
    "obviously , there is a duality between zero and pole under @xmath73 , which was first revealed in @xcite .",
    "when we decrease the dipole coupling to @xmath74 , we find the coexistence of pole and zero in @xmath75 ( fig .",
    "[ p0p1 ] ) , which points to a pseudo - gap phase .",
    "again , the duality between zeros and poles remains under @xmath73 ( fig .",
    "[ p0p1 ] ) . according to the above observations , we claim that the ( non-)fermi liquid phase , mott phase and the pseudo - gap phase emerge in a fermionic system with dipole coupling on the q - lattice . by the density of state ( dos ) @xmath76 , we can determine the critical point @xmath2 of the transition from ( non-)fermi liquid phase to mott phase and find that the mott gap opens more easily in a deep insulating phase than a metallic phase @xcite .",
    "now , we shall focus on the effect of lattice constant @xmath77 and lattice amplitude @xmath28 on the pseudo - gap phase . by careful numerical calculation",
    ", we find that a pseudo - gap emerges when @xmath78 for @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",
    "when we go to a deep insulating phase with @xmath79 and @xmath80 , the pseudo - gap phase emerges in the region of @xmath81 .",
    "therefore , the region of the pseudo - gap phase in @xmath0 space is suppressed in the deep insulating phase . for comparison",
    ", we also find that the pseudo - gap phase appears when @xmath82 in the rn - ads black hole background , which is obtained simply by setting @xmath83 . here , which is different from the conventions in @xcite that @xmath84 , the charge @xmath85 and dipole coupling @xmath0 will correspond to @xmath86 and @xmath87 in @xcite due to the products @xmath88 and @xmath89 being the relevant quantities . ]    before closing this section , we would like to present a brief discussion on the duality between zeros and poles .",
    "when @xmath90 is set to zero , we can package the dirac equations ( [ diraceab1 ] ) and ( [ diraceab2 ] ) into the following evolution equations @xmath91 + \\left [ v_{+ } - ( -1)^{\\alpha } k \\sqrt{\\frac{g_{zz}}{g_{xx } } }   \\right]\\xi_{\\alpha}^{2 } = 0 ~,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we have defined @xmath92 and @xmath93 . for massless fermions ,",
    "the retarder green function is @xmath94 therefore , from the evolution equation ( [ diracef1 ] ) , one can easily find the following symmetry of green s function @xmath95 in addition , we can introduce the reciprocal of @xmath96 , @xmath97 we find that @xmath98 satisfies the following evolution equations @xmath99 + \\left [ \\slashed{v}_{+ } - ( -1)^{\\alpha } k \\sqrt{\\frac{g_{zz}}{g_{xx } } }   \\right]\\slashed{\\xi}_{\\alpha}^{2 } = 0 ~,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath100 .",
    "it is easily found that there is a symmetry between eqs .",
    "( [ diracef1 ] ) and ( [ diracef2 ] ) under the transformation @xmath101 , @xmath73 and @xmath102 .",
    "combining eq .",
    "( [ sym1 ] ) , we can easily find that there is a duality between zeros and poles when @xmath73 .",
    "now we turn to study the pseudo - gap phase and the duality between the zeros and poles on anisotropic q - lattices , in which we set @xmath103 , @xmath104 and @xmath70 .",
    "firstly , we explore the duality along the @xmath65 direction ( setting @xmath59 ) . as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ kxp6 ] and fig .",
    "[ kxp0p1 ] , we find that the ( non-)fermi liquid phase , mott insulating phase and the pseudo - gap phase along the @xmath65 direction emerge , depending on the values of the dipole coupling parameter @xmath0 . furthermore , the duality between zeros and poles still holds , which can also be understood by a similar analysis to the last section . in a parallel manner , we also work out the location of poles and zeros in @xmath64 along the @xmath90 direction ( setting @xmath105 ) for @xmath106 and @xmath107 .",
    "we find that @xmath108 for @xmath107 and @xmath109 for @xmath106 , which indicates that the duality remains valid in the @xmath13 direction .",
    "but obviously we notice that @xmath110 ( @xmath111 ) , reflecting the anisotropy of the system .",
    "we now study the pseudo - gap phase .",
    "we find that the pseudo - gap phase emerges along the @xmath65 direction for @xmath112 , while along the @xmath90 direction for @xmath113 . obviously , the anisotropic geometry results in the anisotropic pseudo - gap phase region . along the insulating direction ( @xmath65 direction ) , the region of pseudo - gap phase is suppressed , which is consistent with that explored on isotropic q - lattices in the previous section .",
    "by the  pole - zero mechanism \" we have classified the phases which appear in a holographic fermionic system with dipole coupling on q - lattice geometry .",
    "these phases could be fermi liquid , non - fermi liquid , mott phase or pseudo - gap phase , depending on the strength of the dipole coupling . therefore ,",
    "varying the dipole coupling parameter @xmath0 can induce quantum phase transitions in our holographic system . by investigating the spectral function , we can work out the critical value @xmath2 of the phase transition from ( non-)fermi liquid to mott phase and see how the lattice parameters @xmath28 and @xmath77 affect the formation of the mott phase in @xcite . here , we have further computed the determinant of the retarded green function and focused on the formation of the pseudo - gap phase .",
    "we find that the region of the pseudo - gap phase is suppressed in the deep insulating phase .",
    "for the anisotropic q - lattice geometry , we have obtained an anisotropic pseudo - gap phase region which is also suppressed along the insulating direction .",
    "another interesting result is that the duality between zeros and poles previously found in @xcite still holds in either isotropic or anisotropic q - lattice geometry and is independent of the lattice parameters .",
