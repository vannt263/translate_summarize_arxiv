    "the light cone wave function of the pion , @xmath0 is the probability amplitude of finding a parton of a pion ( moving with momentum @xmath1 in a light cone frame ) with parallel momentum equal to @xmath2 and transverse momentum less than @xmath3 .",
    "this wave function incorporates non - perturbative physics and plays an important role in exclusive hard scattering processes and in non - leptonic decays of heavy mesons .",
    "one example of application is the electromagnetic form factor of the pion , @xmath4 , defined by @xmath5 this form factor can , in fact , be written in terms of @xmath6 and @xmath7 ( the perturbative scattering amplitude for the constituents ) as @xmath8    more formally the light cone wave function can be defined as  @xcite@xcite @xmath9 where f.t .",
    "indicates a fourier transform on @xmath10 and @xmath11 assuming    * the sum of the parallel components of the momenta of the two partons is equal to the total pion momentum @xmath1 . *",
    "the transverse components have been integrated out up to momentum @xmath3 .",
    "the @xmath12-th moment of @xmath6 is defined as @xmath13    in a typical lattice determination of such quantity the cut - off is provided by the lattice spacing , @xmath14 .",
    "we finally wish to remark that @xmath15 is fixed by a normalization condition and @xmath16 because the wavefunction is symmetric under g - parity .",
    "therefore @xmath17 is the first non trivial moment of @xmath6 .",
    "this second moment can be related to @xmath18 where the ellipsis indicates divergent terms , @xmath19 and @xmath20",
    "our computation was carried on 154 quenched gauge configurations generated by the ukqcd collaboration using the wilson gauge action .",
    "we use the clover @xmath21 improved action for the light quarks .",
    "the parameters of our computation are :    * volume equal to @xmath22 . * @xmath23 which corresponds to an inverse lattice spacing of @xmath24gev .",
    "* @xmath25 values 0.13460 , 0.13510 , 0.13530 ( corresponding to pseudoscalar masses of 748 , 574 and 490mev respectively ) * @xmath26 and @xmath27=1.61    for technical reasons we choose not to improve the operators and do not smear the light quarks . the latter choice is motivated by the fact that the local axial current seems to have better superposition with the pion than other smeared operators we tried .    in order to calculate any moment of the pion light - cone wavefunction",
    ", we are required to study the matrix elements of lowest twist local operators between pion and vacuum . in a continuum world",
    "these operators are classified by their representation under the group of lorentz , parity and charge conjugation . in the lattice - discretized world",
    "the lorentz group is broken to @xmath28 , the hypercubic group .",
    "hence lowest twist local operators can mix with higher dimensional operators and introduce power divergences .",
    "we choose a particular combination of the lattice operators that :    * transforms under an irreducible representation of the hypercubic group * does not mix with higher dimensional operators .",

    "( [ r1 ] ) reduces to @xmath43 the desired second moment ( without divergences ) times a corrective matching factor to be determined perturbatively .",
    "a big part of this work was the determination of the matching factor @xmath44 for @xmath45 .",
    "the computation was performed assuming a gluon mass as regulator and on - shell external quarks with non - zero momentum .",
    "all 41 relevant diagrams were expanded in taylor up to second order in @xmath1 , compatibly with eq .",
    "( [ r1 ] ) .    as result of our computation",
    "we find that @xmath46 and the coefficients are evaluated at @xmath47 for @xmath48 .",
    "we tried varying @xmath49 by factors of two and this gives us an estimate of the error in the matching of the order of 10% that we include in our final result .",
    "the result of our calculation is @xmath50 ( the first error is statistical and the second is systematic due to matching , quenching error is not included ) .",
    "these numbers should be compared with results from sum rules @xmath51 with preceding independent lattice results @xmath52 and the exact asymptotic value @xmath53 ( confirmed by the fermilab experiment e791 , performed at @xmath54gev ) .",
    "we find that our value for the second moment is smaller than sum rule predictions and is closer to the asymptotic value .    on the one side we conclude that the present computation has better control of statistical and perturbative errors than previous computations . on the other side",
    "we strongly feel that dynamical quarks may be playing an important role in this process and quenching errors are yet to be estimated and removed .",
    "we also believe that the same analysis should be repeated for different values of the lattice spacing in order to study the @xmath55 dependence of @xmath17 .",
    "we all wish to thank ukqcd for making the gauge configurations available to us and for giving us access to the cray t3e ( where part of the computation was performed ) .",
