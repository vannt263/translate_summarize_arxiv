    "is the resolution of a longstanding problem in black hole physics : the statistical origin of the bekenstein - hawking entropy at least for certain extreme and near - extreme black holes @xcite .",
    "the resolution of this problem has been made possible by the realization of polchinski @xcite that d - branes , i.e. branes carrying ramond - ramond charge , are extended objects with the property that open strings can end on them .",
    "the d - brane excitations are described by such open strings .",
    "the microscopic origin of the black hole entropy arises in d - brane physics in two steps : firstly , we identify a certain classical supersymmetric black hole carrying charge in the @xmath0 sector with a corresponding excited d - brane configuration ; secondly , we count the number of open string states that reproduce the excited d - brane system .",
    "the worldvolume bosonic field content that describes the low energy excitations of a d-@xmath1-brane is given by @xmath2 scalar fields @xmath3 ( @xmath4 ) and by a 1-form gauge potential @xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) @xcite .",
    "these fields are interchanged by @xmath7-duality transformations .",
    "the scalar fields are associated to the massless excitations of the brane that describe transverse displacements , and the gauge field is associated to worldvolume massless excitations on the brane . through this paper",
    "we will be interested in non - threshold d - brane bound states .",
    "these configurations arise whenever the worldvolume gauge field associated with a d-@xmath1-brane forms a condensate .",
    "if this is the case the d-@xmath1-brane may carry the @xmath8 charge that is usually associated with lower dimensional d - branes .",
    "in fact , the d-@xmath1-brane effective action contains the correct coupling terms to @xmath0 gauge potentials with rank lower than @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "remarkably , the existence of these generalised wess - zumino terms ( and for the d-9-brane the anomalous bianchi identity and the g - s coupling ) is a consequence of @xmath7-duality and lorentz invariance @xcite .    to be definite consider the @xmath10 d - brane bound state .",
    "this configuration may be obtained by performing a @xmath7-duality at an angle on a d-@xmath11-brane , i.e. p-1 : & x^1, ...",
    ",x^p-1 + & ^p =  x^p-1 & & p : & x^1, ... ,x^p + & a_p =  x^p-1 [ 1.1 ] where we start with a d-@xmath11-brane parallel to the @xmath12-directions and making an angle @xmath13 with the @xmath14-direction in the @xmath15 2-torus .",
    "the @xmath7-duality transformation along the @xmath16-direction interchanges the scalar field @xmath17 with the gauge field @xmath18 forming a magnetic condensate ( through this paper we shall scale the gauge potential as @xmath19 ) .",
    "from the supergravity theory perspective the existence of these bound states has been deduce in @xcite .    in the linear approximation the field theory describing the low - lying states on the d - brane bound state in ( [ 1.1 ] ) is the super yang mills theory with @xmath20 gauge group @xcite .",
    "the integer @xmath21 is the d-@xmath1-brane winding number in the @xmath14-direction .",
    "the brane carries a @xmath22 flux which induces a thooft twist in the @xmath23 part of the theory @xcite . as a consequence",
    "the gauge potential and the scalar fields will obey twisted boundary conditions . for an appropriate choice of this @xmath20 bundle multiple transition functions the only non - vanishing gauge potential is in the @xmath22 center of the group and it is given by ( [ 1.1 ] ) .",
    "had we considered @xmath24 d - branes on top of each other , the scalar and gauge fields would become @xmath25 matrices and equation ( [ 1.1 ] ) would still refer to the @xmath22 center of the group .",
    "the aim of this paper is to study the d - brane entropy counting when the d - brane system has non - vanishing worldvolume gauge fields .",
    "in particular , we will be considering a d - brane configuration presented in @xcite interpreted as the intersection of @xmath26 and @xmath27 d-@xmath28-branes with non - vanishing worldvolume gauge fields and carrying momentum along a common direction .",
    "although this configuration is @xmath7-dual to the configuration used by callan and maldacena @xcite , the origin of the statistical entropy has a remarkable new feature .",
    "namely , we have to take into account the landau degeneracy of the open string sector corresponding to open strings with each end on different branes .",
    "we begin in section two by presenting our d - brane configuration and by considering the corresponding charges quantisation .",
    "we shall then present the supergravity solution describing our d - brane system and write the integer valued form of the bekenstein - hawking entropy .",
    "the supergravity solution corresponding to the non - extreme configuration will also be presented and the corresponding thermodynamical formulae in terms of a brane / anti - brane system will be written . in section three",
    "we shall consider open strings with ends on different d - branes which have a magnetic condensate on its worldvolume theory .",
    "we will keep our discussion general and specify for our d - brane system in section four , where we shall give the d - brane entropy counting .",
    "we will also consider the near - extreme black hole solution , matching the corresponding thermodynamical quantities with the brane / anti - brane system .",
    "we shall give our conclusions in section five .",
    "let us start by considering the @xmath29 d - brane configuration .",
    "we place @xmath26 d-@xmath30-branes along the @xmath31-directions and @xmath27 d-@xmath30-branes along the @xmath32-directions .",
    "these directions are taken to be circles of radius @xmath33 .",
    "next , we rotate this configuration in the @xmath34 @xmath35-torus by an angle @xmath13 as described in figure [ torus ] .",
    "the resulting d - brane system may be represented by    3_1:&x^1,x^2,x^5 , + & ^4_(1)=-  x^5  , + 3_2:&x^1,x^3,x^5 , + & ^4_(2)=  x^5  , [ 2.1 ] where as explained in the introduction we are considering the @xmath22 center of the worldvolume scalar fields associated with each group of d-@xmath30-branes . wrapping a direction of the d-@xmath30-branes around a cycle of the @xmath34 @xmath35-torus yields quantisation conditions on the rotation angle @xmath13 . start by considering the first d-@xmath30-branes .",
    "if the corresponding winding number in the @xmath36-direction is @xmath37 , and in the @xmath38-direction is @xmath39 , the angle @xmath13 will obey the quantisation condition =  , [ 2.2 ] where @xmath40 and @xmath39 are co - prime . similarly , if the other d-@xmath30-branes are wrapped on the @xmath41-cycle the quantisation condition on the angle @xmath13 is =  .",
    "[ 2.3 ] thus , the moduli @xmath42 and @xmath43 are not independent but obey the relation ( ) ^2=  . [ 2.4 ]    the mass formula for @xmath24 d-@xmath1-branes wrapped on a @xmath1-torus is given by @xcite m_p = n  , [ 2.5 ] where @xmath44 is the string coupling constant , @xmath45 is the inverse string tension and @xmath33 is the radius of the circle along which the d - branes are wrapped with winding number @xmath46 .",
    "it is straightforward to generalise this formula for the case where a given direction of the d - branes wraps around a @xmath35-torus . for the configuration described by ( [ 2.1 ] ) we have m_3_1=n_1  , +   + m_3_2=n_2  .",
    "[ 2.6 ]    we proceed by performing a @xmath7-duality transformation along the @xmath36-direction on the configuration ( [ 2.1 ] ) .",

    "they arise by performing a @xmath7-duality transformation along the @xmath36-direction on @xmath26 d-@xmath30-branes that were wrapped on the @xmath38-direction with winding number @xmath39 .",
    "therefore we end up with @xmath26 d-@xmath28-branes with winding @xmath39 in the @xmath38-direction .",
    "also , we have seen that the d-@xmath30-branes were wrapped on the dualised direction with winding @xmath37 .",
    "therefore the d-@xmath28-branes will also carry d-@xmath35-brane charge .",
    "they carry @xmath47 units of such charge . in the language of @xcite , the d-@xmath35-branes dissolve in the d-@xmath28-branes leaving flux .",
    "this fact is described by the magnetic field condensate @xmath48 .",
    "similar comments apply to the second group of d-@xmath28-branes .",
    "the resulting intersecting d-@xmath28-brane system does not obey the standard intersecting rules , but supersymmetry of this configuration is guaranteed by the presence of non - vanishing worldvolume gauge fields @xcite .    in the dual theory the quantisation conditions on the rotation angle @xmath13",
    "translate into quantisation conditions on the flux carried by the worldvolume gauge field strengths @xmath48 and @xmath49 . in terms of the dual radius @xmath50 and dual string coupling @xmath51",
    "these read as & & f_45^(1)==  , + [ 2.8 ] + & & f_45^(2)=-= -  .",
    "similarly , the mass of the d-@xmath28-branes is now given by m_4_1=n_1 = p_1n_1  , + [ 2.9 ] + m_4_2=n_2 = p_2n_2  .",
    "the factor @xmath52 multiplying the usual d-@xmath28-brane mass formula is due to the presence of the magnetic field condensate .",
    "as it will be explained in the subsection 3.4 , this term also arises in the vacuum amplitude calculation for a system of two parallel d - branes with such fields .",
    "finally , we remark that all constituent d - branes in the configuration ( [ 2.7 ] ) , including the d-@xmath35-branes that are dissolved in the d-@xmath28-branes , have a common @xmath53-direction . as a consequence",
    ", the d - branes may carry momentum along this direction while leaving some unbroken supersymmetry .",
    "if we introduce @xmath24 units of ( left - moving ) momentum , the compactified system will have an extra mass term given by p = m_p=  . [ 2.10 ]      the d - brane system presented above has a corresponding supergravity solution .",
    "this solution may be found by applying @xmath7-duality at an angle on the @xmath29 d - brane solution or by using the @xmath54 symmetry of @xmath55 , @xmath56 supergravity @xcite .",

    "we want to express the macroscopic entropy formula ( [ 2.14 ] ) in terms of the quantities describing the d - brane system ( [ 2.7 ] ) .",
