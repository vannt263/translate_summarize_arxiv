    "the study of embedded galactic clusters is fundamental in tracing the galactic spiral structure and improve our understanding of the star formation process .",
    "our group has investigated several galactic plane regions in the fourth quadrant line of sights ( see vzquez et al .",
    "2005 , carraro & costa 2009 ) , and in this paper we further extend this study to a region located at @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "this region contains very interesting objects ; being an important cloud which obscure two compact young open clusters ( danks  1 and danks  2 ) , a wr star ( wr  48a ) , and at least three embedded clusters ( dbs2003  130 , 131 and 132 ) so far detected only in the infrared ( dutra et al .",
    "there are also several hii regions and oh / h@xmath6o maser sources ( see danks et al . 1984 or clark & porter 2004 for a detailed description ) .",
    "the open clusters danks  1 and danks  2 were first detected by danks et al .",
    "( 1983 ) and their parameters were only recently estimated by bica et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , using @xmath7 and @xmath8 photometry . in this regards , we show that complementing the optical and infrared data with @xmath9 observations adds valuable information that allow a better determination of the interstellar absorption in this line of sight . as for the embedded clusters , it is important to note that only dbs2003  131 has been extnsively studied in the infrared ( leistra et al .",
    "2005 and longmore et al .",
    "2007 ) , and that none of 3 clusters has been studied in the optical .    in the present paper",
    "we perform a detailed wide field study at @xmath10 using all @xmath11 and @xmath8 , of all the aforementioned objects , and derive updated estimates of their fundamental parameters .",
    "we then analyze this field with respect to other fields in the fourth galactic quadrant to derive information about the galactic spiral structure of this portion of the disk .",
    "the layout of the paper is as follows . in sect .",
    "[ sec : data ] we describe the used data , and the reduction and calibration procedures . in sect .",
    "[ sec : analysis ] we present the analysis of the data together with the main clusters parameters . finally , in sects .",
    "[ sec : discussion ] and [ sec : conclusions ] we discuss and summarize our results .",
    "@xmath0 images of the region under study ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : dss ] ) were acquired using the y4kcam camera attached to the 1.0 m telescope , which is operated by the smarts consortium and placed at cerro tololo inter - american observatory ( ctio ) .",
    "this camera is equipped with an sta @xmath12 ccd with @xmath13 pixels .",
    "this set - up provides direct imaging over a field of view ( fov ) @xmath14 with a scale of @xmath15/pix .",
    "the relatively large fov allowed us to include several objects present in the region and also to have an important sample of the adjacent stellar field in this part of the galactic plane .",
    "the ccd was operated without binning , at a nominal gain and read out noise of 1.44 e-/adu and 7 e- per quadrant ( this detector is read by means of four different amplifiers ) .",
    "other detector characteristics can be found at http://www.astronomy.ohio-state.edu/y4kcam/detector.html .",
    "details on the observations are given in table  [ tab : frames ] .",
    "typical fwhm of the data was about @xmath16 and airmasses values during the observation of the scientific frames ranged 1.19 - 1.22 .",

    "all frames were pre - processed in a standard way using the iraf package ccdred . to this aim",
    ", zero exposures and sky flats were taken every night . in order to achieve deep photometry , all the long exposures within each band",
    "were combined using imcombine task .",
    "this procedure helps to remove cosmic rays and improve the signal - to - noise ratio of the faintest stars .",
    "in particular , five images were combined in @xmath9 band , allowing us to reach the @xmath22 index for the brightest stars of danks  1 and danks  2 .",
    "however it was not enough for the case of embedded clusters , were only data in @xmath7 bands could be obtained .",
    "photometry was then performed using iraf daophot and photcal packages .",
    "instrumental magnitudes were obtained using the point spread function ( psf ) method ( stetson 1987 ) . since the fov is large , a quadratic spatially variable psf was adopted and its calibration on each image was done using several isolated , spatially well distributed , bright stars ( about 25 ) across the field .",
    "the psf photometry was finally aperture - corrected for each filter and exposure time .",
    "aperture corrections were computed performing aperture photometry of a suitable number ( about 20 ) of bright stars in the field . in order to obtain a more complete sample of the stars in the observed region ,",
    "an additional photometry table was generated using as input the coordinates ( converted to pixels ) of all the stars that according to the 2mass catalogue must be present in our fov .",
    "finally , all data from different filters and exposures were combined and calibrated using daomaster ( stetson 1992 ) .",
    "standard star selected areas ( see table  [ tab : frames ] ) from the catalog of landolt ( 1992 ) were used to determine the transformation equations relating our instrumental magnitudes to the standard @xmath0 system .",
    "the selection of the fields was done in order to provide a wide range in colors .",
    "then , aperture photometry was carried out for all the standard stars ( @xmath23 per night ) using the iraf photcal package .",
    "to tie our observations to the standard system , we use transformation equations of the form : +    [ cols=\"<,<,^ \" , ]     for a deeper understanding of these diagrams , and in particular that of the parallel red sequence , we make a comparison between the observed diagrams and that of the expected galactic contribution along this line of sight .",
    "the later is estimated by making use of the robin et al .",
    "( 2003 ) galactic model which provides synthetic cmds at any given galactic coordinates .",
    "these synthetic diagrams have been successfully used ( e.g. momany et al .",
    "2004 , 2006 ) to explain the presence of other seemingly anomalous features around galactic open clusters .",
    "figure  [ fig : field - cmds ] ( see the colored version ) compares the observed @xmath18 vs. @xmath24 cmd with the expected galactic contribution along the ( @xmath25,@xmath26 ) = ( @xmath27,@xmath28 ) line of sight according to the besanon simulation . in the middle panel of the right plot ( of fig .",
    "[ fig : field - cmds ] ) we first disentangle between the stellar populations belonging to the three simulated galactic main components ( thin and thick disks plus halo ) in this direction .",
    "clearly , the simulation shows that we expect little , if any , halo contribution , and that most of the galactic contribution is due to thin disk populations .",
    "the true nature of the red and oblique sequence is best explained in the right panel of the plot . indeed",
    ", when analyzing the distance distribution of the thin disk populations , the location of the red oblique sequence is re - constructed as the projection of red clump stars and bright giants at different distances .    additionally , the use of the schmidt - kaler zams ( 1982 ) indicates that the brighter part of the blue sequence ( black symbols in left panel of fig  [ fig : field - cmds ] ) is associated with a nearby group of stars with @xmath29 and a distance modulus @xmath30 , corresponding to about 350 - 750 pc .",
    "previous investigations by our group ( vzquez et al . 2005",
    "; carraro & costa 2009 ) presented optical observations near the field addressed in this paper .",
    "the multiple young and blue populations along the line of view was found to reveal reveal three different spiral features at increasing distance from the sun ..    in this paper , we strengthen this conclusion and lend further support to the presence of at least three populations in this galactic sector : ( i ) the first is a spatially spread foreground population placed mainly between 350 - 750 pc ; ( ii ) the second is situated just behind a very dark cloud at 1 - 3 kpc and is represented by the clusters danks  1/2 ; ( iii ) and , finally , a third population which is traced by the embedded clusters , located at about 5 - 7 kpc .",
    "the results are illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : arms ] where the valle ( 2005 ) spiral arms model is also shown as dotted curves . in this plot",
    "we summarized the recent findings of carraro & costa ( 2009 ) , vzquez et al .",
    "( 2005 ) and the present study .",
    "the various the segments indicate the location and corresponding uncertainties of the different populations detected along the @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 line of sight .",
    "we confirmed the early findings by vzquez et al .",
    "( 2005 ) that the populations beyond the open cluster stock  16 ( their groups * a * and * b * ) are most probably associated to scutum - crux .",
    "the same association could tentatively be done for the embedded clusters studied in this paper .",
    "the danks  1/2 clusters , on the other hand , clearly belong to the carina branch of the carina - sagittarius arm , like stock  16 and the population * a * described in carraro & costa ( 2009 ) . in this scenario it appears however that the scutum - crux arm as traced by valle should have a larger pitch angle than 11@xmath34 . in fact",
    "his plots indicate this parameter has a @xmath35 .",
    "however , some alternative scenarios are viable : ( i ) the observed displacement from the model can be accounted for by the natural width of 1 kpc for spiral arms ( see valle 2005 ) , or ( ii ) the two most distant groups falling in between scutum - crux and carina are tracing an inter - arm structure , or a branch of carina .",
    "this later possibility finds some support from the existence of several hii regions at the same position of these two groups ( russeil 2003 ; paladini 2004 ; see also fig .",
    "[ fig : arms ] ) .    more directions close in this regions have to be studied .",
    "for example , more deeper , detailed and complementary analysis in different wavelengths as optical and infrared by using objects as embedded clusters seems necessary to better trace the spiral structure in the fourth galactic quadrant .",
    "there is an important spread in the imfs slopes computed for massive stars among several young cluster in the galaxy .",
    "this is not yet fully understood , and can be attributed to the fact that ( a ) the imf may not have a universal shape or / and ( b ) there are intrinsic mistakes in its computation ( scalo 1998 ) .",
    "considering then the imf slope given by : + @xmath36 , + where @xmath37 is the number of stars within the logaritmic mass interval @xmath38 around @xmath39 .",
    "the widely accepted slope values are @xmath40 ( salpeter 1955 ) or @xmath41 ( scalo 1998 ) . however , in several very young open clusters ( age @xmath42 yr , see e.g. baume et al . 1999 , 2003 , 2004ab and references therein )",
    "we detect lower values for this parameter .",
    "our computed values for the clusters danks  1/2 together with the value obtained by leistra et al .",
    "( 2005 ) for dbs2003  131 are presented in table  [ tab : param ] .",
    "the results are coherent and lie within the range of typically accepted values for very young clusters .",
    "however , we remark that our derived imfs and their slopes values are influenced by poor statistics .",
    "a uniform and deep study was performed in a region of the galactic plane towards @xmath43 .",
    "this region includes the open clusters danks  1/2 , their surrounding field and also three embedded ir clusters .",
    "the main properties of the different populations located along this line of sight were derived and a description of interstellar medium ( through the color excess behavior ) has allowed us to sketch a better picture of the observed clusters in this galactic direction . in particular , the basic parameters of danks  1/2 , dbs2003  130 and dbs2003  131 were determined .",
    "it must be noticed that the method used analyzing star by star and the inclusion of near ultraviolet @xmath9 data has helped us obtain mean distance values for the open clusters that are quite different from those derived in recent papers , where the latter are based on the analysis of only the global morphology of the cmds . additionally , our optical methods applied for classical embedded clusters offer compatible results with those especific ones used in infrared , giving then more reliability to the results achieved in both cases .",
    "our results indicate that , in order to obtain better picture of complex and reddened regions , near ultraviolet data are necessary .",
    "the performed analysis indicates that danks  1/2 are almost at the same distance from the sun , located probably on the scutum - crux arm .",
    "the analysis of the location of these grouping , together with previous detections in the same portion of the disk , are helping us to get a better picture of the spiral structure of the inner milky way .",
    "additionally , rough estimates of the imfs for both objects were computed for the first time .",
    "the derived slope values were similar to those of other studied addressing young open clusters .",
    "lastly , the optical photometric values of wr 48a were presented and its main parameters were estimated , considering it as a runaway member of danks  1/2 .",
