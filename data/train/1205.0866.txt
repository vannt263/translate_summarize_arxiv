    "the @xmath2 boson pair production process @xmath6 is a crucial one for studying the electroweak gauge symmetry in @xmath7 annihilation .",
    "properties of the weak gauge bosons are closely related to electroweak symmetry breaking and the structure of the gauge sector in general .",
    "thus , detailed examination of ( [ proc1 ] ) at the ilc will both test this sector of the standard model ( sm ) with the highest accuracy and throw light on new physics ( np ) that may appear beyond the sm .    in the sm , for zero electron mass",
    ", the process ( [ proc1 ] ) is described by the amplitudes mediated by photon and @xmath4 boson exchange in the @xmath8-channel and by neutrino exchange in the @xmath9-channel .",
    "therefore , this reaction is particularly sensitive to both the leptonic vertices and the trilinear couplings to @xmath10 of the sm @xmath4 and of any new heavy neutral boson that can be exchanged in the @xmath8-channel .",
    "a popular example in this regard , is represented by the @xmath1s envisaged by electroweak scenarios based on spontaneously broken ` extended ' gauge symmetries , with masses much larger than @xmath11 and coupling constants different from the sm .",
    "the variety of the proposed @xmath1 models is broad .",
    "therefore , rather than attempting an exhaustive analysis , we shall here focus on the phenomenological effects in reaction ( [ proc1 ] ) of the so - called @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 models .",
    "actually , in some sense , we may consider these @xmath1 models as representative of this new physics ( np ) sector @xcite",
    ".    the direct manifestation of @xmath1s would be the observation of peaks in cross sections at very high energy colliders , this would be possible only for @xmath15 lying within the kinematical reach of the machine and sufficient luminosity . indeed , current lower limits on @xmath15 are obtained from direct searches of @xmath1s in drell - yan dilepton pair production at the cern lhc : from the analysis of the 7 tev data , the observed bounds at 95% c. l. range approximately in the interval @xmath16 , depending on the particular @xmath1 model being tested @xcite . for too high masses , @xmath1 exchanges can manifest themselves indirectly , _ via _ deviations of cross sections , and in general of the reaction observables , from the sm predictions .",
    "clearly , this kind of searches requires great precision and therefore will be favoured by extremely high collider luminosity , such as will be available at the ilc .",
    "indirect lower bounds on @xmath1 masses from the high precision lep data at the @xmath4 lie in the range @xmath17 , depending on the model considered @xcite .",
    "indirect effects may be quite subtle , as far as the identification of the source of an observed deviation is concerned , because _ a priori _ different np scenarios may lead to the same or similar experimental signatures .",
    "clearly , then , the discrimination of one np model ( in our case the @xmath1 ) from other possible ones needs an appropriate strategy for analyzing the data .    in this paper",
    ", we study the indirect effects evidencing the mentioned extra @xmath0 gauge bosons in @xmath2 pair production ( [ proc1 ] ) at the next generation @xmath3 international linear collider ( ilc ) , with a center of mass energy @xmath18 and typical time - integrated luminosities of @xmath19  ab@xmath20  @xcite . at the foreseen , really high luminosity this process should be quite sensitive to the indirect np effects at a collider with @xmath21 @xcite , the deviations of cross sections from the sm predictions being expected to increase with @xmath22 due to the violation of the sm gauge cancellation among the different contributions .    along the lines of the previous discussion ,",
    "apart from estimating the foreseeable sensitivity of process ( [ proc1 ] ) to the considered @xmath1 models , we will consider the problem of establishing the potential of ilc of distinguishing the @xmath1 effects , once observed , from the ones due to np competitor models that can lead to analogous physical signatures in the cross section .",
    "for the latter , we will choose the models with anomalous gauge couplings ( agc ) , and compare them with the hypothesis of @xmath1 exchanges .",
    "in the agc models , there is no new gauge boson exchange , but the @xmath23 , @xmath24 couplings are modified with respect to the sm values , this violates the sm gauge cancellation too and leads to deviations of the process cross sections .",
    "agc couplings are described _ via _ a sum of effective interactions , ordered by dimensionality , and we shall restrict our analysis to the dimension - six terms which conserve @xmath25 and @xmath26 @xcite .    the baseline configuration of the ilc envisages a very high electron beam polarization ( larger than 80% ) that is measurable with high precision . also positron beam polarization , around 30% , might be initially obtainable , and this polarization could be raised to about 60% or higher in the ultimate upgrade of the machine . as is well - known , the polarization option represents an asset in order to enhance the discovery reaches and identification sensitivities on np models of any kind @xcite .",
    "this is the case , in particular , of @xmath1 exchanges and agc interactions in process ( [ proc1 ] ) , an obvious example being the suppression of the @xmath27-exchange channel by using right - handed electrons . additional ilc diagnostic ability in @xmath1s and agc would be provided by measures of polarized @xmath28 and @xmath29 in combination with initial beam polarizations .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we briefly review the models involving additional @xmath1 bosons and emphasize the role of @xmath4-@xmath1 mixing in the process ( [ proc1 ] ) . in section iii",
    "we give the parametrization of @xmath1 and agc effects , as well as formulae for helicity amplitudes and cross sections of the process under consideration .",
    "section iv contains , for illustrative purposes , some plots of the unpolarized and polarized cross sections showing the effect of @xmath1 and of @xmath4-@xmath1 mixing . in section v we present the approach , which allows to obtain the discovery reach on @xmath1 parameters ( actually , on the deviations of the transition amplitudes from the sm ) and the obtained numerical results .",
    "section vi includes the results of both model dependent and model independent analyses of the possibilities to differentiate @xmath1 effects from similar ones caused by agc .",
    "finally we conclude in section vii .",
    "the @xmath1 models that will be considered in our analysis are the following @xcite :    * the four possible @xmath30 @xmath0 scenarios originating from the spontaneous breaking of the exceptional group @xmath31 . in this case , two extra , heavy neutral gauge bosons appear as consequence of the symmetry breaking and , generally , only the lightest is assumed to be within reach of the collider .",
    "it is defined , in terms of a new mixing angle @xmath32 , by the linear combination @xmath33 specific choices of @xmath32 : @xmath34 ; @xmath35 ; @xmath36 and @xmath37 , corresponding to different @xmath31 breaking patterns , define the popular scenarios @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 , respectively . * the left - right models , originating from the breaking down of an @xmath42 grand - unification symmetry , and where the corresponding @xmath14 couple to a linear combination of right - handed and @xmath43 neutral currents ( @xmath44 and @xmath45 being baryon and lepton numbers , respectively ) : @xmath46 here , @xmath47 , @xmath48 , additional parameters are the ratio @xmath49 of the @xmath50 gauge couplings and @xmath51 , restricted to the range @xmath52 .",
    "the upper bound corresponds to the so - called lr - symmetric @xmath53 model with @xmath54 , while the lower bound is found to coincide with the @xmath38 model introduced above .",
    "we will consider the former one , @xmath55 , throughout the paper . *",
    "the @xmath56 predicted by the so - called ` alternative ' left - right scenario . for the lr model",
    "we need not introduce additional fermions to cancel anomalies",
    ". however , in the @xmath57 case a variant of this model ( called the alternative lr model ) can be constructed by altering the embeddings of the sm and introducing exotic fermions into the ordinary 10 and 5 representations . * the so - called sequential @xmath58 , where the couplings to fermions are the same as those of the sm @xmath4 .",
    "detailed descriptions of these models , as well as the specific references , can be found , e.  g. , in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "in the extended gauge theories predicting the existence of an extra neutral @xmath1 gauge boson , the mass - squared matrix of the @xmath4 and @xmath0 can have non - diagonal entries @xmath59 , which are related to the vacuum expectation values of the fields of an extended higgs sector @xcite : @xmath60 here , @xmath4 and @xmath0 denote the weak gauge boson eigenstates of @xmath61 and of the extra @xmath62 , respectively .",
    "the mass eigenstates , @xmath63 and @xmath64 , diagonalizing the matrix ( [ massmatrix ] ) , are then obtained by the rotation of the fields @xmath4 and @xmath1 by a mixing angle @xmath65 : @xmath66 here , the mixing angle @xmath65 is expressed in terms of masses as : @xmath67 where @xmath68 , @xmath11 is the mass of the @xmath63-boson in the absence of mixing , i.e. , for @xmath69 .",
    "once we assume the mass @xmath70 to be determined experimentally , the mixing depends on two free parameters , which we identify as @xmath65 and @xmath71 .",
    "we shall here consider the configuration @xmath72 .",
    "the mixing angle @xmath65 will play an important role in our analysis . in general ,",

    "in specific `` minimal - higgs models '' @xcite , @xmath74 here @xmath75 are the higgs vacuum expectation values spontaneously breaking the symmetry , and @xmath76 are their charges with respect to the additional @xmath62 . in addition , in these models the same higgs multiplets are responsible for both generation of mass @xmath70 and for the strength of the @xmath4-@xmath1 mixing @xcite . thus @xmath77 is a model - dependent constant .",
    "for example , in the case of @xmath57 superstring - inspired models @xmath77 can be expressed as @xcite @xmath78 where @xmath79 is the ratio of vacuum expectation values squared , and the constants @xmath80 and @xmath44 are determined by the mixing angle @xmath32 : @xmath81 , @xmath82 .",
    "an important property of the models under consideration is that the gauge eigenstate @xmath0 does not couple to the @xmath10 pair since it is neutral under @xmath83 .",
    "therefore the process ( [ proc1 ] ) , and the searched - for deviations of the cross sections from the sm , are sensitive to a @xmath1 only in the case of a non - zero @xmath4-@xmath0 mixing .",
    "the mixing angle is rather highly constrained , to an upper limit of @xmath84 , mainly from lep measurements at the @xmath4  @xcite .",

    "analogously , one obtains according to the remarks above : @xmath89 where @xmath90 .",
    "the starting point of our analysis will be the amplitude for the process ( [ proc1 ] ) . in the born approximation , this can be written as a sum of a @xmath9-channel and an @xmath8-channel component . in the sm case ,",
