    "in recent years our attempts to understand many aspects of nucleosynthesis and stellar evolution have come to rely on our understanding of the production of the magnesium and aluminium isotopes .",
    "for example , abundance anomalies in globular cluster stars have been a problem for many years , and the role of mg and al is central , and far from understood ( yong et al .",
    "2003 , shetrone 1996 ) . at the heart of this problem is the quest for the production site of the mg and al anomalies : are they produced in the star itself , and mixed to the surface by some form of deep mixing ( denissenkov & weiss 1996 ) or are they the result of pollution from an earlier generation of stars ?",
    "the latter would seem to implicate asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) stars ( denissenkov et al 1996 , ventura et al 2001 ) where mg and al can be produced by thermal pulses and mixed into the envelope by the subsequent third dredge - up ( tdu ) .",
    "although all isotopes of magnesium are produced by supernovae , low - metallicity supernovae models fail to produce enough of the neutron - rich mg isotopes to account for the chemical evolution of mg and mg in the galaxy ( gay & lambert 2000 ) .",
    "other possible sources of the neutron - rich magnesium isotopes include the winds from low - metallicity wolf - rayet ( wr ) ( maeder 1983 ) and agb stars ( siess et al . 2002 , forestini & charbonnel 1997 ) .",
    "there are currently no quantitative studies of the production of the neutron - rich mg isotopes in low - metallicity wr stars .",
    "there are quantitative studies of magnesium production in low metallicity agb stars ( siess et al .",
    "2002 , forestini & charbonnel 1997 ) but these studies do not cover a sufficiently large range of mass or composition to produce yields suitable for galactic chemical evolution models .",
    "for this reason , a quantitative understanding of the production of the heavy mg isotopes in agb models of different mass and metallicity is required if we are to understand the non - solar mg isotopic distribution observed in various stars .",
    "for example , giants in the globular cluster ngc 6752 were observed by yong et al .",
    "( 2003 ) to have highly non - solar mg isotopic ratios , with a slight excess of mg over mg .",
    "as the observed stars do not exhibit the luminosity variations expected if the abundance anomalies were produced internally , it was assumed that the giants were polluted by an earlier generation of stars .",
    "the authors concluded that the earlier generation of stars were likely to be a population of intermediate mass , very low metallicity ( @xmath3 ) agb stars .",
    "aluminium is produced at the expense of mg by the mg - al chain , a process which can produce substantial al ( arnould et al .",
    "whilst most of the al observed in the galaxy today probably originated in young massive stars ( prantzos 1993 ) contributions from other sources such as classical novae and low and intermediate mass agb stars might be important ( meynet 1994 ) .",
    "models of classical novae by jos & hernanz ( 1998 ) find substantial al production .",
    "the production and destruction of al in agb stars has been discussed in detail by mowlavi & meynet ( 1999 ) .",
    "they found that hot bottom burning ( hbb ) in massive agb stars could be an important source of al .",
    "nollett , busso & wasserburg ( 2003 ) studied parameterized extra - mixing processes in low - mass agb models .",
    "they found that , depending on the mixing parameters used , al can be produced in sufficient quantities to explain the amount inferred to have been present in some circumstellar oxide grains at the time of their formation .",
    "whilst these various studies suffer from many uncertainties , they make the point that there may be many sources contributing to the al in the galaxy .",
    "models were calculated with the mount stromlo stellar structure code ( wood & zarro 1981 , frost & lattanzio 1996 ) updated to include the opal opacities of iglesias & rogers ( 1996 ) .",
    "mass loss was included using the prescription of vassiliadis & wood ( 1993 ) but without the modification for @xmath4 greater than 2.5@xmath5 .",
    "we calculated model sequences for three different initial compositions : @xmath6 and @xmath7 over a range in mass @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the initial stellar mass .",
    "initial abundances for the cno elements were taken from grevesse , noels & sauval ( 1992 ) for the @xmath10 models , and from russell & dopita ( 1992 ) for the large magellanic cloud compositions ( @xmath11 ) and small magellanic cloud compositions ( @xmath12 ) .",
    "we use the standard mixing - length theory for convection , with a mixing - length parameter @xmath13 .",
    "we find the convective boundary at the base of the outer envelope by searching for a neutral border to the convective zone , in the manner described in frost & lattanzio ( 1996 ) and karakas , lattanzio & pols ( 2002 ) .",
    "we note that while this method does increase the efficiency of the tdu for low - mass models , we do not find any dredge - up for the @xmath10 models with @xmath14 .",
    "reaction rates used in the evolution code were taken mostly from caughlan & fowler ( 1988 ) , but with updates included in the nucleosynthesis calculations ( see below ) .",
    "we performed detailed nucleosynthesis calculations separately using a post - processing nucleosynthesis code which includes time - dependent diffusive mixing , 506 reactions and 74 species up to sulphur .",
    "we also include a small neutron capture network based on the iron - peak elements .",
    "the bulk of the 506 reaction rates are from the reaclib data tables , based on the 1991 updated version of the compilation by thielemann , arnould & truran ( 1991 ) .",
    "we include recent reaction rates for @xmath15 , proton and neutron capture reactions when available , as detailed in lugaro ( 1998 ) .",
    "the magnesium and aluminium isotopes are produced in three sites in agb stars : the hydrogen - burning shell ( h - shell ) via the mg - al chain , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : reactions ] ( rolfs & rodney 1988 ) ; the helium - burning shell ( he - shell ) via @xmath15-capture on ne and at the base of the convective envelope in the most massive agb stars that experience hbb , again via the mg - al chain .",
    "the efficiency of production of each site depends in a complicated way on the temperature ( i.e. via the initial mass ) , initial composition and the extent to which each site affects the other .",
    "magnesium and aluminium are produced in the h - burning shell via the activation of the mg - al chain . in fig .",
    "[ fig : reactions ] we show the reactions involved in the ne - na and the mg - al chains ( arnould et al . 1999 , rolfs & rodney 1988 ) .",
    "the first isotope in the mg - al chain to be affected is mg , which is burnt to al when the temperature exceeds about 30 million k. the isotope al is unstable to @xmath16-decay but the lifetime of @xmath16-decay relative to proton capture generally favours proton capture within the h - burning shell .",
    "this produces the unstable si which @xmath16-decays ( with a lifetime on the order of a few seconds ) to al .",
    "if temperatures exceed 70  million  k , mg @xmath17 p leads to the production of mg along with al and al .    in low - mass models ] , the only change to the surface abundance of the mg and al isotopes comes from the h - burning shell .",
    "the ashes of the h - burning shell are first engulfed by the convective pocket before dredge - up occurs . in low - mass models ,",
    "the mg isotopes are not effected by he - shell burning but al can be destroyed by neutron capture .",
    "neutrons come from two reactions in agb stars : c(@xmath15 , n)o and ne(@xmath15,n)mg . as the temperature is too low for the activation of the ne neutron source , the only free neutrons are from the c neutron source .",
    "we do not include a c pocket in our models , so the neutrons in the convective pocket are from the c left by the h - burning shell .       in fig .",
    "[ fig : yield ] we plot the yields of mg ( upper panel ) , mg ( middle panel ) and al ( lower panel ) as a function of the stellar mass and composition .",
    "we weight the stellar yields by the initial mass function of kroupa , tout & gilmore ( 1993 ) . in each figure , the black solid line ( and points ) refer to the @xmath10 models , the blue dashed line ( and open squares ) refer to the @xmath11 models and the red dot - dashed line ( and open circles ) refer to the @xmath12 models .",
    "we plot for comparison the yields of forestini & charbonnel ( 1997 ) ( hereafter fc97 ) , also weighted by the imf .",
    "the solid green squares are the @xmath10 results from fc97 and the solid magenta triangles the @xmath18 results from fc97 .",
    "the first thing we note from fig .",
    "[ fig : yield ] is that the yields are highly metallicity dependent .",
    "for the three species considered , the @xmath12 yields are considerably larger than the @xmath10 yields .",
    "the yields are also highly dependent on the initial stellar mass .",
    "as expected , low - mass models contribute little to the production of neutron - rich mg isotopes , mg and mg or to the radionuclide al .",
    "also as expected from the above discussion , the yields from the models with hbb produce the largest amount of al . if we compare our results to fc97 we find we produce more of the neutron - rich mg isotopes at all masses and metallicities .",
    "we also produce more al in the @xmath11 and @xmath12 models but about the same at @xmath10 .",
    "the large difference between our yields and those of fc97 is most likely explained by the different modelling approaches used .",
    "we used detailed stellar models for most of the tp - agb phase , only resorting to synthetic modelling for the final few thermal pulses .",
    "this means that we do not have to treat hbb synthetically , as hbb had ended by the time the detailed model calculations ceased . in comparison ,",
    "fc97 use detailed modelling for the pre - agb phase and a few thermal pulses .",
    "the majority of the thermal pulses , and the hbb phase , were calculated synthetically .",
    "the surface abundance changes caused by hbb are highly dependent on the temperature ( and the density ) at the base of the convective envelope .",
    "if these quantities are not treated correctly in the synthetic model , the resulting yields will be quite different to those found from detailed modelling .",
    "for example , fc97 extrapolated the behaviour of the temperature at the base of the envelope forward in time , realising that this extrapolation was likely to be incorrect .",
    "the differences between synthetic and detailed modelling also applies to those species affected by he - shell burning , such as the neutron - rich mg isotopes .",
    "a synthetic calculation can not follow the change to the intershell composition with time . indeed",
    ", most calculations ( marigo 2001 ) assume that the intershell composition remains constant over the entire tp - agb phase .",
    "we find that the intershell abundance varies not only with mass but also with time , and that the peak production of some species is found right at the end of the tp - agb , when the he - shell is hottest .",
    "we also note that the stellar yields are also dependent on the final remnant mass .",
    "the final mass of a stellar model depends on the details of the previous core h and he - burning phases as well as on the mass - loss rates .",
    "these details can differ dramatically from one calculation to another , making direct comparison difficult .      in conclusion",
    ", we find that intermediate mass tp - agb models can produce substantial quantities of the neutron - rich mg isotopes from he - shell burning .",
    "the most massive agb models can also produce substantial al from hbb .",
    "the yields presented here are subject to many uncertainties , including the modelling of the third dredge up as well as reaction rate uncertainties .",
    "recent observations of non - solar mg isotopic ratios could help constrain some of these uncertainties . for example , yong et al .",
    "( 2003 ) found non - solar mg isotopic ratios in giant stars in the globular cluster stars ngc 6752 , with a slight excess of mg over mg in most of the stars .",
    "yong et al .",
    "( 2003 ) discuss the possibility of agb stars polluting the stars in this cluster .",
    "whilst our more massive models ( @xmath19 ) produce mg isotopic ratios consistent with their observations , most of our models have an excess of mg over mg .",
    "clearly further work needs to be done , including low - metallicity agb models and a detailed study of the dependence of mass - loss and the reaction rate uncertainties on the yields ."
