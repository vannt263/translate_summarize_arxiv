    "understanding the mechanical response of granular materials is still one of the remaining challenges in materials science and physics .",
    "the research is motivated by many industrial and geophysical applications @xcite .",
    "a granular packing at rest does not behave like an ordinary elastic solid , because the relation between stress and strain is nonlinear , depends on the fabric and on the loading path , and gives rise to energy dissipation @xcite .",
    "these properties have been investigated for packings of spheres , where they could be traced back to the nonlinearity of hertzian contacts , disorder , and coulomb friction law . in these studies",
    "the contacts between the spheres were supposed to remain closed under the strain .",
    "however , there is another source of the nonlinear elastic response in granular media , which has not been studied in such detail yet @xcite . due to the absence of attractive contact forces in dry granular media , the contacts can open , and thus do not transmit any elastic restoring nor frictional force . even in the case of linear ( hookean )",
    "elasticity on the particle level ( e.g.  for packings of parallel cylinders ) , the vanishing of the elastic response under tension renders the macroscopic elastic behavior nonlinear .",
    "it is this nonlinearity which we analyze in this paper .",
    "it is known that the contact and force networks in sheared granular materials are anisotropic @xcite .",
    "the present analytical approach links the fabric anisotropy to the shear deformation for fixed volumetric strain .    in the following",
    ", we investigate the incremental linear response of a pre - strained two dimensional packing of disks and relate the elements of the stiffness tensor to the mean packing properties and the probability distribution of contact orientations .",
    "then , analytical expressions for the elastic moduli of isotropic and sheared contact networks are derived , and the results are compared with numerical simulations .",
    "the elastic response of solids to deformations is classically expressed in terms of the relationship between the _ stress _ tensor @xmath0 and the _ strain _ tensor @xmath1 .",
    "let us assume that the relation between the incremental stress tensor @xmath2 and the incremental strain tensor @xmath3 can be expressed by analytical functions @xmath4 as @xmath5 where @xmath4 satisfy @xmath6 . here",
    ", @xmath7 is the dimension of the system . in the limit of small deformations , eq .",
    "( [ stress - strain1 ] ) can be approximated by taylor expansion to first order in the strain increment @xmath8 where @xmath9 is a tensor of rank @xmath10 , referred to as the _ stiffness _ or _ elasticity _ tensor .",
    "equation  ( [ stiffness - definition ] ) can be regarded as the generalization of _ hooke s law _ that describes the linear response of the medium to external perturbations .",
    "although @xmath9 has @xmath11 elements in a two - dimensional system , symmetry considerations for the stress and strain tensors imply that there are usually less independent elements .",
    "for example , the symmetry of a completely isotropic material requires that @xmath9 has only two independent elements , commonly represented by the _ lam _",
    "coefficients or , alternatively , by _",
    "poisson s ratio _ and _ young s modulus_.    in this section , it is recalled , how an approximate expression for the stiffness tensor of a dense assembly of grains can be obtained , which allows to calculate the elastic moduli from mean packing properties and the probability distribution of contact orientations @xcite .",
    "the schematic figure [ fig : schematic](a ) shows the undeformed shapes of two particles at positions a and b. their overlap is a measure of the elastic deformation at their contact @xmath12 .",
    "the normal and tangential contact unit vectors are denoted by @xmath13 and @xmath14 , and the branch vector @xmath15 connects the centers of the particles .",
    "each contact force is modeled by two linear springs in the normal and tangential directions with the spring constants @xmath16 and @xmath17 , respectively .",
    "this harmonic force law approximates the interaction for two - dimensional disks for small deformations @xcite . starting from an arbitrary weakly deformed state , the change in the force exerted by particle b on particle a due to an additional small deformation of the system is @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the change of the branch vector due to the displacement of the particle centers .",
    "it is supposed that the contacts do not break due to the imposed deformation .",
    "this is justified by the fact that during the measurement of the macroscopic elastic moduli , the material is subjected only to incremental strain changes so that the fabric remains nearly unchanged .",
    "the average stress increment can be approximated by @xcite @xmath20 where terms of order ( overlap / particle radius ) have been neglected .",
    "this is sufficiently accurate for small pre - strains . here",
    ", the sum runs over all contacts @xmath21 within the volume @xmath22 . using eqs .",
    "( [ contact - force ] ) and ( [ eq : stress ] ) one obtains @xmath23     between the particles @xmath24 and @xmath25 including the branch vector @xmath15 , the normal unit vector @xmath13 , and the tangential unit vector @xmath14 .",
    "( b ) @xmath13 and @xmath14 in an arbitrarily chosen cartesian coordinates @xmath26 . ]    a crucial simplification of this expression is obtained , if one assumes _ affine _ displacements of the particle centers , which states that the displacement gradient is constant or varies only slowly on the scale of the particle size . in this way , the non - affine parts of the relative displacements are neglected and the remaining part according to the macroscopic strain increment is given by @xmath27 inserting eq .",

    "( [ eq : stress - tensor-2 ] ) , one obtains @xmath28 for narrow size distributions and small pre - strain , one may replace @xmath29 by the average particle diameter @xmath30 .",
    "polydispersity leads , in first order , to an additional factor that only depends on the moments of the particle size distribution @xcite . by comparing eqs .",
    "( [ eq : stress - affine ] ) and ( [ stiffness - definition ] ) the stiffness tensor is identified as @xcite @xmath31    denoting the normal and tangential unit vectors as @xmath32 ) and @xmath33 ) [ see fig .",
    "[ fig : schematic](b ) ] , the sum over the contacts located inside the volume @xmath22 can be replaced by an integral over the contact orientation distribution @xmath34 @xcite so that @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the average coordination number , @xmath37 is the volume fraction of the packing , and @xmath38 denotes the probability to find a contact with an orientation between @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : elastictensor2 ] ) , the elements of the stiffness tensor are determined by the fabric properties : @xmath41 , @xmath42 , and @xmath34 .",
    "it is convenient to choose the principal axes of the strain tensor increment @xmath43 as coordinate system so that @xmath44 with @xmath45(@xmath46 ) and @xmath47 , the change in the volumetric strain and in the shear deformation , respectively",
    ". then eq .",
    "( [ stiffness - definition ] ) can be written as @xmath48    the balance of torques requires that the average stress tensor remains symmetric , i.e. @xmath49 . hence , the following constraints must hold in equilibrium @xmath50 using ( [ eq : elastictensor2 ] )",
    "this implies that only those incremental deformations do not induce torques inside the packing ( and hence lead to particle rotations ) , whose principal axes are compatible with the contact orientation distribution in the sense that @xmath51    evaluating ( [ eq : elastictensor2 ] ) for fabrics that fulfill the constraint ( [ eq : no_torque_condition ] ) gives the following expressions for the elements of the stiffness tensor : @xmath52",
    "in the following we consider biaxial deformations , which means that the principal axes of the strain tensor do not change , while the sample is deformed .",
    "if the deformation starts from an isotropic configuration , the fabric ( @xmath34 ) will remain symmetric with respect to @xmath53 .",
    "hence ( [ eq : no_torque_condition ] ) is fulfilled and ( [ eq : cabaa ] ) vanishes , as one averages odd functions with an even distribution .",
    "this simplifies matters considerably , as it implies that the principal axes of stress and strain coincide so that @xmath54 where @xmath55 and @xmath56 are the incremental pressure and shear stress .",
    "one defines the bulk modulus @xmath57 , the shear modulus @xmath58 and the anisotropy modulus @xmath24 by @xmath59 according to ( [ stress - stiffness - strain ] ) and ( [ eq : caaaa ] ) - ( [ eq : caabb ] ) @xmath60    for an isotropic fabric , @xmath61 , the result of kruyt and rothenburg @xcite is reproduced : @xmath62 in the next section a simple model is proposed for the kind of anisotropy , a granular packing develops under the influence of shear .",
    "in order to elucidate the effect of unilaterality on the stress - strain relationship , we must consider the closing respectively opening of contacts , as a finite volumetric strain @xmath63 and shear deformation @xmath64 build up , starting from an isotropic , stress - free , jammed packing ( unstrained reference state with zero overlap ) .",
    "assuming again that the particle displacements may be approximately regarded as affine , the distance between the centers of neighboring particles changes due to the strain @xmath1 by @xmath65 the change depends on @xmath1 as well as on the direction of the branch vector , @xmath39 .",
    "if the two particles touched each other , i.e. @xmath66 in the unstrained state , a positive @xmath67 means that the deformation leads to an overlap , while a negative value indicates that the particles are no longer in contact in the strained state . when there is a gap between the particle surfaces in the unstrained configuration , an overlap can also form , if @xmath67 is larger than the gap .",
    "therefore we extend the notion of an overlap to include small negative values , @xmath68 , which tell the size of the gap .",
    "we introduce the probability density @xmath69 that a particle pair has a branch vector at an angle @xmath39 with respect to the principal axis of the strain tensor @xmath1 , belonging to the eigenvalue @xmath70 , and that the overlap respectively the negative gap has a value @xmath71 .",
    "this probability density depends on the strain @xmath1 .",
    "for @xmath72 it is assumed to be isotropic , i.e. independent of @xmath39 , and it fulfills @xmath73 for @xmath74 , as there are no overlaps in the unstrained configuration , and @xmath75 for @xmath76 , as the unstrained configuration is jammed .",
    "we assume that the probability distribution simply shifts by @xmath67 , eq . ( [ eq : delta_xi ] ) , under the influence of strain : @xmath77    the probability that a pair of neighbor particles is actually in contact is @xmath78 the probability density , that a contact has a certain angle @xmath39 with respect to the principal axis of the strain , which belongs to the eigenvalue @xmath70 , is @xmath79 applying the assumption ( [ eq : q - model ] ) , the integral is in first order of @xmath1 given by @xmath80 integrating this over @xmath39 gives the corresponding first order approximation of @xmath81 : @xmath82 hence the properly normalized first order approximation of the probability density of contact directions is @xmath83 this approximation can at most be applied for @xmath84 , as otherwise the probability density would not be positive semi definite .",
    "@xmath53 is the direction of the principal axis belonging to the eigenvalue @xmath70 . for @xmath85 ( compressive strain ) and @xmath86 ( by definition )",
    "this is the direction in which the precompressed system expands during biaxial deformation . therefore contacts preferentially open in this direction so that @xmath87",

    "fig.[fig : e_and_g_vs_epsilon ] shows that the bulk and shear moduli divided by @xmath105 are approximately constant for strong enough compression , @xmath113 , in agreement with eq.([eq : anisotropic_case ] ) .",
    "however , as one approaches the unstrained configuration ( at the jamming transition ) , the elastic moduli obtained from evaluating incremental strain tests soften , whereas the ones calculated from the fabric remain unchanged .",
    "this shows that close to the jamming transition the assumption that the incremental particle movements are affine fails , in agreement with the findings of @xcite .",

    "remarkably , the ratio of the two moduli , @xmath115 is very close to the prediction of the simple theory , @xmath116 . also , the values calculated from the fabric agree with the theory , whereas the ones obtained by evaluating eqs.([experiment1 ] ) and ( [ experiment2 ] ) are about 20 % smaller .",
    "fig.[fig : e_and_g_vs_epsilon ] also shows that the contact density ( @xmath117 ) increases the more compressed the packing is , while it decreases , if a precompressed sample is sheared at fixed volume , see fig.[fig : e_and_g_vs_gamma ] , provided @xmath64 remains small enough . for large shear deformation ,",
    "the system presumably forms a shear band and begins to flow .",
    "then the contact density must become independent of @xmath64 .",
    "the transition from elastic to plastic response can be seen in fig.[fig : elastic_regime ] . the shear stress first increases linearly with @xmath64 and saturates for large deformation , indicating the plastic regime .",
    "this shows , that one can speak about elastic response only for @xmath118 .",
    "fig.[fig : e_and_g_vs_gamma ] confirms that bulk and shear moduli , divided by the contact density , do not change , when a precompressed state is sheared , in agreement with the theoretical result eq.([eq : anisotropic_case ] ) .",
