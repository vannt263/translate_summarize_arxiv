    "the evolution of cellular networks is constantly progressing towards increased heterogeneity of network infrastructure , in order to respond to the ever increasing traffic demands . from homogeneous cellular networks consisting of macro base stations only to heterogeneous cellular networks consisting of multiple types of base stations ,",
    "the evolution of the infrastructure offers plenty of challenges for network engineers @xcite .",
    "heading towards the fifth generation ( 5 g ) , there is a broad consensus that one of the major requirements of future networks is higher spectral efficiency and higher energy efficiency @xcite .",
    "the increasing heterogeneity requires reconsidering some fundamental mechanisms in the networks , one of which is the cell association process . for some devices in the network , with multiple base stations in the surrounding , an optimal base station for downlink access does not necessarily need to be optimal for the uplink access .",
    "one of the main reasons is the difference in the signal and interference power in both directions .",
    "therefore , in certain circumstances and for certain devices , it is beneficial to decouple downlink and uplink and treat them as two independent communication links , which leads to the concept of _ decoupled downlink / uplink access_.    the decoupled access was first indicated in @xcite , where the author suggests decoupling due to the difference in signal power and interference in both directions .",
    "furthermore , the authors in @xcite suggest decoupling in order to achieve fair allocation between the resources from different base stations , i.e. it can be beneficial for a device to associate to less loaded base station with worse channel conditions than to highly loaded base station with better channel conditions .",
    "the most recent work is the one conducted in @xcite .",
    "the authors in @xcite show the throughput benefits using real - world simulator , while the authors in @xcite derive the joint association probabilities for two - tier network with decoupled access and show the improvement in the uplink coverage probability .",
    "the decoupled access was also mentioned in @xcite in terms of device - to - device ( d2d ) communications , where the authors assume that downlink and uplink are two separate links and perform the analysis separately .",
    "in this paper we present theoretical analysis of a two - tier heterogeneous cellular system with decoupled downlink ( dl ) and uplink ( ul ) access , in dense user environment .",
    "we introduce simple two - level uplink power adaptation and evaluate the system performance for varying uplink power levels .",
    "the system model is based on stochastic geometry , which is successfully used for cellular networks modeling @xcite . the system is also suitable for machine - type devices that have a much higher density compared to the density of the base stations .",
    "additional feature of machine - type traffic is their high uplink / downlink ratio , which gains in significance with the improved uplink coverage with decoupled access @xcite .",
    "the results presented in this paper reveal that , under certain circumstances , we can achieve improvement , both for the spectral efficiency and the energy efficiency in the system with decoupled dl and ul , only by using a simple , two - level uplink power adaptation .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section [ sysmodel ] describes the system model used to evaluate the decoupled access .",
    "section [ sec : analysis ] contains the main results of the association probability , the distribution of the distance to the serving base station and spectral and energy efficiency .",
    "section [ sec : numericalresults ] give the numerical results regarding the analysis and section [ conclusion ] concludes the paper .",
    "we model a two - tier heterogeneous cellular network , consisting of macro cell ( mcell ) tier and small cell ( scell ) tier and heterogeneous user domain .",
    "the nodes in the system are deployed by homogeneous poisson point process ( ppp ) @xmath0 with intensity measure @xmath1 . a point in @xmath2 , that is a realization of a ppp @xmath0",
    "is denoted as @xmath3 . for mcell base stations ( mbss ) , @xmath4 , for scell base stations ( sbss ) , @xmath5 and for the devices @xmath6 .",
    "the transmit power of mbss is @xmath7 and the transmit power of sbss is @xmath8 , such that @xmath9 . assuming @xmath10 , there is always one active device per base station on a dedicated resource unit .",
    "the transmit power of the devices associated to mbss and sbss is @xmath11 and @xmath12 , respectively . while for the dl transmissions it is per definition clear that @xmath13 , we are not predefining a similar relationship for @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "however , it is intuitively expected that @xmath14 , because more power is needed to transmit to a more distant base stations . for homogeneous user domain , @xmath15 . on the other hand , we make the following assumption about the ratio of the transmit powers : @xmath16 the rationale for this will become clear in relation to the association regions on fig .  [",
    "fig : assocregions ] .",
    "the analysis is performed on a typical device , located at the origin , which is allowed by slivnyak s theorem @xcite .",
    "the received signal in dl at the typical device from a base station located at @xmath3 and the received signal in ul at a base station located at @xmath3 are given by : @xmath17 where @xmath18 and consequently @xmath3 can be a point from @xmath19 or @xmath20 .",
    "@xmath21 describes the fast fading process at the point @xmath3 .",
    "we assume rayleigh fading with independent identically distributed ( i.i.d ) magnitude with unit mean @xmath22 . due to the i.i.d .",
    "assumption , we will omit the subscript whenever there is no danger to cause confusion .",
    "a device applies two separate rules for association in the dl and the ul , respectively .",
    "the association is based on maximum average received signal power , averaged over fast fading .",
    "the following equations formulate the dl and the ul association rule , respectively : @xmath23 } & = & \\underset{v \\in \\{m , s\\}}\\operatorname*{arg\\,max}{p_v \\left\\|x_v\\right\\|^{-\\alpha } } \\label{dlsignal_average } \\\\ j = \\underset{v \\in \\{m , s\\}}\\operatorname*{arg\\,max}{\\mathbb{e}_{h}\\left [ s_{ul , v } \\right ] } & = & \\underset{v \\in \\{m , s\\}}\\operatorname*{arg\\,max}{q_v \\left\\|x_v\\right\\|^{-\\alpha } } \\label{ulsignal_average}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the concept of decoupled access implies that @xmath24 can be different than @xmath25 and the device can be associated to two different base stations , each one associated with one direction , dl or ul .    the analysis is focused on the ul .",
    "basically , by decoupling dl and ul and adapting the ul association to the signals transmitted in ul , there is an improved signal - to - interference - plus - noise - ratio ( sinr ) for the ul @xcite .",
    "the typical device has interference from devices associated to other base stations , transmitting on the same resource unit . under the assumption of orthogonal resource allocation in one cell",
    ", we model the number of interfering devices to be equal to the number of base stations ( one interferer per base station ) .",
    "the interfering devices are modeled by independent homogeneous ppp @xmath26 with intensity measure @xmath27 , such that @xmath28 .",
    "alternative way to define the spatial process for the interfering machines is by thinning @xcite the original point process @xmath29 with probability @xmath30 .",
    "although this model of interference is an approximation , due to the dependence introduced by the association process , the authors in @xcite show that this dependence is weak and it is justified to approximate the interfering devices by independent homogeneous ppp .",
    "we assume that each transmission from a device requires one resource unit . putting this in the context of lte ,",
    "the resource unit is the resource block ( rb ) , which is the minimum scheduling unit that can be assigned to a particular device . in the context of m2 m traffic , this can be interpreted as having already reserved resources for the machines and each machine is assigned one resource unit for one transmission .",
    "the main purpose of this paper is to evaluate the performance of decoupled access with the simple power adaptation , based purely on the signal power improvement in ul along with the association process . for resource reservation with high reliability",
    ", one can refer to the schemes presented in @xcite .",
    "the presented system is evaluated in terms of spectral and energy efficiency . the spectral efficiency @xmath31 is defined as the channel capacity normalized by the system bandwidth .",
    "the energy efficiency @xmath32 is defined as the channel capacity normalized by the system power consumption .",
    "these quantities are analytically defined as  @xcite : @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the allocated frequency bandwidth . the total power consumption ( @xmath35 ) is defined as @xcite : @xmath36 where @xmath37 , @xmath38 is the power amplifier efficiency and @xmath39 is the circuit consumption .",
    "we will use the general definitions in ( [ sedef ] ) and ( [ eedef ] ) to derive the spectral and energy efficiency for the system described above .",
    "our main purpose is to analyze the impact that the simple power adaptation has on these two quantities , @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "in this section , we first derive the joint association probability and the distance distributions to the serving base stations .",
    "we then use these results to derive the spectral and energy efficiency .",
    "the association process can lead to one of the four possible association cases : ( i ) case 1 : dlap = ulap = mbs ; ( ii ) case 2 : dlap = mbs and ulap = sbs ; ( iii ) case 3 : dlap = sbs and ulap = mbs and ( iv ) case 4 : dlap = ulap = sbs .",
    "the joint association probabilities for homogeneous user domain ( all devices transmit with the same transmit power ) are already elaborated in @xcite .",
    "we follow the same procedure and derive the association probabilities for the model described in this paper , where devices transmit with two power levels , depending on the type of base station they are transmitting to .",
    "let @xmath40 and @xmath41 denote the distance from the nearest mbs and sbs to the typical point at the origin , which probability density function ( pdf ) and cumulative distribution function ( cdf ) are derived using contact distributions of a point process ( the probability that there in no point in the circle with radius @xmath42 @xcite ) and are given by : @xmath43 rephrasing the association rules given by ( [ dlsignal_average ] ) and ( [ ulsignal_average ] ) , one can say that a device is associated to mbs in dl if @xmath44 and it is associated to mbs in ul if @xmath45 .",

    "the main results in the paper clearly show that a simple , two - level power adaptation can bring improvement both for the spectral and the energy efficiency in the system .",
    "furthermore , the association and the power adaptation provides some kind of fairness among the devices in order to improve the average performance of the system .",
    "this initial observations on spectral and energy efficiency with decoupling open new possibilities for joint optimization of ul transmit powers in order to meet certain spectral and energy efficiency targets . our future work will be focused on finding optimal ul transmit power levels in order to meet the requirements for devices in a certain service region .",
