    "strangely , not all static low - energy properties of the nucleon are yet measured .",
    "in particular , practically no experimental information exists on the nucleon form factors of the strange - quark vector current , the subject of our paper .",
    "one might ask why these observables have so far escaped experimental scrutiny .",
    "certainly they are not easy to measure , requiring high - statistics neutral current experiments at the limits of present capabilities , but perhaps more importantly they were widely expected to be zero or at least small .    in the absence of direct insight from qcd at low energies , these expectations had been guided by hadron models , and most prominently by the nonrelativistic quark model ( nrqm ) @xcite .",
    "the latter gained particular credibility by describing the low - lying meson and baryon spectra better than other , and often more complex , hadron models .",
    "however , this model is based either on the complete neglect or at least on a drastic simplification of relativistic effects , which seems hard to justify in the light quark sector .",
    "this limited treatment does of course not only affect the valence quarks .",
    "more importantly in our context , it excludes vacuum fluctuations and , in particular , the existence of virtual quark - antiquark pairs in the hadron wave functions .",

    "it therefore came as a surprise to many when deep inelastic @xmath1 scattering data from the european muon collaboration ( emc ) @xcite indicated a rather large strange quark contribution to the singlet axial current of the nucleon .",
    "the emc measured the polarized proton structure function @xmath2 in a large range of the bjorken variable , @xmath3 $ ] @xcite and found , after regge extrapolation to @xmath4 and combination with earlier slac data , _ 0 ^ 1 dx g_1^p(x ) = 0.1260.010 ( stat ) 0.015 ( syst ) at @xmath5 .",
    "ellis and jaffe s prediction @xcite , which neglected strange quark contributions , was significantly larger : @xmath6 . from the above data",
    ", however , one extracts a nonvanishing strange quark contribution @xmath7 to the proton spin , or equivalently , via the bjorken sum rule , a substantial strangeness contribution to the proton matrix element of the isoscalar axial - vector current .    the low - energy elastic @xmath8 scattering experiment e734 at brookhaven @xcite complemented the emc data by measuring the same matrix element at smaller momenta , @xmath9 .",
    "the results of this experiment also contain information on the strange vector form factors and will therefore be discussed in more detail later , in sec .",
    "[ exptsection ] .",
    "the extracted axial vector current form factors are consistent with the muon scattering data from the emc @xcite .",
    "the scalar channel provides additional , although indirect , experimental evidence for a significant strangeness content of the nucleon @xcite .",
    "it stems from the nucleon sigma term , @xmath10 , which can be extracted from pion - nucleon scattering data . defining",
    "the ratio @xmath11 as r_s = su + d + s , [ r ] ( @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the up , down and strange quark fields , and @xmath15 denotes the nucleon state ) one finds @xmath16 .",
    "again , the resulting @xmath17 matrix element is surprisingly large , of up to half the magnitude of the corresponding up - quark matrix element .",
    "this implies that the nucleon mass would be reduced by @xmath18 in a world with massless strange quarks .",
    "the analysis leading to the quoted range of @xmath11 values is , however , not uncontroversial , and smaller values have been suggested @xcite .    in any case",
    ", there is evidence that strange quarks play a more significant role in the nucleon than the quark model suggests .",
    "one direction for the further exploration of this intriguing issue is to study the nucleon matrix elements of strange - quark operators in other channels .",
    "since the electroweak neutral currents provide us with experimental probes in the vector channel , the strange vector current has recently received considerable attention . in particular , a number of devoted experiments at mit - bates @xcite and cebaf @xcite ( see sec . [ exptsection ] ) will measure part of the corresponding form factors at low momenta .",
    "in this situation it would clearly be desirable to have reliable theoretical predictions for these form factors .",
    "unfortunately , the present status of our theoretical understanding is qualitative at best .",
    "a phenomenological estimate and some model calculations have been performed , but all results have large theoretical uncertainties and are partially inconsistent with each other .",
    "since the sea quark distribution in hadrons arises from a subtle interplay of quantum effects in qcd , their reproduction in hadron models is much more challenging than the calculation of the standard static observables .",
    "lattice calculations of strange quark distributions have not yet been performed since the disconnected quark loops increase the computational demands of form factor calculations substantially .",
    "the particular value of the strange quark mass , which is neither light nor heavy compared to the qcd scale @xmath19 , additionally complicates the theoretical situation .",
    "in contrast to the light up and down quarks , the effects of the heavier strange quark are much harder to approach from the chiral limit , _",

    "the purpose of this paper is to assess the present theoretical status by discussing some of the proposed models , and to extend our previous estimate of the nucleon strangeness radius in a vector dominance model to the calculation of the strangeness vector form factors in the momentum region of interest for the planned experiments .    in sec .",

    "[ 5section ] we summarize the paper and present our conclusions .",
    "in order to quantify the concept of the nucleon s strangeness distributions in the language of qcd , one considers nucleon matrix elements of the form s , where @xmath21 stands for a dirac matrix which selects the space - time quantum numbers of the matrix element .",
    "these matrix elements are in general scale  dependent . as indicated in the introduction",
    ", we will discuss in particular the matrix element of the strange vector current ( _ i.e. _ @xmath22 ) , which , due to strangeness conservation , is independent of the subtraction point of the current operator .",
    "most of the theoretical work has so far focused on the lowest nonvanishing radial moments of the strangeness spin and charge distributions .",
    "these are the strangeness magnetic moment @xmath23 , defined as the z - component of _ s = 12 d^3 r s , and the square of the strangeness radius , r^2_s = d^3 r ^ 2 _ 0 s .    in analogy to the electromagnetic case",

    "s = ( p^ ) ( _ f_1^s(q^2 ) + i f_2^s(q^2 ) ) n(p ) , [ sff ] where @xmath24 and @xmath25 is the free dirac spinor of the nucleon .",
    "strangeness conservation and the zero overall strangeness charge of the proton imply @xmath26 .",
    "it is often convenient to use the electric and magnetic form factors introduced by sachs g_e^s(q^2 ) & = & f_1^s(q^2 ) + q^24m_n^2f_2^s(q^2 ) , + g_m^s(q^2 ) & = & f_1^s(q^2 ) + f_2^s(q^2 ) , [ sachs ] which describe the strangeness charge and current distribution , respectively .",
    "the above matrix elements for @xmath23 and @xmath27 are simply related to the form factors by _",

    "an alternative definition , based on the dirac form factor ( _ i.e. _ @xmath28 ) , has also been used in the literature .    for the following discussion it will be useful to recall the relation of the strangeness vector current to the other neutral vector currents and to the standard @xmath29 current nonet in the three - flavor sector , j^a_= _ q , [ flavcurr ] with @xmath30 and @xmath31 . in the standard flavor basis defined by eq .",

    "refitted the e734 cross sections and , in contrast to the original analysis , allowed the strange vector form factors to be different from zero .",
    "their analysis also takes the neutron electromagnetic form factor into account and fits the value of the mass parameter in the axial form factors , @xmath35 .",
    "the observed elastic @xmath32 and @xmath33 scattering events and their statistical and systematical errors were binned in only seven @xmath36 regions , which limits the number of fit parameters which can be determined from this data set .",

    "it is neither supported by the existing theoretical estimates nor by simple `` quark - core plus meson - cloud '' pictures of the nucleon . in the latter",
    ", one expects the electromagnetic charge and current distribution to be carried by a valence quark core and a meson cloud . due to",
    "the absence of strange valence quarks one would expect a different , more outwards shifted strangeness distribution in this picture .",
    "we will discuss the dipole form further in the last section of this paper , where we compare it with our results and with another phenomenological estimate .",

    "s reanalysis of the bnl neutrino scattering data and found in other models , and that the three - pole ansatz does not allow the form factors to decay with the large powers of @xmath82 established via quark counting rules .",
    "the first nucleon model estimate of the low - momentum strangeness form factors was based on the skyrme model @xcite .",
    "the latter is a topological soliton model , built on a chiral meson lagrangian .",
    "many variants of this model and of its treatment exist and are described _",
    "e.g. _ in the reviews @xcite .",
    "the extension to the @xmath39 flavor sector and its breaking is not unique and allows an even wider choice in the specific approach , which of course leads to some ambiguity in the results .",
    "the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite choose the original skyrme model @xcite and introduce flavor symmetry breaking by non - minimal derivative terms in the lagrangian .",
    "after canonical quantization in the restricted hilbert space of collective and radial excitations , the hamilton operator is diagonalized by treating the symmetry breaking terms exactly @xcite .",
    "this approach in some sense combines the two conventional quantization schemes of the @xmath39 skyrmion . from the strange vector form factors ref .",
    "@xcite obtains @xmath83 and @xmath84 . in an extended skyrme model containing vector mesons , these values",
    "drop by about a factor of two in magnitude , and the sign of the strangeness radius changes @xcite .",
    "it is interesting that these results for nucleon sea quark distributions come from a model which describes quark physics rather indirectly in terms of meson fields .",
    "however , considerable theoretical uncertainties are associated with the skyrme model estimates of the strange form factors .",
    "besides the already mentioned ambiguities in the specific choice of lagrangian and @xmath39 extension , there are several additional problems .",
    "one serious concern is that the calculation of strange matrix elements in skyrme - like models ultimately involves the small difference of two large but uncertain quantities , and hence is intrinsically unreliable .",
    "the source of this difficulty is that the strange vector current , which in qcd is understood at the quark level , must be described in terms of the noether and topological currents in the skyrme picture .",
    "the strange current , in particular , is obtained from the relation of baryon number and hypercharge currents , eq .",
    "( [ strcurr ] ) : j_^s = j^b _ - j^y _ .",
    "[ sby ] thus , @xmath85 is given by @xmath86 . however ,",
    "both @xmath87 and @xmath88 are of order 1 @xmath89 so that their difference is almost an order of magnitude smaller than the two separately .",
    "the above  mentioned problem arises since quantities calculated in the skyrme model have a typical accuracy at the 30% level ( without introducing large numbers of parameters ) , which might even be expected from a model justified to leading order in a @xmath90 expansion , with @xmath91 .",
    "therefore , one concludes that the skyrme model can not accurately determine the strangeness radius to within several hundred percent , unless there are special reasons to believe that the errors in @xmath92 and @xmath93 are strongly correlated .",
    "however , it is hard to argue for correlations in the errors , since they come from very different parts of the model .",
    "the baryon current is of topological origin , and it is difficult to understand why it should `` know '' about errors in the hypercharge current , which is a noether current .",
    "there is also a more fundamental concern with the skyrme model calculation . the skyrme model , and the approximations used to treat it ,",
    "are generally believed to be justified in the large-@xmath94 limit of qcd ; effects of subleading contributions in @xmath90 are probably not reliable .",
    "this casts serious doubts on whether the skyrme model ( or any other large-@xmath94 model ) can ever make contact with strange matrix elements .",
    "after all , in a conventional treatment of the nucleon any strange quark matrix element must be ascribed to a zweig - rule violating amplitude .",
    "but , as argued by witten @xcite many years ago , zweig s rule is exact in the large-@xmath94 limit .",
    "apart from the question of whether the skyrme model can give reliable strange quark matrix elements in light of the need for zweig rule violations , there seems to be a paradox , since the approach of ref .",
    "@xcite continues to give nonzero strange matrix elements even as the parameters are pushed towards their @xmath95 values",
    ". how can the model give _ any _ nonzero strange matrix element in the limit as @xmath96 ?",
    "the resolution of this `` paradox '' is simple : since the nucleon is defined to be a member of the lowest @xmath97 octet with @xmath94 being any multiple of three , there are necessarily valence strange quarks in the nucleon for @xmath98 . to make a flavor octet out of @xmath94 quarks , one groups the quarks in triples of flavor singlets except for the last three , which are coupled to an octet .",
    "the key point is that each of these groups of three quarks in a singlet state contains one strange quark .",
    "thus , a nucleon with @xmath98 will contain @xmath99 valence strange quarks .",
    "a consequence of this fact is that the standard relation ( [ sby ] ) between hypercharge , baryon number and strangeness must be modified for @xmath100 : j_^s = j^b _ - j^y _ .",
    "[ sby2 ] given the net strangeness content of nucleons in the large @xmath94 world , there is no need for zweig rule violating amplitudes . indeed , as @xmath96 the number of valence strange quarks diverges : the nucleon becomes infinitely strange .",
    "this fact explains why the skyrme model can have nonzero strangeness matrix elements as @xmath96 .",
    "the resolution of this paradox does not , however , affect the general conclusion that the ability of the skyrme model to describe strange quark matrix elements in the nucleon is likely to be fundamentally limited , due to its large @xmath94 character . to describe our @xmath91 world in the skyrme model",
    ", one must start at the @xmath101 world and attempt to extrapolate back , with inherent uncertainities in the @xmath90 correction terms .",
    "this procedure may be quite sensible for some quantities , if the underlying physics is essentially similar in the @xmath102 and large @xmath94 worlds .",
    "it is likely to be problematic for strange quark matrix elements , however , since the character of the physics completely changes as @xmath94 goes from infinity down to three . at large @xmath94",
    "there are a large number of valence strange quarks and zweig s rule is exact , while at @xmath102 there are no valence strange quarks and the entire contribution is due to zweig rule violations .      in order to complement the pole and skyrme model calculations , musolf and burkardt @xcite estimated the strange vector matrix elements in yet another way , by considering the contributions arising from a @xmath103  @xmath19 loop .",
    "the heavier @xmath103  @xmath104 intermediate states have not been taken into account . as pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite , the corresponding couplings might , however , be significantly enhanced beyond their @xmath39 values , which could make this contribution relevant .",
    "in contrast to earlier attempts @xcite , the calculation of ref . @xcite uses the phenomenological meson - baryon form factors of the bonn potential @xcite to cut off the loop momentum and maintains gauge invariance via additional `` seagull '' vertices .",
    "the latter are generated from the bonn form factors by the minimal - substitution prescription .",
    "( for an alternative choice of these form factors see ref .",
    "the interaction of the strange vector current with the hadrons in the loop is treated as pointlike .",
    "the above model is very likely to be too simple to provide quantitative predictions , since _",
    "e.g. _ contributions from other but the lightest hadrons are not taken into account .",
    "however , the motivation of the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite was not so much to end up with quantitative predictions , but rather to explore and discuss qualitative features of loop contributions .",
    "the strange magnetic moment obtained in this approach lies in the range @xmath105 , dependent on the loop cutoff value , and is of about the same magnitude as the pole and skyrme model predictions .",
    "the sachs strangeness radius @xmath106 , however , has the sign opposite to the pole prediction , and its magnitude is smaller by a factor of 3 to 5 .    in the chiral limit , the strangeness radius develops an infrared divergence from the meson propagator in the loop integral .",
    "it is therefore very sensitive to the meson mass if the latter becomes small . the sachs radius , for example ,",
    "would be an order of magnitude larger if the pion would replace the kaon in the loop , as it does in meson cloud models for the isovector part of the electromagnetic form factors .",
    "the @xmath39 breaking effects are less pronounced for the magnetic moment , where the corresponding loop integrals are infrared finite .    finally , in the absence of an agreement under the current theoretical estimates for the sign of the strangeness radius , another feature of the kaon cloud picture",
    "should be stressed : it provides a simple and intuitive argument for the origin of the sign of @xmath27 . since the ( in our convention ) negative strangeness charge in the loop",
    "is carried by the kaon , which is less than half as heavy as the lambda and thus reaches out further from the common center of mass , it contributes dominantly to @xmath27 and determines its negative sign .",
    "this reasoning is analogous to the standard explanation for the negative sign of the electromagnetic charge radius of the neutron due to the negatively charged pion cloud .",
    "however , this static picture is , of course , oversimplified and neglects , in particular , recoil effects .",
    "the relevance of the latter can be seen in the dependence of the strangeness radii on the involved mass scales .",
    "the dirac strangeness charge radius , for example , becomes positive for pointlike kaons ( _ i.e. _ for large values of the cutoff mass in the meson - baryon form factors ) , whereas it stays negative if the kaon mass is replaced by the pion mass @xcite .      in this section",
    "we review our model for the strangeness form factors introduced in ref .",
    "it combines an intrinsic form factor , taken for definiteness from the kaon cloud model discussed above , with vector meson dominance ( vmd ) @xcite contributions and @xmath0 mixing .",
    "we are focusing in the present section on the basic ideas underlying this approach and will give more details , together with the calculation of the full form factors , in sec . iv .",
    "the vmd hypothesis can , in its most general form , be summarized in terms of current field identities ( cfi ) @xcite , which state the proportionality of the electromagnetic current and the field operators of light , neutral vector mesons with the same quantum numbers .",
    "the isocalar cfi has thus the general form j_^(i=0 ) = a _",

    "however , it was argued some time ago @xcite that the constituent quark picture can be generalized to accommodate a finite strangeness content . indeed ,",
    "if one regards a constituent quark as a qcd current quark surrounded by a complicated , nonperturbative cloud of gluons and @xmath139 pairs , then even up and down constituent quarks can have a strangeness distribution .",
    "of course , predictions of the nucleon s strangeness distribution in such constituent quark models have still to relate the strangeness content of the constituent quark to that of the nucleon .",
    "this is no simple task and generally requires the solution of a relativistic fadeev - type equation approximations used to derive the constituent quark propagators . ] .",
    "fortunately , however , the nucleon s strangeness sachs radius can be inferred exactly from that of the constituent quark without any specific calculation , and it is independent of the inter - quark dynamics . to see this , consider a system of three constituent quarks with strange charge distributions @xmath140 of identical shape , centered at ( in general time - dependent ) positions @xmath141 .",

    "the vector meson dominance mechanism , on the other hand , has a robust and largely generic character .",
    "it introduces no free parameters and does not leave much freedom in its implementation .",
    "in particular , however , it is based on phenomenologically successful physics which is well established from the electromagnetic interactions of hadrons .",
    "we further study the nucleon strangeness radius from the point of view of a class of constituent quark models in which the constituent quarks have an extended structure .",
    "the valence up and down quarks in the nucleon can then acquire an intrinsic strangeness distribution .",
    "we point out that the strangeness radius of the nucleon is model - independently given by the sum of the constituent quark radii , since their strangeness charge distribution is isotropic and since their overall strangeness is zero . for a quantitative estimate",
    "we employ the nambu - jona - lasinio model and find a 23 times smaller value than in the kaon - loop - vmd model with the opposite sign .    in order to put these results into perspective",
    ", we also review and discuss some of the other existing theoretical estimates . comparing the results for the strangeness radius and magnetic",
    "moment reveals in particular the large discrepancies between those predictions .",
    "both signs of the strangeness radius , for example , and values within a range of an order of magnitude have been found .",
    "clearly the theoretical uncertainties are at present not reliably under control and the existing results have to be regarded as order - of - magnitude estimates .",
    "this situation reflects both the size of the challenge with which the non - valence strangeness sector confronts existing hadron models , and our present lack of insight from the first principles of qcd .",
    "while first attempts to study the effects of disconnected quark loops on the lattice have been reported @xcite , it will still take considerable time and effort before reliable results for the strange quark content of the nucleon can be expected . in the meantime , however , the data from bates and cebaf will constrain the existing hadron models and test their underlying physics . it",
    "thus seems guaranteed that the subject will remain intriguing and challenging in the years to come .",
