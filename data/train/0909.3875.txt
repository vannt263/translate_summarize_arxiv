    "these regions are therefore emptied of asteroids over the age of the solar system , forming the well - known kirkwood gaps  @xcite .",
    "in addition to the well known low - order mean motion resonances with jupiter that form the kirkwood gaps , there are numerous weak resonances that cause long term orbital chaos and transport asteroids out of the main belt  @xcite . a very powerful secular resonance that occurs where the pericenter precession rate of an asteroid is nearly the same as that of one of the solar system s eigenfrequencies , the @xmath16 secular resonance , lies at the inner edge of the main belt  @xcite .",
    "the many resonances found throughout the main asteroid belt are largely responsible for maintaining the near earth asteroid ( nea ) population .",
    "non - gravitational forces , such as the yarkovsky effect , cause asteroids to drift in semimajor axis into chaotic resonances whence they can be lost from the main belt  @xcite .",
    "the yarkovsky effect is size - dependant , and therefore smaller asteroids are more mobile and are lost from the main belt more readily than larger ones .",
    "asteroids with @xmath17 have also undergone appreciable collisional evolution over the age of the solar system  @xcite , and collisional events can also inject fragments into chaotic resonances  @xcite .",
    "these processes ( collisional fragmentation and semimajor axis drift followed by injection into resonances ) have contributed to a quasi steady - state flux of small asteroids ( @xmath18 ) into the terrestrial planet region and are responsible for delivering the majority of terrestrial planet impactors over the last @xmath19  @xcite .    in contrast",
    ", most members of the population of @xmath20 asteroids have existed relatively unchanged , both physically and in orbital properties , since the time when the current dynamical architecture of the main asteroid belt was established : the yarkovsky drift is negligble and the mean collisional breakup time is @xmath21 for @xmath20 asteroids ; asteroids with diameters between @xmath22@xmath23 have been moderately altered by collisional and non - gravitational effects . however , as we show in the present work , the population of large asteroids ( @xmath24@xmath23 ) is also subject to weak chaotic evolution and escape from the main belt on gigayear timescales . by means of numerical simulations , we computed the loss history of large asteroids in the main belt .",
    "we also computed the cumulative impacts of large asteroids on the terrestrial planets over the last @xmath25 .",
    "our present study is additionally motivated by the need to understand better the origin of the present dynamical structure of the main asteroid belt .",
    "the orbital distribution of large asteroids that exist today was determined by dynamical processes in the early solar system .",
    "@xcite showed that large asteroids do not uniformly fill regions of the main belt that are stable over the age of the solar system .",
    "the jupiter - facing boundaries of some kirkwood gaps are more depleted than the sunward boundaries , and the inner asteroid belt is also more depleted than a model asteroid belt in which only gravitational perturbations arising from the planets in their current orbits have sculpted an initially uniform distribution of asteroids .",
    "@xcite showed that the pattern of depletion observed in the main asteroid belt is consistent with the effects of resonance sweeping due to giant planet migration that is thought to have occurred early in solar system history  @xcite , and that this event was the last major dynamical depletion event experienced by the main belt .",
    "the last major dynamical depletion event in the main asteroid belt likely coincided with the so - called late heavy bombardment ( lhb ) @xmath26 ago as indicated by the crater record of the inner planets and the moon  @xcite .",
    "knowledge about the distribution of the asteroids in the main belt just after that depletion event may help constrain models of that event . quantifying the dynamical loss rates from the asteroid belt also help us understand the history of large impacts on the terrestrial planets .",
    "motivated by these considerations , in this paper we explore the dynamical erosion of the main asteroid belt , which is the dominant mechanism by which large asteroids have been lost during the post - lhb history of the solar system .",
    "we have performed n - body simulations of large numbers of test particles in the main belt region for long periods of time ( @xmath8 and @xmath27 ) .",

    "finally , we discuss the implications of our results for the history of large asteroidal impacts on the terrestrial planets .",
    "our long term orbit integrations of the solar system used a parallelized implementation of a second - order mixed variable symplectic mapping known as the wisdom - holman method  @xcite , where only the massless test particles are parallelized and the massive planets are integrated in every computing node .",

    "the masses of mercury , venus , earth , and the moon were added to the mass of the sun .",
    "test particle asteroids were given eccentricity and inclination distributions similar to the observed main belt , but a uniform distribution in semimajor axis .",
    "the initial eccentricity distribution of the test particles was modeled as a gaussian with the peak at @xmath28 and a standard deviation of 0.07 , a lower cutoff at zero , and an upper cutoff above any value which would lead to either a mars or jupiter - crossing orbit , whichever was smaller .",
    "the initial inclination distribution was modeled as a gaussian with the peak @xmath29 and standard deviation of @xmath30 , and a lower cutoff at @xmath31 .",
    "the other initial orbital elements ( longitude of ascending node , longitude of perihelion , and mean anomaly ) were uniformly distributed .",

    "an integration step size of @xmath33 was used .",
    "particles were considered lost if they approached within a hill radius of a planet , or if they crossed either an inner boundary at @xmath34 or an outer boundary at @xmath35 .",
    "we define time @xmath36 as the epoch when the current dynamical architecture of the main asteroid belt and the major planets was established .",

    "* ) , and any early orbital migration of giant planets has finished  @xcite . at this epoch",
    "the main belt would have already had its eccentricity and inclination distributions excited by some primordial process , and its semimajor axis distribution shaped by early planet migration .",
    "therefore , the @xmath37 and @xmath38 distributions at @xmath36 likely resembled those of the present - day asteroid belt , although subsequent long - term evolution likely altered them somewhat from their primordial state .",
    "current understanding of planetary system formation suggests that the epoch prior to when we define @xmath36 could have been several million to several hundred million years subsequent to the formation of the first solids in the protoplanetary disk ; the first solids have radiometrically determined ages of @xmath39  @xcite .",

    "the slope of the loss rate on a log - linear scale changes rapidly between @xmath41@xmath4 until the second phase is reached , which lasts from @xmath4 until at least the end of sim  1 at @xmath8 . the slope of the loss rate on a log - linear scale continues to change during the second phase , but only over much longer timescales and by a much smaller amount than during the first phase .",
    "the particle removal times and particle fates ( whether they become inward - going mars - crossers , or outward - going jupiter - crossers ) for sim  2 are both shown in fig .",
    "[ f : cdist ] .",
    "we find that the particles that are lost during the initial @xmath4 ( the red to light - green points ) are generally those with high initial eccentricity , particles from the @xmath16 resonance ( appearing as a curving yellow band in the semimajor axis vs. inclination plot ) , and particles in the strongly chaotic mean motion resonances with jupiter ( the kirkwood gaps ) .",
    "these maps are similar to those produced by @xcite , however their maps were coded by spectral number ( more chaotic orbits having a larger spectral number ) using @xmath42 integrations .",
    "the apparent rapid change in slope around @xmath43@xmath44 years is likely due mostly to the emptying of asteroids from the @xmath16 resonance region ( see also the upper right - hand panel of fig .  [",
    "f : cdist ] ) . also , in the outer asteroid belt the sheer proximity to jupiter and the resulting strong short - term perturbations cause particles to be lost very rapidly .",
    "many of these regions may never have accumulated asteroids , and therefore the loss of these particles represents a numerical artifact in our simulation due to over - filling the model asteroid belt with test particles . for instance , if the asteroid belt formed with the giant planets in their current positions , those regions would always have been unstable to asteroids , so none could have formed there .",

    "the main belt is observationally complete for asteroid absolute magnitudes as faint as @xmath54  @xcite .",
    "while most @xmath32 asteroids have existed relatively unchanged over the last @xmath8 , a few breakup events have created some large fragments over this timespan .",
    "for example , there are five members of the vesta family with @xmath55  @xcite .",
    "collisional fragments produced over the last @xmath8 can `` contaminate '' the observed @xmath32 asteroid population , and collisional breakup events have also disrupted some primordial @xmath32 asteroids .",
    "these collisional processes complicate the estimate of the dynamical loss history of large asteroids over the age of the solar system .",
    "happily , most collisional family members with @xmath32 have been identified  @xcite , and can be removed to further refine the observation sample .",

    "another possibility is that large asteroid breakup events ( followed by fragment transport via the yarkovsky effect to resonances ) dominate the production of large craters .",
    "our model neglects breakup events which have produced numerous @xmath101 fragments over the last @xmath8 , and breakup events near resonances with earth - impact probabilities higher than that of the intrinsic main belt may contribute to the large basin impact rate .",
    "this is similar to the hypothesis proposed by @xcite for the origin of the chicxulub impactor from the baptistina family - forming event .",
    "the baptistina breakup is hypothesized to have involved two large asteroids ( @xmath138 and @xmath139 ) that collided at a semimajor axis distance @xmath140 from two overlapping weak resonances that , combined , increased fragment eccentricities to planet - crossing orbits with a @xmath141 earth - impact probability  @xcite .",
    "it is unclear whether such fortuitous combinations of conditions occur often enough to dominate the production of large craters over the solar system s history since the end of the lhb .",
    "large family forming breakup events do occur in the asteroid belt , and they likely can increase the flux of impacts onto the terrestrial planets  @xcite . the flora family breakup event in particular was large and occurred in the inner asteroid belt roughly @xmath83@xmath128 ago  @xcite . also , while the yarkovsky effect is very weak for @xmath13 asteroids , it is not entirely negligible over the age of the solar system .",
    "for instance , the loss rate of @xmath142 from the inner asteroid belt is somewhat higher when the yarkovsky effect is taken into account compared to when it is not  @xcite .",
    "it is doubtful whether this modest difference can account for a factor of ten increase in the flux of @xmath13 objects in the terrestrial planet region , however additional modeling may be needed to confirm this .",
    "in addition , the weakness of the yarkovsky effect on large asteroids can paradoxically enhance their mobility in the inner main belt .",
    "combinations of nonlinear secular resonances and weak three - body resonances may cause asteroids to slowly diffuse through the middle and inner main belt  @xcite . only large asteroids that are only weakly affected by the yarkovsky effect can remain inside these resonances long enough for them to act .",
    "finally , we consider the contribution from high velocity impactors with @xmath143 to the large impact crater production rate .",
    "the velocity distributions of asteroid impacts on the terrestrial planets have significant high velocity tails , as seen in fig .",
    "[ f : cehistory - impacts ] . because size distributions of asteroids follow a power law with a negative index , as in eq .",
    "( [ e : sfd ] ) , smaller objects are more numerous than larger ones .",
    "we calculated the relative contribution of impacts by objects of varying sizes on the production of craters of a given size . using eqs .",
    "( [ e : piscale ] ) and ( [ e : transient2final ] ) , a @xmath142 projectile striking the earth at @xmath144 produces a crater with a final diameter @xmath145 , assuming target and projectile densities are both @xmath93 , and the impact occurs at a @xmath146 angle .",
    "we solved for the projectile size needed to produce a @xmath145 crater while varying the impact velocity .",
    "the result was used to transform the earth impact velocity distribution from fig .",
    "[ f : cehistory - impacts ] into a projectile size distribution for a fixed final crater diameter .",
    "finally we multiplied the binned projectile size distribution by a binned asteroid size distribution , using a cumulative distribution as in eq .",
    "( [ e : sfd ] ) with an index @xmath106 .",
    "the result was then turned into a cumulative distribution and normalized to @xmath147 , and is plotted in fig .",
    "[ f : vdist ] .",
    "this plot shows that asteroids with @xmath143 that impact at high velocity increase the production of large craters by no more than a factor of two .",
    "therefore @xmath143 asteroids impacting at high velocity can not account for the order of magnitude difference in the production rate of large impact craters on the earth between our model and the npf .",
    "on very ancient terrains , the discrepancy between total number of accumulated craters estimated from our model compared with the constant - flux models used in crater chronologies is less than with younger surfaces , as illustrated by fig .",
    "[ f : num_basins]b .",
    "our model also can not account for the lhb itself .",
    "total accumulated craters on ancient heavily cratered terrains associated with the lhb are at least @xmath5@xmath148 times higher than on younger terrains  @xcite , and likely even more if the surfaces reached equilibrium cratering .",
    "the impact flux during the lhb was at least two orders of magnitude higher than the average flux over the last @xmath149 , and possibly three orders of magnitude more if the lhb was a short - lived event  @xcite .",
    "even with the more enhanced rate of impacts at early times , and assuming higher earth impact probabilities of @xmath150 based on estimates from the @xmath16 resonance , the impact flux due to dynamical erosion is roughly one or two orders of magnitude lower than that needed to produce the heavily cratered terrains associated with the lhb  @xcite .",
    "the main asteroid belt has unstable zones associated with strong orbital resonances with jupiter and saturn and relatively stable zones elsewhere . in most of the strongly unstable zones ,",
    "the timescale for asteroid removal is @xmath151 myr ; one exception is the 2:1 mean motion resonance with jupiter where the timescale to empty this resonance approaches a gigayear .",
    "the relatively stable zones also lose asteroids by means of weak dynamical chaos on long timescales .",
    "we have found that the dynamical loss of test particles from the main asteroid belt as a whole is best described as a piecewise logarithmic decay .",
    "a piecewise logarithmic decay law implies that the intrinsic loss rate from the asteroid belt decays inversely proportional to time , @xmath75 , but with different proportionality constants for different regions inside the belt .",
    "when a region with a particular decay rate empties of asteroids , the decay law for the entire asteroid belt undergoes a change in slope .",
    "this logarithmic loss of asteroids due to dynamical chaos was established very soon after the current dynamical architecture of the asteroid belt was established , and it continues to the present day with very little deviation .",
    "dynamical chaos is the predominant mechanism for the loss of large asteroids , @xmath2430 km .",
    "we have calculated that the asteroid belt @xmath4 after the establishment of the current dynamical architecture of the solar system had roughly twice its present number of large asteroids . because their loss rate is inversely proportional to time",
    ", we estimate that the flux of large impactors has declined by a factor of 3 over the last @xmath12 .",
    "we have calculated that large asteroidal impactors originating across the main asteroid belt have an overall earth impact probability of @xmath152 , and that the number of impacts of @xmath13 asteroids on earth is only @xmath153 .",
    "our result on the current impact flux of @xmath13 asteroids due to dynamical erosion of the asteroid belt is an order of magnitude less than the values adopted in the recent literature on crater chronology and impact hazard assessment .",
    "we have evaluated several possible explanations for the discrepancy and find them inadequate .",
    "our results can be used to improve studies of large impacts on the terrestrial planets .",
    "appendix    [ sec : asteroid_loss - appendix - optbinsize ] when presenting data as a histogram , the problem of what bin size to choose arises . in the literature ,",
    "the choice of bin size is often ad hoc , but need not be so . in the case of the asteroid belt ,",
    "we wish to analyze the semimajor axis distribution of asteroids in order to gain insight into its past dynamical history .",
    "if we choose a bin size that is too small , stochastic variation between bins can mask important underlying variations in the orbital element distributions .",
    "if we choose a bin size that is too large , important small - scale variations become lost ( i.e. the variability near narrow kirkwood gaps ) . in this work ,",
    "we use histogram bin size optimizer developed by  @xcite for optimizing time - series data with variability that obeys poisson statistics .",
    "this method is intuitive and easy to implement , and can be generalized to the problem of the number distribution of asteroids as a function of semimajor axis .",
    "the optimal bin size is found by minimizing a cost function defined as : @xmath154 where the data have been divided into @xmath155 bins of size @xmath156 , @xmath157 is the mean of the number of asteroids per unit bin , and @xmath158 is the variance .",
    "the mean is @xmath159 and the variance is @xmath160 the method works by assuming that the number of occurrences ( or in our case , the number of asteroids ) , @xmath157 , in each bin obeys a poisson distribution such that the variance of @xmath157 is equal to the mean .",
