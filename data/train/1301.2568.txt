    "with recent progress in studies of ultracold fermi superfluids undergoing bcs - bose einstein condensation ( bec ) crossover has come a focus on generalized spin and charge susceptibilities ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite for an introduction ) .",
    "these in turn relate to the compressibility and spin susceptibility in the linear response regime . while strict bcs theory is well known to lead to fully consistent results for linear response ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a review ) , arriving at a generalization to address the entire crossover is a major challenge .",
    "the difficulty is to construct such theories as to be fully compatible with @xmath2-sum and compressibility - sum rules which reflect conservation principles .",
    "although there have been some successes there are nevertheless important failures , as we will address here .    in this paper , we discuss these challenges in the context of fermionic superfluids .",
    "we present examples of theoretical approaches which are fully consistent with @xmath2-sum and compressibility - sum rules . to our knowledge",
    "there are two such theories beyond strict bcs theory and we discuss both here .",
    "the first of these involves a mean - field approach to bcs - bec crossover .",
    "here we avoid the complexities associated with pair fluctuation or pseudogap effects @xcite .",
    "the second of these involves an investigation of the normal phase which includes pairing fluctuations at the simplest level . in this context",
    "we address nozieres and schmitt - rink ( nsr ) @xcite theory .",
    "we demonstrate that gauge invariance and sum rules can be made compatible with a linear response scheme .",
    "importantly , however , this linear response theory is unphysical in that it predicts a divergent compressibility when approaching the superfluid transition temperature from above .",
    "this observation should underline the point noted above that a treatment of linear response functions in fermionic superfluids ( and many - body systems overall ) is full of pitfalls .    indeed , for a general many - body theory , as summarized in ref .",
    "@xcite , it is difficult to obtain the same result for the compressibility via the derivatives of thermodynamic quantities as compared with that via the two - particle correlation functions .",
    "this issue has been extensively discussed for random - phase approximation ( rpa ) and rpa - generalizations of the electron gas @xcite as well as in quantum hall systems @xcite . from this literature",
    ", it appears that when the two approaches for the compressibility disagree , the more trustworthy scheme @xcite is the thermodynamical approach . in many ways",
    "more complex are the response functions of bcs theory which from the very beginning @xcite revealed difficulties associated with incorporating charge conservation and gauge invariance in the broken - symmetry phase .    in a related fashion",
    "we note that there are considerable discussions about where and when collective mode contributions ( which in neutral systems are phonon - like ) associated with the fluctuations of the order parameter enter into the electromagnetic response and related transport of fermionic superfluids .",
    "these phononic modes are central to the bosonic superfluids . because correlation functions ( and related transport coefficients ) are constrained by sum rules , one is not free to incorporate these collective modes in an arbitrary fashion . in this paper",
    "we discuss in some detail how these collective modes appear in a theory respecting conservation laws .",
    "we will show that in the process of maintaining gauge invariance one must self - consistently calculate the collective mode spectrum .",
    "the usual phonons , which appear as density waves above the transition , are below @xmath0 strongly entangled with the phase and ( in general ) amplitude modes of the order parameter .",
    "indeed , it appears that in the bcs superconductivity literature ( including helium-3 as the neutral counterpart ) , phonons do not contribute to transport properties associated with the transverse correlation functions .",
    "this includes the conductivity , and shear viscosity .",
    "a consequence of this body of work based on kinetic theory as well as kubo - based systematic studies approaches @xcite is that the normal fluid or condensate excitations involve only the fermionic quasi - particles . in superfluid",
    "helium-3 , as well , the normal fluid contributions to thermodynamics reflect only the fermionic quasi - particles .",
    "this brings us to the possibility that the situation is different for strong coupling superfluids in the sense of bcs - bec crossover .",
    "work by our group showed that within a generalized bcs - like description the sum rules are satisfied without including collective mode excitations contributing to the normal fluid density @xcite .",
    "but there may be alternative theories where at strong coupling the sound waves are important in this transport .",
    "indeed it has been argued @xcite that these sound mode contributions are important in the thermodynamics at unitarity , but it should be noted that they were similarly invoked in the bcs regime , in a manner which does not appear consistent with theory and experiment on superfluid helium-3 @xcite .",
    "closely related to the charge and spin susceptibility are the dynamical charge ( @xmath3 ) and spin ( @xmath4 ) structure factors : @xmath5 .",
    "they are formally connected to the charge and spin response functions by the fluctuation - dissipation theorem @xcite . in a proper theory , the conservation laws both for charge and spin yield well known sum rule constraints on @xmath5 . in recent literature",
    "there has been an emphasis on these structure factors @xcite , in part because they can be directly measured via two photon bragg experiments and in part , because they are thought to reflect on an important parameter for the unitary gases : the so - called  contact parameter \" .    in this context",
    "it has proved convenient to define @xmath6.\\ ] ] it should be noted that in the literature @xcite there is a tendency to decompose these spin and charge structure factors into separate spin components so that the density ( or spin ) response is related to correlation functions of the form @xmath7 [ \\rho_{\\uparrow } \\pm \\rho_{\\downarrow } ] >",

    "the difference structure factor @xmath12 is frequently associated with density correlations of the form @xmath13 .",
    "this association derives from assuming that all diagrams for the spin and charge response are equivalent and given by the same combinations of charge density commutators ( with only simple sign changes ) involving @xmath14 .",
    "we emphasize in this paper that this is specifically not the case below @xmath0 as a result of collective mode effects which only couple to the density response function but decouple from the spin response function .",
    "@xcite clearly demonstrates this difference for strict bcs theory .",
    "moreover , it needs not generally hold when there is a different class of diagrams required above @xmath0 in the spin and charge channels to insure the @xmath2-sum rules . while these crucial collective mode effects are sometimes inadvertently omitted @xcite in analyzing density - density correlation functions , they are essential for satisfying the longitudinal @xmath2-sum rule",
    ".    of interest is a claim in ref .",
    "@xcite that the static structure factor ( which involves an integral over all frequencies ) at large wavevector measures the so - called contact parameter .",
    "a rather different observation was made by son and thompson @xcite who showed that _ it is the high frequency , large wavevector structure factor which is associated with the contact_. more precisely , son and thompson @xcite investigated the relation between the structure factor and the contact interaction noting how delicate this issue is and that  care should be taken not to violate conservation laws \" .",
    "this is the philosophy at the core of the present paper .",
    "we begin our discussion of linear response theory with the fundamental hamiltonian for a two - component fermi gas interacting via contact interactions @xmath15 we assume the interaction is attractive and @xmath16 is the bare coupling constant . here",
    "we adopt the convention @xmath17 and the metric tensor @xmath18 is a diagonal matrix with the elements @xmath19 .",

    "here we set up an approach which we refer to as the consistent fluctuation of the order parameter ( or cfop ) theory .",
    "importantly , here , in contrast to the approach of nambu @xcite the changes in the phase and amplitude of the order parameter associated with the external fields enter as additional components of the perturbation theory .",

    "( [ rhs ] ) , one can see that the @xmath39-limit ward identity holds for bcs theory only when @xmath110 the left hand side can be evaluated by differentiating both sides of the gap equation @xmath111 with respect to @xmath112 .",
    "@xmath113 by using the expressions of the response functions given in the appendix , one can show that @xmath114 thus the @xmath39-limit ward identity is respected , which then guarantees the compressibility sum rule .",
    "it is of interest to address why an rpa - based approach usually fails to satisfy the compressibility sum rule @xcite . in the rpa approach ,",
    "one starts with the expression of the density susceptibility called @xmath115 from thermodynamics or from a simpler model . by introducing a summation over a series of bubble diagrams",
    ", the rpa approach leads to the expression @xmath116 $ ] , where @xmath117 is a combination of the coupling constant representing bubble diagrams and the combinatoric factors for counting the series @xcite . for finite values of @xmath115 and @xmath117 , the rpa result always differs from @xmath115 and this makes it particularly difficult to satisfy the compressibility sum rule , which requires a consistent expression for @xmath118 .",
    "we make the important observation that the arguments presented above for the self consistency of linear response in strict bcs theory can be readily extended to treat bcs - bec crossover theory _ at the mean field level_. this level is , of course , not fully adequate because it does not include fluctuations associated with non - condensed pairs .",
    "nevertheless , it does provide an example of a fully sum - rule consistent approach to linear response in fermionic superfluids .    at this mean field level",
    ", the number density and the order parameter in equilibrium can be written as a function of temperature in terms of the equations    @xmath119 , \\quad \\frac{1}{g}&=&\\sum_{\\mathbf{p}}\\frac{1 - 2f(e_{\\mathbf{p}})}{2e_{\\mathbf{p } } } .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    because we contemplate arbitrary chemical potentials away from the bcs regime where @xmath120 , this theory applies to the whole bcs - bec crossover regime .",
    "important here is the introduction of the two body scattering length @xmath121 via a renormalization of the coupling constant @xcite @xmath122 where @xmath121 is the @xmath123-wave scattering length and @xmath124 . in the bcs limit , @xmath125 , @xmath126 and @xmath127 where @xmath128 is the fermi energy . while in the deep bec regime , @xmath129 , @xmath130 and @xmath131 .     is the fermi temperature .",

    "this is particularly problematic because of the difficulty of finding the same answer as found from thermodynamics .",
    "it is of considerable interest , then , to establish the form of the compressibility in a theory with full ( compressibility ) sum rule compatibility . at the mean field level",
    "the behavior above the transition temperature is that of a free fermi gas .",
    "below @xmath0 , the compressibility either via thermodynamics or via the two body density density response leads to @xmath135 where @xmath136 .",
    "fig.[fig : c ] plots the compressibility @xmath1 as a function of temperature for @xmath137 ( on the bcs side ) , @xmath138 ( the unitary point ) , and @xmath139 ( on the bec side ) .",
    "the figure exhibits an expected thermodynamic signature of a phase transition , appearing as a discontinuity in the compressibility at @xmath0 .",
    "the discontinuity in @xmath1 at @xmath0 can be traced back to the appearance of collective - mode term @xmath140 which sets in below @xmath0 and is absent in the normal state .",
    "it should be noted that at @xmath0 , @xmath140 is finite only when @xmath105 . when @xmath141 approaches but does not equal @xmath138 , we have @xmath142 at @xmath0 . in this way",
    "@xmath140 is not analytic at @xmath105 .",
    "additional properties of the bcs to bec crossover can be analyzed similarly .",
    "for example , in appendix  [ app : b ] we analytically evaluate the @xmath133 density structure factor in the bcs and bec limits . here",
    "one sees that at @xmath133 the density structure factor for low frequency and momentum is dominated by the gapless collective mode .",
    "as one crosses from bcs to bec , this mode appears as the usual sound mode of bcs theory and evolves continuously into the bogoliubov mode and eventually to the free bosonic dispersion in the bec regime .",
    "one can similarly address the spin response functions following , for example the derivation in ref .",
    "importantly , the collective modes appear only in the density response and do not couple to the spin response functions .",
    "this supports the discussion given in the introduction that any algebra involving both the density and spin response functions which decomposes these functions into separate @xmath143 and @xmath144 contributions ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq : decomp ] ) ) is generally problematic , except in the absence of interactions .",
    "such algebraic manipulations are not possible when the diagram sets in different channels are not the same .",
    "we now turn to the compressibility in a theory ( of the normal phase ) which includes pair correlations .",
    "it is notable that here too , one finds consistency with the usual ward ( and @xmath39-limit ward ) identities , providing one restricts consideration to the theory originally introduced by nozieres and schmitt - rink @xcite for the normal phase only .",
    "the nsr paper was among the first to emphasize the importance of treating pair correlations in the normal phase .",
    "indeed these were discussed along with an analysis of the ground state considered here and introduced by leggett @xcite and eagles @xcite .",
    "interestingly , theories which incorporate correlated pairs which are based on this nsr scheme do _ not _ appear to relate to the bcs - leggett ground state @xcite .",
    "this is , in part a reflection of the rather ubiquitous first order transition associated with extending nsr theory below @xmath0 .",
    "our group @xcite has extensively discussed one approach which appears ( rather uniquely ) to lead to a second order transition from a different ( as compared to nsr ) normal phase into this well known ground state .",
    "however , it is more complicated than the nsr theory , and the related compressibility will be presented elsewhere .    here , in order to illustrate a fully consistent approach to linear response in the normal phase ( beyond that of a noninteracting fermi gas ) we use the simpler nsr scheme . even though it has been improved and reviewed many times ( see refs .",
    "@xcite for reviews ) , a full discussion on the linear response theory within nsr theory is still lacking . in a previous publication @xcite we have shown that by carefully choosing a set of diagrams for the vertex function , the nsr theory respects the usual ward identity associated with gauge invariance . here",
    "we will show that the compressibility derived from this vertex function also satisfies the compressibility sum rule .",
    "we begin with a brief review of the nsr theory and its linear response theory .",
    "the self energy is @xmath145 with @xmath146 $ ] being the @xmath147-matrix in which @xmath148 is the pair susceptibility .",
    "the number equation is given by @xmath149 while an approximate number equation was implemented in the original nsr paper @xcite .",
    "the response function may also be written formally as @xmath150 where the full em vertex function @xmath20 must obey the ward identity ( [ iwi ] ) so that @xmath37 . the correction to the full vertex function",

    "thus the @xmath39-limit wi is satisfied by the linear response theory of the nsr theory . as a consequence , the compressibility sum rule is satisfied by this linear response theory .",
    "we emphasize that these two constraints ( the @xmath39-limit ward identity and the ward identity ) are independent constraints @xcite .",
    "these observations should be contrasted with the hartree - fock as well as the rpa approximations reviewed in ref .",

    "the @xmath147-matrix resides in the denominator of @xmath163 so its divergence at @xmath0 does not introduce difficulties . however , if one calculates @xmath164 or equivalently calculates the mt and al diagrams , those expressions explicitly contain @xmath165 in the numerator . in nsr theory",
    ", we have @xmath166 .",
    "due to the thouless criterion , @xmath167 for small @xmath168 when @xmath169",
    ". then the @xmath168 integral behaves like @xmath170 which is divergent at @xmath171 .",
    "there have been attempts to remove this divergence by including effective boson - boson interactions @xcite , but there has been no demonstration that gauge invariance and conservation laws are respected @xcite when these repairs are made .",
    "one can identify more generally the problematic aspect of nsr theory .",
    "in this simplest pairing fluctuation scheme , where the @xmath147-matrix contains only bare green s functions , the fermionic chemical potential @xmath112 is effectively the only parameter in the theory .",
    "once dressed green s functions are introduced , it becomes possible to avoid this type of divergence . at the same time , of course , it becomes more difficult to establish consistency with gauge invariance and the compressibility sum rule .",
    "given that the compressibility sum rule is rarely satisfied ( the exceptions being the two examples discussed in this paper ) , one has a choice for how to approach a calculation of the compressibility .",
    "we emphasize that from the literature it appears that the more credible results for the compressibility arise @xcite via the thermodynamic rather than the two body correlation functions .",
    "linear response theories have been an important tool for studying transport and dynamic properties of superfluid and related many - particle systems .",
    "the current focus in the literature on ultracold fermi superfluids , particularly at unitarity , provided a primary motivation for our work which aimed to organize this subject matter and clarify the constraints that calibrate a linear response theory .",
    "we have seen that the challenge is to construct such theories as to be fully compatible with @xmath2-sum and compressibility - sum rules which reflect conservation principles .",
    "although there have been some successes there are nevertheless important failures .    in this paper we presented two nearly unique examples of fermionic superfluids which are demonstrably consistent with @xmath2-sum and compressibility - sum rules .",
    "we addressed these theories via the compressibility @xmath1 .",
