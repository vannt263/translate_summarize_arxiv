    "since drinfeld @xcite proposed the quantum groups and yangian algebras as deformations of the universal envoloping algebras of the classical lie algebras , hopf algebras with nontrivial coalgebra structure , especially @xmath6-affine algebras @xcite and yangian doubles @xcite , have become one of the major subjects of pure and applied algebra studies .",
    "recent progress in the study of hopf algebras and applications include the free boson representations of @xmath6-affine algebras and yangian doubles at higher level @xcite and the possibility of describing the dynamical symmetries and solving the correlation functions of certain solvable lattice statistic models and integrable quantum field theories within a pure algebraic framework @xcite .",
    "the latter problem is , if not the sole force , among the driving forces which lead to the studies of deformed algebras beyond hopf algebras .",
    "examples of such deformed algebras are @xmath6- @xcite and @xmath7- @xcite deformed virasoro and @xmath8 algebras , the elliptic algebra @xmath9@xcite and its scaling limit @xmath2@xcite , and the algebra of screening operators of the @xmath6-deformed @xmath8-algebras @xcite and so on .    in this paper",
    "we extend the recent work of s.khoroshkin , d.lebedev and s.pakuliak @xcite on the scaling algebra @xmath2of the elliptic algebra @xmath9to the general case , @xmath0 , where @xmath1 can be any classical simply - laced lie algebra of any admissible rank .",
    "the algebra @xmath2introduced in @xcite is a formal algebra with generators carrying _ continuous _ indices .",
    "one of the principal motivation of @xcite was to establish a better understanding of the algebra @xmath9from the representation theoretic point of view because the representation theory of @xmath9has been rather obscure since its birth @xcite .",
    "for this the authors of @xcite considered the scaling limit , @xmath2 , instead of @xmath9itself , with generating functions being analytic along some strip  which plays the role of fundamental parallelogram for the elliptic algebra @xmath9in the complex plane .",
    "the algebra @xmath2turns out to be _ not _ a hopf algebra but belongs to a hopf family of algebras in which the comultiplication can be made associative but with the sacrifice of changing the periods of structure functions for different iterations of the comultiplication .",
    "moreover the twisted intertwining operators appeared in the representation theory of the algebra @xmath2satisfy a familar set of commutation relations which were used in the calculation of correlation functions for sine - gordon model .",
    "we shall show that the algebra @xmath2actually belongs to ( and constitutes the simplest example of ) a new type of deformed affine algebras , @xmath0 . just like their simplest representative , @xmath2 ,",
    "these new deformed affine algebras are not hopf algebras , because the second deformation parameter @xmath10 spoils the usual hopf algebra structure . however , for two reasons we regard them as _ deformations _ of the usual hopf algebras .",
    "first , as the second deformation parameter @xmath10 approaches zero , the currents for the algebra @xmath0obey the same commutation relations as that of the yangian double with center @xmath11 ; second , if we consider the level zero representation of @xmath0 , the algebraic relations become hopf algebra again .    due to the complication for the case of general @xmath1",
    ", we pertain ourselves only in the current realization . in this form",
    ", it is not easy to write down the analog of comultiplication used by klp @xcite .",
    "we therefore use an analog of the well - known drinfeld comultiplication to study some aspects in the structure of our algebra .",
    "it is , however , not known whether the finite hopf family structure of klp can be realizad using this form of comultiplication .",
    "to cercomevent this drawback , we introduce an alternative notion , which we call the infinite hopf family of algebras , to write down the interations of comultiplications in a convenient form .",
    "it turns out that this new notion leads to an astonishing simple realization of our algebra at any positive integer level .    besides the pure algebraic elegance",
    ", our algebras are also expected to have relevant applications in such fields as to develop an algebraic formulation of quantum symmetry and the calculation of correlation functions for affine toda field theories .",
    "we begin our study by introducing the formal current algebra ( denoted also by the symbol @xmath0 ) associated with @xmath0 .",
    "the special case of @xmath12 can be inferred from @xcite . for other simply - laced classical lie algebras @xmath1 , the following",
    "definition is , to our knowledge , not introduced anywhere else .",
    "the current algebra @xmath0associated with the classical simply - laced lie algebra @xmath1 of rank @xmath13 ( as an associative algebra with unit over the field @xmath14 ) is generated by the @xmath15 currents @xmath16 , the central element @xmath17 and 1 with the following generating relations : of the current operators take integer values , which indicate different root directions of the underlying lie algebra @xmath1 , whilst the symbol @xmath18 preceding the @xmath7 s in the structure functions are square root of @xmath19 .",
    "]    @xmath20      _ where @xmath22 etc .",
    "are spectral parameters , real @xmath7 , @xmath10 are two deformation parameters , @xmath23 , @xmath24 are matrix elements of the cartan matrix for the lie algebra @xmath1 , and _ and @xmath7 are generic , i.e. @xmath7 is not a rational multiple of @xmath10 . ]",
    "@xmath25    for @xmath26 , the above current algebra reduces to the current realization of @xmath2 , where the serre - like relations ( [ serr1]-[serr2 ] ) are not present .    in the limit @xmath27",
    ", the current algebra @xmath0would have the same form as that of the yangian double @xmath28 .",
    "but the limiting algebra @xmath29should not be considered to be isomorphic with the yangian double @xmath28 because the element of the algebra @xmath29carries a _ continuous _ index whilst that of the yangian double @xmath28 carries discrete one . for @xmath12 , see @xcite for more information on this point .    to have a precise definition for the algebra @xmath0(and _ not _ its current realization form ) , we have to consider two different cases as did in ref.@xcite for @xmath30 case : 1 ) the case @xmath31 and 2 ) the case @xmath32 . in the first case one",
    "should consider the currents @xmath33 as the following fourier transforms of the actual elements @xmath34 and @xmath35 ( @xmath36 ) of the algebra @xmath0 ,    @xmath37    whereas in the second case , the currents @xmath38 should be given another expression in terms of the actual elements @xmath39 of @xmath0at @xmath32 ,    @xmath40    the difference between the cases for @xmath41 and @xmath32 can be summarized in a more compact relationship between the algebra generators @xmath42 and @xmath39 .",
    "in fact , from the two expressions of @xmath38 , we can write down the following relation at @xmath32 ,    @xmath43    therefore , in the limit @xmath44 , @xmath45 is well - defined but @xmath46 tend to infinity . on the contrary , when @xmath41 , @xmath46 is well - defined and @xmath45 tends to zero .",
    "given the above fourier transformations , one can in principle write down the generating relations for the algebra @xmath0 in terms of the continuous generators @xmath47 . however , such relations are rather complicated and they are of no use in the rest of this paper",
    ". therefore we shall omit such relations and consider only the _ current realization _ ( [ currb]-[curre ] ) of the algebra @xmath0 .",
    "unlike the usual @xmath6-affine algebras and the yangian doubles , the algebra under consideration is _ not _ a hopf algebra . recall that a hopf algebra @xmath48 is an algebra endowed with five operations :    * the algebra multiplication @xmath49 ; * the unit embedding @xmath50 , @xmath51 ,  @xmath52 ,  @xmath53 is the unit element ; * comultiplication @xmath54 ; * the antipode @xmath55 ;    and    * the counit @xmath56 , @xmath57 .    to make the algebra @xmath48 into a hopf algebra , these structures have to obey the following axioms ,    @xmath58    for our algebra @xmath0 , only the first of these axioms holds , which ensures the associativity of the algebra multiplication .",
    "the operations @xmath59 can not be defined on the algebra @xmath0alone . however , as first discovered in ref.@xcite , a well - defined coproduct can be defined over the so - called `` hopf family of algebras '' containing a finite number of algebras of the kind @xmath2but with different parameters @xmath10 . however , as stated in the introduction , the case for arbitrary @xmath1 is much more complicated and we can only make our analysis in the current realization .",
    "this difficulty prevented us from obtaining an analog structure of klp s hopf family of algebras because the analogous comultiplication is not known .",
    "therefore we proceed to introduce an alternative notion  the infinite hopf family of algebras .",
    "it should be remarked that no relationship is implied here between our infinite hopf family of algebras and the ( finite ) hopf family of algebras introduced by klp .",
    "let @xmath60 be a family of associative algebras with unit defined over @xmath14 .",
    "if on each @xmath61 one can define the following operations    * the comultiplications @xmath62 and @xmath63 , where @xmath64 and @xmath65 are algebra morphisms ; * the counits @xmath66 ; * the antipodes @xmath67 , which are algebra anti - morphisms ,    and if they satisfy the following constraints ,    @xmath68    where @xmath69 is the algebra multiplication for the @xmath70-th component algebra @xmath61 , then we call the family of algebras @xmath71 an infinite hopf family of algebras .    a trivial example for",
    "the infinite hopf family of algebras is the family @xmath72 in which @xmath48 is a usual hopf algebra . in this case ,",
    "all our axioms ( [ axb]-[axe ] ) hold with the comultiplications @xmath73 , counits @xmath74 and the antipodes @xmath75 being identified with those corresponding structures for the usual hopf algebra .",
    "notice that in this trivial case , we have one more axiom , eq.([del2 ] ) , which represents the coassociativity of the comultiplication . for general cases no coassociativity is required .",
    "one may consider the lost of coassociativity in our infinite hopf family of algebras a serious drawback compared to the ( finite ) hopf family structure of @xcite .",
    "however it will soon be clear in preposition 2 that this structure would bring about a great advantage in obtaining realizations of our algebra at integer levels @xmath76 .",
    "now we proceed to construct a nontrivial example for the infinite hopf family of algebras containing our algebra @xmath0as a member .",
    "let @xmath77 .",
    "for all @xmath78 , let us define @xmath79 recursively such that    @xmath80    where @xmath81 are a set of parameters and @xmath82 , the center of our algebra @xmath0 .",
    "clearly , for @xmath83 , we have @xmath84 . the notations",

    "the proof for this proposition is straightforward .",
    "notice that in this example the comultiplications @xmath92 are not all independent .",
    "a simple observation would show that    @xmath93    two more remarks are in due course .    in the case of @xmath94 for all @xmath95 ,",
    "the infinite hopf family of algebras become trivial again because there are no differences between the algebras @xmath96 and @xmath97 for any pair of @xmath98 .    under the cases of remarks 2 and 3 , the above structures for the infinite hopf family of algebras reduce to the original hopf algebra structure . in particular , under the case of remark 2 , the comultiplications would have the same form with the so - called drinfeld comultiplication for the yangian double .",
    "the comultiplications introduced above are useful not only in clarifying the structure of the infinite hopf family of algebras but also in the representation theory of the representative algebra @xmath0 . before going into detailed structure of representations , we state the following proposition , which can be directly verified .",

    "actually , the above proposition states that the images of the generating currents @xmath105 and @xmath106 of @xmath85 under @xmath92 satisfy the defining relations for @xmath101 and @xmath104 respectively .",
    "this result is quite astonishing at on hand , and will be quite useful for constructing a higher level realization out of level 1 representations on the other . therefore we proceed to consider the level 1 representation of our algebra .",

    "the bosonic expressions ( [ bosb]-[bose ] ) only give a bosonic realization of @xmath0at level @xmath107 .",
    "however , as mentioned in the last section , it is possible to obtain realizations of @xmath0at other integer levels using the knowledge gathered so far .",
    "the key point is to make use of proposition 2 repeatedly , first in the case of @xmath128 ( which lead to a realization at level @xmath129 ) , then in the case of @xmath130 , and so on .",
    "we give the following proposition    the level @xmath131 bosonic realization for the algebra @xmath0can be obtained using @xmath132 copies of the heisenberg algebra ( [ heis ] ) @xmath133 ( each of which realizes the level 1 representation for the algebras @xmath134 with @xmath135 ) and the repeated use of proposition 2 ( the comultiplication @xmath136 ) .",
    "actually , the above proposition provides a way to understand the meaning of the infinite hopf family of algebras  instead of getting higher level representations of any distinguished member of this family , one can study the level 1 representations for several members simultaneously .    to obtain bosonic realizations of negative integer level",
    ", one may use the antipodes @xmath137 .",
    "however such realizations are of less interests to us",
    ".      the bosonic realizations of the algebra @xmath0can be viewed as representations on the fock space of the bosonic heisenberg algebras .",
    "therefore , for completeness , we have to pay some words on the structure of fock spaces .",
    "first we specify the fock space for the level 1 representation .",
    "consider the abbreviated form ( [ abbheis ] ) of the bosonic heisenberg algebra @xmath111 .",
    "the structure functions @xmath116 have the properties    @xmath138    let @xmath139 be a right `` vacuum state '' . the right fock space @xmath140",
    "is generated from @xmath139 as follows ,    @xmath141    where @xmath142 are functions which are analytic in a neighborhood of @xmath143 except @xmath144 , where a simple pole may appear .",
    "for each concrete @xmath116 , proper asymptotic behaviors for @xmath142 as @xmath145 are required .",
    "however , we do not specify them in detail ( for the special case of @xmath12 , such asymptotics were given explicitly in ref.@xcite ) .",
    "similarly , let @xmath146 be a left `` vacuum state '' .",
    "the left fock space @xmath147 is generated from as follows ,    @xmath148    where @xmath149 are functions which are analytic in a neighborhood of @xmath150 except @xmath144 , where a simple pole may appear .",
    "as in the case of @xmath142 , proper asymptotic behaviors for @xmath149 as @xmath151 are also required .    like in the case of @xmath12 , the pairing @xmath152 between the left and right fock spaces can be uniquely defined by the following prescriptions ,    * @xmath153 * @xmath154 * the wick theorem .",
    "now let the vacuum states @xmath155 and @xmath146 be such that    @xmath156    let @xmath157 be analytic in some neighborhood of the real @xmath118-line , satisfying proper analytic behaviors as @xmath158 , and may have simple poles at @xmath144 .",
    "then the action of the expressions like    @xmath159    on @xmath140 and @xmath147 are given respectively by the decompositions @xmath160 and @xmath161 , where    @xmath162    moreover , these two actions are adjoint to each other , and the product of normal ordered operators like @xmath163 satisfy our normal ordering rule ( [ norm ] ) .",
    "this complete the description of fock spaces at level 1 .",
    "the fock spaces for level @xmath132 bosonic representation of @xmath0is nothing but the direct product of @xmath132 copies of the level 1 fock spaces , namely , @xmath164 . the left fock space for level @xmath132 bosonic representation has a similar structure , @xmath165 .      as mentioned earlier , the structure of the algebra @xmath0changes drastically from @xmath31 to @xmath32 .",
    "this change is not only reflected in the different asymptotic behaviors for the generating currents , but also in the trivialization of the structure of the infinite hopf family ( see remark 3 ) , and it also affects the representation theory at @xmath32 .",
    "just like the usual affine lie algebras and the affine hopf algebras , among the class of level 0 representations for the algebra @xmath0 , there is a special subclass which is finite dimensional .",
    "we adopt the terminology from the representation theory of affine and affine hopf algebras and call the finite dimensional level 0 representations of @xmath0the evaluation representations .",
    "recall that there is no differences between the algebras @xmath97 and @xmath96 for different @xmath70 and @xmath166 .",
    "recall also that the evaluation representations for the usual affine hopf algebras are best written in terms of `` half currents '' rather than the total currents which we have been using for @xmath0so far .",
    "therefore it seem that the first step to give an evaluation representation for the algebra @xmath0is to split the total currents @xmath125 and @xmath126 into half currents .",
    "this task can be fulfilled in a completely analogous way as in the @xmath30 case .",
    "we define ( for generic @xmath17 ) the half currents @xmath167 and @xmath168 as follows ,    @xmath169    where the contours",
    "@xmath170 and @xmath171 run from @xmath172 to @xmath173 , with the points @xmath174 above @xmath170 , @xmath175 below @xmath170 , @xmath176 above @xmath171 , @xmath177 below @xmath171 .",
    "the remarkable point for these half currents is that they satisfy the following ding - frenkel like relations ,    @xmath178    however these relations should be understood in some proper analytic continuation sense in contrast to the direct decompositions of formal power series @xcite . to be explicit ,",
    "we give the domains of analyticity for the half currents :    @xmath179    moreover , we have    @xmath180    and    @xmath181    where @xmath182 .    the following proposition gives a simplest evaluation representation for @xmath0with @xmath3 .",
    "let @xmath183 be an @xmath4-dimensional vector space with orthogonal basis @xmath184 .",
    "the @xmath4-dimensional evaluation representation of @xmath0with @xmath3 on @xmath185 + @xmath14 @xmath186 $ ] is given by the following actions @xmath187 ,    @xmath188    the relations for the `` negative '' half currents are given by the same formulas but with @xmath182 .",
    "notice that for @xmath189 , the above evaluation representation reduces to the one presented in @xcite for @xmath2 ; for @xmath27 , it reduces to the @xmath4-dimensional evaluation representation for @xmath190 @xcite .",

    ", we can define analogous objects , also called intertwining operators , however acting on the space of tensor product of the infinite dimensional representation of one member of the family and the evaluation representation of the subsequent member of the same family , or on the space of tensor product of the evaluation representation and some infinite dimensional representation of a fixed member of the family .    taking as the infinite dimensional representation",
    "the level 1 bosonic representation , as the evaluation representation the @xmath4-dimensional representation obtained above for @xmath3 , we now proceed to give the definition of a particular set of intertwining operators .",
    "the intertwining operators ( vertex operators ) ( here @xmath191 )    @xmath192    are those commute with the action of @xmath0-matrix for sine - gordon model . in our case",
    ", we do not have such motivations to define twisted vertex operators .",
    "moreover , remember that the comultiplications of ref.@xcite is different from the one we are using .",
    "] ,    @xmath193    where @xmath194@xmath0 .",
    "the components of these vertex operators are defined as follows ,    @xmath195    where @xmath196 and @xmath197 .    using the explicit form of the evaluation representation given in the last subsection and the comultiplication formulas ( [ cob]-[coe ] ) , we are ready to obtain the following intertwining relations ( the commutation relations between vertex operators and the generating currents for @xmath0 ) ,      similar relations for @xmath6-affine algebras can be find in ref.@xcite .",
    "the intertwining relations are highly sensitive to the form of the comultiplication used in the definition of intertwining operators .",
    "the relations given above can be obtained only if we use the comultiplications defined in ( [ cob]-[coe ] ) . for other form of the comultiplication such as the one used in @xcite for @xmath12 ,",
    "not all of the intertwining relations can be written explicitly .    using the bosonic heisenberg algebra @xmath111 , one can in principle",
    "obtain bosonic realizations of these intertwining operators .",
    "then the calculation for the commutation relations between these intertwining operators and the correlation functions of such operators will become possible .",
    "we leave such tasks to future studies .",
    "in closing this paper we give the conclusions and some discussions .",
    "we defined the algebra @xmath0and its infinite hopf family for all the simply - laced lie algebras @xmath1 . using the deformed heisenberg algebra @xmath111",
    ", we obtained the level 1 bosonic representation , and then by repeated use of the comultiplication we get the representations for all positive integer levels . for @xmath3 , we also gave the simplest @xmath4-dimensional evaluation representation and the intertwining relations for the level 1 representation and the @xmath4-dimensional evaluation representation .",
    "the first problem is : why not non - simply - laced lie algebras @xmath1 ? indeed , no reason can be stated _ a priori _ that no analogous algebras exist for non - simply - laced lie algebras @xmath1 .",
    "however , for self - consistence we intentionally excluded non - simply - laced @xmath1 in our consideration .",
    "the reason is that , for such a @xmath1 , the cartan matrix is _ not _ symmetric , so that the heisenberg algebra @xmath111 is not well - defined ( the condition ( [ sym ] ) is violated ) .",
    "probably the way around is to use the _ symmetrized _ cartan matrix instead of the cartan matrix",
    ". then we can give well - defined heisenberg algebra @xmath111 , but the serre - like relations ( [ serr1]-[serr2 ] ) are still not enough to define the algebra @xmath0 , because there are cases for @xmath206 , etc .",
    "the second problem is the other possible realizations of the algebra @xmath0 . for @xmath6-affine algebras ,",
    "yangian doubles and @xmath2 , three different realizations are know to exist , i.e. the current realization , drinfeld generator realization and the reshetkhin - semenov - tian - shansky ( @xmath207 ) realization . for our algebra",
    ", it seems important to find the third realization because this realization has direct connection with the yang - baxter relation and hence is more convenient while considering the possible application of the algebra in integrable quantum field theories .",
    "as mentioned is the introduction , we postulate that our algebra might have important application in describing the quantum symmetries of affine toda theory , however such applications can be made possible only if we have identified the @xmath208-matrix of our algebra with the quantum @xmath209-matrix of affine toda theory . in this respect ,",
    "the other form of the comultiplication which is compatible with @xmath207 relations is also important because under such a comultiplication the commutation relations between the intertwining operators would become a set of faddeev - zamolodchikov like algebra which should be explained as the operator form of the quantum scattering of the corresponding integrable quantum field theory  the affine toda theory as we postulate .",
    "various considerations on the different choices of domains for the deformation parameters @xmath7 and @xmath10 are also important . on this point",
    "the authors of ref.@xcite have already listed many problems to whom we whole heartily agree . besides the problems listed in there , we are also interested in the case of @xmath210 , which should correspond to the case of crystal base for @xmath6-affine algebras .",
    "last , we would like to mention the possible connections between our algebra and the quantum @xmath211-deformed virasoro and @xmath8-algebras .",
    "the @xmath6- and @xmath7-deformed virasoro ( and @xmath8 ) poisson algebras were known to be closely connected to @xmath6-affine algebra and yangian double at the critical level @xcite . the quantum versions of these deformed algebras were also known to exist and nobody knows to which deformed affine algebras they correspond .",
    "the algebras given in this paper may be the right candidate to correspond to the quantum @xmath211-deformed virasoro and @xmath8-algebras .",
    "we point out that algebras correspond to the @xmath212-deformed quantum @xmath8-algebras also exist , which are generalizations of the elliptic algebra @xmath9to other @xmath1 with higher rank .",
    "we shall present the bosonic representation for the current realization for such algebras ( which we call @xmath213 , representative of yet another example of infinite hopf family structure ) in the next paper @xcite .",
