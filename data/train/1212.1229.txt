    "cellular responses to changes in the surrounding world are mediated by protein signaling pathways .",
    "these pathways are typically activated by modification of cell surface receptors .",
    "for example , receptors on the surface of immune cells are a key component in detecting pathogens and activating cellular proliferation , degranulation , and other immune responses .",
    "the number of such receptors on the cell surface typically is @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "surprisingly , sometimes as few as a hundred or even fewer bound receptors are needed to fully activate a cell .",
    "for example , t - cells can be activated by 1  10 receptors at the t - cell  b - cell synapse @xcite .",
    "rat basophilic leukemia cells require fewer than @xmath1 active fc@xmath2-ri receptors to degranulate @xcite .",
    "this is not unique to immune receptors .",
    "for example , cellular response can be triggered by only a few active estrogen receptors @xcite .",
    "this phenomenon of cells having an excessive number of receptors compared to what is needed for activation has been known for a while as a problem of `` spare receptors '' @xcite    functional importance of this overabundance of receptors is not understood , and several explanations can be considered .",
    "one possibility is that the chemical information may not be distributed uniformly in space , requiring receptors at multiple locations on the cell surface .",
    "an example is the t - cell , which is commonly activated by antigen - presenting cells through a localized synapse @xcite .",
    "alternatively , the number of ligands may be very low , and then the probability of receptor - ligand binding is increased by having many receptors even in the well - mixed chemical kinetics limit @xcite . finally , large number of receptors facilitates clustering , promoting collective response , which may lead to signal amplification @xcite .",
    "here we suggest that , in an alternative regime of a high ligand concentration , the large number of receptors may play an additional role .",
    "for example , for biological processes such as the immune response , synchronous and short cellular activation times would allow a concerted defense against an infection , and may be functionally advantageous .",
    "similarly , concerted response is important in growth receptor signaling .",
    "we suggest that such improvement in the accuracy of the activation time may be achieved through a competition among many receptors .",
    "we envision a receptor that , when activated , produces an active messenger molecule .",
    "a few , and maybe just one , of such molecules are sufficient to start transcription or otherwise activate the whole cell .",
    "each receptor takes an extended and variable amount of time to activate .",
    "then the first few receptors out of many that have achieved full activation will activate the cell .",
    "the variability of the activation time of these fastest receptors can be smaller than that of a typical receptor . to build an intuition ,",
    "think about the distribution of finish times for runners in a marathon . in this analogy ,",
    "each cell is a marathon with many receptors representing runners .",
    "they all start at about the same time , launched into the activation race by an abundant ligand , and activated receptors are represented by runners who have finished the race . in large marathons with thousands of participants , the time it takes to reach the finish line for the first few runners is much smaller than the mean of the finishing times .",
    "more importantly , for an individual marathon , the variability in finish times among all the runners can be fairly large , of order of several hours . and",
    "yet the distribution of times of the winners of many marathons has the variability of the order of minutes . in a similar manner",
    ", the receptors that are activated first in different cells might have activation times with small variance , leading to a more synchronous response .    in this work ,",
    "we approach the problem in the context of simplified receptor models .",
    "the receptor activation is first modeled as a linear chain of @xmath3 states , such as ligand binding , conformational changes , dimerization , etc .",
    "ligand presentation starts the progression along the chain , and the final state represents receptor activation . with this model , the probability distribution of time to activation of the first receptor out of @xmath4 receptors , with @xmath5 ,",
    "is given by a weibull distribution , which has a small coefficient of variation .",
    "when @xmath6 ( @xmath7 ) receptors are needed to activate the cell , the coefficient of variation decreases even further .",
    "this `` racing to activation '' results in a short and less variable time to activation .",
    "finally , we point out that , to activate specifically to a certain ligand , cells often use kinetic proofreading @xcite .",
    "we show that a large number of receptors does not necessarily interfere with the ability to proofread .",
    "it enables cells to be activated temporally precisely , but also specifically to certain ligands . using biologically reasonable parameter values",
    ", we predict the number of receptors that allows for both of these properties .",
    "schematic description of the model .",
    "( a ) @xmath3 irreversible steps with rates @xmath8 are needed to activate a receptor .",
    "( b ) kinetic proofreading , denoted by the backwards transitions with the rate @xmath9 , allows the receptor preferentially by a correct ligand . ]",
    "a simplified model of receptor activation consists of a linear chain of @xmath3 irreversible events where the receptor undergoes biochemical transformations that ultimately lead to activation , see fig .",
    "[ fig : model]a . in this figure ,",
    "the multistep activation process begins at the diamond ( site @xmath10 ) , and at each site the system can transit one step towards activation with a forward rate @xmath8 . reaching the right - most site , @xmath11 , will lead to the receptor activation irreversible on the time scales considered . in order to simplify the algebraic expressions , we assume an equal forward rate for all sites",
    ". this simplification may reduce the generality of our results somewhat , but it does not change their dependence on @xmath3 , provided none of the rates @xmath8 are small enough to form a bottleneck .    the probability distribution of the time to complete each single step in the process of the multistep activation is an exponential distribution with rate @xmath8 @xmath12 the mean time is @xmath13 , the variance is @xmath14 , and the coefficient of variation is @xmath15 . for the whole process with @xmath3 steps , the probability distribution of time to activation is the well known @xmath16 distribution @xmath17 this distribution has a broad peak .",
    "an example of the @xmath16-distribution with @xmath18 and @xmath19 is shown in fig .  [ fig : distributions ] .",
    "the moments of the @xmath16 distribution are readily available : @xmath20 the observation that multistep chemical reactions reduce the coefficient of variation of activation time , has been well understood computationally and experimentally , most notably in the context of vertebrate vision @xcite .",

    "the decrease of the coefficient of variation in proportion to @xmath23 holds true for a single receptor .",

    "we are interested in understanding how this large number affects the mean and the variability of the activation times .",

    "our model of kinetic proofreading follows ref .",
    "@xcite , and is shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : model]b .",
    "we assume that there are two branches of sequential events in the receptor state diagram : a correct branch and a wrong one .",
    "the two branches represent activation sequences following binding of a specific / nonspecific ligand molecules , with rates @xmath51 and @xmath52 for the correct / wrong branches , respectively . for both branches , kinetic proofreading",
    "is represented by possible jumps back to the initial state with rates @xmath53 and @xmath54 , respectively .",
    "these jumps can correspond to ligand unbinding from the receptor , followed by return of the receptor into the initial , fully inactive state .",
    "if @xmath55 ( that is , a nonspecific ligand unbinds faster than the specific one ) , then the receptor has a much lower probability to reach the final , absorbing state along the wrong branch than along the correct one , hence increasing the specificity . while this model is crude , it nonetheless captures the basic physical properties of the kinetic proofreading process .",
    "kinetic proofreading typically leads to a near - exponential distribution of completion times @xcite , which has @xmath56 .",
    "the distribution is different from the exponential only over a very short initial time period since it is difficult to traverse the sequence of @xmath3 steps to activation quickly , see fig .  [",
    "fig : kprdistr ] .",
    "this has a potential of interfering with the racing to activation mechanism for improving temporal precision .",
    "indeed , a receptor with an exponentially distributed activation time is equivalent to a single - step receptor , @xmath57 . in this case",
    "the corresponding @xmath16 and the weibull distributions are exponential as well , providing no reduction in the coefficient of variation .",
    "however , if the number of receptors is sufficiently large , then the first few receptors will have a substantial chance to activate during the initial , nonexponential phase of the completion time distribution .",
    "that is , they will activate quickly in a linear sequence of events , as in the previous section , having no time to revert back to the initial state through the proofreading mechanism .",
    "thus if the number of receptors is sufficient to complete so quickly along the correct branch , the temporal precision will increase through the racing to activation mechanism . on the other hand , since @xmath54 is larger , the receptor trying to activate over the same time along the wrong branch may have sufficient time to revert to the initial state repeatedly , falling into the exponential part of the completion time distribution .",
    "this suggests that the number of receptors on the cell surface should also be limited from above , so that wrong activation has a low probability of happening in the pre - exponential part of the activation distribution .",
    "mathematically , we can summarize these arguments as follows . following ref .",

    "the window between @xmath68 and @xmath81 is sufficiently large to allow the choice of receptor number that satisfies both the proofreading and the narrow activation time .",
    "further , these numbers are realistic in the context of biological receptor numbers , which range between @xmath82 and @xmath83 .",
    "biological systems must operate under constraints posed by the physical world .",
    "one of such constraints is robustness to intrinsic noise that comes about from the small number of stochastically activated molecular components in cellular networks . performing averages of different kinds ( over time , space , or different molecular species )",
    "is , essentially , the only way of ensuring such robustness . in this context , it has been understood for many years that sequential activation of @xmath3 molecular components averages the times of the activation steps and reduces the coefficient of variation of the time to activation , which scales then as @xmath84 @xcite .",
    "this has been observed experimentally in the context of vertebrate phototransduction @xcite .",
    "here we propose a mechanism that can further reduce the variability to @xmath85 , and even @xmath86 ( where @xmath6 is the cooperativity of the activation process ) , which may be a substantial improvement for long activation sequences and large cooperativities .",
    "the reduction of variability is achieved by having many equivalent multi - step entities , competing to be the first one to activate the whole system .",
    "we believe that this mechanism , which we call _ racing to activation _ , has not been reported previously in the literature .",
    "our focus here is on the general noise suppression mechanism , and not on any specific biological system .",
    "nonetheless , it is clear that various receptor - mediated signaling systems are likely to be examples of where this mechanism will be applicable .",
    "the fact that receptors exist on cell surfaces in very large numbers , far in excess of what is needed to fully activate a cell , is encouraging .",
    "however , the large number of receptors needed for reduction of the temporal noise in the racing to activation mechanism can come in conflict with the specificity of signaling .",
    "it is , therefore , reassuring that , within our model , there is a range of receptor numbers that allows cells to maintain specificity to certain ligands , and yet be activated precisely in time .",
    "another possible application of our model is in development .",
    "there a crucial question is the precision of position determination afforded by morphogen gradients @xcite . while most analyses are done for steady state gradients",
    ", cells may need to make developmental commitments based on pre - steady state transients @xcite .",
    "adding reverse reactions to fig .",

    "our arguments suggest that such temporal , first - passage triggering of developmental commitments can be made very precise .",
    "while too coarse for specific details , our results can be used to make general , verifiable predictions about relations between the number of receptors , the similarity of specific and non - specific ligands , the cooperativity of receptor action on the one hand , and the variability of the activation time on the other . such data , when available , will shed light on whether the proposed mechanism is used in cellular processes , and to which extent .    in",
