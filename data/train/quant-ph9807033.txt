    "in this note we consider the continuum limit of a field theory defined in a large box of size @xmath0 . in the limit @xmath1 , all discrete states apart from bound states become continuum states . according to most textbooks , quantum field theory",
    "is supposed to be well understood in this limit .",
    "we show , however , that the limiting procedure is subtle and unless proper care is exercized the usual prescriptions may give incorrect results . in particular ,",
    "we show an example where the charge of the system seems to be a continuous function of the background field whereas it should be integer - valued .",
    "an example which we have discussed in previous papers ( which are referred to as cdi @xcite and cd2 @xcite ) is provided by the second quantized dirac theory in the presence of a one dimensional four - vector potential vanishing at spatial infinity . the usual limiting procedure for counting states in the continuum limit",
    "is given by    @xmath2    where @xmath3 is the scattering phase shift for a particle of momentum @xmath4 in that limit . yet as we ( and many others ) have argued the vacuum charge @xmath5 of the system defined in the normal way by the spectral asymmetry    @xmath6    which is obviously integer - valued in a box of finite size @xmath0 is given in the continuum limit using eq .",
    "( [ sum ] ) by    @xmath7    where @xmath8 and @xmath9 refer to electron and positron scattering phase shifts and @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the number of positive and negative energy bound states .",
    "since in one - dimension ( see cdi )    @xmath12    this implies for the potential @xmath13 that @xmath14 which is a continuous function of @xmath15 the correct result is calculated using eq .",

    "the erroneous result of eq .",
    "( [ err ] ) for the vacuum charge for this model is found in many places besides cdi , for example in refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite . the same error may also be responsible for similar results where other quantised quantities such as baryon charge or angular momentum seem to be given non - quantised values @xcite for no apparent reason .       in cdi following barton @xcite we counted states and showed that the number of both positive and negative energy states is unchanged when a potential is switched on from zero thus the vacuum charge is still zero in the presence of a small potential : there is a bound state but the number of continuum states",
    "has decreased by one . as the potential increases in strength @xmath5 changes by one according to eq .",
    "( [ spec ] ) whenever a state crosses @xmath18",
    "so why is the erroneous result obtained and how can it be avoided ?",
    "we now turn to these points .       in order to quantize the model consistently with standard anticommutation relations",
    "it is essential that eigenfunctions be normalised to unity .",
    "we shall see that to ensure correct normalisation we have to include an unfamiliar normalisation factor @xmath19 which reduces to unity as @xmath20 ; in fact @xmath21 .",
    "it turns out that the expression for @xmath22 involves the phase shifts in a way reminiscent of the incorrect result of eq .",
    "( [ err ] ) .",
    "we obtain a new expression for the charge density differing from the conventional one by terms of order @xmath23 . we find a finite change in the vacuum charge ( defined as the space integral of the vacuum charge density ) induced by the spectral asymmetry residing in a certain region of space of the system .",
    "it is crucial to get this @xmath24 behaviour correct if we wish to sum over states and convert sums to integrals via @xmath25    there are topologically nontrivial models where the dirac particle is coupled to a soliton ; the attending zero modes induce non - integer values for the vacuum charge @xcite .",
    "however in problems with trivial topology such as ours @xmath5 is integral .",
    "the potential @xmath26 is symmetric and is taken to vanish for @xmath27 we take the system in a box of length @xmath28 with periodic boundary conditions @xmath29 wavefunctions are classified according to the magnitude of the wavevector outside the well and parity .",
    "positive energy solutions outside the potential take the form",
    "@xmath30 @xmath31    the subscript + in the phase shifts @xmath32 refers to the energy sign .",
    "similar expressions are valid for negative energy states @xmath33 , @xmath34 provided we replace @xmath35 by @xmath36 and change notation from @xmath37 @xmath38 @xmath39 @xmath40 to @xmath41 @xmath42 @xmath43 @xmath44 .",
    "we also quote for future reference the form of the even bound state wavefunction outside the well @xmath45    we insist on the normalization    @xmath46    for all eigenstates of the hamiltonian . for the bound state the appropriate value of @xmath47 to ensure correct normalization depends on the detailed behaviour of the potential .",
    "we rederive a result originally due to stone @xcite which itself is based on a problem in landau and lifshitz @xcite .",
    "we start with the dirac equation ; the argument is equally valid for either positive or negative energy solutions , thus @xmath48@xmath49    and left - multiply by @xmath50 @xmath51    write the dirac equation for @xmath52 , take the hermitian conjugate and right - multiply by @xmath53@xmath54    subtract ( [ e3 ] ) from ( [ e2 ] ) to get @xmath55    integrating over @xmath56 from @xmath57to @xmath58 : @xmath59 _ { z_1}^{z_2}=\\left ( e_{k^{\\prime } } -e_k\\right )   % tcimacro{\\dint } % beginexpansion \\displaystyle \\int   % endexpansion _ { z_1}^{z_2}u_k^{\\dagger } u_{k^{\\prime } } dz\\ ] ]    take @xmath60 in the above equation and divide by @xmath61 : @xmath62 _ { z_1}^{z_2}=% \\frac{de}{dk}% % tcimacro{\\dint } % beginexpansion \\displaystyle \\int   % endexpansion",

    "its power lies in the fact that to evaluate the left hand side for @xmath64 it suffices to use the asymptotic expressions eqs .",
    "( [ ee ] , [ eo ] ) for the wavefunctions where only the phase shifts appear .",
    "note that the normalisation condition ( [ n1 ] ) together with periodic boundary conditions entail restrictions on @xmath4 .",
    "apply relation ( [ e6 ] ) at the endpoints @xmath65 .",
    "then in the left hand side we only need the asymptotic expressions eqs .",
    "( [ ee ] , [ eo ] ) and on the right hand side we can use eq.([n1 ] ) to set the integral equal to unity .",
    "the evaluation of the left hand side simplifies because of the periodic boundary conditions .",
    "we thus obtain @xmath66    and therefore @xmath67    for @xmath0 large .",
    "note that the quantities @xmath68 vanish both when @xmath69 and in the limit @xmath1 .",

    "the factors @xmath75 provide a spatially uniform contribution to the charge density equal to @xmath76          in the absence of the potential the first two terms in eqs .",
    "( [ d5 ] , [ d7 ] ) would still be there .",
    "we wish to calculate @xmath83 defined as the part of @xmath5 residing outside the well .",
    "( since @xmath5 itself vanishes this charge is cancelled exactly by an opposite charge residing inside the well . )",
    "we see that the continuum contribution to the vacuum charge outside the well resulting from the last term in ( [ d5 ] , [ d7 ] ) is given by      ( where the phase shifts @xmath85 refer as before@xcite to the sum of the even and odd phase shifts ) , an expression which is very similar to eq .",
    "( [ err ] ) and which will in general give non - integral values for @xmath86 to get the total continuum contribution we should integrate over the terms that depend on the mass explicitly .",
    "the final result is in general non - integral since there is no reason why the charge inside or outside a particular region of space should be integer - valued .",
