    "gan epitaxial layers grown on different substrates ( e.g. , al@xmath1o@xmath2 , sic , or si ) possess very large densities of threading dislocations which cross the layer along its normal , from the layer - substrate interface to the surface.@xcite the threading dislocation density depends only marginally on the substrate material ( and hence on the misfit between the substrate and the layer ) but rather on the growth technique and conditions . for ( 0001 ) oriented layers of wurtzite gan , the overwhelming majority of dislocations are of edge type with burgers vectors @xmath3 .",
    "their density@xcite is typically @xmath4  @xmath5 .",
    "the density of screw dislocations with burgers vector @xmath6 $ ] is one to two orders of magnitude lower than the density of edge dislocations .     and",
    "the diffracted wave @xmath7 make the same angle @xmath8 to the sample surface .",
    "the scattering vector @xmath9 makes an angle @xmath10 to the sample surface . ]",
    "the dislocation density can be measured directly by plan - view transmission electron microscopy ( tem ) .",
    "the actual virtue of tem is not the accurate determination of the dislocation density , but rather the possibility to determine the type of the dislocation distribution ( e.  g. , random vs.  granular / columnar structure ) .",
    "it is of limited statistical significance considering the small area covered by tem micrographs . alternatively",
    ", x - ray diffraction can be used to detect the lattice distortions due to the presence of dislocations . in principle",
    ", both the dislocation distribution and the actual dislocation density may be obtained from x - ray diffraction profiles .",
    "the impact of screw and edge threading dislocations on the width of the x - ray reflections in the limiting cases of lattice planes parallel and perpendicular to the surface is commonly referred to as tilt and twist , respectively.@xcite this designation stems from the model of misoriented blocks@xcite which is _ not _ appropriate for strains caused by randomly distributed dislocations . in this case , the description in terms of mean - squared distortions@xcite is actually more adequate .",
    "moreover , all previous experimental studies only use the full width at half - maximum ( fwhm ) of different reflections as a measure of the dislocation density .",
    "the symmetric bragg reflections from gan layers are comparatively narrow , since they are not influenced by the presence of edge dislocations .",
    "edge dislocations produce distortions within lattice planes parallel to the surface but do not disturb positions of these planes along the layer normal . the highest sensitivity to edge dislocations",
    "is obtained by diffraction from lattice planes perpendicular to the surface .",
    "this diffraction geometry requires grazing incidence illumination and is thus commonly performed at a synchrotron.@xcite an alternative geometry that can easily be realized in the laboratory is the skew geometry,@xcite which is a quasi - symmetric ( the incident and the diffracted waves have the same angles to the surface ) non - coplanar ( the surface normal does not lie in the plane defined by the incident and the diffracted waves ) geometry , as shown in fig.[skew ] . by measuring different reflections with increasing lattice plane inclination",
    ", one can extrapolate to lattice planes perpendicular to the surface.@xcite a single reflection with a large inclination can be regarded as a figure of merit.@xcite a four - circle diffractometer@xcite is required for skew geometry measurements , since the sample has to be tilted with respect to its surface normal .",
    "coplanar asymmetric reflections on a three - circle diffractometer are much less sensitive to edge dislocations since they only partially touch the lattice distortions parallel to the surface plane.@xcite    the fwhm of the diffraction peak depends not only on the dislocation density , but also on the correlations between dislocations .",
    "furthermore , it depends on the mutual orientations of the scattering vector , dislocation line direction , and the burgers vector direction , which have not been taken into consideration in previous diffraction studies of gan layers . in the present paper",
    ", we analyze the entire lineshape of the diffraction profiles , and particularly their tails .",
    "these tails are due to scattering in the close vicinity of the dislocation lines and are not influenced by the correlations between dislocations .",
    "they follow universal power laws and can be used to determine the dislocation density .",
    "we fit the entire diffraction peak profile to the numerical fourier transform of the pair correlation function and simultaneously obtain dislocation densities and the range of dislocation correlations .",
    "x - ray diffraction is a well - established technique to analyze crystal lattice imperfections.@xcite the conventional and widely used methods ( also in gan studies@xcite ) are based on a comparison of the diffraction peak widths of different reflections.@xcite they aim to separate two contributions to the peak broadening , the finite size of the crystalline domains ( grains ) in the sample and the non - uniform strain within each domain owing to lattice defects .",
    "the strain broadening of a diffraction peak is proportional to the length of the scattering vector , while the size effect does not depend on it .",
    "thus , comparing the peak widths of reflections of successive orders in the so - called williamson - hall plot , one can separate both contributions .",
    "the separation method assumes that all peaks are gaussian,@xcite or all lorentzian.@xcite this is certainly not true , and the methods based on the peak width give only rough , albeit instructive , estimates of the crystal perfection .",
    "a recent development @xcite includes corrections for given orientations of the dislocation lines and burgers vectors with respect to the scattering vector .",
    "the next milestone was the fourier analysis of the diffraction peak profile proposed by warren and averbach.@xcite the starting point of their analysis is the average over grain orientations in powder diffraction .",
    "the corresponding integration of the scattered intensity in reciprocal space is equivalent to a one - dimensional cut of the correlation function in real space .",
    "we note that the powder diffraction literature does not use the term correlation function but refers to the fourier coefficients of the intensity .",
    "we use the solid - state physics terminology where this quantity is commonly called the pair correlation function . in crystallography , the same function is referred to as patterson function .",
    "the ansatz of the warren - averbach analysis is the assumption that the correlation function is a product of two independent terms describing the size and the strain effects , respectively .",
    "furthermore , it is assumed that the finite sizes of the grains give rise to a lorentzian peak ( exponential correlation function ) while non - uniform strain is described by a gaussian function . with these assumptions , the size and strain effects",
    "are separated by differentiation of the fourier - transformed peak profile . in many cases ,",
    "the latter step is not sufficiently accurate , since it has to rely on a few fourier coefficients obtained from noisy experimental data .",
    "balzar@xcite suggested to avoid this difficulty by directly fitting the peak profile to a convolution of a lorentzian and a gaussian , which is the voigt function .",
    "the experimental peak profiles are not always described by the voigt function and various other analytical functions were suggested on a purely phenomenological basis.@xcite    the assumption that non - uniform strain gives rise to a gaussian correlation function looks plausible , taking into account the stochastic nature of this strain originating from randomly distributed lattice defects .",
    "however , krivoglaz and ryboshapka@xcite have shown that this is not true for random dislocations , which are the most common and most important source of strain .",
    "rather , they found that the slow ( @xmath11 ) decay of the strain with the distance @xmath12 from the dislocation line gives rise to a correlation function @xmath13 here @xmath14 is a dimensionless factor depending on the orientations of the dislocation line and burgers vector with respect to the @xmath15-direction ( an arbitrary direction along which the correlations are measured ) .",
    "its dependence on the scattering vector @xmath9 and the burgers vector @xmath16 is given by @xmath17 .",
    "the dislocation density @xmath18 is defined as a total length of the dislocation lines per unit volume . for straight dislocations , @xmath18 is equal to the number of dislocations crossing the unit area of a plane perpendicular to the dislocation lines .",
    "@xmath19 is another dimensionless factor , for uncorrelated dislocations @xmath20 .    for completely random and uncorrelated dislocations , @xmath21 is the crystal size , so that the diffraction peak width of an infinite crystal with random uncorrelated dislocations tends to infinity .",
    "wilkens@xcite pointed out that this divergence has the same origin as the divergence of elastic energy of a crystal with dislocations : the elastic energy is proportional to @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the shear modulus , @xmath24 is the length of the burgers vector , and @xmath25 is the lattice spacing .",
    "he suggested that the system can drastically reduce elastic energy by a very minor rearrangement in the dislocation ensemble : the positions of the dislocations remain random but their burgers vectors are correlated , so that the total burgers vector in a region exceeding some characteristic scale is zero .",
    "then , the dislocations screen each other and the elastic energy , as well as the diffraction peak width , remain finite .",
    "wilkens introduced a `` restricted random distribution '' of dislocations by subdividing the crystal into cells , such that the total burgers vector in each cell is zero .",
    "he found@xcite that the functional form of eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) does not change but @xmath21 should be understood as a finite size of the cells .",
    "_ et al.__@xcite showed that the same result is valid for a broad class of correlated dislocation distributions with screening .",
    "we note also the two - dimensional crystal as a limiting case of dislocation screening . here",
    "the elastic energy of dislocations is to be compared with the entropic term @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is temperature and the entropy @xmath28 is the number of lattice sites where the dislocation can be placed .",
    "both elastic energy and entropy terms are proportional to @xmath29 . as a result , above some temperature @xmath30 ,",
    "dislocations are generated by unbinding of thermally excited dislocation pairs , giving rise to the dislocation mediated melting.@xcite the calculation of the correlation function in this highly correlated dislocation system@xcite shows that the logarithmic term in eq.([eq1 ] ) vanishes .",
    "fourier transformation of the correlation function ( [ eq1 ] ) yields a gaussian shape only in the central part of the peak .",
    "the range of the gaussian peak shape is given by a dimensionless factor @xmath31 and increases when @xmath32 is increased .",
    "the intensity distribution notably deviates from the gaussian shape at the tails of the diffraction peak .",
    "the tails of the diffraction peak due to dislocations follow a universal law @xmath33 , which can be obtained from fourier transformation of eq .",
    "( [ eq1]).@xcite the @xmath0 law is due to the fact that at large @xmath34 , the scattering takes place in the strained regions close to dislocation lines , where the lattice is so strongly misoriented that the bragg law is locally satisfied for the wave vector @xmath34 .",
    "calculation of the volume of these regions give the @xmath0 dependence.@xcite groma and co - workers@xcite developed methods for the peak profile analysis based on a calculation of the restricted moments of @xmath35 .",
    "in particular , the second - order restricted moment @xmath36 is proportional to @xmath37 , which they used to determine the mean dislocation density .",
    "higher - order moments describe fluctuations of the dislocation density .",
    "gan epitaxial film comprise a well - defined system where threading dislocations are aligned perpendicular to the surface plane .",
    "the film is oriented , contrary to a powder . however , the x - ray diffraction measurements performed with an open detector give rise to an average very similar to the powder average .",

    "the width of a given reflection depends not only on the dislocation density , but also on the range of correlations in the restricted random dislocation distribution .",
    "the lineshape analysis of the diffraction profile as presented in this work returns the width as well as the correlation range , and is thus a far more reliable approach for estimating the dislocation density than a simple consideration of the width alone .    the lineshape analysis has shown that the x - ray diffraction profiles of the gan films under investigation are gaussian only in the central part of the peak .",
