    "the interaction of lipid vesicles with external electric fields has been a subject of growing interest from both an application and a mechanistic standpoint @xcite .",
    "one of the most striking phenomena in vesicle electrohydrodynamics is the prolate - oblate - prolate ( pop ) transition @xcite .",
    "consider a prolate vesicle where the major axis is initially aligned with the applied electric field .",
    "if the fluid encapsulated by the vesicle has a lower conductivity than the surrounding fluid there is a chance that the vesicle will transition to an oblate shape , where the major axes are perpendicular to the electric field . over time",
    "the vesicle will evolve back into the prolate shape ( aligned with the electric field ) and stays in that equilibrium condition permanently @xcite . in order to observe the full pop transition the external electric field has to be strong enough to overcome the forces of the vesicle membrane and the hydrodynamic forces of the fluid .    in physical experiments capturing a full pop transition with a single dc pulse",
    "is not a trivial task @xcite .",
    "strong fields can easily cause membrane poration which causes the vesicle to stay in the oblate shape permanently or to collapse before reaching the final prolate condition .",
    "therefore , applying an electric field with the appropriate strength and duration is crucial in directing the behavior of the vesicle into the desired dynamics and configuration .",

    "the effects of fluid and vesicles properties on the electrohydrodynamic behavior are examined and the critical parameter thresholds required to observe a full pop transition are determined .",
    "this includes the effect of membrane capacitance and of the viscosity and conductivity ratios of the embedded and surrounding fluids for a range of different reduced volumes .",

    "an interesting comparison can be made between the membrane charging timescale and the electrohydrodynamic time scale of the applied field given by @xmath97 .",
    "the electrohydrodynamic time scale largely depends on the electric field strength : a strong electric field is associated with a shorter electrohydrodynamic time . in theory , for a nearly spherical vesicle a full pop transition will occur if @xmath98 @xcite . in such situations",

    "the critical electric field strength appears to be linearly related to the viscosity , @xmath105 .",
    "one consequence of these results is that it appears that given the same electrical properties , smaller reduced volumes require a stronger field to achieve a full pop transition .",

    "next , consider only the normal electric field forces on the interface .",
    "tangential electric field forces will drag the fluid into motion but do not induced changes in the vesicle membrane .",

    "this clearly shows that both normal and tangential electric field components contribution to membrane deformation . to further simplify the discussion ,",
    "consider the two points @xmath127 and @xmath128 located respectively at the top pole and the equator of the vesicle , see fig .",

    "now consider what occurs when @xmath140 . given enough time charges are able to accumulate on both sides of the interface .",

    "first examine the contribution of the membrane capacitance .",
    "the membrane capacitance influences how fast the trans - membrane potential reaches a steady state value , eq .",
    "( [ eq : vm_equation ] ) .",
    "the time it takes for the trans - membrane potential to reach steady state is inversely proportional to @xmath100 . as the amount of time that the electric forces can act on the membrane is directly related to the membrane - charging time , a decrease in @xmath96 results in a system which does not have enough time to respond and obtain a full pop transition .",
    "therefore the mason number must increase at a rate proportional to @xmath148 to ensure that the pop transition occurs .",
    "next consider the viscosity ratio , @xmath104 .",
    "it was stated in sec .",
    "[ sec:3.0 ] that for a pop transition to occur the electrohydrodynamic time , @xmath99 , needs to be smaller than the membrane charging time , @xmath96 .",
    "as the electrohydrodynamic time increases linearly with an increase in the viscosity ratio , @xmath149 , the membrane charging time must also increase linearly to @xmath104 to maintain the @xmath98 relation .",
    "recall that for results in the absence of shear flow the characteristic time was set to the membrane charging time , @xmath150 , and therefore the mason number depends linearly on @xmath96 .",
    "thus , an increase in the viscosity ratio results in a linear increase in @xmath99 , which results in a linear increase of @xmath96 so that the pop transition can occur , which finally leads to a linear increase of @xmath91 .",
    "the conductivity ratio presents a more complicated picture .",
    "based on the previous discussion only @xmath137 will result in a pop transition and thus all cases with @xmath151 are ignored .",
    "examining @xmath96 it is clear that an increase in the conductivity ratio will result in a decrease of the membrane - charging time .",
    "this is due to the fact that as @xmath152 the fluids are able to supply charges to the interface at the same rate and thus a charge mismatch does not occur .",
    "following the discussion regarding the viscosity ratio , a corresponding decrease in @xmath99 would be required for a pop transition to occur .",
    "this is achieved by increasing the electric field strength and therefore increasing @xmath31 .",
    "analysis of the equations results in a scaling of @xmath153 , which can not account for the rapid increase of @xmath91 as @xmath92 approached 1 , fig .",
    "[ fig : condmnpop ] .",
    "it is thus necessary to turn to the forces acting on the membrane and how they relate to @xmath92 , eq .",
    "( [ eq : elecforcea_2 ] ) . clearly , as the conductivity ratio approaches 1 the forces acting on the membrane asymptotically approach zero .",
    "it is therefore expected that rapid growth of the electric field would be needed obtain a full pop transition .",
    "it is suspected that at small conductivity ratios the increase in @xmath91 is dominated by @xmath154 while as @xmath152 the growth becomes dominated by @xmath155 .",
    "further investigations are needed to verify this .",
    "in this paper a parameter space study of 3d vesicles exposed to dc electric fields was presented . in particular , the focus of this work was on the effects of different fluid and membrane parameters on the transition between prolate and oblate shapes for a suspended vesicle , in addition to the transition from the tumbling to tank - treading regime of a vesicle under the combined effects of a dc electric field and shear flow .    the electric field strength , indicated by the critical mason number , @xmath91 , required for a pop transition was determined .",
    "a decrease in the reduced volume of the vesicle was always accompanied with an increase in the critical mason number . while an increase in the viscosity ratio between the inner and outer fluids brought about an almost linear increase of @xmath91 , the change in the dynamics of the vesicle by varying the conductivity ratio between the two fluids and the membrane capacitance of the vesicle was found to be more dramatic and substantial .",
    "the results of the vesicle behavior under the combined effects of shear flow and weak dc electric fields revealed the remarkable influence of the electric field in changing the standard behaviors of tank - treading and tumbling vesicles .",
    "investigations showed that the application of the electric field generates a damping force against the motion of the normally tumbling vesicle . if this force is strong enough the tumbling vesicle stops the flipping tumbling behavior and undergoes a tank - treading motion the critical @xmath156 for this transition to occur",
    "was determined over a range of different viscosity ratios for vesicles with two different reduced volumes .",
    "the results and analysis presented here assumed matched fluid permittivities and only considered a single initial vesicle shape .",
    "it is expected that different initial vesicle shapes could result in differing dynamics while the equilibrium shape would remain the same as presented here .",
    "additionally , a relaxation of the matched permittivity condition could result in behavior not observed here .",
    "future work will explore the influence of initial vesicle shape and permittivity differences on the dynamics of vesicles exposed to dc electric fields .",
