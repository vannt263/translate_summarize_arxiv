    "the thermoelectric properties of transition - metal oxides have attracted increasing attention year by year , since the good thermoelectric properties of the layered co oxide na@xmath9coo@xmath0 were discovered @xcite .",

    "@xcite thus a new n - type thermoelectric oxide is desired for all - oxide thermoelectric devices .",
    "recently , ca@xmath10li@xmath9pd@xmath12o@xmath1 turned out to be a good p - type thermoelectric material @xcite , and ca@xmath10bi@xmath9pd@xmath12o@xmath1 was found to be an n - type material@xcite .",
    "ca@xmath10bi@xmath9pd@xmath12o@xmath1 is the first example of the n - type pd oxide , and is interesting in the sense that electrons are doped in the @xmath14 band separated from the @xmath15 band by a small energy gap of 0 - 10  mev .",
    "one serious drawback against good thermoelectrics was a small effective mass with a low mobility .",
    "@xcite in addition , substitution of bi for ca can not change the doping level so widely , because the solubility limit of bi is at most 15  % that corresponds to only 5  % of electrons per pd .",
    "thus , we had to find another pd oxide for n - type thermoelectric materials in which carrier concentration can be changed more widely .    among various pd oxides",
    ", we focused on r@xmath0pdo@xmath1 , ( r = la , nd , sm , and gd ) which is isomorphic to nd@xmath16ce@xmath9cuo@xmath1 , a famous n - type high - temperature superconductor @xcite .",
    "the pd@xmath17 ion of @xmath18 is surrounded with four planar oxygen atoms , in which the @xmath14 orbital is expected to be the lowest unoccupied state . through substitution of ce for r , we expect that electrons can be doped in the @xmath14 band , and let the sample be an n - type conductor .",
    "as is similar to the cuo@xmath0 plane in nd@xmath16ce@xmath9cuo@xmath1 , we expect that the pdo@xmath0 plane would be metallic with a wide @xmath19 band .",
    "polycrystalline samples of r@xmath0pdo@xmath1 ( r = la , nd , sm and gd ) and nd@xmath5ce@xmath6pdo@xmath1 were prepared by a solid - state reaction using a nacl - flux technique @xcite .",

    "nacl was then added in a mass ratio of 2:1 , thoroughly mixed again , and were fired at 1073  k for 24  h in air .",
    "the product was finely ground , and nacl was rinsed out in hot distilled water .",
    "the powder was dried , palletized and sintered at 1073  k for 12  h in air .",
    "the low sintering temperature of 1073  k prevented cations from evaporating from the pellets , which was verified through the composition analyses of ca@xmath10li@xmath9pd@xmath12o@xmath1 previously .",
    "@xcite we did not check the oxygen content , but as shown below , the magnitude of the thermopower of r@xmath0pdo@xmath1 is 200 - 600  @xmath20v / k at 300  k , clearly indicating that they are almost undoped .",
    "this implies that the formal valence of pd is close to @xmath21 , and that the oxygen content is almost 4 .",
    "thus we refer the samples by nominal compositions in the present paper .",
    "the black - colored samples were characterized by powder x - ray diffraction ( xrd ) using cu @xmath22 radiation from 2@xmath23 = 10 to 100  deg .",

    "[ figmag ] , the susceptibility of la@xmath0pdo@xmath1 is as small as that of a diamagnetic substance like water .",

    "thus we can safely assume that the pd ions are in the low - spin state with the configuration of @xmath30 , and that the @xmath14 band is unoccupied , as expected in the introduction .",

    "we note that the resistivity of our samples at room temperature is two orders of magnitude smaller than the previously reported values @xcite .",

    "@xcite the magnitude is as large as 200 - 600  @xmath20v / k at 300  k , which indicates that the carriers are almost undoped .",
    "considering that conventional thermoelectric materials show a thermopower of 200  @xmath20v / k at 300  k , we conclude that the carrier density is somewhat lower than that of them . comparing with a typical carrier density ( 10@xmath31 - 10@xmath32  cm@xmath2 ) of conventional thermoelectric materials",
    ", we estimate the carrier density of r@xmath0pdo@xmath1 to be of the order of 0.01 electrons per pd ion .",
    "one may notice that the magnitude of the thermopower systematically increases in going from r = la to gd , which suggests that the carrier density systematically decreases from la to gd .",

    "( la@xmath0pdo@xmath1 shows higher resistivity than sm@xmath0pdo@xmath1 .",

    "[ figxr ] . ) since the estimated carrier density is of the order of 1  % per pd , a small cation deficiency of less than 1  % will significantly affect the transport parameters .",
    "the ionic radius of r systematically decreases with increasing atomic number , and the deficiency in the r site will possibly vary with the ionic radius .",
    "a similar example is seen in the parent insulator of high - temperature superconductor bi@xmath0sr@xmath0er@xmath10dy@xmath9cu@xmath0o@xmath34 , in which the carrier density systematically decreases with increasing @xmath35 . @xcite    pdo@xmath1 ( r = la , nd , sm and gd ) and nd@xmath5ce@xmath6pdo@xmath1 .",

    "r@xmath0pdo@xmath1 is a nearly undoped semiconductor with an energy gap between the @xmath14 and @xmath15 bands .",
    "thus we expect a conventional semiconductor physics that the transport properties at high temperatures are of activation type characterized by the band gap , and those at low temperatures are of variable - range - hopping ( vrh ) type .",
    "the crossover will occur when the thermally activated carriers are comparable to the doped carriers in number .",
    "that is , the more carriers are doped , the higher the crossover temperature is .",
    "accordingly , we expect that the activation - type conduction is realized below 300  k for the least doped sample gd@xmath0pdo@xmath1 .",

    "\\label{eqsact }   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] then the resistivity plotted in a log scale and the thermopower plotted in a linear scale are inversely proportional to temperature . as shown in fig .",
    "[ figrrs ] , the data for gd@xmath0pdo@xmath1 roughly obey these relations .",
    "the activation energies are evaluated to be @xmath37=80.7  mev from the resistivity and @xmath38=73.6  mev from the thermopower .",
    "a relation of @xmath39 strongly suggests that the activation process in gd@xmath0pdo@xmath1 is determined by carrier density thermally excited across the band gap . in other words , @xmath39 is the energy gap between the @xmath14 and @xmath15 bands .",
    "since these two bands would be degenerate in the cubic symmetry , the small band gap less than 100  mev evaluated here is reasonable .",
    "we should note here that the relation of @xmath40 is often seen in 3@xmath41 transition - metal oxides , where the carriers distort the lattice nearby through the strong electron - phonon interaction to be stabilized in the potential well of the distorted lattice.@xcite this `` self - trapped '' state is called a ( small ) polaron , and such a material is called a polaronic conductor .",
    "we expect an activation - type conduction in polaronic conductors , where the activation energy comes from the potential well ( the polaron binding energy ) , not from the band gap .",
    "this means that the mobility or the scattering time obeys the activation law .",
    "since the thermopower is independent of the scattering time in the lowest order approximation , @xcite @xmath42 is expected in a polaron semiconductor , where @xmath38 is the band gap and @xmath43 is the polaron binding energy.@xcite in this context , the relation @xmath39 in gd@xmath0pdo@xmath1 is rather unusual in the transition - metal oxides , which implies that a band picture works well to some extent in the 4@xmath41 transition - metal oxides , possibly owing to the broader @xmath44 bands than the @xmath45 bands.@xcite    the other three samples ( la@xmath0pdo@xmath1 , nd@xmath0pdo@xmath1 and sm@xmath0pdo@xmath1 ) are more doped than gd@xmath0pdo@xmath1 , and show the vrh - type transport expressed by @xmath46,\\ ] ] where @xmath41 is the dimension of the system @xcite .",

    "[ figvrh ] the characteristic temperature @xmath49 is a measure of the localization length @xmath50 through @xmath51 , where @xmath52 is the density of states at the fermi energy .",
    "figure  [ figvrh ] shows that @xmath49 is roughly the same among r = la , nd and sm .",
    "since @xmath52 does not change very much with r , the localization length @xmath50 is roughly the same in r@xmath0pdo@xmath1 .",
    "the thermopower of the three samples shows a broad maximum around 100 - 200  k in fig .",
    "[ figrrs](b ) , which is consistent with the vrh picture of a slightly doped semiconductor .",
    "the vrh - type thermopower is given by @xcite @xmath53 accordingly , the sublinear thermopower ( @xmath54 for @xmath47 or @xmath55 for @xmath48 ) is expected at low temperatures , and the activation - type thermopower of eq .",
    "( [ eqsact ] ) is expected at high temperatures .",
    "the broad maximum observed around 100 - 200  k is a sign for the crossover between the two regimes .",

    "thus we partially substituted ce for nd in nd@xmath0pdo@xmath1 to see the doping effects .",
