    "the strong , resonant mg  ii @xmath6 doublet provides a sensitive tracer of gas in the universe , sampling environments over five decades of neutral hydrogen .",

    "lyman limit systems ( sub  lls , @xmath10  @xmath2 ) .",
    "mg  ii also traces the presence of early  epoch star formation , since magnesium is a product of type  ii supernovae ( sne ) , enriching surrounding absorbing gas clouds on time scale of a few myr .",
    "often , fe  ii and c  iv transitions are present in mg  ii `` selected '' systems ; their strengths relative to mg ii and each other vary . the presence of iron in some systems suggests more advanced star formation processes , such as type  ia sne that enrich their surroundings on time scales of a few gyr .",
    "strong c  iv in some systems suggests density structure in the clouds , since fe  ii and c  iv can not simultaneously survive photoionization by the similar radiation fields [ see churchill , et  al .",

    "the population of mg  ii absorbers so  called `` weak systems '' are isolated in redshift , have rest  frame equivalent widths less than 0.3   , and exhibit single clouds with line widths unresolved at hires / keck resolution ( @xmath11  km / s ) . in figure  1",
    ", we present examples of three single  cloud weak systems ( scws ) and one weak mg  ii system with an additional very weak cloud on the blue wing ( @xmath12 ) .",
    "the data been converted to rest  frame wavelengths .    for @xmath13  ",
    ", the equivalent width distribution follows a power law according to @xmath14 .",
    "the redshift path density outnumbers that of lyman ",
    "limit systems by a factor of three ; that is , statistically 65% of _ all _ mg  ii systems are optically thin in neutral hydrogen ( churchill et  al .",
    "this has been verified observationally by measuring the lack of a lyman limit break in many weak systems ( churchill et  al .",
    "details of the results presented here are given in rigby , charlton , & churchill ( 2001 ) . in that work ,",
    "we found two classes of scws : those that are fe  rich and those that are fe  poor ( see figure  2 ) , demarcated by @xmath15 .",
    "we summarize our results as follows :    * the metallicities are greater than @xmath16 .",
    "* the fe  rich systems have a low ionization parameter ( @xmath17 ) of @xmath18 , high density of @xmath19  @xmath2 ( assuming @xmath20 = 0 $ ] ) , and small cloud sizes of @xmath21  pc . * the fe  poor clouds are less constrained and have @xmath22 and @xmath23  @xmath2 ( where can be in range @xmath20 = 0 $ ] to @xmath24 ) , and sizes in the range of @xmath25 . * seven of the 15 systems require multiple ionization phases , due to c  iv and/or lyman  @xmath7 absorption strengths .",
    "because weak systems are optically thin to neutral hydrogen , we know that their maximum allowed @xmath26 is 16.8  @xmath4 . if we enforce the clouds to have no greater than solar metallicity , then the cloud column densities can not be much less than @xmath27  @xmath4 .",
    "allowing for the uncertainty in the slope of the neutral hydrogen column density distribution over this range of column densities ( weymann et  al .",
    "1998 ) , we find that somewhere between 25100% of the @xmath28 lyman  @xmath7 forest is significantly metal enriched ( greater than 0.1 @xmath29 ; also see churchill & le  brun 1998 ) .",
    "if we consider the sub  set of systems which are fe  rich , we find an astronishing result about the spatial number densities , @xmath31 . based upon their redshift number densities , @xmath32 , we find @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the cloud size .",
    "the fe  rich systems have very low ionization conditions ( or the fe  ii would not survive , see figure  3 ) .",
    "this means that @xmath35 and that the clouds have relatively high densities , @xmath36  @xmath2 .",
    "the cloud size scales as @xmath37 . for low ",

    "lyman limit systems , we have @xmath38  pc .",
    "thus , from equation  1 , we find @xmath39 .",
    "galaxies have @xmath40 .",
    "we infer that the ratio of fe  rich weak systems to galaxies is    because of the strong presence of iron and high metallicities , the objects hosting the observed absorption very likely experienced advanced stages of star formation ( i.e.  @xmath41 gyr with contributions from type ia sne ) .",
