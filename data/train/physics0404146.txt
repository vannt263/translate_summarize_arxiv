    "suppose we want to investigate the social behavior of a human community relative to a chosen subject .",
    "we expose the subject by producing a questionnaire with entries containing descriptions of the components of the subject in question .",
    "the questionnaire can be completed in several ways which we shall call _",
    "attitudes_. however , the process of filling in a questionnaire in a specific way is not a deterministic procedure .",
    "usually , the mind of a respondent faces a number of preferences . under casual influence from outside the preferences can change .",
    "hence , the reaction of a respondent is not attached to a particular attitude but depends on the respondent s _ state - of - mind_.    a statement of a respondent selecting an attitude or a state - of - mind shall here be called a _ bit - of - information_.    fix a finite set of frequences and consider photons with frequences from this set . hence the momentum space for these photons",
    "consists of finitely many points and their wave - functions are superpositions of the frequencies .",
    "we create our social model by way of the following substitutions ,    \\1 ) bits - of - information replace photons    \\2 ) attitudes replace frequencies    \\3 ) states - of - mind replace wave - functions .",
    "as we know , the instance of passing from frequencies to wave - functions , and hence from attitudes to states - of - mind , constitutes the essence of the first quantization .",
    "totalities of states - of - mind produce new entities called _",
    "opinions_. then _ states - of - opinion _ emerge as the result of the process of the second quantization which mathematically amounts to the repetition of the one used in constructing a free quantum radiation field ( cf.@xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "hence    \\4 ) states - of - opinion replace quantized radiation fields .    to describe the second quantization we use the algebraic version of the concept of the bose - fock space , the so - called bose algebra ( cf.@xcite ) .",
    "in @xcite states - of - opinion were called information metabolisms .",
    "the observables of the theory are just questions . given a question and a state - of - opinion",
    ", the occupation number formalism provides the expectation of the number of positive answers to the question in a poll performed under the given state - of - opinion ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "we treat bits - of - information circulating in human communities as bosons .",
    "the propagators of those bits - of - information are the individual respondents which , depending on their states - of - mind , provide answers yes or no to questions .",
    "also organizations can get the status of respondents and quality of possessing a state - of - mind .",
    "questions are coupled with orthogonal projections in the space of states - of - mind .",
    "affirmative answers are weighted by the assigned number of energy - bits they carry : electing a member of parliament requires many energy - bits in the form of single votes whereas a shareholder s single vote carries the number of energy - bits equal to the number of owned shares .    in",
    "what follows we shall mainly be interested in superpositions of coherent states - of - opinion .",
    "the coherent states considered in this paper are mathematically identical with those of quantum optics .",
    "they are defined within the polynomial representation of the bose - fock space ( cf.@xcite ) . in the present paper",
    "we restrict ourselves to analysis of states which are superpositions of two coherent states , e.g. the government and the opposition in a democratic country , the original inhabitants of a country and the immigrants , christians and moslems etc .",
    "such states will be called _ bicoherent .",
    "_ we shall show that the bicoherent states depend on two parameters .",
    "the first , the _ interaction coefficient _ , is a number between @xmath0 and @xmath1 measuring the background for communication between respondents of interacting fractions : a common language , traditions , religion , interest etc .",
    "the second one is called the _",
    "superposition constant_.    in a simple model constructed in section [ model ] , the superposition constant plays a double role - if it is greater or equal to one , it prevents interaction blocking the influence of the interaction coefficient .",
    "if negative , it controls regions of high and low frequencies of affirmation to questions asked in the superposition state - of - opinion .",
    "moreover , under high interaction a sudden critical switch of opinion can occur in consequence of a minimal change of the superposition constant ( cf .",
    "remark [ switch ] ) .",
    "we also investigate change of opinion under temporary influence of some outside factors ( as for instance election campaigns ) .",
    "it is shown that such a temporary influence diminishes high amplitudes ( cf .",
    "remark [ influence ] ) .",
    "the authors are much indebted to krista graversen for her help in editing this paper .",
    "also the first of the authors wishes to express his gratitude for the hospitality of the institute for mathematical behavioral sciences at uci .",
    "discussions with members of the institute considerably influenced the form of this paper .",
    "david bulger pointed out some inaccuracies in our presentation of the bargmann fock - space representation .",
    "we are grateful for his contribution .",
    "a selected sub - population characterized by a collection of _ attitudes _ will here be called a _",
    "profile_. for example the body of parliament members of a democratic country constitutes a profile .",
    "the attitudes will represent different political affiliations .",
    "the states - of - mind will then concern actual political problems .",
    "also the government and its members can be considered as a profile . here",
    "the set of attitudes will include different policies .",
    "for the profile of workers , the relevant attitudes will be concerned with the unions .    hence , the same physical population consists of several different profiles .",
    "profiles connected with a profession is easiest revealed by asking a question to which the answer  yes  selects the states - of - mind of the profession .",
    "for example , the question  do you have a valid certificate qualifying you as a physician ?",
    " automatically extracts the profile of medical doctors .",
    "an examination will filter respondents of the profile of a particular profession .",
    "the whole population itself constitutes a profile as well .",
    "consider a community familiar with subjects which can be presented in a list of statements .",
    "the statements can be accepted or rejected by members of the community . in what follows",
    "we refer to this list of statements as a _ questionnaire . _",
    "the term  questionnaire  should not be taken literally .",
    "for instance , a questionnaire may consist of a set of examination questions but it can as well be an ordinary questionnaire prepared for a poll .    a copy of a completed questionnaire shall be called an _ attitude_. the quantum mechanical counterpart of an attitude is a frequency .",
    "hence the quantum mechanical equivalence of a space of attitudes is a momentum space consisting of finitely many frequencies .",
    "take a space of attitudes consisting of @xmath2 attitudes @xmath3 .",

    "given another vector from @xmath13@xmath14 we define the inner product ( hermitian form ) setting @xmath15 so that @xmath16 is an orthonormal basis in @xmath10 and each vector @xmath4 from @xmath10 can be written in the form @xmath17 then @xmath18 we shall write @xmath19 for the length of the vector @xmath4 , @xmath20    a vector @xmath4 is called a _ state - of - mind _ if @xmath21 we do not distinguish between states provided by @xmath4 and @xmath22 .",
    "briefly we shall write @xmath23 for the state - of - mind corresponding to the vector @xmath24    if a respondent is in the state - of - mind @xmath25 his attitude will be @xmath6 with probability @xmath26 i.e. to the question  which is your attitude ?",
    " he will name the attitude @xmath6 with probability @xmath27    the ( real ) vector space @xmath10 shall be called the space of states - of - mind ( as yet we have no interpretation for the process of multiplication by the imaginary unit @xmath28 ) .    continuing the analogy with photons , the space @xmath10 of states - of - mind is the counterpart of the space of wave - functions ( the state - space for photons ) depending on fixed finite number of frequencies .",

    "carries a number of energy - bits depending on the nature of the corresponding model .",

    "the second quantization provides a formalism by use of which the parallel notions on the level of profiles can be defined ( cf.@xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the counterpart of the notion of attitude attached to an individual member of a community will be the notion of opinion attached to a group of individuals .",
    "similarly the counterpart of the notion of state - of - mind attached to a respondent will be the notion of state - of - opinion attached to a profile ( which can as well be the whole community ) .",
    "as a state - of - mind assigns a number to every possible attitude , a state - of - opinion will assign a number to every possible opinion of a profile , i.e. the states - of - opinion are functions over the space of opinions .",

    "say the government has majority : @xmath278 a small negative weight @xmath157 attached to @xmath162 yields not much contribution itself but by way of the interaction it provokes the other fraction to vote . similarly if @xmath279 then the increase of negative answers is provoked .",
    "still higher negative weight yields the reversed status - the respondents from @xmath162 take over and in the first case cause a decrease and in the second case an increase of affirmation .",
    "these unusual variations can happen only in the presence of high interaction and in small intervals of negative @xmath157 and hence will seldom occur in real life .",
    "however , such jumps in the distribution of votes have been observed in the past ( cf.@xcite ) ."
