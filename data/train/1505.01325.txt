    "it must be stressed that there is no way to find the accurate values for the inconsistent input . by the definition",
    ", every approximation has an approximation error .",
    "the approximation error , in inaccurate data , is the discrepancy between an exact value and some approximation of it .",
    "the approximation error is commonly used in science and engineering as a percentage of what we approximate . by reducing inconsistencies , a clearly undesirable property in every system , the estimation error disappears since there is no approximation error for fully consistent pc matrices .",
    "the exact solution for the consistent pc matrix is the geometric mean which also happens to be the principal eigenvector .",

    "the distance - based _ inconsistency index _ was proposed in @xcite as :    @xmath32    for all triads @xmath33 specified by the consistency condition .",
    "it has been simplified in @xcite to :    @xmath34    which is equivalent to :    @xmath35    the expression @xmath36 is the distance of a triad @xmath37 from 0",

    "it is important to notice here that this definition allows us to localize the inconsistency in a pc matrix and it is of a considerable importance for most applications .",
    "for a given pc matrix @xmath8 , let us denote the vector of arithmetic means of rows by @xmath39 and the vector of geometric means by @xmath40 .",
    "a vector of geometric means of rows of a given matrix @xmath8 has a very natural interpretation .",
    "it is transformed into a vector of arithmetic means by a logarithmic mapping .",
    "the arithmetic mean has several properties that make it useful for a measure of central tendency .",
    "colloquially , measures of central tendency are often called averages . for values @xmath41",
    ", we have a mean @xmath42 , for which : @xmath43 we may consider that the values to the left of the mean are balanced by the values to the right of the mean since @xmath44 is the distance from a given number to the mean .",
    "the mean is the only value for which the residuals ( deviations from the estimate ) sum to zero .",
    "when we are restricted to a single value for representing a set of known values @xmath45 , the arithmetic mean may be used since it minimizes the sum of squared deviations from the typical value : the sum of @xmath46 . in other words ,",
    "the sample mean is also the best predictor in the sense of having the lowest root mean squared error .",
    "means were analyzed in @xcite and in @xcite .",
    "it is difficult to state when exactly the logarithmic mapping was used for pc matrices as an alternative method for scaling priorities in hierarchical structures .",
    "however , it is usually attributed to jensen .",
    "his results in @xcite occur in the same journal in which @xcite was published .",
    "numerous subsequent monte carlo experiments have validated jensen s findings ( e.g. , @xcite used 1,000,000 matrices ) .    for a matrix @xmath8 with positive coordinates ,",
    "we define the matrix @xmath47 such that @xmath48 .",

    "it implies that : @xmath55 and @xmath56    if @xmath8 is consistent , then elements of @xmath47 satisfy @xmath57 for every @xmath17 .",

    "this indicates that @xmath61 and @xmath62 are perpendicular vectors . in other words , if a triad is inconsistent , an orthogonal projection onto subspace perpendicular to the vector @xmath60 in the space @xmath63 makes it consistent .",
    "such projections can be expressed by : @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the inner product of vectors @xmath66 and @xmath67 in @xmath68 +    it holds : @xmath69 hence @xmath70 , +    where :    @xmath71\\ ] ]    _ remark_. a given inconsistent triad @xmath33 can be transformed into a consistent triad in the following three ways :    @xmath72 for a multiplicatively inconsistent triad @xmath73 its transformation to the consistent triad @xmath74 is given by : @xmath75 the above formulas were used in @xcite for a monte carlo experimentation with the convergence of inconsistency by the sequence of inconsistency reductions of the most inconsistent triad .",
    "the @xmath76-th step of the algorithm used in @xcite transforms the most inconsistent triad @xmath77 of a given matrix @xmath78 into @xmath79 according to the formulas ( [ ortho1]),([ortho2]),([ortho3 ] ) .",

    "the coordinates of @xmath83 may change only for the @xmath84-th , @xmath85-th and the @xmath86-th position .",
    "however , an elementary calculation shows that @xmath87 .",
    "this proves that @xmath88        theorem 4 in @xcite ( copied as it is for the traditional reasons and presented by fig .",
    "[ fig : th4 ] ) states that : @xmath78 is convergent to the orthogonal projection of @xmath89 onto the linear space of additively consistent matrices . from the above theorem and ( [ amn ] ) ,",

    "orthogonal transformations may be indefinite for @xmath121 but the convergence is very quick , as demonstrated by @xcite and usually , fewer than 10 steps are needed in most applications . for an inconsistent matrix , we find the most inconsistent triad ( according to @xmath122 ) and by using the three expressions for the orthogonal projection , we make it consistent .",
    "the idea of the algorithm is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : orthogproj ] .",
    "we only need one step for a pc matrix @xmath123 since there is only one triad and changing it does not influence `` other triads '' .",

    "it is not evident for @xmath124 how the propagation may go .",

    "this study finally closes the ongoing ( since 1983 when @xcite was published ) dispute whether the principal eigenvector or a vector of geometric means is a better approximation for an inconsistent pc matrix .",
    "for fully consistent pairwise comparisons matrices , such dispute has no scientific merits since the principal eigenvector @xmath126 is equal to the vector @xmath127 of geometric means of rows . for inconsistent pairwise comparisons , numerous monte carlo experiments ( starting with the first study @xcite and with",
    "1,000,000 analyzed cases in @xcite ) demonstrated that , for the euclidean distance , @xmath128generated approximation of @xmath8 is ( on average ) not as close as the one generated by @xmath127 .",
    "the difference between @xmath127 and @xmath126 approximations is not of noticeable significance from the application point of view for `` not - so - inconsistent '' ( nsi ) pc matrices ( nsi concept was introduced in @xcite ) .",
    "if the difference is small , why bother ?",
    "the difference between newton s law of universal gravitation and the theory of relativity is small yet one can miss a planet .",
    "in fact , the accuracy of approximation is not really of great importance considering that the input ( ofter highly subjective ) may be inconsistent and plus / minus 10% accuracy would be more of a dream than reality .",
    "often , @xmath126 and @xmath127 differ by the third or second decimal digit while the significance of even the first decimal digit of the input data may be questioned .",
    "it is the inconsistency improvement which really contributes to the approximation accuracy improvement .",
    "for this reason , the convergence of the inconsistency improvement to the vector of geometric means ; not to the principal eigenvector , is of the fundamental importance , not only to finally conclude the ongoing ( since 1984 ) dispute what is ( or not ) better but also for practical applications .",
    "geometric means can be computer with a pocket calculator ( gnumerics and excel are even easier to use ) while computing the principal eigenvector is not as easy as computing geometric means .",
    "an eigenvalue perturbation problem exists and finding the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of a system that is perturbed from known eigenvectors and eigenvalues is not a trivial problem to handle .",

    "<S> this study investigates a powerful model , targeted to subjective assessments , based on pairwise comparisons . </S>",
    "<S> it provides a proof that a distance - based inconsistency reduction transforms an inconsistent pairwise comparisons ( pc ) matrix into a consistent pc matrix which is generated by the geometric means of rows of a given inconsistent pc matrix . </S>",
    "<S> the distance - based inconsistency indicator was defined in 1993 for pairwise comparisons . </S>",
    "<S> its convergence was analyzed in 1996 ( regretfully , with an incomplete proof ; finally completed in 2010 ) . </S>",
    "<S> however , there was no clear interpretation of the convergence limit which is of considerable importance for applications and this study does so . </S>",
    "<S> this study finally ends the ongoing ( since 1984 ) dispute on the approximation method for the inconsistent pairwise comparisons . </S>",
    "<S> the convergence limit is the vector of geometric means . </S>",
    "<S> it is not the principal right eigenvector of a given pc matrix .    </S>",
    "<S> keywords : pairwise comparisons , inconsistency reduction , convergence limit , decision making , assessment , software development . </S>"
