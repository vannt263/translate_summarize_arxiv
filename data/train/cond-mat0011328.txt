    "the transport phenomena under the magnetic field are very important and interesting field in condensed matter physics .",
    "especially , the magnetoresistance ( mr ) is of current interest : it has been attracting great attentions of many researchers because it gives us rich information on the electronic structure of the system",
    ". there are several possible mechanisms of the mr , for example , ( i ) the lorentz force on conduction electrons ( orbital effect ) , ( ii ) the double - exchange mechanism ( spin effect ) , and ( iii ) the anderson localization mechanism in dirty metals , or the kondo effect caused by the magnetic impurities .",
    "it is well - known that the huge negative mr due to ( ii ) is realized in mn - oxides at the ferromagnetic transition temperature , i.e. , the colossal magnetoresistance .",
    "the negative mr due to ( iii ) is observed in dirty semiconductors .    on the other hand , in usual pure paramagnetic metals ,",
    "the _ positive _ mr due to ( i ) is the most dominant , which is called the orbital mr .",
    "there is a long - history on the study of the orbital mr based on the boltzmann transport theory @xcite . in many theoretical studies , the collision term in the boltzmann equation",
    "is simply approximated by introducing the phenomenological relaxation time ( @xmath3 ) , which is called the relaxation time approximation ( rta ) .",
    "there , the correlation effect between particle - hole pair is totally dropped .",
    "although rta is a quasiclassical approximation , various important and useful results have been obtained .",
    "for example , the mr as a function of the angle between @xmath4 and @xmath5 in various metals was reproduced within the rta @xcite .",
    "especially , the kohler s rule is one of the most essential relations derived by the rta : according to this rule , the conductivity @xmath6 in the magnetic field @xmath4 is represented in the functional form @xmath7 , if the anisotropy of @xmath3 is not so large . according to the onsager s reciprocity theorem ,",
    "@xmath8 is an even - function of @xmath9 as for the diagonal conductivity ( @xmath10 ) , and it is an odd - function as for the off - diagonal conductivity ( @xmath11 ) .    by definition , the resistance without the magnetic filed ( @xmath12 ) ,",
    "the hall coefficient ( @xmath13 ) , and the magnetoresistance ( @xmath14 ) , are given by @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the diagonal conductivity without @xmath4 .",
    "@xmath17 and @xmath18 are components proportional to @xmath19 and @xmath20 , respectively .",
    "we call @xmath18 the magnetoconductivity ( mc ) . as a result , the kohler s rule predicts the relations @xmath21 , @xmath22 , and @xmath23 .",
    "these relations are well satisfied in various ordinary metals , which may be interpreted as nearly free electron systems .",
    "interestingly , however , the kohler s rule is strongly violated in several strongly correlated metals according to recent experimental studies .",
    "for example , @xmath13 in the normal state in high-@xmath2 cuprates is approximately proportional to @xmath24 , and @xmath25 .",
    "these _ seemingly _ non - fermi liquid behaviors of the transport phenomena in high-@xmath2 cuprates have been studied as a central issue both theoretically and experimentally because they should reflect the fundamental electronic property of high-@xmath2 cuprates .    up to now , several authors have studied the transport phenomena in high-@xmath2 cuprates based on the rta , and claimed that the strong anisotropy of @xmath26 can explain the observed violation of the kohler s rule .",
    "@xcite . however , its effect is too insufficient to reproduce the prominent non - fermi liquid behaviors observed for wider range of temperatures . on the other hand",
    ", we recently studied the @xmath13 in high-@xmath2 cuprates based on the general formula for @xmath17 derived by ref.@xcite , which is formally exact of order @xmath27 .",
    "then , we find out that the vertex corrections for the current , which are dropped in the rta , cause the curie - weiss like behavior of @xmath13 in the presence of af fluctuations @xcite .    the aim of this paper is to derive the _",
    "general expression for the mc _ from the kubo formula .",
    "the obtained expression for @xmath18 , which is formally exact in order @xmath28 , contains all the vertex corrections which ensure the conserving laws . in the system with strong correlations ,",
    "the role of the vertex corrections will qualitatively change the behavior of the mr , as it does for the hall effect . in this respect ,",
    "the rta is unreliable because all the current vertex corrections are neglected there .",
    "based on the derived expression , we will study the mr in high-@xmath2 cuprates and discuss the violation of kohler s rule in later publications @xcite .    in the absence of the magnetic field , eliashberg derived in 1961 the expression for the conductivity of the fermi liquid system from the kubo formula @xcite : @xmath29 which is exact up to @xmath30 .",
    "@xmath31 means the two - dimensional integration on the fermi surfaces , and @xmath32 in the cubic lattice .",
    "@xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the self - energy .",
    "@xmath35 is the quasiparticle velocity without the renormalization factor @xmath36 .",
    "moreover , @xmath37 has the four - point vertex correction @xmath38 , which is not given by the self - energy through the ward identity .",
    "( @xmath39 is given by eq.([eqn : j2 ] ) in this paper . )",
    "this non - trivial current vertex correction from @xmath38 is indispensable to avoid unphysical results .",
    "for instance , yamada and yosida proved that @xmath40 given by eq.([eqn : eliashberg ] ) diverges unless any umklapp scattering processes exist , reflecting the momentum conservation law @xcite .",
    "this physically reasonable result can not be reproduced if we drop the vertex correction from @xmath38 .",
    "the exact expression for the hall conductivity of order @xmath27 was given by kohno - yamada as follows : @xcite @xmath41   ( 2\\tau_{\\bf k})^2   ,   \\label{eqn : kohno}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the uniform magnetic field is along the @xmath42-axis . here",
    "the carrier of an electron is @xmath43 ( @xmath44 ) .",
    "note that if we replace @xmath45 with @xmath46 in eqs .",
    "( [ eqn : eliashberg ] ) and ( [ eqn : kohno ] ) , we get the results of the rta .    as for @xmath17 ,",
    "the vertex corrections in @xmath37 also play important roles in strongly correlated systems .",
    "in fact , according to recent theoretical studies , the vertex corrections in @xmath37 give rise to the strong enhancement of @xmath13 in nearly af fermi liquids , like in high-@xmath2 superconductors or in @xmath47-(bedt - ttf ) organic superconductors @xcite .",
    "noteworthily , @xmath13 becomes negative in electron - doped compounds irrespective of the fact that its fermi surface is hole - like everywhere @xcite .",
    "this long - standing mystery , which can not be explained within the rta , is naturally reproduced in refs . @xcite and @xcite due to the fact that @xmath48 is no more parallel to @xmath49 .",
