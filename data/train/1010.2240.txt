    "dwarf elliptical galaxies ( des ) are the most common galaxy type in the nearby universe , accounting , for about 75% of all objects in the virgo cluster ( e.g. trentham & tully 2002 ) . as potential building blocks of massive galaxies ( in the current hierarchical galaxy formation paradigm ) ,",
    "des may provide important clues on the main processes involved in galaxy assembly and evolution . a detailed analysis of structural properties , internal kinematics and stellar populations",
    "is , therefore , essential to understanding the evolutionary properties of this class of objects .",
    "we observed four virgo and one field galaxy during 3 nights in january 2010 using the sauron instrument mounted on the 4.2 m william herschel telescope at the observatorio del roque de los muchachos in la palma , spain .",
    "the average exposure time was 5h per galaxy .",
    "additionaly , we used the wht auxiliary camera acam to obtain deep images ( 300s ) for each object .",
    "we used the penalized pixel fitting ( ppxf ) method of capellari and emselem ( 2004 ) to derive stellar absorption line kinematics for each galaxy by directly fitting the spectra in the pixel space .",
    "we used absorption spectra taken from the single - burst stellar population models of vazdekis ( 1999 ) .",
    "we find one rotating galaxy with misaligned photometric and kinematic major axes , indicating the presence of a bar ( see fig .",
    "[ map ] ) .",
    "our field galaxy , ngc 3073 , also shows signs of rotation .",
    "two out of three of our objects that do not appear to rotate are significantly flattened ( vcc 1087 and vcc 1261 ) , we speculate that they might be triaxial systems .",
    "we used the ulyss full spectrum fitting package of koleva et al .",
    "( 2009 ) together with pegase.hr/elodie.3.1 models ( prugniel et al .",
    "2007 ) to estimate ages and metallicities ( @xmath0 ) of our objects .",
    "we fitted 1-ssp models to obtain equivalent ages and @xmath0 and found significant gradients in at least one of the objects ( vcc 1261 ) .",

    "<S> dwarf elliptical galaxies are the most common galaxy type in nearby galaxy clusters , yet they remain relatively poorly studied objects and many of their basic properties have yet to be quantified . in this contribution we present the preliminary results of a study of 4 virgo and 1 field galaxy obtained with the sauron integral field unit on the william herschel telescope ( la palma ) . while traditional long - slit observations are likely to miss more complicated kinematic features , with sauron we are able to study both kinematics and stellar populations in two dimensions , obtaining a much more detailed view of the mass distribution and star formation histories . </S>"
