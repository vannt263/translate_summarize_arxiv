    "in this paper , we consider the question if , and how , a homogeneous cauchy stress tensor can be generated by non - homogeneous finite deformations . without assuming invertibility of the cauchy stress tensor",
    ", this question was first addressed in the recent article @xcite , where compatible non - homogeneous finite plane deformations with a constant cauchy stress on a rectangular domain were identified , and an example of an isotropic strain energy function was provided , such that , for a material described by this function and occupying a domain similar to those analysed , the homogeneous stress and the corresponding non - homogeneous strains could be given explicitly .",
    "as the energy function in this example was not rank - one convex , it could correspond to materials capable of undergoing phase transitions @xcite .    in isotropic linear elasticity ,",

    "the corresponding stress - strain law is @xmath9 this relation is invertible if and only if the shear modulus satisfies @xmath10 , and similarly the bulk modulus satisfies @xmath11 .    when @xmath12 is given , @xmath13 is uniquely determined , and moreover , if @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the set of symmetric matrices , then @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the set of skew - symmetric matrices .",
    "this implies @xmath18 hence @xmath19 , and therefore @xmath20 @xcite .",
    "thus , a constant stress tensor @xmath12 implies the following representation for the displacement field @xmath21\\textbf{x}+\\overline{\\textbf{b}},\\label{eq : linu}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath22 is arbitrary and @xmath23 is an arbitrary constant translation .",
    "hence , the homogeneous displacement is uniquely determined , up to infinitesimal rigid body rotations and translations , from the constant stress field @xmath12 .    in nonlinear elasticity , for a homogeneous isotropic hyperelastic body under finite strain deformation , the cauchy stress tensor can be represented as follows @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the left cauchy - green tensor , with the tensor @xmath26 representing the deformation gradient , and the coefficients : @xmath27 are scalar functions of the strain invariants : @xmath28=\\mathrm{tr}\\left(\\textrm{cof}\\ \\textbf{b}\\right),\\qquad i_{3}(\\textbf{b})=\\det\\textbf{b},\\ ] ] with @xmath29 the strain energy density function describing the properties of the isotropic hyperelastic material @xcite .",
    "when the material is incompressible , the cauchy stress takes the form @xmath30 where @xmath31 is an arbitrary hydrostatic pressure .",

    "we construct examples of such deformations on a cuboid domain , where the deformations are continuous and homogeneous in two different parts of the domain , which can only be separated by a plane interface , and the homogeneous deformations corresponding to the two phases are rank - one connected .",

    "<S> in isotropic finite elasticity , unlike in the linear elastic theory , a homogeneous cauchy stress may be induced by non - homogeneous strains . to illustrate this , we identify compatible non - homogeneous three - dimensional deformations producing a homogeneous cauchy stress on a cuboid geometry , and provide an example of an isotropic hyperelastic material , which is not rank - one convex , and for which the homogeneous stress and the associated non - homogeneous strains on a domain similar to those analysed are given explicitly . + </S>",
