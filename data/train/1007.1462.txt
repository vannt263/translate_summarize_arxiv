    "the statistical properties of primordial fluctuations provide crucial information on the physics of the very early universe @xcite ( see @xcite for a review ) . in the simplest single field inflation models where the scalar field has a canonical kinetic term and quantum fluctuations are generated from the standard bunch - davis vacuum , non - gaussianity of the fluctuations is too small to be observed even with future experiments @xcite .",
    "thus the detection of non - negligible departures from gaussinaity of primordial fluctuations will have a huge impact on the models of early universe .",
    "so far , most of the studies have focused on the leading order non - gaussianity measured by the three - point function of cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) anisotropies , i.e. the bispectrum @xcite . especially , the optical method of extracting the bispectrum from the cmb data has been sufficiently developed @xcite ( for a more general approach , see @xcite ) .",
    "however , future experiments like planck @xcite can also prove the higher order statistics such as the trispectrum @xcite .",
    "the trispectrum gives information that can not be obtained from the bispectrum @xcite .",
    "in addition , it is possible that the trispectrum can be the leading order non - gaussianity , that is , even if we do not detect the bispectrum , this does not mean that the primordial fluctuations are confirmed to be gaussian .    in the local type non - gaussian models @xcite ,",
    "the primordial curvature perturbation @xmath6 is modeled as @xmath7 where @xmath8 is a gaussian variable @xcite . in this model",
    ", the bispectrum has maximum amplitude for the squeezed configurations in the fourie space where one of wavenumbers is small compared with others . in these models",
    ", the trispectrum indeed gives very interesting tests on multi - field inflation models where there are several gaussian variables @xmath9 using the consistency relation between the amplitudes of the bispectrum and trispectrum @xcite .",
    "also the trispectrum can constrain the cubic - order non - linearities in primordial curvature perturbation , @xmath10 that can not be constrained by the bispectrum measurements . estimators to measure the trispectrum in the local - type non - gaussianity have been developed and the kurtosis based estimator @xcite have been used to obtain constraints on the amplitude of the trispectrum , @xmath11 at @xmath12 confidence level from the wmap 5-year data @xcite .",
    "there are another class of non - gaussian models .",
    "a typical example is dirac - born - infled ( dbi ) inflation @xcite whose non - gaussian property was extensively studied by @xcite ( see also @xcite for reviews ) . in this model , like k - inflation @xcite , the inflaton field has non - canonical kinetic term and non - linear derivative interactions can give rise to large non - gaussianity of quantum fluctuations . for current observational constraints on dbi inflation",
    "see @xcite . in these models ,",
    "the amplitude of the bispectrum has a peak typically for the equilateral configuration in the fourie space .",
    "the shape of the trispectrum is more complicated .",
    "for example , for the bispectrum , the equilateral condition @xmath13 completely specifies the shape of the bisepctrum , but this is not the case for the trispectrum .",
    "the shape of the trispectrum has been analyzed in several inflationary models such as single field dbi inflation @xcite , multi - field dbi inflation @xcite and the models motivated by effective theory of inflation @xcite .",
    "regardless of these efforts , since the form of the trispectrum is generally very complicated , estimators for the trispectrum in this class of non - gaussian models have not been implemented yet so far .",
    "it was suggested that the form of trispectrum given by @xmath14 represents the shape of the trispectrum in equilateral non - gaussian models very well . here",
    "the trispectrum of the curvature perturbation is defined as @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the power spectrum given by @xmath17 .",
    "this trispectrum ( [ fiducial ] ) appears in dbi inflation as a contribution from the fourth order interacting hamiltonian ( the  contact interaction \" ) @xcite . in the effective theory of inflation ,",
    "it was shown that the trispectrum of this shape can have the amplitude that is not constrained by the bispectrum measurements @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , it was suggested that this trispectrum can be used to construct an estimator because by introducing the integral @xmath18 , this function is factorisable ( see appendix a ) . therefore , in this paper , we compare the shapes of trispectra in single field and multi - field dbi inflation with eq .",

    "we find that in terms of these variables @xmath28 is expressed as @xmath29 which implies that the valid range of @xmath30 is constrained by @xmath31    motivated by the relation between the cmb trispectrum and the trispectrum for @xmath6 , the shape function for the reduced trispectrum is defined as @xmath32 regan et al .",
    "@xcite proposed to define an overlap between two different shape functions @xmath33 and @xmath34 as @xmath35 where @xmath36 is an appropriate weight function .",
    "the weight function should be chosen such that @xmath37 in @xmath38 space produces the same scaling as the estimator in @xmath39 space and we adopt the one used in ref .",

( [ pritrispectrum_correlator_part ] ) , for scale - invariant shape functions with constant @xmath73 , it is enough to evaluate shape correlations only for the four dimensional slices with constant @xmath44 .",

    "( [ fiducial ] ) and the trispectra in single field and multi - field dbi inflation .",
    "it is worth mentioning that from the definition of the shape correlator ( [ pritrispectrum_correlator ] ) , the shape correlations are independent of the normalisations of shape functions .",
    "we will discuss the normalisation of the trispectrum in the next section .",

    "it is clear that these shapes have significantly low correlations which explain the reason why the final correlation between the shapes in the equilateral model and the multi - field dbi models is lower than the single field model .",
    "in this section , we explain our method to compare the amplitudes of the bispectrum using the overlap integration .",
    "we introduce the shape function @xmath275 @xmath276 for the bispectrum of the curvature perturbation @xmath277 defined by @xmath278    in @xcite , it was shown that at leading order in the slow roll expansion and small sound speed limit , shape function for the bispectrum in the single field dbi inflation is given by @xmath279 where @xmath280 .",

    "( [ pribispectrum_correlator_part ] ) the integration is performed for the region where the triangle condition for @xmath287 holds and weight function @xmath288 is given by @xmath289    for these two slightly different shapes , it would be enough to match the amplitudes of the bispectra evaluated at the equilateral configuration ( @xmath13 ) where the amplitude have a peak by setting the relation ( [ fnl_dbi_conv ] ) .",
    "however , it is more appropriate to match the amplitude and shape of the bispectra by taking into account all possible configurations . in this context",

    "<S> we investigate an estimator to measure the primordial trispectrum in equilateral type non - gaussian models such as k - inflation , single field dbi inflation and multi - field dbi inflation models from cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) anisotropies . </S>",
    "<S> the shape of the trispectrum whose amplitude is not constrained by the bispectrum in the context of effective theory of inflation and k - inflation is known to admit a separable form of the estimator for cmb anisotropies . </S>",
    "<S> we show that this shape is @xmath0 correlated with the full quantum trispectrum in single field dbi inflation , while it is @xmath1 correlated with the one in multi - field dbi inflation when curvature perturbation is originated from purely entropic contribution . </S>",
    "<S> this suggests that @xmath2 , the amplitude of this particular shape , provides a reasonable measure of the non - gaussianity from the trispectrum in equilateral non - gaussian models . </S>",
    "<S> we relate model parameters such as the sound speed , @xmath3 and the transfer coefficient from entropy perturbations to the curvature perturbation , @xmath4 with @xmath2 , which enables us to constrain model parameters in these models once @xmath5 is measured in wmap and planck . </S>"
