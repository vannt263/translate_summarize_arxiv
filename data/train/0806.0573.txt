    "for a conventional two - dimensional electron gas ( 2deg )  created in a semiconductor heterostructure , theoretical calculations show that , in the presence of a strong perpendicular magnetic field , a wigner crystal ( wc)state has lower energy then the fractional quantum hall liquids for filling factors @xmath7@xcite .",
    "transport measurements indicative of this electron crystallization has been reported by several groups@xcite@xmath8 these measurements include the observation of a strong increase in the diagonal resistivity @xmath9 non - linear @xmath10 characteristics , and broadband noise .",
    "another series of experiments involving microwave absorption @xcite have also detected a resonance in the real part of the longitudinal conductivity , @xmath11 , that has been attributed to the pinning mode of a disordered wc .",
    "such a resonance was observed not only at small filling factor @xmath7 in the lowest landau level but also at small filling factor in the higher landau levels where the formation of a quasiparticle solid is expected in a clean sample . in higher landau levels , a study of the evolution of the pinning mode with filling factor reveals several transitions of the two - dimensional electron gas ground state from a wigner crystal at low @xmath6 to a series of bubble crystals with increasing number of electrons per lattice site as @xmath6 is increased , and into a modulated stripe state ( or anisotropic wigner crystal ) near half fillingfogler,@xcite .    in a conventional 2deg , the landau level energy spectrum is given by @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the cyclotron frequency with @xmath14 the effective mass .",
    "each of these levels is highly degenerate , so that a partially filled landau level is dominated by electron - electron interactions and is expected to enter a crystal state .",
    "similar physics is expected to occur in graphene . in a strong perpendicular magnetic field , there is also a series of highly degenerate landau levels , with energies given by @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the fermi velocity .",
    "in two recent papers , zhang and joglekar@xcite , joglekar2 have explored the possibility of wigner crystallization in graphene ( including bubbles and stripes ) in the presence of a quantizing magnetic field . while the situations in the presence of a field are similar for the conventional 2deg and graphene , in the absence of a field they are likely to be different . at low densities , electrons in the former system",
    "are believed to form a wigner crystal",
    ". however , graphene in zero field has a gapless non - interacting spectrum , so that an arrangement of electrons into a two - dimensional lattice can not create effective potentials which localize the individual electrons .",
    "this klein paradox  physics@xcite undermines the stability of the wigner crystal . in a magnetic field",
    ", however , the kinetic energy contains a series of gaps , and the physics of the 2deg is dominated by the coulomb interaction alone . a magnetic - field induced wigner solid is thus expected @xcite .    in the hartree - fock approximation ( hfa ) , the potential energy depends on the effective hartree , @xmath17 and fock , @xmath18 interactions defined in landau level @xmath19 to an excellent approximation@xcite , these effective interactions for @xmath20 are identical to that of a conventional 2deg so that the hfa phase diagram should be the same in both systems . to develop the analogy further",
    ", we use a pseudospin language in which the two non - equivalent valleys @xmath21 and @xmath22 of graphene ( the valence and conduction bands in graphene touch at two inequivalent points @xmath23 and @xmath24 and four other points or valleys related by symmetry ) are mapped to the valley pseudospin @xmath25 states .",
    "if we assume that the real spins are completely polarized in the graphene system , then , for @xmath26 , the hf hamiltonian for the 2deg in graphene is identical to that of a conventional 2deg _ with zero zeeman coupling_. for @xmath27 , however , the effective interactions are not identical . on this basis , we can expect that pseudospin skyrmion crystals are possible in graphene around filling factor @xmath28 in a conventional 2deg , skyrmion crystals are restricted to the lowest landau level only but this may not be the case in graphene . indeed , recently yang , das sarma and macdonald have shown that skyrmions are the lowest - energy charged excitations in graphene for landau levels up to @xmath29@xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we explore the possibility of skyrmion crystals near integer filling in each landau level , and compare their stability and collective mode properties to those of wigner crystal states@xcite .",
    "because there is no effective zeeman coupling in graphene , the ground state is generically a crystal of merons rather than of skyrmions , as it is also the case in the conventional 2deg@xcite .",
    "we then compute the collective mode dispersions in the wigner and meron crystal phases .",
    "we show that the approximate su(2 ) symmetry of the hamiltonian leads for a wigner crystal to a quadratically dispersing valley - pseudospin gapless mode in addition to the phonon mode present in the conventional 2deg . in the meron crystal , we find instead three new gapless modes with linear dispersions in addition to the phonon mode .",
    "in graphene , these modes represent charge fluctuations between the sublattices instead of spin fluctuations as in a conventional 2deg and so we speculate that they may be visible in microwave absorption experiments .",
    "each crystal structure , wigner or skyrme , may thus have a unique signature in microwave absorption , in contrast to wigner and spin skyrmion crystals in conventional 2deg s where the absorption spectrum does not distinguish between these two structures .",
    "this paper is organized in the following way .",
