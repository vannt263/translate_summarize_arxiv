    "exclusive ( e , e@xmath1pp ) reactions on nuclei have recently been added to the rich set of tools exploring the nucleus with the electromagnetic interaction@xcite .",
    "it is expected that this new tool may finally be able to clarify the nature and influence of short - range correlations ( src ) in low - energy nuclear phenomena .",
    "several early theoretical papers  @xcite established a link between two - nucleon removal cross sections and the two - nucleon density matrix  @xcite or the two - nucleon spectral function  @xcite which contain information related to src . a somewhat different perspective to this issue has been explored in refs.@xcite .",
    "the anticipated availability of this reaction generated renewed theoretical interest  @xcite in the reaction description and the calculation of the two - nucleon spectral function . in a series of publications",
    "@xcite a reaction description of electron- and photon - induced two - nucleon emission processes has been established .",
    "indeed , it appears from these studies that the most promising reaction to study short - range phenomena involves the ( e , e@xmath1pp ) channel , where the effect of meson - exchange currents and @xmath7-isobars is less dominant as compared to the ( e , e@xmath1pn ) and ( @xmath9,nn ) processes .    in its most recent form",
    "@xcite the description of the ( e , e@xmath1pp ) excitation process includes the contribution of the usual one - body terms as well as those two - body currents which involve the intermediate excitation of the @xmath7-isobar .",
    "the de - excitation of the @xmath7 after absorption of the photon or the excitation of the @xmath7 before absorption of the photon proceeds by exchange of a pion with another nucleon . in the present work",
    "an improvement of the dynamic aspects of the propagation of the @xmath7-isobar is taken into account  @xcite .",
    "a treatment of @xmath7-propagation involving the exchange of rho - mesons is not included at present .",
    "the treatment of the final state interaction of the outgoing protons with the remaining nucleus is treated by neglecting their mutual interaction but including the distorting effect of their interaction with the remaining nucleons in terms of an optical potential .",
    "the latter distortion of the individual protons is constrained by experimental data obtained from elastic scattering of nucleons off nuclei . the approximation to neglect",
    "the interaction between the two outgoing protons has been justified in the past by arguing that the pair of protons will leave the nucleus largely back to back making this type of final state interaction less important .",
    "this issue should be further studied in the future since there is no a priori dominance of the effects of correlations before or after the absorption of the photon as emphasized in ref .",
    "it is , however , possible that angular momentum and parity restrictions associated with the transition to specific discrete final states in the remaining nucleus , may filter the importance of this type of final state interaction .",
    "the possibility to analyze different final states in the reaction has already been explored in ref .",
    "the separation of some of the low - lying final states has recently been realized experimentally at the nikhef  @xcite and mainz  @xcite facilities . as will be shown in this paper",
    ", this feature plays a crucial role in clarifying the distinction between transitions that are strongly influenced by src and those where two - body transition currents play a dominant role .",
    "a related description of the reaction process has been presented in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the critical information about src in the transition to the final a-2 state is incorporated in the two - body spectral function at the corresponding energy . at low missing energy , it represents the probability density for the removal of a pair of nucleons ( protons in the present work ) from the @xmath0o ground state to a specific discrete final state in @xmath2c .",
    "since this removal amplitude involves nucleons close to the fermi energy , the accurate description of this process requires a careful treatment of the influence of low - energy , or long - range , correlations associated with the soft - surface features of the @xmath0o nucleus .",
    "the latter feature has not been included in ref .",
    "@xcite , but is incorporated in ref .",
    "it is the purpose of the present work to combine the reaction description of the two - proton removal process of ref .",
    "@xcite with the many - body calculation of the two - particle spectral function in @xmath0o  of ref .",
    "@xcite in order to calculate cross sections for the triple - coincidence experiments performed at nikhef and mainz .",
    "the calculation of the two - body spectral function in ref .",
    "@xcite includes the dressing of individual nucleons through their coupling to low - lying core excitations .",
    "in addition , the reduced presence of these nucleons at low energy associated with strength removal due to the influence of src is incorporated  @xcite .",
    "this yields theoretical spectroscopic factors for low - lying states in @xmath10n which represent the closest agreement with experiment  @xcite to date .",
    "consistency between the two aspects of the calculations ( long - range vs. short - range ) is ensured by employing the same effective interaction ( g - matrix ) in the calculation of the long - range correlations which is responsible for the removal of single - particle strength .",
    "although the appearance of high - momentum nucleons in the ground state is implied by src , their presence is only apparent at high excitation energy in the a-1 system  @xcite .",
    "the corresponding cross section for the removal of high - momentum protons from @xmath0o in the ( e , e@xmath1p ) reaction has recently been calculated in ref .",
    "although these cross sections are large enough to be detectable at these high energies , other competing processes will also be present making a clear - cut identification of src in the ( e , e@xmath1p ) reaction difficult .",
    "this elusive consequence of src in the ( e , e@xmath1p ) reaction does not pertain to the removal of a pair of nucleons leading to a discrete final state in the a-2 system since few other competing processes are present .",
    "the strongly reduced probability for a pair of protons to be in close proximity will unavoidably lead to the presence of high - momentum components in their relative momentum wave function .",
    "the character and strength of these high - momentum components depends on certain aspects of short - range phenomena which are described differently by different nucleon - nucleon ( nn ) interactions .",
    "sensitivity to the choice of the nn interaction in describing pairs with high relative momentum in the two - body spectral function has been established in ref .",
    "it is hoped that a realistic treatment of the reaction process combined with a detailed many - body treatment of the spectral function in conjunction with new experimental data will produce the first clear and unambiguous determination of src in nuclei .    as will be discussed in this work ,",
    "the presence of several different discrete final states in the reaction allows the calibration of the contribution of one- and two - body current contributions and makes it possible to assess which transitions are most sensitive to the presence of src with some confidence .",
    "this feature makes the @xmath0o nucleus a prime target for this analysis , unlike the @xmath11he nucleus which does not yield any bound states upon the removal of two protons . in sec .",

    "if the effect of the nuclear coulomb field on the incident and the outgoing electrons is neglected , the lorentz condition for the mller potential and the continuity equation for the hadronic current make it possible to separate the longitudinal and transverse components of the interaction and to write the cross section as a linear combination of independent structure functions . for an unpolarized electron , after integration over the energy of one of the emitted nucleons ( @xmath15 ) , the cross section is expressed in terms of six structure functions as  @xcite ,    @xmath16 , \\label{eq : cs}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath17 , @xmath18 is the momentum of the scattered electron , @xmath19 is the angle between the plane of the electrons and the plane containing the momentum transfer @xmath20 and @xmath13 .",

    "the figures illustrate that indeed the @xmath5 knock - out amplitude is relatively little affected by the inclusion of the @xmath7-current , while this two - body current is a major factor in the knock - out of @xmath6 and @xmath131 waves .",
    "this is a general result that has been obtained also in other kinematical situations .",
    "it can be understood if we consider the different role of the excitation and de - excitation part of the @xmath7-current .",
    "the excitation current , which has the energy - dependent @xmath7-propagator of eq .",
    "( [ eq : prop ] ) , gives for energy transfer above 150 mev the dominant contribution of the @xmath7-current on @xmath6 and @xmath131 waves . on a @xmath5 pp pair",
    "the contribution of the excitation current is strongly reduced  @xcite and becomes in our calculation of about the same size or even smaller than that of the de - excitation current , which is generally small .",

    "the contribution of the @xmath131 waves to the total cross section is generally very small .",
    "so the proper place to study the two - body @xmath7-current in the ( e , e@xmath1pp ) reaction is where the @xmath6 knock - out dominates , as in the @xmath104 and @xmath116 states , while src should be studied in the lowest states , where @xmath5 knock - out dominates .",

    "this is clear from the momentum dependence of the @xmath5 defect wave functions that were shown in fig .",

    "the @xmath123 state is dominated over the whole range of recoil momenta by @xmath5 knock - out , whose contribution is about a factor four larger than that of the other relative states .",
    "so in this kinematics the @xmath123 seems to offer the best opportunity to study correlation effects .",
    "we do not display a decomposition into contributions from the one - body and two - body currents here , because the results are conceptually similar to those given in figs .  4 and 5 and",

    "i.e. _ the contribution of the one - body current is practically the same as that of the @xmath5 removal while higher partial waves come almost exclusively from the two - body current .",

    "[ fig : mainz ] .",

    "[ fig : mainzff ] .",
    "the transverse structure function @xmath134 appears to be insensitive to the defect functions .",
    "this is only partly due to the effect of the @xmath7-current . on the contrary",
    "the longitudinal structure function @xmath8 , which is entirely due to the one - body current and thus to correlations , is much more sensitive than @xmath134 and the cross section to the choice of the defect functions . in this kinematics @xmath8",
    "calculated with the bonn - a defect functions is typically four times larger than calculated with the reid defect functions .",
    "however , the experimental separation of the structure functions may be difficult , since @xmath134 is almost an order of magnitude larger than @xmath8 for the @xmath130 ground state .",
    "also for the @xmath104 , not shown in the figure , the @xmath134 structure function is found to be roughly five times @xmath8 with the bonn - a defect functions and about twenty times @xmath8 with the reid defect functions . somewhat more favorable is the situation for the @xmath123 state , since here @xmath134 is only three times larger than @xmath8 at @xmath143 150 mev / c , if the prediction with the bonn - a defect functions turns out to be correct .",

    "the description of the reaction includes both one- and two - body contributions to the electromagnetic current .",
    "the treatment of final state interactions of the detected protons incorporates distortions ( through an optical potential ) for the individual particles but not their mutual interaction .",
    "although the latter is expected to be unimportant for the cases of interest , this issue should be further studied in the future .",
    "the description of the two - body current involves a proper treatment of the dynamics of the intermediate excitation of the @xmath7-isobar before or after the absorption of the virtual photon .",
    "the two - nucleon spectral function ( or two - nucleon overlap function ) has been obtained from a two - step procedure .",
    "the calculation of long - range correlations is performed in a shell - model space large enough to incorporate the corresponding collective features which influence the pair removal amplitude .",
    "the single - particle propagators used for this dressed random phase approximation description of the two - particle propagator also include the effect of both long- and short - range correlations . in the second step that part of the pair removal amplitudes which describes the relative motion of the pair ,",
    "is supplemented by defect functions obtained from the same g - matrix which is also used as the effective interaction in the rpa calculation .    an important conclusion in this work concerns the predicted selectivity of the ( e , e@xmath1pp ) reaction involving discrete final states . whereas the lowest @xmath3 and @xmath4 in @xmath2c are predominantly reached by the removal of a @xmath5 pair",
    "other states at higher excitation energy mostly involve @xmath6 removal .",
    "the latter pair removal proceeds primarily via intermediate excitation of the @xmath7-isobar whereas the former is dominated by the one - body current mechanism .",
    "this feature is responsible for the calculated sensitivity in the cross sections to the treatment of short - range correlations where @xmath5 removal dominates .",
    "short - range correlations induced by the bonn- or reid - potential may each yield larger cross sections than the other in certain kinematical domains . as a result , one will be able to study short - range correlations in this reaction successfully provided a sufficiently large set of kinematical conditions is explored including those available at tjnaf .",
    "the most promising extraction of the effect of short - range correlations shows up in the longitudinal structure function which may be studied in the so - called super - parallel kinematics .",
    "our study demonstrates that an intelligent choice of kinematics in exclusive ( e , e@xmath1pp ) experiments should allow the separation of the effects due to isobar currents and src for two nucleons with isospin @xmath144 .",
    "this success gives rise to the hope that a similar separation between two - body currents and src might also be possible in ( e , e@xmath1pn ) reactions . in this case one",
