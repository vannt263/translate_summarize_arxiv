    "among the large variety of unusual properties found in transition metal compounds , the phenomenon of spin - singlet formation is one of the most intrigueing , and perhaps the most widely spread .",
    "the impact of singlet formation on the physical state ranges from insulating behaviour to superconductivity . in some cases",
    "singlet formation is accompanied by a spin - peierls lattice deformation , such as in cugeo@xmath2 . in other cases",
    "the formation of singlets is accompanied by a transition from a metallic to an insulating state .",
    "it has been suggested that fesi is such a kondo - insulator@xcite . in the present paper",
    "we discuss the wider class of transition metal mono - silicides ( crsi , mnsi , fesi , cosi , nisi , etc ) with the fesi structure , we review the structural and physical data of this class of compounds , and explore the relation between their structural characteristics and the electronic properties .",
    "in table [ table : radii ] we summarize the lattice structures of the mono - silicides for the various d - transition elements@xcite . for the 3d series the @xmath3 space group has been observed from crsi to nisi . for nisi in addition the nias structure has been reported .",
    "the @xmath3 space group has also been reported for rusi , rhsi , resi and ossi .",
    "tisi , vsi , pdsi , irsi and ptsi all have the mnp structure .",
    "+ in this paper we restrict the discussion to the mono - silicides with the @xmath3 space group ( displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : lattice ] ) .",
    "this simple cubic structure contains four tm atoms in the positions ( @xmath4 ; etcycl . ) and four si atoms in an equivalent set .",
    "+ in table [ table : radii ] we summarize the cell - parameters and the interatomic distances@xcite .",
    "the four transition metal and silicon atoms occupy equivalent sites .",
    "the site symmetry has only a three - fold rotation axis , which we indicate throughout this paper as the local z - axis .",
    "the tm - atom has a 7-fold coordination by si atoms and vice versa : a single bond pointing toward the si - atom along the z - axis ( type 1 ) , and two groups of three indentical bonds ( types 2 and 3 ) with azimuthal angles relative to the z - axis of 0 ( type 1 ) 74 ( type 2 ) and 141 degrees ( type 3 ) .",
    "the two groups of type 2 and 3 are rotated around the local z - axis with an angle of @xmath5 degree relative to each other .",
    "the four equivalent sites within the unit cell have the same sense of rotation , hence two isomeric structures ( lefthanded and righthanded ) exist . as a result phase / anti - phase boundaries of the two isomers can occur ( also in single crystals ) which may will considerable influence on the transport properties .",
    "single domain crystals should exhibit optical activity .",
    "these aspects of the transition metal monosilicides still await further scrutiny .",
    "+    within an accuracy of 2 % the average distance between the tm - atom and its 7 si neighbours ( @xmath6 ) follows the rule @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the atomic radius of the tm atom in 12-coordinated metals@xcite , and @xmath9 is the single bond radius of si ( fig .",
    "[ fig : radii ] and table [ table : radii ] ) , indicating that almost no charge transfer takes place between si and the tm atom .",
    "the absence of charge transfer between tm and si can be anticipated from the fact that the pauling electronegativities are almost the same . + for @xmath10 and @xmath11 all seven neighbours have the same bondlength .",
    "as we can see in table [ table : radii ] the structure of the tm - monosilicides is rather close to this situation , but the deviations are significant .",
    "the variation of the bondlength within the group of 7 nearest neighbours has been discussed by pauling@xcite for crsi to nisi in terms of valence bond sums , which lead to the following bond numbers : one full bond ( type 1 ) , three 2/3 bonds(type 2 ) and three 1/3 bonds ( type 3 ) .",
    "the best studied materials in this class are mnsi and fesi .",
    "mnsi has a helical spin structure at low fields below the nel temperature of 29 k , and is paramagnetic above @xmath12 .",
    "crsi and nisi are either weakly paramagnetic or diamagnetic .",
    "estimates of the local moment on mn based on magnetic susceptibilities vary from @xmath13 with @xmath14 below 300 k to 3.3@xmath15 above 600 k@xcite .",
    "for fesi@xcite the high temperature limiting behaviour of the susceptibility gives @xmath16 with @xmath17 , but good fits to thermally activated curie - weiss behaviour were also obtained with @xmath18 and @xmath14 .      in fig .",
    "[ fig : epsig.fesi.cosi ] we reproduce the real part of the optical conductivity and of dielectric constants for some selected temperatures of fesi and cosi . in fig .",
    "[ fig : ne.fesi.cosi ] we display the function @xmath19 for both compounds .",
    "the high frequency limit corresponds to the total number of electrons per fesi ( _ i.e. _ 40 electrons ) .",
    "here we neglected the contribution of the nuclei , which is justified due to the large ratio of the nuclear mass compared to the electron mass .",
    "we see , that for cosi the @xmath20-curves for different temperatures merge above 1000 @xmath21 indicating that no transfer of spectral weight from high to low frequencies takes place .",
    "+ for fesi the recovery of spectral weight can be followed upto approximately 2000 @xmath21 above which the experimental errorbars become rather large as a result of uncertainties in the kramers - kronig analysis , mainly induced by the extrapolations at high frequency@xcite .",
    "it seems plausible to associate the temperature dependence of the section between 1000 and 2000 @xmath21 with the optical conductivity due to thermally induced charge carriers . in fig .",
    "[ fig : nel.arr ] this number is displayed versus temperature along with the hall number of paschen et al @xcite .",
    "we display @xmath20 for 3 different values of the cutoff frequency ( @xmath22 300 , 800 and 2000 @xmath21 ) to demonstrate that the activation energy is independent of frequency .",
    "we observe that the hall number and @xmath23 have approximately the same activation energy of about 200 to 250 k.      @xmath24    in table [ table : ea ] we collect the activation energies and gap values determined from various spectroscopic data and transport properties .",
    "for the tunneling data the gap - value corresponds to the peak - to peak value in the di / dv versus v curves . in a single particle band picture",
    "this value should match the optical and raman gap .",
    "clearly there is a rather large spread of activation energies .",
    "the trend is , that the higher the temperature range considered , the larger the activation energy obtained .",
    "this indicates , that the thermal evolution involves a distribution of activation energies .",
    "the behaviour of the electrical resistivity of fesi and cosi is quite different ( see fig . [",
    "fig : rho.fesi.cosi ] ) .",
    "cosi has a high residual resitance and conventional bloch - grneisen behaviour .",
    "fesi shows insulating behaviour at low temperature .",
    "the dc resistivity of fesi @xmath25 varies from 2500 to 300 @xmath26 between 100 and 300 k. when combined with the carrier densities of fig .",
    "[ fig : nel.arr ] we see , that @xmath27 varies from 4.6 to 10 fs between 100 and 300 k. note that the same ratio @xmath28 appears in the drude expression as in the expression of the optical carrier density . hence our result for @xmath27 does not depend on assumptions for the effective mass .",
    "an estimate of the carrier life - time @xmath27 is also obtained from direct inspection of @xmath29 .",
    "as there are no thermally excitated carriers at 4k we proceed by subtracting @xmath30 from the conductivity spectra at higher temperature . in zeroth approximation",
    "the increase in conductivity upon raising temperature is a drude - lorentzian due to the thermally excited carriers . at the gap frequency and",
    "the optical phonons the difference spectra contain quirks due to the shifting of the gap , and thermal broadening of the phonons .",
    "otherwise the difference curves have a halfwidth of @xmath31 @xmath21 , or @xmath32 , in good agreement with the lifetime calculated from the dc resistivity .",
    "+ let us first explore the possibility that the excited carriers can be described in the same way as in conventional doped semiconductors .",
    "the carrier density and @xmath33 are related through @xmath34 , where g is the overall degeneracy factor ( valley and spin ) .",
    "band theory predicts a 12-fold degeneracy of the electron pockets , and an 8-fold degeneracy of the hole pockets@xcite . to simplify matters we will ignore possible differences in mass and mobility for electrons and holes .",
    "hence the degeneracy factor entering the optical carrier density is @xmath35 .",
    "the observed density n@xmath36= varies from 0.3 to 1.3 @xmath37 @xmath38 ( 100 to 300 k ) , implying that @xmath33 varies from @xmath39 to @xmath40 @xmath21 , @xmath41 varies from @xmath42 to @xmath43 m / s and @xmath44 varies from @xmath45 to @xmath46 mev .",
    "hence the electrons and holes are essentially nondegenerate throughout this temperature range as expected for thermal excitation across a semiconductor gap . using our estimate of @xmath47",
    "we calculate a mean free path of 2.6 to 9.0 @xmath48 for temperatures in the range of 100 to 300 k. this mean free path is sufficiently short to smear the momentum of the charge carriers on the scale of the size of the electron and hole pockets ( @xmath49 ) , and even sufficient to smear the momentum over the entire brillouin zone ( @xmath50 ) .",
    "this implies that the conduction of the charge carriers is essentially of the hopping type .",
    "however , this small value of @xmath51 implies that the fine details of the bandstructure become irrelevant , and the multi - valleyed character of electron and hole pockets is scrambled , thus invalidating the assumption made on input that @xmath52 .",
    "+ let us now compare the absolute values of the carrier density in fig .",
    "[ fig : nel.arr ] obtained from the hall effect and from the optical conductivity . if we extrapolate the hall number to the region between 100 and 300 k where we have reliable estimates of the optical carrier density(@xmath23 ) , the hall number seems to overshoot @xmath23 with a factor 5 to 10 . in a semiconductor model with equal electron and hole masses and mobilities the optical carrier density corresponds to @xmath53 , whereas @xmath54 .",
    "there is a compensation between electron and hole contributions to the hall constant , leading to an experimental hall number which is always larger than the optical carrier density .",
    "+ the combination of electron - like hall conductivity , and short mean free path of the carriers , motivates us to propose a different scenario from the semiconductor picture which we explored above : the effect of raising temperature is to excite electrons to a wide band above the fermi energy .",
    "the holes which are left behind move within a narrow band of ( almost ) localized states . from the perspective of the effect on doping",
    "the latter states behave in the same way as donor states in a conventional semiconductor , but should be really understood as a narrow band of quasi - atomic states of the transition metal atoms .",
    "as we may now ignore the contribution to the charge response of the hole channel ( due to the low mobility ) the smaller value of the optical carrier density @xmath23 compared to the ( extrapolated ) hall number in the 100 - 300 k range indicates a moderate effective mass of the mobile charge carriers @xmath55 .",
    "an explicit realization of this situation is the pairing of itinerant electrons with local moments at low temperature to form a lattice of kondo - singlets@xcite . at sufficiently high temperatures",
    "these singlets will be broken into their constituents , _",
    "i.e. _ itinerant electrons and local moments .",
    "as no mobile charges are associated with the local moments , these moments add a neglegible contribution both to the hall conductivity and the infrared conductivity , so that the dominant contribution comes from the thermally excitated itinerant electrons .",
    "a natural consequence of having unpaired local moments at higher temperatures is spin - flip scattering of the itinerant electrons , leading to a reduction of the mean free path .",
    "this scattering mechanism will be suppressed if the local moments are aligned by the external application of a magnetic field ( positive magneto - conductivity ) .",
    "+ motivated by these arguments we recalculate the carrier properties , adopting a degeneracy factor @xmath14 ( only spin ) : @xmath33 now varies from @xmath56 to @xmath57 @xmath21 , @xmath41 varies from @xmath58 to @xmath59 m / s , @xmath44 from 66 to160 mev , @xmath51 from 7.0 to 25.0 @xmath48 , and @xmath60 from 0.15 to 0.8 .      the steps in the @xmath20 curve in fig .",
    "[ fig : ne.fesi.cosi ] at frequencies below 1000 @xmath21 are due to optical phonons@xcite .",
    "by applying the optical sum - rule to these vibrational resonances we can determine the dynamical ( or transverse effective ) charge of fe and si for each temperature .",
    "for a purely ionic insulator this is also the actual charge of the ions . for a covalent compound with resonating bonds a finite value of the transverse effective charge results from a dynamical charge redistribution associated with the ionic motion of an optical phonon . for the tm mono - silicides pauling",
    "has argued , that resonance occurs between the partial bonds of types 2 and 3 ( 1/3 and 2/3 bonds ) .",
    "lucovsky and white@xcite have shown ( for the iv - vi narrow gap semiconductors ) that this phenomenon leads to a high value of the transverse effective charge .",
    "rice , lipari and strssler@xcite developed the theory for the infrared spectra for phonons coupled to charge excitations .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : zeff.fesi.cosi ] we display the transverse effective charge for both compounds .",
    "a large value of more than 4 is found for @xmath61 . based on the electronegativities and from the observed atomic radii",
    "there can be almost no charge transfer between the transition metal atom and si in these compounds .",
    "hence we attributed the large value of the transverse effective charge to a dynamical coupling of the optical phonons to electronic resonances .",
    "the full analysis was presented in ref .",
    "this requires that at least some of the bonds between fe and si are incomplete .",
    "the enhancement of transverse effective charge is then due to a coupling of the ionic displacement to charge flow between the unsaturated bonds .",
    "from ab initio bandstructure calculations for fesi it is known , that in these materials the si-3s states are fully occupied and have a binding energy of about 10 ev .",
    "the si 3p states are partially occupied and form together with the tm - states a complex manifold of bands . + according to a famous rule from the theory of mott - hubbard metal insulator transitions the atomic description of the tm atom becomes the appropriate ansatz if the on - site correlation energy exceeds the bandwidth . for",
    "the tm silicides the bandwidth is of order 6 ev , and @xmath62 is of the same order of magnitude .",
    "the silicides therefore seem to provide a border case .",
    "a band description where the correlation effects are taken into account perturbatively has been used by several investigators@xcite . in this paper",
    "we want to explore a more intuitive approach based on an atomistic picture .",
    "+ in their elemental metallic phase the tm atoms have approximately a @xmath63 configuration , with @xmath64 the number of valence electrons per atom . from the d - shell radii displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : radii ] we can see , that in the whole series the d - shell radius@xcite falls well below the atomic radius , which implies that the d - shells exhibit quasi atomic characteristics due to shielding by the outer s and p - shells .",
    "due to the low site symmetry of the tm - atoms mixing of s , p and d - character occurs in the eigenstates . for the purpose of compactness of notation",
    "we will label the tm valence bands as d-states .",
    "we will assume that these states have quasi - atomic characteristics , so that we can use a ligand field description to describe the influence of the si - matrix .",
    "for the purpose of bookkeeping of the actual d- and sp - count of the atoms , it is important to take into account the relative contribution of s and p character to the d-states .",
    "+ with this approach we arrive at the following scenario : each tm atom contributes 5 d - states and n electrons . in the case of fesi : n@xmath658 .",
    "each si contributes 3 3p states and 4 electrons .",
    "due to the 3-fold rotation symmetry the 5 d - states are grouped in a single degenerate @xmath66 state , and two groups of doubly degenerate levels ( @xmath67 and @xmath68 ) corresponding to linear combinations of @xmath69,@xmath70,@xmath71 and @xmath72 .",
    "here we adopted a local reference frame with the @xmath73-axis oriented along the 3-fold rotation axis which pierces the tm atom .",
    "+ of the surrounding shell of 7 si atoms only the 3p orbitals with their lobes pointing toward the transition metal atom couple to the tm states .",
    "thus 7 ligand orbitals are engaged in bonds with the tm - atom .",
    "we indicate the ligand of type 1 as @xmath74 . taking into account the hopping @xmath27 between the si atoms at relative angles",
    "@xmath75,@xmath76 and @xmath77 , we obtain the ligand - states of all types @xmath78 ( @xmath791,2,3 ) @xmath80 the degeneracy between the ligand states @xmath81 with j=2 and j=3 is lifted due to a finite hopping probality between these groups : +   + the dependence on the angular coordinate @xmath82 of the hopping integral between the @xmath83 ( @xmath84 ) and the ligand 3p orbital is @xmath85 ( @xmath86 ) .",
    "the angle @xmath87 identifies the orientation of the two rings of ligand si atoms : @xmath88 degree for type j=2 resp .",
    "3 . the resulting ( nonzero )",
    "hopping matrix elements between the ligand orbitals and the central tm atom are with this choice of local reference frame +   +   +   + all other matrix elements are zero . in principle all ligand combinations of the tmsi@xmath89 cluster are shared between neighbouring tm - sites and form bands . due to the angle of @xmath90 70 degrees between the bonds of types 2 and 3 , we anticipate that a linear combination of @xmath91 and @xmath92 exists which has a strongly reduced hopping matrix element to the cluster of ligand orbitals , resulting in a ( doubly degenerate ) non - bonding orbital of a quasi - atomic character .",
    "the resulting level scheme of hybrid tm - ligand character is sketched in fig .",
    "[ fig : energy.levels ] .",
    "the single ( per tm atom ) axial bonding orbitals of @xmath93 character have the highest binding energy , followed by a band containing the 2 states of bonding @xmath94 character .",
    "around @xmath44 we find a combined partially occupied anti - bonding band , containing 3 states in total .",
    "finally two non - bonding @xmath95 states are located at @xmath44 . with a finite value for the hopping parameter of these states to the ligand",
    "orbitals taken into account , the latter states form a narrow band .",
    "provided that the width of this band is sufficiently small , it behaves as a lattice of quasi - atomic open shells obeying hund s rules .",
    "the observation that two quasi - atomic d - states with two electrons per fe atom should exist in fesi was originally made by pauling , using a different line of argueing , based on his analyses of the valence bond sums@xcite .",
    "we conjecture , that these subshells are filled step by step in the series crsi ( zero electrons / atom ) upto nisi ( four electrons / atom ) .",
    "this leaves two electrons per si atom to populate the more itinerant anti - bonding band at @xmath44 .",
    "this partly filled anti - bonding band corresponds to partial bonds of type 2 and 3 , and is responsible for the strong enhancement of the transverse dynamical charge in cosi and fesi@xcite .",
    "+ this scenario provides a qualitative argument why the same crystal structure is observed from crsi upto nisi : only if electrons are added to -or removed from- the itinerant anti - bonding band , chemical bonds are affected , and the fesi structure is de - stabilized . addition or removal of electrons from this wide band will not take place unless the @xmath95 subshell is either completely full or empty , _",
    "e.g. _ for vsi or cusi .",
    "it is now easy to understand the high spin state of fesi at elevated temperatures : the electrons in the itinerant band contribute a pauli - paramagnetic susceptibility , which is small .",
    "according to hund s rules the two electrons in the @xmath95 subshell are in a triplet configuration , thus providing the curie - susceptibility with @xmath0 and @xmath14 that has been observed at high temperatures . in fig .",
    "[ fig : kondo.levels ] the relevant elements for the low energy scale are sketched : one local moment with @xmath0 at every site , exchange - coupled to a band with two conduction electrons per site .",
    "based on a discussion of infrared and transport data presented in this report and of published data , we provide a qualitative model of the electronic structure of the transition metal monosilicides .",
    "the main conclusion is , that 6 electrons per transition metal atom are engaged in chemical bonds to the si sublattice .",
    "the remaining electrons of the tm atoms ( two for fesi ) occupy a doubly degenerate quasi - atomic d - state , and obey hunds rules .",
    "the conduction band supports 2 weakly bound itinerant electrons ( mainly si 3p character ) which in the case of fesi compensate the local moment at low temperatures by forming a kondo singlet .",
    "this framework provides a basis for understanding the observed range of chemical stability of these compounds ( crsi to nisi ) , and of the physical properties of fesi .",
    "we gratefully acknowledge m. fth for communicating his results to us prior to publication .",
