    "the purpose of power control is for each user to transmit enough power so that it can achieve the required quality of service ( qos ) at the uplink receiver without causing unnecessary interference to other users in the system .",
    "game theory has been used as an effective tool to study power control for data networks ( see for example @xcite ) . taking this approach ,",
    "it is shown in @xcite and @xcite that nash equilibrium is achieved when all the users aim for a target sir , @xmath0 .",

    "multi - carrier cdma , which combines the benefits of orthogonal frequency division multiplexing ( ofdm ) with those of cdma , is considered to be a potential candidate for next generation high data - rate wireless systems ( see @xcite ) . in this work",
    ", we consider an orthogonal multi - carrier ds - cdma system and propose a non - cooperative power control game in which each user tries to choose its transmit power over each carrier to maximize its overall utility . for the proposed game",
    ", we will address the following questions .",
    "when does a nash equilibrium exist ?",
    "what kind of carrier allocations among the competing users will occur at a nash equilibrium ? will there be an even spread of usage of the carriers among users ?",
    "how does this approach compare with an approach in which each user simply optimizes over each carrier independently ?",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in section  [ background ] , we provide some background for this work by discussing the power control game for the single - carrier case . the power control game for multi - carrier systems is presented in section  [ ncpcg ] . the nash equilibrium and its existence for the proposed game",
    "are discussed in section  [ nash equilibrium ] and a distributed algorithm for reaching the equilibrium ( if it exists ) is presented in section  [ algorithm ] .",
    "the case of two - carrier systems is studied in more details in section  [ special case ] .",
    "numerical results and conclusions are given in sections  [ simulation ] and [ conclusion ] , respectively .",
    "our focus throughout this work is on the uplink , where user terminals transmit to a common concentration point such as a cellular base station .",
    "let us first look at the power control game with a single carrier . to pose the power control problem as a non - cooperative game , we first need to define a utility function suitable for data applications .",
    "most data applications are sensitive to error but they can tolerate delay .",
    "it is clear that a higher signal to interference plus noise ratio ( sir ) level at the output of the receiver will result in a lower bit error rate and hence higher throughput .",
    "however , achieving a high sir level requires the user terminal to transmit at a high power which in turn results in low battery life . in @xcite ,",
    "the utility function of a user is defined as the ratio of its throughput to its transmit power , i.e. @xmath1 throughput is the net number of information bits that are transmitted without error per unit time ( sometimes referred to as goodput ) .",
    "it can be expressed as @xmath2 where @xmath3 and @xmath4 are the number of information bits and the total number of bits in a packet , respectively . @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the transmission rate and the sir for the @xmath7 user , respectively ; and @xmath8 is the efficiency function representing the packet success rate ( psr ) , i.e. the probability that a packet is received without an error .",
    "our assumption is that if a packet has one or more bit errors , it will be retransmitted .",
    "the efficiency function , @xmath8 , is assumed to be increasing and s - shaped ( sigmoidal ) with @xmath9 .",
    "we also require that @xmath10 to ensure that @xmath11 when @xmath12 .",
    "these assumptions are valid in many practical systems .",
    "it should be noted that the throughput @xmath13 in ( [ eq1 ] ) could be replaced with any increasing concave function as long as we make sure that @xmath11 when @xmath12 .",
    "a more detailed discussion of the efficiency function can be found in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "note that for a sigmoidal efficiency function , the utility function in ( [ eq1a ] ) is quasiconcave in user s transmit power .",
    "this is also true if the throughput in ( [ eq1 ] ) is replaced with an increasing concave function .",
    "based on ( [ eq1a ] ) and ( [ eq1 ] ) , the utility function for user @xmath14 can be written as @xmath15 this utility function , which has units of _ bits / joule _ , captures very well the tradeoff between throughput and battery life and is particularly suitable for applications where saving power is as important as achieving a high throughput .",
    "power control is modeled as a non - cooperative game in which each user tries to selfishly maximize its own utility .",
    "it is shown in @xcite that , when matched filters are used as the uplink receivers , if user terminals are allowed to choose only their transmit powers for maximizing their utilities , then there exists an equilibrium point at which no user can improve its utility given the power levels of other users ( nash equilibrium ) .",
    "the equilibrium is achieved when users transmit powers are sir - balanced with @xmath0 , the solution to @xmath16 , as the output sir .",
    "furthermore , this equilibrium is unique .    in this work ,",
    "we extend this game - theoretic approach to multi - carrier systems .",
    "let us consider the uplink of a multi - carrier ds - cdma data network with @xmath17 users , @xmath18 carriers and processing gain @xmath19 ( for each carrier ) .",
    "the carriers are assumed to be sufficiently far apart so that the ( spread - spectrum ) signal transmitted over each carrier does not interfere with the signals transmitted over other carriers . at the transmitter ,",
    "the incoming bits for user @xmath14 are divided into @xmath18 parallel streams and each stream is spread using the spreading code of user @xmath14 .",
    "the @xmath18 parallel streams are then sent over the @xmath18 ( orthogonal ) carriers . for the @xmath20 carrier , the received signal at the uplink receiver ( after chip - matched filtering and sampling )",
    "can be represented by an @xmath21 vector as @xmath22 where @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 are the @xmath7 user s transmitted bit , transmit power and path gain , respectively , for the @xmath20 frequency channel ( carrier ) .",
    "@xmath26 is the spreading sequence for user @xmath14 which is assumed to be random with unit norm ; and @xmath27 is the noise vector which is assumed to be gaussian with mean @xmath28 and covariance @xmath29 .",
    "the matched filter output sir for the @xmath20 carrier of the @xmath7 user is , therefore , given by @xmath30    we propose a non - cooperative game in which each user chooses its transmit powers over the @xmath18 carriers to maximize its overall utility .",
    "in other words , each user ( selfishly ) decides how much power to transmit over each frequency channel ( carrier ) to achieve the highest overall utility .",
    "let @xmath31 $ ] denote the proposed non - cooperative game where @xmath32 , and @xmath33^d$ ] is the strategy set for the @xmath7 user . here",
    ", @xmath34 is the maximum transmit power .",
    "each strategy in @xmath35 can be written as @xmath36 $ ] .",
    "the utility function for user @xmath14 is defined as the ratio of the total throughput over the total transmit power for the @xmath18 carriers , i.e. @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the throughput achieved by user @xmath14 over the @xmath20 carrier , and is given by @xmath39 .",
    "hence , the resulting non - cooperative game can be expressed as the following maximization problem : @xmath40 under the constraint of non - negative powers ( i.e. @xmath41 for all @xmath42 and @xmath43 ) . without any loss of generality ,",
    "if we assume equal transmission rates for all users , ( [ eq7 ] ) can be expressed as @xmath44 the relationship between @xmath45 and @xmath24 s is given by ( [ eq5 ] ) .",
    "for the non - cooperative power control game proposed in the previous section , a nash equilibrium is a set of power vectors , @xmath46 , such that no user can unilaterally improve its utility by choosing a different power vector ; i.e. @xmath47 is a nash equilibrium if and only if @xmath48 and for @xmath49 ; where @xmath50 contains the transmit power vectors of all the users except for user @xmath14 .",
    "let us define @xmath51 as the  effective channel gain \" for user @xmath14 over the @xmath20 carrier . based on ( [ eq5 ] ) and ( [ eq10 ] ) , we have @xmath52 .",
    "* proposition 1 * : for user @xmath14 , the utility function in ( [ eq6 ] ) is maximized when @xmath53 where @xmath54 and @xmath55 , with @xmath0 being the unique ( positive ) solution of @xmath56 .",
    "_ proof _ : we first show that @xmath57 is maximized when @xmath58 . for this",

    ", @xmath63 maximizes @xmath64 , where @xmath0 is the unique ( positive ) solution to @xmath65 .",
    "now , without any loss of generality , let us assume that @xmath66 .",
    "then , based on the above argument we can write @xmath67 for any @xmath68 , where @xmath69 . also , because @xmath70 , we have @xmath71 for all @xmath72 and @xmath73 . based on the above inequalities , we can write @xmath74    adding the @xmath18 inequalities given in ( [ eq12 ] ) and rewriting the resulting inequality , we have @xmath75 this completes the proof .",
    "@xmath76    proposition 1 suggests that the utility for user @xmath14 is maximized when the user transmits only over its  best \" carrier such that the achieved sir at the output of the matched filter receiver is equal to @xmath0 .",
    "best \" carrier is the one with the largest effective channel gain . an alternative way of interpreting proposition 1 is that the utility for user @xmath14 is maximized when the user transmits only on the carrier that requires the least amount of transmit power to achieve @xmath0 at the output of the uplink receiver . a set of power vectors , @xmath77 , is a nash equilibrium if and only if they simultaneously satisfy ( [ eq11a ] ) .",
    "it should also be noted that the utility - maximizing strategy suggested by proposition 1 is different from the waterfilling approach discussed in @xcite .",
    "this is because in @xcite , utility is defined as the user s throughput whereas here we have defined utility as the number of bits transmitted per joule of energy consumed .",
    "another observation is that if we use @xmath78 as the utility function , then the utility for user @xmath14 is maximized when the user transmits on all the carriers at power levels that achieve @xmath0 for every carrier .",
    "this is equivalent to the case in which each user maximizes its utility over each carrier independently .    since at nash equilibrium ( if it exists )",
    ", each user must transmit on one carrier only , there are exactly @xmath79 possibilities for an equilibrium . for example , in the case of @xmath80 , there are 4 possibilities for nash equilibrium :    * user 1 and user 2 both transmit on the first carrier . *",
    "user 1 and user 2 both transmit on the second carrier .",
    "* user 1 transmits on the first carrier and user 2 transmits on the second carrier . *",
    "user 1 transmits on the second carrier and user 2 transmits on the first carrier .",
    "depending on the set of channel gains , i.e. @xmath25 s , the proposed power control game may have no equilibrium , a unique equilibrium , or more than one equilibrium .",
    "let us for now assume that the processing gain is sufficiently large so that even when all @xmath17 users transmit on the same carrier , @xmath0 can be achieved by all users .",
    "this is the case when @xmath81 .",
    "the following proposition helps identify the nash equilibrium ( if it exists ) for a given set of channel gains .",
    "* proposition 2 * : the necessary condition for user @xmath14 to transmit on the @xmath20 carrier at equilibrium is that @xmath82 where @xmath83 is the number of users transmitting on the @xmath84 carrier and @xmath85 in this case , @xmath86 .    _ proof _ : based on proposition 1 , in order for user @xmath14 to transmit on carrier @xmath87 at equilibrium , we must have @xmath88 since @xmath89 users ( including user @xmath14 ) are transmitting on the @xmath20 carrier and @xmath83 users are transmitting on the @xmath84 carrier and all users have an output sir equal to @xmath0 , we have @xmath90 and @xmath91 where @xmath92 and @xmath93 are the received powers for each user on the @xmath20 and @xmath84 carriers , respectively .",
    "now define @xmath94 to get @xmath95 and @xmath96 . substituting @xmath97 and @xmath98 into ( [ eq15b ] ) and ( [ eq15c ] ) and taking advantage of the fact that @xmath99 we get @xmath100 and @xmath101",
    "consequently , ( [ eq14 ] ) is obtained by substituting ( [ eq15d ] ) and ( [ eq15e ] ) into ( [ eq15a ] ) .",
    "furthermore , since @xmath102 , we have @xmath103 and this completes the proof .  @xmath76    based on ( [ eq15 ] ) , when @xmath104 , we have @xmath105 with @xmath106 .    for each of the @xmath79 possible equilibria , the channel gains for each of the @xmath17 users must satisfy @xmath107 inequalities similar to ( [ eq14 ] ) . furthermore",
    ", satisfying a set of @xmath108 of such inequalities by the @xmath17 users is sufficient for existence of nash equilibrium but the uniqueness is not guaranteed .",
    "for example , for the case of @xmath80 , the 4 possible equilibria can be characterized as follows .",
    "* for both users to transmit on the first carrier at equilibrium , we must have @xmath109 and @xmath110 .",
    "* for both users to transmit on the second carrier at equilibrium , we must have @xmath111 and @xmath112 . * for user 1 and user 2 to transmit on the first and second carriers , respectively , at equilibrium , we must have @xmath113 and @xmath114 . * for user 1 and user 2 to transmit on the second and first carriers , respectively , at equilibrium , we must have @xmath115 and @xmath116 .    fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] shows the regions corresponding to the above four equilibria .",
    "it can be seen that for certain values of channel gains there is no nash equilibrium and for some values of channel gains there are two equilibria .     and",
    "in this section , we present an iterative and distributed algorithm for reaching the nash equilibrium ( if it exists ) for the proposed power control game .",
    "the description of the algorithm is as follows .    1",
    ".   let @xmath118 2 .",
    "given the transmit powers of other users , user @xmath14 picks the carrier whose effective channel gain ( i.e. @xmath119 ) is the largest and transmits only on that carrier at a power level equal to @xmath120 3 .",
    "@xmath121 4 .   if @xmath122 then go back to step 2 5 .",
    "stop if the powers have converged , otherwise go to step  1    it is clear that if the above algorithm converges , it will converge to a nash equilibrium .",
    "it is also demonstrated in section [ simulation ] that the algorithm converges when a nash equilibrium exists . in the case of multiple nash equilibria",
    ", the above algorithm converges to one of the equilibria depending on the starting point .",
    "to gain some insight into the properties of the nash equilibria for our proposed game , let us concentrate on a system with two carriers and two users ( i.e. @xmath123 ) .",
    "we assume that the channel amplitudes are independent and identically distributed ( i.i.d . ) among users and carriers .",
    "if we assume rayleigh fading ( with mean 1 ) for the channel amplitudes then the channel gains , @xmath25 s , will be i.i.d . with exponential distribution of mean 1 .",
    "let @xmath124 be the random variable corresponding to the number of users that transmit over the first carrier at equilibrium .",
    "if we assume @xmath125 , then , based on proposition 2 , the probability that both users transmit on the first carrier at equilibrium ( i.e. @xmath126 ) is given by @xmath127 similarly , the probability of both users transmitting on the second carrier at equilibrium is @xmath128 the probability of one user transmitting on each of the two carriers can be found to be @xmath129 consequently , the probability that no nash equilibrium exists is given by @xmath130 it should be noted that as the processing gain @xmath19 becomes larger , @xmath131 and @xmath132 approach 1 from below and above , respectively .",
    "this results in a reduction in @xmath133 but an increase in @xmath134 and @xmath135 , i.e. the probability mass function ( pmf ) for @xmath124 becomes flatter .",
    "however , the increase outweighs the decrease and as a result @xmath136 decreases as @xmath19 increases . going back to fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , we see that the region for which no nash equilibrium exists shrinks as @xmath19 increases . in addition , the region for which more than one equilibrium exists disappears as @xmath19 becomes very large .",
    "therefore , we can say that as the processing gain becomes large , the probability that the proposed power control game has a unique nash equilibrium approaches one .",
    "so far , the assumption has been that @xmath125 so that both users can achieve @xmath0 even when they are transmitting over the same carrier . for the case of @xmath137",
    ", the users can not achieve @xmath0 simultaneously when they are transmitting on the same carrier and hence they would end up transmitting at the maximum power .",
    "therefore , when @xmath138 , the probability of both users transmitting on the same carrier at equilibrium is virtually zero , i.e. @xmath139 .",
    "hence , we have @xmath140 .",
    "although obtaining explicit expressions for the probabilities of the occurrence of various nash equilibria for the case of @xmath141 is difficult , many of the statements made for the case of @xmath142 are also valid when @xmath141 .",
    "namely , as @xmath19 increases the pmf of @xmath124 becomes wider and at the same time the probability that no equilibrium exists becomes smaller .",
    "this means that in the asymptotic case of large processing gain , the proposed power control game has a unique equilibrium .",
    "furthermore , for very large values of @xmath19 , the pmf of @xmath124 can be approximated as @xmath143    in the next section , we show the validity of these claims using simulation .",
    "we first consider the case of two carriers with two users .",
    "we assume @xmath144 , @xmath145 kbps and @xmath146 watts ; and use @xmath147 as the efficiency function . for this efficiency function , @xmath148 ( = 8.1db ) .",
    "we assume that the channel gains are i.i.d . with exponential distribution of mean 1 .",
    "we consider 20,000 realizations of channel gains .",
    "for each realization , we run the algorithm proposed in section  [ algorithm ] for 20 iterations .",
    "if convergence is reached by the end of the @xmath149 iteration , we record the number of users that transmit on each carrier ; otherwise , we assume there is no equilibrium . for our simulations",
    ", @xmath34 is assumed to be very large which translates to having no transmit power limit for the user terminal .",
    "it is observed that the distributed algorithm proposed in section [ algorithm ] converges when a nash equilibrium exists .",

    "we see that there is a close agreement between the simulation results and the analytical values .",
    "it is also observed that as @xmath19 becomes large , @xmath136 approaches zero . for @xmath152 , for example , the probability that a nash equilibrium exists is about 93% . since @xmath134 is identical to @xmath135 , it is not shown in the figure .",

    "we can see from the figure that as the processing gain increases , the pmf of @xmath124 becomes flatter .",
    "this is because for larger values of @xmath19 , the system becomes more tolerant towards interference .",
    "therefore , the probability with which the two users are able to transmit on the same carrier at equilibrium increases .     for different processing gains ( @xmath117 and @xmath142),width=274 ]    we repeat the above experiment for the case of two carriers and 10 users .",

    "also , the equilibria for which the allocation of users to the carriers is highly asymmetric ( e.g. @xmath155 and 10 ) are unlikely to happen . in other words , with a high probability , the users are evenly distributed between the two carriers .",
    "it should be noted that when @xmath19 is small , @xmath0 can not be achieved simultaneously by all the users at the output of the matched filters .",
