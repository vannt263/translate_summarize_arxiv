    "first of all , in spite of @xmath0 theory is the simplest modification of the gravitational interaction to higher order known so far , @xmath0 action is sufficiently general to encapsulate some of the basic characteristics of higher order gravity .",
    "second , it is believed that there are sufficient theoretical predictions to claim that @xmath0 gravity can be compatible with newtonian and post - newtonian prescriptions capozziello2005a , capozziello2005b .",
    "third , there are serious reasons to believe that @xmath0 theories are unique among higher order gravity theories , in the sense that they seem to be the only ones which can avoid the long known and fatal ostrogradski instability @xcite .",
    "fourth , @xmath0 theories have no ghosts ( @xmath5 ) , and the stability condition @xmath6 of essentially amounts to guarantee that the scalaron is not a tachyon @xcite .",
    "all these properties can be easily obtained either directly , or using conformal equivalence of field equations of @xmath0 theories to those of the einstein gravity interacting with a minimally coupled scalar field with some potential @xmath7 which form is uniquely determined by @xmath0 in all points where @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "some of these reasons are sufficient to state why there is much activity in the study of different versions of modified @xmath0 theories with applications to gravity , cosmology and astrophysics .",
    "unlike general relativity , which involves metric derivatives no higher than second order , @xmath9 gravity involves also third and fourth order derivatives , which caused complications in the calculation .",
    "some of the exact solutions in @xmath0 gravity have been studied in ref .",

    "finally , it is also be desirable to study the cosmological view , the causal structure and dynamical stability as well as thermodynamical properties of the black hole solutions derived here . generalization of these solutions to non - constant ricci scalar with nontrivial topology of horizons as well as obtaining a special transformation to find a corresponding between @xmath0 gravity and einstein - nonlinear maxwell gravity , remain to be carried out in the future ."
