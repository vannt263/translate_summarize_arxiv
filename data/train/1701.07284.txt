    "the surprising discrepancy between the prediction of high - energy @xmath1-ray emission from colliding wind binaries @xcite and their ongoing non - detection @xcite is still unresolved .",
    "the hitherto only exception to the rule , the bright @xmath1-ray source @xmath2 carinae @xcite , renders the lack of emission from similar sources even more interesting .",
    "the recently reported analysis of 7 promising colliding - wind binary systems with 7 years of data from the _ fermi_-lat by @xcite even adds to the problem by further lowering the upper flux limit of wr  140  once predicted to be a promising @xmath1-source  to less than 1.1@xmath510@xmath6 ph @xmath7s@xmath8 in the 0.1@xmath9100 gev energy range .",
    "the respective value for @xmath2 carinae is 184@xmath1030 @xmath510@xmath6 ph @xmath7s@xmath8 @xcite .",
    "taking into account that the two systems have a similar distance from earth , similar eccentricities and stellar separations , and even that the total kinetic wind energy available for particle acceleration and ultimately for @xmath1-ray emission in wr  140 is a factor of 2 larger than for @xmath2  carinae @xcite - how can this difference in flux of more than two orders of magnitude be explained ?",
    "the answer might be connected with the many peculiarities of the @xmath2 carinae system .",
    "it is singled out amongst other colliding - wind binary systems by the nature of its primary star , presumably a luminous blue variable with a stellar wind that is  1.5 orders of magnitude denser then the primary wind of e.g. wr  140 .",
    "@xcite now reports the detection of wr  11 , a short - period wc8 + o7.5 binary system very unlike the systems discussed above ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "however , its closeness to earth with a distance of merely 340 pc @xcite and the knowledge we have of its stellar and stellar wind parameters make wr  11 a prime target for numerical modeling . insights gained by reproducing the observed data with our models may be used to further constrain model parameters needed for the modeling of more complex systems . the ability to successfully model the observed @xmath1-ray emission will support the claim of association .    by performing three - dimensional magneto - hydrodynamic ( mhd ) simulation of wr  11 , wr  140 , and @xmath2 carinae",
    ", we strive to obtain a better understanding of the physics of colliding - wind binary systems , ultimately seeking an explanation for the apparent lack of @xmath1-ray emission in some of these systems . in this work we present our model results for wr  11 .",
    "following a procedure similar to the one detailed in @xcite and @xcite , we use the cronos - code @xcite to perform a threedimensional mhd simulation of the colliding - wind binary system .",
    "the stellar winds are implemented using a modified castor - abbott - klein ( cak ) approximation ( based on * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in additional to the eight mhd variables ( being density @xmath11 , velocity @xmath12 , temperature @xmath13 , and magnetic field strength @xmath14 ) ,",
    "we include 200 additional scalar fields representing electrons and protons at 100 energy bins in the range of 1 mev to 10 tev .",
    "the transport equation is solved in runtime along with the mhd equations and includes the relevant energy loss and gain mechanisms for the particles , as well as energy - dependent diffusion .",
    "simulations also consider the orbital motion of the stars .",
    "this method provides spectra of high - energy electrons and protons for every region of the simulated volume . following the procedure detailed in @xcite this distribution of particles",
    "is then used to compute leptonic and hadronic components of high - energy @xmath1-ray emission depending on the particles interaction with the surrounding radiation fields , magnetic fields , and wind plasma density .",
    "more details on the current mode of operation and the performance of our code  as it is used to model wr  11 and other colliding - wind binary systems  will be given in a subsequent publication on model results for the wr  11 system .",
    "here , we restrict ourselves to list a number of major challenges involved in the simulation .",
    "radiative braking occurs when the stellar wind in a binary system is efficiently slowed down by the radiative influence of the second star before it reaches the collision zone .",
    "there is evidence that this effect is important in wr  11 @xcite , as well as during the periastron passage of @xmath2  carinae ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the proper implementation of radiative braking is non - trivial as the computation of the force caused by one star s radiation field on the second star s wind is ambiguously treated in literature .",
    "there are the two possibilities of either using star - specific cak - parameters ( weak coupling ) or wind - specific cak - parameters ( strong coupling ) .",
    "numerical simulations of cwb - systems have hitherto predominantly used the former method ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , whereas theoretical papers on radiative inhibition and braking have generally applied the latter method ( e.g. , * ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we find that in the case of wr  11 sufficient agreement with observations from x - ray spectroscopy can only be achieved by using strong coupling .",
    "therefore we consistently use this method .",
    "care must be taken in the implementation of the magnetic field .",
    "the effect that a strong dipole field has on the wind plasma of a single has star has been studied by @xcite in great detail .",
    "its impact on the shape of and conditions at the wind collision region in a binary system were recently investigated by @xcite .",
    "it is shown that the wind - collision region can be significantly distorted by a strong magnetic field ( e.g. , b@xmath15=100  g ) .",
    "wind velocities towards the poles of the magnetic field are greatly increased . in order not to encounter the aforementioned distortions ,",
    "we choose a relatively low surface magnetic field of 10  g. although such a field does not have any significant influence on the wind structure , we find that it does leave a significant imprint on the electron distribution . where the poles of the magnetic dipole are close to the wind - collision region , synchrotron losses are high and electrons reach lower energies than along the magnetic equator where the field is weak .      whereas maximum electron energies are determined by synchrotron and inverse compton losses , which usually dominate the acceleration at higher energies , the maximum energies of the protons are determined by diffusion .",
    "an approximation often used is the bohm cutoff , which simply imposes a maximum energy at which the protons leave the shock fronts before being further accelerated .",
    "such an approximation is no longer necessary if an energy - dependent diffusion coefficient is used @xcite . in our model , we apply a diffusion coefficient of the form @xmath16 . according to literature , the exponent @xmath17 is generally set to @xmath18 for a kolmogorov type spectrum and to @xmath19 for a kraichnan type turbulence spectrum @xcite .",
    "we try both and compare it to the data .",
    "@xmath20 remains a free - parameter .",
    "although wr  11 has an eccentricity of 0.3 which is comparably low to the value of @xmath30.9 for @xmath2 carinae and wr  140 , the conditions at periastron and apastron are far from similar .",
    "whereas the flow downstream of the shock is fairly laminar around apastron , turbulence emerges as the system closes in on its periastron passage .",
    "it has also been studied to what degree the distortion of the wind - collision region caused by the orbital motion influences the particle distribution and @xmath1-ray emission .",
    "we find no significant difference in the final @xmath1-ray emission of a simulation that fully considers orbital motion compared to a simulation showing the steady state at ap- or periastron .",
    "in their analysis of high - resolution x - ray spectroscopy of chandra data , @xcite find evidence for a large shock - cone opening angle .",
    "they remark that simulations hitherto failed to reproduce such a feature which might be due to significant radiative braking . in our simulation , including the effects of radiative braking with strong coupling of the cak parameters , we can indeed reproduce this large - shock cone opening angle , which is most evident close to the periastron passage .",
    "figure [ 1 ] shows absolute velocity of the wind plasma for the apastron and periastron configuration.the opening angle is also indicated .",
    "the strong effect of radiative braking is clearly visible by the blue area upstream of the wind collision where the secondary wind is effectively slowed down by the primary star s radiation .",
    "also , the periastron plot displays the effect of shadowing where the secondary wind is accelerated less in the region where the primary star is eclipsed by the disk of the secondary . as mentioned above ,",
    "the shock is fairly laminar at apastron and more turbulent at periastron .",
    "the shock - cone opening angle is @xmath365@xmath21 for apastron and @xmath376@xmath21 for periastron .",
