    "a large class of disordered mean field spin models exhibit a behavior that is reminiscent of the structural glass transition in fragile glasses @xcite .",
    "as temperature is lowered , they undergo a _ ` dynamical phase transition ' _ characterized by a diverging relaxation time at a critical temperature @xmath4 .",
    "the reason for such a dynamical arrest can in turn be ascribed to ergodicity breaking : below @xmath4 the boltzmann measure decomposes into an exponential number of pure states .",
    "while equilibration is fast within each state , it takes an exponentially large ( in the system size ) time to equilibrate across states .    below @xmath4",
    ", the system can be meaningfully characterized through its _ complexity _",
    "@xmath5 , which gives the exponential growth rate of the number of pure states ( i.e. the number of such states is about @xmath6 , @xmath7 being the size ) .",
    "the complexity decreases as temperature is further lowered , and vanishes linearly at a second ( static ) transition temperature @xmath8 .",
    "this corresponds to an actual thermodynamic phase transition .",
    "a strikingly similar scenario has been found to hold in a large array of _ random constraint satisfaction _ @xcite problems of interest in theoretical computer science discrete variables in such a way to satisfy @xmath9 constraints . ] .",
    "the role of temperature is played here by the number of constraints per variable @xmath10 , while boltzmann distribution is replaced by the uniform measure over solutions of the problems . as the constraint density crosses a critical value @xmath11 , the set of solutions splits into ` lumps ' analogous to pure states . above a second threshold @xmath12",
    "the set of constraints becomes with high probability unsatisfiable .    in the last few years",
    "there has been a consistent effort in interpreting disordered mean field models as a genuine mean field theory for the structural glass transition .",
    "this is highly non - trivial since in any finite - dimensional model there can not be coexistence of an exponentially large number of pure states .",
    "imagine trying to select one such state through appropriate boundary conditions on a box of size @xmath13 .",
    "this will imply an energetic bias towards the selected state , which is of order @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is a surface tension exponent . on the other hand ,",
    "the entropic advantage of the other states is of order @xmath16 , because of their number .",
    "therefore , for @xmath17 , pure states are no longer stable .    according to the _ ` mosaic state ' _ scenario , below @xmath4 a typical configuration of the system can be described as a patchwork @xcite .",
    "each patch corresponds to the configuration being close to a particular pure state in a localized region whose length scale is @xmath18 . since @xmath19 at the static transition , the mosaic lengthscale diverges as @xmath20 with @xmath21 .",
    "while the mosaic scenario is appealing , its consistency and implications , as well as its precise meaning , are far from obvious .",
    "an important step forward was achieved in @xcite where a concrete `` gedanken experiment '' was introduced to define @xmath18 .",
    "this length scale was interpreted in @xcite as a _ point - to - set _ correlation length , and its divergence was rigorously proved to be equivalent to a divergent correlation time . in @xcite , @xmath18 was actually shown to diverge at @xmath8 in a class of disordered kac models with continuous scalar spins .    unhappily the models considered in @xcite can currently be treated only in the kac limit , and through somewhat formal techniques such as the replica method . as a consequence , many interesting questions ( such as the relevance of this limit for realistic interaction ranges , non - perturbative fluctuation effects , a precise definition of states ) can not be addressed in this context .",
    "the present paper aims at introducing a new class of models that share some features with the ones treated in @xcite , while being tractable within alternative approaches ( e.g. numerically ) .",
    "we follow the route of generalizing one of the ensembles of random constraint satisfaction problems mentioned above , and referred to as @xmath22-xorsat @xcite .",
    "we shall require constraints to have finite range with respect to an underlying one - dimensional geometry .",
    "our motivation is twofold : @xmath1 because of its underlying linear structure , the @xmath22-xorsat is very well understood . in particular a wealth of informations regarding pure states and their geometry is accessible through rigorous techniques @xcite ; @xmath2 the ensembles of random constraint satisfaction problems studied within the computer science and statistical mechanics communities have lacked so far any geometrical structure ( in physics terms , they are mean field models ) .",
    "this is of course a poor cartoon of real world instances , and it is surely instructive to explore alternative structured models .",
    "constraint satisfaction problems with finite interaction range were already considered in @xcite , without however considering the interaction range as a parameter .",
    "further , the most important questions that we shall consider in this paper were not studied there .",
    "several papers @xcite investigated the behavior of thermodynamic quantities and local order in kac spin glasses .",
    "finally a one - dimensional kac spin glass , with a different ( continuous ) phase transition was recently studied numerically in @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : definition ]",
    "we introduce our kac - xorsat model , and its variants , and discuss some of their most basic properties in section [ sec : simple ] .",
    "we investigate thermodynamic quantities ( in particular the ground state entropy ) in section [ sec : groundstate ] , and the correlation length divergence in section [ sec : pointtoset ] .",
    "finally a discussion of our results is presented in [ sec : discussion ] , and several technical details are contained in the appendices .",
    "let us recall that an instance of the @xmath22-xorsat problem is defined by an @xmath23 matrix binary @xmath24 , with row weight @xmath22 and a binary vector @xmath25 of length @xmath9 .",
    "solving such an instance requires determining whether the linear system @xmath26 admits a solution @xmath27 .",
    "this question is equivalent to asking whether the ground state energy of a certain ising spin model , is zero or not .",
    "more precisely , let @xmath28 $ ] denote the indices of the non - zero entries in the @xmath29-th row of @xmath24 , and @xmath30 ( here @xmath31 $ ] , and @xmath32\\equiv\\{1,\\dots , n\\}$ ] ) .",
    "the relevant spin model is defined by letting the energy of configuration @xmath33 be @xmath34 in the following we shall refer to a particular xorsat instance as to a ` formula ' or a ` sample ' .",
    "the random @xmath22-xorsat ( rxor ) ensemble is defined by letting @xmath24 be a uniformly random binary matrix ( with dimensions @xmath23 and row weight @xmath22 ) and @xmath25 a uniformly random vector in @xmath35 .",
    "it is also useful to consider the _ unfrustrated _ random @xmath22-xorsat ensemble , defined by setting @xmath36 ( the all @xmath37 s vector ) deterministically .",
    "such an ensemble exhibits a particularly rich behavior in the ` thermodynamic ' limit @xmath38 , @xmath39 with @xmath40 kept fixed .",
    "the _ kac @xmath22-xorsat _ ( kacxor ) ensembles add to the above features a one - dimensional ( or , in linear algebra terms , a band diagonal ) structure .",
    "one such ensemble is characterized by the parameters introduced so far , namely @xmath22 , @xmath41 , and @xmath10 , plus an ` interaction range ' @xmath42 . unlike in the rxor ensemble",
    ", @xmath10 is required to be in @xmath43 $ ] , although generalizations are not difficult .",
    "further , the interaction range is an integer such that @xmath44 .",
    "given such parameters , the matrix @xmath24 is sampled as follows .",
    "rows of @xmath24 are indexed by a subset @xmath45 of @xmath46 $ ] : for each @xmath47 , @xmath48 independently from the others with probability @xmath10 .",
    "in particular , the number of rows of @xmath24 , @xmath9 , is a binomial random variable @xmath49 as @xmath50 , the number of rows is with high probability , close to @xmath51 . for each @xmath48 , the corresponding row in @xmath24",
    "is sampled independently from the others by letting the indices of non - zero entries @xmath52 be a uniformly random subset of @xmath53 ( i.e. each of the @xmath54 subsets has the same probability ) .",

    "this corresponds to fixing @xmath73 ` outside ' @xmath74 .",
    "finally , we shall agree that , whenever considering the unfrustrated ensemble , the reference configuration will be the all @xmath75 s sequence @xmath76 .",
    "the most important feature of the rxor ensemble in the large size limit is that it undergoes a sat - unsat phase transition at well defined constraint density @xmath77 .",
    "more precisely , a random xorsat formula of the type ( [ eq : xorformula ] ) is solvable ( sat ) with high probability if @xmath78 , while it is not solvable ( unsat ) for @xmath79 @xcite .",
    "it is a convenient feature of xorsat that this phase transition can be studied by considering uniquely the unfrustrated ensemble .",
    "this simplification can be explained through the well - known identity @xmath80 where @xmath81 denotes the number of solutions of the homogeneous linear system @xmath82 @xmath83 .",
    "the identity holds irrespective of distribution of @xmath24 provided the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eq : xorformula ] ) , i.e. the vector @xmath25 , is uniformly random . in order to prove it ,",
    "it is sufficient to notice that @xmath84 is sat if and only if @xmath25 is in the image of @xmath24 .",
    "since the dimension of the image of @xmath24 is @xmath85 , this happens with probability @xmath86 . on the other hand , @xmath87 .",
    "equation ( [ eq : harmonic ] ) follows by taking expectation with respect to @xmath24 .    within the rxor ensemble , for @xmath78 , @xmath81",
    "is tightly concentrated around @xmath88 , implying @xmath89 .",
    "viceversa for @xmath79 , typically @xmath90 ( here @xmath91 denotes equality to leading exponential order ) , with @xmath92 and therefore the formula is sat with exponentially small probability .    furthermore , as long as the non - homogeneous solution has at least one solution , its number of solution is independent of @xmath25 , and is given by @xmath81 .",
    "even more , the set of solutions is an affine space obtained by translating the linear space of solutions of the homogeneous system . in other words , conditional to the problem being solvable ( which happens with high probability for @xmath78 ) the frustrated and unfrustrated ensemble are essentially equivalent .",
    "an important novelty within the kacxor ensemble is that the linear system ( [ eq : xorformula ] ) is always unsat with high probability if we let @xmath50 with @xmath93 fixed .",
    "more precisely , we expect that @xmath94 for some @xmath95 strictly positive and non - decreasing in @xmath10 .",
    "this phenomenon was already oserved in @xcite for a related model .",
    "the basic reason for this behavior is that small subsets of nearby rows of @xmath24 have a fair chance of being linearly dependent .",
    "if this is the case , the corresponding linear subsystem is unsolvable with finite probability . in the large @xmath41 limit ,",
    "the expected number of such substructures is of order @xmath41 , and the probability that none is present is exponentially small , thus leading to the above behavior .",
    "it is not difficult to prove the above statement , and indeed to prove lower bounds on the rate @xmath95 by combinatorial techniques .",
    "the basic idea is to select a particular type of substructure that leads to unsatisfiability and estimate the probability that no such substructure is present .",
    "the simple such substructure is obtained when two lines of @xmath24 coincide but the corresponding entries of @xmath25 do not . using janson inequality",
    "this yields @xmath96 where @xmath97 such a lower bound is easily seen to be strictly positive for @xmath10 small enough .",
    "we refer to appendix [ app : janson ] for a derivation of this formula .",
    "notice that the lower bound in eq .",
    "( [ eq : lowerboundprob ] ) vanishes as @xmath98 when @xmath99 .",
    "we expect the same behavior to hold for the actual exponent as long as @xmath10 is below the ( mean - field ) satisfiability threshold @xmath77 .",
    "explicitely @xmath100 where @xmath101 as @xmath102 .",
    "in the following we shall avoid dealing with the above phenomenon by focusing directly on the unfrustrated ensemble : this will enable us to use efficient linear algebra techniques for numerical computations .",
    "there are several justifications for doing this :    1 .",
    "the two ensembles become equivalent in the kac limit , which is our main concern here .",
    "we are interested in the long distance properties of the model , rather than in the effect of small substructures .",
    "we think that the two decouple for large @xmath42 .",
    "3 .   even if the frustrated ensemble is with high probability unsatisfiable , one can always consider ` almost satisfying ' configurations .",
    "equivalently , one can study the boltzmann measure for the energy ( [ eq : energy ] ) at a small non - vanishing temperature @xmath103 .",
    "we expect the effect of small frustrated substructures on the thermodynamics to be small , and indeed vanishing as @xmath104 for large @xmath42 .    in this perspective",
    ", we shall introduce an _ improved ensemble _ which reduces the effect of small substructured , while keeping the large @xmath42 behavior unchanged .",
    "this is particularly convenient in numerical simulations .    ,",
    "( [ eq : entropydensitydef ] ) , for the standard and improved ensembles . here @xmath105 and @xmath106 .",

    "in practice it can be excedingly difficult to sample matrices @xmath24 from such a conditional ensemble .",
    "we shall define the improved ensemble by the following sequential procedure .",
    "first generate the random set @xmath110 $ ] by letting @xmath111 independently for each @xmath112 with probability @xmath10 .",
    "the set @xmath45 will index lines of @xmath24 as above .",

    "we try to generate the line of @xmath24 indexed by @xmath115 by drawing its @xmath22 non - zero elements uniformly at random in @xmath116 .",
    "if the newly generated line has @xmath117 or @xmath22 non - vanishing entries in common with one of the previously generated lines @xmath118 , we reject it and re - sample it .",
    "we repeat the trial - rejection step for at most @xmath119 times . if no valid line is generate within this round , the whole system generated so - far is rejected and the procedure is re - initiated from scratch .",
    "we shall refer to the first ensemble introduced above as to the _ standard _",
    ", whenever it will be necessary to distinguish it from the _ improved _ ensemble . in fig .",
    "[ fig : standard_vs_improved ] we compare the @xmath99 behavior of the ground state entropy for the two ensembles .",
    "although the limits clearly coincide , the improved ensemble is close to it even for @xmath120 .",
    "the simplest thermodynamic quantity that is relevant for the study of the unfrustrated kacxor problem is the ground state entropy , i.e. the logarithm of the number of solutions of the linear system .",
    "let us denote by @xmath81 the number of solutions of the linear system ( [ eq : xorformula ] ) for a random binary matrix @xmath24 .",
    "then the average entropy density is defined as @xmath121 in order to compare analytical predictions and numerical data it will be convenient to define the ` subtracted ' entropy density @xmath122 , where @xmath123 . notice that @xmath124 is the naive prediction that would be obtained by assuming the lines of @xmath24 to be linearly independent .",
    "given a matrix @xmath24 , the corresponding number of solutions takes the form of a partition function @xmath125 where ( denoting by @xmath126 the sum modulo @xmath127 ) @xmath128 due to the finite interaction range @xmath42 , @xmath129 can be computed through a transfer matrix algorithm which recursively computes left and right partition functions , respectively @xmath130 and @xmath131 .",

    "the naive transfer matrix algorithm defined by the recursion ( [ eq : recpartfun ] ) has complexity that of order @xmath136 .",
    "this severely limits the interaction ranges that can be treated with this method : in practice we could deal at most with @xmath137 , which is far too small to address issues concerning the @xmath99 limit . in order to overcome this problem , we developed a transfer matrix algorithm that",
