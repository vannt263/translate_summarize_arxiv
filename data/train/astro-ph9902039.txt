    "high energy gamma rays produce muons when interacting in the earth s atmosphere",
    ". these can be efficiently detected , and the direction of the parent gamma ray reconstructed , in relatively shallow underground ",
    "neutrino \" detectors@xcite such as the now operating antarctic muon and neutrino detector array ( amanda)@xcite and lake baikal telescope@xcite .",
    "these instruments are positioned at a modest depth of order 1  kilometer and are therefore sensitive to muons with energies of a few hundred gev , well below the tev thresholds of other deep underground detectors such as superkamiokande and macro@xcite .",
    "they are therefore able to detect muons from primary gamma rays of tev energy and above , with a very large effective telescope area of @xmath0  @xmath1 , or more .",
    "they infer the photon direction by reconstructing the secondary muon track with degree - accuracy . although muons produced by gamma rays from astronomical sources compete with a large background of atmospheric cosmic ray - induced muons , during the short duration of a grb this background is manageable . using the time stamp provided by satellite observation ,",
    "the detector only integrates background over the very short time of the burst which is of order one second . unlike air cherenkov telescopes ,",
    "muon detectors cover a large fraction of the sky with a large duty cycle , e.g.  essentially 100% efficiency for more than a quarter of the sky in the case of the amanda detector with a south pole location .    in this paper",
    "we demonstrate how large area detectors operating with a few hundred gev muon threshold , or less , provide a unique window of opportunity for observing grb .",
    "while the fluxes of tev photons are reduced by one or more orders of magnitude compared to gev photons observed with satellites , and while only one percent of the gamma rays will produce a detected secondary muon , observation of grb is possible because the detectors are four orders of magnitude larger than , for example , the egret instrument on the compton gamma ray observatory@xcite .    by the most conservative estimates , we predict order 1 muon per year correlated in time and direction with grb for the operating detectors , and as high as 50 per year for the most conservative grb flux estimate normalized to the observed diffuse gev cosmic background@xcite .",
    "the unknown energetics of grb above gev may yield much higher rates ; see , for instance , ref.@xcite .",
    "interestingly , the muon count is similar for a single nearby burst at redshift @xmath2 , and a flux of a few muons or more in a 1  second interval in coincidence with a gamma ray burst can not be missed . for a cosmological distributions",
    "such an event occurs within @xmath3 years of observation , taking into account all observational constraints .",
    "failure to observe a signal within a few years would establish a cutoff on the grb flux not much above the gev - sensitivity of the operating detectors , or point to an unexpectedly large infrared diffuse background absorbing the tev gamma rays over cosmological distances .",
    "the two possibilities can be distinguished on the basis of observation of the occasional nearby burst .",
    "there is also the possibility of cosmological evolution of the sources .",
    "the observations are obviously relevant to the proposal that grb are the sources of the highest energy cosmic rays@xcite .    also of interest here",
    "is the milagro detector@xcite and the proposed hanul experiment in korea@xcite .",
    "although of more modest size compared to ",
    "neutrino \" telescopes , milagro s muon threshold is only @xmath4  gev because of its location at the surface .",
    "sensitivity to gamma rays of lower energy results in an increased flux , and compensates for its smaller effective area . we should here point out that milagro , as well as the other instruments discussed , have other capabilities to study grb . for instance",
    ", amanda has sensitivity to the mev neutrinos produced in the initial collapse@xcite , and to neutrinos of tev energy , and above@xcite .",
    "the milagro detector , beyond counting muons , can efficiently reconstruct gamma ray showers once their energy exceeds hundreds of gev@xcite .",
    "when gamma rays interact with the atmosphere they initiate cascades of electrons and photons , but also some muons .",
    "the dominant source of muons is the decay of charged pions which are photoproduced by shower photons .",
    "the number of muons with energy above @xmath5 in a shower initiated by a photon of energy @xmath6 was computed some time ago @xcite . for @xmath7 in the range 0.1 to 1 tev",
    "the number of muons in a photon shower can be parametrized as @xmath8 , \\label{param}\\ ] ] with energy in tev units .",
    "the parametrization is valid for @xmath9 .",
    "this parametrization is adequate to calculate muon rates in the amanda and baikal detectors since both have muon thresholds of the order of a few hundreds gev .    for muons energies below 0.1 tev ,",
    "muon decay and muon energy losses in the atmosphere must be taken into account . to accomplish this",
    "we have used a linear shower monte carlo simulation which follows all shower particles down to muon threshold .",
    "it accounts for all decay modes and energy losses@xcite .",
    "we have calculated the number of muons at sea level with energy above 1.5 gev , which is milagro s threshold for muon detection .",
    "we have parametrized the results as a function of initial photon energy at different zenith angles for use in subsequent calculations .",
    "the monte carlo calculates the production of muons by the decay of photoproduced pions .",
    "the photoproduction cross section is obtained by interpolation of @xmath10-proton data , including the most recent high energy measurements@xcite performed with accelerators .",
    "it is converted to a @xmath10-air cross section using the empirical @xmath11 dependence on the atomic number . a constant diffractive cross section of 0.194  mb proceeding via @xmath12 production has been included in the monte carlo simulation . for high energy muons",
    ", the monte carlo results are adequately parametrized by eq .",
    "we here neglected the production of muons by direct @xmath13-pair production and leptonic decay of charmed particles which only contribute to the flux of muons with energy above several tev@xcite .",
    "it is thought that grb are produced when a highly relativistic shock with lorentz factor of order 100 or higher dissipates its kinetic energy in collisions with the inter - stellar medium or in internal collisions within the relativistic ejecta .",
    "the observed @xmath10-rays are most likely produced by synchrotron radiation of electrons accelerated in the shock , possibly followed by inverse compton scattering , when the relativistic shell becomes optically thin to pair production@xcite .",
    "the observed injection rate in the universe is @xmath14 .",
    "interestingly , this is equal to the injection in cosmic rays beyond the ankle in the spectrum near @xmath15 tev@xcite .",
    "the batse satellite observes , on average , 1 grb per day with an efficiency of about @xmath16 .",
    "therefore the average energy emitted per burst , @xmath17 , is : @xmath18 @xmath19 is the burst rate . throughout our analysis",
    "we will assume a cosmological distribution of grb , with a distance of @xmath20 mpc to the average burst .",
    "assuming no beaming , this energy corresponds to an average fluency per grb , @xmath21 , close to the one observed : @xmath22 although in line with observations , this may be an underestimate because present detectors provide no information on the energetics of grb above gev - energy .",
    "some authors @xcite have , for instance , raised the interesting possibility that grb are the origin of the diffuse extragalactic gamma ray background .",
    "this association requires a photon energy of order @xmath23@xmath24 ergs per burst , depending on the grb occurrence rate assumed .",
    "most of this energy is concentrated in the high energy tail of the photon spectrum , above @xmath25 tev , and is therefore not included in the energy balance of equation  [ energy ] where only observed photons of gev - energy and below have been considered .",
    "there are models that can accommodate the large total energy required by this scenario , for instance those where a complete neutron star is converted into photons@xcite .",
    "a typical grb spectrum exhibits a high energy tail which , above a few hundreds kev , can be parametrized by a power law : @xmath26 where energies are in tev . typical values for the observed spectral index @xmath10 range from 0.8 to 1 @xcite .",
    "the photon spectrum of the average burst is normalized by energy conservation : @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the average duration of the burst of order 1 second .",
    "@xmath29 ( @xmath30 ) is the minimum ( maximum ) energy of the photons emitted by the burst . for @xmath29 we will use @xmath31 throughout .",
    "observations indicate indeed that a negligible fraction of the energy is emitted in x - rays .",
    "the tev flux obtained by extrapolation , is too low to be detected by the present satellite experiments because of their small telescope area .",
    "the high energy behavior of the grb spectrum is therefore a matter of intense speculation .",
    "bursts where isolated photons reach tens of gev energy have been detected , suggesting the extension of the spectrum to the tev range@xcite .",
    "as previously discussed , the extension of the photon spectrum to tev energy with a rather flat spectral index ( @xmath32 0.5 ) is an essential feature of models accommodating the diffuse gev background .",
    "also , the hegra group@xcite has observed an excess of gamma rays with @xmath3316 tev in temporal and directional coincidence with grb 920925c .",
    "the value of @xmath34 obtained through above normalization procedure is given by : @xmath35^{-1}~~{\\rm for}~~\\gamma\\ne 1~\\cr \\left[ln\\left({e_{\\gamma{\\rm max}}\\over e_{\\gamma{\\rm min}}}\\right)\\right]^{-1 } ~~{\\rm for}~~\\gamma=1 } \\label{fgamma}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] note that , to a first approximation , the normalization factor @xmath34 only depends on @xmath29 ( @xmath36 ) for @xmath37 ( @xmath38 ) .",
    "the reason for this is clear , when @xmath37 the spectrum is very steep and most of the grb energy is concentrated in lower energy photons . the situation is reversed in the case of @xmath38 .",
    "we will explore the dependence of the muon rate on @xmath10 further  on .",
    "absorption of gamma rays in the infrared , optical and microwave backgrounds is a determining factor in the gamma ray flux observed at earth .",
    "the mean free path of a tev photon in the diffuse background is thought to be less than a few hundred mpc , although this estimate is very uncertain because of our poor knowledge of the diffuse infrared background .",
    "nevertheless , for a cosmological population of astrophysical objects such as grb , absorption is expected to reduce the detected flux of tev photons .",
    "the detection could therefore be dominated by the closest bursts .",
    "we first compute @xmath39 , the number of muons with energy in excess of @xmath7 , produced in a photon shower of energy @xmath40 .",
    "the muon rate is subsequently derived by convolution with the gamma ray spectrum , @xmath41 here @xmath42 , the minimum photon energy needed to produce muons of energy @xmath7 , is given by @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is the zenith angle at which the source is observed .",
    "our results imply that the operating amanda , baikal and milagro detectors can do grb science in an energy range not covered by astronomical telescopes . while detection may be marginal for the most conservative estimates of the high energy grb flux , this will not be the case for future detectors on the drawing board such as amanda ii , icecube@xcite and antares@xcite .",
    "the vertical threshold for muon detection in the amanda detector at a 1.5  km depth is @xmath45  gev . for the shallower depth of lake baikal",
    "this threshold is @xmath46 gev . for threshold energies in this range we may make use of parametrization ( [ param ] ) which is adequate for @xmath7 between 0.1 and 1 tev@xcite .",
    "as previously mentioned , absorption of gamma rays in cosmological backgrounds has to be taken into account , as well as the source distribution of grb in redshift @xmath47 : @xmath48 where @xmath5 is the vertical threshold energy of the detector , in tev units .",
    "@xmath49 is the optical depth of a photon with energy @xmath40 originating at a distance @xmath47 . for illustration",
    ", we will use the diffuse photon background of reference @xcite throughout .",
    "@xmath50 is the cosmological distribution of grb , i.e.  the number of grb per unit time and distance @xmath47 .",
    "following @xcite we will assume cosmologically distributed standard candles with no source evolution .",
    "the grb distribution has been normalized to 365 events per year observed by batse below a redshift of @xmath51@xcite .",
    "@xmath52 is the effective area of the detector .",
    "the dependence of @xmath34 on the characteristics of the burst is given by eq.([fgamma ] ) , which can be used for scaling purposes .",
    "amanda and baikal observations require a time - stamp for background rejection , they can therefore only see bursts previously observed by satellite experiments .",
    "the batse rate of 1 burst / day corresponds to an isotropic distribution on the sky of 365 bursts / year . for the most conservative estimate with @xmath53 tev and a  standard \" burst with total energy @xmath54 ergs and a spectral index @xmath55",
    ", we predict 1 muon per year correlated in time and direction with grb for the amanda telescope , and 89 per year for the most conservative grb flux estimate normalized to the observed diffuse gev cosmic background@xcite .",
    "the unknown energetics of grb above gev may yield much higher rates ; see , for instance ref@xcite .",
    "the results are subject to the uncertainty associated with the absorption on infrared light which we computed following stecker@xcite .",
    "the rates are essentially the same for the lake baikal experiment .",
    "interestingly , the muon counts are similar for a single nearby burst at redshift @xmath2 , and a flux of a few muons or more in a 1  second interval in coincidence with a gamma ray burst provides a striking experimental signature which is hard to miss . in figs .  1 and 2 we plot the number of muons per burst versus spectral index @xmath10 for a burst at @xmath2 .",
    "we assume again that the photon spectrum only extends to @xmath53 tev with a total energy @xmath54 ergs .",
    "we assumed an effective area of @xmath56 for amanda and @xmath57 for the lake baikal detector@xcite .",
    "the results are shown with and without absorption on infrared light .",
    "also the dependence of the rate on zenith angle @xmath44 is illustrated .",
    "the rapid decrease of the number of events when @xmath44 increases is a consequence of the increase of the energy threshold because muons have to penetrate an increasing amount of matter to reach the detector .",
    "the smaller area of baikal is compensated by its lower muon threshold , especially for larger zenith angles .    in fig .",
    "3 we show the rate per burst in amanda detector as a function of redshift for a model with spectral index @xmath58 and total energy @xmath59 ergs . also shown is the flux for energetics@xcite which accommodates the diffuse gev background . absorption has been included , as in figs .  1 and 2 .",
    "shown as a dashed line is the number of days towards a burst at the corresponding redshift assuming the grb distribution of reference @xcite .",
    "an important question is whether the signal is observable given the large background of muons of cosmic ray origin penetrating the detectors .",
    "in this respect the great advantage of grb detection is that the detector only integrates background for the short duration of the burst , typically 1 second .",
    "furthermore , the background can be limited to a circle in the sky of angle @xmath60 around the direction of the burst . here",
    "@xmath60 is the angular resolution of the detector which is typically a few degrees .",
    "it can be sharpened up by quality cuts , but this inevitably results in a loss of effective area . the muon background intensity from cosmic ray showers",
    "@xmath61 has been measured@xcite .",
    "the muon background at zenith @xmath44 is given by : @xmath62 the signal - to - square root of noise then scales as @xmath63 which simply expresses that the sensitivity is improved for larger area and for better angular resolution . note that our search is not sensitive to photons produced over time - scales much larger than seconds , for instance to photons possibly produced by propagation of the external shock in the interstellar medium .",
    "in table i we present the number of muons per burst detected by amanda .",
    "the first column is the redshift of the burst , the second ( third ) column is the signal without ( with ) absorption of gamma rays in intergalactic backgrounds . in",
    "each columns the results is given for zenith angle @xmath64 and @xmath65 .",
    "the fourth column gives the signal to square root of noise corresponding to column 3 .",
    "the 5th column shows the time in days between bursts with @xmath47 lower than the value shown in the first column .",
    "we here assumed a  standard \" burst with spectral index @xmath66 and @xmath67 tev .              j.a .",
