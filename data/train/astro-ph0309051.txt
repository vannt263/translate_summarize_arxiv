    "the rotational curve of disc in the spiral galaxies shows the existence of dark matter in the halos of galaxies . massive compact halo objects ( machos ) like brown dwarfs , white dwarfs , neutron stars and black holes could be candidates for the baryonic component of the dark halo .",
    "the gravitational microlensing technique was proposed by paczyski ( 1986 ) for indirect detection of machos in the halo of our galaxy .",
    "the effect of microlensing is a temporary light amplification of background stars due to machos passing through our line of sight . since early 1990s several groups like agape , duo ,",
    "eros , macho , ogle and planet have contributed to this field and began monitoring millions of stars in the large and small magellanic clouds ( lmc and smc ) . in the direction of lmc ,",
    "the macho collaboration observed @xmath1 candidates from @xmath2 years observation of @xmath3 million stars ( alcock et al .",
    "eros also observed lmc-1 from eros i photometric plates ( ansari et al . 1996 ) and the other four events from eros ii ( lasserre et al .",
    "2000 ; spiro & lasserre 2001 ; milsztajn & lasserre 2001 ) .",
    "interpretation of the observed results within the framework of galactic models has been a matter of debate in recent years . by comparing the expected and the observed numbers of microlensing events , it is possible to evaluate the mass fraction of the halo in the form of machos and also the mean mass of machos . + as an example , in the standard galactic model , macho group obtained the optical depth of microlensing events @xmath4 in the direction of lmc ( alcock et al .",
    "2000 ) and this result is consistent with the theoretical expectation if @xmath5 times the halo mass in this model is made up of machos .",
    "the mean value of the duration of events also indicates that the mean mass of lenses should be @xmath6 , which means that the masses of machos are about the same as those of white dwarf stars .",
    "the eros group also put a constraint on the fraction of halo in the form of machos , with the masses of lenses in the range of @xmath7 to @xmath8 , excluding that no more than @xmath9 per cent of the standard halo is made of objects with up to one solar mass at @xmath0 per cent confidence ( spiro & lasserre 2001 ) .",
    "+ it should be mentioned that the conclusions of eros and macho groups on the contribution of machos to the mass of the dark halo and the mean mass of lenses is in some cases at variance with other observations .",
    "the outline of this contradiction is as follows ( gates & gyuk 2001 ) .",
    "* to allow the mass of the machos to be in the range proposed by microlensing observations , the initial mass function of macho progenitors of the galactic halo should be different from the disc ( adams & laughlin 1996 ; chabrier , segretain & mera 1996 ) .",
    "limits on the initial mass function of the halo arise from both low- and high - mass stars .",
    "low mass stars @xmath10 should still be active and visible , and heavy stars @xmath11 have evolved into type ii supernovae and have ejected heavy elements into the interstellar medium . *",
    "if there were as many white dwarfs in the halo as suggested by microlensing experiments they would increase the abundance of heavy metals via type i supernova explosions",
    ". canal , isern @xmath12 ruiz - lapuente ( 1997 ) used this phenomenon and showed that halo fraction in the white dwarfs has to be less than @xmath13 per cent . to be compatible with the gravitational microlensing results , they proposed that the star - formation process in the halo is possibly different from the local observations for single as well as binary stars . *",
    "recently green & jedamzik ( 2002 ) mentioned that the observed distribution of microlensing duration is not compatible with what is expected from the standard halo model .",
    "they showed that the distribution of microlensing candidates in terms of the duration of events is significantly narrower compared to that expected from the standard halo model at @xmath14 per cent confidence .    here",
    "we extend the earlier work of green & jedamzik ( 2002 ) ( i ) to include the eros microlensing events ( ii ) to take into account the contribution of the lmc and luminous components of the milky way in the microlensing events , and ( iii ) and finally to consider the non - standard halo models ( alcock et al .",
    "the mass function of lenses was chosen to be a dirac - delta function where the peak of the function and the fraction of halo in the form of machos in each galactic model are chosen according to the likelihood analysis of the macho group .",
    "we generate the expected distribution of events , using the observational efficiency of the experiments and compare them with the distributions of microlensing data .",
    "this comparison is performed by a monte - carlo simulation to generate the width and the mean of distribution and compare them with the observed data .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we give a brief review of galactic models and generate the expected distribution of events by considering the eros and macho observational efficiency .",
    "section 3 compares the expected distribution in the galactic models and observed data using statistical parameters .",
    "the results are discussed in section 4 .",
    "this section discusses the relevant components of the structure of the milky way , including : the power - law models of the milky way halo , luminous parts of milky way such as the disc and spheroid , and also the lmc itself .",
    "these elements can be combined to build various galactic models that have been discussed by alcock et al .",
    "( 1996 ) . here",
    "we use the mass function of the machos and their contribution to the mass of galactic halo according to the likelihood analysis of the macho group .",

    "the observational efficiencies of the eros and macho experiments are applied to obtain the expected distribution of events as a function of the duration of events in these models .",
    "here we use the largest known set of axisymmetric models of galactic halo , the so - called `` power - law galactic '' models ( evans 1994 ) .",

    "in this paper we have shown that in eight different galactic models for the milky way , there is discrepancy between the expected distribution of microlensing events in terms of the duration of events and the data from the microlensing experiments . according to the likelihood analysis of the macho collaboration , two parameters have been obtained from the comparison of the models with the microlensing data : ( i ) the typical macho mass and ( ii ) the fraction of the halo mass in the form of machos . to obtain the distribution of the duration of events",

    "the contribution of the `` known '' non - halo lenses in our calculation showed that this discrepancy may not be due to background events .",
    "one way to explain such a narrow distribution is that it could be due to the clumpy structure of machos with small intrinsic velocity dispersion along the line of sight .",
