    "in particle colliders , each beam experiences nonlinear forces when colliding with the opposing beam .",
    "a manifestation of these forces is a vibration of the bunch centroids around the closed orbit .",
    "these coherent beam - beam oscillation modes were observed in several lepton machines , including petra , tristan , lep , and vepp-2 m  @xcite . although their observation in hadron machines is made more challenging by the lack of strong damping mechanisms to counter external excitations , they were seen both at the isr and at rhic  @xcite .",
    "originally , one motivation for the study of coherent beam - beam modes was the realization that their frequencies may lie outside the incoherent tune distribution , with a consequent loss of landau damping  @xcite .",
    "the goal of the present research is to develop a new diagnostic tool to estimate bunch - by - bunch tune distributions , to assess the effects of gaussian electron lenses for beam - beam compensation  @xcite , and to provide an experimental basis for the development of beam - beam numerical codes .",
    "the behavior of colliding bunches is analogous to that of a system of oscillators coupled by the beam - beam force . in the simplest case ,",
    "when 2  identical bunches collide head - on in one interaction region , 2  normal modes appear : a @xmath1  mode ( or 0  mode ) at the lattice tune , in which bunches oscillate transversely in phase , and a @xmath2  mode , separated from the @xmath1  mode by a shift of the order of the beam - beam parameter , in which bunches are out of phase . in general , the number , frequency and amplitude of these modes depend on the number of bunches , on the collision pattern , on the tune separation between the two beams , on transverse beam sizes and on relative intensities .",
    "coherent beam - beam modes have been studied at several levels of refinement , from analytical linear models to fully 3-dimensional particle - in - cell calculations  @xcite .    in the tevatron , 36 proton bunches ( identified as p1p36 )",
    "collide with 36 antiproton bunches ( a1a36 ) at the center - of - momentum energy of 1.96  tev .",
    "there are 2 head - on interaction points ( ips ) , corresponding to the cdf and the dzero experiments .",
    "each particle species is arranged in 3  trains of 12  bunches each , circulating at a revolution frequency of 47.7  khz .",
    "the bunch spacing within a train is 396  ns , or 21 53-mhz rf buckets .",
    "the bunch trains are separated by 2.6-@xmath3s abort gaps .",
    "the synchrotron frequency is 34  hz , or @xmath4 times the revolution frequency .",
    "the machine operates with betatron tunes near  20.58 .",
    "the betatron tunes and tune spreads of individual bunches are among the main factors that determine beam lifetimes and collider performance .",
    "they are affected by head - on and long - range beam - beam interactions .",
    "three systems are currently used in the tevatron to measure incoherent tune distributions : the 21.4-mhz schottky detectors , the 1.7-ghz schottky detectors , and the direct diode detection base band tune ( 3d - bbq ) .",
    "the latter two can be gated on single bunches .",
    "detection of transverse coherent modes can complement these three systems because of its sensitivity , bunch - by - bunch capability , high frequency resolution , and fast measurement time .",
    "the basis for the measurement technique was presented in ref .",
    "@xcite , and preliminary results can be found in refs .",
    "several improvements , mainly in the data analysis , were implemented and presented in a concise report  @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we describe the detection technique in detail .",
    "we also present a wide set of measurements illustrating the performance of the device and the response of the coherent mode spectra to various experimental conditions , such as betatron tune separation , beam - beam parameter , and collision pattern .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     [ tab : experimental_conditions ]                                    transverse coherent mode spectra were measured for both proton and antiproton bunches under a wide range of experimental conditions .",
    "a few representative examples are discussed in this section .",
    "the machine and beam parameters relevant to the results presented below are collected in table  [ tab : experimental_conditions ] .",
    "repeatability of the measurement was tested with antiprotons towards the end of store  7719 , when lattice tunes were kept constant and the beam - beam parameter was varying slowly .",
    "figure  [ fig : store7719_repeatability ] shows the results of 10  consecutive measurement cycles on antiproton bunches  a13 and  a14 .",
    "the frequency resolution of single modes is high ( 52,488 turns were analyzed in this case ) .",
    "one may note the stability of the frequencies and the different distribution of amplitudes between the two bunches .",
    "the amplitude of each mode shows some variability , as it depends on the timing of the excitation and its duration , which were manually controlled .    at injection ( 150  gev ) during store  7706 , while antiprotons were being loaded into the machine on a separate orbit , the proton signal showed peaks at the injection lattice tunes ( 0.585 in the horizontal plane and 0.580 in the vertical one ) , even without excitation ( figure  [ fig : store7706_comparison ] , top ) . at collisions , it was usually necessary to apply the excitation to see a signal .",
    "when the excitation was applied , the signal was enhanced by at least a factor  10 and the pattern of transverse coherent beam - beam modes appeared ( figure  [ fig : store7706_comparison ] , center and bottom ) .",
    "the inset at the bottom of figure  [ fig : store7706_comparison ] shows that the frequency resolution is high enough to separate individual modes .",
    "the amplitude of the signal without excitations and a comparison with the low - frequency beam jitter allows one to estimate the absolute magnitude of the coherent oscillations .",
    "for instance , if one takes a typical signal - to - background ratio of 80 for the low - frequency motion , which corresponds to an amplitude of @xmath5 , one obtains an amplitude of @xmath6 for a signal - to - background ratio of 1.2 at the frequencies of interest .",
    "this translates into @xmath7 for the average amplitude function of 75  m around the tevatron ring ( see also ref .",
    "this is to be taken as a rough estimate , as the signal is often below the detection limit and it varies from store to store .",
    "another example of signals measured without excitation is shown in figure  [ fig : store7679_comparison ] .",
    "data was collected during store  7679 for antiproton bunch  a25 at top energy after the low - beta squeeze , after initiating collisions , and after scraping the halo .",
    "one can see slowly damped oscillations around @xmath8 and their synchrotron sidebands .    during store  7724 ,",
    "the signals of protons and antiprotons were compared ( figure  [ fig : store7724_a14vp14 ] ) . for equal beam intensities , emittances and tunes , one would expect to observe the same modes in both beams .",
    "the elapsed time between the two sets of measurements was necessary to swap cables and re - equalize the signals .",
    "the structure of the spectra is similar , but the antiproton distribution is wider . from this",
    ", one can infer that the antiproton beam - beam parameter was larger .",
    "the calculated values were @xmath9 and @xmath10 at each of the 2 collision points .",
    "an example of bunch - by - bunch measurements for protons during store  7706 is shown in figure  [ fig : store7706_bunch_spectra ] .",
    "the signal from all 12  bunches in a train was recorded for 12,382  turns .",
    "all bunches show very similar spectra except for p12 , for which stronger lower modes are present ( indicated by the arrow ) , probably due to long - range interactions .",
    "figure  [ fig : store7711_pqchange ] shows an example of the response of the proton coherent mode spectra to changes in the vertical proton lattice tune during store  7711 .",
    "the lattice setting of @xmath11  was changed from @xmath12 to @xmath13 with respect to the nominal value .",
    "the average incoherent tunes measured by the 1.7-ghz  schottky detectors are also shown for comparison ( circles and triangles ) . in this experiment ,",
    "the vertical beam - beam parameter for protons ( @xmath14 ) was about twice as small as the one for antiprotons .",
    "a special store with only 3 equally spaced proton bunches colliding with 3 antiproton bunches was studied for beam - beam compensation purposes ( store  7893 ) . during this store ,",
    "the signal from 3  systems was recorded : the 1.7-ghz schottky monitor , the 21-mhz schottky monitor , and the coherent mode detector described in this paper ( figure  [ fig : store7893_3x3_comparison ] ) .",
    "unfortunately , transverse beam sizes were large , making the beam - beam parameter quite small .",
    "however , this measurement illustrates the unique features of each system .",
    "the 1.7-ghz schottky monitor has bunch - by - bunch capability and good separation of the proton and antiproton signals .",
    "it is routinely used to report the average tune of each beam every minute . because it operates at a large harmonic number ( @xmath15 ) , the sidebands contain a large number of synchrotron satellites and their widths",
    "are dominated by the momentum spread of the beam .",
    "the 21-mhz schottky system has better frequency resolution , but it can not distinguish protons from antiprotons and it is not gated to individual bunches .",
    "the coherent - mode detector has high frequency resolution and fast bunch - by - bunch response .",
    "it currently requires excitation of the beam , but this limitation can be overcome by automatically filtering and equalizing the signals to extend its dynamic range .",
    "the interpretation of the spectra for large beam - beam parameters , high number of bunches , and complex collision patterns can also be considered a limitation .",
    "an illustration of the evolution of transverse coherent modes over a complete store is shown in figure  [ fig : store7754_evolution ] for vertical antiproton oscillations . as expected , on",
    "can see that as the beam - beam force weakens , the spread in coherent modes decreases .",
    "over the course of a store , the lattice tunes need to be periodically adjusted to keep the average incoherent tune close to the desired working point .",
    "the bare lattice tune for antiprotons ( black triangles ) and for protons ( empty triangles ) is estimated from the machine settings and their calibration .",
    "the vertical gray lines represent the prediction of the simplified model presented in section  [ sec : model ] using the estimated bare lattice tunes and the beam - beam parameters calculated from the measured beam intensities and synchrotron - light emittances . except for the last two measurements , which may be affected by the evolving linear coupling and by a slight miscalibration of the tune settings",
    ", one can see that the estimated lattice tune lies below the first group of eigenmodes , and that the predicted eigenfrequencies are close to the measured peaks . obviously , the measured spectra are richer than those predicted by the simplified model , and a complete explanation requires a more detailed description of the beam dynamics , such as the one found in ref .",
    "@xcite based on a 3-dimensional strong - strong particle - in - cell beam - beam code .",
    "a system was developed to measure the spectra of coherent beam - beam oscillations of individual bunches in the tevatron .",
    "it is based on the analysis of the digitized signal from a single beam - position monitor .",
    "it requires applying band - limited noise to the beam , but an extension of its dynamic range should be possible , if needed , so as to operate without excitation .",
    "the device has a response time of a few seconds , a frequency resolution of @xmath0 in fractional tune , and it is sensitive to oscillation amplitudes of 60  nm . in terms of sensitivity , resolution , and background level , it provides a very clean measurement of coherent oscillations in hadron machines .",
    "the system complements schottky detectors and beam transfer function measurements as a diagnostic tool for tunes , tune spreads , and beam - beam effects .",
    "it was confirmed that coherent oscillations in the tevatron are stable , probably thanks to the different intensities of the two beams , their tune separation , and chromaticity .",
    "the average amplitude of the oscillations around the ring was estimated to be of the order of 20  nm .",
    "a simplified collision model was used to calculate mode eigenfrequencies and to show their dependence on the beam - beam coupling .",
    "it was compared with observations made over the course of a collider store , as the strength of the beam - beam force decreased with time .",
