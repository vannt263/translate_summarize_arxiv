    "crystallization , during which a material transforms from a dense , amorphous liquid to a crystalline solid , occurs via the nucleation and subsequent growth of small crystalline domains  @xcite .",
    "crystallization in metals has been intensely studied over the past several decades with the goal of developing the ability to tune the microstructure to optimize the mechanical properties of metal alloys  @xcite . however , in - situ observation of crystallization in metallic melts is limited due to the rapid crystallization kinetics of metals  @xcite .",
    "in contrast , bulk metallic glasses ( bmgs ) , which are amorphous metal alloys , can be supercooled to temperatures below the solidus temperature @xmath10 and persist in a dense , amorphous liquid state over more than @xmath11 orders of magnitude in time scales or viscosity  @xcite .",
    "deep supercooling of bmgs provides the ability to study crystallization on time scales that are accessible to experiments  @xcite .",
    "these prior experimental studies have uncovered fundamental questions concerning crystallization kinetics in bmgs .",
    "for example ,",
    "when a bmg in the glass state is heated to a temperature @xmath12 in the supercooled liquid region , crystallization is much faster than crystallization that occurs when the metastable melt is cooled to the same temperature @xmath13  @xcite .",
    "asymmetries in the crystallization time scales upon heating versus cooling of up to two orders of magnitude have been reported in experiments  @xcite .",
    "the asymmetry impacts industrial applications of bmgs because rapid crystallization upon heating limits the thermoplastic forming processing time window for bmgs  @xcite .",
    "recent studies have suggested that the asymmetry in the crystallization time scales originates from the temperature dependence of the the nucleation and growth rates  @xcite , _",
    "i.e. _ that the nucleation rate is maximal at a temperature below that at which the growth rate is maximal .",
    "according to this argument , crystallization upon heating is faster because of the growth of the nascent crystal nuclei that formed during the thermal quench to the glass .",
    "in contrast , crystallization is slower upon cooling since crystal nuclei are not able to form at high temperatures in the melt .",
    "however , there has been no direct visualization of the crystallization process in bmgs , and it is not yet understood why the asymmetry varies from one bmg to another  @xcite and how sensitively the asymmetry depends on the cooling rate @xmath2 used to prepare the glass .",
    "an improved , predictive understanding of the crystallization process in bmgs will aid the design of new bmg - forming alloys with small crystallization asymmetry ratios and large thermoplastic processing time windows .",

    "we show that these results are consistent with predictions from classical nucleation theory ( cnt ) that the maximal growth rate occurs at a higher temperature than the maximal nucleation rate and that the separation between the nucleation and growth peaks increases with the gfa .",
