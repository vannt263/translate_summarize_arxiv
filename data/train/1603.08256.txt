    "these include the study of slow light , the wess - zumino - witten ( wzw ) model , and the mathematical theory of hypoelliptic operators .",
    "of particular interest in this paper , the model described by @xmath6 is also classically dual to the well - studied principal chiral model , described by the action    s_2=_2dxdt=  \\ { ( g^-1)^2-c^2(g^-1g)^2 } dxdt    where @xmath7 .",
    "this is a special case of the nonlinear sigma model , with target space @xmath8 .    despite their classical equivalence , @xmath6 and @xmath9 lead to entirely different quantum theories .",
    "@xmath9 gives an asymptotically free theory : at short distances @xmath10 , giving us free massless excitations .",
    "but the true particles that survive to long distances are bound states of non - zero mass @xcite . for this reason , the principal chiral model is often used as a toy model for 4-dimensional yang - mills theory , notorious for its mathematical complexity . not only",
    "do the two theories share similar short - distance behavior , but the existence of a mass gap in the principal chiral model has served as a proof of concept for the conjectured mass gap in yang - mills ( though neither can yet be proven with full mathematical rigor ) .",

    "the behavior of quantum field theories at high coupling is notoriously intractable , and the physical meaning of such theories is still up for debate .",
    "for this reason , it is still necessary to search for simple examples of such theories and try to gleam what meaning , if any , they have in the short distance limit .",
    "in addition to sharing short - distance behavior , both the @xmath6 model and @xmath0 theory can be described by hypoelliptic hamiltonian operators with a step-3 nilpotent bracket algebra , suggesting some algebraic structure in common ( section [ sub ] and appendix [ sec : appendix : nilpotent ] ) .",
    "the @xmath6 model s relative simplicity makes it a good candidate for attempting to probe the high coupling regime of field theories in general , but the connection to @xmath0 theory seems the closest .",

    "we take the modest approach of finding nonlinear wave - type solutions to the classical model which survive the @xmath12 limit ( section [ sec : reduction - mech ] ) .",
    "this set of solutions defines a mechanical system or `` reduced system '' in each of the dual models .",

    "we quantize these collective variables to determine their dispersion relation ( section [ sec : reduced_system_quant ] ) in the short distance limit for each theory .",
    "we have in mind the sine - gordon theory , whose solitons turn out to be the fundamental constituents which bind to form the scalar particles @xcite .",

    "it has been noted in that literature @xcite that when the speed of light in a medium is small , nonlinear effects are magnified .",
    "although the specific equations appearing there are different , it is possible that the solutions of the sort we study are of interest in that context as well .    from a field",
    "theoretic context , the equivalence of these limits seems troubling . at short distances",
    ", the highly - coupled theory will not be relativistic .",
    "it is a sort of `` post - relativistic '' regime , where @xmath22 .",
    "this is much the opposite of the case in the theory of @xmath9 ; there the short - distance excitations are massless , but form massive bounds states which survive to long distances and can be non - relativistic in the traditional @xmath33 sense .",
    "perhaps some exotic excitations at high coupling are in fact the fundamental constituents in the @xmath34-model , forming as bound states the ordinary massless particles which appear in the long distance limit . as we know from the quark model ,",
    "the short distance excitations do not need to be particles in the usual sense ; they could be confined . in any case , it is important to know what solutions might survive the high coupling limit , whether they be unphysical or simply unintuitive .",
    "we will see an example of wave solutions which classically survive the @xmath22 limit , continuing to propagate through nonlinearity alone .",
    "since the energy density is constant , these solutions do not violate causality : they are analogous to the continuous wave solutions in a medium where the phase velocity is greater than @xmath23 .      many physical problems ( yang - mills , fluid mechanics ) become intractable in the strong coupling limit where the non - linearities dominate",
    ". it would be nice to have a unified geometric approach to understanding these systems .",
    "we have such an approach in the weak coupling limit : small perturbations around a stable equilibrium are equivalent to a harmonic oscillator .",
    "a larger picture emerges if we think in terms of riemannian and sub - riemannian geometry .",
    "the orbits of many mechanical systems of physical interest ( again , yang - mills or incompressible fluids ) can be thought of as geodesics in some appropriate riemannian manifold . in the simplest case",
    ", the harmonic oscillator describes geodesics in the heisenberg group .",
    "the anharmonic oscillator ( and many nonlinear field theories with quartic coupling ) can also be thought of as geodesic motion on a nilpotent lie group , by introducing an additional generator ( see appendix [ sec : appendix : nilpotent ] for more detail ) .    in the limit of strong coupling ,",
    "the metric degenerates and becomes sub - riemannian @xcite .",
    "that is , the contravariant metric tensor has some zero eigenvalues so that it can be written as @xmath35 for some vector fields @xmath36 whose linear span may be smaller than the tangent space .",
    "moreover , in the cases of interest , these vector fields satisfy the celebrated hrmander condition : @xmath36 along with their repeated commutators span the tangent spaces at every point . in such a case , there are still geodesics connecting every pair of sufficiently close points ( chow - rashevskii theorem , @xcite ) .",
    "thus , we can define a distance between pairs of points as the shortest length of geodesics .",
    "these ideas came to the notice of many physicists following a model for the self - propulsion of an amoeba @xcite , though they have roots in the carnot - caratheodory geometric formalism of thermodynamics and in control theory .",
    "hrmander @xcite discovered independently that the same criterion is sufficient for the sub - riemannian laplace operator @xmath37 to be _",
    "hypoelliptic _ , meaning the solution @xmath38 to the inhomogenous equation @xmath39 is smooth whenever the source @xmath40 is smooth .",
    "this can be thought of the quantum version of the above condition on subgeodesic connectivity .",
    "this kind of sub - riemannian geometry may present a powerful geometric framework for strongly - coupled field theories .",
    "the example we work out in this paper is arguably the simplest interesting case of a strongly coupled field theory , and the solutions we study correspond to sub - riemannian geodesics in the limit @xmath41 .",
    "we hope to apply such geometric ideas to other cases in the future , using this as a prototype .",

    "its representation on the space of functions of @xmath212 is what we used to quantize the theory . in the dual picture",
    "the poisson brackets would not be nilpotent : the lie algebra it is the semi - direct product of @xmath8 with an abelian algebra .",
    "interestingly , we find that some of the most important field theories of particle physics can be described in this way .",
    "the bosonic part of the standard model consists of yang - mills theory coupled to a higgs sector described as a @xmath0 scalar field theory .",
    "pure @xmath0 theory ( without coupling to fermions ) in 4 dimensions remains intractable in the short distance limit : is not an asymptotically free theory .",
    "we see here that it follows from a hamiltonian with one degree of extra nilpotency in the bracket algebra .",
    "this suggests that perhaps the theory is easier tamed with an algebraic approach .",
    "another famously puzzling theory , yang - mills theory , can be cast in the same language . here",
    "the poisson brackets and hamiltonian are best expressed in terms of the electric field @xmath215=\\int e^{bi}a_{bi}dx\\ ] ] ( where @xmath216 is a smooth test function ) and the magnetic field",
    "@xmath217 : @xmath218,b\\}&=da+[a , a],\\\\ \\nonumber & \\{e[a],a\\}&=a,\\\\ & \\{a_{aj}(x)_{,}a_{bj}(y)\\}&=0,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath219 yang mills theory , however , is an asymptotically free theory .",
    "the fact that it can be brought to the same form as pure @xmath0 theory suggests some commonality in structure of the two theories , though they might appear glaringly different due to their short - distance behavior .",
    "we pause to note that not all systems are nilpotent .",
    "the simplest example would be the rigid rotor , whose bracket algebra is that of angular momentum , where repeated commutators do not vanish .",
    "such a lie algebra is perhaps misleadingly labeled as _ simple _ in the mathematics literature .",
    "also , the euler equations of an ideal fluid can be formulated with a quadratic hamiltonian on the lie algebra of vector fields .",
    "nilpotent lie algebras could be useful as approximations here .",
    "it is natural , in nilpotent lie algebras , to take the singular limit of the metric where the coefficient of the higher - step generators shrinks to zero .",
    "( this geometry has been well - studied in the simplest case of the heisenberg group @xcite ) .",
    "this is precisely the strong coupling limit @xmath11 of our theory : the second term in the hamiltonian @xmath222dx$ ] tends to zero . in this limit",
    "the co - metric is not invertible .",
    "the resulting sub - riemannian geometry still has geodesics connecting nearby points : the hormander condition is satisfied because the commutator of the surviving generators @xmath223 generate the remaining ones @xmath224 .",
    "the chow - rashevsky theorem does not directly apply here as we are dealing with an infinite dimensional manifold .",
    "but , it does suggest that there are propagating solutions even in the limit @xmath41 .",
    "we found some examples numerically first , and then found analytic solutions including these examples .",
    "so at least in this case , the intuition provided by the sub - riemannian geometry was useful in understanding the strong coupling limit ."
