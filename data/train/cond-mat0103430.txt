    "recently , the role played by geometrical frustration in strongly correlated electron systems has attracted renewed interests.@xcite the pyrochlore lattice , namely , corner - sharing tetrahedra ( fig.1 ) , is one of the typical system in which the geometrical frustration is crucial to determine its properties . here",
    "we investigate effects of geometrical frustration on itinerant electron systems based upon the pyrochlore hubbard model .",
    "one of the purpose of this paper is to investigate the mott transition in the absence of magnetic long - range order . according to the study of the heisenberg model on the pyrochlore lattice ,",
    "it has been pointed out that the ground state of the insulating state is quantum disordered spin liquid.@xcite the critical character of the mott transition without magnetic order is quite different from that accompanying antiferromagnetic one .",
    "moreover the character of the quantum spin liquid has not yet been unveiled sufficiently .",
    "it is expected that the study from electron systems will shed new light on this subject .",
    "another purpose of this paper is to reveal how the geometrical frustration affects strong electron correlation effects in the metallic state .",
    "some recent experiments on the pyrochlore itinerant electron systems have reported that remarkable heavy - fermion - like behaviors manifest in these systems implying the crucial role of the geometrical frustration.@xcite here we show that the heavy - fermion state is realized in the pyrochlore hubbard model in the vicinity of the half - filling .",
    "we also show that the dynamical spin susceptibility obtained from our model away from the half - filling is consistent with recent neutron scattering experiments for itinerant pyrochlore systems.@xcite    the organization of this paper is as follows . the model and the basic method",
    "are given in sec .",
    "ii . in sec .",
    "iii , we discuss about the mott transition and the realization of the quantum disordered spin liquid in the half - filling case . in sec .",
    "iv , we consider the hole - doped case focusing on the heavy fermion state and its magnetic properties .",

    "the hamiltonian of the model is given by ,    @xmath0    2 here @xmath1 is an annihilation ( creation ) operator of electrons with spin @xmath2 on the @xmath3-th site of the @xmath4-th tetrahedron . @xmath5 .",
    "the kinetic term is diagonalized as , @xmath6 , where @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 with @xmath10 .",
    "the basis in the diagonalized space is obtained from the canonical transformation , @xmath11 . using the abbreviation , @xmath12 etc .",
    ", we write down @xmath13(k ) , @xmath14 where @xmath15 , and , @xmath16 for @xmath17 , where @xmath18^{\\frac{1}{2}}$ ] , and , @xmath19 for @xmath20 .",
    "the expressions of @xmath21 and @xmath22 are very complicated .",
    "however in the following , we need only @xmath21 for small @xmath23 , which is given by , @xmath24    at the half - filling , in the absence of electron - electron interaction , @xmath25 and @xmath26 are filled completely , and the two degenerate flat bands are empty .",
    "@xmath25 touches with the two flat bands at the @xmath27 point of the brillouin zone .",
    "this state is a gapless band insulator .",
    "we now consider the effect of electron interaction on this state .",
    "since , in the case of the half - filling or in the vicinity of the half - filling , the band @xmath26 is sufficiently far from the fermi level , it does not affect low energy properties and is negligible in the following argument .",
    "then , the single - particle green s functions of @xmath28-electron are determined by the following equation . @xmath29",
    "g^{(\\lambda\\nu)}_k(\\varepsilon)=\\delta_{\\mu\\nu}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we put the chemical potential @xmath30 . in general , the off - diagonal self - energy @xmath31(@xmath32 ) is not negligible . however , in the vicinity of the @xmath27 point , at which the most important scattering processes occur , the off - diagonal terms vanish because of the momentum dependence of @xmath33 .",
    "thus in the following argument , we neglect the off - diagonal self - energy .",
    "to investigate the electronic state at the half - filling , we calculate the self - energy .",
    "recently , isoda and mori obtained the diagonal self - energy of this model up to the second order in @xmath34,@xcite which is given by , @xmath35 for @xmath36 .",
    "however , as will be shown here , the higher order corrections to the self - energy give rise more singular contributions and a drastic change of the electronic state , namely , the mott transition .    fig .",
    "2 . the most singular diagrams of the self - energy up to the forth - order in @xmath34 . @xmath37 denotes @xmath38-electron .",
    "@xmath39 denotes @xmath40 or @xmath41-electron .",
    "the dotted line denotes the interaction @xmath34 .    at the half - filling",
    ", the @xmath25-band is completely filled , while the flat bands are empty .",
    "hence , at zero temperature , particle - particle channel between @xmath38-electron and @xmath40 or @xmath41-electron vanishes . on the other hand ,",
    "particle - hole channel gives non - vanishing contributions only for the pair of @xmath38-electron and @xmath40 or @xmath41-electron .",
    "then the most singular diagrams up to the forth order in @xmath34 are those shown in fig.2 .",
    "since the fermi level is at the position between the two flat bands and @xmath25-band , we shift the chemical potential infinitesimally , @xmath42 . after integrating over energy and momentum , we take the limit @xmath43 .",
    "this procedure is required in this singular perturbative calculation to fix the density of electrons @xmath44 .",
    "neglecting the momentum dependence of @xmath33 does not affect the leading singular behaviors .",
    "then , we can carry out the calculation analytically.@xcite for @xmath36 , we obtain , @xmath45 where @xmath46 is a positive constant of order unity .",
    "the real part of the self - energy for hole - like excitations is divergent .",
    "the same divergent behavior appears in the imaginary part , however , for particle - like excitations .",
    "higher order corrections also show stronger divergence .",
    "this divergent behavior means that the unperturbed state is unstable in the presence of electron correlation and that the single particle energy gap is generated . to see this we take only up to the third order term of the self - energy .",
    "hole - like excitations are possible only for @xmath25-band in the half - filling case at zero temperature .",
    "thus the single particle energy of this band measured from the fermi level is changed to @xmath47 for @xmath48 .",
    "@xmath25 band is pushed down to the lower energy , and the energy gap opens between the flat bands and @xmath25-band .",
    "this gap generation due to electron correlation signifies that the systems is in the mott insulating state .",
    "although the exact magnitude of the gap should be determined by taking into account higher order corrections in @xmath34 , the gapful state is the self - consistent solution for non - vanishing @xmath34 .",
    "thus an infinitesimally small @xmath34 drives the system into the mott insulator at the half - filling . in the ground state",
    ", the two bands below the gap , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , are filled with up and down spins .",
    "hence the system is in the spin singlet state .",
    "it should be stressed that , after the mass gap generation , the singularities of the perturbative expansion are eliminated , and as a result , the gapful state is stabilized even if one take into account higher order corrections , which just renormalize the magnitude of the gap .      to see the magnetic property of the mott insulating state obtained in the previous section , we compute spin - spin correlation functions , @xmath49 , where @xmath50 .",
    "we carry out perturbative expansion in terms of @xmath34 using the green s function of the gapful state , @xmath51^{-1}$ ] , as the unperturbed propagator . calculating the diagrams up to the third order in @xmath34",
    ", we have , @xmath52 with @xmath53 a step function .",
    "the spin gap exists between the spin singlet ground state and the triplet state .",
    "thus the system is in the quantum disordered spin liquid state without magnetic long - range order .",
    "the result may not be changed qualitatively by higher order corrections .",
    "these results are consistent with the previous studies for the pyrochlore heisenberg model.@xcite the singularity of the self - energy ( [ reself ] ) is deeply related with the accidental degeneracy at the @xmath27 point in the momentum space , which may cause an instability of lattice structure",
    ". this property may be relevant to the metal - insulator transition of @xmath54 , which accompanies a structure change.@xcite",
    "in the hole - doped case , the singularities appeared in the half - filling case are eliminated by the presence of the cutoff which is the chemical potential @xmath55 measured from the half - filling level .",
    "then the fermi liquid metallic state is realized .",
    "however , in the vicinity of the half - filling , the effective mass is much enhanced by electron correlation . up to the third order in @xmath34 , the leading term of the mass enhancement factor",
    "@xmath56 is , @xmath57 as the electron filling approaches the half - filling value @xmath58 , the mass enhancement factor shows the divergent behavior indicating the precursor of the mott transition .",
    "such a large mass enhancement is actually observed in the specific heat measurement for some pyrochlore itinerant systems like @xmath59.@xcite    = 5.5 cm    fig .",

    "the brighter regions have the stronger intensity .",
    "( b ) the neutron cross section .",
    "the largely enhanced effective mass obtained in the previous section is a remarkable property of geometrically frustrated electron systems in which several modes of spin fluctuations compete with each other , and magnetic long - range order is suppressed .",
    "the spin fluctuation is almost localized in real space as in the case of @xmath61-electron based heavy fermion systems .",
    "this property is seen more clearly in the momentum dependence of the spin - spin correlation function .",
    "we calculate it by the perturbative calculation .",
    "since the magnetic frustration is so strong , any approximations which neglect the coupling between several modes of spin fluctuation like random phase approximation(rpa ) or fluctuation exchange approximation(flex ) are invalid for this system .",
    "actually the most singular contributions up to the order of @xmath62 comes from the diagrams shown in fig.3 . to simplify the calculation we exploit the following approximation .",
    "near the half - filling , the momenta running in @xmath63-line take small values in the vicinity of the fermi surface .",
    "moreover for small @xmath23 , @xmath64 does not depend on @xmath65 .",
    "thus we can separate the integral over @xmath65 and the angle for the momenta running in @xmath63-line . then , the spin - spin correlation function is decomposed into the momentum part and the energy part , @xmath66 .",
    "such a factorization of the spin - spin correlation function is indeed observed in an inelastic neutron scattering experiment for @xmath59.@xcite the energy part is given by , @xmath67 for small @xmath68 . here",
    "@xmath40 , @xmath41 are constants . thus in the vicinity of the half - filling , spin fluctuation is much enhanced .",
    "the presence of the giant spin fluctuation is also consistent with several experiments for itinerant pyrochlore systems.@xcite it is noted that such a large enhancement of @xmath69 is not obtained by rpa or flex approximations for the appropriate value of @xmath34 .",
    "we calculate the structure factor @xmath70 numerically . in fig.4(a ) , we plot the intensity of @xmath60 in the [ 110]-[001 ] plane of the reciprocal lattice .",
    "@xmath60 is almost constant in the [ 001]-direction , indicating that the spin fluctuation is strongly localized in this direction .",
    "it also has a small peak on the @xmath71 line showing the presence of small fluctuation toward a collinear magnetic order , as was pointed out in the study of the heisenberg model.@xcite however this mode competes with the other modes which exist in @xmath72 , @xmath73 , @xmath74 , @xmath75 , and thus such a magnetic order is suppressed .    in fig.4(b ) , we show the calculated result of the neutron cross section , @xmath76 , in the [ 110]-[001 ] plane . here",
    "@xmath77 is a reciprocal lattice vector .",
    "the positions of the maximum are almost consistent with the neutron scattering experiment for @xmath59.@xcite note that this structure is very similar to that found for the heisenberg model.@xcite thus the itineracy of electron affect little the structure in the momentum space , though the dynamical properties between the mott insulating state and the metallic state are quite different ; namely , the former is gapful and the latter is gapless .",
    "the momentum dependence of @xmath69 implies that the spin fluctuation is localized in a tetrahedron forming collective 4-spin singlet.@xcite such a localized character of spin fluctuation is very similar to magnetic properties of @xmath61-electron based heavy fermion systems .",
    "however , in the latter systems , magnetic long - range order is suppressed by the presence of kondo temperature higher than magnetic ordering temperature . in our system ,",
    "the geometrical frustration is crucial .",
    "here we discuss the charge response of the heavy - fermion state near the half - filling . in general ,",
    "the charge susceptibility @xmath78 in the vicinity of the mott metal - insulator transition point shows quite different behaviors depending on the density of states near the fermi level.@xcite in our systems , the bare density of states in the hole - doped case is non - singular , though four - point vertices are much enhanced by electron correlation .",
    "the perturbative calculation of the charge susceptibility gives singular terms in the limit of @xmath79 , namely , @xmath80 .",
    "thus it is highly non - trivial how the charge susceptibility behaves , as the electron filling approaches the half - filling value . to see this",
    "we resum the most singular terms of the perturbative expansion in @xmath34 .",
    "as was done before , we neglect the momentum dependence of @xmath81 .",
    "we first consider the terms which contain only one irreducible four - point vertex .",
    "the most singular terms of this type are diagrammatically expressed as fig.5(a ) these terms are calculated as , @xmath82 here @xmath83,@xmath84 , and @xmath85 are positive constants . on the other hand , the term which contains @xmath86 irreducible four - point vertices shown in fig.5(b ) gives the contribution @xmath87^n/\\vert\\mu\\vert^{\\frac{n-1}{2}}$ ] with @xmath46 a positive constant .",
    "summing up all most singular terms , we have , @xmath88 thus as the electron filling approaches the half - filling value @xmath79 , the charge susceptibility decreases toward zero , @xmath89 , indicating that the system becomes incompressible .",
    "diagrams of the charge susceptibility .",
    "@xmath90 is the irreducible 4-point vertex .",
    "in this paper , we investigate the mott transition , strong correlation effects and spin dynamics of the pyrochlore hubbard model .",
    "we show that , at the half - filling , electron - electron interaction leads the system into the mott insulator in which the quantum disordered spin liquid state realizes . in the hole - doped case ,",
    "we show that the effective mass is anomalously enhanced in the vicinity of the half - filling signifying the heavy fermion state .",
    "we have also calculated the neutron cross sectin of this state which is consistent with the recent experiment for some itinerant pyrochlore systems like @xmath59 .",
    "although we carried out the perturbative calculation up to the fourth order in @xmath34 , the singular divergent behavior of the self - energy shown in sec .",
    "iii implies that we need to resum all order singular diagrams . since the most singular diagrams have the specific structure as discussed in sec .",
