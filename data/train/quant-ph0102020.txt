    "let us consider the following _ pattern matching _ problem .",
    "we have at our disposal a database of recorded persons pictures , organized into different classes according to certain defined features .",
    "now we are given a further person s picture and we want to determine to which class the person belongs .",
    "we scan the database by comparing the defined features of the given sample with those of the classes .",
    "if the patterns of the sample have a good enough matching with those of a certain class , then we can say that the person is _ recognized _ , that is , that the person belongs to that pattern class .",
    "we would like to consider a similar problem in the quantum mechanical context .",
    "there are various kinds of approaches to this problem @xcite . given a pattern we wish to classify it relative to a predefined set of pattern classes in such a way that we maximize some suitable measure of matching .",
    "this could be formulated , e.g. , in terms of vector representations , that is , a given image is discretized on a mesh and the contents in each pixel are approximated by the value of some predetermined intensity levels , say @xmath3 for the @xmath4-th pixel of a two dimensional mesh .",
    "thus a pattern is represented by a vector @xmath5 .",
    "when an input sample @xmath6 is given , an intrinsic feature is first extracted from it by removing noise and adjusting its size .",
    "the resulting data , say @xmath7 , called the _ feature vector _ , should be less noisy , less redundant and more invariant under commonly encountered variations and distortions .",
    "we want then to classify this @xmath7 into a pattern class from a set of classes @xmath8 , where each class @xmath0 contains some similar patterns .",
    "classification is usually made by evaluating a _ discriminant function _ @xmath9 associated with the pattern class @xmath0 , and is such that if the input sample is actually in the class @xmath10 , the value @xmath11 must be the largest .",
    "one way to make the problem more tractable is to represent each class @xmath0 by a typical pattern called a _ template vector _ @xmath12 and to deal only with this vector as the representative of the class @xmath0 .",
    "this is the template matching problem .",
    "now consider a similar problem in the quantum mechanical context .",
    "we are given a feature state @xmath13 , which is usually unknown , and a set of classes @xmath14 and their associated template states @xmath15 , known _",
    "a priori_. the problem of _ quantum template matching _ is to classify the state @xmath13 according to the set @xmath16 , that is , to pick up the template which best matches with @xmath13 .",
    "this is similar in some respects to quantum state discrimination and quantum state estimation . in quantum state discrimination ,",
    "a discrete set of states @xmath17 and their _ a priori _ probabilities @xmath18 are given .",
    "the task is to decide which state is received . in quantum state estimation ,",
    "one is to reconstruct a given unknown state @xmath19 by estimating certain parameters . in both scenarios ,",
    "one usually minimizes a certain bayes cost such as a decision or estimation error by using prior knowledge about the states . in quantum template matching , although we deal with an unknown input state generally specified by continuous parameters , the purpose is not to estimate the input state or to discriminate among the input states themselves , but to assign the best matched template state from amongst given candidates . in this sense quantum template",
    "matching involves aspects of both state estimation and discrimination : the unknown input states are generally parameterized by continuous parameters which we wish to characterize only up to some approximation given by the `` closest '' template state . indeed direct state estimation or discrimination",
    "would provide a strategy for template matching ( by comparing the classical information of the estimated state with the classical information of the template identities ) but this is generally not optimal  we should attempt to best match a template without necessarily obtaining any further more detailed information about the identity of the input state itself .    in this paper we will set up a precise formulation of this problem ( in section [ bayesian ] ) in terms of a suitable intuitive matching criterion .",
    "the template matching problem will then appear as a problem of determining the optimal strategy for an associated quantum bayesian inference problem @xcite .",
    "we will then consider some examples of template matching for qubit systems ( in sections [ binary_temp_match ] and [ multiple_temp_match ] ) in particular , considering the effect of allowing a finite number of identical copies of the input state @xmath13 ( of course in a classical context this makes no difference ) .",
    "we will compare the optimal strategy ( allowing full use of entanglement across the space of all copies ) with two semiclassical strategies : + ( a ) applying only separate measurements on each copy and processing the outcomes to decide the best matching ; + ( b ) applying the optimal state estimation strategy @xcite ( using a collective measurement on the product state of all copies ) and then classically comparing the identity of the reconstructed state with that of the template states .",
    "+ we will see that the optimal ( fully entangled ) strategy is more efficient than either of these . finally in section",
    "[ concluding ] we will summarize our results and describe some interesting further possible generalizations of the concept of quantum template matching .",
    "the bayesian formulation is based on an _ a priori _ knowledge about the inputs : the input feature state @xmath2 is unknown but it is assumed that we know the _ a priori _ probability distribution @xmath20 for possible inputs .",
    "each template state @xmath1 representing the class @xmath0 is assumed to be completely known . in order to classify @xmath2 into a class @xmath21",
    ", we need to introduce a _ score _",
    "@xmath22 which provides a matching criterion .",
    "one reasonable choice for the score in template matching is that derived from the similarity criterion    @xmath23    which is just the fidelity between the input state @xmath2 and the template state @xmath1 .",
    "if the template states are pure states @xmath24 then this is just the standard overlap @xmath25 . under the similarity criterion ,",
    "we are to choose the template for which the state overlap with @xmath26 is largest . the matching strategy",
    "is represented by a probability operator measure ( pom ) @xmath27 : @xmath28 this should be designed by using the _ a priori _ knowledge on the input and the template states , and the conditional scores @xmath29 .",
    "the performance of a matching strategy is measured by the _",
    "average score _ defined as @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the conditional probability that we have the @xmath10-th outcome given the state @xmath2 .",
    "the best strategy is the one that maximizes this average score .",
    "if we introduce the score operators @xmath32 then eq .",
    "( [ def_average_score ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath33    thus the problem is to find the optimal pom @xmath27 that maximizes @xmath34 given the set of score operators @xmath35 .",
    "this is a standard quantum bayesian optimization problem and necessary and sufficient conditions for optimality are well known @xcite : @xmath36 note that since @xmath29 is always non - negative , we have @xmath37 as operators .",
    "hence our optimal template matching problem ( of optimizing eq .",
    "( [ average_cost_wj ] ) ) reduces to a standard quantum state discrimination problem  of distinguishing the mixed states @xmath38 ( the normalized score operators ) taken with prior probabilities @xmath39 . in general",
    "the optimal strategy is unknown but we will consider examples exhibiting symmetry in which optimal strategies can be given .",
    "we begin with the simplest case of quantum template matching in which there are only two classes , and each class is described by a template state which is a known pure qubit state . furthermore the input states @xmath13 will be restricted to depend on only a single real feature parameter . by taking an appropriate qubit basis @xmath40 , the binary template states can be represented in terms of real components    @xmath41    [ templates ]    with a single real parameter @xmath42 specifying the nonorthogonality between the templates . as for the input state @xmath13",
    ", we will assume that its input distribution is the uniform probability density over the great circle on the bloch sphere defined by the two template states .",
    "thus we can write @xmath43 where the _ a priori _ density of @xmath44 is uniform , @xmath45 .",
    "we are now to decide which template is closest to the given @xmath46 in the sense of the highest state overlap .",
    "we suppose further that we are given @xmath47 identical copies of the input feature state @xmath48 and the average score can be written as @xmath49 where @xmath50 .",
    "note that our score @xmath51 , the overlap for a single copy ( i.e. we are establishing a relation between the input pattern @xmath52 and the templates @xmath24 ) but our pom @xmath53 operates on the full space of @xmath47 copies .",
    "the full input system is described on the @xmath54 dimensional _ totally symmetric bosonic subspace _ of @xmath55 , @xmath56 @xcite , as @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the occupation number basis of the @xmath59-component .",
    "for example , in the case of @xmath60 , the basis state @xmath61 reads @xmath62 our score operators are then given by @xmath63 where each @xmath64 has support on the @xmath54-dimensional subspace @xmath56 and eq .",
    "( [ average_cost_n ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath65 without loss of generality the matching strategy @xmath66 is constructed on @xmath56 . in the occupation number basis representation ( using eqs .",

    "now we consider the optimal strategy that satisfies the conditions of eq .",

    "the analysis is rather straightforward , as we are to maximize the following quantity @xmath72},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the resolution of the identity @xmath73 was used in the second equality . since @xmath74 , @xmath75 should be taken to maximize @xmath76}$ ] , that is , it should be the projection onto the subspace corresponding to the positive eigenvalues of the operator @xmath77 .",
    "( [ wj_even ] ) and ( [ wj_odd ] ) we have that @xmath78 when @xmath68 is even , and @xmath79 otherwise .",
    "although we have not succeeded in deriving an explicit analytic expression for the eigenvalues @xmath80 of @xmath81 , we introduce the diagonalizing operator @xmath82 such that @xmath83 where @xmath84 .",
    "since @xmath85 is antisymmetric in the antidiagonal ( i.e. @xmath86 ) the eigenvalues match up in @xmath87 pairs : @xmath88 , @xmath89 , and so on ( and when n is even , @xmath90 ) .",
    "the optimal strategy can then be constructed from the pair of projection operators @xmath91 onto the subspaces of nonnegative and negative eigenvalues respectively , which can be written as :    @xmath92    [ pi_opt ]    where @xmath93 is the integer part of @xmath94 .",
    "the maximum average score can be finally written as @xmath95    the expressions ( [ pi_opt ] ) for the pom also provide an intuitively appealing interpretation of the matching strategy , which consists of two steps .",
    "the first step is the unitary operation @xmath82 which is applied to the @xmath47-product input state @xmath96 .",
    "the second step is the measurement of the transformed state @xmath97 by the pom @xmath98 .",
    "this corresponds to a separate measurement in the @xmath40 basis on each input copy space , followed by majority voting on the outcomes . in other words ,",
    "the transformation @xmath82 prepares the optimal entangled state for the final measurement , and @xmath99 ( @xmath100 ) provides the projection onto the @xmath101-majority ( the @xmath59-majority ) bosonic subspace .",
    "note that for the case of a single copy ( i.e. @xmath102 ) @xmath103 is diagonal in the @xmath40 basis so that @xmath104 and the measurement in this basis is the optimal strategy .",
    "in a semiclassical strategy where the separable measurement @xmath98 ( corresponding to the optimal measurement on each separate copy ) is directly applied without using the transformation @xmath82 , the attained average score becomes , instead @xmath105 @xmath106 and @xmath107 are compared numerically in fig .",
    "[ score - n_binary ] for the case of orthogonal templates ( @xmath108 ) .",
    "the effect of @xmath82 can be seen to reduce the required number of sample copies to attain a prescribed level of the average score ( the curve denoted by `` + '' corresponds to the strategy consisting of quantum state estimation and classical matching , which will be explained in the next subsection ) .",
    "let us illustrate the optimal matching strategy in the case where we use three sample copies .",

    "the input state @xmath96 is first transformed by @xmath82 , and is then processed interactively with two ancillary qubits via two controlled - not and two controlled - controlled - not gates .",
    "these steps implement @xmath98 as a measurement on a single qubit . by measuring the second ancillary qubit @xmath115 in the basis @xmath40",
    ", we can decide with the maximum average score that the best matched template is @xmath116 ( respectively @xmath117 ) when the output is @xmath118 ( respectively @xmath119 ) .      another possible kind of semiclassical strategy based on the optimal state estimation of a qubit is also considered in fig .",
    "[ score - n_binary ] .",
    "quantum state estimation deals with how to evaluate unknown parameters of a quantum state as precisely as possible .",
    "this idea can be naturally applied to template matching : one can first perform a quantum state estimation to estimate the input feature state , and then compare this reconstructed state with the templates _",
    "classically_. optimal state estimation of a qubit using @xmath47 identically prepared states has been recently studied in refs .",
    "in particular , discrete and finite element optimal poms were found @xcite , and they maximize the following score @xmath120 where @xmath121 is a reconstructed state after the state estimation .",
    "the assignment of a guessed state @xmath122 is now also to be optimized .",
    "this strategy was already described in ref .",
    "@xcite , but we rephrase it here in a slightly different and more practical way according to the results of ref .",
    "for convenience of calculation we introduce a new basis @xmath123 for which our great circle of feature states @xmath52 is the equator .",
    "we fix the basis vectors by requiring the templates to have the symmetrical form :    @xmath124    and the circle of feature states may be taken to be @xmath125 where again , the parameter @xmath44 is uniformly distributed over @xmath126 .",
    "let us also introduce @xmath127 states equally spaced on the bloch great circle ( which will define our pom ) : @xmath128 ; \\quad ( m=0 , 1 , ... , m-1 ) \\label{uniform_templates_varphi}\\ ] ] here we have introduced a phase factor @xmath129 which determines the position of these symmetrical states relative to the fixed positions of the template states .",
    "the corresponding @xmath47-fold tensor product states are : @xmath130 where @xmath131 is the symmetric bosonic basis for @xmath132 .",
    "it can then be shown that the _ square root measurement _",
    "@xmath133 based on the states @xmath134 , that is , @xmath135 and the associated guess @xmath136 , provides an optimal state estimation strategy when we take @xmath137 @xcite .",
    "thus , by applying the pom @xmath138 , the input feature state is optimally reconstructed as one of the @xmath139",
    ". then one can _ classically _ compare this reconstructed state with the templates and pick up the template state which has the largest overlap with the reconstructed state .",
    "the above strategy for state _ estimation _ is optimal for any choice of @xmath129 . indeed since our input state distribution is uniform , the score in eq .",
    "( [ score_n_phi ] ) will be independent of @xmath129 .",
    "but when we compare the reconstructed state with the templates , the resulting average score of template matching _ will _ depend on @xmath129 due to the fixed positions of the templates , i.e. different state estimation strategies which each give the same best possible score will generally give different scores for template matching via our classical method , and we should choose the best from our set of optimal estimation strategies . to complete our semi - classical template",

    "[ score - n_binary ] ( for @xmath153 ) .",
    "as it can be seen , the strategy using the optimal state estimation followed by classical matching can be close to optimal for the region of small @xmath47 , while as @xmath47 increases it starts to deviate from the optimal one and becomes closer to the strategy of separable measurement plus majority voting .",
    "the three strategies are schematically summarized in figs .",
    "[ circuit_opt]@xmath154[circuit_ets ] . the quantum optimal strategy ( fig . [ circuit_opt ] )",
    "is realized by a collective measurement on the state @xmath155 with binary outputs .",
    "this is made by dividing the state space @xmath56 spanned by @xmath155 into 2 parts according to the templates , and by successfully using entanglement effects in @xmath56 .",
    "on the other hand , the separable measurement plus majority voting scheme shown in fig .",
    "[ circuit_mv ] does not take any advantage of the entanglement which could be drawn from the state @xmath155 . in the optimal state estimation plus",
    "classical matching strategy shown in fig .",
    "[ circuit_ets ] , the collective measurement first performed for estimating @xmath156 also utilizes an entanglement effect .",
    "however , this is not the best way for _ binary classification_. in fact , the optimal state estimation requires dividing the space @xmath56 into at least @xmath54 parts .",
    "as @xmath47 increases , one has to rely much more on the classical procedure to categorize the outputs into two classes .",
    "this is the reason why this strategy becomes ineffective for larger @xmath47 .",
    "intuitively any intermediate measurement prior to the final decision tends to degrade the total performance leading to a waste of input copies for a given average score level , so the process for the best binary classification should stay entirely in the quantum domain until the very final measurement .",
    "in the previous section we have assumed a single feature parameter @xmath44 and a minimum number ( two ) of templates . in this section",
    "we extend our model to allow for multiple template matching .",
    "although binary template matching can be reduced to the diagonalization of the operator @xmath77 , there is no such straightforward method to find the optimal strategy in general cases . to keep the model tractable ,",
    "we assume that the input feature state is a general qubit state depending now on two parameters , @xmath157 with a uniform _ a priori _ distribution over the whole bloch sphere .",
    "furthermore we suppose that only one of the parameters relates to the desired feature of @xmath13 , for example , the angle parameter @xmath44 around the @xmath158 axis , while the @xmath158 component itself is of no interest .",
    "the template states corresponding to this feature are assumed to be @xmath127 states uniformly distributed around the great circle in the @xmath159 plane of the bloch sphere , that is , @xmath160 as before we have @xmath47 copies of the input state as @xmath161 and generate the score operators based on this and the templates as    @xmath162   , \\label{wm_general}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    we then seek the strategy to find the template which best matches with the given @xmath13 in such a way to maximize the average score @xmath163 as noted in section [ bayesian ] this optimal template problem is equivalent to the problem of optimal discrimination of the set of mixed states @xmath164 taken with equal _ a priori _ probabilities @xmath165 .",
    "the score operators evidently have the same symmetry as the templates , that is , @xmath166 where @xmath167 is a unitary representation of the group of integers modulo @xmath127 on the @xmath54 dimensional bosonic subspace of @xmath47 qubits .",
    "indeed it is just the product representation @xmath168 where @xmath169 is the operation of rotation of the one - qubit bloch sphere by @xmath170 about the @xmath171-axis .",

    "this suggests a possible avenue of generalization for the above theorem of @xcite which we will explore elsewhere .    in the other case @xmath214 , that is , when we can use a larger number of copies of the input than the number of templates , the optimal pom is more complicated .",

    "the optimal state estimation on @xmath240 followed by a classical matching process does not provide the best strategy , and there is a different optimal use of entanglement for this particular binary classification problem . in the case of multiple template matching , the problem becomes more difficult and we derived the optimal strategies in a few illustrative cases .    as mentioned in the introduction , the procedure of conventional pattern matching consists of feature extraction , calculation of the discriminant function and classification . in the quantum context , however , it is not clear how to model such processes without an associated loss of useful information .",
    "for instance , to eliminate features of no concern one might simply project the input state onto the subspace spanned by the relevant states with the features of interest .",
    "but we saw in section [ binary_temp_match ] that a quantum measurement , that is , a projection of states , carried out before the final template decision , is generally detrimental to optimal performance . in this spirit , we dealt with the problem in the original hilbert space without projecting the input states onto the subspace for the features of interest ( section [ multiple_temp_match ] ) , and the whole process of quantum template matching was represented by a single pom .",
    "it is of course an open question to formulate quantum protocols in more physically comprehensive ways , e.g. involving a separate non - trivial feature enhancement process prior to classification , and to systematically derive optimal strategies for them .    but even without such additional infrastructure ( e.g. feature enhancement ) our problem of template matching has some interesting generalizations related to the role of classical versus quantum information in the formulation . in our formulation",
    "we have assumed that the input states ( such as @xmath13 ) are given as quantum information ( i.e. unknown quantum states ) whereas the template states ( @xmath15 s with known identities ) are given as classical information .",
    "furthermore our goal was to obtain the best template as classical information ( i.e. knowledge of the identity of the best @xmath15 ) via a suitable pom .",
    "the ingredients of this formulation can be relaxed in a variety of potentially interesting ways and here we mention two such ways : + ( a ) instead of knowing the identities of the template states we may merely be given only some finite number ( @xmath241 ) of copies of each template ( so our original formulation is equivalent to @xmath242 ) .",
    "one matching strategy would then be to apply state estimation to the sets of @xmath241 copies and proceed as in our original formulation with the resulting estimated state identities .",
    "but this is unlikely to be optimal and we should consider a more fully quantum procedure which , for any input @xmath13 , identifies the best template class ( still here as classical information ) without attempting to obtain any further information about the identities of the template states themselves .",
    "+ ( b ) a second more intrinsically quantum mechanical formulation of template matching involves obtaining the answer ( i.e. the best matching template ) only as quantum information . in this scenario",
    "we have a known prior distribution of inputs @xmath243 and a known set of possible templates @xmath244 .",
    "then given one ( or more ) copies of @xmath245 we want to design a quantum process ( i.e. a completely positive trace preserving map acting on the input ) that outputs ( one copy of ) a quantum state @xmath246 of the form @xmath247 such that some suitable average score @xmath248 is maximized .",
    "note that the formulation in our paper ( of getting the best template as classical information ) would provide one possible strategy since we can then construct the corresponding template state as a quantum state , but again , this would not be expected to be optimal since we produce a great deal of unwanted extra information in addition to the desired quantum output state .",
    "there are yet further possible avenues for generalizing the formulation of the template matching problem .",
    "one is to study pattern classification with other kinds of matching criteria than fidelity , which would be chosen according to some specific application or purpose .",
    "for example , according to the quantum sanov theorem ( e.g. summarized in section iv of @xcite ) the quantum relative entropy @xmath249 between two quantum states provides an index for estimating the probability that the states will not be distinguished on the basis of an arbitrary measurement on @xmath47 copies of the state .",
    "thus the relative entropy provides an alternative , operationally intuitive , notion of `` distance '' between quantum states and we may consider maximizing the average relative entropy as our similarity criterion in template matching for some purposes .    the above remarks and generalizations show that the problem of template matching introduced in this paper is just the beginning of a fruitful area for further study .",
    "the formulation adopted in the paper is perhaps the simplest , in that it is closely related to an existing body of results on quantum bayesian estimation . but",
    "a study of possible hybrid quantum - classical generalizations along the lines suggested above would provide a natural setting for characterizing new properties , and a deeper understanding , of quantum information itself , and especially the ways it fails to accord with familiar properties of classical information .",
