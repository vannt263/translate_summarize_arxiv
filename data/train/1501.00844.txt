    "<S> a potential problem with this perspective is the thermal evolution observed in fese crystals , in which nematicity onsets at @xmath2190kelvin , but there is no magnetic ordering down to the lowest measured temperatures suggesting the possibility of a zero temperature nematic quantum pm phase [ fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 3(b ) ] . </S>",
    "<S> this fact coupled with the absence of any observed enhancement of the low frequency magnetic fluctuations at @xmath22@xcite has led many to concluded that the nematicity in fese is driven by orbital ordering .    </S>",
    "<S> certainly , it is clear that within a local moment picture the lack of magnetic order implies that the spin - spin interactions must be highly frustrated ; this is true regardless of what causes the nematic ordering . </S>",
    "<S> thus in the following we ask , `` can frustrated spin interactions alone drive a nematic quantum pm state ? ''    </S>",
    "<S> we consider models in which each fe@xmath20 possesses a localized spin 1 ( _ e.g .  _ </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath7 version of the model in equation  ( [ j1j2 ] ) ) </S>",
    "<S> . given the strength of hund s coupling and the crystal - field splittings , @xmath7 is a reasonable possibility for the spin of fe@xmath20 ions . </S>",
    "<S> however it is important to keep in mind that fese is not an insulator , and such localized models neglect the effects of itinerant carriers . </S>",
    "<S> we shall return to this point later .    , the discrete crystal rotation symmetry is spontaneously broken at the blue point and continuous spin rotation symmetry at the red . </S>",
    "<S> ( b ) a likely thermal phase diagram of fese . </S>",
    "<S> ( c ) the zero temperature phase diagram of the spin-1 @xmath23@xmath24 model in equation  ( [ j1j2 ] ) as a function of @xmath25 . ]    </S>",
    "<S> first we demonstrate the existence of a nematic quantum pm phase in an exactly solvable hamiltonian . </S>",
    "<S> consider a square lattice of @xmath7 spins interacting via the short - range , spin rotationally invariant hamiltonian @xmath26 where @xmath27 and @xmath28 sums over all elementary triangles of sites [ see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 2(c ) ] , and where @xmath29 and @xmath30 are nn bonds and @xmath31 is a next - nn bond . </S>",
    "<S> here @xmath32 is the projection operator onto @xmath33 . </S>",
    "<S> we note that because it involves spin-1 operators , equation  ( [ proj ] ) possesses a global spin so(3 ) [ rather than su(2 ) ] symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> in addition it possesses all crystalline symmetries of the square lattice ( _ i.e .  </S>",
    "<S> _ translation and point group symmetries ) . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , there are two degenerate ground states which can be constructed exactly as follows : any closed loop @xmath34 on the lattice can be thought of as a spin-1 chain . </S>",
    "<S> the famous aklt ( affleck - kennedy - lieb - tasaki ) state@xcite of such chains can be written as the matrix product state @xmath35|m_{i_1}, ... ,m_{i_n}{\\rangle } , $ ] where @xmath36 is the @xmath37 quantum number of the spin on site @xmath38 , and the matrices @xmath39 are @xmath40 with @xmath41 being the pauli matrices . </S>",
    "<S> we identify the two adjacent sites @xmath38 and @xmath42 in an aklt loop as an `` aklt - entangled pair '' , and graphically represent it by a blue bond connecting @xmath38 and @xmath42 in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 4 . </S>",
    "<S> the two ground - states of @xmath43 are constructed as the direct product of aklt loop states on all the loops made by connecting nearest - neighbor sites in the @xmath44 direction , @xmath45 , or in the @xmath46 direction , @xmath47 , where @xmath48 with @xmath49 labels the sites of a @xmath50 square lattice . </S>",
    "<S> the graphical representations of @xmath51 and @xmath52 are shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 4 . because the maximum total spin of an aklt - entangled pair is @xmath53@xcite </S>",
    "<S> , it follows that the maximum spin component of a triplet of spins @xmath54 containing at least one aklt - entangled pair is @xmath55 . from this </S>",
    "<S> it follows trivially that @xmath43 annihilates @xmath51 and @xmath52 ; moreover , since @xmath43 is positive semidefinite , this proves that they are ground states .     from equation  ( [ proj ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> * the solid blue lines connect aklt - entangled pairs discussed in the main text . ]    </S>",
    "<S> it is only slightly more difficult to see that any other state constructed as a direct product of aklt - loop states has positive energy : since each site can be aklt entangled with at most two other sites , and since there are four elementary triangles per site , in any zero energy state exactly two of the sites must be aklt - entangled , and each entangled pair must form an edge of four distinct elementary triangles . </S>",
    "<S> the two states @xmath51 and @xmath52 are the only ones that satisfy this constraint . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , if the blue bonds in fig .  4 make a turn , an elementary triangle with its vertex at the corner of the turn will not contain any aklt - entangled pair . while we do not have a general proof that no more complex ground states exist , explicit finite cluster diagonalization ( up to system size @xmath56 ) suggest that there are none .    from the known properties of aklt states,@xcite it follows immediately that @xmath51 and @xmath57 are gapped pm states with exponentially falling spin - spin correlations which break crystal rotation symmetry : @xmath58 with @xmath59 and @xmath60 in units in which the lattice constant is 1 . </S>",
    "<S> the gap implies that the nematic pm phase is perturbatively stable . </S>",
    "<S> however , the asymptotic form of @xmath61 is non - generic  this reflects the fact that @xmath43 lies on a `` disorder line@xcite '' where , although there is no associated thermodynamic non - analyticity , the oscillatory character of the short - range order changes .    turning to less `` reverse engineered '' models </S>",
    "<S> , we discuss the very interesting numerical ( density matrix renormalization group ) study by jiang _ </S>",
    "<S> et al .  _ </S>",
    "<S> @xcite of the spin-1 version of the @xmath0 model in equation  ( [ j1j2 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> they found that as a function of @xmath25 there is an intermediate paramagnetic phase ( characterized by gapped @xmath7 excitations ) between the nel and stripe ordered phases [ see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 3(c ) ] . </S>",
    "<S> moreover the nel and stripe order parameters vanish continuously as @xmath25 approaches the respective critical values from the magnetically ordered side ( see fig .  4 of ref .  ) . in the supplementary information we perform exact diagonalization on small lattices and </S>",
    "<S> demonstrate the adiabatic connectivity of the ground - state phases of @xmath43 ( equation  ( [ proj ] ) ) and the @xmath0 model when @xmath25 falls within the pm regime . </S>",
    "<S> in addition we compare the excitations in different spin and momentum sectors .    to obtain an analytic understanding of the nematic quantum pm phase , we consider a field theory description valid in the neighborhood of a continuous or weakly first order quantum phase transition from the nel phase to a nematic pm phase . because the unbroken symmetries of the nel and nematic pm phases do not have a subgroup relationship , classical landau theory </S>",
    "<S> would imply that such a continuous phase transition is forbidden . </S>",
    "<S> however as pointed out in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> , when the topological defects of one order carry the quantum number of the other order a continuous transition becomes possible .    according to ref .  </S>",
    "<S> , in the path integral describing the quantum fluctuations of the @xmath7 nel antiferromagnet in 2d , the weight associated with each field configuration is determined by the usual non - linear sigma model ( analogous to the first term in equation  ( [ nlsm ] ) ) , but there is also an additional berry s phase factor . for a `` charge '' @xmath15 monopole ( which causes the skyrmion number to jump by @xmath15 ) centered on plaquette @xmath62 ( which designates a point on the dual lattice ) this phase factor ( up to a global `` gauge '' ambiguity ) </S>",
    "<S> is @xmath63 . </S>",
    "<S> [ see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 1(c ) ] . </S>",
    "<S> rotation by 90@xmath64 about a lattice site transforms @xmath65 but keeps @xmath15 invariant . </S>",
    "<S> so long as this symmetry is preserved , the feynman amplitude of any field configuration with an odd @xmath15 cancels that associated with the configuration rotated by 90@xmath64 . as a result </S>",
    "<S> odd @xmath15 monopoles can not proliferate , although even @xmath15 monopoles can . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , states can be classified by a conserved skyrmion number parity @xmath66 . </S>",
    "<S> it turns out that the two - fold degeneracy associated with opposite skyrmion parity accounts for the two nematic ground states depicted in fig.4 . </S>",
    "<S> if we introduce a perturbation that breaks the crystal 90@xmath64 rotation symmetry , the absolute value of the feynman amplitudes associated with monopoles sitting at the @xmath67 and @xmath13 locations in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 1(c ) do not need to be the same anymore , hence their feynman amplitudes no longer cancel which means the odd @xmath15 monopoles can proliferate rendering the pm state non - degenerate . </S>",
    "<S> this observation justifies identifying the two - fold degeneracy in the symmetric system with spontaneous breaking of 90@xmath64 rotation symmetry .    in the following discussions we will use euclidean space - time and denote the imaginary time as @xmath68 . </S>",
    "<S> consider a 4-component real vector field of unit norm , @xmath69 with @xmath70 , whose first three components , @xmath71 are the nel order parameter and @xmath72 is the ising - like nematic order parameter . for example , for a spin model on a square lattice , we can take @xmath73 . </S>",
    "<S> the non - linear sigma model action we shall consider is @xmath74 where @xmath75 . this field theory has been introduced in ref .   and ref .   which discuss the effects of topological terms on the spectrum and phases of non - linear sigma models . </S>",
    "<S> for our purposes a derivation of equation  ( [ nlsm ] ) is given in the supplementary information . </S>",
    "<S> note that this particular topological term is possible only in spatial dimension @xmath76 with a @xmath77 component order parameter . </S>",
    "<S> here @xmath78 is an anisotropy term that favors the first three components of @xmath79 , ( for example @xmath80 ^ 2 $ ] ) , hence equation  ( [ nlsm ] ) has @xmath81 symmetry . consider a monopole configuration centered on the origin , @xmath82 . </S>",
    "<S> because of the anisotropy term , @xmath79 on a two - sphere ( @xmath11 ) in space - time far away from the center of the monopole is largely constrained to lie in the space spanned by the first three components of @xmath79 , _ i.e.  _ @xmath83 . </S>",
    "<S> topologically the configurations of @xmath17 on the two - sphere are classified by the skyrmion number which , in this case , is equal to the monopole charge @xmath15 . </S>",
    "<S> however such far field configuration can be compatible with two different @xmath72 orientations in the monopole core . consider the following configurations which reduce to the same @xmath84 configuration in @xmath17 far from monopole the center @xmath85 where @xmath86 , @xmath87 , and @xmath88 . here </S>",
    "<S> @xmath89 is the size of the `` monopole core '' . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath90 both describe @xmath84 monopoles but with @xmath91 in the monopole core . </S>",
    "<S> it is straightforward to show that @xmath92 for these two types of monopole . </S>",
    "<S> a similar discussion holds for the @xmath93 monopole . </S>",
    "<S> it is easy to generalize the above argument to @xmath94 monopoles and obtain the corresponding phase factors @xmath95 . </S>",
    "<S> a consequence of the @xmath96 ( nematic ) symmetry is that the feynman amplitudes of the two monopoles described above have the same absolute values .    </S>",
    "<S> these monopoles represent events ( as a function of imaginary time ) at which the skyrmion number changes . </S>",
    "<S> we can thus think of the quantum disordered phase as an interacting fluid of skyrmions and anti - skyrmions . </S>",
    "<S> because of the destructive interference between the two types of @xmath84 monopoles discussed above , events in which the skyrmion number changes by one are forbidden  the net skyrmion number is thus conserved modulo 2 and the hilbert space breaks into an even and an odd sector . since the stiffness constant @xmath97 renormalizes to zero in the quantum disordered state and since there is a non - zero ( possibly small ) density of skyrmions and anti - skyrmions , the ground - state energy in these two sectors should be equal in the thermodynamic limit . </S>",
    "<S> this is the ground - state degeneracy associated with the breaking of c@xmath98 symmetry to c@xmath99 . in the supplementary information we discuss the effects of an explicit c@xmath98 @xmath100 c@xmath99 symmetry breaking field .    </S>",
    "<S> one can also arrive at the pm phase in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 3(c ) from the stripe ordered side by proliferating the monopole of the stripe order parameter . </S>",
    "<S> generalizing the calculation of ref .   </S>",
    "<S> we find the berry s phase factor associated with the stripe monopole is trivial . </S>",
    "<S> consequently the charge @xmath101 monopole can proliferate rendering the resulting quantum disordered state non - degenerate . here </S>",
    "<S> , because the symmetries of the two phases have subgroup relationship , a continuous transition is allowed in the landau theory . </S>",
    "<S> we expect such transition to be in the @xmath102 universality class .    </S>",
    "<S> our key theoretical conclusion is that for a spin-1 model on a square lattice , any `` intermediate '' quantum disordered phase between the nel and stripe ordered magnetic phases is likely to be a nematic pm . </S>",
    "<S> this is consistent with the numerical evidence for the @xmath0 model [ equation  ( [ j1j2 ] ) ] . because the nematic quantum pm phase straddles closely between the neel and nematic phases , we expect it to have low - lying spin excitations near both momenta @xmath103 and @xmath104 . the nematic order considered here might be thought of as `` vestigial '' order@xcite left behind when quantum fluctuations have restored spin - rotational symmetry .    before speculating on the relevance of these results to the interesting case of fese , </S>",
    "<S> it is necessary to comment on the effects of itinerant carriers . </S>",
    "<S> arpes and stm experiments show very small electron and hole pockets for fese@xcite and at the same time quantum oscillation associated with these tiny pockets are seen@xcite . because the latter experiment has very stringent requirement on the long life time of the quasiparticles </S>",
    "<S> we take it as an indication that the coupling between the itinerant carriers and the local moments is weak . </S>",
    "<S> this phase with decoupled magnetic and itinerant carrier degrees of freedom is analogous to the antiferromagnetic metal phase in heavy fermion systems . </S>",
    "<S> however due to the itinerant carriers the nematic phase can no longer be characterized as having a spin - gap , and close enough to criticality , the universality class of the quantum critical point is likely to be altered . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , fese is at best `` quasi-2d , '' which is to say that it is ultimately three dimensional , and this , too , will alter the nature of the phase transitions , but not necessarily affect the sequence of ordered phases .    </S>",
    "<S> since the iron - based superconductors involve multiple @xmath105 orbitals it has been long suspected that orbital ordering is the cause of nematicity . </S>",
    "<S> althoug we focus on the nematicity caused by frustrated magnetism , we do not intend to imply that orbital degrees of freedom play no role at all . </S>",
    "<S> as is well known regardless of the driving mechanism the nematic order parameter induces orbital splitting and lattice distortion . therefore cooperative effect involving many different degrees of freedom </S>",
    "<S> can well be necessary to describe the system behavior quantitatively.in addition the so far ignored spin orbit coupling is ultimately necessary for the nematicity in the magnetic degrees of freedom to induce the band splitting observed by arpes and anisotropic magnetic susceptibility observed by nmr .. etc .    with these caveats , </S>",
    "<S> the present results suggest that it may be possible to view the nematic phase in the fese as being driven primarily by frustrated magnetism . </S>",
    "<S> the fact that the underlying nematic quantum pm is gapped implies that there need not be any enhancement of the low energy magnetic fluctuations associated with the proximity of stripe long range order of the sort that has been detected by nmr in other fe - based materials . </S>",
    "<S> recent neutron scattering experiments@xcite show relatively short - range magnetic correlations but with reasonably large intensity ( _ i.e .  </S>",
    "<S> _ with substantial magnitudes of the fluctuating moments ) at the stripe ordering wavevector at low energies . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , the lack of any strong evidence of slow magnetic fluctuations in nmr@xcite and the short - range of the magnetic correlations seen in neutron scattering appear to be entirely consistent with a magnetic origin of nematicity . </S>",
    "<S> as discussed previously we expect the nematic pm phase to also exhibit relatively low energy spin excitations at the neel ordering wavevector . </S>",
    "<S> the nematic quantum pm state consists of a stacking of spontaneously formed spin-1 af chains . </S>",
    "<S> it can be viewed as a `` weak '' symmetry protected topological state . </S>",
    "<S> a potentially testable consequence of this observation is that gapless spin 1/2 excitations can arise on certain surfaces and domain boundaries . </S>",
    "<S> in addition we expect nonmagnetic impurities to cut the chain and induce low lying spin excitations in the pm gap . </S>",
    "<S> this can be detected by electron spin resonance in a manner analogous to that done for spin-1 chains@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> further experimental studies of nematic order and fluctuations in these materials  including elasto - resistance , nuclear quadrupole resonance , and raman scattering studies  as well more complete neutron scattering studies of the magnetic fluctuations would clearly be helpful .    </S>",
    "<S> finally after the submission of our paper , related theoretical studies appeared@xcite including one based on an itinerant electron picture of the nematicity in fese@xcite .    </S>",
