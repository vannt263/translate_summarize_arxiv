    "the history of carbon - based electronics begins with the discovery of fullerenes and carbon nanotubes that are zero- and one - dimensional , respectively.@xcite a very important recent development was the preparation of single monolayers of graphite , now more commonly called graphene , on insulating substrates using micromechanical cleavage @xcite that has made possible electron transport experiments on this purely two - dimensional system .",

    "@xcite the theoretical studies explain these spectacular effects in terms of graphene s unique electronic structure .",
    "although a single graphene sheet is a zero - gap semiconductor with a vanishing density of states at the fermi energy , it shows metallic behavior due to topological singularities at the @xmath5-points in the brillouin zone,@xcite where the conduction and valence bands touch in so - called conical or dirac points and the dispersion is essentially linear within @xmath6 ev of the fermi energy .",
    "its high charge carrier mobility and peculiar electronic properties have stimulated considerable research into the possibilities of using graphene for electronic and spintronic applications .",
    "graphene is often treated theoretically as a free - standing two - dimensional sheet . though this often appears to be a reasonable model for describing observed properties , in many experimental situations",
    "there is some deviation from this ideal because there is some form of physical contact with the environment .",
    "this can consist of atomic and molecular impurities in or on the graphene sheet , contact with an insulating substrate , a gate electrode or metallic leads , etc .",
    "@xcite while the fermi energy of free - standing graphene coincides with the conical points , adsorption on substrates can alter its electronic properties significantly.@xcite for example , the weak interaction of graphene adsorbed on the ( 0001 ) surface of insulating hexagonal boron nitride ( h - bn ) is enough to destroy graphene s characteristic conical points and open a band gap of some 50 mev.@xcite even when the interaction is sufficiently weak to leave the conical points essentially unchanged , it can lead to a large shift of the fermi energy away from the conical points.@xcite        since measurement of the electronic transport properties of graphene requires making contacts with metal leads , @xcite it is important to understand such electronic and structural properties as the charge transfer between graphene and the metal substrate , the graphene - metal binding energies , distances etc .",

    "there have been numerous theoretical and experimental studies on semiconducting carbon nanotubes contacted to metals such as al , au , pt , pd , ca and ti.@xcite since a graphene sheet can be considered as a carbon nanotube of infinite radius , the chemical interaction between graphene and metal substrates can be expected to be similar to that between metal contacts and nanotubes .    in this paper",

    "the ( 111 ) surfaces of al , co , ni , cu , pd , ag , pt , au and the ti(0001 ) surface cover a wide range of work functions and different types of chemical bonding , which allows for a systematic study of the metal - graphene interface .",
    "we focus on the interaction and charge transfer between graphene and the metal substrate , and in particular the effects they have on the doping of graphene by the metal .",
    "because the charge redistribution at the graphene - metal interface can be characterized experimentally by measuring the work function of the graphene - covered metal , we also calculate the work functions of these systems .",
    "the structural details of the metal - graphene interfaces will be presented elsewhere.@xcite the most important result for the purposes of this study is that there are two classes of graphene - metal interfaces . whereas graphene is chemisorbed on co , ni , pd and ti ,",

    "this model also predicts how physisorption of graphene modifies the metal work function .    in order to characterize the doping of chemisorbed graphene a different approach",

    "doping can not be simply deduced from the shift of the fermi level with respect to the conical points .",
    "instead , we consider the work function of the graphene - covered metal , which is always a well - defined quantity . in a current - in - plane transport experiment",
    "only part of the graphene sheet covers ( or is covered by ) the metal electrode , whereas an adjacent part is free - standing .",

    "co and pd(111 ) the work function lowering is 1.81 , 1.66 , and 1.64 ev , respectively , and for ti(0001 ) it is 0.56 ev .    despite the impossibility of identifying a fermi level shift and therefore the type and magnitude of the doping from a simple examination of the band structures in chemisorbed graphene , it is possible to define a suitable measure for application to current - in - plane ( cip ) geometries . in a cip geometry only part of the graphene sheet",
    "is covered by metal electrodes , and the greater part of the sheet is `` free - standing '' .",
    "the type and effective concentration of charge carriers in graphene contacted to metallic leads can be measured in experiments using the cip geometry shown schematically in fig .

    "chemisorption of graphene on these surfaces lowers their work function to below that of free standing graphene .",
    "therefore , we expect graphene to be @xmath1-doped by these metal electrodes .      the calculations on the interaction between graphene and the metal substrates we have discussed so far , are at the level of dft / l(s)da .",
    "the results given in table  [ ref : tab1 ] show that calculated work functions of clean metal surfaces agree with experimental data within @xmath117 ev .",
    "a similar agreement is observed between calculated work functions of graphene - covered metal surfaces and available experimental data . the change in work function upon graphene adsorption",
    "is determined by the formation of an interface dipole and the charge transfer between metal and graphene .",
    "apparently this charge redistribution at the interface is described rather well by the lda functional .",
    "_ semi - local gga functionals _ are frequently preferred in dft calculations . for graphene that is physisorbed on a metal surface",
    "the commonly used gga functionals give an interaction that is either too weak or even purely repulsive making it impossible to predict the equilibrium distance between graphene and the metal surface . in order to test whether the fermi level shift in adsorbed graphene and its work function are sensitive to the particular choice of the density functional ,",
    "we have calculated these parameters for graphene on cu(111 ) as a function of the graphene - metal surface distance , using the pw91 gga functional.@xcite the results are shown in fig .  [",
    "ref : fig7 ] .",
    "the fermi level shifts @xmath75 calculated with gga are within @xmath118 ev of the ones obtained with lda .",
    "the same holds for the work function difference @xmath119 , which means that the description of the doping of graphene is not sensitive to the functional used in the calculations .",
    "however , the absolute values of @xmath24 and @xmath31 calculated using the gga differ from those obtained using the lda by @xmath120 ev , which is a typical difference between work functions obtained with these two density functionals.@xcite     and @xmath121 as a function of the graphene - cu(111 ) surface distance @xmath4 calculated with the pw91 gga functional .",
    "the dash - dotted lines represent the results obtained with the lda functional with graphene stretched to the cu(111 ) lattice constant @xmath122 . as a reference ,",
    "the solid lines give the lda results obtained with the optimized graphene lattice constant @xmath123 . ]",
    "another issue is the possible effect of a truly _ non - local van der waals interaction _ between the graphene sheet and metal surface , which is neglected in our study .",
    "van der waals interactions have been addressed recently in calculations on graphite , hexagonal boron - nitride and diatomic molecules of inert gases.@xcite a non - local correction to a gga - type density functional has been proposed in ref .   that correctly reproduces the asymptotic van der waals tail of the binding energy curve at large intermolecular distances .",
    "this non - local correction has little impact on the charge distribution , however.@xcite since it is the charge distribution that gives the fermi level shift , the work function and the doping of adsorbed graphene , we conclude that these quantities are adequately described by local or semi - local functionals .    in our calculations",
    "we choose the in - plane lattice constant of graphene equal to its optimized lda value @xmath8  , and adapt the lattice constants of the metals accordingly .",
    "the approximation made by this matching procedure seems reasonable , since the mismatch with the lattice parameters of the metal ( 111 ) surfaces is only 0.8 - 3.8% , see table  [ ref : tab1 ] .",
    "the _ largest lattice mismatch _ is that between graphene and cu(111 ) . to estimate the error on the fermi level shift and the work function of adsorbed graphene , we have calculated these quantities while stretching graphene to the lda optimized in - plane lattice constant of cu(111 ) ( 2.49  ) .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ ref : fig7 ] .",
    "the fermi level shifts and work function differences are within 0.15 ev of the results obtained with the optimized graphene lattice constant .",
    "one expects to see a smaller effect for other metals , as the lattice mismatch between graphene and other metals is smaller .",
    "the theoretical study performed in the previous sections assumes that the graphene sheet is adsorbed on a clean crystalline metal contact .",
    "we have used the model represented by eq .",
    "( [ eqn1 ] ) to describe the fermi level shift in physisorbed graphene .",
    "interpreting experiments that are not carried out in ultra - high vacuum requires some modifications because of impurities that will be present at the metal - graphene interface.@xcite the work function of the clean metal surface must then be replaced with that of the metal surface contaminated by water molecules , oxygen and/or nitrogen , for instance .",
    "the short - range graphene - metal surface interaction , represented by the potential term @xmath99 , and the equilibrium separation @xmath18 will also be affected by such adsorbates and the effects will depend critically upon the adsorbate concentration .",
    "the same obviously holds for chemisorbed graphene .",
    "a large concentration of adsorbates on the metal surface could break the chemical interaction between graphene and the metal .    in some experiments",
    "the interface between the graphene sheet and metal surface might contain a thicker buffer layer consisting , for example , of water , or a metal - oxide.@xcite that would certainly modify the graphene - substrate interaction .",
    "an input parameter to the model of eq .",
    "( [ eqn1 ] ) then is the work function of the metal with the buffer layer on top . using the plane capacitor model one",
    "should replace @xmath124 in eq .",
    "( [ eqn1 ] ) by @xmath125 , where @xmath126 is the effective dielectric constant of the buffer layer .",
    "obviously the distance @xmath49 between the charge sheets has to be modified accordingly to take the thickness of the buffer layer into account .",
    "in addition the potential term @xmath99 , which represents the short - range interaction of graphene with the substrate should now reflect the graphene - buffer layer interaction .    a metallic buffer layer consisting of , for instance , ti is often used in experiments to establish a good contact between graphene and the electrodes .",
    "such layers have a thickness of typically @xmath127 nm , which is sufficiently thick that the contact should be considered as a graphene - ti contact .",
    "using first - principles dft calculations , we have systematically studied the interaction and charge transfer between graphene and a range of metal surfaces with different work functions .",
    "we found that graphene is chemisorbed on co , ni , and pd(111 ) surfaces , and on the ti(0001 ) surface and that this strong interaction perturbs the electronic structure of graphene significantly .",
    "in contrast , adsorption of graphene on al , cu , ag , au and pt(111 ) surfaces leads to weak bonding , which preserves the typical graphene electronic structure , including the conical points . even in this physisorbed case",
    ", however , there is a short - range graphene - metal interaction , as well as a charge transfer between the graphene and metal states .",
    "these result in a doping of graphene , i.e. , a shift of the fermi level with respect to the conical points , and a significant change in the work function of the graphene - covered metal surfaces , as compared to the clean metal surface .    to extend the applicability of the dft results on physisorbed graphene we develop a simple general model , which takes into account the charge transfer between the graphene and metal states and the short - range graphene - metal interaction .",
    "we find that the latter only weakly depends on the metal .",
    "therefore it can be fitted using the dft results on one metal substrate .",
    "the model then only has the work functions of free - standing graphene and that of the clean metal surface as input parameters and it predicts the fermi level shift and carrier concentration in graphene , as well as the work function of the graphene - covered metal substrate .",
    "we find that graphene is @xmath1-type doped if the metal work function @xmath128 ev , whereas it is @xmath0-type doped if @xmath129 ev .    for the cip geometry , where only part of the graphene sheet covers the metal electrode ,",
    "we propose a definition of the doping that is based upon the work function of graphene - covered metal surface .",
    "this definition is valid both for the chemisorbed and physisorbed cases .",
    "it predicts that adsorption of graphene on al , ag , cu , co , ni , pd(111 ) surfaces and on the ti(0001 ) surface leads to @xmath1-type doping .",
    "the high values of the work functions of au and pt(111 ) substrates lead to @xmath0-type doping of graphene .",
    "both the analytical model and the cip definition of the graphene doping are derived from general principles and should be applicable to any metal surface on which graphene can be epitaxially grown .",
    "this opens up the possibility of a general understanding of @xmath0-@xmath1 junctions prepared by doping graphene with metal contacts.@xcite    this work is part of the research programs of `` chemische wetenschappen ( cw ) '' and the `` stichting voor fundamenteel onderzoek der materie ( fom ) '' , both financially supported by the `` nederlandse organisatie voor wetenschappelijk onderzoek ( nwo ) '' , and of `` nanoned '' , a nanotechnology program of the dutch ministry of economic affairs .",
