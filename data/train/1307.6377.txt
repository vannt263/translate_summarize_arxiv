    "the simplest model for an inhomogeneous damped vibrating string is given by the equation @xmath0 complemented with an initial and boundary conditions at the end points .",
    "although quite simple , the explicit dependence of the damping on the space variable makes the problem genuinely non - selfadjoint and is responsible for several interesting properties which have received much attention in the literature within the last twenty years ",
    "see  @xcite and the references therein .",
    "one particular aspect which is of interest is the characterisation of the spectrum and , within that scope , the behaviour of the high frequencies . in the case of equation   with vanishing @xmath1 ,",
    "it was first suggested by the formal calculations in  @xcite that the real part of these high frequencies would cluster around minus the average of the damping term as the corresponding imaginary parts converge to infinity .",
    "this was proven rigorously in  @xcite where the first two terms in the asymptotic expansion of the eigenvalues were computed , while the complete asymptotic expansion was obtained in  @xcite for the first time .    in the case of more complex structures involving several segments which are joined at the endpoints",
    ", it makes sense to model each component by an equation of the form   with corresponding potentials and damping functions and have either a coupling at the common vertices or some boundary condition such as dirichlet at the isolated endpoints .",
    "indeed , there is a vast literature on the topic of waves on networks of strings as may be seen in the recent review  @xcite .",
    "however , most of this work revolves around the observability and controlability of such problems and , as far as we are aware , the damped case has not been considered in the literature . in particular",
    ", this means that in many cases the problem may still be reduced to the study of a self - adjoint ( vector ) operator .",
    "a different starting point which is also connected to the undamped case comes from the quantum graph literature where the resulting problem , although including the explicit dependence on the spatial variable via a potential playing a similar role to @xmath1 in equation   above , is still reduceable to a self  adjoint operator for a wide variety of coupling conditions ( see _ e.g. _ @xcite ) .",
    "the main object of study in the present paper is the wave equation on graphs with potential and damping functions depending explicitly on the space variable and with coupling conditions at the vertices .",
    "we are interested in understanding the asymptotic behaviour of the associated spectrum and , in particular , the counterpart for the case of graphs of the result on the spectral abscissa mentioned above for one segment .",
    "this is related to the rate of decay of high frequency modes on such structures and is therefore an important issue in applications .",
    "we remark that , as already noted in  @xcite , this behaviour depends in a subtle way on topological and number theoretic properties of the network , without it being possible to understand the global dynamics by simply studying each component in isolation from the rest .",
    "our main contribution here is to describe the possible asymptotic distributions of the high frequencies and show that , under certain conditions on the edge lengths and the coupling conditions , there exists at most a finite number of values around which the real parts of the eigenvalues may cluster , as the imaginary parts grow to infinity  see theorems  [ thm - onlyaverage ] and  [ alla ] , the results in section  [ sec - number ] and the examples in the last section . in particular , we show that under such conditions these _ high frequency spectral abscissas _ are the same as those obtained for the same graph where the damping terms are replaced by their averages on each edge .    while in the case of @xmath2 equilateral edges we show that the number of such abscissas is at most @xmath3 and that , if the graph is bipartite ( does not have loops of odd length ) , this number can not be larger than @xmath2",
    ", we also show that these results are sharp in the sense that for certain classes of graphs there exist damping terms yielding these maximal number of abscissas .",
    "if we drop the assumption that all edges have equal lengths and assume instead that they are comensurate , we give examples which indicate that the number of these abscissas may now be as large as desired .",
    "the damped wave equation on metric graphs may thus be viewed as a bridge in complexity between the scalar damped wave equation in one and two spatial dimensions .",
    "while in the former case there is only one high frequency spectral abscissa corresponding to the averaging of the damping on a segment , in the two dimensional case there are several different behaviours for the high frequencies corresponding to the different trajectories on the domain  @xcite . on a metric graph , these trajectories are restricted to the edges , with the damping being averaged along each edge and these averages then being combined via the topology of the graph .",
    "the paper is structured as follows . in the next section",
    "we describe the model and the corresponding notation .",
    "the third section presents some basic asymptotic properties of the secular equation and vertex scattering matrix for eigenvalues with high imaginary part .",
    "the number and location of high frequency abscissas are studied in sections  [ sec - number ] and  [ sec - loc ] .",
    "the method of pseudo orbit expansion ( section  [ sec - orbit ] ) is used for proving parts of theorem  [ thm - main ] which in particular states that for obtaining the location and number of spectral abscissas we may replace the damping and potential terms on each edge by their averages . in section  [ sec - examples ]",
    "several examples are provided illustrating the previous results .",
    "we consider a compact metric graph @xmath4 with @xmath5 finite edges @xmath6 of lengths @xmath7 . on each edge",
    "@xmath8 a linear damped wave equation of the form @xmath9 is considered , with both the damping functions @xmath10 and the potentials @xmath11 real and bounded .",
    "the above set of partial differential equations can be rewritten in a more elegant way @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the @xmath14 identity matrix , @xmath15 and @xmath16 are diagonal @xmath14 matrices with entries @xmath17 and @xmath18 , respectively , @xmath19 is the vector of functions @xmath20 and @xmath21 its time derivative .    the ansatz @xmath22 allows us to rewrite equation  ( [ eq - wetime ] ) as @xmath23 and therefore reformulate the time dependent problem as a spectral problem .",
    "more precisely , in this way we are led to the operator @xmath24 with domain consisting of functions @xmath25 with components of both @xmath26 and @xmath27 in @xmath28 for the corresponding edge and satisfying suitable coupling conditions at the vertices .",

    "it is straightforward to check that this is equivalent to @xmath49 , leading to the general coupling condition @xmath50 for any @xmath14 unitary matrix @xmath51 and where @xmath13 is the @xmath14 identity matrix .",
    "let us note that the more general choice @xmath52 instead of @xmath53 with any real @xmath54 is possible ; however , this leads to the condition @xmath55 and a simple transformation between @xmath56 and @xmath51 shows that this equation is , in fact , equivalent to  ( [ eq - coupling ] ) .",
    "the reverse implication that any pair of vectors @xmath57 and @xmath44 satisfying the coupling condition  ( [ eq - coupling ] ) , also satisfies  ( [ eq - coupling2 ] ) , follows from properties of unitary matrices .",
    "in agreement with the notation for quantum graphs we shall denote the coupling for which functional values are equal at each vertex and the sum of outward derivatives vanishes by _ standard coupling _ ( the terms kirchhoff s , neumann or free coupling may also be found in the literature ) .",
