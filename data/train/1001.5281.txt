    "non - axisymmetric deformations of rapidly rotating bodies are rather generic phenomena in nature and can appear in a wide class of systems .",
    "particularly interesting within an astrophysical context are those deformations taking place in fluids that are self - gravitating and the literature on this has a long history dating back to the work of  @xcite on incompressible newtonian uniformly rotating bodies . since then , the study of these instabilities has continued over the years both in newtonian gravity and in full general relativity .",
    "special attention has traditionally been paid to the study of @xmath3 instabilities , which are characterized by the exponential growth of @xmath3 deformations , where @xmath4 parametrizes the azimuthal dependence @xmath5 in a standard mode decomposition in spherical harmonics .",
    "most of the interest in this type of deformation in compact stars stems from the fact that it has the shortest growth time and leads to the emission of a strong gravitational - wave signal .",
    "the development of non - axisymmetric instabilities is commonly analyzed in terms of the quantity @xmath6 ( _ i.e. _  the ratio between the kinetic rotational energy @xmath7 and the gravitational potential energy @xmath8 ) , that provides a dimensionless measure of the amount of angular momentum that can be tapped to feed the development of the instabilities .",
    "this parameter plays an important role in what is possibly the most celebrated of the non - axisymmetric instabilities : the so - called _ dynamical _ bar - mode instability .",
    "this is an @xmath3 instability which takes place when the parameter @xmath1 is larger than a critical one , @xmath9 . in the case of a newtonian incompressible self - gravitating polytrope , for instance",
    ", the dynamical bar - mode instability develops for @xmath10  @xcite and is only weakly dependent on the considered polytropic index or whether the fluid is compressible .",
    "post - newtonian ( pn ) studies  @xcite or fully general - relativistic ones  @xcite correct this results only slightly , by reducing the threshold to somewhat lower values of the instability parameter . as an example , for a polytropic relativistic star with polytropic index @xmath11 , the accurate calculations reported in  @xcite reveal that the critical value is @xmath12 and that a simple dependence on the stellar compactness allows one to track this threshold from the newtonian limit over to the fully relativistic one  @xcite .",
    "the onset and development of the bar - mode instability has been traditionally studied by means of nonlinear 3d simulations of newtonian stars that are either unmagnetized  @xcite and , more recently , also magnetized  @xcite . in addition ,",
    "pn and fully relativistic simulations have been performed and highlighted , for instance , that the persistence of the bar is strongly dependent on the degree of overcriticality and is generically of the order of the dynamical timescale .",
    "furthermore , generic nonlinear mode - coupling effects between the @xmath13 and the @xmath3 mode appear during the development of the instability and these can severely limit the persistence of the bar deformation and eventually suppress the bar deformation  @xcite .",
    "these results have been recently confirmed by the perturbative calculations in  @xcite .    besides dynamical instabilities , which are purely hydrodynamical , _ secular _ instabilities are also possible in rotating compact stars and these are instead triggered by dissipative processes , such as viscosity or radiation emission . if , in particular , the dissipative mechanism is the emission of gravitational radiation , then the secular instability is also known as chandrasekhar - friedman - schutz or cfs instability  @xcite .",
    "contrary to what their name may suggest , secular instabilities do not necessarily develop on secular timescales ( although they normally do ) and are characterized by having a much smaller threshold for the instability . once again , in the case of a newtonian polytrope , the critical secular instability parameter is as small as @xmath14 and thus much more easy to attain in astrophysical circumstances .",
    "although widely observed in numerical simulations , the physical conditions leading to a dynamical bar - mode instability are difficult to be encountered in standard astrophysical scenarios .",
    "such large values of the instability parameter , in fact , can not be easily attained in old and cold neutron stars , which have been brought into uniform rotation and thus to rather small values of @xmath1 .",
    "however , more recently these pessimistic prospects have been changed when a new @xmath3 instability has been discovered in differentially rotating newtonian stars  @xcite for values of @xmath15 , therefore well below the expected values for a dynamical bar - mode instability .",
    "the most salient aspect of this new instability is that it appears in stars with a large degree of differential rotation and that it grows on a timescale which is longer but comparable with the dynamical one .",
    "this instability has been referred to as the `` low-@xmath2 instability '' and its dependence on the polytropic index and on the degree of differential rotation has been studied in  @xcite . since then , the instability has been observed or discussed in a number of related studies  @xcite , all of which have highlighted the possible occurrence of this type of instability during the collapse of a massive stellar core .    despite the abundant numerical evidence on the development of this instability ,",
    "the nature of these low-@xmath2 instabilities is still matter of debate and , most importantly , a sufficient criterion for its onset has not been derived yet .",
    "this instability has been studied in great detail by watts and collaborators  @xcite , who have made a number of phenomenological predictions either using a toy shell - model first introduced in  @xcite , or for a stellar model in newtonian gravity .",
    "overall , the work of watts and collaborators ( but see also  @xcite ) recognizes the low-@xmath2 instabilities as the manifestation of a more generic class of instabilities , the _ shear instabilities _",
    "@xcite , that is unstable oscillations that do not exist in uniformly rotating systems and are associated to the existence of a corotation band  @xcite .",
    "watts , andersson and jones suggest , in particular , that a necessary condition for the development of the instability is `` corotation '' , that is the presence of a point at which the star rotates at the same pattern speed of the unstable mode  @xcite .",
    "an alternative suggestion on the necessary conditions has been made also by ou and tohline  @xcite , who instead associate the development of the instability to the presence of a minimum in the vortensity profile of the star .",
    "this minimum can then drive unstable not only the corotating @xmath3-modes but also the odd modes such as the @xmath13 and @xmath16-modes  @xcite . in this interpretation",
    ", the growth time of the instability is proportional to distance between the corotation radius , _",
    "i.e. _  the radial position at which the unstable mode corotates with the star , and the minimum of the vortensity .",
    "the purpose of this work is to shed some light on the development of shear instabilities and , in particular , to validate one prediction made , although not explicitly , by watts , andersson and jones .",
    "more specifically , we show that , for sufficient amounts of differential rotation , shear instabilities develop for _ any value _ of the instability parameter @xmath1 and also below the expected critical value for the dynamical bar - mode instability .",
    "we therefore provide evidence that the low-@xmath2 instability is not a new instability but rather the manifestation of a shear instability in a region where the latter is possible only for small values of @xmath1 .",
    "our analysis proceeds via the simulation in full general relativity of sequences of neutron star models having constant rest - mass and constant degrees of differential rotation , but with different amounts of rotation , _",
    "i.e. _  with different values of @xmath1 .",
    "the neutron - star matter is described by a realistic equation of state ( eos ) defined by the unified sly prescription  @xcite and we study the development of the non - axisymmetric instabilities from their linear growth up to the fully nonlinear development and suppression .",
    "interestingly , we find that depending on the degree of differential rotation , the shear instability leads either to the growth of a single modes ( for the low-@xmath1 models ) or to the simultaneous presence of up to three unstable modes ( for the high-@xmath1 models ) , which produce beatings in the growth of the overall @xmath3 deformation .",
    "special attention is also paid to the properties of the unstable modes and to their position within the corotation band or the vortensity profiles . in this way we are able to confirm both",
    "the necessary conditions proposed so far for the onset of the instability . in particular , we show that all the unstable modes are within the corotation band of the progenitor axisymmetric model  ( _ cf .",
    "_  @xcite ) and that all of the unstable models have vortensity profiles with a local minimum ( _ cf .",
    "_  @xcite ) .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows : in section [ sec : numerics ] we describe the numerical setting of our simulations , the eos we used and the initial models we generated . in section [ sec : methodology ]",
    "we describe the quantities and tools we used to monitor the evolution of the instability . in section",
    "[ sec : results ] we report the results of the simulations and section [ sec : conclusions ] is dedicated to conclusions and discussion .",
    "we use a spacelike signature @xmath17 and a system of units in which @xmath18 ( or in cgs units whenever more convenient ) .",
    "greek indices are taken to run from @xmath19 to @xmath20 , latin indices from @xmath21 to @xmath20 and we adopt the standard convention for the summation over repeated indices .",
    "in what follows we provide a brief overview of the numerical setup used in the simulations , of the realistic eos adopted and on the procedure followed for the construction of the initial axisymmetric models .",
    "we solve numerically the full set of einstein equations @xmath22 where @xmath23 and @xmath24 are the einstein tensor and the stress - energy tensor , respectively .",
    "the equations are solved within the `` 3 + 1 '' decomposition of spacetime , in which the @xmath25-dimensional metric @xmath26 is decomposed into the spatial metric @xmath27 , the lapse function @xmath28 and the shift vector components @xmath29 .",
    "the field equations , which then also provide an evolution for the extrinsic curvature tensor @xmath30 , are then coupled to those of general relativistic hydrodynamics @xmath31 where , in the case of a perfect - fluid , the stress - energy tensor is given by @xmath32 above @xmath33 is the fluid @xmath25-velocity , @xmath34 is the fluid pressure , @xmath35 the specific internal energy and @xmath36 the rest - mass density , so that @xmath37 is the energy density in the rest frame of the fluid .",
    "the set of hydrodynamics equation is then closed by a prescription for the properties of the matter in the form of a relation between the pressure and other quantities in the fluid , _",
    "e.g. _  @xmath38 , and for which we have chosen a cold and realistic eos which will be discussed in the following section .",
    "the evolution of the spacetime was performed using the ` ccatie ` code , a three - dimensional finite - differencing code providing a solution of a conformal traceless formulation of the einstein equations ( see  @xcite for the explicit expressions of the equations solved in the code and also  @xcite for a more recent and improved implementation ) .",
    "the relativistic hydrodynamics equations , on the other hand , were solved using the ` whisky ` code , which adopts a flux - conservative formulation of the equations as presented in  @xcite and high - resolution shock - capturing schemes or hrsc ( see  @xcite for the explicit expressions of the equations solved in the code and also  @xcite for a more recent extension of the code to mhd ) .",
    "the ` whisky ` code implements several reconstruction methods , such as total - variation - diminishing ( tvd ) methods , essentially - non - oscillatory ( eno ) methods  @xcite and the piecewise parabolic method ( ppm )  @xcite .",
    "also , a variety of approximate riemann solvers can be used , starting from the harten - lax - van leer - einfeldt ( hlle ) solver  @xcite , over to the roe solver  @xcite and the marquina flux formula  @xcite ( see  @xcite for a more detailed discussion ) .",
    "all the results reported hereafter have been computed using the marquina flux formula and a ppm reconstruction .",
    "both the einstein and the hydrodynamics equations are solved using the vertex - centered adaptive mesh - refinement ( amr ) approach provided by the ` carpet ` driver  @xcite .",
    "our rather basic form of amr consists of box - in - box structures centered on the origin of the coordinate system and with the finest grid covering the whole star at all times .",
    "the simulations reported here make use of @xmath25 levels of refinement , with the finest having a resolution of @xmath39 and the coarsest one a resolution of @xmath40 .",
    "the outer boundary was set relatively close to the star and at a distance of @xmath41 , _",
    "i.e. _  at about @xmath42 times the size of the star . a reflection symmetry across the @xmath43 ( equatorial symmetry ) plane was used to reduce the computational costs , but not a rotational one around the @xmath44-axis ( @xmath45-symmetry ) as it would have artificially prevented the growth of odd-@xmath4 modes ( see discussion in  @xcite ) .",
    "as mentioned above , the system of hydrodynamics equations needs to be closed by an eos relating the pressure with the other primitive variables , _",
    "e.g. _  the rest - mass density .",
    "previous studies of the bar - mode instability , both in newtonian gravity and in general relativity , have been focused on the use of ideal fluids and analytic eoss , either in the form a of a `` polytropic '' ( and isentropic ) eos @xmath46 , or of an `` ideal - fluid '' and ( non - isentropic ) eos @xmath47 ( _ cf .",
    "_  discussion in  @xcite ) .",
    "while these two descriptions are expected to provide results that are qualitatively correct , a more accurate modelling of these instabilities in compact stars necessarily requires a more physically - motivated description of the neutron - star matter .",
    "it is in this spirit that we have here considered a realistic eos , namely the unified sly eos  @xcite , which models high - density and cold ( _ i.e. _  zero temperature ) matter via a skyrme effective potential for the nucleon - nucleon interactions .",
    "the sly eos , which describes via a single effective hamiltonian the neutron star s interior , is supplemented with the hp94 eos  @xcite to describe the crustal matter and with the bps eos  @xcite for lower density regions .",
    "this prescription results in a one - parameter eos in the form @xmath48 , where the sly eos is used for @xmath49 , the hp94 eos is used for @xmath50 and the bps eos for @xmath51 ( see also figure  1 of  @xcite ) .",
    "in addition , at even lower densities the eos becomes temperature dependent ( and thus no longer a simple barotropic eos ) , but because these these regions are well below the threshold for the artificial atmosphere , we do not consider an additional prescription for @xmath52 .",
    "we recall , in fact , that our hrsc methods require the use of a tenuous atmosphere which fills the regions of the computational domain not occupied by the compact star .",
    "the threshold value for the rest - mass density of the atmosphere is chosen to be several orders of magnitude smaller than the maximum value and in our simulation a fluid element is considered to be part of the atmosphere if its rest - mass density @xmath36 satisfies @xmath53 .",
    "when this happens the fluid element is treated as a non - dynamical cold fluid described by a polytropic eos , @xmath54 , with @xmath11 and @xmath55 and its velocity is set to zero ( see  @xcite for a more detailed discussion on the use of the atmosphere in the ` whisky ` code ) .",
    "the practical implementation of the realistic eos can take place in a number of different ways .",
    "the simplest is to use standard interpolation techniques , _",
    "e.g. _  based on lagrangian polynomials , on the values of the published tables .",
    "while straightforward , the interpolations in this approach do not guarantee in general that the thermodynamics relations are fulfilled ( see  @xcite for a thermodynamical preserving interpolation ) .",
    "in addition , the derivatives of the fields , _ e.g. _  of the pressure to evaluate the sound speed , are typically not available in the tables . furthermore , the use of high - order interpolation and/or finite differences can lead to undesirable spurious oscillations .    a second approach that removes",
    "all of these problems , uses analytic fits that have been proposed for the pressure . as an example , ref .",
    "@xcite suggested to fit the specific internal energy of the unified sly eos table with the expression @xmath56 where @xmath57 , @xmath36 and @xmath35 are in cgs units , and the coefficients @xmath58 are @xmath59 ( see table  @xmath60 of  @xcite ) .",
    "equation  ( [ eq : analfit ] ) is obtained from eq .",
    "( 15 ) of  @xcite after using @xmath61 , where @xmath62 is the baryon number density and @xmath63 is the mass of the nucleons . as discussed in  @xcite , it is then possible to compute the pressure from the value of @xmath35 using the first principle of thermodynamics at @xmath64 @xmath65 and thus to have an evaluation of the pressure which is thermodynamically consistent .",
    "the differences between the fit and the table are typically less then @xmath66 .",
    "unfortunately , although apparently very convenient , the evaluation of the fitting formulas containing several exponential and logarithmic functions , turns out to be computationally rather expensive even if done in a optimized way .    as a third approach , which combines the efficiency of a table search with the thermodynamical consistency of an analytic fit ,",
    "consists of performing a simple linear interpolation among the tabulated values constructed from the analytic fit . besides being highly efficient",
    ", a linear interpolation also eliminates the spurious oscillations that arise , for instance , in the derivative of the pressure if high - order interpolation formulas are used . in this case , the interpolation error can be reduced simply by populating the analytically constructed tables with a large number of entries , _ e.g. _",
    "@xmath67 in place of the @xmath68 which are typically available in published tables .",
    "this third approach is the one actually implemented in ` whisky ` and provides a speed up of about @xmath69 with respect to the evaluation of the pressure via the analytic fits and with comparable accuracy .",
    "the initial data for our simulations are prepared as stationary and axisymmetric equilibrium solutions for rapidly rotating relativistic stars  @xcite . adopting spherical quasi - isotropic coordinates ,",
    "the line element of the corresponding spacetime is @xmath70 where @xmath71 , @xmath72 , @xmath73 and @xmath74 are functions of @xmath75 and @xmath76 .",
    "moreover we assume the usual relativistic @xmath77-constant law of differential rotation and that amounts to assume an angular - velocity distribution of the form @xmath78 \\ , ,    \\label{eq : velocityprofile_gr}\\ ] ] where @xmath79 is the coordinate equatorial stellar radius and the coefficient @xmath80 provides a measure of the degree of differential rotation .",
    "expression  ( [ eq : velocityprofile_gr ] ) represents the general - relativistic equivalent of the simpler newtonian @xmath77-constant law  @xcite",

    "we have computed a very large number of initial models using the sly prescription for the eos for which we have computed _ baryonic _ mass @xmath86 , the gravitational mass @xmath87 , the angular momentum @xmath88 , the rotational kinetic energy @xmath7 and the gravitational binding energy @xmath8 defined as @xmath89 where @xmath90 is the square root of the determinant of three - dimensional metric @xmath27 and @xmath91 is the fluid lorentz factor .",

[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     out of this large set , we have then selected for the numerical evolution a number of models so as to build sequences of constant baryonic mass with @xmath101 , degree of differential rotation @xmath102 and values of the instability parameter @xmath1 ranging between @xmath103 and @xmath104 . each model in this sequence is supramassive , namely it has a mass which is larger than the maximum mass allowed for a corresponding nonrotating model , _",

    "i.e. _  @xmath106 .",
    "there are two different reasons why such a large - mass model has been chosen .",
    "the first one is that we are interested in the development of a shear instability in the metastable star produced by the merger of a binary system of two neutron stars .",
    "as shown by a number of authors and most recently in  @xcite , the product of this merger is either a supramassive or a hypermassive neutron star .",
    "hence , our reference model has a mass which is sufficiently large so as to be a reasonable approximation to the product of a binary neutron star merger .",
    "the second reason is that a sufficiently massive model is necessary in order to reach values of the instability parameter which are above the expected threshold for dynamical bar - mode instabilities as computed in  @xcite , _ i.e. _  @xmath107 .",
    "indeed , the maximum possible value for @xmath1 within the computed sequence is around @xmath108 and thus just above the threshold ( _ cf . _  long - dashed line in the left panel of figure [ fig : idb ] ) .",
    "note also that the threshold for the instability tends to increase for smaller rest - masses .",
    "overall , when comparing with equilibrium models generated with a polytropic eos with @xmath55 and @xmath11 ( see table  1 of  @xcite ) the realistic eos models reach higher compactness ( models in  @xcite typically have @xmath109 ) but lower values of @xmath1 ( _ i.e. _  @xmath110 for the models considered here , while @xmath111 for the polytropic models considered in  @xcite ) .",

    "although we postpone to sections  [ sec : evolution ] and  [ sec : necessary conditions ] the discussion of the implications of these corotation radii , two aspects of the initial data are worth emphasizing .",
    "the first one is that the amount of differential rotation for a given value of @xmath114 effectively decreases when increasing the instability parameter @xmath1 ( _ cf .",
    "_  left panel of figure  [ fig : ida ] ) , thus resulting in a smaller corotation band for models with large @xmath1 .",

    "a number of different quantities are calculated during the evolution to monitor the dynamics of the instability . among them",

    "of course , the use of @xmath120 in place of @xmath36 or of @xmath119 is arbitrary and all the three expressions would have the same newtonian limit , though with different amplitudes for the gravitational waveforms produced ( see for example @xcite ) .",

    "_  first row of figure [ fig : evolutiongeneral ] ) .",
    "however , as the rotation is increased , the development of the instability is more complex and at least two unstable modes appear which develop in different parts of the star .",

    "a similar behaviour is shown also by the evolution of the fourier modes .",
    "the two models with lower @xmath1 , in fact , show a clear growth of the @xmath3 mode and of the @xmath13 , with the latter becoming first comparable and then larger when the instability is suppressed . in models  ` m.1.250 , m.1.241 ` , on the other hand , the @xmath3 and @xmath16 modes have comparable amplitude for a long period and then the @xmath3 becomes the dominant one ( this is more clear in model  ` m.1.241 ` ) .",

    "more specifically , it is very apparent that at low @xmath1 the spectra have only one peak , whose maximum is marked by the vertical blue dotted lines and that is present at all the values of beta considered ; this is the mode we refer to as @xmath162 ( _ cf . _  table  [ table : results ] and figure  [ fig : corotation_band ] ) . as @xmath1 increases , the amplitude of this peak decreases and it becomes the weakest for very large rotation rates .",
    "starting from model  ` m.1.200 ` ( although a hint of a peak is present already in  ` m.1.160 ` ) , a second peak appears at higher frequency and is marked with magenta vertical dot - dashed lines ; this is the mode we refer to as @xmath163 and although it never becomes the largest one , its amplitude increases with @xmath1 .",
    "finally , a third peak appears at low frequency in the spectra starting from model  ` m.1.220 ` ( even though a hint is present also for model  ` m.1.210 ` ) and is marked with black vertical long - dashed lines .",
    "this mode , which we refer to as @xmath164 , becomes the dominant one at high @xmath1 .",
    "note also that in each panel of figure  [ fig : psd ] we report with a dashed blue box the corotation band that will be further discussed in the following section .    as a final remark we note that the peaks in the spectrum of @xmath165 ( red dashed lines in figure  [ fig : psd ] ) are related to axisymmetric @xmath166 modes and most likely to @xmath167-modes oscillation excited by the development of the instability .",
    "indeed , their frequencies @xmath168 match reasonably well the phenomenological fit for the @xmath167-mode frequencies of nonrotating neutron stars with realistic eoss computed in  @xcite .",
    "because our sequences do not contain nonrotating configurations ( the rest mass is larger than the maximum one ) , this association is just qualitative and a more detailed investigation of the frequency spectra of the equilibrium models is necessary to confirm this suggestion .",

    "the considerations they make are particularly simple : for high degrees of differential rotation , that is at low values of @xmath80 , the corotation band is rather wide and there will be both an upper value and a lower value of @xmath1 between which the shear instability can develop ( these critical values of @xmath1 correspond to the entrance and exit of the unstable mode in the corotation band ) .",
    "this situation corresponds therefore to the one commonly encountered in numerical simulations , such as those in  @xcite , and for which the shear instability takes place only for very small values of the instability parameter and on timescales that are much longer than the dynamical one .",
    "when moving to larger degrees of differential rotation , that is when going to smaller values of @xmath80 , the corotation band becomes larger and larger and the shear instability can develop essentially for all values of @xmath1 , merging with the dynamical bar - mode instability for @xmath312 .",
    "this is exactly what has been found here .",
    "conversely , when moving to smaller degrees of differential rotation , that is when going to higher values of @xmath80 , the corotation band becomes thinner and the shear instability can develop only for a smaller range of @xmath1 . as the differential rotation is further decreased and the star tends to rotate uniformly , the corotation band width vanishes , all the models are stable to the shear instability and subject only to the dynamical bar - mode instability for @xmath313 .",
    "this is indeed the case for the unstable models evolved in  @xcite , which were purely ( bar - mode ) dynamically unstable and none of which had the unstable mode within the corresponding corotation band , but above it .",
    "in essence , therefore , there should be an intermediate range of @xmath80 for which the instability is absent at low @xmath1 , appears at intermediate values and then disappears again at high @xmath1 , thus defining an interval of values of @xmath1 for which the models are unstable . to validate also this prediction we simulated a sequence of models with smaller differential rotation and @xmath152",
    "this seconds sequence has the same baryonic mass as that with @xmath314 , but with @xmath1 in a smaller range , namely between @xmath153 and @xmath115 ( note that @xmath115 is also very close to the largest value for which we could build an equilibrium model . ) unfortunately , also all of these models show an @xmath3 shear instability , with the unstable frequencies falling within the corotation band , as it was for the @xmath314 stars .",
    "of course , lack of evidence is not evidence of absence and the fact that we have not found stable models within our range of values of @xmath1 most likely means that these stable models have to be searched either for values of @xmath315 ( for this value of @xmath152 ) , or by moving towards higher values of @xmath80 , where the corotation band is less large .",
    "an obvious consequence of the phenomenological scenario described by  @xcite and confirmed by the calculations reported here is that the idea of a low-@xmath2 instability is indeed misleading and it is instead more meaningful to think of a more generic shear instability that , depending on the degree of rotation and of differential rotation , may manifest itself on timescales that are comparable with the dynamical ones ( as in the cases reported here ) or on much longer ones ( as in the cases reported in  @xcite ) .",
    "another phenomenological prediction made by watts , andersson and jones in  @xcite , is that the growth times should be shorter in the center of the band and increase towards the edges ( the growth times should in fact diverge at the edges ) .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig : corotation_band ] , all of the simulated models do have unstable modes well inside the corotation band and this probably explains why we observe them develop on a timescale which is comparable with the dynamical one and not on much longer timescales as in the original finding of  @xcite .",
    "we also find indications that the @xmath152 models , which generically have longer growth times , have unstable modes which occupy regions of the corotation band that are overall more central ( _ cf .",
    "_  right panel of figure  [ fig : corotation_band ] ) and thus in contrast with what expected from  @xcite .",
    "however , the difficulties mentioned above in computing an accurate estimate of the growth times and the intrinsic difficulties in determining what is the central part of the corotation band , prevent us from providing a more quantitative validation of this prediction .",
    "we now switch to consider our results in the light of the other necessary condition for the onset of the shear instability discussed in  @xcite .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , it has in fact been shown that the presence of a minimum in the profile of the vortensity is a necessary condition for a mode in corotation to be unstable  @xcite .",
    "the intuitive description is that the vortensity well can act as a resonant cavity inside the star , amplifying the modes that happen to lay near its minimum  @xcite . indeed",
    ", the growth rate of the unstable mode is expected to depend on the location of its corotation radius with respect to the vortensity profile , being proportional to the depth of its corotation radius inside the vortensity well  @xcite .",
    "note that the mere existence of a local minimum in the vortensity can not be used as a sufficient condition for the occurrence of a shear instability .",
    "all of the unstable models considered in  @xcite , in fact , do show a local minimum in the vortensity but do not have the unstable modes in the corotation band .",

    "when doing this we found that all the unstable models have vortensities with a local minimum in the star and this is shown in the left panel of figure [ fig : corot_rad ] , which reports the radial profiles of the vortensity @xmath316 for three representative models with small , medium and high values of @xmath1 .",

    "in the first case the vortensity well is considerably deeper , with @xmath319 , while for the latter the vortensity has shallower wells with @xmath320 .",
    "since the models with @xmath321 have smaller growth rates , our results indicate therefore that also the existence of a local minimum in the vortensity can be taken as a necessary condition for the development of the shear instability and that the depth of the vortensity well can be used to estimate the growth of the instability .",
    "for many years the properties of rapidly rotating and self - gravitating fluids have been characterized by a complete analytic perturbative theory which provided , for instance , sufficient conditions for the development of instabilities ( see , for instance ,  @xcite for a collection of results ) . as numerical simulations have become increasingly accurate and stable on longer timescales , these predictions , both in newtonian theory and in full general relativity ,",
    "have been verified , corrected and in some cases extended .",
    "our ability of modelling such configurations has now reached a maturity such that a number of new properties and instabilities have been `` discovered '' numerically , but which do not have behind a fully perturbative description .",
    "the main reason for this is that most of this phenomenology is the result of physical scenarios which are much more complex than the ones investigated perturbatively in the past , _",
    "e.g. _  non - isolated systems with high differential rotation and exchanging mass and angular momentum , which are much more difficult to treat analytically .",
    "a most notable example of these complex and yet ubiquitous instabilities is the so - called `` low-@xmath2 instability '' , which was initially found in  @xcite and then reproduced in a number of other different scenarios  @xcite .",
    "as the phenomenological description of this instability provided by the simulations has become richer and richer , a full understanding of the mechanisms that lead to its development has lagged behind and it is presently unclear .",
    "we are therefore in a situation in which numerical simulations can probe regimes and conditions which are not yet accessible to perturbative calculations , and can guide the latter by confirming or refuting those scenarios that although possible do not find a realization in practice .",
    "this work has followed this spirit and has used fully general - relativistic calculations of rapidly and differentially rotating neutron stars modeled with a realistic eos to shed some light on the development of the low-@xmath2 instability . in particular we have concentrated our attention on validating an indirect prediction , made by watts , andersson and jones  @xcite , who recognized the low-@xmath2 instability as the manifestation of a more generic class of instabilities associated to the existence of a corotation band  @xcite , the _ shear instabilities _ , and that should develop for _ any value _ of the instability parameter @xmath1 when sufficient amounts of differential rotation are present .",
    "this is exactly what we have found in our simulations .",
    "more specifically , we have performed simulations of sequences of neutron - star models described by a realistic sly eos  @xcite and having constant rest - mass and degrees of differential rotation , but with different amounts of rotation . in all cases",
    "considered we have found the development of a bar - mode instability growing on a dynamical timescale , even when the initial axisymmetric models were well below the critical limit for the dynamical bar - mode instability .",
    "these results , which match well the phenomenological scenario portrayed in  @xcite , suggest therefore that the idea of a low-@xmath2 instability is indeed misleading and should be replaced by the more general one of shear instability . depending then on the degree of rotation and of differential rotation",
    ", the instability will develop on timescales that are comparable to the dynamical one ( as reported here ) or on much longer ones ( as reported in the first low-@xmath2 instability studies ) .",
    "special attention has also been paid to the properties of the unstable modes and to their position within the corotation band or the vortensity profiles . in particular , we have shown that all the unstable modes are within the corotation band of the progenitor axisymmetric model ( which is the necessary condition for the development of the instability proposed by  @xcite ) and that all of the unstable models have vortensity profiles with a local minimum ( which is the necessary condition suggested by  @xcite ) .",
    "finally , by comparing the growth times among models with different degree of differential rotation we have shown that there is a correlation , although not a strong one , between the depth of the vortensity well and growth rate of the instability , with the latter being larger for models with deeper wells .    in summary ,",
    "the results presented here shed some light on several aspects of shear instabilities , but they also reveal that more work is required , for instance , to distinguish between the predictions based on the corotation band and the ones based on the vortensity well , or to establish whether in effect they just represent two different ways of expressing the same physical conditions .",
    "clarifying these aspects will requires additional analytical and numerical modelling , and this will be part of our future research .",
    "it is a pleasure to thank anna watts for enlightening discussions and for sharing her notes with us , as well as nils andersson , ian jones , joel tohline for useful comments .",
