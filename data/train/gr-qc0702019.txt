    "gravitational waves ( gw ) is one of the most important predictions of general relativity . in order to detect gw , several gw detectors are currently in operation around the world .",
    "however , the direct detection of gw has not been possible so far .",
    "since the expected amplitude of gw is very small , multi - detector searches for gw are very important .",
    "a multi - detector search would ( i ) improve the detection efficiency ; ( ii ) improve our confidence in detection of a gw event , if a candidate event is registered ; ( iii ) provide useful directional information on the gw event if the detectors are sufficiently geographically separated ; ( iv ) provide polarization information if differently oriented .    in our previous paper @xcite ( hereafter , paper i )",
    ", we discussed two different multi - detector detection strategies ; the coherent strategy and the coincident strategy .",
    "the coherent strategy was discussed by pai , dhurandhar and bose @xcite , and by finn @xcite .",
    "the target signal was the gw from inspiraling compact binaries for which the wave forms have been well studied .",
    "we considered the situation of two co - aligned and co - located detectors .",
    "we constructed the coherent statistic based on the maximum likelihood method .",
    "we then compared the coherent method with the conventional coincident method by comparing the receiver operating characteristic ( roc ) curves .",
    "we found that we could obtain better detection probability by the coherent method than by the coincident method .",
    "this conclusion was not changed even if the two detectors were correlated .    in this paper",
    ", we consider two detectors with the same configuration as in paper i. we discuss the refined derivation of the coherent statistic from the maximum likelihood statistic in the case when the detectors noises are correlated .",
    "this statistic is slightly different from , and better than the one , we obtained in our previous work ( paper i ) . here",
    "we present the mathematical proof of the superiority of the new statistic over the old one . in the special case when the cross - spectrum of two detectors normalized by the power spectrum density is constant",
    ", the new statistic agrees with the old one .",
    "further , the quantitative difference of the detection probability for a given false alarm rate is also evaluated for a simple case .",
    "we consider two detectors which have same orientation , same arm length and the same noise power spectral density .",
    "we denote the one sided noise power spectrum density ( psd ) common to each of the detectors as @xmath0 which has the property , n_i ( f ) n^*_i(f ) = s_h ( f ) ( f - f ) , [ psd ] where @xmath1 is the noise in detector @xmath2 .",
    "the angular brackets denote ensemble average .",
    "we assume the correlation of two detectors expressed by n_1 ( f ) n^*_2(f ) = ( f ) s_h ( f ) ( f - f ) , [ noisecorr ] where @xmath3 represents the cross - spectrum .",
