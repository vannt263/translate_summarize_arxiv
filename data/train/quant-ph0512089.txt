    "recently , interest in the quantum nature of atomic ensembles has been growing . to measure the quantum nature of the atomic ensembles ,",
    "one of the most useful interaction is paramagnetic faraday rotation of light @xcite . under some conditions ,",
    "the probing of the atomic ensembles via the paramagnetic faraday rotation with a polarimeter becomes quantum non - demolition measurement of spin ( spin qnd ) @xcite .",
    "spin qnd is not only a quantum measurement , but also has a wide variety of the applications . for example , spin squeezing , entanglement of two macroscopic objects , and quantum memory for light have been demonstrated @xcite .",
    "these application of spin qnd will be some breakthroughes not only in precision measurements but also quantum information processings .",
    "if we can perform the spin qnd successively on the same atomic ensemble system , various interesting applications such as quantum teleportation would become possible .",
    "for such purposes , each probe time @xmath2 must be much shorter than the spin coherence time of the system @xmath3 .",
    "moreover , the probe laser should be tunable to a particular atomic resonance , and the detuning @xmath4 of the probe laser frequency from atomic resonance should be larger than the atomic linewidth @xmath5 ; @xmath6 is required , where @xmath7 is the lifetime of the excited state , because the decoherence due to the photon scattering should be avoided @xcite .",
    "the bandwidth of the probe laser @xmath8 needs not to be narrower than the linewidth @xmath5 , but in the case of @xmath9 , we can safely ignore the effect of finite bandwidth of the laser in the analysis at any detunings .",
    "therefore , we adopt the conditions @xmath10 and @xmath11 for ideal spin qnd . to the best of our knowledge , the most shortest probe time @xmath2 in the applications of the spin qnd is @xmath12 in ref .",
    "@xcite , where @xmath13 .",
    "although the polarimeter for the pulse of duration @xmath2 of much less than one nano - second has developed by use of pulse lasers for the interest in the quantum cryptography @xcite , it is , however , inappropriate for spin qnd , because the pulse laser is not tunable to a certain atomic resonance , and has wide frequency bandwidth compared with the natural full linewidth @xmath5 . therefore , it is necessary to newly develop suitable detector as well as the light source .    in this paper , we report the development of tunable and narrowband fast polarimetry system suitable for the application to spin qnd , and also report the measurement of the vacuum noise to demonstrate the performance .",
    "the pulse width @xmath2 could be as short as 100 ns , nearly three order of magnitude improvement from the previous experiment of ref .",
    "especially , we designed our system tunable for ytterbium ( yb ) atomic resonance of @xmath14 transition with the resonant wavelength of @xmath15 , because yb is one of the best sample for spin qnd with long coherence time compared with alkali - atoms .",
    "it should be noted that this system is qualitatively different from the previous ones in which a frequency side - band was measured by using spectrum analyzers as in ref .",
    "technically , the pulse - mode operation in which a single quantum measurement is performed for each pulse @xcite is usually difficult because the noise of the system must be quantum - noise limited over broad frequency bandwidths .",
    "firstly , let us review spin qnd and the vacuum noise .",
    "the interaction hamiltonian of the paramagnetic faraday rotation takes the form @xcite , @xmath16 where @xmath17 is a real constant .",
    "@xmath18 is the summation over the individual spin , which obeys the usual commutation relation of angular momenta @xmath19=i\\varepsilon_{ijk}s_k$ ] , and the @xmath20 axis is set parallel to the wave vector of the probe light .",
    "@xmath21 is the quantum - mechanical stokes vector of the light , which also obeys the usual commutation relation of angular momenta @xmath22=i\\varepsilon_{ijk}j_k$ ] . for a light pulse with the duration @xmath2 propagating in free space",
    ", @xmath21 can be written as @xmath23 , @xmath24 , and @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the annihilation operators of @xmath27 circular polarization mode , respectively @xcite . from the backaction evasion",
    "@xmath28=0 $ ] , this can be regarded as spin qnd .",
    "after the interaction time @xmath29 , the @xmath30 component of the stokes vector becomes @xmath31 for @xmath32 .",
    "therefore , by measureing @xmath33 , we can obtain information about @xmath34 . in fig .",
    "[ qnd ] , we show the schematic of spin qnd .",
    "axis @xmath34 can be quantum non - demolitionally measured via the paramagnetic faraday rotation by a polarimeter .",
    "the polarimeter consists of a polarization beam splitter ( pbs ) , a photodiode ( pd ) and a differential amplifier . ]",
    "we consider the case that the probe light is a coherent pulse which is linearly polarized along @xmath35 axis and contains @xmath36 photons on the average , and the polarimeter is set so as to measure the @xmath30-component of the stokes vector @xmath33 .    the probability of obtaining the value @xmath37 for the measurement of @xmath33 is @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the partial trace for the spin , @xmath40 is the eigenstate of @xmath33 with the eigenvalue of @xmath37 and @xmath41 is the density operator for the initial state of the spin and the probe light . without the atomic ensemble ,",
    "@xmath42 becomes @xcite @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the standard deviation . in this paper , we call this distribution of eq.([vacuum ] ) `` vacuum noise '' . with the atomic ensemble ,",
    "the distribution @xmath42 is broadened as @xmath45 , which is easily derived from eq .",
    "( [ j_y(t_1 ) ] ) . in general , the second term can become enlarge compared with the first term by prepareing a large number of atoms .",
    "therefore , if the vacuum noise can be measured with the polarimeter without atomic ensemble , which would be confirmed by the magnitude of @xmath46 , and its dependence on @xmath47 , the performance of the polarimeter is usually sufficient in the application of spin qnd @xcite .",
    "as the cw light source , we constructed an external cavity laser diode ( ecld ) .",
    "it provides a nominal cw output the power of about 10mw , where we use a gan laser diode ( nichia nlhv3000e ) .",
    "it is tunable around the resonant wavelength 399.8 nm , and has the linewidth of several mhz , which is narrower than the full natural linewidth @xmath48 @xcite . to confirm that the laser frequency @xmath49 is fixed at the off - resonance of @xmath50 , we concurrently monitored the transmission of an optogalvano cell ( hamamatsu l2783 - 70ar - yb )",
    ", whose spectrum is well broadend by the doppler effects and the buffer gas collision . in fig .",
    "[ ecld ] , we show the transmission spectrum of the optogalvano cell , which is well broadened compared with the isotope shifts and hyperfine splittings @xcite , as well as the transmission spectra of the yb atomic beam and the reference cavity with fsr=750 mhz .        to obtain an appropriate pulse from cw laser , we used a 1st - order diffracted light from an aom ( isomet 1206c-833 ) .",
    "the pulse duration @xmath2 is variable by an pulser to the aom . to cut the higher order diffraction and to shape the transverse mode , the diffracted light from the aom",
    "was passed through two lenses and a pinhole . to obtain ideal linear polarization along the @xmath35 axis , a @xmath51 plate and a beamsplitting thompson prism ( melles griot 03ptb001 ) were also used , whose extinction ratio is @xmath52 . as the adjustment of photon number per pulse @xmath53 ,",
    "an neutral density ( nd ) filter was set in front of the prism .",
    "we show these experimental setup in fig.[diagram.eps ] .",
    "we dare to perform the measurements using the vacuum chamber for the atom source to demonstrate robustness of our sysytem . while the present paper describes the performance of the polarimetry system alone , however , not only the atomic beam but also the cold atoms are ready to be loaded in the vacuum chamber @xcite .    as the photodetectors ( pds ) in the polarimeter , we use sillicon pin photodiodes ( hamamatsu s5973 - 02 ) , with quantum effeciency @xmath54 . as the differential amplifier in the polarimeter ,",
    "we use a charge sensitive amplifier ( amptek pc250 ) and a shaping amplifier ( amptek pc275 ) . in fig.[amp ] , we show the response for a light pulse of the duration @xmath55 ns .",

    "here , we explain the procedure and results of the measurement of the vacuum noise .",
    "total photoelectron per pulse in the two pds @xmath53 and the number difference between the two pds @xmath37 , is obtained with the following procedure ; the average amplitude of the charge sensitive amplifier output corresponds to @xmath47 and was obtained with the light to one of the pds blocked .",

    "we think that the error is due to the precision of @xmath70 . however , the dependence on @xmath53 well agrees with @xmath71 .",
    "the intrinstic excess noise was about @xmath72 , which is negligible compared with the vacuum noise for @xmath0 to @xmath1 photon number per pulse . from these results , we concluded that we could successfully measure the vacuum noise .",
    "it is also noted that we confirmed that the measurement of the vacuum noise is possible with the other photodiodes ( hamamatsu s7797 , hamamatsu s9687 ) , and with other durations ( @xmath73 ns , 200 ns , 600 ns ) .",
    "finally we note that toward the application to spin qnd we have also succeeded in performing two - pulse polarimetry with pulse separation of as short as 5 @xmath74 by using two - independent polarimeters developed in this work .",
    "the vacuum - noise limited performance was confirmed and no apparent classical correlation was observed between the readouts of the two polarimeters .",
    "we successfully measured the vacuum noise of a light pulse from tunable cw laser for atom .",
    "especially , we constructed the system for ytterbium ( yb ) , because yb is the best sample for spin qnd . the pulse duration @xmath75 ns is much shorter than the previous experiments of the application of the spin qnd @xcite , which will enhance the abilities of the quantum information processing with atomic ensemble",
    "moreover , this technique is advantageous for reserach on quantum nature of atomic spin ensemble , such as squeezed spin state @xcite .",
