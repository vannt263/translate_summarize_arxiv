    "the minimal state - independent proof of ks - contextuality requires a qutrit and @xmath6 projectors @xcite .",
    "the minimal state - dependent proof @xcite , first given by klyachko et al . , requires a qutrit and five projectors ( fig .",
    "[ kcbs ] ) .",
    "thus a qutrit is the simplest quantum system that allows a proof of ks - contextuality , both state - independent and state - dependent .",
    "however , we note that generalizations of ks - noncontextuality for a qubit have been considered earlier @xcite in a manner that is different from our approach . the precise difference , and the merits of our approach over earlier attempts , are discussed at length in ref .",

    "we simply note that our approach builds upon the work of spekkens @xcite and liang et .",

    "generalized noncontextuality allows outcome - indeterministic response functions for unsharp measurements in the ontological model while ks - nchv models insist on outcome - deterministic response functions .",
    "in particular , generalized noncontextuality insists on the noncontextuality of _ probability _ assignments to measurement outcomes rather than the stronger ks - noncontextual assumption of the noncontextuality of _ value _ assignments . a ks - nchv model is necessarily generalized - noncontextual but the converse is not true .",
    "further , while the assumption of ks - noncontextuality applies to projective measurements in quantum theory , the assumption of generalized noncontextuality applies to all experimental procedures ",

[ specker ] ) , requires three two - valued measurements , @xmath7 , to allow for three non - trivial contexts : @xmath8 . any other choice of contexts will be trivially ks - noncontextual , e.g. , @xmath9 is ks - noncontextual because the joint probability distribution @xmath10 reproduces the marginal statistics . by implication ,",

    "specker s scenario precludes projective measurements because a set of three pairwise commuting projective measurements is trivially jointly measurable and can not show any contextuality .",
    "one may surmise that it represents a kind of contextuality that is not seen in quantum theory .",
    "however , as liang et al . showed @xcite , this contextuality scenario can be realized using noisy spin-1/2 observables . if one does not assume outcome - determinism for unsharp measurements and models them stochastically but noncontextually , then this generalized - noncontextual model for noisy spin-1/2 observables will obey a bound of @xmath17 , where @xmath18 $ ] is the sharpness associated with each observable .",

    "a discussion of this generalized noncontextual model and its ontological meaning , compared to the usual ks - nchv model , is provided in appendix [ modelcompare ] , where we also point out the merits of generalized noncontextuality over ks - noncontextuality as a benchmark for nonclassicality . for a more detailed analysis of these issues",

    "a violation of the lsw inequality is interesting primarily because the benchmark for nonclassicality set by generalized noncontextuality is more stringent than the one set by the traditional notion of ks - noncontextuality .",
    "the lsw inequality takes into account , for example , the possibility that the measurement apparatus could introduce anticorrelations that have nothing to do with hidden variable(s ) one could associate with the system s preparation .",
    "this would allow violation of the ks - noncontextual bound of @xmath16 when the measurement is unsharp ( @xmath138 ) even though this violation could purely be a result of noise coming from elsewhere , such as the measurement apparatus , rather than a consequence of quantum theory .",
    "a violation of the lsw inequality , on the other hand , rules out this possibility and certifies genuine nonclassicality that can not be attributed to hidden variables associated with either the preparation or the noise . as argued by spekkens @xcite , the appropriate notion of noncontextuality for unsharp measurements is one that allows outcome - indeterministic response functions .",
    "an interesting open question is whether such a violation is possible in higher dimensional systems and whether the amount of violation could be higher for these than for a qubit . whether a state - independent violation of the lsw inequality is possible in higher dimensions",
    "also remains an open question .",
    "our result also hints at the fact that perhaps all contextuality scenarios may be realizable and contextuality demonstrated if we consider the possibilities that general quantum measurements allow . in particular , scenarios that involve pairwise compatibility between all measurements but no global compatibility may be realizable within quantum theory .",
    "specker s scenario is the simplest such example we have considered . indeed , as later shown in ref .",
    "@xcite after the present work was completed , quantum theory does admit all contextuality scenarios since it allows one to realize any conceivable set of ( in)compatibility relations between a set of observables .    in summary ,",
    "the joint measurability allowed in a theory restricts the kind of contextuality scenarios that can arise in it .",
    "quantum theory admits specker s contextuality scenario with unsharp measurements @xcite .",
    "further , as we have shown , quantum theory allows violation of the lsw inequality in this scenario .",
    "thus quantum theory is contextual even in the simplest contextuality scenario .",
    "whether , and to what extent , this is the case with more complicated contextuality scenarios realizable , for example , via the construction in ref .",
