    "streamwise roll vortices and associated streamwise streaks were identified in experiments on transition in boundary layers  @xcite and observed in the near wall region of turbulent flows  @xcite .",
    "these observations were subsequently corroborated by direct numerical simulations ( dns ) ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) and the roll / streak structure is now understood to be central to the dynamics of turbulence in wall - bounded shear flows .",
    "there are two distinct dynamical problems central to understanding wall - turbulence : transition from the laminar to the turbulent state and maintenance of the turbulent state .",
    "the roll / streak structure , despite being hydrodynamically stable , is commonly agreed to be involved in instigating transition from the laminar to the turbulent state in these flows . after transition",
    "this structure persists but becomes highly variable in both space and time .",
    "this time - dependent streamwise roll and streak structure is believed to be involved in the process maintaining turbulence in shear flow that is referred to as the self - sustaining process @xcite . moreover",
    ", this self - sustaining mechanism appears to be quite general in that it operates not only in the near - wall region but also , and independently , in the logarithmic layer @xcite .",
    "our primary interest in this work is in the robust observation of the roll / streak structure in wall - bounded shear flow prior to transition and in understanding the role of this structure in the transition process .",
    "the prominence of the roll / streak in these flows presents a problem because this structure is linearly stable .",
    "the robust observation of the roll / streak structure was first rationalized by appeal to the lift - up mechanism which describes the kinematic conversion of wall normal velocity into streamwise streak velocity in sheared flows @xcite .",
    "this insight was later advanced by recognition that the lift - up mechanism could be subsumed into the analytical structure of generalized stability theory ( gst ) by which modal stability theory and non - normal transient growth analysis are united @xcite . while modal stability analysis provides no reason to expect appearance of roll / streak structures , gst analysis predicts optimally growing perturbations with the observed form @xcite .",
    "the success of optimal growth theory in predicting the observed roll / streak structure in laminar wall - bounded shear flow appeared at first to be persuasive that the explanation for observations of this structure in pre - transitional flow was secure .",
    "moreover , in the case of laminar flow there is no known alternative mechanism .",
    "nevertheless , there remained a lingering doubt .",
    "for one thing , there is the regularity of the spacing and amplitude of the roll / streak in experiments @xcite , which , as remarked by townsend @xcite , is characteristic of modal growth .",
    "and then there is the observation that streamwise rolls decay in amplitude if fst levels are sufficiently low , consistent with predictions based on transiently growing optimals @xcite , while rolls grow downstream in the presence of moderate levels of fst @xcite which is incompatible with transient growth and suggestive of an underlying unstable mode .",
    "while the absence of roll / streak instability in laminar wall - bounded shear flow is established , pseudospectral theory @xcite reveals that a highly non - normal operator , such as that of navier - stokes ( ns ) dynamics linearized about a strongly sheared flow , can be destabilized by small perturbations to the dynamical operator itself .",
    "consistently , it was recently shown that an emergent instability of the roll / streak structure exists in the presence of operator perturbation arising from interaction between the roll / streak structure and fst @xcite .",
    "this nonlinear instability does not have analytical expression in the linearized ns dynamics of the laminar flow because the perturbations to the dynamical operator that destabilize it do not arise from a linear instability of the laminar shear flow dynamics but instead arise from systematic organization by the roll / streak structure of the reynolds stress associated with the incoherent background of fst . the analytical expression for this instability",
    "is contained in the equations for the associated statistical state dynamics ( ssd ) .",
    "the formulation of ssd used in this work , referred to as s3 t , is a second order closure in which full nonlinearity is retained in the streamwise mean equation while the dynamics of the perturbation covariance is linearized about the instantaneous streamwise mean flow .",
    "nonlinear interaction occurs between the mean flow dynamics ( defined as flow components with streamwise wavenumber @xmath0 ) and the perturbation covariance obtained from flow components with streamwise wavenumber @xmath1 .",
    "this quasi - linear formulation is referred to as the restricted nonlinear ( rnl ) approximation to the nonlinear navier  stokes dynamics ( nl ) . because the nonlinear perturbation - perturbation interactions have been neglected in the perturbation equation , rnl / s3 t does not support a classical turbulent cascade .",
    "consistent with our interpretation of rnl as an approximation to the s3 t version of ssd , the perturbation equation in rnl is used only to calculate an approximate covariance .",
    "one consequence of this is that phase information is not retained for the perturbation fields , only their second order correlations being relevant to this second order ssd .",
    "the approximation to the perturbation covariance obtained using rnl dynamics can be improved by forming a mean covariance from the covariances obtained from an ensemble of rnl perturbation equations sharing a single mean flow . in the case",
    "that an @xmath2-member ensemble is used to approximate the covariance the ssd approximation is referred to as rnl@xmath3 ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) . in the limit @xmath4 s3 t dynamics is recovered .",
    "rnl has the advantage that it can be easily implemented at high resolution while retaining the analytical restrictions of s3 t .",
    "moreover , simulations made using rnl can be compared to the same dns implementation that was restricted to obtain the rnl system .",
    "further insight can be obtained by proceeding similarly with the ns equations , formally writing the full dynamics in mean / perturbation form and then calculating an ensemble average second order closure using an @xmath2-member ensemble of perturbation equations sharing a single mean flow in a manner parallel to the method used in constructing rnl@xmath3 but retaining full nonlinearity in the individual perturbation equations of the ensemble .",
    "this closure will be referred to as nl@xmath3 .",
    "when it converges nl@xmath3 corresponds to a complete cumulant expansion of the ssd solved up to second order .",
    "we find that in our example problem satisfactory convergence of rnl@xmath3 and nl@xmath3 is obtained for @xmath2 as small as @xmath5 .",
    "consider a couette flow subjected to a random excitation that is statistically streamwise and spanwise homogeneous and has zero mean with respect to time and space averaging .",
    "s3 t predicts a bifurcation occurring at a critical amplitude of the fst excitation in which an unstable roll / streak structure emerges as an instability of the s3 t dynamics .",
    "as the fst excitation is increased at first the streamwise and spanwise averaged mean flow differs little from the laminar couette profile while superimposed on this profile is a fixed point finite amplitude roll / streak structure . with further increase in the excitation amplitude another critical value",
    "is exceeded at which the flow transitions to turbulence .",

    "<S> although the roll / streak structure is ubiquitous in both observations and simulations of pre - transitional wall - bounded shear flow , this structure is linearly stable if the idealization of laminar flow is made . lacking an instability , the large transient growth of the roll / streak structure has been invoked to explain its appearance as resulting from chance occurrence in the free - stream turbulence ( fst ) of perturbations configured to optimally excite it . </S>",
    "<S> however , there is an alternative interpretation for the role of free - stream turbulence in the genesis of the roll / streak structure which is that fst interacts with the roll / streak structure to destabilize it . </S>",
    "<S> statistical state dynamics ( ssd ) provides analysis methods for studying instabilities of this type which arise from interaction between the coherent and incoherent components of turbulence . </S>",
    "<S> stochastic structural stability theory ( s3 t ) , which implements ssd in the form of a closure at second order , is used in this work to analyze the ssd modes arising from interaction between the coherent streamwise invariant component and the incoherent fst component of turbulence . in </S>",
    "<S> pre - transitional couette flow a manifold of stable modes with roll / streak form is found to exist in the presence of small amplitude fst . </S>",
    "<S> the least stable mode of this manifold is destabilized at a critical value of a parameter controlling fst intensity and a finite amplitude roll / streak structure arises from this instability through a bifurcation in this parameter . </S>",
    "<S> although this bifurcation has analytical expression only in ssd , it is closely reflected in both the dynamically similar quasi - linear system , referred to as the restricted non - linear ( rnl ) system , and in dns . </S>",

    "<S> s3 t also predicts a second bifurcation at a higher value of the turbulent excitation parameter that results in destabilization of the finite amplitude roll / streak equilibria . </S>",
    "<S> this second bifurcation is shown to lead first to time dependence of the roll / streak in the s3 t system and then to chaotic fluctuation corresponding to minimal channel turbulence . </S>",
    "<S> this transition scenario is also verified in simulations of the rnl and dns systems . </S>",
    "<S> bifurcation from a finite amplitude roll / streak equilibrium provides a direct route to the turbulent state through the s3 t roll / streak instability . </S>"
