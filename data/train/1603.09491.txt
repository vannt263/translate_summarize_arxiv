    "risk measurement is a matter of primary concern to the financial services industry .",
    "the most widely used risk measure is the value at risk ( @xmath1 ) , which is the negative of the right @xmath3-quantile @xmath4 , for some conventional confidence level @xmath3 ( e.g. @xmath5 ) .",
    "@xmath1 became popular as a law invariant risk measure for its simple formulation and facility of computation , however , it presents several limits .",
    "first , @xmath1 lacks convexity with respect to random variables which , in general , penalize diversification .",
    "@xmath1 satisfies , instead , the quasi - convexity property with respect to distributions @xcite .",
    "this condition has a natural interpretation in terms of compound lotteries : the risk of the compound lottery is not higher than the one of the riskiest lottery .",
    "another relevant issue of @xmath1 is the lack of sensitivity to the tail risk as it attributes the same risk to distributions having the same quantile but different tail behaviour .",
    "recently , a new risk measure , the lambda value at risk ( @xmath0 ) , has been proposed by @xcite .",
    "@xmath0 seems to be interesting for its ability to capture the tail risk by generalizing @xmath1 .",
    "specifically , @xmath0 is defined as follows : @xmath6 where @xmath7 $ ] with @xmath8 is a right continuous and monotone function . when the @xmath9 function is constantly equal to some @xmath10 it coincides with the definition of @xmath1 with confidence level @xmath3 .",
    "the main idea is that the confidence level can change and it is a function of the asset s losses . in this way , @xmath0 is able to discriminate the risk among p@xmath2l distributions with the same quantile but different tail behaviour . in this regard ,",
    "the sensitivity of @xmath0 is up to the @xmath11-quantile of a distribution , since , by definition , @xmath12 .",
    "nevertheless , the requirement @xmath13 is only technical and @xmath11 can be chosen arbitrarily close to @xmath14 .",
    "properties of @xmath0 such as monotonicity and quasiconvexity are obtained in @xcite in full generality ( i.e. allowing also for @xmath15 ) .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to study if @xmath0 satisfies other important properties for a risk measure also satisfied by @xmath1 .",
    "we first focus on the so - called _ robustness _ that refers to the insensitivity of a risk estimator to small changes in the data set .",
    "we adopt the hampel s classical notion of qualitative robustness @xcite , also considered by @xcite for general risk measures ( a stronger notion has been later proposed by @xcite for convex risk measures ) .",
    "we show that the historical estimator of @xmath0 is robust within a family of distributions which depends on @xmath9 .",
    "in particular , we recover the result of @xcite for @xmath1 , in the case of @xmath16 .",
    "a second property we investigate is the _ elicitability _ for @xmath0 .",
    "several authors underlined the importance of this property in the risk management and backtesting practice @xcite .",
    "specifically , the elicitability allows the comparison of risk measure forecasts and provides a natural methodology to perform the backtesting .",
    "as for the case of @xmath1 , also @xmath0 is elicitable in a particular family of distributions which depends on @xmath9 and , for the particular case of @xmath16 , we recover the results of @xcite .",
    "note that the elicitability for @xmath9 decreasing was already observed by @xcite , we extend here to the most interesting case of @xmath9 increasing .",
    "finally , we study the consistency property , as recently proposed by @xcite . in this study",
    ", davis argues that the decision - theoretic framework of elicitability assumes the strong assumption that the theoretical p@xmath2l distribution is known and remain unchanged at any time . he thus suggests , under a more refined framework , the use of the so - called _ consistency _ property , in order to verify if a risk measure produces accurate estimates.we show that @xmath0 satisfies the consistency property without any assumption on the p@xmath2l generating process , as in the case of @xmath1 .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows . after introducing the basic notions and definitions , in section [ notations and definitions ] , we start examining the robustness property in section [ robustness ] .",
    "we dedicate the section [ elicitability ] to the elicitability of @xmath0 . finally , in section [ consistency ] , we refine the theoretical framework and we verify the consistency of @xmath0 .",
    "let @xmath17 be a non - atomic probability space and @xmath18 be the space of @xmath19-measurable random variables that are @xmath20-almost surely finite .",
    "we assume that @xmath21 represents a financial position ( i.e. a loss when @xmath22 and a profit when @xmath23 ) .",
    "any random variable @xmath24 induces a probability measure @xmath25 on @xmath26,@xmath27 by @xmath28 for every borel set @xmath29 and @xmath30 $ ] denote its distribution function .",
    "let @xmath31 be the set of distribution functions and @xmath32 those with finite first moment .",
    "a risk measure is a map @xmath33 that assigns to each return @xmath34 a number representing the minimal amount of capital required by the regulator in order to cover its financial risk .",
    "the majority of risk measures used in finance are distribution - based risk measures , that is , they assign the same value to random variables with the same distribution .",
    "such risk measures @xmath35 are called law - invariant , more formally they satisfy : @xmath36 in this way , a risk measure @xmath35 can be represented as a map on a set @xmath37 of distributions . with a slight abuse of notation , we still denote this map by @xmath35 and set : @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the distribution function of @xmath40 . since the seminal paper by @xcite , the theory of risk measures has been based on the study of their minimal properties .",
    "also when risk measures are defined on distributions , monotonicity is generally accepted ; formally , for any @xmath41 , @xmath35 is monotone if : @xmath42 other properties have been discussed by academics . as pointed out in @xcite , the convexity property , for risk measures defined on distributions ,",
    "is not compatible with the translation invariance property .",
    "thus , we might require @xmath35 to satisfy quasiconvexity @xcite : @xmath43 , \\ \\",
    "\\rho(\\gamma f_1 + ( 1-\\gamma)f_2 ) \\leq \\max(\\rho(f_1),\\rho(f_2)).\\ ] ]    it is widely accepted in the financial industry to adopt the risk measure value at risk ( @xmath1 ) at a confidence level @xmath44 , that is defined as follows ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* definition 3.3 ) : @xmath45 @xmath1 is monotone and quasiconvex @xcite but , obviously from the definition , it is not tail - sensitive . in order to overcome its limits",
    ", the @xcite recommends the use of expected shortfall ( @xmath46 ) , formally given by : @xmath47    @xmath46 is able , by definition , to evaluate the tail risk and it satisfies the subadditivity property on random variables @xcite .",
    "another tail sensitive risk measure is lambda value at risk ( @xmath0 ) , recently introduced by @xcite , whose properties are the main topic of this paper .",
    "@xmath0 generalizes @xmath1 by considering a function @xmath9 instead of a constant @xmath3 in the definition of @xmath1 .",
    "the advantages of considering the @xmath9 function are twofold : on the one hand , @xmath0 provides a criterion to change the confidence level when the market condition changes ( e.g. putting aside more capital in case of expected greater losses ) , on the other hand , it allows differentiating the risk of p@xmath2l distributions with different tail behaviour .",
    "formally , @xmath0 is defined by :    [ deflvar ] @xmath48 where @xmath7 $ ] with @xmath8 is a right continuous and monotone function .    intuitively ,",
    "if both @xmath39 and @xmath9 are continuous , @xmath0 is given by the smallest intersection between @xmath39 and @xmath9 .",
    "unlike es , @xmath0 lacks subadditivity , positive homogeneity and translation invariance when defined on random variables , nevertheless , @xmath0 is monotone and quasiconvex on the set of distributions ( for a discussion on these properties see section 4 of * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "evaluating the goodness of a risk measure involves determining how its computation can be affected by estimation issues .",
    "the problem consists in examining the sensitivity of a risk measure to small changes in the available data set ; for this reason , _ robustness _ seems to be a key property . in this context , the first rigorous study is given by @xcite .",
    "the authors pointed out that the notion of robustness should be referred to the `` risk estimator '' , as outcome of a `` risk measurement procedure '' ( see * ? ? ? * for details ) , and they founded the problem on the hampel s classical notion of qualitative robustness @xcite .",
    "basically , a risk estimator is called robust if small changes in the p@xmath2l distribution implies small changes in the law of the estimator .",
    "they consider the case of historical estimators @xmath49 , those obtained by applying the risk measure @xmath35 to the empirical distribution @xmath50 , and they conclude that historical estimator of @xmath1 leads to more robust procedures than alternative law - invariant coherent risk measures .",
    "afterwards , @xcite and @xcite argued that the hampel s notion does not discriminate among p@xmath2l distributions with different tail behaviour and , hence , is not suitable for studying the robustness of risk measures that are sensitive to the tails , such as @xmath46 .",
    "so they focused on the case of law - invariant coherent risk measures and they showed that robustness is not entirely lost , but only to some degree , if a stronger notion is used .",
    "substantially , the robustness of a risk estimator is based on the choice of a particular metric and different metrics leads to a more or less strong definition . however , as pointed out by @xcite , a proper definition of robustness is still a matter of primary concern .",
    "the aim of this section is to study the robustness of @xmath0 , where we use the weakest definition of robustness proposed by @xcite .",
    "let us denote with @xmath51 the @xmath52-tuple representing a particular data set , where @xmath53 is the set of all the possible data sets .",
    "the estimation of @xmath39 given a particular data set @xmath54 is denoted with @xmath50 and represents the map @xmath55 .",
    "we call risk estimator the map @xmath56 that associates to a specific data set @xmath54 the following value : @xmath57 in particular , the historical estimator @xmath49 associated to a risk measure @xmath35 is the estimator obtained by applying @xmath35 to the empirical p@xmath2l distribution , @xmath58 , defined by @xmath59 with @xmath60 , that is : @xmath61 let us denote with @xmath62 the lvy metric , such that for any two distributions @xmath63 we have @xmath64 hereafter , we recall the definition of @xmath65-robustness of a risk estimator as proposed by @xcite , where @xmath65 is a subset of distributions .",

    ", @xcite obtained the following result :    @xcite if a risk measure @xmath35 is continuous in @xmath65 respect to the lvy metric , then the historical estimator , @xmath49 is @xmath65-robust at any @xmath76 .",

    "substantially , when the quantile of the true p@xmath2l distribution is unique , then the empirical quantile is robust .",
    "in addition , they showed that the historical estimator of @xmath81 is not robust .",
    "more important , they pointed out a conflict between convexity ( on random variables ) and robustness : any time the convexity property is required on distribution - based risk measures , its historical estimator fails to be robust .",
    "we use the result by @xcite in corollary [ contcorol ] to prove under which conditions the historical estimator of @xmath0 is robust .    in this section",
    "we assume that @xmath82 $ ] is a continuous function .",

    "after the recent financial crisis , the @xcite has suggested that banks should abandon @xmath1 in favour of the @xmath46 as a standard tool for risk management since @xmath46 is able to overcome two main shortcomings of @xmath1 : lack of convexity on random variables and insensitivity with respect to tail behaviour .",

    "in addition , verifying the consistency property for @xmath46 is more problematic .",
    "moreover , a recent study by @xcite pointed out that not all the aspects of @xmath46 are well understood .",
    "for instance , for positions with a high probability of losses but also high expected gains in the tails , @xmath46 does not necessarily perform better than @xmath1 from a liability holders perspective .",
    "other risk measures which consider the magnitude of losses beyond @xmath46 are the expectiles , recently studied by @xcite .    in any case , the issue of capturing tail risk remains crucial and can not be accomplished through @xmath1 .",
    "the new risk measure , @xmath0 , may solve this issue since it is able to discriminate the risk among distributions with the same quantile but different tail behaviour and shares with @xmath1 other important properties such as quasi - convexity . on the other hand",
    ", @xmath0 lacks subadditivity and the flexibility introduced by the @xmath9 function requires additional criteria for determining its upper and lower bound .",
