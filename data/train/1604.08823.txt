    "computerization is considered to be one of the biggest socio - economic challenges .",
    "what is the foundation of the recent worries about many jobs being affected by automation  @xcite ?    why did the last few years see dramatic technological progress regarding self - driving cars  @xcite , board games  @xcite , automatic language translation  @xcite , or face recognition  @xcite ?",
    "one reason is big data .",
    "while `` intelligent algorithms '' in the past were restricted to learning from data sets with a few thousand examples , we now have exabytes of data .",
    "learning becomes even more powerful if you combine big data with a highly parallel hardware , stirred by the success of graphics processing units ( gpus ) .",
    "however , both of these technological advancements needed to be harvested , and they are with the advent of so - called deep learning algorithms , which have blown the competition away , starting with voice recognition  @xcite . as a consumer , you can already witness some of these advancements on your smartphone , but a lot more is to come soon .",
    "we believe that these advancements will revolutionize white collar work and ( with a little help from sensors and robotics ) also blue collar work .",
    "in contrast to previous waves of innovation , this time new emerging jobs might not be able to compensate jobs endangered by the new technology .    in their seminal paper , frey and osborne  @xcite quantitatively study job automation , predicting that 47% of us employment is at risk of automation . in order to calculate this number , frey and osborne labeled 70 of the 702 jobs from the o*net online job database manually as either `` automatable '' or `` not automatable '' .",
    "then , for the remainder of the jobs in the o*net database , they computed the automation probability as a function of the distance to the labeled jobs .",
    "but the results of frey and osborne are opaque , one either believes their `` magic '' computerization percentages , or one has doubts .",
    "we want anybody to be able to easily understand and argue about our results , by incorporating the unique tasks of each job .",
    "this additional depth will help laymen as well as job experts to argue about potential flaws in our methodology .    if we know that a job is 100% automatable , we also know that every task of that job must be completely automatable .",
    "but what if a job is 87% automatable ? is every task 87% automatable ? or are 87% of the tasks completely automatable , and 13% not at all ?",
    "we want to forecast which tasks of a job are safe and which tasks are automatable .    in order to calculate the automation probability for a task , we first need to determine its share of a job ( section  [ sec : share ] ) .",
    "based on this , we are able to assign each task a probability to be automated such that the weighted average of the probabilities is equal to the probability of the corresponding job ( section  [ sec : taskprobs ] ) . during our evaluation ( section  [ sec : eval ] ) , we discover a few suspicious results in the probabilities by frey and osborne , e.g. , a surprisingly high automation probability of 96% for the job _ compensation and benefits managers_. we conclude our paper by analyzing the correlation between various properties of a job and its probability to be automated ( section  [ sec : further ] ) .",
    "e.g. , we show that there is a strong negative correlation between the level of education required for a job and its probability to be automated .",
    "our complete results can be found at http://jobs-study.ethz.ch .",
    "the current effects of automation have been studied intensively in economics .",
    "most studies agree that some routine tasks have already fallen victim to automation  @xcite .",
    "a task is routine if `` it can be accomplished by machines following explicit programmed rules ''  @xcite . with computers being able to do routine tasks ,",
    "the demand for human labor performing these tasks has decreased .",
    "but on the other hand , the demand for college educated labor has increased over the last decades  @xcite .",
    "the effect is more pronounced in industries that are computer - intensive  @xcite . as a consequence of this",
    ", the employment share of the highest skill quartile has increased .",
    "in addition to more people being employed in the highest skill quartile , the real wage for this quartile has increased faster than the average real wage .",
    "service occupations , which are non - routine , but also not well paid , have also seen an increase in employment share and in real hourly wage .",
    "thus , both , employment share and real wage , are u - shaped with respect to the skill level  @xcite .",
    "this employment pattern is a phenomenon that is called polarization .",
    "this is not unique to the us , but can also be observed , e.g. , in the uk  @xcite .",
    "these papers make important observations about the effects that automation already has . until now , routine tasks are the ones most affected , but more and more tasks can nowadays be performed by a computer .",
    "we focus on the future and try to predict which tasks will be automated next .",
    "john keynes predicted already in 1933 that there will be widespread technological unemployment `` due to the means of economising the use of labour outrunning the pace at which we can find new uses for labour ''  @xcite .",
    "automation might be the technology , where this becomes true  @xcite .",
    "`` automation of knowledge work '' , `` advanced robotics '' , and `` autonomous and near - autonomous vehicles '' are considered to be 3 out of 12 potentially economically disruptive technologies  @xcite . computer labor and human labor may no longer be complements , but competitors .",
    "automation might be the cause for the current stagnation  @xcite . there might be too much technological progress , which causes high unemployment .",
    "a trend that could be going on for years , but was hidden by the housing boom  @xcite .",
    "the seminal paper by frey and osborne is the first to make quantitative claims about the future of jobs  @xcite .",
    "together with 70 machine learning experts , frey and osborne first manually labeled 70 out of 702 jobs from the o*net database as either `` automatable '' or `` non automatable '' .",
    "this labeling was , as the authors admit , a subjective assignment based on `` eye balling '' the job descriptions from o*net .",
    "labels were only assigned to jobs where the whole job was considered to be ( non ) automatable , and to jobs where the participants of the workshop were most confident . to calculate the probability for non - labeled jobs , frey and osborne used a probabilistic classification algorithm .",
    "they chose 9 properties from o*net as features for their classifier , namely `` finger dexterity '' , `` manual dexterity '' , `` cramped work space , awkward positions '' , `` originality '' , `` fine arts '' , `` social perceptiveness '' , `` negotiation '' , `` persuasion '' , and `` assisting and caring for others '' . the results from frey and osborne for the us job market were adopted to other countries , e.g. , finland , norway , and germany  @xcite .",
    "this was done by matching each job from o*net to the locally used standardized name . due to differences in the economies",
    ", a different percentage of people will be affected by this change , e.g. , only one third in finland and norway are at risk compared to 47% in the us .",
    "we are given a set of jobs @xmath0 .",
    "each job @xmath1 consists of a set of tasks @xmath2 , where every task belongs to exactly one job .",
    "we call two tasks @xmath3 and @xmath4 related if and only if these tasks are similar according to o*net .",
    "two jobs with related tasks are also called related .",
    "an example with 3 jobs is depicted in figure  [ fig : model ] .     from job @xmath5 and task",
    "@xmath6 from job @xmath7 are related as indicated by the line connecting them .",
    "note that this relationship is not transitive .",
    "thus , tasks @xmath8 and @xmath9 do not need to be related . ]",
    "o*net provides us for each task @xmath3 with the information how often it is performed .",
    "this information was gathered by asking job incumbents and occupational experts .",
    "the options are `` yearly or less '' , `` more than yearly '' , `` more than monthly '' , `` more than weekly '' , `` daily '' , `` several times daily '' , and `` hourly or more '' .",
    "o*net provides a percentage for each of the 7 options .",
    "we denote these frequencies of task @xmath3 with @xmath10 . since these values are percentages , for every task @xmath3 they sum up to 100% , i.e. , @xmath11 .",
    "each job @xmath1 has a given probability @xmath12 to be automated .",
    "we want to use @xmath12 to calculate a probability to be automated for each task of this job .",
    "we use the frequencies with which a task is performed to assign each task @xmath3 its share @xmath13 . for every task @xmath3 ,",
    "the share denotes how much time is spent doing this task , such that @xmath14 .",
    "the frequency values from o*net do not fulfill this property ; their values are very consistent for one job , but they can vary a lot between different jobs and might even seem to contradict each other .",
    "an extreme example can be seen in figure  [ fig : taskfrequencies ] .",
    "the seven frequency options provided by o*net are on the @xmath15-axis and on the @xmath16-axis is the corresponding value of each option .    to make use of the high consistency within a job",
    ", we decided that the share of a task is a weighted average of its frequencies , i.e. , @xmath17 .",
    "we want to calculate the job specific coefficients @xmath18 .",
    "let us illustrate these coefficients with a simple example .",
    "if @xmath19 , then a task @xmath3 that is done exclusively `` hourly or more '' ( i.e. , @xmath20 ) makes up 10% of job @xmath1 .",
    "we want these coefficients to satisfy a few assumptions .",
    "if o*net states that a task is done `` hourly or more '' , then the share of this task should be higher than the share of a task that is done `` several times daily '' .",
    "this translates to @xmath21 @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "these constraints neither use that jobs are related nor do they define the coefficients uniquely . both issues are solved if we require the coefficients @xmath18 and @xmath24 for two related jobs @xmath25 and @xmath26 to be similar .",
    "the intuition behind this is that the frequencies of o*net for related jobs are not independent of each other either , but rather should be similar as well .",
    "occupational experts who have rated the frequency in which a task is done for one job , are likely to have rated the frequencies of related jobs .    the coefficients can not be identical without violating the other constraints .",
    "jobs have a different number of tasks and the frequencies are task specific .",
    "the example in figure  [ fig : taskfrequencies ] highlights this .",
    "it is therefore easy to see that we can not have the same coefficients for two related jobs and fulfill the equality @xmath14 for both jobs simply because the number of tasks can differ a lot .",
    "thus , we allow a bit of slack in the coefficients of related jobs .",
    "we use the variable @xmath27 to express the difference between the coefficients @xmath18 and @xmath24 for two related jobs @xmath28 .",
    "formally , we define it as @xmath29 .",
    "this yields the following linear program , which minimizes the overall slack :    @xmath30    we set @xmath31 to 0.01 .",
    "the resulting lp has 169,372 variables in its objective function .",
    "since there are @xmath32 jobs , this means that a job is related to approximately @xmath33 other jobs on average .",
    "the value of the objective function is @xmath34 , i.e. , for two related jobs the coefficients differ only by @xmath35 on average . for comparison , the average value of a coefficient is @xmath36 .",
    "our complete results can be found online at http://jobs-study.ethz.ch .",
    "knowing the shares of the tasks enables us to set up a linear program that calculates for each task the probability to be automated .",
    "we want that the weighted average of the automation probabilities @xmath37 of the tasks of a job @xmath1 can explain the automation probability @xmath12 of the job , i.e. , @xmath38 .",
    "furthermore , we want to assign related tasks similar automation probabilities . to do this",
    ", we define a variable @xmath39 for each pair of related tasks @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "it denotes the probability difference that we assign to the two tasks .",
    "formally , it is defined as @xmath40 .",
    "we want to minimize the sum of these variables , i.e. , the sum of the probability difference of all related tasks .",
    "combining these requirements with necessary conditions to have meaningful probabilities , i.e. , @xmath41 , yields the following linear program :    @xmath42    we set @xmath31 to @xmath43 .",
    "we now analyze the results of the linear program as described above .",
    "later on , we will look at a small refinement to automatically detect outliers in our results .",
    "the linear program as described in section  [ sec : jobtotasks ] has 105,748 variables in its objective function and it has a minimal value of 9,846 .",
    "this means that two related tasks differ , on average , with regard to their probability by @xmath44 .",
    "the complete results can be found online at http://jobs-study.ethz.ch .",
    "the histogram of the probability difference between two related tasks is shown in figure  [ fig : taskdiffdistribution ] .",
    "a majority of related tasks is assigned a similar probability .",
    "a small fraction of related tasks is assigned diametrically opposed probabilities , which seems startling .",
    "it can be reconciled by considering that neither the classification by frey and osborne nor the classification of tasks being related by o*net are perfect .",
    "one example that highlights this are the two jobs _ computer programmer _ and _ software developers , applications_. these two jobs have many related tasks , but the probabilities of these jobs differ a lot ( 4% for _ software developers , applications _ , 48% for _ computer programmers",
    ". hence , the diametrically opposed probabilities are necessary to meet the constraints of the linear program .    in the following , we present a few selected jobs to illustrate our results .",
    "the first example is _",
    "chemists_. this job has an automation probability of 10% according to frey and osborne .",
    "only one task has , according to our linear program , a high probability of being automated : `` induce changes in composition of substances by introducing heat , light , energy , or chemical catalysts for quantitative or qualitative analysis . ''",
    "other simple mechanical tasks have been assigned low automation probabilities .",
    "we will revisit this job in section  [ sec : eval ] .",
    "next up : _ judges_. their automation probability is 40% .",
    "the tasks , their probabilities , and their shares are shown in table  [ tab : judges ] .",
    "the tasks that can be automated can be grouped in two sets : preliminary hearings which includes making first assessments , and ensuring that the procedures in court are followed .",
    "the tasks that involve sentencing ( or the preparation thereof ) have been assigned low automation probabilities .",

    "0 & 8.5        figure  [ fig : taskdistribution ] shows the histogram of the probabilities from our linear program .",
    "the probabilities for most tasks are either very high or very low and only a few tasks have a probability in - between .",
    "this desired side effect of our linear program helps us to achieve our goal of allowing job experts ( and laymen ) to argue about the validity of our results .",
    "we invite the reader to have a look at other jobs at http://jobs-study.ethz.ch .      to evaluate our approach and",
    "check for outliers , we use a variant of cross - validation . for every job @xmath1",
    ", we create a linear program without job @xmath1 .",
    "this yields a probability @xmath45 for every task but the tasks from @xmath1 .",
    "afterward , we calculate the new probability @xmath46 that job @xmath1 can be automated .",
    "we do this by setting the probability @xmath47 of each task @xmath3 to the average of all tasks that are related to it .",
    "we denote the set of related tasks by @xmath48 .",
    "formally , we set @xmath49 .",
    "we first compare @xmath47 with @xmath50 .",

    "for all tasks .",

    "the values are sharply distributed around 0 . ]    by combining the new probability of each task with its share , we can calculate the new probability of job @xmath1 by using a weighted average .",
    "this allows us to compare @xmath46 with @xmath12 .",
    "we have plotted this difference , i.e. , @xmath54 , in figure  [ fig : probhist ] .",
    "we can see that the difference is centered around 0% ; with the average absolute difference being less than @xmath52 .",
    "for more than half of the jobs our probability differs by less than 20% from frey and osborne  @xcite .",
    "most interesting are the jobs whose probability differs significantly .",
    "we now have a look at a few of them .",
    "there are jobs where our probability is more than 80% smaller than the one by frey and osborne .",
    "one job is _ compensation and benefits managers_. we assigned it a probability @xmath55 to be automated of @xmath56 ; compared to @xmath57 by frey and osborne .",

    "the tasks of this job are shown in table  [ tab : compman ] .",
    "if we manually compare them to related tasks , we conclude that they do not seem to be automatable in the next few decades .",

    "& 0 & 0 confer with scientists or engineers to conduct analyses of research projects , interpret test results , or develop nonstandard tests . & 0 & 0.02    the changes in the automation probability of the tasks of _ judges _ are much smaller .",
    "most tasks have a similar automation probability as before and the overall probability of this job has changed marginally , i.e. , increased only from 40% to 50% . therefore , we are confident that the classification by frey and osborne is correct .    we conclude that our approach can also be used to detect outliers in the results of frey and osborne .",
    "we can then manually inspect the automation probabilities of the tasks of such an outlier to determine the truth .",
    "we think our results allow us to fine tune the results from frey and osborne , but not replace it , as we need their results to bootstrap our linear program .",
    "in addition to inspecting every task of every job , we consider a broader picture .",
    "we do this by looking at general properties of a job that correlate with the probability that it can be automated .      ]",
    "we first analyze the share of a task .",
    "the higher the share , the more often a task is performed .",
    "hence , from a machine learning perspective this means that much more training data is available .",
    "this might lead to the conclusion that such a task is easier to automate . to disprove this claim , we plotted the share of a task over the probability that a task can be automated according to our linear program .",
    "the resulting graph is shown in figure  [ fig : ftimoverprob ] .",
    "every dot represents one task , with its share on the @xmath15-axis and its probability on the @xmath16-axis .",
    "we see that there is barely any correlation between these two .",
    "we conclude that tasks that are done more frequently are not more likely to be automated .",
    "we continue our analysis by looking at the correlation between the properties that a job has , e.g. , what kind of degree is necessary to do a job , and the probability that this job can be automated .",
    "correlation does not imply causation , but nevertheless , these results reveal some interesting nuggets .",
    "( not at all automated ) to @xmath59 ( completely automated ) .",
    "the rather small correlation of @xmath60 implies that different jobs will soon be affected .",
    "[ fig : scatterdegreeemail ] ]    o*net provides the level that the ability `` deductive reasoning '' is used in a job .",
    "the level ranges from @xmath61 to @xmath62 , where for example level 2 means `` knowing that a stalled car can coast downhill '' and level 5 `` deciding what factors to consider in selecting stocks '' .",
    "for every job , we have one value between @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "the resulting graph can be seen in figure  [ fig : scattercorr ] . every job is represented by one dot ; its @xmath15-coordinate being its level and the @xmath16-coordinate its probability .",
    "we can see that jobs that require a high level of deductive reasoning tend to have a lower probability of being automated .",
    "a similar result can be seen for `` originality '' ( see figure  [ fig : scattercorr ] ) .",
    "level 2 of `` originality '' means `` using a credit card to open a locked door '' and level 6 means `` inventing a new type of man - made fiber '' .",
    "this confirms our expectation that these abilities will remain difficult for a computer .",
    "o*net even has an explicit value for the current level of the `` degree of automation '' for each job .",
    "this level ranges from @xmath61 ( not at all automated ) to @xmath59 ( completely automated ) .",
    "as depicted in figure  [ fig : scatterdegreeemail ] , the already existing level of automation barely correlates with the probability that this job will be automated .",
    "this indicates that not only jobs that are already affected by automation are in danger , but also a whole new set of jobs .",
    "this is aligned with the recent worries about many new jobs soon being affected by computerization .",
    "we conclude this section by looking at the effect that the level of required education for a job has on the probability to be automated .",
    "jobs that require only very little education ( level 1 , i.e. , less than a high school diploma ) tend to have a higher probability than jobs that require an associate degree ( level 5 ) which in turn have a higher probability than jobs that require post - doctoral training ( level 12 ) .",
    "most jobs that require little education are in danger .",

    "<S> in their seminal paper , frey and osborne quantified the automation of jobs , by assigning each job in the o*net database a probability to be automated . in this paper , we refine their results in the following way : every o*net job consists of a set of tasks , and these tasks can be related . </S>",
    "<S> we use a linear program to assign probabilities to tasks , such that related tasks have a similar probability and the tasks can explain the computerization probability of a job . analyzing jobs on the level of tasks helps comprehending the results , as experts as well as laymen can more easily criticize and refine what parts of a job are susceptible to computerization . </S>"
