    "schematically , a bosonic josephson junction consists of an ultracold atomic cloud in which ( i ) idealized atoms can populate only two single - particle modes , or levels ( ii ) atoms can hop independently from one level to the other , and ( iii ) atoms interact with each other only locally ( through contact - like atom - atom interactions ) .",
    "the main differences between existing experimental realizations stem from the nature of the two levels . in  external \" josephson junctions ,",
    "the two levels are spatially separated modes  @xcite , whereas in `` internal '' josephson junctions , the levels are spin degrees of freedom internal to the atoms  @xcite ; see the recent ref .",

    "the second term accounts for the interaction between the atoms .",
    "this many - body hamiltonian can also be regarded as a particular case of the lipkin - meshkov - glick model  @xcite .",
    "experiments confirm the ability of this hamiltonian to describe the ground state of bjj and to predict dynamics  @xcite .    in these experiments",
    "one exercises some control over the three main parameters of @xmath9 : the atom number @xmath0 , the linear coupling @xmath8 and the atom - atom interaction strength @xmath10 .",
    "the strength of the atom - atom interaction is measured by the dimensionless parameter  =   .",
    "there is an interesting quantum phase transition at @xmath11 , beyond which the attractive atom - atom interactions cause a bifurcation in the ground state properties of the system in the semiclassical limit  @xcite .",

    "@xcite the convergence of the finite temperature equilibrium ensembles to the mixture of coherent states was proved only in the following , rather limited , sense : that the expected values of @xmath26-particle observables , with @xmath26 remaining finite as @xmath17 , converge to the expectations with respect to the mixture  ( [ unnormalized ] ) of coherent states .",
