    "holographic methods have proved to be enormously useful to gain intuition about certain physical questions at strong coupling @xcite . however , in most applications , attention has focused on cases where the bulk gravitational dual is two derivative . in the ads",
    "/ cft dictionary , this corresponds to infinite t hooft coupling and an infinite number of colours . in order to make possible contact with the real world",
    ", one needs to consider effects due to finite t hooft coupling and a finite number of colours . in",
    "the best studied example corresponding to the @xmath3 su(n ) supersymmetric yang - mills with the gravitational dual being type iib superstring theory on ads@xmath4 s@xmath5 , finite coupling corrections correspond to specific higher derivative corrections in the low energy effective action of string theory .",
    "in addition to these corrections , there are also non - local contributions , for example from graviton loops .",
    "one essential step to take into account the contributions at finite coupling , is to be able to compute the holographic stress tensor and its correlation functions for an arbitrary higher derivative theory of gravity .",
    "calculating the holographic stress tensor itself from first principles @xcite appears to be prohibitively difficult except for certain cases where the generalized gibbons - hawking term and the counterterms are known .",
    "since the generalized gibbons - hawking term is not known for an arbitrary higher curvature theory , this stymies any progress using conventional approaches  only some sporadic results for specific examples are known in the literature @xcite .",
    "recently , a way around has been found using the first law of entanglement pertaining to spherical entangling surfaces @xcite .",
    "the way this works is as follows : the first law of entanglement states that @xcite [ 1stlaw ] s= h , where for two density matrices @xmath6 with @xmath7 being the reduced density matrix for a spherical entangling surface in a cft with @xmath8 being the modular hamiltonian , @xmath9 and @xmath10 with @xmath11 being the von neumann entropy for @xmath12 and is the entanglement entropy for a reduced density matrix @xmath12 .",
    "the equality arises at linear order in perturbation , meaning that @xmath13 belong to some family of density matrices @xmath14 parametrized by some perturbation parameter @xmath15 such that @xmath16 and we are interested only in linear order in @xmath15 . at nonlinear order in @xmath15",
    "we get an inequality which corresponds to the positivity of relative entropy , leading to @xmath17 .",
    "the expression for @xmath8 ( which will be given below ) involves the time - time component of the field theory stress tensor . in holography , for spherical entangling surface , the entanglement entropy for the vacuum state across the sphere",
    "@xmath18 gets mapped to the thermal entropy on @xmath19 . using the gravitational dual ,",
    "the thermal entropy is computed using the wald entropy which is known for an arbitrary higher derivative theory of gravity . for bifurcate killing horizons ,",
    "there is a theorem due to iyer and wald @xcite which states that linearized perturbations satisfy the first law of thermodynamics which translated to our case means that eq.([1stlaw ] ) would be applicable with linearized perturbations in the wald formula .",
    "thus the lhs of eq.([1stlaw ] ) can be computed using the linearization of the wald formula .",
    "the rhs of eq.([1stlaw ] ) has the perturbation of the time - time component of the field theory stress tensor which now can be determined . in order to be able to do the integral",
    ", one approximates the entangling surface radius @xmath20 to be small .",
    "since the only dimensionless parameter is @xmath21 , the perturbative expansion can be done either by treating @xmath20 to be small or by treating @xmath22 to be small .",
    "thus although the expression for the stress tensor obtained using the above logic pertains to an excited state that is a small perturbation from the vacuum state , the expression should hold for any @xmath22 . since this can be done for an arbitrary higher derivative theory , we thus know how to compute the holographic stress tensor for such a bulk dual .",
    "the result of this calculation is a very compact expression for the stress tensor in terms of certain parameters appearing in the linearized expression of the wald formula .",
    "in particular , if one ignores covariant derivatives of the curvature tensor , the result can be worked out quite simply . writing the linearized wald functional as [ eq2 ] e^abcd_r =- c_2 g^abg^cdh - c_3 h^abg^cd+ c_4 g^abg^cd+ c_5 ^abg^cd+ c_6 ^abcd , where @xmath23 and @xmath24 are not independent coefficients but related to the other coefficients as , c_2=-2d c_4-c_5",

    "the normalization of @xmath27 is fixed by holography where we demand that the definition of @xmath28 gives the correct universal terms .",

    "[ eq1 ] t _ = d ^d-3[c_1 + 2(d-2)c_6]h^(d ) _ , where @xmath31 appears in the fefferman - graham expansion of the asymptotic ads metric as [ fg ] ds^2=l^2+(g^(0)_+z^2 g^(2)_+z^d h^(d)_+)dx^dx^.    @xmath32 is the ads radius .",
    "this begs the question : what is this simple proportionality constant depending on @xmath33 s in ?",
    "since the linearized wald functional was involved in the derivation of this simple form , with hindsight we can anticipate that there are simplifications waiting to happen if we consider rewriting the lagrangian as a background field expansion around a suitable background .",
    "recently this background field method has been used to find simple expressions for trace anomalies in even dimensions @xcite .",
    "we will make a simple modification to this method so that the anomaly calculation can be carried out easily using mathematica .",
    "let us now explain why this method is useful in correlating with the results above as well as calculating higher point correlation functions .",
    "given a lagrangian @xmath34 , we are going to treat @xmath35 and @xmath36 as independent variables .",
    "we are going to expand @xmath36 around @xmath37 where @xmath35 in this expression is the full metric . raising and lowering indices and the covariant derivative",
    "is done using the full metric .",
    "define @xmath38 . then on the ads background @xmath39",
    "this quantity is zero .",
    "further if we linearize this then in the transverse traceless gauge , it can be easily checked that @xmath40 .",
    "this is the reason why the expressions we will compute for the stress tensor correlation functions will take on simple forms .",
    "let us start with @xmath41 , i.e. , no covariant derivatives ( we will set the ads radius @xmath42 from hereon and will reinstate it when needed ) .",
    "the lagrangian after doing the background field expansion takes the form [ lag ] = ( c_0+c_1r+ r^2 + r^ab r_ab+ r^abcdr_abcd+_i=1 ^ 8_i_i+ ) , where @xmath43 from lowest order equations of motion and @xmath44 .",

    "we are not using an explicit overall factor of @xmath45 with the action since all the coefficients in the action are assumed to implicitly have the factor . in order to compute @xmath46-point functions we expand the bulk action up to @xmath46th order in the perturbation .",
    "however , since @xmath47 , this means that we only need to retain up to @xmath48 terms in the lagrangian .",
    "thus , the background field expanded lagrangian is an expansion in terms of the correlation functions of the stress tensor .",
    "further simplifications happen .",
    "consider @xmath49 or @xmath50 .",
    "since the linearized @xmath51 and @xmath52 both vanish , these terms can only contribute to four - point functions onwards .",
    "thus we do not expect @xmath53 or @xmath54 in eq.([lag ] ) above to enter the one , two or three point functions .",
    "this is consistent with the absence of these coefficients in eq.([eq1 ] ) .",
    "moreover , this conclusion does not change on including covariant derivatives .",
    "let us now summarize our findings for the correlation functions that follow from the lagrangian in eq.([lag ] ) .",
    "the stress tensor two point function takes the form t_ab(x)t_cd(x)=_ab , cd(x - x ) , where _ ab , cd(x)=[i_ab(x)i_cd(x)+i_ad(x)i_bc(x)]-_ab_cd , and i_ab(x)=_ab-2 .",
    "the coefficient @xmath1 from the @xmath55 dimensional bulk lagrangian works out to be _",

    "we use the method of background field expansion to calculate the three point functions of stress tensor .",

    "this relation enables one to extract the 4d euler anomaly @xmath78 from the knowledge of two and three point functions . in six",
    "( and higher ) dimensions , there is no such relation ( in fact not even for a linear combination of the a - anomaly and the b - anomaly coefficients ) indicating the fact that a similar relation involving the euler anomaly coefficient will also involve higher point correlation functions .",
    "we can easily extend the above results to the @xmath79 case , i.e. , to the situation where there are at most two covariant derivatives of the curvature tensor in the action .",
    "first notice that since the linearized @xmath52 and @xmath51 both vanish , only terms like @xmath80 will contribute to the two and three point functions while only terms like @xmath81 will contribute to the three point functions .",
    "further , we will show that using the bianchi identities and integration by parts @xcite , the@xmath80 terms can be rewritten in terms of @xmath82 and @xmath83 , @xmath84 .",
    "since the last two terms do not contribute to two or three point functions , the result for the two point functions will involve a redefined @xmath85 .",
    "we will explicitly show that the result for the three point functions also follows a similar simple trend .    as an application for our methods",
    "we will compute the ratio of shear viscosity ( @xmath86 ) to entropy density ( @xmath87 ) for a general four derivative bulk dual , without assuming the coupling constants to be small ( for earlier related work see @xcite ) . then following @xcite",

    "these constraints were sufficient in the gauss - bonnet case @xcite to lead to @xmath91 .",
    "we will find that in the general four derivative case , we can tune the couplings so that these conditions are satisfied but @xmath2 is arbitrarily small .",
    "this is of course due to the fact that the underlying theory has non - unitary modes .",
    "we will also show that for the weyl - squared theory , the above constraints lead to @xmath92 while including weyl - cubed terms , the same constraints lead to @xmath93 . both these theories will have non - unitary modes supported near the horizon .",
    "it is interesting to note that there is still a bound on the ratio in such theories .",
