    "we developed a radiative - convective equilibrium model for young giant exoplanets .",
    "input parameters are the planet s surface gravity ( g ) , effective temperature ( teff ) and elemental composition . under the additional assumption of thermochemical equilibrium ,",
    "the model predicts the equilibrium temperature profile and mixing ratio profiles of the most important gases .",
    "opacity sources include the h@xmath1-he collision - induced absorption and molecular lines from h@xmath1o , co , ch@xmath2 , nh@xmath3 , vo , tio , na and k. line opacity is modeled using k - correlated coefficients pre - calculated over a fixed pressure - temperature grid . cloud absorption can be added above the expected condensation level ( e.g. iron or silicates ) with given scale height and optical depth at some reference wavelength .",
    "scattering is not included at the present stage .",
    "+ we compared the model predictions to measurements of planet @xmath0 pictoris b from ( * ? ? ?",
    "* bonnefoy  ( 2013 ) ) .",
    "we built a grid of models with : a teff range between 1000 and 2500 k a log@xmath4(g[cgs ] ) between 3 and 5 , solar system abundances of the elements ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* lodders 2010 ) ) and no cloud opacity . + for each model we selected the radius that minimizes the @xmath5 between the observed and calculated apparent magnitudes .",
    "we only kept models with a radius between 0.6 and 2 jupiter radius ( a realistic range derived from evolution models of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* mordasini  2012 ) ) .",
    "+ the best one ( cloud - free model ) is a planet with an effective temperature of 1700 k , a log@xmath4(g[cgs ] ) of 3 and a radius of @xmath6 @xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "this model clearly yields too much flux in the j and h bands ( fig .  1 ) .",
    "apparent flux of our model without ( doted line ) and with cloud opacity ( solid line ) , compared with measured apparent fluxes of @xmath0 pictoris b ( circles ) ]     + in a second step , we added absorption from iron and silicates clouds .",
    "we used a particle radius of 30 @xmath9 m and assumed the same particle column density for both clouds . for each cloud",
    "the opacity is distributed between the condensation level and the 0.1-mbar level with a particle scale height equal to the gas scale height .",
    "+ for teff = 1700 k and log@xmath4(g ) = 3 , using a particulate optical depth ( @xmath10 ) of 0.25 at 1.2 @xmath9 m allows us to obtain a @xmath5 of 7.5 for a radius of 1.43 @xmath7 .",
    "compared with the cloud free case , the flux in the j and h bands is lower and that in the ks , l , nb4.05 and m bands is higher . adding cloud opacity in the model is required to reproduce the data within uncertainties .",
    "in agreement with other models ( see references in ( * ? ? ? * bonnefoy  2013 ) ) we found that cloud opacity is needed to reproduce the observations of @xmath0 pictoris b. a model with teff = 1700 k , log@xmath4(g[cgs ] ) = 3 , and some cloud opacity agrees with observations within uncertainties , but other combinations of these parameters are probably possible .",
    "+ we plan to explore the parameter space ( teff , g , @xmath10 ) for cloudy models of @xmath0 pictoris b , to apply our model to planetary system hr8799 , to update methane opacity with the exomol data base ( http://www.exomol.com/ ) , to add nh@xmath3 opacity .",
    "+ this model will be used to analyze data from sphere after commissioning on the vlt in 2014 ."
