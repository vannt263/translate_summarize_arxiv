    "the study of massive binary systems in young clusters plays a key role in our understanding of how massive stars form .",
    "in addition to providing the binary fraction for massive stars , massive binary systems provide information about their formation environment in the form of quasi - preserved parameters such as eccentricity , separation , period , and angular momentum ( in the form of rotational velocities ; * ? ? ?",
    "in addition , an initial mass function ( imf ) composed of the secondary component masses can indicate whether the companions are randomly drawn from a @xcite ( or equivalent field star ) imf or not .",
    "this can tell us whether the binary systems may have randomly formed by way of gravitational capture after the formation process , or preferentially paired through a more complicated formation process such as competitive accretion @xcite .",

    "spectra were doppler corrected to the heliocentric frame and checked against the same radial velocity standards taken during the 2008 june observations at wiyn before comparison to previous datasets .",
    "in addition , we also cross - correlated the wiro - longslit spectra with a composite interstellar line spectrum to look for systematic relative radial velocity shifts .",
    "the interstellar line spectrum was created by extracting the interstellar lines present in the 2008 spectra of a36 , doppler shifting them to the same velocity and combining them .",

    "we repeated this method 10 times while varying the baseline region used to define the continuum each time .",
    "we then used the mean of each component s list of gaussian centers to compute the velocity . utilizing this method ,",
    "a number of factors contribute to the radial velocity uncertainty .",
    "these factors include , but are not limited to the errors associated with gaussian profile fitting , wavelength calibrations , emission present in the line cores , and lower signal - to - noise of the less - luminous component s spectral profiles ( especially while in a partially or wholly blended state ) .",
    "we estimated the contribution of the gaussian profile fitting uncertainty by adopting the rms of each component s list of gaussian centers . unfortunately",
    ", this only produces a lower limit on the uncertainty because the initial gaussian width estimates also affect the center measurements . for the total one - sigma uncertainties",
    ", we adopted these rms values combined in quadrature with the typical error in the wavelength calibration ( 1.4  for wiro and 2  for wiyn ) and the typical rms observed in the list of velocities obtained from the correlation with the interstellar line template . the total error given for each system",
    "reflects a lower limit as we can not characterize uncertainty contributions from emission present in the line cores ( e.g. , a36 ) or the lower snr of the secondary spectral features ( e.g. , a45 ) .",
    "we used the method outlined in @xcite to determine the orbital parameters of each system .",
    "we obtained an estimate of the orbital period through an idl program written by a. w. fullerton which makes use of the discrete fourier transform and clean deconvolution algorithm of @xcite .",
    "the strongest peaks in the power spectrum of each star were examined by folding the data at the corresponding period and inspecting the @xmath16 curve visually .",
    "orbital elements were then procured by using the best period as an initial estimate in the nonlinear , least - squares curve fitting program of @xcite .",
    "the best solutions were attained by manually varying the initial guesses of key orbital parameters until a minimum in the @xmath21 of the fit was found .",
    "weights for each point were assigned as the inverse of the 1@xmath22 @xmath16 error .    while it is not uncommon to quote orbital period errors to one ten thousandth of a day ( e.g. , @xcite ) , we performed two additional tests to evaluate the appropriateness of the orbital period uncertainties for each system . in the first test",
    ", we explored the confidence range for each orbital parameter by fitting the radial velocity data 1000 times , with the orbital parameters as free variables , while adding gaussian noise to the data .",
    "the noise added to each data point was characterized by the one - sigma uncertainty .",
    "we compared the resultant rms deviations to the single - fit error estimates for each orbital parameter .",
    "the result of this test suggested that the majority of the single - fit parameter uncertainties were reasonable , as the monte carlo test routinely produced similar uncertainties .",
    "the disadvantage to this test , however , is that we could not examine each fit to see if it was reasonable ( i.e. , whether the newly folded radial velocities had a reasonable rms ) .",
    "therefore , with the error in the period strictly in mind , we ran the orbital fitting procedure 50100 times while incrementing the period by the single - fit error estimate and monitored how the rms changed .",
    "the result of this test suggests that we , at most , underestimate the orbital period errors by a factor of 10 . with this in mind , the errors for the orbital period throughout this work have been increased by a factor of ten .",
    "the complete list of orbital elements for each binary system appears in table  [ orbparms.tab ] .",
    "listed within the table are the period in days ( _ p _ ) , eccentricity of the orbit ( _ e _ ) , longitude of periastron in degrees ( _ @xmath23 _ ) , systemic radial velocity ( _ @xmath24 _ ) , epoch of periastron ( _ @xmath25 _ ) , primary and secondary semi - amplitudes ( _ @xmath26 _ &  _ @xmath27 _ ) , adopted or calculated minimum primary and secondary masses in solar masses ( _ @xmath28 _ &  _ @xmath29 _ ) , primary and secondary mass functions in solar masses ( _ f(m)@xmath30 _ &  _ f(m)@xmath31 _ ) , spectral classifications from this survey ( _ s.c.@xmath30 _ & _ s.c.@xmath31 _ ) , the minimum primary and secondary semi - major axes in solar radii ( @xmath32sin  @xmath33 &  @xmath34sin  @xmath33 ) , and finally , the rms of the fits ( _ rms@xmath30 _ &  _ rms@xmath31 _ ) .",
    "systemic radial velocities are known to vary depending on which lines are used to measure the radial velocity .",
    "this is especially evident with massive stars and evolved stars where the stellar atmosphere velocity gradient may be higher ( see @xcite for examples with a few well - studied o binaries ) . to minimize such discrepancies ,",
    "radial velocities are normally averaged over many lines . in the case of mt145 , where we obtain radial velocities by cross correlation over many lines ,",
    "this is not an issue .",
    "however , in the case of the remaining 4 systems , we only have 12 lines ( @xmath20 5876 , 6678 or h@xmath15 ) available for radial velocity measurement in the majority of spectra .",
    "this places an added uncertainty on the systemic velocity and semi - amplitudes measured for a36 , a45 , schulte  73 , and mt372 . in the simplest case , these effects may cause a systematic blueshift to the systemic velocity ( such as the case with a non - eclipsing system with equal and symmetric stellar winds ) .",
    "eclipses , uneven stellar winds , and uneven surface temperatures complicate the matter , and these effects can affect the components unequally , producing systemic radial velocities that vary from primary to secondary .",
    "we see this effect in two of our systems , a45 and schulte  73 .",
    "the component orbital solutions produce two different systemic velocities . for both of these systems",
    ", we adopted the mean of the two values as the systemic velocity of the system for table  [ orbparms.tab ] .",
    "we observed mt145 a total of 54 times , including 6 at lick , 2 at keck , 12 at wiyn , and 34 at wiro . excluding two low - snr spectra from lick and one from wiro , a total of 51 spectra were of sufficient snr to obtain the solution for this o9iii star .",
    "the strongest signal in the cleaned power spectrum corresponds to a period of 25.12 days .",
    "an alias at 20 days is also present .",
    "however , the 20 day period produced a folded @xmath16 curve having a much larger rms than the 25.12  day period .",
    "the best - fitting orbital solution and @xmath16 curve for mt145 is shown in figure  [ mt145curve ] , corresponding to a period of @xmath35 days with an eccentricity of @xmath0 and solution @xmath36  . with this period ,",

    ", we examined the spectra taken while the system was near quadrature for evidence of line - doubling or asymmetries originating from the secondary . neither is present in any of the spectra .",
    "given snr ratios of up to 150:1 for these spectra , we would expect to see evidence of the secondary star s spectral features at velocity separations of @xmath41 if the component luminosity ratio is larger than @xmath42 .",

    "intrinsic , , , , , and hydrogen absorption are labeled .",
    "the composite spectrum is not an exact match to a36 ( note that  4089 is stronger than that of the primary ) .",
    "however , the mass ratio obtained from @xcite for a b0ib primary and b0iii secondary is @xmath69 and agrees with our calculated mass ratio of @xmath62 .",
    "an apparent weakening of the primary s lines between phases 0.218 and 0.609 , seen in panels 1 and 3 of the time series presented in figure  [ a36progress ] , at least partially explains the large residuals at these epochs and may originate from a struve - sahade effect @xcite .",
    "this apparent weakening also coincides with an absence of well - defined absorption profiles in h@xmath15 ( panel 2 of figure  [ a36progress ] ) between secondary and primary eclipse .",
    "these spectral phenomena coupled with the continuous variation of the light curve presented in @xcite associated with algol eclipsing systems , an oconnell effect ( which is generally associated with contact or near contact systems ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and a seemly close separation between components ( @xmath70sin@xmath71  ) , implies that a36 is either a contact or near - contact system . in the very least ,",

    ", a36 is likely either a runaway binary system or a background system masquerading as a member of cyg ob2 .",
    "@xcite found observational evidence for several runaway binary systems , but concluded that they are rare .",
    "these systems can be produced by an asymmetric supernova of one of the components ( producing an sb1 ) or by dynamic interactions within a dense cluster . with a stellar density of @xmath74  @xcite",

    "therefore , without a proper motion to trace its trajectory , or until a complete solution is computed for the photometric and spectroscopic solutions for this star , the status of a36 s membership will remain uncertain .",

    "an absence of the numerous additional metal lines , such as , , , and seen in evolved b stars suggests that neither component is very evolved and both are likely still dwarves .",
    "additionally , a double - lined system with a mass ratio of @xmath80 restricts the secondary component to within one or two temperature classes of the primary component .",
    "therefore , we adopt the classification of b0.5v for the primary and b2v ? b3v ? for the secondary component based on the aforementioned line strengths and mass ratio .",
    "is a45 a member of cyg  ob2 ?",
    "although a45 has the largest angular separation from the core of cyg ob2 , the systemic velocity agrees with the mean systemic velocity of cluster members and the system does show the same diffuse interstellar band features characteristic of cyg  ob2 stars .",
    "additionally , though the combined luminosity and temperature of the system disagrees slightly with its predicted placement on the h - r diagram presented for cyg  ob2 stars in figure  12 in @xcite , individual component luminosities and temperatures shift a45 s position down on the diagram and into better agreement with other cyg  ob2 members .",

    "for the 27 higher snr spectra , the initial period estimate from the cleaned power spectrum is @xmath1216.6  days with an alias at @xmath1266  days .",
    "we dismiss the alias on the basis that progression of the absorption lines from a blended to deblended state is observed over approximately 45 nights .",
    "the best orbital solutions yield a period of @xmath86  days for both components .",

    "this results in a mass ratio of @xmath8 and our first confirmed `` twin '' in the cluster .",
    "the resulting semi - major axes are @xmath48sin  @xmath94  and @xmath95sin  @xmath96",
    "( i.e. , a separation of @xmath70sin  @xmath97  ) , and the calculated systemic velocity is @xmath98  .",
    "@xcite classify this star as an o8v .",
    "the components each show spectral signatures indicative of a later o type star , namely moderate to weak and stronger absorption .",
    "the primary classification criteria for later o type stars is @xmath684542 : @xmath684387 and @xmath684200 : @xmath684144 @xcite .",
    "the @xmath684200 : @xmath684144 ratio ( also sensitive to luminosity class ) and a visual comparison with the 2001 september 8 spectrum from wiyn seen second from bottom in figure  [ threeplot ] agree best with an o8iii spectral type for both components .",
    "the schulte  73 spectrum has been smoothed to approximately the resolution of the @xcite digital atlas . however , without a separation of the spectral components ( e.g. , tomographic separation ) , there is uncertainty in this assessment .",
    "the components also closely match an o7iii and o9iii spectral type .",
    "the very weak @xmath684144 however , precludes a later temperature class .",
    "the o8iii ( hd36861 ) and o8iii composite spectrum is shown at the bottom of figure  [ threeplot ] .",
    "we also tried various combinations of an o8v , o8iii and o8ii .",
    "these did not fit the data as well and left larger residuals when subtracted from the schulte  73 spectrum .",
    "mt372 is a single - lined spectroscopic binary and an eclipsing system , likely of algol type , with a period of @xmath99  days . with a visual magnitude of nearly 15 , only 5 of our 21 spectroscopic observations of this b0v star",
    "are of sufficient snr for meaningful analysis . therefore , to assist in the period determination , we acquired the available photometric data for mt372 from the public data release of the northern sky variability survey @xcite , and ran it through our clean idl program to search for a period . while excluding points with errors greater than 0.2 magnitudes , we computed a period of @xmath100  days from the power spectrum . in the case",
    "that the light curve exhibits only a primary eclipse , the peak in the power spectrum corresponds to the real period of the system . in the case that the light curve exhibits both a primary and secondary eclipse , the peak corresponds to half the real period .",
    "we adopt the latter case because a period of 1.114  days produces an radial velocity orbital solution with an unacceptably large rms ( where the radial velocities are determined from the @xmath101 line in a similar manner to the sb2s ) .",
    "a period of @xmath102 produces the folded @xmath16 curve and solution shown in figure  [ mt372curve ] . in order to obtain this solution , we fixed the period and the eccentricity ( @xmath103 ) . allowing the period and/or eccentricity to vary did not produce a viable solution , and we did not expect it would because of the very small number of radial velocities to work with .",
    "although very noisy , this new period also produced a light curve with two eclipses ( primary and secondary ; seen in figure  [ mt372phot ] ) as opposed to the single primary eclipse present at a folding of 1.114  days .",
    "it should be noted , that the period of 1.114  days also produced a single eclipse that was asymmetric , suggesting that the time between primary and secondary eclipses and secondary and primary eclipses is not equal ( i.e. , the system seems to have a slight eccentricity ) .",
    "the orbital solution shown in figure  [ mt372curve ] , also produces a semi - amplitude of @xmath104  , and a semi - major axis of @xmath105 .",
    "as this system has little evidence for a double - lined nature , we stay with the previous spectral classification of this star , b0v .",
    "a small change in velocity width seems to be visible in @xmath101 in figure  [ mt372series ] ( panel 2 ) , but the snr of the spectra ( especially evident with the 5876 and 6678 lines shown in panels 1 &  3 of figure  [ mt372series ] ) makes it difficult to produce an accurate determination .",
    "the minimum secondary mass determined from the solution is @xmath106 , assuming a primary of @xmath107 @xcite .",
    "interpolating from @xcite and reasonably assuming that the secondary is also unevolved , this results in a minimum spectral class of b8v .",
    "however , a b8v is unlikely to be the companion spectral class as it has too low of an effective temperature to produce the light curve in figure  [ mt372phot ] . with a primary effective temperature of @xmath108",
    "k @xcite and a period of @xmath102  days , a b2v at a relatively high inclination ( @xmath1275 degrees ) would have the correct effective temperature and stellar radius to produce a light curve that resembles the one for mt372 .",
    "however , given a b2v companion and a mass ratio of @xmath109 , the computed semi - major axis at approximately 75  degrees is not large enough to fully separate the two components .",
    "this may be explained by returning to the possible velocity width variation present in the h@xmath15 lines .",
    "if indeed there is a small amount of blending of component profiles present , then fitting a single gaussian profile to the blended h@xmath15 line will systematically produce a smaller primary velocity amplitude and , in turn , smaller semi - amplitude and semi - major axis .",
    "we thus report the listed primary velocity semi - amplitude as a lower limit .",
    "in this work , the third part of our ongoing survey to determine the distribution of binary orbital parameters in the cyg ob2 association , we presented three new binary systems ( mt145 , schulte  73 , &  mt372 ) and confirmed the binary status of one massive binary candidate ( a45 ) .",
    "we also provided the first spectroscopic orbital solution to the eclipsing binary , a36 and a partial solution to the eclipsing , single - lined system , mt372 . while mt145 , schulte  73 , a45 , and mt372 are likely members of the cluster based on their systemic velocities ( deviating by only @xmath120.615  from the cluster mean of @xmath73  obtained in paper i and well within the association s radial velocity dispersion ) the status of a36 , with a systemic velocity of @xmath110  , remains uncertain .",
    "the system could be a runaway binary or a background object ( though both do not seem very probable ) .",
    "however , if we do include a36 , the current total for ob binaries in cyg ob2 is now 18 . of these",
    "18 , 14 have period and mass ratio estimates .",
    "in addition , with six partial spectroscopic solutions , eight full spectroscopic solutions , three partial photometric solutions , and four full photometric solutions , cyg ob2 is on a track to become the cluster with the highest number of ob binary solutions . at seven",
    "it currently ties ngc 6231 @xcite for the highest number of full o - star binary solutions .",
    "the locations of all 18 systems are shown in figure  [ binaries ] .",
    "no evidence of grouping is apparent .",
    "table  [ binaries ] lists several key parameters for all 18 systems , including the star designation , photometric and/or spectroscopic binary type ( _ type _ ) , spectral classifications ( _ s.c .",
    "_ ) , period ( _ p _ ) , mass ratio when available ( _ q _ ) , and literature references ( _ ref _ ) . with the exception of schulte  9 ( @xmath111  years ) , periods for all systems are less than 25.2  days , with a mean of 9.6  days .",
    "eleven systems have a period less than 5  days .",
    "the 17 systems with periods less than 25.2  days also appear to obey pik s law @xcite , which states that the distribution of @xmath11 is flat .",
    "to avoid histogram binning selection effects , we choose to show the normalized cumulative distribution of the logarithm of the periods ( open diamonds ) in figure  [ oepik ] .",
    "the flat relation of pik s law translates to a linear relation in a cumulative distribution . for comparison purposes",
    ", we also include the normalized cumulative distributions of o binaries in ngc 6231 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* solid triangles ) and the 54 ob binaries from the 9th spectroscopic binary catalog ( * ? ? ?",
    "* asterisks ) .",
    "all 3 cumulative distributions contain systems with periods less than 25.2  days and were normalized at a period of 8.9  days . to test the linearity of the cyg ob2 distribution",
    ", we computed its linear pearson correlation coefficient .",
    "the distribution yields a coefficient of @xmath112 ( where @xmath113 is a perfectly linear relation ) .",
    "the linearity is illustrated by the best fit line ( solid line ) in figure  [ oepik ] .",
    "the dashed line in the figure represents a perfect pik distribution ( i.e. , a perfectly flat distribution within the range of periods in cyg ob2 ) .",
    "a two sided kolmogorov - smirnov ( @xmath114 ) test between the pik and cyg  ob2 distributions gives a 38% probability that both were drawn from the same parent distribution .",
    "@xmath114 tests between cyg ob2 and ngc 6231 on the one hand and cyg ob2 and the 9th spectroscopic binary catalog ( @xmath115  days ) on the other , yield 91%  and 62%  probabilities of being drawn from the same parent distribution , respectively .",
    "interestingly , the cumulative distributions of cyg ob2 and ngc 6231 have a high correlation and are very similar in appearance , including an upturn near @xmath116 .",
    "one wonders if this upturn is a true deviation from a linear relation ( i.e. , a preference for periods around 5  days ) , just a coincidence related to small number statistics , or observational bias .",
    "though the latter case is a possible explanation for the upturn in ngc  6231 , we do not believe this is the case with cyg ob2 because several of the systems with periods around 5  days come from other programs with different observational cadences ( e.g. , mt421 and b17 ) .",
    "figure  [ pvse ] displays the relation between the orbital periods and eccentricities for eight of the systems in cyg ob2 ( open diamonds ) , six of the systems in ngc  6231 ( solid triangles ) and 66 of the systems in the 9th spectroscopic binary catalog ( asterisks ) .",
    "the eccentricities in cyg ob2 range from circular to moderately eccentric ( 0.291 ) , while the total distribution in figure  [ pvse ] has an eccentricity range of zero to @xmath120.75 for periods ranging from @xmath120.5  days to 100  days .",
    "systems with periods less than a few days tend toward more circular orbits , while systems with larger periods ( @xmath117  days ) display a full range of eccentricities .",
    "this agrees with previous studies such as @xcite .",
    "there is a paucity of highly eccentric systems longer than 30  days .",
    "this likely stems from an incompleteness of the surveys at longer periods and is not a true trend .",
    "the cyg ob2 star , a45 , falls on the high - eccentricity side of the shorter period systems with an eccentricity of 0.273 and a period of 2.884  days .",
    "it does not appear to be particularly close to the majority of ob stars in the cluster center ( see figure  [ binaries ] ) , and so dynamical interaction with a massive neighbor does not seem a likely source of its higher eccentricity ( unless it is a runaway system ) .",
    "it is possible that further observations of this system will constrain the eccentricity to a slightly more circular orbit , but its position in the figure is hardly removed from the rest , and therefore , its moderately elliptical orbit is not extraordinary . the remainder of cyg ob2 stars fall well within the remaining distribution .    with the exception of mt421 and mt429 , all the cyg ob2 systems have early - type companions and mass ratios widely ranging from @xmath118 ( mt258 ) to @xmath8 ( schulte  73 ) .",
    "one may see this as an indication that the companions are not randomly drawn from a @xcite or similar field star initial mass function ( imf ) .",
    "however , given that the current sample encompasses a number of systems that are double - lined spectroscopic binaries ( i.e. , they are easier to detect ) this assessment may be premature and biased .",
    "only time will tell , as we have a number of single - lined spectroscopic binary candidates still to investigate and a spectral database that has not been completely tapped .",
    "we continue to analyze these candidates with the long term goal of providing accurate distributions for binary orbital parameters of massive stars with an assumed shared formation history .",
    "we thank the time allocation committees of the lick , keck , wiyn , and wiro observatories for granting us observing time and making this project possible .",
    "we are also grateful for support from the national science foundation through research experience for undergraduates ( reu ) program grant ast 03 - 53760 and through grant ast 03 - 07778 , and the support of the wyoming nasa space grant consortium through grant nng05g165h .",
    "we would also like to graciously thank , in no particular order , christopher rodgers , emily may , megan bagley , michael dipompeo , michael alexander , jessie runnoe , and sabrina cales for their generous help in observing at wiro through good skies and bad , and jerry bucher and james weger for their ample help and upkeep of wiro facilities .",
