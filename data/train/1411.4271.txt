    "with the widespread use of smart - phones and tablets , the volume of global mobile traffic has increased explosively in recent years . the portion of multimedia data , such as mobile video and voice over ip ( voip ) , has surged significantly within this wireless traffic @xcite . in such multimedia traffic",
    ", delay is an important consideration .",
    "meanwhile , providing deterministic quality of service ( qos ) guarantees is challenging in wireless systems , since the instantaneous rate of the channel varies randomly depending on numerous factors , such as mobility , changing environment and multipath fading @xcite .",
    "therefore , providing statistical qos guarantees is more suitable in such randomly - varying wireless environment .",
    "effective bandwidth theory has been developed to analyze high - speed communication systems operating under statistical queueing constraints @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the queueing constraints are imposed on buffer violation probabilities and are specified by the qos exponent @xmath0 , which dictates the exponential decay rate of the queue length in the stable state .",
    "also , chang and zajic have characterized the effective bandwidths of time - varying departure processes in @xcite , which can be utilized to analyze the volatile wireless systems .",
    "moreover , wu and negi in @xcite defined the dual concept of effective capacity , which provides the maximum constant arrival rate that can be supported by a given departure process while satisfying statistical delay constraints .",
    "the analysis and application of effective capacity in various settings have attracted much interest recently ( see e.g. @xcite-@xcite and references therein ) . in this paper , we study the achievable rate of two - hop systems operating under statistical delay constraints . in particular , we assume that there are buffers at both the source and the relay nodes , and consider the queueing delay introduced by the buffers . note that @xcite-@xcite have also recently investigated the effective capacity of the relay channels .",
    "for instance , tang and zhang in @xcite analyzed the power allocation policies of relay networks , where the relay node is assumed to have no queue , i.e. , the packets arriving to the relay node are forwarded immediately . in @xcite ,",
    "_ considered the cooperation of two users for data transmission , where the interchanged data goes through only the queue of the other user .",
    "parag and chamberland in @xcite provided a queueing analysis of a butterfly network with constant rate for each link , while assuming that there is no congestion at the intermediate nodes .",
    "the effective capacity of the two - hop link in the presence of the statistical queueing constraints at the source and relay node is given in @xcite , and the performance for multi - relay links is analyzed in @xcite .    in this work , as a significant departure from previous works , we consider statistical end - to - end delay constraints , imposed as the limitations on the maximum delay and delay violation probability .",
    "note that statistical end - to - end delay analysis can also be found in @xcite-@xcite . in @xcite , wu and negi considered statistical end - to - end delay constraints for half - duplex relays , and gave an effective capacity formulation with time allocation to the different hops . in @xcite-@xcite , the authors considered the statistical end - to - end delay constraints of multi - hop links , while assuming that the statistical delay violation probability of the queues are equal .",
    "however , it is possible that the relay can tolerate more stringent delay constraints while not affecting the system performance @xcite . therefore , we seek to determine the optimal statistical qos exponents of the buffers under given _ end - to - end _ delay constraints .",
    "additionally , we note that the analysis of buffer - aided systems have attracted much interest recently ( see e.g. , @xcite-@xcite and reference therein ) . in such analysis",
    ", the authors considered the case that only the relay node has buffer , and the average queueing delay is investigated @xcite .",
    "the contributions can be summarized as follows :    1 .",
    "we characterize the tradeoff between the statistical delay constraints at the source and relay nodes , providing a framework for dynamically adjusting the delay constraints of any two interacting queues",
    ". 2 .   with the identified interplay",
    ", we then derive the effective capacity of the two - hop links under a target statistical end - to - end delay constraint by optimizing over the statistical queueing constraints at the queues of the source and relay nodes .",
    "we also describe a method for obtaining the effective capacity in such settings .",
    "additionally , we show that symmetric delay constraints at the two buffers do not always lead to the optimal performance .",
    "instead , asymmetric delay constraints , e.g. , when the delay constraint at one queue is more relaxed , can lead to larger achievable rates for the two - hop system , which we verify via numerical results .",
    "moreover , it is demonstrated that the improvement is affected by the statistical delay constraints , the signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) levels and the channel conditions of the links .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , the system model and necessary preliminaries are described . in section iii , we present the tradeoff between the statistical delay constraints of any two concatenated queues .",
    "we describe our main results for block - fading channels in section iv , with numerical results provided in section v. finally , in section vi , we conclude the paper .",
    "the two - hop communication link is depicted in figure [ fig : systemmodel ] . in this model ,",
    "source @xmath1 is sending information to the destination @xmath2 with the help of the intermediate relay node @xmath3 .",
    "we assume that there is no direct link between @xmath1 and @xmath2 ( which , for instance , holds , if these nodes are sufficiently far apart in distance ) .",
    "both the source and the intermediate relay nodes are equipped with buffers .",
    "hence , for the information flow of such links , the queueing delay experienced is given by @xmath4 , where @xmath5 and @xmath6 denote the stationary delay experienced in the queue at the source and relay node , respectively .",
    "we consider a full - duplex relay , and hence assume that reception and transmission can be performed simultaneously at the relay node .",
    "note that full - duplex relaying can be achieved through some form of analog self - interference cancellation followed by digital self - interference cancellation in the baseband domain @xcite , @xcite . in the @xmath7th symbol duration ,",
    "the signal @xmath8 received at the relay from the source and the signal @xmath9 received at the destination from the relay can be expressed as @xmath10&=g_1[i]x_1[i]+n_1[i ] , \\\\",

    "logarithm expressed without a base , i.e. , @xmath34 , refers to the natural logarithm @xmath35 .",
    "we need to guarantee that the statistical delay performance of the two - hop link is not worse than the statistical delay performance specified by @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is the limitation on the statistical delay violation probability , and @xmath38 is the maximum tolerable delay .",
    "note that the end - to - end delay consists of the queueing and transmission delays . as indicated in (",
    "* section iv ) , the flow of data bits are treated as the flow of a fluid in the theory of effective bandwidth , in which case the transmission delay can be negligible if @xmath39 .",
    "the end - to - end delay can be approximated by the queueing end - to - end delay @xcite , @xcite .",
    "assume that the first - in first - out ( fifo ) queues are saturated , and hence they always attempt to transmit @xcite .",
    "then , the queueing delay violation probability can be written equivalently as @xcite , @xcite    @xmath40    where we define @xmath41 when @xmath42 , and @xmath43 is the statistical delay exponent associated with the queue , with @xmath31 denoting the lmgf of the service rate , and @xmath44 is decided by the arrival and departure processes jointly .",
    "note that the larger @xmath45 , the smaller the delay violation probability is , implying more stringent delay constraints .",
