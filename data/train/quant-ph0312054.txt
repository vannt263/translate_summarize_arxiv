    "the ability of measuring quantum states is of fundamental interest because it provides a powerful tool for the analysis of basic concepts of quantum theory , such as the fundamentally statistical nature of its predictions , the superposition principle , bohr s complementarity principle , etc . to measure",
    "quantum state one needs to perform some projective measurements on the state and then to apply some computation procedure to the data .",
    "the first step is a genuine measurement consisting of a set of operations on the representatives of a quantum statistical ( pure or mixed ) ensemble . as a result of such operation",
    "an experimentalist acquires a set of frequencies at which particular events occur . in the second step a mathematical procedure",
    "is applied to the statistical data obtained in the previous step to reconstruct the quantum state .",
    "the present paper is devoted to the state reconstruction for the optical three - level systems .",
    "the object under study is the polarization state of a frequency- and spatially degenerate biphoton field  @xcite .",
    "the necessity of the adequate measurement of the states of such systems is caused not only by fundamental interest but also by some applications .",
    "for example , it has been shown that the security of the key distribution in quantum cryptography is associated with the dimensionality of the hilbert space for the states in use  @xcite . from this point of view",
    "certain hopes are pinned on the three - level systems or qutrits  @xcite rather than qubits .",
    "we should mention that there are other implementations of three - level optical systems .",
    "the most familiar ones deal with three - arm interferometers  @xcite and lower - order transverse spatial modes of optical field , realized with holograms  @xcite .",
    "polarization  entangled four - photon fields , which are equivalent to two entangled spin-1 particles were studied in  @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec.ii",
    "we discuss the main properties of qutrits based on the polarization state of biphoton field .",
    "we focus on their preparation , visual representation on poincar sphere , unitary transformation by phase plates .",
    "then we consider the coherence matrix , which characterizes completely the properties of biphotons - qutrits in the fourth field moments .",
    "sec.iii is devoted to the methods of biphotons - qutrits measurement , in particular , we introduce two quantum tomography protocols and discuss in detail their experimental implementation .",
    "we conclude this part with the analysis of statistical reconstruction for qutrits from the outcomes of mutually complementary measurements . sec .",
    "iv deals with the methods of quantum state reconstruction .",
    "namely we consider the least - squares and maximum - likelihood methods and apply these tools to analysis the data obtained in quantum tomography . in appendix",
    "we explore the problem of statistical fluctuations of the state vector which is important for the estimation and control of precision and stability of quantum information .",
    "biphoton field is a coherent mixture of two - photon fock states and the vacuum state  @xcite :    @xmath0 denotes the state with one ( signal ) photon in the mode @xmath1 and one ( idler ) photon in the mode @xmath2 .",
    "the coefficient @xmath3 is called the biphoton amplitude  @xcite , because its squared modulus gives a probability to register two photons in modes @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "let us consider the collinear and frequency degenerate regime , for which @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the laser pump frequency .",
    "we further restrict our discussion to biphotons that are indistinguishable in terms of spatial , spectral , or temporal parameters .",
    "from the point of view of polarization there are three natural states of biphotons , namely , @xmath8 , @xmath9 , and @xmath10 . here the notation @xmath11 , for example , indicates that there are two photons in the horizontal @xmath12 polarization mode , while no photons are present in the orthogonal vertical @xmath13 mode .",
    "these basic states can be generated using type - i ( for @xmath14 and @xmath15 ) and type - ii ( for @xmath16 ) phase matching . since",
    "only two - photon fock states are considered , for the state @xmath17 the condition @xmath18 must be satisfied .    any arbitrary pure polarization state of biphoton field can be expressed in terms of three complex amplitudes @xmath19 and @xmath20 :    @xmath21    where @xmath22 , @xmath23 .",
    "the vector @xmath24 represents a three - state state or qutrit .",
    "there is an important note concerning the state - vector ( 2 ) . in principle , one can write the complete polarization state in the form    @xmath25    where the terms @xmath26 and @xmath27 might be distinguishable somehow , for example , if the photon with vertical polarization comes first with respect to the photon with horizontal polarization .",
    "however we consider particular two - mode polarization state so photons differ in polarization only and there are no other parameters responsible for their distinguishability .    in general , to generate an arbitrary qutrit state one needs to put three nonlinear crystals separated in space into a common pump and superpose the biphoton fields generated by the three crystals coherently or incoherently ( fig.1 ) .     and three phase - shifters ( @xmath28 allow one to control three complex amplitudes @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31.,scaledwidth=30.0% ]      sometimes it is very convenient to use visual representation of the state . for example",
    "a single - photon pure polarization state ( qubit ) may be mapped onto the poincar sphere ( 3-dimensional euclidian sphere ) .",
    "a ( pure ) qubit state is determined by polar and azimuthal angles @xmath32 in spherical coordinates .",
    "any unitary polarization transformation of the qubit is represented by the corresponding rotation of the sphere .",
    "thus , in order to learn the final transformed state one just has to apply the rotation operation using certain rules",
    ".    it would be helpful to use same visual representation of a qutrit using the poincar sphere .",
    "although the generalization of the poincar sphere for qutrits has been discussed earlier  @xcite we suggest an alternative approach , which allows us to manipulate with qutrits in natural 3-d space rather than in sophisticated 8-d space .",
    "let us map the polarization state of a biphoton into a pair of points on the sphere ( but this is not the two - qubit case since the states@xmath33 and @xmath34 are indistinguishable ) . in this representation",
    "each photon forming the biphoton is plotted as a single point on the poincare sphere , so the qutrit state vector is represented by    @xmath35|vac\\rangle}{\\left|\\left| \\left[a_s^\\dag ( { \\vartheta , \\phi } ) a_i^\\dag ( { \\vartheta',\\phi'})+a_i^\\dag ( { \\vartheta , \\phi } ) a_s^\\dag ( { \\vartheta',\\phi'})\\right ] |vac\\rangle \\right|\\right|}\\ ] ]    where @xmath36 and @xmath37 are the creation operators in idler and signal polarization modes and @xmath38 .",
    "note that operators @xmath39 are creation operators for @xmath40 and @xmath41polarized photons .",
    "it is well - known that the number of real parameters characterizing a quantum state is determined by the dimension of the hilbert space @xmath42 . for a pure state ,",
    "@xmath43    and for mixed states , @xmath44    according to ( 5a , b ) , four real parameters determine completely the pure state of a qutrit , so in the poincar sphere representation these parameters are simply the four spherical angles @xmath45 . the links between the angles @xmath46 and the amplitudes @xmath47 are derived in  @xcite . as an example three basic states @xmath48 , @xmath49 , and @xmath10 are shown in fig.2 .",
    "it can be shown that the polarization degree of a qutrit @xmath50 between the pair of points on the poincare sphere as seen from its center :        @xmath51    for the states @xmath14 and @xmath52 the polarization degree takes values @xmath53 , since two points coincide on the sphere and @xmath54 . for the second state ,",
    "@xmath16 , two points are positioned at the opposite sides of the sphere , that is why @xmath55 and @xmath56 .      experimentally a unitary transformation of the polarization state ( 2 ) can be achieved by placing any retardation plates , rotators etc . into the biphoton beam .",
    "the action of such elements on the state ( 2 ) is described by the matrix  @xcite :    @xmath57    where @xmath58 @xmath59 is the optical thickness of the plate , @xmath60 is its geometrical thickness , @xmath61 is the orientation angle between the optical axis of the plate and one of the basis , for example , vertical direction .",
    "let us consider the action of the half - lambda plate on a particular state @xmath62 , when the plate is oriented at @xmath63 .",
    "for the state @xmath64 there are two nonzero amplitudes @xmath65 and there is only one relative phase @xmath66 . taking into account",
    "that for a half - lambda plate @xmath67 , the corresponding transmission and reflection coefficients are    @xmath68    thus the matrix @xmath69 has the form    @xmath70    hence , acting by matrix @xmath69 on the state @xmath71 we get @xmath72 note that such kind of transformations can not change the polarization degree of a qutrit . for the state @xmath64 chosen above , as well as for the state @xmath73 ,",
    "the polarization degree @xmath74 is zero .    in the experiment described below we used a simpler way to generate qutrits .",
    "biphotons were produced via collinear frequency - degenerate spontaneous parametric down conversion in a nonlinear crystal ( bbo , type - i or type - ii phase matching ) .",
    "for type - i phase matching the polarization of both created photons was vertical ; i.e. , the state @xmath52 was generated .",
    "then , this state was transformed using a quartz plate with a fixed optical thickness . by changing the angle of the plate",
    ", the state @xmath75 is transformed according to the formula @xmath76 .",
    "for the case of type - ii phase matching the final state is @xmath77 .",
    "of course the state @xmath78 does not involve all possible qutrit states because the transformation given by matrix ( 7 ) preserves the polarization degree .",
    "anyway using such a transformation , we select some subset of qutrits to work with .    such a simple method of the state preparation / transformation was chosen in order to be able to compare the results of reconstruction with the parameters of the input states , which should be known with a high accuracy .",
    "the purpose of this work is the reconstruction of the initial state @xmath79 .",
    "we would like to emphasize that only pure qutrit states are accessible by this method . to create a mixed state",
    ", some more complicated method is to be used .",
    "this method allows one to create arbitrary qutrit states and it implies a possibility to introduce controlled delay between three fundamental states forming the qutrit which could exceed the coherence length of the laser pump  @xcite .",
    "we introduced only qualitative description of the qutrits based on biphotons so far .",
    "the quantitative measure characterizing the polarization properties of any single - mode state in the forth moment in the field ( including biphoton state ) was proposed by d.klyshko in  @xcite .",
    "it is a matrix consisting of six fourth - order moments of the electromagnetic field .",
    "an ordered set of such moments can be obtained using the direct product of @xmath80-coherence matrixes for both qubits .",
    "after normal ordering , averaging , and crossing out the redundant row and column the matrix takes the following form :    @xmath81    the diagonal elements are formed by real moments , which characterize the intensity correlation in two polarization modes @xmath82 and @xmath83 :    @xmath84    nondiagonal moments are complex :    @xmath85    three real moments ( 12 ) and three complex ones ( 13 ) completely determine the state under consideration .",
    "the elements of the matrix ( 11 ) are expressed through the elements of the polarization density matrix .",
    "the normalization condition ,    @xmath86    reduces the number of independent real parameters , so for a mixed state we get 8 parameters as expected .",
    "in the special case of a pure biphoton state , taking the average in eqs .",
    "( 12,13 ) over the state ( 2 ) , we obtain the matrix components in the following form :    @xmath87    @xmath88    so the links between the polarization density matrix and the matrix ( 11 ) can be found comparing the corresponding components of @xmath89 and of @xmath90 ; @xmath91 for a pure state and @xmath92 for a mixed state where the averaging , as usual , is taken over the classical probability distribution .",
    "the statistics of the field is assumed to be stationary and ergodic so the time - averaged values of the observed quantities can be described in terms of a quantum statistical ensemble . in this case",
    "@xmath93 , where @xmath94 is the polarization density operator .",
    "what does it mean to measure the unknown state ( 2 ) ?",
    "from the experimental point of view , it means that the experimentalist has to measure a complete set of real parameters ( moments ) determining the state . to do this",
    "the state must be subject to a set of unitary polarization transformations and projective measurements . by doing",
    "this one picks out the outcomes , which are proportional to the corresponding moments ( 12 , 13 ) or their linear combination .",
    "this procedure is known as quantum tomography .",
    "the quantum state can be represented using either the wave function , density matrix , or quasi - probability function ( wigner function ) . probably the correct way to use the term `` quantum tomography '' is only for the reconstruction of the quasi - probability function because it gives the graphical representation of the state as a 3d plot .",
    "nevertheless the term `` quantum tomography '' is also used for a general procedure of complete state reconstruction . for a brief review among the papers where this procedure was realized experimentally ,",
    "let us mention the works  @xcite related to states defined by continuous variables . for states characterized by discrete variables , such as two polarization - spatial qubits ,",
    "quantum tomography was realized in  @xcite .",
    "recently quantum tomography has been performed for orbital angular momentum entangled qutrits  @xcite etc .    the physical idea behind the tomography procedure is performing measurements of appropriately complete set of observables called quorum  @xcite or just `` looking '' at the state from different positions",
    ". the minimal number of such positions might be the number of real parameters determining the state .    according to bohr s complementarity principle , it is impossible to measure all moments ( 12,13 ) simultaneously , operating with a single qutrit only .",
    "so to perform a complete set of measurements one needs to generate a lot of representatives of a quantum ensemble .",
    "first of all , let us mention that at present , the only realistic way to register single - mode biphoton field is using the brown - twiss scheme .",
    "this scheme consists of a beam - splitter followed by a pair of detectors connected with the coincidence circuit .",
    "it means that registration of a single biphoton , which carries the state ( 2 ) , can give only a single event at the output of the experimental set - up with some probability .",
    "so the statistical treatment of the outcomes becomes extremely important . for correlations between polarization degrees of freedom , which is essential in the case under consideration",
    ", the brown - twiss scheme must be accomplished with polarization filters introduced into each arm .",
    "we proposed two methods to perform polarization reconstruction of a biphoton qutrit state @xmath95 .",
    "the idea of the first method is splitting the state @xmath96 into two spatial modes and performing transformations over two photons independently ( fig 3 ) .",
    "these transformations can be done using polarization filters placed in front of detectors .",
    "each filter consists of a sequence of quarter- and half - wave plates and a polarization prism , which picks out definite linear polarization , for example , the vertical one .",
    "a narrowband filter centered at the doubled pump wavelength @xmath97 serves to make biphotons emitted from different sources indistinguishable in frequency as well as to reduce the background noise .",
    "an event is considered to be detected , if a pulse appears at the output of the coincidence circuit .",
    "approximately in half of trials , one of the photons ( signal , by convention ) forming a biphoton is going to one of the detectors , while the other one ( idler ) is going to the other detector . in the remaining cases ,",
    "both photons appear in the same output beam - splitter arm , and these events are not selected because they do not contribute to coincidences .     and idler @xmath98 photons propagate through the quarter- and half wave plates , polarizing prisms ( * v * ) , focusing lenses ( * f * ) and interference filters ( * if * ) in two channels .",
    "finally , photons are registered by detectors ( * d * ) . the coincidence rate from the output of the coincidence circuit ( * cc * ) is proportional to the fourth moment in the field @xmath99.,scaledwidth=40.0% ]    in the heisenberg representation the polarization transformation for each beam - splitter output port is given by : @xmath100 four @xmath101 matrixes in the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( 17 ) describe the action of the non - polarizing beam - splitter , @xmath102- , @xmath103- plates and vertical polarization prism on the state vector of the signal ( idler ) photon ;    @xmath104    where @xmath105 and @xmath106 - are the coefficients introduced in eq .",
    "( 8) , so for a @xmath102-plate ( @xmath107 ) ,    @xmath108    and for a @xmath103-plate ( @xmath109 )    @xmath110    thus , there are four real parameters ( two for each channel ) that determine polarization transformations .",
    "namely , these parameters are orientation angles for two pairs of wave plates : @xmath111    as it was mentioned above , the output of the brown - twiss scheme is the coincidence rate of the pulses coming from two detectors @xmath112 and @xmath113 .",
    "the corresponding moment of the fourth order in the field has the following structure :    @xmath114    in the most general case this moment contains a linear combination of six moments ( 12 , 13 ) forming the matrix @xmath115 .",
    "so the main purpose of the quantum tomography procedure is extracting these six moments from the set - up outcomes by varying the four parameters of the polarization brown - twiss scheme .",
    "consider some special examples , which give the corresponding lines in the complete protocol introduced below ( table i ) .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     first of all , it is obvious that for measuring real moments ( 12 ) one needs to make polarization filters transmit both photon with horizontal polarizations to measure @xmath116 , both photons with vertical polarization to measure @xmath117 and one photon with vertical and another one with horizontal polarizations to measure @xmath118 .",
    "to do this all quarter - wave plates should be oriented at zero degrees , then to install both half - wave plates at zero degrees for measuring @xmath117 ; at @xmath119 and @xmath120 for measuring @xmath116 ; and at @xmath121 , @xmath122 for measuring @xmath118 .",
    "these settings pick out the squared modulus of corresponding amplitudes @xmath123 , @xmath124 and @xmath125 .",
    "the next example shows how to measure one of the complex moments ( 13 ) . to measure the real part of the moment @xmath126 ,",
    "let us set the wave - plates in the brown - twiss scheme in the following way .",
    "the idler channel :    @xmath127    @xmath128    the signal channel :    @xmath129    @xmath130    substituting these matrices into eq .",
    "( 17 ) and taking into account the commutation rules for the creation and annihilation operators it is easy to get the final moment to be measured :    @xmath131    a complete set of the measurements called the tomography protocol is presented in table i. each row corresponds to the setting of the plates to measure the moment placed in the sixth column .",
    "the last one corresponds to the amplitude of the process ( see below ) .",
    "this protocol was suggested and developed in  @xcite .",
    "a similar protocol was considered in details earlier  @xcite for estimating polarization state of a biphoton field , generated in a frequency degenerate non - collinear mode . in this case",
    "the biphoton field is represented as a pair of polarization qubits .    before describing the second method of the state measurement",
    "let us make some remarks .",
    "* we assume that the source generating qutrirs is stationary .",
    "since each measurement eliminates a qutrit one has to be sure that there are a lot of copies of the initial state ; each copy must be prepared in the same quantum state .",
    "ensemble approach _ guarantees that the experimentalist deals with the same quantum state in all trials . in other words ,",
    "the outcomes provide him with the information about the same quantum state and elimination of a particular state does not affect the rest ones .    *",
    "* the outcomes of the set - up are numbers related to the corresponding moments ( 19 ) .",
    "usually this number is the coincidence counting rate or the number of coincidences in a fixed time interval . due to the necessity of a proper normalization of the state under investigation , the number of independent real parameters grows up .",
    "the normalization is obtained from the measurement of moments @xmath132 and @xmath118 .",
    "furthermore , only cosine and sine of the phases @xmath133 and @xmath134 can be measured in experiment as there is no way to measure the phases directly .",
    "that is why the final number of real parameters to be measured in experiment is 7 for a pure qutrit state and 9 for a mixed state .    *",
    "* * to minimize the errors caused by independent statistical fluctuations of the outcomes , the number of moments ( 12 , 13 ) entering in eq .",
    "( 19 ) should be minimal .      in the second method of quantum tomography ,",
    "a biphoton - qutrit being measured is first subject to a sequence of unitary transformations and , for each of such transformation , it is fed to the brown - twiss scheme settled for measuring a fixed moment . using the wave plate with arbitrary optical thickness",
    ", one can achieve the quorum varying the orientation of the plate @xmath135 .    in the most general case the coincidence counting rate in this protocol",
    "is a periodic function of @xmath136 , moreover , its fourie expansion contains nine harmonics of @xmath137 : @xmath138 , @xmath139 , @xmath140 , @xmath141 , @xmath142 , @xmath143 , @xmath144 , @xmath145 , @xmath146 .",
    "these harmonics depend linearly on the nine moments @xmath116 , @xmath117 , @xmath118 , @xmath147 , @xmath148 , @xmath149 , @xmath150 , @xmath151 , @xmath152 . in other words",
    ", there is a @xmath153 matrix @xmath154 that links these nine harmonics to the nine moments as shown below .",
    "@xmath155    unfortunately , the inverse matrix does not always exist . to simplify the problem we put only a single wave plate with fixed optical thickness ( @xmath156 ) and fixed orientation @xmath157 in each channel of the brown - twiss scheme .",
    "in order to make sure the inverse matrix exists one needs to maximize the determinant of the matrix @xmath154 over the orientations of the plates @xmath158 . after accomplishing this procedure",

    "only a single wave plate is introduced in each channel.,scaledwidth=40.0% ]    instead of finding the links between the harmonics and moments , there is a more elegant method to reconstruct the quantum state using the second protocol ( see section iii.d ) .",

    "the _ preparation block _ includes a 2-mm bbo crystal with either type - i or type - ii degenerate and collinear phase - matching , which is pumped with cw - argon laser operated at 351 nm wavelength . in the case of type - ii phase - matching ,",
    "an additional quartz compensator is introduced right after the crystal .",

    "so the state , which is to be measured , is determined by the parameter @xmath61 .",
    "the _ measurement block _ is a brown - twiss scheme equipped with polarization filters placed in both arms ( fig.3 ) .",

    "this time is an important experimental parameter .",
    "each measurement consists of 30 runs , after which the scheme is reset .",
    "namely each measurement is performed by setting the angles of wave plates @xmath164 and @xmath165 in both arms according to the tomographic protocol ( table i ) .",

    "a quartz plate with the optical thickness @xmath168 is placed after the bbo crystal to prepare the qutrit state to be measured .",

    "although the amplitudes of the processes can not be measured directly , they are of the greatest interest as these quantities describe fundamental relationships in quantum physics .",
    "it follows from the superposition principle that the amplitudes are linearly related to the state - vector components .",

    "starting approximately from this value , fidelity is reaching saturation and further growth of experimental data volume does not lead to an increase in the precision of quantum system estimation .",
    "fig.7 relates to the state defined by orientation angle of quartz plate * qp1 * @xmath227 ( for protocol 2 ) .",
