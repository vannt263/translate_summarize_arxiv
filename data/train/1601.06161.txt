    "the future of radio astronomy relies strongly on interferometers ( e.g. , alma , evla , vlti , aperture masking techniques ) . from our experience at interferometer summer schools at the nobeyama radio observatory and at the carma observatory , we are convinced that hands - on experiments are critical to a full understanding of the concepts of interferometry .",
    "it is difficult , if not impossible , to obtain guaranteed access to professional interferometers for university courses .",
    "therefore , we built a low - cost radio interferometer for the purpose of education and developed corresponding syllabi for undergraduate and graduate astronomy lab courses .",
    "this experiment teaches the basic concept of interferometry using the technique developed by michelson & peace in the early 20th century @xcite .",
    "they measured the diameter of betelgeuse , one of the brightest stars in the sky , with a simple optical interferometer .",
    "such optical interferometry needs high precision telescope optics .",
    "the same experiment becomes much easier when measuring the diameter of the sun at radio wavelength ; the acceptable errors in the optics scale with the wavelength .",
    "figure [ fig : sketch ] shows a conceptual sketch of the michelson radio interferometer for education .",

    "the michelson stellar interferometer is an application of the same physical concept of interference , in this case , to a light source in the sky .",
    "the theoretical basis of the michelson stellar interferometer was already established in the michelson and peace s original work @xcite and has been used in radio interferometry , especially in its early history @xcite . this adding interferometer is the type used in modern astronomy at optical and near - infrared wavelengths @xcite though modern radio interferometers are of a different type , multiplying signals instead of adding them @xcite . for educational purposes",

    "the signals that arrive at the two side mirrors ( figure [ fig : sketch ] ) are guided to the antenna and mixed .",
    "the separation between the two mirrors , called baseline length @xmath2 , causes a time delay @xmath3 in the arrival of the signal at position 2 because of the geometry ( figure [ fig : schemsignal ] ) . using the angles of the telescope pointing @xmath4 and to an object in the sky @xmath5",

    "we describe the construction of the telescope and receiver system .",
    "the budget is often the main limitation in the development of student lab experiments .",
    "hence , we utilized low - cost parts and materials and used a commercial broadcast satellite dish and feedhorn operating at radio x - band .",
    "the system was constructed in our machine and electronics shops .",
    "fabrication of the components could be offered as a student lab projects .",
    "figure [ fig : sketch ] shows the design of the michelson stellar radio interferometer .",
    "radio signals from the sun hit two flat mirrors at the sides and are reflected to a satellite dish antenna by the central flat mirrors .",
    "the signals from the two sides are mixed as detected .",
    "figure [ fig : telescope ] shows photos of the telescope .",
    "it was built with mostly commercial products and materials .",
    "a broadcast satellite dish and feedhorn ( blue in figure [ fig : sketch ] ; figure [ fig : telescope]a , b ) operates at a frequency of @xmath55 ghz ( @xmath56 cm in wavelength ) .",
    "the required accuracy of optics at this wavelength is about @xmath03 - 5 mm , which is relatively easy to achieve with flat mirrors ( without curvature ) .    the flat mirrors ( green in figure [ fig : sketch ] ) are made of fiberboard with wooden framing structures ( figure [ fig : telescope]e ) .",
    "the mirror surfaces are all angled @xmath57 from the optical path .",
    "we originally covered their surfaces with kitchen aluminum foil , which has an appropriate thickness with respect to the skin depth ( @xmath58 ) at the operating wavelength ( reflectivity @xmath59% from our lab measurements ) .",
    "later , we replaced it with thin aluminum plates as student - proofing ( figure [ fig : telescope]d ) .",
    "the two side mirrors slide on a ladder to change the baseline length .",
    "the azimuth - elevation mount structure is made with plywood ( red in figure [ fig : sketch ] and blue and yellow in figure [ fig : telescope ] ) .",
    "the azimuthal and elevation axes are driven with motors ( figure [ fig : telescope]c ) , which are controlled by a paddle ( i.e. , handset in figure [ fig : telescope]b ) .",
    "the protractor ( figure [ fig : telescope]f ) is placed at the center of the bottom mount plate ( yellow in figure [ fig : telescope]b ) for measurement of the azimuthal angle of the telescope .",
    "figure [ fig : telescope]a shows the whole structure of the telescope .",
    "a metal pole is mounted perpendicular to the top mount plate ( figure [ fig : telescope]b ) and aluminum frame ( figure [ fig : telescope]c ) , and supports the dish .",
    "note that the pole should be perpendicular , which makes the pointing adjustment easier as discussed later .",
    "the azimuthal rotation is facilitated by greased handcrafted ball bearings in circular grooves around the azimuth shaft on the base ( blue in figure [ fig : telescope]a , b - below the yellow structure ) and on the bottom mount plate ( yellow ) .",
    "sweeping across the sun in azimuth permits fringe measurements .",
    "this telescope can be converted to a single - dish telescope by flipping the satellite dish by 180 degrees around the metal pole ( see figure [ fig : telescope]b ) .",
    "single - dish and interferometer measurements can be easily made and compared , which is essential for appreciation of the high angular resolution possible with the interferometer .",
    "table [ tab : telescope ] lists the commercial product parts that we purchased .",
    "the other parts , mostly the support structure , are made in the machine shop .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab : receiver ]      the signal detection system in radio astronomy is a series of electronic components .",
    "figure [ fig : receiver ] shows the design and photos of the receiver .",
    "again , these are mostly commercial products .",
    "signals from the sky are at too high a frequency ( @xmath60 ghz ) to be handled electronically . hence the low noise block feedhorn ( lnbf ) down - converts the frequency to a lower frequency , called the intermediate frequency ( if ; 950 - 1950mhz ) , by mixing the sky signal with a reference signal at a slightly - offset frequency and producing a signal at the beat frequency of the sky and reference signals .",
    "this is called heterodyne receiving .",
    "the lnbf works as a heterodyne mixer .",
    "figure [ fig : receiver ] shows the flow of signal . in sequence ,",
    "an amplifier , two attenuators , and bandpass filter adjust the signal amplitude to the input range of a square - law detector .",
    "we combined two commercially available attenuators to achieve the desired attenuation of @xmath61 db . a filter with a 100 mhz width narrows the frequency range , since the bandwidth of the if ( 1ghz at the operating frequency of @xmath011 ghz ) is too broad for detection of null fringes in interferometry .",
    "output from the detector is then amplified to the whole dynamic range of the analog - to - digital ( a / d ) converter .",
    "we assembled all these components inside a metal box for protection .",
    "a power supply is also in the box , providing the power to the lnbf and amplifiers .",
    "the output from the receiver box goes to a commercial labpro a / d convertor .",
    "the labpro is connected via usb to , and controlled by , a laptop computer with labpro software installed .",
    "it takes care of time integration and sampling rate for voltage measurements .    table [ tab : receiver ]",
    "lists the electronics components that we purchased .",
    "the square - law detector ( schottky diode detector ) was purchased through ebay , and similar devices seem almost always on sale there .",
    "we then found and purchased the amplifier and attenuators to adjust the signal voltage amplitude to adjust the input range of the detector and the output range of the lnbf when the telescope is pointing toward the sun and satellites .",
    "the mount structure , ladder , and mirrors of the telescope ( figure [ fig : telescope ] ) are detached when it is stored in our physics building .",
    "we move them with a cart to the front of the building and assemble them there on the morning of experiment .",
    "we make sure that the flat mirrors are angled at @xmath57 with respect to the optical path and @xmath62 vertically , using a triangle .",
    "we then attach the ladder and mirrors to the mount structure using clamps mounted on the structure .",
    "the electronic components are also connected : the signal from the feedhorn goes to the receiver ( figure [ fig : receiver ] ) , then to the a / d converter labpro , and finally to a computer via usb .",
    "we use software which comes with labpro to control sampling frequency ( integration time ) and duration of recording .",
    "telescope pointing adjustment is the next step before the experiment .",
    "we prepare a table of the sun s azimuthal and elevation angles as a function of time ( e.g. , at 10min interval ) using an on - line tool provided by the u.s .",
    "naval observatory ( http://aa.usno.navy.mil/data/docs/altaz.php ) .",
    "the antenna is set to the single - dish mode ( i.e. , dish facing toward the sun ) .",
    "we align the planes of the mount s top plate and ladder parallel to sunlight using their shadows .",
    "the azimuth is set to that of the sun , and we adjust the elevation angle of the dish to maximize the signal from the sun on the voltage meter . [ our dish is an off - axis paraboloid antenna , and the direction of the dish looks very offset from the direction of the sun .",
    "we therefore need to use the voltage meter .",
    "we later installed a foot - long rod on the dish and marked a point ( on the dish ) at which the shadow of the rod tip falls when pointed toward the sun .",
    "] we then flip the dish by @xmath63 around the metal pole for interferometer measurements .",
    "the signal amplitudes from the two side mirrors need to be balanced .",
    "we check the voltage readout from each side mirror separately by blocking the optical path of the other ( or by removing the other mirror ) .",
    "we move the central mirror toward the side of stronger signal to decrease its effective surface area .",
    "once the mirrors are set and the telescope is pointed toward the sun , we start interferometer measurements .",
    "we should see fringes from the sun ( e.g. , figure [ fig : sun ] ) as we slew the telescope and sweep across the sun in the azimuthal direction .",
    "we typically spend 10 - 30 second on each `` sweep '' observation , and then correct the telescope pointing before the next sweep .",
    "the pattern may be seen as variations of the voltage readout , or as a fringe pattern in a plot ( figure [ fig : sun ] ) , if the labpro and computer are already started .",
    "the labpro and the computer do not know about telescope pointing and record only the readout voltage as a function of time .",
    "we therefore need to convert the time to azimuthal angle after the measurements .",
    "we record the start and end azimuthal angles in sweeping the sun  we start from a far - off position , say 10 - 20@xmath64 away in azimuth , and sweep the sun in azimuth .",
    "we assume that the telescope slew speed is constant ( approximately correct when we record for a long time , e.g. 20 - 30 seconds ) .",
    "the projection effect , i.e. , the cos(elevation ) term , must be accounted for in calculation of arc length in the sky .",
    "we change baseline length by sliding the side mirrors on the ladder and repeat fringe measurements .",
    "the baseline length should be determined from the fringe pattern , but for reference , we record the side mirror separation using a tape measure fixed to the ladder .",
    "radio interference was initially a problem .",
    "we conducted a site search across the campus .",
    "we brought the dish and a commercial receiver ( called a satellite finder @xmath0 $ 10 - 20 , which is used to find commercial television satellites when a dish is installed ) and compared the strengths of the sun and ambient radio signals .",
    "we conveniently found that one spot in front of our building was radio quiet .",
    "geosynchronous satellites are located along a thin belt in the sky .",
    "the sun s sidereal path gets aligned along this belt in some seasons , which hinders the experiment .",
    "this should be checked at the planning stage of the experiment .",
    "the current mount structure is slightly wider than a standard doorway .",
    "it does not fit on most of our elevators and can not pass through exit doors of our building .",
    "we have to carry it out via a loading deck .",
    "this could have been taken into account when the telescope was designed .",
    "the telescope can be used as a single - dish radio telescope by pointing the dish directly toward the sky .",
    "the beam size of our dish is roughly @xmath65 in x band , with which we can barely resolve the sun ( @xmath66 diameter ) .",
    "we can compare the profiles of the sun and a commercial satellite ( a point source ) to find this experimentally .",
    "the sun s diameter can be resolved and determined with the interferometer .",
    "the comparison of the single - dish and interferometer measurements permits students to appreciate the superiority of interferometry in terms of spatial resolution .",
    "figure [ fig : results ] shows results from a student group s lab report , panel ( a ) is an example of a fringe pattern of the sun .",
    "they determined the baseline length by measuring the interval between peaks and troughs ( and from their readings of the side mirror separation ) .",
    "this group repeated fringe measurements three times at each of 10 different baseline lengths .",
    "panel ( b ) shows a fit of the _ sinc _ function , i.e. , the fourier transform of the sun .",
    "the null point at @xmath67 in the fit suggests that their measurement of the sun s diameter is @xmath68 at @xmath60 ghz .",
    "note that its reported diameter at @xmath69 ghz is about @xmath70 with little dependence on solar activity ( i.e. , sunspot number ) ; this diameter is calculated from the observed radio - to - optical diameter ratios @xcite and the optical diameter of @xmath71 .",
    "these results demonstrate a proof of concept demonstrated by our students , and a variety of exercises can be developed for a student lab beyond what is described here .",
