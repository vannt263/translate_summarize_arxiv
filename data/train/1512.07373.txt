    "one of the fundamental goals of relativistic heavy ion collisions ( rhic ) is to locate the critical point of the qcd phase diagram  @xcite . to search the critical point in experiment ,",
    "the star collaboration has systematically measured the higher cumulants of net - protons in au+au collisions at @xmath4 = 7.7 , 11.5 , 19.6 , 27 , 39 , 62.4 and 200 gev  @xcite . with",
    "the maximum transverse momentum increased from @xmath5 to @xmath6 gev , the measured cumulant ratios @xmath7 of net protons show large deviations from the poisson baselines and present an obvious non - monotonic behavior in the most central au+au collisions  @xcite , which hints the signal of the qcd critical point . to quantitatively study",
    "these experimental data , we need to develop dynamical models near the qcd critical point . currently , most of the dynamical models near the qcd critical point , e.g. chiral fluid dynamics , focus on the dynamical evolution of the bulk matter  @xcite . in a recent paper  @xcite , we introduced a freeze - out scheme for the dynamical models near the qcd critical point through coupling the decoupled classical particles with the order parameter field . with a modified distribution function , we calculated the correlated fluctuations of net protons on the hydrodynamic freeze - out surface in au+au collisions at various collision energies . in this proceeding , we will briefly summarize the main results of that paper .",
    "in traditional hydrodynamics , the particles emitted from the freeze - out surface can be calculated through the cooper - frye formula with a classical distribution function @xmath8  @xcite . in the vicinity of the critical point",
    ", we assume the effective mass of the classical particles strongly fluctuates through interacting with the order parameter field : @xmath9 , which introduces a modified distribution function that also correlated fluctuates in position space  @xcite . to the linear order of @xmath10",
    ", the modified distribution function can be expanded as : @xmath11where @xmath12 is the traditional equilibrium distribution function , @xmath13 is the fluctuation deviated from the equilibrium part , @xmath14 is the covariant lorentz factor and the coupling constant @xmath15 . with such expansion",
    ", the connected 2-point 3-point and 4-point correlators @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 are proportional to @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 , respectively . integrating over the whole freezeout surface for theses correlators gives the explicit forms of the critical fluctuations for produced hadrons  @xcite : @xmath22 where the correlators of the sigma field can be derived from the probability distribution function with cubic and quartic terms @xmath23=\\exp \\left\\ { -\\omega \\left [ \\sigma \\right ] /t\\right\\ }     = \\exp \\left\\{-\\int d^{3}x\\left [ \\frac{1}{2}\\left ( \\nabla \\sigma \\right ) ^{2}+\\frac{1}{2}m_{\\sigma } ^{2}\\sigma ^{2}+\\frac{\\lambda _",

    "we assume the critical and noncritical fluctuations are independent , and use the poission and binomial distributions as the non - critical fluctuations baselines .",
    "correspondingly , the total cumulants are expressed as : @xmath30 , @xmath31 ( with @xmath32 ) . to roughly fit the trends of @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath0 of net protons",

    "parameter ranges , we roughly describe the decreasing trend of @xmath2 and @xmath3 and the non - monotonic behavior of @xmath0 with the increase of collision energy .",
    "however , @xmath40 and @xmath41 from our model calculations are always above the poisson / binomial baselines due to the positive contributions from the critical fluctuations . for the binomial baselines",
    ", our model calculations can nicely fit the energy dependent @xmath42 within two different @xmath43 ranges .",
    "however , if using the poisson baselines , our calculations can not simultaneously describe the @xmath42 data at lower collision energies . for au+au collisions below 11.5 gev ,",
    "the measured @xmath42 are higher than the poisson expectation values for @xmath44 , but lower than the poisson expectation values for @xmath45 . for eqs.(2 - 4 ) , the change of the @xmath43 ranges only affects the magnitude of the @xmath46 from the critical fluctuations , rather than their signs , which thus can not explain the @xmath42 data at lower collision energies with the poisson baseline .",
    "fig .  1 and fig .  2 also show that , with the maximum @xmath43 increased from 0.8 gev to 2 gev , the higher cumulants from both experiment and model dramatically increase , showing large deviations from the poisson / binomial baselines .",
    "in fact , the @xmath47 order critical fluctuations from eqs.(2 - 4 ) are closely related to the @xmath47 power of the total net - proton numbers within the defined @xmath48 and rapidity range . with the maximum @xmath48",
    "increased from @xmath49 to @xmath50 , the averaged numbers of the net protons almost increase by a factor of two , leading to large increase of higher cumulants in our calculations .",

    "ref  @xcite also showed that the critical fluctuations dramatically decreased from most central to semi - peripheral au+au collisions . for 30 - 40% centrality , our model calculations ( in @xcite )",
    "can nicely fit @xmath55 and @xmath7 with the binomial baselines , but fail to fit @xmath7 with the poisson baselines since the poisson expectations largely deviate from the experimental data there .",
