    "the study of layered ferromagnet - superconductor ( f / s ) heterostructure has sustained the active interest of many researchers .",
    "this is due in great part to continuing and recent progress in the preparation and fabrication of multilayer systems , and to the potential use of such heterostructures in various important applications . in particular , structures consisting of alternating ferromagnet ( f ) and superconductor ( s )",
    "layers may exhibit , in certain cases , a ground state in which the difference @xmath3 between the order parameter phase of adjacent superconductor layers equals @xmath2 .",
    "these are the so called `` @xmath2 junctions '' .",
    "these f / s hybrid structures offer advances in the field of nanoscale technology , including quantum computing,@xcite where the implementation of a quantum two - level system is based on superconducting loops of @xmath2 junctions .",
    "furthermore , artificial composites involving a superconductor sandwiched between two ferromagnets , the design of which follows from giant magnetoresistive ( gmr ) devices , show potential use as spin - valves@xcite and nonvolatile memory elements.@xcite an essential principle behind many of these spin - based devices is the damped oscillatory nature of the cooper pairs in the ferromagnet region , and the associated phase shift in the superconducting order parameter .",
    "the coupling between nearby superconductors separated by a ferromagnet is a property that follows from the proximity effects , which in the context of f / s multilayers consist of the existence of superconducting correlations in the ferromagnet and magnetic correlations in the superconductor , arising from their mutual influence . the resulting superconducting phase coherence is quantified by the pair amplitude @xmath4 , where the @xmath5 are the usual annihilation operators .",
    "it is now well established that the leakage of superconductivity is due to the process of andreev reflection@xcite , whereby a quasiparticle incident on a f / s interface is retroreflected as a quasihole of opposite spin .",
    "it is in turn the coherent superposition of these states , spin split by the exchange field in the ferromagnet , that ultimately leads to damped oscillations of @xmath6 in the magnet , with a characteristic length @xmath7 typically much smaller than the superconducting coherence length @xmath8 .",
    "these oscillations are akin to high field oscillatory phenomena described a long time ago.@xcite in the absence of currents and magnetic fields , the modulation of the order parameter determines whether two neighboring superconductor layers share a stable @xmath2 or @xmath1 phase difference . for a multilayer f",
    "/ s heterostructure with ferromagnet layers of order @xmath9 in width , it is intuitively evident , taking into account the continuity of @xmath6 across the f / s interface and the particular oscillatory nature of the pair amplitude in the ferromagnet , that a configuration will result in which it is energetically favorable to have a phase difference of @xmath10 , rather than zero , between successive superconducting layers .",
    "this indeed turns out to be the case .",
    "although recently there has been a surge of interest in the study of f / s multilayer structures , ( see e.g. the theoretical work of refs .   and the experimental work discussed below ) work on superconductor - ferromagnet - superconductor ( sfs ) josephson junctions started long ago.@xcite the josephson current was calculated for a short weak link in the clean limit , and found to exhibit oscillations as a function of the ferromagnet exchange field.@xcite it was later demonstrated that for an sfs sandwich obeying the dirty limit conditions , the critical current oscillates as a function of the thickness of the magnet , and of the exchange field.@xcite a more detailed analysis of dirty @xmath2 junctions near the critical temperature allowed for differing transparencies of the ferromagnet - superconductor interfaces.@xcite many interesting phenomena have been proposed or discussed .",
    "calculations were more recently performed for an sfs junction with arbitrary impurity concentration . for non - homogeneous magnetization,@xcite the superconductor may exhibit a nonzero triplet component extending well into the magnet . for quasi two - dimensional , tight - binding , f / s atomic - scale multilayers , the ground state was shown in some cases to be the @xmath2 state @xcite , and the density of states ( dos ) exhibited prominent features that depend critically on the exchange field and transfer integral parameters.@xcite for multilayer structures consisting of two ferromagnets and an insulator sandwiched between two superconductors , an enhancement of the josephson current was predicted@xcite for antiparallel alignment of the magnetization in the ferromagnet layers . spin - orbit scattering@xcite and changing the relative orientation angle of the in - plane magnetizations@xcite",
    "were shown to significantly modify the behavior of the dc josephson current .",
    "the rapidly evolving theoretical views compounded with technological advancements which permit the fabrication of well - characterized heterostructures , has prompted a considerable number of experimental investigations of @xmath2 coupling on several fronts .",
    "a study of the superconducting transition temperature for f / s multilayers revealed oscillatory behavior as a function of ferromagnet thickness.@xcite for @xmath2 junctions involving relatively weak ferromagnets , variations in temperature can induce a crossover from @xmath11 to the @xmath2 state , and this was observed@xcite as oscillations of the critical current versus temperature .",
    "the transition to the @xmath2 state is also reflected in critical current measurements for josephson junctions in which the ferromagnet layer separating the two superconductors was systematically varied.@xcite the superconducting phase was measured directly@xcite using squid s made of @xmath2 junctions , demonstrating a half quantum flux shift in the diffraction pattern .",
    "direct evidence of the oscillatory behavior of the superconducting correlations in the ferromagnet was found through tunneling spectroscopy measurements which yielded inversions in dos for a thin ferromagnetic film , in contrast with the behavior in a superconductor.@xcite    a common feature that pervades most of the theoretical work mentioned above is the use of quasiclassical formalisms , often compounded by the neglect of self - consistency for the space dependent pair potential , @xmath12 .",
    "these approximations do have the advantage of providing an accessible and efficient method to approximately calculate properties of inhomogeneous superconducting systems , while avoiding the cumbersome numerical issues that arise when attempting to solve the corresponding , much more complicated , self - consistent microscopic equations .",
    "the general underlying drawback of such approximations however , is the elimination from consideration of phenomena at the atomic length scale given by the fermi wavelength , @xmath13 , as can be seen in the derivation of the eilenberger equations.@xcite further approximations follow when the assumption is made that the mean free path is much shorter than @xmath8 , in which case the eilenberger equations reduce to the widely used usadel equations.@xcite the elimination of the relatively small length scales poses problems for quasiclassical methods ( even when self - consistent ) when interfacial scattering is involved,@xcite or when the geometry or potentials have sharp variations on the atomic scale .",
    "these issues , of increasing experimental importance given the ever improving quality of the experimental samples , often require nontrivial effective boundary conditions that must supplement the basic equations .",
    "the problem worsens when dealing with multilayer structures , where the successive reflections and transmission of quasiparticles creates closed trajectories@xcite that may render the quasiclassical approximation scheme inapplicable .    in this paper",
    "we investigate the proximity effect and associated electronic properties of clean three - dimensional f / s multilayer structures comprised of alternating superconductor and ferromagnet layers .",
    "our emphasis is on the study of the existence of pair potential behavior of the @xmath2 type .",
    "we implement a complete self - consistent microscopic theory that treats all the characteristic length scales on an equal footing , and thus can accommodate all quantum interference effects that are likely to be pertinent",
    ". the problem will be solved from a wave function approach using the bogoliubov - de gennes ( bdg ) equations .",
    "to do so , we extend an earlier method@xcite used for a single f / s structure , to allow for a more complicated geometry , consisting of an arbitrary number of layers .",
    "self - consistency is rigorously included , as it has been demonstrated@xcite that this is essential in the study of the proximity effect at f / s interfaces .",
    "we present in sec.[method ] the geometry and the numerical approach we take to solve the microscopic bdg equations and obtain the self consistent energy spectra ( eigenvalues and eigenfunctions ) .",
    "we also explain in some detail how the local dos and the ground state energy are calculated . in sec.[results ] we first present our results for sfs structures and show examples of the relevant quantities : these include first of all the pair amplitude , which is used to illustrate the cases in which either the @xmath1 or @xmath2 state is energetically favored .",
    "the thickness of the f layer or layers turns out to be the decisive parameter , with the zero and @xmath2 states periodically alternating in stability as this quantity varies .",
    "the experimentally accessible dos averaged over a superconducting layer is next discussed : results for both the sum and the difference of the up and down spin terms are presented and their correlation with the zero or @xmath2 states demonstrated .",
    "results for the local magnetic moment , which we show how to calculate from the spin - dependent local dos , are also given : in the superconductor this quantity measures the penetration of magnetic correlations .",
    "we analyze also , in a similar fashion , a more complicated five layer structure , discuss the similarities and differences between the two geometries , and the generalization of our results to more complicated structures . finally in sec.[conclusions ] we briefly summarize our results and discuss potential experimental implications and future work .",
    "in this paper we consider a semi - infinite multilayer structure of total length @xmath14 in the @xmath15-direction , consisting of an odd number @xmath16 of alternate superconductor ( s ) and ferromagnetic ( f ) layers , each of width @xmath17 and @xmath0 respectively ( see fig .",

    ", the quantity @xmath28 can be taken to be real , but it can in principle switch sign ( zero or @xmath2 state ) in going from one s layer to the next .    in our calculations",
    "we have studied two different values of the parameter @xmath80 , @xmath81 and @xmath38 .",
    "we have set the superconducting correlation length @xmath8 to @xmath82 , where @xmath83 is the fermi wavevector of the superconductor , and taken @xmath84 for the dimensionless debye energy cutoff .",
    "it follows from previous studies@xcite that the first of these parameters simply sets the overall length scale in the superconductor and is of little relevance whenever @xmath17 exceeds @xmath8 , as will be the case here , while the second is unimportant at low temperatures ( the limit that we will consider ) , as it simply sets the scale for @xmath85 .",
    "we have also assumed that there is no oxide barrier between the layers and that the `` mismatch parameter '' @xmath86 is unity .",
    "a nonzero barrier height would in general diminish the amplitude of all the phenomena discussed here , without qualitatively altering the results .",
    "the possible influence of varying @xmath87 is more complicated : this parameter@xcite determines , together with @xmath80 , the basic spatial periodicity of the problem , @xmath88 , ( where @xmath89 and @xmath90 are respectively the fermi wavevectors of the parabolic up and down spin bands in the ferromagnet ) which we shall see is very important here .",
    "furthermore , the amplitude of the oscillatory behavior found in simpler sf structures decreases@xcite with @xmath87 .    as explained in previous work ( see refs .  )",
    ", the self consistent solution to these equations is obtained iteratively : one makes a suitable initial guess for @xmath28 , diagonalizes the system eqn .",

    "the technicalities for the self consistent solution of these equations were extensively discussed in previous work@xcite .",
    "the diagonalization in terms of the orthonormal basis chosen must be performed for each value of @xmath91 in the appropriate range .",
    "we took here @xmath92 different values of @xmath91 , except as indicated below , and the number of basis functions required for convergence was up to @xmath93 .",
    "the self consistent solution process is terminated when the relative error between consecutive iterated values of @xmath28 nowhere exceeds @xmath94 .",
    "we have found that the number of iterations needed to achieve self consistency can be quite large : in most cases , it exceeds fifty .    because our objective here is to discuss the possible @xmath2 states , in starting the iteration process we make two different initial guesses :",
    "one is of the ordinary `` zero '' state form , where the initial guess has the same sign ( conventionally positive ) in all the superconducting layers , and one of the @xmath2 form , where it alternates sign from one s layer to the next .",
    "we have found that in some cases , for example for sfs structures with small @xmath17 ( i.e. , @xmath95 ) , and @xmath96 , the self - consistent @xmath28 typically converges to _ either _ a @xmath1 _ or _",
    "@xmath2-state regardless of the initial guess , depending on @xmath0 .",
    "a similar trend holds for the small @xmath17 five layer sfsfs system but over a broader @xmath0 range .",
    "however , for the regular structures that we will focus on here , with @xmath97 , two different self consistent solutions are _ always _ obtained , one of the zero and one of the @xmath2 type , according to the type of initial guess .",
    "we interpret this as showing that two local minima of the free energy exist .",
    "we then have to determine the stable minimum by calculating the free energy ( or rather , at low temperature , the ground state energy ) of both self consistent states , as discussed below , and comparing them .",
    "we consider first the case of an sfs sandwich .",
    "preliminary investigations showed that the situation of interest occurs when the magnetic layer is not too thick .",
    "this is as expected , since the overall length over which the superconducting correlations penetrate ( in an oscillatory way ) into the magnet is characterized by @xmath98 , which at the relatively large values of @xmath80 considered here is fairly small .",
    "thus , we have taken in the studies presented here a thickness @xmath99 for the superconducting layers , and the parameter @xmath100 meanwhile , is varied in the range between one and twenty .",

    "the blue ( solid ) lines represent self - consistent solutions of the zero type , and the red lines alternative self consistent solutions of the @xmath2 type .",
    "the value of @xmath80 is 0.5 and the superconducting correlation length is @xmath106 . ]",
    "as explained above , results were obtained by iteration from two initial configurations of @xmath28 , with the initial guesses corresponding to opposite signs for the pair potential in each of the two s layers .",
    "for the range of parameters considered here , both initial guesses led in all cases to self consistent configurations , which were either of the zero or of the @xmath2 types , according to the initial guess .",
    "this is described in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , where we show examples of the two self consistent solutions for the pair amplitude @xmath102 , as a function of the dimensionless distance @xmath107 .",
    "it is not surprising that both types of solutions are found : it is after all obvious that in the limit where @xmath0 is sufficiently large , both solutions must exist and be degenerate .",
    "the pair amplitude @xmath108 does not vanish identically in the magnetic region , but it exhibits the well - known oscillations . in the superconductor ,",
    "it rises in absolute value towards the bulk result , away from the s / f interfaces .",
    "results are shown for two values of @xmath80 and two values of @xmath109 .",
    "we can see that in certain cases , depending on the thickness of the f layer , @xmath110 in the superconductor ( and hence @xmath28 ) is larger , in absolute value , for the zero than for the @xmath2 state ( see top panel ) , while in some other cases ( middle panel ) the opposite occurs , and for yet some other @xmath0 values ( see the bottom panel ) there is no observable difference .",
    "intuitively , this happens because of the different way , depending on @xmath109 , in which the pair amplitude in the two superconductor regions must adjust itself to the oscillations in the magnet . that the oscillatory behavior of the pair amplitude in the f layer is clearly different for the zero and @xmath2 solutions can be seen by careful examination of the portion of the plots which lies in the f region .    to find out the most stable configuration",

    "( [ final ] ) . in practice",
    "this is computationally very difficult : the value of @xmath76 for each state must be computed separately from its own spectrum ( which can consist of up to @xmath111 eigenstates ) , and the results subtracted .",
    "since each @xmath76 includes the normal state energy , which is many orders of magnitude larger than the condensation energy sought , this requires extreme numerical accuracy .",
    "the problem is exacerbated because the `` logarithmic '' last term in the right side of eqn .",
    "( [ final ] ) is in itself much larger than the condensation energy ( and the latter is itself considerably larger , as we shall see below , than the condensation energy _ difference _ between the two states ) , and must be exactly canceled by a portion of the first term .",

    "the calculations and method used in this paper , although sufficiently general to include in the future more complicated effects ( e.g. finite temperature , other pairing states , spin - flip scattering , and impurities ) , were taken within the ballistic limit .",
    "this limit is appropriate for ferromagnet layers whose width is less than the mean free path , and this is consistent with our calculations , where we have taken @xmath144 .",
