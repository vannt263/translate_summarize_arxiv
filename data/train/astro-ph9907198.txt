    "there is strong evidence for black holes with a wide range in mass in the centres of galaxies , and unambiguous evidence for dense stellar clusters in galactic cores .",
    "activity in the nuclei of galaxies appears to be intimately linked not only to these supermassive black holes ( bh ) and nuclear starbursts , but also to interactions between galaxies .",
    "the evidence for this link  both direct and circumstantial  has been reviewed in detail by perry  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; see also ) .",
    "the exact nature of the link remains uncertain : interactions , starbursts and activity certainly can not be equated , and not all systems with these components are active .",
    "in particular , galactic interactions do not always result in activity @xcite .",
    "however , the evidence does unequivocally demonstrate that the active nucleus is _ not _ a ` parasite ' upon a ` host ' galaxy , but rather that activity is a galaxy - wide phenomenon which is most clearly identified by the dramatic events in the galaxy nucleus . in this paper",
    ", we consider the hydrodynamics of this basic nuclear system .",
    "the most dramatic of the nuclear phenomena is the highly luminous ( @xmath1 to @xmath2 ) , time - variable , broad - band ( radio to @xmath3-ray ) radiation emitted from regions as small as a few light - seconds .",
    "this radiation is accompanied in many agn by broad emission lines from heavy elements in cold ( @xmath4 ) dense ( @xmath5 to @xmath6 ) gas . in the unified model of active nuclei ,",
    "the broad line region is a constituent of all active nuclei , although it is not observed in some as a result of continuum beaming or intervening obscuration @xcite .",
    "line widths , which reflect local gas velocities , are typically several @xmath7 .",
    "average equivalent widths are remarkably consistent across orders of magnitude differences in total bolometric luminosity ( although with a marked scatter between individual objects at a given luminosity ) , indicating a tight relationship between the production of cold , condensed radiating gas structures and the production of the central luminosity itself .",
    "although accretion onto black holes seems clearly to dominate the physics of the innermost regions of agn ( within @xmath8 schwarzschild radii ) , and to provide a satisfying explanation of the radiation processes which create the luminous broad - band continuum , pure black hole accretion models have always suffered from an inability to explain the structure of the line emitting regions and had great difficulty in explaining the fuelling , before the importance of stars in the wider parsec sized core was recognised .    the stars which play the dominant role in the energetics and mass budget of galactic nuclei are young , mass - losing stars : these are most abundant and important in just those nuclear stellar clusters ",
    "starbursts  which are thought to be involved in activity .",
    "current theoretical models linking activity and starbursts come in two variants . in this paper",
    ", we explore the structure of the model @xcite based on the early work of perry & dyson ( * ? ? ?",
    "* , hereafter ) which unites starbursts and black holes as compact symbiotic systems in the nuclei of active galaxies ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* collin - souffrin  1988 , hereafter cdmp ; ) .",
    "in contrast , the pure starburst model equates the two phenomena , considering agn to be but extreme examples of nuclear starbursts @xcite .",
    "interestingly , radiative shocks around supernovae play a central rle in both theories .",
    "we shall refer to the starburst - black hole paradigm for agn as the symbiotic model .",
    "since powerful winds and supernovae dominate the energetics of starbursts , understanding the dynamic link between black holes and starbursts requires careful analysis of the stellar- and hydro - dynamics of the combined system . in this paper",
    "we present the first comprehensive treatment of the hydrodynamics of such a symbiotic system .    in the rest of this introduction",
    ", we outline the physical context and assumptions of our model .",
    "these assumptions will be discussed in more detail in subsequent sections .      in the symbiotic model of agn ,",
    "the nuclear starburst stellar cluster feeds the black hole through the nuclear interstellar medium ( nism ) created by stellar mass - loss .",
    "the formation of shocks within the nism is an _ inescapable _ consequence of the interaction between individual ( mass - loading ) stars and the global nism .",
    "it is important to emphasise that the presence of shocks in the nism is a model independent phenomenon and is a direct consequence of basic thermodynamics , stellar dynamics and hydrodynamics in galactic nuclei . in qsos ,",
    "the shocks around individual supernovae are sufficiently large that the shocked nism gas has time to cool radiatively into thermal equilibrium with the central radiation field at @xmath9 , so forming broad line emitting structures ( pd ) .",
    "the thermal pressure in such shock confined structures equals the stagnation pressure of the flow , which agrees well with the pressures deduced from observations of the emission lines .",
    "pd showed that using the observed equivalent widths of the high - ionization lines ( hils ) to deduce the average properties of the nism , the implied flow rates in the nism are sufficient to fuel the black hole accretion .",
    "this satisfyingly self - consistent picture did not initially explain the two-(or more)-component nature of the broad emission line region ( belr ) : the low - ionization lines ( lils ) are observed to be both red - shifted with respect to the hils , and to require a harder ionizing continuum .",
    "however , cdmp then showed that the nism flow can back - scatter x - rays which provide ` deep heating ' of the accretion disc sufficient to produce the lils .",
    "this two - component model resolved several outstanding questions concerning the belr .",
    "the transient nature of the belr clouds solved the ` cloud confinement problem ' .",
    "the existence of two distinct regions of broad line emission also gave a simple explanation for the observed systematic velocity shifts and multiple component structure of the broad line profiles @xcite .",
    "our results , in this paper , add another dimension to this understanding of the structure of the belr : we find that the nism itself forms distinct multi - component regions of differing characteristic excitation levels and velocities .",
    "the structure of the emission line region which emerges is that of distinct local clumps of line - emitting gas confined by transient shocks .",
    "recently , arav used the new generation of observations to update the limits which smooth line profiles put on the number of such centres of emission @xcite .",
    "their analysis was based on the fact that discrete emitting units give a smooth line profile only when the number of emitting units is very large .",
    "their method is sensitive to structures with velocity widths between 50 and @xmath10 ; within this range they find essentially no perturbations in the wings of the balmer lines , to very tight limits .",
    "this rules out many of the simplest scenarios for the formation of the lines by discrete clumps .",
    "arav were able to rule out emission from less than @xmath11 smooth shell sources with expansion velocity @xmath12",
    ". however , such sources , with small velocity width and perfect symmetry , are not representative of shock - confined emission line clouds in galactic nuclei .",
    "structures which are intrinsically smoother in emission than those they specifically considered , such as accretion discs ( which are thought on other grounds to be important contributors to the balmer emission , cdmp ) , or strong wind sources and bowshocks ( @xmath13 ) are not ruled out by these observations .",
    "the sonic velocity in the nism is at least @xmath14 ; this is the minimum expected shock velocity in the region . in fact , characteristic velocities of the shocks which arise in symbiotic nuclei are @xmath15 [ the combination of stellar ejection velocities ( often @xmath16 ) and the stellar orbital velocities ( @xmath17 within the central parsec ) ] .",
    "furthermore , the shocks are non - uniform : they are either open bow shocks with streaming tails , or closed shells distorted by their interaction with the wind .",
    "the density , radial velocity and surface emissivity  for any shock  all vary significantly around the shock - front , generating broad , complex lines with wings which are much less steep than those arav et al . assumed .",
    "as arav et al .",
    "pointed out , any flow which produces smoothly varying structures on velocity scales of 500  @xmath18 is allowed by the observations .",
    "we therefore conclude that their elegant analysis provides support for the pd model , and underlines the importance of hydrodynamic models of the belr .",
    "the physical parameters characterising the centre of a galaxy are the mass of the black hole , and the mass , stellar density profile , imf and age of the stellar cluster .",
    "the imf and age govern the mass - loss rate from stars due to stellar evolution ; collisions and tidal disruption are negligible except in the central regions of the densest clusters .",
    "the mass lost from the stars inevitably creates a nuclear interstellar medium ( nism ) .",
    "if there is a black hole accretion flow , either from this nism or from some other reservoir ( flow into the nucleus from a galactic bar ) , then radiation processes near the black hole can generate a powerful broad - band continuum ( although not if the flow into the black hole is hot or optically thick @xcite ) .",
    "for the present , we take this as an additional input to our simulations .",
    "the system which we consider in this paper is one in which such accretion processes are effective .",
    "the stellar cluster surrounding the black hole helps to determine the structure of the nism flow on the scale of the belr , through gravity and distributed stellar mass loss .",
    "the strength of this mass - loading is principally determined by the age and initial mass function ( imf ) of the stellar cluster .",
    "we shall assume that the cluster is young and dominated by high mass stars , and take our basic parameters from the stellar synthesis models of williams and perry .",
    "mass input from the stellar cluster is discrete and local .",
    "because we are interested in the generic properties of the global flows , we will concentrate on the luminous qsos . in such models ,",
    "the mass processing rates are high enough that we can average over the numerous small scale structures resulting from the interaction between individual stars and supernovae with the global flow .",
    "future papers will investigate the detailed structure of individual mass input sources , and the effects of the discrete mass input on the global flow .",
    "we have focussed on mass injection from stars within the cluster rather than from the external ism , primarily for two reasons .",
    "importantly , the mass flux from the external ism is unlikely to be able to provide a significant fraction of the fuelling requirements of the agn as a continuous source .",
    "the wind from the nucleus is in some cases strong enough to drive the external ism away .",
    "also , this is the situation described in pd , where the shocks around the mass - loading centres also generate the cool gas which emits the observed emission lines .",
    "therefore , rather than include the additional free parameters specifying the distribution of the ambient ism at the outer boundary of our models in this first paper , we have chosen to concentrate on the case where the phase of accretion from tens or hundreds of parsecs to within a parsec of the central black hole has already ceased .",
    "we have assumed that any relativistic jet driven from close to the central black hole is absent , or at least narrow , transferring little momentum to the surrounding global flow .",
    "if this assumption is reasonable , our models apply equally to radio - loud and radio - quiet objects .",
    "radio structures on parsec scales are seen in radio - quiet objects as well as radio - loud ones : the explicit inclusion of jets in our models would be an interesting extension .",
    "the starburst - black hole system is in a symbiotic relationship with the wider galaxy .",
    "we study the structure of the nuclear system in its active phase in this paper .",
    "we leave the vexed questions of the formation of the nuclear system and the details of its symbiosis with the wider galaxy to later work .",
    "this follows the tradition well established in stellar physics : first understand structure , then evolution , lastly formation .",
    "nonetheless , there are clear indications , both from observations and from theory , of possible formation scenarios @xcite .",
    "interactions between galaxies disturb the equilibrium of the ism of the galaxies , and gas can flow towards the nucleus where it can form a nuclear starburst .",
    "the size scale of the starburst depends on whether the gas can shed its angular momentum , and on whether it hangs up at a lindblad resonance @xcite .",
    "direct optical imaging of galaxies with bright active nuclei is difficult , but hst and near - ir imaging are now revealing the morphological types @xcite .",
    "radio and quasar galaxies appear to be large and luminous , and to show signs of past merger events .",
    "galaxies with radio - loud active nuclei are essentially all spheroidal , whereas those with radio - quiet cores are approximately equally divided between spheroidal and disc - dominated structures @xcite .",
    "this may indicate different interaction histories for radio - loud and radio - quiet systems .",
    "there is much circumstantial evidence that similar environmental factors influence the frequency of both active nuclei and starburst galaxies @xcite .",
    "cooling flows around massive elliptical galaxies may provide a source of fuel for both phenomena @xcite .",
    "ultraluminous ir galaxies may represent a transition phase as dense shrouds of dust lift to reveal bright optical quasar nuclei , since the environments , molecular gas content , near - ir colours and optical emission line diagnostics of the two classes are similar @xcite . processed",
    "material with near - solar metallicities in the nism is seen in agn even at the highest redshifts . at redshifts",
    "@xmath19 , absorption line studies reveal that most of the gas in galaxies typically has @xmath20 @xcite .",
    "to reach the high metal abundances observed in qsos after short cosmic times , massive star formation , probably _ in situ _ , must be intimately linked to the evolution of active galaxies @xcite .",
    "populations of star - forming galaxies at @xmath21 have now been discovered @xcite .",
    "this redshift range is hence a critical period in the evolution of both normal and quasar galaxy populations @xcite .",
    "whatever the likely formation scenario , the nism in our models reaches a structure characteristic of its long term behaviour  equilibrium , oscillations or explosions  on dynamical timescales typically a few thousand years .",
    "these timescales are much shorter than any plausible formation or evolution times @xcite , and so we treat the structure of the system independently from its formation and evolution .      our aim in this paper is to explore the hydrodynamics of those nuclear black - hole / stellar cluster systems which _ are _ active .",
    "williams summarises previous hydrodynamic models of the flow structure of active nuclei .",
    "our study is unique in that it treats the distributed mass input through the nucleus and the gravitational field of the stellar cluster .",
    "we treat the global hydrodynamics of the nism , as it interacts with the central black hole , the stellar cluster and the accretion disc .",
    "these physical components are essential to the starburst - black hole model of agn  _ and _ to most other dynamical models of active nuclei .",
    "we have chosen to simplify the properties of this system as far as possible .",
    "this approach allows us focus on the most important properties of the global hydrodynamic interactions between stellar cluster , black hole and accretion disc .",
    "independent of the detailed model , it is possible to estimate characteristic values of the flow density and velocity required for the accreting nism flow to be able to fuel the agn .",
    "pd used such simple scaling arguments to discuss the structure of the nism flow , and to investigate the consequences for the fuelling of agn and for the creation of the belr .",
    "if the local nism is too dense , it obscures the system ; if it is too diffuse , it fails to provide the necessary fuel for the agn .",
    "those flows consistent with these constraints can be shown to have ram pressures similar to the pressures deduced from observations of the broad line clouds .",
    "the ram pressure of the nism will therefore have an important dynamical effect on the belr clouds , whatever their confinement mechanism .",
    "although these simple arguments provide interesting overall constraints , many important properties of the agn depend on the structure of the flow , which pd did not address .",
    "detailed hydrodynamic modelling is necessary to determine these flow structures .",
    "more broadly , it is clearly necessary to consider the hydrodynamics of the nism in order to develop fully _ any _ model of agn .    in the absence of a black hole , in a dense stellar cluster with negligible external pressure , gas accretes onto a hydrostatic core , and a weak wind forms ( section  [ s : spherical ] ) .",
    "the core grows until it reaches the sonic radius , and the wind from the cluster increases to an equilibrium in which it transports the mass injection from the stellar cluster out into the wider galaxy .",
    "once a black hole is added to the system , with an accretion - generated radiation field , many more complex behaviours can occur , some of which we investigate in this paper .",
    "broadly , however , the black hole can accrete matter at the centre of the flow , weakening the eventual wind , and the radiation field may drive it away . in the absence of radiative",
    "driving , the sonic ( or parker ) radius is @xmath22 for a @xmath23 bh mass and gas at a temperature of @xmath24 , which is at least as large as the broad emission line region even in qsos . the velocities in pure thermally driven winds only reach @xmath25 ( the sound speed in the nism ) at such radii .",
    "such low velocities are in conflict with the strong evidence for outflowing gas in and around agn at far higher velocities , most clearly in broad absorption line qsos @xcite .",
    "if radiative driving occurs at all angles , then the hole may well be starved of fuel .",
    "this will reduce the luminosity , giving rise to a limiting feedback process .",
    "however , there is strong evidence of beaming in all agn .",
    "this asymmetry in the radiation field means that the radiation force can be greater than the gravitational attraction of the black hole on the axis of the accretion disc , but not in its plane . in such cases , mass can fall inwards towards the plane and be driven away on axis .",
    "such flows are typical of our simulations .",
    "the structures and the global kinematics of these nism flows are likely to be generic features .",
    "however , we will see that small - scale features such as gas cooling may play an important role in determining the _ observable _ properties of the flow",
    ". where cooling is significant , the average opacity of the gas will be increased , which will re - scale the importance of the central radiation field . the central broad - band ( radio to x- and @xmath3-rays ) radiation field is powered by mass accretion through a disc and down into the black hole .",
    "we model this radiation field as the sum of an unresolved point source and an accretion disc component which follows a simple cosine law .",
    "we concentrate on models appropriate to qsos , since there is wide agreement that they accrete at or near the eddington limit .",
    "in contrast , the lower luminosity seyferts appear to span a much wider range in mass - to - light ratio . we discuss the consequences of scaling our models to seyfert properties in section  [ s : seyfert ] .    because we do not model the accretion disc explicitly",
    ", the effective eddington ratio , @xmath26 , is an arbitrary input parameter .",
    "a goal of future research is to determine the relationship between @xmath26 and the properties of the nism , since this must be self - consistent ( , the accretion rate onto the central black hole must be sufficient to power the luminosity of the agn ) .",
    "the characteristics of the disc should be determined by the rest of the nuclear system .",
    "although @xmath26 changes on timescales much shorter than the evolution of the overall system , these are much longer than the dynamic timescales of the nism .",
    "it is not currently feasible to determine @xmath26 by modelling the disc and nism simultaneously .",
    "we have chosen a simplified parameterisation so we can , to first order , rescale @xmath26 , ( see section [ s : outline ] ) .",
    "the rescaled solutions will have the same global properties as the real flows .",
    "subsequent papers will fill in the important details in this picture .",
    "the flows in individual simulations are complex and varied , whilst exhibiting a generic bipolar circulation pattern .",
    "these results suggest why over 30 years of careful and detailed belr observations and simulations have failed to identify a simple , global flow geometry . if anything , real flows will be more complex , not simpler , than the flows we find here .",
    "these generic bipolar flow patterns are characterised by both an accretion inflow and a wind outflow in the nism .",
    "the gas which accretes can generate the luminosity assumed by the flow models .",
    "bipolar outflows  and even hydrodynamical jets  are generated , so long as there is sufficient outward force along the accretion disc axis .",
    "these structures will be found independent of whether the nuclei are radio - loud or radio - quiet : they are in general less collimated and lower velocity than the most dramatic radio structures observed , although when a plume of gas escapes the nucleus it may be observable as a radio structure .",
    "the strength and structure of these flows depends primarily on the ratio of the gravitational and thermal energies in the nism .",
    "some of the inflowing gas is driven away into the wider galaxy , while some may accrete onto the black hole .",
    "the wind expelled from the nucleus can carry both significant mechanical energy and heavy elements into the wider galaxy .",
    "thus , the nism flows will affect significantly the structure of the ism of the galaxy .",
    "at early times , the flows will enrich the galaxy ism and may drive shocks and shells of gas out to distances of kiloparsecs @xcite .",
    "these nism flows can only be observed indirectly .",
    "the nism itself is hot ",
    "typically @xmath27 , the compton temperature characteristic of the central radiation field  and does not give rise to observable line radiation , although limits on its column density are set by thomson optical depths .",
    "the belr is formed within the nism , and so the broad line profiles will reflect the nism velocities as well as the stellar orbital velocities . if the belr is formed behind shocks driven by the stars as they move through the nism ( as in the models of pd ) then the characteristic velocities of the line emitting material will be determined by stellar orbital , stellar mass - ejection and nism velocities .",
    "the stellar velocities will broaden the nism contribution to the line widths , but the fundamental shape and asymmetries of the lines will reflect the nism flows .",
    "empirical models of such profiles @xcite show most of the characteristics of observed line profiles and their diversity . in this paper",
    ", we study the flow structures which underly the structures determined by such empirical studies .",
    "we find that we can characterise the structure of the nuclear interstellar flows on a two - dimensional plot .",
    "this is our first step in developing a theoretical diagnostic diagram for agn flows , analogous to the hertzsprung - russell diagram which provides a systematic understanding of stellar structure .",
    "stellar spectral type , luminosity , colour and temperature  characteristics which are determined by the basic physical parameters of age , metallicity and mass  are used as the axes of the hr diagram .",
    "similarly , the axes of our plot can be expressed in a number of ways .",
    "although it would be desirable to use the fundamental physical parameters listed above as the axes , we find that the most natural variables are derived parameters which are closely related to the underlying physics ( see section  [ s : parms ] ) .",
    "we present numerical models of cylindrically symmetric , isothermal flows in black hole - starburst agn .",
    "we have used global assumptions which are physically justifiable for qsos .",
    "various local deviations from those global approximations will be examined in detail in a future paper .    in section  [",
    "s : physical ] , we specify the parameters of the physical model of a supermassive black hole and a starburst stellar cluster . in section  [ s : equations ] , we give the hydrodynamical equations and discuss their scaling behaviour and their relationships to agn observation .",
    "we also introduce the reduced set of dimensionless parameters with which we describe the gross features of the flows , to serve as a guide to the numerical models which follow .",
    "the numerical methods used to implement the hydrodynamic representation of our physical model are outlined in section  [ s : code ] .",
    "we then describe the results of our detailed modelling .",
    "first , in section  [ s : spherical ] , we describe results for purely spherical flows .",
    "we verify that our methods reproduce the analytic results , and summarise the general properties of such flows , and those described in the literature .",
    "next , in section  [ s : results ] , we present the results from our aspherical models , calculated for parameters appropriate for luminous qsos .",
    "in section  [ s : seyfert ] , we discuss models where the eddington ratio is very small , as is suggested to occur in some seyfert galaxies . in section  [",
    "s : discuss ] , we discuss these results and their physical implications in the context of the current observational and theoretical understanding of activity in galactic nuclei .",
    "we compare our results with the models of the flow structure in active nuclei of pd and perry ( 1993a ) .",
    "we sketch the global constraints on the models .",
    "readers who are most interested in the observational consequences of our work , and ways in which our model can be tested , could now turn straight to the figures in section  [ s : results ] and then read section  [ s : discuss ] , where we show that the symbiosis between a nuclear starburst stellar cluster and a supermassive accreting black hole , via the nism , provides a self - consistent model for nuclear activity in galaxies . in section  [ s : concl ] , we draw together our conclusions .    illustrative animations are available at    http://ast.leeds.ac.uk/`~`rjrw/agn.html .",

    "<S> the structure of these nism flows is principally determined by two dimensionless quantities . </S>",
    "<S> the first is the magnitude of the stellar cluster velocity dispersion relative to the sound speed in the nism . </S>",
    "<S> these speeds measure the gravitational and thermal energies in the nism respectively , and , therefore , whether the gas is initially bound , or escapes in a thermal wind . </S>",
    "<S> the second parameter is the mach number of the ill - collimated nism flow which is driven away from the central black hole . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss a two - parameter classification based on this observation which , in future papers , we will relate to empirical classifications .    </S>",
