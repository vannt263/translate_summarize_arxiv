    "cologne database for molecular spectroscopy ( cdms ) catalog @xcite keeps records on discovered molecules in interstellar medium ( ism ) . according this catalog , more",
    "than 170 molecules have been detected so far in the ism . among them , there are some simple halides like , such as , hf , cf , alf , hcl , hcl@xmath1 , nacl , kcl , alcl , mgcl etc .",
    "several works have been done in the past to model the chemistry of the chlorine - bearing molecules in both the diffuse and dense molecular clouds @xcite .",
    "various halogen elements such as fluorine and chlorine having solar abundances ( @xmath4 and @xmath5 respectively relative to total hydrogen nuclei @xcite ) play an important role towards the formation of various hydrides in the ism .",
    "dissociation energy of most of the hydrides are less than that of the hydrogen molecule , only exceptions are the diatomic hydrides , such as , hf and diatomic hydride cations , such as , hcl@xmath1 @xcite . around an ism ,",
    "most of the halogen elements are biased to form hydrides @xcite .",
    "huge abundances of hf and h@xmath0cl@xmath1 are observed around the diffuse molecular clouds @xcite .",
    "the ionization potential of chlorine is slightly less than that of the hydrogen and singly - ionized chlorine ( cl@xmath1 ) can react exothermically with h@xmath0 to form hcl@xmath1 .",
    "this hcl@xmath1 further interacts with h@xmath0 to form h@xmath0cl@xmath1 .",
    "these features are already known by theory of thermo chemistry of these species .",
    "since choloronium ion does not react with hydrogen molecule , dissociative recombination appears to be its main destruction route .",
    "chloronium ion could also be destroyed by reacting with co molecule . main product of these destruction routes is hydrogen chloride ( hcl ) .",
    "theoretical modeling by considering the chlorine bearing molecules predicts that abundances of the chloronium ions are significantly higher and could be observed .",
    "but surprisingly , before the launching of herschel , among the cl bearing molecules , only h@xmath6cl and h@xmath7cl were detected @xcite .",
    "chemical modeling suggests that chloronium ions could be very abundant around the diffuse interstellar medium .",
    "the detection of h@xmath0cl@xmath1 was first reported towards ngc 6334i and sgr b2(s ) using the hifi instrument @xcite aboard the herschel space observatory @xcite .",
    "a follow up study by @xcite also detected h@xmath0cl@xmath1 absorption towards sgr a , w31c and detected chloronium emission from two sources in the orion molecular cloud 1 ( the orion bar photodissociation region and orion south condensation ) and the young massive star afgl 2591 .    despite these overwhelmingly significant observational evidences , till date",
    ", no deuterated forms of h@xmath0cl@xmath1 have been observed in the ism .",
    "this motivates us to model the formation / destruction of different forms of deuterated h@xmath0cl@xmath1 in the ism .",
    "importance of interstellar grains in producing simpler molecules has been widely described by several authors such as @xcite .",
    "these studies indicate that dusts could play a crucial role for deciding chemical compositions around any molecular cloud . in order to understand complete picture of how molecules are formed in or around an ism",
    ", we used our large gas - grain chemical model @xcite .",
    "@xcite & @xcite performed quantum chemical simulations to find out various chemical properties of some interstellar species . in the current paper , we carry out a similar types of quantum chemical calculations to find out the spectral information ( infrared , electronic and rotational ) of different deuterated istotopomers of chloronium ion .",
    "we have also provided detailed information about rotational transitions of these species ( in the format of jpl catalog ) .",
    "such a study would be extremely helpful for the identification of these species around isms .",
    "the plan of this paper is the following : in section 2 , the models and the computational details are presented .",
    "implications of the results are discussed in section 3 . finally , in section 4 , we draw our conclusions . in appendix",
    "a , we tabulate relevant parameters for rotational spectroscopy of one of the isotopomer of h@xmath0cl@xmath1 in the format of jpl catalog .",
    "we study spectral properties of interstellar chloronium by first optimizing the geometry of chloronium using second order moller - plesset perturbation theory ( mp2 ) along with aug - cc - pvqz basis set .",
    "mp2 theory is a special case of more general many - body perturbation theory @xcite . for calculations where",
    "only valence electrons are correlated ( i.e. , frozen core calculation ) , standard cc - pvxz sets with x= d , t , q , 5 and 6 are recommended @xcite . because of this , we use here aug - cc - pvqz basis set along with mp2 method .",
    "vibrational frequencies of h@xmath0cl@xmath1 and its two deuterated isotopomers ; d@xmath0cl@xmath1 and hdcl@xmath1 are computed by determining second derivative of energy with respect to cartesian nuclear coordinates and then transforming into mass - weighted coordinates .",
    "this transformation is valid only at a stationary point .",
    "vibrational frequencies of these species in the ice phase are also obtained by using the same level of theory .",
    "vibrational spectra of any chemical species are significantly affected by the type of solvent used in the simulation . in our modeling purpose , here we have used polarizable continuum model ( pcm ) with integral equation formalism variant ( iefpcm ) as a default self - consistent reaction field ( scrf ) method @xcite .",
    "scrf method in gaussian 09w program is used to perform calculations in presence of a solvent by placing the solute in a cavity within a solvent reaction field .",
    "following @xcite , here too we have considered simple as well as mixed ice . by simple ice , we mean ice made from water molecule only and by mixed ice , we mean the ice made from water , methanol and carbon di - oxide .",
    "observations around cold dense region of molecular cloud reveal that @xmath8% of interstellar grain mantle could be covered by h@xmath0o , ch@xmath9oh and co@xmath0 @xcite . we have also carried out quantum chemical simulation ( time dependent density functional theory ) to find out electronic absorption spectrum of these species in the gas phase as well as simple ice and mixed ice phase using the iefpcm model .",
    "an important key for the successful identification of different forms of chloronium in the interstellar space depends on the availability of accurate predictions of spectroscopic constants ( rotational and distortional constants ) .",
    "our computed rotational spectral information for interstellar chloronium is based on equilibrium geometry obtained at mp2/aug - cc - pvqz level , i.e. , with the consideration of core correlation and vibrational corrections to the rotational constants .",
    "centrifugal distortion constants are computed from harmonic and anharmonic force fields obtained at mp2/aug - cc - pvqz levels of theory .",
    "in addition , computed components of dipole moment were used to predict relative intensities of rotational transitions .",
    "these spectroscopic constants are essential to predict spectrum of different forms of h@xmath0cl@xmath1 and this can be done by following techniques described in @xcite .",
    "it used picket s ` spcat ' program @xcite for this purpose .",
    "two main files , namely , ` file.var ' and ` file.int ' are required for the spcat program .",
    "specified format of these two files were explained in detail in @xcite .",
    "information regarding rotational constants , quadrupole coupling constants and distortional constants are given in ` .var ' file .",
    "contents of ` .var ' file could directly be generated from gaussian 09 program . `",
    ".int ' file is the intensity file and it is prepared according to the prescribed format of ` spcat program ' .",
    "this file contains maximum and minimum number of rotational states , partition function , rotational temperature and dipole moment of the molecule .      in order to study various forms of choloronium in an interstellar medium ( ism )",
    ", we have developed a chemical model which includes gas phase as well as grain surface chemical network .",
    "our gas phase chemical network consists of a network of @xcite and deuterated network used in @xcite .",
    "in addition , we include some deuterated reactions by following @xcite . we include certain new reactions for formation and destruction of various forms of choloronium and its related species .",
    "our present gas phase chemical network consists of 6180 reactions and present surface chemical network consists of 285 reactions . except molecular hydrogen and helium , depletion of all gas phase neutral species onto the grain surface",
    "are considered with a sticking probability of unity .",
    "the reason for ignoring this for h@xmath0 and he is that according to @xcite , the sticking coefficient of h@xmath10 and @xcite argued that helium would not stick to the grain at all . following is the list of reactions which are considered in our network for the formation / destruction of deuterated isotopomers of chloronium ion .",

    "rate coefficient for this reaction is assumed to be similar to the rate coefficient adopted for @xmath35 in @xcite .",
    "reactions a2 - a24 are ion - neutral type reactions . according to @xcite ,",
    "rate coefficients for ion - molecular reactions can be determined by using capture theories ( in which translational energy of reactants must only surpass a long - range centrifugal barrier for a reaction to occur ) .",
    "the collision rate coefficient between an ion and non - polar neutral molecule can be determined by using so - called langevin collision rate ; @xmath36 where , @xmath37 is electronic charge , @xmath38 is polarizabilty of neutral non - polar molecule , @xmath39 is reduced mass of reactants .",
    "but for polar neutral species , a complex situation arises due to attraction between a charge and a rotating permanent dipole moment . in these cases ,",
    "extensive trajectory calculations have been carried out by @xcite to predict rate coefficients ( @xmath40 ) of ion - polar molecule capture collisions . according to @xcite ,",
    "su - chesnavich formula can be written in two different ways and both of which uses a parameter @xmath41 where k is boltzman constant & t is the temperature .",
    "the ion - dipole ( @xmath40 ) rates can be parameterized using following equations : @xmath42 and @xmath43 k_l.\\ ] ] equation 2 is used if @xmath44 and eqn .",
    "3 is used if @xmath45 . note that for @xmath46 , it reduces to the langevin expression .",
    "alternatively , the expression can be written in powers of temperature t. for example , when @xmath47 , @xmath48 where , @xmath49 and @xmath50 . if the second term in eqn .",
    "4 is much greater than the first term , the expression has @xmath51 dependence which is used in both the umist and osu databases .",
    "we took values of polarizability and dipole moments of neutral species by following woon & herbst ( 2009 ) .",
    "they optimized equilibrium structures at rccsd(t)/aug - cc - pvtz level of theory using finite field approach to obtain dipole moment and dipole polarizability components .",
    "according to their calculations , values of the polarizabilities ( @xmath52 ) for hcl , h@xmath0o , h@xmath0 , co , nh@xmath9 are to be 2.538 , 1.406 , 0.773 , 1.951 and 2.087 @xmath53 respectively and values of the dipole moments ( @xmath54 ) for hcl , h@xmath0o , h@xmath0 , co , nh@xmath9 are to be 1.075 , 1.845 , 0 , 0.101 , 1.519 debye respectively .",
    "now , computation of polarizability and dipole moments depend on the derivatives of electronic energy with respect to external electric field .",
    "this electronic energy is not dependent on the mass of the nuclei as calculations are based on born - oppenheimer approximation .",
    "but experimental difference arises mostly from difference in vibrationally averaged structure . in our case ,",
    "polarizability and dipole moments of hd , d@xmath0 , dcl , nh@xmath0d are assumed to be similar to their hydrogenated counter part . plugging these values ( polarizability and dipole moment of the neutral species and reduced mass of the reactants ) in above equations , we calculated reaction rates for the ion - neutral reactions ( a2-a24 ) .",
    "molecular ions could be destroyed by the following dissociative recombination reactions : @xmath55 @xmath56 @xmath57 @xmath58 @xmath59 in the absence of experimentally determined rate coefficients , following @xcite , we use eqns . 5 & 6 for computation of dr rate coefficients ( a25-a29 ) for diatomic and triatomic molecular ions , namely , @xmath60 and @xmath61    following the destruction pathways of hcl @xcite , we have assumed that dcl could also be destroyed by cosmic ray induced(crphot ) photo reactions ; @xmath62 the rate of cosmic ray induced photo - reaction ( a30 ) could be adopted as follows : @xmath63 where , cosmic - ray ionization rate is denoted by @xmath52 , photo reaction probability per cosmic ray ionization is denoted by @xmath64 and @xmath65 denotes reflection coefficients of dust grain in far uv . following reaction @xmath66 in @xcite , here",

    "the ground state energy of d@xmath0cl@xmath3 and hdcl@xmath3 are found to be similar to the ground state energy of h@xmath0cl@xmath3 in gas and in ice phases .",
    "this is due to the fact that ground state energy and structure calculations are made by using born - oppenheimer approximation so isotopic mass is not a factor in the hamiltonian .",
    "the dipole moment of chloronium in gas and in ice phases are found to be 1.98 debye and 2.2024 debye respectively .",
    "the dipole moment of chloronium has been estimated as 1.89 debye in _ ab initio _",
    "calculations performed by @xcite . according to @xcite ,",
    "additional splitting in rotational spectrum is governed by nuclear quadrupole coupling of molecules . moreover , according to them , quantum chemical calculations could be extremely helpful for fine structure analysis because it could provide electric - field gradient at corresponding nuclei . in table 3 , we show a comparison of experiment and theoretical ground state quadrupole coupling constants of chlorine h@xmath0cl@xmath3 for mp2/aug - cc - pvqz level of theory .",
