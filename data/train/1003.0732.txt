    "recently , the experimental realization of a stable single layer of carbon atoms densely packed in a honeycomb lattice has aroused considerable interest in study of their electronic properties novoselov2004,zhang2005 .",
    "such kind of material is well known as graphene , and the low - energy charge carriers in pristine graphene are formally described by a massless dirac equation with many unusual properties near the dirac point where the valence band and conduction band touch each other novoselov2004,zhang2005,novoselov2005a , katsnelson2006,reviews , such as the linear energy dispersion , the chiral behaviour , ballistic conduction and unusual quantum hall effect @xcite , frequency - dependent conductivity @xcite , gate - tunable optical transitions @xcite , and so on .",
    "most recently , there have been a number of interesting theoretical invesitigations on the graphene supperlatices with periodic potential or barrier structures , which can be generated by diffierent methods such as electrostatic potentials @xcite and magnetic barriers ramezanimasir2008,ramezanimasir2009,dellanna2009,ghosh2009 .",
    "sometimes periodic arrays of corrugations @xcite have also been proposed as graphene superlattices .",
    "it is well known that the supperlattices are very sucessful in controlling the electronic structures of many conventional semiconducting materials ( e.g. see ref .",
    "@xcite ) . in graphene - based superlattices",
    ", researchers have found that a one - dimensional ( 1d ) periodic - potential superlattice may result in the strong anisotropy for the low - energy charge carriers group velocities that are reduced to zero in one direction but are unchanged in another park2008b .",
    "furthermore , brey and fertig @xcite have shown that such behavior of the anisotropy is a precursor to the formation of further dirac points in the electronic band structures and new zero energy states are controlled by the parameters of the periodic potentials",
    ". meanwhile , park _ et al . _",
    "@xcite pointed out that new massless dirac fermions , which are absent in pristine graphene , could be generated when a slowly varying periodic potential is applied to graphene ; and they further found the unusual properties of landau levels and the quantum hall effect near these new dirac fermions , which are adjustable by the superlattic potential parameters @xcite .",
    "finally it should also be mentioned that the electronic transmission and conductance through a graphene - based kronig - penney potential have been recently studied @xcite and the tunable band gap could be obtained in graphene with a noncentrosymmetric superlattice potential @xcite .",
    "graphene superlattices are not only of theoretical interest , but also have been experimental realized .",
    "for example , superlattice patterns with periodicity as small as 5 nm have been imprinted on graphene using the electron - beam induced deposition @xcite .",
    "epitaxially grown graphenes on metal ( ruthenium or iridium ) surfaces marchini2007,vazquezdeparga2008,pan2008,sutter2008,martoccia2008,coraux2008,pletikosic2009 also show superlattice patterns with several nanometers ( about 3 nm to 10 nm ) lattice period .",
    "fabrication of periodically patterned gate electrodes is another possible way of making the graphene - based superlattices .",
    "motived by these studies , in this paper , we will consider the robust properties of the electronic bandgap structures and transport properties for the graphene under the external periodic potentials by applying appropriate gate voltages .",
    "following the previous work @xcite , we evaluate the effects of the lattice constants , the angles of the incident charge carriers , the structural disorders and the defect potentials on the properties of electronic band structures and transmissions .",
    "it is found that a new dirac point is exactly located at the energy with the zero ( volume ) averaged wavenumber inside the 1d periodic potentials , and the location of such a new dirac point is not dependent on lattice constants but dependent on the ratio of potential widths ; and the position of the associated zero - averaged wavenumber gap near the new dirac point is not only independent of lattice constants but is also weakly dependent on the incident angles . with the increasing of the lattice contants ,",
    "the zero - averaged wavenumber gap will open and close oscillationaly but the center position of this gap does not depend on the lattice constants .",
    "furthermore it is shown that the zero - averaged wavenumber gap is insensitive to the structural disorder , while the other opened gaps in 1d periodic potentials are highly sensitive to the structural disorder .",
    "finally we also find that the defect mode inside the zero - averaged wavenumber gap is weakly dependent on the insident angles while the defect mode in other gaps are highly dependent on the incident angles .",
    "the outline of this paper is the following . in sec .",
    "ii , with the help of the additional two - component basis , we introduce a new transfer matrix method , which is different from that in ref .",
    "@xcite , to calculate the reflection , transmission , and the evolution of the wave function ; our transfer matrix method is very useful to deal with the periodic- or multi - squared potentials . in sec .",
    "iii , the various effects of the lattice constants , the incident angles of carriers , and the structural disorders on the electronic band structures are discussed in detail ; furthermore the transport properties of the defect mode inside the zero - averaged wavenumber gap are also discussed . finally , in sec .",
    "iv , we summarize our results and draw our conclusions .",

    ", we will discuss the properties of the electronic band structure and transmission for the graphene - based periodic squared potential structures .",
    "in this section , we would like to discuss some unique properties of the band structures in the graphene - based periodic - potential systems by using the above transfer method .",

    "then if @xmath113 , the above equation ( bg100 ) becomes@xmath114=1+\\frac{[1-\\cos ( 2\\theta _ { a})]}{\\cos ^{2}\\theta _ { a}}%    when @xmath115 and @xmath116 , there is no real solution for @xmath117 , i.e. , exsiting a bandgap ; note this bandgap will be close at normal incident case ( @xmath118 ) from eq .",
    "( [ bg111 ] ) .",
    "therefore , the location of the touching point of the bands is exactly given by @xmath113 at @xmath119 , i. e.,@xmath120 or @xmath121 .",
    "figure 2 shows clearly that a band gap opens exactly at energy @xmath122mev under the inclined incident angles ( i.e. , @xmath123 ) , where the condition @xmath124 is satisfied . at the case of normal incidence ( @xmath125 ) ,",
    "the upper and lower bands linearly touch together and form a new double - cone dirac point .",
    "the location of the new dirac point is governed by the equality : @xmath121 . for the graphene - based periodic - barrier structure with @xmath126 and @xmath127 ,",
    "the new dirac point is exactly located at @xmath128 . from fig .",
    "2(a - c ) , one can also find that the location of the new dirac point is independent of the lattice constants ; and the position of the the opened gap associated with the new dirac point is not only independent of the lattice constants but also is weakly dependent on the incident angles [ also see the transmission curves in figs .",
    "3a and 3b for the finite structures , for example , @xmath129 ; while other bandgap structuers are not only dependent on the lattice contants but also strongly dependent on different angles ( i. e. , different @xmath46 ) .",
    "the properties of the opened gap associated with the new dirac point are very similar to that in the one - dimensional photonic crystals containing the left - haned materials @xcite , where the so - called zero ( volumn ) averaged index gap is independent of the lattice constant but only dependent on the ratio of the thicknesses of the right- and left - handed materials li2003 . from fig . 4",
    ", one can also find that the locations of both the new dirac point and the opened gap are determined by the ratio value of @xmath130 for the cases with the fixed heights @xmath131 of the potentials . from the above discussion",
    ", we find that the volume - averaged wavenumber at the energy of the new dirac point is zero , therefore such a opened gap associated with the new dirac point may be called as the zero - averaged wavenumber gap .    from figs . 2(a - c ) and 5(a - c ) , one can also noted that the slope of the band edges near the new dirac point gradually becomes smaller as the lattice constant increases under the fixed ratio @xmath132 and the fixed potential height , and such phenomena have been pointed out in recent work by brey and fertig @xcite .",
    "actually , from eq .",
    "( [ bg100 ] ) , we can see that as the values of @xmath133 and @xmath134 gradually reach the values of @xmath135 ( @xmath136 ) , the slope of the band edges near the new dirac point becomes smaller [ see figs .",
    "2(a - c ) and 5(a - c ) ] ; once the condition @xmath137 is satisfied , the zero - averaged wavenumber gap will be close and a pair of new zero - averaged wavenumber states emerges from @xmath138 [ see fig .",
    "5(c ) ] . here",
    "we would like to emphasize that the properties of these novel zero - averaged wavenumber states are similar to that of the zero - energy states in the previous work brey2009 .",
    "figure 5(d ) shows how the zero - averaged wavenumber gap does gradually close with the increasing of the lattice constant under the fixed transversal wavenumber @xmath139nm@xmath140 and the fixed ratio @xmath141 . from fig .",
    "5(d ) , one can find that the zero - averaged wavenumber gap is very speical and it is open and close oscillationly with the increasing of the lattice constant , and the center position of the zero - averaged wavenumber gap is also independent of the lattice constant .",
    "however , the other opened gaps are largely shifted with the increasing of the lattice constant",
    ".    now we turn to consider the transmission of an electron passing through a finite graphene - based periodic - potential structure , e. g. , @xmath142 , with the width deviation under different incident angles .",
    "figure 6 shows the effect of the structural disorder on electronic transimitivities .",
    "figures 6a , 6b and 6c correspond to the transmissions through the periodic - potential structures with the width deviation ( random uniform deviate ) of @xmath143 nm , @xmath144 nm , and @xmath145 nm , respectively . from figs .",
    "( 6a)-(6c ) , it is clear that the higher opened gap is destroyed by strong disorder , but the zero - averaged wavenumber gap survives .",
    "the robustness of the zero - averaged wavenumber gap comes from the fact that the zero - averaged wavenumber solution remains invariant under disorder that is symmetric ( @xmath146 and @xmath147 equally probable ) .",
    "it should be emphasized again that the position of the zero - averaged wavenumber gap near the new dirac point is insensitive to both the incident angles and the disorder .",
    "[ see fig . 3b and fig .",
    "6 ] .    finally , we turn our attention to the effect of a defect potential on the property of the electron s transport inside the zero - averaged wavenumber gap . here",
    "we consider the transmission of an electron passing through a graphene - based periodic potential structure with a defect potential , e. g. , @xmath148 where the symbol `` d '' denotes the defect barrier . in fig .",
    "7(a ) , it shows the electronic transmitivity through the structure under different incident angles .",
    "one can see that there is a defect mode respectively occuring inside the zero - averaged wavenumber gap and the higher bandgap , and the location of the defect mode inside the zero - averaged wavenumber gap is very weakly dependent on the incident angle but the defect mode in the higher bandgap is strongly sensitive to the incident angle .",
    "it is clear shown in fig .",
    "7(b ) that the energy of the defect mode inside the zero - averaged wavenumber gap is almost independent of the angles while the location of the defect mode in the higher bandgap has a large shift with the increasing of the incident angle .",
    "in summary , we studied the electronic band structures and transmission of carriers in the graphene - based 1d periodic squared - potential superlattices . for the 1d periodic squared - potential structure",
    ", it is found that a new dirac point does exactly occurs at the energy that corresponds to the zero ( volume ) averaged wavenumber inside the system , and the location of such a new dirac point is independent of lattice constants but dependent on the ratio of potential widths .",
    "it is also shown that the location of the zero - averaged wavenumber gap associated with the new dirac point is not only independent of lattice constants but is also weakly dependent on the incident angles .",
    "as the lattice constant increases for the structures with the fixed ratio of potential widths , this zero - averaged wavenumber gap is open and close oscillationaly around the energy of the new dirac point .",
    "we further showed the robustness of the zero - averaged wavenumber gap against the structural disorder , which has a sensitive effect on other opened gaps of the system .",
    "finally we saw that the defect mode inside the zero - averaged wavenumber gap is weakly dependent on the insident angles while the defect mode in other gaps are highly dependent on the incident angles .",
