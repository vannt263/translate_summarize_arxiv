    "the rare earths , across which the 4@xmath5 level fills , provide an enormous range of interesting and potentially exploitable spin / orbit physics .",
    "in elemental form they are metallic , but they are also prominent as the sites of magnetic order in a variety of insulating compounds , where furthermore transitions among internal spin - orbit configurations in their 4@xmath5 shells allow for a rich optical activity .",
    "recently there has been a renewed interest in these elements in their simple nacl structured mononitrides , with theoretical suggestions of ferromagnetic ( fm ) semiconductors and half metals .",
    "@xcite experimental verification of the predictions is lacking for most of the series , though recent studies have identified several as intrinsic fm semiconductors .",
    "the most thoroughly studied is gdn , lying at the centre of the series .",
    "the half - filled 4@xmath5 shell on the gd@xmath2 ions have ( l , s ) of ( 0,7/2 ) ( @xmath6s@xmath7 ) and a magnetic moment of 7  @xmath8 .",
    "gdn is fm below a curie temperature ( t@xmath9 ) most often found to be near 65 - 70 k , and with 32 aligned gd ions per nm@xmath10 it has one of the largest magnetizations known .",
    "@xcite the next lightest rare - earth , eu@xmath2 , has a j = 0 ground state ( @xmath11f@xmath12 ) , which then prevents any magnetic order , though its propensity for mixed valence leads to unusual magnetic behaviour in eun .",
    "@xcite sm@xmath2 , at one lighter again , has a ground state of @xmath0h@xmath1 and a 4@xmath5 magnetic moment of @xmath13 . in the free ion",
    "the moment is 0.8  @xmath8 , but it is commonly smaller in the crystal fields of solids .",
    "the earliest magnetic investigations of smn , performed forty years ago , found a very small moment below a transition near 25 k. it was then assigned as antiferromagnetic based on a vanishingly small net moment in the ordered phase .",
    "@xcite subsequently a neutron scattering study suggested instead a fm phase with near cancellation between the spin and orbital moments .",
    "@xcite a fm state with a 27 k t@xmath9 has recently been confirmed by magnetisation data on a thin film .",
    "@xcite that study showed that in the crystal field of smn the paramagnetic ( pm ) moment is 0.45  @xmath8 , smaller than the free ion moment . in the fm state it drops to the remarkably small value of @xmath14 .",
    "the moment then couples only weakly to an external field , so that the coercive field rises above the 6  t limit that was available in the reported squid study .    in the past decade",
    "there have been a number of reports devoted to metallic sm compounds that similarly have near zero net moments in their fm phases .",
    "@xcite in these , as in smn , the 4@xmath5 spins order ferromagnetically but with the resulting spin moment largely cancelled by the 4@xmath5 orbital contribution .",
    "in addition to the intrinsic fundamental interest in such moment - free fm materials , these show promise as fringe - field free sources of spin - polarised electrons for injection into conventional semiconductors , or for super - hard fm layers to pin the moments of softer magnetic layers . among these small - moment fm materials , smal@xmath15 has had special attention .",
    "it has a modest net moment in the fm phase of 0.26  @xmath8 per formula unit , oriented anti - parallel with the 4@xmath5 spin moment and thus parallel with the 4@xmath5 orbital moment .",
    "its net moment is larger by a factor of about 5 in comparison with , for example , smzn or smcd , but in contrast these have net moments that are parallel to the 4@xmath5 spin moment .",
    "@xcite it is that difference that has encouraged the attention paid to smal@xmath15 , for the ease with which the spin moment can be increased , with the introduction of substitutional gd ions , to fully compensate the orbital moment .",
    "@xcite since in any case the net 4@xmath5 moment on sm@xmath2 shows a temperature dependence from admixture with the j=7/2 excited state at 1500 k , exact compensation finally occurs at only one crossover temperature .",
    "it will be shown below that fm smn shares with smal@xmath15 the character that the net moment lies antiparallel to the 4@xmath5 spin moment .",
    "interestingly an lsda+@xmath4 ( local spin density approximation with hubbard - u corrections ) calculation also suggests a moment of 0.03  @xmath8 per sm ion in the fm phase of smn .",
    "@xcite that remarkably small moment results from not only a near cancellation between 4@xmath5 spin and orbital contributions , each of about 5  @xmath8 , but also has contributions of order 0.1  @xmath8 from the sm 5@xmath16 and n 2@xmath17 shells .",
    "the agreement is surprising , in view of the @xmath18 computational accuracy that would be required .",
    "the calculation gave a net magnetisation coincident with the 4@xmath5 spin moment direction , which would then prevent the use of gd to achieve complete cancellation .",
    "the magnetisation measurements do not reveal whether the 4@xmath5 spin or orbital moment dominates , so for that we turn to the present x - ray magnetic circular dichroism ( xmcd ) investigation .",
    "the conducting characteristics of smn , unlike smal@xmath15 , smzn or smcd , points to it being a semiconductor , as appears to be common among the rare - earth nitrides .",
    "@xcite the implication is that the fm state relies on indirect inter - ion 4@xmath5 exchange involving the sm 5@xmath16 and n 2@xmath17 orbitals , leading to a lower t@xmath9 than in metallic compounds .",
    "clearly fm semiconductors will show distinct advantages for integration with conventional semiconductors , such as the possibility of impedance matching for spin injection .",
    "the very small moment of smn makes conventional magnetometer studies especially difficult , which as discussed above led to a long - term uncertainty concerning the magnetic order in smn .",
    "the problem is exacerbated in thin film geometries that are of current interest for devices , for there is then very little material available for the measurement .",
    "in contrast xmcd measures not the total moment but rather probes the spin- and orbital - moments independently , with atomic - species and orbital - shell selectivity .",
    "we thus have investigated smn using xmcd at the sm l@xmath3 edges , which concerns a 2@xmath19 promotion of an electron on the sm@xmath2 ion .",
    "work at the m@xmath20 edges would access the 4@xmath5 moments directly , but the short attenuation length of 1 kev electrons renders the study problematic through the passivating cap that is required to prevent oxidation in the rare - earth nitrides .",
    "however , the strong intra - ion 4@xmath5 - 5@xmath16 exchange interaction facilitates the l - edge investigation of the 4@xmath5 spin alignment through the passivating cap .",
    "the l - edge results then benefit from comparison with calculated xmcd spectra to extract reliable 4@xmath5 alignment information .",
    "the calculation references the xmcd spectrum to the 4@xmath5 spin alignment , while the data are referenced to the applied field direction , and this permits for the determination of the spin alignment relative to the applied field .",
    "the epitaxial smn film used in this study was grown by evaporating sm in the presence of nitrogen gas onto ( 111 ) mgo held at a temperature of @xmath21400 @xmath22c .",
    "the ( 111)-oriented film was grown at a rate of 100 nm hr@xmath23 with a pressure of 10@xmath24 mbar of n@xmath15 ; under these conditions the ratio of n@xmath15 to sm flux on the substrate is about 200 . after completing the growth ,",
    "the films were capped _ in situ _ with aln .",
    "the film growth was monitored by reflection high - energy electron diffraction ( rheed ) to confirm the epitaxial nature of the films , and subsequent _ ex situ _ x - ray diffraction confirmed the orientation and high crystalline quality .",
    "x - ray - absorption spectroscopy ( xas ) and xmcd measurements were performed at the sm l@xmath3 edges on the id12 beam line at the european synchrotron radiation facility in grenoble .",
    "the signal was detected by total fluorescence yield for which the capping layer is not an impediment at l - edge energies .",
    "the film was mounted at close to grazing incidence on the cold finger of a he gas constant flow cryostat , which has been inserted in the bore of a 6  t superconducting split - coil magnet .",
    "temperature was monitored closely adjacent to the sample on the cold finger .",
    "the band structure and xmcd calculations have been performed for the face - centered cubic structure of sodium chloride ( space group @xmath25 , no .",
    "225 ) with lattice constant @xmath26=5.1   using fully relativistic spin - polarized linear - muffin - tin - orbital ( lmto ) method  @xcite with the combined correction term taken into account .",
    "we used the perdew - wang  @xcite parametrization for the exchange - correlation potential .",
    "brillouin zone integrations were performed using the improved tetrahedron method  @xcite and charge self - consistency was obtained with 349 irreducible @xmath27 points . to improve the potential we include additional empty spheres . the basis consisted of sm @xmath28 , @xmath17 , @xmath16 and @xmath5 ; n @xmath28 , @xmath17 , and @xmath16 ; and empty sphere @xmath28 and @xmath17 lmto s .",

    "the finite resolution of the spectrometer has been accounted for by convolution with a gaussian of width 0.6 ev .    in order to simplify the comparison of the theoretical x - ray isotropic absorption spectra of smn to the experimental ones we take into account the background intensity which affects the high energy part of the spectra and",
    "is caused by different kinds of inelastic scattering of the electron promoted to the conduction band above the fermi level due to x - ray absorption ( scattering on potentials of surrounding atoms , defects , phonons , etc . ) . to calculate the background spectra we used the model proposed by richtmyer _",

    "sm l@xmath3 xas and xmcd spectra taken at a temperature of 15  k and in a 6  t magnetic field are compared in fig .",
    "[ fig : xasandxmcd ] with simulated spectra .",
    "the computed xas spectra were adjusted to be in quantitative agreement with the experimental results to achieve an excellent match .",
    "the data and calculation both refer to the fm phase , but xas data taken at higher temperature show no significant difference in the pm phase .",
    "both the computed and experimental xmcd are normalised to the xas results , so one can make absolute amplitude as well as spectral comparisons . here the agreement is imperfect , so in fig .",
    "[ fig : xasandxmcd ] the computed xmcd spectra have been scaled by the factors listed in the figure to fit at least the most prominent features in the data . in the case of l@xmath15 xmcd ,",
    "the agreement is adequate if we scale by only -1 ; i.e. , the spectral shape and amplitude are in reasonable agreement , but the sign is incorrect .",
    "a similar sign change applies to the l@xmath31 edge , though in this case the measured amplitude is a factor of three smaller and there are further features at lower energy ; these will be discussed below .",
    "the calculation sets the spin axis coincident with that about which the helicity is defined , but in contrast the experimental convention is to set the applied field antiparallel to the x - ray propagation direction .",
    "@xcite the two definitions coincide when the spin moments are aligned directly by the field , so the sign difference here immediately identifies the spin direction as lying along the field ; the spin magnetic moment is aligned in opposition to the field .",
    "the argument is not new ; note that the sign of sm xmcd has already been used to investigate the alignment in smal@xmath15 ,  @xcite and furthermore it is in agreement with data on gdn , where there is no doubt that the spin moment aligns with the field .",
    "@xcite the net magnetic moment in smn lies along the 4@xmath5 orbital magnetic moment .    aside from a sign reversal , it is notable that the xmcd signal is larger by nearly a factor of ten at l@xmath15 than at l@xmath31 .",
    "such an unbalanced branching ratio is not uncommon for the light rare earths , and results from a dependence of the 5@xmath16 orbital cloud on the 4@xmath5 - 5@xmath16 exchange ; the majority spin orbital is slightly more localised toward the nucleus than that of the minority spin , and hence it overlaps the @xmath32 orbital more strongly .  @xcite that is also reflected in the lsda+@xmath4 simulation of fig .",
    "[ fig : xasandxmcd ] , although the l@xmath15:l@xmath31 ratio is underestimated to be @xmath33 .",
    "furthermore there is a strong electric quadrupole ( 2@xmath34 ) signal extending to some 12 ev lower in energy . in part",
    "the prominence of the quadrupole signal at l@xmath31 follows the weakening of the 2@xmath19 electric dipole signal in the light rare earths .",
    "@xcite the lowest energy 4@xmath5 states within the band structure of smn do not lie so far as 12 ev below the 5@xmath16 conduction band ,  @xcite but the 4@xmath5 xas / xmcd features are shifted lower in energy because the 4@xmath5 electrons interact more strongly with the core hole .",
    "@xcite it is notable that the quadrupole signal follows the dipole signal closely as the temperature is raised ; the polarisation of the 5@xmath16 shell is as expected determined by intra - atomic 4@xmath5 - 5@xmath16 exchange .",

    "[ fig : xmcdvst ] is a comparison of the l@xmath15 and l@xmath31 edge spectra collected in the fm phase at 15 and 25  k , and at 50 k in the pm phase .",
    "the spectral shape and sign is unchanged across that temperature range , implying that the net moment lies along the 4@xmath5 orbital and antiparallel to the 4@xmath5 spin moment in the pm as well as the fm phase .",
    "the data show a reduction by a factor of 2 between 15 and 25 k , in agreement with the 27 k t@xmath35 in smn .",
    "the signal dies away further in the pm phase at 50 k. the hysteresis at 15 k ( fig .",

    "the 7 @xmath8 spin on gd@xmath2 ensures that its alignment is along the applied field .",

    "the data are interpreted with the aid of an lsda+@xmath4 calculation of the l@xmath3 edge xmcd . except for the sign the calculated and measured xmcd spectra are in excellent agreement at the l@xmath15 , but they differ by a factor of three at the l@xmath31 edge , related to the unusual branching ratio for these transitions .",
    "there is also a prominent quadrupolar feature at the l@xmath31 edge , with a visibility that is enhanced by the relatively weak dipolar spectrum at that edge .",
    "smn is known to possess a strikingly small fm moment of about 0.03  @xmath8 per sm ion ; the 4@xmath5 spin and orbital magnetic moments cancel to within less than 1  % of their individual magnitudes .",
