    "understanding the explosion mechanism of core - collapse supernovae is a challenging problem , that requires extensive researches in nuclear physics and astrophysics . in order to reach the final answer ,",
    "it is necessary to investigate the core - collapse supernovae by implementing hydrodynamics and neutrino - transfer together with reliable nuclear equation of states and neutrino - related reactions . in this",
    "regard , recent numerical simulations of neutrino - transfer hydrodynamics @xcite have cast a light to the importance of nuclear physics as well as neutrino - transfer , though they show no explosion at the moment .",
    "meanwhile , advances in physics of unstable nuclei have given chances to provide us with nuclear physics in supernovae than ever before , therefore , those new nuclear data should be examined in modern supernova simulations . in this paper , we focus on the influence of the new nuclear equation of state ( eos ) in the neutrino - transfer hydrodynamics .",
    "we follow the core - collapse , bounce and shock propagation by adopting the new equation of state , which is based on the data of unstable nuclei , and the conventional one which has been used almost uniquely in recent simulations .",
    "we compare the behavior of shock and the thermal evolution of supernova core by performing numerical simulations for a long period of @xmath01 sec after the core bounce .",
    "recently , a new complete set of eos for supernova simulations ( shen s eos ) has become available @xcite .",
    "the relativistic mean field ( rmf ) theory with a local density approximation has been applied to the derivation of the supernova eos table .",
    "the rmf theory has been successful to reproduce the saturation properties , masses and radii of nuclei , and proton - nucleus scattering data @xcite . the effective interaction used in the rmf theory",
    "is checked by the recent experimental data of unstable nuclei in neutron - rich environment close to astrophysical situations @xcite .",
    "we stress that the rmf theory @xcite is based on the relativistic brckner - hartree - fock ( rbhf ) theory @xcite .",
    "the rbhf theory , which is a microscopic and relativistic many body theory , has been shown to be successful to reproduce the saturation of nuclear matter starting from the nucleon - nucleon interactions determined by scattering experiments .",
    "this is in good contrast with non - relativistic many body frameworks which can account for the saturation only with the introduction of extra three - body interactions .    the rmf framework with the parameter set tm1 , which was determined as the best one to reproduce the properties of finite nuclei including n - rich ones @xcite , provides the uniform nuclear matter with the incompressibility of 281 mev and the symmetry energy of 36.9 mev .",
    "the maximum neutron star mass calculated for the cold neutron star matter in the rmf with tm1 is 2.2 m@xmath1 @xcite .",
    "the table of eos covers the wide range of density , electron fraction and temperature , which is necessary for supernova simulations .",
    "the relativistic eos table has been applied to numerical simulations of r - process in neutrino - driven winds @xcite and prompt supernova explosions @xcite , and other simulations @xcite .    for comparison , we adopt also the eos by lattimer and swesty @xcite .",
    "the eos is based on the compressible liquid drop model for nuclei together with dripped nucleons .",
    "the bulk energy of nuclear matter is expressed in terms of density , proton fraction and temperature with nuclear parameters .",
    "the values of nuclear parameters are chosen to be the ones suggested from nuclear mass formulae and other theoretical studies with the skyrme interaction . among various parameters ,",
    "the symmetry energy is set to be 29.3 mev , which is smaller than the value in the relativistic eos . as for the incompressibility",
    ", we use the eos with 180 mev , which has been often used for recent supernova simulations .",
    "we have developed a new numerical code of neutrino - transfer hydrodynamics @xcite for supernova simulations .",
    "the code solves hydrodynamics and neutrino - transfer at once in general relativity under the spherical symmetry .",
    "the boltzmann equation for neutrinos is solved by a finite difference scheme ( s@xmath2 method ) together with lagrangian hydrodynamics in the implicit manner .",
    "the implicit method enables us to have a longer time step than the explicit method , therefore , our code is advantageous to follow long term behaviors after the core bounce .",
    "we adopt 127 spatial zones and discretize the neutrino distribution function with 6 angle zones and 14 energy zones for @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 , respectively .",
    "the weak interaction rates regarding neutrinos are based on the _ standard _",
    "rates by bruenn @xcite .",
    "in addition to the bruenn s standard neutrino processes , the plasmon process and the nucleon - nucleon bremsstralung processes are included @xcite .",
    "the collision term of the boltzmann equation is explicitly calculated as functions of neutrino angles and energies . as an initial model",
    ", we adopt the profile of iron core of a 15m@xmath1 progenitor from woosley and weaver @xcite .",
    "we perform the numerical simulations with shen s eos ( denoted by sh ) and lattimer - swesty eos ( ls ) for comparisons .",
    "it is remarkable that the explosion does not occur in the model sh , i.e. the case with the new eos table , and the shock wave stalls in a similar manner as the model ls .",
    "we have found , however , that there are quantitative differences in core - collapse and bounce due to the differences between nuclear eoss .",
    "the peak central density at the bounce in the case of sh is 3.3@xmath710@xmath8 g/@xmath9 , which is lower than 4.2@xmath710@xmath8 g/@xmath9 in the case of ls .",
    "it is to be noted that , in microscopic many body calculations , the relativistic eos ( including shen s eos ) is generally stiffer @xcite than the non - relativistic eos , on which lattimer - swesty eos is based .",
    "the stiff eos is not advantageous in a simple argument of initial shock energy , however , the symmetry energy of eos also plays an important role @xcite . having a larger symmetry energy ,",
    "free - proton fractions during collapse in sh are smaller than in ls .",
    "smaller free - proton fractions lead to smaller electron capture rates when electron captures on nuclei are suppressed . because of this difference , the trapped lepton fraction at the bounce in sh is 0.35 at center , which is slightly larger than 0.34 in ls . in the current simulations ,",
    "this difference of lepton fraction does not change the size of bounce core significantly .    as a result ,",
    "the shock in sh does not reach at a significantly larger radius than in ls ( fig .",
    "[ fig : radius ] ) .",
    "the shock stalls below 200 km and starts receding in two cases .",
    "the central core becomes a proto - neutron star having a radius of several tens km and a steady accretion shock is formed .",
    "the difference of eos becomes apparent having a more compact star for ls with the central density of 6.0@xmath710@xmath8 g/@xmath9 ( 3.9@xmath710@xmath8 g/@xmath9 for sh ) at 600 ms after the bounce .",
    "the peak structure of temperature at around 10 km is formed and the peak temperature reaches at @xmath040 and @xmath050 mev for sh and ls , respectively , due to the gradual compression of core having accretion ( fig .",
    "[ fig : profile ] ) .",
    "it is noticeable that negative gradients in entropy and lepton fraction appear by this stage , suggesting the importance of convection .",
    "these differences of thermal structure may give influences on shock dynamics , supernova neutrinos and proto - neutron star cooling .",
    "further details of the full numerical simulations will be published elsewhere @xcite .",
