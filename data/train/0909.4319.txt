    "optical quantum technologies such as quantum computation , quantum sensing , and quantum cryptography make use of the intrinsic quantum - mechanical behavior of non - classical light , such as quadrature - squeezed , precise photon - number , or entangled photon - pair states to surpass the performance afforded by classical light .",
    "proposals have been made that use frequency entanglement between photon pairs to enhance timing measurements @xcite , improve clock synchronization @xcite , and cancel dispersion in interferometers @xcite .",
    "frequency - time entangled photon pairs have also been used in fundamental tests of quantum mechanics itself , e.g. through violation of bell inequalities @xcite .",

    "must be controlled , including the spatial , spectral , and polarization degrees of freedom .",
    "the most widespread sources of non - classical light have been based on nonlinear optical interactions , especially parametric downconversion ( pdc ) and four - wave mixing ( fwm ) , both in the stimulated and spontaneous regimes .",
    "historically , spontaneous pdc ( spdc ) has been the work horse for quantum experiments due to the relative ease of experimental setup , inexpensive and widely available equipment , and a high yield of usable photon pairs .",
    "more recently , waveguide spdc has been developed to take advantage of increased spectral flexibility , dramatically increased brightness and the ability to mode match into optical fibers @xcite .",
    "waveguided sources can be significantly brighter than bulk sources ( per mw of pump power ) due in part to the strong transverse spatial confinement of the pump ( which increases the interaction strength ) and longer guide lengths available for conversion ( which increases the interaction length ) .",
    "however , spdc in both bulk crystals and waveguides is limited by the natural dispersion of the nonlinear optical materials to spectral domains in which birefringent or quasi - phase matching can be accomplished @xcite .",
    "further , bulk crystal sources are usually multi - mode in character @xcite and demand careful alignment and pump configuration @xcite .",
    "recent progress in photon - pair generation by spontaneous fwm ( sfwm ) in optical fibers has gained much attention @xcite .",
    "fiber sources are expected to be better suited for integration with optical - fiber and waveguide networks that are being developed for quantum information protocols @xcite , because of the similar spatial modes of the sources and networks .",
    "there have been three distinct approaches , aside from the scheme presented here , for the production of photon pairs using sfwm in optical fibers .",
    "these can be categorized by fiber structure and approach to phase matching : photonic - crystal fiber ( pcf ) @xcite , dispersion - shifted fiber ( dsf ) @xcite , and standard single - mode fiber ( smf ) @xcite .",
    "our approach uses birefringent single - mode fiber ( bsmf ) .",
    "the majority of the three previous methods all share a common aspect in that they utilize waveguide dispersion in a symmetric guide to achieve phase matching .",
    "the critical parameter for this is the fiber zero - dispersion wavelength ( zdw ) @xcite . in principle",
    ", the zdw can be controlled by manipulation of the fiber transverse - spatial structure in pcfs @xcite and addition of impurities in dsfs @xcite .",
    "the latter can only tune the fiber zdw to wavelengths longer than the innate fiber zdw .",
    "sfwm in smfs harnesses the natural zdw of silica fibers near 1310 nm using modulation instability ( mi ) to achieve phase matching . to date , the dsf and smf approaches have produced photons in the near - infrared spectral domain , where high - efficiency single - photon detectors are not readily available .",
    "furthermore , these techniques have been plagued by raman scattering that adds noise to the signal of interest .",
    "suppression of raman noise can be accomplished by cooling the optical fiber @xcite , although this adds a layer of experimental difficulty .",
    "thus , using the zdw to achieve phase matching restricts the ability to tune the pump laser and wavelengths at which photons can be produced .",
    "in contrast , the scheme presented here is flexible in the pump wavelength allowing photon pairs to be generated at arbitrary wavelengths . instead of waveguide dispersion",
    ", it makes use of birefringence in an asymmetric guide to achieve phase matching , as previously demonstrated in the large gain regime @xcite .    besides the potential to tune fiber dispersion , pcfs have high transverse spatial mode confinement ( @xmath0 mode diameter ) compared to standard optical fibers designed for visible light ( @xmath1 mode diameter ) , making the effective interaction stronger by roughly a factor of four .",
    "however , the exotic fiber structure that gives rise to the controlled dispersion in pcf leads to transverse spatial modes that are not well matched with integrated photonic circuits @xcite in which the produced photons are to be used .",
    "this limits the coupling efficiency between pcf and smf , currently 65% , that can be achieved @xcite .",
    "transverse - spatial mode mismatch does not significantly affect dsf , smf , and bsmf techniques .",
    "furthermore , unavoidable fluctuations in pcf manufacturing process may have a large effect on their dispersion due to the small core size and strong dispersion dependence on the spatial structure of the fiber , leading to a random distribution of two - photon spectral states from the same fiber draw @xcite .",
    "indeed , the ability to create pcf with desired dispersion is still not a well - developed technology , and thus experimentalists must search the catalog of currently available fibers to find the fiber with dispersion that comes closest to their needs .",
    "then the pump central wavelength and bandwidth must be carefully tuned to achieve the joint spectral state desired @xcite .",
    "dispersion of standard fibers is approximately equal to that of their constituent material in bulk when the wavelengths involved are smaller than the core diameter , and thus do not suffer as much from small fluctuations .",
    "nonclassical light sources based on fwm in standard birefringent fiber represents a useful alternative to pcf , dsf , smf and bulk pdc sources .",
    "photon pairs generated in this way are better mode matched to integrated optical networks compared to both bulk and pcf sources .",
    "birefringent fiber has nearly 30 years more development than pcf , which makes them significantly more cost effective , and more likely to be uniform from draw to draw . by utilizing fiber birefringence for phase matching",
    ", photons can be created far from the raman scatter , but still in the visible and near infrared where currently available single - photon - counting detectors can be used .",
    "the added control over the sfwm spectral state allowed by fiber birefringence can be tuned through stress induced birefringence , e.g. by transverse compression . in this",
    "paper theoretical and experimental results showing how sfwm in standard birefringent fibers can be used to produce a range of two - photon spectral states are presented . the high heralding efficiency , low raman background , high brightness , ability to tune the joint spectral state , and readily available components make this source useful in current applications .",
    "we begin by laying out the theoretical description of sfwm in birefringent fibers .",

    "finally , the results of experiments to characterize sfwm in off - the - shelf birefringent fibers are presented .",

    "the production rate is reduced by 18% and heralding efficiencies are reduced by about 10% in each beam .    in addition to the complication arising from the wings in the phase - matching function , there is a another subtlety that arises in realistic experiments  the pump spectral shape may not necessarily be well approximated by a gaussian in a given experiment .",

    "@xcite , the pump spectrum took on a nearly rect - function profile due to the nature of the spectral filtering used to prepare the pump . such a spectral amplitude ( with constant phase )",

    "it is therefore crucial to take care when modeling and performing actual experiments to create the desired two - photon state .",
    "another nonlinear process , raman scattering , can occur simultaneously with sfwm and produce photons at the signal and idler wavelengths .",
    "the process of raman scattering can be viewed as a pseudo - three - wave mixing process , in which one of the waves is a vibrational excitation of the material , an optical phonon .",
    "there are two ways in which this can occur ( up or down conversion ) . in the quantum picture",
    "the two raman scattering processes can be described as the splitting of a pump photon with frequency @xmath61 , into a stokes photon of frequency @xmath62 , and a phonon of frequency @xmath63 , or the annihilation of a pump photon and a phonon of frequency @xmath63 , creating an anti - stokes photon with frequency @xmath64 . at room temperature and with small detuning ( @xmath65 )",

    "allows significant stimulated stokes photon production approximately 100 nm detuned from the pump wavelength when pumping in the visible to near infrared @xcite .",
    "one approach to eliminate stimulated raman contamination from the idler wavelengths is to cool the fiber @xcite .",
    "however , this is difficult in practice and adds significant experimental complications .",
    "utilizing birefringent phase matching enables production of the idler sufficiently far from the pump to avoid contamination by raman scatter .",
    "the number of raman photons produced in the spontaneous regime scales linearly with the pump power @xmath67 , and fiber length @xmath38 , i.e. @xmath68 . the number of idler photons scales quadratically as a function of the pump power and linearly with fiber length , i.e. @xmath69 @xcite .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : ramanscatter ] , where the experimentally obtained signal , idler , and raman powers as a function of the pump power are shown for a 1 m fiber length .",
    "the signal - to - noise ratio , defined by the ratio of the number of idler photons and raman scattered photons , is proportional to the pump power , @xmath70 . for higher pump powers",
    "the probability that detection of an idler photon originates from sfwm over raman scattering is increased . however , for the purpose of heralding a single photon , coincidence detection events that do not originate from sfwm are the most detrimental .",
    "the most significant contribution to such coincidences arises from the detection of a signal photon and stokes photon simultaneously .",
    "the rate of these unwanted coincidences depends solely on the probability to detect a stokes photon per sfwm event , which scales linearly with pump power .",
    "therefore , the raman contamination of coincidence events actually increases with increased power .",
    "thus , a compromise must be struck between source brightness and background noise suppression .",
