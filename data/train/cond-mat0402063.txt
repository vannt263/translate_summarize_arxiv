    "it has been discovered in recent years that many real network systems , while showing different levels of complexity of their own , possess novel common structural or topological properties .",
    "these networks include , for example , the internet @xcite , world - wide - web @xcite , scientific citations @xcite , cells @xcite , the web of collaborations among actors and actresses @xcite , and the web of human sexual contacts @xcite .",
    "typically , networks are characterized by nodes and links .",
    "the nodes may represent websites on the world - wide - web , a paper in scientific journal , or an actor , etc .",
    ", depending on the network concerned .",
    "the links represent the interaction between the nodes .",
    "the interaction may represent the links from a webpage to another , references cited in a journal to papers in the literature , collaboration among actors and actresses , etc .",
    ", again depending on the system concerned . these structures are found to show the small - world effect , i.e. , a node can reach any randomly chosen node through only a few links ; the high - clustering effect , i.e. , nodes connected to a chosen node have high probability of having links among themselves ; and a well - defined degree distribution @xcite .",
    "these universal features observed in real systems have led to the intensive studies of complex networks in recent years .",
    "physicists have made major contributions to the understanding of the physics of networks .",
    "on the structural properties , physicists have proposed a number of models in which the observed statistical features in real networks are reproduced .",
    "the most representative of these models are the small - world model proposed by watts and strogatz @xcite ; and the scale - free growing network proposed by barabsi and albert ( ba ) @xcite . the latter model gives a better description of the scale - free or broad - scale distributions of degrees found in many real - life networks and hence has been extensively studied recently . while structural properties are important in the geometrical description of networks , many applications of the physics of networks rely on our understanding of dynamical processes on networks .",
    "dynamical processes , such as percolation , searchability problems , and especially the spread of diseases on complex networks have been investigated only recently .",
    "it has been found that the ba networks are highly susceptible to large scale epidemics @xcite .    in the present work ,",
    "we study how aging phenomena @xcite and links removal combined may affect the spreading of a disease or rumor in ba growing networks .",
    "aging refers to situations in which the older nodes in a network become increasingly unattractive to the newly added nodes .",
    "we use a susceptible - infected - refractory ( sir ) model for the dynamics of epidemics . using extensive numerical simulations",
    ", we study the sir dynamics on ba networks with a fraction of @xmath2 of the links removed or turned ineffective .",
    "it is found that a threshold @xmath7 exists , where @xmath6 is an aging parameter . for @xmath9 , a global spread results ; while for @xmath5 , only a local spread results .",
    "for the full ba network , i.e. , @xmath10 , global outbreak can take place only if the value of @xmath6 is smaller than a critical value .",
    "the underlying network can be set up as follows . initially there are @xmath11 fully connected nodes .",
    "we take @xmath12 in the present work . at each time step , a new node is introduced .",
    "each newly added node establishes @xmath13 ( @xmath14 ) outgoing links to existing nodes .",
    "each new link introduced at time step @xmath15 has a probability @xmath16 to be connected to an existing node @xmath17 with degree @xmath18 , i.e. , having @xmath18 links . here",
    "@xmath0 is the time at which node @xmath17 was added to the network and @xmath6 is an aging parameter characterizing how rapidly an existing node becomes unattractive to a newly added node .",
    "eq.([probkt ] ) states that newly established links are preferentially attached to the younger and highly connected existing nodes in the system . for @xmath19",
    ", there is no aging effect and the model reduces to the ba model @xcite .",
    "the aging factor thus models the situation where older persons in a society tend to isolate themselves or being isolated by the younger ones and lose their influence in the younger persons .    as an undiluted ba network is highly susceptible to large scale global spread of diseases , it is interesting to study the effects of removing a fraction of links in a fully grown ba network .",
    "these diluted networks can be constructed as follows .",
    "having set up an aging network of @xmath20 nodes , each link has a probability @xmath2 of being removed .",
    "hence , on the average , a fraction @xmath8 of the links in a fully grown aging network consisting of @xmath20 nodes are kept .",
    "the removed links in a diluted network can be regarded as ineffective links through which a disease or a rumor can not spread . in the present work , we study aging networks of size up to @xmath21 nodes .",
    "to study epidemiological processes on aging and diluted networks , we use the three - state susceptible - infected - refractory ( sir ) model @xcite .",
    "the model is a standard model for studying epidemics and the spread of a rumor in a connected population .",
    "initially , all nodes are in the s(susceptible)-state , and one node is randomly chosen to be infected , i.e. , in the i - state .",
    "the sir dynamics proceeds as follows . at a time step @xmath15 ,",
    "a node , say @xmath17 , is randomly chosen among all the infected ( i ) nodes .",
    "a neighbor or friend @xmath22 is then selected randomly among all the neighbors of node @xmath17 , i.e. , those with a link connected to @xmath17 .",
    "if node @xmath22 is susceptible , it becomes infected and the chosen node @xmath17 remains in the i - state ; otherwise ( i.e. , node @xmath22 is either i or r ) the state of node @xmath22 remains unchanged and the chosen node @xmath17 becomes refractory ( r ) at the end of the time step . within the context of a spread of a rumor , the i - state nodes refer to persons who want to spread the rumor , the s - state nodes are persons who have not heard the rumor , and the r - state nodes refer to persons who lost interest in spreading the rumor after knowing it .",
    "as time evolves , the number of r - nodes ( s - nodes ) increases ( decreases ) ; while the number of i - nodes increases initially and then eventually drops to zero .",
    "the number of r - nodes at the end of the dynamical evolution is denoted by @xmath23 .",
    "we are interested in how @xmath24 varies as the fraction of effective links @xmath8 and the aging parameter @xmath6 .",
    "we performed extensive numerical simulations to explore the combined effects of aging and links removal on the sir dynamics . in all the simulations , each data point is obtained by averaging over 100 realizations of the network structure and 100 different initially infected nodes for each realization . in fig.1",
    "we show the mean fraction of r - nodes , @xmath25 , on networks of different sizes up to @xmath21 on a log - log plot for different values of the aging parameter ( a ) @xmath26 , ( b ) @xmath27 , ( c ) @xmath28 , and ( d ) @xmath29 . for each value of @xmath6",
    ", we carried out simulations for different levels of dilution @xmath8 .",
    "for global spread , we expect that the number of refractory sites @xmath23 to be directly proportional to the network size @xmath20 and hence the fraction of refractory nodes @xmath30 becomes independent of @xmath20 . for local spreads , @xmath23 is finite for a sufficiently large network and hence @xmath30 decreases as @xmath31 .",
    "we thus search for a threshold @xmath3 that separate these two behavior of @xmath30 for a given value of @xmath6 .",
    "the results in fig . 1 show that @xmath32 does exhibit different behavior as @xmath8 decreases .",
    "precise determination of @xmath3 is quite difficult , due to finite size effect and the inhomogeneous nature of the problem resulting from the random removal of links from a originally randomly established ba network . to proceed",
    ", we study the slope of the lines in fig.1 as @xmath8 decreases .",
    "typical results for @xmath19 , @xmath33 , and @xmath34 are shown in fig.2 .",
    "notice that , for given value of @xmath6 , the slope starts to drop from zero , i.e. , @xmath35 for global spread , for some value of @xmath8 .",
    "notice that there is a transitional range of @xmath8 for which @xmath23 neither scales linearly with @xmath20 nor independent of @xmath20 .",
    "we adopt the value of @xmath8 at which the slope drops to the value of @xmath36 as @xmath7 . according to this criteria , we found @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 , and @xmath40 for the values of @xmath6 in fig.1 and fig.2 .    carrying out the calculations for different values of the aging parameter @xmath6 , we obtained the dependence of the threshold @xmath7 on the aging parameter @xmath6",
    "the results of @xmath7 are shown in fig.3 as the phase boundary in a phase space formed by the aging parameter @xmath6 and fraction of effective links @xmath8 . for small @xmath6 ( @xmath41 ) ,",
    "@xmath3 increases gradually as @xmath6 increases . for @xmath42 ,",
    "@xmath3 increases more sensitively with @xmath6 .",
    "as @xmath6 approaches @xmath43 , @xmath3 rapidly increases and takes on a value close to 1 , indicating that a rapidly aging network has the slightly older nodes effectively isolated and hence only local spread of a disease or rumor is possible , regardless of whether links are further removed .",
    "the phase boundary @xmath7 separate the phase space into two regions , one corresponds to local spread of a disease and another corresponds to a global spread of a disease .",
    "note that for @xmath44 , where @xmath45 , @xmath46 implying that aging effect _ alone _ is sufficient to keep a disease or rumor from spreading globally .",
    "the effect of aging can be understood qualitatively as follows . a ba network without aging , i.e. @xmath26",
    ", is highly resilient to random damages in the form of link removal @xcite .",
    "the results in fig.1(a ) show that one needs to remove more than @xmath47 of the links to prevent global spread of an epidemic .",
    "this feature is similar to previous studies of site percolation @xcite , where it was shown that for networks with a broad - scale degree distribution , one needs to remove a large fraction of nodes ( about @xmath48 ) before the network falls apart .",
    "the sensitivity of @xmath3 to the aging parameter @xmath6 is related to the form of the degree distribution as @xmath6 increases . for small values of @xmath6 ( @xmath49 ) ,",
    "the degree distribution still carries scale - free features that lead to a small @xmath3 and the weak dependence of @xmath3 on @xmath6 . for larger values of @xmath6 ,",
    "the older nodes lose their attractiveness rapidly giving rise to a narrow degree distribution .",
    "the scale - free nature of the network is lost and the degree distribution becomes increasingly dominated by an exponential form rather than a power law . in this case ,",
    "local spread is more probable unless the network carries a larger fraction of effective links , giving rise to the sensitive dependence of @xmath3 on @xmath6 @xcite . for rapidly aging networks",
    ", the small world effect vanishes and the  regular lattice \" behavior dominates .",
    "the high clustering feature of a rapidly aging network results in only local spread of a diseases @xcite .    in summary",
    ", we have studied the combined effects of aging and links removal on sir dynamics in the barabsi - albert scale - free networks .",
    "a threshold @xmath3 exists for the fraction of effective links in a network below which only local spreads of disease or rumor take place . for small aging effect , @xmath3 is low . as aging effect increases , @xmath3 increases . for rapidly aging network , @xmath50 implying that only local spread results , regardless of the number of effective links in the network .",
