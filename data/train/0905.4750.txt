    "the rapid progress in the experimental techniques for trapping and manipulating ultracold bose gases on microscopic scales has opened the possibility for investigating mesoscopic transport properties with interacting bosonic matter waves .",
    "a key achievement in this context is the development of simple or more complex waveguide geometries for cold atoms with optical techniques ( as , e.g. , in ref .",
    "@xcite ) or with atom chips @xcite , which also allow one to impose scattering and disorder potentials on microscopic scales ( e.g.  @xcite ) and which also permit to detect individual atoms with rather good accuracy @xcite . coherent transport processes in such waveguides , where the atoms of the bose gas are freely propagating along the guide with some finite momentum , can be studied , on the one hand , through bosonic wave packets that are created upon sudden release of a bose - einstein condensate from a trap , which is then accelerated in the presence of a finite potential gradient along the guide @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", the principle of an atom laser @xcite can be used for this purpose , as was recently demonstrated in refs .",
    "@xcite . in these experiments ,",
    "a coherent matter - wave beam was injected from a bose - einstein condensate in a trap into an optical waveguide .",
    "this was achieved by means of an radio - frequency ( rf ) induced transition from a magnetically trapped ( @xmath0 ) to an untrapped ( @xmath1 ) hyperfine state of @xmath2rb in ref .",
    "@xcite , and by means of a careful ramping of a magnetic - field gradient in an optical trap in ref .  @xcite . in this way it becomes possible to study bosonic scattering processes with cold atoms at well - defined incident energy , in close analogy to scattering of laser beams and to electronic transport in mesoscopic solid - state systems",
    "@xcite .    from the theoretical side ,",
    "a number of investigations on the quasicontinuous transport of ultracold bose gases and bose - einstein condensates have been undertaken during the past decade .",
    "this started with the attempt to define an atomic analog of landauer s quantization of conductance @xcite and was continued by first investigations of nonlinear resonant transport and interaction blockade in quantum - dot - like scattering potentials @xcite .",
    "propagation and transmission studies were then undertaken on the basis of the stationary gross - pitaevskii equation @xcite as well as through a time - dependent integration approach in which the injection of bosonic matter waves was accounted for by means of a coherent source term @xcite .    with few exceptions ( e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) , the above studies were mainly based on an effective one - dimensional gross - pitaevskii equation .",
    "this implicitly assumes the realization of a one - dimensional mean - field regime @xcite where the transverse confinement of the waveguide is strong enough to inhibit the population of transversally excited modes , but not so strong as to come close to the tonk - girardeau regime of impenetrable atoms @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the phase coherence length for a freely propagating atomic beam , which is generally finite for one - dimensional quasi - condensates @xcite , is assumed to be considerably larger than the effective longitudinal extent of the waveguide ( which may be limited due to a finite focal region in the case of an elongated dipole guide @xcite , or due to atom detection @xcite ) . using the one - dimensional gross - pitaevskii equation under these conditions ,",
    "the presence of atom - atom interaction in the bosonic beam mainly manifests , as in nonlinear optics @xcite , in form finite nonlinearity effects in the wave scattering process , such as nonlinearity - induced shifts of resonant transmission peaks @xcite .",
    "the main focus of this work is to determine the quantitative amount of _ depletion _ that is generated during the transport process of the condensate , which is a rather relevant information from the experimental point of view .",
    "indeed , too much depletion would eventually lead to a complete destruction of the phase coherence of the beam , which means that wave interference phenomena in the transport process , which would result from the coherent gross - pitaevskii equation , may , in this case , not be observable in practice .",
    "inspired by previous studies @xcite , we use a quantum kinetic approach for this purpose , which is equivalent to the hartree - fock - bogoliubov approximation @xcite . in practice ,",
    "the condensate wavefunction is , in this approach , propagated together with two - component functions that describe the coherence as well as the one - body density matrix associated with non - condensed atoms .",
    "this ansatz generally involves a renormalization of the microscopic interaction strength , which , however , does not represent a conceptual problem in the quasi - one - dimensional confinement geometries that we are considering here .",
    "moreover , it explicitly breaks the gauge symmetry of the bose gas and introduces a gap in the excitation spectrum @xcite .",
    "we justify this due to the fact that the matter - wave beam is , in the guided atom - laser scenario , connected to an idealized reservoir that contains a macroscopically large bose - einstein condensate , for which spontaneous breaking of gauge symmetry can be well assumed @xcite .    in order to provide a solid theoretical foundation of our approach ,",
    "we begin , in section [ sec : eq ] , with a step - by - step derivation of the quantum kinetic equations that are used to model the propagation process of the condensate in the presence of depletion . for the sake of definiteness",
    ", we focus here on an atom laser process that is based on the rf - induced outcoupling of atoms from a bose - einstein condensate in a magnetic trap @xcite .",
    "our starting point is the microscopic many - body description of the two - component system that defines this atom laser , from which we derive , under the assumption of a weak effective atom - atom interaction in the waveguide , nonlinear kinetic equations for the condensate wavefunction and for two - component functions that account , in lowest order , for quantum depletion . in sections [ sec : db ] and [ sec :",
    "dis ] , respectively , we apply this approach to transport processes of bose - einstein condensates through double barrier potentials and disorder potentials that were also studied in refs .",
    "@xcite on the basis of the gross - pitaevskii equation .",
    "our main finding , which is summarized in the conclusion in section [ sec : concl ] , is that the overall coherence of the atomic beam remains fairly well preserved over reasonably long time scales in the case of a quasi - stationary flow of the condensate , while strong depletion arises in the case of permanently time - dependent scattering in the waveguide .",
    "we consider a gas of ultracold bosonic atoms that are confined in a large trap and injected from there into a mesoscopic waveguide structure . in practice",
    ", such a `` guided atom laser '' can be realized by combining a magnetic trapping potential with an optical waveguide which is , e.g. , created by an elongated dipole trap . a radio - frequency ( rf ) field",
    "is then used to flip the spins of the atoms and induce coherent transitions from a low - field seeker state @xmath3 ( such as the @xmath4 state of @xmath2rb ) to a hyperfine state @xmath5 that is , in lowest order , insensitive to the magnetic field ( the @xmath6 state of @xmath2rb ) but still experiences the optical potential . as demonstrated in refs .",
    "@xcite where this setup was experimentally realized , the quadratic zeeman effect can be exploited to compensate the quadratic variation of the laser intensity along the dipole trap and to thereby create a rather homogeneous waveguide potential .    in the formalism of second quantization",
    ", the quantum dynamics of this two - component system is described by the coupled equations @xmath7 for the bosonic field operators @xmath8 and @xmath9 that annihilate atoms in the `` waveguide state '' @xmath5 and the `` reservoir state '' @xmath3 , respectively .",
    "@xmath10 denotes the waveguide potential while @xmath11 corresponds to the magnetic trap ( perturbed by the presence of the optical guide ) that confines the reservoir atoms in the state @xmath3 .",
    "the short - range interaction between the atoms in the involed hyperfine states is represented by contact potentials of the form @xmath12 with the prefactors @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 for @xmath5-@xmath5 , @xmath3-@xmath3 , and @xmath5-@xmath3 interaction processes , respectively .",
    "transitions between waveguide and reservoir states are induced by the coupling amplitude @xmath16 , which is adiabatically raised from zero to a finite value and which would correspond to the field strength of the rf radiation .",
    "it is reasonable from the experimental point of view to consider an initial many - body state in the trap that consists of a nearly perfect bose - einstein condensate containing a rather large number of atoms .",
    "provided the coupling amplitude @xmath16 is not too strong , we can safely assume that the condensate is not appreciably affected by the outcoupling process on finite time scales .",
    "we therefore make the ansatz @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the macroscopically populated condensate wavefunction that satisfies the gross - pitaevskii equation @xmath19 with the normalization @xmath20 and @xmath21 denotes the chemical potential of the condensate .",
    "this ansatz explicitly involves a spontaneous breaking of the condensate s gauge symmetry , which should be valid in the thermodynamic limit of a very large number @xmath22 of atoms in the trap @xcite . inserting this expression for @xmath9 into eq .",

    "in addition to the waveguide , we consider the presence of a longitudinal scattering potential @xmath29 of finite spatial range , which could , e.g. , be a sequence of barriers or speckle disorder induced by other laser fields . denoting the transverse eigenstates within the waveguide by @xmath30 , we can make the decomposition @xmath31 for the field operator of the @xmath5-atoms , where @xmath32 annihilates a particle at position @xmath26 in the @xmath33th transverse eigenmode .",

    "we clearly see a finite cloud of noncondensed atoms within the resonator , which is obviously induced by the large local density fluctuations of the condensate . the noncondensed denisty is found to slowly increase with time during the sweep of the chemical potential , but remains rather low compared to the condensate density on the time scales that are considered here .",

    "@xcite is working not only within the gross - pitaevskii description of the transport process , but remains feasible also from a more microscopic point of view taking into account the noncondensed cloud that is generated within the scattering region .",
    "we remark , however , that this conclusion strongly depends on the specific parameters at hand . indeed , if we increase the microscopic interaction strength of the atoms by a factor two ( which could possibly be achieved through a feshbach resonance ) while keeping the other parameters of the system fixed , we find rather strong depletion of the condensate within the resonator during the time - dependent sweep of the chemical potential across the resonance .",
    "in this situation , the truncation scheme leading to the equations ( [ eq : psi][eq : gamma ] ) would not be justified any longer , and we expect that at that particular high value of the interaction strength the overall coherence of the atomic cloud can not be maintained and the condensate would become destroyed during the transport process .",
    "let us now consider the transport of bose - einstein condensates through disorder potentials of finite range , consisting of a more or less random sequence of several barriers and wells with different heights and depths .",
    "such disorder potentials received special attention in the past years due to the possibility of realizing anderson localization with ultracold atoms @xcite .",
    "this task was ultimately achieved in two independent experiments @xcite studying the expansion of condensates within optical speckle fields @xcite as well as within bichromatic optical lattices @xcite , in a parameter regime where effects of the atom - atom interaction on the expansion process could be neglected .",
    "indeed , various theoretical studies revealed that the presence of a finite nonlinearity in the wave equation that describes the expansion process , which would correspond to a finite interaction strength within the mean - field description of the condensate , would lead to a significant deviation from the scenario of anderson localization , involving indefinite spreading of the tails of the condensate wavefunction instead of exponential localization @xcite .",
    "the effect of a finite interaction is predicted to be even more dramatic in _ scattering _ processes through disorder potentials . here , anderson localization would manifest in an exponential descrease of the average transmission @xmath151 with the spatial length @xmath125 of the disorder region ( or , more precisely , in a linear increase of the average @xmath152 with @xmath125 ) , which is induced by the destructive interference between multiply reflected components of the scattering wavefunction @xcite . in the presence of a finite nonlinearity , however , a crossover to an _ algebraic _ decrease of the average transmission according to @xmath153 is encountered @xcite , which would essentially correspond to ohm s law for incoherent transport .",
    "we find that this crossover is directly connected with the appearance of _ permanently time - dependent scattering _ of the condensate @xcite .",
    "that is , the injection process of the condensate according to the working principle of the guided atom laser does not lead to the population of a quasi - stationary scattering state , but induces time - dependent fluctuations of the condensate density beyond a certain critical value of the source amplitude .",
    "the main finding of our investigation of this problem with the kinetic hartree - fock - bogoliubov equations ( [ eq : psi][eq : gamma ] ) is that the appearance of permanently time - dependent scattering within the gross - pitaevskii description of the transport process involves strong depletion and the production of a comparatively large cloud of noncondensed atoms .",

    "in this work , we investigated the transport of guided bosonic matter waves through one - dimensional scattering potentials by means of the inhomogeneous hartree - fock - bogoliubov equations , which simulate the coherent injection of those matter waves from a trapped bose - einstein condensate @xcite .",
    "a straightforward numerical integration of these hartree - fock - bogoliubov equations yields nearly stationary , mean - field - like scattering dynamics of the bosonic flow on reasonably long time scales , provided the effective one - dimensional interaction strength is not too large and the integration of the corresponding gross - pitaevskii equation leads to quasistationary scattering . in that case ,",
    "a comparatively low amount of depletion is obtained , with noncondensed atoms preferrably accumulating around the local minima of the scattering potential .",
    "if , on the other hand , the nonlinear scattering dynamics of the condensate is explicitly time - dependent on the level of the gross - pitaevskii equation , we encounter strong depletion and a rather large density of noncondensed atoms within the hartree - fock - bogoliubov description .",
    "this indicates that the condensate becomes destroyed on a microscopic many - body description of the transport process , and that the atoms are individually propagating across the scattering potential .",
    "it would be interesting , though beyond the scope of this work , to compare our findings with the truncated wigner approach @xcite , which represents an alternative method to describe dynamical transport processes of bose - einstein condensates beyond the gross - pitaevskii description . in this approach",
    ", the microscopic quantum dynamics of the atomic cloud is described by a set of classical fields which sample the distribution of the initial many - body state describing the bose gas under consideration , and which evolve according to the time - dependent gross - pitaevskii equation . in our situation",
    ", this initial state would correspond to an almost perfect bose - einstein condensate of the `` reservoir '' atoms that are confined in the three - dimensional magnetic trap .",
    "the classical fields that would have to be used for the truncated wigner approach would therefore be rather similar at the initial stage of the matter - wave injection process , and deviations between them , which ultimately give rise to a loss of coherence , should mainly arise in the presence of strongly time - dependent scattering where the occurrence of classical chaos in the gross - pitaevskii equation might induce an exponential sensitivity of the time evolution with respect to initial conditions",
    ". this would be consistent with our observation that depletion is particularly strong in the regime of permamently time - dependent scattering .    an interesting study in this context",
    "was recently reported in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the quantitative amount of depletion was computed for a homogeneously moving three - dimensional condensate ( initially defined as a plane wave in a box with periodic boundaries ) in the presence of an obstacle or a disorder potential . using the truncated wigner method , the authors showed that nonstationary , turbulent flow of the condensate leads to rather rapid depletion , on time scales that seem to be roughly comparable with our investigations @xcite .",
    "good agreement between the time - dependent hartree - fock - bogoliubov approach and the truncated wigner approach was , moreover , reported in other studies @xcite that were focusing on collapsing bose - einstein condensates .",
    "we finally point out again that several idealizations and approximations were employed for the desciption of the bosonic transport process .",
    "specifically , we assumed a perfect condensate in the reservoir , which is not significantly depopulated during the outcoupling process , we neglected the ( virtual ) population of transversally excited modes in the waveguide , and we excluded nonlinear back - action with the source assuming that the interaction strength of the waveguide atoms is negligible in the vicinity of the magnetic trap .",
    "these simplifications would have to be reconsidered for the simulation of a realistic matter - wave propagation experiment based on an atom laser .",
