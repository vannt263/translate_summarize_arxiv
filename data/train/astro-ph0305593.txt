    "the 1998 flight of boomerang ( b98 ) provided a measurement of the angular power spectrum of cmb temperature anisotropies from @xmath0 to @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "boomerang made its second long duration balloon ( ldb ) flight ( boom03 ) in january 2003 with a receiver configured to simultaneously measure cmb temperature and polarization anisotropies .",
    "the new receiver used pairs of polarization sensitive bolometers ( psb s ) at 145 ghz . at 245 ghz and 345 ghz ,",
    "spider web bolometers are used with polarization sensitivity provided by polarizing grids mounted at the front of the cryogenic feed horns .",
    "the b98 results were partially limited by pointing reconstruction error ( @xmath2 rms ) . for the boom03 flight , we added a pointed sun sensor and a tracking star camera which should reduce our pointing reconstruction error to less than @xmath3 rms . from the boom03 flight , we have 11.7 days of data .",
    "an analysis effort is underway , with the goal of producing measurements of @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "the boomerang telescope ( figure [ fig : tele ] ) was designed specifically for the harsh conditions of antarctic ballooning @xcite .",
    "the extensive shielding prevents the contamination by stray - light , and protects other sensitive components from the sun .",
    "this is especially important for daytime ballooning over antarctica , where thermal management is vital .",
    "the back of the telescope is constantly illuminated by the sun , reaching temperatures of @xmath7 c , while the front is shaded and can cool to less than @xmath8 c.    boomerang scans in azimuth , with the elevation kept constant for at least one hour .",
    "sky rotation turns this one - dimensional azimuthal scan strategy into a cross - linked pattern on the celestial sphere .",
    "b98 and boom03 both used a differential gps array , a fixed sun sensor and rate gyros for pointing reconstruction .",
    "for boom03 , the pointed sun sensor and tracking star camera should improve the pointing reconstruction error .",
    "the boomerang primary mirror is an off - axis parabola with a diameter of 1.3  m. it is 45@xmath9 degrees off axis and has a focal length of 1280  mm .",
    "the primary feeds a pair of cold re - imaging mirrors which are kept at 1.65  k inside the cryostat ( figure [ fig : optics ] ) .",
    "the tertiary forms an image of the primary and acts as the lyot stop for our system .",
    "it controls the illumination on the primary , limiting the effective diameter to about 80 cm .",
    "there is a 1 cm hole in the tertiary behind which sits a calibration lamp .",
    "it fires once every 15 minutes allowing us to monitor any calibration drift .",
    "the boomerang cryostat can keep the detectors at 0.275 k for 15 days @xcite .",
    "toroidal nitrogen and helium tanks ( with the helium tank inside the nitrogen tank ) are suspended via 1.6 mm kevlar ropes .",
    "the insert , which contains the cold mirrors and the focal plane , is bolted to the helium tank .",
    "the insert also contains a single stage @xmath10he refrigerator which can keep the focal plane at 0.275 k for 12 - 13 days @xcite .",
    "since the @xmath11he and ln@xmath12 stages have a longer hold time ( 18 and 16 days respectively ) than the @xmath10he stage , we added capability for an in - flight cycle of the @xmath10he refrigerator .",
    "the boom03 receiver was designed for measurement of cmb temperature and polarization anisotropies .",
    "there are 8 pixels , and each pixel contains two detectors .",
    "four of the pixels contain pairs of polarization sensitive bolometers ( psb s ) operating at 145 ghz .",
    "the other four pixels are 2-color photometers operating at 245 and 345 ghz .",
    "both the psb s and the photometers use corrugated feed horns .",
    "table [ tab : rec ] summarizes the properties of the boom03 receiver .",
    "figure [ fig : focalplane ] shows the layout of the focal plane projected onto the sky .",
    ".summary of the properties of the boom03 receiver .",
    "the fwhm is based on a pre - flight measurement using a tethered thermal source placed 1  km from the telescope .",
    "the @xmath13 is calculated using a model of our detectors based on pre - flight loadcurve data .",
    "preliminary analysis of flight data provides a similar answer at 145  ghz [ tab : rec ] [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "with our flight data in hand , we can project our sensitivity to @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and @xmath6 .",
    "figure [ fig : b2k2_forecast ] shows what we can expect statistically with eight detectors at 145 ghz .",
    "these error bars are estimated using the formulas presented in @xcite .",
    "the combined net assumes that all channels have an net@xmath14 .",
    "no allotment is made for calibration uncertainty , beam uncertainty , pointing error , systematics or the fact that long time constants at 145 ghz will decrease signal - to - noise at high-@xmath15 .",
