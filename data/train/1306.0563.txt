    "within the framework of the currently favoured @xmath1 cold dark matter cosmological model , only approximately 32% of the current energy density of the universe is due to matter , of which approximately 85% is of unknown nature , as particles belonging to the standard model ( sm ) of particle physics constitute only 5% of the total energy density of today s universe @xcite .",
    "several extensions of the sm exist that predict particles complying with the phenomenological requirements of a _ dark _ matter ( dm ) candidate , see @xcite for a ten - point test .",
    "many such candidates are majorana particles , bearing the remarkable property of being their own antiparticle and thus `` self - annihilating '' ; a popular and much - studied class of models is the weakly interacting massive particles ( wimps ) , where the natural size of the self - annihilation cross section gives rise to the observed dm density ( see @xcite and @xcite for reviews ) .",
    "a wide variety of present - day experimental searches seek to identify the nature of dm : collider searches and direct detection experiments are complemented by indirect detection experiments that attempt to detect the astrophysical signatures left by dm , which are expected to be particularly striking in the case of self - annihilating particles .",
    "clear positive indirect detections of dm annihilations taking place in the local universe  particularly in environments where dm over - densities are expected  still elude us .",
    "however , in their absence , strong constraints on the parameters that control the annihilation energy release can be derived .",
    "the most prominent approaches to indirect detection include searches for gamma - ray signals from the galactic center ( e.g. @xcite ) and dwarf galaxies @xcite , charged particles in the earth s neighbourhood @xcite , contributions to the diffuse galactic gamma - ray background @xcite and associated multi - wavelength searches @xcite .",
    "however , dm annihilation is not limited to the local universe , but  if occurring at all ",
    "should generically take place at all times ; dm annihilating during the recombination epoch and slightly after is expected to affect the free electron fraction , and consequently the anisotropy of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) @xcite .",
    "methods based on this effect can test the dm properties at a comparable sensitivity to techniques based on searching for signatures of dm annihilation in the present day @xcite .",
    "furthermore , they have the significant qualitative advantage of depending only on the ( well - measured ) average dm density of the universe  as favorable as the proximity of the targets is , all local universe methods are affected by the uncertainty in the dm distribution in the target , which controls the overall annihilation rate and therefore the expected observable flux .",
    "in contrast , the annihilation rate producing the modification in the cmb depends on the smooth , cosmological background of dm , before any significant structures form , and therefore cmb constraints on dm annihilation are unaffected by this type of uncertainty ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the dm - model dependence of such constraints  i.e. the dependence on the branching ratios for dm annihilation into different sm channels , the absorption of the annihilation products by the cosmological plasma , and the uncertainties on such estimates  have been discussed in @xcite .",
    "constraints on the dm self - annihilation cross section and mass obtained with the current cmb data are already competitive with other existing searches ; forecasts based on mock data show that a combination of _ planck _ temperature and polarization data could in principle allow the discovery of dm annihilation at the level required by a `` thermal relic '' annihilation cross section , for an interesting range of dm masses ( up to @xmath2 gev / c@xmath3 , depending on the branching ratio ) .",
    "given the forthcoming polarization data release by the _ planck _ collaboration , it is most timely to assess all uncertainties affecting cmb constraints .",
    "in this paper , we address some of the remaining uncertainties which can be considered of systematic type , and affect the constraints from the cmb at comparable levels .    after illustrating the basic theory and equations in section [ sec : theory ] , we study the impact of assumptions previously adopted in the literature to calculate the fraction of dark matter annihilation energy that is absorbed by the medium .",
    "the study of the propagation of the secondary shower is split into two phases : from the initial energy to the kev scale , and then from this scale to the final energy depositions into the igm as heating , ionization , and excitation .",
    "we first study the uncertainties related to this second part of the calculation , assuming as a benchmark that the fraction of the initial annihilation energy transferred into kev - scale electrons ( via decays and subsequent cooling of weak - scale annihilation products ) is constant with redshift .",
    "the particular value of this constant does not affect our tests .",
    "we describe the code to calculate the fractions of energy going into different absorption channels in section [ sec : fractions ] , and study the impact of systematic uncertainties on the calculation of these energy fractions in section [ sec : systematics ] .    in section [ sec : accuratevsssck ]",
    "we determine the degree to which adopting a simplified parametrization for the energy fractions , e.g. the one proposed by chen and kamionkowski @xcite and used afterward by a number of different authors @xcite , can bias the constraints on dark matter annihilation , relative to the more accurate treatment of the fractions presented in this paper . in section [ sec : lymanalpha ]",
    "we emphasize the point that our code permits us to compute the precise energy fraction that goes into lyman-@xmath0 radiation .",
    "this is relevant as lyman-@xmath0 photons contribute to the ionization of the medium through an intermediate excited state , so the precise calculation of this fraction is important in improving the accuracy of the calculations .",
    "we study the differences in the calculated effects of dark matter annihilation due to the use of different recombination codes , such as recfast @xcite ( v1.5 ) or the more recent and accurate cosmorec @xcite , in section [ sect : recfastvscosmorec ] , and verify that the choice of recombination code has negligible impact on the derived constraints .",
    "in section [ sec : higheng ] we study the _ first _ part of the cascade , from the initial energy at the gev - tev scale to the 3 kev threshold .",
    "we describe the improvements to the calculation relative to previous works in the literature , including e.g. a better understanding of the energy losses to sub-10.2 ev photons of inverse compton scattered ( ics ) secondary electrons .",
    "we then assess the impact of these improvements on the constraints .",
    "we find that for specific dark matter masses and annihilation channels , the improvements we introduce compared to previous calculations can significantly affect the recovered results , in some cases weakening the constraints by up to a factor of two .    finally , we present our conclusions in section [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "dark matter annihilating after the thermal decoupling  and before the formation of sizable gravitationally bound structures",

    "[ eq : dxe ] represents the contribution to the electron fraction evolution from a `` non - standard '' source ; in our case it takes into account that during recombination dm annihilations increase the ionization rate both by direct ionization from the ground state , and by contributing additional lyman-@xmath0 photons . the latter boosts the population at @xmath36 , increasing the rate of photoionization by the cmb from these excited states .",
    "therefore , the ionization rate due to particle annihilation is : @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the ionization rate due to ionizing photons , and @xmath39 the ionization rate due to additional lyman-@xmath0 photons .",

    "finally , a fraction of the energy released by annihilating particles goes into heating of the baryonic gas , adding an extra @xmath44 term in the standard evolution equation for the matter temperature @xmath25 :    @xmath45    where the non standard term is given by : @xmath46 and @xmath47 is the fraction of energy going into heat . in section [ sec : fractions ] we will describe how the @xmath48 fractions are calculated , and the uncertainties in their derivation that might impact the modeled effect of dark matter annihilation .",
    "the formalism presented here works under the assumption that it is possible to split the study of the cascade , from the dm mass scale down to the absorption channels , into two independent steps .",
    "in the first step , the propagation of the shower is followed from the injection at the dm mass scale ( gev / tev ) down to the @xmath49kev scale ( the exact energy threshold will be discussed in section [ sec : sourcekev ] and [ sec : higheng ] ) ; below this energy , all cooling processes are fast relative to a hubble time , so once a particle s energy is degraded below this threshold it can no longer free - stream to the present day , or lose a significant fraction of its energy to redshifting before being absorbed ( with the exception of photons below 10.2 ev ) .",
    "the fraction of the initial energy reprocessed into particles below this threshold is expressed through the @xmath12 function in eq .",
    "[ enrateselfdm ] . in the second step ,",
    "the copious particles degraded down to this atomic energy scale are followed , and the re - partition of their energy into heating , excitation and ionization channels ( expressed by the @xmath48 functions ) is studied in detail .",
    "we begin by examining the calculation of the @xmath48 functions in the following section , while we will study the uncertainties of the @xmath12 function in section [ sec : higheng ] .",
    "to assess how the `` deposited '' energy fraction @xmath12 is divided between the different channels of heating , ionization and excitation , most of the literature today  and for the past twenty years  has adopted the values for @xmath48 taken from @xcite .",
    "these results were obtained through monte carlo computations that followed in detail the secondary energy cascade generated by an electron of energy @xmath50  kev injected into a gas with @xmath51 .",
    "the code returned the fractions of the initial energy absorbed by the gas as heat , ionizations and excitations ( i.e. the fractional energy depositions @xmath47 , @xmath52 and @xmath53 respectively ) .    in recent years the problem of the energy depositions was tackled with considerable improvements over the seminal work by @xcite : @xcite used updated cross sections and implemented new physical processes ; @xcite extended the energy range of the primary electron up to @xmath50 1 mev @xmath54 1 tev ; @xcite computed the cascade from the distributions of lepton and photons produced by the annihilation of selected dm candidates .",
    "all the aforementioned works adopt a similar monte carlo scheme : for every particle , either primary or secondary , the code calculates the various interaction probabilities and samples among them via a random number generator .",
    "the considered physical processes when dealing with a primary electron of @xmath50  kev are the following : h , he , hei ionization ; h , he excitation ; collisions with thermal electrons ; free - free interactions with ionized atoms ; recombinations .",
    "the monte carlo code degrades the energy of the particles down to @xmath49  ev energies and then provides the fractional energy depositions .",
    "notice that in this energy range ( @xmath5510kev ) it is a good approximation to consider that the whole cascade happens  on the spot \" .",
    "the timescales of the two most relevant interactions , i.e. coulomb scattering and collisional ionization , are in fact much smaller than a hubble time for the considered values of @xmath13 , therefore the primary electron energy is deposited locally in a short timescale ( see @xcite ) .",
    "this approximation can not be considered valid either for higher primary energies of order @xmath49  mev or if the local value of the ionized fraction changes rapidly ( e.g. around sources of ionizing radiation ) .    after a collisional ionization event the code has one extra secondary electron to follow , while collisional excitations off h or he atoms give line photons .",
    "if a he line photon has an energy higher than 13.6 ev it photo - ionizes an h atom in a short timescale .",
    "h excitations to levels @xmath56 will generally cascade through @xmath57 and emit ly@xmath0 photons .",
    "electron - electron collisions on the other hand transfer heat to the gas . when the energy of an electron is degraded to less than 10.2 ev",
    "then both collisional excitations and ionizations become impossible and the electron deposits all of its remaining energy into the gas as heat . when a photon has energy below 10.2 ev it will not interact further with the gas .    to compute the interaction probabilities for a given electron it is necessary to compute first the cross sections for the possible interactions . then the mean free path",
    "is calculated by using the relative abundances of the target particles .",
    "the probability of interaction is then simply given by the inverse of the mean free path .",
    "the calculation is insensitive to h density , the important parameters are the relative abundance of he and the free electron fraction @xmath13 : intuitively , an electron injected in a gas with a higher @xmath13 will have a higher probability of coulomb interactions , and therefore the fractional energy depositions will present a higher @xmath47 .    while the works cited above share this common monte carlo numerical structure , they present some crucial differences of implementation . in this work in particular we use a modified version of the code",
    "described in @xcite with updated interaction cross sections ( see @xcite ) and a separate treatment for hydrogen and helium which allows us to use as input different values of their ionized fractions and compute the fractional energy depositions for the processes relative to the two species .",
    "another crucial improvement over @xcite is that we are able to classify photons produced by collisional excitations into two main categories , ly@xmath0 or `` continuum '' if their energy is below 10.2 ev , as is the case , e.g. of photons produced by the two - photon forbidden transition @xmath58 , previously neglected .",
    "we perform a number of runs using realistic fractions for ionized hydrogen and helium ( @xmath59 and @xmath60 ) rather than using the standard assumption that @xmath61 .",
    "in particular , we have calculated the fractions for different values of @xmath62 fixing the amount of ionized helium at different values , i.e. @xmath63 . the choice of these values is motivated by the fact that in the redshift range of interest for cmb studies , @xmath64 , the ionization of helium in a standard recombination history is below @xmath65 at redshift @xmath66 . however , in the presence of dark matter annihilation , ionization of helium might be higher even at lower redshifts .",
    "we have calculated that even for an unrealistic level of dark matter annihilation , corresponding to a constant annihilation parameter of @xmath67@xmath68/s / gev has often been expressed in units of m@xmath69/s / kg . in this work ,",
    "we convert to @xmath68/s / gev units for convenience ; @xmath67@xmath68/s / gev corresponds to @xmath70m@xmath69/s / kg . ]",
    "already strongly ruled out by current data ( see e.g. @xcite ) , the level of ionized helium does not exceed @xmath71 .",
    "this justifies the range of values for @xmath72 we choose to study ( see section [ sec : xhe ] ) .",
    "moreover , to study the possible deviations in the fractional energy depositions produced by a smaller / larger amount of helium in the igm , we perform three series of runs for different values of the helium fraction by mass , @xmath73 , where the median value is inferred from wmap data ( @xcite ) ( see section [ sec : helium ] ) . for details on the cross sections we refer the reader to @xcite and references therein .",
    "for each assumed cosmological evolution of @xmath74 and @xmath75 , and for each value of @xmath76 we performed 100 monte carlo realizations , a number sufficient to produce consistent results not biased by the random nature of the computation , as determined in the aforementioned studies .",
    "the numerical outputs for the fractional energy depositions can be found in tabulated form in appendix [ app : engfracs ] .",
    "in this section we study how the variation of _ i ) _ the level of helium ionization , and _",
    "ii ) _ the helium abundance , affects the calculated energy fractions , and thus how misestimation of these quantities could modify the computed effect of dm annihilation on the recombination history and cmb power spectra .",
    "we also study _ iii ) _ the impact of changing the energy of the original ( kev - scale ) electron , for the monte carlo code described in section [ sec : fractions ] . before showing these results however",
    ", we briefly describe the codes used to calculate the recombination histories , the cmb power spectra and the constraints we will present in the following sections .    the evolution of the free electron fraction will be calculated using a modified version of the recfast code ( v1.5 ) @xcite , while cmb spectra are calculated with camb.]@xcite ( high_accuracy_default option always switched on ) . as a benchmark , we will assume dark matter annihilation with a constant annihilation parameter @xmath77@xmath68/s / gev .",

    "it thus represents the strongest annihilation signal still allowed by current data that future cmb experiments might detect . as a fiducial model for the other @xmath1cdm parameters , we use the wmap7 marginalized values @xcite .",

    "as discussed in section [ sec : higheng ] , inverse compton scattering ( ics ) of mildly relativistic electrons leads to only slight boosts of the cmb photons , and consequently to a ( spectrally distorted ) population of photons below the 10.2 ev threshold for excitation .",
    "ics is not included in our low - energy code which treats the atomic processes in detail , due to the computational demands of accurately tracking a very large number of nearly elastic scatterings . consequently",
    ", this code can only be reliably used in the energy range where ics is not the dominant cooling process .",
    "previous works @xcite have stated that ics is subdominant and can be neglected for electron energies , @xmath155 however , this expression is not valid when the inferred cutoff energy is non - relativistic ( we have verified this conclusion with the authors of the articles in question ) : it was originally derived by @xcite , assuming _",
    "relativistic _ electrons . at the high redshifts in question here , a naive application of equation [ eq : hhcrit ] indicates a non - relativistic cutoff energy , e.g. @xmath156 kev for @xmath139 , where the effect of dm annihilation on the cmb is thought to peak @xcite .    in the non - relativistic regime , following the estimates from @xcite , the cooling times for inverse compton scattering , collisional heating and ionization",
    "are given respectively by , @xmath157    in the regime well after recombination where the ionization fraction @xmath13 is very small ( @xmath158 ) , ionization dominates over heating at all energies and redshifts , and the crossover between ics and ionization occurs at , @xmath159 i.e. ics dominates for energies , @xmath160 for the redshift range of greatest interest , therefore , ics always dominates above a few kev .",
    "in particular , at @xmath139 where the signal from dm annihilation is thought to be greatest , the crossover energy is @xmath161 kev .",
    "the main reason for the discrepancy with equation [ eq : hhcrit ] is that expression was derived assuming a relativistic limit for the energy loss rate due to inverse compton scattering , which can badly underestimate the loss rate when extrapolated naively to non - relativistic electrons .",
    "consequently , it is _ not _ valid to transition to a code that neglects inverse compton scattering at hundreds or thousands of kev .",
    "this is confirmed in figure [ fig : fractions ] , where we see that the energy losses into continuum photons ( which originate entirely from ics ) are converged to within a few percent for 1 - 3 kev thresholds , but can appear ( incorrectly ) much lower for higher thresholds .    in figure",
    "[ fig : varyingpartition ] we show the effect on the @xmath12 curves , _ after _ subtraction of continuum ( sub-10.2-ev ) photons , of taking different threshold energies , and of setting the ics losses to zero below the cutoff indicated by the hansen and haiman criterion ( equation [ eq : hhcrit ] ) , as was effectively done in previous work . in this last case",
    "we take the threshold ( for transition to the detailed low - energy code ) to be 1 kev .",
    "we have confirmed that lowering the threshold energy below 1 kev , to several hundred ev , has no effect on the deposition curves ( as expected from the discussion above ) .",
    "+            these results confirm our expectations from the analytic comparison of cooling times .",
    "the exact choice of threshold depends on the desired accuracy , and the tradeoff between the improved handling of atomic processes in the low - energy code and its lack of ics , but in any case it should clearly lie in the 1 - 10 kev range .",
    "we choose 3 kev as our threshold , accepting the percent - level uncertainty from neglect of ics below this threshold ( as estimated from figure [ fig : fractions ] ) .",
    "with decreasing redshift , there is a steep fall in the injected power per baryon from dm annihilation ( as @xmath162 ) . in general , assuming on - the - spot deposition will underestimate the deposited energy at any given redshift , as the reduced fraction of deposited energy from recent annihilations is more than compensated by the residual deposition from earlier annihilations , when the dm density was higher .",
    "there is a countervailing effect , in that in the on - the - spot approximation the relevant opacity of the universe is its opacity at the redshift of injection , and it can only grow more transparent at later times ; taking the delay in absorption into account might then be expected to reduce the overall energy deposition .",
    "however , the first effect generally dominates , giving rise to an @xmath12 curve that is both higher and flatter with decreasing redshift than would be the case if the on - the - spot approximation held true ( since at low redshifts the increasing transparency of the universe , which would naively lead to a steeply falling deposition - fraction curve , is partially compensated by the additional power injected at earlier redshifts ) .",
    "it is difficult to precisely reproduce the effect of assuming on - the - spot deposition ( with a prescription for estimating energy losses to redshifting , as in @xcite ) , within our formalism .",
    "however , as a proxy , we can look at the total fraction of energy _ ever _ deposited by a particle injected at a particular redshift ; if the on - the - spot approximation held true , this curve would be precisely the same as @xmath12 , and so the degree to which they differ serves as a measure of how badly the approximation is violated .",
    "an example is shown for 10 gev dm annihilating to muons ( @xmath163 ) in figure [ fig : onthespotcompare ] . here",
    "we show the original @xmath12 curve defined in equation [ eq : originalf ] , as the curves for total energy deposited by particles injected at a particular energy and redshift ( taken from @xcite ) are not yet available for the modified @xmath12 curves discussed in this work .",
    "we expect that the direction of the effect should be similar for the updated calculation .     for dm annihilating to 10 gev muons , the @xmath12 curve ( blue ) and a curve showing the total fraction of energy ever deposited ( purple ) .",
    "the latter curve has been multiplied by 1.18 to match the @xmath12 curve at @xmath164 , to make the difference in redshift dependence more clear . ]",
    "we see that the @xmath12 curve falls noticeably less steeply with decreasing redshift , for the example given , and hypothesize that the on - the - spot approximation  in particular , the failure to account for power deposited by particles injected at earlier redshifts  may in part be responsible for the discrepancy noted by @xcite between the original @xmath12 curves and the shape of the energy deposition curves in that work s monte - carlo - based method ( the latter fall much more steeply at redshifts @xmath165 ) . the discrepancy at redshifts close to recombination , on the other hand , is more likely due to the approximate form of the energy fractions used to multiply the original @xmath12 curve .",
    "the implementation of the ics cutoff in @xcite may also contribute to the discrepancy ( see appendix [ app : threshold ] ) .",
