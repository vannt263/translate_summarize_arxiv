    "the l dwarfs and the t dwarfs are the two lowest luminosity spectral classes of very low - mass stars and brown dwarfs known today , encompassing effective temperatures ( t@xmath2 ) from @xmath32200  k down to @xmath3600  k ( @xcite ; see also and references therein ) .",
    "spectroscopic studies of these sources reveal atmospheres that are remarkably diverse .",
    "l dwarfs having abundant molecular gas species and clouds of condensates in their photospheres , while t dwarfs have relatively cloud - free photospheres and more complex molecular gas species including ch@xmath4 , nh@xmath5 and co@xmath6 @xcite .",
    "condensate cloud properties are believed responsible for near - infrared spectral and color variations among equivalently - classified l dwarfs @xcite , temporal variability in late - type dwarfs and dramatic changes in the spectral energy distributions between the l dwarf and t dwarf classes @xcite .",
    "non - equilibrium chemistry and atmospheric circulation @xcite coupled with the complex processes of condensate grain formation , growth , circulation and evaporation makes the formation , evolution and influence of condensate clouds in low - temperature atmospheres among the outstanding problems in brown dwarf astrophysics today .",
    "the disappearance of photospheric condensates at the transition between the l dwarf and t dwarf classes is one particularly interesting aspect of brown dwarf clouds .",
    "this transition occurs over a narrow range of temperatures ( @xmath7t@xmath2 @xmath1 200  k ) and luminosities ( @xmath7@xmath8 @xmath1 0.2  dex ; @xcite ) , and is accompanied by a temporary brightening at 1  @xmath9 ( the `` j - band bump '' ; @xcite ) and enhanced rates of multiplicity @xcite .",
    "these effects appear to arise from the rapid depletion of condensate clouds at the l dwarf / t dwarf transition @xcite , although the driving mechanism for that depletion is inadequately explained by current cloud models @xcite .",
    "whether arising from the fragmentation of cloud structures @xcite , a sudden increase in sedimentation efficiency @xcite or some other process remains unclear , but cloud depletion at the l dwarf / t dwarf transition has important implications on cloud evolution in other low - temperature atmospheres , such as those of extrasolar planets @xcite .",
    "coeval and cospatial multiples are important laboratories for studying this transition , eliminating dependencies on age , composition and distance .",
    "so - called `` flux - reversal '' binaries , whose components straddle the l dwarf / t dwarf transition , have verified the 1  @xmath9 brightening as an intrinsic aspect of brown dwarf evolution @xcite .",
    "yet resolved spectroscopy of the components of these systems has been difficult to obtain , due largely to the close separations typical of brown dwarf multiples ( @xmath10 @xmath11 20  au ; @xcite ) . in this article , we present a comprehensive analysis of two binaries whose components are suspected to straddle this transition : 2mass  j08503593 + 1057156 ( hereafter 2mass  j0850 + 1057 ) and 2mass  j17281150 + 3948593 ( hereafter 2mass  j1728 + 3948 ) . both were resolved with the _ hubble space telescope _ ( hst ) wide field planetary camera 2 ( wfpc2 ; @xcite ) and noted as potential l dwarf / t dwarf transition binaries based on their photometric properties and late ( combined - light ) systemic spectral types of l6 and l7 , respectively .",
    "here we combine resolved near - infrared photometry obtained with the hst / near infrared camera and multi - object spectrometer ( nicmos ) and ground - based laser guide star adaptive optics ( lgsao ) imaging with combined - light , near - infrared spectroscopy to infer component spectral types , colors and absolute magnitudes .",

    "we describe our spectral fitting procedure and determine component classifications , colors and absolute magnitudes . in section  5",
    "we compare these measures to current absolute magnitude / spectral type and absolute magnitude / color trends . in section  6",

    "the large difference in component brightnesses in the wfpc2 f814w band ( @xmath7f814w = 1.47@xmath140.09 ; @xcite ) has suggested a late - type l or early - type t dwarf secondary , although this component has been a persistent outlier in color magnitude diagrams .",

    "@xmath72 @xmath73 1 and @xmath74 are the inner and outer mass ratios . assuming that all three components have nearly equal masses , and that the inner and outer orbits have eccentricities @xmath75 = 0 ( 0.5 ) , equation  [ eqn_orbit ] requires a limit on the inner orbit semimajor axis of @xmath76 ( @xmath770.07@xmath78 ) and hence @xmath79 25  mas ( 8  mas ) , or 1  au ( 0.3  au ) , based on the semimajor axis determination of @xcite and the @xcite parallax .",
    "such a tight separation is not unusual for brown dwarf multiples ; brown dwarf spectroscopic binaries with comparable separations have already been identified ( e.g. , @xcite ) . moreover , three other tight , hierarchical , brown dwarf triple candidates identified in the literature  gliese  569bcd , @xcite , denis  j0205 - 1159abc @xcite , and kelu  1abc @xcite  exhibit evidence that one component is an unresolved pair , based on radial velocity variations , psf - fitting residuals and spectroscopic features , respectively .",
    "this scenario is also consistent with orbital mass constraints from @xcite , as the estimated total mass of a triple 2mass  j0850 + 1057 system , 0.15@xmath140.04  m@xmath12 , is closer to the mean ( but weakly constrained ) value of 0.2  m@xmath12 found in that study",
    ". indeed , tighter constraints on the total mass of this system from ongoing astrometric monitoring may affirm or refute the presence of a third body .",
    "the triple hypothesis can also be tested though radial velocity monitoring ; a @xmath115  km  s@xmath22 ( @xmath118  km  s@xmath22 ) line shift arising from a pair of 0.05  m@xmath12 brown dwarfs separated by 1.0  au ( 0.3  au ) can be readily detected with current near - infrared instrumentation @xcite .",
    "if 2mass  j0850 + 1057a is confirmed as a binary , it would complete a remarkable , young , low - mass , hierarchical quintuple system with the double m dwarf nltt  20346ab , encompassing 4 orders of magnitude in separation and composed entirely of objects less massive than 0.15  m@xmath12 @xcite .",
    "we have presented photometric and spectroscopic analyses of the late - type l dwarf binaries 2mass  j0850 + 1057 and 2mass  j1728 + 3948 , aimed at assessing component spectral types , absolute magnitudes and near - infrared colors .",
    "multi - band hst / nicmos photometry have revealed distinct trends in the relative colors of these two systems , with 2mass  j0850 + 1057b being redder than its primary and 2mass  j1728 + 3948b being bluer .",
    "neither secondary exhibits narrow - band colors consistent with being a t dwarf .",
    "these results are borne out in spectral template fits , using nicmos and @xmath0 resolved photometry , which also determine component near - infrared spectral types of l7 + l6 for 2mass  j0850 + 1057 and l5 + l6.5 for 2mass  j1728 + 3948 .",
    "the early classification of 2mass  j1728 + 3948a , its relative faintness at @xmath19 , and its unusually red color can be explained by the presence of thick condensate clouds in its photosphere .",
    "the secondary of this system , in contrast , may be losing its photospheric cloud deck as it transitions onto the t dwarf sequence . for 2mass  j0850 + 1057 , the surprisingly later spectral type of its bright primary may stem from youth ( inflated radius ) and/or unresolved multiplicity .",
    "the latter hypothesis , which would make 2mass  j0850 + 1057 part of a low - mass hierarchical quintuple , can be tested through ongoing astrometric monitoring and/or resolved spectroscopic monitoring to search for rv variations .    as two resolved ( or partly - resolved ) coeval systems spanning the end of the l dwarf sequence and exhibiting a broad range of cloud properties , 2mass  j0850 + 1057 and 2mass  j1728 + 3948 remain important laboratories for studying cloud formation and evolution in low - temperature atmospheres .",
    "improved parallactic distance measurements  including resolution of current distance discrepancies for 2mass  j0850 + 1057resolved component spectroscopy , and ongoing photometric and astrometric monitoring will aid in characterizing the clouds , spectral properties and multiplicity of these benchmark brown dwarf systems .",
