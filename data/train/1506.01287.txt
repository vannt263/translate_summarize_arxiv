    "two central distinctions in the classification of dynamical systems are that between a chaotic dynamics and a regular one as well as that between a transient dynamics and a stable one  @xcite . as all periodic dynamics are neither chaotic nor transient , being able to decide that a dynamics is periodic is hence a valuable asset when analyzing dynamical systems .",
    "we here consider this issue for the case of simulated time - continuous deterministic systems .",
    "a plethora of methods to identify periodicities in time series have been proposed in the past , which can roughly be divided into four approaches : _",
    "periodogram- _ or _",
    "autocorrelation - based _",
    "methods @xcite search and evaluate local maxima in the frequency domain or in the autocorrelation function .",
    "_ epoch - folding _",
    "techniques @xcite are based on sorting the time series values into bins according to their phase for a presumed period length and finding the optimal period length according to some test statistics .",
    "recently , approaches have been proposed that search for repeating _ patterns _ ,",
    "i.e. , subsequences of symbols @xcite . finally , ref .   proposed to search for local minima of the _ mean fluctuation function_.    with exception for the latter ,",
    "neither of these methods aims at detecting small deviations from periodicity , because under experimental conditions , for which these methods were designed , such details can rarely be captured due to noise and other confounding factors .",
    "for example , there may be no indicative difference between the fourier spectra of chaotic and similar periodic signals  @xcite .",
    "in contrast , time series from simulated systems may reflect small deviations from periodicity , which can be of considerable interest in their analysis . moreover , unless the period length is a multiple of the sampling interval , all of the above methods either do not provide a straightforward way to decide whether the time series is periodic @xcite , e.g. , via a critical value of some test statistics , or test against the null hypothesis that the time series is random @xcite , and thus do not distinguish between regular and chaotic or stable and transient time series .    using embedding techniques  @xcite or time series of an observable and its temporal derivative  @xcite , if available",
    ", one can reconstruct the dynamics s phase space .",
    "its structure and other properties may then form the basis of several kinds of analyses @xcite   some of which require a careful selection of parameters and pose a lot of pitfalls   , but only in case of sinusoidal time series is there a criterion for periodicity  @xcite .",
    "if the dynamics of a system is known , methods that go beyond the analysis of observables become available : the theory of dynamical systems allows for an analytical classification , e.g. , by analyzing the stable and unstable manifolds of fix points and separatrices between basins of attraction @xcite .",
    "another approach ( often used for continuation problems ) is finding a piecewise polynomial approximation of a periodic orbit by numerically solving the respective nonlinear equation system  @xcite .",
    "these approaches may , however , become unfeasible for complicated and high - dimensional dynamics .",
    "a method that does not suffer from these problems is computing the sign of the largest lyapunov exponent  @xcite . here",
    "the difficulty arises that a zero sign ( signifying a regular dynamics ) can only form the null hypothesis and can thus only be rejected and not accepted .",
    "we here propose a method that allows to decide whether a time series complies with a comparably conservative periodicity criterion and that is thus capable of detecting small deviations from periodicity , such as a slowly rising amplitude or period length .",
    "we first motivate and define this criterion ( sec .",

    "[ interval ] ) and finally for any reasonable period length ( sec .",

    "noise - contaminated ( sec .",
    "[ noisy ] ) test cases , we investigate our method s performance and compare it to an alternative approach based on marker events .",

    "the second parameter is the error allowance , which can be straightforwardly chosen in the case of a simulated system via the error of the integration method .",
    "the individual features of the time series do not affect the choice of either of these parameters   while they have to be taken into account for many other methods , e.g. , when choosing the marker - events for a marker - event - based approach .    for high - dimensional systems , the main computational challenge ( in terms of both , runtime and stability ) required to apply our method is evolving the system s dynamics to generate a time series .",

    "the latter is often used in continuation methods  @xcite , whom our method may assist by providing accurate starting values , namely a precise estimate of the period length as well as an approximation of the orbit by folding all dynamical variables .    it is essential for our approach that the period length does not vary considerably and that there are no phase jumps or drifts ",
    "a requirement that is almost only fulfilled by deterministic and stationary systems .",
    "moreover , our test requires errors to be small and bounded with respect to features of interest .",

    "<S> , we employ a conservative criterion for periodicity , namely that the time series can be interpolated by a periodic function whose local extrema are also present in the time series . </S>",
    "<S> our method is intended for the analysis of time series generated by deterministic time - continuous dynamical systems , where it can help telling periodic dynamics from chaotic or transient ones . </S>",
    "<S> we empirically investigate our method s performance and compare it to an approach based on marker events ( or poincar sections ) . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate that our method is capable of detecting small deviations from periodicity and outperforms the marker - event - based approach in typical situations . </S>",
    "<S> our method requires no adjustment of parameters to the individual time series , yields the period length with a precision that exceeds the sampling rate , and its runtime grows asymptotically linear with the length of the time series .    _ </S>",

    "<S> one of the main classes of dynamics are periodic ones and as a consequence deciding about periodicity is important in various scientific fields . </S>",
