    "in the latest years , lorentz - violating theories have been in focus of great interest and investigation @xcite-@xcite . despite the intensive activity proposing and discussing the consequences of a lorentz - violating electrodynamics , some experimental data and theoretical considerations indicate stringent limits on the parameters responsible for such a breaking @xcite , @xcite .",
    "these evidences put the lorentz - violation as a negligible effect in a factual ( 1 + 3)-dimensional electrodynamics , which raises the question about the feasibility of observation of this effect in a lower dimension system or in another environment distinct from the usual high - energy domain in which this matter has been generally regarded so far .",
    "condensed matter systems ( cms )  are low - energy systems sometimes endowed with spatial anisotropy which might constitute a nice environment to study lorentz - violation and to observe correlated effects .",
    "indeed , although lorentz covariance is not defined in a cms , galileo covariance holds as a genuine symmetry in such a system ( a least for the case of isotropic low - energy systems ) . having in mind that a cms may be addressed as the low - energy limit of a relativistic model",
    ", there follows a straightforward correspondence between the breakdown of lorentz and galileo symmetries , in the sense that a cms with  violation of galileo symmetry may have as counterpart a relativistic system endowed with breaking of lorentz covariance .  considering the validity of this correspondence",
    ", it turns out that an anisotropic cms may be addressed as the low - energy limit of a relativistic model in the presence of a spacelike lorentz - violating background .",
    "the attainment of an attractive electron - electron @xmath2  potential in the context of a planar model incorporating lorentz - violation is a point that sets up a clear connection between such theoretical models and condensed matter physics .",
    "theoretical planar models able to provide attractive @xmath3  interaction  potentials may constitute a suitable framework to deal with the condensation of cooper pairs , a fundamental characteristic of superconducting systems .",
    "the maxwell - chern - simons theories @xcite were addressed in the beginning 1990s as a theoretical alternative to accomplish this objective , without success . in a recent calculation @xcite , new results concerning an electron - electron interaction",
    "were also obtained in the context of a noncommutative extension of the mcs electrodynamics , revealing a non - relativistic potential nearly identical to the mcs outcome .",
    "actually , it is known that the mcs - proca models @xcite may better provide an attractive interaction due to the action of the intermediation played by the higgs sector .",
    "another well defined feature of a planar superconductor concerns the symmetry of the order parameter ( standing for the cooper pair ) , which is described in terms of a spatially anisotropic d - wave @xcite . a field theory model able to account for an anisotropic @xmath3  interaction is the first step to the achievement of anisotropy for the order parameter .",
    "this is exactly the expected result to be obtained in the case of a lorentz - violating model in the presence of a purely spacelike background , where the @xmath3  scattering potential may be identified with the one evaluated in the context of a cms endowed with a privileged direction in space .",
    "the investigation of the @xmath3  interaction can be suitably considered in the context of a lorentz - violating planar framework .  in fact , in a very recent paper @xcite ,",
    "the low - energy mller interaction potential was carried out for the case of a planar electrodynamics @xcite arising from the dimensional reduction of the carroll - field - jackiw model @xcite , for a purely timelike background . with this purpose ,",
    "the dirac sector was included in this planar model , so that to make feasible the consideration of the low - energy mller scattering ( adopted as the appropriate tool to analyze the non - relativistic electron - electron interaction ) .",
    "the interaction potential obtained revealed to be composed of a scalar and a gauge contributions .",
    "the scalar one ( coming from the scalar intermediation ) has presented a logarithmic attractive ( repulsive ) behavior near ( far from ) the origin . on the other hand",
    ", it has been shown that gauge potential , associated with the gauge intermediation , is composed of the maxwell - chern - simons ( mcs )  usual interaction @xcite corrected by background depending terms .",
    "one has also noted that these corrections lead to a gauge potential endowed with attractiveness ( for some parameters values ) even in the presence of the centrifugal barrier and the @xmath4gauge invariant term stemming from the pauli equation .",
    "thereby , one has shown that these results bypass the controversy involving the pure maxwell - chern - simons potential ( see hagen and dobroliubov @xcite ) concerning the possibility of attractiveness , and yields a strong indication that it may occur the formation of cooper pairs in this theoretical framework .",
    "having as main motivation the encouraging outcomes achieved in ref .",
    "@xcite , in this work one searches for the electron - electron potential in the context of a lorentz - violating planar electrodynamics endowed with a purely spacelike background , @xmath5 .",
    "as this kind of background fixes a 2-direction in space , it will certainly lead to an anisotropic behavior , one consequence of the directional dependence of the solutions in relation to the fixed background @xmath6 . by determining such @xmath3 potential",
    ", one can investigate two expected properties concerning the @xmath3 interaction : attractiveness and anisotropy , which are relevant due its possible connection with high - t@xmath7 superconducting systems .",
    "the procedure here adopted is the same one developed in ref .",
    "@xcite , that is , one carries out the @xmath3  interaction potential stemming from the mller scattering amplitude associated with the scalar and the gauge intermediations , exhibiting and pointing out the corrections induced by the fixed background . on the pure maxwell - chern - simons result . with this purpose ,",
    "one starts from the planar lagrangian defined in ref .",
    "@xcite , in which the dirac sector has been already included .",
    "one then carries out the @xmath3 mller scattering amplitude ( from which the interaction potential is derived according to the born approximation ) following the general guidelines set up in refs .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the potential here attained is composed of a scalar and a gauge contribution as well , since the @xmath3  interaction is equally mediated by the massless scalar and the massive gauge fields .",
    "the scalar potential maintains the logarithmic behavior ( asymptotically repulsive and attractive near the origin ) of the purely timelike case , being different only by the presence of anisotropy . as for the gauge potential , it is given by a lengthy expression composed of the pure mcs interaction and many background - depending terms which imply the presence anisotropy , among other features .",
    "it is possible to show that these corrections are able to turn this potential attractive for some values of the relevant parameters , behavior which remains even in the presence of the centrifugal barrier @xmath8 and the @xmath9 gauge invariant term .",
    "furthermore , the total interaction ( scalar and gauge potentials ) may always be attractive with a suitable adjust of the coupling parameters .",
    "this outcome constitute the essential condition to promote the condensation of cooper pairs , which shows that this theoretical framework may be useful to address some properties of superconducting systems .",

    "the corresponding interaction potentials are carried out , and the results are discussed . in sec .",
    "iv , one concludes with the final remarks .",
    "the starting point is the planar lagrangian obtained from the dimensional reduction of the cfj - maxwell electrodynamics @xcite , which consists in a maxwell - chern - simons electrodynamics coupled to a massless scalar field @xmath10 and to a fixed background 3-vector @xmath11 through a lorentz - violating term , derived from the dimensional reduction of the carroll - field - jackiw model @xcite .",

    ", in the regime of small mass the low - energy potential has to be replaced by the effective one in order to yield the gauge invariant correct behavior , requirement not necessary in the regime of large mass .",
    "another point that deserves to be analyzed concerns the influence of the background direction on the solutions .",
    "the graphics in fig .",
    "3 presents three simultaneous plots of the gauge potential for different values of the angle @xmath61 :    [ h ]    such an illustration reflects the anisotropy of the system : depending on the value of @xmath159 the potential may become totally repulsive , or exhibit a region in which is attractive .",
    "the interest in such an effect is related to its possible connection with the anisotropic parameter of order of high - t@xmath7 superconductors .",
    "an interaction potential whose intensity varies with a fixed direction indeed leads to an anisotropic wavefunction , which certainly requires additional investigation .    as a final comment",
    ", one should remark that the real potential corresponding to  the total @xmath3 interaction comprises the gauge and the scalar contributions : @xmath160 the character attractive or repulsive of this total potential arises from the combination of these two expressions for each radial region . near the origin , for instance , the total interaction goes as :   @xmath161   + y^{2}\\left [   1-\\frac { \\text{v}^{2}}{2s^{2}}(1+\\sin^{2}\\beta)\\right ]   \\right\\ }   \\ln r.\\ ] ] in the regime of  large mass , the total interaction will be attractive near the origin whenever the phonic constant @xmath162 overcomes the 2-dimensional u(1 ) coupling , @xmath163 ( or repulsive for @xmath164  far from the origin , the total potential exhibits the same logarithmic behavior stated in eq .",
    "( [ asym ] ) .",
    "it should be noted that this asymptotic behavior will change solely in the case in which a new mass parameter is introduced in , as it occurs when a spontaneous symmetry breaking takes place . * *  * * this is mentioned with more details in the final remarks . by adjusting the value of the phonic constant , @xmath16",
    ", one can certainly conclude that the total potential may always be negative at some region regardless the character of the gauge interaction , which is a relevant result concerning the possibility of obtaining @xmath3 bound states in the framework of this particular model .",
    "in this work , one has considered the mller scattering in a planar maxwell - chern - simons electrodynamics incorporating a lorentz - violating purely spacelike background .",
    "the interaction potential was calculated as the fourier transform of the scattering amplitude ( born approximation ) carried out in the non - relativistic limit .",
    "the interaction potential exhibits two distinct contributions : the scalar ( stemming form the yukawa exchange ) and the gauge one ( mediated by the mcs - proca gauge field ) .",
    "the scalar yukawa interaction turns out to be logarithmically attractive and repulsive near and far from the origin , respectively , in much the same way as verified in the purely timelike case . as for the gauge interaction , it is composed by a pure mcs potential corrected by background - depending contributions , which are able to induce physical interesting modifications despite the smallness of the background before the topological mass ( v@xmath165 .",
    "near and far from the origin , this gauge potential goes like the pure mcs counterpart , so that the observed alterations appear in the intermediary radial region .",
    "namely , it is verified gauge potential becomes attractive for some values of the parameters .",
    "such attractiveness remains even in the presence of the centrifugal barrier and gauge invariant @xmath1 term .",
    "besides the possibility of having a gauge interaction attractive , it should be mentioned that the total interaction ( scalar plus gauge potential ) may always result attractive provided a fine adjust of the coupling constants values ( @xmath166 is realized .",
    "this fact indeed constitutes a promising result in connection with the possibility of obtaining the formation of cooper pairs .",
    "it was also reported that in the regime of a large mass @xmath167 the effective low - energy gauge invariant potential becomes equal to the gauge potential with a high precision , whereas in the regime of small mas @xmath168 these two expressions become sensibly different .",
    "the real possibility of obtaining cooper pairs may be checked by means of a quantum - mechanical numerical analysis of the non - relativistic interaction potential here derived .",
    "such potential should be introduced in the schrdinger equation , whose numerical solution will provide the corresponding @xmath3 binding energies for each set of parameter values stipulated .",
    "one should remark that the values must be chosen in accordance with the usual scale of low - energy excitations in a condensed matter system .",
    "this analysis may be performed for the potentials obtained both in the case of a purely timelike and spacelike background , having in mind also the issue of the anisotropy of the resulting parameter of order .",
    "one must now comment on the validity of the approximation which has been here adopted . at first sight ,",
    "the higher order terms ( in v@xmath118  are always negligible  before the first order ones .",
    "indeed , this is true for terms that decay quickly at large distances . near the origin ,",
    "although , it might occur that a high order term ( in v@xmath118  come to increase with @xmath169 more rapidly , overcoming a first order term ,  fact which really is related to its radial dependence in  the limit  @xmath74 .  such a behavior would be observed if a second order term  ( in v@xmath118  had a more pronounced power in @xmath170 than the first order one . according to all evaluations carried out in second order , this fact was not observed , which confirms the validity of the approximation adopted as well as the outcomes obtained in this work . *  *    the absence of screening , first observed in refs .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , is here manifest only in the scalar potential expression by means of the asymptotic logarithmic term , once the gauge sector revealed an asymptotic behavior much different @xmath171 some usual planar models , in ( 1 + 2 ) dimensions , are known for exhibiting a confining ( logarithmic ) potential as representation of the gauge interaction , such behavior however does not reflect a convenient physical interaction , since it increases with distance . to represent a physical interaction , it",
    "may be changed to a condensating potential , which may be attained when the model is properly supplemented by new parameters of mass .",
    "the consideration of the higgs mechanism is a suitable tool able to provide a proca mass to the gauge field and to induce an efficient screening of the corresponding field strengths and solutions , bypassing this difficulty . in a recent work @xcite",
    ", it was accomplished the dimensional reduction of an abelian - higgs lorentz - violating model endowed with the cfj term , resulting in a planar maxwell - chern - simons - proca electrodynamics coupled to a massive klein - gordon field @xmath172 with a scalar higgs sector .",
    "this resulting higgs - lorentz - violating planar model has been analyzed in some theoretical directions , revealing new possibilities and outcomes .",
    "the classical solutions for field strengths @xmath173 and four - potential @xmath174 were carried out for a static point - like charge , yielding interesting deviations in relation to the pure mcs - proca electrodynamics @xcite .",
    "a particular feature of this model is the presence of totally screened modes ( all its physical excitations are massive ) .",
    "furthermore , one can show that it provides stable charged vortex configurations  able to bring about the associated aharonov - casher effect @xcite .",
    "the consideration of the mller scattering in this framework @xcite will certainly lead to an entirely shielded interaction potential , with the logarithmic term being replaced by k@xmath175 , k@xmath176 functions .",
