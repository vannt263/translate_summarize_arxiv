    "the dynamics of quantum many - particle systems poses a major challenge to computational physicists and chemists . in the study of ground - state properties",
    "one can rely on a variational principle , which enables a variety of powerful statistical methods ( in addition to exact diagonalization ) such as the quantum variational monte carlo method and the diffusion monte carlo method.@xcite in time - dependent situations , the absence of a practical variational principle has greatly hindered the development of equally powerful methods . yet",
    "it is hard to overestimate the importance of developing effective techniques to tackle the quantum dynamical problem .",
    "such a technique could allow , for example , to follow in real time the evolution of chemical reactions , ionization and collision processes .",
    "one of the most successful computational methods developed to date is the time - dependent density functional theory ( tddft ) , or its more recent version  time - dependent current density functional theory ( tdcdft ) .",
    "@xcite in this approach , the interacting electronic system is treated as a noninteracting electronic system subjected to an effective scalar potential ( a vector potential in tdcdft ) which is self - consistently determined by the electronic density ( or by the current density).@xcite thus , one avoids the formidable problem of solving the time - dependent schrdinger equation for the many - body wave function .",
    "even this simplified problem , however , is quite complex , since it involves the determination of @xmath0 time - dependent single particle orbitals  one for each particle .",
    "furthermore , there are features such as multi - particle excitations @xcite and dispersion forces@xcite that are very difficult to treat within the conventional approximation schemes .    an alternative approach , which actually dates back to the early days of the quantum theory , attempts to calculate the collective variables of interest , density and current , without appealing to the underlying wave function.@xcite this approach we call  quantum continuum mechanics \" ( qcm ) , because in analogy with classical theories of continuous media ( elasticity and hydrodynamics ) , it attempts to describe the quantum many - body system without explicit reference to the individual particles of which the system is constituted.@xcite    that such a description is possible is guaranteed by the very same theorems that lie at the foundation of tddft and tdcdft.@xcite indeed , consider a system of particles of mass @xmath1 described by the time - dependent hamiltonian [ defh ] h(t ) = h_0+dn()v_1(,t ) where [ defh0 ] h_0 = t + w+v_0 is the sum of kinetic energy ( @xmath2 ) , interaction potential energy ( @xmath3 ) , and the energy associated with an external _ static",
    "_ potential @xmath4 , [ defv0 ] v_0 = dv_0()n ( ) , where @xmath5 is the particle density operator . @xmath6 is an external time - dependent potential .",
    "the exact heisenberg equations of motion for the density and the current density operators , averaged over the quantum state , lead to equations of motion for the average particle density @xmath7 and the average particle current density @xmath8 : [ continuity ] _",
    "t n(,t ) = -_j_(,t ) and [ forcebalance ] m_t j_(,t)= & -&n(,t ) _ + & -&_p_(,t ) , where @xmath9 denotes the partial derivative with respect to time and @xmath10 is a short - hand for the derivative with respect to the cartesian component @xmath11 of the position vector @xmath12 . here and in the following we adopt the convention that repeated indices are summed over .",
    "these equations simply express the local conservation of particle number ( eq .",
    "( [ continuity ] ) ) and momentum ( eq .  ( [ forcebalance ] ) ) . the key quantity on the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ forcebalance ] ) is the _ stress tensor _ @xmath13  a symmetric tensor which will be defined in the next section as the expectation value of a hermitian operator , and whose divergence with respect to one of the indices yields the _ force density _ arising from internal quantum - kinetic and interaction effects .    now",
    "the runge - gross theorem of tddft guarantees that the stress tensor , like every other observable of the system , is a functional of the current density and of the initial quantum state .",
    "thus , eq .  ( [ forcebalance ] ) is in principle a closed equation of motion for @xmath14  the only missing piece of information being the _ explicit _ expression for @xmath15 in terms of the current density .    in recent years",
    "much effort has been devoted to constructing an approximate qcm@xcite and several applications have appeared in the literature ( see ref .",
    "for some representative examples ) .",
    "all approximation schemes so far have been based on the local density approximation and generalizations thereof .",
    "the objective of this paper is to derive and discuss an approximate expression for @xmath13 , and , more importantly , for the associated force density @xmath16 , as functionals of the current density and the initial state .",
    "we will do this in the _ linear response regime _",
    ", i.e. for systems that start from the ground - state of the static hamiltonian @xmath17 and perform small - amplitude oscillations about it .",
    "the external potential @xmath6 will be treated as a small perturbation . in this regime",
    "the equations of motion  ( [ continuity ] ) and ( [ forcebalance ] ) are conveniently expressed in terms of the displacement field @xmath18 , defined by the relation ( , t ) = n_0 ( ) _ t ( , t ) , where @xmath19 is the ground - state density .",
    "it is also convenient to write the density and the stress tensor as sums of a large ground - state component and a small time - dependent part , in the following manner n(,t)&=&n_0()+n_1(,t ) , + p_(,t)&=&p_,0()+p_,1(,t ) , where the equilibrium components , marked by the subscript @xmath20 , satisfy the equilibrium condition [ equilibrium1 ] n_0()_v_0()+_p_,0()=0 .",
    "then the two equations  ( [ continuity ] ) and ( [ forcebalance ] ) take the form n_1(,t ) = - _ , and [ eom.1 ] & & m n_0()_t^2 u_(,t)=-n_0()_v_1(,t ) + & & -n_1(,t)_v_0()-_p_,1(,t ) .",
    "our task is to find an expression for the force density @xmath21 as a linear functional of @xmath18 .",
    "if this can be achieved , then the excitation energies of the system will be obtained from the frequencies of the time - periodic solutions of eq .",
    "( [ eom.1 ] ) in the absence of external field ( i.e. , with @xmath22 ) .",
    "it is easy to see that the spatial dependence of these solutions will be proportional to the matrix element of the current density operator between the ground - state and the excited state in question .",
    "this is because , in a many - body system with stationary states @xmath23 ( @xmath24 is the ground - state ) , and corresponding energies @xmath25 , the n - th linear excitation is described by the time - dependent state |_0e^-ie_0t+|_ne^-ie_nt , where @xmath26 is an arbitrarily small  mixing parameter \" .",
    "the expectation value of the current density operator in this state is ( , t ) = _ 0|()|_ne^-i(e_n - e_0)t+ c.c .",
    "thus , in principle , almost all the excitation energies @xmath27 of the system can be obtained by fourier - analyzing the displacement field ",
    "the only exception being those excitations that are not connected to the ground - state by a finite matrix element of the current - density operator .    in this paper we will introduce an approximate expression for the force density [ forcedensity1 ] f_,1(,t ) -n_1(,t)_v_0()-_p_,1(,t ) , which appears on the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eom.1 ] ) , as a linear functional of @xmath18 .",
    "the expression will be presented in terms of the functional [ defeu ] e [ ] _ 0[]|h_0|_0 [ ] , which is the energy of the distorted ground - state @xmath28\\rangle$ ] , obtained from the undistorted ground - state @xmath24 by virtually displacing the volume element located at @xmath12 to a new position @xmath29 .",
    "more precisely , we will show that the equation of motion for @xmath30 takes the form : [ eom.simple ] m n_0()_t^2 ( , t ) = -n_0()v_1(,t)- , + where @xmath31 $ ] is the second order term in the expansion of @xmath32 $ ] in powers of @xmath30 .",
    "the functional @xmath31 $ ] has an exact expression in terms of the one - particle density matrix and the pair correlation function of the _ ground - state _ , which is a major simplification , since ground - state properties , unlike time - dependent properties , are accessible to computation by a variety of numerical and analytical methods .",
    "furthermore , we will show that the kinetic part of the force density functional @xmath33/\\delta \\uv$ ] is local , in the sense that it depends only on a finite number of spatial derivatives ( up to the fourth ) of the displacement field at a given position .",
    "thus , our equation of motion reduces to a fourth - order differential equation for @xmath30 when interaction effects are neglected .",
    "the inclusion of interaction effects leads to the appearance of nonlocal contributions to the energy , and the equation of motion becomes a fourth - order _ integro - differential _",
    "equation for the displacement field .",
    "however , the complexity of this equation remains essentially unchanged as the number of particles increases .",
    "our equation of motion has two especially appealing features : ( i ) it is exact for one - electron systems at all frequencies and ( ii ) it can be physically justified for generic many - electron systems at high frequency or , more generally , at all frequencies for which a collective description of the motion is plausible .",
    "thus the range of frequencies for which our approximation makes sense is expected to be wider in strongly correlated systems than in weakly correlated ones .",
    "we discuss several qualitative features of our equation ( uniform electron gas limit , harmonic potential theorem ) and present its solution in simple one- and two - electron models , where the results can be checked against exact calculations .",
    "the results are encouraging .",
    "although we are not able to resolve all the different excitation energies of the models under study , we find that groups of excitation characterized by similar displacement fields are represented by a single mode of an average frequency , in such a way that the spectral strength of this mode equals the sum of the spectral strengths of all the excitations in the group . in this sense",
    "our approximation can be viewed as a ( considerable ) refinement and extension of the traditional single - mode approximation for the homogeneous electron gas to strongly inhomogeneous quantum systems . in spite of the somewhat limited range of validity of the present treatment ( the linear response regime )",
    ", we feel that this is an important first step in a direction that might eventually lead to the construction of useful force density functionals for far - from - equilibrium processes .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we present a complete derivation of the linearized equation of motion for the displacement field .",
    "we begin by deriving a formally exact expression for the force density ( section ii a ) , on which we perform the  elastic approximation \" ( section ii b ) . the expression for the force density in the elastic approximation",

    "the analytic solution of the last model in the strong correlation regime is featured in appendix f. finally , section vi contains our summary and a few speculations about future applications of the theory .",
    "in this section we undertake the construction of an approximate expression for the force density , eq .",
    "( [ forcedensity1 ] ) , as a linear functional of @xmath30 .",
    "the stress tensor @xmath13 , whose divergence determines the force density , is defined as the expectation value of the stress tensor _ operator _ @xmath34 in the evolving quantum state @xmath35 : [ defp ] p_(,t)= ( t)| p_()|(t ) .",

    "this definition is completely analogous to the standard definition of the current density operator as the derivative of the hamiltonian with respect to a vector potential .",

    "we will now focus on the calculation of @xmath50  the correction to @xmath15 of first order in @xmath30 . in order to express @xmath51 and its divergence as functionals of the displacement field",

    "the main reason for introducing the co - moving reference frame is that in this frame we can make a simple approximation , which enormously simplifies the task of linearizing the stress tensor .",
    "this will be discussed in the next section . for the time being we proceed in a formally exact manner . to begin with , we observe that the general relation between the stress tensor in the lab frame and that in the co - moving frame is [ tensortransformation ] p_(,t)= ( _ _ ) ( _ _ ) p_((,t),t ) , where [ defptilde ]",

    "the difference arises from the fact that the coordinate transformation to the co - moving frame is time - dependent , and this generates an additional vector potential ( also a functional of @xmath30 ) , which guarantees the vanishing of the current density in the co - moving frame .",

    "( 39 ) of ref .  .",
    "as a reality check , let us ask ourselves whether the system can support excitations in which the displacement field is uniform in space : @xmath67 .",
    "clearly in this case the strain vanishes and there is no change in metrics , so @xmath68/\\delta \\uv$ ] is null . as a result , after setting the external field @xmath69 we get the equation m_t^2 u_(t)+(t ) _",

    "we have now shown that the harmonic potential is the only potential with this property .",
    "equation  ( [ eom.exact ] ) is formally exact , but it still contains the time - dependent state @xmath63 , which of course is not known . in spite of the simple behavior of the density ( constant ) and the current density ( null ) , the evolution of the many - body wave function in the co - moving frame is far from trivial .",
    "nevertheless , a simple and physically appealing approximation suggests itself .",
    "namely , we assume that the wave function @xmath73 is time - independent ( just as the density ) , and coincides with the ground - state wave function of the laboratory frame ( @xmath74 ) evaluated at the coordinates @xmath52 of the co - moving frame : [ elasticapproximation ] ( _ 1, ... ,_n , t ) _",
    "0(_1, ... ,_n ) .",
    "the physical idea behind this approximation is that the time evolution of the wave function in the laboratory frame can be approximated as a continuously evolving elastic deformation of the ground - state wave function .",
    "such a deformation affects all the particles simultaneously and instantaneously .",
    "the burden of describing the time - evolution of the system is entirely placed on the time - dependent geometry ( i.e. the time - dependent relation between @xmath52 and @xmath12 ) , while the wave function itself remains independent of time .",
    "what is _ lost _ in this approximation is the fact that in the actual time evolution the system will undergo internal relaxation in order to optimize the correlations between the particles . in other words , the probability of finding the particles in a certain configuration @xmath75 at time",

    "( [ lagrangianeom ] ) and ( [ coordinatetransformation ] ) .",
    "however , our approximation should always be valid at sufficiently high frequency , i.e. , when the evolution of the geometry is very fast on the scale of the characteristic response times of the system .",
    "the equation of motion resulting from the elastic approximation is also strictly valid ( and therefore , not an approximation at all ) for any one - particle system , because in this case the wave function _ is _ completely determined by the displacement field and there is no room for internal relaxation .",
    "finally , our equation of motion is also strictly valid for non - interacting bose systems in the ground - state ( since these systems behave like a single particle ) , and for non - interacting fermi systems consisting of at most two particles of opposite spins in the same orbital ( since these behave like non - interacting bosons ) . in all other cases  including the apparently simple case of a non - interacting many - fermion system  the appropriateness of the elastic approximation must be assessed _ a posteriori _ and may depend on the objective of the calculation .",
    "in general , we can only say that the elastic approximation is expected to work better for collective ( many - particle ) excitations than for single particle excitations , and better for strongly correlated many - body systems ( which exhibit bosonic behavior ) than for weakly correlated systems .",
    "it is important to appreciate the profound difference that exists between the present approximation and another common approximation which also entails an instantaneous response to a time - dependent field : the _ adiabatic approximation_. in the adiabatic approximation one assumes that the system remains in the instantaneous ground - state of the hamiltonian @xmath78  an assumption that is justified only if the time evolution is _ slow _ on the scale of the characteristic response time of the system .",
    "this is exactly the opposite of the regime of validity of the present approximation .",
    "the geometrically distorted wave function @xmath73 is not at all close to the instantaneous ground - state of @xmath78 .",
    "rather , it is the ground - state of the  deformed hamiltonian \" @xmath79 $ ] which is obtained from the initial - time hamiltonian @xmath17 by a coordinate transformation  indeed an elastic deformation .",
    "as anticipated in the foregoing discussion the elastic approximation paves the way for a relatively simple calculation of the complicated expression that appears in the second line of eq .",

    "the formulas presented in the last two subsections relied on the knowledge of the exact density matrices @xmath92 and @xmath93 of the many - body ground - state  two quantities that are amenable to treatment by powerful numerical techniques ( e.g. the quantum monte carlo method ) which have little in common with dft . before proceeding , we wish to clarify how the time - dependent cdft can help us in more concrete ways when the exact @xmath92 and @xmath93 are _ not _ known , which is by far the most common case .",
    "one of the main ideas of tdcdft is that the current and density evolutions of the interacting many - body system can be simulated in a non - interacting many - body system subject to an effective time - dependent vector potential which includes the hartree electrostatic potential and dynamical exchange - correlation ( xc ) effects .",
    "this non - interacting system is known as the  kohn - sham reference system \" and its ground - state density coincides with the exact ground - state density of the interacting system , i.e. @xmath19 . the potential that produces this exact ground - state density in the kohn - sham reference system is known as the static kohn - sham potential and is usually written as v_s,0()=v_0()+v_h,0()+v_xc,0 ( ) , where @xmath94 and @xmath95 are , respectively , the hartree potential and the xc potential of the ground - state .",
    "these static potentials should not to be confused with the additional dynamical hartree and xc potentials , which appear when the system is not in equilibrium .",
    "the idea is now to apply our continuum mechanics formulation directly to the kohn - sham reference system .",
    "there is a small technical problem in doing this , namely the time - dependent xc vector potential @xmath96 that acts on the kohn - sham system has in general a transverse component , which can not be represented as the gradient of a scalar potential .",
    "indeed , a complete representation of @xmath97 requires that we introduce both an electric field @xmath98 and a magnetic field @xmath99 .",
    "the inclusion of the xc magnetic field does not create any difficulties in principle ( see ref .  ) , and leads to the appearance of a lorentz - force term in the equation of motion for the current .",
    "but this lorentz force term can be safely disregarded in the linear response approximation , because it has the form @xmath100 which is of second order in the deviation from equilibrium .",

    "<S> we derive a closed equation of motion for the current density of an inhomogeneous quantum many - body system under the assumption that the time - dependent wave function can be described as a geometric deformation of the ground - state wave function . by describing the many - body system in terms of a single collective field we provide an alternative to traditional approaches , which emphasize one - particle orbitals . </S>",
    "<S> we refer to our approach as continuum mechanics for quantum many - body systems . in the linear response regime , </S>",
    "<S> the equation of motion for the displacement field becomes a linear fourth - order integro - differential equation , whose only inputs are the one - particle density matrix and the pair correlation function of the ground - state . </S>",
    "<S> the complexity of this equation remains essentially unchanged as the number of particles increases . </S>",
    "<S> we show that our equation of motion is a hermitian eigenvalue problem , which admits a complete set of orthonormal eigenfunctions under a scalar product that involves the ground - state density . </S>",
    "<S> further , we show that the excitation energies derived from this approach satisfy a sum rule which guarantees the exactness of the integrated spectral strength . </S>",
    "<S> our formulation becomes exact for systems consisting of a single particle , and for any many - body system in the high - frequency limit . </S>",
    "<S> the theory is illustrated by explicit calculations for simple one- and two - particle systems . </S>"
