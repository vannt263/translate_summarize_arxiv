    "the intrinsic coupling of electricity and magnetism is one of the cornerstones of modern physics .",
    "it goes back to the famous maxwell equations , or even earlier , to michael faraday , and one can find even earlier reports pointing in that direction .",
    "this coupling plays crucial role in all modern physics , and it is one of the foundations of modern technology  e.g.  in the generation of electricity in electric power stations , electric transformers , etc .",
    "recently this field acquired new life in spintronics , the idea of which is to use not only charge , but also spin of electrons for electronic applications .",
    "mostly one deals in this field with the influence of magnetic field and/or magnetic ordering on transport properties of materials  for example the well - known magnetoresistance or the work of magnetic tunnel junctions .",
    "but very interesting such effects can also exist in insulators .",
    "these are for example the ( _ linear _ ) _ magnetoelectric _ ( me ) _ effect _ , or the coexistence and mutual influence of two types of ordering , magnetic and ferroelectric ( fe ) ordering in _ multiferroics _  ( mf ) .",
    "such phenomena are very interesting physically , and are very promising for practical applications , e.g.  for addressing magnetic memory electrically without the use of currents , or as very efficient magnetic sensors .",
    "these factors probably caused such a significant interest in this field .",
    "it is now one of the hottest topics in condensed matter physics , and , besides magnetoelectrics and multiferroics per se , the study of these has many spin - offs in the related fields of physics , such as the study of magnetoelectric effects in different magnetic textures ( domain walls , magnetic vortices , skyrmions etc . )",
    "there are already several good reviews of this field @xcite , and there exists a very complete and useful collection of short reviews on multiferroics in the special issue of journal of physics of condensed matter  @xcite .",
    "there is also a chapter on multiferroics in my recent book  @xcite . in the present text , which is written as an introductory chapter for a planned book on multiferroics , i will more or less",
    "follow the general outline of my short review on `` multiferroics for pedestrians '' , published in physics : trends  @xcite  of course with significant additions .",
    "multiferroics are materials with coexisting magnetic and ferroelectric ordering .",
    "these systems are extremely interesting physically , and they promise many important practical applications .",
    "however one has to realize that for many practical applications , such as attempts to write and read magnetic memory in hard discs electrically , using electric fields rather than currents ( e.g.  with gate voltage devices ) , one needs not so much multiferroics but rather materials with good magnetoelectric properties : one must be able to _ modify _ the magnetic state by a changing electric field .",
    "but the idea is that it is precisely multiferroic materials in which the change of magnetic state by electric field , or vice versa , may be especially strong . from this point of view , various textures in magnetic materials which can have magnetoelectric response  such as certain domain walls of skyrmions  also attract now considerable attention .",
    "these topics will be also mentioned below .",
    "when one describes the field of magnetoelectrics and multiferroics , the first reference one usually gives is that to pierre curie  @xcite , who shortly noticed the possibility of having both magnetic and electric orderings in one material .",
    "but the real story began with a short remark in one of the famous books on theoretical physics by landau and lifshitz  @xcite , who wrote in 1959 :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ `` let us point out two more phenomena , which , in principle , could exist .",
    "one is piezomagnetism , which consists of linear coupling between a magnetic field in a solid and a deformation ( analogous to piezoelectricity ) .",
    "the other is a linear coupling between magnetic and electric fields in a media , which would cause , for example , a magnetization proportional to an electric field .",
    "both these phenomena could exist for certain classes of magnetocrystalline symmetry .",
    "we will not however discuss these phenomena in more detail because it seems that till present , presumably , they have not been observed in any substance . ''",

    "but already less than a year after its publication the seminal paper by dzyaloshinskii appeared  @xcite , who on symmetry grounds predicted that the well - known antiferromagnet cr@xmath0o@xmath1 should exhibit the linear me effect . and next year",
    "this effect was indeed observed in cr@xmath0o@xmath1 by astrov  @xcite .",
    "after that a rapid development of this field followed , initially in the study of magnetoelectrics , see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "but very soon the ideas of not only the me effect , but of real multiferroics were put forth . soon the first multiferroic  a material in which ( antiferro)magnetic and ferroelectric ordering are present simultaneously  was discovered by ascher , schmid et  al.@xcite  the ni ",
    "i boracite .",
    "( it was in fact hans schmid who later coined the very term `` multiferroics '' in connection with such materials  @xcite ) .",
    "an active program to synthesize such materials artificially was initiated , predominantly by two groups in the former soviet union : in the group of smolenskii in leningrad ( present - day st .",
    "petersburg ) and in the group of venevtsev in moscow .",
    "however , after considerable activity in the 1960s and 1970s , the interest in this field faded somewhat . a new surge of activity appeared at around 2000 , and there were three factors which stimulated it :    the first was the realization of an interesting and challenging problem in the physics of magnetic and ferroelectric materials , mostly on the example of perovskites",
    "there are quite a lot of magnetic perovskites , including famous colossal magnetoresistance manganites , or the `` two - dimensional perovskite '' la@xmath0cuo@xmath2  the parent material of high - temperature superconducting cuprates .",
    "extensive discussion of these materials , with many tables , is contained in the collection compiled by goodenough and longo in the landolt - brnstein encyclopaedia of physics  @xcite .",
    "another , even more extensive collection of tables of ferroelectric perovskites , starting with the equally famous material batio@xmath1 , was published by a group of japanese scientists  @xcite . and",
    ", surprisingly enough , a comparison of these extensive collections of tables , 100300 pages each , demonstrates that there is practically no overlap between them : a perovskite is either magnetic or ferroelectric , but practically never both simultaneously ( of course it may be neither , as is the case with the prototype mineral perovskite catio@xmath1 , which gave the name to this whole family ) . what is the reason for this mutual exclusion , and",
    "can one go around it ?",
    "this problem was known already in 19701980s , but was actually formulated only in 1999 during a workshop in santa barbara , and publicised after 2000  @xcite , and it attracted the attention of scientific community .",
    "this problem will be discussed below , in sec .",
    "[ sec:6 ] .",
    "but of course the most important were two experimental breakthroughs .",
    "one was the fabrication and study of very good films of , it seems , the best multiferroic material known at present , bifeo@xmath1 , by ramesh and his group  @xcite .",
    "this gave a possibility of studying the mf effects , and immediately opened perspectives of very appealing practical applications .",
    "bifeo@xmath1 remains until today the favourite material for many investigations , both in basic research and in applied fields .",
    "the second achievement was the discovery by two groups , of kimura and tokura , and of sang - wook cheong , of a novel class of multiferroics @xcite . in multiferroics that were known previously the ferroelectric and magnetic orderings occurred independently and were driven by different mechanisms ; typically , although not always , fe ordering starts at higher temperature . in the novel class of multiferroics discovered in @xcite",
    ", fe is driven by a particular type of magnetic ordering , and occurs only in the magnetically - ordered phase .",
    "one can call the first group `` type - i multiferroics '' , and the second group `` type - ii multiferroics ''  @xcite .",
    "i will discuss this classification and the microscopic mechanisms in action in each of these classes in sec .",
    "[ sec:5 ] . here",
    "i only want to stress that these two experimental breakthroughs gave new life to the whole field of mf and led to an enormous increase of activity in this field .",
    "the specific feature of magnetoelectric materials is the possibility of generating electric polarization by magnetic field , and vice versa , magnetization by electric field .",
    "this can be described by the relations @xmath3 where we use the standard convention of summation over the repeated indices .",
    "terms quadratic in @xmath4 , @xmath5 are typically more common and less interesting ; the most interesting effect is the presence of the first , linear terms above .",
    "this is referred to as the linear me effect , or simply the me effect .",
    "one can also describe the linear me effect by including in the expression for the free energy the term @xmath6 as the polarization and the magnetization are given by @xmath7 and @xmath8 , one immediately obtains from this expression for the free energy the first terms in ( [ eq:1 ] ) and  ( [ eq:2 ] ) .    as we see",
    ", in general in a crystal the magnetoelectric coefficient  @xmath9 is a tensor .",
    "it can have symmetric and antisymmetric components .",
    "the symmetric part of this tensor can always be transformed to a diagonal form @xmath10 ( where @xmath11 is the kronecker symbol ) . in this case the polarization for the magnetic field along the main axes would be parallel to the magnetic field .",
    "but there can also be an antisymmetric part of the magnetoelectric tensor .",
    "it is known that such an antisymmetric tensor , with independent components @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 , is equivalent to an axial vector , or pseudovector @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the totally antisymmetric levi - civita symbol .",
    "this pseudovector  @xmath17 is called the toroidal moment .",
    "if the system has a nonzero toroidal moment , then , from ( [ eq:1 ] ) , ( [ eq:2 ] ) , ( [ eq:5 ] ) one can see that for example the polarization in an external magnetic field would be @xmath18 and magnetization would be @xmath19 i.e.  they would be perpendicular to the external fields .    a very important role in the me effect is played by symmetry considerations .",
    "first of all , these refer to the symmetry with respect to spatial inversion ,  @xmath20 , and time reversal ,  @xmath21 . electric field , polarization and electric dipole moments are usual vectors , changing sign under spatial inversion , but remaining the same under time reversal : @xmath22 on the other hand , magnetization , and the magnetic field itself , are axial vectors , or pseudovectors , odd with respect to time reversal , but even with respect to spatial inversion , @xmath23 one can easily understand these rules when one recalls that magnetic field and magnetic moments are created by currents @xmath24 ; for example , for circular currents shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] we have @xmath25 .",
    "one sees from this expression that @xmath26 is even for spatial inversion ( @xmath27 ) , but odd for time reversal ( @xmath28 ) .        using this picture",
    ", one can also obtain the transformation rules of e.g.  @xmath26 or @xmath29 under mirror reflections , illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] ( see also  @xcite ) : under mirror reflections the components of @xmath29 and @xmath26 parallel and perpendicular to the mirror plane change as @xmath30        from the rules ( [ eq:8 ] ) , ( [ eq:9 ] ) one sees that the linear me effect ( liner terms in ( [ eq:1 ] ) , ( [ eq:2 ] ) , or ( [ eq:3 ] ) ) can exist in a system only if both inversion and time reversal are simultaneously broken : the energy ( [ eq:3 ] ) should be a scalar , and thus the me coefficient @xmath9 should be both @xmath20- and @xmath21-odd . for that , first of all , the system should have some magnetic ordering which breaks time reversal . in most cases",
    "this is the standard magnetic ordering , for which the average spin at a site @xmath31 , but one can not exclude more complicated states such that not the magnetic dipole @xmath32 is nonzero , but rather there exists some non - zero higher - order spin correlation function , containing an odd number of spins  e.g.  the magnetic octupole @xmath33 . and",
    "the spatial inversion should also be broken in order to have the linear me effect ; often this symmetry is broken just by a particular type of magnetic ordering .",
    "in general , the free energy may also contain terms of higher order , not only those presented in eq .",
    "( [ eq:3 ] ) . for example",
    ", we may have terms of the type @xmath34 , or similar terms written as a function of order parameters  @xmath35 and  @xmath36 , e.g.  @xmath37 , or terms  @xmath38 .",
    "the conditions for their appearance are often not so stringent as those for linear me coupling .",
    "we will not , however , consider such terms below , and will concentrate on the linear me effect .",
    "there is one general relation between the me response function @xmath39 and the usual dielectric and magnetic response , characterized by the dielectric constant  @xmath40 ( or the corresponding electric susceptibility , or polarizability ) , and the magnetic response characterized by magnetic permeability  @xmath41 or magnetic susceptibility @xmath42 , with @xmath43 .",
    "this constrain has the form  @xcite @xmath44 where @xmath45 and @xmath46 are the electric and magnetic susceptibilities .",
    "we see that one can hope to obtain strong me coupling for example close to a ferroelectric or magnetic transition , in which ( for ii  order transitions ) @xmath45 or @xmath46 diverge , @xmath45 or @xmath47 .",
    "one more point is worth addressing here .",
    "we now know very well that the electric and magnetic responses are in general frequency- and momentum - dependent , @xmath48 , @xmath49 .",
    "this dependence has very definite physical meaning .",
    "thus for example the dielectric function contains terms such as @xmath50 i.e.  it has poles at the positions of dipole - active collective excitations  @xmath51 , for example optical phonons .",
    "these modes give definite signatures e.g.  in the optical properties of solids .",
    "similarly , the structure of @xmath49 , which can be measured for example by magnetic neutron scattering , tells us about magnetic excitations in the system , such as spin waves with their spectrum @xmath52 ; and the existence of ( strong ) maximum of @xmath53 at a certain @xmath54-value  @xmath55 may be a signature of eventual magnetic instability of the system , such as the formation of spin density wave with momentum  @xmath55 , etc .",
    "one should think that , similarly , the me response function @xmath9 should also have both frequency- and momentum - dependence , @xmath56 .",
    "this question was not , to the best of my knowledge , yet studied in a general form for me materials .",
    "apparently the electromagnons  @xcite are related to this question  they should be the poles of both @xmath57 and @xmath9 , similar to eq .",
    "( [ eq:12 ] ) .",
    "but what could be , for example , the @xmath58-dependence of  @xmath9 , what would be its significance , and how can one measure it , are still open questions .",
    "one could think that there should also be some general relations for @xmath59 similar to the kramers - kronig relations or to the optical sum rule for @xmath48 , however i am not aware of any such general treatment yet ( possibly one could find some related results in the literature , but they are not formulated in this language ) .",
    "by multiferroics in a narrow sense we refer to materials having simultaneously both magnetic and ferroelectric ordering , i.e.  having two order parameters @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
    "magnetic ordering could be of different types : ferromagnetic , ferri- or antiferromagnetic , or it could be of some more complicated type .",
    "but for electric ordering one has in mind a real fe ordering , @xmath62 . sometimes in the field of ferroelectricity one",
    "also speaks about antiferroelectrics ( afe ) , but one has to realize that this notions has no strict physical meaning .",
    "magnetic transitions , of any kind , always correspond to symmetry - breaking : going from paramagnetic to magnetically - ordered state we break at least the time reversal symmetry ( and maybe some spatial symmetries as well ) .",
    "similarly , fe transition corresponds to a change of symmetry in the system from centrosymmetric to noncentrosymmetric one .",
    "however , the nominally antiferroelectric transitions do not necessarily break any symmetry : one can always formally consider any system as having electric dipoles , e.g.  inside a unit cell , pointing in opposite directions . in this sense",
    "any structural transition in a solid is accompanied by some charge redistribution and could be formally called an afe . still",
    ", sometimes it can make sense to speak about an afe transition , if this structural transition is accompanied by relatively strong anomalies in the dielectric constant  @xmath57 ; but one has to realize that this notion has no rigorous meaning . in any case , in the field of multiferroics we always have in mind the appearance of a real fe polarization , which is nonzero when averaged over the whole sample  although sometimes we also speak about _ local polarization_.    the different character of electric and magnetic ordering is reflected in one important aspect .",
    "the magnetic order parameter , e.g.the magnetization of a ferromagnet  @xmath63 or sublattice magnetization @xmath64 of an antiferromagnet are well - defined quantities , having absolute meaning .",
    "this however is not the case with electric polarization : it may depend for example on the choice of the unit cell , cf .",
    "[ fig:3 ] .",
    "it looks that with the choice of the unit cell as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:3](@xmath65 ) the polarization points from left to right ; however in the same system but with a different choice of the unit cell , fig .",
    "[ fig:3](@xmath66 ) , it points from right to left . and indeed",
    ", the accurate treatment shows , see for example a very pedagogical explanation in  @xcite , that the absolute value of polarization is not a uniquely defined quantity , but _ the change of polarization _ with changing external conditions , e.g.  temperature or electric field , is .",
    "this is also reflected in that fact that one has to use special theoretical methods ( the so - called berry phase methods ) for _ ab  initio _ calculation of polarization .",
    "the very term `` multiferroic '' was proposed by h.  schmid  @xcite . in his review article",
    "@xcite schmid also presented a classification of different symmetry classes which allow for simultaneous presence of both fe and magnetic ordering .    in speaking about multiferroics ,",
    "symmetry considerations play a crucial role .",
    "both time reversal  @xmath21 and spatial inversion symmetry  @xmath20 should be broken . and",
    "one also needs one unique vector  @xmath29 which has to go to @xmath67 under inversion .",
    "one sees that these symmetry requirements are the same as those needed to get the linear me effect .",
    "an important question is in which cases would one get me , with polarization existing only in an external ( magnetic ) field , and when will we have real multiferroics , with spontaneous polarization existing without any external field . for me",
    "both @xmath21 and @xmath20 should be broken , but the product @xmath68 is conserved : by consecutive application of time reversal and spatial inversion we would return to the initial state . for multiferroics , however , not only @xmath21 and @xmath20 but also the product @xmath68 should be broken .",
    "thus by looking at these symmetries one can understand whether a particular material with a given magnetic structure would be a real multiferroic or only a magnetoelectric .",
    "the examples mentioned above demonstrate this .",
    "the classical me material cr@xmath0o@xmath1 has a crystal and magnetic structure with the main element shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:3](@xmath65 ) ( the inversion centre is marked by the encircled cross  @xmath69 ) . of course , as in all magnetic states , time - reversal is broken right away .",
    "according to the rules formulated above , spatial inversion is also broken ( it transforms spin @xmath70 to  @xmath71 ) .",
    "but simultaneous inversion and time reversal ( inversion of spin directions ) returns the state to the original one , i.e.  @xmath72 , @xmath73 , but @xmath74 .",
    "therefore this system is me but not mf . on the other hand , for example in the structure shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:3](@xmath66 ) , with alternation of ions with different charges , e.g.  @xmath75 and  @xmath76 , and with the magnetic structure @xmath77 ( this is a schematic representation of a real situation in ca@xmath1comno@xmath78  @xcite , see also  @xcite and fig .",
    "[ fig:10 ] below ) , not only @xmath21 and @xmath20 , but also @xmath68 are broken , time reversal following inversion leading to a state different from the initial one . and indeed this gives real multiferroics  @xcite .",
    "one still has to be slightly careful with his classification : to have a real fe in the usual sense one has to have the ability to reverse polarization , @xmath79 , by applying a proper electric field  @xmath4 ( the poling procedure , which gives the famous polarization loop , @xmath80 hysteresis ) . in some systems , however , the electric field required for that is too strong to be realized in practice , so that the polarization is always pointing in one direction , and we can not switch it . in this case one speaks not about ferroelectrics , but rather about pyroelectrics  @xcite .",
    "there are such examples also among `` multiferroic '' compounds .",
    "thus pbvo@xmath1 has a tetragonal structure of the same type as the famous ferroelectric pbtio@xmath1 , but the distortion in it leading to the formation of dipole moments is so strong that the polarization can not be reversed  @xcite ( maybe it would possible to realize this in corresponding films ? ) .",
    "thus pbvo@xmath1 should rather be called a magnetic pyroelectric , not a multiferroic .",
    "still , symmetry considerations are extremely useful , and actually crucial in the whole big field of multiferroics .",
    "one can find corresponding treatment for example in the review  @xcite or in  @xcite .",
    "we will not dwell on this topic any more , and will rather discuss more microscopic aspects of the physics of multiferroics .",
    "speaking of microscopic mechanisms , one can first of all say that , despite the huge variety of different types of magnetic ordering , most of all `` strong '' magnets are conceptually the same , see e.g.  @xcite : due to strong electron ",
    "electron interaction or strong electron correlations the state is formed with localized electrons ( which for integer number of electrons per cite are the mott , or mott  hubbard insulators ) , i.e.  the state with localized magnetic moments  localized spins .",
    "the exchange interaction between these localized moments leads to a certain magnetic ordering at low temperatures . depending on specific details , such as electron configuration of respective ions , orbital occupation , detailed type of the lattice , etc .",
    ", we can have quite diverse types of magnetic ordering , but the general picture  the presence of localized electrons or localized spins with particular exchange interaction  remains the same .",
    "the situation with ferroelectrics is more diverse and much more complicated . there",
    "exist many different microscopic mechanisms leading to ferroelectric behaviour . and all the diversity of ferroelectrics and of eventual multiferroics is mainly connected just with this diversity of mechanisms of ferroelectricity .",
    "thus , we can have systems in which there exist structural units , e.g.  molecules similar to hcl , each of which has nonzero dipole moment just `` by construction '' . and some ordered arrangement of such units could in principle make a material ferroelectric .",
    "it is known for example that among many forms of water ice there is one which is ferroelectric .",
    "another mechanism is met in hydrogen - bonded ferroelectrics . to these belong some inorganic compounds , e.g.  kh@xmath0po@xmath2 ( kdp ) , but mostly organic systems , for example the first ferroelectric discovered in nature ",
    "the rochelle or seignette s salt nakc@xmath2h@xmath2o@xmath81h@xmath0o ( this compound even gave the name to this very phenomenon in several languages , where ferroelectricity is called seignetoelectricity )  although the exact nature of fe in this material is still a matter of debate . in both cases above there may exist some magnetic ions in `` other parts '' of the system , so that in effect such systems may become multiferroic .    for us",
    ", however , other types of multiferroics are of more importance . these are fe or mf with fe driven by the covalency of transition metal ( tm ) ions with surrounding cations ( ligands ) , for example with oxygen ; `` geometric '' ferroelectrics ; and ferroelectrics with lone pairs",
    ". we will now proceed to a short description of these three classes of materials .",
    "however , before that , we will briefly discuss two general notions .",
    "one can divide all multiferroics into two big groups , which we can call type - i and type - ii multiferroics  @xcite ; we have already shortly mentioned this classification in sec .  2 .",
    "the multiferroics we have mostly discussed until now , with the mechanisms of ferroelectric ordering listed above , have independent mechanisms of fe and magnetic ordering , occurring at different temperatures ( usually with fe transition above the magnetic one , but not necessarily so ) .",
    "these are type - i multiferroics .",
    "ferroelectricity often occurs in them at rather high temperatures  thus in bifeo@xmath0 @xmath82 , and in ymno@xmath1 @xmath83 .",
    "magnetic ordering , occurring independently , can also be rather high : in bifeo@xmath1 @xmath84 , so that it is a good multiferroic already at room temperature . in general such systems",

    "however there is another , more microscopic explanation of the appearance of ferroelectricity in systems such as batio@xmath1 : the establishment of a strong covalent bond of the transition metal ion , here ti , with one ( or several ) of the surrounding oxygens at the expense of weakening the bond with the other ones , see fig .",
    "[ fig:6 ] .",
    "one can show , see e.g.  @xcite , that the energy gain by the corresponding shift @xmath96 of ti ions from the centres of o@xmath78 octahedra is @xmath97 . as the elastic energy loss is also quadratic in  @xmath96 , @xmath98",
    ", such phenomenon may occur only if the gain of covalency energy exceeds the elastic energy loss , for which one needs strong electron ",

    "one is simply that the ions with empty @xmath105-shells are usually smaller than those with @xmath109 ( @xmath111 ) configurations , so that such small ions can easily shift from the centre of a large o@xmath78 octahedral cavity .",

    ".        one can think of yet another factor which could suppress the formation of tm  o covalent bonds leading to ferroelectricity , or at least make it less favorable  @xcite .",
    "the covalent bond is a typical singlet chemical bond , e.g.  with the wave function of the type @xmath113 , as in the h@xmath0 molecule in the heitler  london approximation .",

    "but one has to realize that this mutual exclusion is not a `` theorem '' ; it is a game of numbers , and the physical factors described above , though making this coexistence highly unlikely , do not forbid it . and",

    "but probably the more natural route to create multiferroics in perovskites is the route first taken by several groups ( see reviews in  @xcite )  to make a mixed perovskite containing fe - active ions with the configuration  @xmath106 , and magnetic ions with configuration @xmath109 , @xmath111 , in the hope that every species will do `` what it wants '' . and",

    "as mentioned in the footnote on p.  , there are many multiferroics with improper fe , in which fe appears as a secondary effect ( a `` by - product '' ) of a primary ordering , e.g.  of rotation and tilting of structural units in a crystal , such as @xmath36o@xmath78 octahedra . the best known and the most important examples of systems with this mechanism of fe are the hexagonal systems @xmath95mno@xmath1 ( where @xmath95 is a small rare earth ion ) , e.g.  ymno@xmath1",
    ". these systems sometimes are called hexagonal perovskites , although they have not much in common with real perovskites except similar - looking chemical formulae . in these systems",

    "they form layered structures with triangular mn layers .",
    "similar to conventional perovskites , here these building blocks also have a tendency towards tilting and rotation , to guarantee the close packing of the lattice . at such distortions ( in perovskites",
    "they are called gdfeo@xmath1-distortion ) there appear short @xmath115o pairs with a dipole moment .",
    "but in perovskites @xmath104o@xmath1 these dipoles in neighboring cells are oriented in opposite directions and cancel each other , and in the standard case they do nt lead to net ferroelectricity ( unless one uses special tricks to avoid this compensation ) .",
    "however in systems such as ymno@xmath1 there is no such compensation .",
    "the geometric mechanism of ferroelectricity in these systems , which presents a good example of improper ferroelectrics , was established in  @xcite .",
    "these materials , with their interesting magnetic structure , present nowadays an important playground for studying , in particular , the characteristics of multiferroic domains and .",
    "one extra comment must be made in connection with geometric ferroelectrics and multiferroics .",
    "we have explained its origin by the rotation and tilting of building blocks of a system , e.g.  @xmath36o@xmath78 octahedra in perovskites or @xmath36o@xmath118 trigonal bipyramids in systems such as ymno@xmath1 .",
    "this one , in its turn , is usually explained by the tendency towards close packing of rigid ions , characterized , for perovskites @xmath100o@xmath1 , by the tolerance factor @xmath119 : for @xmath120 the system remains cubic , but for smaller values of  @xmath121 there occurs rotation and tilting of the @xmath100o@xmath78 octahedra , see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "but if we look more deeply , beyond the simplified picture of rigid ions , we realize that it is again a certain tendency of chemical bonds , in this case predominantly bonds , which leads to such distortions .",
    "thus in effect it is always local chemistry which is responsible for the formation and stability of one or the other crystal structure , in particular fe one .",

    "[ fig:7](b ) , making `` left '' and `` right '' ions in a dimer inequivalent , each such dimer ( a `` molecule '' ) would have a dipole moment ( double arrows in fig .  [ fig:7](b ) ) , and the entire system may become ferroelectric .",
    "this mechanism was first proposed in  @xcite , and it is now detected in some materials . and if some constituting ions are magnetic , such systems would simultaneously become multiferroic .        concluding this section , a few general remarks are in order .",
    "when considering electric polarization , one usually speaks about two contribution to it , the ionic and the electronic contributions .",
    "fe transition is always a structural phase transition from the paraelectric phase with centrosymmetric crystal structure to the low - temperature state with lattice symmetry with broken inversion , belonging to a pyroelectric class  @xcite .",
    "as with all structural transitions , besides a shift of ions there is also a redistribution of electron density ( actually a change of chemical bonding ) .",
    "consequently , one can speak about two contributions to the total polarization in ferroelectrics : an ion contribution and an electronic one ( although , strictly speaking , it may be impossible to define those rigorously ) .",
    "by electronic contribution we have in mind , more specifically , the fe caused by the change of electronic distribution at fixed positions of ions . of course ,",
    "if we then `` release '' the lattice , the ions would relax and the ionic positions would adjust to the change of electronic density .",
    "still , the main driving mechanism could be predominantly electronic .",
    "usually these contributions are determined theoretically , for example using _",
    "ab  initio _ calculations .",
    "and the outcome turns out to be not universal , and it strongly depends on the system .",
    "thus , in perovskites @xmath95mno@xmath1 with small rare earth @xmath128 ,  , with the @xmath4-type magnetic structure , ionic and electronic contributions are comparable  @xcite , but in tbmno@xmath1 the ionic contribution dominates , electronic contribution being only about 10% of the ionic one ( and in opposite direction )  @xcite . but in principle there can exist situations with polarization of predominantly electronic character , see above and the next section .",
    "by type - ii multiferroics we refer to multiferroics in which ferroelectricity exists only in a magnetically - ordered state , and is in fact _ driven _ by a particular type of magnetic ordering .",
    "it was the discovery of such mf  @xcite that invigorated the entire field of multiferroics and which made them such a hot topic . from a symmetry point of view",

    "this produced an inhomogeneous electric field in the film , see fig .",
    "[ fig:12 ] , and it was observed that the nel domain walls were attracted to the region of stronger electric field .",
    "this experiment , besides demonstrating the appearance of electric dipoles on nel domain walls , opens a way to control such domain wall by the electric field , which may be extremely useful in manufacturing new electrically - controlled memory media and devices .",
    "yet another experimental observation which can be easily explained if we invoke the physics described above is the detection of helicoidal magnetic structures in thin films ( monolayer , bilayer ) of magnetic metals on nonmagnetic substrates  @xcite .",
    "the first such results were obtained on a monolayer of manganese on tungsten  @xcite , see fig .",
    "[ fig:13 ] .",
    "it was observed that instead of forming a collinear magnetic structure , a cycloidal spiral was formed ( fig .",
    "[ fig:13 ] is a simplified schematic picture , which shows the situation if the mn layer were ferromagnetic ; see the original publication for the actual structure ) . from what we have learned in sec .",
    "[ sec:7 ] , it is clear that the cycloidal spiral would produce a polarization and a corresponding electric field , perpendicular to the surface .",
    "but , vice versa , the intrinsic electric field always existing at the surface of a metal ( due to the double - charge layer , or the potential drop  the work function of the metal ) , which is normal to the surface , would have the tendency to create a cycloidal spiral from the initially collinear spin structure . and",
    "as this intrinsic electric field in the double layer always has the same sign on the entire surface , all the spirals in such monolayer would have the same sense of rotation , e.g.  clockwise .",
    "this phenomenon should be quite general , since such potential drop exists at the surface of every metal .",
    "but this tendency to rotate the spins would act against the magnetic anisotropy , always present at the surface , and in order to be observable it must be strong enough to overcome this anisotropy .",
    "this is why such cycloidal structures are found not on all magnetic layers on top of any metal .",
    "one needs at least a strong spin ",
    "orbit coupling at the surface ( we remind that the mechanism leading to ( [ eq:8new ] ) ,  ( [ eq:9new ] ) , is in fact the spin  orbit interaction ) , for which it is better to use a heavy metal as a substrate ; and it is also desirable to have magnetic metals without very strong single - site anisotropy .    the authors of the original papers themselves proposed an explanation which relies on the dzyaloshinskii",
    " moriya interaction at the surface  @xcite ( which always exists in this case , since the inversion symmetry is broken by the surface itself ) .",
    "in fact , physically this is the same explanation as the one described above ( as mentioned previously , the microscopic mechanism of the relations ( [ eq:8new ] ) ,  ( [ eq:9new ] ) is in fact the same dzyaloshinskii ",
    "moriya interaction ) .",
    "however the picture presented in fig .",
    "[ fig:13 ] is simpler and more transparent , even if it is conceptually the same . by the way ,",
    "the same coupling of magnetic and electric degrees of freedom at the surface , which lies at the core of our picture , is also very similar to the recent proposal  @xcite explaining the large magnitude of rashba spin ",
    "orbit coupling at the surface by the important role of electric dipoles at the surface layer",
    ".      there may exist different magnetic textures in normal magnets : not only domain walls , but also , for example , magnetic vortices , fig .",
    "[ fig:14](@xmath65 ) ,  ( @xmath66 ) , or skyrmions , fig .",
    "[ fig:14](@xmath130 ) .",
    "one can show that all such objects would exhibit a linear magnetoelectric effect  @xcite .",
    "the `` head to tail '' vortices of fig .",
    "[ fig:14](@xmath65 ) are classical examples of systems with toroidal moment  @xmath160 , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:14](@xmath65 ) by a double arrow .",
    "this means that here we would have a me of the type described in sec .",
    "[ sec:6 ] , with e.g.  the polarization  @xmath29 perpendicular to the magnetic field  @xmath161 , @xmath162 , and similarly with magnetization  @xmath26 induced by electric field  @xmath163 , @xmath164 . on the other hand , the `` radial '' vortex of the type of fig .",
    "[ fig:14](@xmath66 ) would have a linear me effect with a _ symmetric _ me tensor @xmath39",
    ", i.e.the polarization would be parallel to the external magnetic field ( along the principal directions in which @xmath39 is diagonal ) .",
    "skyrmions ( `` magnetic hedgehogs '' ) can be of two types .",
    "most often , fig .",
    "[ fig:14](@xmath130 ) , in the `` middle part '' of a skyrmion the spins are rotating as in fig .",
    "[ fig:14](@xmath65 ) . in this case",
    "the skyrmions would also exhibit transverse me effect .",
    "but in the case of `` radial '' skyrmions ( real `` hedgehogs '' ) the me would be longitudinal . the me effect in skyrmions was recently experimentally observed in  @xcite .",
    "interestingly enough , skyrmions can also be created on magnetic layers on the surface of a metal  @xcite , apparently due to the mechanism described in the previous subsection .      from what we have learned in studying the cycloidal type - ii multiferroics , sec .",
    "[ sec:7 ] , we can predict yet another interesting effect  electric activity of spin waves  @xcite . as is well known , see e.g.  @xcite , a quasiclassical picture of magnons in a ferromagnet is the precession of spins along the direction of magnetization , fig .  [ fig:15 ] .",
    "as we see , in this case the instantaneous picture ( a `` snapshot '' ) is that in which the perpendicular ( @xmath165 ) component of magnetization forms a cycloid in @xmath165-plane .",
    "consequently , according to our understanding reached in studying type - ii multiferroics , eqs .",
    "( [ eq:8new ] ) ,  ( [ eq:9new ] ) , such spin wave should carry , besides magnetization , also an electric dipole perpendicular both to magnetization and to the magnon wavevector  @xmath140 ( double arrow in fig .  [ fig:15 ] ) .",
    "one can also give this effect a completely classical interpretation .",
    "it is well - known that there exists a circular magnetic field around a wire carrying a current , fig .",
    "[ fig:16](@xmath65 ) .",
    "correspondingly , the field of two such wires with currents in opposite directions would produce a magnetic field , or magnetic moment , located between the wires and pointing in the direction marked on fig .",
    "[ fig:16 ] by a double arrow .",
    "( the fields far away from the double wire would cancel . )",
    "but there exists a well - known symmetry between magnetic and electric phenomena , exemplified best of all by the maxwell equations .",
    "correspondingly , the motion of a magnetic dipole , which can be represented as a parallel motion of south and north poles , or positive and negative magnetic charges ( although such monopoles do not exist separately ) , would correspond to magnetic currents running in opposite directions , as in fig .  [",
    "fig:16](@xmath66 ) , and in effect such `` currents '' created by a magnon  classically the propagating magnetic dipole  would be accompanied by an electric field , or electric dipole shown in figs .",
