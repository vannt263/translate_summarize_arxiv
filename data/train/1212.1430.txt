    "one of the major challenges in the analysis of nonlinear pdes is to understand oscillations and concentrations in weakly converging sequences of functions since these phenomena distinguish weak from strong convergence in @xmath1-spaces . in its most simple form , this observation is already expressed in vitali s classical convergence theorem , by which a norm - bounded , non - oscillating ( contained in the requirement of convergence in measure ) , non - concentrating ( equiintegrable ) sequence is seen to converge strongly .",
    "this connection between `` abstract '' compactness and `` concrete '' oscillation and concentration effects also supports the view that questions of compactness have a `` physical '' meaning and should be studied for their own sake , cf .",
    "@xcite .",
    "another motivation for such a study is that often sequences of interest are constrained by a linear differential constraint ( curl - freeness for a sequence of gradients for instance ) and/or pointwise constraints .",
    "then , compensated compactness theory , see for example  @xcite , considers whether these additional restrictions allow one to improve weak to strong compactness ; in fact , in this vein , the term `` compensated compactness '' should probably be replaced by `` compactness by compensation '' ( which is also closer to the french original `` compacit par compensation '' ) , but we here stick to the more conventional terminology . at the heart of this investigation",
    "is an analysis of _ compatibility _ between these constraints and different shapes of oscillations and concentrations .",
    "if together the constraints rule out any such phenomena , then we indeed have the sought improvement of weak to strong compactness .    starting with simple scalar defect measures , more and more refined tools have been developed to study these questions .",
    "the basic philosophy here is to retain as much information as possible about the sequence in an `` extended limit '' because weak convergence always involves a lossy averaging operation .",
    "perhaps the most well - known objects of this kind are young measures , introduced by young in  @xcite .",
    "they represent the asymptotic value distribution of oscillations in sequences : a bounded sequence @xmath2 ( @xmath3 ) allows for the selection of a subsequence ( not relabeled ) that generates a young measure @xmath4 , defined to be a parametrized family of probability measures on @xmath5 , with the property that @xmath6 for any carathodory integrand @xmath7 such that the sequence @xmath8 is equiintegrable .",
    "intuitively , the family @xmath9 contains the asymptotic value distribution of the sequence @xmath10 and thus reflects oscillations .    as an important extension , diperna and majda  @xcite compactified the target space to describe concentration effects as well .",
    "the generalized young measure ( or diperna  majda measure ) generated by @xmath10 now adds to the classical young measure @xmath4 a positive radon measure @xmath11 on @xmath12 and another parametrized family @xmath13 of probability measures on the unit sphere @xmath14 of @xmath5 ( @xmath15 always denotes the unit ball in @xmath5 ) .",
    "it allows us to compute limits of a larger class of nonlinear quantities with @xmath16-growth : @xmath17 whenever @xmath18 has at most growth of order @xmath16 and the @xmath16-recession function @xmath19 ( describing the behavior of @xmath18 at infinity ) exists in a sufficiently strong sense : @xmath20 here , @xmath11 and @xmath21 respectively describe the location and value distribution of concentration effects in the sequence .",
    "recent works on this topic include  @xcite .",
    "a different set of ideas , which could be considered an `` analysis '' , is expressed in tartar s theory of h - measures  @xcite or , equivalently , grard s microlocal defect measures  @xcite .",
    "switching to a phase - space or microlocal perspective , these objects enable us to quantify not only the location but also the _ direction _ of oscillations and concentrations .",
    "h - measures are not able to retain the asymptotic value distribution expressed in the young measure , and are furthermore restricted to the ; however , some extensions to an @xmath1-setting are possible , see  @xcite .",
    "the question of whether it is possible to combine the complementary approaches of young measures and h - measures and to find a tool allowing one to study _ at the same time _ the location , value distribution , and direction of oscillations and concentration effects in @xmath1-bounded sequences of functions , has remained open for some time ( cf .",
    "chapters  38 ,  39 in  @xcite and  @xcite for some remarks on this problem ) .",
    "the principal aim of this work is to introduce precisely such a tool , called the * microlocal compactness form * ( mcf ) generated by an @xmath1-bounded sequence , where @xmath22 .",
    "the following are some of its main features :    * mcfs allow one to represent limits for a large class of nonlinear integral functionals ; in particular , the young measure is ( essentially ) contained . *",
    "the directional information about oscillations and concentrations in the generating sequence is preserved and the h - measure can be reconstructed ( in an @xmath23-setting ) .",
    "* differential and pointwise constraints on the sequence are reflected in the generated mcf and in fact hold for _ any _ generating sequence ( contrary to the situation for young measures , for which generating sequences can have very different properties ) .",
    "consequently , mcfs provide new `` geometric '' proofs in compensated compactness theory .",
    "* mcfs can be defined for all @xmath1-spaces , @xmath22 . *",
    "they enjoy the same compactness properties as the weak convergence , i.e.  @xmath1-boundedness is enough for the extraction of a generating subsequence . *",
    "the @xmath16-compactness wavefront set of an mcf is defined as the analogue of the wavefront set in classical microlocal analysis , but with respect to weak ",
    "strong compactness and not @xmath24-regularity like in the classical notion .",
    "* when considering a laminate ( nested microstructure ) , its hierarchy is reflected in the generated mcf .",
    "* mcfs contain enough information to serve as the foundation of a relaxation theory for integral functionals in the presence of anisotropy .",
    "* for some hyperbolic systems , one can derive equations for mcfs that express the propagation of singularities .",
    "since we are interested in directional properties of oscillations and concentrations , the definition of microlocal compactness forms involves the fourier transform .",
    "in fact , it is well - known that by switching to a fourier point of view we can understand the intuition behind weak convergence phenomena much better : fourier - transforming a sequence of functions @xmath25 in @xmath23 that oscillate with increasingly higher frequencies ( e.g.  @xmath26 ) , one observes that the fourier transforms @xmath27 push mass out to infinity . applying parseval s theorem ,",
    "the duality pairings with a test function @xmath28 can be written as @xmath29 since @xmath30 decays at infinity , integrating @xmath27 against @xmath30 corresponds to `` band - limiting '' the sequence @xmath10 and consequently , infinitely high frequencies are lost from the weak limit @xmath31 .",
    "these considerations also persist for concentration effects , which are highly localized in space , and hence , by the uncertainty principle , are strongly smeared out in fourier space .",
    "the band - limiting effect of a test function then implies that this fourier mass is again lost in the limit .",
    "we conclude from this informal discussion that a tool aiming to improve the study of oscillations and concentrations must look at `` infinite frequencies '' only  microlocal compactness forms will do just that .",
    "another conclusion that can be drawn from this heuristic point of view on weak convergence is that for _ infinite _ frequencies it is possible to `` circumvent '' the uncertainty principle for the fourier transform : localizing in real space corresponds to smearing out the fourier transform , but when a packet of fourier mass wanders out to infinity , it does not matter how much smeared out it is ( we always look at conical neighborhoods around directions ) .",
    "this simple observation will enable us to construct a theory fulfilling all the aforementioned properties .",
    "after these preliminary considerations , we can now state the main idea of microlocal compactness forms : consider for a bounded sequence @xmath2 the double limit @xmath32 } { \\;\\mathrm{d}}x.\\ ] ] here , @xmath33 , is a test function with sufficient regularity and we further require that its recession function @xmath34 exists in the sense @xmath35 this choice for the class of test functions will capture the location and value distribution of oscillations and concentrations . most often , we will not refer to @xmath36 directly , but only through @xmath37 for reasons of consistency with the notation for generalized young measures .",
    "next , @xmath38 is a positively @xmath39-homogeneous fourier multiplier with sufficient smoothness , serving to represent directional information as well as differential constraints .",
    "the family @xmath40 consists of smooth functions with @xmath41 on the ball @xmath42 and support inside @xmath43 , whose purpose it is to cut off all finite frequencies .",
    "finally , by @xmath44 we denote the fourier multiplier operator with symbol @xmath45 .",
    "the fundamental existence theorem in section  [ ssc : def ] will establish that for all admissible @xmath46 the limit in   can be expressed as @xmath47 which is a sesquilinear form in @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "here , @xmath50 and @xmath51 are parametrized sesquilinear forms and @xmath52 is a finite borel measure on @xmath12 .",
    "the first part corresponds to oscillations , the second part to concentrations in the generating sequence @xmath10 .",
    "in the course of this paper we will show that this object indeed quantifies the difference between weak and strong compactness of the sequence @xmath10 and has all the properties alluded to before .",
    "in particular , we will consider applications to compensated compactness theory ( section  [ ssc : comp_compact ] ) , laminates ( section  [ ssc : laminates ] ) , relaxation ( section  [ ssc : relax ] ) , and to the propagation of singularities in hyperbolic systems ( section  [ ssc : propagation ] ) .",
    "besides the theories of young measures and h - measures , also classical microlocal analysis has served as inspiration for the present work . following the groundbreaking work by hrmander , kohn , nirenberg ( see chapter  viii of  @xcite for historical references )",
    ", this theory has been very successfully applied to linear pdes  @xcite and to a degree also to nonlinear pdes  @xcite . however , for nonlinear equations , microlocal analysis suffers from the defect that it measures @xmath24-regularity , which is often not well adapted to nonlinear pdes .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : after recalling some preliminaries and fixing notation in section  [ sc : setup ] , we move to the heart of the matter in section  [ sc : mcf ] and prove the main existence theorem as well as many basic properties of mcfs , including a result on how the information of both the young measure and the h - measure can be extracted from an mcf .",
    "we consider concrete oscillations and concentrations in section  [ sc : osc_conc ] and give a few basic examples .",
    "then , section  [ sc : diff_constr ] examines how differential constraints on a sequence are reflected in the generated mcf and establishes a general compensated compactness theorem .",
    "finally , section  [ sc : appl ] concludes the paper by considering the applications mentioned above .",
    "the author wishes to thank , among others , giovanni alberti , camillo de lellis , sebastian heinz , dorothee knees , jan kristensen , alexander mielke , ayman moussa , stefan mller , and richard nickl for stimulating discussions related to the topic of the paper , partly during the oberwolfach workshops on `` variational methods for evolution '' in december 2011 and on the `` calculus of variations '' in july 2012 .",
    "by @xmath53 we denote the open ball around a point @xmath54 with radius @xmath55 ; the special notation @xmath15 will be used for the unit ball in @xmath5 .",

    "we equip this matrix space with the hilbert structure generated by the scalar product @xmath64 , whereby we obtain the frobenius norm @xmath65 .",

    "continuous and continuously differentiable functions are contained in the spaces @xmath82 with norms @xmath83 .",
    "the spaces `` @xmath84 '' and `` @xmath85 '' additionally entail that the contained functions vanish at the boundary / infinity or have compact support .      in order to capture the behavior of functions defined on @xmath5 at infinity we need to consider a suitable compactification of @xmath5 .",
    "the sphere compactification to be defined shortly , has turned out to be a good compromise between simplicity and generality and is used widely , see for example chapter  32 of  @xcite or  @xcite in an h - measure context and  @xcite in the context of ( generalized ) young measures .",
    "in contrast to the one - point compactification @xmath86 ( `` @xmath87 '' refers to the disjoint union ) it retains information about the `` directions of infinity '' . on the other hand , it is still sufficiently concrete to be useful in our analysis ( but more general compactifications up to the stone ",

    "for the proof consider without loss of generality the case @xmath111 and choose @xmath48 to be a tensor product of test functions .",

    "we can thus extend the class of admissible `` symbols '' @xmath303 to all @xmath481 of the form @xmath482 for @xmath33 a carathodory function and @xmath483 such that @xmath484 is continuous .",
    "we call these symbols @xmath18 * compound symbols * and define @xmath485    the question whether one can define @xmath223 for even more general compound symbols depending on @xmath214 , @xmath212 , and @xmath486 , and how much smoothness is minimally necessary , is rather intricate . in this context",
    "it is well known that for symbols of pseudo - differential operators some smoothness is indispensable , even for @xmath487-boundedness ; a classical example for this can be found in chapter  vii of  @xcite .",

    "this approach , however , has a significant drawback , namely that now some @xmath214-regularity is genuinely needed ( as can be seen from the proofs of the schwartz kernel theorem ) , so the interpretation of the duality pairing between a symbol and an mcf is less clear .",

    "we leave finer investigations into the propagation of singularities and compactness to future work .",
    "for now we only remark in closing that in the context of the above extended ( mcf ) system , the compensated compactness theorem  [ thm : cc_general ] allows one to prove statements about the `` ellipticity '' present in the system .",
