    "the numerical modelling of capacitively coupled radio - frequency ( ccrf ) plasma reactors has a great importance for understanding the processes in methane plasma and their influence on carbon film deposition , which helps for reactor design and improvement of plasma technologies .",
    "basic experimental information about ch@xmath0 ccrf discharge plasma composition was obtained by group of sugai @xcite .",
    "the numerical models of methane plasma have been intensively developed during the recent decade .",
    "the most widely used approach is the fluid plasma model ( @xcite@xcite ) .",
    "a comprehensive overview of their results can be found in @xcite and @xcite . in most of these works , the electron energy distribution function ( eedf )",
    "is found using various approaches and then the rate constants of electron - neutral reactions are evaluated by integration of eedf with the known energy - dependent cross section of each reaction .    another technique , more accurate but demanding much more computation efforts , is direct particle simulation @xcite , called particles - in - cells monte - carlo collision method ( pic - mcc ) .",
    "this approach allows to obtain eedf and the rates of electron - neutral reaction by direct monte - carlo simulations of particles trajectories . for methane discharge",
    ", such simulations in one - dimensional case were performed in @xcite and @xcite . in work",
    "@xcite , each type of chemical species present in plasma was treated by particle simulation method , but to make calculations efficient , a limited number of species ( electrons , ions and 5 neutrals ) was chosen , and the scheme of chemical reactions was simplified . besides , the electron - impact vibrational excitation reactions , which affect the electron energy distribution , were not considered .",
    "another approach is presented in work @xcite , where the pic - mcc simulations were proceeded only for electrons with accounting of 18 electron ",
    "neutral reactions , thus providing the reaction rates , while the kinetics of ions and neutral species ( with total number of 20 ) was treated using diffusion  drift approximation and mass balance .    since pioneering work of levitskii @xcite",
    "the different modes of ccrf discharge operation were studied intensively in the experiments ( @xcite ) and numerically ( @xcite@xcite ) .",
    "godyak @xcite have studied experimentally the transition between the low voltage and high voltage modes in argon and helium . in kinetic simulations @xcite and applying a two  electron",
    " group fluid model @xcite the @xmath1 transition in a rf discharge was studied in helium .",
    "another type of heating  mode transition was found in the experiment in a low pressure argon discharge @xcite .",
    "an increase of the electron temperature in the midplane with pressure growth was associated in @xcite with a change of mechanism of electron heating , involving the ramsauer effect . in the ccrf discharge in silane the transition between different modes",

    "@xcite the transition between different modes of ccrf discharge in methane was studied in one  dimensional simulations with using the combined pic ",
    "mcc algorithm .",
    "the phase diagram of mode location was constructed for wide range of gas pressures and discharge currents .",
    "the hysteresis was found in the ccrf discharge behavior with current variation .    in this work",
    ", we present a two - dimensional ( 2d ) pic - mcc simulation of ccrf methane discharge in an axisymmetrical reactor , performing the pic - mcc approach for both electron and ion kinetics .",
    "one of the points of interest was the existence of different regimes in 2d simulations .",
    "besides , the gas phase chemistry in discharge plasma was also simulated and compared with experiment .",
    "the developed pic - mcc approach is two - dimensional in space and three - dimensional for particles motion ( 2d3v ) . in monte - carlo collisions simulations of electron kinetics , besides the elastic scattering , six electron - methane reactions were considered ( listed in table 1 ) , with the same cross sections as in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "electron  electron coulomb scattering , secondary electron emission and wall reflection were neglected so all particles reaching the chamber walls were eliminated .    in ion kinetics , for simplicity ,",
    "only one type of ion ch@xmath3 was considered , which is dominant in methane plasma @xcite and other main types of ions present in methane ( c@xmath4h@xmath3 , ch@xmath5 , ch@xmath6 ) have a similar form of density profiles ( shown , for example , by simulations in @xcite ) , so it is possible to represent the total amount of ions by one type only .",
    "methane discharge plasma can be treated as electropositive @xcite , so negative ions were not taken into account . for positive ion",
    ", the transport cross sections were taken to match the experimental results of ion mobility in methane @xcite .",
    "ion and ion  electron collisions were not considered .",
    "the time of free flight in mcc simulations is treated by null collisions method .",
    "the equations of motion were solved by explicit scheme , the time step was chosen 10@xmath7 s for electrons and 40 times larger for ions .",
    "the number of simulated particles usually was 100000 for both electrons and ions .",
    "the space charge density , used for solving poisson equation , is approximated using particles  in  cells technique .",
    "the self - bias voltage was adjusted to keep time - averaged current equal to zero and its value was imposed on the grounded electrode .",
    "potential on powered electrode was set equal to applied rf voltage .",
    "the poisson equation was solved on two - dimensional cylindrical grid with 150 - 200 nodes in discharge axis direction and 50 - 80 nodes in radial direction , condensing near outer electrode edge .",
    "the main assumption of discharge model is that the kinetics of charged particles was simulated in pure methane . as the characteristic time of relaxation of gas mixture composition",
    "is of 10@xmath8 - 10@xmath9 rf cycles , for the complete pic - mcc discharge simulation including plasma chemistry dynamics a special algorithms devoted to this problem should be developed , which is the subject of further work .",
    "the calculations of plasma chemical composition using electron - methane reaction rates obtained in discharge simulations are presented in section iv .",
    "it was shown , for methane pumping through the reactor chamber at such rates that time of gas residence in discharge volume @xmath10 is of 0.1 sec by order of magnitude , the most abundant chemical species usually have densities 10@xmath11 times less than methane ( see below ) , so we expect the kinetics should not change critically .",
    "also the abundance of excited state of methane is neglected , which is a common assumption @xcite .    the axisymmetrical physical domain for plasma simulation",
    "is shown in figure 1 .",

    "chemical reactions taken into account in gas phase chemistry model .     ( a ) and ch@xmath4 ( b ) obtained for p=123 mtorr , @xmath12= 80 v , @xmath10=150 ms.,width=508 ]    = 1.2 cm ( a ) , and in axial direction at @xmath13=7 cm ( b ) , for the same discharge conditions as in figure 8 .",
    "densitiy of ch radical is multiplied by 1000.,width=508 ]    the set of gas phase chemical reactions was taken as in @xcite with reactions responsible for c@xmath4h@xmath14 radical balance added from @xcite ( see table 2 ) .",
    "the volume rates of electron - methane reactions are obtained in discharge simulation as two - dimensional profiles and used as production terms for corresponding species .",
    "the account of ion - methane reactions 5 and 6 requires the information about ion mixture composition , which is not considered in pic - mcc simulations .",
    "however , preliminary calculations show that a simplification can be made to exclude the ion reactions from the chemical model .",
    "since the rate constant of reactions 5 and 6 are high enough , estimation shows that ch@xmath15 and ch@xmath16 ions exist for a few free paths only before conversion to ch@xmath17 and c@xmath4h@xmath17 , which do not take part in gas phase chemistry . as each type of ion has the only one way of chemical conversion , the volume rate of reaction 5 can be assumed equal to those of 3 .",
    "the same applies to reactions 6 and 4 .",
    "so the reactions 3,5 and 4,6 may be combined and replaced by :    3,5 : 2ch@xmath0 + e = ch@xmath17 + ch@xmath18 + 2e    4,6 : 2ch@xmath0 +",
    "e = c@xmath4h@xmath17 + h@xmath4 + h + 2e    with the rates equal for those of reactions 3 and 4 , respectively .",
    "thus the effect of ion - methane reactions is accounted through their production rates and only neutral species remain in the chemical reactions system .    the rate constant of reaction 10 , found in literature , ranged from @xmath19= 10@xmath20 @xcite to 10@xmath21 @xcite and 1.7@xmath2210@xmath23 @xmath24 @xcite .",
    "this rate constant strongly affects the solution for ch@xmath4 radical , because ch@xmath0 has the largest density and reaction 10 is the main loss term for ch@xmath4 . for the other species its influence is weak .",
    "we used it as a fitting parameter , and found that the best agreement with experiment @xcite is achieved for @xmath19= 1.5@xmath2210@xmath21 @xmath24 , which is close to used in @xcite or @xcite .    to take into account the effect of convection , we considered reactor with gas inlet through the centre of reactor and outpumping at the outer boundary . for these model calculations the field of gas velocity @xmath25",
    "was simplified :    @xmath26 @xmath27    where @xmath28 is the gas inlet radius ( taken as 0.5 cm ) .",
    "density of ch@xmath0 was held constant at @xmath29 in order to make a feed term in convection .",
    "the value of @xmath30 was defined to give a chosen time @xmath10 of gas residence in reactor , which was varied in calculations from @xmath10 = 15 ms to 300 ms .",
    "although assuming @xmath31 to zero may be a rough approximation , especially for the central region , calculations show that the density profiles are not very sensitive to details of @xmath32 field in central region , but depend mostly on @xmath10 .",
    "the balance equations are approximated using finite - difference scheme in cylindrical physical domain ( see figure 1 ) and integrated on time by runge - kutta method until the solution converged to steady state .",
    "the densities of radicals converge fast , while solution for stables requires physical time of about 2@xmath10 .",
    "a typical result of two - dimensional gas phase chemistry simulation is presented in figures 8 and 9 .",
    "the electron - methane reaction rates were taken for discharge at p=123 mtorr , @xmath12= 80 v , @xmath10 was chosen as 150 ms .",
    "figure 8 show two - dimensional density profiles of the main radicals ch@xmath18 and ch@xmath4 . as the discharge regime is close to as , the density has maxima near electrode sheaths , where electron - methane reactions are localized ( see figure 6(d ) ) .",
    "profile of ch@xmath18 is more flat due to its larger time of chemical decay .    figure 9(a )",
    "show the profiles @xmath33 in radial direction , plotted by solid lines for radicals , which profiles are shown at @xmath34=1.2 cm , where radical density is maximal , and by dotted lines for stable species ( their profiles are almost flat in axial direction ) .",
    "figure 9(b ) shows profiles @xmath35 of same species in axial direction at the outer edge of electrodes ( @xmath13=7 cm ) , where all densities are maximal .",
    "the profiles of ch , which has in our calculations density less than 10@xmath9 @xmath36 , are enlarged by factor of 1000 .",
    "for @xmath10=150 ms , the most abundant stable c@xmath4h@xmath37 has maximal density 10@xmath11 times less than methane ( 4.3 @xmath22 10@xmath38 @xmath36 ) , so the neglecting of chemistry influence on discharge physics is possible .",
    "radical at @xmath34=1.2 cm , for the same discharge conditions as in figure 8 but different @xmath10 : 17 ms ( 1 ) , 35 ( 2 ) , 70 ( 3 ) , 150 ( 4 ) and 300 ms ( 5 ) . curve 6 corresponds to infinite @xmath10 ( no convection).,width=384 ]    calculations with various @xmath10 show , that the density profiles of stable species , which main loss term is convection , are approximately proportional to @xmath10 . for radicals , the profiles are determined also by diffusion and chemical decay , so for low gas velocities the influence of convection is weak .",
    "the effect of @xmath10 variation on ch@xmath18 density profile is shown in figure 10 .",
    "the upper curve was obtained with zero convection term , when the steady state solution is achieved only for radicals .",
    "of course our discharge simulation remains valid only for small enough @xmath10 ( of 100 ms order of magnitude ) , while we can still neglect the change of gas composition , so this curve shows only the possible limit of convection influence .",
    "it is seen , that the density saturates with increasing of @xmath10 , at first in the outer region , where gas velocity is smaller .",
    "for @xmath39100 ms it becomes saturated for the most part of reactor , so we usually made calculations with @xmath10=150 ms ( for our reactor geometry and p=123 mtorr this corresponds to gas feed rate of 55 sccm , which is close to used in experiments @xcite .",
    "the behaviour of h and c@xmath4h@xmath14 profiles is similar . for ch@xmath4 and ch ,",
    "the profile is much less sensitive to @xmath10 , because the main loss term for them is the chemical decay .",
    "calculations with various pressure were made to compare the profiles of ch@xmath18 and ch@xmath4 radicals with the observed in @xcite .",
    "the simulated pressures were 300 , 140 , and 57 mtorr , the other conditions were the same as for figure 8 .",
    "the results are presented in figure 11(a , b ) for ch@xmath18 and figure 11(c , d ) for ch@xmath4 .",
    "figure 11(a ) shows ch@xmath18 profiles , plotted at @xmath13= 4.5 cm , where they were measured in experiment @xcite , for pressures 140 and 300 mtorr .",
    "the agreement with experiment for p=140 mtorr is fine .",
    "note that the only fitting parameter was the rate constant @xmath19 .",
    "for p=300 mtorr the profile exhibits two maxima , similar to experiment , but the calculated density is some larger , especially near the grounded electrode .",
    "figure 11(c ) shows the same for ch@xmath4 .",
    "the agreement for 140 mtorr is good again , but profiles are more steep than in experiment , especially for 300 mtorr , where calculated density is very small in the centre of discharge gap .",
    "this may be caused by underestimation of the electron ",
    "methane reaction rates in the discharge center for high pressures .",
    "this shows that for pressures of 300 mtorr and higher the developed kinetic model is not very accurate . in figures 11(b ) and 11(d ) the both radical profiles are shown for 57 mtorr . although the calculated profiles are more steep than the observed , the agreement can be considered as satisfactory .",
    "( a , b ) and ch@xmath4 ( c , d ) radicals for different pressures .",
    "solid curves and squares correspond for p=140 mtorr ( a , c ) and 57 mtorr ( b , d ) ; dashed curves and trangles - for p=300 mtorr ( a , c).,width=508 ]    we can say the calculated profiles exhibit the similar behaviour as the observed in experiment .",
    "the shape of described in @xcite density humps and transition to flat profiles with pressure decreasing are simulated well .",
    "we suppose that the appearance of density humps indicate the transition from vd to as regimes , which is consistent with our simulations .",
    "the quantitative agreement is good in pressure range from 50 to 150 mtorr for both radicals , especially for ch@xmath18 .",
    "also for ch@xmath18 it is within 30% in range 50@xmath40300 mtorr . as for ch@xmath4 ,",
    "the calculated densities in plasma bulk are underestimated for pressures larger than 150 mtorr .",
    "accelerated pic - mcc method was applied to two - dimensional simulation of capacitively coupled radio frequency discharge in methane .",
    "the obtained spatial distributions of mean electron energy and electron  methane reaction rates show existence of two regimes of discharge glow .",
    "the first , with active sheaths , is characterized by hot electrons localized in electrode sheaths and relatively cold electrons in other discharge volume , hence the reactions proceed in electrode sheaths regions and are suppressed in the plasma bulk . for the case of the second one , with volume domination ,",
    "the electron energy is more uniform and the reactions take place in all discharge volume .",
    "the transition between discharge regimes for one  dimensional geometry was previously studied in @xcite using combined pic ",
    "mcc model .",
    "unlike the 1d results , where the transition occurs abruptly at some critical current density , in 2d case transition is gradual , with continuous evolution of mean electron energy and reaction rates profiles . for the considered reactor geometry it was found , that the vd regime is observed for low rf voltages ( 40 - 60 v ) , and turns to as with voltage increasing .",
    "the transition proceeds in @xmath12 range from 60 to 120 v and is noticed firstly at the spatial profile of electron  methane reaction rates . for @xmath12 over 120 v the regime is definitely as .",
    "it was also noted , that the mean electron energy profile tends to saturate for @xmath12 over 150 v , and changes very little with further voltage increasing . for",
