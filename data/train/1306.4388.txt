    "this is the sequel to the article @xcite devoted to solving the longstanding problem of determining the ( grothendieck ) fusion coefficients , for admissible level @xmath0 wess - zumino - witten models , from a formula of verlinde type .",
    "the main issue here is that initial attempts to do so , using the standard verlinde formula for highest weight modules @xcite , led to certain `` fusion coefficients '' being _ negative _ integers @xcite ( we refer to @xcite for further historical detail ) .",
    "the mechanism responsible for these negative coefficients was only obtained recently @xcite for the admissible level @xmath2 .",
    "there , it was pointed out that this negativity resulted from assuming that the irreducible modules of the spectrum were all highest weight and from not properly accounting for the regions of convergence of the highest weight modules characters ( see @xcite for a more detailed discussion ) .    while this mechanism accounts for what goes wrong in applying the standard verlinde formula , the problem of how to modify this formula so as to obtain non - negative integer fusion coefficients remained",
    "this was addressed in @xcite wherein the modular properties of the @xmath0 models at levels @xmath2 and @xmath3 were analysed .",
    "the main result was that a continuous version of the verlinde formula may be applied to each of these theories and that the results were consistent with the known fusion rules ( which have only been computed for these levels @xcite ) .",
    "in particular , the continuum verlinde formula yielded non - negative integers that precisely reproduced the grothendieck fusion coefficients . the aim of this article is to generalise the continuum verlinde computations to all admissible levels , for @xmath0 at least , and show that the mechanism identified to generate the negative `` fusion coefficients '' when @xmath2 is also responsible in this greater generality .",
    "the methodology employed here to tame the modular properties of fractional level wess - zumino - witten models is but one instance of a general programme we are developing ( see @xcite for a review ) to deal with verlinde formulae for _ logarithmic _ conformal field theories .",
    "indeed , it is known that the @xmath0 models with @xmath2 and @xmath3 are necessarily logarithmic @xcite and this is surely the case more generally .",
    "this programme is , in some respects , a far - reaching extension to general logarithmic conformal field theories of ideas which were originally developed in the string theory literature to deal with supersymmetric and non - compact spacetimes ( see @xcite for example ) . besides the @xmath0 theories considered here , this programme has already been successfully applied to the grothendieck fusion rules of @xmath4 @xcite , its extended algebras @xcite and its takiff version @xcite , the @xmath5 singlet and triplet models @xcite and even the virasoro algebra @xcite .",
    "we begin , as always , with notation and conventions .",
    "section  [ sec : sl2reps ] describes this for @xmath0 and its highest weight modules before introducing the conjugation and spectral flow automorphisms which play such a vital role in what follows .",
    "section  [ sec : admissible ] defines the notion of admissibility , first for the level @xmath1 and then for @xmath6-modules .",
    "theorems of adamovi and milas are then quoted @xcite giving the irreducible admissibles in the category of highest weight modules and the category of _ relaxed _ highest weight modules .",
    "we then introduce an analogue of the kac table familiar from the virasoro minimal models to organise the admissible irreducibles . finally , we extend our collection of admissibles using spectral flow and catalogue the relationships between spectral flow versions of irreducible admissibles . at this point",
    ", we define appropriate notions ( following @xcite ) of `` standard '' , `` typical '' and `` atypical '' modules . in this",
    "setting , all highest weight admissibles are atypical and a standard module is typical if and only if it is irreducible .",
    "our first main result is the character formula for a general standard module . unlike the characters of the highest weight modules , the standard characters do not converge anywhere and",
    "must be represented as distributions .",
    "the result , given in section  [ sec : typchar ] ( proposition  [ prop : chers ] and corollary  [ cor : chtyp ] ) , describes the character as a sum of delta functions weighted by virasoro minimal model characters .",
    "this is surely a manifestation of quantum hamiltonian reduction @xcite and it lifts the observation of @xcite , where it was noticed that residues of admissible highest weight characters involved minimal model characters , to a much more elegant setting .",
    "the modular transformation rules of the standard characters are then computed in section  [ sec : modtyp ] ( theorem  [ thm : typmod ] ) and we verify that one obtains a ( projective ) representation of the modular group of uncountably - infinite dimension . moreover , the `` s - matrix '' is seen to be symmetric and unitary .",
    "section  [ sec : atypchar ] then addresses the atypical characters .",
    "we wish to determine them as distributions so as to avoid the convergence issues that stymied progress for so long , so we derive resolutions for each atypical module in terms of reducible but indecomposable ( atypical ) standard modules .",
    "the resulting character formulae then allow us to compute the modular transformation rules of ( certain ) atypical characters in section  [ sec : modatyp ] ( theorem  [ thm : atypmod ] ) .",
    "in particular , we obtain the s - transformation of the vacuum character ( the vacuum module is highest weight , hence atypical ) .",
    "these atypical computations rely on a rather ungainly identity ( lemma  [ lem : usefulidentity ] ) whose representation - theoretic significance is not yet apparent to us . presumably , generalising these results to higher rank affine kac - moody algebras will clear this up .    in any case",
    ", we now have all the ingredients to apply the obvious continuum analogue of the verlinde formula . assuming that this does yield the grothendieck fusion coefficients ,",
    "we then compute the complete set of grothendieck fusion rules explicitly .",
    "this is detailed in section  [ sec : verlinde ] ( see propositions  [ prop : fustyp ] , [ prop : fusirrtyp ] , [ prop : fusirrirr ] and [ prop : fusdrs ] ) .",
    "when we can be sure that the corresponding fusion products are completely reducible , these results can be immediately lifted to the fusion ring itself . in this way , we prove ( theorem  [ thm : fusionsubring ] ) that the fusion ring of an admissible level theory always contains a subring isomorphic to that of a particular non - negative integer level theory .",
    "one consequence is that one obtains , for almost all admissible levels , a non - trivial simple current generalising that which gives the @xmath7 ghosts in the @xmath2 theory @xcite .",
    "another consequence of our explicit computations is that all the grothendieck fusion coefficients , as computed by the continuum verlinde formula , are _ non - negative integers _ ( theorem  [ thm : grfuscoeffpos ] ) . because the resolutions we have used lead to alternating sums for atypical characters in terms of standard ones , this non - negativity result is highly non - trivial and represents a very strong endorsement of our claim that the continuum verlinde formula does indeed give the grothendieck fusion coefficients correctly .",
    "a second strong endorsement is discussed in section  [ sec : kohsorba ] where we recover the `` fusion rules '' of @xcite , negative coefficients and all , for all admissible levels @xmath1 , by applying the mechanism explained in @xcite to our grothendieck fusion rules .",
    "these two endorsements give us complete confidence that we have solved the longstanding problem of modular properties and verlinde formulae for fractional level wess - zumino - witten models .    throughout the text",
    ", we illustrate our results by applying them to the levels @xmath2 and @xmath3 , thereby checking against what was reported in @xcite .",
    "section  [ sec : examples ] concludes the article by discussing three other admissible level theories which are also of independent interest . in each case , we exhaustively describe the grothendieck fusion rules and compute the extended algebra defined by the simple current guaranteed by theorem  [ thm : fusionsubring ] . when @xmath8 , we obtain in this way a conformal embedding of @xmath9 into @xmath10 . when @xmath11 , the extended algebra is the reduced @xmath12 superconformal algebra at @xmath13 .",
    "finally , @xmath14 yields an interesting simple current extension that we tentatively identify with the quantum hamiltonian reduction of @xmath15 .",
    "of course , there are many points that remain to be addressed .",
    "first , it is clear that one should be able to generalise our results to higher rank fractional level affine kac - moody algebras and superalgebras and it would be extremely interesting to do so .",
    "moreover , the relationship ( if any ) between these fractional level models and the wess - zumino - witten models on non - compact lie groups requires clarification . even at the level of @xmath0 , there are many fascinating questions still to consider , for example , that of classifying modular invariant partition functions for the admissible level theories .",
    "mathematically , one should also ask after homological characterisations of the spectrum : what is the physical category of modules ? which modules are projective in this category ?",
    "which are rigid ?",
    "can we characterise admissible staggered modules as was done for the virasoro algebra in @xcite ? even more interesting , and perhaps more relevant for comparison with non - compact target space models , what happens if we relax the irreducibility of the vacuum module ?",
    "it is clear that the study of logarithmic theories with affine symmetries will remain rich and rewarding .",
    "we hope to report further on this study in the future .",
    "consider the simple complex lie algebra @xmath16 and its standard basis elements @xmath17 this basis is tailored to a triangular decomposition respecting the adjoint ( conjugate transpose ) that picks out the real form @xmath18 . indeed , the cartan element @xmath19 is clearly self - adjoint and the raising and lowering operators @xmath20 and @xmath21 are swapped by the adjoint . in what follows ,",
    "we want to study conformal field theories whose symmetry algebras are the affine kac - moody algebras @xmath0 at levels @xmath1 which are not non - negative integers .",
    "the well - known quantisation of the level for the wess - zumino - witten model on @xmath22 suggests that one should not lift the @xmath18 adjoint to @xmath0 .",
    "instead , the absence of level - quantisation for @xmath23 leads us to propose lifting the adjoint that picks out the other real form @xmath24 .",
    "the @xmath24 adjoint simply negates the basis elements @xmath20 , @xmath19 and @xmath21 , hence may be described as negation followed by complex conjugation : @xmath25 .",
    "this means that this basis is not suited to triangular decompositions that respect the @xmath24 adjoint . for this reason ,",
    "we choose a new basis @xmath26 of @xmath16 : @xmath27 because @xmath28 and @xmath29 with respect to the @xmath24 adjoint , this basis is suited to the desired triangular decomposition .",
    "note that the non - vanishing commutation relations in this basis are @xmath30 } = 2 e , \\qquad { \\bigl [ e , f \\bigr ] } = -h , \\qquad { \\bigl [ h , f \\bigr ] } = -2 f.\\ ] ] similarly , the trace form in this basis attracts an unfamiliar sign : @xmath31 we remark that choosing the adjoint correctly is not just mathematical sophistry  this choice plays a subtle , but vital , role in many aspects of the representation theory , unitarity being the most obvious .",
    "an example of this subtlety appears in the @xmath2 theory which has a simple current extension which fails to be associative when the @xmath18 adjoint is chosen @xcite .",
    "the associative extension one obtains with the @xmath24 adjoint is , of course , the @xmath7 ghost system ( see section  [ sec : examples ] ) .",
    "the commutation relations of the affine kac - moody algebra @xmath0 are therefore @xmath32 } & = + 2 e_{m+n } , \\\\ { \\bigl [ h_m , f_n \\bigr ] } & = -2 f_{m+n } , \\end{aligned } \\qquad \\begin{aligned } { \\bigl [ h_m , h_n \\bigr ] } & = 2 m \\delta_{m+n,0 } k , \\\\ { \\bigl [ e_m , f_n \\bigr ] } & = -h_{m+n } - m \\delta_{m+n,0 } k , \\end{aligned } \\qquad \\begin{aligned } { \\bigl [ e_m , e_n \\bigr ] } & = 0 , \\\\ { \\bigl [ f_m , f_n \\bigr ] } & = 0 . \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath33 is central .",
    "we will habitually replace @xmath33 by its common eigenvalue @xmath1 , the level , when acting upon the modules comprising each theory .. doing this at the level of the lie algebra is a standard sloppiness which leads to no harm . ] with this replacement , the sugawara construction gives the standard energy - momentum tensor @xmath34 at least when @xmath35 .",
    "the modes @xmath36 of @xmath37 then generate a copy of the virasoro algebra of central charge @xmath38 here , we take the opportunity to introduce the notation @xmath39 .    the triangular decomposition that we have chosen for @xmath16 lifts , in the standard manner , to one for @xmath0 .",
    "the notions of highest weight states and verma modules are then available .",
    "an easy consequence of is that a highest weight state of weight ( @xmath40-eigenvalue ) @xmath41 will have conformal dimension ( @xmath42-eigenvalue ) @xmath43 we will denote the verma module generated by a highest weight state of weight @xmath41 by @xmath44 .",
    "the irreducible quotient of @xmath44 will be denoted by @xmath45 if @xmath46 , and by @xmath47 otherwise .",
    "the notation here is chosen to reflect the nature of the zero - grade subspace ( the states of minimal conformal dimension ) of the irreducible as an @xmath16-module . when @xmath46 , this subspace forms a finite - dimensional irreducible @xmath16-module , whereas it forms an infinite - dimensional irreducible of the discrete series type otherwise .",
    "we will refer to @xmath48 as the vacuum module and its highest weight state @xmath49 as the vacuum in what follows .    the subgroup of automorphisms of @xmath0 which leave the span of the zero - modes @xmath40 , @xmath33 and @xmath42 invariant is isomorphic to @xmath50 .",
    "we take the order two generator to be the _ conjugation _ automorphism @xmath51 which is the weyl reflection corresponding to the finite simple root .",
    "the infinite order generator is the _ spectral flow _",
    "automorphism @xmath52 which may be regarded as a square root of the affine weyl translation by the ( finite ) simple coroot ( in fact , @xmath52 is translation by the dual of the finite simple root ) .",
    "these automorphisms fix @xmath33 , hence the level @xmath1 is preserved , and otherwise act as follows : @xmath53 the normality of the subgroup generated by @xmath52 follows from @xmath54 .    one important use for these automorphisms is to modify the action of @xmath0 on any module @xmath55 , thereby obtaining new modules @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "the first is precisely the module conjugate to @xmath55  its weights are the negatives of the weights of @xmath55 , though the conformal dimensions remain unchanged .",
    "the second is called the _ spectral flow _ image of @xmath55  its weights have been shifted by a fixed amount , but its conformal dimensions also change .",
    "explicitly , the modified algebra action defining these new modules is given by @xmath58 it is easy to check that if @xmath59 is a state of weight @xmath41 and conformal dimension @xmath60 , then the state @xmath61 satisfies @xmath62 in what follows , we will usually omit the superscript `` @xmath63 '' which distinguishes the induced spectral flow maps between modules from the spectral flow algebra automorphisms . which is meant should be clear from the context .",
    "recall that when the level @xmath1 is a non - negative integer , the ( chiral ) spectrum of any conformal field theory with @xmath0 symmetry and an irreducible vacuum module may only contain the irreducible modules @xmath45 with @xmath64 .",
    "this is the spectrum of the wess - zumino - witten model on @xmath22 .",
    "the reason boils down to the following fact : let @xmath65 denote the highest weight state of the vacuum verma module @xmath66 . as @xmath67 , @xmath66 possesses a non - trivial singular vector @xmath68 , meaning that it is not descended from the trivial singular vector @xmath69 , which has to be set to zero in order to form the irreducible vacuum module @xmath48 .",
    "setting this singular vector to zero is only consistent with the state - field correspondence of conformal field theory if the spectrum is restricted as above .",
    "this seems to have been first explained in @xcite , though the argument has since been modified and made rigorous within the formalism of vertex algebras by zhu @xcite .",
    "it is natural to ask if there are other levels at which an irreducible vacuum module similarly constrains the spectrum .",
    "to have such constraints , one needs to know when the corresponding vacuum verma module has a non - trivial singular vector .",
    "this question may be answered using the kac - kazhdan formula @xcite for the determinant of the shapovalov form in each ( affine ) weight space .",
    "the result is that such a non - trivial singular vector exists precisely when @xmath70 moreover , the singular vector will have weight @xmath71 and conformal dimension @xmath72 .",
    "levels @xmath1 satisfying the above conditions are called _",
    "equivalently , @xmath1 is said to be admissible if the universal vertex algebra corresponding to @xmath6 is not simple .",
    "determining the constraints that this singular vector imposes on the spectrum is not quite as easy .",
    "one has a semi - explicit formula for the singular vector due to malikov , feigin and fuchs @xcite .",
    "however , this formula involves rational powers of the affine modes which must be massaged using analytic continuations of the commutation rules in order to arrive at an explicit expression ( see @xcite for concrete examples of such massaging ) .",
    "the level @xmath3 has @xmath73 , hence @xmath74 and @xmath75 .",
    "this level is therefore admissible .",
    "kac - kazhdan tells us that the non - trivial singular vector in the vacuum verma module has weight @xmath76 and conformal dimension @xmath77 .",
    "it is given , in the malikov - feigin - fuchs form , by @xmath78 for deriving constraints , it is in fact more convenient to consider the descendant @xmath79 whose weight is @xmath80 .",
    "this state will also be set to @xmath80 in the irreducible vacuum module .",
    "massaging the above expression appropriately leads to the ( renormalised ) explicit form @xmath81 the field @xmath82 , and so its zero - mode @xmath83 , must therefore act as @xmath80 on the spectrum .",
    "but , applying @xmath83 to a highest weight state @xmath84 of weight @xmath41 gives @xmath85 hence we conclude that the only highest weight states allowed are those with weights @xmath80 , @xmath86 and @xmath87 .",
    "it follows that the only highest weight modules in the spectrum are the irreducibles @xmath48 , @xmath88 and @xmath89 .    for @xmath2 , we have @xmath90 and @xmath91 , so this level is also admissible .",
    "the non - trivial singular vector has weight and conformal dimension @xmath92 , and its zero - weight descendant takes the form @xmath93 the zero - mode of the field @xmath82 then acts on a highest weight state as @xmath94 so the allowed highest weight modules are the irreducibles @xmath48 , @xmath95 , @xmath96 and @xmath97 .",
    "as these examples show , unpacking the malikov - feigin - fuchs formula for the non - trivial vacuum singular vector is extremely cumbersome .",
    "it is therefore rather remarkable that the constraints upon the spectrum have been worked out for arbitrary admissible levels .",
    "this result is due to adamovi and milas @xcite who determined zhu s algebra using an explicit formula of fuchs @xcite for a projection of the non - trivial singular vector onto the universal enveloping algebra of @xmath16 .",
    "modules which are allowed in the spectrum of an admissible level theory are also said to be _",
    "the spectrum of admissible highest weight modules is as follows :    let @xmath98 be an admissible level and let @xmath99 the admissible highest weight modules are then exhausted by the following irreducibles :    * @xmath100 , for @xmath101 , * @xmath102 , for @xmath101 and @xmath103 .",
    "mathematically , admissibility just means that the highest weight module is a module for the ( simple ) vertex algebra associated with @xmath0 at the admissible level @xmath1 .",
    "it is convenient to extend this definition of admissibility beyond the highest weight category  from now on , any vertex algebra module will be termed admissible .",
    "note that when @xmath104 , so @xmath67 , the set of @xmath105-type modules is empty and the admissible highest weight modules are precisely the @xmath106 with @xmath107 .",
    "it is convenient to collect the admissible highest weights @xmath108 into a table , analogous to the kac table which gives the allowed conformal dimensions for the highest weight states of a virasoro minimal model .",
    "we present some of these tables , both for admissible highest weights @xmath108 and their conformal dimensions @xmath109 in figure  [ fig : tables ] .",
    "we note that , if one ignores the left - most column ( @xmath110 ) which describes the @xmath111-type admissibles , then these tables have symmetries similar to kac tables .",
    "in particular , we have @xmath112 this similarity between the table of @xmath105-type admissibles and the kac table for the minimal model @xmath113 is more than just analogy .",
    "in particular , note that if we take @xmath114 to define a virasoro central charge and virasoro conformal dimensions by @xmath115 then one finds that @xmath116 this relation is the key upon which a large proportion of the following analysis rests .    at ( 0,0 ) [ ]     1 & - +    ; at ( 2,0 ) [ ]     & - +    ; at ( 1,-1.2 ) [ ] @xmath2 ; at ( 0,1 ) [ ] @xmath108 ; at ( 2,1 ) [ ] @xmath117 ; at ( 0,-3.7 ) [ ]     1 & - + 2 & - + 3 & +    ; at ( 2,-3.7 ) [ ]     & - + & - + & +    ; at ( 1,-5.5 ) [ ] @xmath14 ; at ( 0,-2 ) [ ] @xmath108 ; at ( 2,-2 ) [ ] @xmath117 ; at ( 5.5,0 ) [ ]        ; at ( 8.2,0 ) [ ]        ; at ( 6.75,-1.2 ) [ ] @xmath3 ; at ( 5.5,1 ) [ ] @xmath108 ; at ( 8,1 ) [ ] @xmath117 ; at ( 5.5,-3.7 ) [ ]     1 & - & - + 2 & & - +    ; at ( 8.2,-3.7 ) [ ]     & - & - + & & - +    ; at ( 6.75,-5.5 ) [ ] @xmath11 ; at ( 5.5,-2 ) [ ] @xmath108 ; at ( 8,-2 ) [ ] @xmath117 ; at ( 2.3,-7.3 ) [ ]     1 & & - & - +    ; at ( 5.7,-7.3 ) [ ]     1 & & - & - +    ; at ( 4,-8.5 ) [ ] @xmath8 ; at ( 2.3,-6.3 ) [ ] @xmath108 ; at ( 5.7,-6.3 ) [ ] @xmath117 ;    physically , this spectrum of admissible highest weight modules is not acceptable when @xmath118 .",
    "the reason is that , unlike the @xmath111-type modules which are self - conjugate , the conjugates of the @xmath105-type modules are not highest weight modules .",
    "if we do not admit these conjugates in the spectrum , then the fields corresponding to the @xmath105-type modules will necessarily vanish in all correlation functions .",
    "we therefore conclude that , for @xmath118 , the spectrum must be extended by the conjugate modules @xmath119 just as the zero - grade subspace of @xmath120 may be identified with the ( infinite - dimensional ) highest weight @xmath16-module of highest weight @xmath108 , that of the conjugate module @xmath121 may be identified with the ( infinite - dimensional ) lowest weight @xmath16-module of lowest weight @xmath122 .",
    "note that the @xmath121 are not lowest weight @xmath0-modules .",
    "they may , however , be regarded as _ relaxed _ highest weight modules .",

    "the @xmath0-module @xmath128 may be constructed by appropriately inducing this @xmath16-module and taking the irreducible quotient .",
    "the spectrum of irreducible admissibles therefore includes @xmath136 modules @xmath137 , @xmath138 modules @xmath120 and the same number of conjugate modules @xmath121 , and @xmath139 continuous families of modules @xmath128 ( because @xmath140 and there are no other coincidences of conformal dimensions ) . aside from the conjugation @xmath141 , these admissibles are further related by spectral flow as follows : @xmath142 of course , this has to be slightly adjusted in the non - negative integer level case : @xmath143 excluding this case , it makes sense to ask about modules obtained from higher spectral flows .",
    "it turns out that for every @xmath118 , the spectral flow images @xmath144 , @xmath145 , of any admissible module @xmath55 are mutually non - isomorphic .",
    "however , only three at most of these infinitely many images may be identified as relaxed highest weight modules .",
    "the rest are irreducibles whose conformal dimensions _ are not bounded below_. nevertheless , these images are still admissible modules .",
