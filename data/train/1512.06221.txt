    "the spin - dependent electron density of the impurity is represented by @xmath27 , and @xmath15 denotes the local coulomb repulsion .",
    "( iii ) the interaction between the impurity and the conduction band is given by @xmath28 and the local electron charge couples to each displacement of the bosonic modes @xmath29 via the coupling constants @xmath30 and its form ensures particle - hole symmetry .",
    "the full hamiltonian @xmath31 determines the thermodynamics and the dynamics of the system .      in the absence of a bosonic bath",
    "the dynamics of the magnetic impurity is fully determined by the coupling function @xcite @xmath32 which we will take as spin - independent in the following . ignoring the spectral details of its high - energy part , which only influence the values of the relevant energy scales , but do not determine the low - energy fixed point spectrum , @xmath33 is replaced by the particle - hole symmetric power - law @xcite of the form @xmath34 with the exponent @xmath5 and the cutoff @xmath35 , which defines the effective bandwidth .",

    "most strikingly , however , @xmath243 deviates strongly from its thermodynamic equilibrium value , calculated with the final hamiltonian , for quenches into the l phase ( @xmath244 ) .",
    "this is related to a decoupling of an effective charge dof from the bath continuum , preventing the local system to relax to the thermodynamic equilibrium .",
    "the magnitude of the deviation between the steady - state value and the equilibrium value depends on the initial condition . for an initially decoupled bosonic bath ( @xmath219 ) the development of the localized charge dof takes longer than the charge flow , and consequently",

    "although the presence of the bosonic coupling yields a slowdown of the relaxation process . nevertheless , @xmath108 thermalizes to its equilibrium value for long times in all cases @xmath245 , which we have shown by an extrapolation of @xmath246 for @xmath2 .",
