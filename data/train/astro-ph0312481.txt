    "the metallicity distribution of the stars in the galactic halo ranges from [ fe / h]@xmath3 for the most metal - rich stars , to [ fe / h]@xmath4 at the minimum ( he 0107@xmath55240 : @xcite ) .",
    "the first halo stars formed from almost unprocessed primordial gas . a short formation time is favoured , because chemical enrichment due to supernovae is rapid .",
    "the milky way disk formed out of gas pre - enriched to about [ fe / h]@xmath6 .",
    "the pre - enrichment may have been due to the bulge formation @xcite but the most metal - rich stars in the halo show that this level of enrichment was already reached by the end of the halo formation .",
    "the global metallicity of the universe reached [ fe / h]@xmath7 at @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "some halo main - sequence stars show evidence for abundance alterations . because main - sequence stars should not have significantly altered their surface abundances , and pollution from planetary companions is unlikely given the dearth of planets at subsolar metallicity @xcite , pollution from a companion star by mass transfer is considered most likely . in some cases",
    "high overabundances of s - proces elements ( e.g. pb ) are found @xcite .",
    "these elements are formed in asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) stars @xcite , which first appeared @xmath9yr after the halo formation .",
    "other metal - poor stars show evidence for large enhancements of r - process elements , a.o .",
    "europium @xcite and gold @xcite .",
    "these form in type - ii supernovae , and are also explained via pollution from a companion star .",
    "the discovery that several stars show enhancements of _ both _ r - process and s - process elements @xcite is puzzling , as they require pollution from both an agb star and a supernova .    in this paper",
    "we will present a calculation which indicates that at low metallicity , inefficient mass loss may allow the degenerate cores of agb stars to reach the chandresekhar mass .",
    "this would lead to a agb supernovae , polluting low - mass companions by both s - process elements ( enriched in the agb envelope ) and r - process elements formed in the subsequent explosion .",
    "the next section discusses the double - polluted stars .",
    "section 3 discusses agb mass loss at low @xmath1 , and section 4 derives initial - final masses for these stars and discusses the possibility of agb supernovae .",
    "three stars are known to show the double enhancements : he2148@xmath51247 @xcite , cs22948@xmath5027 @xcite and cs29497@xmath5034 @xcite , with [ fe / h]=@xmath10,@xmath11 , and @xmath12 respectively .",
    "cs22898@xmath5027 @xcite , at [ fe / h]@xmath13 , may also show double enrichment .",
    "the metallicities are at the lower range of the gaussian halo distribution @xcite .",
    "the process leading to the double enhancement appears to require [ fe / h]@xmath14 .",
    "a lower limit to the metallicities of the double enriched stars is not evident .",
    "although there is a tail in the halo distribution extending to [ fe / h]@xmath15 @xcite or lower @xcite , there are few stars in this tail .",
    "@xcite discuss possible scenarios for double enhancements .",
    "a triple system including one massive pre - supernova and one pre - agb star , plus the remaining low - mass star , appears very unlikely .",
    "they therefore suggest reverse mass - transfer from the low - mass star to the post - agb white dwarf , leading to accretion - induced collapse , and a type - ia supernova . a third star in a close orbit around the agb primary may instead be considered for the mass donor , leading to a more traditional type - ia scenario , but this again leads to an unlikely close triple system .",
    "there is also no evidence that type - ia sne manufacture significant amounts of r - process elements , arguing against both these scenarios .",
    "pollution from an agb companion ( s - process elements ) occurs via wind accretion .",
    "the peak transfer efficiency ocurs for binaries with periods around 3000 days @xcite .",
    "@xcite stress the additional importance of a common envelope phase in mass transfer , but orbital eccentricities show that all but the closest binaries ( @xmath16 ) avoid a common envelope @xcite .",
    "roche lobe overflow is also unlikely @xcite , firstly because it tends to happen on the first giant branch ( before the onset of the s - process enhancements ) and secondly because it is unstable for donor stars more massive than the secondary , as would have been the case here . for the more likely wider orbits ,",
    "the wind interaction has little or no effect on the primary agb star , which continues to evolve as in the case of a single star .",
    "the wide orbit argues against the accretion - induced collapse , because of the need to transfer a large amount of mass from a distant low - mass main - sequence star in order to reach the chandresekhar mass .",
    "a scenario which does not require either a triple system or reverse mass transfer , and explains the metallicity dependence of the double - enrichment process , could be of interest .",
    "stars on the agb burn helium and hydrogen in shells around their inert c / o core .",
    "mass loss increases during the agb : once the mass - loss rate in the wind significantly exceeds the nuclear burning rate ( @xmath17 ) , the evolution comes to a sudden end @xcite . the remaining envelope is quickly removed and nuclear burning will cease .",
    "the c / o core at this point forms the subsequent white dwarf .",
    "the dependency of the mass loss on the stellar parameters is not well known .",
    "several formalisms have been proposed in the literature , depending typically on the radius , mass and luminosity of the star .",
    "the one used most extensively is the @xcite relation    @xmath18    with quantities in solar units .",
    "such relations are generally derived for galactic stars .",
    "an explicit metallicity dependence is not included .",
    "the mass loss of agb stars is a two - step process .",
    "first , pulsations extend the atmosphere and drive a small mass loss .",
    "secondly , dust forms in the extended atmosphere : radiation pressure on the dust now drives the large mass - loss rates observed . at low metallicity ,",
    "the efficiency of the dust formation is reduced and this will limit the mass - loss rates .",
    "@xcite derive mass - loss rates at low @xmath1 from theoretical pulsation models .",
    "they find that at low metallicity ( [ fe / h]@xmath19 ) the dust does not play a significant role and the wind becomes purely pulsation driven .",
    "stars with lower metallicity are found to have lower mass - loss rates .",
    "this will allow the core to grow to a larger mass and reach higher final masses .",
    "the agb wind depends on the stellar radius .",
    "as low - metallicity stars have smaller radii ( @xcite gives for agb stars the relation @xmath20 ) , this implies a further metallicity dependence of the mass loss , even for dust - free , pulsation driven winds .",
    "there are few direct observations of mass loss at low metallicity .",
    "the best data set comes from iso observations of agb stars in the magellanic clouds @xcite , from which both mass - loss rates and luminosities were derived @xcite . comparison with galactic stars is not straightforward , because within the galaxy distances tend to be poorly known and the luminosities are uncertain .",
    "the iso data shows that both lmc and smc stars reach similar mass - loss rates to those shown by galactic stars near the tip of the agb @xcite , although the unknown dust - to - gas ratios and expansion velocities could hide some difference .",
    "the luminosity of the lmc and smc stars tends to be high , reaching up to @xmath21 .",
    "mass loss at even lower metallicities ( [ fe / h]@xmath22 ) is very poorly studied .",
    "however , the superwind phase will lead to the formation of a planetary nebula ( pn ) and these can be observed to very large distances .",
    "there is a good relation between the number of pne and the luminosity of the host galaxy : for the most populated systems ( bulge , lmc ) , @xmath23 \\approx \\log l_v / l_\\odot - 6.9 $ ] @xcite . however , local galaxies with low @xmath1 show some evidence for a deficiency in the number of pn @xcite .",
    "this becomes apparent only for [ fe / h]@xmath19 ( fig .",
    "[ pne ] ) , well below the lmc or smc metallicity . plotting the deficiency as function of ratio of c - type over m - type agb stars ( fig .",
    "[ pne ] , right panel ) shows a clear relation : this ratio is an effective tracer of the metallicity of the agb population @xcite .",
    "the deficiency of pne suggests that the mass - loss rates do not reach as high values for metallicities [ fe / h]@xmath24 .",
    "lower peak mass - loss rates will give rise to less dense pne which will fade faster .",
    "conversely , the lack of a relation at [ fe / h]@xmath25 suggests that all these agb stars reach similar mass - loss rates ( although not necessarily at the same luminosities ) regardless of metallicity .",
    "this change of behaviour at [ fe / h]@xmath3 is in excellent agreement with the predictions of @xcite .",
    "we can estimate the effect of metallicity on the initial  final - mass .",
    "the goal is to obtain qualitative estimates : approximate , simple relations will suffice . in a more detailed calculation , more complicated relations could be substituted but these introduce their own uncertainties .",
    "the largest uncertainties comes from the mass - loss estimates , and not including hot bottom burning .",
    "the relation between the luminosity corresponding to a certain mass - loss rate , and the metallicity , is taken from @xcite .",
    "between @xmath26 and @xmath27 , this luminosity increases by a factor of 1.3 , in part because the wind is no longer dust driven . at lower z , the luminosity required to support the same mass - loss rate scales as @xcite :    @xmath28    the effect on the final mass of the star is derived from the core mass  luminosity relation , which we take from @xcite :    @xmath29    the increase of the final mass is very small for low core mass , but becomes significant for core masses corresponding to the heaviest white dwarfs .",
    "we use an approximate present initial  final mass relation corresponding to solar metallicity :    @xmath30    the true relation is shallow at low core mass and steepens at high core mass @xcite , so this is a significant simplification which may be more realistic at high than at low @xmath31 .    the result is shown in fig . [ mass_relation ] . at solar metallicity ,",
    "the most massive agb stars reach final masses around 1m@xmath32 . already at @xmath33 ,",
    "the most massive remnants approach the chandresekhar limit .",
    "[ this should be taken with caution as the most massive agb stars may show higher luminosity than predicted from their core masses , due to the effects of hot bottom burning @xcite .",
    "] at @xmath34 , the chandresekhar mass is reached for 5m@xmath32 stars and at @xmath35 , for 4m@xmath32 .",
    "carbon ignition in the degenerate core will cause these stars to explode .",
    "@xcite named such objects type 1.5 supernovae ; physically they could be considered an extension of type ii sne .",
    "the early work did not include the superwind which was later found to terminate the agb before these events could occur .",
    "however , an absence of a superwind at the lowest metallicities means that agb supernovae could still play a role in the early evolution of the universe .",
    "we have presented calculations which indicate the possibility that massive agb stars in the early halo would have given highly massive remnants , leading to a population of agb supernovae . in the context of the mixed r / s - enhanced halo stars",
    ", this suggests that the same companion star was responsible for the double pollution . for an initial mass in excess of 34m@xmath32",
    ", the companion would first have developed into an agb star .",
    "the wind of this star would have carried the s - process elements .",
    "after the core reached the chandresekhar limit , a supernova explosion occured .",
    "r - process elements formed during the explosion also polluted the companion star .",
    "the explosion may disrupt the binary system and so this model does not automatically predict that all such stars are binaries .",
    "however , if a binary , the companion should be a supernova remnant with appropriate mass .",
    "compared to the previously poposed models for the double enriched stars , the present model has the advantage of not requiring a close triple but only a binary , and it includes an explanation for the low metallicities of the doubly enriched stars .",
    "r - process elements appear to be produced in low - mass ( 10m@xmath32 ) type - ii supernovae @xcite : the similar masses suggest their production could also be expected in agb supernovae .",
    "@xcite find that cs 22898@xmath527 has a more or less normal lithium abundance for its metallicity , and wonder whether this is easily explained assuming pollution from an agb star .",
    "agb stars experience lithiu - rich phases during hot bottom burning .",
    "however , the lithium is easily destroyed again and at different phases , the surface abundances can vary from very high to strongly depleted @xcite : the lithium - rich phase is short - lived .",
    "the total lithium yield of low metallicity , hot bottom burning stars can be very close to the original spite plateau abundance @xcite .",
    "thus , the normal lithium abundance can be a coincidence .    for hotter s - process enriched stars , the lithium 6708  line coincides with a ceii line and derived abundances may be upper liimits in such cases @xcite .",
    "the effect on the supernova rate could be significant . assuming a salpeter imf with @xmath36 , the ratio of stars exploding as sn on the agb , compared to the normal type - ii s is shown in fig .",
    "[ mass_relation ] . at the extreme @xmath1 , the contribution of these agb - sn exceeds the normal type - ii sn by a factor of a few .",
    "the agb stars will however explode much later and would therefore play less of a role in the fast enrichment of the gas .",
    "old low-@xmath1 population should show the effect of the higher final masses , and contain a population of heavy white dwarfs and an overpopulation of neutron stars .",
    "this would affect globular clusters : dynamical evidence for the presence of a high-@xmath2 population of heavy remnants in the core of m15 ( [ fe / h@xmath13 ) is presented by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "a high @xmath2 was also found in the core of ngc 6752 ( [ fe / h@xmath37 ) , which could be caused by an excess population of heavy white dwarfs or neutron stars @xcite .",
    "from our present knowledge of agb mass loss , the early universe may have contained a population of supernovae which is not found in the local , high metallicity universe .",
    "these agb - sn are possible sites for the r - process , and provide a simple explanation for the small sample of low - metallicity , galactic halo stars which show evidence for both s - process and r - process enrichment .",
    "the absence of dust driven winds at [ fe / h]@xmath38 is supported both by models @xcite and observations ( this paper ) .",
    "the prediction that stellar remnants are more massive at lower metallicities appears robust , regardless of whether these remnants reach the chandresekhar limit .",
    "the presence of high - mass white dwarfs in globular clusters is likely , and could explain the evidence for an excess @xmath2 in the cores of both m 15 and ngc 6752 ."
