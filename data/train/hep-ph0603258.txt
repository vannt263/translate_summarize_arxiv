    "therefore , the discovery and subsequent study of the higgs boson properties is of the highest priority for particles physics community .",
    "a precise theoretical understanding of higgs production rate is critical to any attempts to search for the particle .",
    "the dominant production mechanism for higgs bosons in hadron - hadron colliders is via gluon - gluon fusion @xcite @xmath5 in which gluons fuse through a virtual top quark triangle to produce the higgs .",
    "such a process provides the largest production rate for the entire higgs mass range of interest .    the standard description of hard processes in hadron collisions within the framework of qcd parton model , which reduces the hadron - hadron interactions to the parton - parton ones via the formalism of the hadron structure functions .",
    "the most popular approach is the qcd collinear approximation @xcite , based on the well known collinear factorization theorem @xcite . in this approach",
    "all particles involved are assumed to be on the mass shell , carrying only longitudinal momenta , and the cross section is averaged over two transverse polarizations of the incident gluons .",
    "the transverse momenta of the incident partons are neglected in the qcd matrix elements .",
    "however , at small @xmath6 , the effects of finite transverse momenta of partons become increasingly important , especially in the analysis of jets and heavy - quark production , and there is no reason to neglect the transverse momenta of the gluons in comparison to the quark mass .",
    "the method to incorporate the incident parton transverse momenta is referred to as @xmath0-factorization approach @xcite . here",
    "the feynman diagrams are calculated taking into account the virtualities and all possible polarizations of the incident partons .",
    "there are widely discussed applications of the @xmath0-factorization approach to hard qcd processes like the @xmath7 hadroproduction @xcite , charmonium production @xcite , heavy quark photo- @xcite and hadroproduction @xcite , higgs boson production @xcite .",

    "the main technical problem here is to calculate the vector and second - rank tensor feynman integrals with @xmath16 but the symmetric properties of full amplitude together with a usage of convenient projectors allow to avoid such difficulties and represent all relevant form factors in terms of scalar three- and two - point functions plus extra finite subtractions appearing due to the regularization .    in the present work we shall study in detail the fusion of off - shell gluons in proton - proton collisions producing a scalar higgs boson by the top quark triangular loops with finite ( not infinite ) top quark mass .",
