    "a major goal of the large hadron collider ( lhc ) is to unveil the origin of electroweak symmetry breaking ( ewsb ) . in the standard model ( sm )",
    "the higgs mechanism provides a particularly attractive way to break electroweak symmetry and generate mass .",
    "it is most simply implemented by introducing the higgs boson , a scalar field that spontaneously breaks the electroweak symmetry by obtaining a vacuum expectation value ( vev ) .",
    "if the higgs boson is an elementary scalar field then its mass can be stabilized by low - energy supersymmetry . in this case",
    "supersymmetry breaking triggers the breaking of electroweak symmetry .",
    "alternatively the higgs boson may be composite and therefore can be stabilized with strong dynamics at the tev scale  @xcite .",
    "a composite higgs boson model was recently constructed using the holographic dual of a warped dimension  @xcite .",
    "but the presence of a higgs boson is not obligatory .",
    "as is well - known by analogy with qcd , electroweak symmetry can also be broken by condensates in technicolor .",
    "in fact , via the ads / cft correspondence , a technicolor - like higgsless model can be constructed in a warped extra dimension providing a more recent incarnation of this idea  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless the underlying feature of all these models is that electroweak symmetry is broken at the electroweak scale where , in particular , the standard model gauge fields and fermions receive a mass by coupling to an external higgs sector . to generate ( not just stabilize ) the tev mass scale or gauge hierarchy in a natural way via dimensional transmutation",
    ", it seems inevitable to have strong dynamics in this external sector ( whether it be associated with electroweak or supersymmetry breaking ) , together with the standard model gauge fields and fermions which do not directly partake in the underlying dynamics .",
    "yet there is another possibility for mass generation . just like the hadron mass spectrum in qcd",
    ", there is no need to invoke the higgs mechanism to generate a mass . instead the fermions and @xmath0-bosons could be composite states which directly obtain a mass from the underlying confining strong dynamics .",
    "this idea is not new  @xcite , since qcd contains states which mimic the electroweak gauge bosons .",
    "specifically it was noticed that low - energy qcd can be interpreted as a spontaneously broken gauge theory , where the su(2 ) isospin triplet @xmath13 meson is the massive gauge field of a hidden local symmetry  @xcite .",
    "interestingly this interpretation can effectively explain @xmath13-coupling universality , @xmath13-meson dominance , and the high - energy @xmath14-@xmath14 scattering cross section .",
    "this bears some resemblance with electroweak symmetry suggesting that the @xmath0-bosons might be composite .",
    "furthermore , unlike global symmetries , gauge symmetries do not lead to new conserved charges and merely remove the redundancy in our description of massless spin-1 particles with spacetime vector fields .",
    "this has led to the suggestion that gauge symmetries are not fundamental  @xcite .",
    "in fact this is supported by duality in four - dimensional ( 4d ) supersymmetric theories which imply that gauge symmetries in the sm or even general relativity could be long - distance artifacts  @xcite .",
    "so the idea that electroweak gauge bosons are composite represents an intriguing although relatively unexplored possibility .    in this paper",
    "we examine this possibility by constructing an ewsb model with composite @xmath0 bosons .",
    "since the underlying theory is inherently strongly - coupled we use the ads / cft correspondence @xcite to construct a calculable five - dimensional ( 5d ) model using a warped fifth dimension  @xcite .",
    "the electroweak symmetry will be assumed to be preserved on the ir brane and the bulk , while it will be broken on the uv brane .",
    "hence in this model the ir brane is only used to break conformal symmetry and generate massive states .",
    "this is opposite from the original randall - sundrum model and all other warped models where ewsb is assumed to occur on the ir brane .",
    "this implies that in our model electroweak gauge symmetry is not a fundamental symmetry and merely emerges at the ir scale when the conformal symmetry is broken .",
    "moreover even though our model is effectively higgsless at low energies because ewsb occurs on the uv brane and the higgs sector decouples , it still differs from the usual technicolor - like higgsless model  @xcite where ewsb occurs at the ir scale and the @xmath0-boson are elementary fields .",
    "brane kinetic terms are a crucial feature of our model . in order to identify the lightest kaluza - klein ( kk ) states with composite @xmath5 bosons",
    "they are introduced to separate the lowest - lying kk mode from the rest of the kk tower .",
    "this guarantees that the heavier kk resonances of the @xmath0 bosons are sufficiently heavy to evade direct experimental bounds .",
    "this leads to @xmath15 and @xmath16 boson profiles that are effectively localized near the ir brane , rendering them composite states of the dual 4d theory . while the main focus of this work will be on the gauge boson sector",
    "we will make simplifying assumptions regarding the fermion sector .",
    "since electroweak symmetry is broken on the uv brane , fermions must at least couple to the uv brane and have universal profiles in the bulk to ensure gauge coupling universality .",
    "this will be left for future work and for simplicity we will assume the fermions are localized on the ir brane .",
    "the idea of composite weak gauge bosons has been previously explored in the literature  @xcite where attempts were made to construct the underlying preon models based on asymptotically - free qcd . unlike these earlier attempts the ads / cft dictionary relates our composite gauge boson model to a dual 4d conformal field theory at large ",
    "t hooft coupling .",
    "in addition the weakly - coupled 5d gravity dual improves calculability allowing a more quantitative analysis of the composite model .",
    "consequently , a precision electroweak analysis can be performed leading to reasonable agreement with the @xmath17 parameters . in particular",
    ", the @xmath2 parameter is sufficiently suppressed due to a custodial su(2 ) symmetry that naturally occurs in the model .",
    "since the gauge bosons are composite there are also various interesting phenomenological aspects to study .",
    "in fact due to the strong coupling the underlying composite nature of the gauge bosons is much less partonic at moderate bjorken @xmath18 compared to qcd hadrons . in particular the composite nature of the @xmath0 boson provides a novel unitarization mechanism for @xmath4 scattering based on form factor suppression , and suggests that deviations in the scattering amplitude may be measurable , giving rise to a distinctive signal at the lhc .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows . in section 2",
    "we present an overview of the model , outlining our various assumptions before presenting the full details of the 5d model in a warped dimension .",
    "the electroweak precision analysis is presented in section 3 where it is shown how the model naturally admits a custodial su(2 ) symmetry .",
    "the @xmath1 and @xmath2 parameter are both shown to be consistent with electroweak precision tests .",
    "section 4 is devoted to a preliminary study on @xmath4 scattering and unitarity .",
    "various constraints and signatures of composite weak gauge bosons at lep , tevatron , and the lhc are discussed in section 5 .",
    "finally in appendix a we present an alternative derivation of how brane kinetic terms give rise to a light kk mode , while in appendix b we present a form factor computation using the overlap integral .",
    "we begin by defining our ewsb model using the randall - sundrum framework  @xcite .",
    "consider a slice of ads@xmath19 with 5d metric ds^2=(_dx^dx^+dz^2)g_mndx^mdx^n  , where @xmath20 is the ads curvature scale .",
    "the 5d spacetime indices are written as @xmath21 , with @xmath22 , and @xmath23 is the minkowski metric .",
    "the fifth dimension @xmath24 is compactified on a @xmath25 orbifold , with a uv ( ir ) brane located at the fixed point @xmath26 .",
    "the @xmath24 coordinate is related to the 4d energy scale , and the scale of the uv ( ir ) brane is chosen to be @xmath27 respectively , where @xmath28 gev is the reduced planck scale .",
    "the 5d bulk is assumed to have an electroweak symmetry , @xmath29 , while on the boundaries the electroweak symmetry is preserved on the ir brane but broken on the uv brane .",
    "this is to ensure that the @xmath0 bosons are identified with the lowest - lying kk modes peaking towards the ir brane , so that by the ads / cft correspondence they are interpreted as composite states . on the uv brane",
    "the symmetry is broken by imposing dirichlet boundary conditions that realizes the sm symmetry breaking pattern @xmath30 . as pointed out in @xcite ewsb via dirichlet boundary conditions",
    "can be more naturally understood as the limit of a higgs mechanism on the boundary with a very large vev .",
    "since the breaking is on the uv brane , the higgs sector decouples and the model is effectively higgsless at low energies .",
    "the unbroken electromagnetic group @xmath31 on the uv brane leads to a massless photon .",
    "in addition , even though the strong force is irrelevant for our discussion , there are massless gluons from the unbroken @xmath32 color symmetry .",
    "so in our setup , the massive @xmath0 gauge fields are mostly composite , while the massless gauge fields are mostly elementary .",
    "there is an immediate problem with identifying the lowest - lying kk states with the @xmath0 bosons . since in the warped dimension the kk modes",
    "are essentially evenly spaced , the next - heaviest kk states will have masses at approximately 200 gev .",
    "this obviously contradicts direct searches and electroweak precision data that require additional electroweak gauge bosons @xmath33 to be heavier than about @xmath34  @xcite . hence to obtain a desirable mass spectrum we will introduce brane - localized kinetic terms  @xcite .",
    "we will see that this leads to very light lowest - lying kk modes for the @xmath0 bosons , while the remaining heavier kk modes of the @xmath0-boson and photon will appear at the tev scale .",
    "brane kinetic terms will be added on both branes consistent with the brane symmetry .",
    "this includes mass - dimension @xmath35 brane kinetic term coefficients @xmath36 for @xmath31 on the uv brane , and @xmath37 for @xmath38 and @xmath39 on the ir brane , respectively .",
    "thus the 5d action of our model is given by s = d^4xdz , [ 5daction ] where the 5d field strengths @xmath40 with associated gauge fields @xmath41 , and 5d gauge couplings @xmath42 , are for @xmath43 , respectively . since only the uv boundary",
    "is higgsed , the fifth components of the gauge fields are unphysical  @xcite .",
    "this ensures that our model contains no @xmath44-like holographic higgs bosons .",
    "note that the brane kinetic terms in ( [ 5daction ] ) are crucial ingredients in our model .",
    "they are always allowed on the branes at tree level by the breaking of 5d poincare symmetry .",
    "but more importantly in any 5d theory with bulk gauge fields , as well as charged bulk matter subject to orbifold boundary conditions  @xcite or confined to the branes  @xcite , the divergent radiative corrections to the gauge propagator requires that brane kinetic terms be included as counterterms .",
    "therefore from the effective field theory perspective the coefficients of the brane kinetic terms are free parameters of the theory with their exact values depending on the uv completion .",
    "although naive dimensional analysis ( nda ) estimates the size of the coefficients to be of order the compactification scale of the fifth dimension  @xcite , large brane kinetic terms are perturbatively consistent  @xcite .",
    "thus , just like previous analyses in @xcite , we will assume the brane kinetic term coefficients to be free parameters that are fixed by experimental data , and do not constrain them to be of their nda size .",
    "the boundary conditions that realize the symmetry breaking pattern and include the brane kinetic terms are & & z = z_uv : \\",
    "{    l +   + [ bcuv ]    . + & & z = z_ir : \\ {    l + [ bcir ]    . where @xmath45 is the 4d laplacian .",
    "imposing these boundary conditions on the bulk solutions will lead to the mass spectrum and is similar to that performed in refs .",
    "gauge fields which are mixed by the boundary conditions share the same kk mass spectrum ( although with a different 5d profile for the same kk mode ) . in particular this is the kk tower containing both @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "when @xmath47 is dominant , it is identified as the kk photon tower , while when @xmath46 is dominant , it is identified as the kk @xmath16-boson tower . for the other tower ,",

    "[ kkdec3 ] we have separated out the photon @xmath50 in the decomposition of @xmath51 since later we will show that there is a massless flat zero mode in this kk tower . substituting these decompositions into the boundary conditions ( [ bcuv ] ) and ( [ bcir ] ) ,",

    "the @xmath16-boson profile is then given by @xmath91 and the @xmath69-boson profiles are plotted in figure  [ wzfig ] .",
    "thus we again see that with respect to a flat metric , just like the @xmath15-boson , the @xmath16-boson is localized near the ir brane .",
    "it is important to note that the bulk profiles ( [ wprofile ] ) , ( [ zprofile0 ] ) , and ( [ zprofile ] ) , plotted in figure  [ wzfig ] do not depict the complete localization information .",
    "recall that the profile density @xmath92 represents the probability of finding a particular mode in the ads slice ( including the branes ) .",
    "the canonical normalization of the profile ensures a unit probability of locating the mode somewhere in the ads slice",
    ". however the bulk profiles depicted in figure  [ wzfig ] do not give rise to a unit probability distribution , in fact they only contribute a small fraction to the whole normalization .",
    "this is because the contributions from the boundary kinetic terms are not shown .",
    "they actually give rise to a large contribution to the normalization which together with the bulk contribution leads to a unit probability distribution .",
    "since the boundary kinetic terms are given in terms of a singular @xmath93-function their contribution can not be depicted in figure  [ wzfig ] .",
    "this is related to the assumption that the branes are infinitely thin , which is just a mathematical approximation in the low energy eft .",
    "however we know that physically branes must have a finite thickness , related to the 5d cutoff scale @xmath94 , where the brane - generating dynamics becomes important .",
    "the origin of the 3-branes can be field theory domain walls  @xcite , or effectively arising from warped throats in string theory  @xcite .",
    "consequently , assuming a finite brane thickness , the @xmath93-function localized boundary kinetic term should actually be represented by a smoothed - out profile within the brane thickness . for the @xmath0 profiles this gives rise to a much sharper but finite peak around the ir brane than is naively depicted in figure  [ wzfig ] . even though the profile within the brane thickness can not be determined in our eft approach , we know that the integral over the profile density within the ir brane should match @xmath95 , where @xmath96 is the bulk solution evaluated at the ir brane . as we will see later",
    ", the brane thickness has a nontrivial influence for matching to the standard model .",
    "although we have focused on the ultra - light first kk modes , which are identified with the @xmath69 bosons , it is necessary to check whether the higher kk modes are compatible with experimental constraints .",
    "numerically we find that the second kk @xmath69-boson is typically around 4 tev .",
    "however if @xmath80 is large , the first kk photon ( recall that the photon kk tower has a massless zero mode ) can be much lighter than the tev scale , since as we have seen , a large brane kinetic term is responsible for an ultra - light kk mode . such a light kk photon conflicts with the known bounds on the @xmath97 boson mass  @xcite , although it can be partly compensated by the reduced coupling arising from the brane kinetic terms which suppress the kk wavefunctions on the boundary  @xcite . nevertheless to be safely within experimental bounds we choose small @xmath98 so that the first photon kk state has a mass around 2 tev .",
    "its coupling to fermions is similar to that of the zero - mode photon although it depends on the details of the fermion localization . in the next section",
    ", we will see that a small @xmath80 is also necessary to ensure a custodial protection for the @xmath2 parameter of the model .",
    "therefore we see that to obtain the correct @xmath0-boson masses while maintaining compatibility with other constraints the brane kinetic term coefficients can not all be of the same order , and there must be a small hierarchy between @xmath80 and @xmath99 , of approximately @xmath100 .",
    "however as argued earlier , brane kinetic term coefficients are free parameters determined by unknown strong dynamics , and all the chosen values are ` reasonable ' from an effective field theory point of view , so there should be no problem with the small hierarchy between @xmath80 and @xmath99 .",
    "as mentioned earlier , we are focusing on composite weak gauge bosons in this paper .",
    "nevertheless it behooves us to comment on the fermions since they are an integral part of a complete mass generation framework for the sm .",
    "if fermions are to obtain their masses from ewsb on the uv brane then they should have a nonzero coupling there .",
    "the simplest solution would be to confine them on the uv brane .",
    "however this is not a realistic solution because it would lead to vanishing gauge couplings since the @xmath0-bosons have dirichlet boundary conditions there .",
    "instead the fermions must be bulk fields with the same profile for all flavors .",
    "this is because the non - flat electroweak gauge boson profiles ( see fig .  [ wzfig ] ) require the fermion profiles to be universal in order to ensure a universal gauge coupling . unlike models with flat gauge - boson profiles where gauge coupling universality is automatic once fermion profiles are canonically normalized",
    ", a non - flat gauge boson profile causes the gauge - boson - fermion - fermion overlap integral ( corresponding to the 4d gauge coupling ) to be very different for different fermion profiles . moreover requiring a universal fermion profile",
    "no longer allows the fermion mass hierarchy to be explained by the  geography \" in the warped dimension  @xcite .",
    "there is an alternative possibility which is to introduce fermion mass terms on the uv brane . with planck - scale boundary masses and ir localization a common but @xmath101(tev ) mass scale",
    "can be obtained for the zero mode fermions . to distinguish between the flavors , a new flavor symmetry that is broken on the uv brane",
    "can be introduced .",
    "the fermion mass hierarchy can then be explained by a froggatt - nielsen mechanism on the uv brane with different charge assignments when the flavor symmetry is broken . assuming a universal bulk fermion profile ( ensured with a universal bulk mass term ) , approximate universal gauge couplings",
    "are then preserved as long as the fermions are light compared to the ir scale , @xmath102 .",
    "interestingly , the slight deviations from universality of the heaviest fermions could have a palliative effect on small strains among the @xmath103 observables .",
    "we postpone a detailed study of the fermion sector since it is outside the scope of the present work .",
    "but for concreteness we assume that the fermions are confined to the ir brane in order to perform an electroweak precision analysis of the gauge - boson sector .",
    "this approximates a bulk fermion profile that is peaked near the ir brane .      in order to facilitate a deeper understanding of the 5d model we discuss in more detail how electroweak",
    "symmetry is broken and present the 4d dual interpretation via the ads / cft correspondence .",
    "this will also help to understand some aspects of precision electroweak tests in the next section .",
    "the underlying physics of our 5d model is different from other existing models of ewsb in warped space . in the 5d model ewsb",
    "occurs on the uv brane via dirichlet boundary conditions .",
    "this leads to @xmath69-bosons appearing as ultra - light first kk mode states that arise from introducing brane kinetic terms , while higher kk modes are of order the tev scale , consistent with experimental constraints and can possibly be seen at the lhc .",
    "it is interesting to compare our model with the technicolor - like 5d higgsless model  @xcite . in the higgsless model ewsb",
    "occurs on the ir brane via dirichlet boundary conditions , and the @xmath69-bosons are identified with the first kk modes that are light due to a suppression from the logarithmn of the warp factor . at first glance",
    "it appears that our model is just the higgsless model where the uv and ir boundary conditions have been interchanged , together with the addition of brane kinetic terms .",
    "however the underlying physics is quite different , which is made clearer by describing the model in the 4d dual picture .",
    "as noted in @xcite , a dirichlet boundary condition for a gauge field is equivalent to a modified neumann boundary condition where the gauge field is coupled to a brane higgs field in the large vev limit ( which decouples the higgs boson rendering the low - energy theory  higgsless \" ) .",
    "therefore an intuitive way to see how the @xmath69-bosons obtain a mass is to vary the vev of the brane higgs field .    when the 4d electroweak symmetry is restored by a zero vev in the technicolor - like 5d higgsless model , the bulk gauge fields have exact massless zero modes that are identified with the @xmath69-bosons .",
    "the higher @xmath69 kk modes are massive and degenerate , obtaining their mass from the breakdown of conformal symmetry ( due to the presence of the ir brane ) .",
    "when the vev is switched on and the electroweak symmetry is broken , the mass spectrum gets deformed .",
    "the original massless zero modes obtain an electroweak scale boundary mass that arises entirely from the gauge coupling to the ir higgs .",
    "in contrast , the higher kk masses are only slightly shifted ( not ` generated ' ) due to the coupling to the ir higgs , with the major portion of their mass still due to the breaking of conformal symmetry . in the higgsless limit , only the higgs field itself decouples , while the original gauge field zero modes remain in the spectrum as the lowest - lying kk state ( which are identified as the massive @xmath69-bosons via the usual higgs mechanism ) .",
    "thus , the point we would like to stress is that in the higgsless model , and other existing ewsb models in warped space , the contribution to the @xmath69-boson mass is entirely from the boundary higgs mechanism . alternatively , in the 4d dual description , the @xmath69-bosons are elementary gauge fields - bosons are the lowest - lying kk modes , their wavefunction is localized towards the uv brane , in contrast to the higher kk modes which are peaked on the ir brane . in this sense",
    "it is dual to a mostly elementary 4d field . ] , that are ` external ' to the strongly coupled cft .",
    "the breaking of conformal symmetry at the tev scale triggers ewsb and generates the @xmath69-boson masses through the electroweak gauge interaction between the @xmath69-bosons and some higgs - like field ( or in technicolor language , the techni - pions ) .",
    "all of the mass is due to electroweak symmetry breaking via a higgs mechanism .",
    "by contrast in our model ewsb occurs by imposing dirichlet boundary conditions on the uv brane .",
    "again these boundary conditions can be interpreted as modified neumann conditions with a uv brane higgs and planck scale vev . to see the role played by a uv higgs we can compare the mass spectrum with that obtained when electroweak symmetry is restored . for simplicity",
    "consider just the @xmath15-boson and change the uv dirichlet boundary conditions in ( [ bcuv ] ) to be pure neumann , while still allowing nonzero brane kinetic terms .",
    "as expected the mass spectrum now contains a massless mode and a light first kk mode due to the brane kinetic term with mass @xmath104 , where @xmath105 is the @xmath15-boson mass given in ( [ wmass ] ) , while the higher kk modes masses just get shifted at the @xmath106 level .    to study how the mass spectrum in the electroweak symmetric limit changes we consider a uv brane higgs with a vev .",
    "the mass spectrum will change depending on how the kk modes couple to the uv brane .",

    "note that in ( [ lightzero ] ) the heavy mode @xmath121 obtains a mass proportional to @xmath111 via the usual higgs mechanism associated with the uv higgs .",
    "it is the counterpart of the @xmath69-boson in the 5d higgsless model ",
    "they both originate from the zero mode before ewsb , although strictly speaking it is not precise to correlate the new massive mode with just the original zero mode or the first kk mode since both original states are highly mixed due to the uv higgs .",
    "nevertheless the main difference is that the original zero modes in our model eventually decouple and become irrelevant to the low - energy sm since they receive a planck scale mass from the uv higgs , while the original zero modes in the 5d higgsless model  @xcite remain in the low - energy theory as the @xmath69-bosons since they obtain an electroweak scale mass from an ir higgs .",

    ". thus the novel feature of our model is that the @xmath69-bosons obtain their mass from two different 5d locations : a dominant contribution from conformal symmetry breaking at the ir brane and a sub - dominant contribution from ewsb on the uv brane .",
    "the actual mass difference between the @xmath15 and @xmath16-boson arises from the mixing on the uv brane introduced by finite values of @xmath124 and @xmath36 .",

    ", the bulk 5d gauge symmetry corresponds to a global symmetry in the 4d cft .",
    "the unbroken gauge symmetry on the uv brane weakly gauges that particular subgroup of the global symmetry .",

    "this suggests that electroweak symmetry is _ not a fundamental gauge symmetry_. the @xmath69-bosons are cft bound states created by the global current associated with the electroweak global symmetry .",

    "as experimentally observed , we can interpret them as gauge fields of some hidden local symmetry by promoting the previous global electroweak symmetry to be local , as was similarly done for the @xmath13 meson in qcd  this is just the usual standard model yang - mills theory , which has been proved to be a very successful effective low - energy description .",
    "if we want to further explore the strong dynamics which ` possibly ' underlies the sm or its 5d dual , we may ask : what kind of ` special dynamics ' gives rise to large brane kinetic terms or their 4d dual counterpart ?",
    "why does this introduce an additional light collective mode ?",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , in 5d models with orbifold compactification or bulk fields interacting with brane fields , brane kinetic terms necessarily emerge as counterterms for loop corrections of the gauge field propagator .",
    "also as demonstrated in  @xcite , there is no problem with having a larger brane kinetic term compared to nda as needed in our model .",
    "in fact the existence of large brane kinetic terms is consistent with our model where a large number of matter fields are localized on the ir brane assuming that brane kinetic terms originate from interactions with brane localized matter @xcite .",
    "similarly , on the uv brane a large brane kinetic term could result from integrating out a large number of string states .",
    "the 4d dual description of brane kinetic terms are bare kinetic terms emerging at the appropriate cutoff scales .",
    "according to the ads / cft correspondence , the 4d dual description of obtaining an ir brane kinetic term from a one - loop counter - term is related to sub - leading large-@xmath125 effects for the corresponding operator correlation function in the cft @xcite .",
    "of course , there could be other possibilities leading to large brane kinetic terms , including large volume effects at the brane locations , or possibilities related to the physics of stabilizing the radion  @xcite . in appendix",
    "a we use the 4d kk modes to demonstrate more clearly how an ultra - light mode generically arises with a large brane kinetic term compared to directly solving the 5d equations of motion . by introducing a brane kinetic term ,",
    "the 4d kk spectrum changes due to kinetic mixing and mass mixing induced by the boundary kinetic term .    at this point",
    "it is instructive to comment on the relation of our model to the original rs1 model with the standard model confined on the ir brane  @xcite .",
    "we have seen that for fixed @xmath126 , specific values of @xmath99 can give rise to realistic non - zero @xmath0-boson masses .",
    "it is interesting to study the limit of large brane kinetic terms ( with @xmath126 fixed ) .",
    "the @xmath0-bosons in our model then become increasingly confined to the ir brane .",
    "they are also becoming lighter , while the remaining kaluza - klein modes are becoming increasingly heavier .",
    "eventually as the brane kinetic terms become infinite the remaining kaluza - klein modes decouple and we are left with massless @xmath0 bosons confined on the ir brane .",
    "this can be seen in more detail by considering , for example , the @xmath15-boson .",
    "naively we would expect the limit @xmath127 to be singular .",
    "however , from eq.([5daction ] ) the normalization of the @xmath15-boson profile is given by n_w^2=1 .",
    "[ normw ] substituting the expressions for the @xmath15-boson mass ( [ wmass ] ) and profile ( [ wprofile ] ) , we find that when @xmath127 , the bulk integral part of ( [ normw ] ) vanishes , while the boundary kinetic term part is finite and can be normalized to one .",
    "this means that a massless @xmath15-boson is completely localized on the ir brane .",
    "this is similar to rs1 when the gauge bosons are massless , except that our photon is an elementary field with a large localization on the uv brane whereas in rs1 the photon is also confined to the ir brane .",
    "of course the major difference between our model and rs1 is the way in which the @xmath0-bosons obtain a mass . in rs1",
    "there is an associated higgs sector also confined on the ir brane to give mass to the electroweak gauge bosons .",
    "by contrast in our model the @xmath0-bosons obtain a mass from finite boundary kinetic terms that allows the @xmath0-bosons to obtain a bulk profile with a corresponding kk mass .",
    "therefore we see that brane kinetic terms generalize the usual setup , providing a way to interpolate between the localized bulk profile and the boundary fields .",
    "finally we briefly comment on the interesting possibility that our scenario admits an ` effective ' dual description in terms of a higgs mechanism implemented with a non - linear @xmath128model , where @xmath129 play a role similar to the vev ( see ( [ wmass ] ) and ( [ zmass ] ) ) .",
    "this is analogous to the dual description that can be made when interpreting the qcd @xmath13 meson as a massive gauge boson of spontaneously broken hidden local symmetry  @xcite . in more ` modern ' language , this suggests that our composite 4d model could be a non - supersymmetric example of seiberg duality  @xcite , where the underlying strong confining gauge theory has a low - energy dual description as a weakly - coupled gauge theory in the higgs phase , and the emergent composites are effective degrees of freedom .",
    "however to understand this better requires a detailed knowledge of the constituent gauge theory .",
    "just like any new physics beyond the sm , our model needs to be consistent with a precision electroweak analysis .",
    "as in @xcite we focus on oblique corrections , characterized by the @xmath1 and @xmath2 parameters , and briefly discuss the @xmath130 parameter .",
    "although both a light higgs boson theory like the sm and technicolor - like higgsless ewsb models are well - motivated theoretically , the higgsless models are disfavored compared to models with a light higgs boson . the major reason being that the @xmath1 parameter in the technicolor - like higgsless models is typically large and positive , which is ruled out by precision electroweak measurements",
    "instead , we find that our emergent model can give a reasonable fit to the @xmath1 parameter . furthermore , there is also a built - in custodial symmetry , so that the @xmath2 parameter is compatible with experimental constraints .",
    "the better agreement of our model with electroweak precision tests , especially the @xmath1 parameter , compared to the usual higgsless models originates from their essential differences in the underlying physics discussed in the previous section .    to calculate the @xmath1 and @xmath2 parameters we will use the same matching scheme as in @xcite . for simplicity",
    "the fermions are assumed to be localized on the ir brane where they obtain a nonzero coupling with the gauge bosons .",
    "the radiative corrections will be oblique by requiring that the couplings of the ir - localized fermions give exactly the leading order coupling relations .",
    "when there are no boundary kinetic terms the matching of 4d couplings with 5d couplings is simply given by @xmath131 where @xmath132 is the bulk gauge field profile .",
    "this is the case that has been considered in the literature .",
    "however with boundary kinetic terms there is a @xmath93-function contribution to the profile as mentioned in section 2.1.1 .",
    "its contribution can be incorporated into the matching by including the physical brane thickness @xmath133 , as mentioned earlier .",
    "the matching now becomes g_4=g_5^z_ir_z_ir- f_(z)f_(z)|f_a(z ) , where @xmath134 is the fermion profile , and @xmath135 is the modified ir profile of the gauge field satisfying ^z_ir_z_ir-(|f_a(z))^2=(f_a(z_ir))^2 , for a brane kinetic term coefficient @xmath136 .",
    "this effectively means that the bulk gauge field profile at the ir brane , @xmath137 , is scaled by a factor @xmath138 , where @xmath139 depends on the specific profile within the brane thickness and the brane kinetic term coefficient . in our eft approach",
    "it is an undetermined parameter that regulates the underlying dynamics associated with the @xmath93-function singularity of the ir brane . in order to respect the bulk and brane symmetries",

    ", we require that ( [ covderiv ] ) reproduce the sm fermion couplings in terms of the 4d gauge couplings @xmath143 .",

    "there is a usual higgs mechanism on the uv brane which gives a uv scale mass to the original zero mode gauge field causing it to decouple .",

    "one particular type of process within the standard model that calls for new physics at the tev scale is longitudinal @xmath15 ( or @xmath16)-boson scattering .",
    "the tree - level perturbative amplitude @xmath199 of an individual graph of such processes involves divergences up to @xmath200 , ( where @xmath201 is the center - of - mass energy ) : @xmath202 , where @xmath203 are constants . in a true gauge theory like the sm where the @xmath15-boson is an elementary gauge field",
    ", the @xmath200 divergence vanishes due to gauge cancelation between the contact graph and @xmath204 channel @xmath205 exchanges .",
    "but the next leading divergence , @xmath206 does not vanish within the sm alone , and tree - level unitarity breaks down at 1.2 tev , requiring new non - perturbative physics to restore unitarity .",
    "however , due to the difficulty with quantitatively describing physics involving strong dynamics , there has always been a strong preference to preserve tree - level unitarity or perturbative calculability up to high energy scales .",
    "this preference makes introducing an elementary higgs boson to the sm a desirable scenario .",
    "in particular , adding graphs involving the higgs boson cancels the @xmath206 divergence  @xcite , while the remaining constant piece can be perturbative with a higgs boson lighter than 700 gev  @xcite .",
    "similarly in alternative ewsb scenarios like 5d higgsless models , preserving tree - level unitarity has been strongly preferred , where summing over kk modes plays a similar role as a higgs boson and can not be too heavy .",
    "however , it should be emphasized that as a foundation of quantum field theory unitarity itself is never jeopardized by @xmath4 scattering concerns .",
    "preserving tree - level unitarity is a theoretical preference that avoids having to deal with strongly - coupled theories .",
    "it is by no means the choice that has to be taken by nature .",
    "in fact almost equally importantly , current experimental constraints on the behavior of @xmath4 scattering are rather moderate due to the energy scale and luminosity reach of colliders . as will be shown in the next section lep and tevatron data only constrains the trilinear gauge boson coupling to be sm - like up to energies not much beyond the @xmath4 production threshold .",
    "so this allows enough room for theoretical model building and the lhc to test for possible deviations from the standard model predictions at high energy .",
    "based on these considerations the breakdown of tree - level @xmath4 unitarity at lower energy scales is not sufficient to veto a theory , especially if it can also give quantitative insights into how unitarity is restored by the strong dynamics .",
    "this is the case for our emergent model where energy - dependent form factors of trilinear and quartic gauge boson self - interactions are naturally associated with composite @xmath0 bosons which can lead to a distinctive explanation of @xmath4 scattering and its unitarization . in particular",
    "the ads / cft correspondence can be used to study form factors and their influence on @xmath4 scattering .",
    "one way to compute the form factor is based on the overlap integral of onshell and offshell profiles of the states involved in the interaction .",
    "this technique has been successfully used in ads / qcd models  @xcite , although @xcite suggests that this approach may not give trustworthy results at high energy since expected results based on conformal scaling can not be reproduced .",
    "furthermore , unlike previous applications , large brane kinetic terms in our model can cause considerable deviation at low energy where the profile distribution within the ir brane thickness is important",
    ".    nonetheless let us consider the form factors obtained from the profile overlap integral with the details of the derivation given in appendix b. by performing this simpler computation a preliminary phenomenological analysis of possible deviations from the standard model can be studied . at high energy",
    "we find that the @xmath200 divergence in amplitudes of the @xmath204-channel @xmath207 exchange graphs are sufficiently suppressed , as can be seen in the @xmath208 form factors depicted in figs .",
    "[ spacelikewwz ] and [ timelikewwz ] ( see appendix b ) .",
    "this is because they involve a three - point vertex @xmath208 , @xmath209 with an offshell @xmath207 giving rise to a form factor which falls off as @xmath210 at high energy , where @xmath211 is the transferred momentum carried by the intermediate @xmath207 .",
    "concretely , we find that a good analytic approximation for the @xmath212 form factor at low energy is f(q^2 ) .",
    "[ simpleff ] this behavior agrees well with ` vector - meson pole dominance ' which follows as a general result of a confining gauge theory with a gravity dual ( although large brane kinetic terms , as in our case , are not assumed ) and",
    "is also compatible with qcd data  @xcite .",
    "however as we will see in the next section , lep and tevatron bounds on the trilinear gauge boson vertex requires the form factor to be constant for a larger energy range than the naive prediction ( [ simpleff ] ) based on the overlap integral method . as mentioned above this caveat exists because the overlap integral method does not include the effects of the brane thickness which should give a large correction to this prediction at low @xmath211 and give a larger constant region well above @xmath179 .",
    "while an exact calculation needs to be done we expect this behavior to follow from the fact that although in the 4d description the @xmath0-bosons are special resonances much lighter than the ir scale , they are still composites of constituents confined at @xmath213 .",
    "so a large deviation from point - like behavior should not occur well below @xmath102 .",
    "as discussed earlier from the 5d gravity perspective the @xmath0-bosons are similar to those in the original rs1 model  they are mostly localized on the ir brane with a small profile that leaks into the bulk .",
    "therefore well below @xmath102 the bulk effect should be negligible and the gauge theory on the ir brane should be a good effective description .    furthermore using the overlap integral method",
    "the contact interaction does not obtain a @xmath211-dependent form factor suppression because there is no offshell transferred momentum involved .",
    "however a @xmath211-dependent form factor is in general expected from the effective lagrangian for composite vector boson interactions .",
    "this suggests that a more comprehensive method to compute the three - point and four - point form factors is to use 5d propagators to compute the three - point and four - point correlation functions .",
    "this is , of course , a more involved calculation although related results exist in the literature  @xcite .",
    "a detailed calculation will be postponed for a separate study .      as we noted in the last subsection the sum over both the contact and @xmath204-channel graphs in our simplified computation ( using the overlap integral method )",
    "is approximately equivalent to the contact graph contribution alone with leading divergence @xmath200 , since the @xmath204-channel graphs are suppressed .",
    "in fact this failure to cancel the @xmath200 term is expected because gauge invariance is not exact in our composite model .",
    "compositeness induces energy - dependent form factors in the vertices and therefore introduces terms forbidden by a fundamental gauge symmetry , ruining the usual gauge cancelation mechanism .",
    "the cancelation is maximally violated using the overlap integral method since it is not sensitive to energy - dependence in the contact interaction .",
    "it therefore can be used to obtain a lower bound on the scale where tree - level unitarity breaks down .",
    "consider the leading divergence term for the contact graph amplitude : i^(4)(s,)=(3-^2)s^2 , which leads to the @xmath214 partial wave amplitude a_0=^1_-1 d()^(4)(s , ) = s^2 .",
    "tree - level unitarity gives a bound on @xmath215 via the optical theorem , namely : @xmath216@xcite . using this",
    ", we estimate the scale of tree - level unitarity breakdown to be @xmath217gev . again this",
    "bound assumes that the @xmath200 term from the contact interaction is not suppressed compared to the @xmath204 channel graphs near 300 gev which are negligible  a drawback of the overlap integral method .",
    "it is expected that a more accurate method which is sensitive to the energy dependence in the contact interaction can delay the unitarity breakdown scale to be near the @xmath218 confinement scale .",
    "a form factor suppression may cause a significant deviation from the sm model prediction , where a faster growth of the @xmath219 amplitude at low energy can lead to distinctive signals at the lhc , as we will consider in the next section .",
    "a natural question that remains to be answered is what happens at high energy to eventually help restore unitarity ?",
    "in analogy to hadron scattering in qcd , we expect two types of processes as the energy grows : hard elastic scattering and deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) .",
    "high energy scattering of composite states depends on the physics of the underlying constituents .",
    "even though at present we are unable to exactly specify the dual 4d gauge theory , some behavior of the underlying constituents ( or ` partons ' ) of the @xmath0-boson composite states ( or ` hadrons ' ) and their influence on composite scattering at high energy can be ascertained based on the gauge / string duality .    as shown in  @xcite , elastic scattering amplitudes for vector hadrons at large ",
    "t hooft coupling fall as @xmath220 .",
    "this form factor suppression can be intuitively understood by noting that at large momentum transfer @xmath211 , the entire hadron must shrink to a smaller size @xmath221 to scatter elastically , leading to a power - law suppression determined by the scaling of the wavefunction .",
    "this suggests that @xmath15-bosons in our emergent model undergo a similar process in the elastic scattering region where they shrink to a size @xmath222 and obtain a similar suppression . from the effective field theory point of view , below the ir cutoff scale where only massless string states are relevant , such a form factor should be calculable based on the 5d gravity model via three - point and four - point correlation functions of 5d massless gauge fields ( massless string states ) .",
    "again we postpone a detailed study to future work .    in the dis region",
    "the @xmath4 scattering amplitude becomes sensitive to short - distance physics associated with the underlying constituents .",
    "analogous to qcd , two factors are relevant in this region to determine the scattering amplitude : the constituent - level scattering amplitude , and the structure function characterizing the distribution of hadron constituents .",
    "the uv behavior of scattering constituent partons is expected to be soft both from the analogy with quark / gluon scattering in an asymptotically - free theory like qcd and the behavior of gluon scattering amplitudes in strongly - coupled cfts  @xcite .",
    "however there is a substantial difference from qcd as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite : due to the large ",
    "t hooft coupling , parton splitting is quite substantial for partons carrying a moderate bjorken @xmath18 .",
    "this means that there are no partons inside hadrons and causes the scattering to be dominated by color - neutral objects , which are the hadrons themselves .",
    "partonic scattering eventually occurs below exponentially small @xmath223 where the structure function becomes @xmath224 independent .",
    "hence in the moderate @xmath18 region the whole hadron can only scatter ` coherently ' .",
    "one way this can occur is when the parent hadron splits into two pieces with each sub - hadron shrinking to a size of order @xmath222 , which eventually scatter and then rejoin to form the parent hadron . therefore for moderate @xmath18 the effective ` constituent ' or ` scattering unit ' is sub - hadron whose structure function is suppressed at high @xmath211 due to the shrinking effect , similar to the form factor in the elastic region .",
    "although a careful study is needed to precisely ascertain how @xmath4 unitarization occurs in our emergent model , it is promising that it already contains features such as form factor suppression ( @xmath210 ) , and uv soft parton scattering .",
    "such a picture is not too dissimilar from that encountered in qcd .",
    "for example , an interesting analogy is to again consider @xmath13-meson scattering at high energy . without knowing that they are composites of quarks and gluons",
    ", we might worry about tree - level unitarity when treating them as massive gauge bosons . but",
    "as is well known near @xmath225 , unitarity is eventually restored by partonic level physics .",
    "similarly , even though our model differs from qcd , it is dual to a strongly - coupled gauge theory at large t hooft coupling where similar effects could occur . in fact",
    "the non - qcd feature of @xmath4 deep inelastic scattering would be interesting to further explore from the 5d string theory .",
    "finally we summarize the expected high - energy dis behavior of @xmath4 scattering in our model using the results in @xcite . the total cross section @xmath226 is given by _",
    "t = _ h ( e^-x 1 ) + _",
    "p(0x e^- ) , where @xmath227 involves hadronic ( partonic ) scattering . assuming coherent scattering we can write _",
    "h=_e^-^1 dx_1 dx_2",

    "b_0^e^- dx_1dx_2 f_a(x_1,q^2)f_b(x_2,q^2 ) ( abf ) b(fww ) , where @xmath231 is the parton distribution function and is essentially @xmath224 independent  @xcite . in this region",
    "the branching ratio @xmath232 should give sufficient suppression for @xmath4 outgoing states .",
    "therefore the large ",
    "t hooft coupling causes the scattering in the high - energy region to be dominated by hadronic scattering ( @xmath233 ) , while at extremely small @xmath18 ( nearly collinear scattering ) we have partonic scattering in the inelastic region .",
    "the most important , generic phenomenological consideration of emergent electroweak symmetry breaking is the momentum dependent form factors that are induced in multi gauge boson interaction vertices .",
    "it has been recognized for some time that composite gauge bosons can give rise to anomalous couplings amongst themselves  @xcite , leading to testable phenomena  @xcite .",
    "our primary task is to establish the viability of the theory when confronting the data that already exists . since form factors start deviating with respect to the sm at higher energies , it is most expedient to compare the well - measured observables involving gauge bosons in the high - energy frontier to our theory .",
    "these observables include @xmath234 at the lep2 collider , and @xmath235 at the tevatron .",
    "the first two of these processes involve the three - point interactions @xmath236 , and all three involve the three - point interaction @xmath237 .",
    "therefore , these observables are sensitive to deviations in those three - point couplings .    to proceed , we must establish a notational framework that allows easy comparison to the reported experimental results .",

    "the second kind of process is diboson production , which we define here to mean all underlying two to two processes initiated by quarks that generate vector boson pairs .",
    "it is in these studies that the triple gauge boson vertices can be measured and compared to sm values . as we mentioned above",
    ", our model may even have very large deviations compared to lhc sensitivities .",
    "nevertheless , we wish to make some further comments about how to study the deviations if they occur , and what qualitative features would develop in the observables if this model is a correct description of nature .",
    "a fruitful approach to organizing observables is to separate the processes that mostly involve multiple gauge boson interactions versus those processes that do not .",
    "for example , the production of @xmath295 at the lhc is primarily through @xmath255-channel @xmath296 , and thus its rate is highly dependent on the details of the @xmath208 vertex . on the other hand , @xmath297 production at the lhc",
    "is primarily initiated by @xmath298-channel quark exchange diagrams and the production cross - section is mostly dependent on the @xmath299 interaction vertex ( assuming this vertex has negligible form factor suppression )  @xcite . at high invariant mass energies , greater than about @xmath269 , the @xmath297 production cross - section in our model should remain similar to that of the sm , whereas the @xmath295 production cross - section should diminish rapidly .",
    "thus , a useful signature would be the ratio @xmath300 as a function of center of mass energy of the final state vector bosons .",
    "we expect that well above @xmath269 this ratio will be significantly diminished compared to the sm prediction of = 1.705 , in the induced three to two lepton ratio .",
    "this ratio is obtained from  @xcite after cuts applied .",
    "as we have seen , few of the observables in the lhc regime can be computed precisely at this time due to the complexity in determining couplings at high energies in this theory . despite this , we know that several generic features must come about , and these features can be verified by experimental measurements : vector boson production at high invariant mass will be altered by non - perturbative dynamics one way or another , through dramatic suppression factors or through new dynamics unitarizing amplitudes , and observables that are supported mostly by triple gauge boson vertices will show a differential suppression in rate compared to other observables @xmath278 .    finally , we wish to remark that the kk photon described earlier is likely to be the lightest exotic state in the spectrum .",
    "its phenomenological signatures are very similar to @xmath97 physics well studied in the literature .",
    "the discovery reach depends of course on the precise couplings , which are not determined at this time but are expected to be @xmath301 in electroweak strength . from a variety of @xmath97 theories with electroweak coupling strength one can estimate that direct limits from tevatron should be @xmath302 and direct limits from lhc should be @xmath303 after @xmath304 of data  ( see e.g.  figs .  1.6 and 1.7 of @xcite ) .",
    "if the coupling drops well below electroweak strength , which may occur from some exotic choices of fermion profiles and gauge kinetic terms on the brane , decoupling from collider observables happens rapidly and a surprisingly low mass scale  even tens of gev  could be allowed phenomenologically ( cf .  @xcite ) , although this extreme is unlikely from our theory point of view .",
    "we have presented a model of electroweak symmetry breaking in a warped dimension where electroweak symmetry is broken at the planck scale .",
    "the masses of the @xmath0 bosons result from the breaking of conformal symmetry and do not rely on a higgs mechanism .",
    "large brane kinetic terms are responsible for generating an anomalously light first kk mode that can be identified with an electroweak gauge boson , while simultaneously allowing the higher kk modes to be at the tev scale .    interestingly , by the ads / cft correspondence this model is dual to a strongly - coupled cft where the @xmath0 bosons are identified as composite states .",
    "in this way there is no fundamental electroweak symmetry in our model and electroweak symmetry breaking emerges in the ir .",
    "this realizes an old idea of mimicking the electroweak gauge bosons with the @xmath13-mesons in qcd , except that in our model the 4d theory is always strongly - coupled .",
    "furthermore via the gravity dual we are able to quantitatively check consistency with electroweak precision tests . in particular we find reasonable fits to the @xmath1 and @xmath2 parameters as well as show that the @xmath130 parameter is likely to be small .",
    "a novel feature of our setup is that there is a custodial symmetry ( a global su(2 ) symmetry in the dual cft ) which protects the @xmath2 parameter and is akin to isospin symmetry in qcd .",
    "the composite nature of the @xmath0 bosons gives rise to energy - dependent form factors and suggests distinctive signatures at the lhc .",
    "partly motivated by the form factor derived by the profile overlap integral method we have presented a more general form factor that characterizes emergent electroweak symmetry breaking .",
    "this form factor has been used to analyse constraints arising from lep2 and the tevatron , updating previous analyses and shows that there is still enough parameter space to allow for composite gauge bosons .",
    "in fact the lhc has potential to discover deviations in triple gauge boson vertices and we have suggested ways to organize observables in order to optimize future searches .",
    "our emergent model is by no means complete .",
    "although we have identified how fermion masses can be incorporated in a straightforward manner we have not performed a detailed analysis and this could affect the model in substantial ways . similarly a better understanding of unitarity in @xmath15-boson scattering is needed .",
    "this most likely requires computing the three- and four - point correlation functions in 5d to confirm the form factor suppression in the high - energy elastic scattering argued to help restore unitarity .",
    "in addition we relied on the brane thickness of the ir brane to argue for a smooth interpolating limit between a brane - localized field and a bulk field .",
    "this is a crucial aspect of our model and a thorough investigation of how exactly this affects the fermion and form factor calculations remains to be done .",
    "in addition there are interesting questions such as the nature of the underlying gauge theory and string theory realization as well as an intriguing seiberg duality .",
    "even though there are remaining issues and questions , our emergent model does provide a glimpse of how composite @xmath0 bosons can be made compatible with experiment in a framework that can be used to further develop this idea .",
    "it could be that electroweak symmetry breaking arises from a deeper level of substructure underlying the sm , where there is no higgs sector and electroweak gauge symmetry is not even fundamental .",
    "the lhc will soon let us know .",

    "in this appendix we present a more transparent way to see how a light collective mode appears when a brane kinetic term is added . as will be shown a brane kinetic term",
    "induces significant renormalizing and mixings of the original kaluza - klein kinetic term ( i.e. before adding brane kinetic terms ) , which after canonically normalizing the kinetic term and diagonalizing the mass matrix gives rise to a suppression factor in the mass of one special mode .    for simplicity we will consider the case where the boundary conditions are @xmath305 .",
    "then after adding an ir brane kinetic term we can study how the kinetic terms and mass matrix of the kaluza - klein modes changes .",
    "this is exactly the same situation for the @xmath15-boson in our model , and similarly expect the qualitative features to generalize to the more complicated case of the @xmath16-boson with mixed boundary conditions",
    ".    the 4d lagrangian of the kk modes with @xmath305 boundary conditions is given by : _",
    "4= _ n=1 ^ -(f_^(n)(x))^2-m_n^2(a_^(n)(x))^2 , where the kaluza - klein masses @xmath306 , since with @xmath305 boundary conditions there is no massless zero mode .",
    "note that in the kk basis @xmath307 , the kinetic terms of all kk modes are canonically normalized and the kaluza - klein mass matrix is diagonal . denoting the 5d profile for the @xmath308th kk mode by @xmath54",
    ", it is known that the ir overlap @xmath309 is approximately universal for all kk modes @xcite .",
    "let us now introduce an ir brane kinetic term of the form : _",
    "4=-_n , k=1^_ir f_^(n)(x ) f^(k)(x ) f_n(z_ir)f_k(z_ir ) , [ braneke ] where @xmath310 is a constant in units of @xmath311 . the introduction of ( [ braneke ] ) contains additional mixings in the kinetic terms of the original kk modes in the 4d lagrangian .",
    "thus in the kk basis @xmath307 , instead of an identity matrix , the kinetic energy matrix becomes (    ccc 1 + 2_irk & 2_irk &  + 2_irk & 1 + 2_irk &  + & & +    ) .",
    "[ kematrix ] while in principle this is an infinite - dimensional matrix , it is usually truncated as a finite @xmath312 matrix where @xmath313 characterizes the number of kk modes below the local cutoff scale , @xmath314 .",
    "it is easy to check that a truncated version of the matrix ( [ kematrix ] ) can be diagonalized with eigenvalues : (    cc i_n-1,n-1 & 0 + 0 & 1+na +    ) , where @xmath315 and @xmath316 is @xmath317 unit matrix .",
    "clearly all eigenvalues are one except for a special eigenmode which has a large eigenvalue @xmath318 . in terms of the original kk basis",
    "this special eigenmode is given by a_^(n)=_n=1^na_^(n ) .",
    "this relation implies that this mode is like a ` collective ' mode containing an equal contribution from each of the original kk modes @xmath307 . to canonically normalize the kinetic term of @xmath319",
    ", we perform a non - unitary rescaling and define the normalized mode @xmath320 .",
    "as we will show it is essentially this large rescaling factor associated with the collective mode that leads to a large suppression factor for the mass term related to the light mode after diagonalizing the kk mass matrix .",
    "the next step is to diagonalize mass matrix .",
    "analytical expressions can be obtained for the case @xmath321 .",
    "the transformation leading to the new basis @xmath322 with canonically normalized kinetic terms is (    c a_^(1 ) + a_^(2 ) + a_^(3 ) +    ) = (    ccc - & 0 & + - & & - + & & +    ) (    c a_^(1 ) + a_^(2 ) + a_^(3 ) +    ) . [ dptrans ]",
    "using ( [ dptrans ] ) the diagonal mass - squared matrix in the original basis can be rewritten in terms of the new basis @xmath322 to give : (    ccc ( m_1 ^ 2+m_3 ^ 2 ) & ( m_1 ^ 2-m_3 ^ 2 ) & + ( m_1 ^ 2-m_3 ^ 2 ) & ( m_1 ^ 2 + 4m_2 ^ 2+m_3 ^ 2 ) & + & & +    ) .",
    "[ m2dp ] the eigenvalues of the mass matrix ( [ m2dp ] ) contain two eigenvalues of order @xmath102 , as well as a light mode with mass @xmath323 . by increasing @xmath125",
    "one can numerically check that these results persist and there is always a light mode with mass : m_1^  .",
    "thus , up to an order one factor this result agrees well with the mass found in section  [ sec5dmodel ] by directly solving the equations of motion with the boundary conditions .",
    "this shows that the existence of a light collective mode originates from a large wavefunction renormalization induced by kinetic mixing from the boundary kinetic term .",
    "in this appendix we present the details of computing form factors using the profile overlap integral . as discussed in the main text we do not include the effects of large brane kinetic terms which will likely modify the low @xmath211 behavior",
    ". furthermore the overlap integral method does not give momentum dependent form factors for the contact interaction .",
    "therefore any deviation in the @xmath4 scattering amplitude using this method is encoded in the form factors of @xmath212 vertices . to be more precise , possible intermediate states in the @xmath204 channel exchange graphs contain @xmath205-boson and higher kk modes @xmath324 .",
    "these modes have a universal form factor in their coupling to @xmath4 . in 5d models",
    "the form factor can be calculated in terms of a wave function overlap integral .",
    "an ads / qcd example can be found in @xcite where the pion electromagnetic form factor is calculated by an overlap integral of an onshell pion profile @xmath325 and offshell photon profile @xmath326 , where @xmath211 is the transferred momentum carried by the probe photon .",
    "therefore in the overlap integral external states or states whose compositeness is being probed  like the incoming and outgoing @xmath15-bosons  are represented by an on - shell profile , while the probe as the intermediate state like the exchanged @xmath205 is represented by a general offshell profile with @xmath224 dependence .",
    "the offshell profile is inferred from the known onshell profile by simply replacing @xmath327 by @xmath328 in the bulk solution .",
    "thus the general solution @xmath329 for offshell modes following from the bulk equation of motion ( [ bulkeom ] ) is f(q^2,z)=n z(j_1(z)+b y_1(z ) ) , [ bulksolp ] where @xmath330 are arbitrary constants .",
    "notice that depending on the sign of @xmath328 , the solution can be divided into two qualitatively distinct regions : a timelike region with @xmath331 , which includes the onshell case , and a spacelike region with @xmath332 .",
    "in fact it is more convenient to define a real positive variable , @xmath333 for the timelike region , while @xmath334 for the spacelike region .    to determine the constants @xmath330 we require the general solution @xmath335 satisfy two conditions",
    ": it should match the onshell result at @xmath336 , and be canonically normalized like an onshell mode is close to @xmath337 .",
    "but for the present purposes , it is sufficient to require canonical normalization for all modes . ] , so that all @xmath338dependent changes due to compositeness are represented by a vertex form factor .",
    "if canonical normalization is not chosen then there is a form factor associated with the modified propagator which is an equivalent but more complicated procedure .",
    "these conditions can be satisfied by imposing the same ir boundary conditions for the offshell mode with the proper substitution of @xmath339 and then canonically normalizing the profile ( equivalent to imposing a @xmath338dependent value as the dirichlet boundary condition for the source field on the uv brane ) .",
    "this leads to the form factor : f_wwz(q^2)=\\{+_lf^l3(q^2,z_ir)(f_w(z_ir))^2 } .",
    "notice that only the @xmath163 component of the @xmath16 profile is relevant since the interaction comes from the kinetic term in the bulk lagrangian @xmath340 . the onshell @xmath15-boson profile @xmath341 is approximately given by ( [ wprofile ] ) , and @xmath78 is obtained by requiring the canonical normalization of @xmath342 . using ( [ bulksol ] ) and ( [ coeff ] ) @xmath343 is given by f^l3(q^2,z)=n_z(q^2 ) z , where b_n^l3(q^2)=. the normalization @xmath344 is given by n_z^2(q^2)&=&+_l(f^l3(q^2,z_ir))^2+_y(f^b(q^2,z_ir))^2 + & & + ( g_y5f^b(q^2 , z_uv ) + g_l5f^l3(q^2,z_uv))^2 , where @xmath345 still appears indirectly through the normalization condition .",
    "like @xmath343 , an explicit expression for @xmath345 is obtained from ( [ bulksol ] ) , ( [ coeff ] ) and ( [ coeffalp ] ) .",
    "it is difficult to obtain an analytic expression for the form factor since the small argument expansion for bessel functions that was used for light onshell modes , is no longer valid with a more general argument like @xmath346 .",
    "instead the form factor @xmath347 can be evaluated numerically and then an analytic fit can be done in the low - energy region to obtain an approximate analytic expression .",
    "the numerical results are shown in figs .",
    "[ spacelikewwz ] , and [ timelikewwz ] where the form factor is normalized so that @xmath348 .",
    "in figure  [ spacelikewwz ] the form factor in the spacelike region monotonously decreases as @xmath349 increases .",
    "this behavior also occurs in the timelike region in figure  [ timelikewwz ] , except that it is interspersed with periodic peaks and troughs .",
    "the position of every peak and trough coincides exactly with the kk mass poles : peaks are kk @xmath16-bosons , while troughs are kk photons .",
    "this form factor structure can be compared with that expected from a confining gauge theory with a gravity dual , namely  @xcite f_ab(q^2)=_n=1 , where @xmath350 is the form factor associated with a spin-1 current for two external hadrons @xmath252 , with coupling @xmath351 to an @xmath308th vector hadron state with mass @xmath64 and decay constant @xmath352 .",
    "this expression shows that in a confining gauge theory with large ",
    "t hooft coupling , the form factor can be written as a sum over vector - meson poles .",
    "our results are consistent with this formal prediction : a simple analytic fit in the low energy region ( @xmath16-pole dominant ) for both the timelike and spacelike form factor gives @xmath353 , which appears as eq.([simpleff ] ) .",
    "note that although it is difficult to find a global fit for the structure of the time - like region , this fit is good in the low - energy region ( smooth out the peak at @xmath16 pole ) which is monotonous and more relevant for lhc study .",
    "interestingly a similar pole structure was originally conjectured for qcd by sakurai  @xcite , where it was suggested that the form factor of an isospin - hadron @xmath354 is given by the @xmath13 meson pole : @xmath355 . for practical application , we can show that based on kinematics in high - energy scattering the momentum transferred in the @xmath298-channel is mostly spacelike , while in the @xmath255-channel it is always timelike .",
