    "in the quest to understand hadron structure within qcd , small violations of fundamental symmetries play a vital role .",
    "the sigma commutator , @xmath0 : @xmath1 \\right ] \\left| n\\right\\rangle =       \\bar{m}\\left\\langle n\\right| \\bar{u}u+\\bar{d}d \\left|      n\\right\\rangle =      \\bar{m}\\frac{\\partial m_{n}}{\\partial \\bar{m } } \\label{eqn : fh - commutator}\\ ] ] ( with @xmath2 the two - flavour ( @xmath3=1 , 2 , 3 ) axial charge ) is an extremely important example of such a symmetry .",
    "@xmath0 can not be accessed directly by experimental measurements . however , one can infer from world data a value of @xmath4 mev @xcite .",
    "this result has been under some scrutiny recently due to the progress in new determinations of the pion - nucleon scattering lengths @xcite and new phase shift analyses @xcite .",
    "the full lattice qcd calculations upon which our work is based involve only two active flavours , the heavier third flavour is approximated by a renormalisation of the strong coupling constant . as a guide , recent work suggests that the best value of @xmath0 may be 8 to 26 mev larger than the value quoted above @xcite .    one can notionally use qcd to directly calculate the value of @xmath0 , but in practice the calculation has proven to be difficult .",
    "early attempts @xcite to extract @xmath5 from the quark mass dependence of the nucleon mass ( using eq.([eqn : fh - commutator ] ) ) in quenched qcd with naive extrapolations produced values in the range 15 to 25 mev .",
    "attention subsequently turned to determining @xmath5 by calculating the scalar matrix element of the nucleon @xmath6 .",
    "there it was discovered that the sea - quark loops make a dominant contribution to @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "these works , based on quenched qcd simulations found values in the 40 to 60 mev range , which are more compatible with the experimental values quoted earlier .",
    "on the other hand , the most recent estimate of @xmath5 , and the only one based on a two - flavour , dynamical - fermion lattice qcd calculation , comes from the sesam collaboration .",
    "they obtain a value of @xmath7 mev @xcite , through a direct calculation of the scalar matrix element @xmath8 and the quark mass @xmath9 .",
    "the fact that neither @xmath8 , nor @xmath10 is renormalisation group invariant introduces a major difficulty in calculating the sigma commutator in this approach .",
    "one must reconstruct the scale invariant result from the product of the scale dependent matrix element and the scale dependent quark masses .",
    "the latter are extremely difficult to determine precisely and are the chief sources of uncertainty .",
    "furthermore , since lattice calculations are made at quite large pion masses , typically above 500 or 600 mev , one needs to extrapolate , in the pion mass down to the physical value at 140 mev . an important innovation adopted by dong _",
    "_ was to extrapolate @xmath11 using a form motivated by chiral symmetry , namely @xmath12 .",
    "regrettably , the value of @xmath13 used was _ not _ constrained by chiral symmetry and higher order terms of the chiral expansion were not considered .",
    "furthermore , since the work was based on a quenched calculation , the chiral behaviour implicit in the lattice results involves incorrect chiral physics @xcite .",
    "our recent work @xcite was motivated by the improvements in computing power , together with the development of improved actions @xcite , which have led to accurate calculations of the mass of the nucleon within _ full qcd _",
    "( for two flavours ) as a function of @xmath9 down to @xmath14 mev .",
    "( since @xmath15 is proportional to @xmath9 over the range studied we choose to display all results as a function of @xmath15 . )",
    "we showed that provided that one has control over the extrapolation of this lattice data to the physical pion mass , one can calculate @xmath0 from @xmath16 ( which is equivalent to eq .",
    "( [ eqn : fh - commutator ] ) where @xmath9 was used ) at @xmath17 mev .",
    "this approach has the important advantage that one _ only _ needs to work with renormalization group invariant quantities .",
    "chiral perturbation theory ( @xmath18pt ) predicts that the leading non - analytic ( lna ) correction to the self energy contribution to the nucleon mass is proportional to @xmath19 ( or @xmath20 ) .",
    "it can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : fits to data ] that the preliminary point from cp - pacs @xcite at @xmath21 gev@xmath22 does indeed suggest some curvature in this low mass region .",
    "these observations led the cp - pacs group to extrapolate their data with the simple , phenomenological form : @xmath23 rather than a naive linear form ( @xmath24 ) , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : linear fits to data ] .",
    "the corresponding fit to the combined data set , using eq .",
    "( [ eqn : phen_form_cp - pacs ] ) , is shown as the short - dashed curve in figs .",
    "[ fig : linear fits to data ] and [ fig : fits to data ] .",
    "we found that this fit gives @xmath25 mev .",
    "the difficulty with this purely phenomenological analysis was discussed in ref .",
    "the problem is that a derivative is required when evaluating @xmath0 and the value of @xmath26 found in the fit ( -0.761 gev@xmath27 ) is almost an order of magnitude smaller than the model independent lna coefficient , @xmath28 gev@xmath27 , indicated by @xmath18pt .",
    "recently , an alternative approach was suggested in ref .",
    "there it was realised that the pion loop diagrams shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : se - n?n ] yield not only the most important non - analytic structure , but also give rise to the most significant variation in the nucleon mass as @xmath29 .",
    "this leads to the following extrapolation function for @xmath30 : @xmath31 where @xmath32 and @xmath33 are the self - energy contributions of figs .",
    "[ fig : se - n?n](a ) and [ fig : se - n?n](b ) , respectively , using a cut - off in momentum controlled by @xmath34 .",
    "the full analytic expressions for @xmath32 and @xmath33 are given in ref .",
    "@xcite . for our purposes",
    "it suffices that they have precisely the correct lna and next - to - leading non - analytic behaviour required by chiral perturbation theory as @xmath35 .",
    "in addition , @xmath33 contains the correct , square root branch point ( @xmath36^{\\frac{3}{2}}$ ] ) at the @xmath37 mass difference , which is essential for extrapolations from above the @xmath38 threshold .",
    "fitting eq .",
    "( [ eqn : full - eqn ] ) to the data , including the point near 0.1 gev@xmath22 , gives the dot - dash curve in fig .",
    "[ fig : fits to data ] .",
    "the corresponding value of @xmath0 is 54.6 mev and the physical nucleon mass is 870 mev .",
    "omitting the lowest data point from the fit yields the long - dash curve in fig .",
    "[ fig : fits to data ] with @xmath39 mev , demonstrating the need for lattice simulations of qcd at light quark masses .",
    "the importance of the inclusion of the correct chiral behaviour is clearly seen by the fact that it increases the value of the sigma commutator from the 30 mev of the unconstrained cubic fit to around 50 mev .",
    "nevertheless , it is a remarkable result that the present lattice data for two - flavour dynamical - fermion qcd , yields a stable @xcite and accurate answer for the sigma commutator , an answer which is already within the range of the experimental values .",
