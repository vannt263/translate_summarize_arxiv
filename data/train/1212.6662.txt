    "deregulated electricity market has two interconnected components .",
    "the day - ahead market determines the locational marginal price ( lmp ) based on the dual variables of the optimal power flow ( opf ) solution , given generator offers , demand forecast , system topology , and security constraints .",
    "the calculation of lmp in the day - ahead market does not depend on the actual system operation . in the real - time market ,",
    "on the other hand , an ex - post formulation is often used ( by pjm and iso - new england ) to calculate the real - time lmp by solving an incremental opf problem .",
    "the lmps in the day - ahead and the real - time markets are combined in the final clearing and settlement processes .",
    "the real - time lmp is a function of data collected by the supervisory control and data acquisition ( scada ) system .",
    "therefore , anomalies in data , if undetected , will affect prices in the real - time market .",
    "while the control center employs a bad data detector to `` clean '' the real - time measurements , miss detections and false alarms will occur inevitably .",
    "the increasing reliance on the cyber system also comes with the risk that malicious data may be injected by an adversary to affect system and real - time market operations .",
    "an intelligent adversary can carefully design a data attack to avoid detection by the bad data detector .",
    "regardless of the source of data errors , it is of significant value to assess potential impacts of data quality on the real - time market , especially when a smart grid may in the future deploy demand response based on real - time lmp . to this end",
    ", we are interested in characterizing the impact of _ worst case data errors _ on the real - time lmp .",
    "the focus on the worst case also reflects the lack of an accurate model of bad data and our desire to include the possibility of data attacks .",
    "we aim to characterize the worst effects of data corruption on real - time lmp . by `` worst '' , we mean the maximum perturbation of real - time lmp caused by bad or malicious data , when a fixed set of data is subject to corruption .",
    "the complete characterization of worst data impact , however , is not computationally tractable .",
    "our goal here is to develop an optimization based approach to search for _ locally worst data _ by restricting the network congestion to a set of lines prone to congestion .",
    "we then apply computationally tractable ( greedy search ) algorithms to find the worst data and evaluate the effects of worst data by simulations .",
    "in characterizing the relation between data and real - time lmp , we first present a geometric characterization of the real - time lmp .",
    "in particular , we show that the state space of the power system is partitioned into polytope price regions , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : geometry_err](a ) , where each polytope is associated with a unique real - time lmp vector , and the price region @xmath0 is defined by a particular set of congested lines that determine the boundaries of the price region .",
    "[ c]@xmath1 [ c]@xmath2 [ c]@xmath3 [ c]@xmath4 [ c]@xmath5 [ c]@xmath6 [ c]@xmath7    two types of bad data are considered in this paper .",
    "one is the bad data associated with meter measurements such as the branch power flows in the network .",
    "such bad data will cause errors in state estimation , possibly perturbing , as an example , the correct state estimate @xmath6 in @xmath8 to @xmath7 in @xmath9 ( as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : geometry_err](a ) ) .",
    "the analysis of the worst case data then corresponds to finding the worst measurement error such that it perturbs the correct state estimation to the worst price region .",
    "the second type of bad data , one that has not been carefully studied in the context of lmp in the literature , is error in digital measurements such as switch or breaker states .",
    "such errors lead directly to topology errors therefore causing a change in the polytope structure as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : geometry_err](b ) . in this case , even if the estimated system state changes little , the prices associated with each region change , sometimes quite significantly .    before characterizing impacts of bad meter data on lmp",
    ", we need to construct appropriate models for bad data . to this end , we propose three increasingly more powerful bad data models based on the dependencies on real - time system measurements : state independent bad data , partially adaptive bad data , and fully adaptive bad data .    in studying the worst case performance ,",
    "we adopt a widely used approach that casts the problem as one involving an adversary whose goal is to make the system performance as poor as possible .",
    "the approach of finding the worst data is equivalent to finding the optimal strategy of an attacker who tries to perturb the real - time lmp and avoid being detected at the same time . by giving the adversary more information about the network state and endowing him with the ability to change data , we are able to capture the worst case performance , sometimes exactly and sometimes as bounds on performance .",
    "finally , we perform simulation studies using the ieee-14 and ieee-118 networks .",
    "we observe that bad data independent of the system state seems to have limited impact on real - time lmps , and greater price perturbations can be achieved by state dependent bad data .",
    "the results also demonstrate that the real - time lmps are subject to much larger perturbation if bad topology data are present in addition to bad meter data .",
    "while substantial price changes can be realized for small networks by the worst meter data , as the size of network grows while the measurement redundancy rate remains the same , the influence of worst meter data on lmp is reduced .",
    "however , larger system actually gives more possibilities for the bad topology data to perturb the real - time lmp more significantly .",
    "our simulation results also show a degree of robustness provided by the _ nonlinear state estimator .",
    "_ while there have been many studies on data injection attacks based on dc models , very few consider the fact that the control center typically employs the nonlinear wls state estimator under the ac model .",
    "our simulation shows that effects of bad analog data designed based on dc model may be mitigated by the nonlinear estimator whereas bad topology data coupled with bad analog data can have greater impacts on lmp .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section  [ sec : realtimelmp ] briefly describes a model of real - time lmp and introduces its geometric characterization in the state space of the power system .",
    "section  [ sec : data_quality ] establishes the bad data models and summarizes state estimation and bad data detection procedures at the control center . in section  [ sec : worstcase ] , a metric of impact on real - time lmp caused by bad meter data is introduced .",
    "we then discuss the algorithms of finding worst case bad meter data vector in terms of real - time price perturbation under the three different bad data models .",
    "section  [ sec : bad_topo ] considers the effect of bad topology data on real - time lmp .",
    "finally , in section  [ sec : simulation ] , simulation results are presented based on ieee-14 and ieee-118 networks .",
    "effects of bad data on power system have been studied extensively in the past , see .",
    "finding the worst case bad data is naturally connected with the problem of malicious data . in this context",
    ", the results presented in this paper can be viewed as one of analyzing the impact of the worst ( malicious ) data attack .    in a seminal paper by liu , ning , and reiter ,",
    "the authors first illustrated the possibility that , by compromising enough number of meters , an adversary can perturb the state estimate arbitrarily in some subspace of the state space without being detected by any bad data detector .",
    "such attacks are referred to as strong attacks .",
    "it was shown by kosut that the condition for the existence of such undetectable attacks is equivalent to the classical notion of network observability .",
    "when the adversary can only inject malicious data from a small number of meters , strong attacks do not exist , and any injected malicious data can be detected with some probability .",
    "such attacks are referred to as weak attacks . in order to affect the system operation in some meaningful way",
    ", the adversary has to risk being detected by the control center .",
    "the impacts of weak attack on power system are not well understood because the detection of such bad data is probabilistic .",
    "our results are perhaps the first to quantify such impacts .",
    "most related research works focused on dc model and linear estimator while only few have addressed the nonlinearity effect .",
    "it is well recognized that bad data can also cause topology errors , and techniques have been developed to detect topology errors .",
    "for instance , the residue vector from state estimation was analyzed for topology error detection .",
    "monticelli  @xcite introduced the idea of generalized state estimation where , roughly speaking , the topology that fits the meter measurements best is chosen as the topology estimate .",
    "the impacts of topology errors on electricity market have not been reported in the literature , and this paper aims to bridge this gap .",
    "the effect of data quality on real - time market was first considered in . in",
    ", the authors presented the financial risks induced by the data perturbation and proposed a heuristic technique for finding a case where price change happens .",
    "while there are similarities between this paper and , several significant differences exist : ( i ) this paper focuses on finding the worst case , not only a feasible case .",
    "( ii ) this paper considers a more general class of bad data where bad data may depend dynamically on the actual system measurements rather than static .",
    "( iii ) this paper considers a broader range of bad data that also include bad topology data , and our evaluations are based on the ac network model and the presence of nonlinear state estimator .",
    "in this section , we present first a model for the computation of real - time locational marginal price ( lmp ) .",
    "while isos have somewhat different methods of computing real - time lmp , they share the same two - settlement architecture and similar ways of using real - time measurements . in the following",
    ", we will use a simplified ex - post real - time market model , adopted by pjm , iso new england , and other isos .",
    "we view this model as a convenient mathematical abstraction that captures the essential components of the real - time lmp calculation . for this reason",
    ", our results should be interpreted within the specified setup .",
    "our purpose is not to include all details ; we aim to capture the essential features .    in real - time , in order to monitor and operate the system",
    ", the control center will calculate the estimated system conditions ( including bus voltages , branch flows , generation , and demand ) based on real - time measurements .",
    "we call a branch congested if the estimated flow is larger than or equal to the security limit .",
    "the congestion pattern is defined as the set of all congested lines , denoted as @xmath10 .",
    "note that we use hat ( @xmath10 ) to denote quantities or sets that are estimated based on real - time measurements .",
    "details of state estimation and bad data detection are discussed in section [ ssec : se ] .",
    "one important usage of state estimation is calculating the real - time lmp . given the estimated congestion pattern @xmath10 , the following linear program is solved to find the incremental opf dispatch and associated real - time lmp , @xmath11 @xcite : @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the vector of incremental dispatchable load , @xmath14 the vector of incremental generation dispatch , @xmath15 and @xmath16 the corresponding real - time marginal cost of generations and dispatchable loads , @xmath17 and @xmath18 the lower and upper bounds for incremental generation dispatch , @xmath19 and @xmath20 the lower and upper bounds for incremental dispatchable load , and @xmath21 the sensitivity of branch flow on branch @xmath22 with respect to the power injection at bus @xmath23 .",
    "the real - time lmp at bus @xmath23 is defined as the overall cost increase when one unit of extra load is added at bus @xmath23 , which is calculated as @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the dual variable for the load - generation equality constraint , and @xmath26 is the dual variable corresponding to the line flow constraint in ( [ eq : real - timelmp ] ) .",
    "note that in practice , the control center may use the ex - ante congestion pattern , which is obtained by running a 5 minute ahead security - constrained economic dispatch with the state estimation results and the forecasted loads ( for the next five - minute interval ) and choosing the lines congested at the dispatch solution .",
    "however , to avoid the complication due to ex - ante dispatch calculation , we assume that real - time pricing employs the estimated congestion pattern @xmath27 obtained from state estimation results . by doing so",
    ", we attempt to find direct relations among bad data , the state estimate , and real - time lmps .",
    "notice that once the congestion pattern @xmath10 is determined , the whole incremental opf problem ( [ eq : real - timelmp ] ) no longer depends on the measurement data . under the dc model",
    ", the power system state , @xmath28 , is defined as the vector of voltage phases , except the phase on the reference bus .",
    "the power flow vector @xmath29 is a function of the system state @xmath28 , @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the sensitivity matrix of branch flows with respect to the system state .",
    "assume the system has @xmath32 buses .",
    "then , @xmath33^n$ ] , where @xmath34 represents the state space .",
    "any system state corresponds to a unique point in @xmath34 . from ( [ eq : flowequation ] ) , the branch flow @xmath29 is determined by the system state @xmath28 . comparing the flows with the flow limits , we obtain the congestion pattern associated with this state .",
    "hence , each point in the state space corresponds to a particular congestion pattern .",
    "we note that the above expression in ( [ eq : lmpcal ] ) appears earlier in where the role of congestion state in lmp computation was discussed . in this paper ,",
    "our objective is to make explicit the connection between data and lmp .",
    "we therefore need a linkage between data and congestion . to this end",
    ", we note that the power system state , the congestion state , and lmp form a markov chain , which led to a geometric characterization of lmp on the power system state space , as shown in the following theorem .",
    "assume that the lmp exists for every possible congestion pattern ) with respect to demand at each bus exists ] .",
    "then , the state space @xmath35 is partitioned into a set of polytopes @xmath36 where the interior of each @xmath0 is associated with a unique congestion pattern @xmath37 and a real - time lmp vector .",
    "each boundary hyperplane of @xmath0 is defined by a single transmission line .",
    "[ thm : partition ]    for a particular congestion pattern @xmath38 defined by a set of congested lines , the set of states that gives @xmath38 is given by @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the @xmath23th row of @xmath31 ( see ( [ eq : flowequation ] ) ) , and @xmath41 the flow limit on branch @xmath42 . since @xmath0 is defined by the intersection of a set of half spaces ,",
    "it is a polytope .    given an estimated congestion pattern @xmath27 , the envelop theorem implies that for any optimal primal solution and dual solution of ( [ eq : real - timelmp ] ) that satisfy the kkt conditions , ( [ eq : lmpcal ] ) always gives the derivative of the optimal objective value with respect to the demand at each bus , which we assume exists , @xmath43 each congestion pattern is associated with a unique real - time lmp vector @xmath44 .",
    "hence , all states with the same congestion pattern share the same real - time lmp , which means each polytope @xmath0 in @xmath35 corresponds to a unique real - time lmp vector .",
    "theorem  [ thm : partition ] characterizes succinctly the relationship between the system state and lmp . as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : geometry_err](a ) , if bad data are to alter the lmp in real - time , the size of the bad data has to be sufficiently large so that the state estimate at the control center is moved to a different price region from the true system state . on the other hand , if some lines are erroneously removed from or added to the correct topology , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : geometry_err](b ) , it affects the lmp calculation in three ways ) @xcite . however , dealing with contingency constraints will significantly complicate our analysis and possibly obscure the more direct link between bad data and real - time lmp .",
    "hence , we consider only line congestion constraints in ( [ eq : real - timelmp ] ) . ] .",
    "first , the state estimate is perturbed since the control center employs an incorrect topology in state estimation .",
    "secondly , the price partition of the state space changes due to the errors in topology information .",
    "third , the shift matrix @xmath45 in ( [ eq : real - timelmp ] ) , which is a function of topology , changes thereby altering prices attached to each price region .",
    "in order to monitor the system , various meter measurements are collected in real time , such as power injections , branch flows , voltage magnitudes , and phasors , denoted by a vector @xmath46 .",
    "if there exists bad data @xmath47 among the measurements , the measurement with bad data , denoted by @xmath48 , can be expressed as a function of the system states @xmath28,@xmath49 where @xmath50 represents the random measurement noise .",
    "we make a distinction here between the measurement noise and bad data ; the former accounts for random noise independently distributed across all meters whereas the latter represents the perturbation caused by bad or malicious data .",
    "we assume no specific pattern for bad data except that they do not happen everywhere .",
    "we assume that bad data can only happen in a subset of the measurements , @xmath51 .",
    "we call @xmath51 as set of suspectable meters , which means the meter readings with in @xmath51 may subject to corruption .",
    "if the cardinality of @xmath51 is @xmath22 , the feasible set of bad data @xmath47 is a @xmath22-dimensional subspace , denoted as @xmath52 .",
    "we will consider three bad data models with increasing power of affecting state estimates .",
    "m1 . _ state independent bad data _ : this type of bad data is independent of real - time measurements",
    ". such bad data may be the replacement of missing measurements .",
    "_ partially adaptive bad data _",
    ": this type of bad data may arise from the so - called man in the middle ( mim ) attack where an adversary intercepts the meter data and alter the data based on what he has observed .",
    "such bad data can adapt to the system operating state .",
    "_ fully adaptive bad data _",
    ": this is the most powerful type of bad data , constructed based on the actual measurement @xmath53 .",
    "note that m3 is in general not realistic .",
    "our purpose of considering this model is to use it as a conservative proxy to obtain performance bounds for the impact of worst case data .",
    "we assume herein a dc model in which the measurement function @xmath54 in ( [ eq : z = hxwa ] ) is linear .",
    "specifically , @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the measurement matrix . such a dc model , while widely used in the literature , may only be a crude approximation of the real power system . by making such a simplifying assumption and acknowledging its weaknesses , we hope to obtain tractable solutions in searching for worst case scenarios .",
    "it is important to note that , although the worst case scenarios are derived from the dc model , we carry out simulations using the actual nonlinear system model .",
    "topology data are represented by a binary vector @xmath57 , where each entry of @xmath58 represents the state of a line breaker ( @xmath59 for open and @xmath60 for closed ) .",
    "the bad topology data is modeled as @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the set of possible bad data .",
    "when bad data are present , the topology processor will generate the topology estimate corresponding to @xmath63 , and this incorrect topology estimate will be passed to the following operations unless detected by the bad data detector .",
    "we assume that the control center employs the standard weighted least squares ( wls ) state estimator . under dc model , @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the covariance matrix of measurement noise @xmath50 , and @xmath66 .",
    "if the noise @xmath50 is gaussian , the wls estimator is also the maximum likelihood estimate ( mle ) of state @xmath28 . by the invariant property of mle , from ( [ eq : flowequation ] ) , the maximum likelihood estimate of the branch flows is calculated as @xmath67    the congestion pattern used in real - time lmp calculation ( [ eq : real - timelmp ] ) is directly from state estimation and consists of all the estimated branch flows which are larger than or equal to the branch flow limits , @xmath43 @xmath68 where @xmath69 is the flow limit on branch @xmath42 .    in the presence of bad meter data @xmath47 , the meter measurements collected by control center",
    "is actually @xmath70 . by using @xmath48 ,",
    "the wls state estimate is @xmath71 where @xmath72 is the ",
    "correct \" state estimate without the presence of the bad data ( @xmath73 ) .",
    "( [ eq : state_move ] ) shows that the effect of bad data on state estimation is linear .",
    "however , because @xmath47 is confined in a @xmath22-dimensional subspace @xmath74 , the perturbation on the actual system state is limited to a certain direction .",
    "when bad data exist both in meter and topology data , the control center uses a wrong measurement matrix @xmath75 , corresponding to the altered topology data , and the altered meter data @xmath76 .",
    "then , the wls state estimate becomes @xmath77 where @xmath78 .",
    "note that unlike the linear effect of bad meter data , bad topology data affects the state estimate by altering the measurement matrix @xmath56 to @xmath75 .",
    "the control center uses bad data detection to minimize the impact of bad data . here",
    ", we assume a standard bad data detection used in practice , the @xmath79-detector in . in particular , the @xmath79-detector performs the test on the residue error , @xmath80 , based on the state estimate @xmath6 . from the wls state estimate ( [ eq : wls ] ) , we have @xmath81 where @xmath82 the @xmath79-detector is a threshold detector defined by @xmath83 where @xmath84 is the threshold calculated from a prescribed false alarm probability , and @xmath85 .",
    "when the measurement data fail to pass the bad data test , the control center declares the existence of bad data and takes corresponding actions to identify and remove the bad data .    in this paper",
    ", we are interested in those cases when bad data are present while the @xmath79-detector fails to detect them .",
    "in this section , we examine the impact of bad data on lmp , assuming that the topology estimate of the network is correct .     one thing to notice",
    "is that in searching for the `` worst '' case , we take the perspective of the control center , not that of the attacker . in particular , we look for the worst congestion pattern for the lmp computation , even if this particular congestion pattern is difficult for the attacker to discover .",
    "so the focus here is not how easy it is for an attacker to find a locally worst congestion pattern ; it is how much such a congestion pattern affects the lmp .      in order to quantify the effect of bad data on real - time price",
    ", we need to first define the metric to measure the effect .",
    "we define the _ relative price perturbation _ ( rpp ) as the expected percentage price perturbation caused by bad data .",
    "given that lmp varies at different buses , rpp also varies at different locations .",
    "let @xmath48 be the data received at the control center and @xmath86 the lmp at bus @xmath23 .",
    "the rpp at bus @xmath23 is a function of bad data @xmath47 , given by @xmath87 where the expectation is over random state and measurement noise . to measure the system - wide price perturbation",
    ", we define the _ average relative price perturbation _ ( arpp ) by @xmath88 where @xmath32 is the number of buses in the system .",
    "the worst case analysis to be followed can be used for other metrics ( e.g. , price increase ratios or price decrease ratios , which are closely related to the market participants gain or loss ) .",
    "similar results can be showed following the same strategies .",
    "however , the comparison among different metrics is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "first , we consider the state independent bad data model ( m1 ) given in section  [ ssec : data_quality ] . in this model ,",
    "the bad data are independent of real - time measurements .    in constructing the state independent worst data ,",
    "it is useful to incorporate prior information about the state . to this end , we assume that system state follows a gaussian distribution with mean @xmath89 , covariance matrix @xmath90 . typically , we choose @xmath89 as the day - ahead dispatch since the nominal system state in real - time varies around its day - ahead projection .    in the presence of bad data @xmath47 ,",

    "any bad data vector @xmath47 satisfying condition  ( [ eq : full ] ) can serve as the worst fully adaptive bad data .",
    "the strategies presented above are based on the exhaustive search over all possible congestion patterns .",
    "such approaches are not scalable for large networks with a large number of possible congestion patterns .",
    "we now present a greedy heuristic approach aimed at reducing computation cost .",
    "in particular , we develop a gradient like algorithm that searches among a set of likely congestion patterns .",
    "first , we restrict ourselves to the set of lines that are close to their respective flow limits and look for bad data that will affect the congestion pattern .",
    "the intuition is that it is unlikely that bad data can drive the system state sufficiently far without being detected by the bad data detector . in practice",
    ", the cardinality of such a set is usually very small compared with the systems size .",
    "second , we search for the worst data locally by changing one line in the congestion pattern at a time . specifically , suppose that a congestion pattern is the current candidate for the worst data .",
    "given a set of candidate lines that are prone to congestions , we search locally by flipping one line at a time from the congested state to the un - congested state and vice versa .",
    "if no improvement can be made , the algorithm stops .",
    "otherwise , the algorithm updates the current `` worst congestion pattern '' and continue .",
    "the effectiveness of this greedy heuristic is tested in section [ ssec : sim_heuristic ] .",
    "so far , we have considered bad data in the analog measurements . in this section ,",
    "we include the bad _ topology _ data , and describe another bad data model .",
    "we represent the network topology by a directed graph @xmath119 where each @xmath120 denotes a bus and each @xmath121 denotes a _ connected _ transmission line . for each physical transmission line ( a physical line between @xmath23 and @xmath42 )",
    ", we assign an arbitrary direction ( @xmath122 ) for the line , and @xmath122 is in @xmath123 if and only if bus @xmath23 and bus @xmath42 are connected .",
    "bad data may appear in both analog measurements and digital ( breaker status ) data , as described in section  [ ssec : data_quality ] : @xmath124    as in section  [ sec : worstcase ] , we employ the adversary model to describe the worst case .",
    "the adversary alters @xmath58 to @xmath125 by adding @xmath126 from the set of feasible attack vectors @xmath62 such that the topology processor produces the `` target '' topology @xmath127 as the topology estimate .",
    "in addition , the adversary modifies @xmath115 by adding @xmath128 such that @xmath48 looks consistent with @xmath127 . in this section ,",
    "we focus on the worst case when the adversary is able to alter the network topology without changing the state estimate .",
    "we also require that such bad data are generated by an adversary causing undetectable topology change , the bad data escape the system bad data detection . for the worst case analysis , we will maximize the lmp perturbation among the attacks within this specific class .",
    "even though this approach is suboptimal , the simulation results in section  [ sec : simulation ] demonstrate that the resulting lmp perturbation is much greater than the worst case of the bad meter data .",
    "suppose the adversary wants to mislead the control center with the target topology @xmath129 , a topology obtained by _ _ removing _ _ a set of transmission lines @xmath130 in @xmath131 ( @xmath132 ) .",
    "we assume that the system with @xmath127 is observable : the corresponding measurement matrix @xmath75 has full column rank .",
    "suppose that the adversary changes the breaker status such that the target topology @xmath129 is observed at the control center .",
    "simultaneously , if the adversary introduces bad data @xmath133 , then @xmath134 which means that the meter data received at the control center are completely consistent with the model generated from @xmath127 .",
    "thus , any bad data detector will not be effective .",
    "it is of course not obvious how to produce the bad data @xmath47 , especially when the adversary can only modify a limited number of measurements , and it may not have access to the entire state vector @xmath28 .",
    "fortunately , it turns out that @xmath47 can be generated by observing only a few entries in @xmath115 without requiring global information ( such as the state vector @xmath28 ) .",
    "a key observation is that @xmath135 and @xmath136 differ only in a few entries corresponding to the modified topology ( lines in @xmath137 ) as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : similarity ] .",
    "consider first the noiseless case .",
    "let @xmath138 denote the entry of @xmath115 corresponding to the flow measurement from @xmath23 to @xmath42 . as hinted from fig .",
    "[ fig : similarity ] , it can be easily seen that @xmath139 has the following sparse structure : @xmath140 where @xmath141 denotes the line flow from @xmath23 to @xmath42 when the line is connected and the system state is @xmath28 , and @xmath142 is the column of the measurement - to - branch incidence matrix , that corresponds to @xmath122 : @xmath142 is an @xmath143-dimensional vector with @xmath60 at the entries corresponding to the flow from @xmath23 to @xmath42 and the injection at @xmath23 , and @xmath144 at the entries for the flow from @xmath42 to @xmath23 and the injection at @xmath42 , and @xmath59 at all other entries .",
    "absence of noise implies that @xmath145 , which leads to @xmath146    [ c ] [ c ]   and @xmath136 : each row is marked by the corresponding meter ( @xmath23 for injection at @xmath23 and @xmath122 for flow from @xmath23 to @xmath42).,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=40.0% ]    with ( [ eq : heuristic_attack ] ) in mind , one can see that setting @xmath147 and adding @xmath47 to @xmath115 is equivalent to the following simple procedure : as described in fig .",
    "[ fig : heuristic ] , for each @xmath122 in @xmath130 ,    1 .",
    "subtract @xmath138 and @xmath148 from @xmath149 and @xmath150 respectively .",
    "2 .   set @xmath138 and @xmath148 to be @xmath59 .    where @xmath149 is the entry of @xmath115 corresponding to the injection measurement at bus @xmath23 .",
    "when measurement noise is present ( @xmath151 ) , the idea of the attack is still the same : to make @xmath47 approximate @xmath139 so that @xmath76 is close to @xmath152 . since @xmath153",
    ", @xmath138 is an unbiased estimate of @xmath154 for each @xmath155 , and this implies that @xmath156 is an unbiased estimate of @xmath157 .",

    ", the adversary should be able to ( i ) set @xmath126 such that the topology processor produces @xmath127 instead of @xmath131 and ( ii ) observe and modify @xmath138 , @xmath148 , @xmath149 , and @xmath150 for all @xmath155 .",
    "the attack is feasible if and only if @xmath74 and @xmath159 contain the corresponding attack vectors .    to find the worst case lmp perturbation due to undetectable , state - preserving attacks , let @xmath160 denote the set of feasible @xmath127s , for which the attack can be launched with @xmath74 and @xmath159 . among the feasible targets in @xmath160 , we consider the best target topology that results in the maximum perturbation in real - time lmps .",
    "if arpp is used as a metric , the best target is chosen as @xmath161=\\mbox{arg } \\max_{\\bar{{\\mathscr{g } } } \\in { \\mathscr{f } } } \\sum_{i}\\left|\\frac{\\lambda_i(z;\\bar{{\\mathscr{g } } } ) - \\lambda_i(z;{\\mathscr{g}})}{\\lambda_i(z;{\\mathscr{g}})}\\right| . \\ ] ] where @xmath162 denotes the real - time lmp at bus @xmath23 when the attack with the target @xmath127 is launched on @xmath115 , and @xmath163 is the real - time lmp under no attack .",
    "in this section , we demonstrate the impact of bad data on real - time lmps with the numerical simulations on ieee-14 and ieee-118 systems .",
    "we conducted simulations in two different settings : the linear model with the dc state estimator and the nonlinear model with the ac state estimator .",
    "the former is usually employed in the literature for the ease of analysis whereas the latter represents the practical state estimator used in the real - world power system . in all simulations ,",
    "the meter measurements consist of real power injections at all buses and real power flows ( both directions ) at all branches .",
    "we first present the simulation results for the linear model with the dc state estimator .",
    "we modeled bus voltage magnitudes and phases as gaussian random variables with the means equal to the day - ahead dispatched values and small standard deviations . in each monte carlo run , we generated a state realization from the statistical model , and the meter measurements were created by the dc model with gaussian measurement noise .",
    "once the measurements were created , bad data were added in the manners discussed in section  [ sec : worstcase ] and section  [ sec : bad_topo ] . with the corrupted measurements , the control center executed the dc state estimation and the bad data test with the false alarm probability constraint @xmath164 .",
    "if the data passed the bad data test , real - time lmps were evaluated based on the state estimation results . for ieee-14 and ieee-118 system , the network parameters .",
    "lines ( 2 , 3 ) , ( 4 , 5 ) , and ( 6 , 11 ) had line capacities 50 , 50 , and 20 mw , and other lines had no line limit . in the ieee-118 simulation , the generators had generation costs arbitrarily selected from @xmath165 and generation capacities arbitrarily selected from @xmath166 .",
    "total 16 lines had the line capacities arbitrarily selected from @xmath167 , and other lines had no line limit . to handle possible occurrence of price spikes , we set the upper and lower price caps as 500@xmath168 and -100@xmath168 respectively .",
    "total 1000 monte carlo runs were executed for each case . ]",
    "are available in @xcite .",
    "we used the number of meter data to be modified by the adversary as the metric for the attack effort .",
    "for the 14 bus system , in each monte carlo run , we randomly chose two lines , and the adversary was able to modify all the line flow meters on the lines and injection meters located at the ends of the lines .",
    "for the 118 bus system , we randomly chose three lines , and the adversary had control over the associated line and injection meters .",
    "both state and topology attacks were set to control the same number of meter data so that we can fairly compare their impacts on real - time lmps . as for the meter data attack ,",
    "we only considered the lines that are close to their flow limits ( estimated flows under m1 and m2 , or actual flows under m3 ) as candidates for congestion pattern search .",
    "the threshold is chosen as 10mw in our simulation .",
    "[ fig : arpp_linear ] is the plot of arpps in all the simulations . in the figures , we draw arpps of those cases as horizontal lines so that we can compare them with other cases . ] versus detection probabilities of bad data .",
    "they show that even when bad data were detected with low probability , arpps were large , especially for the fully adaptive bad meter data and the bad topology data .    comparing arpps of the three bad meter data models , we observe that the adversary may significantly improve the perturbation amount by exploiting partial or all real - time meter data ( for the partially adaptive case , the adversary observed a half of all meters . )",
    "it is worthy to point out that bad topology data result in much greater price perturbation than bad meter data .",
    "recall the discussion in section  [ sec : realtimelmp ] and section  [ sec : bad_topo ] that bad topology data and bad meter data employ different price - perturbing mechanisms : bad topology data perturb real - time lmp by restructuring the price regions without perturbing the state estimate ( the line - removal attack introduced in section  [ sec : bad_topo ] does not perturb state estimate ) whereas bad meter data perturb real - time lmp by simply moving the state estimate to a different price region .",
    "therefore , the observation implies that restructuring the price regions has much greater impact on real - time lmp than merely perturbing the state estimate .",
    "the simulations with the nonlinear model intend to investigate the vulnerability of the real - world power system to the worst adversarial act , designed based on the linear model .",
    "the simulations were conducted on ieee-14 and ieee-118 systems in the same manner as the linear case except that we employed the nonlinear model and the ac state estimation .    fig .",
    "[ fig : arpp_nonlinear ] is the plot of arpps versus detection probabilities .",
    "the result shows that the proposed methodology can affect the system to some extent even when nonlinear estimator is used , especially when the bad data are present in the topology data , although the nonlinear estimator makes this effect relatively less significant compared with the linear case results .",
    "we also conducted simulation based on the proposed greedy search technique in section [ ssec : heuristic ] .",
    "the simulation was based on 118 bus system , and all parameters were the same as those presented in section [ ssec : sim_linear ] .",
    "we compared the performance and computation time of the greedy heuristics with exhaustive search benchmark , as shown in table [ tab : greedy ] .",
    "notice here the exhaustive search and greedy search are both over the lines that are close to their flow limits ( estimated flows under m1 and m2 , or actual flows under m3 ) , the same as in section [ ssec : sim_linear ] . in table [",
    "tab : greedy ] , the second column ( average search time ) is the average searching time for worst congestion pattern over 1000 monte carlo runs , and the third column ( accuracy ) is the percentage that the greedy search find the same worst congestion pattern as the exhaustive search .",
    "from the result , we can see that using greedy heuristic can give us much faster processing algorithm without losing much of the accuracy .",

    "we report in this paper a study on impacts of worst data on the real - time market operation .",
    "a key result of this paper is the geometric characterization of real - time lmp given in theorem [ thm : partition ] .",
    "this result provides insights into the relation between data and the real - time lmp ; it serves as the basis of characterizing impacts of bad data .",
    "our investigation includes bad data scenarios that arise from both analog meter measurements and digital breaker state data . to this end , we have presented a systematic approach by casting the problem as one involving an adversary injecting malicious data . while such an approach often gives overly conservative analysis , it can be used as a measure of assurance when the impacts based on worst case analysis are deemed acceptable .",
    "we note that , because we use adversary attacks as a way to study the worst data , our results have direct implications when cyber - security of smart grid is considered . given the increasing reliance on information networks , developing effective countermeasures against malicious data attack on the operations of a future smart grid is crucial .",
    "see for discussion about countermeasures .    from a practical viewpoint ,",
    "our result can serve as the guideline to the real - time operation . following the methodology in our paper , worst effect of a specific set of meters on real - time lmp can be checked .",
    "once a huge potential perturbation is detected , alarm should be made and the operator needs to check the accuracy of these specific data , add protection devices , or even add more redundant meters .",
    "although our findings are obtained from academic benchmarks involving relatively small size networks , we believe that the general trend that characterizes the effects of bad data is likely to persist in practical networks of much larger size .",
    "in particular , as the network size increases and the number of simultaneous appearance of bad data is limited , the effects of the worst meter data on lmp decrease whereas the effects of the worst topology data stay nonnegligible regardless of the network size .",
    "this observation suggests that the bad topology data are potentially more detrimental to the real - time market operation than the bad meter data .",
    "the authors wish to acknowledge comments and suggestions from the anonymous reviewers that help to clarify a number of issues and improve the presentation ."
