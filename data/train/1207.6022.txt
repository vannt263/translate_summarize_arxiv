    "<S> we consider two types of trajectories found in a wide range of mechanical systems , _ viz . _ box orbits and loop orbits . we elucidate the dynamics of these orbits in the simple context of a perturbed harmonic oscillator in two dimensions . </S>",
    "<S> we then examine the small - amplitude motion of a rigid body , the rocknroller , a sphere with eccentric distribution of mass . </S>",
    "<S> the equations of motion are expressed in quaternionic form and a complete analytical solution is obtained . both types of orbit , boxes and loops , are found , the particular form depending on the initial conditions . </S>",
    "<S> we interpret the motion in terms of epi - elliptic orbits . </S>",
    "<S> the phenomenon of _ recession _ , or reversal of precession , is associated with box orbits . </S>",
    "<S> the small - amplitude solutions for the symmetric case , or routh sphere , are expressed explicitly in terms of epicycles ; there is no recession in this case . </S>"
