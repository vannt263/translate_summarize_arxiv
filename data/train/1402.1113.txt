    "dynamical spin excitations of impurities is a subject that douglas l. mills tackled 50 years ago , while in france as a post - doctoral fellow in the group of jacques friedel .",
    "it was one of his first experiences in the realm of magnetism , after completing a phd thesis supervised by charles kittel .",
    "since then , his several contributions in this field , going from magnetic bulk materials down to magnetic surfaces or adatoms , were tremendous and important .",
    "his work is notorious for making significant predictions often years or decades before experimental techniques advanced to the point where his findings can be verified .",
    "the seminal paper on spin - excitations  @xcite , written with pascal lederer , is a beautiful example . within a framework conceptually similar to that used in the present contribution",
    ", he predicted that , if an experimental tool would be able to probe the local magnetic response of isolated impurities embedded in a paramagnetic metallic host , and if a static external magnetic field is applied , the measured spectrum would display a shift in the position of the excitation signature from what is expected with a heisenberg model together with a very substantial broadening ( decrease of the lifetime ) of the excitational signature induced by the decay of the coherent spin precession to particle - hole pairs .",
    "that tool turned out to be inelastic scanning tunneling spectroscopy ( ists ) , applied to the measurement of spin - excitations of magnetic adatoms adsorbed on nonmagnetic substrates ( see _ e.g. _  refs .",
    "@xcite ) , and with which many of the predictions of douglas l. mills were verified .",
    "understanding the excitation and the dynamical behavior of such nano - magnetic systems is naturally a topic of prime importance , actively studied recently both to provide insight into fundamental aspects of magnetism and as possible elements for future information technology .",
    "access to magnetic excitation spectra is of high value in nanospintronics , due to the role of spin excitations as a dynamical route to control magnetic elements and ( spin ) currents , the building blocks of spintronics .",
    "the principle of ists is depicted schematically in fig .",
    "[ concept_ists ] .",
    "electrons can tunnel , for example , from the tip to the available states of the substrate , leading to a tunneling current @xmath0 ( fig .  [ concept_ists]a ) . if the bias voltage , @xmath1 , between the tip and substrate is large enough , and if a spin - excitational mode is possible in the adsorbate , the electron can exchange energy and possibly spin angular momentum with the latter , thereby triggering the excitation ( fig .  [",
    "concept_ists]b ) .",
    "this creates an additional tunneling channel , translating to an increase in @xmath0 , also seen as a change in the slope of the @xmath0 vs @xmath1 curve ( fig .",
    "[ concept_ists]c ) .",
    "the first derivative of the current with respect to the bias voltage , @xmath2 , leads to a step - like function located at the characteristic frequency of the excitational mode ( fig .",
    "[ concept_ists]d ) , while the second derivative @xmath3 displays a resonance ( fig .",
    "[ concept_ists]e ) with a given linewidth .    ,",
    "to trigger the excitation mode , an additional tunneling channel is created ( b ) .",
    "the slope of the tunneling current @xmath0 versus @xmath1 curve ( c ) changes at a bias voltage corresponding to the frequency of the excitation mode .",
    "taking the first and second derivatives of this curve leads to a step - like function ( d ) or to a resonance ( e ) at @xmath4 . ]",
    "several parameters determine the properties of these excitations and the related spin - dynamics , _ e.g. _",
    "( i ) the type of substrate , ( ii ) the details of the hybridization between the electronic states of the adsorbate and those of the substrate , ( iii ) and the symmetry , shape and size of the adsorbate .",
    "one theoretical approach to the interpretation of ists experiments is based on the heisenberg hamiltonian , describing an atomic - like localized moment with integer or half - integer spin .",
    "such a model is useful mainly for systems where the substrate interacts weakly with the adsorbate  @xcite ; it fails qualitatively to describe cases with strong coupling to the substrate electrons , where hybridization leads to moments far from integer and half integer values , and adsorbate electronic levels with widths in the range of @xmath5  ev .",
    "interestingly , a heisenberg model predicts the existence of spin - excitations in all cases , however inelastic features are commonly not observed experimentally .",
    "moreover a heisenberg model can not describe the main characteristics of spin - excitations , such as their lifetimes .    a theoretical description of spin - excitations able to describe hybridization effects",
    "is thus required .",
    "employing a method based on first - principles electronic structure calculations is therefore a good choice but highly non - trivial , since access to dynamical response functions is required not only for bulk materials but also for surfaces and for nanostructures deposited on surfaces , which also present a high computational burden .",
    "the transverse dynamical magnetic susceptibility , @xmath6 , describes , in linear response , the amplitude of the transverse spin motion produced by an external magnetic field @xmath7 of frequency @xmath8 .",
    "it is a quantity providing a theoretical inelastic spectrum comparable to the experimental spectra .",
    "indeed , the imaginary part of @xmath6 gives access to the local density of spin - excitations .    to calculate the dynamical magnetic susceptibility",
    ", one could employ either time - dependent density functional theory ( td - dft )  @xcite or many - body perturbation theory ( mbpt ) based on dft  @xcite .",
    "since these types of calculations for magnetic materials are computationally expensive , very few dft - based calculations , even for bulk systems , were performed  @xcite , and it is only recently that a few groups have undertaken the task of calculating dynamical transverse magnetic response functions for bulk materials  @xcite , thin films  @xcite and adatoms or nanostructures on surfaces  @xcite .",
    "several studies based on empirical tight binding ( etb ) theory and mbpt were published  @xcite which , although relying on the accuracy of fitting parameters , have advanced the understanding of many effects accompanying spin - excitations .",
    "our first - principles scheme uses td - dft ( see refs .",
    "@xcite ) and is designed for the investigation of spin - excitations in a real - space fashion , while applicable for systems with extended dimensions .",
    "the focus on a real - space approach stems from our primary goal of investigating magnetic excitations in adatoms and small nanostructures measured with ists .    in all schemes , a similar master equation , a dyson - like equation , must be tackled .",

    ", @xmath10 is the effective coulomb interaction corresponding to the local exchange splitting divided by the magnetic moment .",
    "it turns out that in dft based methods , the goldstone theorem is violated in numerical studies : for instance , zero wavevector spin waves have finite frequency even with spin - orbit coupling set aside .",

    "such a method is required to describe spin - excitations in metallic systems where hybridization of electronic states plays a crucial role and a heisenberg model of the type used in ref .",
    "@xcite would fail qualitatively . as mentioned above ,",

    "@xcite show that fe adatoms on pt(111 ) exhibit a very low mae and long precessional lifetimes , and moreover that these properties are strongly dependent on which hollow site an adatom occupies ( fcc or hcp , according to how they stack with respect to the sub - surface pt layer ) .",
    "in contrast , those reported in ref .",
    "@xcite suggest maes of the order of 10 mev for co adatoms and 6 mev for fe adatoms without distinguishing between the two possible hollow sites .",
    "it is interesting to note that , contrary to balashov and coworkers , the experiments of khajetoorians _",
    "involved the application of an external magnetic field which verified the spin - nature of the observed resonances .",
    "to unravel the origin of the site - dependent mae for fe adatoms , we analyzed the connection between the mae and the binding site using the full - potential version of the kkr method  @xcite .",
    "pt(111 ) is a notoriously challenging substrate since its high magnetic polarizability  @xcite surrounds the magnetic adatom with an extended spin polarization cloud , as seen for pd  @xcite ; in this light we carefully checked all calculations .",
    "considering the fe adatom relaxed by 20% of the bulk vertical interlayer distance towards the surface , we obtained fig .",
    "[ mae ] depicting the dependence of the mae on the number of substrate pt atoms included in the self - consistent simulations .",
    "mae versus number of atoms in cluster from kkr - gf calculations , for two different surface positions , fcc and hcp ( see text ) .",
    "positive for preferred in - plane orientation and negative for out - of - plane .",
    "the change of easy axis with increasing number of substrate pt atoms is only present for the hcp site . ]",
    "the computed spin moments are , for the fcc site : @xmath97 ( @xmath98 ) ; hcp site : @xmath99 ( @xmath100 ) for the adatom ( whole cluster  220 pt atoms ) , respectively .",
    "the orbital moments are for fcc site   @xmath101 ( @xmath102 ) ; hcp site  @xmath103 ( @xmath102 ) .",
    "the mae yields @xmath104 mev ( out - of - plane ) and @xmath105 mev ( in - plane ) . here",
    ", it was crucial to include a large number of substrate atoms , in order to converge the calculation and to reproduce the observed differences between the fcc site and the hcp site . for a cluster with 1012 pt atoms , calculations of both hcp- and",
    "fcc - sites yield an out of plane easy axis , with convergence of the calculation occurring only when including more pt atoms .",
    "the small value of the anisotropy for hcp - site  is cautionary but mostly in  line with those based on a supercell kkr - method  @xcite , although the reported easy axis was found to be out - of - plane for both binding sites .    for the fcc site",
    ", the mae favors an out - of - plane configuration , and so the behavior of the spin - excitation spectra is expected to be similar to what was observed for fe adatoms on cu(111 ) and ag(111 ) substrates , _ i.e. _ , the resonance energy increases linearly with the magnetic field . however , in the hcp site the magnetic moments lies in - plane , and so , after applying a magnetic field normal to the surface , a gradual reorientation of the magnetic moment out of the surface plane will occur for increasing values of the magnetic field , leading to a plateau - like behavior of the resonance energy .",
    "it is only when the magnetic field is large enough to completely reorient the magnetic moment out - of - plane that one recovers the usual linear behavior of the resonance energy versus magnetic field ( see ref .",

    "the calculated @xmath78 is found to be larger for hcp - site  ( 4.8 ps ) than for fcc - site  ( 1.2 ps ) , as experimentally obtained ( @xmath116 ps and @xmath117 ps ) . as spin - orbit coupling",
    "was not included in these calculations , it is possible that it can modify the computed values of the @xmath56-factor and the lifetime ; however , given that the trends are reproduced , no qualitative impact is expected .",
    "once more the shift in @xmath56 and the reduction of the lifetime for increasing magnetic field result from spin - dependent scattering by conduction electrons ( stoner excitations ) which damp the spin precession . unlike fe adatoms on both cu(111 ) and ag(111 ) , those on the pt(111 ) surface",
    "show comparatively larger precessional lifetimes ( due to the lower excitation energies ) , which interestingly decrease more weakly ( @xmath118 ) in a magnetic field than in those other systems .",
    "using our recently developed method , we investigated several 3@xmath12 magnetic adatoms and dimers deposited on noble substrates . our formalism , based on td - dft invoking the adiabatic approximation for the exchange and correlation kernel , demonstrated the origin of the lifetime and of the energy - shifts of the spin - excitation signature .",
    "indeed , these main characteristics of the spin - excitations are determined by the electronic structure and can be extracted from the dynamical transverse ks susceptibility of the investigated materials .",
    "the latter quantity describes electron - hole excitations within td - dft .",
    "for instance , its imaginary part provides the density of electron - hole excitations .",
    "we have demonstrated that the properties of the excitations spectra depend dramatically on the chemical nature of the adsorbates , their neighborhood and the substrates . in general ,",
    "good agreement is found with the experimental measurements performed by ists . in the near future ,",
    "we plan to extend our formalism by including spin - orbit coupling in a self - consistent manner as well as by evaluating the interactions between electrons and the spin - excitations which would allow to evaluate the impact on the electronic structure .",
