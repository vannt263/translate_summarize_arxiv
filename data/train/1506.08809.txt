    "we have set the mass @xmath5 .",

    "the two hamiltonians are intertwined ; _ i.e. _ , @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "this leads to the following isospectrality relationships among their eigenvalues and eigenfunctions for all integer @xmath16 : @xmath17 @xmath18 eq . ( [ isospectrality ] ) implies that if somehow we knew the eigenvalues and eigenstates of the hamiltonian @xmath1 , we would automatically know the same for the hamiltonian @xmath19 , and vice - versa .",
    "we can go no further unless we know the spectrum for one of the potentials _ a priori_. however , if the superpotential @xmath20 obeys the following  shape invariance condition \" @xcite , @xmath21 the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions for both hamiltonians can be determined separately . in this letter",
    "we consider the case of translational or additive shape invariance : @xmath22 . from eq .",
    "( [ sic1 ] ) it follows that for a shape invariant system the partner hamiltonians @xmath23 and @xmath24 differ only by values of parameter @xmath25 and additive constants @xmath26 .",
    "the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of a shape invariant system are then given by @xcite @xmath27 and @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the solution of @xmath30 and @xmath31 is the normalization constant .",

    "although this formalism has been checked for consistency with already known superpotentials @xcite , it has not been used to generate a new superpotential . in this letter",
    "we employ it to generate an extension of the morse superpotential .",
    "this extended superpotential exhibits properties that are qualitatively different from those previously discovered .",
    "it has different asymptotic values than morse and it contains free parameters .",
    "we first consider conventional superpotentials that do not have an intrinsic dependence on @xmath0 .",

    "each of these extended superpotentials is isospectral with one of the conventional superpotentials listed in table [ table1 ] .    to determine the differential equations obeyed by extended superpotentials , we expand the superpotentials in powers of @xmath0 .",
    "i.e. , we define @xmath39 since @xmath40 and @xmath41 , this power series yields @xmath42 @xmath43 and @xmath44 we then substitute these into eq . ( [ sic1 ] ) and demand that the equation hold for any value of @xmath0 .",
