    "dynamical systems subject to random abrupt changes , such as manufacturing systems , networked control systems , economics and finance _ etc_. , can be modelled adequately by random jump linear systems ( rjlss ) .",
    "rjlss are a particular kind of stochastic switching systems , which consists of a set of linear systems , also called multiple modes , and the switching among them is governed by a random jump process .",
    "a notable class of rjlss is markov jump linear system ( mjls ) in which the underlying random jump process is a finite state markov chain ( or a finite state markov process ) .",
    "many important results related to stability , control , and applications of such systems have been investigated in the literature , for instance in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite etc .",
    "almost all the works related to mjlss assume that the underlying random jump process is time - homogeneous / time - inhomogeneous markov , which is a restrictive assumption .    in this article",
    ", we deal with a class of rjlss in which the evolutions of the random jump process depends on the state variable , and are referred to as _ state - dependent jump linear systems _",
    "( sdjls ) . in the following ,",
    "we list some motivations for sdjls modelling of dynamical systems . in the analysis of random breakdown of components , the age , wear , and accumulated stress of a component affect its failure rate , for instance .",
    "thus , it can be assumed that the failure rate of a component is dependent on state of the component at age @xmath0 @xcite , where the state variable may be an amount of wear , stress etc . as an another instance , in @xcite , a state - dependent markov process was utilized to describe the random break down of cylinder lines in a heavy - duty marine diesel engine .",
    "also , we can examine a stock market with situations : up and down , and the transitions between the situations can be dependent on state of the market , where the state variable may be general mood of investors and current economy etc . also , a state - dependent regime switching model was considered in @xcite to model financial time series .",
    "one can find other instances or examples of sdjls modelling in the literature .",
    "the studies of stability and control of sdjlss have been scanty in the literature .",
    "a study of hybrid switching diffusion processes , a kind of continuous - time state - dependent jump non - linear systems with diffusion , was considered in @xcite by treating existence , uniqueness , stability of the solutions etc . for rjlss , a state and control dependent random jump process was considered in @xcite , where the authors used stochastic maximum principle to obtain optimal control for a given objective function .",
    "sdjls modelling of flexible manufacturing system was proposed in @xcite , and dynamic programming is used to obtain an optimal input which minimizes the mentioned cost .",
    "a state - dependent jump diffusion modelling of a production plant was considered in @xcite to obtain an optimal control . in the sequel",
    ", we bring back the attention to the main ingredients of the problem that we address in this article .    in this article",
    ", we consider that the sdjls is affected by possibly unbounded stochastic disturbances , and the perfect state information is assumed .",
    "we also deal with constraints on different variables of the system that is inherent in all practical systems .",
    "model predictive control ( mpc ) , also called receding horizon control ( rhc ) , is an effective control algorithm that has a great potential to handle input and/or state constraints , for problems across different disciplines .",
    "mpc is a form of control in which the current input is obtained at each sampling time by solving on - line a finite horizon optimal control problem in the presence of constraints , using the current information and the predicted information over the finite horizon .",
    "normally more than one input is obtained at the current sampling time , however , only the first controller input will be implemented to the plant . at the next sampling time , these actions will be repeated , that is why the mpc is also called the rhc .",
    "one can refer to @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite etc .",
    ", for classic contributions in the mpc literature . in the context of rjlss , of late , the rhc scheme has been extended to discrete - time mjlss . for discrete - time mjlss ,",
    "the rhc with hard symmetric constraints and bounded uncertainties in system parameters was dealt by @xcite , @xcite , where the constraints and the objective function were posed as sufficient conditions in terms of linear matrix inequalities ( lmis ) to be solved at each sampling time ; for the similar case without constraints , the rhc was addressed by @xcite following the similar approach .",
    "also , for unconstrained state and control input , optimality of the rhc was addressed via dynamic programming @xcite , variational methods @xcite , solving riccati equations @xcite , etc .",
    "one major issue in the presence of unbounded disturbances is that the rhc can not necessarily guarantee the satisfaction of constraints .",
    "for instance , an additive unbounded disturbance eventually drives the state variable outside any bounded limits , no matter how arbitrarily large they may be .",
    "a possible alternative is to consider the satisfaction of constraints in stochastic manner , which allow occasional constraint violations . in this direction , recent approaches @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and the references therein treat the rhc of discrete - time linear systems with stochastic constraints . for discrete - time mjlss , in case of perfect state availability , a linear quadratic regulator problem with second moment constraints was considered in @xcite , where the entire problem was converted to a set of lmis .",
    "however , to the best of the authors knowledge , the rhc of discrete - time sdjlss with probabilistic constraints has not been examined .    in this article , we address a one - step rhc of discrete - time sdjlss with additive gaussian process noise ( its distribution has an unbounded support ) , and probabilistic state constraints under perfect state availability .",
    "we would like to highlight several challenges in our problem set - up .",
    "first , in the presence of additive process noise with unbounded support , it impossible to guarantee hard bounds on the state , and also on the linear state - feedback control .",
    "second , one needs to pre - stabilize the system before addressing the rhc problem .",
    "third , one needs to obtain a tractable representation of the rhc problem in the presence of probabilistic constraints",
    ".    our approach along with main contributions in this article can be listed as follows . in our problem set - up , we consider the control to have a linear state - feedback and an offset term @xcite , @xcite , where linear state - feedback gains are computed off - line for pre - stabilization and admissible offset terms are computed on - line to solve the rhc problem . in the presence of unbounded process noise , it is not possible to ensure hard bounds on the state and the control variables that follow state - feedback law , thus we consider the state variable to be probabilistically constrained and the control to be unconstrained , except for the offset term",
    ". using inverse cumulative distribution function , we convert the probabilistic state constraints to deterministic constraints and the overall rhc problem is replaced by a tractable deterministic rhc problem .",
    "to summarize , for sdjls subject to possibly unbounded random disturbances and probabilistic state constraints , our contributions in this article are :    * pre - stabilizing the system state by a state - feedback controller in means square sense , * implementing a one - step rhc scheme on - line with probabilistic constraints on the state variable , which are converted to deterministic constraints .    for illustration , we apply our approach to a macroeconomic situation .",

    "we set @xmath38 the @xmath26-algebra generated by @xmath39 . regarding the different stochastic processes ,",

    "we consider the set @xmath53 as a polyhedral intersection of finite constraints on the state variable and @xmath54 as @xmath55 .",

    "however , the state variable being affected by gaussian noise that is unbounded in distribution , it is impossible to constrain the state to the set @xmath59 at all times .",

    "the reason is as follows . from ( [ sys : djls_noise ] ) , the state @xmath52 in ( [ eq : stabilization_input ] ) is a function of gaussian noise .",
    "since gaussian distribution has an unbounded support , we can not assume the a priori boundedness of @xmath72 ( [ eq : stabilization_input ] ) .",
