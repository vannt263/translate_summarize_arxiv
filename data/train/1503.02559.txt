    "we consider the heat going from the system to the bath to be positive and that going from the bath to the system to be negative .",
    "similarly , the work done on the system is taken as positive and that done by the system is considered negative .",
    "we have also studied fluctuation in stochastic efficiency / coefficient of performance ( cop ) of engine / refrigerator and have shown that their fluctuations dominate the mean values .",

    "there are examples of smooth protocols where one changes the temperature of the bath and the stiffness of the harmonic trap smoothly over time such that at long time limit the phase space volume remains constant , providing no average heat dissipation and consequently establishing the adiabatic steps@xcite . in this paper",
    "we restrict ourselves to this carnot - type refrigerator protocol .",

    "quasistatic behavior of our system serves as an important benchmark for the simulation as it can also be obtained analytically .    for any machine , quantification of its performance ( e.g. , efficiency )",

    "inset : the positive tail of the distribution behaves as a power law with exponent -2.155 @xmath150 0.014 ( slope of the straight line).,width=226 ]",
    "we will conclude by focusing on the main results to point out the crucial differences between macro and micro refrigerators . in the macro - world",
    ", idealized refrigerator is like an engine running backward in time , i.e. , using the work to extract heat from the cold bath and dumping the heat at hot bath .",
    "we have shown that such a simple picture is not valid for single particle heat engine at nano - scale .",
    "the engine running in a reverse order may produce refrigerator , stochastic heater of type i and ii as well as unreliable heat engine . for our model of study , fluctuations in stochastic cop and efficiency dominate their mean values even in the quasistatic case .",
    "this implies that in such a situation mean is not a good physical variable and one must study the behaviour of full probability distributions which in all our cases contain power law behaviour in their tails with varied exponents .",
    "cop and efficiency may exceed carnot bound . however , averaged cop and efficiency , as defined here , are bounded by the carnot value .",
    "this can readily be shown by fluctuation theorem of heat engines .    in every cycle , a macro thermal machine under refrigerating protocol acts as a refrigerator .",
    "this is not true for micro refrigerators .",
    "we know that the trajectory dependent work , heat and cop are randomly distributed variables over the cycles of a micro refrigerator",
    ". the cycle time can be large or small , but there will always be a considerable number of cycles where the system will not run as a refrigerator due to fluctuations of these thermodynamic variables .",
    "this makes the micro refrigerator unreliable in comparison to macro refrigerators .",
    "this reliability , quantified as a fraction of cycles running as a refrigerator , increases as we increase the cycle time @xmath8 .",
    "the obtained heat engine is most unreliable .",
    "the phase diagram and thermodynamic quantities describing the micro refrigerators as well as the micro heat engines are crucially protocol dependent .",
    "we have noticed in our other studies ( will be published elsewhere ) , that the micro refrigerators / heat engines , running under stirling protocol ( which is very similar to carnot protocol but devoid of the adiabatic jumps ) , though produce qualitatively similar phase diagrams as carnot - protocol , are less fluctuating in large cycle time limit .",
    "moreover , only in the underdamped case in a small parameter space heat engine operation is possible .",
    "the adiabatic jumps are key players behind the unreliability of micro heat engines in @xcite or refrigerators described in earlier sections . only in the overdamped quasistatic limit",
    "we have shown that for our given specific protocol , refrigerator can work in a reversible mode of operation provided @xmath167 .",
    "this clear from zero entropy production for this case ( e.g. , see fig .",
    "[ ow ] d ) .",
    "power output is found to be an useful optimization criterion for finite time heat engines . on the other hand , many optimization criteria were proposed in case of refrigerator . widely used target function was introduced in @xcite by giving equal footing for cop and cooling rate , known as @xmath168-criterion @xcite . in view of new findings in brownian refrigerators , it will be of immense interest to study these quantities in our system .",
    "it may be noted that our studied engine or refrigerator do not reach carnot limit in the efficiency / cop in the quasistatic regime .",
    "the engine is not a microscopic version of carnot engine .",
    "there are other engines which reproduces carnot limit for efficiency in the quasistatic regime @xcite .",
    "studies on differences in these two types of engines will be useful .",
