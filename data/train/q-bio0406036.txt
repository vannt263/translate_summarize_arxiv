    "while the structure of the nucleosome core particle ( the protein spool with the 2 turns of wrapped dna ) is known up to atomistic resolution @xcite there is still considerable controversy about the details of the structure of the 30-nm chromatin fiber @xcite .",
    "there are essentially two competing classes of models : ( i ) the solenoid models @xcite and ( ii ) the zig - zag- or crossed - linker models @xcite . in the solenoid models",
    "one assumes that the successive nucleosomes form a helix with the normal vectors of the protein spools ( the axis of the superhelical wrapping path of the dna ) being perpendicular to the solenoidal axis .",
    "the entry - exit sides of the nucleosomal dna face inward towards the solenoidal axis and the linker dna must bend in order to connect neighboring nucleosomes .",
    "in contrast the linker dna in crossed - linker models remains straight and connects nucleosomes that sit on opposite sides of the fiber .",

    "the location of the kink corresponds to the point where the two diagonals cross each other .",
    "closer inspection of the histograms shows that the hairpin arms outside the kink region are partially interdigitated but not strongly perturbed .",
    "however the effect is strong enough to effectively prevent any possibility of sliding of the two arms with respect to each other on the time scale of our simulations .",
    "therefore a hairpin structure , once formed , can be very stable with a frozen in position of the turning point . with respect to the fiber structure at the turning point , fig .",
    "[ fig : contmat](d ) in particular shows disruptions of the internal order of the nucleosomes : the diagonals @xmath128 are broken at that position , presumably due to broken contacts of nucleosomes located at the outside of the turning point .",
    "this observation supports the picture of a localized kink defect .",
    "toroidal or racquet - like condensates become unstable under the influence of a stretching force , if the applied force @xmath98 exceeds a value on the order of the attractive energy per unit length , @xmath108 . neglecting",
    "kinetic barriers ( for a discussion of dna unwrapping from nucleosomes or toroidal aggregates see @xcite ) , the corresponding force plateau in the force - extension curves for chromatin fibers should be observed for forces of @xmath131pn . in order to experimentally distinguish this scenario from local structural changes which are expected to occur at similar force levels @xcite , one should plot force-_relative _ extension curves for fibers reconstituted under similar conditions on dna strands of different length . in the case of local structural changes ,",
    "the obtained curves coincide , while for a global decondensation the size of the unperturbed state is of order @xmath111 independently of the fiber length .      as a final point",
    "we discuss possible biological implications of fiber stiffening and hairpin formation .",
    "both effects are associated with characteristic length scales ; fiber stiffening with a persistence length on the order of 300 nm , hairpin formation with a condensation length on the order of a few tens of nm .",
    "we note again that the biochemical control of the effective interaction between nucleosomes is essential for the condensation and decondensation of chromosomes during the cell cycle @xcite .",
    "there is indirect experimental evidence for the formation of chromosomal dna loops having a size of about 50 kilobases @xcite ( corresponding to about 250 nucleosomes ) , e.g. from the comparison of separation patterns of excised large dna fragments by pulsed field electrophoresis with the patterns obtained by dna cleavage by topoisomerase ii of the nuclear matrix of the cell @xcite . using a nucleosome density of 6/(11 nm )",
    ", 250 nucleosomes correspond to a fiber length of 460 nm , i.e. about twice the persistence length of 240 nm found in our simulations .    there are two scenarios linking the persistence length to the loop size ; both are based on the observation that the free energy cost for the formation of a loop is smallest for semi - flexible chains with a length of about twice the persistence length . for shorter chains the bending energy is high , for larger chains",
    "the entropy of chain conformations counteracts loops formation . in the first ( equilibrium ) scenario , the chromatin fiber loops around strongly attracting organizing centers .",
    "spherical centers could induce the formation of rosette structures @xcite .",
    "filamentous organizing centers could lead to structures resembling cartoons of chromosomes often found in biological textbooks , cf .",
    "e.g. ref .",
    "the second scenario which links the persistence length to the loop size is closer to what we observed in our simulations : if the attraction between fibers is strong enough to prevent structural reorganization after the two halves of the fiber have tightly closed the gap between the point of first contact and the hairpin defect , then loops with the typical size of the fiber persistence length are preferred for kinetic reasons .",
    "hairpins have indeed been observed in cryo - em pictures of chromatin fibers in the presence of ment @xcite , a protein that is involved in the formation of dense , transcriptionally inert sections of chromatin , the so - called heterochromatin .",
    "if , on the other hand , structural reorganization is still possible in collapsed fibers , then the size of the aggregates should be controlled by the smaller condensation length and not by the persistence length of the 30-nm fiber .",
    "fibers with diameters ranging between 60 to 130 nm diameter have indeed been observed in mitotic and in g1 chromosomes and are called chromonema fibers @xcite , cf . also ref .",
    "however , the folding of 30-nm fibers into superfibers with a diameter on the order of the condensation length requires a mechanism that prevents the formation of globular aggregates .",
    "we have used computer simulations of model chromatin fibers to investigate the influence of excluded volume and attractive interactions between the nucleosomes on the large - scale structure and elasticity of the 30 nm chromatin fiber .",
    "our results shed light ( _ i _ ) on the discrepancy between the theoretically expected and the observed persistence length of 200 - 300 nm as well as ( _ ii _ ) on the somewhat counterintuitive observation that such fibers nevertheless seem to be able to curl up into chromonema fibers with diameters of 60 - 130 nm .",
    "our results clearly show that the stiffness of dense fibers is dominated by excluded volume interactions between nucleosomes .",
    "the observed persistence lengths exceed estimates based on the linker backbone elasticity by one order of magnitude . with respect to internucleosomal attraction",
    "we have concentrated on generic , non - local aspects of fiber condensation .",
    "the 2 pn force plateau observed in our simulations reflects a structural feature _ beyond _ the 30 nm fiber : the opening of a hairpin .",
    "our results suggest that aligned ( anti- ) parallel fibers are only weakly perturbed , but that the fiber geometry is locally disrupted at the @xmath132 turning point .",
    "the crucial point is that the energetic cost of this localized defect is considerably smaller than for a smoothly bending semi - flexible filament with the same bending persistence length as chromatin .",
    "this effect could be important for an understanding of chromatin folding in chromosomes .",
