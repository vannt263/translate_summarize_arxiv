    "in the realm of quantum information , entanglement is a universal resource . some striking applications of entanglement have been proposed , such as quantum dense coding @xcite , quantum teleportation @xcite , quantum cryptography @xcite , etc . generally , entangled states are used as a medium to transfer quantum information in quantum communication protocols .",
    "moreover , they are used to speed up computation in quantum algorithms . while bipartite entanglement is well understood , multipartite entanglement is still under extensive exploration . for tripartite",
    "entangled quantum system , it falls into two classes of irreducible entanglement @xcite .",
    "recently , briegel _",
    "et al_. @xcite introduced a class of _ n_-qubit entangled states , _",
    "i.e_. , the cluster states , which have some special properties .",
    "the cluster states share the properties both of the ghz- and of w - class entangled states .",
    "but they still have some unique properties , _",
    "e g_. , they have a large persistency of entanglement , that is , they ( in the case of @xmath0 ) are harder to be destroyed by local operations than ghz - class states .",
    "in addition , they can be regarded as a resource for other multi - qubit entangled states .",
    "thus the cluster states become an important resource in many branches of physics , especially in quantum information . therefore , a number of applications using cluster states in quantum computation have been proposed @xcite .",
    "the generation of the cluster states attracted much attention . recently",
    "et al_. proposed probabilistic schemes for generating the cluster states of four distant trapped atoms in leaky cavities @xcite , generating the cluster states in resonant microwave cavities @xcite and generating the cluster states in linear optics system @xcite .",
    "et al_. proposed a protocol for generation of the cluster states using spatially separated matter qubits and single - photon interference effects @xcite and so on @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , cavity quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) technique is a promising candidate for realizing the quantum processors .",
    "meanwhile , much attention was paid to atomic ensembles in realizing the scalable long - distance quantum communication @xcite .",
    "the schemes based on atomic ensembles have some peculiar advantages compared with the schemes of quantum information processing by the control of single particles .",
    "firstly , the schemes have inherent fault tolerance function and are robust to realistic noise and imperfections .",
    "laser manipulation of atomic ensembles without separately addressing the individual atoms is dominantly easier than the coherent control of single particles .",
    "in addition , atomic ensembles with suitable level structure could have some kinds of collectively enhanced coupling to certain optical mode due to the multi - atom interference effects . due to the above distinct advantages ,",
    "a lot of novel schemes for the generation of quantum entangled states and quantum information processing have been proposed by using atomic ensembles @xcite .",
    "thus in this paper , we propose two schemes for the generation of the cluster states using cavity qed technique and the atomic ensembles .",
    "our cavity qed scheme is different from that in refs @xcite .",
    "the scheme only requires resonant interactions between two atoms and a single - mode cavity .",
    "the interaction time is very short , which is important in view of decoherence .",
    "more important , we consider the cavity decay and atomic spontaneous emission , which is unavoidable in the real process of generation .",
    "the proposal can be used to realize logic gates and directly transfer quantum information from one atom to another one @xcite without using the cavity mode as the memory required in the previous experiment of ref @xcite .",
    "the scheme is very simple and can be generalized to the ion trap system .",
    "but for atomic ensembles scheme , as far as we known , this is the first scheme for the generation of the cluster states .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section ii , we introduce the cavity - qed model for generating a two - atom cluster state with and without cavity decay and atomic spontaneous emission , and then extend the scheme for two - atom cluster state to multi - atom cluster states case .",
    "necessary discussions are also given in the end of the section . in section iii",
    ", we discuss the scheme for generating the cluster states via atomic ensembles and then conclude the section and discuss the feasibility of our scheme .",
    "the conclusions appear in section iv .",
    "in this section , we first use the resonant interaction between two atoms and a single - mode cavity to generate a two - atom cluster state .",
    "three - level atoms are used in this model .",
    "the relevant atomic level structure is shown in fig . [ fig1 ] .",
    "the third level @xmath1 is not affected during the atom - cavity resonant interaction .",
    "thus the hamiltonian of the atom - cavity interaction can be expressed as , in the interaction picture ( assuming @xmath2)@xcite    @xmath3    where @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the coupling strength of the atoms 1 , 2 with the cavity , respectively .",
    "@xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 is the ground state of the atoms , @xmath9 is the excited state of the atoms .",
    "@xmath10 , @xmath11 are the creation and annihilation operators for the cavity mode .",
    "assume that the cavity mode is initially prepared in the vacuum state @xmath12 . in order to generate a two - atom cluster state , we prepare atom 1 in the state @xmath13 and atom 2 in the state @xmath14 .",
    "so the initial state of the system is latexmath:[\\[\\label{2 }        is the ground state , @xmath9 is the excited state .",
    "the cavity mode is resonantly coupled to the @xmath16 transition .",
    "the third level @xmath1 is not affected by the interaction . ]",
    "then we send the two atoms through the vacuum cavity , we can obtain the evolution @xcite    [ 3 ] @xmath17|ge\\rangle_{12}|0\\rangle - i sin(et)|gg\\rangle_{12}|1\\rangle],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath18|i\\rangle_{2},\\ ] ] @xmath19 @xmath20    where @xmath21 . if we choose @xmath22 which can be achieved by choosing coupling strengths and interaction time appropriately .",

    "while in the real processing , the cavity decay and atomic spontaneous emission are unavoidable .",
    "thus the discussion of these is necessary . taking the cavity decay and atomic spontaneous emission into consideration",
    ", the hamiltonian of the atom - cavity interaction can be expressed as ( under the condition that no photon is detected either by the spontaneous emission or by the leakage of a photon through the cavity mirror and assuming @xmath2 ) @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the cavity decay rate and @xmath31 is the atomic spontaneous emission rate .",
    "if we send the atoms 1 and 2 through the vacuum cavity , choose the coupling strengths , interaction time @xmath32 , @xmath33 appropriately and set @xmath34 , and then send the atom 2 through a classical field as in eq .",

    "( 7 ) is @xmath36 and the probability of success is @xmath37 . the fidelity and probability approach perfection .",
    "multi - atom entanglement is a very important source in quantum information processing and quantum computation .",
    "especially the multi - atom cluster states attract many scientific attention recently , and some of their applications have been proposed @xcite .",
    "thus the generation of multi - atom cluster states is vital for the construction of the practical quantum computers .",
    "here , we generalize the above scheme of two - atom cluster state to multi - atom cluster states case .     can emit a forward - scattered stokes photon co - propagating with the laser pulse .",
    "the excitation in the mode @xmath38 can be transferred to optical excitation by applying an anti - pump pulse . ]",
    "we first prepare @xmath39 ( @xmath40 ) atoms in the states    @xmath41    where @xmath42 .",
    "the @xmath43 cavities are all prepared in vacuum states @xmath12 .",
    "so the total state of atoms is @xmath44 ) .",
    "meanwhile , we choose the coupling strengths , interaction time appropriately as in eq .",
    "( [ 4 ] ) . then send atom 2 through a classical field as in eq . ( [ 6 ] ) .",
    "these lead eq .",
    "( [ 11 ] ) to @xmath45 next , we send atoms 2 and 3 through another vacuum cavity . after the same interaction as on atoms 1 and 2 ,",
    "send atom 3 through a classical field as in eq .",
    "( [ 6 ] ) , here , eq . (",
    "[ 12 ] ) becomes @xmath46 from the form of above states , we can conclude if we send two atoms through a vacuum cavity every time and then send one ( the bigger subscript ) of the two atoms through a classical filed , step by step , we can obtain the multi - atom cluster states easily . in other words , firstly we send atoms 1 and 2 through a vacuum cavity , then send atom 2 through a classical field .",
    "secondly , we send atoms 2 and 3 through another vacuum cavity , then send atom 3 through another classical field , @xmath47 .",
    "finally , we send atoms @xmath43 and @xmath39 through the last vacuum cavity , then send atom @xmath39 through a classical field . thus the multi - atom cluster states can be obtained @xmath48 where @xmath49 .    for the case of real processing",
    "( with cavity decay and atomic spontaneous emission ) , we can obtain the cluster state by the same process as in the above ideal case and set @xmath34 .",
    "we can obtain the cluster states @xmath50 while the fidelity of this state relative to the standard multi - atom cluster state in eq .",
    "( 14 ) is @xmath51^{n-1}$ ] and the successful probability of obtaining the multi - atom cluster state is @xmath52 .",
    "it is shown that the successful probability and fidelity both decrease exponentially with the increase of @xmath39 .",
    "next , we briefly consider the feasibility of the current scheme .",
    "the scheme requires two atoms in a vacuum cavity , which have different coupling strengths with the cavity mode .",
    "the coupling depends on the atomic positions : @xmath53 , where @xmath54 is the coupling strength at the cavity center , @xmath55 is the waist of the cavity mode , and @xmath56 is the distance between the atom and the cavity center @xcite .",
    "the condition @xmath32 in our scheme can be satisfied by locating one atom at the center of the cavity and locating the other one at the position @xmath57 . according to the recent experiments with cs atoms trapped in an optical cavity@xcite",
    ", the condition can be obtained .",
    "for the resonant cavity , in order to generate the cluster states successfully , the relationship between the interaction time and the excited atom lifetime should be taken into consideration .",
    "the interaction time should be much shorter than that of atom radiation .",
    "hence , atom with a sufficiently long excited lifetime should be chosen .",
    "for rydberg atom with principal quantum numbers @xmath58 and @xmath59 , the radiative time is @xmath60s . from the analysis in ref @xcite ,",
    "the interaction time is on the order @xmath61s , which is much shorter than the atomic radiative time .",
    "so the condition can be satisfied by choosing rydberg atom .",
    "our scheme requires that two atoms be simultaneously sent through a cavity , otherwise there will be an error .",
    "assume that during the generation of a two - atom cluster state , one atom enters the cavity @xmath62 sooner than another atom , with @xmath63 being the time of each atom staying in the cavity .",
    "we can obtain the fidelity @xmath64 for generation of two - atom cluster state .",
    "obviously in this case the operation is only slightly affected .",
    "furthermore one needs to reach the lamb - dicke regime in order to generate the cluster states successfully . for the initial state of eq .",
    "( [ 2 ] ) , in the lamb - dicke regime , the infidelity caused by the spatial extension of the atomic wave function is about @xmath65 , where @xmath66 is the wave vector of the cavity mode and @xmath11 is the spread of the atomic wave function . setting @xmath67 , we have @xmath68 , where @xmath69 is the wavelength of the cavity mode .",
    "if the atom trajectories cross the cavity with the deviation of less @xmath70 degree from its pre - determined direction , we can ensure the fidelity is about @xmath71 for generation of two - atom cluster state .",
    "while in order to maintain @xmath32 in the process of atomic motion in the cavity , we can choose the parameter of cavity @xmath72 , where @xmath73 and @xmath74 is the length of the cavity .",
    "we can obtain the error is only about @xmath75 . in the these cases ,",
    "we can obtain the fidelity @xmath64 for generation of two - atom cluster state , which is bigger than the case of cavity decay and atomic spontaneous emission in the process of generation .",
    "therefore our scheme is feasible with the current cavity qed technology .",
    "the scheme for generating the cluster states in cavity qed only requires resonant interactions between two atoms and a single - cavity mode .",
    "the interaction time is very short , which is very important in view of decoherence .",
    "for the ideal case , the successful probability and the fidelity are both perfect ( equal to @xmath76 ) . for the real case , the successful probability is @xmath77 and the fidelity is @xmath78 for the two - atom cluster states , while the successful probability and the fidelity for the multi - atom cluster states both decrease exponentially with the increase of @xmath39 .",
    "the scheme is very simple and can be generalized to the ion trap system .",
    "in this section , we first introduce the basic system using in this paper .",
    "atomic ensembles consist of a large number of identical alkali metal atoms .",
    "the relevant level structure of the alkali metal atoms is shown in fig .",
    "@xmath8 is the ground state , @xmath9 is the excited state and @xmath79 , @xmath80 are two metastable states for storing a qubit of information , _ e g. _ , zeeman or hyperfine sublevels . for the three levels @xmath8 , @xmath81 and @xmath82 , which can be coupled via a raman process",
    ", two collective atomic operators can be defined as @xmath83 where @xmath84 , and @xmath85 is the total number of atoms .",
    "@xmath86 are similar to independent bosonic mode operators provided that all the atoms remain in ground state @xmath8 .",
    "the states of the atomic ensemble can be expressed as @xmath87 ( @xmath84 ) after the emission of the single stokes photon in a forward direction , where @xmath88 denotes the ground state of the atomic ensemble .",
    "it is necessary to discuss the realization of controlled - not gate for the generation of cluster states .",
    "the controlled - not gate can be realized via atomic ensembles with the help of raman laser manipulations , beam splitters , and single - photon detections .",
    "realization of bell - basis measurement and generation of tripartite ghz states is important for realization of controlled - not gate .",
    "bell - basis measurement can be realized using the setup in fig .",
    "the four bell states of the system are @xmath89 and @xmath90 .",
    "we can use the setup to achieve the task , as shown in fig .",
    "firstly , we apply anti - pump laser pulses to the two atomic ensembles @xmath91 and @xmath92 to transfer their @xmath38 excitations to optical excitations , and detect the anti - stokes photons by detectors @xmath931 and @xmath932 .",
    "if only detector @xmath931 ( or @xmath932 ) clicks , we will apply single - qubit rotations to both ensembles to rotate their @xmath94 modes to @xmath38 modes by shinning @xmath95 length raman pulses or radio - frequency pulses on the two ensembles @xmath96 and @xmath97 .",
    "then we apply anti - pump laser pulses to two atomic ensembles @xmath96 and @xmath97 again , and detect anti - stokes photons by @xmath931 and @xmath932 .",
    "now , there are two different results of detection : ( 1 ) if detector @xmath931 ( or @xmath932 ) clicks ( one detector clicks twice in the two detections ) , post - select the cases that each ensemble has only one excitation , atomic ensembles @xmath96 and @xmath97 are projected into @xmath98 ; ( 2)if @xmath932 ( or @xmath931 ) clicks ( detectors @xmath931 and @xmath932 click respectively in the two detections ) , post - select the cases that each ensemble has only one excitation , atomic ensembles @xmath96 and @xmath97 are projected into @xmath99 .",
    "obviously , if we add single - qubit rotations in the above process , we can realize the projection of @xmath100 by post - selecting sense .",
    "tripartite ghz states can be prepared using the protocol of ref @xcite with atomic ensembles .",
    "firstly , atomic ensembles 1 and 2 can be prepared in the state @xmath101 as in ref @xcite .",
    "then we can omit @xmath102 by the way in @xcite and perform a single - qubit rotation on atomic ensemble 2 .",
    "the state of atomic ensembles 1 and 2 becomes @xmath103 .",
    "secondly , we prepare the atomic ensembles 2 , 3 and 3 , 1 in the states @xmath104 and @xmath105 .",

    "firstly , we apply hadamard transformations on atomic ensembles 1 , 2 and 3 respectively , and then make a bell - basis measurement on atomic ensembles 3 and 4",

    ". we can transform state ( [ 25b ] ) to state ( [ 25a ] ) by single - qubit rotations .",

    "next , we discuss the generation of bipartite cluster state . the atomic ensembles 1 and 2",
    "are initially prepared in the state @xmath125 using raman pulses .",
    "all the single - qubit transformation can be achieved by laser pulses in atomic ensembles . secondly",
    ", we perform a single - qubit operation on atomic ensemble 1    @xmath126    then , we perform a controlled - not transformation on the two atomic ensembles , where atomic ensemble 1 serving as control qubit and atomic ensemble 2 as target qubit . now",

    "the cluster states ( @xmath132 ) can be also generated without controlled - not transformation @xcite .",
    "however , for the generation of the multipartite cluster states , using the proposals of ref .",
    "@xcite are very hard , while , it can be realized by the above method with controlled - not transformations , as shown below .    out of question , for the generation of arbitrary @xmath39-particle cluster state ( @xmath40 )",
    ", we can use the single - qubit operations and controlled - not transformations to achieve the task perfectly . here , we discuss the process in detail .",
    "firstly , we prepare @xmath39 atomic ensembles , which are all in the states @xmath133 ( @xmath134 ) .",
    "so the state of the whole system is @xmath135 secondly , we perform appropriately transformations as the above process on atomic ensembles 1 and 2 ( eq.([17])-([20 ] ) ) , which lead the initial state to @xmath136 then , we perform the same transformations on atomic ensembles 2 and 3 as atomic ensembles 1 and 2 . we can obtain the result @xmath137    in a word , if we perform the transformations of eq .",
    "( [ 17])-([20 ] ) on atomic ensembles 1 and 2 , then on atomic ensembles 2 and 3 , up to on atomic ensembles @xmath43 and @xmath39 , we will obtain the perfect multipartite cluster states    @xmath138    where @xmath139 .",
    "we briefly discuss the feasibility of the current scheme .",
    "if we want to generate a high - fidelity entangled state about @xmath140 ensembles , a time @xmath141 will be needed by choosing other parameters appropriately , which has been proved @xcite .",
    "with such a short preparation time @xmath142 , the noise that we have not included is negligible , such as the nonstationary phase drift induced by the pumping phase or by the optical channel .",
    "as long as the number @xmath143 of the ensembles is not huge , we also can safely neglect the single - bit rotation error ( below @xmath144 with the use of accurate polarization techniques for zeeman sublevels @xcite ) and the dark count probability of single - photon detectors ( about @xmath145 in a typical detection time window @xmath70 @xmath146 @xcite ) .",
    "thus it seems reasonable to generate cluster states over tens of ensembles with the current technology .",
    "furthermore , the scaling can be made polynomial by dividing the whole preparation process into small steps , checking in each steps and repeating these steps instead of the whole process in case it fails .",

    "<S> we propose two schemes for the generation of the cluster states . </S>",
    "<S> one is based on cavity quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) techniques . </S>",
    "<S> the scheme only requires resonant interactions between two atoms and a single - mode cavity . </S>",
    "<S> the interaction time is very short , which is important in view of decoherence . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we also discuss the cavity decay and atomic spontaneous emission case . </S>",
    "<S> the other is based on atomic ensembles . </S>",
    "<S> the scheme has inherent fault tolerance function and is robust to realistic noise and imperfections . </S>",
    "<S> all the facilities used in our schemes are well within the current technology . </S>"
