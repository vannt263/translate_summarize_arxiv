    "the chiral condensate seems to be of utmost importance as candidate of an order parameter of chiral symmetry which is spontaneously and explicitly broken in nature ( vacuum ) .",
    "the approach to restored chiral symmetry in a dense and/or hot medium may be signaled by a modified hadron spectrum . in particular , the spectral strengths of hadrons are expected to become modified when embedded in strongly interacting matter . while for vector mesons and strange mesons fairly exhaustive studies have been performed in this context ,",
    "charm degrees of freedom require further investigations .",
    "the charmed hadron spectroscopy in @xmath0 and @xmath3 collisions will be addressed by two major experimental set - up s of fair , cbm and panda . with this motivation",
    "we report in section [ sct2 ] our results of a qcd sum rule analysis of spectral changes of pseudo - scalar open charm @xmath4 mesons in cold nuclear matter .    in section [ sct3 ]",
    "we consider differences of spectral strengths of chiral partners thus exposing the role of the chiral condensate also for charm .",
    "since , within the qcd sum rule approach which we employ here , the temperature and density dependence of qcd condensates is important , we present in section [ sct4 ] a first explorative study of two gluon condensates near the deconfinement temperature but at finite net baryon density .",

    "we are here interested in an exploration of spectral changes .",
    "quite general , one may consider the moments @xmath12 which allow to define the quantities @xmath13 which may be interpreted , e.g.  by exploiting the pole + continuum ansatz , as mass splitting ( actually , @xmath14 is half of the splitting ) and mass shift of @xmath4 and @xmath15 . in line with a similar pattern in the strange meson sector ,",
    "one expects shifts of spectral strengths by an ambient nuclear medium as exhibited schematically in figure [ fig1 ] .",

    "a discussion of finite width effects always meets the problem of additional parameters which have to be fixed by the same set of equations .",
    "hence , one only is able to give the mass of the particle ( i.e.  the center of gravity of the spectral function ) as a function of its width . in the case of @xmath4 mesons the widths for particle ( @xmath23 ) and anti - particle ( @xmath24 )",

    "our results for the differences of vector ( v )  axial - vector ( a ) and the scalar ( s )  pseudo - scalar ( p ) correlators in case of mesons with one light quark , @xmath33 , and one heavy quark , @xmath34 , are summarized in table [ tbl1 ] .",

    "[ tbl1 ] , also the first spectral difference moments for mesons consisting of two light quarks , @xmath48 are listed for @xmath35 .",
    "in particular , one recognizes for heavy - light mesons that the differences between chiral partners are driven by the chiral condensate @xmath49 in conjunction with the heavy quark mass @xmath50 .",
    "furthermore , in case of light - light vector mesons the first condensate which qualifies as an order parameter is a certain combination of four - quark condensates for the @xmath42st moment in next - to - leading order of the strong coupling @xmath51 , whereas the chiral condensate can only occur in lowest order of @xmath51 and in the @xmath39th moment of the spectral differences if one of the quarks is heavy . in this respect ,",
    "one may identify such heavy - light quark bound states ( hadrons ) as useful probes for chiral restoration to be linked with the density dependence of the chiral condensate @xmath52 .",
    "according to the consideration in @xcite one may relate the gluon condensate at finite temperature to the qcd trace - anomaly for @xmath54 and the equation of state : @xmath55 whereas contributions from light quarks to ( [ ggvac ] ) have been omitted in a first step , as we focus on the continuation to finite densities .",

    "the condensate ( [ ggmed ] ) seems not to be affected by such a choice . at finite densities ,",
    "the gluon condensate for @xmath64 drops significantly due to the non - vanishing chemical potential .",
    "the symmetric and traceless gluon condensate @xmath65 is much less influenced by density effects .",
    "these effects have to be studied in detail for the @xmath66 , which depends essentially on the considered gluon condensates @xcite .    as mentioned above",
    ", finite current quark masses modify the trace of the energy momentum tensor to @xcite ( @xmath54 ) @xmath67 where higher order @xmath51 terms have been neglected .",
    "( the contributions of heavy quarks can be absorbed into the first term by using the heavy - quark mass - expansion . ) a precise analysis would hence also have to include the density and temperature dependence of the quark condensates .",
    "however , as the chiral condensate is supposed to vanish above @xmath2 due to the restoration of chiral symmetry , it is justified to neglect their influence on the gluon condensates in ( [ ggvac ] ) and ( [ ggmed ] ) .",
    "furthermore , if light quark contributions can be neglected in specific qcd sum rule evaluations , it is consistent with neglecting such terms in ( [ ggvac ] ) and ( [ ggmed ] ) , too .",
    "this offers the avenue towards the evaluation of qcd sum rules near / above the deconfinement transition at non - zero baryon densities .",
    "in summary we analyzed in - medium modifications of @xmath4 mesons in cold nuclear matter and find good prospects for an experimental verification , as the spectral strengths of @xmath4 and @xmath16 may be displaced by about 60 mev at saturation density .",
    "the key here is the amplification of the chiral condensate by the heavy charm - quark mass .",
    "we also had a glimpse on an extension of the celebrated weinberg and kapusta - shuryak sum rules for chiral partners and considered , furthermore , the determination of the gluon condensate via the qcd trace anomaly in the deconfinement region at non - zero baryon density .",
