    "physical processes that occur during reionization are numerous and complex .",
    "nevertheless , ionization of neutral gas ( hydrogen & helium ) and heating of the inter - galactic medium ( igm ) can be considered the two primary influences of radiating objects during reionization .",
    "currently , the most promising `` direct '' probe of reionization is the redshifted 21-cm radiation emanating from neutral hydrogen during the epoch of reionization ( eor ) , which are to be measured using upcoming telescopes like lofar , mwa , paper and 21cma . the intensity of the observed 21-cm radiation depends on the ratio between the number density of electrons in the hyperfine states in the ground state of a neutral hydrogen atom .",
    "this ratio is normally expressed in terms of the so - called 21-cm spin temperature , @xmath1 . at the onset of the formation of the first reionizing objects the spin temperature is equal to the cmb temperature since at these redshifts",
    "the ratio between excited and ground hyperfine state electrons is completely determined by the cmb . however , as the number of ionizing sources increases , @xmath1 starts departing from @xmath7 ; slowly at the beginning , then rapidly approaching values larger than @xmath7 .",
    "this evolution is typically ignored in most previous studies of reionization which assumes @xmath8 at all times @xcite .",
    "recently , @xcite have relaxed this assumption on @xmath1 at the dawn of reionization and explored its impact on the brightness temperature .",
    "they found a considerable considerable deviation from assuming @xmath9 at the beginning of reionization . towards the end of reionization",
    "though , this assumption holds ground .",
    "but , in order to track the evolution of @xmath1 accurately , like in @xcite , it is necessary to perform a detailed 3-d ly@xmath5 radiative transfer calculation .",
    "the ly@xmath5 photons undergo a large number ( @xmath10 ) of scatterings even in a marginally neutral medium before it is sufficiently off line - centre to `` free stream '' .",
    "the scattering angle after each encounter is completely random and therefore the radiative transfer is often done in a monte carlo sense @xcite to capture this random nature of ly@xmath5 scatterings .",
    "unfortunately these monte carlo radiative transfer schemes are computationally very expensive , especially if we need to simulate large fields of view necessary to generate mock data sets for next generation radio telescopes . in order to circumvent the need to perform such computer - intensive calculations to obtain @xmath1",
    ", we develop an algorithm along the lines of bears @xcite as an approximation . in this paper",
    "we present an algorithm that follows the decoupling of @xmath1 from @xmath7 owing to ly@xmath5 photons , which couples the spin temperature to the colour / kinetic temperature via the wouthuysen - field effect @xcite .",
    "collisional excitation and heating caused by secondary electrons resulting from hard x - ray radiation are also included .",
    "the dominant source of ly@xmath5 flux is the background created by the redshifting of photons in the lyman band into ly@xmath5 .",
    "these photons are blueward of ly@xmath5 and is injected into ly@xmath5 at some distance away from the source .",
    "the amount of intrinsic ly@xmath5 , ionizing and `` heating '' photons is a function of the source spectral energy distribution ( sed ) .",
    "thus the evolution of the spin temperature critically depends on the source of reionization .",
    "different reionization sources manifest themselves by influencing the igm in markedly different ways .",
    "for example , deficiency of hard photons in the seds of `` first stars '' , limit the extent to which they heat the igm @xcite , while miniquasars ( or miniqsos , characterized by central black hole masses less than a million solar ) , abundant in x - ray photons , cause considerable heating @xcite .",
    "ionization profiles similarly have their characteristic source - dependent behavior .",
    "although the question on which sources did the bulk of the reionization is up for debate , it is conceivable from observations of the local universe up to redshifts around 6.5 , that sources of reionization could have been a mixture of both stellar and quasar kinds ( their respective roles again are uncertain ) .",
    "implementing radiative transfer that include both ionizing and hard x - ray photons has been difficult and as a result most 3-d radiative transfer schemes restrict themselves to ionization due to stars @xcite . in @xcite , a `` semi '' hybrid model of stars and miniqsos , like",
    "the one hinted above , has been used albeit in sequential order instead of a simultaneous implementation .",
    "that is , pre - ionization due to miniqsos was invoked between @xmath11 , after which , stars reionize the universe at redshift 7 .",
    "we in this paper would like to address the issue of simulating the propagation of both the uv and hard x - ray photons , exactly in 1-d and as approximation in 3-d .",
    "the focus of this paper is therefore to introduce the algorithm that is used to implement igm heating in bears along with the procedure to estimate the spin temperature of the igm . as an application of this technique",
    "we explore the effects of heating due to miniqsos , stars and , for the first time , a mixed `` hybrid population '' .",
    "subsequently , we provide quantitative and qualitative analysis of the differences in the 21-cm eor signal with and without the usual assumption of @xmath1 being always decoupled from @xmath7 .    the paper is organized as follows ;  [ sec : simulations ] describes briefly the n - body and 1-d radiative transfer codes used . in ",
    "[ sec : bearheat ] we describe the adaptation of bears to include @xmath6 , followed by the calculation of the @xmath1 and @xmath3 within the simulation box .",
    "bears is then applied to three different scenarios of reionization in  [ sec : applications ] , _",
    "viz_. , ( 1 ) the primary source being stars , ( 2 ) miniqsos and ( 3 ) a hybrid population of stars and miniqsos .",
    "subsequently , observational cubes of @xmath12 are generated for each of these scenarios and its properties discussed . in ",
    "[ sec : stats ] we provide statistics on the simulated boxes and interpret the finding mainly from the point of view of the differences in @xmath3 with and without the usual assumption that @xmath1 is decoupled from @xmath13 .",
    "we also compare our work to that of @xcite in the same section .",
    "conclusions and discussions of the results are presented in  [ sec : conclusion ] , along with a mention of a few topics that can be addressed using the data set simulated in this paper .",
    "in this section we briefly mention the dark - matter - only n - body simulations employed , the 1-d radiative transfer code developed by @xcite and provide an overview of the bears algorithm designed in @xcite .",
    "the dark matter only n - body simulations are the same as in @xcite and was performed by joop schaye and andreas pawlik at the leiden observatory .",
    "the n - body / treepm / sph code gadget @xcite was used to perform a dark matter ( dm ) cosmological simulation containing @xmath14 particles in a box of size @xmath15 with each dm particle having a mass of @xmath16 .",
    "initial conditions for the particle s position and velocity were obtained from glass - like initial conditions using cmbfast  ( version 4.1 ; @xcite ) and the zeldovich approximation was used to linearly evolve the particles down to redshift z = 127 .",
    "a flat @xmath17cdm universe is assumed with the set of cosmological parameters @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 @xcite .",
    "snapshots were written out at @xmath24 equally spaced redshifts between @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "halos were identified using the friends - of - friends algorithm ( @xcite ) , with linking length @xmath27 .",
    "the smallest mass haloes we can resolve are a few times @xmath28 . the density field was smoothed on the mesh with a gaussian kernel with standard deviation @xmath29 comoving @xmath30 ( 2 grid cells ) .      the implementation of the 1-d radiative transfer code is modular and hence straightforward to include different spectra corresponding to different ionizing sources .",
    "our 1-d code can handle x - ray photons , the secondary ionization and heating it causes , and as a result perform well both for high ( quasars / miniqsos ) and low energy ( stars ) photons .",
    "further details of the code can be found in @xcite .",
    "the parameter space simulated by the 1-d radiative transfer scheme @xcite include ; 1 ) different seds ( stars or miniqsos with different power - law indices ) , 2 ) duration of evolution ( depending on the life - time of the source ) , 3 ) redshifts at which these sources turn on and 4 ) clumping factor or over - density around a given source .",
    "information on the ionization and temperature profiles from these simulations were cataloged to be used later as in @xcite .",
    "density profiles around sources are assumed to be homogeneous although the code could be initialized using any given profile .",
    "bears is a fast algorithm that simulates the underlying cosmological 21-cm signal from the eor .",
    "it is implemented by using the nbody / sph simulation in conjunction with a 1-d radiative transfer code ; both discussed in the previous sections .",
    "the basic steps of the algorithm are as follows : first , a catalogue of 1-d ionization profiles of all atomic hydrogen and helium species and the temperature profile that surround the source is calculated for different types of ionizing sources with varying masses , luminosities at different redshifts .",
    "subsequently , photon rates emanating from dark matter haloes , identified in the n - body simulation , are calculated semi - analytically .",
    "finally , given the spectrum , luminosity and the density around the source , a spherical ionization bubble is embedded around the source , whose radial profile is selected from the catalogue as generated above . in case of overlap between ionization bubbles , the excess ionized atoms in the overlap area",
    "is redistributed at the edge of the bubbles . for more details",
    "see thomas et al .",
    "the outputs are data cubes ( 2-d slices along the frequency / redshift direction ) of density ( @xmath31 ) , radial velocity ( @xmath32 ) and hydrogen and helium fractions ( @xmath33 ) .",
    "each data cube consists of a large number of slices each representing a certain redshift between 6 and 11.5 . because these slices are produced to simulate a mock dataset for radio - interferometric experiments , they are uniformly spaced in frequency ( therefore , not uniform in redshift ) .",
    "thus , the frequency resolution of the instrument dictates the scales over which structures in the universe are averaged / smoothed along the redshift direction . the relation between frequency and redshift space z",
    "is given by:@xmath34 , where @xmath35 mhz is the rest frequency that corresponds to the 21-cm line .",
    "in @xcite the bears algorithm was introduced ; a special - purpose 3-d radiative transfer scheme used to simulate cosmological eor signals . in that paper",
    "we detailed the philosophy behind the code and its implementation to incorporate ionization due to a variety of sources . in this section ,",
    "we extend the features of bears to include heating ( on which the brightness temperature is sensitively dependent ) due to hard photons within the same framework .    the algorithm to implement heating begins in a manner similar to that for ionization .",
    "the @xmath6-profile from the 1-d radiative transfer code is used to embed a spherically symmetric `` @xmath6 bubble '' at the locations of the centre - of - mass of dark matter haloes .",
    "the luminosity of the source is a function of the halo mass .",
    "the problem embedding a temperature profile in the simulation box is that , the radius of the bubble is large ( @xmath36  mpc ) and results in extensive overlap , even at high redshifts ; a problem encountered for ionization bubbles only towards the end of reionization . in a quasar",
    "dominated part of the universe this is particularly severe because of its large sphere - of - influence in heating the igm .",
    "overlap in the spheres of ionized regions was treated by redistributing the excess ionizing photons in the overlapped region uniformly around the overlapping spheres @xcite .",
    "treating overlapped zones directly in terms of temperatures makes it difficult to come up with any `` conserved quantity '' . to elaborate , consider a pre - ionized zone in the simulation box close to the radiating source .",
    "although at close proximity to the source , this region is not heated efficiently because of the absence of neutral hydrogen to capture the photons . on the other hand , the same source can dump more energy into an initially neutral zone that maybe far away from it .",
    "thus , embedding the @xmath6-profile directly from the catalog ( which assumes uniform igm density ) is not appropriate .",
    "here we adopt a different approach where we estimate the total energy deposited in every region of the simulation box and invoke the conservation of energy deposited by the sources in the overlapped regions .",
    "we integrate the contribution to the energy budget , at a given location , from all sources whose sphere - of - influence extents to that location .",
    "this total energy is then redistributed equally to all the contributing sources , i.e. , the energy output of each source is modified to account for the overlapping .    to illustrate , consider @xmath37 sources that overlap at a particular location @xmath38 and the total energy estimated at that location to be @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is the energy deposited by the @xmath41 source at location @xmath38 .",
    "the fraction of `` excess '' energy attributed to each of the @xmath37 sources is @xmath42 .",
    "this energy @xmath43 is then added to the total energy from the source to estimate a new normalization constant for the sed of the source .",
    "for example in case of a power - law - type source , the sed includes a normalization term that is determined by the total energy of the source , @xmath44 .",
    "however , in the overlap case the total energy of the source is replaced by @xmath45 .",
    "now a `` new '' bubble of kinetic temperature is embedded whose profile depends on a source whose output energy has gotten a @xmath43 boost . in this manner @xmath46",
    "is estimated at every location in the simulation box . from this point on we need to estimate the coefficients that couple @xmath6 to @xmath1 that will eventually lead to the estimation of @xmath12 .",
    "it is worthwhile also to note that the results are robust to variation in the exact algorithm used to treat the overlapped region .",
    "for example , if we choose to sum the energies deposited directly in a given region or choose max(@xmath47 ) , where @xmath48 are energies deposited by sources 1 ... n respectively , the final results are very similar .",
    "this is obviously an approximation which assumes that the efficiency of the photons in heating the igm does not depend on their frequency . for the case of power - law sources where most of the energy comes from hard photons",
    "this is probably a reasonable approximation .",
    "however , in the case of blackbody sources this is not a very good assumption because evidently the heating is done by a very small fraction of photons .",
    "but in these cases the overlap problem is not as severe as for the power - law sources since the extent of the heating is much more limited . in summary , despite the approximate nature of this approach , it provides an efficient and reasonable resolution for the issue of the overlapping of temperature bubbles .",
    "we note that self consistent treatment of this problem requires taking into account the modification of each of sources sed in a different manner depending on the amplitude of its sed .",
    "obviously this is computationally very expensive .",
    "spin temperature can be thought of as a short hand notation to represent the level population of the hyperfine states of the ground level of a hydrogen atom .",
    "depending on the physical processes and background radiation that dominate a medium , @xmath1 is either coupled to the background cmb temperature or to the kinetic temperature of the hydrogen gas in the medium .",
    "formally @xcite derived @xmath49 as a weighted sum of @xmath50 and @xmath51 , as ;    @xmath52    where @xmath53 and @xmath54 are parameters that reflect the coupling of @xmath1 to @xmath6 via ly@xmath5 excitation and collisions respectively .",
    "the efficiency of ly@xmath5-coupling dominates over that of collisions , especially further away from the source @xcite . in our treatment of calculating @xmath49 , we estimate both @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "the coefficient @xmath54 is a function of @xmath50 and the ionized fraction of the medium , @xmath55 .",
    "these informations on ionization and heating are available from the prescription outlined in the previous section . while simulating the 1-d profiles we simultaneously calculate @xmath56 as ;    @xmath57    here",
    ", @xmath58 is the ly@xmath5 flux density at distance @xmath59 from the source .",
    "for miniqsos with high energy photons , ly@xmath5 coupling is mainly caused by collisional excitation due to secondary electrons @xcite .",
    "this process is accounted for by the following integral , @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the number of photons with energy e at radius r , and time t per unit area @xcite .",
    "this number is obtained directly from the 1-d radiative transfer by taking into account the the absorption due to the optical depth along the line - of - sight to the source at a distance r. the 1-d profiles generated are catalouged also as a function of time .",
    "therefore the profiles that are embedded within the simulation are chosen to obey causality .",
    "the ionization cross - section of neutral hydrogen in the ground state is given by @xmath62 @xmath63 is the oscillator strength of the ly@xmath5 transition , @xmath64 & @xmath65 are the electron s charge and mass , respectively , @xmath66 is the fraction of the absorbed photon energy that goes into excitation @xcite .",
    "note here that the fitting formula is a function of both ionization fraction and energy as given in the appendix of @xcite .    for the case of stars , the dominant source of ly@xmath5 flux results from the redshifting of the source spectrum blueward of ly@xmath5 into the resonant line at different distances from the source .",
    "frequency @xmath67 at the redshift of emission ( or the source ) @xmath68 is redshifted into @xmath69 at redshift @xmath70 such that ; @xmath71 thus , at every radius @xmath59 away from the source the ly@xmath5 flux @xmath72 . where @xmath73 [ ev ] .",
    "now , instead of embedding a sphere of the @xmath1 , as in the case of @xmath6 , we embed instead the a bubble of ly@xmath5 flux , @xmath58 , as estimated from eq .",
    "[ eq : lyalphaflux ] .",
    "since @xmath58 is basically the number of ly@xmath5 photons at a given location , the overlap of two `` @xmath74 bubbles '' implies that the photons and hence the @xmath74 has to be added , i.e. , at a given spatial ( pixel ) location , @xmath75 , @xmath76 , @xmath77 and time @xmath78 , the total ly@xmath5 flux is given by ;    @xmath79    where @xmath80 is the ly@xmath5 flux contributed by @xmath41 source at the pixel location in the box , @xmath75 , @xmath76 , @xmath77 and time @xmath78 .",

    "in this section we apply bears with its extended feature of including heating of the igm , to three different scenarios of reionization .",
    "the models described in this section are not `` template '' reionization scenarios by any measure nor is any particular model favoured w.r.t the other .",
    "in fact , these models may be far from reality and only serve as examples of the potential of bears to provide a reasonable estimate of the 21-cm brightness temperature for widely different scenarios of reionization .",
    "the first scenario explored using bears is the case in which the sources of reionization are _ only _ stars . in this section",
    "we describe the model used to describe the stellar component and the prescription adopted to embed these stars into haloes of dark matter identified in an n - body simulation .",
    "most stars , to first order , behave as blackbodies at a given temperature , although the detailed features in the sed depends on more complex physical processes , age , metallicity and mass of the star .",
    "this blackbody nature imprints characteristic signatures on the igm heating and ionization patterns @xcite .",
    "@xcite showed that the temperature of the star only weakly depends on its mass .",
    "the blackbody temperature of the stars in our simulation was thus fixed at @xmath84 to perform the radiative transfer .",
    "we sample the parametre space of redshifts ( 12 to 6 ) , density profiles around the source and masses ( 10 to 1000 @xmath85 ) .",
    "the total luminosity is normalized depending on the mass of the star according to table .  3 in @xcite .    for blackbody with a temperature around @xmath86 , similar to our adopted value , the spectrum peaks between @xmath87 to @xmath88 ( wien s displacement law ) .",
    "thus , from the form of the blackbody spectrum we can apriori expect , in the case of stars , that the ionization induced by these objects will be high , but the heating they cause will not be substantial given the exponential cutoff of the radiation towards higher frequencies .",
    "now , following the prescription in @xcite we associate stellar spectra with dark matter halos using the following procedure . the global star formation rate density @xmath89 as a function of redshift",

    "therefore , the total mass in stars within the simulation box is @xmath97 $ ] .",
    "this mass in stars is then distributed among the halos weighted by their mass ; @xmath98 where @xmath99 is the mass in stars in the dark matter `` halo '' , @xmath100 the mass of the halo and @xmath101 the total mass in halos within the simulation box .",
    "we then assume that all of the mass in stars is distributed in stars of 100 @xmath85 , which implies that the number of stars in the halo is @xmath102 .",

    "it has to be emphasized here that the ly@xmath5 photons are produced _ only _ due to the source and secondary processes .",
    "thus we see that stellar sources are efficient in building up a significant background of @xmath74 far away from the source which is sufficient to couple @xmath49 to @xmath50 during reionization @xcite . as an example , in fig .",

    "an interesting result of this comparison is that the large scales of the two spectra get matched before the small scales in the box .",
    "the interpretation of this behaviour is given in section [ sec : stats ] .",
    "we also compared our results to that of @xcite and found good match for the evolution of gas temperature and the volume filling factor of x - ray radiation .    in the near future calibration errors expected from a lofar - eor observational run",
    "will be added to these simulations along with the effects of the ionosphere and expected radio frequency interference ( rfi ) .",
    "subsequently , galactic and extra - galactic foregrounds modeled as in @xcite will be merged with these simulations to create the final `` realistic '' data cube .",
    "these data cubes will be processed using the lofar signal extraction and calibration schemes being developed to retrieve the underlying cosmological signal in preparation for the actual lofar - eor experiment which has already begun .",

    "<S> simulations estimating the brightness temperature ( @xmath0 ) of the redshifted 21-cm from the epoch of reionization ( eor ) often assume that the spin temperature ( @xmath1 ) is decoupled from the background cmb temperature and is much larger than it , i.e. , @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> although a valid assumption towards the latter stages of the reionization process , it does not necessarily hold at the earlier epochs . </S>",
    "<S> violation of this assumption will lead to fluctuations in @xmath3 that are neither driven by density fluctuations nor by @xmath4 regions . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , it is vital to calculate the spin temperature self - consistently by treating the ly@xmath5 and collisional coupling of @xmath1 to the kinetic temperature , @xmath6 . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we develop an extension to the bears algorithm , originally developed to model reionization history , to include these coupling effects . here </S>",
    "<S> we simulate the effect in ionization and heating for three models in which the reionization is driven by stars , miniqsos or a mixture of both . </S>",
    "<S> we also perform a number of statistical tests to quantify the imprint of the self - consistent inclusion of the spin temperature decoupling from the cmb . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the evolution of the spin temperature has an impact on the measured signal specially at redshifts higher than 10 and such evolution should be taken into account when one attempts to interpret the observational data .    </S>",
