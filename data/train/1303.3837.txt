    "bell s theorem @xcite is a famous no - go result that provides constraints on the program of interpreting quantum mechanics as an incomplete theory in the sense of einstein , podolsky , and rosen @xcite .",
    "it is expressed via inequalities that are fulfilled by any local realistic theory , but which are predicted to be violated by quantum mechanics .",
    "experimentally , it is indeed found that quantum mechanics violates these inequalities for certain entangled states @xcite .",
    "similar to bell , leggett and garg @xcite have proposed inequalities that are fulfilled by theories that satisfy a criterion of _ macroscopic realism _ , meaning that a system always occupies one of the states accessible to it . under the further assumption of measurement non - invasiveness",
    ", the correlations between measurements performed on the system at different points in time obey a bound that is violated by quantum mechanics .",
    "a third no - go result is provided by the kochen - specker theorem @xcite .",
    "essentially , it replaces bell s assumption of locality with the condition of noncontextuality : the outcome of a measurement on a system should not depend on other compatible measurements performed on the same system . here , two measurements are called compatible , if they can be measured simultaneously or in a temporal sequence without any disturbance .",
    "the kochen specker result contains bell s theorem as a special case in which the measurements are performed at spatial separation @xcite .",
    "it is , however , also applicable to single quantum systems ; consequently , entanglement is not necessary for violations of noncontextuality .",
    "in fact , violations of kochen - specker inequalities occur for all quantum systems of dimension @xmath0 , independent of the initial quantum state @xcite .",
    "however , in contrast to bell s theorem , the kochen - specker theorem does not readily lend itself to experimental tests of quantum mechanics .",
    "the direct testability is stymied by the fact that , during each experiment , only one measurement context is accessible at any given time .",
    "this limitation can be overcome , however , because similarly to bell s theorem , the kochen - specker theorem can be expressed using inequalities , though it was originally not cast into this form @xcite .",
    "this permits testing quantum contextuality by using measurements that are carried out sequentially .",
    "but even in this formulation , the question of experimental testability poses further difficulties .",
    "the reason for this lies in the notion of contextuality , which only applies in the case of compatible observables .",
    "but in an experiment , this condition can not be fulfilled perfectly ; indeed , even measuring the same observable twice may yield different results .",
    "this is due to the unavoidable presence of noise during the measurement process , which leads to disturbances of the state .",
    "it has been argued that this inherent difficulty , together with a related issue concerning the finite precision of real measurements , nullifies the physical significance of the kochen - specker theorem @xcite .",
    "different strategies have been proposed to overcome this problem . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the modification of kochen - specker inequalities through the introduction of error terms was considered ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite ) . given that the measurement - induced disturbances are cumulative , these terms compensate for the violations of compatibility .",
    "a related approach , addressing a similar loophole in experimental tests of leggett - garg inequalities , was proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite . on the other hand",
    "it was suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite to perform experiments on separate qutrits in order to forestall the possibility of violations of compatibility .    in this paper",
    ", we take a different approach .",
    "first , we consider the question : what does an experimentally observed violation of a noncontextuality inequality license us to conclude ? by proposing an explicit model capturing the effects of noise - induced compatibility violations ,",
    "we argue that to conclude contextuality from the violation alone is difficult to justify : the model produces violations of noncontextuality inequalities while being independent of the measurement context , and thus , noncontextual in this sense . in particular , we show that even the introduction of error terms as proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite can not settle the issue .",
    "we then propose a way to circumvent this problem by taking into account the ideas of leggett and garg : imposing a suitable time - ordering onto the measurements , it turns out to be possible to formulate inequalities that can not be violated within our framework , and thus , allow to rule out more general hidden - variable models under realistic experimental conditions .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we briefly recall the notions of compatibility and contextuality .",
    "then , we propose an explicit classical noise model capable of inducing compatibility violation in such a way as to violate contextuality inequalities . in section iii",
    "we show that the model can not be ruled out by previous approaches . to remedy this problem , in section",
    "iv we propose new inequalities , utilizing ideas from leggett and garg .",
    "these inequalities allow to rule out more general hidden variable models .",
    "as a basis for our investigations we take a variant of the well - known clauser - horne - shimony - holt ( chsh ) inequality @xcite @xmath1 each of the observables @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 has outcomes @xmath6 , and @xmath7 denotes the average over many repetitions obtained by measuring first @xmath2 , then @xmath3 , and then multiplying the results . if we assume that the observables in each context @xmath7 , etc",
    ", are compatible , then _",
    "nchv _ denotes the classical ( noncontextual hidden - variable ) bound , i.e. , the value obtained if each of the observables is assumed to have a fixed value independently of which context it is measured in . the bound _",
    "qm _ denotes the maximal value achievable in quantum mechanics @xcite .",
    "the question now is : suppose one experimentally observes @xmath8 .",
    "is this sufficient to conclude contextual behavior ?",
    "first , we need to make the notions of compatibility and noncontextuality precise .",
    "consider some observables @xmath9 .",
    "compatibility then means that within any sequence of measurements composed of these observables , the observed value does not depend on the point at which it is measured within the sequence .",
    "that is , for any sequence of compatible measurements @xmath10 , the observed value of @xmath11 at the @xmath12th point in the sequence , @xmath13 , does not depend on @xmath12 , i.e. , @xmath14 for all @xmath12 and @xmath15 .",
    "this formalizes the notion that measurement of one observable does not influence the measurement of any other observable .",
    "then , any set of compatible observables @xmath10 is called a _",
    "context_. a theory is called _ noncontextual _ , if for all observables @xmath11 and for all contexts @xmath16 the observed value is independent of the context , i.e. , @xmath17 .",
    "note that through the definition of a context , the notion of noncontextuality explicitly depends on compatibility .",
    "to approach the question , we construct a counterexample given by a simple model for noise - induced disturbances of the hidden - variable states .",
    "these hidden states @xmath18 are assumed to completely specify all possible experimental outcomes . in the present case",
    ", they can thus be indexed by the dichotomic outcomes of measurements of the observables @xmath19 : a given state is specified uniquely by a set of values @xmath20 for all @xmath21 .",
    "for ease of notation , this set of values may be interpreted as a binary number , whose decimal value is used to index the state , i.e. , @xmath22 denotes the state that produces the measurement results @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "the model can be generalized by considering states that are convex combinations of the value attributions @xmath18 , such that the most general state can be written as a mixture @xmath27 , where @xmath28 and @xmath29 denotes the number of observables .",
    "the dynamics of this model now is such that after every measurement , the system may randomly execute a transition to a different state .",
    "note that this transition does not depend on which measurement was carried out .",
    "this models the effect of noise introduced during measurement , i.e. , after a noisy interaction with the system , further measurements will in general yield different results .",
    "we will now show that this is equivalent to the introduction of compatibility violations in a realistic experiment , and , crucially , that these violations may lead to false positives in kochen - specker tests .",
    "consider the evolution depicted in fig .",
    "[ kd1 ] : a measurement of the observable @xmath2 is made on a system in the state @xmath30 , consequently producing the result @xmath31 . subsequently , the observable @xmath3 is measured , yielding @xmath32 . then , the system undergoes a state transition to @xmath33 , and a subsequent measurement of @xmath2 yields @xmath32 .",
    "thus , compatibility is violated .     and @xmath3 are performed sequentially on a system whose ( hidden - variable ) state @xmath34 evolves stochastically as indicated .",
    "time runs left to right . ]    of course , this model can not suffice to capture all quantum mechanical effects ; in particular , for _ a priori _ incompatible observables , it is easy to show that its behavior differs from that of quantum mechanics : take a measurement sequence such as @xmath35 . without disturbances , both quantum mechanics and the model predict that the same result will be repeated three times ; allowing for noise influences , there will be a small probability of disagreement . measuring @xmath36 , however , since @xmath2 and @xmath4 are not compatible , quantum mechanics predicts that the result for the second measurement of @xmath2 must be random , while in our model , it will agree with the first result up to possible probabilistic state changes ( i.e. , in our model , the probability distribution from which the value of @xmath2 is drawn will not differ whether it is the third measurement in the sequence @xmath35 or in the sequence @xmath36 ) .",
    "however , kochen - specker tests are always carried out within compatible sets of observables , and , since we are ( for the moment ) only investigating what can be concluded from such a test alone , this is not our concern here .",
    "our main point is that this simple model can invalidate some ideas to make kochen - specker tests robust against noise .",
    "let us now consider what happens during a measurement of the left - hand side of eq .   if violations of compatibility are present .",
    "then , if we denote by @xmath37 the observed value of @xmath2 , given that the hidden variable state is @xmath18 , @xmath38 can be calculated as follows : @xmath39 where the @xmath40 denote the probability that the evolution of the system is @xmath41 , that is , that the state during the first measurement was @xmath18 , which transitioned to @xmath42 before the second one , and we have introduced the quantity @xmath43 .",
    "the maximum @xmath44 of the coefficients @xmath45 provides the upper bound @xmath46 each @xmath45 represents the value of @xmath47 , given the hidden variable evolution @xmath41 .",
    "it is easy to check that @xmath48 : @xmath49 and @xmath50 , and thus , @xmath51 , while @xmath52 .",
    "hence , a simple model that after each measurement changes the system s state from @xmath53 to @xmath54 will maximally violate the chsh inequality ; if the change happens only with a certain probability @xmath55 , obviously any value between @xmath56 and @xmath57 can be achieved .",
    "it should be noted that despite the evolution of the hidden variable , this model is noncontextual in the sense that whether or not a state transition is effected does not depend on the measured context .",
    "it thus seems surprising that this model can violate the chsh inequality , apparently indicating contextual behavior .",
    "however , strictly speaking , noncontextuality simply does not apply in this case , as it is defined only under the assumption of perfect compatibility .",
    "an approach to rein in the effects of compatibility violations was proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite . there ,",
    "several classes of error terms were proposed , such that additional measurements may be performed in order to quantify the degree of failure of _ a priori _ compatible observables to be compatible in the actual experiment , i.e. , the degree of influence a measurement of @xmath2 has on the compatible measurement @xmath3 , for example .",
    "we will concentrate , for the moment , on the first class of error terms from ref .",
    "@xcite , which are those that have been experimentally implemented .    based on an assumption of noise cumulation , that is , an assumption that additional measurements always lead to additional noise and thus a worse violation of compatibility , the inequality @xmath58 - p^{\\mathrm{err}}[cbc ] \\\\-",
    "p^{\\mathrm{err}}[dcd ] - p^{\\mathrm{err}}[ada]\\leq2,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] holds @xcite . here for instance @xmath59 $ ] is the probability that the second measurement of @xmath3 in the sequence @xmath60 disagrees with the first one .",
    "however , it is clear that the model we discuss does not obey the assumption of cumulative noise : for an evolution such as @xmath61 , clearly both measurements of @xmath3 in the sequence @xmath60 agree , but if @xmath3 were measured in the second place of the sequence , then it would have yielded a value opposite to the first .",
    "thus , the model is not necessarily constrained by inequality ; and in fact , since the error terms all vanish for such an evolution , it is clear that the model can violate it .",
    "alternatively , it may be noted that while the original chsh - inequality is only concerned with measurement sequences of length 2 , the error terms contain only sequences of length 3 , and thus , can only provide information about the system s behavior during such sequences .",
    "this criticism holds for the other two classes of error terms in ref .",
    "@xcite as well .",
    "however , another approach , which does not need any additional measurements or further assumptions , is possible .",
    "this amounts to essentially applying the ideas of leggett and garg to contextuality inequalities . rather than employing the original inequalities proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite , it is convenient for our purposes to use a slightly different formulation . consider two different measurements @xmath4 and @xmath62 , performed at two points in time .",
    "then , @xmath63 , and thus @xmath64 where @xmath65 denotes the correlation between @xmath4 , measured at @xmath66 , and @xmath62 , measured at @xmath67 .",
    "we can now impose a similar time - ordering of observables on eq .",
    ", to get @xmath68    it is not hard to see that for eq .",
    ", @xmath69 for all @xmath70 : if the first three terms are equal to @xmath31 , the fourth is necessarily equal to @xmath31 , as well .",
    "hence , our model can not violate inequality , despite the violation of compatibility .",
    "since in the case of a trivial evolution of the hidden variables , i.e. an evolution that leaves the state invariant , we recover the usual notion of ( sequential ) noncontextuality , an experimental test of eq .",
    "constitutes a test of quantum contextuality robust against the compatibility loophole .",
    ".the peres - mermin square , with the pauli matrices @xmath71 , and the @xmath72 identity matrix @xmath73 .",
    "the observables in all rows and columns commute , and the product of all rows and the first two columns is equal to @xmath73 , while for the last column , @xmath74 . [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]     it should be noted that the chsh - inequality is not the only one that can be modified to hold in the case of compatibility violations : another important inequality proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite is based on the peres - mermin square ( @xcite ; see table  [ pm ] ) .",
    "using the same reasoning as in the chsh - case , the inequality @xmath75 holds also in the case of imperfect compatibility between observables . in quantum mechanics ,",
    "a value of @xmath76 can be reached .",
    "again , it is here the ordering of the measurement sequences that matters : the original inequality proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite followed the ordering indicated in table  [ pm ] ; but in this form , it is not hard to see that the inequality can be violated easily by our model .",
    "interestingly , the ordering proposed here is also useful if the mermin - peres inequality should be used for estimating the dimension of a quantum system @xcite .",
    "the importance of this scenario is that this inequality is state - independent , that is , one does not require a special quantum state for the violation ( as is the case for the chsh - inequality ) .",
    "furthermore , an experiment using sequential measurements on trapped ions already implemented this scenario by measuring the observables in table  [ pm ] in all possible permutations @xcite .",
    "this experiment focused on the violation of the inequality as originally proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite , and using this data , the observed value for eq .",
    "is @xmath77 .",
    "not every noncontextuality inequality can be modified this straightforwardly , though .",
    "for example , the klyachko - can - biniciolu - shumovsky inequality @xcite @xmath78 which exhibits a quantum violation even for a single qutrit system , as demonstrated experimentally in ref .",
    "@xcite , can not be rearranged appropriately .",
    "nevertheless , our approach can be generalized : the modified inequality @xmath79 holds for any noncontextual hidden - variable evolution .",
    "the reason for this is that it enforces the ordering conditions as in eq .  : to maximize the left hand side of eq .",
    ", for instance @xmath37 must equal @xmath80 , as must @xmath81 ; however , then @xmath82 , and thus , @xmath83 .",
    "this shows that even in the case of a single qutrit a kochen - specker test ruling out our model can be undertaken .",
    "however , one should note that due to this modification , the relative quantum violation shrinks , since the absolute violation stays the same , while the absolute value of the classical expectation increases .",
    "finally , it should be noted that a similar inequality like eq .",
    "has already been used in ref .",
    "@xcite in order to compensate for the fact that in this setup the observable @xmath2 was implemented in two different ways .",
    "in fact , a recently proposed state - independent inequality violated by a single qutrit system @xcite can be treated in the same way .",
    "this inequality features 13 observables @xmath84 , and the form that yields the maximum quantum violation is @xcite @xmath85 where the coefficients are as follows : @xmath86 for @xmath87 , @xmath88 for @xmath89 , and @xmath90 for @xmath91 ; @xmath92 for @xmath93 , @xmath94 , @xmath95 , @xmath96 , @xmath97 , @xmath98 , @xmath99 , @xmath100 , @xmath101 , @xmath102 , @xmath103 , @xmath104 , @xmath105 , @xmath106 , @xmath107 , @xmath108 , @xmath109 for @xmath110(2,5),\\linebreak[1](2,8),\\linebreak[1](3,6 ) , \\linebreak[1](3,9),\\linebreak[1](5,8),\\linebreak[1](6,9)\\rbrace$ ] , and @xmath111 else . by checking all possible hidden variable evolutions one verifies that the modified inequality since we consider disturbances to result from measurement interactions ;",
    "a single measurement can always be considered to occur in the first position of a measurement sequence . ]",
    "@xmath112 can not be violated by noncontextually evolving models . however , since the maximum quantum value in this case is only @xmath113 , the relative violation is reduced to @xmath114 , compared to originally @xmath115 .",
    "we have provided a novel approach to the compatibility problem in kochen - specker experiments .",
    "using the idea of time - ordering , as first proposed by leggett and garg , we have derived new inequalities violated by quantum mechanics even in the case of imperfectly compatible measurements .",
    "this shows that with a careful ordering of the measurements classical models can be ruled out , which can not be excluded with existing approaches @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , we are not claiming that our modified inequalities allow a test of the kochen - specker theorem free from the compatibility loophole .",
    "our results , however , show that with a simple reordering of the measurements a significantly larger class of hidden - variable models can be ruled out .",
    "we thank c. roos for providing us with the data from their experiment , and c. budroni and d. bru for valuable discussions .",
