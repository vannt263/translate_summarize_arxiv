    "zero - metallicity population iii stars ( hereafter p3 ) are thought to have preceded the normal metal - enriched stellar populations , but because they would be located at high @xmath0 they are inaccessible to direct observations by current telescopes .",
    "if massive , they are expected to have left a significant level of diffuse radiation shifted today into ir , and it was suggested that the cosmic infrared background ( cib ) contains a significant contribution from p3 in near - ir , both its mean level and anisotropies ( see review by kashlinsky , 2005 and references therein ) . this has recently received strong support from measurements of cib anisotropies in deep spitzer / irac images @xcite .",
    "if p3 are responsible for even a fraction of the claimed nir cib they would provide a high comoving density of photons all the way to the p3 era . in this _ letter _ we analyze effects of such photons on spectra of high-@xmath0 high - energy gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) and blazars that would be observed with the upcoming glast lat instrument to 300 gev .",
    "we show that the entire claimed nir cib excess ( nirbe ) can be explained if only @xmath24% of the baryons have gone through p3 stars .",
    "this would result in @xmath3 photons/@xmath4 whose present day energy is between 1 and 4 . such photons would provide a large optical depth due to photon - photon absorption for grbs ( and other sources ) at energies that will be probed with glast . detecting this spectral damping in forthcoming grb observations will provide an important test of the p3 era parameters .",
    "ay wavelengths @xmath5  the total flux produced by the observed galaxies matches the levels of the cib within its uncertainties , but in the near - ir ( nir ) the claimed levels of the cib are substantially higher than the net fluxes produced by galaxies out to flux limits where this contribution saturates ( see review by kashlinsky 2005 for details ) .",
    "[ cib_dc ] shows the cib _ excess _ levels ( filled circles ) over the net flux from galaxies observed in deep surveys ( open symbols ) ; the caption discusses the details .",
    "the excess is significant at @xmath6 , the range we term nir , and its bolometric flux is @xcite : @xmath7 at @xmath8  we evaluated the upper limits shown in fig .",
    "[ cib_dc ] described in the caption .",
    "the wavelengths @xmath910  contribute little , so we adopt the value of @xmath10 for what follows .    it was suggested that the nirbe is produced by massive p3 stars at high @xmath0 ( @xmath11 ) @xcite",
    ". significant energy release by p3 is suggested from the recent measurement of cib anisotropies in deep exposure spitzer data @xcite . because p3 stars , if massive , would radiate at the eddington limit , where @xmath12 , the total flux produced by them is largely model - independent @xcite .",
    "we reproduce briefly the argument from kashlinsky et al ( 2004 ) : each star would produce flux @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the luminosity distance . because for massive stars @xmath12 , the total comoving luminosity density from p3 is @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is their luminosity function and @xmath17 is the mass fraction of baryons locked in p3 at any given time . in the flat universe , the volume per unit solid angle subtended by cosmic time @xmath18 is @xmath19",
    ". finally , these stars would radiate at efficiency @xmath20 ( @xmath21 for hydrogen burning ) .",
    "this then leads to the closed expression for the total bolometric flux from these objects : @xmath22 here @xmath23 is the mean mass fraction of baryons locked in p3 stars and @xmath24 is a suitably averaged redshift over their era .",
    "the total flux is a product of the maximal luminosity produced by any gravity - bound object , @xmath25 , distributed over the surface of the hubble radius , @xmath26=@xmath27 , and the fairly understood dimensionless parameters . from wmap observations we adopt @xmath28=0.0224 @xcite and , since the massive stars are fully convective ,",
    "their efficiency is close to that of hydrogen burning @xcite , @xmath20=0.007 .    requiring that p3 stars are responsible for the flux given by eq .",
    "[ excess ] leads to : @xmath29 assuming @xmath3010 this is somewhat less than the @xmath31 value suggested by madau & silk ( 2005 ) and considerably less than the @xmath32 value of dwek et al ( 2005 ) . within the nirbe uncertainty , only @xmath92% of the baryons had to go through p3 .",
    "this is not unreasonable considering that primordial clouds are not subject to many of the effects inhibiting star formation at the present epochs , such as magnetic fields , turbulent heating etc .",
    "the only criterion for p3 formation seems to be that primordial clouds turning - around out of the primordial density field have the virial temperature , @xmath33 , that can enable efficient formation of and cooling by molecular hydrogen @xcite . assuming spherical collapse of gaussian fluctuations and the @xmath34cdm model from wmap observations @xcite the fraction of collapsed haloes at @xmath0=10 with @xmath35(400,2000)k is @xmath36 in good agreement with eq .",
    "[ pop3fraction ] as can be derived from fig . 2 in kashlinsky et al ( 2004 ) .",
    ". [ pop3fraction ] was evaluated from 1 to 4 , but with significant cib excess flux outside that range , @xmath23 would increase .",
    "however , at wavelengths @xmath37  the high-@xmath0 emissions would be below the lyman break and would be reprocessed to @xmath38  ( santos et al 2002 ) . if @xmath39 , which is unlikely in light of wmap polarization data ( kogut et al 2003 ) , the rest frame lyman break may be redshifted to @xmath401 , but the possible extra cib excess from @xmath411  will be compensated by @xmath23 in eq .",
    "[ pop3fraction ] decreasing with @xmath42 . at longer wavelengths , the cib excess given by eq .",
    "[ excess ] can at most increase @xmath23 by @xmath43 .",
    "the above estimate is subject to two caveats : first , it assumes the nir cib at the levels given by eq .",
    "[ excess ] , which were derived assuming a specific set of zodiacal light models",
    ". the latter may carry large systematic uncertainties , which are not included in the formal uncertainties in eq .",
    "[ pop3fraction ] .",
    "our estimate of @xmath23 is proportional to the cib excess summarized in fig .",
    "[ cib_dc ] and eq .",
    "[ excess ] and would change accordingly if these are superseded by future measurements . secondly",
    ", this estimate assumes that p3 were massive stars leading to the effective efficiency , @xmath20 , very close to that of the hydrogen burning , @xmath20=0.007 . if p3 were less massive than @xmath44 , the effective @xmath20 of their energy release would decrease by a factor of a few @xcite requiring significantly larger values of @xmath23 for a given @xmath45 .",
    "independently of the cib considerations , if p3 were less massive than @xmath46 , their fraction must be very small in order not to overproduce the metallicities of the poorest population ii stars @xcite , leading to cib fluxes from p3 significantly lower than eq .",
    "[ excess ] .",
    "if p3 at early epochs produced even a fraction of the claimed nirbe , they would supply abundant photons at high @xmath0 .",
    "the present - day value of @xmath47=1 mjy / sr corresponds to the comoving number density of photons per logarithmic energy interval , @xmath48 , of @xmath49=0.6 @xmath50 and if these photons come from high @xmath0 then @xmath51 . these photons also had higher energies in the past , @xmath52(0.1 - 0.3)@xmath53ev , providing an abundance of absorbers for sufficiently energetic photons at high redshifts via @xmath54 @xcite .",
    "stecker & de jager ( 1993 ) have pioneered applications of the @xmath55-@xmath55 absorption to constraining the present - day cib from high - energy spectra of low-@xmath0 blazars .",
    "madau & phinney ( 1996 ) and salamon & stecker ( 1998 ) have considered effects by evolving normal galaxy populations on potential future intermediate @xmath0 ( @xmath56 ) blazars . however , as shown in sec .",
    "2 , p3 stars are likely to have provided a far more abundant source of photons at high @xmath0 to interact with high - energy gamma - ray photons .",
    "grbs are the obvious objects whose high - energy emissions would be damped by the absorption from the nirbe photons .",
    "this effect was difficult to detect with egret because of its low sensitivity .",
    "observations by egret have detected only 6 grb s with one of them being a record energy 18 gev photon @xcite .",
    "a successor to the gamma - ray observatory , nasa s glast is to be launched in 2007 .",
    "its large - area telescope ( lat ) will provide significantly improved sensitivity needed for detecting high-@xmath0 grbs out to @xmath57=300 gev with better than 10% energy resolution above 100 mev , and its large field - of - view should detect @xmath2 100 - 300 grbs / yr . it is expected that @xmath250 of these would have enough high - energy photons to measure spectral indices at @xmath580.1 gev with uncertainty better than 0.1 .",
    "we show in this section that the photons produced by the p3 stars should leave a detectable signature by damping the high - energy part of the spectra of high-@xmath0 grbs .",
    "we denote with @xmath59 and @xmath60 the present day energies of the cib and grb photons respectively and the primes refer to rest - frame energies , e.g. @xmath61 .",
    "the photon - photon absorption , being electromagnetic in nature , has cross - section @xmath2 that for the thompson scattering , @xmath62 ; it is @xmath63 $ ] , where @xmath64 and @xmath65 .",
    "the cross - section has a sharp cutoff as @xmath66 , peaks at @xmath67 at @xmath68 , and is @xmath69 for @xmath70 .",
    "the mean free path of grb photons in the presence of cib would be @xmath71 mpc .    the right vertical axis in fig .",
    "[ cib_dc ] shows the product of @xmath72 and the comoving photon number density for given @xmath47 .",
    "the figure also marks the regions defined by the photon - photon absorption threshold .",
    "discussion in sec.2 makes it plausible that , if the nirbe originates from p3 stars , it must have a sharp truncation corresponding to the redshifted lyman break , or @xmath73 .",
    "thus we assume that , at least at high @xmath0 , there are few photons at wavelengths that are shifted today to @xmath411 . at longer wavelengths",
    "there is no observational evidence for cib excess over that from  ordinary \" galaxies containing population i and ii , but at the same time only spectra of the sources of very high energy @xmath55-rays at very high @xmath0 would be affected by that range of the cib .",
    "thus it appears that there exists a narrow wavelength window of @xmath74 in which the cib photons can interact with high-@xmath60 , high-@xmath0 grbs and probe the emissions from the , so far putative , p3 era .",
    "we assume a flat universe dominated by the cosmological constant and that the nirbe photons originated from p3 at redshifts higher than that of the grbs , so that @xmath75 . in this case , the optical depth due to photon - photon absorbtion is : @xmath76 where @xmath77 is the present - day photon density corresponding to the observed cib excess .",
    "[ tau ] shows the resultant optical depth and contributions to it from different @xmath0 .",
    "we adopted @xmath78=1.24 ev ( 1 ) and the form of @xmath77 corresponding to the solid line in fig .",
    "[ cib_dc ] .",
    "the onset of @xmath791 occurs rapidly at @xmath80 gev .",
    "the grb spectra at these energies should either be strongly damped or there had to be only negligible energy releases from the p3 era .",
    "given the high values of @xmath81 this would still hold even if p3 era produced only a small part of @xmath45 , but assumes that the latter has a lyman cutoff redshifted to @xmath21today . if the p3 era extended to lower @xmath0 , the lyman cutoff would occur at the observer wavelength @xmath82  and grb spectra would be damped at proportionately lower @xmath60 .",
    "thus , _ the location of this cutoff may also serve as an indicator of the grb s redshift_. with the advertised lat energy resolution of @xmath83 at @xmath841 gev , one could determine grb redshifts from the damping by the p3 photons to better than @xmath85 .",
    "how robust is this result ?",
    "first , photons due to optical counts of galaxies at much later times do not affect much the grb spectra because @xmath86 at low @xmath0 and they contribute @xmath87 a few as fig . [ cib_dc ] shows .",
    "furthermore , unlike the p3 photons for which @xmath88 , those contributed by galaxies would produce a still smaller contribution at earlier times compared to p3 .",
    "second , even if the nirbe is not entirely cosmological , fig .",
    "[ tau ] shows that p3 emissions should still lead to a very large optical depth , which scales as @xmath89",
    ". thus p3 would likely be the dominant contributors to the optical depth to grbs at high energies .",
    "finally , the magnitude of @xmath81 at a given bolometric cib flux should not be sensitive to the cib excess spectrum because the ( already narrow ) range of 1 - 4 available to dampen grbs at high @xmath0 is further decreased by @xmath53 .",
    "[ tau ] shows that the optical depth from p3 is very high , @xmath90 which , when combined with the sudden onset of the optically thick regime , would lead to an identifiable damping by the p3 photons .",
    "the damping will affect progressively lower energy part of the rest - frame grb spectra as one moves to higher @xmath0 . at these energies ,",
    "the grb emission is likely produced by the inverse compton and the synchrotron self compton components and is expected to be high ( or even dominate ) for the typical lorentz factors involved ( piran 2004 and references therein ) ; e.g. dingus et al ( 1998 ) construct an average spectrum from four egret burst and find the differential photon index of @xmath91 out to @xmath210gev .",
    "it may be sufficient to use glast observations of fairly low @xmath0 grbs ( say , @xmath922 - 4 determined spectroscopically in afterglow observations ) to establish the existence of the cib from p3 epochs ; if positive then the higher @xmath0 grbs can be used to further verify that it comes from the p3 epochs and/or calibrate the @xmath0 determinations from the damping .",
    "although spectra of more and more distant blazars are now measured with new instruments , such as hess , these blazars are still too close for unambiguous detection of the p3 emissions .",
    "the farthest blazars with known spectra are at @xmath930.13 - 0.18 and the spectra extend to @xmath943 tev ( dwek et al 2005 , aharonian et al 2005 ) .",
    "the right panel in fig .",
    "[ tau ] shows the optical depth of a blazar at @xmath0=0.18 produced by the @xmath55-@xmath55 absorption 1 ) due to observed galaxies , 2 ) due to nirbe from dirbe and irts , and 3 ) omitting the irts - based point at 1.65  and assuming the lower end of the dirbe - based results .",
    "even if the entire nirbe is correct and originates from p3 , the _ additional _ damping from it is small and is more pronounced only at @xmath581 tev , where measurements and interpretation are difficult .",
    "this is because p3 contribute to the background over a short range of wavelengths longward of @xmath95 .",
    "if p3 were to contribute only a fraction of the nirbe , their emissions will not contribute appreciably to the observed spectra of @xmath96 blazars , but would be seen in the high-@xmath0 grbs . if glast collects a large sample of blazars and other agns at @xmath97 , fig .",
    "2 shows that they can also be used to probe the emissions from the p3 era ."
