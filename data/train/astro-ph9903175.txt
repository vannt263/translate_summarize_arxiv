    "on 23 january 1999 _ bepposax _ detected , one of the strongest recorded gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) ( heise @xcite ; piro @xcite ) .",
    "the optical transient ( ot ) associated with this grb reached a peak magnitude of @xmath20 ( akerlof & mckay @xcite ) only 47 seconds after the initial detection .",
    "spectroscopic observations with the nordic optical telescope ( hjorth et  al .",
    "@xcite ; andersen et  al .",
    "@xcite ) , and the keck telescope ( kelson et  al . @xcite ; kulkarni et  al .",
    "@xcite ) , showed strong metallic absorption lines with redshifts of @xmath21 , suggesting that the ot is located either in , or behind , an absorbing system at @xmath22 .",
    "andersen et  al .",
    "( @xcite ) placed an upper limit of on the redshift of @xmath23 based on ultraviolet photometry and the absence of lyman-@xmath24 forest lines . for a friedman cosmology with @xmath25 km s@xmath15 , @xmath26 , and @xmath27",
    "a redshift of @xmath22 corresponds to @xmath28 mpc and a distance modulus of @xmath29 .",
    "this means that the ot reached a peak absolute @xmath10-band magnitude of @xmath30 , which gives an intrinsic luminosity of @xmath31 , approximately @xmath32 times brighter than a type i supernova . for an isotropic",
    "burst the implied energy release approached @xmath33@xmath34 erg , using batse fluence ( kippen @xcite ) .",
    "there are two broad families of models for grbs , both of which are related to the end stages of the lives of massive stars , and both of which predict that grbs should trace the star - formation rate in the universe ( e.g.  wijers et  al .",
    "the first family is the exploding object family , which includes the `` failed supernova '' model of woosley ( @xcite ) and the `` hypernova '' model of paczyski ( @xcite ) .",
    "these models predict that the progenitors of grbs are short - lived objects with low space velocities , so grbs should be found within @xmath35 kpc of the star - forming regions where the progenitors formed .",
    "the second family of models is the binary progenitor family , which includes the binary neutron star ( ns - ns ) model of narayan et  al .",
    "( @xcite ) and the merger of a black hole and a neutron star ( bs - ns ) model of paczyski ( @xcite ) .",
    "these models predict that grb progenitors will have high space velocities , due to two supernova explosions having occurred in the progenitor s binary system , so the grb could be found a significant distance from the star - forming region where the progenitor was formed .",
    "ots have been associated with several grbs , and most of these ots have been located within @xmath36 of a faint galaxy .",
    "redshifts have been measured for four of these candidate host galaxies and all are located at cosmological distances .",
    "_ hubble space telescope _ ( _ hst _ ) observations of the ot associated with were made between 23:06:54 ut on 8 february 1999 and 03:21:43 ut on 9 february 1999 as part of the cycle 8 proposal go-8394 ( beckwith @xcite ) in order to identify the host galaxy and to study the region around the ot .",
    "these observations consisted of six 1300 second exposures taken with the space telescope imaging spectrograph ( stis ) in its clear aperture ( 50ccd ) mode .",
    "each exposure was split into two 650 second sub - exposures to allow for the removal of cosmic rays . a six - position spiral dithering pattern , with offsets of @xmath37 pixels ( @xmath38 ) ,",
    "the ccd gain was set to 1 @xmath39/adu , and the read - out noise was 4 @xmath39/pixel .",
    "the data was processed through the standard stis pipeline and immediately made available to the astronomical community .",
    "fruchter et  al .",
    "( @xcite ) reported a preliminary magnitude of @xmath40 for the ot based on the _ hst _ images .",
    "bloom et  al .",
    "( @xcite ) used this data to derive magnitudes for the ot and for the purported host galaxy , and noted that there may be a small star - forming region to the north of the ot .",
    "fruchter et  al .",
    "( @xcite ) also derived magnitudes for the ot and the host galaxy , and determined a decay rate for the flux from the ot which suggests that the light from the ot may have been beamed for the first @xmath41 days after the burst , and then made a transition to and isotropic expansion .",
    "we combined the six stis images using the dither ( v1.2 ) software ( fruchter & hook  @xcite ) as implemented in iraf ( v2.11.1)/stsdas ( v2.0.2 ) .",
    "a `` pixfrac '' value of 0.5 was used , and the final output image had a scale of @xmath42/pixel .",
    "[ figure : host_ot ] shows the details of the ot and the probable host galaxy .",
    "we found the location of the ot to be @xmath43 ( j2000 coordinates ) based on the world coordinate system information in the stis image headers .",
    "we have taken the centroid of the bright elliptical object to the north of the ot ( bloom et  al.s object a ) to be the nucleus of the host galaxy .",
    "it is located at @xmath44 .",
    "the ot is situated @xmath5 ( @xmath45 kpc ) south of the nucleus of the host galaxy ( @xmath46 east of north ) .",
    "we estimated the total @xmath47 magnitude of the ot by performing aperture photometry with an aperture radius of @xmath48 .",
    "the local sky was measured in an annulus with an inner radius of @xmath48 and a width of @xmath49 .",
    "the photometry aperture and sky annulus were chosen to maximize the signal - to - noise from the ot and to minimize the contamination from the host galaxy and the nebulosity seen near the ot .",
    "the integrated magnitude depends slightly ( @xmath50 mag ) on the sizes of the aperture and sky annulus since the ot is situated near several bright knots in the outer regions of the host galaxy .",
    "no aperture correction was applied since the uncertainties in the background subtraction are larger than the aperture correction .",
    "the stis instrument handbook gives a zero point in the @xmath47 system of @xmath51 for the 50ccd ( clear ) imaging mode , which corresponds to a zero - point flux of @xmath52 @xmath2jy .",
    "this zero point gives a calibrated @xmath47 magnitude for the ot of @xmath53 , which corresponds to a flux of @xmath54 @xmath2jy .",
    "we assume that the ot has a power - law spectrum of the form @xmath55 where @xmath56 ( bloom et  al .",
    "@xcite ) and the zero - point flux for the stis in its 50ccd ( clear ) imaging mode yields @xmath57 @xmath2jy .",
    "fruchter et  al .",
    "( @xcite ) note that the stis magnitude of an object with a power - law spectrum is largely independent of @xmath58 due to the symmetric shape of the 50ccd ( clear ) bandpass .",
    "we converted the @xmath47 magnitude to the johnson @xmath10-band and kron - cousins @xmath59-band using this power - law spectrum and the photometric zero - points from fukugita et  al .",
    "( @xcite ) .",
    "the resulting calibration equations are @xmath60 and @xmath61 , where @xmath62 is the observed count rate in adu / s on the drizzled image .",
    "the ot is at @xmath63 , @xmath64 .",
    "schlegel et  al .",
    "( @xcite ) find the galactic reddening in this direction to be @xmath65 .",
    "we used @xmath66 ( rieke & lebofsky @xcite ) and @xmath67 ( cardelli et  al .",
    "@xcite ) to derive extinction corrected magnitudes of @xmath68 , and @xmath69 for the ot .",
    "these correspond to fluxes of @xmath1 @xmath2jy and @xmath70 @xmath2jy respectively .",
    "in order to examine the substructure near the ot we used daophot ii ( stetson @xcite ) to subtract the light from the ot . we constructed a point - spread function ( psf ) using stis ccd observations of a star field in the galactic globular star cluster .",
    "these images were taken with the stis in the 50ccd ( clear ) imaging mode as part of the cycle 7 proposal 7079 and were combined and drizzled in exactly the same way that the images of were ( output scale @xmath71/pixel , `` pixfrac '' @xmath72 ) .",
    "[ figure : host ] shows the stis image of the region around the ot with the light from the ot subtracted .",
    "the host galaxy appears to be a large irregular galaxy with several non - axisymmetric components .",
    "the total @xmath47 magnitude of the galaxy ( excluding the ot ) is @xmath73 .",
    "castro - tirado et  al.(@xcite ) find a flat spectrum ( @xmath74 ) consistent with a starburst galaxy . adopting this spectrum , and assuming no internal reddening in the galaxy , we find @xmath3 and @xmath75 for the host galaxy , corresponding to fluxes of @xmath76 @xmath2jy and @xmath77 @xmath2jy respectively .",
    "the total luminosity is @xmath78 .",
    "there is a large amount of unresolved light around the galaxy , and an arc - like feature can be seen @xmath79 ( @xmath80 kpc ) west of the nucleus .",
    "this structure is @xmath81 ( @xmath82 kpc ) long and @xmath83 ( @xmath84 kpc ) wide with a bright knot ( # 3 @xmath85 a1 [ bloom et  al .",
    "@xcite ] ) at its southern end .",
    "two more small knots can be seen to the north ( # 2 @xmath85 a2 [ bloom et  al .",
    "@xcite ] ) and northwest of the ot ( # 1 ) .",
    "the locations , and distances from the ot , for these knots are listed in table  [ table : knots ] .",
    "the final column gives the bloom et  al.(@xcite ) identifications .",
    "the magnitudes , fluxes , and rest - frame @xmath10-band luminosities for each knot are listed in table  [ table : knot_data ] .",
    "the uncertainties in the magnitudes and fluxes are @xmath86 mag and @xmath87 njy respectively .",
    "the uncertainties in the total luminosities are @xmath88 .",
    "the central regions of all three knots are well fit by the psf , which suggests that the knots are centrally concentrated .",
    "the drizzled image has a resolution of @xmath42/pixel ( @xmath89 kpc / pixel ) .",
    "therefore , we conclude that most of the light is concentrated in the inner @xmath90 kpc of each knot .",
    "this is comparable with the sizes of star - forming regions and h@xmath91ii regions in the local universe .",
    "the psf does not , however , provide a good fit to the outer regions of the knots .",
    "there is excess light left in the images of each knot after the scaled psfs have been subtracted .",
    "this suggests that the knots consist of dense , centrally concentrated cores embedded in extended structures .",
    "the apparent full - width at half - maximum ( fwhm ) of each knot is @xmath92 while the psf has fwhm @xmath93 . correcting the apparent knot diameters for the width of the psf",
    "gives intrinsic fwhms of @xmath16 ( @xmath94 kpc ) for the knots .",
    "this is consistent with the knots containing embedded star - forming regions .",
    "knot # 1 is partially covered by the ot and not clearly visible until the ot is subtracted .",
    "we believe that this knot is a real feature and not an artifact of the psf subtraction since similar features are not seen when the psf is used to subtract stars from the images .",
    "[ figure : host ] shows no systematic change in intensity between the northeast half of the knot , which was not obscured by the ot , and the southwest half , which was obscured by the ot .",
    "this also suggests that the knot is not an artifact of the psf subtraction . to test the ability of psf subtraction to reveal structure under the ot we generated a series of artificial stars with the same magnitude as the ot .",
    "these stars were put on the three knots , and in empty parts of the image near the ot , then psfs were fit and subtracted for each artificial star .",
    "we found that the knots were clearly visible after the artificial stars were removed , although the knots located under artificial stars appeared less centrally concentrated after the artificial stars were subtracted . comparing the recovered magnitudes of the isolated artificial stars with those of the artificial stars situated on the knots suggests that we are able to detect knots with @xmath95 that are located under the ot .",
    "the ot for is located on the southeast edge of knot # 1 .",
    "this knot is the most likely source of the metallic absorption lines seen in the spectra of the ot ( andersen et  al.@xcite ; kulkarni et  al .",
    "@xcite ) , although we can not rule out the possibility that the absorption lines are due to a very small , undetected , faint knot located under the ot .",
    "such absorption systems are often associated with high column densities of hydrogen , which in turn are associated with star formation .",
    "we used eq .  2 of madau et  al .",
    "( @xcite ) to estimate the star - formation rate ( sfr ) in each of the knots listed in table  [ table : knots ] , assuming a flat ( @xmath96 ) spectrum . for @xmath22 a rest - frame wavelength of @xmath97  corresponds to an observed wavelength of @xmath98  , so we computed the observed flux at @xmath99  by extrapolating between the @xmath10- and @xmath59-band fluxes .",
    "these were computed for each knot in the same manner as was done for the host galaxy ( see sect .",
    "[ section : magnitudes ] ) .",
    "the estimated sfrs for each knot , assuming a salpeter initial mass function , are listed in table  [ table : knot_data ] .",
    "for a scalo initial mass function multiply the sfr by 1.55 .",
    "the uncertainty in each sfr is @xmath100 @xmath101 yr@xmath15 .",
    "these sfrs assume that there is no dust , or obscured star formation , in the knots .",
    "this is probably a poor assumption if the knots are star - forming regions .",
    "therefore , our derived sfrs should be considered a lower limit on the true sfr in each knot .",
    "the ot is located at a projected distance of @xmath5 ( @xmath102 kpc ) from the nucleus of the host galaxy .",
    "bloom et  al.(@xcite ) calculated that @xmath103% of the grbs from ns - ns and bs - ns progenitors in galaxies with a shallow gravitational potential will occur within 5 kpc of the nucleus of the host galaxy and @xmath104% will occur within 30 kpc .",
    "this is consistent with the location of the ot relative to the nucleus of the host galaxy . if the progenitor is a failed supernova , or a hypernova , then the ot should be located within a few hundred parsecs of the star - forming region ( paczyski @xcite ) .",
    "the ot is located at a projected distance of @xmath18 ( @xmath19 kpc ) southeast of the centre of the nearest knot ( # 1 ) , which is larger than the expected separation if the grb was due to the explosion of a massive star , yet consistent with the ns - ns and bs - ns hypotheses .",
    "we wish to stress that this conclusion depends on there being no faint star - forming region directly under the ot .",
    "further observations will be needed , after the ot has faded , to determine if there are other small star formation regions that are currently hidden by the ot .",
    "we would like to thank s. beckwith of the space telescope science institute for making the _",
    "hst_/stis observations of available to the astronomical community .",
    "we would also like to thank h. ferguson for his useful comments .",
