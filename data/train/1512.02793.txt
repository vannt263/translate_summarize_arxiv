    "the quantitative determination of the phase space of su(@xmath2 ) gauge theories coupled to @xmath3 fermions in different representations of the gauge field provides a challenge in nonperturbative physics .",
    "the loss of asymptotic freedom when the number of fermion flavors is large can be understood perturbatively .",
    "asymptotic freedom simply depends on the sign of the lowest order term in the perturbative expansion of the @xmath4-function @xcite . below the loss of asymptotic freedom",
    "there is a range of @xmath3 where the theory has a non - trivial infrared fixed point ( irfp ) . with a sufficiently small number of fermion flavors the model develops a chiral condensate , which dominates its infrared behavior . whether the theory is chirally broken or has an irfp depends on its behavior in the deep infrared where the coupling can be large .",
    "the question is therefore nonperturbative in nature .",
    "the existence of gauge theories with significantly different dynamics from qcd has in the recent years generated significant interest .",
    "infrared conformal models are also of interest for model building beyond the standard model . a good example is provided by technicolor theories , where the electroweak symmetry is broken by the formation of a chiral condensate in a strongly interacting sector @xcite .",
    "various approximations can be used to study the lower limit of the conformal window @xcite , but lattice simulations provide the only first principles method of studying the nonperturbative dynamics of these theories .    in this work",
    "we study the su(2 ) gauge theory coupled to 2 flavors of fermions transforming according to the adjoint representation of the gauge field .",
    "the model has been studied in previous works by several groups @xcite .",
    "it is worth noting that results from this model can be used to constrain models with fermions in 2-index representations in a large @xmath5 approximation @xcite .",
    "the model is likely to have an irfp , but numerical estimates of scheme independent quantities such as the anomalous dimensions of the mass and the coupling carry large numerical and systematic uncertainties .",
    "we employ the gradient flow method @xcite and measure the running coupling using a larger lattice size than before .",
    "we use the same action as in @xcite , where the coupling was measured in the schdinger functional scheme . since the two methods use different renormalization schemes , the values are not directly comparable .",
    "scheme independent quantities , however , can be compared .",
    "we measure the mass anomalous dimension at the fixed point indicated by the running of the gradient flow coupling using the data first reported in @xcite .",
    "we find the value @xmath6 . the result is larger than the one obtained in @xcite , indicating systematic uncertainty , possibly due to the continuum extrapolation of the coupling . in section [ coupling ] of this paper",
    "we introduce the model and describe the measurement of the running coupling .",
    "we describe the measurement of the mass anomalous dimension in section [ gamma ] and conclude in section [ conclusions ] .",
    "we use a partially smeared wilson plaquette action and the clover improved wilson fermion action with hypercubic truncated stout smearing ( hex smearing ) @xcite .",
    "the smearing helps to reduce the discretization errors and allows simulations at larger couplings than an unsmeared action does @xcite .",
    "the action is the same as in @xcite .",
    "the gauge action is a mixture of a single - plaquette wilson action constructed out of smeared gauge field @xmath7 and unsmeared gauge field @xmath8 : @xmath9 where @xmath10 and @xmath11 is the wilson gauge action for the field @xmath8 .",
    "the properties of the gauge action are not sensitive to the precise value of @xmath12 and here we use @xmath13 .",
    "the fermions belong to the adjoint representation of su(2 ) .",
    "we use the wilson - clover fermion action @xmath14,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath15 is the standard wilson dirac operator .",
    "the gauge link matrices appearing in @xmath16 are in the adjoint representation and are constructed from the smeared matrices @xmath17 .",
    "we use the tree - level clover coefficient @xmath18 , which is expected to be a good approximation with smeared gauge links @xcite . the full action is then parametrized by the bare coupling @xmath19 and the hopping parameter @xmath20",
    ".    the wilson fermion action breaks chiral symmetry and requires additive renormalization of the quark mass .",
    "thus , in order to simulate the massless theory , we need to determine the critical bare mass where the physical quark mass vanishes .",
    "we define the quark mass @xmath21 through the lattice partially conserved axial current pcac relation @xmath22 and we define @xmath23 as the value of the parameter @xmath24 where @xmath25 vanishes .",
    "the values of @xmath23 used in the simulations are given in table [ table : kappac ] .    .parameter",
    "@xmath24 used in the simulations , the pcac mass at each @xmath19 and the number of measurements performed on the largest lattice . [ cols=\"<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     compared to the schdinger functional method , the gradient flow coupling tends to have good statistical accuracy allowing for shorter runs and larger lattice size .",
    "however , it tends to have long autocorrelation times .",
    "we measure the coupling after each hmc trajectory and find an autocorrelation time of @xmath26 .",
    "the values of the coupling and the autocorrelation times on the largest lattice are given in table [ couplingandcorrelations ] . to propagate the error consistently we use the jackknife method with 40 blocks for each set of parameters , giving a block size significantly larger than the longest observed autocorrelation time .",
    "we also note that , given the largest lattice sizes and couplings , topological freezing could be an issue .",
    "we measure the topological charge using the cooled gauge configurations at nonzero gradient flow time .",
    "after a period of thermalization , the topological charge settles to zero in all runs and never deviates for more than a couple of measurements .",
    "we include all generated configurations in the analysis .     at different values of @xmath27 .",
    "the dashed line indicates the perturbative running coupling in continuum at @xmath28 at @xmath29 .",
    ", scaledwidth=40.0%,scaledwidth=40.0% ]    the measured coupling is shown in figure [ fig : coupling ] as a function of the lattice size .",
    "it is clear form the figure that the coupling deviates significantly from the expected slow running on the coarsest lattice .",
    "the gradient flow coupling , as defined here , produces significant discretization effects at order @xmath30 .",
    "several ways of alleviating them have been studied in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "they also appear in the step scaling function at order @xmath30 and are removed by the continuum extrapolation .",
    "higher order effects are small in comparison and can not be distinguished from statistical errors at current accuracy .",
    "we use two different methods for taking the continuum limit .",
    "the first , the interpolation method , is more traditional and was first used in @xcite .",
    "it is based on parametrizing the data at each lattice size @xmath32 as a function of @xmath31 using an interpolating function .",
    "we fit the data to the polynomial function @xmath33 the order of the polynomial , @xmath34 , is found by minimizing the combined @xmath35 of the fit .",
    "this choice only leaves @xmath36 degree of freedom per lattice size .",
    "the high dimension of the fit function is largely due to the quick deviation of the results from the coarsest lattice from the tree level .",
    "we study the robustness of the fit by also running the analysis with @xmath37 .",
    "the result is essentially unchanged and the difference is included in the reported systematic error .",
    "the combined @xmath35 of the fit is @xmath38 .",
    "the interpolating function allows us to calculate the step scaling function at any value of @xmath39 and perform a continuum extrapolation using all the available lattice sizes .",
    "we expect the lowest order discretization errors to be order @xmath40 and fit the lattice step scaling function to @xmath41    we show the continuum extrapolation on the left in figure [ fig : sigmacont_int ] . while the scaling is steep , the second order fit describes the data through most of the fit range .",
    "however , the @xmath35 of the fit exceeds @xmath36 at several points along the range , and has a maximum of @xmath42 at @xmath43 .",
    "we have experimented with additional terms in the extrapolation , including term linear in @xmath44 fit , but these are not favored by the data .",
    "the systematic error of the continuum fit is estimated by excluding the smallest lattice size , @xmath45 and by adding a third order term in the extrapolation .",
    "the continuum limit of the step scaling function is shown on the right in figure [ fig : sigmacont_int ] together with the result with the smallest lattice size excluded and the third order extrapolation .",
    "the different fits agree up to @xmath46 .",
    "we find a fixed point at @xmath47 .",
    "the power series fit , also used in @xcite , allows us to leverage the data more efficiently .",
    "we represent the step scaling function and the discretization errors as a power series in @xmath48 and @xmath44 and fit to all lattice data simultaneously . since the step scaling function at each lattice size is a smooth function of the renormalized coupling",
    ", we can use a polynomial function to represent it with a relatively small number of parameters .",
    "the method also allows us to use the known universal two loop expansion of the @xmath4 function .",
    "the fit function has the form @xmath49 here @xmath50 and @xmath51 are fit parameters .",
    "the fit can be further constrained by setting the parameters @xmath52 and @xmath53 to their known perturbative values .    in figure",
    "[ fig : sigmacont_pow ] we show the continuum step scaling function and the fit to the lattice results . the parameters @xmath54 and @xmath55 are chosen to minimize the @xmath35 of the fits and the fit is stable against variations of these parameters .",
    "the first two panels in figure [ fig : sigmacont_pow ] show a constrained and an unconstrained fit with @xmath56 .",
    "the @xmath35 are @xmath57 and @xmath38 respectively and the statistical errors are found using the jackknife method . in both cases the running is slightly faster than perturbative below @xmath58 . the running then becomes slower and there is an irfp at @xmath59 .",
    "the fit shown in the third panel in figure [ fig : sigmacont_pow ] includes an @xmath60 correction and the one in the fourth panel is done excluding the smallest lattice size .",
    "the @xmath35 values are @xmath38 and @xmath61 and the fits show a fixed point at @xmath62 and @xmath63 respectively .    as our final result for the location of the irfp we quote the value obtained from the constrained power law fit with @xmath56 , @xmath64 and @xmath65 , @xmath66 .",
    "the first error is statistical and the second includes the range of results from different estimates of the continuum limit and from varying the parameters at each step . at the infrared fixed point , we find the anomalous dimension of the coupling , @xmath67",
    "in order to study the mass anomalous dimension in the gradient flow scheme we use the measurements first published in @xcite .",
    "we summarize the method here and refer the interested reader to @xcite and to @xcite , where the method is described in more detail .",
    "the mass anomalous dimension is measured from the running of the pseudoscalar density renormalization constant .",
    "it can be measured from the boundary to bulk pseudoscalar correlator @xmath68 normalized by the boundary to boundary correlator @xmath69 , @xmath70 the pseudoscalar step scaling function is then defined by @xmath71 at the fixed point the pseudoscalar step scaling function is related to the mass anomalous dimension as @xmath72         we use the interpolation method to take the continuum limit .",
    "first , we fit the pseudoscalar step scaling function to the interpolating function @xmath73 the @xmath35 of the fit is minimized by @xmath37 with the value @xmath74 .",
    "the continuum limit is then found for each value of @xmath48 by fitting to @xmath75    the continuum limit of the scaled quantity @xmath76 is shown in figure [ fig : gamma_cont_int ] along with the result form the largest lattice size . the continuum extrapolation is milder than for the step scaling function and the result at @xmath77 agrees well with the continuum limit .",
    "the result follows the two loop perturbative result up to @xmath78 and has a smaller value after that . at the fixed point",
    "we find the value @xmath79 .",
    "the first error estimate is purely statistical and the second includes an estimate of systematic errors and the uncertainty of the location of the irfp .",
    "we have presented a lattice study of the su(2 ) gauge theory with 2 flavors of fermions in the adjoint representation of the gauge group .",
    "we have measured both the running coupling and the mass anomalous dimension in the gradient flow scheme using the same lattice formulation of the theory as the one used in @xcite to study the model in the schrdinger functional scheme .",
    "the discretization effects present in the lattice model should therefore be the same in both studies and any difference should result from discretization effects and systematic errors in the measurables .",
    "we have measured the coupling at a larger lattice size than before and as a result have a better control over the continuum limit .",
    "the definition of the gradient flow coupling used introduces a large discretization effect of order @xmath30 .",
    "we observe steep approach to the continuum , but find that the @xmath80 extrapolation describes the data well and expect higher order effects to be small in comparison .",
    "our results confirm the existence of an infrared fixed point and we find @xmath81 .",
    "a fixed point was also found in @xcite and @xcite in the schrdinger functional scheme .    the mass anomalous dimension is a scheme independent quantity and",
    "can be compared between different studies .",
    "we find the value @xmath82 at the fixed point .",
    "the value found in @xcite is smaller , @xmath83 .",
    "the behavior of the estimator @xmath76 is similar in both studies and the difference likely arises from the uncertainty of the location of the irfp .",
    "our result is compatible with the value obtained in @xcite , @xmath84 . in @xcite @xmath85",
    "was obtained using a different method .",
