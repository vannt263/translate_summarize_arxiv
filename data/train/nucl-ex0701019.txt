    "two papers @xcite and @xcite on the determination of the time evolution of @xmath1 the electromagnetic fine structure constant from oklo reactor data recently appeared , adding contradictory results to earlier investigations @xcite . the fractional change of @xmath1 over a two billion year period has been found from oklo data to be : @xmath4 @xcite , @xmath5 @xcite , @xmath6 @xcite , and either @xmath7 or @xmath8 in @xcite . by comparison ,",
    "astrophysics determinations from data on the shifts of the absorption lines in the spectra of quasar light have yielded @xmath9 @xcite and @xmath10 @xcite over an approximately ten billon year period .",
    "the sign of @xmath11 is defined by the relationship @xmath12 , so that a negative sign , for example , means that 2 - 10 billion years ago the value of @xmath1 was smaller than at present . for more results and references on the time variation of fundamental constants",
    "@xcite .",
    "as the results indicate , the situation is not entirely satisfactory : some analyses give only upper limits , while those showing a definite effect disagree even in sign . while theoretical models have been proposed which can accommodate time dependent rates of change of @xmath1 , clarifying the disagreements among the oklo analyses is important , particular since there are also questions about just how model - dependent these very precise limits actually are @xcite . in this paper",
    "we will concentrate on the nuclear physics aspects of the oklo reactors , focusing in particular on realistic models of the neutronics .",
    "the oklo phenomenon has been known since 1972 .",
    "the history of the discovery , the geological background , the relevant petrography , mineralogy , isotopic chemistry and the oklo reactors physics are definitively described by naudet @xcite .",
    "most of details of the oklo phenomenon to which we will refer are from this largely unknown text .",
    "findings from more recent oklo studies are reported in refs . @xcite and @xcite .",
    "+ sixteen natural uranium reactors have been identified in gabon , west equatorial africa , in three different ore deposits : at oklo , at okelobondo 1.6 km away , and 20 km south of oklo at the bangombe . collectively , these are called the oklo fossil reactors .",
    "well studied reactors include zone two ( rz2 ) with more than sixty bore - holes , and more recently zone ten ( rz10 ) with thirteen bore - holes . in rz2 ,",
    "1800 kg of @xmath13u underwent fission over 850 kyr of operation and in rz10 about 650 kg of @xmath13u fissioned ( more rapidly ) over 160 kyr of operation .",
    "all reactor zones were found deficient in @xmath13u , and in most of them fission products were well retained .",
    "isotopic concentrations were measured by mass spectrometry , and provided information on the neutron fluency , the neutron spectral index , and the @xmath13u restitution factor ( burned @xmath13u is partly regenerated after @xmath1-decay of @xmath14pu formed in neutron capture on @xmath15u ) .",
    "+ due to the low 0.72% , abundance of @xmath13u and the high np capture cross section , present - day natural uranium can not sustain a nuclear chain reaction with light water as a moderator . however , 2000 million years ago , when fission chain reactions started at oklo , @xmath13u had a relative abundance of 3.7% , comparable to the 3@xmath165% enrichment used in most commercial power reactors . in those times",
    "therefore a chain fission reaction was possible in principle and actually took place .",
    "reactors in the northern part of the deposit , including rz2 and rz10 , operated at a depth of several thousand meters , under then - marine sediments which came close to , but still below , the surface after the tectonic uprising about 250 millions years ago . at this depth , the conditions of pressure and temperature are close to those of the pressurized water reactors ( pwr ) of today ( temperature around 300 c , pressure about 20 mpa ) .",
    "of course , the oklo reactor powers of 10@xmath1650 kw are greatly below the 1000-mw scale of the present reactors , and furthermore probably did not operate continuously .",
    "the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite deduced that rz13 operated for a 0.5 hour until the accumulated heat boiled away the water , shutting down the cycle for up to 2.5 hours until the rocks cooled sufficiently to allow water saturation to initiate a new cycle .",
    "shlyakhter @xcite was the first person to point out that a change in @xmath1 could shift the position of the 97.3-mev neutron resonance in @xmath0sm and that as a result the present - day capture cross section could be different from the ancient value . assuming a reactor temperature of 300k , and taking the fission isotope abundances",
    "known at that time , he found no evidence for a shift in the resonance position and accordingly obtained an upper bound for the fractional change in alpha of 0.1x10@xmath17 ( a revised number from comments in ref .",
    "@xcite ) . using updated abundance and temperature data , damour and dyson @xcite , and later fujii et al .",
    "@xcite carried out more detailed studies for rz2 and rz10 .",
    "they calculated the present - day effective cross section by averaging the resonance cross section over a presumed fully thermalized maxwellian neutron spectrum .",
    "in such an approach there is no need for a particular model for the oklo reactors since the spectrum is determined solely by the temperature .",
    "their results for the variation in @xmath1 were basically in agreement , indicating no change .",
    "by contrast , in the recent papers @xcite and @xcite , where contradictory results have been obtained , the averaging is performed over neutron spectra with a 1/e epithermal tail in an addition to the maxwellian contribution .",
    "spectra with different contributions from the epithermal neutron tail were obtained with an infinite reactor model in ref .",
    "@xcite and from monte carlo modeling of a finite reactor in ref .",
    "not surprisingly , the use of different neutron spectra can lead to different results .",
    "but since these models are not unique , the question arises as to how to choose between them and between other models .",
    "+ in the present work we suggest using measured oklo reactors epithermal spectral indices as criteria for selecting realistic reactor models .",
    "we perform mcnp calculations to find full scale models of rz2 and rz10 satisfying these criteria , and we use the resulting neutron flux spectra to calculate the dependence of the effective @xmath0sm capture cross section on the resonance shift .",
    "we deduce independently the ancient @xmath0sm effective neutron capture cross section using an updated formalism . from our limits on the 97.3-mev resonance shift , and assuming that only electroweak physics is varying , we we can set stringent limits on the time - variation of @xmath1 from the oklo data .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section [ sec : sighat ] , we review the definition of the effective cross section and the definitions of the various spectral indices used to define the contributions of the epithermal neutrons to the neutron flux . in section",
    "[ sec : model ] , we present our models of the oklo reactor zones , and our mcnp calculations of the neutron spectra . in section [ sec : xaveraging ] we calculate the @xmath0sm capture cross section as a function of the resonance energy shift , and in [ sec : xancient ] we review our new calculation of the ancient @xmath0sm cross section . in section [ sec : results ] we present our results and conclusions .",
    "to analyze the oklo reactor data without explicitly specifying the neutron density @xmath18 at velocity @xmath19 , it is customary to use not the average cross section @xmath20 , but instead an effective cross section defined as : @xmath21 here @xmath22 is the total density , and @xmath23=2200 m / sec is the velocity of a neutron at thermal energy @xmath24 ev . to keep @xmath25 , the reaction rate , unchanged it is necessary also to introduce an effective neutron flux density @xmath26 different from the true flux @xmath27 , leading to @xmath28 .",
    "when the cross section for a particular reaction channel exactly follows a @xmath29 law ( @xmath30 ) , we have @xmath31 and the reaction rate @xmath32 does not depend on the temperature @xmath33 . when the cross section @xmath34 deviates from the @xmath29 law at low energies ( as it does for @xmath0sm ) , and when the neutron spectrum is not pure maxwellian ( as is the case in any realistic reactor ) , the effective cross section can be written @xmath35 where @xmath36 , a function of the temperature @xmath33 , is a measure of the departure of @xmath34 from the 1/@xmath19 law , @xmath37 is a quantity related to the resonance integral of the cross section and @xmath38 is the oklo reactor spectral index , a measure of the contribution of epithermal neutrons to the cross section .",
    "the more well known epithermal westcott index @xmath39 @xcite is related to @xmath38 by @xmath40 the westcott index is a temperature dependent quantity while @xmath38 ( as shown below ) and @xmath37 are independent of temperature .",
    "since we will be concerned with extracting @xmath38 from neutron spectra calculated by mcnp for specific reactor models , we follow ref . @xcite and introduce the total neutron density @xmath18 and its epithermal fraction @xmath41 : @xmath42 , \\label{eq : dens}\\ ] ] where @xmath43 is the thermal maxwellian distribution , and @xmath44 for @xmath45 , otherwise zero , is an epithermal distribution which holds for systems with zero resonance absorption . each of the distributions @xmath46 and @xmath47 is normalized separately to unity .",
    "the velocity @xmath48 is an as - yet unspecified cutoff velocity for the epithermal distribution and @xmath49 is the most probable neutron velocity for maxwellian with the temperature @xmath33 as given by @xmath50 .",
    "the temperature @xmath51 is the temperature of the maxwellian density distribution having the most probable velocity @xmath23 , defined from the relation @xmath52 ev .",
    "the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite suggest cutting off the epithermal distribution at energy @xmath53 with the parameter value @xmath54 .",
    "the corresponding temperature dependent threshold velocity is then @xmath55 .",
    "at such a threshold the maxwellian component is already several times larger than the epithermal one , so such an approximation is satisfactory . the westcott spectral index @xmath39 is then defined as @xmath56 to assess the temperature dependence of @xmath57 , we transform from neutron densities to neutron fluxes .",
    "this yields for the total thermal component @xmath58 , and for an ideal ( without resonance absorption ) epithermal flux per unit of neutron lethargy ( lethargy is @xmath59 ) @xmath60 . introducing the ratio @xmath61",
    "we find : @xmath62 for small values of @xmath41 and @xmath54 , we see that @xmath63 .",
    "the quantity @xmath64 is calculated in reactor physics @xcite and for the case of moderation by hydrogen is @xmath65 here @xmath66 is the summed macroscopic absorption cross section at neutron velocity @xmath23 , and @xmath67 is the macroscopic scattering cross section of hydrogen in the epithermal region . from this equation and identifying @xmath64 with @xmath41 we see that the epithermal fraction of the neutron density in a reactor behaves as @xmath68 , thereby confirming that the oklo spectral index defined by eq .",
    "[ eq : rft ] is independent of temperature .",
    "+ in realistic systems the epithermal flux deviates from the 1/e dependence due to absorption of neutrons in uranium resonances above an energy of several ev . in this case",
    ", two different definitions of @xmath38 , both approximations , have been used .",
    "@xcite relies on the shape of the neutron flux and defines @xmath69 where @xmath70 is the is the flux per unit of lethargy at some effective energy in the resonance region and @xmath71 is the total flux integrated up to an energy where the flux begins to increase above the 1/e level . in ref .",
    "@xcite the spectral index @xmath39 at room temperature is computed as the ratio of the effective macroscopic absorption cross section @xmath72 to the moderating power @xmath73 @xcite , and therefore @xmath74 we compare these three definitions in the next section . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the temperature dependent weinberg - wigner @xcite thermalization parameter @xmath75 is used . for the case of hydrogen moderation only",
    ", it is related to @xmath76 by @xmath77 .",
    "+ the oklo spectral indices @xmath38 are known quantities ; their values have been deduced for several oklo reactor zones @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite from analysis of the fission products @xmath78nd , @xmath79sm , and the @xmath13u concentrations .",
    "we will use these spectral indices to discriminate between possible models of the ancient reactor zones .",
    "in particular , the following experimental values have been deduced : @xmath80 @xmath16 @xmath81 for rz2 and @xmath82 for rz10 .",
    "the rz2 result is a range of the borehole sc36 values corrected in ref .",
    "@xcite after re - evaluation of the cross section @xmath83 to the expression @xmath84 .",
    "we report the rz10 result as an average from four samples of ref .",
    "the reactor criticality is determined by the size , geometry and composition of the active zone . the latter influences the energy dependence of the neutron flux .",
    "the oklo reactor zones include uraninite @xmath85 , gangue ( oxides of different metals with water of crystallization ) , water , and poisons that are present initially or build up during operation . among these parameters , the most uncertain is the amount of water present at the time of reactor operation . in our modeling , we vary this parameter to match the experimental spectral indices for rz2 and rz10 while keeping the reactor under critical conditions .",
    "+ the oklo reactor cores have a characteristic horizontal size of order 10 m and occur in sandstone as lens shaped bodies of thickness varying between 20 and about 90 cm .",
    "the uranium content ranged from 20 to 80 wt.% .",
    "each core is surrounded by a clay mantle . in the past water",
    "filled spaces left by cracks and fissures .",
    "the effective porosity required to achieve criticality is large ( @xmath8620% ) , and is explained by a de - silicication process @xcite consisting of partial leaching of the silica by hot thermal underground water .",

    "@xcite , which limits the temperature to this range , and as per knowledge that the geological formation and depth would not allow liquid water to be present above 300 c.      an expanded version of the calculated rz10 @xmath95 cross sections at 200 and 300 c is shown in fig .",

    "@xcite on the basis of other data , but we retain it here for completeness .",
    "damour and dyson @xcite analyzed the dependence on @xmath1 of the coulomb energy contribution to the resonance energy of @xmath0sm and concluded that an energy shift due to the electromagnetic interaction was related to a shift in @xmath1 by @xmath98 the energy @xmath99 mev was estimated from known isotopic shifts in the mean square radii of the proton density distributions in samarium .",
    "our result is quite insensitive to the assumption of fixed @xmath102 .",
    "varying the h / u ratio changes @xmath102 , and therefore affects the neutron spectrum and the resulting effective cross section .",

    "dyson assumed that changes in the nuclear part of the hamiltonian did not correlate with with changes in the coulomb energy over time .",
    "they noted that changes in the @xmath104 could , in principle , show themselves as changes of the resonance position .",
