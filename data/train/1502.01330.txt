    "the solar corona supports a rich variety of wave phenomena whose main features are determined by the magnetic field and plasma structuring . for our purposes",
    "it is important to distinguish between different wave manifestations such as driven and impulsively excited perturbations .",
    "driven waves are often caused by a continuous , periodic exciter at the photospheric or chromospheric level and propagate away from the place where they are generated .",
    "this is the case , for example , of waves propagating upwards along spicules @xcite or along the coronal magnetic field @xcite .",
    "the disturbances propagating in filament threads observed by @xcite are probably representative of driven waves too , although the exciting agent is not clear in this case . rapidly propagating quasi - periodic coronal disturbances",
    "@xcite also seem to be caused by a continuous driver that in this case is associated to a flare or the initiation of a cme . for a modelling of these events",
    "see @xcite .",
    "when a magnetic flux tube ( e.g. , spicule , coronal loop , or prominence thread ) is subject to a periodic driving it shows a distinct response . an axisymmetric driver that periodically compresses and expands the tube at one position leads to the propagation of a sausage - type perturbation ( see figure  [ fig_cylinder_sausage](a ) ) .",
    "a periodic transverse shaking of the tube results in a kink - type perturbation by which the tube boundary acquires the shape of a snake ( see figure  1(a ) of * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter paper  i ) .",
    "a torsional driver leads to alfvn wave propagation along the tube with no apparent modification of its boundary .",
    "( a)(b )    an impulsive energy release can lead to both standing and propagating disturbances .",
    "the transverse coronal loop oscillations studied by @xcite constitute a good example of the first type of phenomenon , for which there are many observational studies in the literature . for recent observations using the atmospheric imaging assembly ( aia ) on board",
    "the _ solar dynamics observatory _ , see @xcite .",
    "our interest in this work is in the second type of event , i.e. , a magnetic flux tube perturbed by a sudden , localized expansion or compression such as that of figure  [ fig_cylinder_sausage](b ) ( see also figure  1(b ) of paper  i for a localized transverse excitation ) . in a dispersive medium ,",
    "such initial pulse disperses and transforms into a wave train that induces quasi - periodic plasma oscillations with a range of periods ( rather than the single - period oscillations of driven propagating waves or standing oscillations ) .",
    "hence , the time signal ( e.g. , doppler shift or spectral line intensity ) collected at a given position shows a characteristic `` tadpole '' shape in its wavelet diagram ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the important difference between driven and impulsively excited waves , then , is that the first ones have the period of the driving agent , whereas the second ones display a continuous variation of the period that depends on the size of the initial perturbation and the physical properties of the medium .",
    "several observations of quasi - periodic oscillations have been ascribed to the dispersive behavior of propagating wave packets .",
    "@xcite used the solar eclipse corona imaging system ( secis ) to record white light and coronal green line images of the solar corona during a solar eclipse .",
    "they studied the intensity variations in the vicinity of an active region and detected periodic variations with period in the range 47  s that propagate through the loop apex with a speed of 2100  km  s@xmath0 .",
    "the wavelet spectra of signals at different points along the wave path display the `` tadpole '' shape mentioned above .",
    "this wavelet feature is also present in solar decimetric radio bursts @xcite and in radio sources lying in a magnetic fan structure @xcite .",
    "the impulsive excitation of fast magnetohydrodynamic waves , and their subsequent evolution as an oscillatory wave train , has been addressed for different magnetic structures : fast sausage wave trains in a coronal slab @xcite , in a current sheet @xcite , and in a magnetic funnel @xcite .",
    "impulsively generated fast sausage and kink wave packets in coronal holes have also been studied by @xcite .",
    "our paper is concerned with the temporal evolution of a concentrated axisymmetric compression or expansion of a uniform , cylindrical magnetic tube ; see figure  [ fig_cylinder_sausage](b ) .",
    "this initial disturbance leads to the propagation of a fast sausage wave train along the tube .",
    "the propagation and dispersion of wave packets in magnetic slabs has already been investigated numerically in slab geometry , but not in cylindrical geometry .",
    "this is the outline of our paper .",
    "section  [ sect_gov_eqns ] contains the governing equations of linear fast perturbations in a plasma cylinder in the @xmath1 limit . in sections  [ sect_proper ] and [ sect_improper ]",
    "we give a description of fast sausage proper and improper modes , whose spectra are discrete and continuous , respectively .",
    "the initial perturbation is used in section  [ sect_fourier ] to obtain analytical expressions for the time evolution of the perturbed variables and the results are presented in section  [ sect_results ] .",
    "we consider a homogeneous cylindrical magnetic tube embedded in a uniform environment . in this work we use cylindrical coordinates @xmath2 , with the @xmath3-axis pointing along the cylinder axis .",
    "the magnetic field is uniform in the whole space and parallel to the @xmath3-axis , and so can be written as @xmath4 .",
    "the equilibrium density is    @xmath5    where the subscripts ` @xmath6 ' and ` @xmath7 ' denote internal and external values , respectively , and @xmath8 is the tube radius .",

    "* ) . in our work",

    "@xmath49 and this implies that @xmath50 , @xmath51 .",
    "then , the solution to equation  ( [ equ_for_hatp ] ) regular at @xmath52 and that does not diverge as @xmath53 is    @xmath54    where @xmath55 and @xmath56 are two constants , @xmath57 is the bessel function of the first kind and order @xmath58 , and @xmath59 is the modified bessel function of the second kind and order @xmath58 .",
    "moreover ,    @xmath60    and @xmath61 is    @xmath62    it is important to mention that when using these equations to determine the radial wavenumbers , the positive value is taken , i.e. , @xmath63 , @xmath64 .",
    "an algebraic expression for @xmath55 and @xmath56 is obtained by imposing the continuity of @xmath65 at @xmath66 .",
    "the remaining constant can be imposed arbitrarily .",
    "here we use expressions analogous to those of paper  i , that is    @xmath67    now that the function @xmath65 is determined , all other perturbations can be obtained from equations  ( [ rho_pert ] ) , ( [ xi_pert ] ) , ( [ b_pert ] ) , and ( [ v_pert ] ) .",
    "we write the expression of the radial plasma displacement because it will be used later ,    @xmath68    where a prime indicates a derivative . from now on",

    "@xmath69    and write equation  ( [ xir_of_r_primes ] ) as    @xmath70      imposing the continuity of the radial displacement at @xmath66 leads to the dispersion relation for proper fast sausage modes ,    @xmath71    in this work the dispersion relation is used to obtain the frequency of a proper mode with a given longitudinal wavenumber , @xmath72 .",
    "therefore , we often write the frequency as @xmath73 .    moreover ,",
    "the phase speed and group velocity are defined in the usual manner ,    @xmath74    although the phase speed is not used in our calculations nor in the interpretation of results , it is also given here because it is an important parameter of proper modes .",
    "the main features of @xmath75 , @xmath76 , and @xmath77 of proper sausage modes in a magnetic cylinder have been discussed in previous works ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "they are summarised below .",
    "first , we discuss some properties of the eigensolutions for the possible sign combinations of @xmath72 and @xmath75 ; they will be useful when the method of fourier integrals is applied to the wave propagation problem .",
    "it is clear that the two pairs of values @xmath78 and @xmath79 correspond to the same eigenmode , propagating in a given direction along the @xmath3-axis .",
    "it is obvious that the solutions presented above have this property : if the signs of both @xmath72 and @xmath75 are simultaneously changed , then equations  ( [ ki ] ) and ( [ kappae ] ) show that the internal and external radial wavenumbers are not modified . as a result , these new values of the longitudinal wavenumber and frequency also satisfy the dispersion relation . in other words , if @xmath73 is the frequency of a proper mode , then @xmath80 is also a frequency of a proper mode .",
    "using equations  ( [ rho_pert ] ) , ( [ b_pert ] ) , ( [ v_pert ] ) , ( [ hatp ] ) , and ( [ xir_of_r ] ) , we see that the perturbations of both modes are identical .",
    "finally , we also have @xmath81 and @xmath82 .",
    "next let us consider a fixed @xmath72 : if @xmath73 is a solution to the dispersion relation , then @xmath83 corresponds to the eigenmode propagating in the opposite direction along the magnetic tube .",
    "again , the two eigenmodes have the same eigenfunctions , but opposite phase speed and group velocity .",
    "thus , in the rest of this section it is enough to concentrate in @xmath84 , @xmath85 .",
    "both positive and negative values of @xmath72 and @xmath75 will be taken into account when deriving the solution to the initial value problem by the method of fourier integrals ( section  [ sect_fourier ] ) .",
    "the magnetic cylinder supports an infinite number of fast sausage radial harmonics , characterised by the number of nodes of @xmath86 .",
    "all radial harmonics have a node at the tube axis , @xmath87 .",
    "this is the only node for the fundamental sausage eigenmode .",
    "the first overtone has two nodes in the radial direction , etc . , and all these nodes are inside the magnetic cylinder .",
    "an additional feature of proper fast sausage modes is that they only exist for longitudinal wavenumbers exceeding the cut - off value @xcite ,    @xmath88    where @xmath89 is the @xmath90th zero ( in increasing order ) of @xmath91 . here",

    "the dispersion diagram ( figure  [ fig_dr_over](a ) ) is rarely found in the literature .",
    "it shows that all proper modes , including the fundamental one , have a wavenumber cut - off and that their frequency satisfies @xmath94 .",
    "one can see that increasing the density ratio raises the upper frequency limit @xmath95 and so more overtones are present in this diagram .",
    "it is worth to mention that linear waves with @xmath96 also exist , but instead of discrete values of @xmath75 these solutions can have any frequency ( see section  [ sect_improper ] ) .",
    "figure  [ fig_dr_over](b ) has been presented many times in other works and so is not discussed here .",
    "it is enough to note that the phase speed lies between the internal and external alfvn speeds .",
    "finally , figure  [ fig_dr_over](c ) shows the group velocity as a function of @xmath72 .",
    "when the wavenumber approaches its cut - off value from the right , @xmath77 rapidly increases and tends to @xmath97 , i.e. , it tends to 3 and 2 for the red and black lines , respectively . for larger wavenumbers ,",
    "the group velocity decreases to its minimum and finally increases slowly towards @xmath98 . in appendix  [ app_large_k ]",
    "we show that the phase speed tends to @xmath98 from above as @xmath99",

    ". the dimensionless results only depend on two parameters , namely the density ratio @xmath93 ( or equivalently the alfvn speed ratio @xmath170 ) and @xmath161 .",

    "we use the parameter values @xmath172 and @xmath173 .",
    "if dimensional results are needed , then two more parameters are required : the tube radius , @xmath8 , and alfvn speed , @xmath98 .",
    "+   +    we first consider the radial displacement at the magnetic tube boundary for @xmath141 .",
    "this is obtained from equations  ( [ four_trans_inv - main ] ) and ( [ expand_eigen - main ] ) , where the contribution of proper and improper modes are computed separately .",
    "the black line of figure  [ fig_t=0 ] shows that this numerically computed @xmath34 reproduces the gaussian initial condition of equations  ( [ init_cond ] ) and ( [ f_r ] ) .",
    "in addition , figure  [ fig_t=0 ] also reveals that improper modes ( red line ) have a large contribution to the initial wave form . for the considered parameter values , this contribution is larger than that of proper modes ( green line ) .",
    "the reason for the large amplitude of improper modes can be found in the wavenumber cut - off of the fundamental fast sausage eigenmode , that does not exist for @xmath124 .",
    "its overtones have even larger wavenumber cut - offs . then , given the initial disturbance of equation  ( [ f_r ] ) and its fourier transform of equation  ( [ f_r_k ] ) , that peaks at @xmath174 , the contributions to @xmath175 for @xmath124 can not be accounted for by proper modes .",
    "this implies that improper modes must have an important contribution to the initial amplitude of the perturbation and , therefore , to the posterior evolution of the wave train propagation .",
    "another significant feature of figure  [ fig_t=0 ] is that the contribution of both proper and improper modes extends well beyond the length of the tube affected by the initial disturbance .",
    "the two contributions display spatial variations that added together yield the gaussian shape of equation  ( [ f_r_k ] ) .",
    "it is worth noticing that improper eigenmodes are more relevant for the present axisymmetric disturbance than for the transverse disturbance : compare figure  [ fig_t=0 ] and figures  4(a ) and ( b ) of paper  i. the main difference between fast kink and sausage proper modes is that the fundamental proper kink mode exists for all wavenumbers , so that it can account for the main part of the function @xmath175 .",
    "this fact lowers the importance of improper modes in the case of a transverse disturbance and also has a second effect : contrary to the case studied here , at @xmath141 proper and improper modes are confined to the vicinity of the initial perturbation , such as revealed by figures  4(a ) and ( b ) of paper  i.    from figure  [ fig_t=0 ] we also see that the contribution of improper modes increases when either @xmath161 is increased or @xmath93 is decreased .",
    "we next explain this behavior .",
    "an increase of @xmath161 corresponds to a longer initial perturbation , whose fourier transform becomes more concentrated around @xmath174 .",
    "since the fundamental fast sausage mode only exists for @xmath176 , an increase in @xmath161 results in a decrease of @xmath175 for @xmath176 , so that the contribution of proper modes becomes smaller .",
    "this is corroborated by figures  [ fig_amplr](a ) and",
    "( b ) , where the contribution of proper modes to the amplitude of @xmath177 at @xmath66 is shown for two values of @xmath161 .",
    "in addition , the role of the density ratio is to modify the cut - off wavenumbers , in such a way that a decrease in @xmath93 leads to a larger wavenumber cut - off ( see figure  [ fig_dr_over ] ) .",
    "this then yields a smaller contribution of proper modes : compare figures  [ fig_amplr](a ) and ( c ) .",
    "figure  [ fig_amplr ] also provides information about the relative importance of proper mode overtones .",
    "such as expected , the largest amplitude of all proper modes corresponds to the fundamental fast sausage mode , whereas its radial overtones possess smaller amplitudes . by comparing panels ( a ) and ( b )",
    "we see that longer initial perturbations result in a negligible amplitude of all radial overtones .",
    "we must mention that in figures  [ fig_amplr](a ) and ( b ) only the fundamental mode and its first overtone are present ( solid and dashed lines ) , although in panel ( b ) the first overtone has negligible amplitude , so its curve is invisible . furthermore , in figure  [ fig_amplr](c ) the dashed and dotted curves overlap for @xmath178 and may seem to be just one .",
    "+   +      next , we concentrate in the evolution of the pulse of figure  [ fig_t=0](a ) .",
    "this initial perturbation splits in two identical wave trains that propagate symmetrically in both directions along the magnetic tube .",
    "the early stages of the propagating wave trains are presented in figure  [ fig_vae2_delta1_short_t ] and animation  1 .",
    "figures  [ fig_vae2_delta1_short_t](a)(c ) correspond to the separation of the two wave trains , whereas in figure  [ fig_vae2_delta1_short_t](d ) these two features are fully formed .",
    "the strong dispersion of the axisymmetric perturbation can be well appreciated in this last panel : both wave packets have developed some 6 maxima and minima and their length is more than 4 times that of the perturbation at @xmath141 .",
    "proper and improper modes contribute with similar amplitudes to the total signal represented in figure  [ fig_vae2_delta1_short_t ] and animation  1 .",
    "a secondary effect of wave dispersion is the strong reduction of the wave packets amplitude . in the absence of dispersion",
    ", the two wave packets of figure  [ fig_vae2_delta1_short_t](d ) would have amplitude 0.5 , whereas their actual peak - to - peak amplitude is under 0.3 .",
    "when discussing figure  [ fig_t=0 ] we explained that , when considered separately , the contributions of proper and improper modes affect a section of the magnetic tube much longer than that of the initial perturbation . at @xmath141",
    "these two contributions simply cancel out in the parts of the magnetic tube where the initial excitation is negligible .",
    "this situation also takes place for @xmath179 : although proper and improper mode contributions disturb a large part of the magnetic tube , their sum is concentrated in a smaller section .",
    "thus , ahead of the propagating wave fronts , where the initial perturbation has not yet arrived , these contributions are spatially out of phase and cancel out .",
    "this is also found at @xmath180 of figure  [ fig_vae2_delta1_short_t](d ) because the two wave packets have moved beyond this section of the magnetic tube , which is barely disturbed .",
    "+   +     +    the green and red curves of figure  [ fig_vae2_delta1_short_t ] reveal the separate behavior of proper and improper modes .",
    "the first ones propagate with group velocity ranging from @xmath181 ( see the minimum of the black line in figure  [ fig_dr_over](c ) ) to @xmath182 . because of this variation of group velocity the green curve displays some dispersion , that becomes more clear for later times ( this issue will be discussed below with the help of figure  [ fig_longer_t ] ) . on the other hand ,",
    "improper modes propagate at their own phase speed and so are subject to phase mixing , that leads to stronger dispersion .",
    "this dispersive behavior in turn causes a severe amplitude decrease that is clearly visible when comparing the red lines of figures  [ fig_vae2_delta1_short_t](a ) and ( d ) .",
    "the asymptotic behavior of improper modes for large @xmath140 was studied in section  5.3 of paper  i , that deals with a transverse initial perturbation .",
    "it was found that the contribution of improper modes decays as @xmath183 .",
    "the same applies to the present axisymmetric perturbation .",
    "+   +    at @xmath184 the perturbation of figure  [ fig_t=0](a ) , whose early development is presented in figure  [ fig_vae2_delta1_short_t ] , is spread over a long section of the tube of length @xmath185 ( compare this value with the initial length of the perturbation @xmath186 ) ; see figure  [ fig_longer_t](a ) . here",
    "the total perturbation of the radial displacement and the contributions of proper and improper modes are represented with the usual colors ( black , green , and red , respectively ) .",
    "the vertical lines denote the position of a point initially at @xmath187 and moving at specific velocities : the dash - dotted , dashed , and dotted lines correspond to the maximum group velocity of proper modes ( @xmath188 ) , the minimum group velocity of the fundamental fast sausage mode ( @xmath189 ) , and the minimum group velocity of its first overtone ( @xmath190 ) .",
    "this range of group velocities determines the length of the wave train at a given time .",
    "the wave train shape is controlled by two more features : the dependence @xmath191 of proper modes ( black lines in figure  [ fig_dr_over](c ) ) and the amplitude of the perturbation ( figure  [ fig_amplr](a ) ) .",
    "wavenumbers slightly above the cut - off occupy the leading part of the wave packet and have the largest amplitudes , but their @xmath77 varies strongly with @xmath72 .",
    "thus , these wavenumbers are strongly dispersed and contribute moderately to the wave train amplitude . on the other hand ,",
    "wavenumbers @xmath192 have group velocities in a small range around the minimum of @xmath77 and for this reason the maximum amplitude of the wave train is found near the dashed line of figure  [ fig_longer_t](a ) . a side effect of the wave dispersion",
    "is the decrease of the wave packet amplitude ( compare figures  [ fig_vae2_delta1_short_t](d ) and [ fig_longer_t](a ) ) .",
    "again , note the cancellation of proper and improper mode contributions ahead and behind the propagating wave train .",
    "we now investigate the effect of the initial disturbance length and the density ratio on the wave train dispersion .",
    "if the internal to external density ratio is kept fixed and the length of the initial disturbance is doubled ( figure  [ fig_longer_t](b ) ) the dispersion of the wave train in its constituent frequencies does not change because the group velocity of proper modes is the same .",
    "then , the positions of maxima and minima in figures  [ fig_longer_t](a ) and ( b ) are the same .",
    "nevertheless , according to figures  [ fig_t=0](a ) and ( b ) and figures  [ fig_amplr](a ) and ( b ) , a longer initial disturbance corresponds to smaller amplitudes of proper modes and for this reason the amplitude of the wave train is much smaller for @xmath193 than for @xmath194 .",
    "finally , we consider the case of a magnetic tube with a larger internal to external density contrast ( @xmath195 ; figure  [ fig_longer_t](c ) ) . in this case",
    "the minimum group velocity of the fundamental fast sausage mode and its first overtone are similar to those for @xmath196 and this implies that the position of the vertical dashed and dotted lines in figures  [ fig_longer_t](a ) and ( c ) are similar .",
    "but by increasing the density ratio from 4 to 9 , the maximum group velocity of proper modes increases from @xmath188 to @xmath197 and so the front of the wave train travels considerably faster .",
    "hence , the wave packet extends over a much longer section of the magnetic tube , with length @xmath198 .",
    "the leading part of the wave train has a small amplitude because of the strong gradient of @xmath191 near the cut - off wavenumber .",
    "in addition , the largest amplitude is found at the back of the wave packet , were , again , a wide range of wavenumbers with values of @xmath77 near the minimum group velocity concentrate their contribution .",
    "here we compare the response of the magnetic tube boundary under initial axisymmetric and transverse disturbances , respectively described in this paper and in paper  i. to make this comparison we consider the wave train passage at a fixed position ( @xmath199 ) and plot the radial displacement as a function of time ( see figure  [ fig_comp_kink_sausage ] , in which the left and right columns correspond to axisymmetric and transverse , which gives the radial profile of the initial perturbation , was different from that used in the present work ( equation  ( [ init_psi ] ) ) . in order to make a comparison with the results of paper  i ,",
    "the proper and improper mode amplitudes of transverse disturbances are presented in appendix  [ app_kink ] for the same @xmath200 . ]",
    "disturbances ) .",
    "+   +     +   +     +    inspection of figure  [ fig_comp_kink_sausage ] reveals the very different dispersive properties of fast sausage and kink waves .",
    "the first ones display rapid oscillations with period @xmath201 , whereas the latter have only one full oscillation with larger amplitude and period @xmath202 .",
    "this disparate behavior occurs because the fundamental fast kink mode does not have a cut - off wavenumber and its group velocity has a more moderate range of variation than that of its sausage counterpart .",
    "the length of the initial perturbation plays a different role in the propagation of axisymmetric and transverse disturbances . in the first case",
    "( compare figures  [ fig_comp_kink_sausage](a ) and ( c ) ) a longer disturbance imparts less energy to proper modes and the wave train disperses more quickly , with a stronger decrease of its amplitude . on the other hand ,",
    "a longer transverse disturbance ( compare figures  [ fig_comp_kink_sausage](b ) and ( d ) ) imparts less energy to the first overtone ( and so the trailing oscillations are missing in panel ( d ) ) and the fundamental mode receives more energy in the long - wavelength regime , for which @xmath77 has a small spread .",
    "this then results in less dispersion of the wave train .",
    "it is also worth noting that the first fast kink mode overtone leaves its imprint in figures  [ fig_comp_kink_sausage](b ) and ( f ) as small amplitude , short period oscillations that arrive at the detection point after the main pulse .",
    "finally , the small amplitude oscillations in panels ( a ) and ( c ) before and after the wave train passage are numerical artifacts .      the improper modes are closely related to leaky quasi - modes studied by , e.g. , @xcite ; see also the discussion by @xcite . the interference of improper modes will create a wave front propagating from the tube in the radial direction .",
    "the leaky quasi - modes describe the so - called intermediate asymptotic of this wave front ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for a discussion of the role of leaky quasi - modes in the case of kink waves ) .",
    "wave radiation after the initial excitation can be well appreciated by plotting snapshots of the dependence of @xmath34 with respect to @xmath156 for several times ( figure  [ fig_leakage ] ) .",
    "panel ( a ) shows the imposed radial profile of the radial displacement at @xmath141 , given by equation  ( [ init_psi ] ) , with improper modes ( red curve ) having a more important contribution than proper modes ( green curve ) .",
    "the subsequent temporal evolution of @xmath34 shows oscillations inside the magnetic cylinder ( @xmath203 ) and in its vicinity , together with a wave pulse propagating outwards in the radial direction , that is specially visible in panel ( d ) as a depression in @xmath34 in the range @xmath204 .",
    "this propagating feature is clearly caused by improper modes because the amplitude of proper modes at its position is negligible .",
    "the wave emission process has been presented here by doing the cuts of figure  [ fig_leakage ] at the center of the initial perturbation ( @xmath187 ) , but as far as the amplitude of improper modes is non zero , it also takes place at other positions along the magnetic tube when they are affected by the propagating disturbance .",
    "+   +     +   +     +",
    "in this paper we have used a method based on fourier integrals to solve the initial value problem of impulsively excited axisymmetric ( i.e. , sausage ) perturbations in a uniform , dense , cylindrical magnetic tube .",
    "the linear and @xmath1 approximations have been assumed .",
    "this method gives analytical expressions for the perturbations ( plasma displacement , density , velocity , and magnetic field ) that require the numerical computation of the two integrals in equations  ( [ expand_eigen - main ] ) and ( [ four_trans_inv - main ] ) .",
    "the accuracy of the results depends exclusively on the precision of the numerical computation of these integrals .",
    "an advantage of this method is that one can select which perturbations will be computed and at which spatial position(s ) and time(s ) .    the impulsive generation of fast sausage wave trains in a dense magnetic tube has also been studied before by numerically integrating the linearized mhd equations .",
    "most of these works use a cartesian slab to represent the magnetic tube @xcite . in the solar context",
    ", only @xcite have considered this problem in cylindrical geometry , although they did not take into account the dispersive behavior of the propagating wave packet .",
    "one of the key features of the present paper is the importance of the group velocity in the dispersion of a concentrated perturbation .",
    "concerning fast sausage wave trains , this was already acknowledged by @xcite and later by other authors ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in addition to this , we have emphasized the role of the length of the initial perturbation and the internal to external density ratio in the wave packet dispersion ( figures  [ fig_longer_t ] and [ fig_comp_kink_sausage ] ) .",
    "we have found that longer initial perturbations have much lower amplitudes because the initial excitation imparts less energy to proper modes .",
    "in addition , larger values of the density ratio lead to a wider wave packet that nevertheless has a larger amplitude because most of the oscillatory energy is concentrated in its trailing part . some of these results have also been found in a non - uniform dense slab by @xcite    we are now concerned with the observational implications of our work .",
    "one of the main conclusions of paper  i is that a spatially concentrated , transverse disturbance of a magnetic tube gives rise to non - negligible density perturbations that take their maximum value at the tube boundary .",
    "the reason for these density perturbations is that fast kink waves are compressive for longitudinal wavelengths of the order of the tube radius .",
    "the axisymmetric wave trains studied in the present work also generate density perturbations caused by the compressive character of fast sausage waves . to determine whether the wave trains propagating along coronal loops studied by @xcite ( and similar events detected in solar radio bursts , see * ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) are caused by fast sausage or kink excitations it is necessary to carry out a forward modelling of the magnetohydrodynamic perturbations to determine how they would appear when observed with available instruments .",
    "@xcite assumed that the observed emission intensity in optically thin coronal lines is proportional to the line integral along the line - of - sight ( los ) of the electron number density squared .",
    "they considered fast sausage and kink waves with fixed wavelength and different orientations of the magnetic tube axis with respect to the los .",
    "they concluded that the two wave modes generate similar amplitudes of integrated density variations .",
    "nevertheless , the integrated intensity alone does not govern the line intensity and formation of emission lines .",
    "@xcite took into account that it is actually governed by a complex , non - linear interaction between the density squared , the ionisation balance and emissivity , and the instrument response function .",
    "the important point here is that the ionisation equilibrium timescale of and ions in a coronal environment is of the order of a few to tens of seconds .",
    "the effect of the ionisation balance can be ignored only if the wave period is much longer than this timescale .",
    "otherwise , observed intensity perturbations do not necessarily behave like the theoretical temperature and density .",
    "therefore , to make a theoretical interpretation of the @xmath205  s oscillations described by @xcite a careful forward modelling of impulsively excited fast sausage and kink perturbations is required .",
    "@xcite ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ) studied the influence of los angle and spatial , temporal , and spectral resolution of observing instruments on fast sausage wave observables . under the assumption of equilibrium ionisation",
    ", these authors concluded that the intensity variation can be very low ( @xmath206% for 171  ) or significant ( @xmath207% for 193  ) .",
    "most of the intensity variation , however , disappears when considering the radiative relaxation times of the ions .",
    "another important conclusion of this work is that the intensity modulation has strong dependence on the los angle and on the spatial and temporal resolutions .",
