    "a bcs superconductor is characterized by a macroscopic classical ground state ( the condensate ) separated by a finite energy gap @xmath14 from the first excited states ( the superconducting quasiparticles ) . superconducting materials such as those used in quantum nano - electronics support a tiny density of midgap states because of electron - electron or electron - phonon processes .",
    "the first investigations of quasiparticle relaxation times were carried out in the seventies @xcite .",
    "inelastic electron - electron or electron - phonon interactions in the superconductors produce relaxation times @xmath15 and @xmath16 respectively , thus with corresponding characteristic energies @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "those energies for relaxation are accounted for phenomenologically by the so - called dynes parameter , in the form of small imaginary part @xmath19 added to the otherwise real - valued energy of superconducting quasiparticles .",
    "the dynes parameter corresponds to a single parameter @xmath19 for relaxation , accounting phenomenologically for both electron - electron and electron - phonon processes .",
    "if @xmath15 and @xmath16 have different orders of magnitude , then @xmath19 can be approximated by the dominant mechanism , corresponding to taking the maximum between @xmath17 and @xmath18 . once processed with a small imaginary part @xmath19 in energy , bcs theory produces the expected finite life - time @xmath20 for quasiparticles .",
    "the gap singularity threshold is also rounded , and , as mentioned above , a nonvanishingly small density of states is induced inside the superconducting gap .",
    "a few experimentally relevant situations reveal spectacularly the importance of taking relaxation into account .",
    "let us mention the noise of a two - terminal superconducting point contact at equilibrium @xcite where the direction of the current flow is reversed at random by thermal fluctuations , producing telegraph noise in the cooper pair current .",
    "the noise is inverse proportional to the dynes parameter in some window of parameters ( the smaller electron - electron or electron - phonon inelastic scattering , the larger the signal . )",
    "the following paper brings physical answers in a situation resembling that of refs .   and  ,",
    "in which electron - electron or electron - phonon inelastic scattering can not be discarded .",
    "one of the goals of the present work is to pave the way to a future theoretical investigation of the recent noise cross - correlation experiment of the weizmann group @xcite ( see the concluding sec .  [",
    "sec : planned - study ] ) . in view of refs .",
    ", this requires handling finite values for the dynes parameters as it is done here .",
    "high sensitivity measurements @xcite of dynes parameter smaller than @xmath21 in aluminum were reported recently , in connection with the realization of an electron turnstile @xcite .",
    "quasiparticle poisoning @xcite is not captured explicitly by the present - time version of our model , which is nevertheless predictive as far as relaxation due multiple andreev reflections ( mars ) coupling the quantum dot to the semi - infinite quasiparticle continua is concerned .",
    "now that the sources of relaxation have been introduced , it is a matter of fact that an additional terminal does not produce only small changes in physics : novel phenomena take place with three terminals , which were not there with two terminals .",
    "let us mention the appearance of a static phase variable for specific voltage configurations @xcite , leading to emergence of a josephson - like current .",
    "correlations among cooper pairs is the mechanism for this dc - superflow in a voltage - biased three - terminal josephson junction .",
    "[ fig:1 ] shows such a set - up , in which three superconducting electrodes are connected to a single quantum dot .",
    "( going from three to four terminals is a non trivial step which produces also unexpected effects : for instance , emergence of topological effects in a four - terminal josephson junction @xcite . )",
    "three - terminal josephson junctions have been the subject of experimental investigations in two different groups : with metallic structures@xcite , and with semi - conducting quantum wires @xcite . besides metallic structures @xcite , experimental set - ups in the close - by field of cooper pair splitting are realized with double quantum dots formed in carbon nanotubes @xcite or with semi - conducting quantum wires @xcite .",
    "as mentioned above , the noise cross - correlations of a voltage - biased three - terminal josephson junction were measured recently by the weizmann group @xcite .",
    "current cross - correlations were measured in this experiment , in addition to providing evidence for the predicted resonant thresholds related to the gap edge singularities@xcite .",
    "experimental evidence was obtained for supercurrent of `` quartets '' if the condition @xmath22 on bias voltages is fulfilled ( @xmath8 for the grounded @xmath6 , and @xmath23 for @xmath4 and @xmath5 ) .",
    "the previous pioneer grenoble experiment @xcite had already reported a similar anomaly for the dc - current response in a metallic structure , but without measurement of current cross - correlations as it was done in ref .  .",
    "a relevant modeling for the weizmann group experiment @xcite is that of a resonant double quantum dot connected to three bcs superconductors @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 , and biased at voltages @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "the initial theoretical proposals for cooper pair splitting @xcite were based on observation that pairs of entangled electrons can be extracted from a classical bcs condensate , and be split as two spin- and energy - entangled quasiparticles transmitted in two different normal or ferromagnetic leads .",
    "forming virtual states with four ( instead of two ) entangled quasiparticles is surprisingly possible in a three - terminal josephson junction .",
    "a quartet @xcite consists of four fermions emanating from two pairs in the grounded @xmath6 , which interchange partners , recombine as two outgoing pairs in @xmath4 and @xmath5 , and eventually disappear in the condensates of @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "the overall process is dc , and compatible with energy conservation because of the specific condition @xmath27 on the voltage configuration .",
    "however , the supercurrent due to the quartet or multipair mechanism @xcite and the corresponding noise cross - correlations @xcite are phase - sensitive , and individual quasiparticles made of four fermions can hardly be dissociated from the collective superflow in which those are embedded .",
    "the situation for the quartets has thus its own specificities in comparison with collective excitations such as quasiparticles in the quantum hall effect , having fractional charge .",
    "voltage - biased three - terminal josephson junctions are representative of a class of time - periodic quantum hamiltonians , which is a matter of floquet wave - functions .",
    "while realizing this work , numerical data accumulated , and a stage was reached at which physical pictures and interpretations emerged from those `` numerical experiments '' . in this respect , the fws - andreev viewpoint ( floquet theory combined with band theory in the context of superconducting set - ups ) appears to be the right starting point .",
    "more precisely , the fws - andreev resonances are organized within two alternating fws - andreev ladders arising from the two equilibrium andreev bound states at positive and negative energies .",
    "those fws - andreev resonances ( being nonequilibrium andreev resonances ) form `` ladders '' because those are replicated to infinity by floquet theory , due to the periodic time - dependence of the hamiltonian .",
    "an expression for the energies of the fws ladders of andreev resonances isolated from the quasiparticle semi - infinite continua is obtained within a few lines of calculations from bohr - sommerfeld quantization ( see sec .  [ sec : ii ] in the paper , and sec .",
    "vi in supplemental material ) .",
    "the floquet energies can be also evaluated with green s functions ( see sec .",
    "vii in supplemental material ) : after lengthy calculations , the fully nonperturbative bohr - sommerfeld quantization result is recovered only in a given limiting case .",
    "this provides evidence for the power of the fws - andreev viewpoint for making analytical calculations , as opposed to green s function based on resummed perturbation theory in the coupling between the dot and the superconducting leads .",
    "the fws - andreev viewpoint proceeds with a different perturbation theory in the strength of the exponentially weak processes coupling the quantum dot to the quasiparticle continua above the gaps , and in the strength of landau - zener - stckelberg transitions @xcite .",
    "similarities between an equilibrium dc - supercurrent ( in a phase - biased two - terminal josephson junction ) and the nonequilibrium dc - current due to the quartet or multipair mechanism in a three - terminal josephson junction are considered in the following .",
    "this discussion is based on the discovery reported below of several relevant low - energy scales in the current , and in the fws spectrum of andreev resonances .",

    "qualitatively , the behavior of @xmath179 correlates with spectral properties such as the fws - andreev line - width broadening @xmath180 due to the coupling to the semi - infinite quasiparticle continua of the fws - andreev ladders of resonances ( see fig .",

    "at equilibrium , the supercurrent is calculated solely in terms of to the spectrum of andreev bound states once the states at negative energy have received their equilibrium occupation numbers at zero temperature .",
    "a less demanding relation between the current @xmath106 through lead @xmath6 and spectral properties was addressed in the more complex situation of relaxation due to the generalized dynes parameter @xmath28 ( encoding relaxation due to the coupling to phonons ) , and of a coupling by mars to the semi - infinite quasiparticle continua .",
    "more precisely , it was demonstrated numerically that , qualitatively , the characteristic low - energy scales in the supercurrent @xmath106 through lead @xmath6 are related to those in the fws - andreev spectrum of resonances , because those have similar voltage - dependence .",
    "three low - energy ( long - time ) scales emerge in those numerical calculations based on keldysh green s functions and on the floquet - lippmann - schwinger dressing algorithm : first , already for a single fws band , the spectral line - width broadening @xmath180 of fws resonances is exponentially small in @xmath131 ( with @xmath14 the superconducting gap ) , due to the coupling by multiple andreev reflections to the semi - infinite quasiparticle continua above the gaps .",
    "second , the degeneracy of the fws - andreev two - level system is lifted by an amount @xmath159 at avoided crossings .",
    "third , the cross - over value @xmath181 of the dynes parameter @xmath182 is related to the speed of convergence of the current towards adiabaticity in the limit @xmath183 .",
    "the qualitative correspondence between transport and spectral properties is however not quantitative , which is maybe not unexpected .",
    "in addition , the current @xmath106 also couples to the fws - andreev wave - functions and to the populations of the fws - andreev ladders of resonances .",
    "given the complexity of the set - up , it is remarkable that simple ideas such as a weak version of this relation between transport and the spectrum can be used to understand qualitatively the numerical calculations of the characteristic low - energy / long time scales in the current @xmath106 .",
    "it is within the achievements of the keldysh dressing algorithm to obtain exact numerical values for the currents in the set - up of interest here .",
    "however , it is not within the scope of the keldysh algorithm to provide by itself simple intuitive physical pictures . a full solution of the fws - andreev viewpoint ( including calculation of the wave - functions and populations ) is more promising to obtain simple physical explanations .",
    "the present paper is a first step along this roadmap .",
    "cavity quantum electrodynamics experiments are promising to perform the spectroscopy of the fws - andreev ladders of resonances ( see for instance the recent ref .  ) . at present time , no obvious reason can be advocated on why the nonequilibrium fws - andreev two - level system should show experimental relaxation times much larger than that of the equilibrium andreev two - level system @xcite .",
    "however , further studies are required in order to determine whether quasiparticle poisoning can be reduced by the applied bias voltage . at present stage ,",
    "the best is probably to make the experiment without prejudice .",
    "it was found that the normalized voltage-@xmath176 dependence of the normalized line - width broadening @xmath184 of fws - andreev resonances is exponentially small in @xmath131 , which is the expected behavior : in the fws - andreev viewpoint , tunneling between the continua and fws - andreev ladders proceeds through a classically forbidden region of length proportional to @xmath131 .",
    "in addition , the normalized voltage-@xmath176 dependence of the cross - over normalized dynes parameters @xmath185 was evaluated , which is in the first place a quantity of physical interest . in the absence of coupling between the two fws - andreev ladders at voltage @xmath186 , the cross - over",
    "normalized dynes parameter @xmath185 corresponds to the inverse of the characteristic time scale for connecting by mars the low - energy quantum dot degrees of freedom with the quasiparticle semi - infinite continua above the gaps .",
    "thus , @xmath124 is the characteristic time scale for equilibration with those quasiparticle continua if @xmath186 .",
    "the characteristic time @xmath124 is of order @xmath187 if @xmath175 , where @xmath159 is the splitting of the fws - andreev two - level system .",
    "in addition , @xmath122 is multiply defined if @xmath188 , and much lower characteristic @xmath122 emerge for @xmath175 , with complex behavior of the related @xmath189 .",
    "the interpretation of the weizmann group cross - correlation experiment @xcite is the following : a train of quartets transmitted from @xmath6 to ( @xmath4 , @xmath5 ) is produced , followed by another train from ( @xmath4 , @xmath5 ) to @xmath6 , and so on .",
    "this is reminiscent of thermal effects on the noise of a two - terminal point contact at equilibrium but there , it is the quantum coherent landau - zener - stckelberg ( lzs ) transitions ( instead of incoherent thermally activated processes ) which change randomly the direction of the quartet superflow . in the experimental ref .  , temperature is sufficiently low that the thermally activated processes are negligibly small in the noise cross - correlations ( those are exponentially suppressed in the ratio between the bcs gap and the temperature ) .",
    "a noticeable difference between lzs transitions and thermal activation lies in full quantum coherence for the former , with possible correlations among huge numbers of cooper pairs .    the present results and those of the weizmann group @xcite share intriguing similarities : the time scale @xmath190 ( the inverse of the fws - andreev line - width broadening ) is possibly related to the overall coherence time for the absolute value of the current in this picture of lzs transitions .",
    "the scale @xmath191 ( the inverse of the level degeneracy at a fws - andreev avoided crossing ) is possibly related to the much shorter coherence time for the sign of the current .",
    "the energy scale @xmath181 controls whether equilibration is due to the coupling to the quasiparticle continua ( for @xmath192 ) or to inelastic electron - phonon scattering ( for @xmath193 ) .",
    "further calculations for the voltage and quartet phase sensitivity of the cross - correlations are required to determine the nature of the dominant equilibrating mechanism in the weizmann group experiment @xcite .",
    "in addition , gain of realism can be obtained by discussing finite temperature effect on the quasiparticle populations , and by treating double ( instead of single ) quantum dots .",
    "the recent experimental results of the weizmann group @xcite were compared in the same preprint to keldysh green s function calculations for the noise .",
    "the calculated current cross - correlations @xcite provide evidence for resonance in dc - current and cross - correlations as the quartet phase @xmath194 is varied at fixed voltage @xmath195 .",
    "this resonance parameterized by @xmath80 is strongly sensitive on the value of the dynes parameter ratio @xmath149 : the cross - correlation signal varies by one order of magnitude as @xmath149 is changed in the range @xmath196 .",
    "this ultra - sensitivity of current cross - correlations on small values of the dynes parameters is puzzling , especially with respect to what has been found here regarding the behavior of the current as a function of @xmath28 .",
    "this is why it would be also of interest to introduce @xmath28 in cross - correlation calculations , and to calculate the cross - correlations for @xmath29 smaller or larger that @xmath157 .",
    "the first question to be asked is probably whether the same inverse time scale @xmath124 controls the current and the noise cross - correlations . comparing with the experimental data of the weizmann group @xcite",
    "may then provide useful information on the issue of whether the quantum dot degrees of freedom are equilibrated with the quasiparticle continua in this experiment .",
    "this may be all the more interesting in view of the perspective on thermodynamics discussed now .",
    "final remarks are presented now , in connection with a perspective on quantum thermodynamics in three - terminal josephson junctions at the quartet resonance .",
    "a limit can be worked out analytically in which quasiparticles on the quantum dot never reach equilibration : the infinite gap limit . coupling solely to superconducting condensates does not allow for propagation of entropy ( because , in the infinite gap limit , each superconducting lead has the condensate as a single state , and a vanishingly small entropy ) .",
    "a small energy scale is expected in the presence of a finite gap and small @xmath149 or @xmath29 , related to the interplay with the finite line - width broadening of fws - andreev resonances due to the coupling to quasiparticle continua above the gaps .",
    "future evaluations of the heat current in a three - terminal josephson junction biased in the quartet voltage configuration can thus bring informations complementary to those presented above .    to conclude , those three - terminal josephson junctions can be viewed as prototypical examples of `` half - open systems '' .",
    "those systems share features of open systems ( for example : extended quasiparticle states above the gaps , finite current due to bias voltages on the leads ) with the apparently contradicting features of closed system ( for example : strong confinement of the quantum dot degrees of freedom , poor equilibration , sharp andreev resonances in the floquet spectrum ) .",

    "the calculations presented in the remaining of the paper correspond to @xmath204 , and , instead of @xmath205 , the contact transparencies are parameterized by the more usual parameters @xmath206 , where @xmath98 is the band - width . if dyson equations are involved , it is then convenient to view the @xmath205 terms as a self - energy . in this context",
    ", those @xmath205 are denoted by @xmath207 ( see supplemental material ) .",
    "a finite bias voltage makes the fws - andreev resonances qualitatively different from andreev resonances at equilibrium .",
    "for instance , mars due to finite voltage contribute to the width of fws - andreev resonances .",
    "mars produce only tiny relaxation at sufficiently low voltage ( exponentially small in @xmath131 ) , thus indicating that fws - andreev ladders of resonances are robust against relaxation due to the coupling by mars to the semi - infinite quasiparticle continua .",
    "however , if one wants to make experiments or to put this problem on a computer as it is done in the paper , other mechanisms for relaxation have to be taken into account , which will be dominant once mars become too weak at low bias voltage . from the point of view of numerical calculations , relaxation is encoded in the dynes parameter @xmath19 in the superconductors .",
    "it is argued physically in sec .",
    "viii of supplemental material that electron - phonon scattering is a natural candidate for relaxation on the quantum dot .",
    "once the dynes parameter @xmath19 has been introduced in the superconductors , then the generalized dynes parameter @xmath28 has to be also included on the quantum dot , because of a question of internal consistency of the description ( phonons operate both in the superconducting leads and on the quantum dot ) .",

    "i , ii and iii in supplemental material ) .",
    "the authors are aware that a finite @xmath28 is against recipes in the literature , and more especially against our previous work @xcite : the limit @xmath208 was taken , and , in practise , @xmath165 was implemented without questioning why @xmath165 is equivalent to @xmath208 .",
    "the smoking gun that nontrivial physics is related to a finite @xmath105 is that adiabatic theorem breaks down severely for a three - terminal josephson junction with two levels at energies @xmath209 ( in this case , the currents calculated with @xmath208 are not equal to those for @xmath165 ) ( see sec .",

    "i and ii of supplemental material ) , which provides evidence that our previous calculations @xcite for @xmath165 are mathematically correct in the sense that the currents take identical values for @xmath165 and @xmath208 . however , our previous work @xcite leaves open central questions such as those related to the speed of convergence of the current to its adiabatic limit value : the latter is found here to be exponentially small in @xmath210 , which , in essence , is due to the emergence of those low - energy / long - time scales of interest here .",
    "indeed , the characteristic @xmath122 for cross - over in the current to the adiabatic limit ( corresponding @xmath162 ) receives the interpretation of the inverse of an intrinsic characteristic time scale .    on a more physical basis , some modes of the quantum dot are almost isolated from their environment , which explains long relaxation times .",
    "for instance , heat transport is expected to be very slow at low bias voltage for the set - up in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] , because the environment of the quantum dot consists of three bcs superconductors which do not propagate entropy over large distances ( see the discussion in the concluding sec .",
