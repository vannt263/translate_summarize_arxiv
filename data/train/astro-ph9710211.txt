    "searches for signatures of the nuclear component in the tev range ( e.g. atoyan & aharonian @xcite ; allen et al .",
    "@xcite ) , for instance , have only provided upper limits .",
    "the existence of accelerated protons and nuclei can also be deduced from the presence of @xmath0-ray lines which these particles produce when interacting with the ambient medium .",
    "nuclear interaction line emission has so far been reported from solar flares ( e.g. chupp @xcite ; murphy et al .",
    "@xcite ; ryan et al .",
    "@xcite ) and in only one occasion from an extra - solar source , the orion complex ( bloemen et al .",
    "@xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "evidence is seen now in emission from the inner galaxy as well ( bloemen et al .",
    "these detections were obtained with the compton telescope ( comptel ) aboard the compton gamma ray observatory ( cgro ) .",
    "comptel operates between 0.75 and 30 mev , which is the energy regime where signs of nuclear interactions can be expected .",
    "the observed 37 mev emission from orion was tentatively attributed to @xmath2c@xmath3 ( 4.44 mev ) and @xmath4o@xmath3 ( 6.13 mev ) de - excitation lines .",
    "solar flare spectra show several additional lines from heavier nuclei ( @xmath5ne , @xmath6 mg , @xmath7si ) , mainly in the 12 mev regime .",
    "here we report on a search for such @xmath0-ray lines from the crab nebula , using comptel data obtained during the first five years of the mission .",
    "the crab nebula is an extensively studied 943 year old snr .",
    "the pulsar wind from the central , isolated pulsar supplies high - energy particles that synchrotron radiate ( shklovsky @xcite ; dombrovsky @xcite ; oort & walraven @xcite ) while gyrating in the magnetic field of the nebula ( kennel & coroniti @xcite ) .",
    "however , in situ acceleration has to occur as well .",
    "the radio - to-@xmath0-ray spectrum consists of a mix of different power - law components , separated by breaks ( e.g. zombeck @xcite ; de jager et al .",
    "@xcite ) , which seem to indicate three electron populations .",
    "the continuum emission up to @xmath8hz is associated with the optically visible nebula .",
    "the break may reflect the energy losses for electrons as old as the snr ; the average field of the optical nebula can then be calculated to be @xmath9 g ( e.g. trimble @xcite ; marsden et al .",
    "@xcite ) . consequently ,",
    "the electrons responsible for the torus of x - ray emission , the spectrum of which breaks somewhere between 60 and 150 kev ( bartlett @xcite ) , should have a lifetime of @xmath10 month .",
    "the inner edge of the nebula lies at 8 \" ( 0.08 pc ) , so it is clear that these electrons have been accelerated in or near the nebula .",
    "de jager et al . (",
    "@xcite ) discuss evidence for a third spectral break at @xmath11 mev , from early observations by comptel and egret ( also aboard cgro ) , which is addressed below .",
    "this would indicate another population of energetic electrons , with lifetimes of @xmath10 day .",
    "we present further evidence for this spectral break using more comptel and egret observations .",

    "figure  1 shows that the spectral break represented in the model begins in the comptel domain .",
    "we have fit our data and the first 3 egret points to the first term of the equation .",
    "we ignore the ic component of the model , which is valid because the ic influence on the used data points is negligible .",

    "figure  2a shows , in solid lines , this shifted spectrum from 0.7510 mev . for comparison , the unshifted spectrum , also shown in fig .",

    "the fit is not perfect , as indicated by the @xmath33 value obtained above , but no obvious systematic trends can be seen .",
    "the deviations from the model fit are below the 3@xmath43 level in the individual energy bins . in order to assess the systematic errors of our method we analyzed three monte carlo simulations of the crab up to 10 mev ( fig .",
    "2cde ) , assuming an e@xmath44 spectrum with an integrated 110 mev flux of @xmath45 @xmath30 s@xmath31 , as derived from the observations .",
    "it appears that with this input flux ( corrected for the phase selection , i.e. @xmath46 @xmath30 s@xmath31 ) our method generates randomly placed features similar to those in the observed spectrum .",
    "therefore , no significance can be given to the observed features .",
    "best fits of the simulations to power - law spectra @xmath47 give @xmath48 values of 0.9 , 1.4 , and 0.9 respectively , for 18 dof .",
    "for comparison , the best power - law fit to the observed data up to 10 mev has an index of @xmath49 , @xmath50(@xmath51)@xmath52 @xmath30 s@xmath31 , and a @xmath48 ranging from 2.6 to 3.0 , depending on the bin positions .",
    "the @xmath34 errors on the fit parameters have been calculated by increasing the @xmath35 with 2.3 ( lampton et al .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "since a mixture of line features ( including broad - line components ) may well be present , it can not be excluded that we overestimated the continuum contribution . on the other hand ,",
    "a decrease of the fitted continuum level would not exhibit clear evidence for known candidate lines ( triangles in fig .",
    "2b ) without introducing other features as well ( e.g. near 2.8 mev ) .",
    "gravitationally redshifted @xmath0-ray lines caused by ions falling onto the pulsar have not been included in the candidate lines , because it is unknown how deep in the atmosphere the particles would interact , and thus how large the redshift would be .",
    "much et al . ( @xcite ) reported that the crab unpulsed emission might be time variable .",
    "spectral changes ( e.g. the position of the break energy ) may occur on short time scales , possibly affecting the global appearance of our spectrum .",
    "time variability of the crab emission will be the topic of future study .    in order to obtain the cleanest data , we selected only 39% ( the unpulsed fraction ) of the available nebula events .",
    "however , as the emission from the nebula dominates the total emission from the crab , we have used the set of all available ( pulsar contaminated ) events for our analysis as well .",
    "figure  3d shows the total crab spectrum using all observations ; fig .",
    "3a shows the same spectrum ( dotted lines ) and the spectrum with shifted bins ( solid lines ) .",
    "the integrated 110 mev flux of @xmath53 @xmath30 s@xmath31 has been used as input parameter for simulations of an e@xmath44 spectrum ( fig .",
    "the best power - law fits to the simulations have @xmath48 values of 1.5 , 2.4 and 1.7 ( 18 dof ) .",
    "clearly , this is not perfect ; the deviations may result from the fact that we have used the actual observations as the basis for our simulations , so that the smoothed crab signal may influence our findings .",
    "anyway , the best power - law fit to the observed data up to 10 mev [ @xmath54 , @xmath55(@xmath56)@xmath52 @xmath30 s@xmath31 ] , has a @xmath48 ranging from 5.0 to 7.4 ( depending on the bin positions ) , which is a clear indication that the spectrum is more complicated .",
    "the main difference between observation and simulations is in the low energy range ; at 12 mev there is a hint for a broad feature .",
    "some evidence for this feature could in fact already be seen in the unpulsed spectrum of fig .  1 , but it seems more pronounced in the total crab spectrum . after splitting the data in two time intervals ( fig .",
    "3bc , observations 0 - 337 and 412 - 502 respectively ) , some evidence for this feature is seen in both spectra .",
    "we can not exclude , however , that it is associated with the pulsar , if real .",
    "the batse ( 351700 kev ) cycle 13 total crab spectrum ( ling @xcite ) , although higher than the gris and comptel points ( much et al .",
    "@xcite ) , shows a deviation from a simple power - law spectrum , which can be interpreted as a rise near 1 mev as well .",
    "if real , the feature could well be due to a blend of lines , or it could be the synchrotron signature of a different population of electrons .",
    "morphological comparisons of osse , batse and comptel crab spectra will be the topic of future study .",
    "comptel observations from the first five years of the mission were combined to search , in a fine binned spectrum , for nuclear de - excitation @xmath0-ray lines from the crab supernova nebula .",
    "no significant evidence for line emission is found .",
    "a reasonable fit to the off - pulse fluxes can be obtained with the synchrotron component of the model from de jager et al .",
    "( @xcite ) , giving a break energy of about 2540 mev . an indication for a bump at 12 mev can not readily be explained by known systematic and statistical errors .",
    "it is possible that line contributions or an extra continuum component have resulted in an overestimation of the single continuum component .",
