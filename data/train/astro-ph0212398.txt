    "magnetic reconnection is a basic plasma physics phenomenon of tremendous importance in many astrophysical systems ( tsuneta  1996 ; kulsrud  1998 ) , as well as in some laboratory plasma devices ( yamada  et  al .",
    "1997 ) , including tokamaks ( kadomtsev  1975 ; yamada  et  al .",
    "it has been studied extensively over the past five decades ( e.g. , giovannelli  1946 ; vasyliunas  1975 ; biskamp  2000 ) .",
    "historically , the first ( and perhaps still the most important ) application of magnetic reconnection has been to explain the solar flare phenomenon , and it is in this context that the earliest reconnection models have been developed .    the first theoretical model of magnetic reconnection was developed by sweet ( 1958 ) and by parker ( 1957 , 1963 ) . in this model , magnetic field is frozen into the plasma everywhere except in a very thin layer where the current density is so high that resistive effects become important no matter how small the resistivity is .",
    "it is inside this thin current layer that the actual breaking ( and reconnecting ) of the magnetic lines of force takes place , accompanied by a violent release of enormous amounts of magnetically stored energy , thus leading to the observed flare .",
    "the sweet ",
    "parker theory predicts that the current layer thickness , @xmath0 , scale as @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the global system size ( typically of order @xmath3 cm in the solar corona ) and @xmath4 is the global lundquist number ( here @xmath5 is the alfvn velocity and  @xmath6 is the magnetic diffusivity ; in the rest of this paper we shall refer to @xmath6 as the resistivity ) .",
    "correspondingly , the typical reconnection timescale is found to be @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the global alfvn transit time .",
    "it has been immediately realized that the resulting reconnection time turns out to be too long ; in the solar corona one typically has @xmath9 and @xmath10  sec , which leads to @xmath11 of the order of a few months .",
    "this is in sharp contrast with the typical observed solar flare duration of order @xmath12  sec .",
    "thus , since its early years , the main thrust of magnetic reconnection research has been to explain reconnection rates that are much faster than the sweet ",
    "parker theory predicts .",
    "starting from the 1960s , two major routes toward faster reconnection were proposed .",
    "one of them was to use the so - called _ anomalous resistivity _ instead of the classical spitzer resistivity used in the original sweet  parker model ( coppi & friedland 1971 ; smith & priest 1972 ; coroniti & eviatar 1977 ; kulsrud  1998 ) .",
    "the idea was that , as a current layer forms , its thickness becomes so small , and hence the current density becomes so high , that the drift velocity of the current - carrying electrons exceeds a certain threshold , such as the ion - sound or the electron thermal speed .",
    "this leads to the excitation of current - driven kinetic microturbulence , which , in turn , provides a more efficient ( compared to particle - particle collisions ) mechanism for the scattering of electrons ( via wave - particle interactions ) . as a result ,",
    "one ends up with a greatly enhanced effective resistivity and , hence , a greatly reduced effective lundquist number . when substituted into the sweet ",
    "parker scaling , this results in a greatly enhanced reconnection rate .",
    "in fact , controlled laboratory studies of magnetic reconnection have shown a good agreement with a simple sweet  parker model augmented with some ( experimentally measured ) anomalously enhanced resistivity ( ji  et  al . 1998 , 1999 ) .",
    "on the other hand , in the solar flare context , the sweet  parker model with anomalous resistivity gives typical reconnection times of the order of several hours ( e.g. , kulsrud  1998 ) , a great improvement over spitzer resistivity . among various anomalous resistivity mechanisms , the one most frequently quoted has been the _ ion - acoustic turbulence _",
    "rapid magnetic energy dissipation due to the iat - driven anomalous resistivity has in fact also been invoked to explain coronal heating ( rosner  et  al .  1978 ) .",
    "another possibility leading to shorter reconnection times was proposed by petschek ( 1964 ) .",
    "his very elegant model makes use of a somewhat more complicated reconnection layer geometry , while still relying on simple resistive magnetohydrodynamics ( mhd ) without invoking any new physics at the microscopic level .",
    "the _ petschek model _ actually does not predict a unique configuration of the reconnection layer and a unique reconnection rate .",
    "instead , this model encompasses an entire one - parametric family of solutions .",
    "each of these configurations has at its center a small sweet ",
    "parker - like layer , called the _ diffusion region _ , and four standing slow - mode shocks emanating from the ends of this central layer .",
    "the members of this family of solutions can be labeled by the width ( or length ) @xmath13 of the inner diffusion region . as petschek noticed , in the sweet ",
    "parker model the reconnection process had been slowed down by the very large aspect ratio @xmath14 of the reconnection layer .",
    "he suggested that the width  @xmath13 of the layer s diffusion region does not have to be as large as the global size  @xmath2 ; if @xmath13 can be made sufficiently short , the reconnection process will go much faster than in the sweet  parker model .",
    "the maximum value of  @xmath13 corresponds to the sweet ",
    "parker solution , which is , therefore , just one of the family members .",
    "the reconnection rate ranges from the slowest ( sweet  parker ) rate to the so - called maximum petschek rate , which scales as @xmath15 .",
    "we thus see that the relatively strong square - root dependence on the resistivity , characteristic for the sweet ",
    "parker model , is replaced here by a much weaker logarithmic dependence ; even for a very large @xmath16 , the resulting reconnection timescale turns out to be reasonably short , of order @xmath17 .",
    "this model had remained the favorite model of reconnection until 1980s , when two - dimensional ( 2d ) resistive - mhd numerical simulations by biskamp ( 1986 ) showed that , in the case of a spatially uniform resistivity , a petschek - like configuration fails to form and that a long ( of order  @xmath2 ) current layer tends to form instead , consistent with the sweet  parker picture .",
    "this finding has been confirmed in a number of numerical simulations performed by several other groups ( scholer  1989 ; ugai 1992 , 1999 ; yokoyama & shibata 1994 ; uzdensky & kulsrud  2000 ; erkaev  et  al",
    ". 2000 , 2001 ) .",
    "a theoretical explanation has been put forward by kulsrud ( 2001 ) .",
    "he noticed that , when the resistivity is uniform , the relatively large transverse magnetic field that is needed to support the standing shocks in the petschek model is rapidly swept out of the diffusion region by the downstream flow , while its regeneration due to the nonuniform merging is not fast enough . as a result ,",
    "the diffusion region s size  @xmath13 ( which kulsrud calls  @xmath18 ) increases until it reaches the global scale  @xmath2 and the reconnection rate , correspondingly , slows down to the usual sweet",
    " parker rate .",
    "this explanation has been confirmed numerically by uzdensky & kulsrud ( 2000 ) ( see also kulsrud  1998 ) .",
    "it has been noticed , however , that the key assumption leading to the above conclusion was the assumption of uniform resistivity ( which is a very common assumption in numerical simulations in general ) .",
    "simulations featuring a _ non - uniform resistivity _ have shown that a petschek - like structure does form and can be stable whenever the resistivity is locally enhanced in some small region near the x - point at the center of the reconnection region ( ugai & tsuda 1977 ; sato & hayashi 1979 ; ugai 1986 , 1992 , 1999 ; scholer  1989 ; yokoyama & shibata 1994 ; erkaev et al .",
    "2000 , 2001 ; ugai & kondoh 2001 ; biskamp & schwarz 2001 ) . a nice plausible theoretical explanation of this phenomenon has again been provided by kulsrud ( 2001 ) , who analyzed how a locally enhanced resistivity may lead to a more efficient regeneration of the transverse magnetic field through non - uniform merging and thus to the sustainment of petschek s shocks .",
    "in addition , recent numerical work by erkaev et  al .",
    "( 2000 , 2001 ) and by biskamp & schwarz ( 2001 ) has shown that the particular petschek - like configuration that forms in the localized - resistivity situation is characterized by the width  @xmath13 of the inner diffusion region being of the order of the resistivity localization scale , which in this paper we shall call  @xmath19 ( erkaev  et  al .",
    "2000 , 2001 ; biskamp & schwarz 2001 ) . we thus see that resistivity - localization mechanism plays a crucial role in determining the final reconnection rate .    from the point of view of physical reality",
    ", the main motivating force behind these localized - resistivity studies has been the idea that anomalous resistivity , being such a sensitive function of the local current density , may in fact be triggered only in a small neighborhood of the x - point , where the current density is highest .",
    "in other words , anomalous resistivity can enhance reconnection rate not only directly ( by simply being higher than the collisional resistivity ) , but also indirectly , via enabling the petschek mechanism ( by being strongly localized ) .",
    "this is one of the key ideas behind the so - called spontaneous fast reconnection model suggested by ugai ( 1986 , 1992 , 1999 ; also see ugai & tsuda 1977 ; yokoyama & shibata 1994 ; ugai & kondoh 2001 ) on the basis of numerical simulations .",
    "up until now , however , with the notable exception of the work by kulsrud ( 2001 ) , there have been no analytical attempts to combine the petschek reconnection model with any physically realistic model of anomalous resistivity , which would provide unique theoretical predictions for the main parameters of the reconnection region , such as the width of the diffusion region and the reconnection rate , in terms of the basic parameters of the plasma .",
    "the goal of this paper is to remedy this situation by attempting to build a simple theoretical framework incorporating a particular anomalous resistivity mechanism ( ion - acoustic turbulence ) .    in ",
    "[ sec - model ] we present our model of the petschek reconnection layer with a generic form of anomalous resistivity . in particular , in   [ subsec - ingredients ] we describe the basic elements of the model , e.g. , the sweet ",
    "parker relationships for the inner diffusion region and the functional dependence of anomalous resistivity , @xmath6 , on the current density  @xmath20 . in   [ subsec - stability ]",
    "we discuss possible solutions and explore their stability . in ",
    "[ subsec - rate ] we calculate the reconnection rate in terms of the model parameters .   [ sec - iat ] is devoted to the specific case of anomalous resistivity due to the iat ; in this section we make use of the well - developed theory of ion - acoustic turbulence to express all major reconnection layer parameters , including the reconnection rate , in terms of the basic plasma parameters ( such as the magnetic field strength , plasma density , and the electron and ion temperatures ) .",
    "we apply the obtained results to solar flare environment in    [ sec - flares ] and find a very reasonable agreement in terms of general timescales .",
    "we list our conclusions in  ",
    "[ sec - conclusions ] .",
    "we now describe our model of a petschek - like reconnection configuration that is formed in the presence of anomalous resistivity due to a current - driven microturbulence .",
    "this model is semi - empirical and does not pretend to describe any real physical system in full detail .",
    "we believe , however , that it correctly captures the most critical qualitative features of the reconnection phenomenon .",
    "our model represents a synthesis of the following three external ingredients that are combined to build a complete and , hopefully , self - consistent description of the system : + 1 ) the numerically - observed fact that , whenever the resistivity is strongly localized , a petschek - like structure tends to develop , with a characteristic width of the central diffusion region being of the order of the resistivity localization scale ( erkaev  et  al .",
    "2000 , 2001 ; biskmap & schwarz 2001 ) ; + 2 ) sweet  parker model for the central diffusion region of the petschek configuration ; + 3 ) a physically motivated model for the anomalous resistivity .",
    "we shall now proceed with the description and integration of these three main ingredients .",
    "let @xmath21 be the direction along the layer and  @xmath22 across the layer .",
    "figure  [ fig - geometry ] shows schematically the central part of the petschek - like configuration discussed in this paper .",
    "the shaded rectangular area ( of characteristic thickness  @xmath23 and width  @xmath13 ) in the center of the figure is the inner diffusion region where the electric current density is concentrated .",
    "this is the region where the effective plasma resistivity plays an important role and where the actual breaking of magnetic field lines takes place .    for definiteness",
    ", we use ampere s law to define the thickness @xmath23 of this central current layer in terms of the central current density @xmath24 and the outside magnetic field @xmath25 as @xmath26    in addition , suppose that along the midplane @xmath27 the current density has a certain profile  @xmath28 .",
    "we define the characteristic width  @xmath13 of the diffusion region in terms of the function  @xmath28 as the distance from the center @xmath29 to the point where the current density drops by a factor of  @xmath30 : @xmath31    similarly , we define the characteristic scale  @xmath19 for the variation of the plasma resistivity @xmath32 along the layer as @xmath33    in general , the two scales @xmath13 and  @xmath19 may be very different . however , as discussed in the introduction , recent numerical simulations have shown that , if the resistivity is strongly localized ( @xmath34 , where @xmath2 is the global system size ) , a petschek - like configuration develops with the width of the inner diffusion region being of order of the resistivity localization scale : @xmath35 .",
    "this important condition serves as the criterion for selecting a unique solution out of the entire family of petschek configurations .",
    "we shall call this unique petschek configuration an equilibrium configuration . in our present analysis",
    "we shall rely on this empirical finding as on one of the important building blocks of our model .",
    "note that , in general , @xmath13 and @xmath19 in this equilibrium petschek configuration may differ by a finite factor , so let us define a dimensionless parameter  @xmath36 such that the equilibrium configuration has @xmath37 . in our analysis it will actually be more convenient to use another dimensionless parameter to describe the equilibrium petschek configuration . we shall call this parameter  @xmath38 and define it in terms of @xmath28 as @xmath39 . the parameters",
    "@xmath36 and  @xmath38 are related to each other , but the exact relationship depends on the detailed profiles of @xmath32 and  @xmath28 ; it is , however , unimportant for the purposes of the present paper : we shall only use the fact that , since @xmath28 is a monotonically decreasing function of  @xmath21 , we have @xmath40 whenever @xmath41 ( @xmath42 ) and @xmath43 whenever @xmath44 ( @xmath45 ) . we expect @xmath38 to be of order one , its precise value depends on the details of the problem and must be determined from numerical simulations .",
    "the analysis in this paper will be restricted to a situation where @xmath46 , i.e. , the equilibrium value of  @xmath13 , is somewhat greater than @xmath19 ; thus we take @xmath40 .",
    "this choice is made purely for reasons of convenience , as will be elucidated below .",
    "we shall now describe the other two main components of the model .",
    "the second ingredient is the model for the inner diffusion region . in petschek",
    "s theory , this region is a sweet  parker - like current layer with the thickness  @xmath23 related to its width  @xmath13 via the relationship : @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the lundquist number for the scale  @xmath13 . here",
    "we shall take @xmath49 , the resistivity at the very center of the layer .",
    "then we can rewrite the above expression for  @xmath23 as @xmath50 this is a very important relationship that we are going to invoke many times throughout the paper .",
    "the next question is what actually determines the value of  @xmath19 and hence  @xmath13 .",
    "we suggest that these values have to be determined by the properties of the function  @xmath51 .",
    "we thus need to introduce the third ingredient , namely , a physically plausible model for anomalous resistivity , expressed in terms of a single function  @xmath51 .",
    "our choice of the function @xmath51 is motivated by anomalous resistivity due to a current - driven microturbulence .",
    "correspondingly , we here adopt a very simple , minimal model for @xmath51 , which , however , has to exhibit the following general properties : first , there exists a current - density threshold , @xmath52 , for triggering anomalous resistivity , and second , the rapid rise of  @xmath6 after the threshold is exceeded stops at some large but finite value  @xmath53 , after which @xmath51 continues to rise with increased  @xmath20 more slowly .",
    "thus we take @xmath51 to be a prescribed function whose behavior can be described as follows ( see fig .",
    "[ fig - resistivity ] ) : + 1 ) for @xmath54 , @xmath51 is constant and equal to a small collisional resistivity  @xmath55 .",
    "+ 2 ) at the critical current density , @xmath56 , @xmath6 rises rapidly , essentially jumps to a value @xmath57 . for our convenience",
    ", we actually introduce some small finite width to this jump , @xmath58 , and assume that @xmath51 is a linear function in the interval @xmath59 $ ] .",
    "the exact value of @xmath60 is unimportant in our analysis .",
    "+ 3 ) when @xmath20 is increased even further , @xmath61 , the resistivity continues to rise monotonically with increased @xmath20 , but in a much slower manner .",
    "( yokoyama & shibata 1994 ) . ] in particular , we take @xmath62 in this region , which is the case for ion - acoustic turbulence ( e.g. , bychenkov  et  al .",
    "thus we take @xmath63    we see that the dependence of the anomalous resistivity  @xmath6 on the current density  @xmath20 involves three parameters , @xmath52 , @xmath55 , and  @xmath53 .",
    "in addition to these parameters , it is convenient to introduce the critical layer thickness @xmath64 as a derived quantity : @xmath65    for the analysis in this section this generic level of description will suffice . in   [ sec - iat ] , however , we shall consider a very important specific example of anomalous resistivity due to ion - acoustic turbulence and will give specific expressions for these parameters .    here",
    ", however , we wish to make a remark concerning the manner in which we are going to use the above prescription for  @xmath51 . in our model , @xmath6 is determined solely by the local value of  @xmath20 .",
    "we realize , of course , that in reality the coefficients  @xmath52 , @xmath55 , and  @xmath53 will depend on the plasma density and temperature , and so will vary from one point to another inside the reconnection layer . in our simple reconnection model we shall , however , ignore this aspect and assume that these parameters are constant in space and time and hence the same profile @xmath51 applies everywhere . in other words ,",
    "@xmath6 is determined solely by the local value of  @xmath20 .",
    "we shall now use the @xmath51 dependence shown in figure  [ fig - resistivity ] to find the correct value of  @xmath66 that corresponds to the equilibrium petschek solution .",
    "first , the requirement that @xmath67 can be interpreted as follows . at @xmath29 ,",
    "let us have some value  @xmath66 and the corresponding value  @xmath68 .",
    "the requirement that @xmath69 means that @xmath70 .",
    "but , by definition of @xmath19 , @xmath71 .",
    "thus , @xmath66 is determined using function @xmath51 from the condition : @xmath72    the solution of this equation for a given @xmath38 can be found by drawing a set of parabolae @xmath73 where @xmath74 , and selecting out of this set those parabolae for which the points of their intersection with the curve  @xmath51 are separated by a factor of  @xmath30 in their values of @xmath6 , as shown in figure  [ fig - solutions ] .",
    "it is clearly seen from this figure that , for any @xmath40 ( and , hence , @xmath75 ) and for the general shape of  @xmath51 adopted in this paper , one finds , in principle , two such solutions .    the first solution ( curve  i ) corresponds to  @xmath66 lying on the rapidly rising part of the @xmath51 curve , @xmath76 $ ] , while @xmath77 .",
    "then , @xmath78 and hence @xmath79 .",
    "we thus see that the corresponding resistivity enhancement in the inner diffusion region is not very large in this case , just by a factor  @xmath30 over the collisional value  @xmath55 .",
    "the second solution ( curve  ii ) boasts much higher resistivity enhancement . in this solution",
    ", @xmath80 falls within the narrow rapidly rising part of the @xmath51 curve , and hence @xmath81    correspondingly , the resistivity at the center of the diffusion region is @xmath82    any petschek - like configuration with  @xmath66 between  @xmath83 and  @xmath84 , and hence with @xmath85 , will not be in a steady equilibrium and instead will evolve so as to increase  @xmath66 .",
    "indeed , if @xmath86 , then @xmath87 and hence  @xmath88 .",
    "but then , since @xmath89 , we have @xmath90 and therefore @xmath91 .",
    "as we know from numerical simulations , this leads to shrinkage of  @xmath13 .",
    "as we demonstrate below , this shrinkage , in turn , results in a decrease in  @xmath23 and hence in an increase in  @xmath66 .",
    "the evolution will then presumably reach a stationary state when ( the stable ) solution  ii is reached .",
    "now , which one of the two solutions i and  ii will be realized in a real physical system ?",
    "we suggest that , in general , the answer to this question is determined by the stability of the solutions with respect to a small change in  @xmath66 . in particular , we shall demonstrate that the first solution is unstable while the second one is stable .",
    "this will enable us to conclude that the system will evolve towards the second solution corresponding to higher @xmath55 and hence to a higher reconnection rate .",
    "we shall first demonstrate that the stability properties are largely determined by the relative size of the slopes of the function @xmath51 at @xmath92 and @xmath93 .",
    "we start by presenting a rather general stability analysis that works for any monotonically increasing function  @xmath51 .",
    "hence , in order to apply this analysis to our solution  i , we need to modify our @xmath51 slightly by assuming that this function has a non - zero positive ( although arbitrarily small ) slope @xmath94 in the region @xmath54 .",
    "we then discuss a somewhat modified treatment for the case when @xmath95 is exactly zero in this region .",
    "these modifications are not essential and the conclusion regarding solution  i being unstable is the same .",
    "so , first let us assume that @xmath96 but has a small positive value at @xmath54 .",
    "let us consider an equilibrium petschek - like configuration with @xmath97 .",
    "let this configuration be characterized by unperturbed values @xmath23 , @xmath66 , @xmath98 , @xmath13 , @xmath19 , etc .",
    "now , imagine that at @xmath99 this equilibrium petschek configuration is suddenly perturbed while preserving its petschek - like character , that is changed into a neighboring petschek configuration .",
    "this new petschek configuration is , generally speaking , not in equilibrium ,",
    "i.e. , it does not satisfy condition  ( [ eq - equilibrium ] ) .",
    "it will then evolve through a sequence of petschek states . for simplicity , here we envision the process as occurring in two parts with different timescales : the adjustment between  @xmath13 and  @xmath23 to conform to the sweet ",
    "parker structure of the diffusion region is instantaneous , whereas the adjustment of @xmath13 to @xmath19 occurs on a longer timescale . in reality",
    "this might not be true and these two processes may occur on the same time scale ( namely , the alfvn crossing time ) .",
    "but here we are only interested in the direction of the evolution , i.e. , whether the perturbed system will move away or towards the equilibrium , so our qualitative analysis should be sufficient .    in particular ,",
    "let us imagine that at @xmath99 the thickness  @xmath23 of the diffusion region is reduced slightly and hence the central current density is correspondingly slightly increased : @xmath100 where @xmath101 .",
    "an increase in @xmath66 by a factor @xmath102 leads to an increase in the resistivity at the center : @xmath103    for the system to remain a valid petschek solution , we require that the inner diffusion region remains a sweet  parker layer at all times , so the width @xmath13 of the current distribution will automatically adjust to a new value , @xmath104 , which , according to equation  ( [ eq - sp - delta ] ) , is @xmath105 \\label{eq - perturbation - delta}\\ ] ]    this equation expresses the initial reduction in  @xmath13 in direct response to the reduction in  @xmath23 and hence to the related increase of  @xmath66 and @xmath68 in the sweet  parker model for the diffusion region .",
    "for example , if we are considering solution  i , @xmath106 $ ] , then @xmath107 , and hence the last term is dominant , i.e. , the initial change in @xmath13 is mainly due to the change in resistivity : @xmath108    similarly , if we are considering solution  ii , then @xmath109 , and @xmath110 so that @xmath111",
    ". then @xmath112    let us now ask what the new value @xmath113 of the width of the enhanced - resistivity region is and how it compares with the current sheet width  @xmath104 .    from equation  ( [ eq - perturbation - eta ] ) we see that the point @xmath114 moves to a location where @xmath115 is increased by @xmath116 over its unperturbed value .",
    "on the other hand , this increment is equal to @xmath117 .",
    "therefore , @xmath98 has to increase by the amount @xmath118    we have , by combining the expressions for the changes in  @xmath66 and  @xmath98 , @xmath119 \\ , .",

    "we can then write ( here @xmath123 ) @xmath124\\ , , \\ ] ] where @xmath125    by comparing this with the above result  ( [ eq - perturbation - j * ] ) we see that the change in @xmath126 is equal to @xmath127 \\ , .",
    "\\label{eq - perturbation - y*}\\ ] ]    this equation tells us whether the ratio @xmath128 increases or decreases from its equilibrium value  @xmath129 .",
    "we see that the result depends on the relative sizes of the slopes of function @xmath51 at @xmath130 and @xmath131 . in particular , in the case of solution  ii , @xmath132 , and then it follows from equation  ( [ eq - perturbation - y * ] ) that  @xmath19 is reduced by a lesser factor than  @xmath13 . as a consequence ,",
    "the resulting perturbed petschek configuration has @xmath133 .",
    "we then expect , based on the results of numerical simulation mentioned above , that in this case @xmath134 will increase towards  @xmath135 , thus negating the effect of the initial - perturbation decrease in  @xmath13 .",
    "in contrast , if @xmath136 , then  @xmath19 is reduced by a larger factor than  @xmath13 ; thus the resulting perturbed petschek configuration has @xmath137 . invoking again the results of numerical simulations ,",
    "we conclude that the system will evolve in such a way as to decrease  @xmath134 further .",
    "in fact , this scenario describes what happens in the case of solution  i , but its application to this solution involves some subtlety .",
    "indeed , notice that one can use equations  ( [ eq - perturbation - j * ] )  ( [ eq - perturbation - y * ] ) only if @xmath138 .",
    "thus , in order to apply this general analysis to solution  i , we need to modify the function @xmath51 slightly to make it monotonically increasing in the region @xmath54 . in other words",
    "we tentatively assume that this function has a non - zero positive ( although arbitrarily small ) slope @xmath94 in this region .",
    "this modification is not essential ; it needs to be introduced here purely for our technical convenience , to be able to use our general equations  ( [ eq - perturbation - j * ] )  ( [ eq - perturbation - y * ] ) . we do not actually need to rely on it in order to derive the same conclusions regarding solution  i. indeed ,",
    "if we insist on our unmodified function @xmath51 with the slope @xmath95 being exactly equal to zero for @xmath54 , then , instead of equations  ( [ eq - perturbation - j*])([eq - perturbation - y * ] ) , we can use an alternative argument to describe the response of solution  i to the initial perturbation .",
    "this argument is in fact even simpler and physically more transparent than the one described above ; it goes as follows .    since @xmath66 in solution",
    "i lies on the steeply rising part of the @xmath51 dependence , the central resistivity is increased by a relatively large amount given by equation  ( [ eq - perturbation - eta ] ) . on this part of the curve",
    ", we have @xmath139 , and so @xmath140 then , @xmath141 , and , therefore , @xmath142 $ ] , i.e. , @xmath143 .",
    "if the perturbed current density @xmath144 has a characteristic scale  @xmath134 , then @xmath143 implies that @xmath145 .",
    "thus we see that , as the principal effect of the initial perturbation , the size  @xmath113 of the resistivity enhancement region drops very sharply , whereas all other quantities change rather smoothly",
    ". then we can again invoke our empirical fact that a configuration like this will not stay stationary but will evolve so that the current layer width  @xmath134 will tend to decrease to become comparable with  @xmath113 , in agreement with our expectations .",
    "but as @xmath134 changes during the subsequent evolution for @xmath146 , there will be a feedback on  @xmath147 .",
    "indeed , since the diffusion region always remains a sweet  parker layer , @xmath147 and  @xmath134 are always related via equation  ( [ eq - sp - delta ] ) . since @xmath68 is a monotonically increasing function of @xmath148 ,",
    "we see that @xmath147 is a monotonically increasing function of  @xmath134 . for example , for solution  i , we can , using the fact that @xmath149 is always very close to  @xmath52 , approximate @xmath147 by  @xmath64 everywhere except where it appears in the combination @xmath150 .",
    "we thus can express the resistivity as @xmath151 and , substituting this expression into equation  ( [ eq - sp - delta ] ) , obtain @xmath152 we thus see that the decrease in  @xmath153 leads to a proportional increase in  @xmath154 . in a similar manner , for solution  ii we find , using equations  ( [ eq - sp - delta ] ) and  ( [ eq - def - eta1 ] ) , that @xmath155 . in either case",
    "we see that after the initial perturbation , the subsequent evolution of the system is such that  @xmath23 changes in the same direction as  @xmath13 .",
    "now we are ready to apply the above general results to the issue of stability of our solutions  i and  ii .",
    "we see that in the case of solution  i , the initial decrease in  @xmath23 and  @xmath13 tends to amplify further .",
    "this means that this solution is unstable : a slight increase in  @xmath66 will lead to further increase and thus the system will move away from the initial equilibrium , towards higher values of central current density and resistivity , until it approaches solution  ii . will presumably lead to a further decrease in  @xmath66 and hence an increase in @xmath13 , until the system reaches the stable sweet ",
    "parker configuration with @xmath156 and @xmath157 .",
    "this scenario , however , can only occur if the system s size  @xmath2 is tremendously large ; it is therefore of no importance to solar flares , as discussed below [ see equation  ( [ eq - eta_min ] ) ] . ]",
    "solution  ii , on the other hand , is stable ; indeed , as have shown above , after its initial decrease [ equation  ( [ eq - perturbation - delta - ii ] ) ] , @xmath13 and hence  @xmath23 will tend to increase , thereby reducing the initial perturbation .",
    "thus , in this case the feedback is negative and hence solution  ii is stable .",
    "it is important to realize that , in practice , solution  i is likely to be irrelevant for another reason ( in addition to being unstable ) . indeed ,",
    "real astrophysical systems , including solar flares , always have a finite ( albeit very large ) global size  @xmath2 .",
    "for the petschek model to work , we must have @xmath158 .",
    "this condition imposes an upper limit on  @xmath13 and hence , via equation  ( [ eq - sp - delta ] ) , a lower limit on  @xmath68 .",
    "for example , for  @xmath66 on the rapidly rising part of the  @xmath51 curve , this condition can be cast as @xmath159 if @xmath160 , then solution  i does not even exist for a given global size  @xmath2 . for typical solar corona conditions , collisional resistivity",
    "@xmath55 is so small that inequality  ( [ eq - eta_min ] ) is not satisfied ; in other words , one gets a very large value for @xmath161 , much larger than @xmath162  cm .    here",
    "is how the requirement that @xmath163 comes into play from the evolutionary point of view .",
    "as a reconnection layer starts to form , its thickness decreases rapidly until it reaches  @xmath64 ; after that , @xmath23 and the central current density  @xmath66 both stay approximately constant while @xmath68 increases rapidly .",
    "when @xmath68 reaches @xmath164 , the corresponding width  @xmath13 of the diffusion region , determined by equation  ( [ eq - sp - delta ] ) , becomes equal to  @xmath2 . from this moment on , the reconnection system can be described by the petschek model .",
    "the particular petschek configuration found exactly at this moment ( i.e. , when @xmath165 and hence @xmath156 ) is that of sweet  parker .",
    "if @xmath160 , then @xmath166 and hence is very close to  @xmath66 ; this means that resistivity is very strongly localized , @xmath167 .",
    "therefore , this configuration will not be at equilibrium , and the system will evolve through a sequence of petschek configurations with ever - increasing  @xmath66 and  @xmath68 .",
    "each of these configurations with @xmath66 on the rapidly rising part of the @xmath51 curve will have @xmath168 until the configuration corresponding to the stable equilibrium solution  ii is reached .",
    "we have thus demonstrated that a physical system with anomalous resistivity of the type shown on figure 1 will evolve towards a stable solution ii , which is characterized by the following values of the central current density and resistivity : @xmath169 @xmath170 the exact coefficients in these expressions require a precise model for @xmath51 , etc ...    finally , let us make a couple of remarks regarding our choice of  @xmath38 . in the above considerations we have assumed that  @xmath40 .",
    "notice that the case @xmath171 ( @xmath172 ) is , in a certain sense , degenerate : in addition to an unstable solution  i , one gets a continuum of neutrally stable solutions  ii that correspond to @xmath173 .",
    "our present analysis does not allow us to discriminate among these solutions ; they all appear to be equally plausible . if , however , one considers the unique stable solutions  ii with @xmath40 and takes the limit @xmath174 , then one arrives at a single limiting solution ( having @xmath175 ) .",
    "thus , we use this limiting solution to extend our family of solutions with @xmath40 to include the @xmath171 case",
    ".    however , if @xmath43 ( @xmath44 ) , then our present analysis does not work : one still has an unstable solution i , but no solutions of type ii exist , at least as long as @xmath51 remains a linear function .",
    "this suggest that the system will continuously evolve towards higher and higher values of  @xmath66 and  @xmath68 and hence the reconnection process will continuously accelerate until some new resistivity saturation mechanism sets in . in this case",
    ", the system will stabilize and a steady state will be achieved at a much higher level of  @xmath66 than the level @xmath176 discussed here .",
    "thus , we now have a stable steady state petschek - like configuration with the central diffusion region characterized by the thickness @xmath177 and the central resistivity @xmath178 . here",
    ", @xmath179 is a finite constant ; according to our analysis , @xmath180 .",
    "however , we realize that the simple qualitative model presented here is not adequate for providing any numerical accuracy ; it should only be used for order - of - magnitude estimates .",
    "therefore , in the following we shall just keep using the above expressions for  @xmath23 and  @xmath68 , parameterizing our ignorance by a constant @xmath181 .",
    "let us now ask , what is the reconnection rate associated with this configuration ? using expression  ( [ eq - sp - scaling ] ) we find the aspect ratio of the central diffusion region : @xmath182 where we define @xmath183 [ note : the parameter @xmath184 defined here is completely different from kulsrud s ( 2001 )  @xmath185 . ]",
    "the reconnection velocity is ( assuming that the density stays roughly constant inside the reconnection layer ) : @xmath186 and the typical reconnection timescale is @xmath187 where @xmath8 is the global alfvn crossing time .",
    "note that the aspect ratio  ( [ eq - aspect - ratio ] ) and hence the reconnection velocity  ( [ eq - v_rec ] ) turn out to be independent of the global system size  @xmath2 , but only depend on the local plasma parameters .    also note that our expression  ( [ eq - v_rec ] ) for the reconnection velocity differs from the result @xmath188 obtained previously by kulsrud [ see equation  ( 26 ) of kulsrud 2001 ] .",
    "we believe that this discrepancy can be attributed , at least partly , to a somewhat different functional form of the @xmath51-dependence adopted in his paper .",
    "in this section we assume that the anomalous resistivity enhancement is caused by the scattering of the current - carrying electrons off ion - acoustic waves , which are themselves excited by the ion - acoustic instability when the current density exceeds a certain threshold .",
    "the theory of ion - acoustic turbulence and the associated with it anomalous resistivity has greatly progressed over the past 40 years ( e.g. , kadomtsev 1965 ; rudakov & korablev 1966 ; sagdeev 1967 ; tsytovich & kaplan 1971 ; biskamp & chodura 1972 ; coroniti & eviatar 1977 ; bychenkov  et  al . 1988 ) .",
    "this theory is now very mature and seems to be capable of producing reliable quantitative results regarding anomalous resistivity . in this paper",
    ", we use the results presented by bychenkov  et  al .",
    "( 1988 ) .    following the analysis of ion - acoustic turbulence by bychenkov  et  al .",
    "( 1988 ) , we adopt @xmath189 where @xmath190 is the ion sound speed , and @xmath191 . in particular , according to equation  ( 2.143 ) of bychenkov et al . (",
    "1988 ) , @xmath192 .",
    "further , we compute anomalous resistivity @xmath193 by using the expression  ( 2.148 ) of bychenkov  et  al .",
    "( 1988 ) for  @xmath194 to express @xmath195 in terms of the electric current density  @xmath196 .",
    "we thus obtain @xmath197 we then estimate @xmath53 by extrapolating this dependence down to @xmath198 . using equation  ( [ eq - j_c ] ) ,",
    "we get @xmath199 where @xmath200    for a pure hydrogen plasma ( @xmath201 , @xmath202 ) , we have : @xmath203    as for @xmath55 , we take it to be the classical collisional spitzer resistivity @xmath204 where @xmath205 is the coulomb logarithm and @xmath206 @xmath207 being the electron debye radius .",
    "we see that we may expect a potential resistivity enhancement on the order of @xmath208    for this model of anomalous resistivity , @xmath64 and @xmath53 are given by expressions  ( [ eq - def - delta_c ] ) and  ( [ eq - eta1 ] ) and then we can express  @xmath184 as @xmath209    expressing the ratio  @xmath210 in terms of the composite electron plasma beta parameter , @xmath211 as @xmath212 , we can rewrite  ( [ eq - s*-1 ] ) as @xmath213 where @xmath214 where we substituted @xmath215 and made use of equation  ( [ eq - a2 ] ) .",
    "note that from equations  ( [ eq - def - delta_c ] ) and  ( [ eq - j_c ] ) it easily follows that @xmath216 where @xmath217 is the ion skin depth . substituting this very useful expression , along with equation  ( [ eq - s*-2 ] ) , into our equation  ( [ eq - aspect - ratio ] ) for  @xmath13",
    ", we find @xmath218 where @xmath219    we also get an expression for the alfvn crossing time for the diffusion region  one of the most important timescales in the problem : @xmath220    in addition , substituting equation  ( [ eq - s*-2 ] ) into equation  ( [ eq - def - tau_rec ] ) for the reconnection time  @xmath11 , we find a very simple relationship expressing @xmath11 in terms of the light crossing time  @xmath221 and  @xmath222 : @xmath223    for a pure hydrogen plasma ( @xmath201 , @xmath224 ) , we get @xmath225    note that in all these expressions @xmath226 and @xmath227 are to be taken at the _ center _ of the reconnection layer ( @xmath228 ) , while the magnetic field  @xmath25 is the reconnecting magnetic field _ outside _ the layer , at  @xmath229 , @xmath29 .",
    "let us now try to apply the above results to typical solar flare conditions and see whether our model is able to explain the very short time scale of impulsive flares . in order to be able to make quantitative estimates , we shall first need to discuss the values of some relevant plasma parameters .",
    "table  [ table ] lists the values of the key parameters of our model , along with the values of some fundamental plasma parameters , for two sets of conditions .",
    "both sets are calculated for fully - ionized pure hydrogen plasma .",
    "the first set ( column  iii ) illustrates the fiducial solar coronal conditions : @xmath230  g , @xmath231  @xmath232 , and @xmath233  ev . the second set ( column  iv ) corresponds to the fiducial solar flare conditions which will be discussed below .",
    "for the parameters in column  iii we see that the characteristic reconnection time turns out to be no more than an order of magnitude longer than the observed flare duration time ( which is typically of order @xmath234  sec ) , but it is , apparently , still not sufficiently short .",
    "notice , however , that the fiducial solar corona parameters used in column  iii may not be appropriate for the center of the solar flare reconnection layer .",
    "indeed , one can expect that the turbulence will lead to rapid heating of the plasma , resulting in a substantial rise of the electron temperature .",
    "we can then ask whether the electron thermal pressure at the center of the current layer will grow to a level where it becomes comparable to the outside magnetic pressure , @xmath235 .",
    "this is a very important question because , according to equation  ( [ eq - delta_c - d_i ] ) , the value of  @xmath222 controls the regime that the system finds itself in .",
    "in particular , if @xmath236 , then the diffusion region needs to be described in terms of electron mhd ( or hall mhd ) , the theory of which in the reconnection context has recently been greatly advanced by a number of researchers ( e.g. , drake  et  al . 1994 ; biskamp  1997 ; bhattacharjee  et  al .",
    "thus , we see that  @xmath222 is a very important parameter , whose value may have a profound influence on the applicability of the anomalous resistivity model adopted in this paper .",
    "let us now ask what value for  @xmath222 one can expect in the case of magnetic reconnection in solar corona .",
    "first , notice that it seems inevitable that , if there is no axial ( or guide ) magnetic field component , that is when @xmath237 , then one has to have @xmath235 .",
    "indeed , in this case the basic requirement of pressure balance across the current layer dictates that the plasma pressure at the center of the layer s diffusion region be equal to the pressure of the magnetic field outside of the layer .",
    "this means that @xmath238 when @xmath239 ( and hence the ion pressure inside the layer is negligible ) and @xmath240 when @xmath241 ( and hence the ion pressure is equal to the electron pressure for pure hydrogen plasma ) .",
    "this conclusion holds regardless of the energy budget balance . for example , if there is no effective cooling mechanism , then the electron density  @xmath226 does not change significantly ( i.e. , by more than a factor of order one ) , whereas the temperature increases up to the `` equipartition level '' , @xmath242 , which is about @xmath243  k for @xmath244  @xmath232 and @xmath230  g. on the other hand , if there is some effective cooling , the plasma temperature can not reach such a high value and then the density is increased instead to maintain the pressure balance across the layer . in either case",
    ", one finds @xmath235 and hence , according to equation  ( [ eq - delta_c - d_i ] ) , @xmath245 .",
    "this means that the system will require a hall - mhd description as soon as , or even before , the anomalous resistivity becomes important .    in the case of solar flares , however , it is unclear whether this situation is present .",
    "indeed , there exist a possibility for maintaining the pressure balance across the layer with @xmath246 .",
    "this scenario requires two things , both likely to be relevant in solar flare environment : the presence of a non - zero axial component of the magnetic field  @xmath247 and some plasma cooling mechanism . indeed ,",
    "when the plasma is cooled efficiently , the increase in thermal pressure that is required to maintain the pressure balance can not come from the increase in temperature , and so the plasma tends to compress inside the reconnection layer .",
    "this , in turn , leads to the proportional compression of the guide field component ( here we are neglecting the resistive decoupling between the guide field and the plasma ) : @xmath248 ( here the subscript `` inside''corresponds to the center of the reconnection layer , @xmath228 , whereas the subscript `` outside '' corresponds to the plasma above the layer , @xmath29 , @xmath249 . )",
    "if cooling is so strong that the resulting central temperature is small compared with the equipartition temperature , then the plasma pressure can be neglected in the pressure balance .",
    "the pressure balance is then achieved with the increased guide field pressure inside the layer balancing the reconnecting field s pressure outside the layer : @xmath250    thus , @xmath251 is determined from the pressure balance  ( [ eq - pressure - balance ] ) and then the ratio @xmath252 determines the compression factor and hence the central density @xmath253 .",
    "typically one might expect @xmath254 , and so  @xmath247 ( and hence  @xmath226 ) is increased at the center of the layer by a factor of order one . as for the central electron temperature , it is going to be determined by the balance between the turbulent ohmic heating and the cooling due to electron thermal conduction . that a fluid element spends inside the diffusion region .",
    "] this is an important and very complicated problem and its detailed treatment lies outside the scope of this paper .",
    "therefore , here we shall give only some very simple estimates .",
    "the characteristic ohmic heating time can be evaluated as @xmath255 where the ohmic heating rate per unit volume roughly is @xmath256 so that @xmath257 where we have dropped numerical factors of order unity .",
    "we thus see again that , in the case where there is no cooling , a cold fluid element entering the reconnection layer will be heated up very rapidly ; in fact , the total time that the element spends ( and is being heated ) inside the inner diffusion region [ of order @xmath258 is long enough for the plasma thermal pressure to reach @xmath235 .",
    "if there is efficient cooling due to electron thermal transport , then an absolute lower bound on the electron cooling time is set by the time it takes a freely streaming thermal electron to leave the inner diffusion region of size  @xmath13 :",
    "@xmath259 then , equating @xmath260 and @xmath261 , we get a lower bound on  @xmath222 : @xmath262    this is the regime that is illustrated in column  iv of table  [ table ] .",
    "here , we use the following values of plasma parameters for our `` fiducial solar flare conditions '' : @xmath230  g , @xmath244  @xmath232 , @xmath263  ev , and @xmath264  ev , which correspond to @xmath265 .",
    "the resulting reconnection time scale @xmath11 is of the order of a hundred seconds , which is fast enough to explain the observed very short duration of the impulsive phase of solar flares .",
    "an upper limit on @xmath266 is given simply by the time that a fluid element spends inside the inner diffusion region , i.e. , the alfvn transit time  @xmath267 .",
    "this corresponds to the upper limit @xmath268 , just as in a situation without a guide magnetic field or without cooling .",
    "the electron temperature then grows to about the equipartition value @xmath269  k ( for @xmath244  @xmath232 and  @xmath230  g ) .    here",
    "are a few more numbers : + 23 , 45.32 , 18650 , -0.652 . :)",
    "thus , we can constrain @xmath222 to lie between @xmath270 and @xmath268 .",
    "we then see from equation  ( [ eq - delta_c - d_i ] ) that even in the case of the lowest possible  @xmath222 , the thickness  @xmath23 of the inner reconnection layer is roughly of the same order of magnitude as  @xmath271 .",
    "this suggests that the hall - mhd regime is likely to be at least marginally important in the physics of solar flares . in this case",
    "the nature of anomalous dissipative processes may differ from the simple effective resistivity @xmath51 due to ion - acoustic turbulence as described in ",
    "[ sec - iat ] and thus a more elaborate theory is needed .",
    "finally let us address one more question related to the applicability of the ion - acoustic regime .",
    "one can raise the objection that , in order to excite ion - acoustic instability , the condition @xmath239 needs to be satisfied ; if instead the plasma is nearly isothermal , with @xmath272 , then buneman instability ( buneman 1959 ) can in principle be excited , but at a higher current - density threshold , @xmath273 . to address this problem ,",
    "let us consider a plasma that initially ( i.e. , before the onset of reconnection ) is isothermal .",
    "as the reconnection current layer is been formed , the current density in the layer gradually increases and finally reaches the buneman instability threshold ( calculated for the initial , relatively low temperature @xmath274 k ) .",
    "the subsequent development of the instability leads to anomalous turbulent heating ( sagdeev  1967 ; biskamp & chodura 1973 ; bychenkov  et  al .",
    "1988 ; kingsep  1991 ) , which raises the electron temperature faster than the ion temperature . at some point ,",
    "the electron temperature becomes much higher than the ion temperature and the ion - acoustic instability is excited .",
    "such a transition from the buneman regime to the ion - acoustic regime has in fact been studied previously ( see bychenkov  et  al . 1988 and references therein ) . in magnetic reconnection context , a possibility of this transition has recently been discussed briefly by roussev  et  al .",
    "one complication , however , is that , since the plasma is constantly moving through the vicinity of the neutral point , then , in order to sustain the iat , one needs to pre - heat the electrons ( relative to the ions ) in every fluid element that is just entering the diffusion region .",
    "this means that some sort of anomalous heat leakage across the magnetic field is probably needed .",
    "whether and how this can be achieved is a difficult question , which falls outside of the scope of the present study .",
    "in this paper we have presented a model of magnetic reconnection in the presence of a current - driven enhanced anomalous resistivity .",
    "this is a very simplistic , crude model that aims at predicting the qualitative behavior of the system and the scaling of the reconnection rate with various plasma parameters , while treating numerical factors of order one only very approximately .    in this model",
    "we have combined the following three ingredients .",
    "the first one is the observation , derived from several recent resistive - mhd numerical simulations ( erkaev  et  al .",
    "2000 , 2001 ; biskamp & schwarz 2001 ) , that whenever the resistivity is strongly localized , the reconnecting system will develop a petschek - like configuration , with the width of the inner diffusion region of the order of the resistivity localization scale . the second ingredient of our model is the sweet  parker model ( sweet  1958 ; parker 1957 , 1963 ) for the diffusion region of a petschek configuration ( petschek  1964 ) . finally , the third ingredient is a physically realistic model for a current - driven anomalous resistivity expressed as a function  @xmath51 , which exhibits two characteristic features .",
    "the first feature is a sudden jump of  @xmath6 from a small collisional value  @xmath55 to a much larger value  @xmath53 as soon as  @xmath20 exceeds a threshold  @xmath52 .",
    "the second feature is a subsequent linear growth @xmath110 for  @xmath275 .",
    "this choice is motivated by the theory of anomalous resistivity due to ion - acoustic turbulence , which has been developed in detail over the last 40 years ( see , e.g. , bychenkov et al .",
    "1988 ) .",
    "note that the anomalous resistivity function adopted in this paper becomes very sensitive to electric current density when the latter exceeds some threshold value  @xmath52 ; this makes it possible for the resistivity to be enhanced only in a small region , which , in turn , leads to the development of a petschek - like configuration .",
    "thus , our model is characterized by a reconnection rate that is enhanced ( with respect to the classical , collisional - resistivity sweet ",
    "parker rate ) by a combined action of anomalous resistivity and of the petschek mechanism .",
    "it is important to realize that the role of anomalous resistivity in the acceleration of the reconnection process is two - fold : in addition to its direct action ( lowering the global lundquist number @xmath276 ) , it accelerates reconnection indirectly , by turning on the petschek mechanism .",
    "the width of the inner diffusion region of the petschek model , and thus the resistivity localization scale , are determined self - consistently when all the ingredients of the model are taken into account .    based on our stability analysis of two possible petschek - like states , we predict that the system will evolve towards a certain stable petschek - like configuration .",
    "this stable configuration is characterized by the central current density @xmath66 and the central resistivity @xmath68 exceeding @xmath52 and @xmath53 , respectively , by a finite factor of order one .",
    "the reconnection velocity then scales as @xmath277 , where @xmath278 is the critical thickness of the layer .",
    "we then consider ( in   [ sec - iat ] ) the case of anomalous resistivity due to ion - acoustic turbulence , as an important specific example .",
    "we derive very simple expressions for the parameters of the reconnection system ( e.g. , the width  @xmath13 of the diffusion region , reconnection velocity @xmath279 , and the reconnection time scale @xmath11 ) in terms of the basic plasma parameters @xmath226 , @xmath227 , @xmath280 , and  @xmath25 .    finally , in   [ sec - flares ] , we apply our model to the solar flare environment .",
    "we note that reconnection process will lead to significant electron heating , so that the electron pressure at the center of the reconnection layer may become comparable to the pressure of the reconnecting magnetic field outside the layer . based on our model , we obtain typical reconnection times of order @xmath281 sec ; this is short enough to explain the very fast time scale of impulsive flares .",
    "we note however that , as a result of the plasma heating inside the reconnection layer , the thickness @xmath23 of the diffusion region quickly becomes comparable to , or even smaller than , the ion skin - depth , @xmath282 . at these scales , new physical processes ,",
    "described by hall mhd , may come into play ( drake  et  al .",
    "1994 ; biskamp  1997 ; bhattacharjee  et  al .",
    "2001 ) even before the iat develops and anomalous resistivity becomes important .",
