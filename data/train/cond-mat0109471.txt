    "one of the most efficient tools in the superconductivity theory is the method of the quasiclassical green s function@xcite . in recent decades",
    ", the quasiclassical technique has been successfully applied to a broad variety problems .",
    "efficiency of the quasiclassical theory is due to the fact that it allows one to get description directly on the large spatial and temporal scales relevant for superconductivity , completely eliminating from the theory short `` quantum '' scales given by the fermi wave length . ignoring fine features on the quantum scale ,",
    "the theory gives a closed set of equations for smoothly varying envelops .",
    "the quasiclassical approximation is applicable in superconductors because the order parameter @xmath0 varies on the coherence length @xmath1 , which usually much exceeds the fermi wave length @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 being the fermi velocity and momentum , respectively . as first discussed by andreev@xcite",
    ", the slow spatial modulations of the order parameter can not significantly change the momentum .",
    "then , the two - component wave function @xmath5 can be presented as @xmath6 where @xmath7 and @xmath8 are functions which slowly vary along a straight line , a classical trajectory corresponding to the momentum @xmath9@xcite . after the factorization",
    ", the fermi wave length does not enter the theory anymore .",
    "the quasiclassical condition is violated if the potential energy varies on a scale of order of @xmath10 e.g. when disorder ( impurities ) or interfaces are present .",
    "disorder does not pose any difficulty as long as one is interested only in the impurity averaged properties : on average , disorder enters the equations via the self - energy , acting like a smooth effective potential .",
    "scattering by an isolated interface also does not create conceptional difficulties to the quasiclassical theory : one can include the reflection and transmission events by an appropriate boundary condition for the andreev wave function  @xcite or the green s function @xcite .",
    "it is worthwhile to notice at this point that the quasiclassical scheme does _ not _ give correct results for quantities local in the @xmath11 phase space .",
    "for instance , a particle with the momentum @xmath12 reflected from a wall creates the density , @xmath13 , which oscillates on the fermi wave length due to the interference term @xmath14 .",
    "however , the interference pattern , which is very sensitive to the value of @xmath12 , _ i.e. _ the direction of incidence , disappears after integration in a small region of the incidence angle .",
    "although the quasiclassical technique ignores the interference of the incident and reflected wave , it gives correct predictions for coarse - grained averages : observables like e.g. the electric current density , are given by the integral over the momentum space , and the low resolution description suffices .    in many interesting cases such as domains in the high - t@xmath15 oxides or artificial mesoscopic structures ,",
    "a few partially reflecting interfaces are present . in a multi - layer geometry ,",
    "the quasiclassical method meets severe difficulties as noted in ref .  .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to identify the physics behind the difficulties and check the validity of the recently suggested quasiclassical scheme by a numeric comparison with exact results for a double - layer structure .",
    "we attribute the difficulties in the theory to the existence of interfering paths formed by sequential reflections in a multi - layer structure .",
    "consider , for instance , a sandwich built of two superconductors , left and right , of finite thicknesses , @xmath16 with a partially transparent interface , fig .",
    "[ sandwich](a ) .",
    "we assume that the outer walls and the interface are ideal so that all the reflections and transmissions are specular .",

    "one comes to the conclusion that the andreev factorisation , @xmath6 , which is the essence of the quasiclassical method , becomes impossible .",
    "it is clear that the loop contribution is very sensitive to geometry and surface roughness . indeed",
    ", ( independent ) variations of @xmath21 on the scale of @xmath10 destroy the interference . besides",
    ", loops exist only if the trajectories which are split by knot @xmath17 in fig.[sandwich ] meet again on knot @xmath22",
    ". this may happen only in an ideal structure ; any imperfection on a scale @xmath23 would not allow this `` accidental '' event to happen .",
    "( in other words , any real physical system is non - integrable . ) in a real system , multiple reflections / transmissions lead to the formation of single - connected tree - like trajectories as has been discussed in ref .  .",
    "the quasiclassical technique is expected to be applicable if one solves the equations on the tree rather than on straight line trajectories .",
    "below , we compare exact and quasiclassical theories . for definiteness , we consider the trajectory resolved density of states ( dos ) obtained by both approaches .",
    "it is clear from the very beginning , that agreement may be present only on a low resolution level : strong microscopic variations of the exact dos in the @xmath24 space must be smoothen by integration in a small region of the phase space .",
    "even then , disagreement is expected .",
    "the point is that the exact calculations are manageable only for an ideal geometry whereas the quasiclassical theory is expected to be valid only when some roughness is present . in the ideal geometry",
    ", there are always loops which survive averaging in the phase space , and their contribution may spoil the agreement .",

    "we attribute the disagreement to the loop contribution .",
    "this point of view is supported by fig .",
    "[ fig : sqrtnota ] where dos is shown for the sample differing from the previous one only in a slight violation of the left - right symmetry . for this sample ,",
    "the disagreement is much less pronounced .",
    "this can be understood since in an asymmetric sample , the simple loop contribution averages to zero .",
    "the main goal of the study has been to check the validity of the quasiclassical scheme suggested in ref .   for the description of multiple reflections in layered superconducting systems . for this , we have compared the angular ( trajectory ) resolved density of states obtained from the full gorkov equation and the quasiclassical theory . from the comparison , we conclude that the approach based on the notion of quasiclassical tree - like trajectories @xcite is in qualitative agreement with the exact theory .",
    "some quantitative disagreement which comes as no surprise , seems to be under control .",
    "the point here is that the assumption about the tree - like character of classical trajectories can be justified only for rough interfaces when the system becomes non - integrable , whatever small the disorder .",
    "however , the exact green s function is calculated in the ideal geometry where the trajectories have loops ( as in fig .",
    "[ sandwich ] ) .",
    "we ascribe the disagreement to the loop contribution . choosing the geometry , we able to control to some extent the loop contribution .",
    "indeed , the disagreement is most pronounced in the symmetric `` sample '' ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : sqrtnot ] ) where the contribution of the simplest loops shown in fig.[sandwich](b ) survives coarse - grained averaging",
    ". a small asymmetry , which destroys their contribution , considerably reduces the disagreement ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : sqrtnota ] ) . note that loops always exist in the ideal specular geometry : even for an asymmetric sandwich , @xmath231 , a loop is formed after every second collision with the interface .",
    "these higher order loops are not destroyed by either the angular averaging or the averaging with respect to the layer thickness as in ref .   and .",
    "in our opinion , the difficulties with the quasiclassical theory reported in ref .   and originate in the contribution of the high order loops .    finally , our conclusion about the validity of the quasiclassical theory is as follows .",
    "the theory _ is _",
    "applicable for the description of a typical real sample where some roughness of the interfaces and surfaces is inevitably present . since real typical samples are most probably non - integrable , the trajectories are tree - like , and the scheme suggested in ref .",
    "however , the scheme does _ not _ include certain physics which may be of importance in some situations where the sample is manufactured to enhance the role of interfering paths .",
    "then , one should use the full version of the gorkov equations for the description of such a special system .",
