    "gaseous envelopes surrounding galaxies out to radii of 100 - 200 kpc are a common prediction of galaxy formation models ( e.g. , white & rees 1978 ; maller & bullock 2004 ) .",
    "generally the dark matter and gas in galaxy halos are assumed to be coupled . as the gas falls onto the galaxy it comes into equilibrium with the dark halo and",
    "is subsequently able to cool and rain down onto the galaxy s disk .",
    "absorption line experiments are one of the sole methods of tracing the low density gas as it cools and falls onto the galaxy . therefore",
    ", comparing the kinematics of a galaxy s dark matter halo to absorption line systems in the halo is a direct test of the radius at which the gas comes into equilibrium with the dark matter halo and the dark matter@xmath5baryon connection .",
    "several studies have suggested that a large fraction of the ly@xmath6 absorbers with column densities of n@xmath7 @xmath3 reside in galaxy halos ( e.g. , chen et al .",
    "2001 ; bowen , pettini , & blades 2002 ) .",
    "this has generally been derived from a correspondence between the velocity of the absorber and systemic velocity of the galaxy .",
    "chen et al . examined 34 galaxy - absorber pairs over a wide range of redshifts ( @xmath8 = 0.075 - 0.892 ) , impact parameters ( 18 - 250 @xmath9 kpc ) , and galaxy luminosities ( low surface brightness - @xmath10l@xmath11 ) to determine how the extent of a galaxy s diffuse gaseous halo scales with galaxy properties .",
    "they concluded that the typical l@xmath11 galaxy is surrounded by an extended gaseous halo of radius @xmath12 kpc with a covering fraction of 94% for gas with n@xmath13 @xmath3 .",
    "bowen et al . (",
    "2002 ) studied a sample of 8 galaxies at small projected distances from a qso and found that within 285 @xmath9 kpc of a galaxy their results implied a covering factor of @xmath14% for gas with n@xmath15 @xmath3 .",
    "these results suggest the galaxy formation scenario outlined above is on the right track for reproducing the observed baryon content of extended galaxy halos .",
    "it has also been suggested that these low column density absorbers ( @xmath16 @xmath3 ) are not related to individual galaxies , but are part of the extended cosmic web ( e.g. , dav et al .",
    "1999 ; penton , stocke & shull 2002 ; stocke et al .",
    "2005 ) . in various cdm simulations the absorbers trace fluctuations in the baryon density originating from the epoch of structure formation ( e.g. , dav et al .",
    "1999 ; zhang et al . 1998 ) .",
    "dav et al .",
    "find that at every redshift these low column density absorbers originate from diffuse gas in the unshocked intergalactic medium ( igm ) , while stronger absorbers are generally found close to galaxies .",
    "this is observationally supported by the work of penton et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , who find the median distance between a low column density absorber and a galaxy is @xmath17 kpc , twice the median distance between bright galaxies in their sample .",
    "they therefore suggest that the majority of the low redshift absorbers are associated with large - scale structures , rather than individual galaxies .",
    "to further investigate the relationship between galaxies and absorbers , studies correlating absorption line velocities with the detailed kinematics of the associated galaxy have recently been completed ( steidel et al .",
    "2002 ; keeney et al . 2005 ; cot et al .",
    "2005 , hereafter c05 ) .",
    "steidel et al .",
    "examined mg ii absorption line systems , or gas with column densities n@xmath18 @xmath3 , at redshifts of 0.44 @xmath19 . in the simulations discussed above ,",
    "these strong absorbers are generally associated with the gaseous halos surrounding l@xmath11 spiral galaxies .",
    "they found in all 5 of their cases the velocity offset of the absorption line was in the right sense to be qualitatively explained by an extension of the disk rotation to the line of sight .",
    "( the lines of sight are well beyond where the optical rotation curves were measured , by a factor of 2 to as much as a factor of 6 . )",
    "the extension of disk rotation was not a simple rotation model however ; the absorption line velocities had to be explained with thick rotating halo gas layers ( charlton & churchill 1998 ) .",
    "in contrast to the expected results of gas at large radii following the overall kinematics of the galaxy , the work of c05 finds several examples of gas which is not in rotation with the galaxy .",
    "c05 examined low column density absorption line systems ( n@xmath20 @xmath3 ) between @xmath21 kpc from the center of a spiral galaxy . in their sample of 5 low column density absorption line systems near galaxies ,",
    "the velocities of two absorbers can be fit by an extended warp or thick rotating gas layers .",
    "the other three systems can not be fit by any sort of extended rotating disk .",
    "in addition , ly@xmath6 absorption was not detected along 3 lines of sight that were more than @xmath22 kpc from the neighboring spiral galaxy .",
    "historically , the link between absorbers and galaxies has been investigated using optical searches for galaxies in the vicinity of the absorbers ( e.g. , mclin et al .",
    "2002 ; penton et al .",
    "2002 ; impey , petry , & flint 1999 ) .",
    "since the absorbers trace the warm - hot _ gaseous _ intergalactic medium ( igm ) , an obvious comparison is to study the _ gaseous _ components of galaxies .",
    "in addition , comparing the detailed kinematics of the galaxies to the absorption line systems has been limited to the studies discussed above , with inconclusive results as to the actual relationship . here",
    "we present arecibo observations of two edge - on spiral galaxies with absorbers @xmath23 kpc along the major axis of the galaxies .",
    "several questions with regard to the relationship between absorbers and galaxies are addressed , including : do the absorbers near galaxies trace gas in the galaxies extended dark matter halos , and if so , is the gas rotating with the dark matter halos ? ; do the absorbers near galaxies represent galactic waste , galactic fuel , or are they simply part of large scale cosmic filaments ? ; do the absorbers represent the presence of a low surface brightness galaxy , rich in gas , but not easily detected in the optical ?",
    "this paper proceeds by describing the arecibo observations and data reduction , and subsequently presents the results of the observations .",
    "finally , the implications of the results are discussed in the context of the questions presented above .",
    "this paper presents neutral hydrogen data of the regions around 2 absorbers in the sightlines towards pg 1211 + 143 and ton 1542 that are at similar velocities to the nearby spiral galaxies ic 3061 and ugc 7697 , respectively .",
    "these hi data are from the arecibo radio telescope and were observed as part of a large project to map the gaseous environment of 17 low - redshift ly@xmath6 absorbers along 4 sightlines .",
    "driftscan maps 0.5@xmath24 0.5  in size were made in november and december 2001 and april to may of 2002 around the 4 sightlines .",
    "each individual drift scan was spaced by 50 , and the integration time per beam was 14.4 seconds .",
    "twenty - one driftscan maps were observed for each source , resulting in a total integration time per beam of 302.4 seconds . a calibration diode ( cal )",
    "was fired at the beginning and end of each scan .",
    "cals that were fired while there was a continuum source in the beam were excluded from the calibration , as they do not give an accurate measurement of the system response .",
    "the beam size in the final gridded cubes is 215 , or @xmath25 , and the velocity coverage extends from approximately @xmath51035   to 12,750 . for this paper",
    "we concentrate on the cubes centered on the background sources pg 1211 + 143 and ton 1542 as these were the only cubes which had absorbers at a similar velocity to a gas - rich spiral galaxy .",
    "the other two sightlines and low redshift absorbers will be discussed in a future paper .",
    "the sensitivity achieved in each 5  channel is @xmath26 mjy / bm or 26 mk ( 1@xmath27 ) for the cube centered on pg 1211 + 143 and @xmath28 mjy / bm or 22 mk ( 1@xmath27 ) for the cube centered on ton 1542 .",
    "these values were calculated with the miriad imstat routine on line - free channels in the vicinity of the galaxies of interest ( ic 3061 and ugc 7697 , respectively ) .",
    "these limits correspond to a 5@xmath27 hi mass limit of 5200 d@xmath29(mpc ) and 4420 d@xmath29(mpc ) ( @xmath30v = 50 ) , respectively . using the distances listed in table 1 for the galaxies of interest here",
    ", this corresponds to 7.5 @xmath31  at 38 mpc for the cube centered on pg 1211 + 143 and 3.6 @xmath31  at 28.7 mpc for the cube centered on ton 1542 .",
    "the data reduction was completed with idl routines developed at the observatory .",
    "a robust median fit was originally used for the bandpass correction , but was found not to work in the strips that contained both a large galaxy and continuum sources because the median value contained emission .",
    "the solution that resulted in the maps presented here is similar to the method presented for recovering extended sources in the hipass data ( putman et al .",
    "each strip of 120 samples was broken up into 3 sections , the median was computed for each section , and the minimum of these medians was used for the final bandpass correction .",
    "the system temperature was subsequently removed using a robust mean over the channels of the spectra .",
    "twenty - one 0.5@xmath24 0.5   maps ( composed of 36 scans each ) were subsequently averaged together to obtain the hi data presented here . in the final calculation of the galaxies hi",

    "the absorption line data for the absorber closest in velocity to the large spiral galaxy for pg 1211 + 143 and ton 1542 are summarized in table 2 .",

    "the mass we obtain from the arecibo data is 1.84 times the mass they obtained from the vla , most likely representing the extended flux missed in the vla observations .",
    "in both of the cases presented here the gas detected in absorption within @xmath0 kpc of the center of the galaxy is not rotating with the galaxy .",
    "this result indicates that although dark matter halos are presumed to extend out to @xmath67 kpc in these types of spiral galaxies ( e.g. , using satellites and halo stars , kochanek 1996 ; prada et al . 2003 : or lensing results , koopmans ,",
    "de bruyn , & jackson 1998 ) , the gaseous baryons and dark matter are not directly linked at large radii . also , though we commonly use the gas to trace the dark matter content of galaxies ( e.g. , de blok & bosma 2002 ; simon et al .",
    "2005 ) , at some radius this no longer holds .",
    "what is that radius and what dictates when the gas and dark matter become tightly coupled ?",
    "figure 9 represents three possible scenarios for the relation of the gas detected in absorption to the galaxies .",
    "the gas could be in the halo and counter - rotating , in the halo and infalling , or in the halo and outflowing .",
    "the final possibility is that the gas detected in absorption is not related to the galaxies halos and simply traces a background / foreground cosmic filament .",
    "these possible scenarios for the relationship between the galaxies and absorbers are outlined below and the questions with regard to a dark matter@xmath5baryon link at large radii are also discussed .",
    "the idea of the igm feeding galaxies with star formation fuel has been developed in several models since the initial paper on the relationship between cooling gas and galaxy formation by white & rees ( 1978 ) ( e.g. murali et al .",
    "2002 ; yoshida et al . 2002 ; maller & bullock 2004 and references within these papers )",
    ". the models typically have cool clouds at distances up to @xmath68 kpc from the center of the galaxy , beyond the projected radii of the gas traced by the absorbers discussed here .",
    "the shock heated gas is decoupled from the dark matter as it comes into the galaxy , but must reach equilibrium with the rotating halo during the accretion process .",
    "it is possible the gas detected here has been recently accreted and is still coming into equilibrium with the rotating dark matter halo , but how does the gas begin to condense if it is counter - rotating with respect to the galaxy ?    in the case of our own galaxy ,",
    "the high - velocity clouds ( hvcs ) represent clouds of gas that do not follow a simple model of galactic rotation and have been proposed to represent condensing , infalling gas ( e.g. , maller & bullock 2004 ) .",
    "the hvcs have higher column densities ( typically @xmath69 @xmath3 ) than the gas traced here , but a comparison of the relative kinematics is useful if one takes into account the velocity component being measured for the absorbers is parallel to the galaxies , while the velocity component measured for hvcs is towards the galaxy at the position of the sun .",
    "the two systems studied here have the absorber roughly along the major axis of the galaxy and the infall scenario of fig .",
    "9 can be examined to understand the potential relationship between the absorber and the galaxy . for ic 3061 , assuming the rotation curve remains flat out to @xmath49 kpc , the gas traced by the absorber deviates from galactic rotation by -360 . in the case of ugc 7697",
    "the gas traced by the absorber deviates by + 153  from an extension of flat rotation out to @xmath62 kpc .",
    "however , one should also consider the absorbers are not exactly along the plane of the galaxies , and this may affect the expected rotation .",
    "recent work on the rotation of gas at high latitudes in spiral galaxies has shown that as you move into the halo , the gas is rotating more slowly , typically on the order of 25 - 50  slower at heights several kpc above the plane ( e.g. , swaters et al .",
    "1997 ; barbieri et al . 2005 ; chaves & irwin 2001 ) . taking this decrease into account ,",
    "the maximum effect possible is for the gas to stop rotating such that it has the systemic velocity of the galaxy at higher latitudes .",
    "therefore the minimum deviation between the velocities of the absorbers and the expected rotation of the gas is 32  for ugc 7697 and 202  for ic 3061 ( see table 3 ) .",
    "the velocity component measured for the absorption line system ( v@xmath70 ) , the unknown velocity component tangential to our line of sight ( v@xmath71 ) , and the potential infall velocity into the galaxy ( v@xmath72 ) for the case of ic 3061 are shown in figure 9 . for ugc 7697",
    ", the galaxy is rotating in the opposite direction and the absorber velocity measured ( v@xmath70 ) is still counter to the galaxy s rotation , so for the infall scenario the absorber would be in front of the galaxy , rather than behind .",
    "figures 10 and 11 show the magnitude of the tangential velocities and infall velocities implied by this infall scenario for the absorbers near ic 3061 and ugc 7697 respectively .",
    "if the gas traced by the absorbers is behind ic 3061 or in front of ugc 7697 , the tangential velocity component could potentially change the counter - rotating nature of the absorbers into infalling gas clouds .",
    "this infall velocity can also be compared more directly to the velocity measured for hvcs towards part of our galaxy .",
    "figure 10 shows the relationship between the tangential velocity ( v@xmath71 ) , the infall velocity ( v@xmath72 ) , and the distance ( from the galaxy ) to the absorber for ic 3061 for the absorbing gas to no longer be counter - rotating .",
    "this plot uses the magnitude of the absorber velocity along the line of sight relative to the galaxy .",
    "since as discussed above , the gas may be rotating more slowly at higher latitude than in the main disk of the galaxy , we use the minimum possible difference between the expected velocity of gas at that radii and the velocity of the absorber , or the difference between the velocity of the absorber and the systemic velocity of the galaxy .",
    "10 shows that with the magnitude of the absorber s velocity component along the line of sight relative to the galaxy at @xmath73v@xmath70@xmath73 = 202 , the infall velocity would be greater than 250  for all distances less than @xmath74 kpc from the galaxy center .",
    "this is comparable to some of the very high velocity hvcs relative to the galaxy ( the maximum is approximately @xmath73v@xmath75@xmath73 = 300 ; putman et al .",
    "2002 ) , and suggests infall is a possibility for the gas traced by the absorber .",
    "however , we note that many hvcs are expected to be closer than 150 kpc ( e.g. , maloney & putman 2003 ; putman et al . 2003b ; wakker 2001 ; maller & bullock 2004 ) , and placing the gas traced by the absorber at distances below @xmath76 kpc from ic 3061 requires very high infall velocities ( @xmath77 ) .",
    "figure 11 shows the same relationship between tangential velocity ( v@xmath71 ) , infall velocity ( v@xmath72 ) , and distance to the gas cloud for ugc 7697 .",
    "this gas cloud could more easily by infalling than the case of ic 3061 .",
    "the difference between the velocity of the absorber and the systemic velocity of the galaxy is only 32 , so with this @xmath73v@xmath70@xmath73 if the cloud is at @xmath76 kpc , the tangential velocity of the cloud would only have to be greater than 29  to have infall and no counter - rotation .",
    "the infall component to the galaxy would then be 43 .",
    "in fact , all of the possible distances from the absorber to ugc 7697 are consistent with the possibility of infall and comparable to the velocities of hvcs relative to the galaxy . however , this gas is also much further away ( at least 100 kpc ) than the distances to many hvc complexes ( e.g. , wakker 2001 ; putman et al .",
    "both of these absorbers may potentially represent the cooling , infalling halo gas before it has condensed to the densities of hvcs .",
    "the case of the gas traced by the absorbers being galactic waste from ic 3061 and ugc 7697 is difficult to reconcile given their positions roughly along the plane of both galaxies .",
    "galactic worms , mushrooms , and chimneys in spiral galaxies represent the possible blow out of enriched gas into the halo of a galaxy ( e.g. , english et al .",
    "2000 ; mcclure - griffiths et al .",
    "2003 ) , but are almost always seen extending up in galactic latitude .",
    "these features may be due to supernovae at high galactic latitude , where the nature of the diffuse material at high latitude allows the explosion to push through the main disk of the galaxy .",
    "in addition models predict outflowing gas due to multiple supernovae would subsequently fall back onto the galaxy closer to the galactic center ( e.g. , bregman 1980 ) , and the outflowing gas itself is not likely to reach distances greater than 10 kpc from the galaxy s disk ( de avillez 2000 ) .",
    "there is no known scenario where blown out material would start counter - rotating in the plane of the galaxy . for both of the galaxies studied here ,",
    "the absorbing gas is at distances greater than @xmath78 kpc from the edge of the galaxy s hi disk , an unlikely location to find outflowing material from a spiral galaxy .",
    "the last panel of figure 9 shows the outflow scenario for ic 3061 . for ugc 7697 the gas would be beyond the galaxy in the outflow scenario . in figures 10 and 11 we can turn infall velocity to outflow velocity to examine the magnitude of the velocity component needed to have the gas outflowing and not counter - rotating . for",
    "ic 3061 the outflow velocity ( within @xmath74 kpc ) would have to be greater than at least 250  for the gas to be outflowing and not counter - rotating , and for ugc 7697 , the outflow velocity would have to be greater than at least 37 .",
    "given the absorbers distances and positions along the major axes of the galaxies , away from active star formation in the galaxy disks and off axis from any outflow from the galaxy centers , these outflow velocities seem unlikely and the galactic waste model does not seem to be a plausible explanation for the origin of the gas .",
    "the only remaining galactic waste scenario is a low surface brightness satellite galaxy which has blown out most of its gas due to multiple supernova ( stocke et al .",
    "2004 ) or the presence of a structure representing the tidal destruction of a satellite , similar to the magellanic stream around our own galaxy ( e.g. , putman et al .",
    "2003 ) , but more diffuse , as the magellanic stream would have been detected by our deep hi observations .",
    "the next section discusses this scenario further .",
    "it is possible these two systems are anomalies , like the few examples of galaxies with counter - rotating gas in emission ( e.g. , hunter et al .",
    "1998 ; pizzella et al .",
    "this is normally attributed to the recent accretion of a satellite , or merger .",
    "there is no evidence for a recent interaction in the galaxies hi distributions to the deep levels of these observations ( figs . 1 - 8 ) .",
    "a typical cloud in the magellanic stream has a linewidth of @xmath79   and a column density above @xmath80 @xmath3 ( putman et al .",
    "our 5@xmath27 column density sensitivity to this type of cloud is @xmath81 @xmath3 ( ic 3061 ) and @xmath82 @xmath3 ( ugc 7697 ) .",
    "our beamsize at the distance of ic 3061 is @xmath83 kpc and @xmath84 kpc for ugc 7697 , while the magellanic stream subtends over 100  on the sky , or @xmath53100 kpc if you place the entire feature at 55 kpc from the galaxy .",
    "therefore a feature such as the magellanic stream or a feature @xmath85 the size and twice as diffuse would be detected by these observations .",
    "there is also no evidence for a recent interaction in the optical dss images of the galaxies ( figs . 1 & 4 )",
    ". the closest galaxy to ic 3061 with a velocity within 750  of ic 3061 is @xmath86 kpc away .",
    "for ugc 7697 , the closest galaxy within 750  is @xmath87 kpc away .",
    "a counter - rotating low mass satellite in the plane of the galaxy is the only remaining possibility , and an unlikely one for several reasons , including the following .",
    "the mass limit of our hi observations is 7.5 @xmath24 10@xmath88  for ic 3061 and 3.6 @xmath31  for ugc 7697 ( 5@xmath27 ; @xmath30v = 50 ) and thus any gas rich satellite galaxy would have been detected . for ugc 7697",
    "this is further supported by the higher resolution vla observations of c05 .",
    "satellites are very rarely found orbiting a galaxy in the plane of the galaxy , and are most commonly found on polar orbits ( e.g. holmberg 1969 ; zaritsky et al .",
    "1993 ; knebe et al .",
    "2004 ) .",
    "both of the absorbers discussed here have velocities similar to a nearby galaxy ( within 210  of the systemic velocity ) , but their relationship to the actual kinematics of the galaxy is somewhat dubious .",
    "a remaining explanation for the gas traced by the absorbers is that it does not have a direct connection to the gas in the galaxy .",
    "instead , the association between the galaxy and the absorber could be a general connection with the large scale structure of the region .",
    "simulations show that a substantial fraction of the low column density gas in the vicinity of galaxies connects with large scale structure , and not necessarily with individual galaxy halos ( dav et al .",
    "2001 ) .",
    "observationally , bowen et al .",
    "( 2002 ) found that within 37 - 290 @xmath89 kpc of a galaxy the covering factor is @xmath14% for low column density gas ( n@xmath90 @xmath3 ) .",
    "nevertheless , they were unable to definitively associate the gas seen in absorption directly with a single galaxy halo because of the complexity of the galaxy distribution in the region .",
    "a connection between absorbers and large - scale structure was concluded by penton et al .",
    "( 2002 ) by performing a correlation function analysis on a sample of galaxies and absorbers .",
    "they found that absorbers with column densities in the range of those studied here are more weakly clustered with galaxies than galaxies are clustered with each other .",
    "they also found statistical evidence that absorbers are associated with large scale filaments , as also found by rosenberg et al .",
    "the kinematic and spatial relationships between the galaxies and absorbers studied here and in the sample of c05 , provide additional evidence for low column density absorbers probing gas associated with large scale structures rather than individual galaxy components . the gaseous material traced by the absorbers may ultimately fall into the galaxy halos and fuel future star formation , but currently the gas does not follow the galaxies potential .    both absorption line - galaxy pairs in this sample reside in gas - rich and galaxy - rich regions of space , providing further support for the idea that the absorbers are tracing out a cosmic filament .",
    "ic 3061 is on the outskirts of the virgo cluster , where gas - rich galaxies and absorbers are very common ( solanes et al .",
    "2001 ; rosenberg et al .",
    "2003 ) . while ugc 7697 does not fall within the bounds of the virgo cluster , it is not far from the boundary and is probably still in a significantly over - dense region .",
    "figure 12 shows the sightlines towards pg 1211 + 143 and ton 1542 and galaxies from the updated zwicky catalog ( falco et al .",
    "1999 ) over a 3500  velocity range including the absorbers and galaxies of interest here .",
    "the absorber near ic 3061 along the sightline to pg 1211 + 142 is clearly in a denser region than the absorber near ugc 7697 along the sightline to ton 1542 , but clearly both are near a filament of galaxies . in the sample of absorbers considered here and in c05 ,",
    "the ugc 7697 - ton 1252 pair is actually the most isolated when a @xmath532 mpc radius around the absorber is examined . in another words ,",
    "all of the galaxy - absorber pairs lie along cosmic filaments rich in galaxies and intergalactic gas .",
    "it may be that the hi gas in galaxies is a better tracer of the location of gaseous cosmic filaments than the stellar component of galaxies",
    ". this would be true if much of the hi gas represents recently accreted star formation fuel from the cosmic filament .",
    "the link between a large sample of absorbers and hi galaxies will be addressed in future papers ( rosenberg et al . 2005 , ryan - weber 2005 ) .      at what radii would low column density gas traced in absorption directly trace the potential of the nearby galaxy and dark matter distribution ?",
    "we commonly attempt to detect the gas of a spiral galaxy out to larger and larger radii with deep hi or h@xmath6 observations to probe their dark matter content ( e.g. , corbelli , schneider , & salpeter 1989 ; bland - hawthorn , freeman & quinn 1997 ) , but our results indicate there is a maximum radius at which this method is effective .",
    "the idea of a link between the surface density of gas and dark matter was discussed by hoekstra , van albada , & sancisi ( 2001 ; see also bosma 1981 ) .",
    "they derived a mass model and applied it successfully to a sample of 24 spiral galaxies , but were unable to find real evidence for a coupling between hi and dark matter in spiral galaxies .",
    "our results indicate that if the gas and dark matter are coupled , or even if the gas simply follows the mass distribution of the galaxy , there is a maximum distance or minimum density for this relationship .",
    "the absorbers studied here probe beyond this limit .    both ic 3061 and ugc 7697 are spiral galaxies similar to the milky way in luminosity and hi mass and thus a reasonable total mass ( consisting primarily of cold dark matter )",
    "is @xmath91  ( e.g. , battaglia et al . 2005 ; moore et al .",
    "2001 ) . by examining the cold dark matter models of navarro , frenk , & white ( 1996 )",
    ", one can estimate the dark matter density at the radii of the absorbers . at 100 or 122",
    "kpc from the center of a @xmath91   dark matter halo , the dark matter density would be @xmath92  kpc@xmath93 and the material would be on the flat part of the rotation curve .",
    "clearly the dark matter would dominate over the gas in mass at this radii , even for an absorber that is 100 kpc in diameter .",
    "one option to explain the lack of rotation in the gas detected here is a truncation of the dark matter halo due to tidal stripping ( nagai & kravtsov 2005 ) .",
    "this tidal stripping would result in a lack of both dark matter and gas rotating at large radii . in the cluster simulations of nagai & kravstov",
    ", they find the average mass loss of sub - halos is @xmath5330% near the virial radius of the cluster .",
    "ic 3061 is considered part of the virgo cluster and in projection is 1.2 mpc from the center of the cluster .",
    "ugc 7697 is not considered part of the cluster and is 3.9 mpc in projection from its center . both galaxies are @xmath94   from the velocity centroid of the virgo cluster , but could be considered as being on the upper edge of the velocity range of the cluster ( e.g. , bingelli et al .",
    "the virial radius of the virgo cluster has been estimated to be 1.61 @xmath95 mpc ( mamon et al .",
    "2004 ) , so ic 3061 is a candidate for the tidal truncation scenario , but ugc 7697 does not fall naturally into this model . in support of the truncation model",
    "is the recent work on the dark matter halo of the milky way by battaglia et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , which indicates a truncated model may be necessary to explain the velocity distribution of objects out to 120 kpc from the milky way .",
    "lack of support for this scenario come from the recent results of prada et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , who examined 3000 satellite velocities from the sdss and found that galaxies are embedded in large halos extending out to 350 kpc .",
    "the regular structure of both galaxies hi and stellar disks also defies the scenario of a severe tidal disruption .",
    "finally , another possible model is that the dark matter and baryonic halos of the galaxies have slightly different shapes , i.e. , the dark matter halo is oblate , while the baryonic halo is spherical or otherwise ( e.g. , bailin et al . 2005 ) .",
    "the result of low column density gas not smoothly rotating with a dark matter halo may represent a limit on the density of gas that is able to come into equilibrium with a rotating galaxy .",
    "this could be due to other forces , besides gravity , that act on diffuse gas more readily than gas above @xmath96 @xmath3 in hi column density .",
    "ram pressure forces are the obvious example ( e.g. , kenney , van gorkom & vollmer 2004 ) , and since these galaxies are moving , this diffuse component may not be able to hang on .",
    "ram pressure stripping for the origin of the gas for these galaxies seems unlikely however , as the counter - rotating nature of this gas indicates it was not recently stripped from the galaxy and both galaxies have a regular hi structure . in the case of the milky way , there may be a similar effect of low column density gas not able to follow the dark matter halo as closely .",
    "the hvcs have typical peak column densities of just below @xmath80 @xmath3 ( putman et al .",
    "2002 ) , and most of the hvcs with peak columns between @xmath97 and @xmath98 @xmath3 ( the maximum column density observed for an hvc in the southern sky ) can be attributed to the magellanic stream , an hvc which is known to originate from the interaction of the magellanic clouds with the milky way .",
    "if some of the lower column density hvcs represent the condensing igm , the reason they do not appear to be rotating with the galaxy may be related to their relatively low column densities .",
    "perhaps diffuse igm gas must reach a certain column density before it is able to come into equilibrium with the dark matter halo of a galaxy .",
    "this comparison can not be taken too far , as the gas we are probing is at much lower column densities than hvcs and the velocity components being measured are different ( see gaseous infall section ) .",
    "the lack of kinematic correlation between the gas and dark matter at large radii can be combined with the work of c05 to strengthen the scenarios discussed here .",
    "the strongest case of this lack of correlation lies in the two systems presented here with the edge on nature of the galaxies and absorber lying close to the plane of the galaxy at a distance of @xmath99 kpc . in the c05 paper ,",
    "5 additional spiral galaxies with kinematic information were found to have low column density ( 10@xmath100 @xmath3 ) absorbers within @xmath101 kpc .",
    "these galaxies have various inclinations and absorber positions .",
    "c05 fit these galaxies with an extended rotating gaseous disk to determine if the absorption line velocity agreed with that expected from a navarro , frenk & white ( 1996 ) cold dark matter halo model . for 3 of these , they could explain the rotation if one invoked warps or thick rotating gas layers , and in the other 2 they found the magnitude of the velocity was too high to be fit by any reasonable galactic features , or the gas would have to be counter - rotating . since determining the main velocity components of the absorbers in relation to the galaxies is not straight - forward for these systems , due to the galaxies inclinations and the locations of the absorbers , comments can not easily be made on the issues of gaseous inflow and/or outflow . in summary ,",
    "the c05 results support the results we present here that the gas and dark matter do not appear to be linked in the extended dark matter halos of spiral galaxies .",
    "the deep hi observations around low redshift absorbers presented here have revealed two nearby , edge - on spiral galaxies within @xmath0 kpc ( in projection from the galaxies centers ) of absorption line systems at similar velocities .",
    "both of the absorbers are located roughly along the plane of the nearby galaxy and , based on the kinematics of the galaxies revealed by the hi observations , are not rotating with the galaxy . in the case of ic 3061 the gas traced by the absorber ( along the sightline to pg 1211 + 143 ) is either counter - rotating or infalling at a very high relative velocity . for ugc 7697 the gas traced by the absorber ( along the sightline to ton 1542 ) may be infalling to the galaxy , but can not be rotating with the galaxy , as also found by c05 .",
    "these results indicate that despite dark matter halos extending out to 100 s of kpc , there is not an associated diffuse baryonic component bound to this dark matter at large radii .",
    "the results agree with previous findings that indicate low column density absorbers , even in the vicinity of galaxies , largely trace the cosmic web .",
    "* do the absorbers near galaxies trace gas in extended dark matter halos ?",
    "no , unless for some reason the gas has not yet reached equilibrium with the dark matter .",
    "* is there gas rotating with the dark matter halos of galaxies at large radii ?",
    "clearly not unless our understanding of the kinematics of dark matter halos at large radii is incorrect .",
    "another possibility is the dark matter halo has been truncated and neither gas or dark matter is rotating at large radii .",
    "* do the absorbers near galaxies represent galactic waste ?",
    "no , the gas is unlikely to have originated from the galaxies given the discrepant velocities and positions along the major axes of the galaxies .",
    "* do the absorbers near galaxies represent galactic fuel ? possibly , but in one case infall velocities are quite high given the distance from the galaxy and a comparison to the velocities of hvcs",
    ". the absorbers may represent infalling gas that will eventually condense into hvcs .",
    "* are the absorbers near galaxies simply part of large scale cosmic filaments ?",
    "yes , this is the most likely scenario given the geometry and velocities of the absorber - galaxy pairs discussed here .",
    "this is consistent with the observations of c05 , bowen et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , and penton et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , as well as the simulations of dav et al .",
    "( 2001 ) . *",
    "do the absorbers represent the presence of a low surface brightness galaxy , rich in gas , but not easily detected in the optical ?",
    "no , our observations reach hi masses on the order of @xmath1   and column densities of @xmath2 @xmath3 , so an hi - rich dwarf galaxy or stripped gaseous feature such as the magellanic stream would have been detected .",

    "<S> the relationship between gas - rich galaxies and absorbers is addressed in this paper in the context of the baryonic content of galaxy halos . </S>",
    "<S> deep arecibo hi observations are presented of two gas - rich spiral galaxies within @xmath0 kpc projected distance of a absorber at a similar velocity . </S>",
    "<S> the galaxies investigated are close to edge - on and the absorbers lie almost along their major axes , allowing for a comparison of the absorber velocities with galactic rotation . </S>",
    "<S> this comparison is used to examine whether the absorbers are diffuse gas rotating with the galaxies halos , outflow material from the galaxies , or intergalactic gas in the low redshift cosmic web . </S>",
    "<S> the results indicate that if the gas resides in the galaxies halos it is not rotating with the system and possibly counter - rotating . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , simple geometry indicates the gas was not ejected from the galaxies and there are no gas - rich satellites detected down to @xmath1 , or remnants of satellites to @xmath2 @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> the gas could potentially be infalling from large radii , but the velocities and distances are rather high compared to the high velocity clouds around the milky way . </S>",
    "<S> the most likely explanation is the galaxies and absorbers are not directly associated , despite the vicinity of the spiral galaxies to the absorbers ( @xmath4 kpc from the hi edge ) . </S>",
    "<S> the spiral galaxies reside in a filament of intergalactic gas , and the gas detected by the absorber has not yet come into equilibrium with the galaxy . </S>",
    "<S> these results also indicate that the massive , extended dark matter halos of spiral galaxies do not commonly have an associated diffuse baryonic component at large radii . </S>"
