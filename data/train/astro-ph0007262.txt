    "in paper i ( wielen et al .",
    "1999b ) , we have shown that the combination of the data of the hipparcos astrometric satellite ( esa 1997 ) with ground - based results ( such as the fk5 ) is able to provide for many stars individual proper motions which are significantly more accurate than the hipparcos proper motions themselves .",
    "the method has been already successfully applied in the construction of the fk6 , the sixth catalogue of fundamental stars ( part i of the fk6 : wielen et al .",
    "1999d , part iii of the fk6 : wielen et al .",
    "2000a ) .    the method of combination presented in paper i is , however , strictly valid for single stars only . in the fk6",
    ", we call this procedure therefore the ` single - star mode '",
    ".    in reality most of the stars are members of binaries or of multiple systems .",
    "if the duplicity of an individual object is already definitely known , either from ground - based investigations or from hipparcos observations , then the method of combination has to be changed properly in order to obtain meaningful results .",
    "we call such procedures ` special solutions '",
    ". paper iii of this series of papers will discuss the special solutions for visual binaries and other types of double stars .",
    "the present paper ( paper ii ) describes an appropriate method of the combination of hipparcos results with ground - based observations for ` apparently single stars ' .",
    "even if we have removed from such a sample of apparently single stars all the objects with known duplicity , there remains beside the truly single - stars a large number of hitherto undetected astrometric binaries .",
    "the measured photo - center of an unresolved astrometric binary moves on the sky on a wavy curve , in contrast to the linear motion of single stars ( fig .",
    "1 ) . in such a case , an ` instantaneously ' measured proper motion deviates from a ` mean ' proper motion , averaged over a long interval of time .",
    "the proper motions provided by hipparcos ( esa 1997 ) are essentially such instantaneously measured quantities , since they are derived from positional measurements spread over about three years only .",
    "in contrast , the proper motions given in the fk5 ( fricke et al .",
    "1988 , 1991 ) are long - term averages over up to about 200 years .",
    "we have called the difference between the instantaneous proper - motion and the mean one the ` cosmic error ' of the instantaneous proper motion ( wielen 1995a , b , 1997 , wielen et al .",
    "1997 ) .    in some cases , the individual cosmic error is so large that the duplicity of an apparently single star is strongly indicated by this fact .",
    "we have called such objects ` @xmath2 binaries ' ( wielen et al .",
    "1999a ) . in most cases",
    ", however , the cosmic error in the hipparcos proper motion of a hitherto undetected astrometric binary is not _ individually _ significant , but can be shown to exist only _ statistically _ in a larger sample of apparently single stars .",
    "nevertheless , an appropriate combination method should not neglect the statistical consequences of these cosmic errors .",
    "our comparison of hipparcos proper motions with ground - based results has shown that , at least for brighter stars , the average cosmic error in a hipparcos proper motion is often larger than the hipparcos measuring error , typically by a factor of three ( wielen 1995a , b , wielen et al .",
    "1997 , 1998 , 1999c ) .",
    "wielen ( 1997 , henceforth called paper wpsa ) has developed a coherent scheme of ` statistical astrometry ' for handling the effects of cosmic errors in high - precision astrometry . in the following sections",
    ", we shall apply the concepts of statistical astrometry to the problem of combining the hipparcos results with ground - based measurements for a sample of apparently single stars .",
    "the main results will be solutions which we call the ` long - term prediction mode ( ltp ) ' and the ` short - term prediction mode ( stp ) ' .",
    "our results have already been applied for the ltp and stp solutions given in part i and part iii of the fk6 ( wielen et al .",
    "1999d , 2000a ) .",
    "it is clear that in principle the most desirable solution for our problem would be to treat each star individually and fully correctly .",
    "this would mean ( 1 ) for truly single stars : to use the ` single - star mode ( si ) ' described in paper i , and ( 2 ) for binaries : to apply individual orbital corrections , as e.g. done for polaris by wielen et al .",
    ". however , since for ` apparently single stars ' the true nature ( single or double ) of the individual objects is unknown , we _ have _ to rely on statistical methods in order to handle such a sample of stars properly .",
    "the treatment of a sample of apparently single stars by our statistical procedures gives _ on average _ the best astrometric prediction , and it provides the most realistic error budget for such a sample . in this sense ,",
    "our statistical treatment is certainly much more appropriate than to ignore the binary nature of a large fraction of a sample of apparently single stars altogether .    in paper",
    "i , we have already pointed out that the older observations carry a high weight in the combination of ground - based measurements with hipparcos data , and that therefore the gc ( boss et al . 1937 ) should be also considered here because of its high number of rather well - measured stars .",
    "we call the result of the combination of the gc with hipparcos the combination catalogue gc+hip .",
    "with respect to the two catalogues which should be combined into a new one , we follow closely the situation described in sect .",
    "2 of paper i. we are using also as far as possible the nomenclature of that section .",
    "we assume that two astrometric compilation catalogues are available , identified by the indices 1 ( e.g. for the fk5 ) and 2 ( e.g. for hipparcos ) .",
    "for the combined catalogue ( e.g. the fk6 ) , we use the index c , usually now supplemented by an additional subindex which identifies the special mode of the solution ( e.g. ltp or stp ) .",
    "each of the two basic catalogues ( @xmath3 ) provides for the stars a position @xmath4 at a central epoch @xmath5 and a proper motion @xmath6 for two angular coordinates ( e.g. right ascension @xmath7 and declination @xmath8 ) .",
    "the mean measuring errors of @xmath9 and @xmath6 are denoted by @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "usually one of the catalogues ( e.g. @xmath12 ) has first to be reduced to the astrometrical system of the other catalogue ( e.g. the fk5 to the hipparcos system ) . in this case ,",
    "@xmath13 and @xmath14 denote the already systematically corrected quantities , and their mean errors @xmath15 and @xmath16 include the uncertainty of the systematic corrections . for the determination of the systematic differences between two catalogues , we use methods developed for the construction of the fk5 ( bien et al .",
    "1978 ) .    with respect to the principles of statistical astrometry",
    ", we make now the important additional assumptions that catalogue 1 gives ` mean ' quantities for @xmath17 and @xmath18 , averaged over a long interval of time , while catalogue 2 provides ` instantaneously ' measured values of @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "if we apply our scheme to a combination of the fk5 with hipparcos , both assumptions are fulfilled to a high degree of approximation : the fk5 is based on ground - based observations spread over about two centuries , while the hipparcos results are obtained from measurements made during a short interval of time , about three years only . in the terminology of statistical astrometry ,",
    "our assumptions mean that we suppose that the fk5 is free from cosmic errors .",
    "the cosmic errors in the hipparcos positions and proper motions are denoted by @xmath19 and @xmath20 . the correlation functions @xmath21 , @xmath22 , and @xmath23 are explained in wpsa ( especially sect .",

    "of which at least one contains instantaneously measured data ( affected by cosmic errors ) , the predicted position @xmath27 at an arbitrary epoch @xmath28 should not be anymore a linear function of time . according to the principles of statistical astrometry , the ` best ' prediction @xmath27 for the true instantaneous position @xmath29",

    "this improvement in the ltp mode with respect to hipparcos is a consequence of the cosmic errors in the instantaneously measured hipparcos proper motions .",
    "in contrast to the ltp mode , the short - term predictions ( stp mode ) do not differ so much from the hipparcos solutions .",
    "however , in most cases we are more interested in the long - term averaged proper motion ( ltp ) or in the single - mode result ( si ) , where the gain in accuracy is quite significant .",
    "the long - term predictions and the short - term predictions derived in the former sections are _ statistically _ the best astrometric solution for a sample of ` apparently single - stars ' . however , an unsatisfactory property of these statistically valid solutions is the fact that we are not able to make proper use of the available information on the _ individual _ behaviour of the stars .",
    "for example , we use the overall cosmic errors @xmath25 and @xmath24 , no matter whether the object is a @xmath2 binary or a single - star candidate ( wielen et al .",
    "1999a ) . in principle",
    ", for each individual star , one would have to use ` conditioned correlation functions ' which are based on the individually observed differences between the instantaneous measurements and the mean data ( e.g. on @xmath302 ) .",
    "unfortunately , the conditioned correlation functions , i.e. ` conditioned cosmic errors ' in particular , are not available at present .",
    "we should also point out that presently the cosmic errors @xmath93 in position are much more uncertain than the cosmic errors @xmath144 in proper motion . while the typical values of @xmath144 are larger than the measuring errors @xmath303 , @xmath221 , and @xmath304 , the typical values of @xmath93 are nearly lost in the measuring errors of the ground - based data .",
    "furthermore , our knowledge about the actual form of the correlation functions @xmath120 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 for @xmath305 is presently still quite rudimentary .",
    "the simple example for the correlation functions presented in sect .",
    "3.6 of wpsa is mainly given for illustrating the general behaviour of these functions .",
    "the application of this example to real data should be done very cautiously .",
    "hence the real transition from the stp solution to the ltp solution ( discussed in sect .",
    "5 ) is quantitatively not well - determined .    which of the three solutions offered ( si , ltp , stp ) should be used in real applications ? for single - star candidates ,",
    "the single - star mode should be adopted , although some of the single - star candidates may nevertheless be binaries .",
    "if the user is handling a sample of ` apparently single stars ' ( which usually contains single - star candidates , @xmath2 binaries , and intermediate cases ) , then the ltp or stp solutions are recommended , depending on the corresponding epoch difference @xmath306 ( with @xmath307 ) .",
    "the problems discussed above are especially severe for objects detected as @xmath2 binaries ( wielen et al .",
    "1999a ) . for @xmath2 binaries",
    "the difference between the instantaneous proper motion ( @xmath308 ) and the mean one ( e.g. , @xmath309 or @xmath187 ) is sometimes much larger than the cosmic error @xmath144 expected on average .",
    "in such a case the weight @xmath310 ( eq . ( 53 ) ) of the hipparcos proper motion ( @xmath311 ) is higher than appropriate for this individual object .",
    "the derived mean proper motion @xmath312 is then biased towards the hipparcos proper motion , and the derived mean error @xmath313 is too small .",
    "in the case of extreme @xmath2 binaries , it is better to adopt a properly weighted mean of @xmath14 ( e.g. @xmath309 ) and @xmath187 as a prediction for the mean proper motion @xmath47 .",
    "the main problem in such a procedure is the unknown individual value of the cosmic error in the hipparcos position , which is higher than the value of @xmath93 expected on average .",
    "this value enters into the weight of @xmath187 , and hence into the predicted value of @xmath47 . we shall discuss this problem in more detail in a subsequent paper . in any case , the ltp solutions ( and , of course , the si solutions ) for @xmath2 binaries are inherently the least accurate ones among the class of direct solutions , because of the disturbing double - star nature of these objects",
    "in this paper ii , we have derived and discussed an appropriate method to combine a ground - based astrometric catalogue ( such as the fk5 or gc ) with the hipparcos catalogue , taking cosmic errors ( due to undetected binaries ) in the quasi - instantaneously measured data into account .",
    "the method leads to long - term predictions ( ltp mode ) and to short - term predictions ( stp mode ) , which are the limiting cases of the general solution .",
    "the general solution is a smooth transition from the stp to the ltp mode .",
    "the case of single stars with no cosmic errors was already treated in paper i ( si mode ) . in a subsequent paper",
    ", we shall present ` special solutions ' for known double stars .",
