    "in contrast , for the neumann laplacians ( we denote them @xmath30 and @xmath31 ) the continuity of eigenvalues does not hold in general : the first eigenvalues @xmath32 and @xmath33 of @xmath34 and @xmath30 are zero , the second eigenvalue @xmath35 of @xmath31 is strictly positive , while the second eigenvalue @xmath36 of @xmath30 tends to zero as @xmath6 provided @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 .",

    "the case , when the number of attached `` room - and - passage '' protuberances tends to infinity as @xmath6 , was studied in our previous paper @xcite ( still with a bounded @xmath27 ) .",

    "note , that in the case @xmath66 ( i.e. , @xmath51 is simply the neumann laplacian on @xmath8 ) one has @xmath61 , i.e. @xmath55 is the neumann laplacian on @xmath27 .",

    "the number @xmath72 is a solutions to some transcendental equation involving @xmath65 and @xmath73 . in the last instance we are able to make the following useful conclusion : the spectrum of @xmath51 has a gap provided @xmath21 is small enough",

    "since @xmath8 shrinks to @xmath76 as @xmath6 it is natural to expect that @xmath30 converges ( in suitable sense ) to some ordinary differential operator on the line .",
    "it turns out that the form of this operator depends on @xmath77 $ ] .",
    "boundary value and spectral problems on _ thin domains with oscillating boundary _ were studied in a lot works  see , e.g. , @xcite and references therein . in these papers the authors deal with thin domains , whose boundary ( or its part ) has the form of a graphic of some smooth oscillating function ( for example , @xmath78 where @xmath79 is again a small parameter , @xmath80 , @xmath81 , @xmath82 is a smooth positive function , periodic with respect to @xmath83 ) .",
    "more general geometries were treated in @xcite , where thin strip is perturbed by attaching small protuberances , @xmath84-periodically along it boundary ; the protuberances are obtained from a fixed bounded domain by @xmath84-rescaling in @xmath85 direction and @xmath21-rescaling in @xmath86 direction . in @xcite , besides an oscillating external boundary , additional internal holes are allowed .",
    "at first , we study the resolvent equation @xmath87 we prove ( see theorems [ th1]-[th1 + ] ) that under some natural assumptions on @xmath88 the solution @xmath89 to the problem converges in a suitable sense to the solution of the following problem on the line : @xmath90 the functions @xmath91 , @xmath92 are either linear ( @xmath63 ) or rational ( @xmath64 ) functions of @xmath93 . in the later case",

    "the spectrum of this operator has the form @xmath95 provided @xmath96 , otherwise @xmath97 .    our second result concerns the spectral convergence in the most interesting case @xmath64 .",
    "periodicity of @xmath8 leads to the band structure of @xmath98 , i.e. @xmath98 is a locally finite union of compact intervals called _ bands_. in general they may overlap , otherwise we have a _",
    "gap _ in the spectrum ",
    "a bounded open interval having an empty intersection with the spectrum but with ends belonging to it .",
    "we prove ( see theorem [ th2 ] ) that the spectrum of @xmath30 converges as @xmath6 to the spectrum of @xmath55 in the hausdorff sense .",
    "this means that @xmath98 has a gap provided @xmath21 is small enough ; when @xmath6 this gap converges to the interval @xmath99 .",
    "moreover , we show ( see lemma [ lm1 ] ) that other gaps ( if any ) `` escape '' from any finite interval when @xmath6 .",
    "theorems [ th1]-[th2 ] remain valid if @xmath27 is a bounded strip , cf .",
    "remark [ rm - bounded ] below .",
    "note , that using the same ideas one can also construct a waveguide with several gaps .",
    "namely , if we attach to @xmath16@xmath100 different families of `` room - and - passage '' domains we will arrive at the same limit problem , but the functions @xmath91 , @xmath92 will have @xmath101 poles . the corresponding operator @xmath55 will act in @xmath102^{m+1}$ ] and have @xmath101 gaps .",
    "the proof relies on the same methods as in the case @xmath103 , but is more cumbersome .",
    "the possibility to open up gaps in the spectrum of periodic differential operators is important from the point of view of applications , in particular , to the so - called photonic crystals ",
    "periodic nanostructures that have been attracting much attention in recent years .",
    "the characteristic property of photonic crystals is that the light waves at certain optical frequencies fail to propagate in them , which is caused by gaps in the spectrum of the maxwell operator or related scalar operators .",
    "pioneer mathematical results justifying the opening of spectral gaps for some @xmath104 dielectric media were obtained in @xcite .",
    "we refer to the overview @xcite and the book @xcite concerning mathematical problems arising in this field .",
    "as we already mentioned , in general , the presence of gaps is not guaranteed  for instance , if @xmath27 is a straight unbounded strip then the spectrum of the laplace operator is a ray @xmath105 , where @xmath106 for the neumann laplacian and @xmath107 for the dirichlet laplacian .",
    "there exist several approaches how to construct a periodic waveguide - like domain with non - void gaps in the spectrum of the laplace operator on this domain subject to neumann or dirichlet boundary conditions .",
    "the simplest way is to consider the waveguide consisting of an array of identical compact domains connected by thin passages or windows  see , e.g. , @xcite . in this case",
    "the spectrum typically has small bands separated by relatively large gaps .",
    "the opposite picture ( i.e. , large bands versus small gaps ) occurs under `` small '' perturbations of straight waveguides ( see @xcite )  either by a periodic nucleation of small holes or by a gentle periodic bending of the boundary .",
    "the waveguide @xmath8 constructed in the current paper falls into an intermediate case  the length of the first band is comparable with the length of the first gap .",
    "moreover , in contrast to @xcite , both edges of this gap depends on geometric properties of the waveguide in a very simple fashion .",
    "thin periodic waveguides of constant width were treated in @xcite .",
    "it was proved that the dirichlet laplacian on such a waveguide always has at least one gap provided the signed curvature of the boundary curve is smooth and non - constant and the waveguide is thin enough .",
    "the opening of spectral gaps for the dirichlet laplacian on the waveguide of the form @xmath108 , where @xmath109 is a positive periodic function , was established in @xcite under a suitable assumptions on @xmath110 .",
    "the waveguide consisting of two parallel strips coupled through a period family of thin windows was studied in @xcite .",
    "finally , we mention the papers @xcite where the same type problems were addressed for more general elliptic selfadjoint operators , and @xcite , where the steklov spectral problem was considered .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec2 ]",
    "we set up the problem and formulate the main results .",
    "we prove resolvent convergence of @xmath30 in sections [ sec3 ] ( @xmath64 ) and [ sec4 ] ( @xmath63 ) . in section  [ sec5 ]",
    "we prove hausdorff convergence of the spectrum .",
    "finally , in section [ sec6 ] we show that @xmath30 has at most one gap on finite intervals provided @xmath21 is small enough .",
    "let @xmath79 be a small parameter , and @xmath111 be positive numbers depending on @xmath21 and satisfying @xmath112 condition is rather technical , one needs it to have a better control on the behaviour of functions from @xmath113 near the bottom and the top of the passages ( see lemma [ lm2 ] below ) .",
    "hereinafter by @xmath114 we denote the points in @xmath1 , by @xmath115 we denote the points in @xmath76 .",
    "further , we introduce the following sets ( below @xmath20 ) :    * @xmath116 , * @xmath117 , where @xmath118 , * @xmath119 , where @xmath120 , @xmath121 is an open bounded domain with lipschitz boundary such that @xmath122    by virtue of the condition the neighbouring `` rooms '' @xmath15 are pairwise disjoint .",
    "condition together with imply the correct gluing of the @xmath123-th `` room '' and the @xmath123-th `` passage '' , namely the upper face of @xmath22 is contained in @xmath124 .",
    "finally , we define the waveguide @xmath8 as a union of the straight strip @xmath16 and @xmath21-periodically attached `` room - and - passage '' protuberances @xmath125 ( see figure [ fig1 ] ) : @xmath126    we denote by @xmath51 the neumann laplacian in @xmath127  the self - adjoint and positive operator associated with the sesquilinear form @xmath128 , @xmath129={\\int\\limits}_{\\omega{^\\varepsilon}}\\nabla u({\\textbf{x}})\\cdot\\overline{\\nabla v({\\textbf{x}})}{\\hspace{1pt}\\mathrm{d}}\\mathbf{x},\\quad \\mathrm{dom}(\\mathfrak{h}{^\\varepsilon})=h^1(\\omega{^\\varepsilon})\\ ] ] ( i.e. , @xmath130 $ ] , @xmath131 , @xmath132 ) .",
