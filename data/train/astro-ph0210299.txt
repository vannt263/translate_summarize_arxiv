    "contemporary theories of fundamental interactions ( strings / m - theory , and others ) predict variation of fundamental physical constants in the course of the universe evolution .",
    "first of all the theories predict variation of the coupling constants with increasing of energy transfer in particle interaction ( so - called , `` running constants '' ) .",
    "this effect has been proved in high - energy experiments with accelerators .",
    "for example , the fine - structure constant @xmath10 equals @xmath11 at low energies @xmath12 , but it increases up - to @xmath13 for energy @xmath14  gev .",
    "such `` running '' of the constants has to be taken into account for consideration of very early universe .",
    "there is another prediction of the current theories related to the low - energy limits of the constants .",
    "these limits are allowed to vary during the cosmological evolution and even have different values in different points of the space - time .",
    "there are several reasons for such variations .",
    "multidimensional theories ( kaluza - klein models , `` p - brane '' models , and others ) predict variations of fundamental physical constants as a direct result of the cosmological evolution of the extra - dimensional subspace . in several theories ( e.g. superstrings ) ,",
    "the variations of the constants result from the cosmological evolution of the vacuum state ( a vacuum condensate of some scalar field or `` quintessence '' ) .    here",
    "we check a possible cosmological deviation @xmath15 , where @xmath1 is the proton - to - electron mass ratio at the epoch @xmath16 and @xmath17 is the present one .",
    "searching of @xmath18-variation becomes especially important after possible finding of @xmath19-variation @xcite because different theoretical models of the fundamental physical interactions predict different variations of their values and different relations between cosmological deviations of the constants ( @xmath7 , @xmath5 , @xmath20 , and others @xcite ) .",
    "note that the method used for checking of @xmath7-variation by webb et al .",
    "( 2001 ) is based on a simultaneous measurements of wavelengths of a large number of transitions for various species .",
    "it is significantly reduced statistical errors .",
    "however , it was more difficult to estimate the systematic errors @xcite than in the method used previously where the structure of lines of each species was measured separately @xcite . in any case , this intriguing result @xcite must be checked independently by using different methods and by probing variations of other fundamental constants .",
    "experimental detection of such variations of the constants would be a great step forward in our understanding of nature .",
    "at the present the proton - to - electron mass ratio has been measured with a relative accuracy of @xmath21 and equals @xmath22 @xcite .",
    "laboratory metrological measurements rule out considerable variation of @xmath5 on a short time scale but do not exclude its changes over the cosmological scale , @xmath23 years .",
    "moreover , one can not reject a possibility of @xmath5 value ( as well as other constants ) be differ in wide separated regions of the universe .",
    "it can be proved or disproved only by means astrophysical observations of distant extragalactic objects .",
    "proper measurements of wavelengths of absorption lines in spectra of high - redshift quasars provide us a tool for direct checking of possible deviation of physical constants ( e.g. @xmath5 and @xmath24 ) at the epoch of the absorption - spectrum formation , i.e. @xmath25  gyr ago .",
    "some estimations of @xmath5-variations were performed by potekhin et al .",
    "( 1999 ) and levshakov et al .",
    "( 2002a ) .",
    "the most stringent estimate of possible cosmological variation of @xmath26 was obtained by ivanchik et al .",
    "the method used here to determine possible @xmath5-variations was proposed by varshalovich and levshakov ( 1993 ) .",
    "it is based on the fact that wavelengths of electron - vibro - rotational lines depend on the reduced mass of the molecule , with the dependence being different for different transitions .",
    "it enables to distinguish the cosmological redshift of a line from the shift caused by a possible variation of @xmath5 .",
    "thus , the measured wavelength @xmath27 of a line formed in the absorption system at the redshift @xmath28 can be written as @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the laboratory ( vacuum ) wavelength of the transition , and @xmath31 is the sensitivity coefficient calculated for the lyman and werner bands of molecular hydrogen in works @xcite , @xcite .",
    "this expression can be represented in terms of the redshift @xmath32 as @xmath33 where @xmath34 . in reality",
    ", @xmath35 is measured with some uncertainty which is caused by statistical errors of the astronomical measurements @xmath27 and by errors of the laboratory measurements of @xmath30 . nevertheless ,",
    "if @xmath36 is nonzero , there must be a correlation between @xmath35 and @xmath37 .",
    "thus , a linear regression analysis of these quantities yields @xmath28 and @xmath38 ( as well as its statistical significance ) , consequently @xmath39 .",
    "high - resolution ( fwhm @xmath40 6  km / s ) spectrum of the quasar q  0347 - 382 obtained with the 8.2-m vlt / uves kueyen telescope ( eso ) were used to probe the possible variation of @xmath5 .",
    "the observing time was nine hours that led to s / n @xmath41 .",
    "we analyzed the h@xmath42 absorption system at @xmath43 in the spectrum .",
    "this h@xmath42 system was first detected by levshakov et al .",
    "( 2002b ) .",
    "more than 80 lines of molecular hydrogen can be identified in the wavelength range 3600 - 4600  . for our analysis ,",
    "we carefully selected lines that satisfied the following conditions : ( i ) isolated , and ( ii ) unblended . in this system",
    ", only 15 lines satisfy these conditions .",
