    "field - effect transistors ( fets ) with thin films of organic @xmath1-conjugated materials as active semiconductor have developed towards a serious alternative for low - cost and flexible electronics on large areas.@xcite the fact that charge transport in those organic films occurs essentially in the first molecular monolayer in close proximity to the dielectric interface @xcite makes a self - assembled monolayer field - effect transistor ( samfet ) a perfect device for studying charge - carrier transport properties in organic materials.@xcite in samfets , the active @xmath1-system is linked to a flexible insulating alkyl - chain that is covalently bound to a suitable surface .",
    "thus , the @xmath1-systems form an almost 2d confined transport channel on molecular scale in thickness @xcite and the n - alkyl linkers compose a hybrid gate dielectric together with the insulating anchor oxide ( @xmath2).@xcite hole and electron transport have been demonstrated in samfets making the concept a veritable approach in molecular scale electronics.@xcite    the experimental advances have triggered theoretical studies of charge transport in organic thin films within the context of samfets.@xcite the theoretical description of charge transport in these systems involves the principle problem of accounting for structural flexibility and inhomogeneity .",
    "thus , the characterization of the electronic structure must be combined with conformational sampling , which in view of the complexity of the systems , represents a significant challenge .",
    "furthermore , the mechanism of electron transport is _ a priori _ not obvious .",
    "while dephasing due to both structural fluctuations and inelastic processes may favor hopping - type transport at higher temperatures , band - type coherent transport can also contribute , in particular in systems with stronger intermolecular coupling and at lower temperatures .",

    "the theoretical methodology employed to simulate charge transport in sams involves three steps : ( i ) a characterization of the structure of the sams with md simulations , ( ii ) a determination of the electronic structure using semiempirical molecular orbital ( mo ) theory , and ( iii ) transport calculations within landauer theory . in the following",

    "we begin with a brief introduction of the systems investigated and their use in samfet devices .      a scheme of the self - assembled monolayer field - effect transistor ( samfet ) device and its chemical composition is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : device ] .",
    "the sam is formed by fullerene - functionalized octadecyl - phosphonic acids ( pas ) ( in the following denoted by @xmath0-@xmath3-pa ) and @xmath4-pa in various stoichiometric ratios .",
    "the sam is separated from the aluminum gate electrode at the bottom by an @xmath2 layer , which together with the alkyl chains of the sam builds the dielectric of the device.@xcite lithographically patterned gold ( 30 nm ) is placed on top of the sam , serving as source and drain electrodes.@xcite the semiconducting @xmath0 head groups of the functionalized pa in the sam form the active transistor channel in the device . in this paper , we focus on the modeling of charge transport within the sam . therefore , the influence of a gate potential and the @xmath2 layer is not taken into account .",
    "the coupling to the gold electrodes is described implicitely using self energies ( see below ) .",
    "the underlying conformational sampling of the self - assembled monolayer systems investigated in this publication is based on classical atomistic molecular - dynamics simulations published and described in detail previously.@xcite here , the sam - forming molecules were initially aligned on a clean ( 0001 ) aluminum - oxide surface that was equilibrated prior to depositing phosphonic acids using an interatomic potential model parameterized by sun et al",
    ".. @xcite the parameters for the phosphonates are based on the general amber force field ( gaff ) @xcite and the md simulations were performed with the program dl - poly.@xcite details of the simulation are given in ref .  .",
    "following the md simulations , an ensemble of snapshots was extracted and the @xmath2 substrate was removed for further processing .",
    "the snapshot geometries were then treated by semiempirical mo calculations using the restricted hartree - fock formalism and the am1 hamiltonian.@xcite all semiempirical mo calculations were performed using the parallel empire program .",

    "we assume that the gold electrodes couple preferentially to selected carbon atoms of the @xmath0 head groups at the left and right boundaries of the sam .",
    "this choice is suggested by the geometrical structure of the sam .",
    "furthermore , we invoke the wide - band limit , where @xmath19 can be approximated by a constant value and @xmath18 vanishes .",

    "the value @xmath25 ev respresents a reasonable choice for molecule - gold contacts .",
    "it is emphasized that the results do not depend significantly on the exact value of this parameter , because the bottleneck for charge transport in the systems considered is the sam itself and not the sam - gold contact .",

    "in the evaluation of the current , we assume that the transmission function @xmath9 depends only weakly on the bias voltage and use its value at zero bias voltage .",
    "it is noted that landauer transport theory , as used here , can only describe coherent transport based on elastic scattering mechanisms .",
    "dephasing and inelastic processes due to electron - phonon or electron - electron interaction are neglected .",

    "this allows a more straightforward analysis of the pathways of charge transport through the sam .",
    "we have investigated three different sam configurations as shown in fig .  [",

    "moreover , the @xmath0 head groups are much closer to the surface in the pure sam and , therefore , favor leakage currents into the substrate .",
    "monte carlo ( mc ) simulations and experiments have proven this morphology to be less conductive and have suggested a mixing ratio in the range of 25:75  50:50 to optimize the performance of the samfet devices .",

    "note that the realistic morphology of the pure sam as derived from md simulations is the one shown in ( c ) .",
    "we first consider the 25:75 sam depicted in fig .",

    "the spectrum exhibits a dense distribution of energy levels and a homo - lumo energy gap of 3.26 ev .",
    "in addition , the homo and the lumo of the sam are depicted . due to the pronounced structural disorder , all mos are localized .",
    "the analysis reveals that the occupied orbitals close to the homo are mainly localized on the alkyl chains , while the unoccupied orbitals close to the lumo are localized on the fullerenes . as fullerenes are electron conductors , only unoccupied energy states are relevant for transport processes .",
    "therefore , in the simulations it is sufficient to take into account only the unoccupied part of the spectrum .",
    "[ fig : moanalysis ] shows the transmission function of the 25:75 sam in an energy range close to the fermi level ( starting at @xmath51 ) .",
    "in addition , the energy levels are depicted as black lines .",
    "the transmission function exhibits a series of narrow peaks , which can be associated to individual energy levels of the molecular layer .",
    "the small widths of the peaks are due to the strong localization of the corresponding molecular orbitals , which results in a weak coupling to the electrodes .",
    "the current - voltage characteristic of the sam at @xmath52 k , depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : moanalysis ] ( bottom ) , shows a non - ohmic behavior .",
    "thermally broadened steps in the current appear at voltages , where the chemical potential of the left electrode , @xmath53 , is in resonance with energies @xmath54 of the transmission peaks , i.e. at @xmath55 .",
    "as in the transmission function , the step structures in the current can be associated to contributions from individual mos .",
    "for example , the rise of the current at @xmath56 v is due to contributions of lumo+1 and lumo+2 .",
    "although their transmission values are comparably large , their contributions to the current are small because of the small widths of their transmission peaks .",
    "the step at @xmath57 v corresponds to lumo+5 , which exhibits a small transmission coefficient of @xmath58 but a much larger peak width . at larger voltages , we find the contributions of several higher unoccupied mos . the overall magnitude of the current is on the order of @xmath59 , which is in agreement with experimental data.@xcite       ( b ) ) top : mo analysis , center : energy levels ( black lines ) and transmission function ( red lines ) , bottom : corresponding current ]    in order to explore the influence of the morphology of the sams and the mixing ratio of the sam - forming molecules on the transport properties , we consider the pure @xmath0-@xmath3-pa sams with the two different geometries shown in fig .  [ fig : systems ] ( b ) and ( c ) .",
    "we first focus on the pure sam with the unrelaxed geometry , which was obtained by removing the @xmath4-pas groups from the 25:75 mixed sam without further md simulation . the transmission function and the current - voltage characteristic depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : moanalysis_wo ] reveal the pronounced influence of the @xmath4-pas on the conductance properties of the sams .",
    "compared to the mixed sam , we find that the lumo of the pure systems is shifted by almost 1 ev to higher energies .",
    "this and also a slight shift of the homo to lower values leads to an increase of the bandgap compared to the mixed sam . due to the larger bandgap ,",
    "the onset of the current is shifted to higher voltages . however , the current magnitude is significantly larger than in the mixed sam .",
    "the pronounced increase of the current at higher voltages ( @xmath60 v ) can be related to transport through lumo+30 . as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : moanalysis_wo ] ( top panel ) , lumo+30 is a delocalized mo , which strongly couples to the electrodes resulting in a high current value of about 150 na .",
    "such delocalized mos are not found in the mixed sam .",
    "thus , the presence of the @xmath4-pas in the mixed sam appears to decrease the coupling between the fullerene head groups in the layer , which , in combination with the disorder of the layer , results in the more localized orbitals in the mixed sam .",
    "thus , in principle , the pure sam with the geometry considered in fig .",
    "[ fig : moanalysis_wo ] has ( at least for higher voltages ) better conductance properties than the mixed sam .",
    "it should be noted , though , that this is only the case for the artificial geometry considered in fig .",

    "the results reveal that the almost flat and strongly disordered morphology modifies the electronic structure profoundly and results in a very small current , which confirms conclusions from previous simulations and experiments.@xcite evidently , due to the disorder , the @xmath0 head groups in the layer can not form a conductive channel .",
    "the contributing mos are strongly localized , leading to narrow peak structures in the transmission function .",
    "also , we find a shift of the lumo to higher energies .",
    "the current onset is located at high voltages and has values about one order of magnitude smaller than for the mixed sam .",
    "these findings show that the poor conduction properties of pure @xmath0-@xmath3-pa sams can clearly be related to the decreased order in the molecular structure .",
    "additionally , when used in samfets , higher leakage currents can appear due to the smaller distance of the fullerenes to the substrate , as was indeed found in the transport measurements @xcite .",
