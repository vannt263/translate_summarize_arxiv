    "[ section_introduction ]    hydrophobic force causes attraction between non - polar solutes in liquid water and is known to be an important driving force in micellar aggregation , cell membrane formation , large protein structures @xcite .",
    "although hydrophobic force is widely known to be pervading distinct physical , chemical and biological phenomena , its occurence as a solvent induced interaction was first suggested only in 1945 , by frank and evans through calorimetric studies on hydrocarbons @xcite and later elucidated in biological context by kauzmann @xcite . the former study noted that transferring a small hydrophobe into water was accompanied by unfavorable free energy change @xcite , dominated by entropy reduction due to reorganization of vicinal water molecules @xcite .",
    "hence , two hydrophobes show tendency to coalesce in order to minimize the unfavorable free energy . in the following years",
    "the applicability of this viewpoint for different sizes of hydrophobes such as alkanes , proteins has been discussed @xcite .",
    "theoretical and simulational investigations were limited to small solutes and interaction between them on scales of few angstroms @xcite . in early 1980s the first direct measurement of an attractive force between hydrophobic surfaces has been carried out using surface force apparatus @xcite .",
    "large hydrophobic surfaces made up of chemisorbed mica were employed in a crossed cylinder geometry and the measured force between them was related to interaction free energy per unit surface area using derjaguin approximation @xcite .",
    "the force was seen to be influential upto hundreds of angstroms and stronger than inter - surface van der waal forces @xcite .",
    "the qualitative aspect of the result i.e. , long range and monotonic nature of the force withstood the test of time @xcite . to understand the same ,",
    "various physical mechanisms were proposed , some generic to any fluid such as metastability of confined fluid @xcite , dewetting - induced cavitation under liquid - vapor coexistence conditions @xcite , fluid structuring effects @xcite and some , dependent on surface details like correlated dipolar fluctuations @xcite , charged bilayer patches @xcite , nanobubbles @xcite .",
    "the above phenomenological descriptions , however , are either envisaged in narrow range of fluid conditions or specifically depend on hydrophobization patterns on surfaces . besides , they were unsuccessful in reproducing generic features of hydrophobic force seen in experiments @xcite .",
    "we attempt to understand in a model study the nature of hydrophobic force by analyzing correlations of hydrogen bond fluctuations in liquid water and the effect of modification caused by presence of surfaces on these fluctuations .",
    "the analysis is carried out at generic fluid conditions within the model and applies to generic surfaces .",
    "we discuss some essential aspects in modelling water and past attempts in this direction .",
    "hydrogen bonding is an orientation - dependent attraction between two water molecules @xcite . in order to analyze hydrogen bond fluctuations",
    "it is therefore essential to envisage both density and orientational degrees of freedom of each water molecule .",
    "there are models galore proposed and analyzed to reproduce anomalous thermodynamic properties of water @xcite .",
    "however , theoretical attempts to envisage fluctuations in water are limited to ornstein - zernike - like phenomenological approaches , wherein integral equations only in terms of density correlation were heuristically proposed and are numerically solved using different closure approximations @xcite .",
    "wertheim s theory of associating fluids envisages similar density correlations to be solved in compliance with steric constraints imposed by formation of associated n - mers @xcite .",
    "the success of these descriptions crucially depends on approximation schemes employed @xcite .",
    "other approaches specific to molecular fluids such as rism were seen to be less predictive in case of associating fluids @xcite . also ,",
    "perturbation theories based on smallness of interaction strength found little success in reproducing liquid phase properties of water - like fluids @xcite .",
    "quantum mechanical calculations on water dimer in gas phase and diffraction study of ice forms provide sufficient evidence for specific nature of hydrogen bonding @xcite , i.e. , positively polarized hydrogen atom covalently bonded to an oxygen interacts only with negatively polarized lone - pair of neighboring oxygen .",
    "the specificity necessitates the density of hydrogen bonds and dangling bonds ( hydrogens or lone - pairs which are not hydrogen bonded ) to be commensurate with molecular density , stated as a _ sum rule _ @xcite .",
    "consequently , density and orientational fluctuations ( the latter being inherently connected to bond fluctuations ) are not totally independent ; their long wavelength fluctuations , especially , are to be consistent with the sum rule .",
    "effective interaction models for water designed for numerical simulations ( molecular dynamics ) @xcite provide successful instances of ( implictly ) envisaging most essential features of hydrogen bond fluctuations consistent with the sum rule . a water molecule is often modelled as a polar molecule with charges corresponding to hydrogens and lone - pairs placed at vertices of a tetrahedron @xcite .",
    "a complete description of molecular correlations in such models can be achieved by defining a set of orthonormal vectors in terms of atomic coordinates and defining correlations among them .",
    "large scale molecular dynamics ( md ) simulations at ambient conditions reveal that density correlations are short ranged and extend no further than @xmath0  ; whereas , dipolar orientations of water molecule , which are receptive to bond fluctuations in the neighborhood , are correlated over large distances , atleast upto @xmath1  @xcite .",
    "two correlation lengths of order @xmath2  and @xmath3  were inferred .",
    "coulomb interactions , surprisingly , have little effect on asymptotic behavior of these correlations @xcite .",
    "it is also suggested that mesoscopic hydrophobic solutes when coupled to dipolar fluctuations in water medium experience a long range exponential force , which is attractive in nature and dependent on shape and mutual orientation of solute surfaces @xcite .",
    "the exponential decay bears a striking consistency with that seen in experiments measuring hydrophobic force between large surfaces @xcite . for the case of large hydrophobic surfaces , correlations in confined water need to be ascertained .",
    "to simulate such a system the surfaces need to be several times larger than the longest correlation length in the system in order to obtain proper equilibrium conditions .",
    "this requires huge system size that would render the simulation prohibitively resource intensive .",
    "in addition , the accompanying free energy change could be very small due to weak nature of correlations at large distances .",
    "instead , we take analytic route to describe hydrogen bond fluctuations in water and the effect of spatial confinement on them .",
    "hydrophobes are known to interact unfavorably with water molecules in contrast to strong and cohesive water - water interactions .",
    "in addition , large surfaces substantially disrupt the hydrogen bond network whose fluctuations are suppressed at surface boundaries .",
    "the setting is ideally suited for fluctuation - induced force between the surfaces driven by thermal energy in confined water .",
    "forces of this nature are generically called _ casimir forces _ as they were first discussed by casimir in the case of electromagnetic fluctuations confined between conducting plates @xcite which was later studied in detail by lifshitz @xcite .",
    "such forces are now envisaged in widely different contexts @xcite .",
    "fisher and de gennes argued that when a binary liquid mixture is confined between surfaces which have specific affinity towards one of the fluid components , casimir - like density fluctuations in the liquid give rise to an effective force between surfaces @xcite .",
    "origin of the force is entropic in nature ; in that , the free energy is increased due to restriction imposed on fluctuations by the boundaries , thereby system tends to minimize the separation in order to reduce the free energy cost .",
    "we investigate hydrophobic force to be a manifestation of casimir - like force , here , due to density and orientational fluctuations in liquid water .",
    "when water is confined between hydrophobic surfaces the inherent field fluctuations vanish on surfaces .",
    "furthermore , water molecules at interface with each surface have restricted orientational entropy owing to repulsive hydrophobe - water interactions .",
    "this effect gives rise to modified fluctuations at each interface .",
    "we study the collective consequences of these effects on the overall free energy of the system in a model study .",
    "we define a simple water model wherein density and orientations of a water molecule are envisaged .",
    "the specific nature of hydrogen bonding between molecules is incorporated and associated constraints on the bond network are taken care of in the analysis .",
    "partition function is solved about a mean field which is consistently deduced at arbitrary densities within the model .",
    "fluctuation properties are also deduced .",
    "large correlation length is seen for orientational fluctuations .",
    "two macroscopic surfaces are envisaged as boundaries in a spatial dimension . the change in free energy in the system due to the presence of surfaces",
    "is calculated and is seen to be composed of three important contributions : ( i ) casimir part , which arises solely from discretization of fluctuation modes between boundaries and is generic to all surfaces ; ( ii ) interfacial tension , which is free energy change due to modified fluctuations at hydrophobe - water interface .",
    "it is dependent on nature of surface - water interaction and to a small extent , also on separation distance between the surfaces ; ( iii ) interfacial fluctuations - induced free energy , which is due to correlations of modified fluctuations at both interfaces .",
    "it depends on type of both surfaces and their interaction with water .",
    "the results are discussed for different types of surfaces such as hydrophobic and hydrophilic .",
    "we find that the casimir part is leading contribution and is an inverse power - law function of separation distance .",
    "however , numerically the magnitude of casimir part is significant only upto four times the longest correlation length in the model .",
    "interfacial tension also varies with separation distance , but its variation is numerically insignificant .",
    "interfacial fluctuations - induced contribution is seen to be exponentially decaying with distance , analogous to the force form deduced for mesoscopic surfaces @xcite .",
    "furthermore , we find that all the contributions are of comparable order of magnitude consistent with experimental values .",
    "the dependence of the force on fluid conditions like temperature , average hydrogen bonds is also discussed .",
    "our results indicate that hydrophobic force qualitatively imitates casimir - like force behavior within our model study .",
    "it is desirable to emulate the computation within more realistic models of water possibly with the help of md simulations .",
    "we also looked at transverse density profile for confined water and show that an increase in density occurs near interfaces .",
    "[ section_watermodel ]    we envisage our water model in the background of a lattice to exactly account for hard - sphere repulsion between atoms at short distances . also , constraints of hydrogen bond network are explicitly taken care of in lattice background .",
    "we developed molecular mean field ( mmf ) technique in an earlier paper @xcite to address the same model in the infinite volume limit .",
    "we present here a brief summary of the model and mmf technique and then , address the case of confined water .    on a three dimensional hypercubic lattice",
    "we define occupation field @xmath4 corresponding to water being absent or present , respectively , at the site @xmath5 . at each _ occupied _ site",
    "we define bond arm field @xmath6 which resides on the links around the site @xmath7 .",
    "@xmath8 , where @xmath9 correspond to six directions around the site .",
    "@xmath10 refers to hydrogen arm on the corresponding link , @xmath11 to lone pair arm and @xmath12 for no arm .",
    "the constraints between @xmath13 and @xmath6 being , @xmath14 which imply that every water molecule has two hydrogen and two lone - pair arms only .",
    "a hydrogen bond is realized when two water molecules two lattice units apart have one of each s hydrogen and lone - pair arms meet at a site , as shown in fig.([fig_allowedconfigs ] ) .",
    "when two molecules are on near - neighbor sites they are disallowed to have any non - zero bond arm on the link between them .",
    "the constraint is given by : @xmath15 we write a general interaction hamiltonian in terms of @xmath16 field as below : @xmath17 where , @xmath18 is interaction strength and @xmath19 , @xmath20 denote directions around site @xmath7 .",
    "there are additional restrictions on @xmath16 field , namely , + ( i ) at any site no more than two bond arms meet i.e. , @xmath21 ( ii ) two non - zero bond arms are disallowed from meeting at a site i.e. , anti - bonds are disallowed , @xmath22 the grand canonical partition function for the system at a finite chemical potential @xmath23 for water and inverse temperature @xmath24 is given by : @xmath25 \\label{partitionfunction}\\ ] ] where , the prime over summation indicates that the @xmath13 and @xmath6 sum have to be carried out in compliance with eqs.([h2constraint],[hconstraint],[unoccupied_hconstraint],[unoccupied_h2values],[unoccupied_hvalues ] ) . evaluating @xmath26 amounts to enumerating all possible bond configurations that satisfy above constraints and calculating the exponential in eq.([partitionfunction ] ) for those configurations over allowed range of @xmath27 and @xmath16 at fixed values of @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath28 the volume of the system .",
    "the restrictions represented by eqs.([unoccupied_hconstraint],[unoccupied_h2values],[unoccupied_hvalues ] ) are at sites where there is no water .",
    "these are shown in fig.([fig_disallowedconfigs ] ) . to implement them in our analysis",
    "it is useful to define two discrete integer fields @xmath29 , @xmath30 :    [ bqdefinition ] @xmath31    the discrete field @xmath29 counts the number of non - zero arms in the neighborhood of site @xmath7 , while @xmath30 measures the charge i.e , difference between number of hydrogen arms and lone - pair arms meeting at site @xmath7 . by construction",

    "furthermore , for @xmath35 we demand @xmath36 to disallow anti - bond configurations . in terms of these variables , eqs.([unoccupied_hconstraint],[unoccupied_h2values],[unoccupied_hvalues ] ) can be rewritten as : @xmath37 where , @xmath29 and @xmath30 values are restricted only to the above set of mutually exclusive pairs .",
