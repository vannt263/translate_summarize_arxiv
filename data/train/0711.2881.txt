    "in fig . [ tfjfe ] , we show the local tully - fisher relation ( tfr ) in k - band , as well as the specific angular momentum of the disk j@xmath2 vs. the rotational velocity v@xmath0 . in both relations",
    ", v@xmath0 is taken as a proxy for the total mass .",
    "noteworthy , the local tfr was carefully derived comparing three different local samples ( see top - left inset and @xcite ) .",
    "strikingly , the mw systematically falls at @xmath4 1 @xmath3 of these relations , conversely to m31 : the mw has a smaller stellar mass and specific angular momentum , compared to local galaxies of similar total mass . on the basis of their location in the ( m@xmath1 , v@xmath0 , r@xmath5 ) volume , the fraction of spirals like the mw is @xmath47% , while m31 appears to be a much more typical spiral ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the representativity of the mw as a typical spiral galaxy is actually even smaller , if one takes into account the iron abundance of the stellar halo ( see right panel ) .     vs. v@xmath0 relation for three local galaxy samples ( blue triangles from @xcite , red dots from @xcite , and black squares from @xcite ) .",
    "solid lines show the fits for the combined three samples , and the dashed lines the residual 1 @xmath3 dispersion .",
    "the locations of the mw and m31 are marked by two large green dots . in the top - left panel insert ,",
    "we show the individual fits of the tf relations for each of the three samples ( see more details in @xcite ) . in the middle panel ,",
    "open stars show results of simulations by @xcite , illustrating the difficulty in reproducing the angular momentum of spiral galaxies when using the standard model for disk formation . _",
    "right panel : _ iron abundances of stellar haloes of eight spiral galaxies ( from @xcite ) vs. log(v@xmath0 ) ( small red points ) .",
    "large green points mark the position of the milky way and m31 .",
    "the full line assumes m@xmath6v@xmath7 @xcite and m@xmath6z@xmath8 following the prescription of @xcite .",
    "red dashed lines identify a box including the color measurements of @xcite , after stacking 1047 edge - on sdss galaxies , and assuming that their colors are dominated by red giant stars.,width=453 ]",
    "one can explain the differences between the mw and m31 by the absence of significant merger events over the last 10 - 11 gyr for the former . on the contrary",
    ", m31 has been much more influenced by mergers ( and possibly a major merger ) during the last 8 gyrs ( see @xcite for a detailed discussion ) .",
    "could the bulk of local spirals be shaped and assembled through a rich past merger history during the last 8 gyrs ?",
    "such a scenario is indeed suggested by direct observations of violent dynamical processes at work in z@xmath40.6 galaxies @xcite , and by the relatively important major merger rate per m * galaxy during the last 11 gyrs ( 0.5 - 0.7 up to z@xmath41 , see @xcite , and 4 - 5 up to z@xmath43 , see @xcite ) . in this context",
    ", rich major merger episodes in the past may explain the tully - fisher relation , the angular momentum problem and the abundances of stars in spiral outskirts .",
    "what remains unclear is whether or not these properties could be explained by the standard scenario for spiral formation , i.e. , a monolithic collapse followed by pure secular evolution .",
