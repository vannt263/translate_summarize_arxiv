    "since the beginning of financial science , stock prices , option prices and other quantities have been described by stochastic and partial differential equations . since the 1980s however , the path integral approach , created in the context of quantum mechanics by richard feynman @xcite , has been introduced to the field of finance @xcite .",
    "earlier , norbert wiener @xcite , in his studies on brownian motion and the langevin equation , used a type of functional integral that turns out to be a special case of the feynman path integral ( see also mark kac @xcite , and for a general overview see kleinert @xcite and schulman @xcite ) .",
    "the power of path - integration for finance ( @xcite,@xcite )  lies in its ability to naturally account for payoffs that are path - dependent .",
    "this makes path integration the method of choice to treat one of the most challenging types of derivatives , the path - dependent options .",
    "feynman and kleinert @xcite showed how quantum - mechanical partition functions can be approximated by an effective classical partition function , a technique which has been successfully applied to the pricing of path - dependent options ( see ref . @xcite and references therein , and refs .",
    "@xcite for recent applications ) .",
    "there exist many different types of path - dependent options .",
    "the two types which are considered in this paper are asian and barrier options .",
    "asian options are exotic path - dependent options for which the payoff depends on the average price of the underlying asset during the lifetime of the option @xcite .",
    "one distinguishes between _ average price _ and _ average strike _ asian options . the average price asian option has been treated in the context of path integrals by linetsky @xcite .",
    "the payoff of an average price is given by @xmath0 and @xmath1 for a call and put option respectively . here",
    "@xmath2 is the strike price and @xmath3 denotes the average price of the underlying asset at maturity @xmath4 .",
    "@xmath3 can either be the arithmetical or geometrical average of the asset price .",
    "average price asian options cost less than plain vanilla options .",
    "they are useful in protecting the owner from sudden short - lasting price changes in the market , for example due to order imbalances @xcite .",
    "average strike options are characterized by the following payoffs : @xmath5 and @xmath6 for a call and put option respectively , where @xmath7 is the price of the underlying asset at maturity @xmath4 .",
    "barrier options are options with an extra boundary condition .",
    "if the asset price of such an option reaches the barrier during the lifetime of the option , the option becomes worthless , otherwise the option has the same payoff as the option on which the barrier has been imposed .",
    "( for more information on exit - time problems see ref . @xcite and the references therein )    in section [ average strike option ] we treat the geometrically averaged asian option . in section",
    "[ 1 ] the asset price propagator for this standard asian option is derived within the path integral framework in a similar fashion as in ref .",
    "@xcite for the weighted asian option .",
    "the underlying principle of this derivation is the effective classical partition function technique developed by feynman and kleinert @xcite . in section",
    "[ 2 ]  we present an alternative derivation of this propagator using a stochastic calculus approach .",
    "this propagator now allows us to price both the average price and average strike asian option . for both types of options",
    "this results in a pricing formula which is of the same form as the black - scholes formula for the plain vanilla option .",
    "our result for the option price of an average price asian option confirms the result found in the literature @xcite . for the average strike option no formula of this simplicity exists as far as we know .",
    "our derivation and analysis of this formula is presented in section [ 3 ] , where our result is checked with a monte carlo simulation . in section [ 4 ]  we impose a boundary condition on the asian option in the form of a barrier on a control process , and check whether the method used in section [ average strike option ] is still valid when this boundary condition is imposed on the propagator for the normal asian option , using the method of images . finally in section [ 5 ] we draw conclusions .",
    "the path integral propagator is used in financial science to track the probability distribution of the logreturn @xmath8 at time @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the initial value of the underlying asset .",

    "the payoff is a function of the average value of the asset .",

    "when @xmath3 is the geometric average of the asset price , then @xmath20 is an algebraic average . @xmath21 the key step to treat asian options within the path integral framework is to partition the set of all paths into subsets of paths , where each path in a given subset has the same average @xmath20",

( [ versch_corr_artikel ] ) shows the option price for an asian option with a barrier as a function of the initial asset price belonging to the @xmath63 process , defined by : @xmath84 .",
    "[ h ]    figure2.eps    this figure shows that the analytical result derived in section [ derivation of the option price ] deviates from the monte carlo simulation with increasing correlation .",
    "the approximate nature of our approach can be understood as follows .",
    "the essence of the approach presented here is that to calculate the price of asian barrier options , two steps need to be taken .",
    "first , a partitioning of paths according to the average along the path must be performed , and second , the method of images must be used in order to cancel out paths which have reached the barrier .",
    "the difficulty combining these two steps , is that mirror paths have a different average than the original paths , and thus belong to a different partition .",
    "this difficulty can apparently be overcome by treating the average itself as a separate , correlated process ( as proposed in ref .",
    "this procedure , relating @xmath85 to @xmath32 , leads to the correct propagator ( and price ) in the case of a plain asian option as shown in section [ 2 ] .    however , from the results shown in fig .",
    "[ versch_corr_artikel ] it is clear that this is no longer the case for an asian option with a barrier on a correlated control process .",
    "this is because the exact average of the @xmath62 process does not behave as a separate , correlated process ( the average described by this process is henceforth called the approximate average ) .",
    "this approach is exact for a plain asian option , where all paths contribute , but when a barrier is implemented using the method of images , and thus eliminating some of the paths , the following approximation is made .",
    "when the @xmath63 process hits the barrier and is thus eliminated , its corresponding @xmath62 and @xmath86 processes are eliminated as well .",
    "but the @xmath86 process considered in our derivation is only approximate , so the wrong @xmath86 paths are eliminated .",
    "the central question is whether this will lead to a difference between the distribution of contributing paths for the exact averages and the corresponding distribution for the approximate averages , when a barrier has been implemented .",
    "figure 3 shows that this is indeed the case , and that this difference increases when correlation increases .",
    "[ h ]    figure3.eps    when the correlation is zero , the paths which are eliminated for both the exact and the approximate average are randomly distributed ( because the behavior of @xmath86 has nothing to do with the behavior of @xmath63 ) , which means that both distributions remain the same gaussian as they would be without a barrier .",
    "this is the reason why our result is exact when correlation is zero .",
    "another source of approximation lies in the use of the black - scholes model which has well - known limitations @xcite .",
    "several other types of market models propose to overcome such limitations , for example by introducing additional ad hoc stochastic variables @xcite or by improving the description of the behavior of buyers / sellers @xcite .",
    "the extension of the present work to for example the heston model lies beyond the scope of this article .",
    "in this paper , we derived a closed - form pricing formula for an average price as well as an average strike geometric asian option within the path integral framework .",
    "the result for the average price asian option corresponds to that found by linetsky @xcite , using the effective classical partition function technique developed by feynman and kleinert @xcite .",
    "the result for the average strike asian option was compared to a monte carlo simulation .",
    "we found that the agreement between the numerical simulation and the analytical result for an average strike asian option is such that they coincide to within a relative error of less than 0.3 % for at least 500 000 samples and 100 time steps .",
    "furthermore , a pricing formula for an asian option with a barrier on a control process was developed .",
    "this is an asian option with the additional condition that the payoff is zero whenever the value of @xmath87the control process crosses a certain predetermined barrier .",
    "the pricing of this option was performed by constructing a new propagator which consisted of a linear combination of two propagators for a regular asian option .",
    "the resulting pricing formula is exact when the correlation is zero , and is approximate when the correlation increases .",
    "the central approximation made in our derivation , is that the process for the average logreturn @xmath86 is treated as a stochastic process , which is correlated with the process of the logreturn @xmath62 .",
    "this assumption is correct whenever all price - paths contribute to the total sum , but becomes approximate when a boundary condition is applied .",
