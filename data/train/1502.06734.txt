    "the virial series - expansion coefficients of the pressure have been computed through relatively high orders for the monomer - dimer ( md ) models on various infinite regular lattices . presently , they are tabulated [ ] through order @xmath9 for the tetrahedral lattice and through order @xmath10 for the hexagonal lattice [ ] .",
    "moreover , they are known for the triangular and the face - centered - cubic lattices through the orders @xmath11 and @xmath12 respectively [ ] . in the case of the linear lattice [ ] and of the bethe lattice [ ] , they are all known .",
    "we have recently computed [ ] the expansions through the order @xmath13 for the @xmath14 lattices in @xmath15 , and for the ( hyper)-simple - cubic lattices , through order @xmath13 in the case of the square , cubic and @xmath16 lattices , through the orders @xmath17 and @xmath18 in dimensions @xmath19 and @xmath20 respectively , and finally [ ] in general dimensions @xmath21 through the order @xmath22 .",
    "long ago , heilmann and lieb [ ] have studied the md models also on finite graphs .",
    "they have shown that the zeroes of the matching generating polynomial @xmath23 of a graph lie only on the real negative axis of the complex @xmath24 plane .",
    "for the md gas on a finite lattice , this implies the absence of any phase - transition in the thermodynamic limit .    in this paper , we show that the first @xmath22 coefficients of the virial expansion on hypercubic infinite regular lattices of any dimension are positive . with the knowledge that all the coefficients computed so far for the virial expansions of the md models on all infinite regular lattices are positive ,",
    "we are led to _ conjecture _ that _ all _ the virial coefficients are positive for the infinite regular lattice models .    using the definition of the graph dimer entropy [ ] , we argue that for a finite regular graph the bounds which correspond to the positivity of the virial coefficients @xmath25 for infinite regular lattices are @xmath26 with @xmath27 and @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the matching number of @xmath30 , i.e. the maximum number of pairwise disjoint edges of @xmath30 .    we have systematically tested the validity of eq .",
    "( [ delta0 ] ) within two classes of finite graphs related to infinite regular lattices .",
    "the first class consists of the graphs induced by finite grids , the second consists of the biconnected regular simple graphs .",
    "the tests of eq .",
    "( [ delta0 ] ) for the latter class have been performed by exhaustively generating the biconnected regular graphs having a not too large number of vertices @xmath6 , with the aid of the _ nauty _ program [ ] via the _ sage _ interface [ ] .",
    "the results of our survey are summarized in a set of schematic tables reported in the fourth section .",
    "we have firstly restricted our attention to the class of finite lattices , being interested in finding sequences of finite lattices with no violations of the bounds in eq .",
    "( [ delta0 ] ) .",
    "this would indicate that all the virial coefficients are positive for the corresponding infinite regular lattices . even though the bounds in eq .",
    "( [ delta0 ] ) have been derived only for regular graphs , it is however interesting to consider them also in the case of finite grids with open boundary conditions ( @xmath31 ) , ( which clearly are not regular on the boundary ) .    in summary , we found violations only for `` narrow '' lattices .",
    "this fact supports the conclusion that the bounds are not violated in the limit of infinite lattices .",
    "we then turned to the more general class of the bipartite biconnected regular simple graphs .",
    "for the @xmath32-regular graphs , we were able to test these bounds for @xmath33 vertices .",
    "we have observed a few violations of the bounds for @xmath34 , but the frequency of these violations decreases regularly for @xmath35 .    in the case of the bipartite biconnected @xmath36-regular graphs , we have tested eq .",
    "( [ delta0 ] ) for @xmath37 .",
    "we have observed a single violation for @xmath38 .",
    "the frequency of the violations is even lower for @xmath39 .    in the case of",
    "the bipartite biconnected @xmath40-regular graphs with @xmath41 , we could carry our tests only for @xmath42 , finding a single violation , that occurs in a @xmath43-regular graph .    when considering the non - bipartite biconnected @xmath32-regular graphs , we observed few violations for @xmath37 , starting from @xmath44 ; again the frequency of the violations decreases regularly after the first violation , for even values of @xmath45 .",
    "notice that there are no such graphs with @xmath6 odd .    in the case of the non - bipartite",
    "biconnected @xmath36-regular graphs , the frequency of the violations decreases regularly for even @xmath6 after the first violation and a similar trend is observed for odd @xmath6 .",
    "we could complete the tests only for @xmath46",
    ". in this case one has to consider over @xmath47 million graphs .",
    "based on the results of our survey , we are led to _ conjecture _ that , for biconnected regular graphs , the bounds are violated with a frequency that vanishes as @xmath48 .",
    "let us now observe that the validity of the bounds of eq .",
    "( [ delta0 ] ) in the case @xmath49 follows from the heilmann - lieb inequality eq .",

    "( [ hlk ] ) , with @xmath55 , on lattice graphs give more violations than for eq .",
    "( [ delta0 ] ) .",
    "therefore the examination of these lattices still gives some indication , though not as clear as in the case of eq .",
    "( [ delta0 ] ) , that the bounds eq .",

    "we have also shown that , for any @xmath6 , the bounds of eqs .",
    "( [ delta0 ] , [ hlk ] ) are satisfied by the approximate distribution of bipartite regular random - graph obtained in [ ] . in the case of bipartite regular biconnected graphs , we argue that a conjecture on the entropy for these graphs , made in [ ] , implies the conjecture that for @xmath48 the frequency of the violations tends to zero .    in all the tests performed on regular biconnected graphs ( over more than @xmath56 million graphs ) , eq .",
    "( [ hlk ] ) is valid for @xmath57 .",
    "we shall discuss also the corresponding upper bounds on @xmath3 ; the examples considered indicate that in the case of bipartite regular biconnected graphs they are less strict than the upper matching conjecture ( umc ) [ ] , when the latter applies .",
    "let us mention that while the umc conjecture has not been yet proven , the lower asymptotic matching conjecture stated in [ ] has been proven in [ ] and [ ] .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the second section , using a simple relation between the coefficients of the virial expansion of the pressure and the expansion coefficients of the dimer entropy , we prove that on hypercubic lattices the virial coefficients through order @xmath22 are positive for generic @xmath58 . in the third section ,",
