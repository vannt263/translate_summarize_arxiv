    "self - similarity is a recurring theme in strongly nonlinear systems",
    ". its observation can be particularly informative as it implies an underlying symmetry , which can be exploited mathematically through symmetry reduction techniques  @xcite .",
    "in nonlinear optics , self - similarity emerges in the formation of cantor - set fractals in materials that support spatial solitons @xcite , the self - collapse of beams at high powers @xcite , and in the propagation of ultrafast pulses of light in optical fiber amplifiers in the presence of strong kerr nonlinearity  @xcite . in recent years",
    ", it was reported that self - similar propagation of short pulses in laser resonators is possible  @xcite .",
    "these pulses have a nearly parabolic intensity profile and evolve self - similarly within the nonlinear segments of the laser cavity .",
    "fiber lasers supporting self - similarly evolving pulses is now recognized as new regime of pulse formation in the cavity of an ultrafast laser .",
    "this method is differentiated from the well - known solitary  @xcite , stretched - pulse ( dispersion - managed )  @xcite and all - normal - dispersion  @xcite solutions to the haus master equation  @xcite .",
    "there are interesting similarities as well as important differences between these regimes . from a practical point of view",
    ", the demonstration of the similariton laser has led to the development of fiber lasers with significantly higher pulse energies  @xcite .",
    "these fiber lasers are being studied by many groups @xcite , motivated by the various applications ultrafast lasers have in diverse areas of physics , from optical frequency metrology and material processing to next - generation accelerators .",
    "more recently , a new mode - locking regime , the soliton - similariton laser was reported , in which the pulse evolution is in the form of periodic alteration between soliton and similariton evolution  @xcite .",
    "one aspect of this regime is that the evolution is strongly nonlinear at every point in the laser cavity .",
    "the possibilities and limitations of this regime are largely in need of exploration , for which theoretical modeling is crucial .",
    "for all of these reasons , there is much desire to understand the physics of amplifier similaritons and self - similar lasers better .",
    "numerical simulations provide good agreement with experiments @xcite .",
    "however , they are computationally expensive , rendering extended explorations of the parameter space impractical . moreover",
    ", a theoretical description can aid intuitive understanding of the dynamics of self - similar evolution in optical amplifiers and lasers .",
    "exact self - similar solutions have been derived for the optical pulse propagation in fibers with and without gain  @xcite .",
    "however , the pulse shape evolves during propagation , and the self - similar parabolic pulse profile is only asymptotically reached .",
    "thus , several approaches have been explored to derive a simplified description which still captures the rich pulse dynamics in such systems .",
    "based on various analytical methods , the pulse formation , pulse stability and energy scalability of similariton and other high - energy fiber lasers has been studied @xcite . also semi - analytic approaches , widely used in optics to investigate pulse propagation , have been employed .",
    "they aim to extract evolution equations for characteristic pulse parameters , reducing the partial differential equation for pulse propagation to a coupled set of ordinary differential equations .",
    "such approaches are typically based on the method of moments ( mom ) or a variational formalism , which have both been used to investigate the evolution of the pulse energy and the temporal and spectral pulse width in the strongly nonlinear regime @xcite . such studies typically rely on fixed pulse shapes such as gaussian or sech pulses , yielding reasonable estimates for the pulse energy and duration , but no pulse shape information at all .",
    "an exception can be found in @xcite , where an adaptive super - gaussian test function was used to investigate changes of the pulse profile during propagation .    here",
    ", we report on a semi - analytic theory for the pulse dynamics in similariton amplifiers and lasers including the soliton - similariton laser , based on a novel model pulse with adaptive shape .",
    "the key in this formulation is our ansatz function that can describe any pulse shape from a pure gaussian to a pure parabolic profile , even including @xmath0-like pulses ( i.e. , with @xmath1 intensity profile ) , the shape of a soliton .",
    "the pulse profile is tweaked by a single parameter , which is complemented by an additional degree of freedom for the pulse phase .",
    "this allows us to represent various pulse profiles as well as complex spectral shapes .",
    "thus , our theoretical treatment appears to be capable of describing not only the self - similar but the other regimes as well , opening the way to a simple unified theoretical approach .    employing the method of moments @xcite , the partial differential equation governing the pulse propagation",
    "is reduced to a finite set of coupled ordinary differential equations , which are much easier to analyze . in addition , the coefficients of the equations are helpful in forming an intuitive understanding of the dynamics by exposing the relative importance of the various effects . through investigation of these equations one gains access to valuable information about the pulse dynamics , e.g. , of",
    "how exactly the various effects on the pulse are paired to balance each other to satisfy the periodic boundary conditions imposed by the laser resonator .",
    "such information is extremely difficult , if not impossible , to obtain by repeated numerical solutions of the full governing equation .",
    "our approach is validated against numerical results for single - pass propagation and for the steady state dynamics of a soliton - similariton laser .",
    "for propagation through a dispersive kerr medium with a parabolic gain and instantaneously saturable absorption , the evolution of the pulse envelope @xmath2 is described by a generalized nonlinear schrdinger ( or complex ginzburg - landau ) equation of the form @xcite @xmath3 here , @xmath4 and @xmath5are the propagation coordinate and the retarded time , respectively .",
    "@xmath6 is the second order dispersion coefficient , and @xmath7 is the cubic nonlinearity parameter .",
    "the dissipative processes are characterized by the central gain value @xmath8 and spectral gain parameter @xmath9 as well as the saturable absorption coefficient @xmath10 .",
    "generally , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 , and @xmath10 are @xmath4 dependent , since an optical system such as a fiber laser consists of a sequence of different segments . additionally , the parameter values can vary even within a segment , for example @xmath8 if gain saturation is considered .      for linear systems , @xmath11 ,",
    "the complex gaussian@xmath12 with @xmath13 is an exact solution to eq.([nse ] ) , where @xmath14 denotes the normalized time , and @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the pulse duration , amplitude , phase and linear chirp parameter , respectively .",
    "thus , for moderate nonlinearity , the gaussian ansatz is still a good description of the steady - state pulse shape in a laser cavity @xcite .",
    "in contrast , in the strongly nonlinear limit , the pulse is approximately described by a self - similar pulse with a parabolic intensity profile .",
    "however , an exactly parabolic pulse is an idealization and in practice the pulse shape is parabolic around the center , where most of the energy resides , but with a super - gaussian fall - off in the wings  @xcite .",
    "naturally , in the intermediate regime , the pulse shape combines features of a gaussian pulse and a self - similar pulse .",
    "to reflect these properties , we have previously introduced a function of the type @xmath19 to describe the pulse profile , which represents a gaussian for @xmath20 and a parabolic profile for @xmath21 @xcite . here , the pulse duration @xmath22 represents the gaussian pulse width for @xmath20 and half the total pulse width of a similariton for @xmath21 .",
    "this ansatz has been shown to be useful for the description of similariton lasers and trapped bose - einstein condensates @xcite .    a disadvantage of eq.([pn ] )",
    "is that the pulse shape can not be adapted continuously , but only in discrete steps . using the gauss hypergeometric function @xmath23@xmath24 for which efficient numerical evaluation routines exist @xcite , eq.([pn ] ) can be expressed in closed form as @xmath25   \\right\\ }   , \\label{pn2}%\\ ] ] see also appendix [ aa ] . in eq.([pn2 ] ) , @xmath26 is not restricted to integers , providing much more flexibility for describing different pulse shapes .",
    "for example , @xmath1-like intensity profiles , corresponding to a fundamental optical soliton , are very well represented by @xmath27 .",
    "moreover , rather than a priory fixing @xmath26 to a certain value , we allow @xmath28 to evolve during pulse propagation , describing the position dependent intensity profile together with the parameters @xmath29 and @xmath30 . along with @xmath31 ,",
    "the third order chirp parameter @xmath32 is introduced as a further degree of freedom for the pulse phase in addition to @xmath33 and @xmath34 , to avoid mathematical problems with the evolution equations for the pulse parameters @xcite .",
    "the resulting ansatz for the envelope is given by@xmath35 naturally , eq.([pn2 ] ) is not the only function which is able to interpolate continuously between a parabolic and a gaussian shape . in particular ,",
    "the so - called q - gaussian function @xcite has been used in various contexts , e.g. , for the description of trapped bose - einstein condensates @xcite .",
    "while the q - gaussian has a somewhat simpler analytical form , it is non - zero only on a finite interval ( except for the limiting case of a gaussian ) , which is unphysical for the applications considered in this paper .",
    "additionally , our ansatz has the distinct advantage that it can also represent a @xmath1 profile to a very good approximation , which is essential for a versatile description of nonlinear optical propagation .      the generalized nonlinear schrdinger equation eq.([nse ] )",
    "can be approximately solved by extracting evolution equations for the parameters of the model pulse eq.([ansatz ] ) .",

    "the gaussian approach ( dotted lines ) shows some deviations in the pulse duration and especially the amplitude , but overall still provides a reasonable fit in time domain , see fig.[fig3](a ) , ( c ) , ( e ) .",
    "however , it naturally fails to reproduce the pulse shapes . especially for strongly self - similar propagation as shown in fig.[fig3](c ) , where both our ansatz and the exact result exhibit a distinct parabolic intensity profile , the gaussian ansatz does not approximate the pulse shape well . regarding the obtained power spectra ,",
    "see fig.[fig3](b ) , ( d ) , ( f ) , the gaussian ansatz completely fails to reproduce the spectral features .",
    "the capability to faithfully reproduce spectral characteristics is particularly important from a practical point of view : experimentally , optical spectra provide the most direct , immediately available and quite informative insight into the evolution of an ultrafast pulse among all the diagnostics at the disposal of the researcher .      in the following , we apply our approach to self - similar propagation in a laser cavity , where the laser field is subject to periodic boundary conditions in steady state operation .",
    "we choose a soliton - similariton laser setup as investigated in  @xcite , which is especially interesting in our context since the pulse undergoes self - similar propagation as well as reshaping to gaussian and @xmath90 profiles in the same cavity . in our case ,",
    "the setup consists of a gain fiber , a piece of single mode fiber ( smf ) , a saturable absorber ( sa ) , a bandpass filter , and again an smf .",
    "the pulse evolves self - similarly in the gain fiber , and is temporally and spectrally filtered in the sa and bandpass filter , respectively .",
    "the group velocity dispersion ( gvd ) in the smf is negative , approximately canceling the positive gvd in the gain fiber .",
    "several distinct nonlinear pulse shapes co - exist in the cavity : a parabolic profile is obtained towards the end of the the gain fiber , characteristic for self - similar evolution , then the pulse undergoes gaussian spectral filtering and approaches a @xmath90 shape in the smf , typical for a fundamental soliton .",
    "the parameter values for the gain fiber ( smf ) are @xmath91 ( @xmath92 ) , @xmath93 ( @xmath94 ) , @xmath95 ( @xmath96 ) , and @xmath97 ( @xmath96 )  @xcite .",

    "the bandpass filter is modeled by a segment of length @xmath101 with @xmath102 , corresponding to a spectral width of @xmath103 ( fwhm ) , and the pulse power is additionally reduced by a factor of @xmath104 to account for the overall linear loss of the optical cavity elements . for the sa , an unsaturated loss of @xmath105 and a saturation power of @xmath106",
    "is assumed ; its implementation is discussed in appendix [ ac ] .    ) numerically . ]    ( a ) . ]    in fig.[fig4 ] , the mom and full numerical results for the evolution of characteristic pulse parameters in the cavity are compared , where the sequence of optical elements and the fiber lengths are as indicated in fig.[fig4](a ) .",
    "the pulse parameters are defined as described in section [ comp2 ] .",
    "the overall agreement between semi - analytic and numerical results is again excellent , compare fig.([fig2 ] ) .",
    "particularly , as can be seen in fig.[fig4](c ) , our ansatz eq.([ansatz ] ) correctly predicts the almost parabolic pulse profile in the gain segment , with @xmath83 for a parabolic pulse , the gaussian shape after the filter ( @xmath82 ) , as well as the @xmath90 shape in the smf , corresponding to @xmath107 . in fig.[fig5 ] , the instantaneous power and power spectrum are shown after the gain fiber , before the sa , after the bandpass filter , and after the second smf .",
    "the overall agreement between semi - analytic ( solid lines ) and numerical results ( dashed lines ) is very good both in the gain fiber and the smf .",
    "especially , ansatz eq.([ansatz ] ) approximates well the distinct temporal and spectral pulse shapes in the different regimes . for comparison ,",
    "also the gaussian solution is displayed ( dotted line ) .",
    "it provides a reasonable fit to the temporal and spectral width , but naturally can not reproduce the pulse shape at all . only after the bandpass filter , which forces the power spectrum to assume a gaussian profile , the gaussian ansatz closely matches the numerical solution ( see fig.[fig5](f ) , ( h ) ) .",
    "in conclusion , we have developed a semi - analytic theory for nonlinear optical ultrafast pulse propagation in the self - similar and other regimes , which we employ to study the pulse dynamics in similariton amplifiers and lasers .",
    "the key is the introduction of a model pulse with adaptive shape , which can continuously be tweaked with a single parameter to represent pulse shapes ranging from parabolic to gaussian to @xmath1-like intensity profiles .",
    "thus , very different regimes of nonlinear optical propagation can be covered .",
    "based on the method of moments , evolution equations are derived for the characteristic pulse parameters , specifying the pulse amplitude , duration , profile , and linear and third order chirp . comparison to exact analytical or full numerical results were performed for the soliton regime as well as similariton amplifiers and soliton - similariton lasers , showing excellent agreement .",
    "this constitutes a semi - analytic model for the soliton - similariton laser .",
    "a major advantage of the semi - analytic method is that the calculations are approximately  @xmath108 times faster than the full numerical simulations .",
    "this will allow the exploration of a vast parameter range of interest to the design of fiber and solid state similariton lasers .",
    "furthermore , this approach can be helpful for developing an intuitive understanding of the dynamics of self - similar evolution in optical fiber systems by exposing the relative importance of the various effects .",
    "due to the versatility of our test function , we expect it to also prove useful in other application areas in nonlinear optics , or in completely different fields such as the description of trapped bose - einstein condensates , as already exemplified in @xcite .",
