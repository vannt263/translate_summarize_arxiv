    "the study of eleven dimensional supergravity provided many of the early insights into kaluza - klein theory and this has taken on a new significance through applications in holography @xcite .",
    "of particular interest are supersymmetric solutions that contain an explicit @xmath6 factor with @xmath7 , since each of these are expected to provide holographic duals of supersymmetric ground states in superconformal field theories .",
    "our understanding of holographic field theories in three dimensions was taken to a much higher level by fundamental developments on the gauge theory side @xcite and this stimulated development and analysis of gravity duals in m theory .",
    "in particular , this provided an even greater impetus to understand better the landscape of @xmath1 solutions in eleven - dimensional supergravity .",
    "our purpose here is to analyze a new potential class of @xmath1 solutions with fluxes and exhibit a new such supergravity solution with @xmath8 supersymmetry .    specifically , we study solutions of eleven - dimensional supergravity in which the metric takes the form : @xmath9 and the warp factor @xmath10 is a function of the co - ordinates , @xmath11 , on the internal seven - manifold",
    ". we will allow for a non - vanishing membrane charge but we take the five - brane charge to be zero : @xmath12 for all four cycles @xmath13 .",
    "the prototypical class of such solutions are due to freund and rubin @xcite @xmath14 where @xmath15 to preserve supersymmetry in a generic freund - rubin solution ( as opposed to the special @xmath3 solution ) there are additional geometric constraints .",
    "in particular , for @xmath16-supersymmetry to be preserved , the internal manifold @xmath17 must be sasaki - einstein ( @xmath18 ) and the dual superconformal field theory in three dimensions has @xmath8 supersymmetry .",
    "seven dimensional , homogeneous , regular sasaki - einstein manifolds have been classified @xcite and the five such manifolds are usually labelled : @xmath19 an infinite class of non - homogeneous but explicitly known sasaki - einstein metrics ( referred to here as the gmsw solutions ) was constructed in @xcite and this class of explicit @xmath18 metrics was further enlarged in @xcite .",
    "a natural generalization of the freund - rubin solutions is to allow for @xmath20 to be non - vanishing on the internal manifold , @xmath17",
    ". we will consider such solutions here but our solutions will only carry dielectric five - brane charge , that is , they will not have a net five - brane charge as implied by . in this sense",
    "we are looking for solutions that correspond to the near horizon limit of membranes in eleven dimensions .",
    "somewhat surprisingly , there is a distinct paucity of explicit examples of this form in the current literature .",
    "the existing solutions are related to uplifts of critical points of four dimensional , @xmath21 gauged supergravity @xcite . thanks to the proof that the @xmath2 theory is a consistent truncation of eleven dimensional supergravity @xcite one can claim that any critical point of the seventy - dimensional scalar potential lifts to a solution of the @xmath22 theory although , in practice , performing this lift explicitly can be prohibitively difficult .",
    "only one non - trivial critical point of the @xmath21 theory preserves @xmath16-supersymmetry @xcite and this solution is characterized by the fact that it preserves @xmath23 subspace of the @xmath24 global symmetries .",
    "the lift of the @xmath23 invariant fixed point was performed in @xcite along with the entire supersymmetric domain wall @xcite that connects this critical point to the critical point at the origin .",
    "the lift of the @xmath23 invariant fixed point ( referred to here as the cpw solution ) , is interesting in its own right as a solution of the eleven - dimensional theory as it is the first explicit example of a supersymmetric @xmath1 solution with an internal flux but only electric membrane charge .",
    "the internal manifold , @xmath17 , of the cpw solution has the topology of @xmath3 which , for our purposes , is best viewed as a fibration of @xmath25 over an interval @xmath26 . the group of isometries of the metric is @xmath27 but the four form flux is charged under one of the @xmath28 s and thus breaks this symmetry group to @xmath23 .",
    "interestingly , one can show that , for the cpw solution , the components of @xmath20 on the internal manifold are proportional to the holomorphic two form ( and its complex conjugate ) on @xmath29 and this is the origin of the breaking of the @xmath28 symmetry of the hopf fiber of @xmath30 . the @xmath28 charge of the four - form flux arises in much the same manner as it does in the non - supersymmetric solutions of @xcite where charge of the holomorphic three - form on @xmath31 is required for global regularity .",
    "our purpose here is to use the structure of the cpw solution as a template for more general solutions .",
    "indeed , it was observed in @xcite that while one can locally replace the @xmath32 by any khler - einstein 4-manifold and still solve the field equations this will introduce singularities in @xmath17 at a particular endpoint of the interval @xmath26 .",
    "nonetheless , it is conceivable that a full analysis of the bps equations could reveal further integration constants which allow the singularities to be avoided by judicious choices of boundary conditions of @xmath26 .",
    "this is the spirit of construction of sasaki - einstein metrics in @xcite , which resolves the singularities uncovered in @xcite .",
    "our ansatz will be designed to follow up this observation , we consider an internal seven - manifold , , which is @xmath33 fibered over an interval @xmath26 and the three - form potential , , is proportional to a one - form wedged with the the holomorphic two form inherited from the khler - einstein four manifold inside the @xmath34 .",
    "we reduce the bps equations for this ansatz to a pair of o.d.e.s @xmath35 in these equations , @xmath36 is the warp factor of the four / seven split of the eleven - dimensional metric and is also the rotation parameter in the di - electric spinor .",
    "the function , @xmath37 , has a more complicated but explicit relation to the rest of the ansatz and essentially governs how the supersymmetry mixes between the internal manifold and the radial @xmath38 direction .",
    "having derived the bps equations , we also do some numerical analysis on the solution space , paying careful attention to regularity .",
    "interestingly , our work is orthogonal to the work @xcite where large families of @xmath16-bps , @xmath1 solutions have been constructed in iia supergravity with non - vanishing romans mass @xcite .",
    "solutions with non - vanishing romans mass can not be lifted to eleven - dimensional supergravity and , conversely , our ansatz can not be reduced to supersymmetric solutions of iia supergravity because the residual @xmath28 symmetry in our ansatz is the @xmath39-symmetry and so compactification along this @xmath28 will break the supersymmetry .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section 2 we outline our ansatz and the methods we have used to reduce the bps conditions to a pair of ode s . in section 3 we review the known analytic solutions to this ansatz . in section 4",
    "we numerically solve the pair of ode s .",
    "we reproduce the known analytic solution and produce a new solution with the topology of @xmath3 .",
    "* note added : * while preparing this paper for submission we became aware of the work @xcite which may have some overlap with our paper .",
    "while our solution space will ultimately be determined by just two functions , @xmath40 and @xmath41 we first outline our complete ansatz .",
    "the metric is : @xmath42 where @xmath43 and all functions depend only on @xmath44 , which parametrizes the interval , @xmath26 .",
    "the end - points of @xmath26 will be determined by regularity .",

    "using techniques similar to @xcite , we require that @xmath16-supersymmetry is preserved .",
