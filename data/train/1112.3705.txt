    "the divergence - free finite element method is mainly for solving incompressible flow problems , such as stokes or navier - stokes equations , where the finite element space for the pressure is exactly the divergence of the finite element space for the velocity .",
    "in such a method , the finite element velocity is divergence - free pointwise , i.e. the incompressibility condition is enforced strongly .",
    "traditional finite elements enforce the incompressibility weakly , cf . @xcite .",
    "that is , in order to satisfy the inf - sup stability condition , the incompressibility condition is weakened by either enlarging the velocity space or decreasing the pressure space .",
    "this often leads to some sub - optimal methods , or a waste of computation , due to the imperfect matching of two spaces .",
    "it may lead to inaccurate mass conservation , which is critical in certain computational problems .",
    "a fundamental study on the divergence - free element method was done by scott and vogelius ( @xcite ) that the @xmath7/@xmath8 method is stable and consequently of the optimal order on 2d triangular grids , for @xmath9 . here",
    "the velocity space is the continuous piecewise - polynomials of degree @xmath10 or less while the the pressure space is the discontinuous piecewise - polynomials of degree @xmath1 or less , or the divergence of the velocity , to be precise .",

    "similar to the bernardi - raugel element , a divergence - free finite element , /@xmath0",

    ", the discrete pressure space can be omitted in the computation . by an iterated penalty method",
    ", we obtain the pressure solution as a byproduct , cf .",
    "@xcite and section below .",
