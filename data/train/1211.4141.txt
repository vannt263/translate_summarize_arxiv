    "many electronic properties of condensed matter systems can be described by quantum heisenberg models .",
    "electrons are assumed to be localized but their spins interact with those of neighboring electrons .",
    "the study of quantum spin systems is notoriously difficult , and although several important results have been obtained , much remains to be understood . in this article",
    "we review probabilistic representations .",
    "probabilistic methods are not the most commonly employed in this subject , but they have proved useful nonetheless . a random walk representation has allowed conlon and solovej to obtain a lower bound on the free energy of the system.@xcite this result was then improved by tth with the help of the random loop representation described below.@xcite another loop representation , this time for the heisenberg antiferromagnet , was proposed by aizenman and nachtergaele@xcite .",
    "it allows to relate the 1d quantum model to 2d classical random cluster and potts models .",
    "recently , much progress has been achieved for another quantum model using similar probabilistic representations , the ising model in transverse fields.@xcite    random loop representations are also attractive _ per se_. they allow to formulate open questions in a probabilistic setting , so that a whole new group of mathematicians can reflect upon them .",
    "one should hope that probabilistic methods can shed a light on several properties of quantum spin systems .",
    "the situation now is rather the opposite : several results have been obtained for heisenberg models ( absence of spontaneous magnetization in one and two dimensions , and its occurrence in dimensions greater than two ) using a genial combination of algebra and analysis , with insights from mathematical - physics .",
    "they provide stunning results when translated in the language of random loops .",
    "the quantum heinseberg models and their probabilistic representations are introduced in section [ sec setting ] .",
    "we describe in section [ sec results ] the theorem of mermin and wagner about the absence of spontaneous magnetization / macroscopic loops in dimensions one and two , and the theorem of dyson , lieb , and simon about the occurrence of spontaneous magnetization in greater dimensions . sections",
    "[ sec setting ] and [ sec results ] are mathematically rigorous . in the last section [ sec heuristics ]",
    "we describe the heuristics about the joint distribution of the lengths of macroscopic loops and we show that these conjectures are compatible with other conjectures concerning the breaking of u(1 ) or so(3 ) symmetries . the claims of section [ sec heuristics ] are not proved .",
    "let @xmath1 be a finite graph ( simple , no loops ) , where @xmath2 denotes the set of vertices , and @xmath3 denotes the set of edges .",

    "the case @xmath15 gives the * heisenberg ferromagnet*. in order to understand the physical motivation of this model , consider the hilbert space for two spins at nearest - neighbors @xmath16 and @xmath17 , and the symmetry group of spin rotations .",

    "we want an interaction operator that is rotation invariant , so it must be of the form @xmath19 . up to constants and a shift by the identity operator ,",
    "we get @xmath20 , hence the two heisenberg models . * choosing @xmath21 , we get a model that is unitarily equivalent to the standard * heisenberg antiferromagnet * if the lattice is bipartite .",
    "the corresponding unitary operation consists of rotating all the spins of a sublattice by the angle @xmath22 around the second spin direction . *",
    "the case @xmath23 gives the * _ xy _ model*. the standard representation involves interactions between spins in the axis 1 and 2 , but the present choice is more suitable to the loop representation .",
    "it is well - known that the _ xy _ model is equivalent to the model of hard - core bosons , see e.g.  refs  .",

    "the conjecture also implies that @xmath97 converges in distribution to a random partition of @xmath106 $ ] .    in order to formulate a conjecture for the limiting distribution , we need to recall the definition of the poisson - dirichlet ( pd ) distribution",

    "the mechanism behind the poisson - dirichlet distributions of the lengths of macroscopic loops is indirect but very general .",

    "@xmath47 , and it proceeds as follows .",
    "* introduce a stochastic process such that the equilibrium measure @xmath117 is the invariant measure . *",

    "the invariant measure of the split - merge process is poisson - dirichlet @xcite .",
    "* a new edge - time @xmath118 appears at rate @xmath119 if its appearance causes a loop to split , and at rate @xmath120 if it causes two loops to merge . *",
    "an edge - time already present disappears at rate @xmath121 if its removal causes a loop to split , and at rate @xmath122 if it causes two loops to merge .    by considering all possible cases",
    ", we can check the * detailed balance condition * : @xmath123 and since the process is ergodic , the measure @xmath124 is the unique invariant measure ( up to a normalization ) .",
    "there is an important distinction between the case @xmath47 on the one hand , and the case @xmath116 on the other hand . in the first case , any local change results in a merge or in a split ( see ref .   for details ) .",
    "but in the case @xmath116 , where both crossings and bars are present , it is possible that local changes do not break the loop , but only modify its internal order ( think of @xmath125 ) the probability of splitting loops is then halved , and the effective split - merge process has stationary distribution pd(1 ) instead of pd(2 ) .",
    "models of spatial permutations are closely related .",
    "the occurrence of the poisson - dirichlet distribution can be proved in the `` annealed '' model where positions are averaged upon @xcite . the lattice model is harder to study rigorously , but the mechanisms described above have been verified numerically @xcite .",
    "heisenberg models have natural rotation symmetries , namely so(3 ) in the case @xmath114 and u(1 ) in the case @xmath116 .",
    "they are expected to be broken in @xmath87 and at temperatures low enough .",
    "these symmetries are not apparent in the loop representations .",
    "but we show here that there is a good reason why two different poisson - dirichlet distributions appear , pd(2 ) and pd(1 ) , in these different situations .",
    "we consider the two - point correlation function @xmath126 with @xmath127 far apart .",
    "if @xmath128 , we expect that @xmath129 where @xmath130 is the pure state obtained by adding the external magnetic field @xmath131 and by letting @xmath132 after taking the thermodynamic limit .",
    "using rotation invariance , it is enough to consider @xmath133 .",
    "then @xmath134 , and , as @xmath135 , @xmath136 , with @xmath137 the number appearing in conjecture [ conj one ] . then @xmath138 .",
    "let us now calculate these correlations in the random loop representation .",
    "for @xmath127 very far apart , the probability that they belong to the same loop is the same as the probability that two points in @xmath93 $ ] belong to the same element of the partition , multiplied by @xmath144 .",
    "this probability is easy to compute using the gem distribution .",
    "recall that if @xmath145 is a beta@xmath108 random variable , the expectation of @xmath146 is equal to @xmath147 , and the expectation of @xmath148 is equal to @xmath149 . using the definition for the gem random partition , and summing over the probabilities that the numbers both belong to the @xmath57th element , we find @xmath150 this gives @xmath151 this is indeed equal to @xmath152 , as found above .",
