    "ultra - cold trapped - atom experiments offer the unique possibility to understand many - body physics beyond what can be explored in typical condensed matter settings @xcite .",
    "essentially , they provide clean many - body systems in which attributes like density , dimensionality and interactions , may be controlled with commendable precision @xcite . as a result , from a theoretical perspective , there are broadly two kinds of challenges : ( 1 ) investigate configurations appropriate for emulating many - body theory models , thereby allowing for a systematic verification of claims made in the condensed matter context , and ( 2 ) investigate new configurations extremely difficult to realize in material settings .",
    "while the former program has proved quite successful with demonstrations of , for example , mott insulator to superfluid transition with ultra - cold @xmath0rb atoms in an optical lattice @xcite , the latter is just beginning to attract attention with several new experiments comprising degenerate mixtures of bosons and fermions , of same or different species being set up @xcite . a potentially rich scenario in this context",
    "is provided by an atomic mixture comprising superfluids of two kinds- bosonic and fermionic .",
    "studying this system may also have strong implications for , say nuclear physics , as a recent proposal investigates the intriguing possibility of simulating dense qcd matter with superfluid atomic mixtures @xcite .",
    "further , considering that in condensed matter setting , the analogous @xmath1he-@xmath2he superfluid mixture is difficult to realize @xcite , achieving bose - fermi superfluid mixtures with ultra - cold atoms maybe an important step towards understanding corresponding occurrences in a broader context .    in analyzing experiments with ultra - cold bose - fermi mixtures ,",
    "it is important to understand the effects of inhomogeneity due to traps . these effects are at the heart of determining the stability of possible thermodynamic phases in a given experiment . to this end",
    ", we construct the finite - temperature phase diagram of an interacting 3-dimensional ( 3-d ) mixture comprising of two fermions ( spin @xmath3 & @xmath4 ) of one species and a bosons of another .",
    "to draw such a phase diagram , it is important to understand the interplay between the following two phenomena : ( 1 ) phase transition that occurs near a critical temperature where suddenly an order parameter corresponding to one of the species nucleates .",
    "in fact , the critical temperature of such a transition may itself depend intricately on the state of the second species .",
    "moreover , the already nucleated phase may subsequently be drastically affected in a certain region of trap due to the nucleation of a new phase , corresponding to the second species , as the system is further cooled and crosses below a lower critical temperature .",
    "( 2 ) phase separation between possible phases , a phenomenon unique to trapped configurations .",
    "it also implies that the trap potential can simultaneously accommodate one or more of the phases as determined by the experimental parameters .",
    "thus , remarkably what phase / phases will be observed will critically depend on the trap geometry .",
    "this , in fact is a very important observation implying the possibility of tuning the trap parameters such that a desired density profile is observed only if a certain phase has nucleated . on top of all this , the dimensionality of the trapped system , whether we consider a 3-d or a 1-d trap , will also largely determine what phase is energetically favorable for phase separation .    while various possibilities discussed above exist and some insight may be borrowed from previous studies on pure bose and fermi superfluids , the intrinsically new nature of bose - fermi superfluid mixtures strongly motivates us to derive a framework within which an elaborate finite temperature phase diagram can be generated .",
    "also , such finite temperature studies comprising interacting fermions have never been performed in the past .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sectheory ] , we first review the theory for analyzing the thermodynamic instabilities of the bose - fermi mixture . while the technique is quite standard and maybe found elsewhere , to our knowledge",
    "this is the first instance where it has been applied for deriving the finite temperature phase diagram of the inhomogeneous mixture comprising of bosons and fermions , both in the superfluid phase .",
    "as discussed in the previous paragraphs , the trap introduces multiple scenarios that are new to these systems making the analysis complicated .",
    "therefore as a warmup , in sec .",
    "[ seczerot ] we illustrate our method by first considering the simplest case of the @xmath5 superfluid mixture in 3-d .",
    "the finite temperature phase diagram for the 3-d bose fermi mixture will be derived in sec .",
    "[ secfinitet ] . finally , in sec .",
    "[ seclda ] , we will discuss the implication of the phase diagram for a _ trapped _ bose - fermi mixture by introducing a spatially varying chemical potential in the spirit of a local density approximation ( lda ) , followed by brief discussion of the dependance on dimensionality in sec .",
    "[ sec1d ] .",
    "we begin by writing the hamiltonian for the interacting bose - fermi mixture in the form @xmath6 where the subscript @xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) stands for bosons ( fermions ) , @xmath9 s represent corresponding chemical potentials , @xmath10 s the corresponding number operators and @xmath11 denotes the interaction energy between bosons and fermions .",
    "our interest is in studying this interacting bose - fermi mixture in the vicinity of the superfluid critical temperature @xmath12 of the fermions .",
    "of course , it is true that the @xmath12 itself will be modified due to the presence of bose component .",
    "further , the phase of fermions may modify the critical temperature for the condensation of the bose component , @xmath13 .",
    "thus , while the general problem is indeed complicated , we focus our attention on the situation when @xmath13 is much greater than @xmath12 , typically the case in most trapped experiments @xcite .",
    "this allows us to work in the thomas - fermi limit of the bose component by neglecting its kinetic energy .",
    "we represent the contact interaction strength between a pair of bosons as @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the interaction energy of bosons , @xmath16 is the volume , @xmath17 is the @xmath18-wave boson - boson scattering length , assumed to be positive implying repulsive interactions , and @xmath19 is the mass of bosonic atom . for large boson number @xmath20 ,",
    "total pairs of bosons is approximately @xmath21 and hence , @xmath22 is simply a constant given by @xmath23 .",
    "thus , the contribution to the free energy density arising from just the bosonic component is @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the boson density .",
    "now , we focus on the @xmath26 part of the hamiltonian and write it explicitly in second quantized form as    @xmath27    here @xmath28 and @xmath29(@xmath30 ) is the creation ( annihilation ) operator for a fermion with momentum @xmath31 and spin @xmath32 .",
    "further , the boson - fermion interaction , which is typically short range , is described by a @xmath33-potential contact interaction with strength given by @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is the corresponding @xmath18-wave scattering length and @xmath36 is the reduced mass of the boson - fermion system . here",
    "we will confine our analysis to the repulsive regime with @xmath37 .",
    "similarly , we describe the fermion - fermion interaction by the contact interaction strength @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is the corresponding @xmath18-wave scattering length . here , since the interaction is @xmath18-wave , only unequal - spin fermions interact .",
    "also , we are interested in the superfluid regime , which occurs for attractive interactions , thus we assume @xmath40 .",
    "now , in the superfluid state with bcs - type pairing @xcite , the center - of - mass momentum , @xmath41 , of the cooper pair is set to zero allowing @xmath26 to be simply @xmath42 with @xmath43 .",
    "one can immediately notice that this is just the usual bcs hamiltonian with a modified chemical potential , hence can be diagonalized with the usual bogoliubov transformation @xcite .",
    "firstly , defining the mean - field order parameter @xmath44 and its complex conjugate @xmath45 , we write @xmath26 as    @xmath46    re - writing the above in terms of the _ nambu spinor _ @xmath47 and its hermitian conjugate @xmath48 , we have @xmath49 now the bogoliubov transformation immediately gives @xmath50 where the eigenenergies are @xmath51 and @xmath52 is assumed real @xcite .",
    "the operator @xmath53 ( @xmath54 ) creates ( annihilates ) bogoliubov quasiparticles that are distributed according to the fermi - dirac distribution @xmath55 with @xmath56 .",
    "thus the relevant thermodynamic potential is given by @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the entropy .",
    "the derivations and mean - field analysis presented henceforth is quantitatively exact only when the interactions are weak .",
    "our analysis is only qualitatively correct in the strong interaction limit , where a strong - coupling theory presented along the lines of ref .",
    "@xcite would be quantitatively more accurate .",
    "free energy density of the interacting mixture comprising of bosons and fermions , both in the superfluid state , can now be written from eqs .",
    "( [ freeb ] ) and ( [ freefbf ] ) : @xmath59 as one can immediately notice , @xmath8 depends on numerous parameters : interaction strengths @xmath60 ( in - turn , the scattering lengths @xmath61 ) , particle densities @xmath62 , chemical potentials @xmath63 , bcs superfluid order parameter @xmath52 and temperature @xmath64 .",
    "it is quite evident that the phase space of this interacting mixture is huge and thus an exhaustive study is impossible .",
    "however , noticing the fact that not all of these parameters are independent , we adopt the following scheme that was first introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite , allowing us to investigate the experimentally relevant region of the phase space : ( 1 ) fix parameters @xmath65 , @xmath66 and @xmath67 and perform our analysis at fixed values of @xmath64 @xcite ; ( 2 ) we project the multi - dimensional phase diagram in the @xmath68 phase space ; ( 3 ) the remaining dependent parameters @xmath69 , @xmath70 and @xmath71 are determined by the equilibrium stability conditions to be derived below .",
    "+   + _ ( 1 ) first derivative conditions : _ first of these is the gap equation obtained as the extremum of @xmath8 with respect to @xmath52 and provides the self - consistent value of the interaction strength parameter @xmath72 : @xmath73 however , in three dimensions , the momentum sum in the above expression diverges , an artifact of the contact interaction approximation .",
    "this unphysical effect is easily eliminated by an appropriate regularizing prescription .",
    "one of the easiest and convenient methods is to subtract the diverging piece : @xmath74 correspondingly , we upgrade the free energy @xmath8 to the regularized @xmath75 such that the extremum condition automatically reproduces the regularized version of the gap equation @xcite @xmath76 the above step is essential for our case since we will be eventually interested not only in the stability of the fermi system but that of the combined bose - fermi system . the presence of bosons affects the self - consistent value of @xmath71 , through the combination @xmath77 .",
    "next we consider the variation with respect to the fermion chemical potential @xmath67 .",
    "this produces the familiar equation determining the fermion number density @xmath70 : @xmath78 finally , the last of dependent parameters , the boson chemical potential @xmath69 is determined by minimizing @xmath75 with respect to the boson density .",
    "this leads to the modified thomas - fermi equation given by @xmath79 + _ ( 2 ) second derivative conditions : _ the second derivatives at the extremum points derived above provide the dynamical stability criterion for the mixture via positive definiteness of the hessian matrix @xmath80 .",
    "the relevant hessian matrix elements are :    @xmath81",
    "for illustrative purposes , we start with a brief discussion of the zero - temperature phase diagram . throughout",
    ", we follow the scheme outlined in sec .",
    "[ derivefree ] to construct all the phase diagrams .",
    "this is simply derived by taking the @xmath5 limit of eqs .",
    "( [ gap])-([hall ] ) . in the phase diagram shown in fig .",
    "[ pdt0 ] , the solid ( green ) curve represents the boundary of the dynamically stable region above it , separating the unstable region below .",
    "however , it is important to note that , in the phase diagram the interaction parameter @xmath71 is determined self - consistently from the gap equation .",
    "thus in any single experimental realization , only a small portion , corresponding to a fixed @xmath71 , of the above phase space is accessible . in our analysis",
    ", we choose a value of @xmath71 ( corresponding to @xmath82 ) such that pure fermions are in the bcs superfluid regime .",
    "this corresponds to a bcs superfluid critical temperature of @xmath83 , with @xmath84 being the fermi temperature @xcite .",
    "it is however important to note that @xmath85 , the bcs transition temperature of fermions in the presence of bosons , is modified by the presence of the factor @xmath77 in the effective fermion chemical potential .",
    "further , the dependence is such that @xmath86 and the equality is satisfied when @xmath87 0 .",
    "points in the phase space that correspond to this fixed value of @xmath71 is shown by the dashed ( blue ) contour @xmath88 in fig .",
    "the crossing of this contour with the dynamical stability contour indicates the phase space point at which the homogeneous mixture enters the dynamically stable region .",
    "however , for the homogeneous mixture to be the stable ground state , mechanical stability condition should also be satisfied on top of the dynamical stability condition .",
    "this additional criterion is exclusively present due to the spatial inhomogeneity intrinsic in trapped - atom setups . by mechanical stability ,",
    "we mean that the free energy of the homogeneous mixture should be less than the free energy of the pure bosonic phase or the pure fermionic phase along the contour @xmath88 .",
    "the value of the latter is a constant , since @xmath71 is fixed along @xmath88 .",
    "free energy of pure bosons along @xmath88 is given by @xmath89 = - \\frac{\\mu_b^2[c]}{2 \\ , \\lambda_b}\\ ] ] where , @xmath90 $ ] is the boson chemical potential along @xmath88 .    the plot of fig .",
    "[ freet0 ] shows the comparison of free energies mentioned above .",
    "the free energy of the pure fermionic phase and that of the homogeneous bose - fermi mixture along @xmath88 are represented by the solid and the dashed lines respectively .",
    "the free energy of pure bosons is much higher than the others and hence bosons do not phase separate out of the mixture .",
    "actually this observation is a general property of the phase space of a 3-dimensional bose - fermi mixture .",
    "the filled circle ( red ) represents the critical point along contour @xmath88 , at which the free energy of the homogeneous mixture is lower than that of pure fermions , i.e. , the critical point at which the homogeneous mixture enters a region of both dynamical and mechanical stability .",
    "this implies that , for the specific experimental realization considered here , up until this critical point pure fermions phase separate out of the mixture , while above the critical point the bose - fermi superfluid exists as a stable mixed phase .",
    "we begin the discussion of the finite temperature case by first emphasizing some of the generic aspects of such a phase diagram as depicted in the schematic of fig .",
    "[ cartoon ] .      .",
    "horizontal axis denotes the @xmath91 phase space of experimental parameters defined by @xmath92 . ]",
    "similar to the above illustration of the zero - temperature limit , we analyze the stability of the superfluid bose - fermi mixture in the vicinity of bcs critical temperature for a wide range of temperature and other parameter values . as mentioned earlier in sec .",
    "[ derivefree ] , the phase space is huge ( 5-dimensional ) allowing for complicated boundaries between stable ( @xmath93 ) and unstable ( @xmath94 ) regions of the homogeneous mixture . before proceeding to the detailed quantitative finite temperature phase diagram in fig .",
    "[ pd ] , we therefore summarize our findings by pointing out the broad features , as depicted in fig .",
    "[ cartoon ] . in a certain projected subspace ,",
    "the homogeneous bose - fermi mixture becomes dynamically and/or mechanically unstable towards phase separation through a first - order transition @xmath95 , when cooled across @xmath96 .",
    "the tunability of experimental parameters further allows us to access the @xmath97 transition at some fixed temperature below @xmath96 .",
    "we also observe the existence of a parameter regime where the homogeneous mixture remains unstable across @xmath96 going from @xmath98 .",
    "if fermions phase separate out of the unstable regions , then along the phase space boundary between @xmath99 and @xmath100 , and that between @xmath100 and @xmath101 , @xmath96 is essentially @xmath102 .",
    "thus , in short , the bose - fermi mixture exhibits rich mixing - demixing physics in the vicinity of the bcs critical temperature .",
    "particularly interesting is the parameter regime exhibiting the first - order transitions @xmath103 , which shows how the already condensed bosons affect the nucleation of fermions when cooled across the critical temperature , thereby clearly indicating direct implication for the observation of fermi superfluidity in trapped mixtures .",
    "we therefore address this part of the phase space in more detail .      .",
    "solid ( green ) curves show dynamical stability criteria and the ( blue ) surface represents points of fixed @xmath71 , such that @xmath12 = 0.11 @xmath84 @xcite .",
    "dashed ( blue ) curves @xmath104 are contours of fixed temperature @xmath105 along this surface and ( red ) circles indicate critical points at which the homogeneous mixture enters the region of both dynamical and mechanical stability . ]    for temperatures @xmath106 before the onset of bcs superfluidity , @xmath107 and hence we are confined to the @xmath108 axis .",
    "correspondingly , the free energy and the stability conditions of the homogeneous bose - fermi mixture are given by simply substituting @xmath109 in eqs .",
    "( [ gap])-([hall ] ) . for the parameter space under investigation",
    ", we find that the homogeneous mixture is always the stable ground state in this temperature regime . on the other hand , at temperatures @xmath110 , the onset of bcs superfluidity in fermions is characterized by a non - zero value of @xmath52 . in fig .",
    "[ pd ] , we plot the phase diagram for a wide range of temperatures below @xmath12 to observe that the mixture is dynamically stable only above the solid ( green ) curves at a given temperature",
    ". thus the presence of an all - stable homogeneous phase above @xmath96 and a mixture of unstable / stable phases below @xmath96 , as seen in fig .  [ pd ] , depicts the unambiguous manifestation of @xmath111 transitions .",
    "now we can immediately recognize the significance of this phase diagram for a realistic experimental situation .",
    "again , just like the @xmath5 case , only a small part of the stable phase space , corresponding to a fixed value of @xmath71 , is accessible in a particular experimental realization .",
    "this we indicate by the two - dimensional surface shown in fig .",
    "[ pd ] , for our chosen value of @xmath71 such that the fermions are in the bcs superfluid regime . the dashed lines @xmath104 s are contours connecting phase space points on this surface with fixed temperatures @xmath105 s .",
    "the crossing of contours @xmath104 s with dynamical stability contours indicates the phase space points at which the mixture enters the dynamically stable region .",
    "the filled circles represent critical points at which the homogeneous bose - fermi superfluid mixture becomes the stable ground state , i.e. , both dynamically and mechanically stable .",
    "we observe their occurrence to transpire in two different ways : ( 1 ) in @xmath112-@xmath113 , critical points occur in the dynamically stable region where the mixture also attains mechanical stability ( as illustrated in sec .  [ seczerot ] ) .",
    "( 2 ) along @xmath114 ( @xmath115 ) , the bcs transition temperature monotonously reduces with @xmath52 by such an extent that when @xmath116 , @xmath117 ( @xmath118 ) .",
    "however as discussed before , the mixture is always the stable ground state for @xmath119 .",
    "hence in @xmath114-@xmath115 , the critical points are given by their intersections with @xmath52=0 plane .",
    "thus along each @xmath104 , below these critical points the homogeneous mixture becomes dynamically and/or mechanically unstable .",
    "we further find that in the unstable regions , pure fermions phase separate from the mixture .",
    "thus in fig .",
    "[ pd ] we clearly demonstrate the occurrence of temperature - driven mixing - demixing transitions at fixed interaction strengths .",
    "0.13 , 0.072 , 0.055 @xmath84 respectively , with @xmath12=0.11 @xmath84 .",
    "@xmath69 is adjusted to ensure number conservation ( @xmath12042000 atoms ) .",
    "@xmath121 , @xmath122 are in @xmath9 m .",
    "color bar shows density variations in scale of @xmath123 ( 10@xmath124 ) .",
    "chosen trap parameters @xmath125 ( several mw ) , @xmath32=12@xmath9 m and @xmath126/@xmath127=0.08 . ]",
    "we now show the direct experimental implications of the above phase stability analysis .",
    "this , we do by reliably translating this analysis to the inhomogeneous case via local density approximation ( lda ) by defining a position dependent chemical potential @xmath128 , where @xmath129 is the local chemical potential and @xmath130 is the trap potential for bosons @xcite . while this approximation is known to be very efficient for large densities ( typically the case in trapped - atom experiments ) , it also implies that the trap potential can simultaneously accommodate one or more of the phases discussed above .",
    "thus , remarkably what phase / phases will be observed will critically depend on the trap geometry .",
    "this in fact , is a very important observation implying the possibility of tuning the trap parameters such that a desired density profile is observed only if a certain phase has nucleated .    to illustrate this program ,",
    "let us consider bosons to be in a tightly confined trap surrounded by the fermi gas in a larger trap , a scenario that takes advantage of our framework to consider a homogeneous fermi gas with fixed @xmath67 .",
    "additionally , this consideration is completely justified as the trapping potential for each species can be independently controlled @xcite .",
    "after careful analysis of the phase diagram in fig .",
    "[ pd ] , we find it advantageous to confine bosons in a trap with a finite barrier near the center . as this also helps to enhance the contrast in imaging the nucleated phases , we propose a double - well cigar shaped trap with a potential @xmath131 to confine bosons , where @xmath127 ( @xmath126 ) is the trap frequency in the transverse ( longitudinal ) direction to the gaussian beam creating the trapping potential . @xmath125 and @xmath32 , defining the barrier peak and beam - width respectively ,",
    "are chosen to ensure a readily detectable overlap of boson density profiles from the two wells for @xmath132 ( i.e. , @xmath133 ) , as shown in the top plot of fig .",
    "[ dp ] . at @xmath134 ( @xmath135 ) ,",
    "phase stability analysis along contour @xmath114 ( @xmath136 ) in fig .",
    "[ pd ] indicates the existence of a critical boson density ( and correspondingly a critical boson chemical potential @xmath137 ) , only above which the bose - fermi mixture homogeneously co - exists as the stable ground state .",
    "corresponding regions of the trap where this condition is not satisfied are devoid of bosons in a drastic fashion , as seen from the @xmath1204 @xmath9 m ( 8 @xmath9 m ) gap between the separated bosonic islands in fig .",
    "as these separation lengths are far greater than the healing length of the condensate , this illustration vividly shows how crucial aspects of the finite temperature phase diagram readily translate into detectable signatures in experiments .",
    "furthermore , this particular signature in fig .",
    "[ dp ] may be used as a signal indicating the onset of bcs superfluidity in the particular parameter regime of the attractive fermi gas .",
    "as a final piece , we analyze how the phase diagram gets modified when only the trap geometry of the experimental setup is deformed ( all other parameters kept constant ) such that the confinement in two orthogonal directions is made much tighter compared to that in the third . in effect , the system can be considered to be one - dimensional if the trapping frequency in the tight directions is such that @xmath138 . for simplicity , we restrict ourselves to the @xmath5 limit , where all the qualitative features can be comprehensively discussed @xcite . the effective 1-d interaction strength can be written in terms of the 1-d scattering length , which in turn can be easily related to the 3-d scattering length @xcite .",
    "this mapping is critically dependent on the aspect ratio of the trap .",
    "we choose experimentally relevant values for @xmath139 and @xmath140 @xcite .",
    "while we assume @xmath141 hz for both bosons and fermions , we find it useful to consider @xmath142 for fermions but smaller values of @xmath143 for bosons . apart from ensuring that we are indeed in the 1-d regime",
    ", this choice guarantees a highly elongated trapping potential for fermions . from the parameter values used in deriving the 3-d phase diagram of fig .",
    "[ pdt0 ] , we obtain the corresponding values for the 1-d scenario @xcite .",
    "we thus construct the phase diagram of the interacting one dimensional superfluid mixture , by performing the 1-d integrals instead of 3-d in eqs .",
    "( [ gap])-([hall ] ) . the phase diagram is shown in fig .  [ pdt01d ] , where the solid ( green ) curve represents the dynamical stability contour that separates the dynamically unstable region ( inside the ellipse ) from the dynamically stable region ( outside the ellipse ) .",
    "phase space points that correspond to the fixed value of @xmath144 , are shown by the dashed ( blue ) contour @xmath88 .",
    "the crossing of @xmath88 and the dynamical stability contours indicates the point at which the homogeneous mixture enters the dynamically unstable region .",
    "however , as discussed before in sec .",
    "[ seczerot ] , for the bose - fermi homogeneous mixture to be stable , it is necessary that the mechanical stability condition be simultaneously satisfied . for this",

    "[ freet01d ] , where the free energies of pure bosons , homogeneous mixture and pure fermions along @xmath88 are given by dotted , dashed and solid lines respectively .",
    "we immediately note that pure fermions can never phase separate out of the mixture , a remarkably different result when compared to the 3-d case [ see fig .",
    "[ freet0 ] ] .",
    "the filled circle ( red ) represents the critical point along contour @xmath88 , at which the free energy of the bosons becomes lower than that of the homogeneous mixture , i.e. , the critical point at which the homogeneous mixture becomes mechanically unstable .",
    "this means that up until this critical point , homogeneous superfluid mixture coexists as the stable ground state .",
    "however , above this critical point pure bosons phase separate out of the mixture .",
    "the significance of this critical point is clear since we can now directly obtain the boson density profile in the boson trap by mapping the boson chemical potential @xmath90 $ ] onto the spatial coordinate in the trap via lda using @xmath90 = \\mu_b(r )   = \\mu_b - v(r[c])$ ] , where @xmath145 is the probe trapping potential for the bosons .",
    "it is evident from figs .",
    "[ pdt01d ] and  [ freet01d ] that the pure bosons phase separate out of the homogeneous mixture in the trap above the critical value of boson chemical potential @xmath69 corresponding to the critical point ( filled red circle ) .",
    "in this article , we have discussed a consistent theoretical method for performing the finite temperature phase stability analysis of an ultra - cold mixture comprising of bosons and fermions , both in the superfluid regime . based on our stability analysis in the vicinity of the fermi superfluid temperature , we discussed two distinct scenarios where the homogeneous superfluid mixture becomes unstable ( 1 ) when the normal - superfluid phase transition ( second - order ) occurs in the fermionic component , and ( 2 ) below the fermi superfluid temperature via mechanical instability which is a first - order phase - separation phase transition .",
    "the latter scenario happens exclusively due to the trap inhomogeneity inherent in trapped - atom experiments , thereby allowing for the two phases to be simultaneously present .",
    "we have illustrated the emergence of these instabilities and the ensuing phase separation by considering a realistic experimental setting .",
    "we fine - tuned the trap geometry to enhance the effect of phase separation . finally , we briefly discussed the effect of dimensionality on the stability of various phases .",
    "we reiterate that while our phase diagram analysis is quantitatively exact when the interactions are weak , our study is only qualitatively correct in the strong interaction limit .",
    "we emphasize here that the interplay between the first and second order phase transitions , similar to that discussed in this paper , will have strong implications for analyzing experimental observations involving ultra - cold mixtures in general @xcite .",
    "while our framework is also valid to study the regime of strong interactions near a broad feshbach resonance , it can be easily extended within a two channel model for the case of a narrow feshbach resonance .",
    "further , while such a treatment will naturally allow for a molecular condensate of fermi atoms @xcite , it is not hard to speculate emergence of rich physics due to occurrence of efimov bound states in the bose - molecule interaction channel @xcite .",
    "finally , an important extension of the current work would be to consider spin - dependent bose - fermi interactions .",
    "the presence of a small bec can shift the chemical potential of a particular spin component relative to the other .",
