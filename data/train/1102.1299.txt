    "it is a known fact that every linear homogeneous system of first - order differential equations admits a _ linear superposition rule _ , namely , its general solution can be written in terms of a linear combination of a family of linearly independent particular solutions and a set of constants to be related to initial conditions .",
    "nevertheless , it is not so well - known that these systems can be viewed as a particular example of a larger class of first - order systems , the so - called _ lie systems _ , that admit a ` more general ' type of superposition rule which , for instance , need not be a linear combination of particular solutions @xcite . additionally , a more general type of superposition rule has been found for the denominated _ quasi - lie systems _",
    "@xcite , which include , as particular cases , lie systems .",
    "taking now into account that linear homogeneous systems of second - order differential equations also admit a certain type of linear superposition rule , it is natural to ask ourselves what kind of systems of second - order differential equations admit their general solution to be obtained , in a more general way , in terms of certain families of particular solutions and sets of constants .",
    "as witnessed by some previous works @xcite , the analysis of this question may lead to finding new insights and results in the study of many problems of mathematical and physical interest .",
    "motivated by the above facts , the main aim of this work is to present some results concerning the study of superposition rules for second - order differential equations .",
    "more specifically , we next provide several definitions of these new types of superposition rules along with some results describing special kinds of second - order differential equations admitting them .",
    "as a direct consequence of our results , it turns out that the theories of lie and quasi - lie systems can be applied to analyse second - order differential equations .",
    "finally , we carry out various applications of our results to the analysis of a number of second - order differential equations appearing in the physics and mathematical literature , paying special attention to second - order riccati equations .",
    "let us here briefly recall some fundamental notions to be used throughout this work . for a detailed description of these and other related topics , see @xcite .",
    "a _ superposition rule _ for a system of differential equations @xmath0 defined on @xmath1 is a map @xmath2 such that the general solution , @xmath3 , of the system can be written , at least locally , as @xmath4 in terms of any ` generic ' set of particular solutions @xmath5 and a set of constants @xmath6 to be related to the initial conditions of the system .",
    "the characterization of those systems of the form ( [ sys ] ) admitting a superposition rule is due to the norwegian mathematician sophus lie . in modern geometric terms , lie s characterization ( the today called _ lie theorem _ ) states that a system of the form ( [ sys ] ) admits a superposition rule , i.e. it is a _ lie system _ , if and only if its associated @xmath7-dependent vector field , i.e. @xmath8 , can be cast into the form @xmath9 where @xmath10 are a set of vector fields on @xmath1 spanning a finite - dimensional lie algebra of vector fields , the so - called _ vessiot - guldberg lie algebra_.    in a more general picture , the @xmath7-dependent vector field associated with a system of the form ( [ sys ] ) might be cast into the form @xmath11 where the vector fields @xmath12 do not need to close a lie algebra , but they must span a finite - dimensional vector space @xmath13 admitting a subspace @xmath14 such that @xmath15\\subset w$ ] and @xmath16\\subset v_2 $ ] . in such a case , the pair @xmath17 is said to form a _ quasi - lie scheme @xmath18 _ and there exists a group of @xmath7-dependent transformations , the so - called _ group of the scheme _ ,",
    "@xmath19 , whose elements transform our initial system ( [ sys ] ) into new ones related to @xmath7-dependent vector fields of the form @xmath20 , see @xcite . moreover , if for a certain @xmath7-dependent transformation of @xmath19 , the @xmath7-dependent vector field @xmath21 can be cast into a form similar to ( [ decliesys ] ) , the initial system is said to be a _ quasi - lie system with respect to the scheme @xmath18_. in this case",
    ", it can be proved that the general solution of the initial system can be written as @xmath22 in terms of any ` generic ' set of particular solutions @xmath5 and a set of constants @xmath6 . in other words ,",
    "system ( [ sys ] ) is said to admit a _",
    "@xmath7-dependent superposition rule _ @xmath23 .",
    "motivated by the recent works studying second - order differential equations from the point of view of the theory of lie systems @xcite , it turns out that the appropriate definition of superposition rule for second - order differential equations must be as follows .    given a system of second - order differential equations @xmath24 on @xmath1 , we say that it admits a _ superposition rule _ if there exists a mapping @xmath25 such that the general solution , @xmath3 , of the system can be written , at least locally , as @xmath26 in terms of any ` generic ' set of particular solutions @xmath5 , their derivatives with respect to the independent variable @xmath7 , and a set of constants @xmath27 to be related to the initial conditions .",
    "a useful concept in order to recognize second - order differential equations admitting a superposition rule is the sode lie system notion .",
    "let us define this concept .",
    "given a second - order differential equation ( [ secor ] ) , we say that it is a _",
    "sode lie system _ if its associated first - order system @xmath28 is a lie system .",
    "the interest on the sode lie system concept is motivated by the following result , whose demonstration follows straightforwardly from ( * ? ? ?",
    "* proposition 1 ) .    * proposition 1 . * _ every sode lie system of the form ( [ secor ] ) admits a superposition rule @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is a superposition rule for ( [ asofir ] ) and @xmath31 is the projection map related to the tangent bundle @xmath32 . _",
    "recently , the theory of quasi - lie schemes @xcite introduced a new type of superposition rule for systems of first - order differential equations that we next define .",
    "a system ( [ secor ] ) is said to admit a _",
    "@xmath7-dependent superposition rule _ if there exists a map @xmath33 such that its general solution can be cast into the form @xmath34 in terms of any ` generic ' set of particular solutions @xmath5 , their derivatives with respect to the independent variable @xmath7 , and a set of constants @xmath27 to be related to the initial conditions .    in a similar way",
    "as proposition 1 shows the existence of superposition rules for sode lie systems , it can be proved the following result that ensures the existence of @xmath7-dependent superposition rules for a more general class of systems of second - order differential equations .",
    "* proposition 2 . *",
    "_ every second - order system ( [ secor ] ) , whose associated first - order system ( [ asofir ] ) is a quasi - lie system with respect to some quasi - lie scheme , admits a @xmath7-dependent superposition rule of the form @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is a @xmath7-dependent superposition rule associated with the quasi - lie system ( [ asofir ] ) . _",
    "let us briefly explain the application of the previous theoretical results to the analysis of some second - order differential equations appearing in the mathematical and physics literature @xcite .",
    "our first aim is concerned with analysing the second - order differential equation @xmath37 related to the study of bcklund transformations for the sawada - kotera pde and appearing in the study of the so - called riccati chains @xcite .",
    "more specifically , we pretend to prove that equation ( [ pi ] ) is a sode lie system and to describe one of its associated superposition rules by means of proposition 1 . in order to do so , note that equation ( [ pi ] ) is such that its associated first - order system ( [ asofir ] ) describes the integral curves of the @xmath7-dependent vector field @xmath38 , where @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "it can be proved that the vector fields @xmath41 and @xmath42 span , along with the vector fields @xmath43 an eight - dimensional lie algebra of vector fields @xmath44 isomorphic to @xmath45 , see @xcite .",
    "it follows that equation ( [ pi ] ) is a sode lie system and , in virtue of proposition 1 , it admits a superposition rule . following a method to obtain superposition rules described in @xcite",
    ", it can be proved that the general solution for system ( [ pi ] ) can be written as @xmath46 where @xmath47 and @xmath48 , with @xmath49 , are certain functions depending only on the particular solutions @xmath50 and their derivatives , and @xmath51 are real constants . for a detailed description of this result ,",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite .    apart from system ( [ pi ] ) , many other second - order differential equations are sode lie systems that , when transformed into first - order ones , are related to lie systems whose associated @xmath7-dependent vector fields are described by linear combinations of the form ( [ decliesys ] ) of vector fields in @xmath44 . among these sode lie systems",
    ", we can single out the equations @xmath52 appearing , for instance , in the study of differential equations with maximal number of lie symmetries . as a consequence of proposition 1",
    ", all the members of this family admit the same superposition rule as equation ( [ pi ] ) and therefore their general solutions can also be cast into the form ( [ supfirstricc ] ) .",
    "let us sketch now how proposition 2 can be used to derive a @xmath7-dependent superposition rule for the second - order riccati equations @xcite of the form @xmath53 with @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 , and @xmath57 .",
    "for a full description of the following techniques , see @xcite .    in order to apply proposition 2 to equation ( [ nle ] ) , it is necessary to prove that the system @xmath58 obtained by adding the variable @xmath59 to the equation ( [ nle ] ) , is a quasi - lie system . consider the following set of vector fields @xmath60spanning a linear space of vector fields @xmath61 and define @xmath62 .",
    "the linear space @xmath14 is a two - dimensional abelian lie algebra of vector fields and it can be proved that @xmath16\\subset v_2 $ ] . hence , the pair @xmath17 forms a quasi - lie scheme @xmath18 . note that system ( [ fosor ] ) describes the integral curves of the @xmath7-dependent vector field @xmath63 of the form ( [ decqualiesys ] ) in terms of the vector fields of @xmath13 .",
    "consequently , the so - called group of the scheme @xmath19 associated with @xmath18 can be used to transform the system determined by @xmath64 into a new system determined by a @xmath7-dependent vector field taking values in @xmath13 , see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* proposition 1 ) .",
    "in particular , among the elements of @xmath19 , it is easy to find that the @xmath7-dependent change of variables @xmath65 @xmath66 , converts system ( [ fosor ] ) into the lie system describing the integral curves of the @xmath7-dependent vector field @xmath67 in consequence system ( [ fosor ] ) is a quasi - lie system with respect to the scheme @xmath18 and proposition 2 ensures the existence of a @xmath7-dependent superposition rule for every member of the family ( [ nle ] ) .",
    "more specifically , the superposition rule for system @xmath68 gives rise to a @xmath7-dependent superposition rule for the system associated with @xmath64 , by inverting the previous @xmath7-dependent change of variables ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 4 ) . from this superposition rule",
    ", it follows straightforwardly ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) that the general solution for every member of the family ( [ nle ] ) can be cast into the form @xmath69 where @xmath70 and @xmath71 , with @xmath49 , are certain @xmath7-dependent functions depending on any generic family of particular solutions @xmath50 and their derivatives , and @xmath72 are two real constants .",
    "several types of superposition rules for systems of second - order differential equations have been introduced , and some classes of these systems have been proved to admit these new superposition rules . as an application ,",
    "we have derived @xmath7-dependent and @xmath7-independent superposition rules for various second - order differential equations appearing in the physics and mathematical literature .",
    "the definitions and methods showed here seem to be generalizable to the setting of higher - order systems of differential equations , where they could provide , for instance , a method to study the differential equations of the so - called _ riccati hierarchy _ appearing in the study of bcklund transformations of several pdes @xcite .",
