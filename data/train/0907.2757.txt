    "neutron star low - mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) consist of a neutron star that accretes matter from a low - mass companion star . from binary evolution models , we know that the neutron star could accrete up to 0.7m@xmath5 from the companion ( e.g.  @xcite ) . in that case , neutron stars as massive as @xmath8m@xmath5 may be expected in lmxbs . such a high - mass neutron star would pose strong constraints on the equation of state ( eos ) of matter at the pressures and densities encountered in neutron star cores ( see @xcite and references therein ) . determining the neutron star eos is one of the ultimate goals of the study of neutron stars .    in order to determine the neutron star mass in these effectively single - line spectroscopic binaries , we need to know the inclination , the projected rotational velocity @xmath9 of the companion star and the semi - amplitude @xmath10 of its radial velocity curve . in principle , these last two parameters can be determined via optical spectroscopy .",
    "unfortunately , the companion stars of lmxbs are nearly always intrinsically faint and they are typically located at distances of several kilo - parsecs .",
    "furthermore , in systems accreting at high accretion rates the accretion disc out - shines the small companion stars making it impossible to detect the stellar absorption lines necessary to determine @xmath10 and @xmath9 . in lmxbs the binary inclination can be determined accurately if the system is eclipsing @xcite .",
    "hence , in order to provide the strongest , model independent constraints on the neutron star mass we need to target quiescent , eclipsing lmxbs .",
    "exo0748@xmath0676 is such an eclipsing lmxb .",
    "it was discovered using observations of the _",
    "european x - ray observatory satellite _ ( exosat ) in 1985 @xcite .",
    "the presence of x - ray eclipses and typei x - ray bursts marking the compact object as a neutron star , were readily found @xcite . in hindsight",
    "the source had been observed serendipitously by the _ einstein _",
    "satellite as well as during exosat slews ( @xcite and @xcite , respectively ) .",
    "the optical counterpart to the x - ray source has been found by @xcite .",
    "@xcite report on the discovery of the optical counterpart as well as on searches of archival optical plates showing that the optical source was not present down to roughly 23rd magnitude in the src j plate when the x - ray source was inactive .",
    "@xcite reported on a measurement of the gravitational redshift from x - ray absorption line spectroscopy during type  i x - ray bursts providing @xmath11 ; this is , so far , unique to this source .",
    "however , these features were not detected in subsequent observations and thus require further confirmation ( see @xcite ) .",
    "recently , @xcite announced the discovery of nearly periodic oscillations during two type i x - ray bursts in exo 0748 - 676 at a frequency of 552hz .",
    "this is at odds with the 45hz burst oscillations reported by @xcite . if 552hz is indeed the neutron star spin frequency the redshift measurement is challenged further since rotational doppler broadening tends to lower the contrast unless the orientation of the neutron star is favorable , with the spin axis pointing in our direction . using a combination of observations , including the contested redshift measurement , and theoretical findings",
    "@xcite argues that the mass in exo0748@xmath0676 is @xmath12m@xmath5 , which if confirmed would rule out many soft equations of state .",
    "however , a high spin frequency , such as 552hz , besides challenging the redshift measurement , also introduces sizeable relativistic corrections to the equations and thus result of @xcite .",
    "attempts to use narrow he , c and n emission lines that are probably originating on the heated inner hemisphere of the companion star to get a lower limit on the mass of the neutron star are presented in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the x - ray eclipse duration for exo0748@xmath0676 in outburst has been measured from x - ray studies using the exosat and xmm-_newton _ satellite ( 8.3 minutes , @xcite and @xcite , respectively ) .",
    "recently , the system returned to quiescence after a more than 20 year - long active phase ( see wolff et al.2008ab , @xcite ) . analysing the optical @xmath13-band and near - infrared @xmath14-band light curves ,",
    "@xcite find that the residual x - ray luminosity of the cooling hot neutron star ( see @xcite ) is causing the inner hemisphere of the companion star to be heated .",
    "we here present phase - resolved optical spectroscopy and x - ray observations of the source shortly after the end of the outburst .",
    "we have observed exo0748@xmath0676 on nov .  6 , 2008 at 08:53:10 ( utc ) with the european photon imaging camera ( epic ) on board the xmm-_newton _ satellite .",
    "these data were acquired 62 days after the first x - ray observations of exo0748@xmath0676 by @xcite .",
    "hence , the source was in quiescence . the observation time was awarded to our directors discretionary time proposal .",
    "the observation identification number is 0560180701 .",
    "two of the three imaging cameras on board xmm-_newton _ use metal oxide semi - conductor ( mos ) ccd arrays whereas one uses a pn ccd array . since the mos cameras receive less than 50 per cent of the light due to the presence of the reflection grating spectrometers in the light path we present results of the pn camera only .",
    "the pn camera was employed in _",
    "primefullwindow _ mode and a medium filter was put in place to avoid strong contamination due to bright optical sources in the field of view .    to benefit from the latest calibrations available in december 2008 we have reprocessed and analysed the data using the _ sas _ software version 8.0.0 .",
    "data are excluded if the 10 - 12kev background count rate for single events in a @xmath15 ccd - pixel region ( with pattern 0.0 ) is higher than 1.0counts@xmath3 .",

    "a total of 31 spectra were obtained , all with 870s exposure times and using the 1200r grism , covering the wavelength range between 5750  and 7310 , and a @xmath19 slit .",
    "the detectors were read out with @xmath20 binning , providing a resolution of 2.1  sampled at a dispersion of 0.76pix@xmath3 .",
    "all spectra were obtained during times of good to excellent seeing ( @xmath21 to @xmath22 ) .",
    "the images were corrected for bias and flat - fielded using lamp flats . for the sky subtraction we used clean regions on the slit , fitting it with a polynomial of up to 2nd order if that provided the best fit .",
    "the spectra were optimally extracted following the algorithm of @xcite and wavelength calibrated using arc lamp exposures taken during daytime .",
    "finally , an approximate flux calibration , not correcting for slit losses , was determined from a 22s exposure of the spectrophotometric standard ltt3218 taken on the first night with a @xmath23 slit .",
    "we furthermore analysed 15 @xmath13-band acquisition images of 30 or 40s exposure times taken prior to the spectral observations .",
    "these images were corrected for bias and flat - fielded using sky flats .",
    "instrumental magnitudes of stars on each image were determined through point - spread - function fitting using daophotii @xcite .",
    "all magnitudes were calibrated against the instrumental magnitudes of stars on the first image by using some 350 to 400 comparison stars to fit for an offset in instrumental magnitude .    for the photometric calibration of the first image , we used aperture photometry of a few bright stars to determine the aperture correction and determined the photometric calibration from 19 photometric standards from the pg2213@xmath0006 field @xcite .",
    "we used the standard fors2 @xmath13-band extinction coefficient of 0.08mag per airmass to correct for the difference in airmass between the field of exo0748@xmath0676 and the pg2213@xmath0006 standard field .",
    "because no color coefficients could be determined , we estimate the uncertainty in the photometry as the rms in the zeropoint , which is about 0.1mag .",
    "during the x - ray observations of exo0748@xmath0676 the source shows a constant count rate of @xmath24countss@xmath3 except for the two distinct eclipses .",
    "fig.[fig : var]a shows the x - ray light - curve of the total detected counts ( including background ) .",
    "the background flux was consistent with being constant at 0.015countss@xmath3 .",
    "for the present work we are mainly interested in the eclipse duration and the orbital period and mid eclipse times .",
    "the spectral properties of the source will be presented elsewhere .",
    "we fit the light curve by a constant plus four step functions located at @xmath25 and @xmath26 for the first eclipse and @xmath27 and @xmath28 for the second eclipse . here",
    "@xmath29 is the mid eclipse time of the first eclipse , @xmath30 is the orbital period and @xmath31 is the eclipse duration .",
    "the step functions are approximated by heaviside functions , defined as @xmath32 , where @xmath33hour@xmath3 is used to describe the eclipse ingress and @xmath34hour@xmath3 describing the eclipse egress . with these values for @xmath35 , 50percent of the flux at the ingress and egress times",
    "is contained in a single 10s bin .",
    "fitting for @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 and a constant to describe the flux out of the eclipse , we obtain @xmath36 mjd / tdb , @xmath37h and @xmath38s .    we have compared @xmath29 and @xmath30 with the values predicted by the orbital ephemerids of exo0748@xmath0676 obtained from rxte x - ray timing by @xcite . extrapolating their ephemerids to orbit @xmath39 gives consistent results for the orbital period at the @xmath40 level , while the mid eclipse time falls between the predictions of the constant - period ephemeris and the quadratic ephemeris using all data . at @xmath41 ,",
    "the prediction from the constant - period ephemeris lies closest to our measurement . because the ephemeris of @xcite uses a considerably larger dataset ,",
    "their results are expected to represent the long term timing better , and hence , for the remainder of the paper we will use the mid eclipse time @xmath29 and orbital period @xmath30 given by the constant - period ephemeris of @xcite .",
    "we selected in total 800s worth of data centered on the mid - eclipse times for both eclipses in our dataset . even during the x - ray",
    "eclipses , exo0748@xmath0676 is still detectable , providing 29 source counts ( 38 total counts from which 9 are expected due to the background ) in the 800s of observation that we used .",
    "this constitutes approximately 6.6percent of the out of eclipse @xmath42kev count rate .",
    "the individual extracted optical spectra are generally featureless except for the region around h@xmath1 where all spectra have a broad emission component ( fwhm of about 26 ) , while a strong narrow emission line ( 5  fwhm ) is present in spectra taken between orbital phases of approximately @xmath17 . here",
    "@xmath43 is defined as the center of the x - ray eclipse .",
    "fig.[fig : doptom ] shows a trailed spectrum of the h@xmath1 region , folded on the ephemeris of @xcite , where the emission clearly follows the orbital signature of a circular orbit .",
    "the emission appears strongest between the quadratures and weakest at the time of the x - ray eclipse .    to measure radial velocities of the h@xmath1 components we fit the spectral range between 6400  and 6700  of each spectrum with either a single gaussian for spectra taken between @xmath44 and @xmath45 and two gaussians for spectra taken between @xmath17 .",
    "three parameters , position , width and height , were fitted for each gaussian .",
    "fitting a circular orbit with @xmath46 to the radial velocities of the narrow emission component returns @xmath47kms@xmath3 and @xmath48kms@xmath3 with a reduced @xmath49 for 22 degrees of freedom ( see fig.[fig : var]e ) .",
    "the errors on the values given above are the formal @xmath50 uncertainties and are scaled to give @xmath51 . because these radial velocities are determined from emission lines the measured radial velocity semi - amplitude @xmath52 may or may not be equal to the true radial velocity semi - amplitude of the companion @xmath10 , see  [ s : discon ] .         for this fit , the orbital period @xmath30 and mid eclipse time @xmath29",
    "were set to those of the ephemeris of @xcite .",
    "leaving these parameters free in the fit gives values that are fully consistent with their constant - period ephemeris extrapolated to @xmath53 .",
    "the difference in @xmath29 is only @xmath54min ( @xmath55 in phase ) , while the difference in @xmath30 is @xmath56s .",
    "an average of the 31 individual spectra is shown in fig.[fig : spec ] , where the individual spectra are shifted to zero radial velocity using the h@xmath1 radial velocity curve .",
    "this spectrum shows , besides the narrow and broad h@xmath1 components , weak emission lines of hei @xmath57 , @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
    "some telluric absorption features are present at @xmath60 .",
    "zero velocity averages of individual spectra with orbital phases between @xmath61 and between @xmath62 and @xmath63 are also shown in fig.[fig : spec ] . here",
    ", the first spectrum predominantly shows the hemisphere of the companion facing the neutron star , while the latter spectrum shows the opposite hemisphere .",
    "the spectra are significantly different , with the h@xmath1 and hei emission lines being strongest on the hemisphere facing the neutron star .",
    "furthermore , that hemisphere appears brighter by about a factor 2 .",
    "though no absorption features appear to be present that may be attributable to the binary companion , we have compared the averaged spectrum against synthetic stellar spectra by @xcite . in the wavelength range covered by our observations ,",
    "the strongest absorption features are the tio bands around 6180  and 7050  for temperatures below about @xmath64k , while the naid lines are present for temperatures between 4000k to 7500k , decreasing in strength with increasing temperature .",
    "between 4000k to 5000k many metallic lines are present in the range between 6000  to 6400 . above about 5000k",
    "h@xmath1 becomes increasingly stronger .",
    "unfortunately the region around the naid lines overlaps with the hei @xmath57 emission line while the h@xmath1 emission likely swamps the absorption component . as such",
    ", both regions can not be used .",
    "instead , we use the region between 6000  and 6250 , computing a @xmath65 statistic by fitting the ratio in flux between the template and the zero velocity averaged spectrum with a second order polynomial .",
    "we find that the best fit solution sets a @xmath66 limit on the temperature of @xmath67k , regardless of the surface gravity .",
    "this temperature is the temperature above which the tio bands , disappear .",
    "the fit has @xmath68 for some 4900 degrees of freedom .",
    "the absence of absorption lines in the observed and synthetic spectra essentially prevent us from obtaining a better constraint on the temperature of the companion , and measuring its radial velocity curve using photospheric absorption lines .",
    "the spectroscopic as well as the photometric observations show that the optical flux varies in both the continuum and emission lines .",
    "fig.[fig : var]b shows the @xmath13-band magnitudes determined from the acquisition images and they confirm the light curve published by @xcite ; a single peaked modulation with the minimum at the time of the x - ray eclipse .",
    "this trend is also present in both the equivalent width of h@xmath1 ( fig.[fig : var]c ) and the continuum emission ( fig.[fig : var]d ) .",
    "the narrow h@xmath1 emission seems to disappear completely near the phase of the x - ray eclipse at @xmath43 , while the broadband flux varies by a factor of about 2 .      in order to prepare the spectra for emission line tomography , we first continuum normalised each spectrum using a spline - fit and re - binned the data to a constant velocity scale sampling of 33.8kms@xmath3pix@xmath3 .",
    "the spectra were then phase - binned using the @xcite ephemeris . the prominent orbital variation in the h@xmath1 component led us to employ the modulation doppler tomography method described in @xcite .",
    "this technique includes variable contributions modulated on the orbital period and was used to construct emission line tomograms resolving the h@xmath1 and hei @xmath58 emission distributions .",
    "we used a systemic velocity of 78kms@xmath3 as derived in ",
    "[ ss : radvel ] , although the reconstructions are robust against the exact choice of @xmath69 .",
    "the advantages of doppler tomography are its ability to map complex line profiles using the whole data set at once .",
    "contributions from specific sources in the binary can then be identified by their known position on the tomogram .",
    "reconstructions achieved good fits to the observed line profiles , achieving formal @xmath70 for both h@xmath1 and hei @xmath58 .",
    "we show the reconstructions for these lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : doptom ] .",
    "the bulk of the emission originated from a region consistent with the location of the mass donor star , although a weak underlying signature from an accretion disc can also be seen .",
    "these are responsible for the broad base ( disc ) and narrow ( donor ) moving line components previously mentioned .",
    "since we are mainly concerned with the contribution from the donor , we restrict the plotted velocity intervals to the region surrounding the expected location of the donor .    in h@xmath1 ,",
    "the donor star component is reconstructed as an extended feature centred on the y - axis , covering velocities between 200 and 410kms@xmath3 .",
    "this emission is furthermore significantly modulated with an amplitude of 30percent , peaking near orbital phase @xmath71 .",
    "both the distribution as well as the modulation of this emission is exactly what would be expected for line emission from an irradiated donor star .",
    "however , the emission does not appear to be uniformly distributed across the roche lobe .",
    "we measured the centroid position of the pronounced peak in our doppler tomograms using several methods and found consistent velocity measurements to within a few kms@xmath3 .",
    "for example , a gaussian fit to the h@xmath1 map delivers a peak of @xmath72kms@xmath3 while the highest pixel is at 410kms@xmath3 .",
    "we also reconstructed doppler maps using different values for the systemic velocity to see by how much the measured peak position would be affected . varying the systematic velocity @xmath69 by as much as 15kms@xmath3 shifts the peak velocity down by up to 5kms@xmath3 .",
    "the donor star component is broadened and weaker for reconstructions with @xmath69 significantly above or below our assumed value of 78kms@xmath3 .",
    "this is further confirmation that this is close to the true value for the systemic velocity and that its impact on the measured @xmath52 is small .",
    "given that formal error propagation is not possible in maximum - entropy regularised inversions such as our doppler maps , we conservatively assign an uncertainty of 5kms@xmath3 to our measured velocities .",
    "this uncertainty encompasses the observed scatter in derived @xmath52 when comparing different centroid methods as well as the systematic contribution due to a possible uncertainty in @xmath69 ( as evaluated above ) .    for h@xmath1 ,",
    "our measured @xmath73kms@xmath3 is significantly larger than the @xmath52 values determined in  [ ss : radvel ] via our radial velocity curve fits . for comparison",
    ", hei @xmath58 shows a more spot - like distribution , again centred closely to the y - axis and peaking at @xmath74kms@xmath3 .",
    "we do not have sufficient signal - to - noise in this much weaker line to constrain its variability amplitude to a significant degree .",
    "we thus find that the peak of the h@xmath1 emission is found further back on the roche lobe compared to the hei emission . for illustration , we plot the expected shape of the donor star roche lobe in fig .",
    "[ fig : doptom ] using a mass ratio of @xmath75 and @xmath76kms@xmath3 .",
    "the various estimates for @xmath52 will be compared and discussed in the next section .",
    "we have obtained x - ray timing and phase - resolved optical spectra of the eclipsing low - mass x - ray binary exo0748@xmath0676 shortly after the source transitioned into quiescence after several decades of outburst activity .",
    "timing of the x - ray eclipses show that the orbital period and eclipse duration are consistent with the values when the source was in outburst .",
    "in addition , the orbital phase is consistent with extrapolating the constant period ephemeris of @xcite .",
    "the x - ray eclipses in exo0748@xmath0676 are near total , however , about 6 to 7 per cent of light remains during the eclipses .",
    "@xcite find that in outburst part of this residual flux can be attributed to fluorescent thermal halo emission .",
    "@xcite find that in outburst about 4percent of the @xmath77kev continuum emission is detected during eclipse .",
    "they attribute this to light scattered into our line of sight by a corona . given that they find that the fraction of light during the eclipse is larger for lower energies , our value seems consistent with that found in outburst .",
    "this implies that the structure responsible for the scattering is still present , or still replenished even when the source is in quiescence .",
    "using our medium resolution vlt / fors2 spectra of exo0748@xmath0676 we find emission lines of h@xmath1 and hei .",
    "they display the orbital motion expected if the lines originate on the binary companion .",
    "the optical spectra show considerable flux variations in both the continuum and the emission lines .",
    "the variations display a single peak over the orbital period and we attribute this to irradiation of the hemisphere of the companion facing the neutron star . @xcite also presented evidence for an irradiated donor star on the basis of their optical and near - infrared photometric observations .",
    "this irradiation causes three effects that will skew the measurement of the radial velocity semi - amplitude .",
    "first , due to the irradiation the centre of light is offset from the centre of mass of the companion .",
    "the former being on the hemisphere facing the neutron star , the measured radial velocity semi - amplitudes are smaller than the actual orbital velocity of the companion . to correct for",
    "this difference one can apply a so called @xmath78-correction @xcite .",
    "this @xmath78-correction can be estimated assuming values for the mass - ratio @xmath79 and the opening angle of the accretion disk .",
    "the latter is needed to correct for the partial shielding of the binary companion by the accretion disc from the irradiating flux ( cf .",
    "second , the irradiation may induce gas motion on the surface of the mass donor star , resulting in apparent shifts in orbital phase of the radial velocity curve ( @xcite ; cf .",
    "third , due to the difference in flux observed from the irradiated and non - irradiated hemispheres of the companion the rotational broadening profiles are not symmetric .",
    "as a result observed line profiles can become dependent on orbital phase and inclination ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "this effect is obvious when considering the extreme case where all the flux originates from the irradiated hemisphere .",
    "assuming synchronous rotation , at phase @xmath80 the companion is moving away from the observer at its maximal observed orbital velocity , however , the observed irradiated hemisphere is rotating towards the observer lowering the observed semi - amplitude of the radial velocity curve .",
    "how much the measurement of the radial velocity semi - amplitude is influenced depends therefore on whether the semi - amplitude is determined by fitting gaussians to the emission line profiles or by fitting a two dimensional gaussian to the spot in a doppler tomogram .",
    "we modelled the changes in the line velocities by fitting a double gaussian , one narrow , one significantly broader , to the h@xmath1 emission profiles .",
    "we find that the velocities of the narrow component can be well described by fitting a sinusoid with a constant .",
    "the semi - amplitude is @xmath81kms@xmath3 and the constant representing the systemic velocity @xmath82kms@xmath3 when restricting the fit to the velocities over the orbital phases @xmath61 when the narrow component of the emission line is strongest .    using doppler tomography of the h@xmath1 emission line with @xmath83kms@xmath3 as input",
    "we find that the centre of the h@xmath1 emission spot in the doppler map falls at @xmath73kms@xmath3 .",
    "this value for the radial velocity semi - amplitude measured from doppler tomography is significantly larger than that obtained fitting a double gaussian to the emission peak .",
    "the reason for this difference lies in the fact that the doppler tomography method does not require symmetric line profiles whereas fitting gaussians obviously does .",
    "the doppler maps do show that h@xmath1 emission is complex in shape and thus that the single gaussian model for the narrow component is likely too simplistic to reproduce the observed distribution . the third effect mentioned above renders the line profiles asymmetric , affecting the determined velocities for the double gaussian method predominantly .",
    "the doppler tomography will , however , suffer less from this effect yielding velocities closer to the true centre - of - mass velocities .",
    "note , however , that also the doppler tomography velocities follow the centre of light and hence they also require an unknown @xmath78-correction.    for the only other emission line strong enough for a doppler map study , the hei @xmath58 line , we obtain @xmath84kms@xmath3 .",
    "there are a number of effects controlling the distribution of line emission across the roche lobe , and hence defining the location of the centre of light .",
    "parts of the lobe may be shielded from irradiation due to a vertically extended disc , and the optical thickness of this will be dependent on wavelength .",
    "the incident angle of the incoming radiation is also much larger near the terminator compared to the region near the inner lagrangion point ( l1 ) .",
    "different emission lines will thus show a different distribution reflecting the varying local conditions of the gas , the ionisation potential of the element involved as well as the geometry of the incoming radiation field .",
    "this typically leads to higher - ionisation potential lines to be formed closer to the l1 point ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "our finding that hei emission peaks closer to the l1 point compared to h@xmath1 thus agrees with this picture .",
    "it shows that the balmer lines can still be excited near the terminator , but at the same time also suffer from more effective shielding near the front of the lobe because of the increased optical depth of the accretion flow due to neutral hydrogen .    the measured radial velocity semi - amplitudes are higher and carry smaller statistical errors than those found during outburst by @xcite .",
    "besides a higher radial velocity semi - amplitude , we also find a higher systemic velocity , although the values are consistent within the @xmath66 errors .",
    "@xcite observed the system in outburst using emission lines from heii whereas our observations are done in quiescence and using h@xmath1 .",
    "the differences in x - ray flux between outburst and quiescence and the different element , may explain the difference in measured radial velocity semi - amplitude in our data compared to @xcite as explained above .",
    "line emission from the secondary can be expected to lie anywhere between its l1 point and the terminator .",
    "rather than make specific assumptions about the irradiation geometry , we will instead use the peak of the h@xmath1 emission from the doppler map as a determination of the radial velocity semi - amplitude , since it provides the strictest lower limit on the true radial velocity semi - amplitude of the mass donor , i.e. @xmath85 .",
    "hence , with @xmath73kms@xmath3 , we find that @xmath2kms@xmath3 .    676 . under the assumption that the companion is filling its roche lobe , the eclipse measurement of the eclipse duration gives a relation between the mass ratio @xmath86 and the inclination of the orbit @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the mass ratio relates to the rotational velocity @xmath9 and the radial velocity semi - amplitude @xmath10 .",
    "the dashed lines show curves for specific rotational velocities .",
    "finally , the neutron star mass function relates the neutron star mass to the mass ratio and the radial velocity semi - amplitude , giving the solid lines for specific neutron star masses .",
    "the horizontal grey area is excluded by our lower limit on the radial velocity semi - amplitude of @xmath73kms@xmath3 , setting @xmath2kms@xmath3 , while the diagonal grey area is excluded in order to satisfy that all emission originates between the radial velocity of l1 and the center - of - mass of the companion ( @xmath87 ) .",
    "these constraints dictate that the neutron star is heavier than @xmath4m@xmath5 .",
    "the hashed area is the mass range of @xmath88  m@xmath5 favoured by the work of @xcite.,width=302 ]    so far , we have used the fact that the true @xmath10 is larger than the observed @xmath52 , where the @xmath78-correction depends on the distribution of the emission across the roche lobe .",
    "thus the lines with the largest @xmath52 must be formed closest to the terminator , whereas lines with lower @xmath52 are more towards l1 .",
    "an additional limit can thus be set by demanding that @xmath89 .",
    "@xcite reported @xmath52 values that are somewhat lower than ours and we used their lower limit on @xmath90kms@xmath3 to calculate which mass ratios are ruled out because the velocity of the l1 point would be larger than 300kms@xmath3 , which would be inconsistent with the donor star components observed during outburst .",
    "this leads to a lower limit on the system mass ratio @xmath79 for a given @xmath10 which is indicated by the shaded region in the upper right of fig.[fig : mass ] . from this",
    "we see that the range of measured donor star velocities that all must satisfy @xmath87 rule out neutron star masses below 1.27m@xmath5 , so that @xmath4m@xmath5 . for the canonical neutron star mass of @xmath6m@xmath5 our observations constrain the mass ratio to a narrow range of @xmath7 and the companion mass to 0.11m@xmath91m@xmath5 .",
    "narrow h@xmath1 emission originating from the secondary star has also been observed in other quiescent low mass x - ray binaries . when measured after subtracting the underlying h@xmath1 absorption line from the secondary and accounting the veiling from the accretion disc ,",
    "the equivalent width in these systems is of 2 - 3   and comparable to that observed in rapidly rotating chromospherically active stars ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "in contrast , the narrow h@xmath1 component in exo0748@xmath0676 reaches an equivalent width of tenths of   ( fig.[fig : var ] ) .",
    "these high values of the equivalent width can be explained as due mostly to x - ray irradiation of the secondary . stellar rotation in g - m dwarfs can not produce such a strength because of saturation effects of stellar activity with rotation ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "fitting theoretical stellar template spectra to the observed spectrum averaged in the frame of the companion star , we constrain the temperature of the inner face of the mass donor star to be larger than 5000 k. stars of such a temperature do not show significant absorption lines in the spectral range covered by our observations .",
    "such temperatures are unexpected for the orbital period of exo0748@xmath0676 .",
    "a roche lobe filling main sequence star would have a mass corresponding to that of an m2 star and thus a temperature of approximately 3500 k , much lower than the lower limit derived above .",
    "besides evidence from the equivalent widths of the above mentioned emission lines and the comparison of theoretical stellar templates , we find that the continuum varies in accord with a heated inner hemisphere of the mass donor star ( see fig.[fig : var]d ) , hence , the variability in magnitude over the orbit can not be explained fully by the change in equivalent width of the emission lines .",
    "repeat observations targeting a different wavelength range showing deep stellar absorption lines from the mass donor star even in the presence of heating due to the hot neutron star have been requested .",
    "furthermore , the hot neutron star probably causing the irradiating flux ( @xcite ) could cool significantly on timescales of a year reducing the irradiating flux ( @xcite ) .",
