    "after nearly a century of investigations , cosmic rays ( cr ) still represent a scientific challenge and offer fundamental questions about their origin and nature .",
    "the cr energy spectrum remarkably shows only little deviation from a constant power law @xmath6 across the large energy range from @xmath7  ev to @xmath8  ev .",
    "the main paradigm for explanation of this non - thermal spectrum is the diffusive acceleration of charged particles in the vicinity of astrophysical shocks .",
    "the small variations of the spectral index are signs of possible changes in the cr acceleration and/or propagation regimes .",
    "the significant increase in the slope of the cr spectrum to @xmath9 occurs at the so - called knee near @xmath10  ev , and is presently attributed to a maximum energy expected in the diffusive shock acceleration in galactic supernova remnants ( snr ) . at much higher energies , corresponding to the `` ankle '' observed at @xmath11  ev , the spectrum becomes again @xmath12 .",
    "the integral cosmic ray flux above the ankle is only about 1  particle per km@xmath13 steradian year , which implies the need for huge detectors to collect substantial statistics .",
    "supernova remnants are thought to be prime candidates for the acceleration of galactic cosmic rays up to energies of several @xmath14 ev . at these ultra - high ( uhe , e @xmath0  ev ) energies ,",
    "only a few astrophysical acceleration sites unify the conditions ( sufficiently large size , strong magnetic fields ) allowing to efficiently produce the cosmic rays , a list of candidates being limited to objects like active galactic nuclei , gamma - ray bursts or galaxy clusters .",
    "coincidentally , the cosmic rays above @xmath15  ev  are able to arrive on earth from regions external to the local group of galaxies ( d @xmath16  mpc ) . above @xmath17  ev",
    ", the bulk of the uhecr is believed to be extragalactic , which is comforted by the non - observation of anisotropies connected with the galactic plane .",
    "if this standard acceleration scenario with the nuclei arriving from sources at cosmological distances holds , it is expected that the cosmic ray flux should undergo a strong suppression ( so - called gzk cut - off  @xcite ) at energies above  @xmath18  ev .",
    "this spectral break corresponds to the effective threshold of pion production in the interaction of the uhecr protons with the cmb radiation . at similar energies , nuclei photo - dissociate on the cmb . as a consequence , the horizon of the uhecr sources in the standard scenarios",
    "is restricted to our local `` neighbourhood '' ( @xmath19 50 mpc ) . above the gzk cut - off ,",
    "the deflections of cosmic rays in the galactic and intergalactic magnetic fields are minimal , and individual cr sources should be observed .",
    "alternatively , more exotic uhecr scenarios have been proposed . in some of these scenarios ,",
    "cosmic rays are produced in interactions or decays of the primordial universe relics such as topological defects or super - heavy dark matter .",
    "contrary to the astrophysical acceleration scenarios , these `` top - down '' uhecr production models predict a substantial fraction of primary photons and neutrinos .    to distinguish between different uhecr scenarios ,",
    "it is crucial to measure precisely the cosmic ray arrival direction distribution , primary mass composition , and energy spectrum . since the uhecr fluxes are small , these highest energy particles are only detectable in an indirect way , through the extensive air showers ( eas ) they create in the atmosphere . above the energies around @xmath20",
    "ev / nucleon , the technique of sampling the shower particles , predominantly electrons , gammas , and muons , by detectors on the ground becomes efficient .",
    "lateral distributions of eas particles , measured by surface detector arrays , reflect the particle densities in the tail of the shower far away from the shower axis , and serve to estimate the primary energy and mass .",
    "however , at the highest energies such estimates depend strongly on assumptions about the hadronic interactions , which are extrapolated to energies exceeding by far those accessible at man - made accelerators and in regions of phase space not covered in collider experiments .",
    "the advantages of surface detector arrays include stable operation with 100% percent duty cycle , and a relatively straightforward determination of the aperture .    in the uhe regime , where the auger experiment operates",
    ", the air fluorescence technique allows estimation of the primary cr energy . as fluorescence light",
    "is produced proportional to the energy deposited in the atmosphere , this technique provides a calorimetric energy measurement that is fairly independent of the details of the shower development , and thus of our understanding of the individual hadronic interactions .",
    "unfortunately , the fluorescence technique can only be used in dark , clear nights , which reduces its duty cycle to about 10% .",
    "another drawback of this technique is that the aperture of a fluorescence detector grows with shower energy , and its determination for all operating conditions is nontrivial .    during the long period before the advent of the pierre auger observatory , the world",
    "largest cosmic ray data set above @xmath21 ev has been collected by two experiments , each exploiting only one of these methods , either the detection of shower particles on the ground ( agasa surface array ) , or the fluorescence technique ( hires ) .",
    "consequently , the results of agasa and hires were affected by different systematics .",
    "in addition , because of the small available statistics , the key issue of the presence of the gzk cut - off in the uhecr energy spectrum remained unclear .",
    "to improve this situation , the auger observatory was conceived in the 1990s  @xcite as a hybrid detector , combining the two detection techniques and covering an area 30 times larger than that of the agasa array .",
    "the pierre auger observatory for the ultra - high energy cosmic ray studies has been designed and built by an international collaboration of more than 350 scientists representing @xmath22 institutions from 17 countries .",
    "the observatory site in the province of mendoza , argentina will be completed in the year 2008 .",
    "the auger surface detector ( sd ) consists of 1600 water cherenkov detectors , deployed over 3000 km@xmath23 on a hexagonal grid with 1500 m spacing .",
    "the sd array is overlooked by the auger fluorescence detector ( fd ) , which comprises 24 fluorescence telescopes , arranged in four sites at the perimeter of the sd area .",
    "this hybrid design allows the simultaneous detection of the same cosmic ray events by two complementary techniques , which provides important cross - checks and measurement redundancy .",
    "the auger detector layout and the status of deployment as of june 2008 is shown on the fig.[fig : sd - array - status-20080611 ] . the properties and performance of the hybrid instrument can be found in  @xcite .",
    "each surface detector station consists of a polyethylene tank , 1.55 m high and 3.6 m diameter , enclosing a liner filled with 12 tons of purified water .",
    "three 9 inch diameter photomultiplier tubes ( pmts ) , located symmetrically at a distance of 1.2 m from the center of the tank , look downward through windows in the liner and collect the cherenkov light from the passage of showers particles in the water .",
    "the pmt signals are digitized at  @xmath24 sampling frequency , which provides a temporal resolution of  @xmath25 .",
    "the electronics package also includes gps receiver and a radio communication system .",
    "each tank is equipped with a 10 watt solar power system and operates in an autonomous manner . a robust , automatic calibration procedure of the sd detectors @xcite uses the measurement of the average charge , collected by a pmt from the cherenkov light produced by relativistic muons passing vertically through the center of a tank .",
    "subsequent measures of the signal are given in such vertical equivalent muon ( vem ) units .",
    "the sd calibration procedure is carried out continuously , and enables to determine the signals recorded from extensive air showers with 3% accuracy .",
    "it also allows to achieve stable and uniform triggering conditions through the whole sd array .",
    "a hierarchical trigger sequence is applied to ensure the rejection of accidental triggers in order to retain the physical events .",
    "then the tank signal timing information and the integrated charge values are used for reconstruction of shower geometry ( arrival direction and core position ) .",
    "the measured signals as a function of distance from the shower axis are fitted for individual events to obtain the water cherenkov signal at a distance of 1000 m , s(1000 ) , which serves as an estimator of the size of each event .",
    "simulations show that both for proton- and iron - induced showers the s(1000 ) parameter is almost proportional to primary energy .",
    "also , at these distances from the axis the fluctuations of lateral distribution of particle density are minimal for studied energies and adopted array geometry , for zenith angles @xmath26 .",
    "the overall uncertainty in s(1000 ) at energies around @xmath21 ev is about 10% , and improves with energy @xcite . for s(1000 ) @xmath27 vem ( which corresponds to energies lower than  @xmath28 ev ) , the main contribution to the uncertainty is due to the finite dimension of the detectors and the small counting statistics . at higher energies ,",
    "the major contribution to the uncertainty in s(1000 ) arises from the fluctuations in the shower development and the consequent lack of knowledge of the true lateral particle distribution shape for a particular event .",
    "the angular resolution of the surface detector was determined from the shower front arrival times , on an event by event basis , and checked using the data from the pairs of sd stations located @xmath29  m apart ( see @xcite and the references therein ) .",
    "the resolution was found to be better than 2@xmath30 for 3-fold events ( events with 3 stations participating in the event , which corresponds to energies @xmath31 ev ) , better than 1.2@xmath30 for 4-fold and 5-fold events ( @xmath32 ev ) and better than 0.9@xmath30 for higher multiplicity events ( @xmath33 ev ) .",
    "the `` quality '' cuts , which are used in most analyses , select among the physical events those with the highest signal recorded in a tank surrounded by six operating ones , and with the reconstructed core within a triangle of working stations . also , the events with arrival zenith angles @xmath26 are considered .",
    "these selection criteria guarantee that showers are sufficiently well contained within the sd array to allow a robust measurement of s(1000 ) and the shower axis .",
    "the quality cuts result in a 100% combined trigger and reconstruction efficiency above @xmath34 ev @xcite . at higher energies ,",
    "the effective area of the sd array at any time is calculated from the number of active hexagons , which can be determined from the low - level triggers sent by each station every second ( see @xcite and the references therein ) . + the auger fluorescence detectors measure the faint ultra - violet light emitted as the shower traverses the atmosphere .",
    "each of the 24 individual schmidt design telescopes covers a  @xmath35 range in azimuth and  @xmath36 range in elevation .",
    "a  @xmath37 segmented spherical mirror ( radius of curvature  3.4  @xmath38 ) is focusing the light from the  @xmath39 diameter diaphragm onto a camera of  @xmath40 pmts , each with a field of view of 1.5@xmath41 in diameter .",
    "the pmt signals are digitized at  @xmath42 sampling rate . at the diafragm opening",
    ", there is a ring corrector lens to double the light collection efficiency and to reduce the aberrations , and a uv - transparent filter window , which also serves as a protection from dust .",
    "the optical and electronics calibration of the fd system is known to 9.5% .",
    "the absolute end - to - end calibration is performed periodically through the year , using a uniformly illuminated drum positioned at the diafragm aperture .",
    "the nist calibrated light source with known intensity and spectral and directional characteristics allows for measurements at five wavelengths .",
    "the relative calibration , made twice every night with pulsed leds and/or xe flashers , keeps track of any changes between the drum calibrations .",
    "the atmosphere is an integrated part of the fd operation , and the attenuation of the fluorescence light due to rayleigh and aerosol scattering along its path toward the telescope have to be carefully monitored .",
    "each fd site is equipped with a single wavelength lidar .",
    "regular balloon launches are performed to measure vertical profiles of the air temperature and pressure .",
    "the atmospheric monitoring system also includes one raman lidar , a meteo station per fd site , a remote - controlled centrally positioned yag laser , and dedicated aerosol monitors and cloud cameras .",
    "the systematic uncertainties in atmospheric attenuation contribute approximately 4% to the systematic uncertainty for shower energy estimate . for the energy deposited in the atmosphere by shower particles",
    "the data from @xcite are currently being applied , with the systematic uncertainty in the absolute fluorescence yield of 14% .",
    "the measurements from @xcite are used for the wavelength and pressure dependence of the fluorescence spectrum .",
    "uncertainty related to pressure , temperature and humidity effects amounts to 7% .",
    "the image of a shower developing in the field of view of a telescope represents a track of triggered pmts , which enables to reconstruct a shower - detector plane ( sdp ) with a high precision ( @xmath43 ) .",
    "the pixel timing information is used to determine the shower direction .",
    "when , in addition to an fd telescope , one or more sd tanks participate in the event ( hybrid detection ) , the sd timing information improves considerably the shower geometry reconstruction .",
    "compared to the case of mono fd events , the accuracy of angular reconstruction and of the determination of the core position of the showers are both improved about a factor of 10 .    in the algorithm",
    "used to reconstruct the longitudinal profile of a shower , care must be taken to collect the fluorescence light without inclusion of the night - sky background , and to properly account for a contribution of direct and scattered cherenkov light .",
    "the reconstructed profile of the energy deposit , fitted with a gaisser - hillas function @xcite , provides a measurement of the shower energy , and of x@xmath44 , the depth of the shower maximum .",
    "systematic uncertainties in the reconstruction method contribute 10% to the total uncertainty in the measured energy .",
    "a final small correction ( @xmath45 at the auger energies ) takes into account the `` missing '' energy due to muons and neutrinos .",
    "the quality cuts applied to the hybrid events selected for the data analysis are described in @xcite .",
    "the hybrid method provides a nearly calorimetric , model - independent energy measurement with a statistical resolution of 8% .",
    "the corresponding resolution in x@xmath44 is 20 g / cm@xmath23 .",
    "the quoted systematic uncertainties in the energy scale by the hybrid method ( see @xcite and the references therein ) add up to 22% , the largest contributions being due to the uncertainties in the absolute fluorescence yield ( 14% ) and the absolute fd calibration ( 10% ) .",
    "+ the results reported here are essentially based on the analysis of the data collected at the pierre auger observatory between 1 january 2004 and 31 august 2007 . during this time , the sd array grew from 154 to 1388 tanks , and the number of fd telescopes increased from 6 to 24 . the integrated exposure over this period",
    "is four times greater than that of agasa , similar to the monocular hires exposure , and is equivalent to roughly 1 year of operation of the full auger array . above @xmath47",
    "ev , the auger observatory has recorded more events than all previous experiments together .",
    "the expected future annual increment of the exposure is 7000 km@xmath13 sr yr .",
    "the hybrid nature of the auger detector allowed a measurement of the energy spectrum to be made with high statistics , and with small dependence on assumptions about hadronic interaction models or the primary mass composition .",
    "we use the constant integral intensity cut method , which exploits the nearly isotropy of cosmic rays , to rescale s(1000 ) value from different zenith angles @xmath48 .",
    "the choice of the threshold s(1000 ) value is not critical , since the shape of the attenuation curve giving intensity i(@xmath49s(1000 ) ) in equal solid angle bins of @xmath50 is within the statistics nearly the same in the large range of s(1000 ) @xcite .",
    "we normalize s(1000 ) for each event to the signal it would have produced at a zenith angle of 38@xmath30 , which is the median value for zenith angles of interest .",
    "we establish the relation between that quantity called @xmath51 , and the calorimetric fd energy measurement for currently 661 selected high - quality hybrid events .",

    "the recent pierre auger observatory measurements of the uhecr energy spectrum , arrival directions and mass composition , albeit taken during the detector construction phase , have already significantly contributed to the progress in the field .",
    "the obtained results have demonstrated the power of the auger hybrid design .",
    "the southern auger observatory is now almost complete ( the surface detector assembly and deployment activities have been essentially completed in august 2008 ) .",
    "the auger south will provide the good quality experimental data for at least ten years .",
    "+ since the elaboration of the auger project design report  @xcite in the 1990s , it was proposed to construct two similar instruments in both hemispheres , in order to cover the whole sky . in 2005",
    ", a site in colorado , usa , has been chosen to host the northern auger observatory .",
    "the auger north will focus on the highest energy cosmic rays , with the aim to provide higher statistics at energies above the observed cosmic ray flux suppression . this will facilitate identification of individual nearby uhecr sources against the isotropic event background from the more distant objects , and thus will establish the long - sought charged particle astronomy .    to facilitate the data integration from both observatories",
    ", auger north will be built using the same basic elements as in the southern observatory : water cherenkov detectors , fluorescence telescopes , and an associated infrastructure for communications and calibration .",
    "the performed research and development work has led to the design  @xcite of an array of @xmath98 surface detectors , covering the area of @xmath99 square miles , or @xmath100 , i.e. @xmath101 times the southern array . from 40 to 50 fluorescence telescopes",
    "will be needed for the almost full hybrid coverage of this large area .",
    "the envisaged layout of surface detectors ( positioned with the spacing of @xmath102 on a square grid ) will allow the array to be fully efficient for hadronic showers above @xmath103  ev . the proposal for auger north is currently being finalized . +",
    "while it is clear that the highest energy cosmic rays arrive from extragalactic sources , it is currently not known at which energy the extragalactic cr flux becomes dominant .",
    "this question is central to the understanding of the nature of accelerators and their injection spectrum , as well as of the cr propagation in large - scale cosmic magnetic fields .",
    "competing scenarios could be distinguished by better determination of cr mass composition and energy spectrum in the energy range between about @xmath14  ev and @xmath34  ev , where the transition between galactic and extragalactic cosmic rays is expected  @xcite .",
    "two hybrid `` low '' energy extensions of the southern auger observatory ( auger enhancements ) will explore this energy range .",
    "new fluorescence detector , a system of three high elevation auger telescopes ( heat ) , is currently being installed near the coihueco fluorescence site .",
    "the first telescope is expected to be operational in november 2008 , and the last two will be operational in early 2009 .",
    "heat will cover a range of elevation angles from 30@xmath41 to 60@xmath41 .",
    "the combined shower data of the coihueco and the heat telescopes will lead to better resolutions for the determination of air shower energy and x@xmath44 , especially below @xmath104  ev  @xcite .    to extend the hybrid technique down to @xmath105  ev",
    ", a denser array of water cherenkov detectors of present design is currently being deployed on a @xmath106 area centered 6 km away from the fluorescence detector installations at coihueco site .",
    "each water cherenkov detector will be accompanied by a @xmath107 muon scintillator counter buried alongside 3 m underground .",
    "the whole complex , baptized amiga ( auger muons and infill for the ground array ) will consist of 85 pairs of water cherenkov and muon detectors , placed on 433 and 750 m triangular grids .",
    "amiga surface detectors will complement the fluorescence measurements , and the muon detectors will be used to determine the mass composition in the range @xmath108  ev  @xcite .",
    "+ within the auger collaboration , there is also an active program to investigate the radio emission of extensive air showers in the 10 @xmath109 100 mhz band  @xcite .",
    "this method for shower studies , first introduced in the 1960s , has revived recently due to the new radio measurement techniques .",
    "the radio shower detection is exploitable with a 100% duty cycle , and provides additional information on the development of the electromagnetic shower component , which can be used to measure the primary cr energy , arrival direction , and mass in a way complementary to the sd and fd techniques .",
    "the tests of radio detection of showers with various antenna systems are currently being performed on the southern auger site .",
    "a recently obtained funding will allow the construction of a @xmath110 engineering array at the location of amiga infill .",
    "this engineering array will serve to the development of radio detection , with a goal to elaborate a design of a much larger array , that will cover an area of many thousand @xmath111 .",
    "i would like to thank the organizers of the 15@xmath112 international seminar `` quarks-2008 '' , and of the accompanying 4@xmath112 international uhecr workshop , for inviting me to present the results of the pierre auger collaboration at both conferences .",
