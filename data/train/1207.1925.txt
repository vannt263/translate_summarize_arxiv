    "tropical geometry has exploded as an area of research in the last decade , with many new connections and applications appearing each year .",
    "these include enumerative geometry , mirror symmetry , arithmetic geometry , and integrable systems .",
    "it builds on the older area of tropical mathematics , more commonly known as max - plus algebra , which arises in semigroup theory , computer science , and optimization .",

    "the goal of this expository and elementary article is to introduce this exciting new area .",
    "we develop the theory of tropical varieties and outline their structure and connection with `` classical '' varieties .",
    "there are several approaches to tropical geometry .",
    "we follow the `` embedded '' approach , which focuses on tropicalizing classical varieties .",

    "see work of mikhalkin and collaborators @xcite , @xcite for details on this .",
    "this direction is most developed for curves .",
    "one of the attractions of tropical geometry is that it has so many disparate , but connected , facets , so any survey is necessarily incomplete .",
    "we begin by introducing tropical mathematics , focusing on tropical polynomials and their solutions . in this paper",

    "the tropical semiring is associative and distributive , with additive identity @xmath5 and multiplicative identity @xmath6 .",

    "indeed , the top - dimensional cones correspond to the @xmath67-fixed points @xmath282 , [ 0:1:0]$ ] and @xmath283 $ ] , which do not lie in @xmath276 , while every other @xmath67-orbit does contain a point of @xmath276 .",
    "a fundamental problem in algebraic geometry , especially in the consideration of moduli spaces , is to find a good compactification of a variety . here",
    "the notion of `` good '' will depend on the specific problem , but we often require the compactification to be smooth , the `` boundary '' ( new points added in the compactification ) to be a divisor ( codimension - one ) , and the irreducible components of this divisor to intersect nicely .",
    "[ e : deconciniprocesi ] let @xmath284 be a hyperplane arrangement in @xmath66 , where @xmath285 , with @xmath286 .",
    "let @xmath287 .",
    "this can be embedded into @xmath288 by sending @xmath167 to @xmath289 $ ] .",
    "let @xmath99 be the @xmath290 matrix with columns the vectors @xmath291 , which we assume has rank @xmath292 , and let @xmath293 be a @xmath294 matrix of rank @xmath295 with @xmath296",
    ". then @xmath297 .",
    "one choice of compactification of @xmath92 is the original @xmath66 ; another is the deconcini - procesi wonderful compactification  @xcite .    a natural way to compactify",
    "a variety is to take its closure in a larger variety .",
    "the idea we follow , due to tevelev  @xcite , is to take as the larger variety a toric variety whose fan has support the tropical variety .",
    "note that if @xmath298 there is not a unique such fan , and there may be no preferred choice .",
    "the first condition is somewhat surprising , since the toric variety @xmath272 is not itself compact .",
    "for example , if @xmath302 , then @xmath74 is the standard tropical line",
    ". there is only one polyhedral fan @xmath121 with this support , and the corresponding toric variety is @xmath268 with three points removed , which is not compact .",
    "however in this case the closure of @xmath92 in @xmath268 , which is clearly compact , does not pass through these three points , so the closure of @xmath92 in @xmath272 equals the closure of @xmath92 in @xmath268 , so is also compact .",
    "the second condition means that the pull - backs to @xmath276 of the codimension-@xmath301 torus - invariant strata on @xmath272 give a finite number of distinguished classes in the chow group @xmath303 .",
    "for example when @xmath304 this gives a distinguished collection of effective divisors on @xmath276 .",
    "if the fan @xmath121 is chosen to be sufficiently refined then we get further control over the compactification @xmath276 .",
    "one way to guarantee `` sufficiently refined '' is to choose a fan @xmath121 so that @xmath245 is constant for all @xmath305 for all @xmath188 .",
    "by further refining @xmath121 we can also assume that the toric variety @xmath272 is smooth . with a sufficiently refined fan we have :    1 .",
    "the multiplicity @xmath202 on a maximal cone @xmath242 of @xmath121 equals the intersection number @xmath306 \\cdot    [ v(\\sigma)]$ ] , where @xmath307 is the closure of the @xmath67-orbit corresponding to @xmath242 .",
    "2 .   for any @xmath188 , the intersection of @xmath276 with the @xmath67-orbit @xmath308 is the quotient @xmath309 for any @xmath310 .",
    "see also @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite for more details on this .",
    "the connection to intersection theory has been further developed by allermann and rau  @xcite , which is the tropical analogue of earlier toric work by fulton and sturmfels  @xcite .    when @xmath311 , as in example  [ e : deconciniprocesi ] , there is a coarsest fan structure @xmath121 on @xmath312 , since every other fan with support @xmath74 has cones that subdivide those of @xmath121 .",
    "the tropical compactification @xmath276 coming from taking the closure in @xmath272 is the deconcini / procesi wonderful compactification for most choices of @xmath313 ; see  @xcite and @xcite .",
    "a motivating example of this is given by the moduli space @xmath314 .",
    "the moduli space @xmath315 parameterizes isomorphism classes of smooth genus zero curves with @xmath17 distinct marked points .",
    "it thus parameterizes ways to arrange @xmath17 distinct point on @xmath316 up to @xmath317 .",
    "for example , @xmath318 is a point , as there is an automorphism of @xmath316 that takes any three distinct points to @xmath319 . when @xmath320 , @xmath321 . in general",
    ", @xmath322 we thus have @xmath315 as the complement of @xmath323 hyperplanes .",
    "this means the moduli space @xmath315 can be be embedded into @xmath324 as a closed subvariety as in example  [ e : deconciniprocesi ] .",
    "the tropical variety @xmath325 is the support of a @xmath326-dimensional fan @xmath327 in @xmath328 .",
    "the toric variety @xmath329 is smooth , but not complete ( projective ) .",
    "the fan @xmath327 is the space of phylogenetic trees , which comes from mathematical biology .",
    "see , for example , @xcite for more on this space , and @xcite for some of the connection , which uses kapranov s description  @xcite of @xmath330 as the chow quotient of a grassmannian .",
    "maximal cones of @xmath327 are labelled by trivalent trees with @xmath17 labelled leaves . a point in the cone",
    "records the length of the internal edges in the tree .    a picture of @xmath327 when @xmath331 is shown in figure  [ f : m05 ] .",
    "this is a two - dimensional fan in @xmath332 , so its intersection with the four - dimensional sphere in @xmath332 is a graph , which is drawn in figure  [ f : m05 ] .",
    "the closure of @xmath315 in @xmath329 is the deligne - mumford moduli space @xmath314 of _ stable _ genus zero curves with @xmath17 marked points .",
    "this parameterizes isomorphism classes of trees of @xmath316 s with @xmath17 marked points and at least three special points ( nodes or marked points ) on each component .",
    "see  @xcite or @xcite for details .    for @xmath333 ,",
    "the intersection of @xmath314 with the torus orbit corresponding to @xmath242 is the stratum of all curves with dual graph the corresponding tree . in particular ,",
    "the intersection of @xmath314 with a torus - invariant divisor on @xmath329 is a boundary divisor .",
    "the moduli space @xmath314 and the toric variety @xmath329 are closely related .",
    "their picard groups are isomorphic , and the inclusion @xmath334 introduces an isomorphism @xmath335 .",
