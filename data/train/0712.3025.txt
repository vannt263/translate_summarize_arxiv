    "the vector transitions in weak decays play a special role in phenomenology of the weak interactions . according to the standard model ( sm )",
    "the @xmath6-boson and the photon originate from the same multiplet of @xmath7 group and they have the same form of vector coupling with matter .",
    "therefore , the vector weak transition could be related to its isospin analogous electromagnetic process by the cvc hypothesis  @xcite .",
    "for example , the branching ratio of @xmath8 decay can be predicted on the base of the pure electromagnetic process @xmath9",
    "@xcite . indeed ,",
    "earlier , at a moderate precision of the experimental data , the agreement between these two processes was satisfactory  @xcite .",
    "however , with increasing the precision in both sets of experimental data the discrepancy between them has reached an unacceptable level of 4.6 @xmath10  @xcite .    at present , even after the appearing of additional high - precision data , the same level of discrepancy still remains  @xcite .",
    "the importance of this discrepancy increases due to new very accurate measurements of the muon anomalous magnetic moment  @xcite .",
    "the latter should be compared with the sm prediction , which include the evaluation of the hadronic contribution to @xmath11 based on @xmath0 or / and @xmath1 data . while @xmath1-based data predict a somewhat close to the experimentally measured @xmath11 value , @xmath0 data differs by 3.3 @xmath10 from it .    to find a solution to the discrepancy between the description of @xmath0 and @xmath1 processes",
    ", some authors  @xcite have assumed that the problem is mainly due to additional isospin breaking effects and not to experimental ones .",
    "however , it is still possible that both data sets could be plagued with unknown yet systematic errors , therefore , others directly advocate @xmath1 data as more reliable  @xcite . in this letter",
    "we assume that , in spite of some inconsistency in both data sets among different experiments , they properly describe real physical processes , and that the discrepancy stems from additional new _ centi - weak _ tensor interactions in the weak processes .    of course , so radical solution of the problem should effect also other low - energy precise experimental data as on muon and neutron decays , and so on .",
    "it has been shown in previous papers  @xcite that those effects are still within experimental uncertainties of the present measurements .",
    "conspiracy of the hypothetical interactions is stipulated by their different chiral properties in comparison with @xmath12 interactions . in many cases",
    "this prevents or suppresses interference between the new interactions and the ordinary ones , which should give a leading contribution from the new interaction in the case of its weakness .",
    "the only known examples of manifestation of such interference are the radiative pion decay  @xcite , @xmath13 , and the @xmath1-decay  @xcite , @xmath14 .",
    "in this paper it will be shown that the anomaly in the latter decay has direct relation to the problem of @xmath5 extraction from the @xmath1-decay : its systematically low value in comparison with other evaluations .",
    "the recent @xcite and belle  @xcite measurements of branching fractions for several hadronic @xmath1-decay modes with kaons allow to emphasize this fact  @xcite .    assuming the presence of the new interactions we will analyse the most precise extractions of the cabibbo angle from superallowed @xmath15 nuclear beta transitions , neutron and @xmath1 decays , and also from the ratio of kaon and pion decay widths , /@xmath16 , @xmath17 and hyperon decays .",
    "the latter three methods strongly depend on flavor-@xmath18breaking effects , which can not be safety calculated at present , and do not provide a unique absolute determination of the cabibbo angle . nevertheless",
    ", using the unitarity relation we will show that all mentioned methods can lead to self - consistent results .",
    "the effective tensor interactions @xmath20 naturally appear in an extension of the sm with new type of spin-1 chiral bosons described by the antisymmetric second - rank tensor fields  @xcite . here",
    "@xmath21 is the momentum transfer between quark and lepton currents .",
    "the dimensionless coupling constant @xmath22 determines the strength of the new interactions relative to the ordinary weak interactions . with magnitude",
    "@xmath23 these interactions allow to explain the anomaly in the radiative pion decay  @xcite and at the same time to escape constraints from other precise measurements , due to their peculiar form . in order to distinguish these interactions from the ordinary ones , taking into account their strength",
    ", we will refer to them as the _ centi - weak _ interactions .",
    "assuming flavor universality we can rewrite the interactions ( [ udenu ] ) for the third lepton family as @xmath24 namely , these interactions are responsible for an additional contribution to the vector transition @xmath25 in comparison with the sm prediction , based on the cvc hypothesis . in the ref .",
    "@xcite simple formula for the corresponding branching fractions has been derived @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the mass ratio of the @xmath1 lepton and the @xmath28 meson , and the positive factor @xmath29 is expressed through the effective coupling constant @xmath22 and the ratio of the transverse and longitudinal coupling constants of the @xmath28 meson , @xmath30  @xcite .",
    "the knowledge of the experimental excess , @xmath31  @xcite , allows to fix @xmath32 more precisely than before , which is now up to 4@xmath10 above zero .",
    "the interactions ( [ udenu ] ) do not effect the superallowed fermi transitions , which are described by a vector quark current in the effective weak lagrangian @xmath33 therefore , the extraction of the matrix element @xmath19 from the supperallowed @xmath34 nuclear @xmath35-decays should give , in principle , its more reliable value .",
    "however , in reality the product @xmath36 is measured , where @xmath37 is the well known fermi coupling constant .",
    "the latter is deduced from the muon decay , which may be effected by new interactions .",
    "indeed , assuming again universality of the new interactions ( [ udenu ] ) one can introduce purely leptonic tensor interactions @xmath38 which include only left - handed neutrinos and right - handed charged leptons . in accordance with the see - saw mechanism , we assume here that the right - handed neutrinos are very massive and they do not contribute to the low - energy processes .",
    "therefore , in contrast to the semileptonic tensor interactions , the effective leptonic interactions do not include a term analogous to the second term in ( [ udenu ] ) .",
    "let us note that the interactions ( [ munuenu ] ) are not present among the michel local interactions and their effect on electron spectrum can not be described by the michel parameters only .    besides the distortion of the ordinary @xmath12 electron spectrum , the tensor interactions give additional positive contribution to the muon decay width  @xcite @xmath39 since @xmath40 this leads effectively to new value for the real magnitude of the fermi coupling constant @xmath41 instead of @xmath42 .",
    "therefore , the master formula for the @xmath19 determination from superallowed @xmath35 decays  @xcite should be corrected as @xmath43    the present most precise pdg value of @xmath44  @xcite is based on nine best measured superallowed decays  @xcite without the mentioned correction .",
    "however , there exist a problem with the recent precise penning - trap measurements  @xcite of the @xmath45 value for the superallowed decay of @xmath46v , which has significantly effected its @xmath47 and @xmath19 values .",
    "recently , towner and hardy  @xcite have recalculated the isospin - symmetry - breaking correction including _ core orbitals _ , which remove the discrepancy with @xmath46v , and get somewhat higher value for @xmath48 .",

    "( [ mastervud ] ) , this gives a new value of @xmath51    another independent information about the matrix element @xmath52 can be obtained from the neutron decay , which , however , besides the vector transition , includes also the axial - vector amplitude characterized by the additional phenomenological parameter @xmath53 .",
    "therefore , besides the precise knowledge of the neutron lifetime @xmath54 additional measurements of @xmath53 are necessary .",
    "the master formula for @xmath52 determination from the neutron decay reads  @xcite @xmath55    at present there are severe disagreements in the experimental results both for the neutron lifetime , @xmath54 , and @xmath53 value and there is no sense to evaluate the averages .",
    "according to us this situation is connected to huge corrections , which have been applied in older experiments to the raw data in order to extract the final result . by our opinion",
    "the recent measurements of the neutron lifetime @xmath56 s  @xcite and parameter @xmath57  @xcite are most reliable , where for the latter the applied corrections were just 0.09% , which is even below the experimental uncertainty . using these numbers and eq .",
    "( [ mastern ] ) one gets @xmath58 this value is in a very good agreement with ( [ newvud ] ) , while the pdg value of the neutron lifetime @xmath59 s leads to the following @xmath60 , which is about 4@xmath10 below than the reference value ( [ newvud ] ) .",
    "even the effect of the new tensor interactions can not help to improve the situation .",
    "it is known from ref .",
    "@xcite that the new interactions ( [ udenu ] ) do not effect the neutron lifetime in the leading order on @xmath22 , while they change effectively @xmath61 , extracted from the electron asymmetry parameter @xmath62 , where @xmath63 is within the experimental uncertainty for the reference value ( [ ft ] ) .",
    "if we accept this correction , we get slightly different value than ( [ nvudsm ] ) @xmath64 which is also in agreement with ( [ newvud ] ) .    using the most precise value of @xmath52 ( [ newvud ] ) and the unitarity relation @xmath65 we can check selfconsistency of @xmath5 determination from different processes .",
    "this is possible due to the small value of @xmath66  @xcite and present accuracy of @xmath19 extraction ( [ newvud ] ) .",
    "indeed , neglecting @xmath67 effects the unitarity relation ( [ unitarity ] ) at an accuracy level of @xmath68 , which is much less than the uncertainty @xmath69 stems from @xmath70 contribution .",
    "therefore , the approximation by the cabibbo angle @xmath71 and @xmath72 is still very suitable for description of processes with light quarks .    using this approximation and the corrected @xmath19 value ( [ newvud ] ) , extracted from the superallowed @xmath35 decay ,",
    "one gets matrix element @xmath73 which is in agreement with the pdg value of @xmath74 , but has almost two times better accuracy .",
    "since the most precise value of @xmath75 is extracted from semileptonic kaon decays @xmath76 , namely from the expression @xmath77",
    "@xcite , our result ( [ newvus ] ) indirectly confirms the reliability of the analytical evaluations  @xcite and the lattice calculations  @xcite of @xmath18-breaking corrections to the form factor ( see the left panel in the fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] ) @xmath78 which is in a very good agreement with the naive average of the results , presented in the fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] @xmath79    assuming the latter as an independent input , we can derive the _ most _ precise values of the matrix elements @xmath80 and @xmath81 from the kaon decays only .",
    "another verification of the results in eqs .",
    "( [ newvud ] ) and ( [ newvus ] ) , can be found from the experimental ratio of the decay widths @xmath82   mev and @xmath83  mev  @xcite which is not effected by the tensor interactions and is proportional to the ratios @xmath84 and @xmath85 for the latter ratio there are several unquenched lattice calculations for @xmath86 dynamical quark flavors  @xcite , which are in a good accordance with eq .",
    "( [ fkpi ] ) , except the cp - pacs / jlqcd result  @xcite ( see the right panel in the fig .  [ fig:1 ] ) .",
    "their naive average @xmath87 also agrees with eq .",

    "it is interesting to note , that many authors of the lattice calculations compare their results with the old ` experimental ' value @xmath88 from review @xcite , which is still present in the recent pdg editions and is used as an important input parameter for the chiral perturbation theory .",
    "this value is based on the old result by leutwyler and roos for @xmath89  @xcite from @xmath76 decays , which is pushed up at present to a higher central value after the recent decided experiments by bnl e865",
    "@xcite , ktev , na48 , istra+ and kloe collaborations . and paper @xcite . ]",
    "therefore , the more precise and updated result from eq .",
    "( [ fkpi ] ) should be used .",
    "let us turn now to the @xmath1 decays .",
    "being a heavy lepton , @xmath1 possesses pure leptonic decays as well as hadronic decays , which to a less extent are effected by the qcd complications than the hadronic meson decays . at the same time many of the hadronic @xmath1 decays",
    "could be considered as cross - channels of the semileptonic meson decays or just related through the cvc hypothesis to the processes of the electromagnetic @xmath90 annihilation .",
    "all this makes the @xmath1 decay investigations very sensitive to an eventual manifestation of new physics .",
    "indeed at present there is a serious well known 4.5@xmath10 discrepancy between the measured and the predicted two pion branching ratio of the @xmath1 decay  @xcite .",
    "neither susy nor other known models can explain this anomaly .",
    "however , it has a natural explanation  @xcite in the extended standard model with the effective tensor interactions ( [ udtaunu ] ) .",
    "if we assume the presence of such interactions , it will be possible also to solve the problem with systematically low central value of @xmath5 extracted from hadronic @xmath1 decays  @xcite .",
    "the idea is very simple and is based on the proper accounting for the additional contributions from the new semileptonic interactions ( [ udtaunu ] ) and the analogous pure leptonic interactions ( [ munuenu ] ) for the @xmath1 lepton .",
    "these interactions could contribute both to the leptonic and hadronic modes of the @xmath1 decays .",
    "it is know that only six decay modes @xmath91 , @xmath92 , @xmath93 , @xmath25 , @xmath94 and @xmath95 account for 90% of the decays .",
    "let us consider them in detail .    according to the eq .",
    "( [ gmuon ] ) the leptonic decay widths of the @xmath1 lepton should increase in comparison with the sm due to new interactions by 0.02% and 0.51% for the electronic and muonic modes , correspondingly .",
    "this statement should be compared with the experimental averages of the electronic and muonic branching fractions @xmath96 which are claimed to be known with a relative precision of 0.3%  @xcite and their ratio @xmath97 perfectly matches the sm value @xmath98 .",
    "however , one should be cautions and mind the _ overconsistency _ of leptonic branching fraction measurements  @xcite .",
    "the predicted corrected ratio @xmath99 although higher than the experimental average , is still in agreement with the data  ( see the left panel in the fig .  [ fig:2 ] ) .",
    "all hadronic modes of @xmath1 decays into final state with _ odd _",
    "pions , which are related to the _ axial - vector _ hadronic currents , are not effected by the new interactions due to the absence of an appropriate tensor current @xmath100 in ( [ udtaunu ] ) . at the same time",
    "all nonstrange ( @xmath101 ) decays , which undergo through hadron _ vector _",
    "transitions , acquire additional contributions .",
    "a substantial effect of the new interactions has been found namely in @xmath25 decay  @xcite due to the constructive interference between the new interactions and the standard ones .",
    "the comparison of the experimental data with the corrected cvc value using eq .",
    "( [ excess ] ) @xmath102 is shown in the right panel of the fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] .",
    "the strange ( @xmath103 ) hadronic @xmath1 decays , which contain around 3% of the total decay width , are very important input for @xmath5 determination .",
    "they just concern this matrix element for cabibbo - suppressed ( axial-)vector transitions between left - handed quarks of the different generations .",
    "the new tensor interactions have different chiral structure than the ordinary @xmath12 interactions and , in general , should be described by a different mixing matrix between left - handed and right - handed quarks . at present there is no indication of a presence of new interactions in kaon decays  @xcite .",
    "therefore , we assume a near diagonal structure of the new mixing matrix and an absence of tensor transitions between different generations .",
    "the master formula for the matrix elements extraction from the @xmath1 decays has the following form @xmath104 where @xmath105 is the ratio of the inclusive nonstrange hadronic decay width and the electron width , while @xmath106 is its strange counterpart .",
    "it is assumed that only the ordinary @xmath12 interactions exist . here",
    "the difference @xmath107 is the @xmath18-breaking quantity induced mainly by the strange quark mass , which can be theoretically estimated within the qcd framework  @xcite .",
    "the experimentally measured quantities @xmath108 and @xmath109 are not independent and their sum should be related to the following combination of the leptonic branching fractions @xmath110 where the average electronic branching fraction @xmath111 @xcite and the predicted ratio ( [ rbmbe ] ) were used .",
    "the latter corrects the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ sumbr ] ) for an effect of the tensor interactions in the lepton channels , however their impact is well below the uncertainty and slightly changes only the cental value .    the left hand side of eq .",
    "( [ sumbr ] ) also should be corrected for the additional contributions from the new physics . since the vector transitions occur through the vector meson resonances @xmath28 , which are effected by the new interactions , then not only @xmath25 channel , but @xmath112 , @xmath113 and other channels with _ even _ pions states should be revised , as well .",
    "using the recent evaluations  @xcite @xmath114 and neglecting the higher number meson states we get 5@xmath10 deviation in @xmath115    if we assume that the undistorted vector contribution in the @xmath1 decay can be deduced from the experimental data on @xmath0 annihilation by the cvc hypothesis , i.  e.@xmath116 , while its axial - vector and strange counterparts are not effected by the new interactions , i.  e.@xmath117 and @xmath118 respectively , then we can apply corrections ( [ rtaucvc ] ) and ( [ sumbr ] ) to the master eq .",
    "( [ mastertau ] ) with @xmath119 the master equation is usually solved for the unknown parameter @xmath120 , while the other entries are considered known inputs . here we will show that using the unitarity relation , it is possible to extract the ratio @xmath121 from eq .",
    "( [ mastertau ] ) and the matrix element @xmath120 with even better precision .    to finalize the matrix elements extraction we need to define two more inputs @xmath106 and @xmath107 .",

    "( [ newvud ] ) , ( [ newvus ] ) and ( [ vusvud ] ) shows , that the extracted from the hadronic @xmath1 decays matrix elements , based on the old data , are in a perfect agreement with the present most precise measurements from the superallowed beta decays , while the new and belle results lead to the low value for @xmath120 , but still statistically acceptable .",
    "this agreement induces us to make doubt of the and belle measurements , moreover , they have analyzed only several cabibbo - suppressed hadronic @xmath1 decay modes and all their results show systematically low values . perhaps we need to wait for more serious investigations which include thorough analysis of the main @xmath1 decay channels as well .",
    "let us compare now our derivation ( [ mastervusvud ] ) of the matrix elements from the hadronic @xmath1 decays with the usually used one @xcite .",
    "first of all let us note that the eq .",
    "( [ mastervusvud ] ) for @xmath131 determination is very similar to the formula for @xmath120 and even has a slightly lower uncertainty .",
    "however , we get the main gain in precision for @xmath120 determination from the ratio @xmath131 using unitarity .",
    "the simple evaluations show that , if the precisions for @xmath120 and @xmath132 are the same , we get around 8% better accuracy for @xmath120 determination from the ratio ( @xmath133 ) . the second advantage of the eq .",
    "( [ mastervusvud ] ) consists in a possibility of a simultaneous extraction of @xmath120 and @xmath52 as well with a good precision . although it can not still compete with the accuracy of the superallowed beta decays , we get @xmath52 ( [ tauvud ] ) with even less uncertainty than from the neutron decays ( [ neutronvud ] ) .",
    "the surprising agreement between the matrix elements , extracted from the superallowed beta decays and from the hadronic @xmath1 decays , results from the essential corrections of the hadronic decay width , @xmath134 , ( [ sumbr ] ) and ( [ rtaucvc ] ) due to the new tensor interactions .",
    "it should be noted that uncorrected @xmath134 input leads approximately to one standard deviation less central value for the @xmath120 , what has been pointed out in @xcite . to support our suggestions",
    "we will draw attention to the results of ref .",
    "@xcite , where the weighted spectral integrals have been used .",
    "it has been shown that using spectral weights which suppress the contributions from the region of the spectrum with high hadronic masses , the central values of the extracted @xmath120 are systematically higher than for the unweighted case .",
    "it is just in concordance with our results from @xcite , which predict a monotonically increasing deviation of the @xmath1 spectral function from the sm case with the increase of the hadron invariant mass .",
    "therefore , a suppression of this part of the spectrum allows to make more reliable predictions .    in conclusion ,",
    "we would like also to compare our results with @xmath120 extraction from strangeness - changing semileptonic hyperon decays , which , as we assumed , are not influenced by the new interactions in contrast with cabibbo - allowed decays .",
    "a simple phenomenological fit of the decay rates and axial - vector to vector form factors ratios , up to @xmath18 breaking effects , leads to the following result  @xcite @xmath135 where @xmath136 is the ratio of the vector formfactor @xmath137 to its @xmath18 predicted value .",
    "this analysis has been confirmed in ref .",
    "@xcite . however , the authors suggest two times bigger uncertainty due to the disagreement of the different theoretical estimations of @xmath136 . comparing the result ( [ hypvus ] ) with the reference value ( [ newvus ] ) one can conclude , that @xmath136 is equal to one up to second - order @xmath18 breaking effects in agreement with the ademollo  gatto theorem  @xcite .",
    "it means that the @xmath18 breaking corrections in hyperon decays at present accuracy are still not essential and their account results in a smaller central value of @xmath138  @xcite .",
    "the main purpose of this paper is to point out the necessity for the account of the new tensor interactions in the weak processes . for many processes their effect",
    "is still well below the experimental uncertainties , however , for some of them their account is urgently needed .",
    "it happens due to the weakness of the new interactions and their different chiral structure in comparison with the sm .",
    "they can reveal themselves , for example , in chirally suppressed pion decays , or in result of the interference of the tensor currents from the _ centi - weak _ interactions with transverse hadronic currents , as in tau decays . at the same time , due to the complexity of the lorentz structure of such interactions , they do not contribute to the two - particle pion decay as the more simple hypothetical pseudoscalar interaction would .",
    "all these properties of the new tensor interactions allow them often to escape stringent experimental constraints .    in this paper",
    "we have analyzed of the extraction of the matrix elements between light quark species . using the available experimental data and the unitarity relation , we have shown that all results can be come selfconsistent , if    \\(a ) the new data for the neutron decay are used ,    \\(b ) the old branching fractions of strangeness - changing @xmath1 decays are correct ,    \\(c )",
    "the additional tensor interactions are taken into account .",
    "+ the latter removes the disagreement between the spectral functions extracted from the electromagnetic @xmath0 data and the @xmath1 decays .",
    "it gives us the possibility to use both data for the evaluation of the hadronic contribution into the muon anomalous magnetic moment .",
    "this could strengthen the present discrepancy between its predicted and experimentally measured values .    taking this discrepancy",
    "seriously we can constrain other sector of our model connected with new _",
    "neutral _ tensor currents , which should also be present in the extension of the sm by doublets of the tensor particles  @xcite .",
    "the new charged and neutral tensor current interactions appear as effective interactions resulting from the exchanges of the massive charged and neutral tensor particles , respectively .",
    "the doublet structure of the new particles stems from the symmetry of the sm and that the tensor interactions as the ( pseudo)scalar ones mix the left and right handed fermions from different representations of @xmath139 group . in order to compensate the contributions of the new couplings of the tensor particles into the chiral anomaly ,",
    "the doubling of the doublets both for the tensor and higgs particles is needed .",
    "besides this , in order to prevent also the presence of flavor - changing neutral currents , up and down type fermions should couple different doublets of the higgs  @xcite and tensor particles .    in ref .",
    "@xcite the masses of the new tensor particles have been estimated .",
    "two mass scales around 700 gev and 1 tev for the different doublets have been derived on the basis of the dynamical principe and the value of the effective coupling constant @xmath22 , which shows the relative strength of the new interactions in comparison with the sm . due to additional mixing the lightest charged tensor boson has a mass around 500 gev and can effect nonnegligibly the charged current sm processes , while the lightest neutral tensor boson couples just to the up type fermions and can effect leptonic processes with neutrinos .",
    "additional contributions into neutral current processes with charged leptons come from the exchanges of the heavy neutral tensor particles and are around four times weaker than in the charged tensor current sector .",
    "nevertheless , an eventual mixing of the heavy neutral tensor particles with photons can effect electromagnetic characteristics of charged leptons like their anomalous magnetic moments , which have been measured with unprecedent precision for the electron and muon .",
    "it has been shown @xcite that such mixing can explain the sign of the discrepancy between the predicted and measured muon anomalous magnetic moment . in contrast to the new heavy particles , which contribute through the loops and effect the anomalous magnetic moments as @xmath140 , the effect of the mixing is proportional to @xmath141 .",
    "therefore , the effect of the new physics on the electron anomalous magnetic moment could be stronger than have been expected and can be tested in independent measurements of the fine structure constant @xmath142 . on the other hand the mass scale of the new tensor particles offers a unique possibility for their discovery at the large hadron collider .",
