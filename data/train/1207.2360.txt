    "the discovery of superconductivity in layered lafeaso@xmath8f@xmath9 four years ago has brought a new trend to synthesize and study new materials which are analogous to this compound.@xcite by now , most of the interest is focussed on the materials as @xmath10 `` 122''-type , @xmath4fe@xmath11 `` 111''-type and fe@xmath11 `` 11''-type which have high superconducting transition temperature @xmath12 and can be obtained as high - quality single crystals .",
    "only few studies have been reported on low @xmath12 pnictide compounds or those that do not show superconductivity at all.@xcite among those is , that has the same tetragonal thcr@xmath5si@xmath5-type structure as @xmath13fe@xmath5as@xmath5 at room temperature and undergoes no structural transition upon cooling.@xcite the antiferromagnetic order appears at @xmath14  k ; i.e.  at much higher temperature than for the @xmath13fe@xmath5as@xmath5 compounds.@xcite while most of the @xmath10 parent compounds are metallic ,  is a semiconductor with a small band gap @xmath15  27  mev according to @xmath16-resistivity measurement.@xcite an @xmath17 suggested that the difference in magnetic and electronic properties compared to those of @xmath13fe@xmath5as@xmath5 is due to the strong hund s coupling , the stability of the half - filled @xmath18-shell of the mn@xmath19 ( @xmath20 ion ) and strong spin - dependent mn - as hybridization.@xcite    in this paper , we present mainly the infrared studies on  single crystals with the electric field polarized within the @xmath0-plane and parallel to the @xmath1-axis .",
    "the sample with a size of @xmath21 was grown out of sn fluxes .",
    "the magnetic , transport , and thermal properties of our material have been reported recently.@xcite for the infrared reflectance measurements , we cleaved the crystal within the @xmath0-plane and finely polished the @xmath22-plane in order to get shiny surfaces .",
    "the temperature dependent reflectivity spectra were measured in a wide frequency range from 40 to 37000  using fourier - transform infrared spectrometers ( @xmath23  ) and a variable - angle spectroscopic ellipsometer ( @xmath24  , restricted to room temperature ) .",

    "the rather low overall reflectivity ( @xmath27  30% ) indicates that  is a rather bad metal or a semiconductor . besides the pronounced phonon vibrations in far - infrared region which we will discuss in detail later in this paper",
    ", two interband transition can be identified at approximately 7000  ( 0.87  ev ) and 26000  ( 3.2  ev).@xcite the temperature dependence of the reflectivity spectra is displayed in fig .",

    "this prevents us from a correct evaluation of conductivity spectra as commonly done by a kramers - kronig analysis.@xcite nevertheless , all the pronounced phonon vibration modes show lorentzian like shapes and thus are applicable for extracting the physics behind . according to the tetragonal thcr@xmath5si@xmath5-type structure ( with space group i4/mmm ) in which the @xmath10 usually crystallizes , a group theoretical analysis of the phonon modes in  yields a@xmath28+b@xmath28 + 2e@xmath29 raman - active , 2a@xmath30 + 2e@xmath31 infrared - active and a@xmath30+e@xmath31 acoustic optical zone center phonons ,",

    "[ fig : fig6 ] , we display the calculated atomic transverse optical displacements and the measured to / lo frequencies for all zone center phonons .",
    "note that , in our calculations only a small lo - to splitting of less than 1  could be observed .",
    "the reason for such a small splitting and the discrepancy in the frequencies bases mainly on the nonmagnetic state revealing no band gap .",

    "[ fig : fig4 ] , no change in the phonon shape is observed for these modes due to the absence of structural transition upon cooling .",
    "but the e@xmath34 mode with higher vibrational frequency is enhanced in intensity and continuously shift to higher frequencies .",
    "recent neutron diffraction measurement on the thermal contraction revealed that by cooling from 300  k to 10  k , @xmath37 distance decrease from 2.566(2 ) to 2.558(2).@xcite the lattice distortion with reducing bond lengths enhances the electronic interactions between atoms and therefore the phonon vibrating energy increases  consistent with the observed blue shift of this e@xmath34 mode in our spectra .",
    "there is an extra broad hump at the frequency around 400   in the in - plane reflectivity spectra , as shown in fig.1(a ) .",
    "according to the phonon calculations , we can exclude it to be a phonon mode . as the optical conductivity spectra of",
    "are phonon - rich ones , we will here analyze the optical data by looking at the relative change of the conductivity @xmath38 , as plotted fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] , to get rid of the strong phonon oscillations and see basically only the electronic background and consequently the spectral weight redistribution upon varying the temperature . as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] , around 300   @xmath39 drops to negative values with decreasing temperature , then it increases at higher frequency and crosses zero at 440   indicating that the spectral weight redistributes from low to high energies .",
    "such a spectral weight rearrangement is the typical signature for an energy gap formation . from the minimum of @xmath40 we estimate the gap value 2@xmath41  ( 48  mev).@xcite interestingly , singh _ et al .",
    "_ recently performed a gap analysis on the @xmath16-conductivity curve of this material.@xcite there two linear ranges were found in the @xmath42 , and according to the expression @xmath43 two activation energies @xmath44  mev and @xmath45  mev were derived respectively .",

    "the @xmath1-axis conductivity ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3 ] ) varies only slightly with temperatures .",
    "when @xmath47  0  , no drude like behavior is observed and @xmath48 is quite low , indicating that the material is insulating along the @xmath1-axis .",
    "no transfer of spectral weight is induced by the gap opening .",
    "in contrast to iron - pnictides @xmath13fe@xmath5as@xmath5 , the present compound  reveals distinctively different electronic properties for the in - plane and out - of - plane directions , i.e.  the material is more two - dimensional . in previous optical studies on bafe@xmath5as@xmath5 by wang and",
    "collaborators,@xcite the metallic responses were found for both @xmath49 and @xmath6 with an anisotropy - factor about three.@xcite while two spin - density - wave gaps were revealed in the @xmath0-plane , one of them also opens along the @xmath1-axis , giving evidence for a three - dimensional fermi surface in the electronic structure.@xcite furthermore , the low carrier mobility in  infers more localized charge carriers , in the contrast to the itinerant nature of the electronic properties of @xmath13fe@xmath5as@xmath5 .",
    "the reason is the antiferromagnetic arrangement of the mn@xmath19 spins both in the @xmath0-plane and along the @xmath1-axis ( g - type antiferromagnetic order ) , where at low temperature the electron hopping between nearest neighbor sites with opposite spin is suppressed and a strong scattering is induced by the spin disorder at high temperature.@xcite     ( color online ) @xmath1-axis conductivity of  as a function of frequency from 40 to 1000  measured at selected temperatures . ]",
    "in summary , the optical properties of iron - pnictide analog  have been studied in detail using light polarized in the @xmath0-plane and along the @xmath1-axis . within the @xmath0-plane",
    ", the material behaves like a poor metal or semiconductor .",
    "an energy gap can be defined at @xmath7=48  mev .",
    "the @xmath1-axis spectra show a typical insulating behavior overall and no energy gap is found .",
