    "cosmic rays are the product of energetic processes in the universe , and their interactions with matter and fields are the source of much of the diffuse gamma - ray , x - ray , and radio emissions that are observed .",
    "therefore , the origin of cosmic rays and how they propagate have a major impact on our understanding of the universe .",
    "supernova shock waves could provide the power required to sustain the galactic cosmic - ray intensity , but details of the acceleration mechanism are not completely understood .",
    "the shock acceleration mechanism is believed to be a prevalent process in astrophysical plasmas on all scales throughout the universe .",
    "it has been shown to work in the heliosphere , e.g. , at planetary bow shocks , at interplanetary shocks in the solar wind , and at the solar wind termination shock .",
    "it is a characteristic of diffusive shock acceleration that the resulting particle energy spectrum is much the same for a wide range of shock properties .",
    "this energy spectrum , when corrected for leakage from the galaxy , is consistent with the observed spectrum of galactic cosmic rays . in the most commonly used form of the theory , the characteristic limiting energy is about @xmath6 @xmath7 @xmath8 ev , where @xmath6 is the particle charge @xcite .",
    "the observed composition should begin to change beyond about @xmath8 ev , the limiting energy for protons , and the fe spectrum would start to steepen at an energy 26 times higher . in this scenario , protons would be the most dominant element at low energies , but heavier elements would become relatively more abundant at higher energies , at least up to the acceleration limit for iron .",
    "compelling evidence that supernova remnants ( snrs ) are common sites for shock acceleration of electrons comes from observations of non - thermal synchrotron radiation from several shell - type remnants @xcite .",
    "non - thermal x - ray spectra indicate the presence of very high energy electrons which , at least in the case of sn 1006 , have energies @xmath92 @xmath10 ev @xcite .",
    "these electrons were likely accelerated at the remnant because at this energy electrons can not travel far from their origin before they are attenuated by synchrotron losses .",
    "there are other sources of particle acceleration that may also contribute to the cosmic - ray beam @xcite .",
    "recent _ chandra _ x - ray observations of _ tycho s _ snr have shown hot stellar debris keeping pace with an outward - moving shock wave indicated by high - energy electrons .    semi - direct evidence for the acceleration of cosmic - ray protons could come in the form of gamma rays from pion decay @xcite .",
    "indeed , the observation of tev gamma rays , possibly of @xmath11-origin , from the snr rx j1713.7@xmath33946 @xcite may have revealed the first specific site where protons are accelerated to energies typical of the main cosmic - ray component .",
    "their hadronic origin is yet to be confirmed , but the cangaroo collaboration has shown that the energy spectrum of gamma - ray emission from snr rx j1713.7@xmath33946 matches that expected if the gamma rays are the decay products of neutral pions generated in _",
    "p - p _ collisions .",
    "although the proton scenario is favored because of the spectral shape , gamma rays may originate from either electrons or protons .",
    "a complete understanding of gamma - ray emission processes may need a broadband approach @xcite , using all the available measurements in different wavelength regions .",
    "direct measurements of nuclear particle composition changes would provide strong corroborating evidence that shocks associated with shell - type snrs provide the acceleration sites for cosmic rays .",
    "shock acceleration is the generally accepted explanation for the characteristic power - law feature of cosmic - ray energy spectra , although ground - based measurements have shown that the all - particle spectrum extends far beyond the highest energy thought possible for supernova shock acceleration .",
    "these measurements have also shown that the energy spectrum above @xmath12 ev is somewhat steeper than the spectrum below @xmath8 ev , which lends credence to the possibility of a different source .",
    "of course , the `` knee '' structure might be related to energy - dependent leakage effects during the propagation process @xcite or to other effects , such as reacceleration in the galactic wind @xcite and acceleration in pulsars @xcite .",
    "whether and how the spectral `` knee '' is related to the mechanisms of acceleration , propagation , and confinement are among the major current questions in particle astrophysics .",
    "the cosmic ray energetics and mass ( cream ) experiment @xcite was designed and constructed to extend balloon and space - based direct measurements of cosmic - ray elemental spectra to the highest energy possible in a series of balloon flights .",
    "the detailed energy dependence of elemental spectra at very high energies , where the rigidity - dependent supernova acceleration limit could be reflected in composition change , provides a key to understanding the acceleration and propagation of cosmic rays .",
    "we report in this paper the proton and helium spectra as well as their ratios observed from the maiden flight of the cream payload in antarctica .",
    "results from the cream experiment such as b / c ratio and heavy elemental spectra are discussed in elsewhere @xcite .",
    "the first long duration balloon ( ldb ) flight of the cream payload was launched from mcmurdo station , antarctica on december 16 , 2004 .",
    "it subsequently circumnavigated the south pole three times for a record - breaking duration of 42 days ; the flight was terminated on january 27 , 2005 .",
    "the instrument float altitude remained between 37 and 40 km through most of the flight .",
    "the corresponding atmospheric overburden was 3.9 @xmath4 0.4 g @xmath1 .",
    "the diurnal altitude variation due to the sun angle change was very small , @xmath131 km , near the pole , i.e. , at high latitude , which increased as the balloon spiraled out to lower latitudes @xcite .",
    "the temperature of the various instrument boxes stayed within the required operational range with daily variation of a few @xmath14c , consistent with the sun angle .",
    "a total of 60 gb of data including @xmath04 @xmath7 10@xmath15 science events were collected .",
    "the science instrument was supported by the command and data module developed by the nasa wallops flight facility ( wff ) @xcite .",
    "this is in contrast to typical ldb payloads which utilize the support instrumentation package provided by the columbia scientific balloon facility .",
    "cream was the first ldb mission to transmit all the prime science and housekeeping data ( up to 85 kbps ) in near real - time through the tracking and data relay satellite system ( tdrss ) via a high - gain antenna , in addition to having an onboard data archive .",
    "to fit the data into this bandwidth , science event records excluded information from channels that had levels consistent with their pedestal value .",
    "this `` data sparsification '' reduced the average high - energy shower event record size by nearly 95@xmath16 .",
    "the science instrument was controlled from a science operation center at the university of maryland throughout the flight after line - of - sight operations ended at the launch site .",
    "primary command uplink was via tdrss , with iridium serving as backup whenever the primary link was unavailable due to schedule or traversing zones of exclusion .",
    "the nearly continuous availability of command uplink and data downlink allowed rapid response to changing conditions on the payload ( e.g. , altitude - dependent effects ) throughout the flight .",
    "more details about flight operations and the data acquisition system are discussed elsewhere @xcite .",
    "the instrument was designed to meet the challenging and conflicting requirements to have a large enough geometry factor to collect adequate statistics for the low flux of high - energy particles , and yet stay within the weight limit for near - space flights @xcite .",
    "it was comprised of a suite of particle detectors to determine the charge and energy of the very high energy particles .",
    "as shown schematically in figure [ fig : inst ] , the detector configuration included a timing charge detector ( tcd ) , a transition radiation detector ( trd ) with a cerenkov detector ( cd ) , a silicon charge detector ( scd ) , hodoscopes ( hds ) , and a tungsten / scintillating fiber calorimeter .",
    "starting from the top , the tcd consists of two crossed layers of four 5 mm thick and 1.2 m long plastic scintillators @xcite .",
    "it defines the 2.2 m@xmath17 sr trigger geometry and determines charge based on the fact that the incident particle enters the tcd before developing a shower in the calorimeter , and the backscattered albedo particles arrive several nanoseconds later .",
    "a layer of scintillating fibers , s3 , located between the carbon target and the tungsten calorimeter provides a reference time .",
    "[ t ]    the trd determines the lorentz factor for @xmath6 @xmath18 3 nuclei by measuring transition x - rays using thin - wall gas tubes .",
    "transition radiation is produced when a relativistic particle traverses an inhomogeneous medium , in particular the boundary between materials of different dielectric properties .",
    "the trd consists of a foam radiator and 16 layers of proportional tubes filled with a mixture of xenon ( 95@xmath16 ) and methane ( 5@xmath16 ) gas @xcite .",
    "the cd between the two trd sections provides low - energy particle rejection at the flight site , antarctica , where the geomagnetic cutoff is low .",
    "it also provides additional charge identification .",
    "the scd is comprised of 380 @xmath19 m thick si sensors @xcite .",
    "it is segmented into pixels , each about 2.12 cm@xmath17 in area to minimize multiple hits in a segment due to backscattered particles .",
    "the targets are comprised of blocks of densified graphite cemented in carbon / epoxy composite cradles .",
    "the vertical thickness of the carbon targets is about 0.5 interaction lengths .",
    "they force hadronic interactions in the calorimeter , which measures the shower energy and provides tracking information to determine which segment(s ) of the charge detectors to use for the charge measurement @xcite .",
    "the calorimeter consists of 20 tungsten layers interleaved with scintillating fiber ribbon layers which are alternately oriented in the @xmath21- and @xmath22-directions .",
    "each tungsten layer is 1 radiation length thick to sample the shower every radiation length .",
    "each layer consists of fifty 1 cm wide and 0.5 mm thick fiber ribbons to measure the longitudinal and lateral distributions of the shower .",
    "the light signal from each ribbon is collected by means of an acrylic light - mixer coupled to a bundle of clear fibers .",
    "this is split into three sub - bundles , each feeding a pixel of a hybrid photo diode ( hpd ) . in this way",
    "the wide dynamic range of the calorimeter is divided into three sub - ranges ( low , mid , high ) with different gains , chosen to match the dynamic range of the front - end electronics @xcite .",
    "tracking for showers is accomplished by extrapolating each shower axis back to the charge detectors .",
    "the hds s0/s1 and s2 , comprised of 2 mm thick and 2 mm wide scintillating fibers , provide additional tracking information above the tungsten stack @xcite .",
    "the tracking uncertainty is smaller than the pixel size of the scd @xcite .",
    "tracking for non - interacting particles is achieved in the trd with better accuracy ( 1 mm resolution with 67 cm lever arm , 0.0015 radians ) .",
    "the trd and calorimeter have different systematic biases in determining particle energy .",
    "the use of both instruments allows in - flight cross - calibration of the two techniques and , consequently , provides a powerful method for measuring cosmic - ray energies @xcite .",
    "details of the detectors and their performance are discussed elsewhere @xcite .",
    "the main trigger conditions for science events were ( 1 ) significant energy deposit in the calorimeter for high - energy particles or ( 2 ) large pulse height , @xmath6 @xmath9 2 , in the tcd for heavy nuclei .",
    "the former requires each of six consecutive layers in the calorimeter to have at least one ribbon recording a deposit of more than 45 mev .",
    "the high - energy shower events that meet this calorimeter trigger condition were used in this analysis .      the ribbon with the highest energy deposit and the neighboring ribbons on both sides were used to determine the position in each layer of maximum energy deposits .",
    "the shower axis was reconstructed by a least - squares fit of a straight line through a combination of these hit positions in the @xmath23 and @xmath24 planes @xcite .",
    "hits not along the straight line were excluded from the fit .",
    "the resulting trajectory resolution is @xmath01 cm when projected to the scd .",
    "the reconstructed trajectories were required to traverse the scd active area and the bottom of the calorimeter active area .    at this stage non - interacting particles",
    "are removed , but some events have their first hadronic interaction in the calorimeter layers instead of the carbon targets .",
    "these late interacting events could result in an underestimation of deposited energy , or misidentification of charge due to large uncertainties in the trajectory reconstruction .",
    "since their longitudinal shower profiles are different , events with small energy deposit in the top few layers of the calorimeter were removed to ensure that the selected events had their first interactions either in the carbon targets or in the top of the calorimeter .      in order to determine the incident particle charge , the reconstructed shower axis from the calorimeter",
    "was extrapolated to the scd and a 7 @xmath7 7 pixel area , about 10 @xmath7 10 cm@xmath17 , centered on the extrapolated position , was scanned to seek for the highest pixel signal .",
    "the scanned area was optimized to sustain the charge identification efficiency of 99@xmath16 in all energy bins , accounting for dead and noisy scd and calorimeter channels ( @xmath015@xmath16 and 13@xmath16 , respectively ) , and determined to be a 7 @xmath7 7 pixel area .",
    "that highest pixel signal was then corrected for the particle path length ( calculated from the reconstructed incidence angle ) in the sensor .",
    "the signal reflects the ionization energy loss per unit path length ( @xmath25 ) of an incident particle in the scd .",
    "the energy loss is proportional to @xmath26 .",
    "according to monte carlo ( mc ) simulations and beam tests , the expected contamination from secondary particles back scattering from the calorimeter is @xmath133@xmath16 when this tracking - based selection method is used @xcite .",
    "the resulting scd signal distribution is shown in figure [ fig : scdz ] .",
    "events with @xmath6 @xmath13 1.7 were selected as protons , while events with 1.7 @xmath27 @xmath6 @xmath13 2.7 were selected as helium nuclei .",
    "the charge resolutions are estimated as @xmath00.15 @xmath2 and @xmath00.2 @xmath2 for protons and helium nuclei , respectively .",
    "the proton and helium losses due to @xmath25 landau tails were corrected by charge selection efficiencies , which will be discussed in section [ sec : absoluteflux ] .",
    "the proton events in the helium range were removed as a background in the helium selection , and the helium events in the proton range were removed as a background in the proton selection , which will be discussed in section [ sec : background ] .",
    "unstable scd channels identified by their large root - mean - square pedestal variations throughout the flight were excluded from the analysis . including dead or noisy channels , @xmath015@xmath16 of the total 2,912 scd channels were masked .",
    "[ t ]      an ionization calorimeter is the only practical way to measure the energy of protons and helium nuclei above @xmath01 tev , but calorimeters with full containment of hadronic showers are too massive to be incorporated into space - based or balloon - borne experiments @xcite . a thin",
    "calorimeter offers a practical approach but the calorimeter calibration requires the use of accelerator beam particles having known energy .",
    "the cream calorimeter was calibrated before the flight with electron beams at the european organization for nuclear research ( cern ) .",
    "each of the 1000 fiber ribbons was exposed to 150 gev electrons .",
    "the responses from the 50 ribbons in a given layer are equalized by moving the detector in steps of 1 cm vertically or 1 cm horizontally , so the electron beam is centered each time on the center of a different ribbon in each x or y layer .",
    "the calorimeter was designed to measure the energy deposit from showers initiated by nuclei with energies up to 10@xmath28 ev and higher .",
    "its sampling fraction for isotropically incident tev proton showers initiated in the graphite targets is about 0.13@xmath16 of the parent s energy in the active media . with electron test beam energies of 150 gev or less , only 8@xmath310 layers around the shower maximum register enough scintillation to allow calibration .",
    "to address this , the calibration scan was carried out in three sets of runs by exposing the calorimeter from the bottom with additional targets along the beam line as described in @xcite .    the energy deposit expected along the shower core in each layer",
    "was calculated using mc simulations of electron showers .",
    "conversion factors from analog - to - digital conversion ( adc ) signals to mev were obtained from the ratio of mc simulation of the energy deposited in each ribbon to the measured adc signal from the calibration beam test .",
    "the mc simulations were based on geant / fluka 3.21 @xcite .",
    "the adc signals were corrected for the hpd quantum efficiency and gain difference from the different hpd high - voltage settings between the beam test and the flight .",
    "inter - calibration between the low- and mid- energy ranges , and between the mid- and high- energy ranges were carried out with flight data by comparing the signals from two ranges of the same ribbon generated by the same shower .",
    "none of the proton and helium event candidates saturated in the middle range , so the high range optical division was not needed for this analysis .",
    "more details about the calibration can be found in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the calorimeter , hds , and scd were also exposed to nuclear fragments ( a / z = 2 ) of a 158 gev nucleon@xmath5 indium beam at cern @xcite .",

    "the composition and energy spectra are not accurately known , although there have been some pioneering measurements @xcite .",
    "the collecting power of cream is about a factor of two larger than that of atic for protons and helium nuclei and , considering the much larger geometry factor of the trd , about a factor of 10 larger for heavier nuclei .",
    "tracer has a larger geometry factor than cream , but a smaller dynamic charge range ( @xmath6 = 826 ) was reported for its 10-day antarctic flight . although its dynamic charge range was improved to @xmath6 = 326 for its @xmath04 day flight from sweden to canada in 2006 , it is still insensitive to protons and helium nuclei .",
    "the cream payload maintained a high altitude , corresponding to an atmospheric overburden of 3.9 g @xmath1 for vertically incident particles .",
    "that implies about 6.8 g @xmath1 at the maximum acceptance angle for this analysis , which is smallest among comparable experiments .",
    "for example , the average vertical depth for runjob was more than twice that of cream , due to its low flight altitude . considering the runjob acceptance of particles at large zenith angles ,",
    "its effective atmospheric depth was as large as 50 g @xmath1 .",
    "for that depth , large corrections are required to account for the fact that 41@xmath16 of protons would have interacted before reaching the detector .",
    "the cream calorimeter is much deeper than either that of jacee or runjob , so it provides better energy measurements .",
    "cream also has excellent charge resolution , sufficient to clearly identify individual nuclei , whereas jacee and runjob reported elemental groups .",
    "our observation did not confirm a softer spectrum of protons above 2 tev reported by @xcite or a bend around 40 tev @xcite .",
    "an increase in the flux of helium relative to protons could be interpreted as evidence for two different types of sources for protons and helium nuclei as proposed by @xcite .",
    "the observed harder spectra compared to prior low - energy measurements may require a significant modification of conventional acceleration and propagation models , with significant impact for the interpretation of other experimental observations .",
    "the cream experiment was planned for ultra long duration balloon ( uldb ) flights lasting about 100 days with super - pressure balloons .",
    "while waiting for development of these exceptionally long flights , the cream instrument has flown five times on ldb flights in antarctica .",
    "it should be noted that a 7 million cubic foot ( @xmath00.2 million cubic meters ) super - pressure balloon was flown successfully for 54 days during the 2008 - 2009 austral summer season .",
    "as uldb flights become available for large science payloads , long - duration exposures can be achieved faster and more efficiently with reduced payload refurbishment and launch efforts .",
