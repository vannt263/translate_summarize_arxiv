    "the 2-d electron systems in gaas - based structures as well as those found in si mosfets are being intensely studied owing to the accessibility of a wide range of electron densities under controlled conditions , leading to a wealth of the experimental observations@xcite .",
    "the nature of the physics depends very much on the `` coupling parameter '' @xmath6 = ( potential energy)/(kinetic energy ) .",
    "the @xmath6 for the 2des at @xmath2 , and the mean density @xmath0 is equal to the mean - disk radius @xmath7 per electron , usually expressed in effective atomic units which depend on the bandstructure mass and `` background '' dielectric constant .",
    "the 2des in gaas / alas structures will be called a simple 2des or one - valley 2des to distinguish it from the two - valley system found in si - mosfets .",
    "the inversion layer adjacent to an oxide layer grown on the si-(001 ) surface contains two equivalent valleys which host the two valleys of the electron fluid .",
    "various aspects of such multi - valley systems were studied@xcite by sham and nakayama , rasolt et al , and others , mainly in the high density limit .",
    "the simple 2des is also a two component system because of the two spin species , while the 2-valley system involves 4-components and ten pair - distribution functions ( pdfs ) .    in a recent study of the effective mass @xmath8 and the effective land-@xmath9 factor of the 2des ,",
    "the coulomb coupling between the electrons of the two valleys was shown to have a dramatic effect at low densities when the coupling becomes large@xcite . in effect",
    ", the elementary excitations of the two fluids in the two valleys interact to form coupled modes , giving rise to new effects .",
    "it was shown experimentally@xcite that @xmath10 rises rapidly with decreasing density in si - mosfets , and that this rise is due to a dramatic increase in @xmath8 , independent of the spin polarization , while @xmath5 remains essentially constant .",
    "calculations for the si system which account for the inter - valley coulomb coupling quantitatively predict@xcite the sharp increase in @xmath10 .",
    "it was also shown that @xmath5 remained essentially constant , in strong contrast to the behaviour found for the simple one valley 2des@xcite .",
    "the effective mass was also shown to be practically independent of the spin polarization @xmath1 , in excellent quantitative agreement with the data of of shashkin et al.@xcite for si - mosfets .",
    "this result leads to the view that the rapid rise in @xmath8 near @xmath11 e/@xmath12 is _ not caused _ by localization effects , impurity effects , etc . ,",
    "usually associated with the phenomenology of the 2-d metal - insulator transition .",
    "the enhancement of @xmath10 in the 1-valley 2des of gaas / alas systems is found to be strongly dependent on the spin polarization@xcite , in strong contrast to the si - mosfet case .",
    "our calculations@xcite show that the physics of the 1-valley system is dominated by the presence of a transition to a fully polarized state which makes @xmath5 increase rapidly with @xmath13 as the transition density is approached .",
    "the 2-valley system shows _ no such transition to the spin - polarized state _ and is insensitive to the spin polarization .",
    "given that perturbative many - body theory becomes questionable for @xmath14 , within the present context there are two approaches to evaluating the susceptibility enhancement .",
    "the second derivative of the total free energy @xmath15 with respect to the spin - polarization @xmath1 gives a direct value for @xmath10 of the two - valley system .",
    "this requires the @xmath1-dependent 2-valley energy which is not yet available from quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) simulations .",
    "however , we can evaluate @xmath15 using chnc , and also show that the chnc results agree with qmc data ( available at @xmath3 and @xmath16 .",
    "another approach , which avoids the need for a full 4-component calculation is to build up the 2-valley susceptibility by noting that the one - valley energy @xmath15 is available at @xmath2 from qmc , and at any @xmath17 from chnc .",
    "the coupling of the excitations of the two electron fluids in the two valleys can be included in the coupled response function in a standard way .",
    "then we find that the increase in @xmath5 in the gaas 2des is associated with the `` blow - up '' of the single - valley spin response , while the behaviour of the si - mosfet 2des is related to the `` blow - up '' of the coupled - mode response .",
    "the static small-@xmath18 limit of the spin response function provides the needed @xmath19 .",
    "the objective of this paper is : ( i ) present @xmath20 data for the two valley system by a full chnc calculation involving the 10 pair distributions that are needed in the 2-valley system and establish the close agreement of the chnc results with the qmc calculations .",
    "( ii ) construct the coupled - mode response functions using the well - established one - valley data and show that these results are also validated by qmc and full chnc results .",
    "that is , we present the chnc results and compare with qmc data where available , and establish close agreement",
    ". we will not present detailed finite - t calculations ( and hence @xmath8 calculations , as detailed in ref .",
    "@xcite ) in this paper , partly to limit the phase space that has to be studied , and since finite - t data are not presently available from qmc for comparison .    in section  [ resp ]",
    "we discuss the construction of the coupled - mode response functions which use _ only the one - valley exchange - correlation data _ to obtain the 2-valley behaviour via a physically motivated approximation to the inter - valley correlations .",
    "the compressibility predicted via the small-@xmath18 limit of the so constructed coupled - mode response is found to agree very well with that from qmc or the full 4-component chnc energy calculation .",
    "this validates the coupled - mode model used in the calculation ( ref.@xcite ) of the @xmath10 enhancement in si - mosfets .",
    "the full 2-valley energy calculations enable us to examine the usual 1-valley local - density approximation ( lda ) in si - mosfets and the corrections arising from coupled - mode effects .",
    "finally we discuss the spin susceptibility enhancement obtained from these calculations , and the question of relating the electron - disk radius @xmath13 used in these calculations to the experimental densities .",
    "we consider a 2-des in a si - mosfet at a total density @xmath0 , with @xmath21 , while the density in each valley @xmath22 or @xmath23 , is taken to be @xmath24 .",
    "hence the @xmath13 parameter in each valley becomes @xmath25 .",
    "thus we do not consider density polrizations leading to @xmath26 .",
    "also the electrons in both valleys have the same spin polarization @xmath1 and the same temperature @xmath27 .",
    "this is consistent with recent studies which show that the valley splitting is very slight@xcite .",
    "if the two spin species be denoted by @xmath28 , we have a four - component 2-des with 10 independent pair distribution functions ( pdfs ) , viz .",

    "for the two valley system we use the same @xmath34 as before , and embodies the essential `` many - body '' input to the problem . in brief outline , in chnc",

    "the coulomb interaction between two electrons in the equivalent classical picture involves a correction arising from their mutual diffraction effects .",
    "thus @xmath39 is obtained by solving a two - electron schrodinger equation .",
    "the result is parametrized by the form@xcite , @xmath41 \\\\",

    "the correlation potential @xmath40 occurring in eq .",
    "[ chnceq ] is taken to be the sum of hyper - netted - chain diagrams inclusive of a bridge term .",
    "thus @xmath46 is nonlocal and is a function of the @xmath33 which have to be self - consistently calculated .",
    "the bridge term mimics the higher - order correlations which are _ not _ captured by the simplest hnc equations .",
    "these were shown to be important in 2-d electron systems in reference  @xcite .",
    "particles having identical indices ( @xmath47 ) are restricted from close approach by the pauli exclusion effect modeled by @xmath48 .",
    "however , singlet - pairs of electrons , or electrons in two different valleys contribute to strong coulomb correlations , and hence a bridge term is included in all such `` off - diagonal '' pdfs .",
    "the bridge term @xmath49 for @xmath50 applies to 6 different pdfs , and we have taken this to be given by the usual hard - disk functional form discussed in ref.@xcite .",
    "( totsuji and coworkers@xcite have studied a more detailed implementation of the hard - disk bridge function in chnc , while bulutay et al.@xcite have studied the 2-d chnc without a bridge correction ) .",
    "it should be emphasized that both the hnc approximation as well as the need for a bridge function can be avoided by using the classical mapping to a quantum fluid ( cmqf ) where we use classical molecular dynamics ( md ) to generate the pdfs etc . , of the classical fluid under consideration .",
    "in such a scheme we use the pair - potential given by eq .",
    "[ vcou ] plus the pauli potential in an md simulation for a classical plasma at the temperature @xmath44 .",
    "such a cmqf - md scheme would be numerically more demanding than the chnc , much simpler than the full qmc simulations , and have the advantage of not making the hnc+bridge approximations .",
    "however , the 2-valley ( 4-component ) system examined here has been studied by qmc and we use those results to confirm the validity of our methods .    the main difference in the physics of the 1-valley system , and the 2-valley system arises from the preponderence of direct coulomb interactions ( from 6 pdfs in the 2-valley , one in the 1-valley ) over the exchange interactions ( from 4 pdfs in the 2-valley , two pdfs in the 1-valley ) .",
    "this is the main reason for the lack of a transition to a stable @xmath51 state at low density .",
    "since the transition to a @xmath51 state does not occur as @xmath13 increases , the @xmath5 remains insensitive to increasing @xmath13 , as found theoretically ( @xcite ) and experimentally@xcite .",
    "the 10 coupled equations for @xmath33 are self - consistently solved for many values of the coupling constant @xmath52 applied to the coulomb interaction , and the @xmath53 are used in the adiabatic connection formula to determine the exchange - correlation free energy of the 2-valley 2des . while our calculations are easily carried out for any value of @xmath1 , @xmath27 and @xmath13 , the 4-component qmc calculations at finite @xmath54 are a major computational undertaking which has not been attempted . however , at @xmath55 , conti and senatore@xcite have presented qmc results for 2-d electron bilayers separated by a distance @xmath56 .",
    "they give total energies and also a fit to the correlation energy / electron , @xmath57 at @xmath58 , i.e , the case where both electron gases reside in the same layer . in table",

    "we exploit the simplicity of chnc for calculations at finite-@xmath27 and @xmath1 which are currently too expensive for qmc simulations .",
    "however , in situations where qmc results are available for the correlation energies , we adopt the qmc parametrizations .",
    "thus one may use the parametrization of @xmath63 given by conti and senatore for the @xmath55 case . for @xmath14 applications",
    "the tanatar - ceperley@xcite form may also be used for the 2-valley system as well , with the parameter values @xmath64 , fitted to a data base from @xmath13 = 1 to 30 .",
    "the @xmath65 case is particularly interesting since this system ( i.e , 2-valley system at density @xmath0 ) is mathematically identical to the 1-valley system at the same density but with @xmath3 , for the hamiltonian considered by conti et al .",
    ", and by us in this study .",
    "in this case the 2-valley system has a two - fold symmetry since the energy is the same irrespective of the orientation of the spin in each valley .",
    "that is , @xmath51 means all the spins in valley @xmath31 are oriented , while all the spins in valley @xmath23 are also oriented , but independently of the orientation of the spins in @xmath31 .",
    "this degeneracy would be resolved in real si - mosfets but not in the model used here , or in conti and senatore .",
    "for instance , the three - body correlations for inter - valley interactions may be slightly different from those in the _",
    "intra_-valley interactions , and hence may require two different bridge parameters , to be determined variationally by an energy minimization using the hard - disk reference fluid approach .",
    "we have not done this , and simply used the same bridge parameter as in ref .",
    "@xcite for all interactions . in the qmc calculation",
    "this would require independent optimization of the model for back - flow corrections .",
    "finally , the correlation energy of the fully spin - polarized ( degenerate ) 2-valley system can be parametrized using the tanatar - ceperley form with @xmath66 , in atomic units .",
    "the @xmath2 correlation energy at finite values of @xmath1 were calculated using the chnc procedure and compared with the values predicted from the polarization factor used for the one - valley 2des .",

    "many decades of experimental and theoretical work has gone into sharpening our understanding of this interface .",
    "more recently , first principles density - functional calculations by carrier et al.@xcite , starting from tight - binding models@xcite have presented a clearer picture of the atomic arrangements near the interface region .",

    "thus a reliable atomic model of the si / sio@xmath83 interface obtained via geometry optimization of the total energy is now available@xcite .",
    "the essential point is that the si / sio@xmath83 interface contains approximately 5 regions containing crystalline si ( c-@xmath200 ) , amorphized si ( a-@xmath200 ) , suboxide layers , amorphized silicon dioxide ( a-@xmath204 ) , and crystalline @xmath204 .",

    "if we are dealing with a thick electron gas , then envelope - function methods for describing the form factor may be reasonable .",
    "otherwise a more detailed atomic description involving bloch functions is needed . in any case , if the electron gas is very thin , its growth - direction density profile may be considered to be @xmath207 .",
    "that is , crystalline @xmath200 and a-@xmath200 flank the two sides of the 2-d electron layer , with a-@xmath200 playing the role of the insulator .",
    "the valence bonds of the a-@xmath200 still form a quasi - random tetrahedral network , even though distorted , and hence the `` background '' dielectric constant of a-@xmath200 is essentially that of @xmath200 that is , the effective dielectric constant : @xmath208 often used for the 2des in the mosfet positioned at an abrupt @xmath209 interface should be reconsidered .",
    "the second formula of ando et al .",
    "( see appendix of ref.@xcite ) for the conversion @xmath0 to @xmath13 , using a mean @xmath210 of 7.7 is not recommended . instead , the first formula of ref.@xcite , i.e. , @xmath211^{1/2 } \\left[\\frac{11.5}{\\epsilon_{sc}}\\right ]   \\left[\\frac{m}{0.19m_0}\\right]\\ ] ] is clearly the one consistent with the first - principles atomic structure of the @xmath209 interface referred to above@xcite . if we look at the @xmath200-mosfet literature , we find that the formula which uses the average dielectric constant of 7.7 , appropriate for the abrupt @xmath209 interface has been used by a number of authors .",
    "these authors use a value of @xmath13 increased by a factor of @xmath212 compared to what we recommend .",
    "thus pudalov et al.@xcite , and okamoto et al.@xcite have used the mean dielectric constant of 7.7 for their calculation of @xmath13 . however ,",
    "both these studies use the @xmath13 parameter mainly as a plotting variable in the figures , and not for any many - body calculations .",
    "hence a choice of @xmath13 which differs from that used in our work by a factor of @xmath1971.49 is immaterial . in the review article by kravchenko and sarachik@xcite , values of @xmath13",
    "are further modified by the experimentally obtained @xmath8 to discuss the interactions in @xmath200 mosfets .",
    "thus their @xmath213 is not used in the sense used in standard many - body theory .",
    "hawang and das sarma@xcite have also examined @xmath200-mosfet resistivities , using an impurity - scattering calculation which requires defining the effective background dielectric constant .",
    "they point out that their results are qualitative .",
    "their results would not be affected by the choice of either formula given by ref.@xcite , i.e , using @xmath210 = 7.7 or 11.5 .",
    "altshuler and maslov@xcite actually consider the implications of the suboxide layer and how this could play a significant role in the theory .",
    "however , they too point out that their effort is essentially to indicate a `` mechanism '' rather than a theory of the metal - insulator physics of @xmath200-mosfets . hence , once again , the results are too qualitative to make any difference",
    ". similarly , the results of other workers @xcite also do not discriminate sufficiently to make the choice of @xmath210 a significant issue .    another class of problems where the choice of the average dielectric constant is an issue is in calculating electric subband energies@xcite .",
    "although the eigenvalues of the kohn - sham equation are not to be considered as effective excitation energies , such an assumption is often made .",
    "the input dielectric constant ( which decides the effective @xmath13 ) enters into the exchange - correlation functions as well as the poisson potential used .",
    "most calculations are in the high density regime , and it turns out that , given the uncertainties of the quantum - well potentials and other parameters , the results can be equally well explained by a range of values of the effective dielectric constant .    this situation becomes quite different when it comes to _ quantitative _ calculations for _ low - density _ mosfets , e.g. , in the regime @xmath11 electrons/@xmath214 .",
    "our chnc calculations for @xmath8 and @xmath5 presented in ref.@xcite clearly favour the first formula , eq .",
    "[ firstformula ] of ando et al.@xcite as the correct formula .",
    "this is also the formula that is consistent with the car - parrinello optimized atomic structure of the @xmath209 interface obtained from the calculations of carrier et al.@xcite and also of pasquerello et al.@xcite ) .",
    "we believe that the problem of the correct dielectric constant at the si / sio@xmath83 interface has received little scrutiny within the 2-d electron community in the past because there was no analytic many - body theory capable of giving quantitative results for low - density electron systems .",
    "also , it is interesting to note that if the second formula of ando et al .",
    "were used instead of the first formula that we recommend , then the calculated _ total _",
    "@xmath13 is close to the @xmath179 value ( per valley , @xmath215 ) of @xmath13 calculated by the first formula .",
    "this is consistent with the calculations that we advocate , at the hartee - fock level ( i.e , at the single - electron level ) .",
    "this fact can also lead to some confusion in assessing the validity of numerical calculations .",
    "the chnc programs for electron gas calculations mentioned here and in ref .",
    "@xcite may be accessed via the internet at the address given in ref .",
    "we can derive the following conclusions from this study .",
    "the chnc method applied to a four - component electron fluid gives results in very close agreement with available diffusion monte carlo calculations , without the use of any adjustable parameters specific to the 2-valley problem .",
    "the coupled - mode approach to constructing the 2-valley properties from 1-valley data is also fully confirmed .",
    "the calculation of the spin - susceptibility enhancement @xmath186 from the second @xmath1- derivative of the spin dependent energy is found to be very sensitive to the energy difference between the polarized and unpolarized phases and to the form of the polarization dependence .",
    "nevertheless , the coupled - mode form is very successful in capturing the required physics .",
    "thus the qmc , the 2-valley chnc , and the coupled - mode approach based on the 1-valley data provide three independent methods for the study of the strongly coupled 2des in si mosfets .",
    "the three method are found to be in excellent agreement .",
    "finally , we note that the methods used in this paper can be used to study electron / hole bilayers which are separated by a physical distance @xmath56 , the present work being for @xmath58 .",
