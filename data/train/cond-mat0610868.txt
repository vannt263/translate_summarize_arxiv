    "@xcite proposed a so - called triad dynamics to model the approach of social balance @xcite .",
    "an essential ingredient in the algorithm is the reduction of frustration in the following sense .",
    "we assign a value of @xmath10 or @xmath11 to a link ( or bond ) in the all - to - all topology if it connects two individuals who are friends or enemies , respectively .",
    "we call the sign @xmath12 of a link its spin . if the product of links along the boundary of a triad is negative , the triad is called frustrated ( or imbalanced )",
    ", otherwise it is called balanced ( or unfrustrated ) .",
    "the state of the network is called balanced if all triads are balanced .",
    "the algorithm depends on a parameter @xmath13 $ ] , called propensity parameter .",
    "it determines the tendency of the system to reduce frustration via flipping a negative link to a positive one . for an all - to - all topology antal _",
    "predict a transition from an imbalanced non - absorbing stationary state for @xmath14 to a balanced absorbing state for @xmath15 . here",
    "the dynamics is motivated by social applications so that the notion of frustration from physics goes along with frustration in the psychological sense .",
    "the mathematical criterion for checking the status of frustration is the same .",
    "+ in a recent paper @xcite we generalized the triad dynamics in two aspects .",
    "the first generalization refers to a k - cycle dynamics which contains the triad dynamics for @xmath16 .",
    "here it turned out that the main difference comes from the difference of whether @xmath17 is even or odd , since the phase structure is symmetric about @xmath18 for @xmath17 even . even in the infinite - volume limit there",
    "are only absorbing states , apart from the transition point at @xmath18 .",
    "the second generalization concerned the network topology from all - to - all connections to a diluted network .",
    "we studied the phase structure as a function of the propensity @xmath0 and the dilution .",
    "as it turned out , the diluted k - cycle dynamics can be mapped on a certain satisfiability problem in computer science , the so - called @xmath17-xor - sat problem @xcite , and socially balanced states in one problem correspond to all logical constraints satisfied in the @xmath17-xor - sat problem . in both models we have phases of imbalanced non - absorbing states in the infinite - volume limit , separated by a phase transition from phases of balanced or absorbing states . in a finite volume one only observes balanced states , but as a remnant of the infinite - volume phase structure , the time to reach the absorbing states differs in a characteristic way .",
    "+ in this paper we study triad dynamics on a two - dimensional triangular lattice and @xmath19-cycle dynamics ( called tetrad dynamics ) on a square lattice . from the interpretation as an approach to social balance , triad or tetrad dynamics on a regular topology",
    "are not more realistic than on an all - to - all topology .",
    "still , triad dynamics shows interesting features in terms of a percolation transition if we compare snapshots of frozen states for different values of @xmath0 .",
    "also for tetrad dynamics we observe a transition between different absorbing states , but the description in terms of a percolation transition fails . as we shall see , due to the restrictive topology , imbalanced triads and tetrads allow only two elementary processes : either they diffuse or they annihilate each other . as a result",
    ", the system always approaches a balanced absorbing state ; nevertheless we observe a transition as a function of the propensity parameter @xmath0 , this time between different absorbing states .",
    "the difference is characterized by the presence or absence of an infinite cluster of connected unfriendly ( negative ) links and for triad dynamics by the time to reach these frozen states .",
    "the parameter @xmath0 should not be confused with the occupation probability of a single bond with a positive sign as it usually used in connection with bond percolation .",
    "therefore , here for @xmath1 we observe an infinite cluster of negative links , while such a cluster is absent for @xmath3 . for triad dynamics",
    "the time to reach the frozen state grows logarithmically with the system size for @xmath3 and as a power of the size for @xmath20 .",
    "in contrast , for tetrad dynamics it grows as a power of the system size only at the transition point , while it grows logarithmically above and below @xmath21 . for triad dynamics",
    "we numerically determine the critical exponents from a finite - size scaling analysis of the frozen patterns .",
    "we analyze the probability @xmath22 for a link to belong to the infinite cluster that serves as an order parameter as well as the order parameter susceptibility and the distribution of clusters of finite size @xmath23 .",
    "the critical exponents @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath8 , @xmath7 fulfill the usual hyperscaling relations as well as the fractal dimension @xmath9 .",
    "the critical exponents turn out to be new and completely different from those of standard percolation in two dimensions @xcite .",
    "+ the outline of the paper is the following . in section [ sec2 ]",
    "we define the triad dynamics on a triangular lattice . in section [ sec3 ]",
    "we analyze the finite - volume dependence of the frozen states as a function of the propensity parameter @xmath0 and present the results for the critical exponents as well as for the fractal dimension .",
    "section [ sec4 ] deals with tetrad dynamics on a square lattice for which the hyperscaling relations are violated . in section [ sec5 ]",
    "we summarize the conclusions .",
    "our dynamical system is defined on an undirected graph ( network ) composed of nodes and links .",
    "each link @xmath24 between the nodes @xmath25 and @xmath26 takes spin values @xmath27 or @xmath28 if the nodes @xmath25 and @xmath26 are `` enemies '' or `` friends '' , respectively . a triad",
    "[ @xmath29 @xmath30 is characterized by the values assigned to its three links @xmath24 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "we have four types of triads , depending on the number of negative links they contain in their boundary : @xmath33 and @xmath34 , where the subscript stands for the number of negative ( or `` unfriendly '' ) links .",
    "we use the standard notion of _ social balance _ as proposed in @xcite and apply this notion to triads .",
    "the sign of a triad is defined as the product of the spins assigned to the links of the triad .",
    "a triad is considered as `` balanced '' or `` unfrustrated '' if its sign is positive , otherwise it is called `` imbalanced '' or `` frustrated '' . the triads @xmath35 ( all friends ) and @xmath36 ( two friends have the same enemy )",
    "are balanced , while the triads @xmath37 and @xmath34 are imbalanced .",
    "the network itself is called balanced if and only if all triads belonging to the network are balanced .",
    "+ as in @xcite we perform a local unconstrained dynamics in order to reduce the frustration of the network .",
    "as it turns out , the local algorithm always drives the network to a fully balanced state without frustrated triads , but the time it needs for reaching the frozen state depends on the choice of parameters . at each update event one triad is selected at random . if the selected triad is balanced ( type @xmath35 or @xmath36 ) nothing happens .",
    "if the selected triad is imbalanced ( type @xmath37 or @xmath34 ) it is updated into a balanced one by flipping one of its link . in particular a triad @xmath37 is changed with probability @xmath0 into a triad @xmath35 ( flipping the only negative link of the triad @xmath37 ) , and it is changed with probability @xmath38 into a triad @xmath36 ( choosing at random one of the two positive links belonging to the triad @xmath37 and inverting the spin to a negative value ) .",
    "a triad @xmath34 is changed into a triad @xmath36 with probability @xmath39 , choosing at random one of its three negative links and reversing its spin to a positive sign .",
    "we summarize the updating rules of the local algorithm in the following scheme : @xmath40 { } \\;\\ ; \\triangle_1 \\;\\ ; \\xrightarrow[1-p ] { } \\;\\ ; \\triangle_2 \\;\\ ; \\xleftarrow[1 ] { } \\;\\ ; \\triangle_3 \\;\\;\\;. \\label{eq : triad_rules}\\ ] ] one time unit has passed when the number of single update events equals the total number of links @xmath41 of the network .",

    "the total number of links of the lattice is @xmath44 , while the total number of triads is @xmath45 . in particular",
    "each link is shared only by two nearest - neighbor triads , so that the triad dynamics can not increase the total number of imbalanced triads : a single update changes one selected imbalanced triad into a balanced one , while it modifies the other triad , sharing the same updated link , either from balanced to imbalanced [ figure [ fig : expl1]a ) ] or from imbalanced to balanced [ figure [ fig : expl1]b ) ] .",
    "the former we call diffusion , because the imbalanced triad diffuses , the latter annihilation between two imbalanced triads .        obviously , for a finite - size system we always observe a frozen configuration as the stationary state ( see figure [ fig : expl ] ) ,     +   and for different values of @xmath0 : a ) @xmath46 , b ) @xmath47 , c ) @xmath48 . in the plots only negative links are shown.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=42.0% ] +   +   and for different values of @xmath0 : a ) @xmath46 , b ) @xmath47 , c ) @xmath48 . in the plots",
