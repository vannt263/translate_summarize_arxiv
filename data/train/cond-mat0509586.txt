    "systems with magnetic moments usually order as one approaches zero temperature . however , magnetic systems that form triangle- or tetrahedron - based lattices are often able to avoid ordering until unusually low temperatures , and",
    "have been found to have interesting properties both theoretically and experimentally@xcite .",
    "such lattices are generally referred to as geometrically frustrated as , for example , antiferromagnetic interactions between spins render the systems unable to find a unique ground state from magnetic considerations alone .",
    "it has been argued@xcite that the degree of frustration of a lattice can be quantified in terms of the connectivity of its triangular units .",
    "this leads to a hierarchy of lattices increasing in frustration from the ordered edge - shared hexagonal lattice , through the corner - shared triangle kagom , garnet and @xmath3-mn lattices , to the corner - shared tetrahedral lattice ( common to the pyrochlore , cubic laves and normal spinel structures ) .",
    "as we will show , the three dimensional corner - shared equilateral triangle structure of fig . [ figure1 ] is a fascinating new addition to this hierarchy . to avoid the cumbersome use of the terminology `` three dimensional corner - shared triangle '' ( which also applies to the distorted windmill @xmath3-mn structure )",
    ", we will henceforth name this lattice the trillium lattice@xcite .",
    "the trillium lattice is a sublattice of the co ( b21 ) , nh@xmath4 ( d1 ) , nissb ( f0@xmath0 , ullmanite ) and fesi ( b20 ) structures .",
    "for example , the mn atoms of mnsi ( b20 structure ) form the trillium lattice .",

    "( 1,1,1 ) is a c@xmath4 rotation axis of the crystal ; the front right lower triangle is related to the front left top triangle by translation . in blue ( at left ) we identify the layer number that each point of the equilateral triangles shown belongs to .",
    "the separation between layers 4 and 5 is 4@xmath6 ; between 3 and 4 : ( 1 - 4@xmath7)@xmath8 and alternates . after triangles , the next smallest nearest neighbor connection has 5 sides as shown by the dashed line . ]",
    "recently pfleiderer et al @xcite reported the observation of a `` partially ordered '' magnetic state in single crystals of mnsi near and above the critical pressure of this itinerant helimagnet . in this neutron scattering measurement , the well - defined magnetic bragg peak ( @xmath90.0214 @xmath10 ) with wavevector along ( 111 ) was seen to shift to point predominantly along ( 110 ) ( with @xmath90.0304@xmath10 ) upon the application of pressure .",
    "the magnetic scattering pattern was seen to feature a sphere at fixed wavevector magnitude , with anisotropic intensities which weakly peaked along ( 110 ) .",
    "this sphere was found to onset at temperatures consistent with a continuation of the slope of @xmath11 ( where helimagnetism sets in ) .",
    "coincident with the appearance of this unusual magnetic signature an anomalous non - fermi liquid resistivity @xmath12 has been observed and found to persist up to twice the critical pressure@xcite .",
    "the lack of a rapid recovery of @xmath13 in such an apparently clean system ( @xmath14 ) poses an important challenge to our understanding of hertz - millis - moriya spin - fluctuation theory near a ferromagnetic or helimagnetic@xcite quantum critical point .",
    "magnetic susceptibility measurements have been found to exhibit high temperature curie - weiss tails@xcite with curie - weiss constants tuning continuously from weakly positive temperatures@xcite , consistent with the onset of helimagnetic order at ambient pressures , to weakly negative offsets above the critical pressure .",
    "this may be indicative of a crossover from ferro- to antiferromagnetically dominated fluctuations , although debate exists in the literature on this point@xcite .",
    "therefore , we ask whether any link might possibly be made between an enhancement of the antiferromagnetic couplings and the observed quasi - degenerate nature of the spin - spin correlations in this material at high pressures .    to begin to address this question , we need to understand the role of antiferromagnetic interactions on this lattice . here",
    "we advance a microscopic description of the physics on the magnetic lattice of mnsi .",
    "it is important to notice that the mn bonds of this lattice form a trillium lattice@xcite ( see fig .",
    "[ figure1 ] ) whose degree of geometric frustration lies on the border between previously studied frustrated systems and those known to order despite frustration inherent to their lattices .",
    "we first classify the degree of magnetic frustration of the classical heisenberg antiferromagnet on this lattice , and then use mean field theory and a mapping to a classical rigid rotor model , to explore the corresponding low energy physics .    in our model ,",
    "we have chosen only to include the localized spin degrees of freedom .",
    "for the majority of magnetic systems forming on this lattice this is clearly an oversimplification , and a more complete model for the monosilicides might be the kondo lattice model . within this",
    "model magnetic correlations which arise between neighboring localized spins are mediated by conduction electrons .",
    "the basic magnetic physics of such an rkky interaction@xcite is thought to be captured by the extended heisenberg model .",
    "this paper represents the first step toward such a treatment which will be presented in the near future@xcite and is expected to yield a rich phase diagram and potentially account for the small positive curie - weiss offset seen in mnsi near its critical pressure .    mapping the antiferromagnetic heisenberg model to a classical rotor model ,",
    "we find an ordered ground state with wavevector ( @xmath15,0,0 ) featuring @xmath16 rotated spins on each triangle .",
    "monte carlo calculations have been carried out@xcite and support this conclusion .",
    "however , the commonly used mean field approximation does not find an ordered ground state .",
    "rather , mean field theory finds a macroscopically degenerate ground state with degenerate wavevectors forming a sphere - like surface in momentum - space , reminiscent of the partially ordered state of mnsi .",
    "although the detailed anisotropy of the structure factor is not reproduced , to our knowledge this is the first model to find such a partially ordered ground state .",
    "the disagreement between monte carlo and mean field approximations is surprising in light of the excellent qualitative agreement between these methods on the kagom and pyrochlore lattices , and the reason for this disagreement is discussed .",
    "the strength of magnetic order within the rotor model and its relationship to the mean field results is presented , laying the groundwork for future finite temperature studies where monte carlo and mean field results find qualitative agreement to reasonably low temperatures@xcite .",
    "the outline of this paper follows . in section ii",
    "an overview of recent excitement in the study of geometrically frustrated materials allows us introduce the trillium lattice in its proper context . in section iii",
    "we employ the standard @xcite mean field approximation which implicitly relaxes the constraint on the spin ( @xmath17 ) at each site and calculate the neutron structure factor . in section iv we numerically impose a hard spin constraint ( @xmath18 ) at each site .",
    "we use a classical rotor model to characterize the low - lying excitations and ground state .",

    "[ figure7 ] ( a ) that , with a soft spin constraint , the mean field ground state with ( 111 ) order had 120@xmath19 rotated spins on triangles in the plane with normal vector ( 111 ) and no spin at the @xmath20 sites .",
    "all other triangles featured two opposite spins .",
    "it is instructive to add spin components normal to this plane to recover equal spins at each site .",
    "that is , to obtain a spin structure with unit magnitude spins at each site , we perform a vector summation of the mean field spin structure of fig .",
    "[ figure7 ] ( a ) and spin components orthogonal to this plane .",
    "clearly one must add a full spin to the @xmath20 site , while contributions to the @xmath21 sites must be added such that the spin components at each site square to one .",
    "on the @xmath21 sites , we assign an amplitude @xmath22 to spins of the mean field structure and an amplitude @xmath23 to the spin component perpendicular to the plane .",
    "we refer to this perpendicular component of the spins as a @xmath24 component because , despite structure within the 4-site cubic unit cell , it is unchanged from one unit cell to another .",

    "this is shown pictorially in the inset to fig .",

    "then we can write the total energy per unit spin as a function of the angle @xmath28 as , @xmath32 and to find a true minimum of this function , we simply solve for the derivative,@xmath33 which yields @xmath34 .",
    "substitution of @xmath28 in eq .",
    "[ equation27 ] yields an energy of @xmath35 .",
    "this is the same as the lowest energy solution found by the rotor model along ( 111 ) , and is the true minimal energy state with this wavevector direction .    within the mean field approximation , the lowest energy solution of eq .",
    "[ equation4 ] can be shown to be @xmath36 .",
    "the spin structure remains as presented in section iii d , with the exception of the relative angle change of the spin from one unit cell to the next ; for generic values of @xmath37 the triangles which include the @xmath20 site no longer feature parallel spins .",
    "as we have analytic expressions for our eigenvalues , it is interesting to write the general expression in the ( 111 ) direction following the same steps , @xmath38 which is plotted in fig .",
    "[ figure16 ] and agrees very well with the rotor model .",
    "note that in principle this must be done also within the mean field solution of reimers paper@xcite , in such a way as to satisfy the hard spin constraint on the pyrochlore lattice .",
    "that is , an analogous mean field solution is found along @xmath39 at @xmath40 in the pyrochlore case , but the high degeneracy of the lattice allows the addition of a @xmath24 ( ie . the same in each unit cell ) components to satisfy the hard spin constraint . relative to mean field calculations , monte carlo calculations ( which satisfy a hard spin constraint ) on the pyrochlore lattice would be expected to differ by a small factor .",
    "that this has not previously been appreciated is likely due to the high degeneracy of the pyrochlore lattice ",
    "it is not nearly as important an effect there as it is here .",
    "motivated by recent neutron scattering and spin susceptibility measurements of mnsi , we have considered the role of antiferromagnetic interactions and their possible relevance to a partially ordered state in this system . to address this issue ,",
    "we have studied a heisenberg model on the trillium lattice , a new three dimensional corner - shared triangle lattice formed by the mn atoms of mnsi .",
    "the trillium lattice is also a sublattice of other systems including the co ( b21 ) , nh@xmath4 ( d1 ) , nissb ( f0@xmath0 , ullmanite ) and fesi ( b20 ) structures .",
    "the heisenberg model is an oversimplified model for an itinerant system such as mnsi .",
    "however , this model has been used to reproduce the measured spin correlations in other itinerant systems including ( y@xmath41sc@xmath42)mn@xmath43 , liv@xmath43o@xmath44 and @xmath3-mn , where it has been considered the first step in an understanding of the magnetic correlations present . we found that a certain degree of geometric frustration does exist on the trillium lattice with a nave estimation of the number of degrees of freedom available to the ground state less than the kagom and pyrochlore lattices , but on a par with the @xmath3-mn lattice and greater than the hexagonal lattice .",
    "we have treated the classical antiferromagnetic heisenberg model on the trillium lattice within the mean field approximation and by mapping the model to a lattice of rigid rotors . within mean field theory on the trillium lattice ,",
    "this model was found to have a degenerate ground state with wavevectors found to lie around a sphere - like surface given by eq .",
    "[ equation6 ] . at small but finite temperatures , the neutron scattering structure factor",
    "would then be expected to feature weight predominantly confined to lie on this surface . along this sphere - like surface ,",
    "a disperse weight modulation would arise solely from geometrical factors and be roughly independent of temperature as found of the `` bow - ties '' of the corner - shared tetrahedral lattice .",
    "measurements normal to these sphere - like shells would show resolution limited sharp peaks as the temperature decreased as shown in fig .",
    "[ figure6 ] .",
    "these features bear a strong qualitative resemblance to neutron scattering measurements near the critical pressure of the itinerant helimagnet , mnsi , although notable differences are present .",
    "chief among these are the radius of the observed sphere - like shape , which is smaller by a factor of 10 , and the detailed nature of the pattern seen .",
    "more precisely , the measurements@xcite appear to have been made with respect to the lattice bragg peaks at ( @xmath15,@xmath15,0 ) . about this point",
    "there is no reason to expect an inversion symmetry of the structure factor and the c@xmath4 symmetry of the lattice which is responsible for the vanishing of weight along ( 111 ) shown in fig .",
    "[ figure5 ] would not be present .    by mapping the classical antiferromagnetic heisenberg model to a rigid rotor description with a spin of unit magnitude at each site of the trillium lattice",
    ", we have found an ordered ground state at wavevector@xcite ( @xmath45 ) featuring 120@xmath19 rotated spins on each triangle .",
    "the rotor model is a real space construction which imposes periodic boundary conditions on finite size clusters of three dimensional vectors representing the spin at each site of the lattice . for several small cluster sizes ( see table [ table iv ] )",
    ", we have found the minimal energy state to be consistent with order along ( 100 ) as analytically described in table [ table v ] , indicating that low - lying longitudinal fluctuations from the ground state are quite soft .",
    "we have designed an extension of the rotor model in such a way as to allow only one particular wavevector direction at a time .",
    "that is , rather than studying an @xmath46 lattice , where @xmath47 are integers counting the number of cubic unit cells in each direction , we have used symmetry to map the lattice to a one dimensional lattice of unit cells .",
    "for example , to investigate spiral order along ( 111 ) , unit cells at @xmath48 are all identical and can be replaced in the mapping by a single unit cell . despite the strength of ( 100 ) order",
    ", this allows us access to low - lying energetic saddle - points . in table [ table iii ]",
    "we have shown that the wavevector associated to these saddle - points continues to lie close to solutions of eq .",
    "[ equation6 ] .",
    "an analytic derivation of the wavevector and spin structure at the saddle - point along ( 111 ) has been developed in section iii d which illustrates the relationship between mean field and rotor model results .",
    "the discrepancy between the results obtained via the mean field approximation and those obtained by the mapping to the rotor model arises from the use of soft and hard spin constraints in the respective approximations .",
    "the soft spin constraint allows the magnitude of the spin to vary within the unit cell as illustrated by the `` spin '' structures of section iii d. for itinerant magnetic systems , it is not unusual for the magnetization density to vary spatially within an effective magnetic model .",
    "the hard spin constraint of the rotor model sets the magnitude of the spin at each site to be 1 .",
    "it is interesting to note that problems associated with the soft spin constraint of the mean field approximation arise in earlier treatments of frustrated lattices , yet do not seem to have been commented on .",
    "this is due , in part , to the extensive ground state degeneracy of these systems .",
    "for example , on the corner - shared tetrahedral lattice ( a sublattice of the pyrochlore structure ) , the mean field approximation yields@xcite a doubly degenerate flat band with a three band degeneracy at @xmath24 . even though the coplanar mean field ground state spin structure along ( 111 )",
    "does not satisfy a unit spin magnitude ( @xmath18 ) at one of the four sites on each tetrahedron , it is possible to add spin components ( with @xmath24 ) to every site to recover this constraint . in this way , one finds a spin structure which belongs to the ground state and has components of its spins which rotate along ( 111 ) .",
    "calculations of the neutron scattering structure factor@xcite within the mean field approximation make the implicit assumption that the entire spin rotates . that along certain wavevector directions only a component of the spin is rotating must imply that the detailed nature of the relative neutron scattering weight is not fully captured within the mean field approximation , despite the remarkable qualitative agreement seen with monte carlo results .",
    "discrepancies between the soft and hard spin constraints are simply more clearly evident on the trillium lattice , as satisfying the hard spin constraint lifts the degeneracy of the ground state .",
    "the advantage of the mean field approximation is that it allows one to access all wavevectors and easily generalizes to finite temperatures .",
    "indeed , at temperatures @xmath49 one sees , from the rotor model ( see table [ table iii ] ) , that all wavevector orientations should become accessible to the system .",
    "one might hope at such temperatures to recapture many of the qualitative features of the mean field description .",
    "a finite temperature comparison between the mean field approximation and monte carlo results will be presented in the near future@xcite .",
    "future work@xcite will treat the extended heisenberg model which is expected to exhibit a rich phase diagram , possibly relevant to currently available magnetic monosilicides .    it is worthwhile to mention the possibility of frustrated ferromagnetically coupled spin systems forming on this lattice .",
    "indeed , on the pyrochlore lattice there are arguably more candidates for spin - ice physics than for degenerate antiferromagnetic ground states .",
    "as we will show in future work@xcite , if ising spins are restricted to lie along the local ( 111 ) axes of the crystal ( this is the direction of the closest non - magnetic atoms in some of the ullmanites and may arise due to crystal / ligand field splittings ) , then antiferromagnetically coupled spins will be expected to order while ferromagnetically coupled spins will be extensively degenerate possessing a generalized version of the two - spins out , two spins in rule of the corner - shared tetrahedral lattice .",
