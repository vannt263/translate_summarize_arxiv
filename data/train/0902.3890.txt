    "one of the main problems of quantum mechanics deals with the possibility of measuring together the position and momentum distributions @xmath0 and @xmath1 of a quantum system prepared in a state @xmath2 .",
    "the basic structures of quantum mechanics dictate that there is no ( joint ) measurement which would directly give both the position and momentum distributions and that , for instance , any determination of the position distribution @xmath0 necessarily disturbs the system such that the initial momentum distribution @xmath1 gets drastically changed .    in recent years",
    "two important steps have been taken in solving this problem .",
    "first of all , the original ideas of heisenberg @xcite have finally been brought to a successful end with the seminal paper of werner @xcite which gives operationally feasible necessary and sufficient conditions for a measurement to serve as an approximate joint measurement of the position and momentum distributions , including also the inaccuracy - disturbance aspect of the problem . the second breakthrough in studying",
    "this question comes from a reconstruction of the state @xmath2 from a single informationally complete measurement , notably realized optically by an eight - port homydyne detection @xcite , @xcite ( for a rigorous quantum mechanical treatment , see @xcite ) . in conjunction with an explicit state reconstruction formula ( known at least for the husimi - distribution @xcite )",
    ", this allows one to immediately determine the distributions of any given observables .",
    "if one is only interested in determining the position and momentum distributions @xmath0 and @xmath1 , it is obviously unnecessary to reconstruct the entire state ; one should be able to do this with less information . here",
    "we will use the statistical method of moments to achieve a scheme for position and momentum tomography , i.e. the reconstruction of the position and momentum distributions from the measured statistics .",
    "the price for using moments is , of course , that they do not exist for all states , and even when they do , they typically do not determine the distribution uniquely .",
    "hence , we restrict here to the states for which the position and momentum distributions are exponentially bounded .",
    "we note that this is an operational condition and can , in principle , be tested for a given moment sequence @xcite .",
    "we consider three different , though related , measurement schemes based on the von neumann model , sect",
    ".  [ vnmodel ] , and the balanced homodyne detection technic , sect .",
    "[ homodyne ] .",
    "the first model is a sequential measurement of a standard position measurement of the von neumann type @xcite followed by any momentum measurement , sect .",
    "[ sequential ] .",
    "the second ( sect .  [ akb ] ) builds on the arthurs - kelly model @xcite as developed further by busch @xcite whereas the third ( sect .  [ homodyne ] )",
    "model uses the quantum optical realizations of position and momentum as the corresponding quadrature observables of a ( single mode ) signal field implemented by balanced homodyne detection @xcite . in sect .",
    "[ simultaneous ] we apply the method of moments to determine both the position and momentum distributions @xmath0 and @xmath1 from the actually measured statistics .",
    "finally , we compare our method with the state reconstuction method , sect .",
    "there we also comment briefly the possibility of inverting convolutions .",
    "we begin , however , with quoting the basic no - go results on the position - momentum joint / sequential measurements .",
    "there are many formulations of the basic fact that position and momentum of a quantum object can not be measured jointly , or , equivalently , that , say , any position measurement ` destroys ' all the information on the momentum prior to the measurement . in this section",
    "we recall one of the most striking formulations of this fact . to do that we fix first some notations .",
    "let @xmath3 be a complex separable hilbert space and @xmath4 the set of bounded operators on @xmath3 .",
    "let @xmath5 be a nonempty set and @xmath6 a @xmath7-algebra of subsets of @xmath5 .",
    "the set function @xmath8 is a _",
    "semispectral measure _ , or normalized positive operator measure , pom , for short , if the set function @xmath9 is a probability measure for each @xmath10 , the set of unit vectors of @xmath3 .",
    "we denote this probability measure by @xmath11 .",
    "a semispectral measure @xmath12 is a spectral measure if it is projection valued , that is , all the operators @xmath13 , are projections . if @xmath3 is the hilbert space of a quantum system , then the observables of the system are represented by semispectral measures @xmath12 and the numbers @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , are the measurement outcome probabilities for @xmath12 in a vector state @xmath17 .",
    "an observable is called sharp if it is represented by a spectral measure .",
    "otherwise , we call it unsharp . here",
    "we consider only the cases where the measurement outcomes are real numbers , that is , @xmath18 is the real borel space @xmath19 , or , pairs of real numbers , in which case @xmath18 is @xmath20 .",
    "the position and momentum distributions @xmath0 and @xmath1 are just the probability measures @xmath21 and @xmath22 defined by @xmath23 and @xmath24 together with a density matrix ( mixed state ) @xmath2 .",
    "an observable @xmath25 has two marginal observables @xmath26 and @xmath27 defined by the conditions @xmath28 and @xmath29 for all @xmath30 .",
    "any measurement of @xmath31 constitutes a joint measurement of @xmath26 and @xmath27 . on the other hand ,",
    "any two observables @xmath32 and @xmath33 admit a joint measurement ( or equivalently a sequential joint measurement ) if there is an observable ( on the product value space ) @xmath25 such that @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "the following result is crucial :    [ apu3 ] let @xmath25 be a semispectral measure , such that one of the marginals is a spectral measure .",
    "then , for any @xmath36 , @xmath37 , that is , the marginals commute with each other , and @xmath38 , that is , @xmath31 is of the product form .",
    "assume that @xmath25 is an observable with , say , the first marginal observable @xmath26 being the position of the object .",
    "then @xmath26 and @xmath27 commute with each other , and due to the maximality of the position observable @xmath23 any @xmath39 is a function of @xmath23 .",
    "therefore , @xmath27 can not represent ( any nontrivial version of ) the momentum observable .",
    "similarly , if one of the marginal observables is the momentum observable , then the two marginal observables are pairwisely commutative , and the effects of the other marginal observable are functions of the momentum observable .",
    "it is a basic result of the quantum theory of measurement that each observable ( sharp or unharp ) admits a realization in terms of a measurement scheme , that is , each observable has a measurement dilation @xcite . in particular",
    ", this is true for the position and momentum observables @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "however , due to the continuity of these observables they do not admit any repeatable measurements @xcite .",
    "in fact , the known realistic models for position and momentum measurements serve only as their approximative measurements which constitute @xmath23 and @xmath24 -measurements only in some appropriate limits . here",

    "this is also an example of the variance free observables as discussed in @xcite .",

    "let @xmath65 be the unitary measurement coupling , with a coupling constant @xmath66 , @xmath67 , @xmath68 , the initial probe state , and let @xmath69 denote the embedding @xmath70 .",
    "the actually measured observable of the object system is then given by measurement dilation formula @xmath71 a direct computation shows that @xmath12 is an unsharp position , with the effects @xmath72 where @xmath73 denotes the convolution of the characteristic function @xmath74 of the set @xmath75 with the probability density @xmath76 .",
    "the actually measured observable @xmath12 depends on two parameters : the coupling constant @xmath77 and the initial probe state @xmath78 , that is , @xmath79 .",
    "the structure of the effects ( [ sumeapaikka ] ) suggests that the semispectral measure @xmath12 comes close to the spectral measure @xmath23 whenever the convolution @xmath73 comes close to @xmath74 .",
    "this evident fact can be quantified in various ways .    due to the convolution structure of @xmath12 , the geometric distance between the observables @xmath12 and @xmath23",

    "it follows from the definition of the geometric distance , that @xmath82 implies @xmath83 .",

    "but , again , the precise meaning of the limit @xmath93 in either of the cases @xmath94 or @xmath95 waits to be qualified .",

    "furthermore , since the linear combinations of hermite functions are dense in @xmath291 , their associated distributions @xmath286 and @xmath287 suffice to determine the whole position and momentum observables @xmath23 and @xmath24 as spectral measures .",
    "we have shown with three different measurement models that the statistical method of moments allows one to determine with a single measurement scheme both the position and momentum distributions @xmath286 and @xmath287 from the actually measured statistics for a large class of initial states @xmath2 . in each case",
    "the actually measured observable is a covariant phase space observable @xmath273 whose generating operator @xmath255 depends on the used measurement scheme . such an observable is known to be informationally complete if the operator @xmath255 satisfies the condition @xmath292\\neq 0 $ ] for almost all @xmath293@xcite .",
    "recently it has been shown that this condition is also necessary for the informational completeness of @xmath273 @xcite .",

    "however , the reconstruction of the state from such a statistics is typically a highly difficult task , see e.g. @xcite . in the special case of the generating operator @xmath255 being the gaussian ( vacuum ) state @xmath297",
    ", the distribution @xmath298 $ ] is the husimi distribution of the state @xmath2 .",
    "for that , a reconstruction formula is well known and simple @xcite .",

    "the marginal information , which is used in the method of moments , is clearly not enough to reconstruct the state even in the case where the position and momentum distributions are exponentially bounded . to illustrate this fact ,",
    "let us consider the functions @xmath306 , with @xmath307 , @xmath308 .",
    "the fourier transform of @xmath309 is @xmath310 and the position and momentum distributions are @xmath311 which are clearly exponentially bounded . for @xmath312",

    "the marginal probabilities are @xmath317 for all @xmath30 , with @xmath318 , so the marginal distributions are equal .",
    "it follows that the state can not be uniquely determined from the marginal information only .    since the marginal observables @xmath319 and @xmath320 are of the convolution form with densities , the position and momentum distributions can also be obtained if one is able to invert the convolution",
    "indeed , for any initial state @xmath122 the marginal distributions @xmath321 and @xmath322 have the densities @xmath323 and @xmath324 , where @xmath279 , @xmath280 , with @xmath325 , and @xmath326 , @xmath327 .",
    "the unknown distributions @xmath121 and @xmath328 can be solved from the measured distributions @xmath323 and @xmath324 by using either the fourier inversion or the differential inversion method . like the method of moments , these methods have their own specific restrictions .",
    "in fact , by the fourier theory , one has , for instance , @xmath329 , so that @xmath330 , provided that @xmath331 is pointwise nonzero . if @xmath332 is an @xmath333-function , then the function @xmath334 coincides with the distribution @xmath121 ( almost everywhere ) .",
    "obviously , this puts strong restrictions on the actually measured distribution @xmath323 as well as on the ` detector ' density @xmath335 .",
    "the method of differential inversion is known to be applicable whenever the detector densities @xmath276 and @xmath277 have finite moments @xcite . in the special case of @xmath336 so that @xmath276 and @xmath277 are the gaussian @xmath337 , one has @xmath338 provided that the right hand sides exist @xcite , which is a further condition on the initial state @xmath2 .    to conclude , the statistical method of moments provides an operationally feasible method to measure with a single measurement scheme both the position and momentum distributions @xmath121 and @xmath328 for a large class of initial states @xmath2 , the relevant condition being the exponential boundedness of the involved distributions .",
    "this method requires neither the state reconstruction nor inverting convolutions .",
    "if @xmath260 is a projection in the range of @xmath31 , then @xmath260 commutes with any effect @xmath339 , @xmath340 ( see , for instance , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* th . 1.3.1 , p. 91 ) ) .",
    "therefore , the marginals @xmath26 and @xmath27 are mutually commutative , i.e. @xmath341 for all @xmath36 , and the map @xmath342 is a positive operator bimeasure , and extends uniquely to a semispectral measure @xmath343 , with @xmath344 for all @xmath36 ( see , e.g. , theorem 1.10 , p. 24",
    ", of @xcite ) .",
    "let @xmath36 . since @xmath345 and @xmath39 commute and one of them is a projection , we have @xmath346 , the greates",

    "* corollary 2.3 ) .",
    "since also @xmath347 is a lower bound for @xmath345 and @xmath39 , we obtain @xmath348 .",

    "this shows that @xmath359 .",
    "similarly , we verify the corresponding statement involving decreasing sequences , and thereby conclude that @xmath354 is a monotone class . ]",
    "since @xmath360 , and @xmath351 is an algebra which generates the @xmath7-algebra @xmath361 , it follows from the monotone class theorem that @xmath349 for all @xmath340 .",

    "since @xmath362 and @xmath363 are probability measures , we get @xmath364 implying that @xmath365 . since @xmath366 was arbitrary , this implies @xmath367 .",
