    "recently , the study of collective flow in nuclear collisions at high energies has attracted increased attention of both theoreticians and experimentalists  @xcite .",
    "there are several reasons for this : i ) the observation of anisotropic flow at the ags  @xcite and at the sps  @xcite , ii ) progress in the theoretical understanding of the relation between the appearance and development of flow during the collision evolution , and processes such as thermalization , creation of the quark - gluon plasma , phase transitions , etc .",
    "@xcite , iii ) the study of mean field effects  @xcite , iv ) the importance of flow for other measurements such as identical and non - identical two - particle correlation analyses  @xcite , v ) the development of new techniques suitable for flow studies at high energies  @xcite .",
    "although all forms of flow are interrelated and represent only different parts of one global picture , usually people discuss different forms of collective flow , such as longitudinal expansion , radial transverse flow , and anisotropic transverse flow of which the most well established are directed flow and elliptic  @xcite flow  @xcite .",
    "the study of flow in ultrarelativistic nuclear collisions has just begun and it is very important to define the subject and establish the terminology . at high energies",
    "the longitudinal flow is well decoupled from transverse flow .",
    "the flow ( polar ) angles observed at low energies are relatively large and a rotation of the coordinate system was done in order to analyze the event shape in the plane perpendicular to the main axis of the flow ellipsoid . at high energies",
    "the flow angles become very small , @xmath0 , so that not doing such a rotation `` induces '' an elliptic anisotropy of the order of the square of the flow angle and usually can be neglected .",
    "this means that at high energies one does not have to rotate to the flow axis to study the flow pattern  @xcite , but one can use the plane transverse to the beam axis .",
    "thus we discuss only anisotropic transverse flow from the particle azimuthal distributions at fixed rapidity or pseudorapidity .",
    "it appears very convenient to describe the azimuthal distributions by means of a fourier expansion  @xcite , and below we characterize different kinds of anisotropies as corresponding to different harmonics ( in analogy / contrast to the description at low energies , where the three - dimensional event shape is characterized using multipole terminology ) .",
    "anisotropic flow corresponding to the first two harmonics plays a very important role and we use special terms for them : directed and elliptic flow , respectively .",
    "the word `` directed '' comes from the fact that such flow has a direction , and the word `` elliptic '' is due to the fact that in polar coordinates the azimuthal distribution with non zero second harmonic represents an ellipse .",
    "* strategy*. in this section we summarize an approach to the study of anisotropic flow which is particularly suitable at high ( ags / sps / rhic ) energies .",
    "it uses the fourier expansion of azimuthal distributions , introduced in this way for the analysis in ref .",
    "the essence of the method is to first estimate the reaction plane .",
    "the estimated reaction plane we call the event plane .",
    "the fourier coefficients in the expansion of the azimuthal distribution of particles with respect to this event plane are evaluated .",
    "because the finite number of detected particles produces limited resolution in the angle of the measured event plane , these coefficients must be corrected up to what they would be relative to the real reaction plane .",
    "this is done by dividing the observed coefficients by the event plane resolution , which is estimated from the correlation of the planes of independent sub - events  @xcite ( sub - groups of the particles used for the event plane determination ) .",
    "the resolution obtained from the sub - events can be converted to that for the full event by means of the multiplicity dependence of the resolution which will be described below .",
    "also , if the detector does not have full azimuthal acceptance , the acceptance bias has to be removed .",
    "* fourier expansion*. the quantity under study in the most general case is the triple differential distribution . in this",
    ", the dependence on the particle emission azimuthal angle measured with respect to the reaction plane can be written in a form of fourier series e = ( 1 + _",
    "n=1 ^ 2 v_n ( n(-_r ) ) ) , [ ed3 t ] where @xmath1 denotes the ( true ) reaction plane angle , and the sine terms vanish due to the reflection symmetry with respect to the reaction plane .",
    "the main advantage of the fourier method is that the fourier coefficients , evaluated using observed event planes , can be corrected for the event plane resolution caused by the finite multiplicity of the events .",
    "this correction always raises the value of the coefficients .",
    "the great importance of this is that then the results for particles in a certain phase space region may be compared directly to theoretical predictions , or to simulations unfiltered for the detector acceptance , and for which the reaction plane has been taken to be the plane containing the theoretical impact parameter .",
    "note the factor of `` 2 '' in front of each @xmath2 coefficient .",
    "we propose to use it because in this case the meaning of the coefficients @xmath2 becomes transparent  @xcite , @xmath3 , where @xmath4 indicates an average over all particles in all events .",
    "for the particle number distribution , the coefficient @xmath5 is @xmath6 and @xmath7 is @xmath8 .",
    "* estimation of the reaction plane*. the method uses the anisotropic flow itself to determine the event plane .",
    "it also means that the event plane can be determined independently for each harmonic of the anisotropic flow .",
    "the event flow vector @xmath9 and the event plane angle @xmath10 from the @xmath11th harmonic of the distribution are defined by the equations q_n ( n_n ) & = & x_n= _",
    "i w_i ( n_i ) , [ x ] + q_n ( n_n ) & = & y_n= _ i w_i ( n_i ) , [ y ] or _",
    "n = ( ^-1 ) / n. [ arctan ] the sums go over the @xmath12 particles used in the event plane determination and the @xmath13 are weights . in general",
    "the weights are also optimized to make the reaction plane resolution the best that is possible .",
    "sometimes it can be done by selecting the particles of one particular type , or weighting with transverse momentum of the particles , etc .",
    "usually the weights for the odd and even harmonic planes are different .",
    "optimal weights are discussed in footnote 2 of  @xcite . for symmetric collisions",
    "reflection symmetry says that particle distributions in the backward hemisphere of the center of mass should be the same as in the forward hemisphere if the azimuthal angles of all particles are shifted by @xmath14 .",
    "this explains why for the odd harmonics the signs of the weights are reversed in the backward hemisphere while for the even harmonics the signs of the weights are not reversed .",
    "note that the event plane angle @xmath10 determined from the @xmath11th harmonic is in the range @xmath15 . for the case of @xmath16 , eqs .",
    "( [ x],[y],[arctan ] ) are equivalent to obtaining @xmath17 for number flow from@xcite = [ eqv ] where the sum is over all the particles .",
    "the case of @xmath18 is equivalent to the event plane determined from the transverse sphericity matrix  @xcite .",
    "* acceptance correlations*. biases due to the finite acceptance of the detector which cause the particles to be azimuthally anisotropic in the laboratory system can be removed by making the distribution of event planes isotropic in the laboratory .",
    "we know of several different methods to remove the effects of anisotropy which have been used ( sometimes in a combination with each other ) .",
    "each of them has some advantages along with disadvantages .",
    "the simplest one is to re - center  @xcite the distributions @xmath19 ( eqs .",
    "[ x],[y ] ) by subtracting the @xmath19 values averaged over all events .",
    "the main disadvantage of this method is that it does not remove higher harmonics from the resulting distribution of @xmath10 .",
    "if such harmonics are present then the method requires additional flattening of the event plane distribution by one of the other methods .",
    "the second , one of the most commonly used methods , is to use the distribution of the particles themselves as a measure of the acceptance  @xcite .",
    "one accumulates the laboratory azimuthal distribution of the particles for all events and uses the inverse of this as weights in the above calculation of the event planes .",
    "the limitation of this approach is that it does not take into account the multiplicity fluctuations around the mean value .",
    "the third method is to use mixed events  @xcite .",
    "correlations with the raw event planes are stored in histograms and correlations with event planes from previous events are also stored .",
    "the real correlations are then divided by the mixed event correlations to remove the acceptance correlations .",
    "this third method suffers from the problem that , if one uses only one mixed event for each real event , the errors are @xmath20 larger .",
    "if one uses many mixed events for each real event , the errors decrease as @xmath21 instead of @xmath22 because the same events are being used @xmath23 times  @xcite . the fourth method fits the unweighted laboratory distribution of the event planes , summed over all events , to a fourier expansion and devises an event - by - event shifting of the planes needed to make the final distribution isotropic  @xcite for @xmath24 . ] . in all these methods",
    "one has to check that the event plane distributions indeed become isotropic .",
    "* particle distributions with respect to the event plane*. the next step is to study the particle distributions with respect to the event planes .",
    "note that for a given @xmath25 the corresponding fourier coefficient @xmath2 can be evaluated using the reaction planes determined from any harmonic @xmath26 , with @xmath27 , if @xmath25 is a multiple of @xmath26 . if @xmath28 , the sign of @xmath2 is determined relative to @xmath29 .",
    "that is , the first harmonic plane can be used , in principle , to evaluate all @xmath2 .",
    "the second harmonic plane can be used to evaluate @xmath7 , @xmath30 , etc . for the event plane evaluated from the @xmath26-th harmonic the fourier expansion",

    "the quantity @xmath34 is a weight which could be @xmath35 of the particle if one studies transverse momentum flow , or just unity , if one studies flow of the number of particles .",
    "the coefficients @xmath36 are evaluated by @xmath37 .",
    "the quantity @xmath38 has a lowest order periodicity of @xmath39 . to graph",
    "the distribution one can shift the negative values to positive by adding @xmath40 , and then fold the distribution with this periodicity using the module function . when a particle has been used in the calculation of an event plane , the auto - correlation effect in its distribution with respect to this plane",
    "is removed by recalculating that plane without this particle  @xcite .",
    "this is easily done if one saves the sums of sines and cosines from eqs .",
    "( [ x]-[arctan ] ) , and subtracts the contribution of the particle and its weight from these sums .",
    "this method of removing autocorrelations assumes that contributions from conservation of momentum are small .    *",
    "the event plane resolution*. the coefficients in the fourier expansion of the azimuthal distributions with respect to the _ real _ reaction plane are then evaluated by dividing by the event plane resolution  @xcite , v_n = v_n^obs/(k m ( _ m-_r ) .",
    "the mean cosine values are less than one and thus this correction always increases the flow coefficients .",
    "the resolution depends both on the harmonic used to determine the event plane @xmath26 and the order of the calculated coefficient @xmath25 .",
    "it is generally true that better accuracy for the determination of @xmath2 is achieved by using the event plane ( @xmath10 ) determined from the same harmonic ( @xmath41 , @xmath42 ) because the resolution deteriorates as @xmath43 increases ( see below ) .",
    "for example , better accuracy for @xmath7 can be achieved using @xmath44 even when the elliptic flow is somewhat weaker than the directed flow .    to calculate the resolution we start with the distribution of @xmath45 , which can be written as  @xcite = ( - ) .",

    "this resolution function is plotted in fig . 1 .",
    "note that @xmath53 is a correction for the reconstruction of the signal if the event plane is derived using the flow of the same harmonic ( @xmath42 ) . in the case when the harmonic orders do not coincide , for example , when one uses the event plane derived from the first harmonic ( directed flow ) and studies the second harmonic ( elliptic flow ) of the particle distribution with respect to this plane ( the @xmath54 term in eq .",
    "( [ vn ] ) ) the correction would be @xmath55 . for practical use",
    "all such functions can be calculated numerically as in the section on _ approximations _ below .",
    "the resolution correction used in earlier times at the bevalac  @xcite is close to the present curve for values of @xmath56 greater than about 1.5 , which was generally true at the bevalac .",
    "however , using the old procedure at the higher beam energies of the ags or sps would greatly overestimate the resolution and make the flow values too small .    *",
    "the correlation between flow angles of independent sets of particles*. if one constructs the event planes in two different windows , ( a ) and ( b ) , or from two random sub - events , the corresponding correlation function also can be written analytically .",
    "but more important in this case is the simple relation for such correlations , ( n(_n^a-_n^b ) ) = ( n(_n^a-_r ) ) ( n(_n^b-_r ) ) .",
    "[ sub - corr ] here , the assumption is made that there are no other correlations except the ones due to flow , or that such other correlations can be neglected .",

    "see the section below on _ non - flow correlations_.    note that the correlation of two planes ( the distribution in @xmath58 ) is _ not _ well represented by a fourier expansion . for a strong correlation",
    "it should be gaussian .",
    "for no flow the correlation between two random planes of the same order should be a triangular distribution . for plotting purposes",
    ", if one takes the absolute value of @xmath59 and folds this distribution about the angle @xmath60 , the triangle becomes flat .",
    "this does not affect the @xmath61 value needed for eq .",
    "[ sub - corr ] , but makes it easier to see a real flow effect by the non - flatness of the distribution in the graph .",
    "for the correlation between angles determined from two sub - events of different harmonics one can write similar relations .",

    "[ f1 ] are linear , this reduces to ( n(_m-_r ) ) = ( n(_m^a-_r ) ) .",
    "if the sub - events are not `` equal '' , or if one has only correlations between particles in different windows , and the resolution in each window can be different , then one needs at least three windows to determine the event plane resolution in each of them . in this case , for example , the resolution in the first window is determined as  @xcite ( n(_m^a-_r ) ) = .    * approximations*. we want to discuss two limits . in a case of weak flow , @xmath69 ( @xmath70 , which also means that the event plane resolution is low )",

    "the interpolation formulae are valid for @xmath80 .    in order to use the above equations to go from the sub - event resolution to the full - event resolution ,",

    "our routines for finding the roots of these equations use an iterative method , and the routines for propagating the errors involve a calculation for the change in the result with a small finite change in the input .",

    "this fraction , and therefore the equation , is only accurate when @xmath81 is small .",
    "here we study the anisotropies in the azimuthal distributions of particles within a relatively large rapidity ( pseudorapidity ) window without determining an event plane .",

    "the methods described so far in this paper are correct when correlations induced by flow dominate all others . by all others we mean correlations due to momentum conservation  @xcite , long and short range two- and many - particle correlations ( due to quantum statistics , resonances , mini and real jet production , etc . ) .",

    "one can think of these vectors as the total transverse momentum of all particles of the sub - event ( which is the case if the transverse momentum is used as a weight in eq.([eqv ] ) ) . then if there are no other correlations except flow ^a ^b = ^a ^b = q_x^aq_x^b , the very relation our first method is based on .",

    "they produce mostly a change in @xmath46 , the `` gaussian width '' of the distribution ( eq.([sigma ] ) ) , which is modified to ^2= ( 1 + 2c ) , and the parameter @xmath99 can be directly extracted from the data .",

    "another possible consequence of non - flow contributions could be the change in the shape of the distribution of the difference of flow angles of sub - events  @xcite .",
    "sometimes in order to investigate different detector effects or the reliability of the method , one needs to introduce anisotropic flow into a monte - carlo event generator .",

    "such shadowing could affect pion higher harmonic azimuthal distributions , and affect them differently at different rapidities .",
    "another effect is the transition from out - of - plane elliptic flow ( squeeze - out ) which is very important at low energies to in - plane elliptic flow which is the main effect at high energies . at the transition beam energy",
    "both effects may be important and the fourth harmonic may peak at this energy . even at high beam energies",
    ", the out - of - plane squeeze - out effect could dominate at short times and the in - plane expansion at long times , leading to an overall fourth order harmonic coefficient .",
    "* transverse radial and anisotropic flow .",
    "* we would like also to emphasize that the above methods permit the reconstruction of the triple differential distribution with respect to the reaction plane , and in particular are convenient for the analysis of the @xmath35 dependence of the anisotropy .",
    "the importance of such a study was stressed in  @xcite , where the effect of the interplay of ( transverse ) radial and directed flow has been studied . in that analysis transverse",
    "directed flow is considered a result of the movement of an effective source in the transverse plane .",
    "it is assumed that in the source rest frame the first moment of the azimuthal distribution ( @xmath5 ) is zero , and the final anisotropy appears only as a consequence of the source movement in the transverse direction .    in this case the transverse momentum dependence of @xmath5 has a rather specific shape . the radial expansion results in decreasing @xmath5 at low @xmath35 .",
    "for some sets of parameters ( temperature , radial and directed velocities ) it becomes negative .",
    "physically it corresponds to the case , when particle production with such a value of @xmath35 is more probable from the part of the effective source which moves in the opposite direction from the flow direction , because in this case the directed flow and the radial flow tend to compensate each other .",
    "the same considerations can be applied to elliptic flow as well . if one assumes that elliptic flow is a consequence of more rapid expansion of the effective source in some plane , then the @xmath35 dependence of @xmath7 would exhibit exactly the same features as has been observed for @xmath5 in the case of directed flow",
    ".    * pair - wise azimuthal correlations . *",
    "two - particle large - angle azimuthal correlations are often proposed as a tool to study anisotropic flow  @xcite . not rejecting this possibility we note that the expected signal in such correlations can be very small in magnitude .",
    "it can be easily shown that the pair - wise distribution in the azimuthal angle difference ( @xmath108 ) is ( 1 + _ n=1 ^ 2 v_n^2 ( n ) ) .",
    "note that the `` signal '' is @xmath109 , and thus is small .",
    "it does not imply though , that the `` signal to noise ratio '' is small , and the method , in principle , can be successfully applied to data to obtain the flow signal .",
    "however the reconstruction of the triple differential distribution with respect to the reaction plane ( the goal of the flow analysis ) becomes more involved .",
    "this method does not require the determination of the event plane .",
    "usually such a distribution is constructed using all possible pair combinations in each event .",
    "note that in this case each particle enters into many pairs ( on the order of the mean multiplicity of an event ) and , consequently , the pairs are not statistically independent .",
    "thus special precautions have to be taken for the evaluation of the error of the results  @xcite .",
