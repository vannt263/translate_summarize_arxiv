    ", we consider the beautiful llewellyn - radhakrishnan proof of shearer s lemma ( see @xcite ) .",

    "given a set @xmath69 and a family @xmath25)$ ] , such that the inequality ( [ eq : uc - finite - extended ] ) is almost tight for @xmath3 and @xmath20 , we first deduce that , in a sense , @xmath3 is ` close ' to a ` product structure ' ; that is , the uniform distribution on @xmath3 is ` close ' to the product of its marginals ( the relevant notion of distance is discussed below ) .",
    "that part of the argument is a fairly straightforward deduction from the entropy proof of llewellyn - radhakrishnan , or alternatively from the entropy inequalities proved by balister and bollobs in @xcite .",
    "( it is also inspired by the proof of the parallel repetition theorem in @xcite , and related works such as @xcite . )",
    "although information theory allows us to easily identify a product structure , it moves us from the language of sets to the language of distributions .",
    "the next ingredient of the proof is more combinatorial .",
    "its purpose is to move back from the language of distributions to the language of sets ; we identify the actual box that we claim exists .",
    "it turns out that for this part of the proof , a ` two - dimensional lemma ' suffices .",
    "given a set @xmath70 , such that the uniform distribution on @xmath3 is ` close ' to the product of its marginals , we find a two - dimensional box ( a ` rectangle ' ) @xmath71 , which is a good approximation of the set @xmath3 . to prove this lemma , we need to identify the two sets @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",
    "this is done via an iterative ` trimming ' procedure , which gradually removes parts of @xmath74 and @xmath75 , until only @xmath76 and @xmath77 remain .",
    "the crux of the proof is in showing that we did not throw too much , i.e. , that @xmath78 is small .",

    "we then check that , indeed , @xmath3 is close to the box @xmath81 .",
    "the last issue to discuss is the meaning of the word ` close ' above : how to measure the ` distance ' between the uniform distribution on @xmath3 and the product of its marginals .",
    "the information theoretic part of the argument naturally leads to measuring this distance using the kullback - leibler divergence . a natural thing to do at this point",
    "would be to use pinsker s inequality to move from kullback - leibler divergence to @xmath82-distance .",
    "this , however , leads to suboptimal @xmath83-dependence . to overcome this difficulty",

    "the answer , that it is best to take a circle , was already known to the ancient greeks , but it was not until the 19th century that this was proved rigorously .    the isoperimetric inequality for euclidean space states that among all subsets of @xmath4 of given volume , euclidean balls have the smallest boundary . to state a version of this precisely , if @xmath85 is a borel set of finite lebesgue measure , we denote by @xmath86 the _ distributional perimeter _ of @xmath87 ( see e.g. chapter 12 in @xcite for the definition of distributional perimeter )",
