    "magnetic fields are now believed to play an important role in the evolution of massive stars . a tayler - spruit dynamo mechanism @xcite has been predicted to be efficient in radiative layers of the stellar interior .",
    "however , these fields perhaps do not reach the photosphere with a measurable strength .",
    "@xcite showed that subsurface convection zones may be present in massive stars .",
    "if a dynamo operates in such a zone , a magnetic field could emerge to produce observable phenomena such as magnetic spots or hot plasma close to the stellar surface ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite examined the effect of magnetic fields on the transport of angular momentum and chemical mixing , and found that the potential influence on the evolution of massive stars is drastic .",
    "thus magnetic fields might change our whole picture about the evolution from o stars via wolf - rayet ( wr ) stars to supernovae / gamma - ray bursts .",
    "hitherto , neglecting magnetic fields might be one of the reasons why models and observations of massive - star populations are still in conflict @xcite .",
    "another potential importance of magnetic fields in massive stars concerns the dynamics of the stellar winds .",
    "wherever @xmath4 , it ushers a transition to magnetic control of the wind .",
    "if the field is weaker than this limit , the field lines are carried along with the wind of mass - loss rate @xmath5 and ( terminal ) velocity @xmath6 , and become more or less radial ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "our long - standing interest is to understand wr stars in all their aspects , including their magnetic fields .",
    "classical wr stars are massive stars that have lost their outer layers in a relatively short time .",
    "thus , if a massive star has an interior dynamo as predicted by the tayler - spruit mechanism , the magnetized layers can now be displayed in the atmosphere with a field strength of many kg @xcite or being even further condensed by the progressing stellar contraction .",
    "there is indirect evidence , e.g.  from spectral variability and x - ray emission , that magnetic fields are present in wr atmospheres ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "also the theoretical work of @xcite predicts a degree of circular polarization of a few times 10@xmath7 for magnetic fields of about 100 g .",
    "the detection of magnetic fields is however difficult , chiefly because the line spectrum is formed in the strong stellar wind .",
    "this does not only imply a dilution of the field at the place of line formation .",
    "the big problem is the wind broadening of the emission lines by doppler shifts with wind velocities of a few thousand kms@xmath8 . in high - resolution spectropolarimetric observations",
    ", some broad spectral lines extend over adjacent orders , so that it is necessary to adopt the order shapes to get the best continuum normalization . in view of such immense line broadening in wr stars , to search for a weak magnetic field",
    ", we decided to use the low - resolution vlt instrument fors2 ( focal reducer low dispersion spectrograph ) mounted at the 8-m antu telescope , which appears to be one of the most suitable instruments in the world offering low resolution and the required spectropolarimetric sensitivity .    our sample of wr stars selected for the search of the presence of magnetic fields includes two rather bright wn4 stars , wr6 and wr18 , and the wc6 star wr23 .",
    "since the rotation period of wr6 ( @xmath9d ) was already determined and confirmed in the past by several teams ( e.g. , @xcite ) , one of our goals is to assess the presence of a magnetic field and its potential cyclical modulation over the rotation cycle , as expected for tilted dipole or split monopole geometries .",
    "further , from our previous comprehensive analyses using the potsdam wolf - rayet model atmospheres , we have identified a few wolf - rayet stars in the galaxy and the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) that are in an extremely advanced stage of their evolution , being very compact ( @xmath10 ) and hot ( @xmath11kk ) .",
    "having lost their outer layers , they now expose their cores and are promising targets to search for the presence of a magnetic field .",
    "the sample of galactic wr stars with such very small stellar radii is very limited ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) . among them , wr7 is the best candidate to be observed from the vlt observatory located on cerro paranal .    additionally , probably for reasons of stellar evolution in the lower metallicity environment , the wn population in the lmc shows a higher fraction of very hot and compact wn stars ( e.g. ,  @xcite ) .",
    "we have chosen the brightest of these lmc objects , bat997 , as another target .",
    "bat997 has an additional peculiarity that makes it an especially promising candidate for showing a strong magnetic field , which concerns the shape of its line profiles .",
    "these profile shapes are very round , unlike the gaussian shape that is usually found in wr - type emission lines .",
    "we have found such type of line profiles in only two galactic wr stars , but in five wn stars from the lmc .",
    "the reason for this profile shape is not clear .",
    "model atmospheres are not able to reproduce it , unless one assumes broadening by extremely fast rotation . in the case of bat997",
    ", we estimate a @xmath12 of 1900kms@xmath8 to account for the profile shape when applying just flux convolution . given the compactness of the star , such fast rotation is not impossible but close to the breakup limit , making these stars good grb candidates .",
    "rotational broadening may be enhanced by wind corotation enforced by a strong magnetic field , while the rotation itself can strengthen the dynamo .",
    "wr7 does not show such round line profiles , but is one of the few wolf - rayet stars that have been found to be x - ray active .",
    "the origin of x - rays from single - star winds is still under debate , and can be attributed either to wind shocks from the deshadowing instability @xcite , or corotating interaction regions ( cirs ) @xcite , or to magnetic effects ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "bat997 has not been seen in x - rays yet , but due to its large distance there is no tight upper limit either .",
    "we note that a detailed quantitative spectral analysis of all stars in our sample was already carried out in previous studies ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "any binary suspects are excluded from our target selection to avoid confusion between the magnetic field measurements and effects from colliding stellar winds .    in section",
    "[ sect : data ] , we give an overview of our spectropolarimetric observations and the data reduction , followed by the presentation of the results of the magnetic field measurements for the individual stars in section  [ sect : meas ] . section  [ sect : syn ] describes our measurement error validation using a synthetic spectrum and section  [ sect : lin ] is devoted to observations of the linear polarization .",
    "finally , we summarize the results of our observations in section  [ sect : disc ] .",
    ".overview of the wr stars observed in the first run . [ cols=\"<,<,>,^ \" , ]     [ tab : lin ]        since all measured polarization is the sum of interstellar polarization and intrinsic polarization ( whereby the line polarization is always a fraction of the continuum polarization ) , to determine the interstellar polarization in wr6 , we followed the procedure described in the work of @xcite . in the stellar spectra",
    "displaying the line effect , it is possible to obtain a good measure of the interstellar polarization . in order to estimate it , one needs to determine the polarization of the line and the continuum . in fig .",
    "[ fig : linwr6 ] , we present as an example linear polarization spectra not corrected for interstellar polarization .",
    "the continuum polarization of wr6 was calculated using the vector sum of the stokes parameters over the entire spectrum , excluding regions containing obvious emission lines .",
    "the respective wavelength regions used are presented in table  [ tab : lin ] .",
    "this results in a vector pointing from the continuum polarization to the line polarization and finally to the direction of the interstellar polarization ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : lin_isp_wr6 ] ) .",
    "then , we assumed for each observation a line that goes through the line polarization , the continuum polarization and an initial interstellar polarization ( isp ) . through a least - squares minimization for each line and a minimization of @xmath13 via a downhill simplex technique , a best estimate for ( @xmath14 , @xmath15 ) could be determined .",
    "we obtained @xmath16 and @xmath17 , which gives @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "the interstellar polarization is wavelength dependent and can be modelled by the empirical serkowski law @xcite :    @xmath20\\ ] ]    where @xmath21 is the maximum polarization occurring at a wavelength @xmath22 and @xmath23 is a shape parameter .",
    "the results of the measurements of linear polarization in the spectra of wr6 are presented in the lower part of table  [ tab : linpol ] , together with the corresponding phases .",
    "the linear polarization of the star wr6 was already presented in numerous studies ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , and our measurements show close agreement with previous results : we find that the range of the intrinsic continuum polarization is approximately 0.20.6% , while the position angle of the polarization is strongly variable .",
    "we noticed at the rotation phase 0.855 an apparent emission resulting from the alignment of the continuum to the line polarization and the isp vector ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "we also noticed that at the rotational phase 0.012 the vector from the continuum to the line polarization significantly differs from all other measurements .",
    "as mentioned above , wr6 displays variability that cycles on a period of 3.77d .",
    "this period has generally been associated with rotation , and the star is believed to host a cir as suggested by uv , optical studies , and x - rays ( e.g. ,  @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the stable period of the star indicates the presence of a clock in the system .",
    "however , the variability can exhibit complex behavior , including rapid phase changes ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "if the period observed in wr6 is associated with rotation , then the observed variability is tied to an organized structure threading the wind , such as cirs . in terms of the period",
    ", the linear polarization observations from this study span nearly 100 cycles , and variability in wr  6 is known to exhibit phase drift .",
    "however , much of the data were obtained within two contiguous cycles .",
    "we have attempted a rough fit to this subset of the linearly polarized data using a cir model as described in @xcite .",
    "@xcite presented a kinematic description of a cir in terms of a spiral arm morphology in shape , and in terms of a density contrast ( either enhancement or deficit ) relative to the otherwise unperturbed spherical wind .",
    "this is clearly a gross simplification as compared to more detailed numerical simulations of cir phenomena from massive star winds ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) . using this approach , @xcite",
    "employ the optically thin scattering results of @xcite for axisymmetric structures .",
    "the spiral morphology is not axisymmetric ; however , the structure is conceived in terms of a series of differential pancake - shaped blobs , each one being slightly shifted in azimuth from the preceding , so that each segment of the spiral is axisymmetric . using an equation of motion for the spiral pattern , and formulating a superposition for the net polarization properties from the ensemble of spiral segment pieces , @xcite were able to evaluate a semi - analytic result for the polarization with rotational phase .",
    "moreover , an approach for combining multiple cirs originating from arbitrary latitudes was presented .    here",
    "only a heuristic application of the model is applied to the dataset .",
    "the model allows for a number of free parameters , but in the application to wr  6 , the star and wind parameters are treated as fixed .",
    "the wind is optically thick to electron scattering , and the ignace et al .",
    "model applies only for thin scattering .",
    "for this situation a core - halo model is adopted , whereby the polarization is evaluated only where the electron optical depth @xmath24 , assuming that light from regions with @xmath25 will be completely depolarized .",
    "the free parameters that remain in the model include : viewing inclination @xmath26 ( relative to the spin axis of the star ) , latitude @xmath27 at which a cir originates , opening angle @xmath28 of the cir structure , the rotational phase offset @xmath29 between the model and the observations , an orientation phase @xmath30 for how the projected spin axis is projected on the sky relative to the observational system for evaluating stokes @xmath31 and @xmath32 , and finally a density contrast factor @xmath33 .",
    "note first that @xmath33 is defined so that @xmath34 is a spherical wind .",
    "second , the factors @xmath28 and @xmath33 are somewhat degenerate when the opening angle of the cir is not overly large : both affect the amplitude of the polarization but not the shape of its variation with rotational phase .",
    "( upper panel ) and @xmath32 ( lower panel ) in percent plotted against rotational phase .",
    "the points present the data while the curves correspond to the models for viewing inclinations of @xmath35 . ]",
    "although the model allows for multiple cirs , our objective was to determine whether a reasonable match between the data and the model could be achieved with just one cir structure .",
    "the results of our trial - and - error fitting are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : modell ] .",
    "the two panels are for @xmath31 ( upper panel ) and @xmath32 ( lower panel ) as percent polarization plotted against rotational phase .",
    "note that formal fits between the data and the model are not made ( i.e. , there is no @xmath36 evaluation ) . also , the three red points in fig .",
    "[ fig : modell ] were not used in guiding the selection of the model parameters . of those three points ,",
    "one is from a much older observation at the phase 0.563 , and thus from a much earlier epoch than the blue points .",
    "the other two points that were not considered are the point at rotation phase 0.855 , where an apparent emission was resulting from the alignment of the continuum to the line polarization and the isp vector , and the point at rotation phase 0.012 , where the vector from the continuum to the line polarization significantly differed from all other measurements ( see sect .",
    "[ sect : linpolwr6 ] ) .",
    "however , as is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : modell ] , all three points do roughly follow the trend of the model curves",
    ".    there is one notable discrepant point in the panel for @xmath31 , located near phase 0.9 ( surrounded by a dotted circle ) . no model with a single arm",
    "can simultaneously account for that point along with the other measurements .",
    "the discrepant point may suggest more arms , or that a cir ( or cirs ) is not the only structure existing in the flow . we should expect a stochastic component to the structure .",
    "the cir might be disrupted at times , or perhaps an additional wind structure can sometimes dominate the polarization .    in the selecting the model curves plotted in figure  [ fig : modell ] , we first tried a single cir located in the equatorial plane .",
    "varying the remaining parameters , no satisfactory matches were achievable .",
    "next we varied both the latitude of the cir and the viewing inclination of the star .",
    "a suite of model curves for viewing inclinations of @xmath35 are displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : modell ] , which are seen to broadly reproduce the pattern for the data ( with the exception of one point in @xmath31 near phase of 0.9 ) .",
    "relative to inclinations below @xmath37 , an inclination exceeding @xmath37 serves to flip the sense of rotation as projected onto the sky . for this range",
    "a fairly similar set of model curves resulted for cirs at latitudes of @xmath38 and @xmath39 as well as @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "when @xmath26 and @xmath27 are in opposite hemispheres , the spiral does sweep across the front of the star for the observer s sightline , but wr  6 is known to show regular dac behavior ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : modell ] thus shows the models for @xmath42 and @xmath41 .",
    "this is the first time that a model for polarization from a cir has been applied to data .",
    "given that the model adopts a core - halo approach , plus the complexity of the wind structure , the overall ability of the model to match the majority of the data suggests that a cir is plausibly the source , or a significant contributor , to the variable linear polarimetry of wr  6 .",
    "it is not our goal to claim a fit of high significance , but simply to test the ability of the model for achieving a rough match to the observed trend with ( a ) a single cir and ( b ) a limited number of free parameters . given the simplistic nature of the model , it is gratifying to find that a modestly good fit to the majority of the measures can be achieved .",
    "in this work , we address wolf - rayet type stars , where the magnetic fields are especially hard to detect because of the wind - broadening of their spectral lines .",
    "moreover , all photospheric lines are absent and the magnetic field is measured on emission lines formed in the strong wind .",
    "it is the first time that the low dispersion spectrograph fors2 in spectropolarimetric mode mounted at one of the biggest telescopes in the world is used for spectropolarimetry of wr stars .",
    "wr stars descend from initial masses above 20@xmath43 and during their fast evolution , they already lost a significant mass fraction via their powerful stellar winds . depending on their exact mass , rotation , magnetism and mass - loss , in a few @xmath44yr",
    ", these stars will become either neutron stars or black holes ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "a small fraction of the wr star progenitors have strong magnetic fields on the main sequence  the magnetic o - type stars .",
    "the observed temporal variations of the longitudinal magnetic fields in these stars are usually compatible with dipole fields inclined to the rotation axis , implying a simple global structure .",
    "obviously , the strength of the average longitudinal magnetic field in wr6 , varying with an amplitude of order only 100 g over the rotation cycle , is significantly lower than the field strength detected in several magnetic o - type stars .",
    "this is perhaps not surprising , given the fact that the magnetic field is diagnosed in the line - forming regions , which fall fairly far out in a wolf - rayet wind , and not at the stellar surface .",
    "on the other hand , a wolf - rayet star like wr6 is significantly contracted relative to its o - star progenitor , so the evolution of the field between these states requires further investigation .",
    "it would be worthwhile to obtain in the future more dense rotation phase coverage by spectropolarimetric observations to further strengthen the evidence for the magnetic nature of this star .",
    "we should keep in mind that the method we have applied involves substantial systematic uncertainties , so only gives a rough result for the field strength where lines are formed , and that different lines form over different zones of the wind , sampling different field strengths .",
    "magnetic fields for the other wr stars in our sample present at a significance level of about 2.5@xmath0 and below .",
    "since up to now no long - time spectropolarimetric monitoring was carried out for them and we can not neglect the possibility of unfavorable sampling of the magnetic field configuration , the non - detection of the magnetic field does not mean that no magnetic field is present in their atmospheres . clearly , attaining higher snr using fors2 in the future will help to set more stringent limits to their magnetic field strengths .",
    "for the first time , we present linear polarization measurements for bat997 , wr7 , wr18 , and wr23 .",
    "we do not find any evidence of a line effect in these stars .",
    "previous linear polarization studies showed that most wr stars exhibit variable continuum polarization .",
    "however , no spectropolarimetric variability is detected for bat997 , wr7 , and wr23 over two nights . from the monitoring of the linear polarization of wr6 over the rotation cycle , we confirm that the detected continuum polarization and the polarization position angle are not constant with time .",
    "the authors thank the referee for useful comments and helpful suggestions that improved this manuscript .",
    "we also thank yuri beletsky from las campanas observatory for his help in the preparation of the image of the nebula ngc2359 ."
