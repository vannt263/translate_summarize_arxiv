    "the ability to optically cool macroscopic mechanical oscillators close to their ground state , from which highly non - classical superposition states may be prepared , provides a platform in which to study the interplay between gravitational and quantum physics@xcite .",
    "the objective is to engineer quantum states of mechanical systems in which gravitational effects must be taken into account if we are to account for the dynamics .",
    "penrose@xcite and also diosi@xcite have proposed that in such a setting gravity would lead to a new kind of decoherence and , correspondingly , a new source of noise acting on the quantum degrees of freedom .",
    "if we had a quantum theory of gravity , the appearance of an additional source of noise would not be remarkable : it would ultimately arise from quantum fluctuations in the underlying field that mediates the gravitational interaction between quantum mechanical degrees of freedom@xcite .",
    "such effects , it is claimed , are likely to become important at the planck scale and thus seem unlikely to arise in table - top opto - mechanical experiments for which the newtonian description of gravitational interactions would seem to suffice .",
    "surprisingly , the proposals of penrose and diosi would indicate that this is not the case and that , given sufficient quantum control over macroscopic mechanical degrees of freedom , opto - mechanical systems might reveal gravitational decoherence .",
    "in this paper we use the recent proposal@xcite for classically mediated long range interactions applied to gravitational interactions . in the case of the mutual gravitational interaction of two masses , we model such a classical channel as a weak continuous measurement of the position of each mass",
    ". the continuous measurement record is used to control a reciprocal classical force on each mass via a feedforward control .",
    "in essence , the classical measurement record informs each mass of the other s position and applies the corresponding gravitational force . by requiring the effect",
    "be completely symmetric in the two masses , we show that the gravitational decoherence rate is completely determined by the gradient of the gravitational force between the two masses .",
    "this is equivalent to the gravitational decoherence models proposed by penrose and diosi .",

    "they define a quantum channel by introducing an ancillary degree of freedom , a harmonic oscillator .",
    "the coherent interactions between two local systems and the channel lead , under appropriate circumstances , to an effective direct non - local interaction between the two local systems .",
    "this kind of process is used in geometric phase gates to simulate non - local interactions between internal states of trapped ions , with the ionic vibrational modes serving as the ancilla@xcite .",
    "the key of course is the ability to implement controlled entangling operations between the electronic and vibrational degrees of freedom of each ion .",
    "a classical channel can then be defined by simply allowing the ancillary oscillator to be continually measured .    in this paper",
    "we will take a different , although equivalent , approach to defining a classical mediated interaction by using methods from quantum stochastic control theory@xcite .    rather than a direct quantum interaction of the form @xmath20",
    ", we assume the interaction is mediated by a _",
    "classical channel_. that is , the gravitational centre of mass co - ordinate , @xmath21 , of each particle is continuously measured and a classical stochastic measurement record , @xmath22 , carrying this information acts reciprocally as a classical control force on the other mass .",

    "the resulting unconditional dynamics is @xmath44-\\frac{i}{\\hbar}k[\\hat{x}_1\\hat{x}_2 , \\rho ] -\\frac{k}{2\\hbar}\\sum_{k=1}^2[\\hat{x}_k,[\\hat{x}_k,\\rho]]\\ ] ] this is consistent with diosi s model @xcite which gives the same decoherence rate as obtained here under similar approximations @xcite .",
    "the form of eq.([grav - me ] ) can be generalized to exactly match the one in reference @xcite if we include non - cross terms in the feedback .",
    "i.e. , in equation ( 9 ) , we could have terms proportional to @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "there are similarities between diosi s approach and the measurement mediated approach described here .",
    "both require that the gravitational interaction between the two degrees of freedom be replaced with a noisy interaction . in the measurement based approach",
    "this is incorporated in a way which necessarily preserves positivity as the noise arises from a ` hidden ' position measurement of the gravitational centre of has co - ordinate . in diosi s",
    "approach we need to explicitly constrain the noise to preserve positivity .",
    "more recently diosi@xcite has pointed out that a system subject to weak continuous measurement is a natural example of a quantum - classical hybrid dynamics .    using a recent result of kafri and taylor@xcite",

    "this is also true for eq .",
    "( [ full - me ] ) , assuming @xmath47 .",
    "conversely , if the decoherence effect were any weaker , we could entangle the ground state .",
    "further , the gravitational decoherence in the dynamics is minimal in the sense that , if it were any smaller , evolution under eq .",
    "( [ grav - me ] ) would immediately entangle the ground state of the ( uncoupled ) hamiltonian , @xmath48 .    to see this we write the eq.([grav - me ] ) in terms of the dimensionless operators @xmath49 , @xmath50-ig[\\tilde{x}_1\\tilde{x}_2,\\rho]-\\frac{1}{4}\\sum_{k=1}^2y_{ij}[\\tilde{x}_i,[\\tilde{x}_j,\\rho]]\\ ] ] where @xmath51 measures the strength of the gravitational interaction and the matrix @xmath52 is the decoherence matrix . using the result from @xcite",
    ", we note that entanglement is never generated if and only if the matrix @xmath53 has no negative eigenvalues , where @xmath54 is the @xmath55 symplectic matrix @xmath56 noting that @xmath53 has eigenvalues @xmath57 and @xmath58 we see that a slightly less noisy matrix @xmath59 produces entanglement for any positive @xmath60 .",
    "we now consider the prospects for an experimental observation of the model proposed here .",
    "for simplicity we will assume that the two mechanical resonators have the same mass ( @xmath16 ) and frequency ( @xmath61 ) .",
    "the last term in eq .",
    "( [ grav - me ] ) is responsible for two complementary effects : it drives a diffusion process in momentum of each of the oscillators at the rate @xmath62 , which we will call the gravitational heating rate @xmath63 the momentum diffusion leads to heating of the mechanical resonators .",
    "it is convenient to define this in terms of the rate of change of the phonon number ; the average mechanical energy divided by @xmath64 .",
    "the heating rate is then given by @xmath65    the double commutator term also leads to the decay of off - diagonal coherence in the position basis of each mechanical resonator , @xmath66 this shows that the rate of decay of coherence is more rapid the greater the separation of the superposed states .",
    "we can use the natural length scale proceeded by the zero - point position fluctuations in the ground state of each resonator to rewrite the decoherence rate as @xmath67 thus the gravitational decoherence rate for position , in natural units , is one half the gravitational heating rate .    these rates can equivalently be expressed in terms of the normal mode splitting when the gravitational interaction is weak , eq .",
    "( [ mode - split ] ) .",
    "@xmath68 we thus see that the key parameter responsible for gravitational decoherence is of the order of the normal mode splitting between the two mechanical resonators due to their gravitational coupling .",
    "this has significant consequences for observation .    in order to see gravitational decoherence in this model",
    ", we need to arrange for the normal mode splitting to be as large as possible . writing this in terms of the newton constant",
    ", we see that @xmath69 in the case of two spheres of radius @xmath70 , this may be written in terms of the density of the material as @xmath71 as @xmath72 , this quantity is bounded @xmath73 we need to use a material with a large density and a mechanical frequency as small as possible . for example , for depleted uranium spheres and a mechanical frequency of one hertz , we find that @xmath74 , a value so small that a terrestrial experiment would be challenging",
    ".    in a realistic experiment with low frequency mechanical resonators of the kind considered here , thermal noise and frictional damping will be unavoidable .",
    "we can estimate the relative size of these effects using the quantum brownian motion master equation@xcite , @xmath75 - 2\\gamma_j k_bt m_j[\\hat{x}_j,[\\hat{x}_j,\\rho]]\\ ] ] where @xmath76 is the dissipation rate for each of the mechanical resonators assumed to be interacting with a common thermal environment at temperature @xmath77 .",
    "if we compare the form of thermal noise in this equation to the form of gravitational decoherence , for the symmetric case , we see that we can assign an effective temperature to the gravitational decoherence rate given by @xmath78 if we write this in terms of the quality factor , @xmath79 , for the mechanical resonators , it gives an effective thermal energy scale of @xmath80 in the example discussed in the previous paragraph for the relatively high value of @xmath81 we find that @xmath82k .",
    "one would need an ambient temperature less than this to clearly distinguish gravitational decoherence from environmental effects .",
    "it is difficult to see how this might be achieved even using modern opto - mechanical laser cooling of mechanical resonators .",
    "possibly gravitationally coupled bose - einstein condensates of atomic gases could reach this regime .",
    "in this paper we have presented a model in which the force of gravity is mediated by a purely classical channel .",
    "the channel is defined by considering a continuous weak measurement of the position of each of two masses and feeding forward the classical stochastic record of measurement results to induce the right gravitational force between the masses . as",
    "the weak measurement model is entirely consistent with quantum mechanics , exactly the right amount of noise is introduced to ensure that the resulting master equation , when averaged over all measurement records , is positivity preserving . using a minimal symmetric argument , we find that the model is equivalent to a gravitational decoherence model first proposed by diosi . as the systematic effect of the gravitational interaction",
    "also fixes the size of the noise , minimising the noise leads to a model with no free parameters .",
    "our model is a specific example of a general theory of a classically mediated ( i.e. non - entangling ) force law considered by kafri and taylor @xcite . using a result in that paper",
    "we find that a classically mediated gravitational channel based on continuous weak measurement can never entangle gaussian systems . in an experimental setting of two identical gravitationally coupled resonators ,",
    "this result is manifest as a direct scaling between the normal mode splitting induced by the gravitational force and the gravitational decoherence rate .",
