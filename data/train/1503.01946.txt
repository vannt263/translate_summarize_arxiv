    "no larger class of knots is likely to share this feature .",
    "rudolph s construction of transverse @xmath0-links yields infinite families of smoothly slice quasipositive knots  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , baker describes infinite families of smoothly concordant ( in fact , ribbon concordant ) strongly quasipositive knots  @xcite , based on hedden s work on whitehead doubles  @xcite .",
    "our proof relies on a careful analysis of the signature function of positive knots .",
    "the main ingredient is a linear estimate of the signature invariant @xmath1 of positive links .",
    "[ t ] the following inequalities hold for all positive links @xmath2 : @xmath3    here @xmath4 denotes the minimal first betti number of all seifert surfaces of the link  @xmath2 .",
    "the earliest result in this direction is due to rudolph  @xcite : closures of positive braids have positive signature .",
    "this was independently extended to positive knots by cochran and gompf  @xcite and to positive links by traczyk and przytycki  @xcite .",
    "later stoimenow improved rudolph s result by showing that the signature is bounded by an increasing function of the first betti number  @xcite . the first linear bound for positive braid knots",
    "was derived by feller  @xcite : @xmath5    theorem  2 yields a linear bound for the topological 4-genus @xmath6 of positive knots , in terms of their genus : @xmath7 this follows from kauffman and taylor s signature bound  @xcite , @xmath8 , combined with the equality @xmath9 , valid for all knots @xmath10 .",
    "again , this does not extend to ( strongly ) quasipositive knots , thanks to a result by rudolph  @xcite : every seifert form can be realized by a quasipositive surface . in particular , there exist topologically slice , strongly quasipositive knots of arbitrarily high genus .    the following section contains basic facts about the signature function , non - orientable spanning surfaces and the signature formula of gordon and litherland  @xcite .",

    "[ f : reducing ] ) .",
    "actually , by the formula @xmath44 , smoothing both crossings does not reduce the genus if and only if the seifert circle in question is connected to two distinct other seifert circles . we choose to smooth the crossings of all seifert circles where smoothing does not reduce the first betti number . by this procedure , we obtain a reduced diagram @xmath45 of a new positive link @xmath46 such that @xmath47 .",
    "furthermore we have @xmath48 , since the smoothings can be realised by positive - to - negative crossing changes .",
    "we now show @xmath49 for the new link @xmath46 .",

    "if two such seifert circles meet at a crossing , then they meet at two crossings and the corresponding part of  @xmath51 corresponds to a 2-component hopf link split from the rest of the link .",
