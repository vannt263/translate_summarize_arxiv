    "this is a review talk to present the main ideas of some line of research in quantum gravity , namely the spin foam approach , that has been explored by a great number of physicists and mathematicians and has attracted much attention .",
    "the three main lines of research in quantum gravity are denoted as `` canonical '' , `` covariant '' or `` sum over histories '' @xcite    the canonical line of research is a theory in which the hilbert space carries a representation of the quantum operators corresponding to the full metric without background metric to be fixed .",
    "it can be considered as a quantum field theory on a differentiable manifold .",
    "the basis of the hilbert space are cilindrical functions defined on a graph ( wilson loops ) depending on ashtehar variables @xcite . a very important result of this approach was the discrete eigenvalues for the area and volumen operators .",
    "the covariant line of research is the attempt to built the theory as a quantum field theory of the fluctuations of the metric over a flat minkowski space , or some other background metric space .",
    "the theory has been proved to be renormalizable and finite order by order .",
    "@xcite    the sum over histories line of research uses the feymann path integral to quantize the einstein hilbert action .",
    "there exist a duality between this model and group field theories .",
    "the sum over spin foam can be generated as the feymann perturbative expansion of the group field theories .",
    "each space - time appears as the feymann graph of the auxiliary groups field theory .",
    "@xcite our presentation is going to be concentrated on this third line of research , namely , the spin network and the spin foam models , from an historical point of view .",
    "the regge s paper @xcite was a pionnier work in the discretization of gr , that was motivated by the need to avoid coordinates , because the physical prediction of the theory was coordinates independent .",
    "for that purpose he discretizes a continuous manifold by @xmath0-simplices , that are glued together by identification of their @xmath1-simplices .",
    "the curvature lies on the @xmath2- dimensional subspaces , known as hinges or bones . from pedagogical reasons",
    "we take a triangulation of a 2-dimensional surface .",
    "when a collection of triangle meeting at a vertex is flattened there will be a gap or deficit angle @xmath3 , indicating the presence of curvature . using the gauss - bonet formula we can calculate the excess angle by @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the curvature at that vertex and @xmath6 the area of the triangles around the vertex .",
    "if the number of vertices increases we can take @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the density of vertices in the triangulation (= number of vertices by unit area ) .",
    "this method is easily enlarged to higher dimensions .    in order to have connecton with gr we traslate into the triangulated surface ( the skeleton ) the hilbert - einstein action @xmath9 where @xmath5 is the scalar curvature in 4-dimensions .",
    "the discrete version for a 4-dimensional skeleton is given in terms of the deficit angle in each bone where the curvature @xmath5 is calculated and some measure function @xmath10 is defined : @xmath11 here the summation extends to all the bones in the skeleton . in the continuous case the einstein s equations are derived from a stationary action , varying @xmath12 with respect to the metric . in the discrete version one derives the action with respect to the edge lengths , because in the simplicial decomposition all the properties can be derived from these edges . using schlaefli differential identity one finds @xmath13 which is the discrete version of einstein s equations @xcite",
    "some years later ponzano and regge @xcite made use of @xmath14 symbols attached to the tetrahedra decomposition in order to calculate the state sum and were able to connect it to the feymann integral corresponding to the hilbert - einstein action .",
    "the @xmath14 wigner simbols is a generalization of the clebsch - gordan coefficients that appear in the coupling of two angular momenta @xmath15    the new basis is given in term of the old basis : @xmath16 if we couple @xmath17 with a new angular momentum @xmath18 we have two possibilities @xmath19 in the first case the new basis is given ( in obvious notation ) @xmath20 in the second case the new basis is given by @xmath21 the transformating matrix between the two basis is given precisely by the @xmath14 symbols , namely , @xmath22    given a tetrahedra decomposition of a 3-dimensional surface we can attach a @xmath14 symbol to each tetrahedra , the edges of which have the length equal to the numerical values of the angular momenta appearing in the @xmath23-symbol .",
    "this choice is consistent with the inequalities @xmath24 and the equalities @xmath25 the @xmath14 symbols are proportional to the racah polynomials @xcite @xmath26    from this equality and the assymptotic properties of racah polynomials one can derive very important limit @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the volume of the tetrahedra and @xmath29 the exterior dihedral angle adjoint to the edge @xmath30 in order to see the conection between @xmath14 symbols and quantum gravity we take a tetrahedra decomposition and take external edges @xmath31 of the bounding surface and internal edges @xmath32",
    ". then ponzano and regge construct the state sum as follows    @xmath33 where @xmath34 is a phase factor . substituting the @xmath14 symbols by their assymptotic values and the function cosine by the euler expression we arrive at    @xmath35x_i } \\right . } } \\ ] ]    we may replace the summation with an integral . then the most important contribution comes from the stationary phase that is to say when @xmath36    introducing this value in the state sum we obtain @xcite @xmath37 where @xmath38    the summation @xmath39 approaches the hilbert - einstein action that was given in the regge calculus , therefore in the limit the state sum strongly resembles a feymann summation over histories with density of lagrangian @xmath40 @xmath41namely @xmath42",
    "penrose was interested in the interpretation of space - time @xcite by purely combinatorial properties of some elementary units that are connected among themselves by some interactions that follow the angular momentum quantum rules , and form some network of elementary units with assigned spins .",
    "soon it was realized that the spin network was analog to simplicial quantum gravity , in particular the ponzano - regge model @xcite .",
    "his networks had trivalent vertices and the edges were labeled with spin , satisfying the standard conditions at the vertices .",
    "the model was generalized to any group different from the rotation group .",
    "formaly a spin network ia a triple @xmath43 where    1 .",
    "@xmath44 is a graph with a finite set of edges @xmath45 and a finite set of vertices , @xmath46 , 2 .   to each edge",
    "@xmath45 we attach an irrep of a group @xmath47 , @xmath48 3 .   to each vertex",
    "@xmath46 we attach an intertwiner .",
    "when we take the dual of an spin network we obtain a triangulated figure , which , after embedding in a 3-dimensional manifold becomes the triangulation of regge calculus .",
    "they defined a state sum for triangulated 3-manifold ( as in the ponzano - regge model ) that was independent os the triangulation and finite @xcite . for this purpose",
    "they assign a value from the set @xmath49 , integer , to each edge of the triangulation , subject to the condition that the `` coloring '' of the three edges forming a triangle should satisfy the triangle inequalities and their sum should be and integer less than or equal to @xmath50 .",
    "define the quantum object @xmath51 where @xmath52 is an admisible coloring of the edge @xmath53 , @xmath54^{1/2 } \\quad , \\quad \\omega _ { } ^2   = \\sum\\limits_{j \\in i_r } { \\omega _ j^4 } \\ ] ] and @xmath55 is the quantum @xmath23-simbol corresponding to the tetrahedron @xmath56 with coloring @xmath57 , such that @xmath58 } & { \\left [ j \\right ] } & { \\left [ k \\right ] }   \\cr      { \\left [ l \\right ] } & { \\left [ m \\right ] } & { \\left [ n \\right ] }   \\cr   \\end{array } \\end{matrix }   \\right\\}\\ ] ] where [ @xmath0 ] is the quantum number satisfying @xmath60 \\to n$ ] .",
    "summing @xmath61 over all admisible coloring we obtain an expresion in the limit @xmath62 or @xmath63 that becomes identical to the ponzano - regge state sum .",
    "turaev and viro proved that their expression is manifold invariant ( or independent of triangulation ) under alexander moves , and also finite .",
    "the ponzano - regge state sum and the turaev - viro model are defined over 3-dimensional manifold . to enlarge the model to four dimensions it vas necessary to increase the wigner symbols to @xmath64 .",
    "the key to this approach was given by boulatov @xcite by the use of topological lattice gauge theories , taking group elements as variables ( matrix models ) .",
    "the basic objects is a set of real functions of 3 variables @xmath65 ( where @xmath66 invariant under simultaneous right shift of all variables by @xmath67 and also by cyclic permutation of @xmath68 .",
    "this function @xmath69 can be expanded , by peter - weyl theorem , in terms of representations of @xmath70 and 3j - symbols .",
    "an action of interest can be constructed with those functions as follows @xmath71 if we attach the variable to the edges , the first term ( the kinematical term ) represent two glued triangle and the second one ( the interacting term ) four triangles forming a tetrahedron . substituting the fourier expansion of funcion @xmath72 , and integrating out group variables we obtain an action depending on the fourier coefficientes and 6j - simbols . from this result",
    "we calculate the partition function as a feymann path integral with respect to the fourier coefficients @xmath73 where the products extend to all tetrahedra t , all edges @xmath74 , and the summation extend to all the representations @xmath75 , all the simplicial complexes @xmath76 and @xmath77 is the number of tetrahedra in complex @xmath78 .",
    "this partition function is equivalent , up to renormalization , to ponzano - regge state sum applied to some triangulation of 3-dimensional manifold .",
    "the underlying mathematical structure is a topological lattice gauge theory , it has the advantage that is topological invariant . in order to prove it ,",
    "boulatov used the alexander moves , by which one complex , and the corresponding partition function is topological invariant",
    "the 3-dimensional boulatov model paved the way to the ooguri s model in four dimensions .",
    "@xcite let @xmath72 be a real valued function of four variables @xmath79 on @xmath80 a compact group . for simplicity",
    "we take @xmath81 .",
    "we require @xmath72 to be invariant under the right action of @xmath47 , and by cyclic permutation of these variables . the peter - weyl theorem , we can expand @xmath72 in terms of these representations and the 3j - symbols .",
    "we define the action @xmath82 where the first term ( the kinematical term ) represents the coupling of a tetrahedrum with itself because each element @xmath83 is associated to each face of the tetrahedrum , and the second term ( the interacting term ) represents gluing faces of five tetrahedra to make a four - simplex . substituting the fourier expansion into the action we can integrate out the group variable , and then the action can be used to calculate a partition function as a feyman path integral with respect to this action : @xmath84 where the integral is defined in terms of the fourier coefficients @xmath85 , appearing in the action and in the measure , the first sum is over all complexes @xmath78 ( four - dimensional combinatorial manifolds ) , @xmath86 is the number of 4-simplices in @xmath78 , the second summation is over all irreducible representations os @xmath70 with angular momentum @xmath87 and @xmath88 are the triangles , tetrahedra and 4-simplexes respectively apearing in the complex .",
    "ooguri also proved that the partition function is topological invariant under the alexander moves .",
    "as in the boulatov model two complexes are combinatorially equivalent if and only if they are connected by a sequence of transformations called alexander moves .",
    "a more abstract approach was taken by barrett and crane @xcite generalizing penrose s spin networks to four dimensions .",
    "the novelty of this model consists in the association of representations of @xmath89 group to the faces of the tetrahedra , instead of the edges .",
    "they decompose a triangulation of a 4-dimensional manifold into 4-simplices , the geometrical properties of which are characterized in terms of bivectors .",
    "a geometric 4-simplex in euclidean space is given by the embedding of an ordered set of 5 points in @xmath90 which is required to be non - degenerate ( the points should not lie in any hyperplane ) .",
    "each triangle in it determines a bivector constructed out of the vectors for the edges .",
    "barrett and crane proved that classically , a geometric 4-simplex in euclidean space is completely characterized ( up to parallel translation an inversion through the origin ) by a set of 10 bivectors @xmath91 , each corresponding to a triangle in the 4-simplex and satisfying the following properties :    1 .",
    "the bivector changes sign if the orientation of the triangle is changed ; 2 .",
    "each bivector is simple , i.e. is given by the wedge product of two vectors for the edges ; 3 .",
    "if two triangles share a common edge , the sum of the two bivector is simple ; 4 .",
    "the sum ( considering orientation ) of the 4 bivectors corresponding to the faces of a tetrahedron is zero ; 5 .   for six triangles sharing the same vertex ,",
    "the six corresponding bivectors are linearly independent ; 6 .",
    "the bivectors ( thought of as operators ) corresponding to triangles meeting at a vertex of a tetrahedron satisfy tr @xmath92>0 $ ] i.e. the tetrahedron has non - zero volume .    then barrett and crane define the quantum 4-simplex with the help of bivectors thought as elements of the lie algebra @xmath89 , associating a representation to each triangle and a tensor to each tetrahedron .",
    "the representations chosen should satisfy the following conditions corresponding to the geometrical ones :    1 .",
    "different orientations of a triangle correspond to dual representations ; 2 .",
    "the representations of the triangles are `` simple '' representations of @xmath89 , i.e. @xmath93 ; 3 .   given two triangles , if we decompose the pair of representations into its clebsch - gordan series , the tensor for the tetrahedron is decomposed into summands which are non - zero only for simple representations ; 4 .",
    "the tensor for the tetrahedron is invariant under @xmath89 .",
    "+ now it is easy to construct an amplitude for the quantum 4-simplex .",
    "the graph for a relativistic spin network is the 1-complex , dual to the boundary of the 4-simplex , having five 4-valent vertices ( corresponding to the five tetrahedra ) , with each of the ten edges connecting two different vertices ( corresponding to the ten triangles of the 4-simplex each shared by two tetrahedra ) .",
    "now we associate to each triangle ( the dual of which is an edge ) a simple representation of the algebra @xmath89 and to each tetrahedra ( the dual of which is a vertex ) a intertwiner ; and to a 4-simplex the product of the five intertwiner with the indices suitable contracted , and the sum for all possible representations . the proposed state sum suitable for quantum gravity for a given triangulation ( decomposed into 4-simplices ) is    @xmath94    where the sum extends to all possible values of the representations @xmath17 .        in order to know the representation attached to each triangle of the tesselation , we take the unitary representation of so(4 ) in terms of euler angles . @xmath95 where @xmath96 is the rotation matrix in the @xmath97 plane , @xmath98 the rotation matrix in the @xmath99 plane and @xmath100 the rotation ( `` boost '' ) in the @xmath101 plane . in the angular momentum basis ,",
    "the action of @xmath100 is a follows @xmath102 where @xmath103 is the biedenharn - dolginov function @xcite",
    "in order to evaluate the state sum for a particular triangulation of the total @xmath104 space by 4-simplices , we assign an element @xmath105 to each tetrahedrum of the 4-simplex @xmath106 and a representation @xmath107 of @xmath89 to each triangle shared by two tetrahedra . from this triangulation",
    "we obtain an 2-complex by the dual graph where one vertex corresponds to a tetrahedrum and an edge corresponds to triangle , with the ends of the edges identified with the vertices .",
    "then we attach a representation of @xmath70 , @xmath108 and @xmath109 to the vertices @xmath56 and @xmath74 and contract both representation along the edges @xmath110 , giving @xmath111 where @xmath112 is the representation of @xmath89 corresponding to the product @xmath113 , the left and right components of the @xmath89 group .",
    "the state sum for the 2-dimensional complex ( the feymann graph of the model ) is obtained by taking the product for all the edges of the graph and integrating for all the copies of @xmath70 @xmath114 due to the trace condition this expression is invariant under left and right multiplication of some elements of @xmath70 .",
    "@xcite    for the representation @xmath115 we choose the spherical function with respect to the identity representation . given a completely irreducible representation of the group @xmath116 on the space @xmath117",
    ", we define the spherical function with respect to the finite irrepr . of the subgroup @xmath5 @xmath118 where @xmath119 is a projector of @xmath117 onto the space @xmath120 of @xmath5    we take for @xmath121 the simple representation @xmath122 and for the subgroup @xmath70 the identity representation @xmath123 . since @xmath124 is invariant under @xmath5 we can restrict the unitary representations to those of the boost @xmath125 . with the help of the biedenharn - dolginov function",
    "it can be proved @xmath126 with this formula it is still possible to give a geometrical interpretation of the probability amplitude encompassed in the trace .",
    "in fact the spin dependent factor appearing in the exponential of the spherical function @xmath127 corresponding to the two tetrahedra @xmath128 intersecting the triangle @xmath129 , can be interpreted as the product of the angle between the two vectors @xmath130 , perpendicular to the triangle , and the area @xmath131 of the intersecting triangle , @xmath132 being the spin corresponding to the representation @xmath115 associated to the triangle @xmath128 . substituting this value in the state sum , we obtain @xmath133 where the product extend to all tetrahedra with the vector @xmath134 perpendicular to the subspace where the tetrahedra is embedded , and summation is extended to all the triangle @xmath128 intersected by two tetrahedra @xmath56 and @xmath74 .",
    "the exponential term correspond to the regge action , that in the assymptotic limit becomes the hilbert - einstein action @xcite    because we are interested in the physical and mathematical properties of the barrett - crane model , we mention some recent work about this model combined with the matrix model approach of boulatov and ooguri.@xcite in this work the 2-dimensional quantum space - time emerges as a feymann graph , in the manner of the 4 dimensional matrix models . in this way a spin foam model is connected to the feyman diagram of quantum gravity .",
    "now we apply the same technique to calculate the state sum invariant under the lorentz group that we have used in the case of the @xmath89 group for the barrett - crane model    the unitary irreducible representation of the @xmath135 group for the principal series is given by the formula [ 7 ] @xmath136 } \\psi } \\right)\\left ( z \\right ) = \\left ( { \\beta z + \\delta } \\right)^{m + i\\rho   - 2 } \\left ( { \\beta z + \\delta } \\right)^ { - m } \\psi \\left ( { { { \\alpha z + \\gamma } \\over { \\beta z + \\delta } } } \\right)\\ ] ] where @xmath137 , @xmath138 , integer , @xmath8 ral @xmath139 .",
    "the numbers @xmath140 determine the eigenvalues of the representation @xmath141 in order to calculate the state sum we need the spherical functions of the irrep of @xmath135 .",

    "as in the case of euclidean @xmath89 invariant model , we take a non degenerate finite triangulation of a 4-manifold .",
    "we consider the 4-simplices in the homogeneous space @xmath148 @xmath149 , the hyperboloid @xmath150 and define the bivectors @xmath151 on each face of the 4-simplex , that can be space - like , null or timelike @xmath152.@xcite    in order to quantize the bivectors , we take the isomorphism @xmath153 with @xmath154 a minkowski metric .    the condition for @xmath151 to be a simple bivector @xmath155 , gives @xmath156    we have two cases :    \\1 ) @xmath157 ; @xmath10 , space - like , @xmath151 time - like ,    \\2 ) @xmath158 ; @xmath10 , time like , @xmath151 space like ( remember , the hodge operator @xmath159 changes the signature )    in case 2 ) @xmath151 is space - like , @xmath160 . expanding this expression in terms of space like vectors , @xmath161 @xmath162 where @xmath163 is the lorentzian space - like angle between @xmath164 and @xmath165 ; this result gives a geometric interpretation between the parameter @xmath8 and the area expanded by the bivector @xmath166 , namely , @xmath167 .",
