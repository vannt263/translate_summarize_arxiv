    "ngc5128 ( ) , at an assumed distance of @xmath6mpc @xcite , is the nearest giant elliptical galaxy and is remarkable in several respects .",
    "it is a powerful radio source with a double - lobed structure extending approximately @xmath7 on the sky @xcite . at the other extreme of scales a central source , less than 0.4 milliarcsec ( @xmath8 0.008pc ) in extent @xcite , is prominent on radio through x - ray images .",
    "this compact object feeds subparsec - scale relativistic outflows that are approximately aligned with , and clearly the generators of , the vast outer radio lobes ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the optical appearance is dominated by a dramatic warped dust lane at least 12@xmath9.5 in e - w extent , which effectively bisects the main body of the elliptical galaxy and almost completely obscures the nucleus and all optical structure in the inner 500 parsecs ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the outer isophotes of  are markedly elongated in p.a . @xmath8",
    "faint shells , associated with both h and co emission , are evident in these outlying parts @xcite .",
    "the somewhat chaotic dust lane , and especially the shells , are strong evidence of a relatively recent merger @xcite which is generally believed ( c.f . @xcite and references therein ) to be responsible for the nuclear activity . h@xmath11 and molecular line observations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) indicate that the nucleus is surrounded by a rapidly rotating massive inner disk of radius @xmath82kpc with a pronounced warp @xcite , a scenario that is supported by modelling of the structure of the obscuring dust seen in near - infrared @xcite images .",
    "submillimetre wavelength emission , apparently thermal in origin , was first observed from  by @xcite , using the single - pixel bolometer ukt14 mounted on the 3.8-m uk infrared telescope with a beam size of @xmath12 .",
    "millimeter - wave continuum observations by @xcite in 22  and 45  beams show an unresolved nuclear source , surrounded by extended thermal emission seen by @xmath13 at 50 and 100 and which is roughly co - extensive with a region of strong co molecular line emission .",
    "more extensive submm continuum observations were made by @xcite , who mapped the galaxy using the smaller beamsize of @xmath14 afforded by ukt14 mounted on the 15-m james clerk maxwell telescope ( jcmt ) .",
    "although extended emission was visible in their images , these were not sensitive enough to reveal much detailed structure beyond a general extension corresponding to the optical dust lane and a brighter , elongated , central feature , with an apparently thermal spectrum , surrounding the strong , flat - spectrum nuclear source .",
    "presents new high - quality images of  obtained at submm wavelengths , that are sensitive in particular to emission from cold interstellar dust .",
    "these resolve the structure of the inner disk down to scales of about @xmath15 ( @xmath16pc ) , while also revealing details not previously seen of the faint outer dust emission at large radii .",
    "recently , @xcite used isocam , the infrared ( ir ) imager on the _ infrared space observatory _ ( @xmath17 ) , is an esa project with instruments funded by esa member states ( especially the pi countries : france ( for isocam ) , germany , the netherlands and the united kingdom ) with participation of isas and nasa . ] to obtain images at mid - ir wavelengths , and these results are compared , together with observations at other wavelengths , with those presented in .",
    "re - processed @xmath13 data were re - processed using hires routines at nasa / ipac which is operated by the jet propulsion laboratory , caltech , under contract to the national aeronautics and space administration . ]",
    "data are also presented to complement the detailed study of the dust properties in the disk .",
    "centaurus a presents special challenges for observations at submm wavelength from mauna kea since it never rises more than 28  above the southern horizon . images were nevertheless obtained using the submm wavelength bolometer array scuba @xcite during several observing periods with the jcmt during 1998 .",
    "the simultaneous 850 and 450  images were obtained during three nights ( ut 1998 march 29 , april 9 and april 11 ) during a period in which sky conditions were exceptionally transparent , with zenith opacities often as low as 0.1 and 0.4 or better at 850 and 450 respectively .",
    "the data were taken using the `` jiggle - mapping '' mode of scuba , which provides a densely - oversampled image with a spacing of 2@xmath18.18 , and each observation results in a field about 2@xmath19.3 in diameter .",
    "the array orientation rotates with respect to the sky as the observation progresses , further sampling the image plane .",
    "a series of seven overlapping field centers were observed , placed 55  apart along a line at a position angle of 120  ( north through east ) , roughly corresponding to that of the dust lane of .",
    "the chop throw was 120  perpendicular to this line .",
    "the strong overlap ( more than 50% ) between neighboring fields compensated for the limited rotation of  with respect to the scuba arrays , offsetting the effect on the final reduced images of occasional excessively noisy pixels .",
    "a different subset of the seven fields was observed on each of the three nights .",
    "since the bright nuclear source appears on the central three fields , it was observed at least twice per night , which allowed corrections for pointing drifts to be measured and applied to the final images .    to determine the beam pattern of the jcmt",
    ", the bright unresolved blazar 3c279 was observed each night using the same jiggle - pattern mode as applied to .",
    "atmospheric opacities were determined from skydips made at intervals during the observing , and instrumental gains were derived from images of the jcmt secondary calibrators crl618 , irc+10216 and iras16293@xmath202422 ( sandell 1994 , 1998 ) . the imaging data analysis was undertaken using the dedicated scuba data reduction software surf @xcite , as well as kappa , gaia and convert software packages provided by the starlink project . the data reduction consisted of first flatfielding the array images , and then correcting for atmospheric extinction .",
    "next , pixels significantly noisier than the mean were blanked - out ; and , after initial inspection of raw images , pixels containing relatively little flux from the source were used to correct for correlated sky noise in each individual jiggle - map .",
    "corrections for pointing drifts were incorporated in the final images using the fields in which the core source appeared .",
    "the apparent core source size was reduced from 9.24 to 8.42 ( fwhm ) at 450after the inclusion of these corrections .",
    "an image at 850  had been previously obtained under somewhat worse conditions on ut 1998 february 14 , 15 and 16 .",
    "this image was made using the `` scan - mapping '' mode and covers an area 4  square centered on the bright core source . despite the lower quality of this dataset",
    ", it provides a useful comparison dataset for the reality of features in the two 850  images .",
    "the sky transmission was not good enough on this occasion for the simultaneous 450  data to be useful .",
    "the instrumental gains for the `` scan - mapping '' mode observations are 20% less than those typical for the `` jiggle - mapping '' mode ; therefore , the gains have to be determined separately for the individual modes .",
    "the beam in the 850``scan - mapping '' image of  in this paper is slightly larger than in the `` jiggle - mapping '' images and the photometry differences between the two final maps are within and proportional to the uncertainties : the percentage differences are larger in the less sensitive parts of the maps .",
    "the images of  at 850 and 450  obtained from the combined `` jiggle - map '' datasets are about 6  long and 2  wide ( respectively 7kpc and 1.7kpc at ) and cover much of the dust disk .",
    "the 850 and 450  maps , which respectively have rms noise values of 5 and 20mjy / beam , are shown in figure  [ fig : jiggles ] .",
    "figure  [ fig : scanmap ] shows the 850@xmath3 m  image obtained from the `` scan - mapping '' observations , which has an rms noise of 25mjy / beam .",
    "the submm images show extended emission centered on the nucleus of and oriented at a position angle of about 115  ( north through east ) on the plane of the sky , in roughly the same orientation as the prominent optical dust lane . within about @xmath21 at both 850 and 450 ,",
    "the emission has a much higher surface brightness than at larger radii .",
    "the bright structures have a reversed s - shape suggestive of spiral structure or , as proposed by @xcite , a bar .",
    "the central source has a flux density per beam at least 40 times brighter than the surrounding emission from the dust lane , as shown in the profiles along the major axis in figure  [ fig : profiles ] .",
    "furthermore , the close resemblance of the central source to the profiles of the jcmt beam ( line with crosses in figure  [ fig : profiles ] ) , shows the source is unresolved .",
    "the point - source core has been isolated from the extended emission and separate submm - to - ir spectral energy distributions ( hereafter sed ) have been constructed for the core and extended galactic emission .",
    "these are discussed in section  [ sec : disk ] .",
    "figure  [ fig : overlays ] shows the 450  contours , our highest resolution new scuba image , superimposed on a ) an optical waveband ( 395 and 540 nm ) image courtesy of the anglo - australian observatory and b ) the isocam 7  image .",
    "we now discuss these comparisons , as well as what we learn from the 450/850spectral index distribution map , in more detail .",
    "the well - defined reverse - s - shape structure seen in high surface brightness submm emission , within 90  of the galaxy nucleus , is largely indiscernible in optical maps , implying that the denser material around the nucleus , seen in the submm - wavelength images is heavily obscured at optical wavelengths .",
    "however , the southern edge of the se high surface brightness submm emission aligns with the southern ridge of the optical dust lane , in turn suggesting that the se reverse - s - shape structure is on the near - side and therefore relatively less obscured in the optical , as reported by @xcite and @xcite and based on their analyses of mid - infrared versus @xmath22 and near - infrared data respectively .",
    "furthermore , if the submm / optical morphology is a manifestation of a warped dusty disk or spiral structure that is highly inclined to the plane of the sky ( c.f .",
    "section  [ sec : image_impl ] ) , the southern edge is consistent with an inner fold of the disk seen tangent to the line of sight .",
    "such a ridge would have a high column density in the line of sight , as evident in the aligned southern edges of _ high _ surface brightness submm emission and the _ dark _ optical lane .",
    "a very rough estimate can be made of the optical depths detected in the scuba images , allowing a quantitative comparison between the submm emission and optical obscuration . using the emissivity ( i.e. grain absorption coefficient ) from hildebrand ( 1983 ) and assuming a grain temperature of 17k ( c.f .",
    "the diffuse dust in the galaxy ) , a @xmath22-band optical depth of about 10 can be inferred for a surface brightness of @xmath23mjy / beam at 850 , as seen in the low - level emission detected in the current submm images .",
    "dust clouds that are evident in the optical image presented in  are expected to have @xmath22-band optical depths of @xmath24 .",
    "therefore , under reasonable assumptions , the dust lanes seen in the optical obscuration map exhibited here should be detected in the scuba images .",
    "figure  [ fig : overlays ] shows that the low surface brightness submm emission generally follows the optical dust absorption distribution , including the clockwise twists in the east and west of the dust lane .",
    "this submm emission corresponds especially well with the dark optical obscuration in the nw and northern part of the se dust lanes , and also with the very dark twist in the east , indicating that some low level submm emission must arise from the optically prominent dust material .",
    "there is no marked difference between the flux densities of submm low level emission that corresponds with the dark optical obscuration in the northern edge of the se dust lane and the low level emission in the southern ridge of the dust lane : in both regions , the flux densities are in the range @xmath25 to @xmath26mjy / beam and @xmath24 to @xmath27mjy / beam at 450  and 850  respectively .",
    "@xcite find that the extinction along the southern ridge is much more than that in the northern edge of the se dust lane , where it reduces the @xmath28 flux by a factor of 6 compared to a factor of only 1.5 to 2 in the northern edge of the se lane .",
    "therefore , the similarity of the flux densities in the northern and southern low level submm emission despite the higher extinction in the southern ridge indicates that the northern edge of the se dust lane is well in the foreground , in a region of low stellar density , and is thus heated by a more dilute stellar radiation field .    within the length ( major diameter ) of @xmath29 that excludes the clockwise twists",
    ", low surface brightness submm emission extends farther north and south beyond the optical feature : the average width ( minor diameter ) of the dust feature seen in submm emission is @xmath30 compared with the optical obscuration of @xmath31 ( see figure  [ fig : overlays](a ) ) .",
    "the extension is appreciably marked in the south , where the dust giving rise to the submm emission here lies on the far - side of the galaxy and is overlain by the stellar body .",
    "consistent with this scenario , when @xcite removed the effects of foreground dust obscuration from @xmath32 @xmath33 band images , they found a band of residual obscuration , presumably caused by dust within the stars on the farther side of the galaxy .    while it is clear that the maximum width at which the dust lane will be detected in extinction and seen in thermal emission will depend on the relative sensitivity of the two techniques , the width at which the feature is detected in the submm observations ( @xmath34 , c.f .",
    "figure  [ fig : overlays](a ) ) surpasses the maximum width detected in all optical observations we are currently aware of , including the recent @xmath32 @xcite and vlt observations ( @xmath35 ) , supporting the assertion that the low - level submm emission extends well beyond the optical obscuration .",
    "@xcite presented images of  at 7 and 15  obtained with isocam as well as early scuba `` jiggle - mapping '' images of a 2  field around the core of the galaxy at 450 and 850@xmath3 m .",
    "they note the similarity of their ir ( isocam ) and submm ( scuba ) images ( which are much less sensitive to faint emission than those presented here ) , observing that there was the `` same general distribution '' between the `` warm '' and `` cold '' dust seen respectively in the isocam and the early scuba image published by them .",
    "conclude that the absence of submm emission from the optical dark lanes  is not due to major differences between the spatial distributions of the cold and very warm dust components , \" attributing the optical dust features to  small amounts of cold dust in the outer parts \" of the system .",
    "the scuba data exhibited in , which have much greater sensitivity and extend much farther from the nucleus than the images published by @xcite , show that there are _ remarkable _ similarities between the appearance of  in the mid - ir and the submm ( see figure  [ fig : jiggles ] , figure  [ fig : overlays](b ) ) .",
    "this is particularly true of the 450 and 7  images , even though their wavelengths differ by a factor of 65 .",
    "both images show the reverse - s - shaped , high surface brightness structure out to 90  from the core and the fainter extensions of this structure out to 120 .",
    "the major _ difference _ is that the submm emission is seen to much larger angular distances than is the mid - ir , and as pointed out above , faint submm emission from some of the more outlying dust in the optical dust lane is evident .",
    "the contours in figure  [ fig : overlays](b ) show a feature extending to about 15  radius from the nucleus in position angle 145 ; this may correspond to that attributed to a circumnuclear torus by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the scuba and isocam images suggest it may represent the inner folds of the reverse - s - shaped structure ( or warped disk , c.f .",
    "section  [ sec : image_impl ] ) mentioned above .      using the 450 and 850  imaging data , the global spectral index distribution of",
    "is derived at submm wavelengths and used to delineate the submm components in the nuclear regions of the galaxy as well as to investigate the dust properties of the extended emission .",
    "the following procedure was used .",
    "the 450  data were first smoothed to the @xmath36 resolution of the 850  map . the spectral index @xmath11 , where @xmath37 , between 450and 850  was then computed as @xmath38}\\bigg{/}\\log{\\left[\\frac{850}{450}\\right ] } , \\label{eqn : alpha}\\ ] ] where @xmath39 is the flux density per beam at each point in the map . the uncertainty in the spectral index",
    "is then given by @xmath40                   \\bigg{/ }                  \\left(\\log{\\frac{850}{450}}\\right)^2 , \\label{eqn : dalpha}\\ ] ] where the variables are as for equation  [ eqn : alpha ] .",
    "the largest probable uncertainty in @xmath41 arises from the calibration , especially for the 450  flux densities .",
    "the maximum uncertainty in our final map is estimated as @xmath42 and the mean uncertainty as @xmath43 .",
    "the uncertainty in the regions with @xmath44 is most probably underestimated as this is also the region of the map with the least sensitivity .    the spectral index map of  between 450 and 850is shown in figure  [ fig : spec ] .",
    "there are four regions apparent in the map .",
    "contours at the spectral indices 2.0 ( dashed lines ) and 3.0 and 3.3 ( solid lines ) are overlayed to guide the eye to the less obviously manifested features . in the nuclear area , the unresolved core and a feature apparently representing the inner jet are distinguished .",
    "farther from the nucleus we can discern , with progressively increasing spectral indices , the bright , reverse - s - shaped structure , familiar from the intensity maps , and the fainter outer dust , roughly corresponding to the optical dust lane ( see section  [ sec : vs_optical ] ) .",
    "the spectral index of the * unresolved core * is close to zero , consistent with the nonthermal spectrum from an agn nucleus .",
    "this paper confirms that the core source has a flat submm spectrum ( i.e. @xmath45 ) , which is common for bl lacs ( blazars ) ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) , and as @xcite and @xcite have noted , suggests that  may harbor a low - luminosity blazar .",
    "the feature which  refers to as the * inner jet * is not evident on the intensity maps but is prominent in figure  [ fig : spec ] as ( green - blue ) areas of low spectral index to the ne and sw of the nucleus .",
    "the spectral index of these features is in the range @xmath46 ( see dashed contour lines ) .",
    "the northern extension is coincident with the inner radio jet @xcite , which , as implied by the designation in , is not considered to be merely by chance .",
    "however , the observed spectral index is much higher than would be expected from extrapolation of the power - law spectrum of the radio jet itself .",
    "one possible explanation is that the submm spectrum is not a manifestation of the electron distribution of the relativistic radio jet itself ( or the jet overlaid by a warm dust component ) , but rather of some internal mechanism ( e.g. ionization of gas ) resulting from the interaction of the jet and the ism in the inner regions of the galaxy .",
    "@xcite and others have proposed that optical jets in galaxies such as  may be due to emission from interstellar gas that has been entrained and heated by the flow of relativistic particles from the nucleus .",
    "the entrained gas would generate free - free continuum emission with spectral index , in the optically thick case , of @xmath47 , consistent with the observed spectral range of the inner jet @xmath48 .",
    "we attribute the southern nuclear extension in our submm spectral map to the same mechanism , though in this case associated with the fainter counter jet recently reported by @xcite and @xcite , respectively from their high resolution vlbi radio and @xmath49 x - ray images .",
    "a similar interaction of the jet and interstellar medium was proposed by @xcite based on their near - ir observation of the inner jet of , which manifested itself as a region of bluer color , with spectral index @xmath50 , coincident with the radio jet .",
    "@xcite also reported a ` blue channel ' coincident with the radio jet , but they attributed it to low extinction resulting from relatively low concentration of dust that has been mechanically ` evacuated ' by the jet .  disagrees with this interpretation",
    "as there is no sign of a deficiency of emission on the 450  map at this location : the inner jet feature of figure  [ fig : spec ] arises from a relative enhancement of emission at 850  in these locations .",
    "the spectral index of the * inner disk * is in the range @xmath51 , consistent with thermal emission from dust .",
    "the lowest indices occur in an almost circular region about 30  in radius around the nucleus ; this is coincident with an area of hot molecular gas reported by @xcite from their @xmath32 observations .",
    "emission with a steeper spectrum ( @xmath52 , see solid contour lines ) approximately traces the inner disk of brighter structures seen in the 7 and 450  images ( see section  [ sec : vs_iso ] and figure  [ fig : overlays]b ) out to @xmath8 90@xmath18 .",
    "farther still from the nucleus , in the fainter * outer disk * the spectral index increases to @xmath53 .",
    "as underscored by the solid line contours in figure  [ fig : spec ] , the spectral index is asymmetric about the nucleus in the inner disk region of the map : it is somewhat flatter on the eastern part of the inner disk , indicating slightly different relative distributions of dust grains on either side of the nucleus .",
    "if the dust seen in the maps presented in  is emitting with spectral index @xmath54 ( where @xmath55 is the emissivity index ) , the spectral index in the extended region implies that for a given temperature , the dust in  has on average a low @xmath55 .",
    ", i.e. the dust is made of relatively large grains , and that its temperature is fairly cool .",
    "furthermore , the somewhat flatter spectral index in the south - east suggests the dust in this region is made of smaller grains with moderately warmer temperatures than those in the same region in the nw .",
    "this is not surprising as the se is reported to exhibit stronger h emission @xcite , weaker @xmath56co(1 - 0 ) and stronger h@xmath11 line emission compared to the nw , that led @xcite to speculate that star - formation and its associated high radiation field were greater in the se .",
    "the uncertainty in the emissivity analysis in our spectral index map ( figure  [ fig : spec ] ) does not permit us to quantitatively examine the effects , if any , due to diffuse `` cirrus '' grains in the map .",
    "the dust in the outer disk , where the emissivity index @xmath57 , may well consist of `` cirrus '' grains , which , as it is generally accepted ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , would have an emissivity index close to @xmath58 and temperatures @xmath59k . @xcite",
    "associated the far - ir emission outside the molecular star - forming disk ( ie .",
    "radius @xmath60 ) with `` cirrus '' clouds with scale height larger than that of the molecular gas disk .",
    "they predicted that the submm extended emission would also originate from dust constituting `` cirrus '' grains as could well be the case .",
    "the large western and eastern warps seen in the 850@xmath3 m and 450@xmath3 m images ( see figure  [ fig : jiggles ] ) resemble the distribution of the emission @xcite , indicating that , if the dust in the warp features ( and the general outer disk ) in  is composed of `` cirrus '' grains , the emission traces the `` cirrus '' dust in ngc5128 just as in the milky way .",
    "our submm images demonstrate that outlying dust in  is significantly cooler than the material in the bright elongated features within @xmath61 of the nucleus .",
    "this is naturally to be expected : at larger radii the ambient radiation field heating the dust is more dilute because of the much lower density of stars @xcite .",
    "the emission from this dust generally follows the optical dust lane .",
    "the warped disk model proposed by @xcite and explored by @xcite , consisting of tilted rings of material , predicts the structure of such warmer and colder material , respectively seen in the mid - ir and far - ir to submm , rather well .",
    "this scenario is supported by @xcite , who showed that a warped structure of tilted rings explained not only the line emission in the disk of @xcite , but also a complex absorption - line system towards the nucleus , without a need for any additional structures .    from their @xmath17 7 and 15  images ,",
    "@xcite conclude from a comparison with similar mid - ir images of the dwarf barred spiral ngc1530 that the structure imaged in the mid - ir in  is itself a barred spiral : the prominent emission peaks @xmath62 from the nucleus at each end of the bright mid - ir and submm structures are hypothesised to be foreshortened arms twisting anti - clockwise from the outer ends of the bar .",
    "@xcite support this proposal from their @xmath63 and 15  study of , noting too that the warm dust seen by isocam contributes little to the extinction seen at optical wavelengths .",
    "kinematics is clearly important in understanding the true nature of the near - nuclear structures in .",
    "@xcite address these in their figure 4 , a comparison of the ir images with the co kinematics in the form of a position - velocity ( p - v ) plot from @xcite . on this figure",
    "they identify the strong co feature extending from @xmath64 , 300kms@xmath65 to @xmath66 , 800kms@xmath65 as the bar , undergoing solid body rotation , and weaker outlying features at nearly constant velocity at larger radii as the `` typical '' rotation curve of galactic disks .    however , an alternative interpretation of the pv diagram is that the `` bar '' represents a nearly - complete , highly foreshortened , ring of material at a radius of @xmath67 ( @xmath68pc ) . in that scenario",
    "the concentrations of ir and submm emission nw and se of the nucleus represent the ends of the ring where the optical depth is maximized .",
    "similarly , the  ew high - velocity feature \" mentioned by @xcite , which they note does not fit their scenario , is readily explained by another ring of molecular material at a radius of @xmath69 ( @xmath70pc ) , tilted relative to the outer ring and evident on the mid - ir images as two small extensions to the nuclear feature in pa 80@xmath71 and 260@xmath71 .",
    "furthermore , the outer features of the pv diagram also have an alternative interpretation : the feature @xmath721@xmath73se of the nucleus has the properties of an arc of material starting at radius of @xmath74kpc and ending perhaps 2kpc from the nucleus close to the minor axis : in an normal edge - on spiral , such a feature would be interpreted as a spiral arm .",
    "@xcite also accept the bar model since its edges appear to be delineated by linear concentrations of star - forming regions seen in their pa@xmath11 images , suggesting that these delineate the shocks normally seen as dust lanes along the leading edges or the midlines of galaxy bars in optical images .",
    "however , they also noted that their data do not rule out a warped ring without a bar , as the star - formation is found in regions of the warp that are tangent to the line of sight , and if the young stars are above or inside the disk , they would indeed appear to be concentrated where the pa@xmath11 emission is seen .",
    "we suggest the latter interpretation is more plausible for the following two reasons .",
    "first , the same elongated distribution of pa@xmath11 emission regions , which @xcite show to coincide precisely with the elongated mid - ir ridge that passes just south of the nucleus , is equally coincident with the dense , narrow , optical dust lane that passes south of the nucleus in figure  [ fig : overlays](a ) .",
    "since this is the _ only _ feature of the bright central complex ( apart from the nucleus itself ) that is potentially identifiable with an optically - visible feature , we suggest that it is not in fact part of the near - nuclear complex at all , but , as suggested by the models of @xcite , a manifestation of an outlying fold or ring in the warped disk .",
    "second , we note that the bar - shocks traced by dust in early - type field spirals are asymmetric about their nuclei , since they lie in the leading edges of the bars , while those in late type systems are centered in the bars . however , the pa@xmath11 emission regions in figure 13 of @xcite pass by several arcsecs south of the nucleus from the se to west of the nucleus .",
    "this is not what would be expected of a shock in a bar in a field spiral , but more the distribution to be expected if the star - forming regions are associated with the trailing dust lanes in a typical spiral arm , or in this case the dusty rings postulated by @xcite .",
    "therefore , the combined evidence to date from the co kinematics , the mid - ir images , the bright and faint submm features and the pa@xmath11 images supports the warped rings model of @xcite rather than indicating the presence of a true bar , and may even represent spiral structure in the dust lane of .",
    "one of the attractions of the bar scenario for both @xcite and @xcite is its expected utility as a mover of material from larger to smaller radii in the disk in order to fuel the agn .",
    "however , since the association of barred structure with the presence of an active nucleus in field galaxies , though long sought , is marginal at best ( c.f .",
    ", for example , @xcite and references therein ) , the presence of the agn can not be taken as an argument for the reality of the putative bar .",
    "not having a bar to fuel the active nucleus is not too great a loss ; e.g. recent work by @xcite suggests that viscosity in a thin gas plane may also provide an efficient agn fuelling mechanism .",
    "has shown that the central source in  is unresolved and has a flux density per beam at least 40 times brighter and a spectrum markedly flatter than the surrounding emission from the dust lane ; i.e. the central source is clearly distinct from the extended emission ( c.f .",
    "sections  [ sec : results_etc ] &  [ sec : sed ] and figure  [ fig : profiles ] & figure  [ fig : spec ] ) . therefore , an analysis of the sed for the extended submm to infrared emission in  is preceded by the isolation of the point - source core from the extended emission and the determination of the respective flux density estimates for these separate components .",
    "adjustments are made when dealing with the jcmt and @xmath17 data , both taken with small beams , and the @xmath13 data , which were obtained with significantly larger beams .",
    "the core flux densities from 850 to 7  are presented in table  [ tbl : fluxes ] , together with integrated flux densities determined for two regions of the extended emission from the dust lane : ( 1 ) an ellipse of @xmath75 the core measurement and ( 2 ) an elliptical annulus of @xmath76 .",
    "the far - ir flux densities are archival @xmath13 data for  that we re - analysed using the hires facility to extract the best possible spatial resolution and to ensure that we have the same registration of the regions from which we determine integrated flux densities .",
    "the ellipse and annulus are denoted respectively as the _ inner disk _ and _ outer disk _ , as the two regions have different submm continuum morphology and spectral index distributions ( see sections  [ sec : vs_iso ] &  [ sec : sed ] ) .",
    "the sed for the two extended regions are plotted in figure  [ fig : disk_spectrum ] , and temperatures as well as dust masses determined for the emission from these regions are discussed below .",
    "the compact core is unresolved on the submm and iso mid - ir images ( fwhm @xmath77 at 450 , @xmath78 at 7 ) , as would be expected if it is predominantly a manifestation of the unresolved central radio source ( c.f .",
    "* ) ) . in the case of the @xmath13 data , the best hires beams achieved in  are still fairly large ( @xmath79 to @xmath21 ) so that the core extent is impossible to constrain and its flux density not easily separable from that of the extended emission . therefore , the ellipse @xmath13 flux densities listed in the table are simply the integrated measurements minus the core flux density of @xmath80jy , at both 100@xmath3 m and 60@xmath3 m , which is an extrapolation from the submm core sed ( @xmath81 , s@xmath82 ) to 60@xmath3 m ( 5000ghz ) .",
    "a full discussion of the sed of the submm core in , and its implications , is outside the scope of this paper ; for an extensive analysis of this matter , see , among many others , @xcite ; and @xcite .",
    "the integrated submm to far - ir flux densities are fit by a two - component , optically - thin modified blackbody of the form @xmath83 ,   \\label{eqn : greybody}\\ ] ] where @xmath84 is the observed flux density at frequency @xmath85 , @xmath86 the solid angle for the modified blackbody component , @xmath87 the planck function at temperature @xmath88 , @xmath89 the wavelength at which the optical depth is unity and @xmath55 the emissivity index of the grains .",
    "first , a 12k and 40k two - component modified blackbody with dust emissivity index of 1.3 fits the data for the _ inner disk _ , and secondly , a 12k and 30k modified blackbody with dust emissivity index of 1.6 fits the data for the _ outer disk _",
    "figure  [ fig : disk_spectrum ] ) .",
    "these fits , in particular the derived relative emissivities and temperatures , are consistent with the spectral index maps , showing that the average dust temperature decreases from the galactic core outwards",
    ". unsurprisingly , these temperatures are also consistent with the 42k and 32k determined by @xcite from their 50 and 100  @xmath13 flux densities alone , as well as the average @xmath25k determined by @xcite from their 40 to 100 lws maps of the _ inner disk _ region .",
    "the mass of emitting dust @xmath90 can then be estimated from ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) @xmath91 where @xmath84 is the measured flux density at frequency @xmath85 , @xmath92 is the distance to the source , @xmath93 the planck function and @xmath94 the grain mass absorption coefficient where @xmath95 and @xmath96 are respectively the grain radius and density .",
    "values of @xmath97 and @xmath98 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) are assumed , yielding dust masses of @xmath99 for @xmath100k and @xmath101 for @xmath102k in the _ inner disk _ and dust masses of @xmath103 for @xmath104k and @xmath105 for @xmath102k in the _ outer disk_.",
    "the total mass for the dust that emits from the far - ir through the submm wavelength is then @xmath106 and @xmath107 , respectively in the _ inner disk _ and _ outer disk _ , giving an overall total of @xmath108 for the dust lane region of the galaxy we have observed ( ie .",
    "radii @xmath109 or @xmath110kpc ) .",
    "the advantage of using optically thin submm emission to determine the dust mass is , unfortunately , offset by the increased uncertainty in the properties of dust and subsequently of @xmath111 , as @xmath112 is increased from the far - ir to submm wavelengths .",
    "a different choice of @xmath111 could result in an estimation of the dust mass that differs by a factor as large as @xmath24 @xcite .",
    "the dust mass derived in  in a region of radius @xmath113 ( the _ inner disk _ ) is at the lower end of the dust mass of @xmath114 derived by @xcite from their @xmath115 m spatial distribution map in the same area .",
    "this is surprising because they reported the estimate was from dust in the `` bar+arms of a mini - spiral , excluding any diffuse dust . ''",
    "however , given the uncertainty , the mass in  for the _ inner disk _ dust is at least _ consistent _ with @xcite .",
    "the scuba 850 and 450  images in  show that the submm continuum morphology and spectral index distribution of  comprise :    1 .   * the nucleus * and associated structures : a distinct , unresolved , flat - spectrum agn core with circumnuclear structure , including , to the northeast and southwest , areas of low spectral index which we suggest arise from free - free emission in ionised gas entrained in the nuclear outflow ; 2 .",
    "* inner disk : * a prominent , elongated feature that may be a circumnuclear ring ( or bar ) extends across the center of the galaxy out to a radius of @xmath61 .",
    "it contains considerable real structure , including concentrations of emission towards its ends and a reverse - s - shaped twist ; this structure appears reflected about the nucleus .",
    "the details of this structure are very similar indeed to what is seen on mid - ir @xmath17 images , so the cooler dust seen in the sub - mm is very closely co - extensive with the much warmer material ( transiently heated by uv - photon absorption ) seen at 7 and 15@xmath3 m , and which establishes that the _ inner disk _ is a locus of vigorous star formation .",
    "it is also a strong source of co emission with kinematics consistent with a ring or rings of gas around the nucleus , rather than a bar , as has been suggested elsewhere @xcite .",
    "* outer disk and outlying dust features : * low - level emission , at least some of which comes from the foreground material in the prominent optical dust lane , extends to the eastern , and probably to the western , end of our maps .",
    "it traces the clockwise twist of the optical feature . + some of the observed low - level emission does _ not _ coincide with optically - visible dust .",
    "the sensitive scuba images are , for the first time , showing the direct detection of emission arising from dust that is in the far side of the galaxy , overlaid and obscured by the stellar component of ngc5128 , and thus not seen in optical images .",
    "a warped disk model consisting of tilted rings @xcite predicts the structure of the warmer and colder material , especially in the _ inner disk _ , rather well .",
    "it appears that in this vicinity the ir and submm images to a large extent reveal the same material ; however , at larger radii , the dust is cooler because it is immersed in a much less intense stellar radiation field .",
    "alternative arguments are presented in papers by @xcite and @xcite , who interpret the mid - ir ( and brighter submm ) structures as a true barred spiral .    using the continuum integrated flux densities from far - ir through submm wavelengths ,",
    "derives a total dust mass of @xmath116 within a radius of @xmath117 of the nucleus of .",
    "about 45% of the dust mass is in the star - forming _ inner disk _ within about @xmath118 of the nucleus .",
