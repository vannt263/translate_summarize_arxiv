    "it is generally expected that high energy ( he ) galactic cosmic rays ( crs ) have a random arrival time ; but it was also suggested that crs coming from a nearby pulsar , a nearby supernova - like event , etc . could show modulation effects @xcite . some early experiments reported non - random components in the arrival times of he cosmic rays",

    "macro was a large multipurpose detector installed in hall b of the gran sasso national laboratories ( lngs ) at the minimum depth of overburden rock of 3200 mwe ( average depth of 3600 mwe ) .",
    "the detector had a modular structure consisting of six supermodules ( sms ) each of dimensions 12 m x 12 m x 9.3 m. it was made of three horizontal layers of liquid scintillation counters , 14 horizontal layers of streamer tubes , one horizontal layer of nuclear track detectors and seven layers of rock absorbers .",
    "the vertical sides were closed by six layers of streamer tubes and one layer of scintillators .",
    "the complete detector was thus a nearly `` closed box '' with a total length of 76.7 m @xcite ; it had a lower part 4.8 m high , with 10 horizontal layers of streamer tubes , two layers of scintillators and seven layers of rock absorber .",
    "the upper part ( `` attico '' ) contained also the electronics .",
    "the main goals of the experiment were the search for rare particles , like magnetic monopoles and nuclearites @xcite , the study of atmospheric neutrino oscillations @xcite and the study of downgoing he muons @xcite@xcite .",
    "in this paper we present a high statistics study of the time distributions of downgoing he single , double and multiple muons measured from 1995 till 2000 with the streamer tube system .",
    "the investigation concerns also the time distributions of muons coming from selected directions in the sky .    for each muon arriving at time t@xmath0",
    ", we studied the distribution of the time intervals elapsed from @xmath1 till the arrival times @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 of the next five muons : ( t@xmath7-t@xmath0 ) , ( t@xmath8-t@xmath0 ) , ( t@xmath9-t@xmath0 ) , ( t@xmath10-t@xmath0 ) and ( t@xmath11-t@xmath0 ) .",
    "the present statistics is larger by at least a factor of 20 than those of previous underground experiments @xcite@xcite .",
    "the data selection is discussed in section 2 , the time correlations in section 3 and the conclusions in section 4 .",
    "for this analysis we selected runs according to the following criteria : + a ) run duration greater than two hours , ( the average run duration was about 5 hours ) .",
    "+ b ) muon rates r in the range 840@xmath12r@xmath12960 muons per hour ( corresponding to deviations of less than @xmath13 from the average ) . + c ) acquisition dead time smaller than 0.4% for each of the 3 microvax computers .",
    "+ d ) no errors in the atomic clock ( the arrival time of muons was measured with an atomic clock with a precision of about @xmath14s absolute and 0.5@xmath15s relative ) .",
    "+ e ) no trigger problems .",
    "+ f ) no problems with the streamer tube gas system .",
    "+ g ) streamer tube efficiencies of the wires and strips larger than 90% and 86% , respectively ( the average wire efficiencies for each selected run is about 94% )",
    ".    further selection criteria : + a single muon event should have a track with multiplicity equal to one , both in the wire and strip streamer tube views ; double muon events must have 2 tracks in the wire and strip views and multiple muons have multiplicities from 3 to 6 and reconstructed on both wire and strip views .",
    "2035 runs passed the cuts for a total number of 8600@xmath16 single muons , 460@xmath16 double muons and 80@xmath16 multiple muons .",
    "the primary cosmic ray energy for events with a single muon is larger than 20 tev . for events with",
    "two ( multiple ) muons the mean primary energy is larger than 200 tev ( 1500 tev ) .",
    "the distribution of single muon rates per hour ( taken when the full apparatus was running ) is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : mrate]a .",
    "the average run duration was about 5 hours .",
    "[ fig : mrate]b shows the number of runs versus the muon rate of each run . for the whole apparatus the average rate was 899 muons / hour .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : mrate]a we notice that the counting rate per run shows a regular variation with run number ( time ) .",
    "this is the signature of the seasonal variation of the muon flux due to density and temperature changes of the upper atmosphere .",
    "this effect was discussed in detail in @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite the daily variations in solar and sidereal times were discussed .",
    "these analyses demonstrate the high sensitivity of the detector to study very small ( @xmath17 in magnitude ) time variations of the muon flux .",
    "as already stated , it is expected that galactic crs have a random arrival time distribution because of the direction reshuffling of charged cr particles by random interstellar magnetic fields .",
    "but there may be some mechanisms which introduce time correlations .",
    "one could expect to observe clusters in time for events generated by charged or neutral particles coming from intermittent emissions by nearby sources .    for random arrivals",
    ", the time distribution may be fitted to the gamma function of order m @xcite @xmath18 where , 1/@xmath19 is the mean value of the time difference between two consecutive muons and n is a normalization factor . for m=1 eq .",
    "( 1 ) reduces to an exponential : @xmath20    after each trigger there was a dead time of about 100 ms ( when the whole apparatus was operational ) .",
    "the effect of this dead time is evident in the ( t@xmath7-t@xmath0 ) distribution for ( t@xmath7-t@xmath0 ) @xmath21 100 ms , fig .",
    "[ fig : distrib1 ] . in the present analysis",
    "we do not apply any correction for this dead time , but discarded the first point of the distributiond in the fitting procedure .",
