    "the origin of the matter asymmetry is a deep mystery that remains unsolved .",
    "conditions that can lead to a dynamical asymmetry between baryons and anti - baryons were articulated years ago by sakharov @xcite : baryon number violation , c and cp violation , and a departure from thermal equilibrium .",
    "all three conditions are satisfied by the standard model as it passes through the electroweak phase transition .",
    "but , the cp violation is too small @xcite , and the phase transition is not strongly first - order ( e.g. , @xcite ) , given the direct search bounds on the higgs boson from lep .",
    "new physics with large cp violation is trivial to introduce into the model ; weak scale supersymmetry is an obvious example ( care needs only to be taken to ensure that induced electric dipole moments are within the experimental bounds ) .",
    "even with a new source of cp violation , if the phase transition is not strong enough first - order , any generated baryon asymmetry will be washed out @xcite .",
    "new physics that enhances the first - order phase transition , however , is generally much more tricky to achieve .    in the early 1990s",
    "it was realized that the electroweak phase transition could be enhanced by modifying the cubic coupling of the finite - temperature effective potential @xcite .",
    "nontrivial modifications of the cubic coupling could arise from additional scalars with order one couplings to the higgs . in the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) ,",
    "the scalar superpartners to the top quarks ( stops ) can play precisely this role @xcite .",
    "it has long been advocated that the region of mssm parameter space with a light stop ( and a light higgs ) can yield a strong enough phase transition .",
    "unfortunately , the combination of direct searches for the lightest higgs boson and direct searches for stops have virtually ruled out this possibility .",
    "the remaining parameter space @xcite requires a large hierarchy between the left - handed and right - handed stops to ensure the higgs satisfies the lep bound .",
    "methods to strengthen the first - order phase transition beyond the sm and mssm are now widely discussed @xcite .",
    "several of these ideas add a singlet field , such as in the nmssm or nmssm .",
    "another related idea is to simply cutoff the sm at a low scale , adding the effects of higher dimensional operators @xcite ( which can be uv completed by integrating out a singlet ) .",
    "yet another interesting possibility , and the one we will focus on in this paper , is to add more particles with modestly strong couplings to the higgs .",
    "this was proposed in @xcite ; the additional particles have quantum numbers such that they mix with the mssm charginos and neutralinos .",
    "heavy particles that receive their mass entirely or dominantly from electroweak symmetry breaking can have a substantial impact on the electroweak phase transition .",
    "in this paper we consider a modification to the mssm similar in spirit to @xcite to enhance the phase transition .",
    "namely , we add a fourth generation of particles ( and sparticles ) to the mssm .",
    "larger couplings to the higgs are automatic simply due to the direct search bounds from lep and tevatron on fourth generation fermions .    that the electroweak phase transition could be enhanced in a four generation supersymmetric model",
    "was considered before in @xcite .",
    "they performed an interesting numerical study that also found that the electroweak phase transition can be enhanced when @xmath5 is not much larger than 1 .",
    "however , the present limits on fourth generation quark masses rule out their parameter space , and moreover , they allowed @xmath6 to far exceed 1 , implying that the @xmath7 yukawa coupling was nonperturbative . in our analysis , we first systematically analyze the origin of the contributions that allow the phase transition to become first - order .",
    "this allows us to make a clear distinction between supersymmetric and non - supersymmetric theories with heavy chiral fermions .",
    "we then identify the viable region of parameter space where the yukawa couplings are under control ( @xmath8 ) and all other bounds are satisfied .",
    "a fourth generation has historically been thought be strongly disfavored by the absence of flavor mixing , the @xmath9 constraint , and electroweak precision data .",
    "all of these objections can be straightforwardly overcome , as was recently emphasized in @xcite .",
    "below we summarize these results in the form of the parameter space that is allowed .",
    "it is interesting that the constraints from electroweak precision data can be overcome without or with an electroweak scale majorana mass for the fourth generation right - handed neutrinos .",
    "if a majorana mass does indeed exist , lepton number is violated at the electroweak scale , and thus scenarios of baryogenesis that rely on an earlier generation of @xmath10 number ( such as leptogenesis ) do not work here @xcite .",
    "electroweak baryogenesis is one of the few mechanisms not sensitive to this source of lepton number violation , and thus becomes even more interesting to study .",
    "we consider a low energy supersymmetric theory with a fourth chiral generation of matter , the `` 4mssm '' ( for an early discussion , see @xcite ) .",
    "a fourth chiral generation of matter does affect electroweak precision observables .",
    "one of the main results of @xcite was to show that it can be made completely consistent with electroweak precision data so long as there are modest mass splittings between the isospin partners in the quark and lepton doublets .",
    "this splitting causes a modest reduction in the positive contribution to s , simultaneous with a positive contribution to t , allowing ensembles of parameters that are within the 68% cl ellipse of the lep electroweak working group .",
    "for example , the mass spectrum @xmath11 gev , @xmath12 gev , @xmath13 gev , @xmath14 gev , and @xmath15 gev is perfectly acceptable .",
    "there is strong sensitivity to the mass _ differences _ with only mild sensitivity to the overall scale of the particles .",
    "we will present results for both the electroweak preferred ratio @xmath16 as well as @xmath17 for comparison .",
    "with supersymmetry , there are additional contributions to electroweak precision observables from superpartners ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "we have not included these contributions to optimize the parameter set to match electroweak data , simply because many more parameters enter the fit that can be freely adjusted without affecting our results for the electroweak phase transition .",
    "we therefore take fourth generation yukawa couplings consistent with @xcite and take the scalar partner masses to be degenerate , eliminating this potential additional contribution to isospin violation .",
    "we neglect all sub - leading contributions to the zero - temperature and finite temperature effective potential .",
    "sub - leading here refers to couplings smaller than about 1 .",
    "we retain the contributions from gauge bosons .",
    "but we neglect light fermions ( u , d , c , s , b , e,@xmath18,@xmath19 ) , higgs bosons ( the quartic is small ) , and all superpartners other than @xmath20",
    ". we also neglect contributions from fourth generation leptons because the number of degrees of freedom per particle is only @xmath21 that of quarks and the bounds on the mass from the non - observation in experiment are much weaker than for quarks .",
    "in the limit @xmath23 , several aspects of supersymmetry drastically simplify . from the definition of @xmath24",
    ", we see the vevs are equal , @xmath25 , where @xmath26 gev , and the yukawa couplings @xmath27 are the same for the up - type and down - type fermions .",
    "the fourth generation quarks @xmath28 and @xmath7 have large yukawa couplings , @xmath29 where @xmath30 gev is shown for convenience in comparison to the ( approximate ) present direct search bounds from the tevatron @xcite .",
    "note that these yukawa couplings are a factor of @xmath31 larger than in a non - supersymmetric model , since the @xmath28 and @xmath7 acquire their mass only through couplings to the up - type and down - type higgs , respectively .",
    "if @xmath32 , either the up - type or down - type higgs vev is reduced , and thus to hold the masses of the fermions fixed , either @xmath33 or @xmath34 must increase .",
    "setting @xmath22 allows the largest possible physical fourth generation fermion masses with the smallest yukawa couplings .",
    "since @xmath35 can not be arbitrarily large for perturbative calculations at the weak scale to be valid , the parameter choice @xmath22 really just maximizes the cutoff scale of the model .",
    "even with this adjustment , the cutoff scale is low .",
    "this can be estimated by running the one - loop renormalization group equations for the yukawa couplings up to @xmath36 .",
    "we show the scale of the landau pole as function of fermion mass in fig .  [ landaupoles - fig ] .    )",
    ".,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    note that requiring @xmath37 , implies @xmath38 , corresponding to @xmath39 gev ; we will not consider fermion masses that much exceed this value .    in the limit @xmath23 the higgs sector",
    "also drastically simplifies .",
    "the tree - level potential in the mssm with @xmath22 is @xcite @xmath40 expanding the neutral components as @xmath41 where the @xmath42 rotation matrix diagonalizes the higgs fluctuations ( @xmath43 , @xmath44 ) into mass eigenstates . in the limit",
    "that the second higgs doublet `` decouples '' ( @xmath45 ) , the mixing angle @xmath46 , and thus the lightest higgs is simply @xmath47 . in this limit the tree - level higgs potential vanishes , since @xmath43 corresponds to the excitation of a @xmath48-flat direction .",
    "since electroweak precision data prefers @xmath49 , this could be arranged either by adjusting just these two yukawa couplings @xmath50 or instead adjusting @xmath51 .",
    "these two scenarios are nearly equivalent for our purposes , and so we choose to set @xmath22",
    ". the alternative , @xmath51 , would give a tree - level contribution to the higgs potential . the contribution to the ( mass)@xmath52 is however just @xmath53 .",
    "as we will see , the one - loop radiative corrections from quarks and squarks will be far larger than this , so it is safe to completely neglect tree - level contributions even if @xmath6 were allowed to vary slightly from @xmath54 .",
    "in addition to taking @xmath22 , we also choose supersymmetric parameters such that the mass eigenstates of @xmath55 and @xmath56 correspond to the gauge eigenstates @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "this is done purely to simplify our calculation .",
    "it is a rather conservative approximation , since it is well known that increasing the off - diagonal contribution to the squark mass matrix leads to an enhancement in the one - loop contribution to the higgs mass ( e.g. , see @xcite ) .",
    "we expect that the parameter space with a strong first - order phase transition will enlarge as this restriction is relaxed .",
    "note that since the off - diagonal left - right contribution to the up - type and down - type squark mass matrix is equal to @xmath59 ( where again , @xmath22 ) , this simplification corresponds to the specific parameter choice @xmath60 .",
    "finally , as we discussed above , the higgs potential simplifies in the limit @xmath61 .",
    "this is a common assumption in the electroweak phase transition literature : the operational advantage is that the low energy theory is effectively a one - higgs - doublet model that is drastically simpler to analyze at finite temperature .",
    "in the 4mssm with @xmath22 , loop corrections entirely determine the higgs potential .",
    "we are interested in the loop corrections to just the scalar fluctuation @xmath62 . at one - loop the effective potential for the higgs is determined from the coleman - weinberg potential @xmath63 where @xmath64 are the field - dependent masses and @xmath18 is the renormalization scale ( @xmath65 scheme ) .",
    "we generally use @xmath66 to refer to @xmath67-dependent ( and temperature - dependent ) masses and @xmath68 to refer to @xmath69 at zero temperature .",
    "the @xmath70 s are constants corresponding to @xmath71 for gauge bosons and @xmath72 for fermions and scalars .",

    "evidently the minimum is not necessarily located at the proper electroweak breaking scale @xmath26 gev .",
    "this is easily remedied by imposing a renormalization condition on the mass parameter such that the minimum is enforced to be at @xmath80 .",
    "this amounts to adding the @xmath80-dependent contribution to the effective potential , @xmath81    the masses used in the effective potential are @xmath65 masses that differ from the physical ( pole ) masses through finite and log - dependent corrections .",
    "the running fermion masses are given at one - loop by @xmath82 \\ ; .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] since the fourth generation fermions overwhelmingly dominate the contributions to the ( zero- and finite - temperature ) effective potential , we take @xmath83 , i.e. , the scale of the largest electroweak breaking masses in the problem .",
    "this tends to minimize the higher order corrections to the potential , though are calculations are not particularly sensitive to the precise choice of renormalization scale .",
    "the running scalar masses also differ from their physical pole masses through one - loop corrections depending on not only the gluon but also gluino diagrams @xcite .",
    "this correction is generally numerically smaller than the correction to the fermion mass , typically less than a few % .",
    "moreover , since the correction is gluino mass - dependent , relating the pole mass to the running mass requires specifying an otherwise unfixed parameter in our model .",
    "we choose instead to simply take @xmath84 , thus neglecting the difference between the pole and running mass for the squarks .",
    "the finite - temperature contributions to the effective potential are @xcite @xmath85 where @xmath86 and @xmath87 the field - dependent fermion and scalar masses are @xmath88 explicit expressions for the thermal masses of the sm gauge bosons can be found in , e.g. , ref .",

    "this approximation is generally not appropriate .",

    "is only relevant for the longitudinal components of the @xmath91 and @xmath92 .",
    "no contributions from scalars are included here since the squarks receive a contribution from soft supersymmetry breaking , and thus they remain heavy in the @xmath93 limit .",
    "we have self - consistently included contributions in the finite - temperature effective potential the same as those included in the zero - temperature effective potential .",
    "namely , we include contributions from @xmath94 , their superpartners @xmath95 , as well as the transverse and longitudinal components of @xmath96 .    in the standard model ,",
    "the electroweak phase transition becomes second order when the higgs mass approaches 70 gev @xcite .",
    "qualitatively , this is because the transverse modes of @xmath91 and @xmath92 , which would drive a first - order phase transition in the standard model with a lighter higgs mass , develop a thermal mass from non - perturbative effects .",
    "if the transverse thermal masses are large , they effectively remove the cubic term from the finite - temperature potential when the effective potential is reset to zero at @xmath97 . in our model , the first - order phase transition is mostly driven by squarks .",
    "in fact , when the @xmath91 and @xmath92 are neglected in our model , @xmath98 and @xmath99 does not change significantly and the phase transition remains first - order .",
    "therefore , we do not expect non - perturbative effects encountered in the standard model at larger higgs masses to significantly affect our calculations of the strength of the phase transition in the 4mssm .",
    "the effects of heavy particles ( that receive their mass dominantly from electroweak symmetry breaking ) on the electroweak phase transition can be broadly characterized as follows .",
    "consider the effective potential at @xmath99 , where there are two degenerate minima @xmath100 located at @xmath97 and @xmath101 .",

    "we must _ lower _ the temperature further in order to have the second minimum reappear in the effective potential with the new heavy fermion or boson .",
    "the second effect of heavy bosons and fermions is that they also modify the zero - temperature effective potential . here",
    ", however , the effect of fermions and bosons is different .",
    "there are two contributions whose origin is ultimately the coleman - weinberg potential .",
    "one contribution is to the quartic coupling ( [ cw - pot - eq ] ) , while the second contribution is the quadratic term ( [ mass - pot - eq ] ) . for smaller field values ,",
    "i.e. , @xmath114 , the dominant contribution is from the quadratic term .",
    "since we choose @xmath115 , the log term drops out of ( [ mass - pot - eq ] ) , giving an overall _ negative _ ( _ positive _ ) contribution to the effective potential from fermions ( bosons ) .",
    "the negative contribution from fermions at modest field values actually overpowers the effect from the finite - temperature contributions discussed above .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",

    "this cancellation is one - loop exact in the limit @xmath117 , i.e. , no susy breaking contribution to the scalar mass .",

    "we can split not only the top and stops , but also split the fourth generation quarks from squarks . since the one - loop contribution to",
    "the higgs quartic coupling is proportional to @xmath119 , even a small splitting between @xmath120 and @xmath121 has a very important effect on the higgs mass .",
    "a one - loop estimate of the lightest higgs mass in the 4mssm can be obtained by taking @xmath122 at @xmath123 .",
