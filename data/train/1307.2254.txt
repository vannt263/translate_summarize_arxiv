    "gravitational lensing remains a powerful tool for studies of dark matter distribution in the universe .",

    "more et al . (",
    "2012 ) have reported about 127 lens system candidates ( strong lensing legacy survey - arcs ) over 150 sq .",
    "deg in the cfhtls . in that work , they applied semi - automatic techniques to find gravitational arcs with the help of some additional visual inspection .",

    "( 2013 ) studied the statistical color properties of gravitational arcs over 37 sq .",
    "deg . in the cfhtls - archive - research survey and found 73 new arc candidates .",

    "we propose here to search for multiply imaged qsos / agn among the counterparts of x - ray point - like sources detected with xmm .",
    "therefore contrary to the previous approaches , we have been searching for gravitationally lensed qsos / agn at much smaller angular scales ( typically @xmath2-@xmath3 ) .",
    "the search for gravitational lens candidates among the optical counterparts of x - ray selected qsos / agn looked a priori very promising as , first of all , it allows the selection of a sample of qsos / agn with very few contaminants .",
    "moreover , as the x - ray qsos / agn are bright and distant sources ( observed up to a redshift @xmath4 ) , they have a high probability of being multiply imaged due to the presence of a deflector near their line - of - sight .    from lensing probability calculations over a mock catalogue of x - ray sources ( reproducing the redshift distribution and differential number counts of the cosmos x - ray sources as a function of their flux ) , where we have assumed a constant comoving density of deflector galaxies modelled as singular isothermal spheres , we expect @xmath5 qsos / agn among the xmm - lss soft x - ray sources to have a deflector sufficiently close to their line - of - sight to lead to the formation of multiple lensed images of their optical counterpart ( surdej et al . 2011 , finet et al .",
    "2012 ) .",
    "the contiguous @xmath0 deg@xmath6 medium - deep xmm - lss field has been surveyed at high galactic latitudes with the xmm - newton satellite , centered on ra @xmath7 dec @xmath8 ( j2000 ) .",
    "it provides the identification of a homogeneous sample of galaxy clusters and qsos / agn ( pierre et al .",
    "2011 ) and reaches a sensitivity near @xmath9  w  m@xmath10 for point - like sources in the soft band ( elyiv et al .",
    "2012 ) . about @xmath11 of the 6000 point - like xmm - lss x - ray sources have ( an ) optical cfhtls dr6 counterpart(s ) ( chiappetti et al .",
    "visual inspection of all counterparts led us to classify the sources as being either extended or point - like and reject the wrong associations ( melnyk et al .",
    "2013 ) . in this paper",
    "we describe separately the results of our gravitational lens search among the cfhtls counterparts of x - ray sources .    in section 2",
    "we detail the method used to identify multiply imaged qsos / agn in the xmm - lss field . in section 3",
    "we describe the adopted procedure to search for multiply imaged qsos / agn , we discuss each individual candidate and report their color measurements as well as their morphology .",
    "section 4 contains the main conclusions .",
    "our sample of x - ray point - like sources and their optical counterparts consist of objects which have been detected in the soft and/or the hard x - ray band and coming from the multiwavelength catalogue of chiappetti et al .",
    "the @xmath12 optical counterparts of the x - ray sources were visually inspected on @xmath13 cfhtls optical images centered on the x - ray sources .",
    "the angular separations between the lensed images for a typical galaxy deflector and cosmological redshifts of the source ( qso / agn ) and the lens are typically of the order of 1 or several arcsec ( refsdal and surdej 1994 ) . knowing that lensed components should be point - like sources and should have rather similar color properties ( color difference smaller than @xmath14  mag . ) , this selection was also carried out using these strict criteria .",
    "contamination by the lens , intrinsic color variation plus time delay(s ) and/or micro - lensing acting may cause color differences above typical cfhtls photometric errors .",
    "the psf of the xmm - newton telescopes provides a resolution near @xmath15 for a point - like source .",
    "a detected point - like x - ray source may therefore be sometimes identified with multiple ( more than one ) optical counterparts .",
    "we have made an in - depth study of these particular cases in order to detect new gravitational lens systems ( mostly multiply imaged qsos / agn ) .",
    "we inspected _",
    ",  _ r _ and _ i _ cfhtls direct ccd frames whenever they were available . for visual inspection we used the monochromatic images in logarithmic scale for each band as well as the color composed images . for better objectivity four independent members of the present team ( called hereafter",
    " inspectors  ) ranked each counterpart in the following way : @xmath16 - very good candidate , @xmath17 - good lens candidate , @xmath18 - possible lens candidate and @xmath19 - definitely not a candidate .",
    "a similar approach has been followed by more et al .",
    "( 2008 ) when searching for gravitational lenses in the extended chandra deep field south and by jackson ( 2008 ) in the cosmos field .",
    "we finally retained nearly 300 candidates which were marked with the 1 , 2 or 3 rank by at least one inspector .",
    "next we added the ranks from all inspectors and formed a top list of 72 probable lens candidates .",
    "we visually inspected this list several times and removed very faint objects , objects which are obvious stars according to their spectra and so on . at the end",
    ", we finally selected 18 multiply imaged qso / agn candidates which could be potentially strong lens systems , see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] and table  1 .",
    "they are ranked there from the best to worst according to final morphological and color selection .",
    "most of them consist of double sources . for 5 pairs with an angular separation larger than @xmath20 we considered their photometry in the @xmath21 ,  @xmath22 and @xmath23 bands directly from the cfhtls catalog .",
    "we used available spectroscopic or photometric redshifts from sdss and melnyk et al .",
    "( 2013 ) . for the remaining more compact systems we performed a multiple psf fitting analysis to precise their morphology ( point - like or extended source ) and accurate magnitude measurement of each component .",
