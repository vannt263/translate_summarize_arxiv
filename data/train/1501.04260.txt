    "network epidemiology , a branch of mathematical epidemiology which aims to mathematically understand disease spread over networks , has been attracting ever - growing attention  @xcite .",
    "one of the reasons comes from the finding that the heterogeneous structure of real world networks , such as an uneven distribution of the number of neighbors of individuals , can not be ignored to perform an accurate prediction of epidemics  @xcite .",
    "another reason comes from recent advancements of the technologies for collecting a massive amount of data from real human interactions , which enable researchers to build accurate mathematical models of human networks ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "one of the recent achievements of network epidemiology , for example , is the effective prediction of the pandemic of h1n1 influenza on 2009  @xcite .    in the last decade",
    ", the major emphasis of network epidemiology has been on the disease spread over _ static _ networks  @xcite .",
    "this time - invariance assumption enables us to model disease spread as a time - homogeneous markov process , for which an effective approximation by a constant - coefficient differential equation , called an @xmath0-intertwined model , is available  @xcite .",
    "for example it is known  @xcite that the evolution of a certain epidemic model over a static network is characterized by only the maximum real part of the eigenvalues of the adjacency matrix of the network .",
    "however , recently , several simulation studies have reported that the _ dynamical _ nature of human interactions can greatly affect the way epidemics evolve and that static approximations of such dynamical networks may result in inaccurate conclusions  @xcite .",
    "for example , vazquez et al .",
    "@xcite observe that the speed of disease spread can be substantially slowed down on randomly switched networks than on static ones .",
    "the result by volz and meyers  @xcite suggests that the frequency of the change of the topology of network structure is an important factor for the emergence of endemic . in @xcite",
    ", it is numerically confirmed that so - called memory effect of networks can slow down disease spread . despite those simulation results , rigorous understanding of disease spread over dynamical networks based on mathematical analysis",
    "is very limited .",
    "this paper gives an analysis of disease spread over randomly switched networks with the stability theory for switched linear systems called markov jump linear systems  @xcite and the spectral theory of random graphs  ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "we provide sufficient conditions for epidemics to eventually die out over randomly switched networks having independent and markovian edges .",
    "this paper can be considered as a stochastic counter - part of the recently submitted paper  @xcite , where the authors study epidemics over deterministically switched networks .",
    "one of the major difficulties of the problem is in the computational cost .",
    "the stability theory for markov jump linear systems in fact gives a necessary and sufficient condition for epidemics eventually dying out as we will see later ( proposition  [ prop : meanstbl : sigma ] ) .",
    "unfortunately , checking the condition requires finding the maximum real eigenvalue of a matrix with size @xmath2 , where @xmath1 denotes the number of the agents in a network . on the other hand ,",
    "the size of the matrix appearing in the proposed conditions is equal to @xmath1 , which allows us to apply the conditions for large - scale networks .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . after giving the notation used in this paper , in section  [ sec : switchmodel ]",
    "we give the model of disease spread over randomly switched networks .",
    "then section  [ sec : edgeindependent ] gives sufficient conditions for epidemics dying out over randomly switched networks having independent edges .",
    "examples are presented in section  [ sec : degrees ] . finally in section  [ sec : weight ]",

    "the matrix measure  @xcite of @xmath20 is defined by @xmath21 , where @xmath22 denotes the maximum singular value .",
    "when @xmath10 is symmetric and thus has only real eigenvalues , its maximum eigenvalue is denoted by  @xmath23 .",
    "an undirected graph is a pair  @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is a finite and nonempty set and @xmath26 is a set consisting of distinct and unordered pairs  @xmath27 of @xmath28 .",
    "we call the elements of  @xmath25 vertexes and those of @xmath26 edges .",
    "the adjacency matrix  @xmath29 of @xmath30 is defined as the square @xmath31-matrix of size  @xmath32 whose @xmath33 entry is one if and only if . clearly the adjacency matrix of an undirected graph is symmetric and has zero diagonals .",

    "all the markov processes appearing in this paper are assumed to have finite state spaces .",
    "in this section we give a model for the spread of disease over randomly switched networks using switched differential equations .",
    "the model is based on a model called @xmath0-intertwined model originally proposed for epidemics over static networks  @xcite .",
    "then we will review some results on the stability of switched linear systems that will be used in this paper .",
    "we first give an overview of the @xmath0-intertwined model  @xcite for so - called susceptible - infected - susceptible types of disease .",
    "let a population be modeled by an undirected graph  @xmath30 over vertexes @xmath40 .",
    "we regard each vertex as an agent who can be infected and also can transmit disease to its neighbors . in the model , at each time  @xmath41 , each vertex can be in one of the two states : _ susceptible _ or _",
    "infected_. we assume that , when a vertex @xmath36 is infected , the transition to the susceptible state occurs following a poisson process with rate  @xmath42 , called _ curing rate_. on the other hand ,",

    "we assume that our randomly switched network is modeled as @xmath54 , where @xmath55 is a _ time - homogeneous markov process _ taking its values in @xmath56 and @xmath57 are undirected graphs over vertexes @xmath58 .",
    "examples of such random switched graphs include the activity driven networks  @xcite , graphs with edge swapping  @xcite , and temporal exponential random graphs  @xcite .",

    "the principal aim of this paper is to give conditions under which the zero equilibrium of @xmath62 is stable , i.e. , the infection probability @xmath63 converges or stays close to the origin .",

    "theoretically , the next proposition completely solves the problem by giving a necessary and sufficient condition for mean stability via the eigenvalues of a matrix .",

    "then it turns out that these lyapunov functions also apply to @xmath71 around a sufficiently small neighborhood of the origin .",
    "this is because , in such a neighborhood , the second order term  @xmath108 of  @xmath62 can be ignored compared with its linear term .",

    "hence , again by proposition  [ prop : ogurabolzern ] , we obtain @xmath110 .",

    "epidemiologically , the weight @xmath248 expresses the strength of the communication between the agents @xmath36 and @xmath37 , in the sense that instantaneous rate that disease transmits from  @xmath36 to  @xmath37 ( provided @xmath36 is infected and @xmath37 is not ) equals the product  @xmath249 .",
    "this in particular implies that , without loss of generality , we can normalize @xmath250 as @xmath251 by taking @xmath44 sufficiently large .",
    "then , as in section  [ sec : switchedninter ] , let us assume that the weight of the given network of agents changes over time according to a time - homogeneous markov process , i.e. , suppose that there exists a time - homogeneous markov process @xmath83 such that the weight of the graph at time @xmath41 is given by the function @xmath252 .",
    "then we can model the disease spread over time - varying , weighted , and undirected graph @xmath253 by the switched differential equation @xmath254 the almost sure stability of @xmath255 is defined in the same way as definition  [ defn : stability ] .",
    "also , extending definition  [ defn : independent.edges ] , we say that @xmath59 has _",
    "independent edges _ if the stochastic processes  @xmath256 are independent",

    "since @xmath99 is assumed to have finitely many states , each entry of  @xmath258 is a distribution having finite support so that it is straightforward to find @xmath257 .",
    "the next theorem extends theorem  [ thm : independent.edges ] to the weighted and randomly switched networks .",

    "if holds , then @xmath255 is almost surely stable . moreover the minimum @xmath130 can be found by solving the convex program  .    from  @xcite",
    "we can easily check that proposition  [ prop : chungrad ] holds for a weighted random graph as long as its weights are all less than one with probability one and we replace @xmath131 by the maximum row sum of @xmath261 . therefore , under the normalization  , we can apply proposition  [ prop : chungrad ] to the stationary random graph  @xmath132 and prove the theorem in the same way as theorem  [ thm : independent.edges ] .",
