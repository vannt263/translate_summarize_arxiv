    "the observations of the vela pulsar wind nebula ( pwn ) made by chandra x - ray observatory @xcite lead us to examine the published high resolution results of the region @xcite and the archives of the australia telescope compact array ( atca ) to explore whether there was similar radio emission associated with the pulsar .",
    "prompted by the revealing images obtained from the available ( archival ) data , we re - observed with four moderately compact configurations , and two closely spaced frequencies .",
    "correlation data in each integration were folded and binned at the pulsar period ( pulsar binning ) at the highest possible rate ( thirty two bins per period ) .",
    "furthermore we reprocessed archived data at 1.4 and 2.4-ghz .",
    "previous high resolution observations of this region are reported in @xcite using the vla , @xcite using molonglo observatory synthesis telescope ( most ) and @xcite using the atca .",
    "these final two papers discuss results from the same data as we subsequently accessed from the archive .",
    "our observations show an extended radio nebula with symmetric morphology surrounding the pulsar and its x - ray nebula .",
    "we describe our results , compare them to those in the literature , and consider some of the consequences .",
    "all the data were collected at the australia telescope compact array ( atca ) in narrabri ( latitude -30.3@xmath0 ) @xcite .",
    "observations were made at 5.2-ghz with the array in the standard configurations 0.375 , 0.75d , 1.5d and 6d .",
    "the maximum and minimum baselines were 110 and 0.35 k@xmath1 ( angular resolutions of @xmath2 to @xmath3 ) for a total of 42.7 hours .",
    "observations at 8.5-ghz we used the 0.75d , 1.5d and ew352 configurations with a four pointing mosaic , to get full coverage of the extended source .",
    "the maximum and minimum baselines were 130 and 0.6 k@xmath1 ( @xmath4 to @xmath5 ) and data were collected over a total of 38.3 hours . in both cases we observed in two nearby frequencies , with bandwidths of 128 mhz , to ensure that there would be no ambiguities in the rotation measure ( rm ) and to maximise the independent _ uv _ coverage .",
    "we used the atnf correlator mode that divides each integration data into separate phase bins spanning the pulsar period .",
    "this firstly allowed the highly variable pulsar flux to be excluded from the image and secondly allowed us to selfcalibrate ( i.e. derive the antennae phases from the observations ) on the strong signal from the pulsar ( 0.6 jy at 8.5  ghz ) . where the interstellar dispersion smeared the pulse arrival time across the band into several bins ( significant only for observations below 2.4-ghz ) we dedispersed across the multiple spectral channels .",
    "the correlator configuration used for our observations separated the received signal between thirty two pulsar bins . the archived data from 1996 was observed as part of a thirty five pointing mosaic with only one observation covering the pulsar .",
    "they were made with an eight - bin pulsar mode .",
    "the full details are shown in table 1 .",

    "further observations to investigate this are required .",
    "the edges of the lobes in the 5/8-ghz spectral index are remarkably high , but have the poorest signal to noise .",
    "faraday rotation along the sight line from the nebula has been deduced from the multi - frequency observations .",
    "figure [ fig : rm ] shows its variation across the source . after correction for this propagation effect , the intrinsic orientation of the linearly polarised component ( figure [ fig : pa0 ] ) shows a symmetric pattern about the pulsar spin axis projection .",
    "the above rotation measure values imply that there would be some bandwidth depolarisation ( a differential faraday rotation of @xmath8 ) across the 20  cm band .",
    "averaging across the band , however , would only produce a 5% fall in the integrated polarised flux .",
    "this effect could be dealt with , but would add little to our results , and has not been attempted .",
    "polarisation fraction and angle provides one of the greatest diagnostics as to the underlying processes and conditions .",
    "we see in the 5 and 8-ghz observations that the polarisation fraction is high , and approaches the theoretical maximum for synchrotron emission . the polarisation position angles ( associated with the electric field vectors )",
    "are first corrected for faraday rotation , then are rotated further by 90 degrees to view ( as shown in figure [ fig : pa0 ] ) the corresponding magnetic field structure in the emission regions .",
    "a clear signature of toroidal magnetic field with respect to the spin axis of the pulsar is apparent .",
    "a more detailed model of the emission , combining the x - ray and radio data , will be presented in the next paper .      using the latest estimated distance of 0.3  kpc @xcite and using equation 4 from @xcite we find the radio luminosity to be @xmath9 ergs / s , or @xmath10 of the spin down energy , @xmath11 .",
    "this is below the upper limit for twenty seven of the thirty one non - detections of pwn discussed in @xcite .",
    "it may be that the lack of pwn is not due to their intrinsic rarity , but their inefficiency in converting the spin down power into detectable radio emission .",
    "furthermore the assumption of a proper motion powered shock front clearly breaks down as the bright radio emission features are approximately parallel to the proper motion direction and there is no ` wake - like ' feature that can be associated with the known proper motion direction ( which is close to the projected spin axis of the star ) .",
    "we believe we have observed the true extent and morphology of the radio wind nebula associated with the vela pulsar .",
    "the toroidal magnetic field structure revealed by the polarisation data and the symmetric morphology around the projected spin axis of the star ( as in the x - ray case ) argue strongly for the nebula to be pulsar ( rotation ) driven , in terms of both , the recent and continued injection of particles and the ( possibly wound - up ) magnetic fields in the regions of radio emission .",
    "the extension towards the south , seen in the 2.4 and 1.4 ghz images , is unpolarised and thus has a different character from that of the nebula .",
    "the rotation measure along these sight - lines appears insufficient to cause significant depolarisation .",
    "this allows the much more complex region , vela x , to be unambiguously identified with the integrated history of vela s emission , but not driven by the current particle population .",
    "this affects all the estimates of expected pwn brightness based on the vela - x region ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the most striking feature in comparing the x - ray and radio emissions is that the radio emission starts at a distance from the centre where x - ray emission stops .",
    "given the remarkable similarity in the morphologies in the two bands , it is tempting to model the radio nebula on the lines of the available models for the x - ray data . results of our preliminary attempts @xcite to extend the model of @xcite for the radio data have been very encouraging .",
    "a more detailed modelling of the radio data is in progress and will be reported later separately .",
    "the australia telescope compact array is part of the australia telescope , funded by the commonwealth of australia for operation as a national facility , and managed by csiro .",
    "the access of data from the archive was assisted by robin wark .",
