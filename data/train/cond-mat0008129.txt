    "face centered cubic ( fcc ) iron - based alloys are widely used for developing of stainless austenitic steels especially for using in critical temperature ranges , aggressive environment and other severe external conditions .",

    "nitrogen doping enables to solve the problem of the strengthening of stainless steels .",
    "carbon and nitrogen doping differently influence structure and mechanical properties of austenites .",
    "studying of this effect by means of mssbauer spectroscopy determined substantial differences in spectra of carbon and nitrogen austenitic steels ( sozinov 1997 , 1999 ) .",
    "a lot of information , containing in mssbauer spectra as well as high accuracy of measurements lead to the fact that detailed interpretation of these experimental results appears to be a very complicated problem and needs application of high - accuracy theoretical methods .",

    "mssbauer spectroscopy gives the most interesting data about impurity distributions , electronic structure and magnetic interactions in solids .",
    "the study of shifts and splitting of nuclear energy levels gives information about symmetry of charge distributions near the nucleus , electronic configurations of atoms and ions as well as about peculiarities of atomic structure of solids .",
    "we believe that detailed interpretation of these experimental data using single up - to - date _",
    "ab - initio _ approach is an important step in investigation of the influence of light impurities ( c , n ) in case of real fe(fcc ) - based alloys .",
    "up to now there is no full understanding of influence of carbon and nitrogen atoms on atomic and electronic structure of fcc fe - c and fe - n alloys .",
    "based on mssbauer spectroscopy data different authors made different conclusions about atomic structure of carbon and nitrogen fe - based fcc alloys .",
    "for example , the group of genin concluded that carbon distribution in fcc fe - c alloy is close to the ordered fe@xmath0c@xmath1 structure ( bauer 1990 ) . on the other hand , the group of gavriljuk using another method of mssbauer spectrum deconvolution and after performing monte carlo computer simulations showed that formation of the ordered fe@xmath0c@xmath1 structure is improbable ( sozinov 1997 ) .    in this paper",
    "we are trying to solve two problems : to study differences in electronic structure of carbon and nitrogen austenites , and to perform detailed interpretation of mssbauer experimental data for fe - n and fe - c alloys . as an object of our investigations we chose model fe@xmath0c and fe@xmath0n fcc - type superstructures .",
    "the same type of c and n ordering in this structures allow us to determine peculiarities of electronic structure and hyperfine interaction parameters , connected only with different influence of two types of impurity atoms .    calculations were performed by applying highly accurate wien97 programme package ( blaha 1999 ) , which employs full - potential lapw method ( singh 1994a ) .",
