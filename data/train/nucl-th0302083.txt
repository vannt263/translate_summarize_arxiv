    "fermi gases confined to small volumes present distinct finite size effects in their thermodynamic properties . among the different corrections to the bulk behavior , some are smooth functions of the parameters of the system .",
    "they typically depend on geometric aspects of the volume occupied by the gas ( e.g. surface and curvature terms ) .",
    "in contrast , other corrections are fluctuating functions .",
    "these quantum ( or mesoscopic ) fluctuations are related to the discreteness of the single  particle spectrum , and are sensitive to the nature of the dynamics of the particles in the gas . in many cases they are small compared to the bulk , but may play nevertheless an important role ( like , for example , in nuclear physics where shell effects are crucial in the determination of the shape of atomic nuclei @xcite ) . in other ( more spectacular ) situations ,",
    "they provide the dominant contribution .",
    "this occurs for example in the electronic orbital magnetism in quantum dots  where they can be larger than the landau susceptibility @xcite  , or in the persistent currents in mesoscopic rings @xcite  where the bulk contribution vanishes . in all cases",
    "the quantum fluctuations disappear when the temperature is raised .    instead of a detailed computation and description of the quantum fluctuations for a particular system ,",
    "the aim here is to study their statistical properties .",
    "the interest of such an analysis is well known : using a minimum amount of information , a statistical approach allows to establish a classification scheme among the fluctuations of different physical systems .",
    "it also allows to distinguish the generic from the specific , and provides a powerful predictive tool in complex systems . a general description of the statistical properties of the quantum fluctuations of thermodynamic functions of integrable and chaotic ballistic fermi gases , and of their temperature dependence ,",
    "was developed in ref.@xcite .    from a classical point of view",
    ", there are two extreme cases of single  particle motion , namely integrable and fully chaotic .",
    "the case of a mixed phase space ( e.g. , coexistence of regular and chaotic motion ) being the generic one . in all cases , in a fermi gas model the quantum thermodynamic fluctuations can be directly related to the fluctuations of the single  particle , discrete , energy levels .",
    "schematically , there are two distinct types of single  particle fluctuations .",
    "on the one hand there are the local fluctuations , i.e. those occurring on scales of the order of the single  particle mean level spacing @xmath0 .",
    "for the two extreme dynamics mentioned above , these fluctuations are known to be universal @xcite , namely poisson for integrable motion , random matrix in full chaos . the second type of fluctuations generically present in any single  particle spectrum are long range correlations , that occur on a scale @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the energy associated with the shortest classical periodic orbit of the mean field ( inverse time of flight across the system ) . in contrast to the local fluctuations , the long range modulations depend on the short  time specific properties of the dynamics and are therefore non  universal , either for integrable , mixed , or fully chaotic dynamics ( thought their importance varies in each case ) .    properties related to both types of single  particle fluctuations have been identified in the nuclear behavior . for example , shell effects in the nuclear masses are a clear manifestation of the long range correlations , whereas nearest ",
    "neighbor spacing statistics and the distribution of widths of neutron resonances illustrate universal local fluctuations .",
    "however , a global and comprehensive picture of the quantum fluctuations has not yet emerged .",
    "an important additional ingredient are certainly the variations in the nucleus of the nature of the dynamics as a function of the excitation energy . but even in the case of a scaling mean ",
    "field motion where the classical dynamics is energy independent ( like when putting a fermi gas inside a hard wall box or billiard ) the physical behavior of the gas can be quite complex and rich , and both types of fluctuations ( local and long range ) can in fact manifest in different quantities related to the system , or in the same quantity at different temperatures @xcite",
    ".    one might think that a fully chaotic single  particle dynamics implies universal quantum fluctuations of the thermodynamics of the gas , well described by some random matrix model ( wigner , two ",
    "body random , etc ) .",
    "this belief is not true in general .",
    "the reason is that the thermodynamic fluctuations are universal only when they are controlled by the local single  particle fluctuations . and",
    "this is not always the case .",
    "for example , it has been shown , in particular , that the statistical properties of the ground ",
    "state energy of a many  body system are controlled by the short periodic orbits ( at least in systems with a ground state well described by a mean  field approximation , like the atomic nucleus ) @xcite .",
    "the corresponding distribution is therefore non  universal . as a consequence",
    ", it makes no sense to model the ground ",
    "state fluctuations by some random matrix model , that possess no information on the specific mean  field short time properties of the dynamics .",
    "our purpose here is to illustrate the richness of the thermodynamic quantum fluctuations and to explicitly check some of the predictions by considering a particular example of a fermi gas with a fully chaotic classical dynamics .",
    "the system considered is a mathematical model .",
    "it is achieved by considering a spectrum of single  particle energy levels constructed from the imaginary part of the complex zeros of the riemann zeta function .",
    "the fermi gas is obtained by filling the single  particle energy levels with an average occupation number determined by the fermi ",
    "dirac distribution .",
    "this model of a chaotic gas was introduced in ref.@xcite , where general motivations as well as dynamical analogies were given . if this fermi  gas model is viewed as an element of the periodic table , following nuclear physics terminology we referred to it as the _ riemannium _ @xcite .",
    "aside its mathematical interest , physically the riemannium is an important model because it possesses all the typical dynamical properties and characteristics of a realistic chaotic gas , while it greatly facilitates the numerical and analytical computations ( e.g. , all the ingredients required in a semiclassical description of its thermodynamic properties are known ) .",
    "this is quite unusual in fully chaotic systems , and therefore offers a rather unique model to test general results and ideas .",
    "the basic quantities to be computed are the probability distributions , at a given temperature , of the quantum fluctuations of the grand potential and of the entropy of the gas .",
    "we consider a degenerate gas in the grand canonical ensemble ; other ensembles ( e.g. , canonical ) may be considered as well . in particular , it can be shown that to leading order in an expansion of large chemical potential , the fluctuations of the energy of the gas at a fixed number of particles coincide with those of the grand potential .",
    "our results therefore apply to the total energy . in a semiclassical approximation ,",
    "the fluctuations are described by the periodic orbits of the classical dynamics associated with the single  particle motion @xcite . in the riemannium ,",
    "the role of the periodic orbits is played by the prime numbers .",
    "the basic equations and the relevant energy scales of the riemannium are introduced in  [ sec : maineq ] . in  [ sec : omega ] we analyze the fluctuations of the grand potential .",
    "the corresponding distribution is non  universal at all temperatures ( including @xmath3 , the case considered in @xcite ) .",
    "the asymptotic moments of the distribution , obtained for a large chemical potential , are well reproduced by some convergent sums dominated by the smaller prime numbers ( i.e. , short periodic orbits ) .",
    "odd moments are non  zero , implying an asymmetric distribution at all temperatures .",
    "at a finite chemical potential , large prime numbers introduce corrections to the asymptotic moments .",
    "these corrections to the non  universal leading  order behavior are , in contrast , universal , and described by random matrix theory .",
    "the entropy fluctuations are studied in  [ sec : entropy ] .",
    "their character strongly depends on temperature . for a chaotic dynamics without time reversal symmetry , which corresponds to the riemannium",
    ", these fluctuations present several remarkable features , predicted in @xcite . for temperatures",
    "@xmath4 , the variance of the entropy fluctuations increases linearly . in a second regime ,",
    "when @xmath5 , the variance saturates to a constant value .",
    "this initial behavior of the variance ( i.e. linear growth followed by a saturation ) , and more generally of the probability distribution of the entropy fluctuations , was predicted to be universal , namely identical for any chaotic system without time reversal symmetry ( with a given single ",
    "particle mean level spacing at fermi energy ) .",
    "it is well described by the fluctuations obtained from a gue random matrix single  particle spectrum .",
    "the shape of the probability distribution strongly depends on temperature , and converges towards a gaussian as temperature increases .",
    "however , this universal behavior disappears for temperatures of the order @xmath2 or higher , where the statistical properties of the gas do not coincide any more with random matrix theory .",
    "the probability distribution of the fluctuations is now described by the short periodic orbits , which are system dependent . in this high temperature regime",
    "the typical size of the fluctuations shows an overall exponential decay .",
    "all these predictions are worked out explicitly for the riemannium and compared with numerical simulations .",
    "we have found very good agreement between theory and numerical experiments in all the regimes .",
    "although only two particular thermodynamic functions are discussed , they illustrate all the rich possibilities that may be encountered in other functions . similar methods apply to them .",

    ", the sum is made over the prime numbers @xmath23 .",
    "the comparison of this equation with the semiclassical gutzwiller trace formula for the spectral density of a dynamical system @xcite , @xmath24 ( the sum is over the classical periodic orbits ) , shows that each prime number may be interpreted as the label of an unstable primitive periodic orbit @xmath23 of a fully chaotic system without time reversal symmetry , of action @xmath25 , period @xmath26 , lyapounov stability @xmath27 , repetitions labeled by @xmath28 , and @xmath29 @xcite . because of this mapping , in the following we often refer to the prime numbers as periodic orbits .",
    "putting aside the issue of the very existence of a classical system whose quantum eigenvalues coincide with the imaginary part of the riemann zeros , it is the formal analogy with the semiclassical theory of dynamical systems that makes the riemann zeros in general , and the riemannium in particular , interesting on a physical basis as a model to test general theories of quantum chaotic systems .",

    "a similar decomposition for other thermodynamic functions is obtained by derivation .",

    "this is because at finite @xmath68 random matrix theory provides a wrong description of the short  time behavior of the form factor . for low values of @xmath69 the diagonal terms in eq.([ff ] ) should be used @xcite , @xmath70 this shows that the form factor is non  universal at short times , and that @xmath71 for @xmath72 .",

    "the size of the saturation plateau , predicted in the regime @xmath122 , was relatively small ( see the inset in fig.3 ) .",
    "this is due to the slow logarithmic asymptotic convergence properties of the riemannium ( in spite of the large chemical potential used in the numerical simulations , we are not very deep in the semiclassical limit .",
