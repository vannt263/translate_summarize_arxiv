    "large scale structures like galaxies and clusters of galaxies are believed to have formed by gravitational amplification of small perturbations . for an overview and original references , see , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "initial density perturbations were present at all scales that have been observed @xcite . understanding evolution of density perturbations for such initial conditions is essential for the study of formation of galaxies and large scale structures . the equations that describe the evolution of density perturbations in an expanding universe have been known for a long time and these are easy to solve when the amplitude of perturbations is small .",
    "these equations describe the evolution of density contrast defined as @xmath2 . here",
    "@xmath3 is the density at point @xmath4 and time @xmath5 , and @xmath6 is the average density in the universe at time @xmath5 .",
    "these are densities of non - relativistic matter , the component that clusters at all scales and is believed to drive the formation of large scale structures in the universe .",
    "once density contrast at relevant scales becomes large , i.e. , @xmath7 , the perturbation becomes non - linear and coupling with perturbations at other scales can not be ignored .",
    "the equation for evolution of density perturbations can not be solved for generic perturbations in this regime .",
    "n - body simulations are often used to study the evolution in this regime .",
    "alternative approaches can be used if one requires only a limited amount of information and in such a case either quasi - linear approximation schemes or scaling relations @xcite suffice .    in cosmological n - body simulations ,",
    "we simulate a representative region of the universe .",
    "this is a large but finite volume and periodic boundary conditions are often used .",
    "almost always , the simulation volume is taken to be a cube .",
    "effect of perturbations at scales smaller than the mass resolution of the simulation , and of perturbations at scales larger than the box is ignored .",
    "indeed , even perturbations at scales comparable to the box are under sampled .",
    "it has been shown that perturbations at small scales do not influence collapse of perturbations at much larger scales in a significant manner if we study the evolution of the correlation function or power spectrum at large scales due to gravitational clustering in an expanding universe .",
    "this is certainly true if the scales of interest are in the non - linear regime @xcite .",
    "therefore we may assume that ignoring perturbations at scales much smaller than the scales of interest does not affect results of n - body simulations .",
    "however , there may be other effects that are not completely understood at the quantitative level @xcite even though these have been seen only in somewhat artificial situations .",
    "perturbations at scales larger than the simulation volume can affect the results of n - body simulations .",
    "use of periodic boundary conditions implies that the average density in the simulation box is same as the average density in the universe , in other words we ignore perturbations at the scale of the simulation volume ( and at larger scales ) .",
    "therefore the size of the simulation volume should be chosen so that the amplitude of fluctuations at the box scale ( and at larger scales ) is ignorable .",
    "if the amplitude of perturbations at larger scales is not ignorable then clearly the simulation will not be a faithful representation of the model being studied .",
    "it is not obvious as to when fluctuations at larger scales can be considered ignorable , indeed the answer to this question depends on the physical quantity of interest , the model being studied and the specific length / mass scale of interest as well .    the effect of a finite box size has been studied using n - body simulations and the conclusions in this regard may be summarised as follows .    *",
    "if the amplitude of density perturbations around the box scale is small ( @xmath8 ) but not much smaller than unity , simulations underestimate the correlation function though the number density of small mass haloes does not change by much @xcite .",
    "in other words , the formation of small haloes is not disturbed but their distribution is affected by non - inclusion of long wave modes . * in the same situation , the number density of massive haloes drops significantly @xcite .",
    "* effects of a finite box size modify values of physical quantities like the correlation function even at scales much smaller than the simulation volume @xcite .",
    "* the void spectrum is also affected by finite size of the simulation volume if perturbations at large scales are not ignorable @xcite . *",
    "it has been shown that properties of a given halo can change significantly as the contribution of perturbations at large scales is removed to the initial conditions but the distribution of most internal properties remain unchanged @xcite .    in some cases ,",
    "one may be able to devise a method to `` correct '' for the effects of a finite box - size , but such methods can not be generalised to all statistical measures or physical quantities .",
    "the effects of perturbations at scales larger than the box size can be added using map ( mode adding procedure ) after a simulation has been run @xcite .",
    "this method makes use of the fact that if the box size is chosen to be large enough then the contribution of larger scales can be incorporated by adding displacements due to the larger scales independently of the evolution of the system in an n - body simulation .",
    "the motivation for development of such a tool is to enhance the range of scales over which results of an n - body simulation can be used by improving the description at scales comparable to the box size .",
    "such an approach ignores the coupling of large scale modes with small scale modes and this again brings up the issue of what is a large enough scale for a given model such that the effects of mode coupling can be ignored .",
    "large scales contribute to displacements and velocities , and variations in density due to these scales modify the rate of growth for small scales perturbations @xcite .",
    "effects of a finite box size modify values of physical quantities even at scales much smaller than the simulation volume @xcite ( br05 , hereafter ) . in br05 , we suggested use of the fraction of mass in collapsed haloes as an indicator of the effect of a finite box size .",
    "we found that if the simulation volume is not large enough , the fraction of mass in collapsed haloes is underestimated .",
    "as the collapsed fraction is less sensitive to box - size as compared to measures of clustering , several other statistical indicators of clustering to deviate significantly from expected values in such simulations .",
    "a workaround for this problem was suggested in the form of an ensemble of simulations to take the effect of convergence due to long wave modes into account @xcite , the effects of shear due to long wave modes are ignored here .",
    "it has also been shown that the distribution of most internal properties of haloes , e.g. , concentration , triaxiality and angular momentum do not change considerably with the box size even though properties of a given halo may change by a significant amount @xcite .",
    "there is a clear need to develop a formalism for estimating the effect of perturbations at large scales on a variety of physical quantities .",
    "without such a formalism , we can not decide in an objective manner whether a simulation box size is sufficiently large or not . in this paper",
    "we generalise the approach suggested in br05 and write down an explicit correction term for a number of statistical indicators of clustering .",
    "this approach allows us to study generic properties of the expected correction term in any given case , apart of course from allowing us to evaluate the magnitude of the correction as compared to the expected value of the given statistical indicator .",
    "we apply this technique to mass functions in this paper .",
    "initial conditions for n - body simulations are often taken to be a realisation of a gaussian random field with a given power spectrum , for details see , e.g. , .",
    "the power spectrum is sampled at discrete points in the @xmath9 space between the scales corresponding to the box size ( fundamental mode ) and the grid size ( nyquist frequency / mode ) . here",
    "@xmath9 is the wave vector .",
    "sampling of the power spectrum in initial conditions of n - body simulations is dense towards the nyquist mode , but is sparse for modes near the fundamental mode .",
    "power spectra for density , potential and the velocity field are related to each other in the linear regime .",
    "the power spectra can be used to compute the second moment ; either two point functions or _",
    "rms _ fluctuations . in view of the sampling of the power spectrum in initial conditions ,",
    "the second moment can be expressed as a sum over power spectrum at these points , weighted by an appropriate window function .    in the peak picture ,",
    "most quantities of interest can be related to the two point correlation function @xcite , therefore a method for estimating box - size correction to the second moment can be used as a base for computing correction for other physical quantities .",

    "number density of haloes in the simulation with @xmath83mpc is shown by the dashed line . as expected from the above discussion",
    ", the deviation from power law starts at smaller masses as the number density of very massive haloes is under - estimated as compared to the reference simulation . at smaller @xmath90 , we find about @xmath91 more haloes in this simulation as compared to the reference .",
    "it is noteworthy that the number density of low mass haloes remains above that in the reference simulation at all masses below the rapid drop around @xmath0  m@xmath1 .",
    "both the features follow the predictions in the preceeding discussion , indeed we have shown that these features are independent of the specific analytical form for the mass function . here",
    "we have also shown that the same behaviour is reproduced in n - body simulations .",
    "a more detailed comparison is beyond the scope of this paper and the results will be presented in a later publication .",
    "in the preceeding sections , we have described a method to estimate errors in the descriptors of clustering in the linear regime .",
    "we have also shown that the key results of the analytical study are borne out by n - body simulations .",
    "we have shown that the error is typically small if the scale of interest is sufficiently smaller than the box size .",
    "an implicit requirement is that the scale of non - linearity too should be much smaller than the box size ; if this restriction is overlooked then we not only ignore power in modes larger than the simulation box but also the significant effects of mode coupling from scales in the mildly non - linear regime .",

    "we propose using @xmath93 as an indicator of the significance of the finite box size , any descriptor of second moment can be used but @xmath94 has the virtue of being positive definite at all scales .",
    "our proposal is that @xmath95 , for the finite box - size corrections to be ignorable .",
    "all the @xmath94s are evolved linearly here .",
    "conversely , the ratio @xmath96 at the scale of interest is indicative of the magnitude of correction due to the finite box - size . for a given relative magnitude of the correction term ( @xmath96 )",
    ", @xmath59 is required to be larger for spectra with more large scale power .",
    "indeed , the required @xmath59 approaches infinity as the slope of the power spectrum approaches @xmath97 .    as a result of finite box - size corrections ,",
    "the amplitude of density perturbations is not a power law and the range of scales over which it can be approximated by one becomes smaller as we approach @xmath29 . in the linear regime ,",
    "the radial pair velocity is related directly with @xmath78 @xcite . as @xmath78 is not a pure power law in simulations due to box - size corrections",
    ", we expect that the pair velocities must also deviate from expected values .",
    "this , in turn leads to deviations from scale invariant growth of density perturbations .",
    "this explains the difficulty in getting scale invariant evolution for models like @xmath80 in n - body simulations @xcite .",
    "for realistic models like the @xmath47cdm , the correction term is significant only if the scales of interest are below a few kpc and becomes larger as we move to smaller scales ( see figure  2 ) .",
    "indeed , at these small scales we may require @xmath98 or even greater in order to manage @xmath99 .",
    "of course , a bigger simulation volume is required if we demand better accuracy . on the other hand , if we are interested in scales larger than @xmath0  kpc , present day simulations are sufficient for keeping @xmath100 .",
    "we have shown that at sufficiently small scales the correction due to a finite box size can be written as a series of progressively smaller terms . the first correction term ( @xmath27 )",
    "is shown to be positive definite .",
    "we have also shown that the first correction term is the same for two point correlation function and @xmath30 , indeed it is the same for all descriptors of the second moment for which the effective window function goes to unity at small @xmath16 .    as an application of our method",
    ", we discussed the correction to mass function and multiplicity function using the press - schechter as well as the sheth - tormen approach .",
    "we have given the explicit form of the correction term due to finite box size in each case .",
    "we have also given approximate expressions for the correction term and have shown that the approximation is very good in case of mass function .",
    "the mass function is always under estimated in simulations due to finite box - size corrections .",
    "multiplicity function , and hence also the number density of haloes of a given mass are underestimated at @xmath101 . at smaller mass scales , however , the multiplicity function is over estimated and we find more haloes in a simulation than expected in the model .",
    "the mass scale at which the cross over from under estimate to over estimate occurs is given by eqn.(10 ) for press - schechter and eqn.(14 ) for sheth - tormen mass function .",
    "the over estimate at small scales is related to the under estimate of mass in haloes at large scales .",
    "if the full power spectrum had been taken into account , the smaller haloes would have merged to form more massive haloes . in absence of large scale modes ,",
    "the formation of massive haloes is slowed down and a larger number of low mass haloes survive .",
    "a detailed analysis of the effect of finite box size correction on merger rates for haloes will be presented in a forthcoming paper .",
    "of significant interest is the impact on rates of major mergers @xcite as these have implications for observations .    we find that the over estimate in multiplicity function is large whenever the ratio @xmath102 is large . to illustrate this correlation , we have plotted the multiplicity function @xmath103 for the @xmath47cdm model in figure  6 .",
    "this has been plotted for redshift @xmath104 and @xmath105 and the mass range has been chosen such that very large box size is required to keep @xmath106 smaller than @xmath50 .",
    "we have also plotted @xmath107 here , with @xmath108h@xmath109kpc ( dotted curve ) , @xmath110h@xmath109kpc ( dot - dashed curve ) and @xmath111h@xmath109kpc ( dashed curve ) .",

    "the top row is for the press - schechter mass function and the lower row is for the sheth - tormen mass function .",
    "an identical @xmath114 range has been used to highlight the differences between the two models for mass function as well .",
    "it is noteworthy that the relative error is similar in both the cases even though the multiplicity function itself is different . at @xmath115 ,",
    "the multiplicity function is under estimated by a large amount for @xmath108h@xmath109kpc , even though @xmath116 and if we are interested in scales around @xmath82  pc then @xmath117 .",
    "the situation at small masses is better for the other two simulation volumes considered here .",
    "for @xmath118 , the scale of non - linearity is @xmath119h@xmath109kpc , very close to @xmath108h@xmath109kpc and hence we do not expect believable results for this box - size . indeed , the two panels on the right demonstrate the large errors and the absurdly incorrect shape of the multiplicity function .",
    "the difference in @xmath89 and @xmath103 at @xmath120 is about @xmath121 for @xmath122 , in this case @xmath123h@xmath109kpc and @xmath124 .",
    "the error in the multiplicity function is slightly larger than @xmath91 for @xmath125h@xmath109kpc even though @xmath126 and @xmath127 .",
    "the multiplicity function plotted here is the global function , and the conditional mass functions should be used in order to estimate errors in simulations where a high peak is studied at better resolution .",
    "similar results are obtained for other mass functions that have been suggested as a better fit to simulation data @xcite .",
    "the above discussion demonstrates the perils of using simulations where @xmath128 is close to unity .",
    "one may argue that models for mass function have not been tested in this regime where the local slope of the power spectrum is very close to @xmath97 , but the fact that error in amplitude of density perturbations itself is large should be reason enough to worry about reliability of results .",
    "further , the agreement in the magnitude of errors for the several approaches to mass functions also gives us some confidence in results .",
    "majority of simulations are not affected by such serious errors , as the slope of power spectrum approaches @xmath97 only at very small scales ( large wave numbers ) .",
    "however , high resolution simulations of earliest structure formation in the @xmath47cdm model need to have a very large dynamic range before the results can be believed within @xmath91 of the quoted value . indeed , our work may have some relevance to the ongoing discussion about the earth mass haloes @xcite .",

    "* we have presented a formalism that can be used to estimate the deviations of cosmological n - body simulations from the models being simulated due to the use of a finite box size .",

    "* we have studied errors in mass function in the press - schechter model , as well as other models . *",
    "the main error due to a finite box size is that the number of high mass haloes is under estimated . *",
    "the number of low mass haloes is over predicted in simulations if the box size effects are important .",
