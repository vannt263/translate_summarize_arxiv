    "evolution of atoms interacting with a coherent field is an interesting topic in quantum optics  @xcite .",
    "the jaynes- cummings model , jcm , is the simplest model describes the interaction of a single two -level atom with a single quantized electromagnetic field and can be realized experimentally @xcite . nowadays ,",
    "related studies are concerned with quantum information @xcite and computations @xcite . in this work ,",
    "we consider simple model of a two two - level atoms interacting with a single mode radiation field . due to the interaction ,",
    "the behavior of the two atoms swap from separable to entangled and vis versa . in our calculations , we consider only the entangled case of the two qubit state . on the other hand , since most of quantum information processing requires entangled state with high degree of purity and hence a degree of entanglement , we focus here on the effect of the structure of the initial atomic system on the degree of purity i.e , we answer the questions , what is the best choice of the initial atomic state to generate an entangled state with high purity ? and how the purities of the entangled qubit pairs and their individual subsystems evolves with time ? .",
    "since one can use these states as channels to code information , we investigate the robustness of theses channel in the presences of the individual attacks . finally , we use theses quantum channel to perform original coding protocol @xcite .",
    "also , the possibility of sending a secure information between two users is investigated , where we determine the secure interval of times , in which the users can communicate secure .",
    "the article is arranged as follows : in sec.@xmath0 , we describe the model and its time evolution .",
    "also we introduce the final state of the density operator in the computational basis .",
    "the behavior of the purity is the subject of subsection @xmath1 , where the calculations are performed only when the density operator behaves as an entangled state .",
    "sec.@xmath2 is devoted to investigate the robustness of the quantum channel is in the presences of eavesdropper , where we consider eve applies the individual attacks strategy . in sec .",
    "@xmath3 , we calculate the average amount of information gained from the coded information .",
    "also the possibility of sending a secure information is investigate in sec.@xmath4 .",
    "finally we discuss our result in sec.@xmath5 .",
    "the hamiltonian which describes a system of a two two -level atoms each consisting of states @xmath6 and @xmath7 coupled to a single mode radiation field in the rotating wave approximation is given by @xmath8\\ ] ] where @xmath9is the annihilation ( creation ) operator of the field mode , @xmath10 and @xmath11 the parameters @xmath12 are the atom - field coupling constant @xmath13 , is the atomic transitions and the field mode frequency .",
    "the first term in eq.@xmath14 represents the free - field and the non - interacting atoms , while the second term stands for the interaction hamiltonian , @xmath15 .",
    "this model has been solved analytically for some special cases and for a general case @xcite . in this work ,",
    "we introduce a direct solution for this model . for simplicity",
    ", we consider the case of identical atoms i.e.@xmath16 .",
    "assume that the cavity field is initially prepared in a coherent state @xmath17 , where @xmath18 .",
    "for the atomic system , we consider the first atom is in its excited state i.e. @xmath19 and the other atom is in a superposition state @xmath20 , where @xmath21 stands for the first atom , 2 for the second atom and @xmath22 .",
    "so , we can write the initial state of the two atoms as @xmath23 and consequently the initial state of the combined system is given by , @xmath24 at any time @xmath25 , the atom - field state is described by the state , @xmath26 since we are interested in the behavior of the purity and information contained in the entangled two atoms , we trace over the field state . after some straightforward calculations one can get the density operator of the two atoms explicitly in the computational basis as @xmath27 and @xmath28 : @xmath29 where , @xmath30 with @xmath31",
    "most of quantum information tasks require entangled pure state to be performed .",
    "this aim is a difficult to achieve in reality due to the dechorence . in this section ,",
    "we try to answer the following question .",
    "how close the generated entangled state of the two atoms to purity ? .",
    "on the other hand , since the interaction depends on the initial state of the two atoms , we study how the states of the atoms behave individually . in our study",
    ", we consider the impurity of the two atoms @xmath32 for the first atom and @xmath33 for the second atom .",
    "let us define the degree of impurity as @xmath34 where @xmath35 see for example @xcite .",

    "we consider that the initial state of the system is in a superposition state and the mean photon number @xmath48 . from this figure , it is clear that when the impurity of the first atom is maximum , the impurity of the second one has a minimum impurity .",
    "this phenomena is called impurity _",
    "swapping_. on other words , one can say that the purity of one qubit is increased at the expense of the other qubit .",

    "we obtain an entangled stated of purity , @xmath49 .",
    "this is an important result for quantum information and computation , where these applications need pure states with a high purity to be performed .",
