    "the trajectory of particle  1 is fairly stable .",
    "it comes closer to the origin when traveling between the arms ( @xmath138 ) and it passes through the spiral arms 4  times during 0.65  gyr .",
    "since dust particles are thought to be destroyed by supernova explosions , such a frequent encounter with the spiral arms implies that particle  1 may not live longer than 0.5  gyr ( although it depends on the covering factor of sufficiently strong shock waves , @xmath139  km  s@xmath14 , generated by supernova explosions ( sne ) and propagating perpendicular to the spiral arms ) .",

    "interestingly , particle  2 is caught between the spiral arms , periodically passing through the corotation circle from the inner part of the disk to the outer part and vice versa .",
    "since particle  2 never encounters the spiral arms during 2  gyr , it may live significantly longer than particle  1 .",
    "dust particles that are born at @xmath141 ( i.e. exactly between the spiral arms ) but are sufficiently away from the galactic center , move on much more compact orbits as shown by the dotted line in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] .    to summarize , we find that all particles born at @xmath142  kpc , i.e. @xmath143  kpc away from the position of corotation radius @xmath137  kpc , always stay inside corotation .",
    "this is irrespective of their azimuthal angles of birth .",

    "the fraction of surviving dust grains is determined by the probability for them to meet a sufficiently strong ( @xmath144 km s@xmath14 ) destroying shock wave inside the arm . on the other hand ,",
    "particles injected near corotation at @xmath145  kpc ( and sufficiently away from spiral arms ) spend most of their lifetime in the interarm region . therefore , most of these dust particles can survive over the entire migration period in the outer galactic regions .        in the absence of spiral arms , dust particles move on circular orbits determined by the axisymmetric global gravitational potential of a galaxy and the drag force from the gas disk .",
    "when the non - axisymmetric spiral gravitational potential is introduced , dust particles move on various non - circular orbits as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] . in order to understand the origin of such non - circular orbits , we consider the influence of a non - axisymmetric spiral gravity force on the motion of dust particles .",
    "the gravity force of spiral arms acting on moving particles is schematically plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] by the dashed arrows .",
    "six particles are presented ; two particles inside the corotation circle and four particles outside the corotation circle .",
    "the direction of motion of dust particles _ in the frame of reference of the spiral pattern _ is shown by the solid arrows .",
    "two spiral arms are schematically shown by the solid and dashed lines .",
    "a moving dust particle may see the nearest spiral arm as either convex or concave .",
    "if the dust particle is closer to the concave spiral , the latter acts to increase ( on average ) the radial distance of the particle due to its gravitational drag . on the contrary , if the dust particle is closer to the convex spiral , the latter tends to decrease the radial distance of the particle .",
    "if we now recall that the trailing spiral arms in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] are located along the azimuthal angles 0 and @xmath134 and rotate counterclockwise , then the effect of gravitational drag from the spiral arms becomes clearly evident in the trajectories of dust particles .",
    "for instance , when dust particles are in the first quadrant , they are attracted by the convex spiral located at @xmath133 . as a consequence ,",
    "the radial position of these particles decreases .",
    "when dust particles enter the second quadrant , their motion is controlled by the concave spiral located at @xmath146 and their radial position increases .",
    "therefore , the trajectories of dust grains may be sensitive to the pitch angle of stellar spiral arms .",
    "the maximum radial migrations of dust grains are expected for a pitch angle of @xmath147 .",
    "the action of the friction force is more difficult to assess .",
    "the friction between dust and gas may help reverse the direction of motion of a dust particle ( with respect to the spiral arms ) when it passes through corotation .",
    "indeed , when the dust particle is inside the corotation circle , its velocity is larger than that of spiral arms ( the same is true for the gas in general ) . after passing through corotation ,",
    "the dust particle enters the region which is characterized by a smaller velocity than that of spiral arms .",
    "therefore , we may expect that the friction between gas and dust would act to equalize the velocities of dust and gas , and thus decelerate the dust particles .",
    "this would eventually reverse their direction of motion with respect to the spiral arms as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] for particle  2 .",
    "in this section we study how dust responds to the imposed spiral disturbance .",
    "the dominant sources of dust formation in disk galaxies are stellar winds from late - type giant and supergiant stars , supernova explosions , and growth of pre - existing grains in dense @xmath148  @xmath55 molecular clouds @xcite .",
    "all of these sources are mainly located inside the corotation circle . indeed , the strongest gas response to the stellar spiral density wave in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] is obviously seen inside corotation .",
    "we compute the critical density for star formation as defined by the toomre criterion @xcite @xmath149 where @xmath150 is the epicyclic frequency , and the shear criterion @xcite @xmath151 where @xmath152 is the local shear rate ( the oort constant ) . the contour line in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] traces the region of supercritical density with @xmath153 which is evidently localized inside corotation .",
    "although the gas density outside corotation may occasionally become supercritical ( not shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ) especially along the outer diffuse gas spirals , a lower gas density and higher temperature as compared to the inner region can work against star formation in that region .",
    "we thus conclude that most of star formation in our model galaxy is localized within the corotation circle .",
    "the radial scale length of our old stellar disk is @xmath63  kpc which also implies that most of low to intermediate mass stars that are capable of producing dust are confined within the corotation circle .",
    "we instantaneously inject @xmath154 of dust mass inside the corotation circle ( @xmath155  kpc ) and then determine the fraction of dust that can move outside corotation . in the present simulations ,",
    "the dust particles are injected at @xmath156  myr when a spiral structure in the gas disk has not yet developed .",
    "we also tried to introduce dust at t=800  myr ( when the gas spirals are fully developed ) and confirmed that the time of dust injection has little influence on dust dynamics .",
    "the spatial distribution of injected dust is such that the dust - to - gas ratio @xmath157 inside corotation , and @xmath158 outside corotation .",
    "the velocity of injected dust is equal to that of the gas .",
    "a conservative estimate of dust - to - gas mass ratio in the solar neighborhood gives an average value of @xmath159 ranging from @xmath160 up to @xmath161 in h@xmath162 regions @xcite .",

    "the dust density closely follows that of gas in the inner regions of our model galaxy .",
    "small radial and azimuthal variations of the dust - to - gas ratio around the initial value 0.01 are indicative of a dominant role of frictional force in the dynamics of dust in the inner 5  kpc .",
    "this is in agreement with the results of sect .",
    "[ test ] where we have found that dust particles born in the inner @xmath163  kpc move on fairly stable elliptical orbits around the galactic center . at larger radii @xmath164  kpc , however , significant variations of @xmath165 become evident",

    "these variations are mainly due to dust particles born inside the corotation circle in the interarm region , where they are trapped into periodic orbits as shown by solid and dotted lines in fig.[fig5 ] .",
    "we conclude that only a ( small ) fraction of dust particles ( approximately 10% by mass ) injected instantaneously inside the corotation circle can move to the outer regions , while the rest is confined in the inner galaxy . as a consequence , the radial transport of an instantaneously injected portion of dust terminates after @xmath170  gyr .",

    "[ fig7 ] , it would appear that the dust does not follow exactly the gas motion in the region near corotation .",
    "the reason is that the dust particles have natural resonant frequencies near corotation ( remember that corotation determines the position of resonance in gas / dust orbits ) .",
    "if the gravitational field generated by spiral structure perturbs a dust particle s orbit at or near its resonant frequency , then the responce of the orbit will be large , even when the perturbing field is weak and/or the frictional coupling is strong . to investigate this effect ,",
    "we re - define the local dynamical time as @xmath186 and plot the corresponding quantity @xmath179 in fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] by the dashed line .",
    "it is now evident that the frictional coupling between dust and gas is much weaker near corotation .",

    "as is pointed out in sect .",
    "[ basic ] , the total stellar+gas surface density @xmath187 ( instead of simply gas surface density , @xmath188 ) should appear in the definition of the gas vertical scale height @xmath189 which may considerably increase the value of @xmath29 . the uncertainity in the value of @xmath190",

    "( [ height ] ) may have on the radial transport of dust particles , we notice that in the region of interest near corotation the ratio of stellar - to - gas surface densities is usually in the @xmath191 range .",
    "therefore we performed a test run in which @xmath29 was defined by eq .",
    "( [ thick ] ) , but was later multiplied by a factor of 10 . the efficiency of outward radial transport of dust increased by less than @xmath84 . in another test , @xmath29 is decreased by a factor of 10 , and the efficiency of outward radial transport of dust is dropped by approximately @xmath84 .",
    "we conclude that an order of magnitude variation in @xmath29 has a minor effect on the efficiency of radial transport of dust .",
    "this reinforces a previous conclusion : the resonant region near corotation , where @xmath192 , and the collisional drag force is dynamically less important than the spiral gravitational field , determines the radial migration of dust .",
    "in this section we study the effect of dust destruction by sne on the efficiency of radial transport of dust in spiral galaxies .",
    "the dust grain destruction by sne is the most important mechanism for cycling the dust back to the gas phase .",
    "the dust destruction rate can be determined as @xcite @xmath193 here , @xmath194 is the supernova rate per unit area and @xmath195 is the mass of dust that is destroyed by a single sn expanding at location @xmath196 and time @xmath197 . only sn",
    "remnants with velocities exceeding 100  km  s@xmath14 can efficiently destroy dust grains .",

    "this relation simply states that the fraction of destroyed dust ( by mass ) within a computational cell is directly proportional to the fraction of accelerated remnant mass .",

    "we study the effect of dust destruction on the radial transport of dust using a prototype model in which the spiral density wave has a pitch angle @xmath101 and angular velocity @xmath228  km  s@xmath14  kpc@xmath14 .",
    "this model was studied in detail in sect .",
    "[ dust ] where we neglected the effect of dust destruction .",
    "it was shown there that about @xmath1 of dust by mass injected instantaneously inside the corotation circle can be transported outside this region by the gravitational drag associated with spiral density waves .",

    "[ fig10]a by the dashed line , and the solid line gives the dust mass outside corotation as a percentage of the initial total dust mass when dust destruction is taken into account .",
    "as is seen , supernova explosions have a minor effect on the radial transport of dust , decreasing the relative amount of dust outside corotation by only @xmath174 when compared to the model without dust destruction .",
    "it is worth noting that inside corotation the destruction of dust by supernova explosions is efficient .",
    "indeed , the dashed - dotted and dotted lines in fig .",
    "[ fig10]b show the dust mass inside corotation as a percentage of the initial total dust mass when dust destruction is taken and not taken into account , respectively .",
    "approximately @xmath229 of the instantaneously injected dust mass is left inside corotation after 2  gyr .",
    "given that another @xmath1 has been transported outside corotation , sne have destroyed about @xmath230 of the injected dust mass during 2  gyr . in sect .",
    "[ dust ] we argued that the ultimate fate of dust grains would depend on their place of birth .",
    "the simulations discussed in this section reinforce our earlier conclusion . in our model dust grains",
    "are formed inside the corotation circle at @xmath231  kpc .",
    "the dust grains that are born in the inner 6.0  kpc circle ( by implication they constitute the majority of the total dust mass ) move on elliptic orbits periodically crossing the spiral arms and will be inevitably destroyed by supernova explosions after several revolution periods .",
    "however , the dust grains that are born in the @xmath232  kpc annulus and sufficiently away from spiral arms ( by implication they constitute the minority of the total dust mass ) manage to survive the destructive effect of supernova explosions during many revolution periods of our model galaxy .",
    "these dust grains may move on orbits similar to those shown in fig .",

    "we conclude that a ( small ) portion of dust grains may survive the destructive effect of sne during many ( @xmath233 ) revolution periods of a spiral galaxy .",
    "in this paper we study the outward radial transport of interstellar dust grains which is connected with the perturbation of circular motions caused by spiral stellar density waves in disk galaxies .",
    "we consider a model spiral galaxy in which star formation ( and , by implication , dust formation ) is localized within the corotation circle .",
    "we find that the combined action of the gravity force of spiral stellar density waves and the drag force between the gas and dust components imparts to dust particles a radial velocity component , and thus can evacuate dust outward .",
    "we conclude that :    \\1 .",
    "dust grains that are formed inside corotation can be transported to a distance that exceeds the corotation radius by roughly @xmath0 .",
    "in particular , if corotation is located at @xmath234  kpc , dust grains formed inside the @xmath164  kpc annulus can travel to distances as large as 10  kpc in roughly 1.0  gyr .",
    "this is approximately an order of magnitude faster that can be provided by the interstellar turbulence .",
    "a fraction of dust grains can be trapped into the interarm region , and thus can escape a hostile environment from supernova explosions acting mostly in the spiral arms .",
    "these grains form diffuse spiral arms which extend 4 - 5  kpc from the sites of active star formation .",
    "dust particles that cross the spiral arms during their drift outward can survive if they do not meet strong shocks from sne while passing through the arm .",
    "\\3 . in the model that considers instantaneous dust injection , about @xmath1 of dust by mass",
    "is evacuated outside the corotation circle in roughly 1.0  gyr .",
    "one can assume that continuous injection will result in the same percentage of evacuated dust .",
    "the efficiency of outward radial dust transport is weakly sensitive to the rotation speed of stellar spirals , but it may be considerably reduced for very tightly wound spirals with a pitch angle @xmath175 .",
    "dust destruction by supernova explosions has only a minor effect on the efficiency of outward radial transport of dust by spiral density waves , which decreases the relative amount of transported dust mass by @xmath235 .",
    "a ( small ) portion of dust grains may survive the destructive effect of sne during many ( @xmath233 ) revolution periods of a spiral galaxy .",
    "our modeling shows that the dust - to - gas ratio in the region near corotation ( @xmath236  kpc ) can vary substantially over the scales comparable to the thickness of spiral arms , @xmath237 kpc .",
    "possible observations of such variations would be suggestive of the proposed mechanism of radial dust transport .",
    "in our model we neglected the fact that charged dust grains are strongly coupled to the magnetic field ",
    "the gyration frequency for a typical grain with radius @xmath238 m and grain charge @xmath239 is of @xmath240 hz .",
    "we expect that in more realistic models , where the magnetic field is permanently regenerated by a turbulent dynamo , dust particles will be involved in both the turbulent diffusive motions and regular flow , and the overall picture will remain qualitatively similar to that described above .",
    "we leave this issue for further study .",
    "we should mention that the interaction of gas and solid particles through the drag force and the associated radial flow of solid particles have been already extensively studied in the context of migration of planetisimals in protoplanetary disks .",
    "for example , weidenschilling ( @xcite ) has noticed that in protoplanetary disks the planetesimals should migrate in the direction of increasing pressure ( i.e. inward , for an axisymmetric disk with a declining radial density profile ) .",
    "this is due to the fact that the gas in protoplanetary disks generally orbits the central protostar at the sub - keplerian velocity due to a substantial contribution of pressure gradients in the gas rotation curve .",
    "the cold planetesimals ( which by implication have no pressure ) are then forced to flow inward if the frictional orbital coupling between the gas and planetesimals is not too strong .",
    "this mechanism however may not work on galactic scales because the contribution of the pressure gradients to the gas rotation velocity may be negligible ( see sect .",
    "[ equilib ] ) .",
    "in fact , the pressure gradients may even assist the gravity in some disk galaxies with a ring - like radial distribution of gas .",
    "another interesting aspect of gas - planetesimal interaction in self - gravitating , protoplanetary disks was investigated by rice et al .",
    "( @xcite ) .",
    "they considered disks with a flocculent spiral structure and demonstrated that the drag force rather than gravitational field of spiral arms plays a dominant role in the dynamics of planetesimals of intermediate size , forcing them to concentrate in the gas spiral arms .",
    "the non - axisymmetric gravitational field of grand - design spirals ( considered in the present paper ) is by implication much stronger than that of flocculent spirals . as a consequence ,",
    "the trajectories of dust particles can be considerably influenced by the spiral gravitatioanl field ( fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] ) .",
    "we believe that the resonant action of spiral gravitational field on dust particles ( rather than the drag force between the gas and dust ) is the main driving force for the radial outward transport of dust in grand - design spiral galaxies .",
    "this conjecture is justified by the fact that the radial flow of dust takes place near the corotation resonance where a weaker frictional coupling between the dust and gas occurs ( see fig .  [ fig9 ] ) .",
