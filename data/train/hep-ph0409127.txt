    "the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) makes a firm prediction for the mass of the lightest higgs boson .",
    "supersymmetry ( susy ) relates the quartic coupling of the higgs boson to the standard model ( sm ) gauge couplings , resulting in a tree - level prediction for the higgs mass : @xmath2 gev .",
    "the current higgs mass bound from lep ii ( @xmath3 @xcite ) can be accommodated , but only if the parameters are somewhat fine - tuned  proponents of the mssm would have been more comfortable had the higgs boson been discovered closer to the tree - level prediction .",
    "( see @xcite for a discussion of fine - tuning in the mssm . )",
    "the alternative to fine - tuning is new physics at the tev scale that contributes to the higgs mass . for recent attempts , see @xcite .",
    "there are two hints as to the nature of this new tev scale physics .",
    "the first is the striking unification of the gauge couplings in the mssm @xcite .",
    "we will demand that any modifications to the higgs sector maintain unification .",
    "second , the theory be should as natural as possible ; some mechanisms raise the higgs boson mass only by introducing a substantial fine - tuning . as we will discuss in section 2.1 , these two criteria lead us to study particular gauge extensions of the mssm . in these extensions the higgs mass is increased through non - decoupling @xmath0-terms @xcite . to have a significant effect , the new gauge group under which the higgs is charged must have a large coupling .",
    "unfortunately , the simplest gauge extensions of the mssm spoil gauge coupling unification . in these cases",
    ", the only recourse is to include additional particles whose sole purpose to restore unification , `` unifons . '' in this paper , using the success of the mssm as a guide , we will describe two models without these designer particles . in these models ,",
    "gauge coupling unification constrains the size of the non - decoupling @xmath0-terms , limiting the potential increase in the higgs mass .",
    "this is easy to see : in our approach , we mix the electroweak @xmath4 with additional gauge groups .",
    "this increases the @xmath4 gauge couplings , which are related to the higgs quartic coupling by supersymmetry .",
    "unification relates these new electroweak gauge groups to a new colored gauge group , which is in danger of becoming strongly coupled .",
    "this puts an upper bound on the size of the @xmath4 coupling , and therefore on the @xmath0-term contribution to the higgs mass .    in sec .",
    "2 we present two gauge extensions of the mssm that naturally maintain unification , and can contribute to the higgs mass without invoking fine tuning .",
    "the first model adds an extra copy of a gut gauge group , which is coupled to the standard model gauge content by bi - fundamentals .",
    "we call this approach `` product unification .",
    "'' the second model is one of accelerated unification @xcite , where the additional gauge content is a copy of the standard model gauge group . in this case unification",
    "is maintained , but occurs at a much lower scale .",
    "notably , this model requires the presence of a second pair of higgs doublets at low energy , which might seem an _ ad hoc _ addition to the model , resurrecting the `` unifon '' specter . on the contrary",
    ", we will argue in sec .",
    "[ sec : gut scale ] that their existence can be related to the observed stability of the proton via a missing - partner mechanism @xcite .",
    "the organization of the rest of the paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "3 we discuss in detail non - decoupling @xmath0-terms , focusing on the specific potential that arises in both of the models described above . in sec .",
    "4 we apply these results to the product unification model and discuss implications for the higgs mass .",
    "we find that in this case the non - decoupling @xmath0-terms can contribute roughly 10 @xmath5 to the higgs mass . in sec .",
    "5 we turn to the minimal accelerated unification model , and conclude that @xmath0-terms can easily raise the higgs mass by @xmath6 @xmath5 .",
    "we discuss precision unification in both cases .",
    "finally we conclude and present an outlook for these two models .",
    "in sec . [ sec : higgs mass ] , we will begin by outlining various modifications to the mssm that can raise the higgs mass . of these",
    ", we will argue that only two  the nmssm @xcite and non - decoupling @xmath0-terms  can accommodate unification without fine tuning .",
    "we will focus on the second of these , and give in sec .",
    "[ sec : unification ] a more detailed description of the restrictions that unification places on this approach .",
    "there are two distinct possibilities : the unification scale may be preserved by the new gauge structure , or it may be lowered . in sec .",
    "[ sec : models ] we briefly describe the two simplest implementations of these alternatives .",
    "the first involves adding an extra unified gauge group , while the second requires the addition of a copy of the standard model gauge content .",
    "we will now discuss various ways of raising the higgs mass in supersymmetric models , and conclude that gauge extensions and the nmssm are the two most attractive alternatives .      the simplest way to increase the higgs mass requires no new physics ; it simply uses the susy breaking effects associated with the top squark @xcite . in general , a yukawa interaction between the higgs and some other particle will contribute both to the ( mass)@xmath7 of the higgs boson and to its quartic coupling , as @xmath8 here @xmath9 is the number of colors , @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the boson and fermion masses , and we have included the susy violating @xmath12-term @xmath13 at loop level , these effects give a logarithmically divergent contribution to the higgs boson ( mass)@xmath7 , but only a finite contribution to the higgs quartic coupling .",
    "the result is fine - tuning , making this mechanism rather unattractive .",
    "for example , every 10 gev increase in the higgs mass above 115 gev requires a doubling of the top squark mass .",
    "we could use the @xmath12-term to improve this situation , but such contributions are typically small .",
    "the @xmath12-term contribution is maximized at @xmath14 , a parameter choice that has been dubbed `` maximal mixing . ''",
    "susy breaking scenarios often have much smaller @xmath12-terms , reducing potential contributions to the higgs mass , gaugino mediation to @xmath15 , and gauge mediation to @xmath16 .",
    "dilaton mediation gives the largest value , @xmath17 @xcite . ] .",
    "for example , as @xmath18 decreases from @xmath19 to @xmath20 the contribution to @xmath21 decreases by a factor of 3 . moreover , radiative corrections from @xmath12-terms increase fine tuning in the mssm .",
    "we therefore conclude that @xmath12-terms are not useful for raising the higgs mass .",
    "it is possible to add yukawa interactions to new particles , but precision electroweak constraints make this unlikely .",
    "chiral multiplets that get their masses from electroweak symmetry breaking are very strongly constrained .",
    "vector - like matter makes the already modest susy - breaking logarithm in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : ft ] ) even smaller , so is not a useful alternative .      a more attractive way of raising the higgs mass is to add new fields that directly couple to @xmath23 or @xmath24 in the superpotential . at the renormalizable level",
    "the only possibilities are a gauge singlet , @xmath25 , and an su(2 ) triplet , @xmath26 .",
    "the possible superpotential terms are @xmath27 where we have included three different triplets @xmath28 with hypercharges @xmath29 , @xmath30 .",
    "these interactions contribute to the quartic coupling of the higgs bosons at the tree - level , so can raise the higgs mass without fine - tuning @xcite .",
    "however , the triplets will disturb gauge coupling unification unless additional matter is added to fill out an su(5 ) multiplet .",
    "the smallest such multiplets are the * 24 * of su(5 ) for @xmath31 , and the * 15+*@xmath32 for @xmath33 . absent an obvious rationale for adding the remainder of the gut multiplets , we find this possibility somewhat distasteful . moreover , the addition of so much matter raises the prospect of a landau pole .",
    "finally , if the triplets acquire a small vacuum expectation value ( vev ) , they can have dangerous contributions to the @xmath26 parameter . on the other hand",
    ", the presence of a singlet @xmath25 will not affect the unification of couplings at the one - loop level , making it a more promising candidate .",
    "this coupling has a positive beta function and will lead to a landau pole at large coupling .",
    "this constrains the size of the @xmath34 coupling at the weak scale , thus limiting its contribution to the higgs mass @xcite .",
    "finally , one can introduce new gauge groups .",
    "the associated @xmath0-terms will then contribute to the higgs quartic coupling .",
    "in the susy limit , these new contributions exactly decouple when the gauge groups break down to the mssm .",
    "on the other hand , if the scale of susy breaking is close to the scale of the breaking of the gauge groups , there are non - decoupling @xmath0-terms which can raise the higgs mass  essentially , when integrated out these terms introduce hard susy breaking into the mssm @xcite .",
    "these contributions to the quartic coupling ( and hence the physical higgs boson mass ) arise at tree level , while contributions to the ( mass)@xmath7 occur only at loop level .",
    "this allows an increase in the higgs boson mass without significant fine - tuning .",
    "however , this new non - supersymmetric quartic coupling generates a quadratic divergence in the higgs mass , which is cut off at the mass of the new vector bosons . to prevent fine tuning",
    ", we therefore require that this contribution not be too large , since @xmath35 this constrains the breaking scale to be in the 3  10 tev range .",
    "the lower limit is set by precision electroweak considerations .",
    "we have seen that non - decoupling @xmath0-terms have the potential to raise the higgs mass without fine - tuning , but we must still require that the new fields do not upset unification . we will now proceed to outline the two different ways that extended gauge sectors can accomplish this , and present two minimal implementations of this mechanism .      at one loop , gauge coupling unification can be tested by examining the following relation between the inverse gauge couplings and the one loop beta functions for the gauge groups : @xmath36 where @xmath37 are the one loop beta function coefficients . using the experimentally measured values of the gauge couplings at the weak scale @xcite , @xmath38 the left hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eqn : testfn ] ) is @xmath39 to the gut normalized @xmath40 . ] . in the mssm",
    ", we have @xmath41 , so @xmath42 .",
    "this agreement summarizes the success of gauge coupling unification in the mssm at one - loop",
    ".    we must now ask what mechanisms allow us to raise the higgs mass without changing @xmath43 .",
    "one possibility is to add extra matter only in complete gut multiplets",
    ". then all the @xmath37 are all shifted by a fixed amount  in this case the unification scale is unchanged , but the value of the gauge couplings at unification may be altered .",
    "the nmssm is a trivial implementation of this strategy ( all @xmath44 are unchanged ) , and , as described above , is effective in raising the higgs mass .",
    "if we wish to consider gauge extensions to the mssm , we must add a complete unified gauge group to the model .",
    "a model of this form , which we refer to as product unification , will be described in the next subsection , and in greater detail in sec .",
    "[ sec : product ] .",
    "the other natural possibility that keeps @xmath45 unchanged is to add matter in such a way that the @xmath46 is changed , but a proportional change is made in @xmath47 .",
    "in this case unification still occurs , but at a lower scale .",
    "a specific implementation of this idea is accelerated unification @xcite , where the unification scale is brought down to the intermediate scale .",
    "the extra gauge content is simply another copy of @xmath48 . a model of this form",
    "will be described below , and in more detail in sec .",
    "[ sec : at ] .",
    "we will present two minimal models that contain non - decoupling @xmath0-terms and preserve unification .",
    "product unification adds a full gut gauge group ; accelerated unification adds a second copy of the mssm gauge group .    both of these are closely related to deconstructed dimensions @xcite . the first model , product unification , is equivalent to having an extra dimensional gut with @xmath48 gauged on the boundary .",
    "the second model is equivalent to a bulk @xmath48 gauge theory with power - law `` unification '' at a low scale . in order to have non - decoupling @xmath0-terms",
    "the effective radius must be 1  10 tev , meaning that the bulk of the running occurs above the naive five dimensional cut - off . in both examples",
    "we will consider the minimally deconstructed theories , which we now describe .      in this approach , the high energy gauge group is @xmath49 , augmented by a grand unified gauge group , @xmath50 . near the tev scale ,",
    "the product @xmath51 is broken down to the standard model gauge group , @xmath52 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : diagonalp ] ) . the matter and higgs",
    "fields of the standard model are charged under @xmath53 .",
    "after the breaking , they inherit the usual standard model quantum numbers .",
    "the breaking to the mssm occurs when link fields , @xmath54 and @xmath55 , acquire a vev .",
    "these fields transform as bi - fundamentals of the global symmetry associated with the gut gauge group .",
    "the structure of this model is similar to that of minimal deconstructed gaugino mediation @xcite ; however , we will remain agnostic about the exact mechanism of supersymmetry breaking , unless we take the gauginos masses to be unnaturally heavy @xcite . ] .",
    "while any gut representation for the link fields will leave unification undisturbed , here we take the fields to transform under a trinified @xcite representation ( see fig .  [ fig : pmodel ] ) .",
    "the reasons are two  fold .",
    "first , this representation is the smallest possible . in trinification",
    ", the @xmath54 fields fall into representations of @xmath56 that only contribute @xmath57 to each beta function . in @xmath58 and @xmath59",
    "unification , the link fields add 5 and 10 to @xmath60 , respectively .",
    "thus trinification contributes the least possible amount to the gauge coupling beta functions , which helps keep the theory perturbative .",
    "second , this model is closely related to the minimal accelerated unification model , which we now discuss .      in accelerated unification models @xcite , the standard model gauge group , @xmath61 , is the remnant of an enlarged group , @xmath62 , that breaks to the diagonal subgroup at the tev scale .",
    "the presence of extra matter changes the gauge coupling beta functions , causing the theories to unify at a much lower scale ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : diagonala ] ) .    the gauge and matter content of the @xmath63 trinified model",
    "is summarized in fig .",
    "[ fig : model ] .",
    "there are two copies of the low energy gauge group , which we denote @xmath64_{a , b}$ ] .",
    "the matter and higgs bosons of the mssm , as well as a new pair of higgs bosons , are charged under @xmath64_{a}$ ] .",
    "again , a vector - like pair of link fields , @xmath54 and @xmath55 , is responsible for breaking the gauge groups down to the diagonal subgroup .",
    "these fields should form complete gut multiplets , so as to not contribute to the relative running of the gauge couplings .",
    "a similar situation occurs in theories of gauge mediated supersymmetry breaking , where additional complete multiplets are used so as not to spoil unification .",
    "because these fields make up full gut multiplets , rather than the minimum necessary for the breaking of the gauge symmetry , some components of the @xmath54 fields can become pseudo - goldstone bosons ( pgbs ) .",
    "these particles can have important phenomenological consequences , which we will address in sec .",
    "while accelerated unification can accommodate any gut representation for the link fields , trinification is particularly elegant . @xmath58 and @xmath59 models contain gauge boson mediated dimension - six proton decay operators , now dangerous due to the lower gut scale , which are difficult to remove in 4-@xmath0 gut models .",
    "moreover , the dynamics of the breaking @xmath65 is simplifier in trinified models , since it is possible to stabilize the potential for @xmath54 in the @xmath0-flat directions by adding renormalizable terms to the superpotential .",
    "this is in contrast with the @xmath58 case , where there is only a @xmath0-term potential ; no stabilizing superpotential can be added without additional matter @xcite .",
    "directions that are not @xmath0-flat would lead to fine - tuning .",
    "in addition , as already described above , trinification has the smallest representation for the @xmath54 fields , ameliorating landau pole issues .",
    "we must also choose @xmath66 , the number of copies of the mssm gauge group . in principle we may add as many copies as desired , as long as @xmath67 higgs doublets are added at the same time .",
    "but the expected threshold corrections to unification grow with @xmath66 , so at large @xmath66 unification appears accidental .",
    "moreover , the gauge couplings scale as @xmath68 , so strong coupling problems can arise at large @xmath66 . for these reasons",
    "we focus on @xmath63 , where we expect to have the best control over unification , there is the interesting possibility that the three pairs of higgs doublets are related to the three families ( i.e. higgs - matter unification ) , but we will not explore this model here . ] .",
    "finally , the @xmath63 trinified model presented here has an elegant mechanism to prevent proton decay .",
    "as noted above , this model includes an extra pair of higgs doublets in addition to the usual pair present in supersymmetric models .",
    "we may then couple one pair of higgs doublets to the leptons and the other to the quarks , which suppresses baryon number violating interactions .",
    "we will discuss this mechanism in more detail in sec .",
    "[ sec : p decay ] .",
    "[ sec : p tev scale breaking ] in this section we discuss the breaking of the extended gauge sector down to the sm gauge group .",
    "the breaking is essentially identical for the product and accelerated unification models , and will ultimately be the source of the non - decoupling @xmath0-terms that raise the higgs mass .    breaking occurs when the link fields @xmath69 get a vev . in both of the models described above",
    ", the link fields can be organized into global @xmath70_{a , b}$ ] multiplets as @xmath71 the hypercharge generator is given by @xmath72 with @xmath73 and @xmath74 .",
    "these fields come in a complete gut multiplet and do not disturb unification .      to give the @xmath54 fields a vev",
    ", we must include a potential @xmath75 .",
    "the most general @xmath56 symmetric superpotential is @xmath76 there is one such potential for each of @xmath77 .",
    "the kahler term is @xmath78 this potential has two @xmath0-flat minima at : @xmath79 we focus on the second solution , which breaks @xmath80 .",
    "the small fluctuations around the vev can be grouped into four complex fields @xmath81 , @xmath82 , @xmath83 and @xmath84 : @xmath85 where @xmath86 are normalization constants .",
    "@xmath81 is the fluctuation of the vev , while @xmath82 and @xmath83 are the goldstone boson superfields for the broken global @xmath87 symmetries . only a subgroup of this @xmath87 is gauged .",
    "the determinant superpotential breaks the @xmath88 of this @xmath87 explicitly , giving @xmath82 a mass .",
    "the fields transform under the unbroken @xmath56 as @xmath89 expanding the superpotential around the vev , we find : @xmath90 this yields masses @xmath91 the @xmath0-terms decouple in the supersymmetric limit .",
    "to see this , define the vector superfields @xmath92 and @xmath93 by @xmath94 with @xmath95 .",
    "it follows that @xmath93 acquires a mass while @xmath92 remains massless . ignoring @xmath92 ,",
    "the kahler term may be expanded to leading order as @xmath96 where @xmath97 . using the gauge transformation @xmath98 we can go to unitary gauge , with @xmath99 .",
    "now consider a field , @xmath100 , charged under @xmath101 .",
    "the kahler term contains the coupling to @xmath93 ( for the moment we suppress the @xmath102 ) @xmath103 the superfield propagator at zero momentum in unitary gauge is given simply by @xmath104 .",

    "the precise mass of this particle depends on the breaking of the gut symmetry .",
    "we now discuss precision electroweak constraints , which set the mass of the new vector bosons .",
    "precision electroweak constraints on these models arise from interactions between the heavy vector bosons and the standard model fermions and higgs .",
    "one might worry that these considerations significantly constrain the theory ; in order to maximize non - decoupling @xmath0-terms we need the standard model gauge couplings to be as strong as possible , which means that the heavy vector bosons couple with @xmath130 strength to the standard model fermions .",
    "however , because these new vectors are not responsible for cutting off the gauge quadratic divergences to the higgs , they can be quite heavy without fine - tuning .",
    "instead , the heavy vectors cut off divergent contributions to the higgs mass arising from the modified quartic coupling , so the vectors may comfortably lie in the 3  10 tev range .    to see this ,",
    "it is useful to introduce mixing angles @xmath229 for the gauge fields , obeying @xmath230 the heavy vectors , which we denote @xmath231 , couple to the to the mssm via the interaction @xmath232 at low energies the @xmath231 may be integrated out to give the current - current interaction @xmath233 these terms contribute to the @xmath234 extended oblique corrections , which are constrained experimentally , implying a constraint @xcite @xmath235 thus even for @xmath236 the breaking scales can be 3.5 tev and vectors will be under 10 tev .",
    "there are several potential directions for future work . as noted in the text , the theories under consideration are very similar to deconstructed models of gaugino mediation",
    ". it would be interesting to determine whether the link fields can communicate susy breaking to the mssm .",
    "once a susy breaking scenario is specified , either this mechanism or another , it would be possible to discuss spectroscopy and unification in further detail .",
    "it would also be of interest to explore the supersymmetric four higgs doublet in more detail . in principle , the experimental limits on the higgs boson can be modified .",

    "in supersymmetric theories , threshold corrections are constrained by holomorphy .",
    "this technique can be applied to calculate corrections to unification in any model where holomorphy is a useful constraint ( i.e. when there are large supersymmetric masses ) .",
    "our first result is that threshold effects from mass splittings cancel against higher loop corrections @xcite . to see this ,",

    "this can be integrated to give @xmath239 now consider integrating out a massive matter field ( like the link fields , @xmath54 ) .",

    "thus , the @xmath216 that appears in the nsvz formula can be combined with a holomorphic mass to recover a running mass .",
    "so , it is possible to write a rg invariant matching equation exclusively in terms of holomorphic quantities : @xmath243 here @xmath244 and @xmath245 are the low energy and high energy gauge couplings defined at the cut - off @xmath218 ; they have one loop beta functions @xmath246 and @xmath247 respectively that differ by one . using the nsvz beta function",

    "( [ eq : holo match ] ) is equivalent the matching the high energy and low energy gauge couplings at the physical mass scale .",
    "however , eq .  ( [ eq : holo match ] ) is valid all scales , including at the cut - off , where there clearly has been no running to split @xmath241 .",
    "thus , complete gut multiplets will lead to a small deviation from the mssm prediction .",
    "the dominant effect is indirect : the gauge coupling rg trajectories are deflected by the presence of the @xmath54 fields , which in turn contributes to the last term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : int nsvz ] ) for the light mssm fields .",

    "we have also used expressions for the renormalized gauge boson masses : @xmath254 applying the above rg invariant matching condition gives rise to eq .",

    "( [ eq : spurion ] ) , and restricting attention to the field @xmath81 , there is a linear source term : @xmath258 we may shift @xmath81 by a constant to remove this term , @xmath259 solving for @xmath260 and @xmath261 , @xmath262 this shift affects the kahler term for @xmath93 : @xmath263 this expression summarizes how susy breaking is communicated to the vector multiplet .",
