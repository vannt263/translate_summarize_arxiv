    "as recently as 10 years ago , it was generally believed that black holes ( bhs ) occur in two broad mass ranges : stellar ( @xmath0 ) , which are produced by the core collapse of massive stars , and supermassive ( @xmath1 ) , which are believed to have formed in the center of galaxies at high redshift and grown in mass as the result of galaxy mergers ( see e.g. volonteri , haardt & madau 2003 ) .",
    "however , the existence of bhs with masses intermediate between those in the center of galaxies and stellar bhs could not be established by observations up until recently , although intermediate mass bhs ( imbhs ) were predicted by theory more than 30 years ago ; see , e.g. , wyller ( 1970 ) .",
    "indirect evidence for imbhs has accumulated over time from observations of so - called ultraluminous x - ray sources ( ulxs ) , objects with fluxes that exceed the angle - averaged flux of a stellar mass bh accreting at the eddington limit .",
    "an interesting result from observations of ulxs is that many , if not most , of them are associated with star clusters .",
    "it has long been speculated ( e.g. , frank & rees 1976 ) that the centers of globular clusters ( gcs ) may harbor bhs with masses @xmath2 .",
    "if so , these bhs affect the distribution function of the stars , producing velocity and density cusps . a recent study by noyola & gebhardt ( 2006 ) obtained central surface brightness profiles for 38 galactic gcs from hst wfpc2 images .",
    "they showed that half of the gcs in their sample have slopes for the inner 0.5 \" surface density brightness profiles that are inconsistent with simple isothermal cores , which may be indicative of an imbh .",
    "however , it is challenging to explain the full range of slopes with current models . while analytical models can only explain the steepest slopes in their sample , recent n - body models of gcs containing imbhs ( baumgardt et al . 2005 ) , might explain some of the intermediate surface brightness slopes .",
    "in our study we repeat some of the previous n - body simulations of gcs with central imbhs but using the monte - carlo ( mc ) method .",
    "this gives us the advantage to model the evolution of gcs with a larger and thus more realistic number of stars .",
    "we then compare the obtained surface brightness profiles with previous results in the literature .",
    "the dynamical effect of an imbh on the surrounding stellar system was first described by peebles ( 1972 ) , who argued that the bound stars in the cusp around the bh must obey a shallow power - law density distribution to account for stellar consumption near the cluster center . analyzing the fokker - planck equation in energy space for an isotropic stellar distribution ,",
    "bahcall & wolf ( 1976 ) obtained a density profile with @xmath3 , which is now commonly referred to as the bahcall - wolf cusp .",
    "the formation of this cusp has been confirmed subsequently by many different studies using different techniques and also , more recently , by direct @xmath4-body methods ( baumgardt et al . 2004 ) . in fig .",
    "[ imprints ]       shows the two - dimensional density profiles of bright stars for the two clusters at an age of @xmath5 .",
    "the profile in the left panel can directly be compared to the corresponding result of baumgardt et .",
    "al ( 2005 ) as @xmath4 is the same . as was expected from the discussion in ",
    "[ imprintsimbh ] , the profile shows only a very shallow cusp with a power - law slope @xmath6 between @xmath7 and @xmath8 , consistent with the @xmath4-body results .",
    "the right panel shows the resulting profile for a cluster that is similar but twice as massive and , consequently , has twice as many stars as in the @xmath4-body simulation .",
    "we obtain a very similar profile with @xmath9 which is very close to the average @xmath10 found in baumgardt et al .",
    "therefore , based on these very preliminary results , there seems to be no significant difference in cusp slopes for larger-@xmath4 clusters compared to small-@xmath4 ones , which means that no new candidate cluster from the sample of noyola & gebhardt ( 2006 ) can be identified in addition to those found by baumgardt et al .",
    "however , the parameter space must be explored much further in order to confirm this finding ."
