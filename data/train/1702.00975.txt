    "<S> in contrast , the spin seebeck coefficient does not diverge at the spin - flop transition . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the spin seebeck coefficient is finite even at zero magnetic field , provided that the normal metal contacts break the symmetry between the antiferromagnetic sublattices .    _ </S>",
    "<S> introduction_.  antiferromagnets have recently garnered increasing interest in the spintronics community , both for their novel intrinsic properties and their technological potential . </S>",
    "<S> their appealing features are their lack of stray magnetic fields , fast dynamics ( relative to ferromagnets ) , and robustness against external fields @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this last property , however , is a double - edged sword , as the lack of response to an external field makes control of antiferromagnets challenging . </S>",
    "<S> recent theoretical and experimental work has instead sought to generate and/or detect antiferromagnetic dynamics optically @xcite and electrically @xcite .    in ferromagnets , </S>",
    "<S> equilibrium thermal fluctuations generate spin waves that can drive coherent magnetic dynamics @xcite or transport spin @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it is of interest to see if , and how , thermal magnons can provide long - range spin - transport in @xmath1ferromagnetic insulators . </S>",
    "<S> however , in antiferromagnets , at zero magnetic fields , spin - wave excitations are doubly degenerate . </S>",
    "<S> the two branches carry opposite spin polarity . </S>",
    "<S> thus , to realize spin transport by thermally generated spin waves , the symmetry between the antiferromagnetic sublattices must be lifted . </S>",
    "<S> one means of achieving this is to employ a ferromagnetic layer , controlled by a magnetic field @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> alternatively , the magnetic field itself suffices to break the sublattice symmetry , eliminating the need for a ferromagnetic component . the spin seebeck effect @xcite , in which angular momentum is driven by a temperature gradient , was measured @xcite in bipartite electrically insulating antiferromagnets at finite magnetic fields .    </S>",
    "<S> we consider two different scenarios for electrical and thermal experimental generation of spin transport in antiferromagnets without the need for a ferromagnetic component . </S>",
    "<S> the realization of these scenarios can open the doors towards long - range transport of magnons in antiferromagnets that can be strongly enhanced by appropriate tuning of the magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> such achievements could further cultivate antiferromagnets in a more vital role within spintronics .    </S>",
    "<S> the first option is to inject thermal magnons by a spin accumulation in an adjacent metal . while spin accumulation - induced thermal magnon injection in ferromagnet@xmath0normal metal heterostructures has been the subject of recent research @xcite , theoretical ( and experimental ) studies of the @xmath1ferromagnetic analogue are currently lacking and are restricted to coherent magnetic dynamics of the antiferromagnetic order and the resulting spin superfluidity @xcite . here , </S>",
    "<S> we show that the spin conductivity of thermal magnons is strongly enhanced upon approaching the spin - flop transition , and in the ideal case diverges at the transition . </S>",
    "<S> this leads to a large amount of tunability of the magnon transport by an external field which may be desirable for applications .    </S>",
    "<S> a second possibility for engineering magnon spin transport in antiferromagnets is to break the interface sublattice symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> magnetically uncompensated antiferromagnet@xmath0metal interfaces have been studied theoretically @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , the possibility of realizing a spin seebeck effect by breaking the sublattice symmetry at the interface has not been proposed until now .    in this letter </S>",
    "<S> , we use a stochastic landau - lifshitz - gilbert theory @xcite to study these phenomena . </S>",
    "<S> we treat spin transport through a normal metal@xmath0insulating antiferromagnet@xmath0normal metal heterostructure in the linear response to a spin accumulation and temperature gradient . </S>",
    "<S> the magnon conductance is found to be strongly enhanced ( and in the ideal case diverges ) near the onset of the spin - flop transition , while the spin seebeck coefficient does not . including both sublattice symmetry respecting and -breaking terms at the interface , we show that these two contributions may be distinguished by their sign under magnetic field reversal , and that the latter contribution leads to a nonzero seebeck coefficient at zero magnetic field .    _ </S>",
