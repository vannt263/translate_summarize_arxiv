    "the goal of this article is to survey a few of the applications of the moment method ( and its variants ) to the study of the spectral properties of random matrices , particularly , local eigenvalue statistics at the spectral edges .",
    "section  [ s : moment ] is a brief introduction to the moment method , which we understand as the variety of ways to extract the properties of a measure @xmath0 from integrals of the form @xmath1 examples , selected from the narrow part of random matrix theory in which the author feels competent , are intended to illustrate two theses .",
    "first , the moment method can be applied beyond the framework of weak convergence of a sequence of probability measures .",
    "second , it is often convenient to replace the monomials @xmath2 in ( [ eq : moment ] ) with a better - conditioned sequence , such as the sequence of orthogonal polynomials with respect to a measure @xmath3 which is an approximation to @xmath0 .    in section  [ s :",
    "edges ] we review some applications to the local eigenvalue statistics at the spectral edges , starting from the work of soshnikov @xcite .",
    "tracy and widom @xcite and forrester @xcite introduced the airy point processes ( see section  [ s : edges.wig ] ) and showed that they describe the limiting distribution of the largest eigenvalues for special families of large hermitian random matrices with independent entries ( the gaussian invariant ensembles ) .",
    "soshnikov @xcite extended these results to wigner matrices ( hermitian random matrices with independent entries and no invariance assumptions ) . in the terminology of ibragimov and linnik @xcite*chapter vi ,",
    "the result of @xcite is a limit theorem of collective character ; it is one of the instances of the ubiquity ( universality ) of the airy point processes within and outside random matrix theory ( as surveyed , for example , by johansson @xcite , tracy and widom @xcite , and borodin and gorin @xcite ) .    in section  [ s : edges.wigproc ]",
    ", we consider wigner processes , a class of matrix - valued random processes .",
    "informally , a random matrix @xmath4 is attached to every point @xmath5 of an underlying space @xmath6 .",
    "the statistical properties of the eigenvalues of every @xmath4 are described by the theory of wigner matrices ; the joint distribution of the eigenvalues of a tuple @xmath7 leads to limiting objects which depend on the geometry of @xmath6 ( which arises from the correlations of the matrix elements of @xmath8 ) in a non - trivial way .",
    "the moment method allows to derive limit theorems of collective character ( such as theorem  [ thm : wigproc ] ) pertaining to the spectral edges of @xmath4 ( the result of @xcite corresponds to a singleton , @xmath9 ) .    in section  [ s : edges.band ]",
    ", we turn to the spectral edges of random band matrices .",
    "a random band matrix is ( [ eq : band ] ) a random @xmath10 hermitian matrix with non - zero entries in a band of width @xmath11 about the main diagonal .",
    "when @xmath11 is small , a band matrix inherits the structure of the integer lattice @xmath12 ; when @xmath11 is large , it is similar to a wigner matrix . the threshold at which the local eigenvalue statistics in the bulk of the spectrum exhibit a crossover is described by precise conjectures ( see fyodorov and mirlin @xcite , spencer @xcite ) . the moment method allows to prove the counterpart of these conjectures for the spectral edges ( the result of @xcite corresponds to the special case @xmath13 ) .",
    "the content of section  [ s : moment ] is mostly known .",
    "the modified moment method of section  [ s : modif ] is a version of self - energy renormalisation in perturbation theory ( see spencer @xcite ) , related to the arguments of bai and yin @xcite .",
    "orthogonal polynomials were explicitly used in this context in the work of li and sol @xcite , and further in @xcite ( where more references may be found ) .",
    "some observations are incorporated from @xcite .",
    "the content of section  [ s : edges.wigproc ] is an extension of @xcite , whereas section  [ s : edges.band ] is based on @xcite .",
    "the proofs of the results stated in both of these sections build on the combinatorial arguments of @xcite .",
    "the moment method is the collection of techniques inferring the properties of a measure @xmath0 on the @xmath14-dimensional space @xmath15 from the moments @xmath16 introduced by chebyshev as a means to establish gaussian approximation for the distribution of a sum of independent random variables , the moment method achieved its first major success with the proof , given by markov @xcite , of lyapunov s central limit theorem and its extension to sums of weakly dependent random variables .",
    "some of the more recent applications are surveyed by diaconis @xcite .      in the traditional",
    "setting of the moment method , one considers a sequence of probability measures @xmath17 on @xmath15 .",
    "suppose that the limit @xmath18 exists for every @xmath19 .",
    "then the sequence @xmath17 is tight , i.e.   precompact in weak topology ( defined by bounded continuous functions ) , and every one of its limit points @xmath0 satisfies @xmath20 if , for example , @xmath21 the moment problem ( [ eq : moments ] ) is determinate , i.e.  there is a unique measure @xmath3 on @xmath15 satisfying ( [ eq : moments ] ) ; in this case the convergence of moments ( [ eq : momentconv ] ) implies that @xmath22 in weak topology ; cf .",

    "hardy s sufficient condition ( [ eq : expm ] ) may be somewhat relaxed ; we refer to the addenda to the second chapter of the book @xcite of akhiezer for various sufficient criteria for determinacy in the case @xmath23 , and to the survey of berg @xcite for some extensions to @xmath24 .",
    "suppose @xmath17 is a sequence of random measures on @xmath25 ( i.e.  random variables taking values in the space of borel probability measures ) .",

    "wigner s argument is based on the moment method .",
    "bogachev , molchanov , and pastur @xcite observed ( in the context of random band matrices ) that a similar argument can be applied as long as ( [ eq : largekappa ] ) is satisfied .",
    "the first argument for wigner matrices without additional restrictions on the distribution of the entries was given by pastur @xcite , using the stieltjes transform method introduced by marchenko and pastur @xcite ( see pastur @xcite and the book of pastur and shcherbina @xcite for some of the further applications of the method ) .",

    "we refer for details to the book of anderson , guionnet , and zeitouni @xcite*chapter 2.1 , where similar arguments are also applied to questions such as the central limit theorem for linear statistics @xmath66 .    due to ( [ eq : largekappa ] ) , ( [ eq : diag ] ) and ( [ eq : offdiag ] ) one can find a sequence @xmath67 so that @xmath68 consider the matrix @xmath69 with truncated matrix elements @xmath70 then @xmath71 whence , bounding rank by the number of non - zero matrix elements and applying the chebyshev inequality , @xmath72 for any @xmath73 , the interlacing property of rank - one perturbation yields @xmath74 - \\mu_{\\sci ,",
