    "type ia supernovae ( sne ia ) make excellent cosmological standard candles @xcite , though only after they are empirically calibrated based on their lightcurve shape @xcite and color @xcite .",
    "there is consensus that the luminosity of type ia supernovae ( sne ia ) arises from the radioactive decay of @xmath0 to @xmath1 , and finally to @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "therefore , the primary variable controlling sn luminosity is the amount of @xmath0 synthesized during the explosion , though as second - order effects the location of the @xmath0(e.g . * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the opacity of the overlying material , and asymmetries in the ejecta @xcite can redistribute the energy in wavelength , time , or space .",
    "however , because sne ia are largely spherical @xcite , the bulk of @xmath0 is located near the center , and simple assumptions about the opacity are a reasonable approximation , arnett s rule @xcite can be used to empirically estimate the @xmath0 mass from the optical - infrared lightcurve to an accuracy of 5  15% .",
    "the variables that control the yield of @xmath0 in a sn ia are not well understood , although several factors are known to be important .",
    "iron - peak elements are produced when burning occurs in a state of nuclear statistical equilibrium , which happens at the highest densities near the center of the white dwarf .",
    "if this burning occurs in a neutron - rich region , more neutron - rich , stable , iron - peak elements like @xmath3 and @xmath4 will be produced relative to @xmath0 . since main - sequence stars with higher metallicity abundances",
    "produce white dwarfs with more of the neutron - rich nuclides @xmath5 and @xmath2 , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter tbt03 ) hypothesized that high metallicity progenitors will produce less @xmath0 and therefore less luminous sne ia .    in the absence of any identified sn ia progenitor",
    ", the best one could hope for is to see traces of the progenitor s metallicity in the unburned outer layers of the sn by looking at type ia spectra from only a few days after the explosion in the uv @xcite .",
    "unfortunately the difficulty of obtaining uv spectra has prevented the gathering of a statistically significant sample of spectra from the earliest phases . in the case of local sne  ia it has not been possible to schedule hst quickly enough @xcite .",
    "another option is to observe higher redshift sne ia in the restframe uv , though their faintness at such early epochs relative to their host galaxy makes observations earlier than one week before maximum light difficult @xcite . more importantly ,",
    "even when uv spectra have been obtained their theoretical interpretation is not straightforward @xcite .",
    "since a true progenitor metallicity has so far been unobtainable , the next best thing is to determine the average metallicity in the environment of the sn .",
    "the two most commonly used approaches have been to measure spectroscopic line indices @xcite or ratios @xcite to determine a global average host galaxy metallicity , or to take advantage of the fact that galaxies often have metallicity gradients , and study projected galactocentric offset as a proxy for metallicity @xcite .",
    "the drawbacks of the spectroscopic line techniques are that they require complicated corrections for contamination by emission , and that the interpretation of the line ratios as metallicity requires mapping observations to a sometimes - incongruous grid of theoretical models ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "furthermore , the line ratios only represent the current average metallicity  the metallicity when the sn ia progenitor formed may have been different .",
    "in addition , high signal - to - noise ratio spectra are required , and important lines like h@xmath6 are redshifted into the ir at @xmath7 .",
    "these factors limit the possible sample size of such a data set .",
    "the drawbacks of the offset technique are that projection effects can be confusing @xcite , as is differential reddening between sne near and far from galaxy centers @xcite , and malmquist - like effects @xcite .",
    "further complications include that different galaxy types have different metallicity gradients , and the current location of the sn may not be representative of where the progenitor formed .    with the exception of @xcite , hereafter g08 , none of the above studies found a significant correlation between metallicity and sn ia properties , although it is not clear whether this is caused by the lack of an effect or whether the techniques used so far do not have the required level of precision .",
    "g08 compared absorption - line strengths of 29 e / s0 galaxies which hosted sne ia to a grid of models and found that galaxies with high iron abundances host less luminous supernovae .",
    "they went on to conclude that age played a greater role , since galaxies with characteristic ages greater than 5 gyr produce @xmath8 mag fainter sne ia in @xmath9 .",
    "their most controversial finding is that the mlcs lightcurve fitter could not fully correct for sn luminosities in different metallicity environments ; when hubble residuals were correlated with metallicity , they found a significant trend .",
    "but since these findings are based on a small sample size , rely on an uncertain metallicity determination techniques , and rely entirely on a lightcurve fitter ( mlcs2k2 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) that has recently shown spurious systematic trends with hubble residuals @xcite , they are worth scrutinizing with independent techniques and a much larger sample size .",
    "here we use an independent approach not previously applied to testing sn luminosity - metallicity relations  we estimate the host galaxy metallicity from its mass using spectral energy distribution ( sed ) fits to the host galaxy photometry and the @xcite mass - metallicity relation .",
    "another discriminator of the metallicity effect is that it may cause luminosity differences as a function of redshift , since cosmic metallicity is increasing with time ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "this is in contrast to many other possible contributors to sn ia luminosity ( for example , white dwarf core density ) which would not be expected to change with redshift .",
    "we perform the first tests of the effect of inferred metallicity on sn ia nickel mass with high redshift supernovae , using data from the supernova legacy survey ( snls ) .    in this paper",
    "we first update the tbt03 sn ia metallicity-@xmath0 mass relation to account for the fact that o / fe can vary as a function of fe / h (  2 ) .",
    "then we test the theory using data from the snls . to do this , in  3.1",
    "we estimate host galaxy masses from pegase-2 model fits to @xmath10(subscripts denote megacam filters ) host galaxy photometry . in ",
    "3.2 we use galaxy mass - metallicity relations to estimate host metallicities . in  3.3 we determine sn @xmath0 mass from snls photometry .",
    "finally , we test the theory with the data in  4 and discuss the implications in  5 .",
    "tbt03 note that a white dwarf s @xmath5 abundance should trace its progenitor star s o abundance since c , n , and o are converted to @xmath11  during hydrogen burning ( @xmath12 is the slowest step in the cno cycle ) , and this @xmath11  is converted to @xmath5 during core helium burning . since @xmath5 is neutron - rich , its presence during the burning in the type ia supernova favors the production of stable , neutron - rich nuclides like @xmath3 and @xmath4 at the expense of radioactive @xmath0 , the decay of which powers the supernova .",
    "thus , more metal - rich progenitors are expected to produce dimmer sne  ia .",
    "the progenitor star s abundance of @xmath2 is also important , but one possible limitation of tbt03 is that metallicity was treated as a single variable , i.e. tbt03 make the simplifying assumption that o / fe is constant relative to fe / h . in reality",
    "o / fe varies as a function of fe / h ( with a great deal of scatter ) , at least in the solar neighborhood , and the degree of variation is expected to vary with the history of star formation . here",
    "we refine the estimate of the mass of @xmath0 to include changes in the relative abundances of o and fe .",
    "tbt03 showed that @xmath13 , the mass of @xmath0 synthesized in the explosion , depended on the electron abundance @xmath14 , @xmath15 here @xmath16 is the mass of @xmath0 synthesized at an electron abundance @xmath17 , i.  e. for a pure c - o white dwarf",

    "electron captures at high densities . to a good approximation",
    ", we can consider the white dwarf to consist of @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath5 , and @xmath2 .",
    "the electron abundance is then @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the abundance of nuclide @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 being the mass fraction and atomic mass number , respectively . since @xmath5 is derived from the aboriginal cno abundances of the progenitor main - sequence star , @xmath25 .",

    "this formula includes the secondary production of nitrogen at high metallicity and agrees with derived abundance ratios from the sdss @xcite .",

    "writing @xmath32 and @xmath33 , setting @xmath34 @xcite , and inserting equation  ( [ e.ye-def ] ) into equation  ( [ e.base ] ) gives @xmath35 the factor of 58 comes from the assumption that the two dominant nuclides in the burn to nuclear statistical equilibrium are @xmath0 and @xmath3 .",
    "in actuality @xmath4 is also present , and the ratio of @xmath4 to @xmath3 depends on the thermal conditions of the explosion ( tbt03 ) , so that the coefficient varies between 58 and 54 . as shown by tbt03 , this results is a small scatter ( @xmath36 at @xmath37 ) about the relation in eq .",

    "they give an `` effective mass '' versus redshift relation ( @xcite equation 9 ) , which we use here to adapt the @xcite and @xcite relations to the redshifts of our galaxies .",
    "technically the @xcite relationship only covers gas phase metallicity , and is not guaranteed to be applicable in elliptical galaxies , where there is generally little cold gas .",
    "still , there are several reasons not to dismiss the sample of passive galaxies from this analysis .",
    "first , the amount of star formation in these galaxies is inferred from their broadband colors , not from spectroscopy or morphology , so the presence of gas is not ruled out .",
    "second , because the mechanism for retaining metals is the depth of the galaxy gravitational potential well , one might still expect ellipticals to follow this trend , independent of the presence of gas .",
    "the sn progenitor was born when there was star formation , and thus much more gas in the galaxy .",
    "finally , we caution that stellar metallicity and gas phase metallicity are not identical , though they are correlated ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the mass of @xmath0 can be estimated from the peak bolometric luminosity and the rise time of a sn ia using arnett s rule @xcite , that the luminosity radiated at maximum light is approximately equal to the energy deposited by radioactive decay : @xmath70 where @xmath71 is the ratio of bolometric to radioactivity luminosities , near unity .",
    "here we adopt a value of @xmath72 @xcite to be consistent with previous snls work @xcite , though a global change to this number does not affect our conclusions .",

    "the heating from the decay of @xmath0 is primarily from the radiative decay of the 1.7 mev nuclear level in @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "we include contributions from the positron decay branching in the heating from the decay of @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "the least straightforward part of determining @xmath0 mass from sn ia lightcurves is estimating the bolometric luminosity from incomplete data .",
    "for rare , very well - observed supernovae with data spanning much of the uvoir ( ultraviolet , optical , infrared ) region , all of the flux can be added , and only a small correction is necessary for missing data . however ,",
    "this has to date only been possible for small numbers ( @xmath79 ) of low - redshift supernovae . because the best - observed supernovae tend to be the closest and brightest , and thus not in the hubble flow , these sne often have uncertain distances and luminosities .",
    "other authors have used the luminosity in a single band , combined with a bolometric correction , to estimate the bolometric flux ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this allows the study of greater numbers of supernovae , achieving enhanced global accuracy , at the expense of individual accuracy .",
    "it also makes possible the study of high redshift supernovae where the restframe nir is inaccessible .",
    "bolometric corrections work well at maximum light for type ia supernovae , because the peak of emission is always in the restframe @xmath80 band , near 4000  ( in the absence of strong reddening ) .",
    "figure  [ cumflux ] ( bottom panel ) shows a typical sn ia spectral energy distribution at maximum light ( from @xcite , updated with nir data ) .",
    "the upper panel shows the cumulative flux as a function of wavelength .",
    "only @xmath81 of the sn ia flux is emitted in the uv shorward of the @xmath82 filter , and less than 10% is emitted in the ir.m  since there is no evidence for significant sn ia flux outside of this range , we assume it to be negligible . ] since roughly one - quarter of the sn ia flux is emitted in the @xmath80 band , and this fraction is relatively constant from sn to sn , it is easy to see why the @xmath80 band is the most commonly used indicator of sn ia luminosity .    here",
    "we adopt a new approach to bolometric flux estimation that exploits the excellent multiwavelength coverage of snls supernovae . for each snls",
    "sn ia , we smoothly adjust ( i.e. `` warp '' ) the hsiao sed template so that it has the observed fluxes in @xmath83 .",
    "we then integrate the template sed over the wavelength interval where we have observations , and correct for the unobserved fraction .",
    "we turn this bolometric observed flux into a luminosity using the redshift and a flat cosmology with @xmath84=70 km s@xmath85 mpc@xmath85 and @xmath86 .",
    "an example is shown in figure  [ bolint ] .",
    "note that this process uses much of the same machinery as the sifto lightcurve fitter @xcite .",
    "the first step , warping the sed to match the observed colors , is identical . but",
    "in the next step the methods diverge  sifto calculates the restframe flux of sn through another filter , whereas here we calculate the integrated flux over the region spanning all observed filters .",
    "mathematically , we define @xmath87 as the fraction of the bolometric flux covered by our observations , such that : @xmath88 where @xmath89 is the hsiao sn ia sed template , @xmath90 is the wavelength at 1/5 the filter height of the bluest filter for which there is data , and @xmath91 is the wavelength at 1/5 the filter height of the reddest filter for which there is data .",
    "the choice of 1/5 of the filter height as the cutoff is arbitrary  changing it does not affect our results .",
    "we define @xmath92 as the sed after it is warped to match the observed colors , so that the bolometric flux is @xmath93 flux errors are given by the sifto covariance matrix ( see * ? ? ?",
    "errors on the other quantities are : @xmath94 @xmath95 based on constraints from theory ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* ) , and from estimating @xmath0 using different empirical methods , we adopt @xmath96 and generally this term dominates the error budget .",

    "the complication is that the observed color is a mixture of reddening due to dust ( which should be corrected for ) , and intrinsic sn color ( which should not be corrected ) .",
    "if the color correction were primarily due to normal dust , it would be expected to follow the milky way extinction law @xcite , but it does not ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",

    "there are theoretical reasons to expect , and some evidence , that the majority of sne ia suffer little extinction @xcite , though some of the reddest outliers surely have significant dust extinction . as our primary result , we chose to make a color cut @xcite to eliminate the most extincted sne rather than making an uncertain extinction correction @xcite .",

    "the probability that the @xmath0 yields from high and low metallicity hosts were drawn from the same distribution , according to the kolmogorov - smirnov ( ks ) test is @xmath111 .",
    "it is possible that the above results overestimate the scatter in sn ia @xmath0 mass , if significant dust extinction remains after the color cut described in ",
    "[ method ] . to test this",

    "as expected , the scatter is reduced  now only 0.12 @xmath109  must be added in quadrature to the error bars to give @xmath110 . since this color correction includes an intrinsic sn ia color correction as well as a dust correction , it will over - correct the sn ia magnitudes , but we do it to get an estimate of the limiting case . if sne ia are color - corrected using @xmath112 @xcite , the scatter is reduced to a range of 0.6 @xmath109  in @xmath0 for all but a few outliers .",
    "thus the upper limit on the tbt03 metallicity effect is @xmath113 .      since there is an age - metallicity degeneracy , it is difficult to separate effects that may be caused by metallicity from those that may be caused by age of the progenitor .",
    "an age - brightness effect must exist for sne ia , since both sn rate and average luminosity are increased in young stellar populations .",
    "figure  [ ageni ] confirms that there is a correlation between sn @xmath74ni mass and host luminosity - weighted age as estimated from pegase.2 models  the slope of the line is significant at @xmath114 .",
    "this correlation is understandably noisy ",
    "the pegase.2 luminosity - weighted age is merely an indicator of the mean age of an entire galaxy ",
    "the sn progenitor may have a very different age .",
    "any age - brightness relation must be related to with the mass of the secondary star  in an old population more massive secondaries do not exist . but this is difficult to understand in the chandrasekhar mass model  if all sne ia explode when the primary nears the chandrasekhar mass , why should the mass of the secondary matter ? this might be an indication that the binary evolution and mass transfer history , which is strongly dependent on the mass of the secondary , influences the outcome of the explosion .",
    "figure [ ni3p ] shows @xmath0 mass vs. 12+log(o / h ) in three stretch bins .",
    "the most striking finding is that low stretch ( @xmath115 ) sne ia almost exclusively occur in galaxies with high implied metallicity , roughly above - solar . at the highest stretches ( @xmath116 ) ,",
    "the inferred @xmath0 mass is relatively insensitive to inferred host galaxy metallicity .",
    "also , the scatter in @xmath0 mass is lower for low stretch sne ia .",
    "this is likely due to several factors . for the low - stretch sne , on the high side the @xmath0 mass",
    "is limited by the stretch cut , and on the low side it is limited by selection effects  it is difficult to find and spectroscopically confirm the lowest - stretch sne .",
    "but there is also some evidence that sne ia in passive galaxies , which predominantly host low stretch sne ia , make better standard candles @xcite .",
    "some of this lower dispersion is likely due to lower dust extinction in these hosts , but it is also possible that moderately low - stretch sne ia are intrinsically more uniform as a population than high stretch sne ia @xcite .",
    "g08 found a trend between sn ia host galaxy metallicity and residuals from the hubble diagram , indicating the lightcurve fitter used , mlcs2k2 , can not correct for the full range of sn ia properties .",
    "since the demographics of supernovae are known to evolve with redshift @xcite , any problem fully correcting sn ia magnitudes could have dire consequences for sn ia cosmology . @xcite",
    "cite a 9% systematic error in the measurement of the dark energy equation of state , @xmath117 , larger than the current best statistical errors on @xmath117 .",
    "however , using our independent metallicity indicator and the sifto lightcurve fitter we find no systematic trend in hubble residual vs. inferred host galaxy metallicity .",
    "the results are shown in figure  [ residmetal ] , where the sne ia include those from sample , but we apply no redshift or color cut .",
    "the solid line shows the best fit to the data , based on a markov chain monte carlo analysis ( linmix in idl ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which takes into account errors on the x - axis , and is allowed to add extra scatter to the data ( here 0.11 mag ) to achieve the best fit .",
    "the slope of the best - fit line , @xmath118 is consistent with 0 at the @xmath119 level , and is inconsistent with the g08 slope of 0.26 at @xmath120 . in 10,000 monte carlo simulations , none produced a slope as steep at that found by g08 .",
    "possible explanations for the difference between our results and those of g08 include that sifto can correct for differences in sn ia properties that the current version of mlcs2k2 can not , that one or the other metallicity indicator produces systematically flawed results , or that there are selection effects such that we are not comparing similar samples .",
    "we examine each hypothesis in turn .",
    "* sifto vs. mlcs : * recently @xcite found evidence for a `` hubble bubble '' local sne ia fit with mlcs2k2 give a different hubble constant than do sne ia well into the hubble flow .",
    "@xcite considered this to be a 6% systematic error on @xmath117 .",
    "however , @xcite did not see the same effect with either the sifto or salt2 lightcurve fitters , and traced the discrepancy to problems in the way mlcs2k2 handled dust extinction .",
    "mlcs2k2 assumed color excess beyond any assumed intrinsic sn ia color relation is due to @xmath121 ( average milky way dust ) , though this appears not to be appropriate ( salt2 and sifto do an empirical fit to determine color - luminosity relationships ) .",
    "g08 do not provide enough information to determine whether a spurious reddening correction is driving their result .",
    "* flawed metallicity indicators : * since we can not make a definitive statement about whether the @xmath122-axis of figure  [ residmetal ] ( or the equivalent figure in g08 ) is flawed , the next culprit to examine is the @xmath123-axis .",
    "no metallicity indicator is perfect  the various caveats throughout the text attest to the limitations of our adopted method . estimating a metallicity through a mass - metallicity relationship and determining the mass from photometry is certainly indirect .",
    "still , it should be correct on average , especially since we are probing several orders of magnitude in mass , ranging from @xmath124 to @xmath125 , and more than 1 dex in metallicity .",
    "a stronger argument is that there seems to be no way to rearrange the points on the @xmath123-axis of figure  [ residmetal ] to produce the g08 relation . on the other hand ,",
    "it is possible to imagine that the @xmath123-axis of the upper left panel of g08 fig .",
    "9 could be systematically flawed .",
    "the four points with the highest metallicity drive the relation .",
    "these four sne all have e / s0 hosts with ages less than 3 gyr , among the lowest in the g08 sample .",
    "thus , the hosts of these sne ia are the most likely to have h@xmath126 emission contaminating the h@xmath126 absorption line index . nominally this is used to determine age , but because of the age - metallicity degeneracy , it also affects the metallicity determination . as can be seen from g08 figure 2 , when the emission correction is applied 1/3 to 1/2 of their sample either falls off or is moved onto their theoretical age - metallicity grid .",
    "even after correction , eight of their sne ia are more than @xmath127 too high off the grid , and their metallicities are extrapolations .    * selection effects : * since g08 target nearby sne ia in e / s0 hosts , they study many sne ia too dim to show up in a magnitude - limited sample like the snls .",
    "but the four sne with high metallicities driving the g08 hubble residual trend are all of normal magnitude @xmath128 , not the type absent from the snls sample .",
    "the metallicity range is also similar for the two studies , spanning a range @xmath129 dex relative to solar .",
    "but if the differences between the two studies were due to some unknown selection effect , an important point is that it will not produce a systematic effect on cosmology , because the snls sample reflects cosmology as it is actually practiced , and we have shown that it produces unbiased hubble residuals .",
    "we find that host galaxies with a higher inferred metallicity produce sne ia with less @xmath0 on average .",
    "the effect proposed by tbt03 , increased neutronization in higher metallicity environments , can qualitatively explain this trend , though there remains additional scatter in sn ia luminosity that can not be explained by the theory .",
    "tbt03 predict that sne ia in high metallicity environments should be 25% dimmer than those in low metallicity galaxies , though most of the dynamic range in this prediction occurs at metallicities several times solar .",
    "we have shown that snls supernovae occur in galaxies where the implied average metallicity is a few tenths of a dex above solar or below , and in this range the theory predicts only a 0.06 @xmath109  change in @xmath0 mass .",
    "the _ average _ @xmath0 yield does appear to decrease in metal - rich galaxies in accordance with the theory , but the large scatter ( 0.2  1.0 @xmath109 , or @xmath130",
    "@xmath109  with color correction ) , indicates that the theorized metallicity effect has at most a 7%10% effect on @xmath0 yield .",
    "the luminosity of sne ia appears to be dominated by other effects , possibly those caused by the age of the progenitor .",
    "we find a correlation between host galaxy luminosity - weighted age and sn @xmath0 yield .",
    "this indicates that more massive stars ( explicitly , massive secondaries , since they set the timescale for explosion in binaries ) , produce more luminous explosions , a result not well understood if most sne ia explode near the chandrasekhar mass .",
    "we have also shown that allowing for changes in o / fe with the metallicity [ fe / h ] does not have a major effect on the theoretical prediction of tbt03 for metallicities within the observed range of our sample , so long as one is using the o / h as the independent variable .",
    "unlike g08 , we find no trends between residuals from the hubble diagram and host metallicity .",
    "we conclude that metallicity is not a significant systematic error for the measurement of @xmath117 .",
    "the g08 finding may be due to problems with their lightcurve fitter , mlcs2k2 , or with their method of host metallicity determination which relies on an uncertain correction for h@xmath126 emission , and the extrapolation of theoretical models to cover the host galaxies of sne ia which fall off the grid .",
    "these findings are broadly consistent with the range of local sn ia host galaxy metallicities found by @xcite , though we differ in how we compare the model to the data , and in the interpretation of the results . despite using completely different methodology and data ,",
    "both studies find that the majority of sn hosts have a metallicity between 8.4 @xmath131 log ( o / h ) + 12 @xmath131 9.1 .",
    "additionally we find several lower metallicity , low mass hosts .",
    "these are underrepresented in low redshift searches which target large , higher - mass galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "but rather than convert the observations to @xmath0 mass , @xcite converted the tbt03 model prediction into an expected difference in @xmath132   @xcite .",
    "they found a fairly steep evolution in the @xmath132  model prediction over the observed range in host o / h , in contrast to the flat prediction over the same range found here ( fig . [ metal ] ) and in tbt03 .",
    "this is because they used the delayed detonation models of @xcite and the empirical relations of @xcite to convert the model to the observed parameter @xmath132 .",
    "the @xcite models had a varying detonation transition density , so @xcite found a steeper relation than one would derive if only o / h were varied while holding the other properties of the explosion fixed . as a result , they concluded that the tbt03 prediction is a poor fit to the data , whereas we find that it could account for some of the variation in sn ia properties , but it is not the dominant effect .",
    "our findings are also consistent with @xcite , who roughly estimated that the tbt03 theory could only explain a small fraction of sn ia luminosity based on average snls sn ia stretches reported in @xcite and average sn host metallicity estimated from the galaxy types in @xcite .",
    "one caveat regarding our findings is that we are using a proxy for the global average galaxy metallicity  we have no way of knowing the actual progenitor s metallicity .",
    "one could imagine an effect that would skew the results , such as an enhanced sn rate in metal - poor or metal - rich environments , or similar diminution of the rate in either environment , such that the average sn metallicity would not be representative of the average metallicity in the galaxy .",
    "while there has been speculation from time to time that such effects could in principle exist , there is no observational evidence that they do .",
    "the absolute calibration of the mass - metallicity relationship is also uncertain @xcite , but changing it would have the main effect of moving all points in fig .",
    "[ metal ] to slightly lower or higher metallicities .",
    "our conclusions would remain unchanged  that the metallicity effect can only account for a fraction of the scatter in sn ia luminosities .",
    "@xcite find that weak reactions during low - level burning in the white dwarf in the @xmath133 years leading up to explosion ( i.e. simmering ) may increase the neutron excess .",
    "this effect may set a `` floor '' to the level of neutronization that dominates over the tbt03 metallicity effect at low metallicities @xmath134 .",
    "@xcite also find that simmering can increase neutronization .",
    "since neutronization effects during simmering depend on the degree of simmering , and at least to first order do not appear to depend on metallicity , it is possible that simmering could wash out the tbt03 metallicity effect .",
    "significant uncertainties , including the role of the convective urca process , remain , and further study is required . at",
    "the very least it seems that simmering can not enhance the tbt03 metallicity effect enough to account for the significant scatter in sn ia luminosities @xcite .",
    "one additional caveat is that it is possible that a change in metallicity could alter the explosion mechanism itself , not just whether the process produces more @xmath0 or @xmath3 .",
    "@xcite found that laminar flame speed also depends on the metallicity , but this is probably a higher - order effect . at any rate , this process is so poorly understood that it is not yet possible to test this effect with observations .",
