    "higher dimensional theories have been at the center of interest in recent decades .",
    "they emerge as necessary ingredients of string theory and when utilized with branes and warped compactification , provide great phenomenological implications such as hierarchy problem in field theories @xcite or cosmological constant problem in gravitational theories @xcite . embedding our 4-dimensional world as a brane in a higher dimensional spacetime brings us more chance to capture higher dimensions in accessible energy scales in high energy accelerators such as lhc .    for a long time",
    ", the salam - sezgin supergravity in 6-dimension @xcite has attracted attentions as a relatively simple model to study the warp compactifications @xcite .",
    "it has the advantage that can be derived from string theory and has a consistent bosonic truncation @xcite .",
    "the bosonic part of the model contains graviton , dilaton , a 2-form @xmath0 , and a 3-form @xmath1 field . in most of brane - world scenarios , based on the salam - sezgin model , @xmath1 field",
    "was set to zero and a 4-dimensional lorentz symmetric compactification was presented @xcite .",
    "the perturbation around this symmetric background and modification to the newtonian gravity was studied in @xcite .    including @xmath1 field",
    "was firstly done in @xcite where a static model obtained and searching for a dynamical metric was followed in @xcite . in @xcite",
    "an axially symmetric internal space was introduced , where the radial direction was cut by two 4-branes which wrapped over the azimuthal circle .",
    "smeared 3-branes and zero - branes were also introduced to satisfy israel junction conditions .    since @xmath1 is a 3-form , turning it on",
    "presumably violates the lorentz symmetry . indeed in the presence of the @xmath1 field",
    ", an asymmetry shows up in the metric as the warp factors for time and space are different .",
    "this asymmetric warping had been studied before in different models , sometimes known as time warp @xcite .",
    "however , it was shown that the warp factor can be made to be symmetric at the physical brane which restores the lorentz symmetry on the brane .",
    "this is interesting for standard model fields which are confined on the brane , but does nt save the lorentz invariance for gravity modes which inherently propagate in all directions including off the brane . the lorentz violation is claimed to be one of the most efficient way to explore new physics and important to those who are curious in the relation of gravitational and quantum phenomena @xcite .    on the other hand , the importance of the model in @xcite is bypassing a no - go theorem originated from the null energy condition @xcite . the no - go theorem states that the internal space for any asymmetric warp compactification in @xmath2 , indeed can not be compact , unless the null energy condition violated .",
    "so any lorentz violation scenario based on higher dimensional gravity is restricted by the no - go theorem @xcite .",
    "the silence of the no - go theorem in @xmath3 dimension makes the model @xcite a candidate for the gravitational lorentz violation in higher dimensions without violating the null energy condition .    in this article",
    ", we follow @xmath1 field model in @xcite , consider the spatial tensor perturbation of metric and derive gravitational wave equation .",
    "the equation is accompanied by boundary conditions at branes . since it is too complicated to be solved analytically , we perform numerical analysis to find a solution .",
    "results involve the graviton spectrum including a massless mode with a mass gap for higher modes .",
    "positive definiteness of the spectrum indicates the stability of the model as long as tensorial perturbation is concerned .",
    "phenomenologically , finding a massless state with a mass gap is interesting and shows that the effective four dimensional gravity can be obtained in this model .",
    "as expected , the graviton propagation generates an energy - momentum dispersion relation which violates the lorentz symmetry .",
    "our numerical results show that the phase velocity as @xmath4 in some range of energy exceeds the limit 1 .",
    "this says that while the electromagnetic wave speed is already 1 on the brane - world , the gravitational wave speed limit is over 1 due to the asymmetric warp factor .",
    "this is an explicit example of gravitational lorentz violation while the null energy condition is satisfied .",
    "in this section we give a brief introduction to the model in @xcite .",
    "let us begin by the bosonic part of salam - sezgin lagrangian as @xmath5 where @xmath6 , @xmath0 and @xmath1 are respectively dilaton , 2 and 3-form fields .",
    "the constant @xmath7 may also be recognized as the cosmological constant .",
    "equation of motion governing each field is obtained as follows ,    [ setup - eq2 ] @xmath8    we also take the space - time described by @xmath9 for later convenience we take @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "now @xmath12 are dimensionless cylindrical coordinates and @xmath13 stand for compactification radii of extra dimensions . inserting the metric ansatz into field equations ,",
    "a natural gauge condition for fixing parameter @xmath14 seems to be @xmath15 that leads to following solution : @xmath16 where @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 are some constants , and auxiliary functions @xmath21 and @xmath22 satisfy @xmath23 with @xmath24 being another constant , @xmath25 and @xmath26 are now dimensionless .",
    "the absolute value of extra dimension originates from the fact that to avoid any singularity , one needs to cut the geometry , say between 0 and @xmath27 , then double it to find a periodic solution between @xmath28 and @xmath27 .",
    "finally we have a compactified space in @xmath29 interval with a @xmath30 symmetry and absolute values appear at boundaries .",
    "the topology of the internal space would be a cylinder with two boundaries .    before going on the boundary conditions and introducing branes ,",
    "let us make some comments on the solution and parameters involved .",
    "the general form of @xmath31 from the solution of first equation is one of @xmath32/@xmath33 or @xmath34 functions corresponding to the value of @xmath35 to be @xmath36/@xmath37 or @xmath38 , respectively .",
    "here we take the positive sign and , without loss of generality , assume that @xmath24 is positive as well . equations ( [ setup - eq5 ] ) then read @xmath39 where @xmath40 s are integration constants .",
    "notice that solutions to in the limit @xmath41 and @xmath42 are @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "however the hyperbolic functions in eqs .   could not essentially reduce to these limiting solutions , unless the constants @xmath40 s are chosen properly .",
    "this can be done by rewriting , for example , @xmath31 in as @xmath45 and then taking logarithm of both sides and let @xmath46 , the limiting solution @xmath43 can be achieved as @xmath47 . in the same way , @xmath48 .",
    "the solutions to eqs .",
    "are therefore : @xmath49 with @xmath50 .",
    "now inserting metric functions into the @xmath51component of einstein equation , one finds the constraint @xmath52 that reduces number of independent constants by one .",
    "introducing boundaries and including absolute value in the solution suggests some branes as delta function singularities which arise as second derivative of absolute values .",

    "however , we keep this constant for further simplification .",
    "before study the gravitational perturbation in the above background , it is worth to pause for a while and consider the null energy condition .",
    "this condition appears as a constraint for a matter distribution to be physical in the context of classical general relativity .",
    "it simply states that for any null vector @xmath72 , the following inequality holds for the energy momentum tensor , @xmath73 since @xmath74 is a null vector using the einstein equation one finds , @xmath75 to be specific , let us choose @xmath76 , so turns to @xmath77 .",

    "the weight function suggests to adopt the normalization of wave function as @xmath150 , and consequently define the expectation value of a given function @xmath151 as @xmath152 .",

    "it is possible to study this radial mode and its spectrum as well . since the radion field propagates in the bulk",
