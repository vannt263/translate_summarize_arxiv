    "the mass , @xmath0 , of an isolated main - sequence star can be determined from its absolute luminosity , @xmath1 , and the mass  luminosity relation , @xmath2 } , \\tau,\\mbox{\\boldmath$s$})$ ] .",
    "the corresponding mass(absolute - magnitude ) relation is @xmath3 , where @xmath4 represents some photometric pass band , and the other parameters have been dropped for conciseness . for galactic disc stars with @xmath5 ,",
    "the stellar age is usually @xmath6  gyr , [ fe / h]@xmath7 and the dependence on the stellar spin , @xmath8 , is not significant .",
    "the continuous distribution of stars by luminosity is related to the distribution by mass through @xmath9 , where @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the lf and mf , respectively .",
    "the differential volume number density of stars in the absolute - magnitude interval @xmath12 to @xmath13 is @xmath14 , which is also the differential number density of stars , @xmath15 , in the mass range @xmath0 to @xmath16 .",
    "the conversion of an observed lf to the mf is demonstrated in fig .  1 using two well - cited examples from the literature .",
    "the mf is a good approximation to the initial mass function ( imf ) for stars with @xmath17 , because they do not evolve appreciably within the age of the galactic disc .",
    "the mass-@xmath18 data compiled by henry & mccarthy ( 1993 , hereinafter hm93 ) suggest that the @xmath19 relations adopted by miller & scalo ( 1979 , hereinafter ms ) and scalo ( 1986 , hereinafter sc ) assign masses that may be somewhat too small for stars with @xmath20 .",
    "as shown in section  4 , theoretical work on the structure of low - mass stars confirms that there is additional structure in the @xmath19 relation near this magnitude .",
    "this is an important point ( dantona & mazzitelli 1983 , hereinafter dam83 ) because @xmath21 , and thus any mis - understood structure in the @xmath19 relation carries through to unphysical structure in the mf .",
    "the slope , @xmath22 , becomes small at the faintest magnitudes and is not very well determined .",
    "this holds true in other photometric passbands as well ( hm93 ) and leads to large uncertainties in the mf near the hydrogen burning mass limit .    in fig .",
    "1 the imf , @xmath11 , is plotted as the volume number density per unit mass interval .",
    "this is obtained from the imf , @xmath23)$ ] , expressed as the surface number density per unit logarithmic mass interval .",
    "it is is given by eqn .",
    "30 in ms for a constant star formation rate and a galactic disc age @xmath24  gyr ( their table  7 ) , and by sc in his table  vii for @xmath24  gyr .",
    "the conversion is @xmath25)/(2\\,h\\,m\\,{\\rm ln}(10))$ ] , where @xmath26 is the galactic disc thickness .",
    "the miller & scalo imf , @xmath27 , continues to increase down to @xmath28 .",
    "the scalo imf , @xmath29 , on the other hand , has a significant maximum at @xmath30 .",
    "the reason for the difference is the adopted lf , measurement of which has been improved significantly between 1979 and  1986 through star - count surveys in the solar neighbourhood ( wielen , jahreiss & krger 1983 ) and on deep photographic plates ( reid & gilmore 1982 , hereinafter rg ) .    both @xmath27 and @xmath29 have a dip near @xmath31 .",
    "this results because star - count data have to be corrected for the loss of the more massive stars through stellar evolution , and because @xmath32 is smaller for the more massive stars .",
    "the dip can be minimised by choosing an appropriate age for the galactic disc ( @xmath33  gyr ) and star - formation history . for stars brighter than @xmath34 ,",
    "the galactic disc thickness decreases from @xmath35  pc to @xmath36  pc ( e.g. fig .",
    "10 in sc ) leading to an enhancement of the volume density of brighter stars near the galactic plane .",
    "an additional reason for the dip in @xmath29 is that the lf adopted by sc shows such a feature at @xmath37 .",
    "this is recognised to be real ( upgren & armandroff 1981 ) and a result of stellar physics ( dam83 ; kroupa , tout & gilmore 1990 , hereinafter ktg90 ) .",
    "the intricate details of the transformation of an observed single - star lf to the imf , taking account of the varying @xmath32 , the birth - rate history of stars and stellar evolution , can be found in sc and haywood , robin & crz ( 1997 ) . concerning low - mass stars , we know today that ( i ) the smooth @xmath19 relation used by ms and sc is not consistent with stellar models , and that ( ii ) the lfs adopted by ms and sc do not correctly represent the distribution of single stars with luminosity .",
    "consequently , the mfs plotted in fig .  1",
    "do not correctly describe the spectrum of stellar masses .    since  1986 ,",
    "constraints on the lf have been improved ( section  2 ) , the understanding of malmquist bias has advanced considerably ( section  3 ) , the observational and theoretical constraints on the mass  luminosity relation have been improved ( section  4 ) , and the characteristics of the binary star population in the galactic field is much better quantified ( section  5 ) .",
    "discussions of the mf in the substellar regime can be found in laughlin & bodenheimer ( 1993 ) , basri & marcy ( 1997 ) , chabrier ( these proceedings ) , and jones ( these proceedings ) .",
    "a review of the faint end of the lf can also be found in bessell & stringfellow ( 1993 ) .",
    "trigonometric parallaxes are used to infer the lf for the stars in the immediate neighbourhood of the sun , where most multiple - star systems have been identified .",
    "completeness extends , for northern declinations , to  20  pc for stars with @xmath38 , but severe incompleteness sets in beyond 5  pc for stars with @xmath39 ( jahreiss 1994 , henry et al .",
    "estimates of the nearby lf , @xmath40 , using somewhat different sampling volumes , are provided by wielen et al .",
    "( 1983 ) , dahn , liebert & harrington ( 1986 , hereinafter dlh ) and ktg93 in the v - band , and by hm90 in the k - band .",
    "three additional stars have been found recently within 5.3  pc : gl  866c with @xmath41 ( henry , private communication ; see also simons , henry & kirkpatrick 1996 and kroupa 1995a ) , lp  94420 with @xmath42 ( kirkpatrick , henry & irwin 1997 ) , and lhs  1565 with @xmath43 ( henry et al .",
    "however , @xmath40 remains poorly constrained for @xmath39 , and the contribution by faint main - sequence stars to the mass of the galactic disc remains unclear .",
    "other techniques have been developed with the aim of improving the constraints on the lf at the faint end .",
    "rg made deep photographic exposures with a schmidt telescope ( see also hawkins , these proceedings ) to probe the distribution of faint main sequence stars to distances of about 100  pc .",
    "they used an automatic plate measuring machine to identify galactic - disc red - dwarf stars from the hundred thousand images recorded on a typical schmidt - telescope plate in the direction of the south galactic pole .",
    "at least two photometric pass bands are necessary to define the colours of the objects , and multiple exposures on different plates are used to confirm images .",
    "the sample of possible red dwarf stars is contaminated by red giants for typically @xmath44 , and galaxies dominate the number counts at the faintest magnitudes ( @xmath45 ) .",
    "distances to the stars in the final red - dwarf sample are estimated using photometric parallax .",
    "the stellar number densities are estimated taking into account the distance to which a star can be detected .    after the pioneering work by rg , other deep surveys with the method of photometric parallax explored the distribution of faint stars in different directions , gilmore , reid & hewett ( 1985 ) , hawkins & bessell ( 1988 ) , leggett & hawkins ( 1988 ) , stobie , ishida & peacock ( 1989 , hereinafter sip ) and kirkpatrick et al .",
    "these yield _ photometric _ lfs , @xmath46 , that are consistent with each other and , after correction for galactic disc structure , are independent of the direction of the line - of - sight through the galactic disc .",
    "a consistent finding among these surveys , each yielding about 3060  stars with @xmath39 , is that @xmath46 has a maximum at @xmath47 with a decline at fainter magnitudes . that it also does not show significant variation with direction has been verified by the extensive photographic survey of tinney , reid & mould ( 1993 ) .",
    "the resulting lf is based on about 3500  stars spread over an area of 270  square degrees . surveys with the hubble space telescope ( hst ) avoid contamination by galaxies down to @xmath48 , and can thus probe the stellar distribution to distances of a few kpc .",
    "santiago , gilmore & elson ( 1996 ) report @xmath49 based on about 20  fields and verify that @xmath46 decreases for @xmath39 .",
    "they discuss the uncertainties in @xmath49 owing to photometric calibration .",
    "finally , jarrett , dickman & herbst ( 1994 ) constrain the faint star lf by counting 14  red stars with @xmath39 that appear projected against dark molecular clouds .",
    "significant conclusions from a comparison with @xmath40 or @xmath46 are not possible but the sample is also interesting because it may contain young m  dwarfs that have migrated from the molecular cloud .",
    "in a colour  magnitude diagram there is scatter about the average relation , because the luminosity of a main - sequence star is a function of mass , metallicity , age and spin ( section  1 ) .",
    "consequently , the distance estimated from the colour and apparent magnitude of a star is subject to error . in a magnitude",
    "limited survey , such as is used to construct @xmath46 , this leads to overestimation of the stellar number densities because the number of stars increases with distance .",
    "more intrinsically brighter stars are counted in the photometrically defined sampling volume than intrinsically fainter stars are lost from it .",
    "this bias also leads to the resulting stellar sample appearing brighter than is typical for stars of the given colour .",
    "sip applied for the first time the complete malmquist corrections to the raw photometric lf .",
    "the malmquist correction , @xmath50 , where @xmath51 is the scatter about the mean absolute magnitude @xmath13 in the colour  magnitude diagram , and is assumed to be constant and gaussian .",
    "the cosmic scatter , @xmath51 , depends on the photometric bands used for photometric parallax .",
    "using @xmath52 , rather than the shallower @xmath53 relation , leads to significantly larger malmquist bias ( reid 1991 ; fig .  2 in kroupa 1995a ) .",
    "the detailed study of cosmic scatter in section  3 of ktg93 shows that @xmath54 is non - gaussian and a function of @xmath55 , because the effects of metallicity , unresolved binaries and age lead to different , colour dependent changes in @xmath18 .",
    "recent progress in the modelling of realistic stellar atmospheres ( fig .  1 in baraffe et al .",
    "1995 ) qualitatively supports the metallicity model of ktg93 ( their figs .  5 and  6 ) .",
    "malmquist corrections are thus even more involved than the treatment by sip .",
    "the @xmath19 relation steepens near @xmath56 and flattens again near @xmath57 , because the formation of h@xmath58 in the outer shells of main - sequence stars causes core contraction .",
    "this leads to brighter luminosities and full convection for @xmath59 ( chabrier & baraffe 1997 ; kroupa & tout 1997 , hereinafter kt ) , and to a pronounced local minimum in @xmath22 at @xmath60 .",
    "artificial suppression of h@xmath58 formation leads to full convection at @xmath61 and to fainter stars ( ktg90 , kt ) . in this case",
    "@xmath22 has no significant extrema for @xmath62 .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "the discussion in section  1 implies that a minimum in @xmath22 should correspond to a maximum in the lf , unless the mf has a minimum that cancels out the structure in @xmath22 .",
    "all photometric lfs show a maximum near @xmath63 ( section  2 ) .",
    "the well constrained average photometric lf , @xmath64 ( section  6 ) , shows this maximum to be in beautiful agreement with the theoretical @xmath65 relation , opening the possibility of testing stellar structure theory near the critical @xmath66 where stars become fully convective .",
    "for example , the modern stellar models of kt , that rely on the eddington approximation for the surface boundary condition , place the minimum in @xmath22 at too bright an @xmath18 ( long - dashed curve in fig .  2 ) .",
    "treatment of a realistic stellar atmosphere together with the most recent stellar structure physics by baraffe et al .",
    "( 1995 ) , leads to improved agreement of the extremum in @xmath22 with @xmath64 ( kt ) .",
    "agreement , however , does not necessarily imply correct physics , as the out - dated models of ktg90 ( short - dashed curve in fig .  2 ) demonstrates .",
    "theoreticians must , in addition , seek agreement with luminosity(effective - temperature ) , colour  magnitude and mass(absolute - magnitude ) relations ( kt ) .",
    "duquennoy & mayor ( 1991 , hereinafter dm91 ) constrain the period distribution and the binary proportion for g - type field stars .",
    "the former can be approximated by a gaussian distribution in log@xmath67 with mean near 34  au , where @xmath68 is the semi - major axis .",
    "the proportion of binary systems among g - dwarfs is @xmath69 .",
    "virtually the same conclusions hold true for k-  ( mayor et al .",
    "1992 ) and m - dwarfs ( fischer & marcy 1992 ) ( see also halbwachs , these proceedings , and the summary in kroupa 1995c ) .",
    "fisher & marcy find that about 7  per cent of all m - dwarfs are triple systems , and that about 1  per cent are quadruple systems .",
    "the proportions are likely to be higher because the sample of m - dwarf systems within 20  pc is far from complete .",
    "the companion star fraction for m - dwarfs is thus @xmath70 ( compare with @xmath71 ) . similarly , @xmath72 and @xmath73 is higher than @xmath74 and @xmath75 , respectively .",
    "the mass - ratio distribution for g - dwarf binary systems is biased towards low - mass companions ( fig .",
    "10 in dm91 ) .",
    "the data are still rather poor for lower - mass primaries but exclude a preponderance of companions with nearly equal mass ( mayor et al .",
    "1992 , fischer & marcy 1992 ) .",
    "how mass - ratio distributions can be miss - interpreted if unknown selection effects operate is shown by tout ( 1991 ) .    that deep star - count data are affected significantly",
    "if companion stars are not counted has been stressed by buser & kaeser ( 1985 ) , who construct the system lf from the nearby lf ( their fig .  2 ) and apply it to galactic structure studies .",
    "piskunov & malkov ( 1991 ) compute the single - star lf given an observed system lf and assumed different mass - ratio distributions , as well as a power - law @xmath76 relation . in their fig .",
    "1 , they show how the system lf significantly underestimates the stellar number densities",
    ". however , the above studies do not include malmquist bias nor the method of photometric distance estimation .    in deep surveys",
    "the typical resolution is 2  arc sec ( rg ) , which implies that multiple stellar systems with dimensions less than @xmath77au will not be resolved at a distance of @xmath78pc .",
    "furthermore , most faint companions will not be seen even if the system is formally resolved because the photometric distance limit decreases with decreasing brightness of the star , and because glare around a bright star can hide faint companions .",
    "the great majority of faint companion stars will be missed .    counting a multiple star system as a single star has the following effects :",
    "if the companion(s ) are bright enough to affect the system luminosity noticeably , then the estimated photometric distance will be too small ; the remaining companions are lost from the star - count analysis .",
    "the former effect enhances the apparent stellar number density at brighter magnitudes .",
    "this is countered by the larger effective photometric distance limit together with the approximately exponential stellar density fall - off perpendicular to the galactic plane .",
    "the second effect reduces the star - counts at faint magnitudes leading to a significant bias , because a g- , k- and bright m - dwarf has , on average , a faint m - dwarf companion .",
    "before proceeding to infer the mf from the lf , we must understand which information is contained in each of the lfs discussed in section  2 . clearly , @xmath40 is the most direct measurement of the mf , given @xmath79 . but @xmath40 is poorly constrained for @xmath39 by the small number of stars per magnitude bin , amounting in total to about  20 stars .",
    "the constraints available so far suggest that @xmath40 is approximately flat for @xmath39 .",
    "the deep surveys show that @xmath46 does not vary with direction , so that they can be combined to improve the constraints on @xmath46 .",
    "however , not all estimates of @xmath46 have been treated correctly for malmquist bias , which depends on the colour  magnitude relation used . to avoid this problem , kroupa ( 1995a ) combined four photometric lfs that base photometric distance estimation on the @xmath53 relation , but are not corrected for malmquist bias , and obtained @xmath80 .",
    "application of malmquist corrections then gives an estimate of the distribution of stars with luminosity in the deep surveys , @xmath64 .",
    "this lf implies that 5  stars should have been found in the sampling volume in which @xmath40 is defined .",
    "given that the one - dimensional velocity dispersion of the stars defining @xmath40 is about 30  km / sec ( ktg93 ; reid , hawley & gizis 1995 ) , it follows immediately that the chance of observing a local overdensity by a factor of  4 is negligibly small .",
    "it is therefore concluded with high confidence that @xmath64 and @xmath40 do not measure the same physical quantity .",
    "the same mixing argument explains why @xmath46 is independent of direction .",
    "it comes to mind ( dlh ) that unresolved binary systems are the most likely cause of the significant underdensity of faint stars in @xmath64 .",
    "this has been verified by ktg91 .",
    "subsequently , reid ( 1991 ) claimed that binary systems can not resolve the discrepancy .",
    "this , however , is a conclusion drawn upon the basis of assumptions that define models outside solution space ( kroupa 1995b ) .    in order to clarify some of the questions posed by ktg91 and reid ( 1991 )",
    ", ktg93 developed a detailed model of star - count data in which they took into account consistently all the effects discussed above that influence @xmath46 .",
    "one possible solution is shown in fig .  3 .    the upper panel shows the linear @xmath53 relation from sip ( solid line ) , which is taken to be a model for single stars with the same solar - neighbourhood metallicity and age . a realistic distribution of metallicity",
    ", age and binarity then leads to a sample of stars that spread around the underlying relation .",
    "the systematic colour - dependent off set from the underlying relation is evident .",
    "this necessitates a consistent correction of the @xmath53 relation fitted to the data .",
    "a complex multi - dimensional monte - carlo analysis shows that the sip star count data towards the north galactic pole can be fitted with the same mf that also fits @xmath40 .",
    "an exponential galactic disc , with @xmath32 a free parameter , is included explicitly , because unresolved metal - rich binary systems with nearly equal component masses at a true distance of 300400  pc , can enter a photometric distance limit of about 100  pc ( kroupa 1995b ) .",
    "the resulting mf is approximated by a two - part power - law below @xmath81 .",
    "the imf for all stellar masses is obtained by extension with a third power - law segment for more massive stars from the analysis of sc :    @xmath82    where @xmath83 for @xmath84 , @xmath85 for @xmath86 , and @xmath87 for @xmath88 ( fig .  22 and eqn .  13 in ktg93 ) .",
    "in this notation salpeter s power - law index is @xmath89 .",
    "there is some evidence that @xmath90 for the imf ( tsujimoto et al .",
    "1997 and references therein ) , and for main - sequence stars in the galactic field @xmath91 .",
    "the model _ observed _ single - star lf becomes the solid curve in the lower panel of fig .",
    "it is affected significantly by the spread of metallicities and trigonometric distance uncertainties , and compares very well with the real @xmath40 shown as the solid histogram ( from kroupa 1995a ) .",
    "the thin dotted histogram shows the effect of counting gl  866c and shifting the sampling distance from 5.2  pc to 5.23  pc .",
    "the dashed curve is the model photometric lf with malmquist bias not removed , assuming a companion star fraction @xmath92 and @xmath93  pc .",
    "the solid dots show @xmath94 ( binned into one - magnitude wide bins offset by half a magnitude ) , which is the relevant observational constraint , and the open circles are @xmath64 .    in the above model",
    ", stars are combined randomly from the imf to make the uncorrelated mass ratio distribution , @xmath95 , for binary systems .",
    "this procedure does not give an @xmath95 that is consistent with the observational constraints ( section  5 ) because too many low - mass companions are produced . that the mf derived with the above analysis remains a good solution if @xmath95 consistent with the observational constraints is used ,",

    "comparison of figs .",
    "3 and  4 shows that the model photometric lfs contain too many systems for @xmath101 . as discussed in kroupa ( 1995b ) , this is not to be taken too seriously because , among other effects , photometric calibration may be uncertain for the faint red dwarfs . j. gizis ( private communication ) points out that the hitherto neglected non - linearity of the @xmath53 relation ( section  4 in leggett , harris & dahn 1994 ; fig .  1 in baraffe et al .",
    "1995 ) increases @xmath46 at the faint magnitudes , which improves agreement with the models . the model shown in fig .",
