    "pulsar wind nebulae ( pwne ) confine magnetized pulsar winds via a termination shock , whereupon particles are re - accelerated to extremely high energies and emit radiation across the electromagnetic spectrum .",
    "many pwne are spatially resolved in the radio , x - ray , and even very high energy ( vhe ) wavebands , and thereby provide an excellent laboratory to study not only pulsar winds and dynamics , but also shock processes , the ambient medium , magnetic field evolution , and particle transport .",
    "an archetypal pwn system is hess j1825@xmath0137 associated with the energetic pulsar psrj1826@xmath01334 , which possesses an energy - dependent tev morphology thought to be caused by relic electrons from earlier epochs @xcite .",
    "this system is also a prime example of offset vhe pwne , with the h.e.s.s .",
    "flux centered @xmath11 south of the pulsar and vhe emission extending @xmath12 to the south .",
    "the tev emission softens from a photon index of @xmath13 near the pulsar to @xmath14 in the outer reaches of the nebula .",
    "psr j1826@xmath01334 was detected in the jodrell bank 20 cm radio survey @xcite , with period 101 ms , spin - down power @xmath15 , and characteristic age @xmath16 kyr .",
    "the dispersion measure distance of the pulsar is @xmath17kpc @xcite .",
    "x - ray observations of the pwn with _ xmm - newton _ showed a compact core with a hard photon index ( @xmath18 ) of size 30@xmath19 embedded in a larger diffuse structure of extension @xmath20 extending to the south of the pulsar with a softer photon index of @xmath21 @xcite . _",
    "chandra _ observations by @xcite revealed the compact core to be composed of a bright inner component @xmath22 surrounded by an outer component elongated in the east - west direction .",
    "more recent x - ray observations with _ suzaku _ revealed diffuse x - ray emission of @xmath23 extending @xmath24 south of the pulsar with little sign of spectral softening @xcite .",
    "hess j1825@xmath0137 has not been detected in the radio @xcite .    using archival vla observations of psr j1826@xmath01334 @xcite measured a proper motion of @xmath25 ( with distance @xmath26 kpc ) at a position angle @xmath27 east of north .",
    "this places the pulsar birthsite some @xmath28 to the west for an age of 20 kyr ( see figure 1 ) , and rules out pulsar proper motion as the cause of the large southerly extension of hess j1825@xmath0127 .",
    "@xcite advocated that the offset is instead likely the result of an asymmetric reverse shock returning from the north , as proposed by @xcite to explain the similar structure observed in vela - x .",
    "indeed , @xcite found a compelling spatial correlation between a molecular cloud discovered in @xmath29 studies and the vhe source .",
    "the distance to this cloud is measured as 4 kpc , and with a total mass of @xmath30 naturally provides the ism inhomogeneity to the north required for the reverse shock scenario .",
    "the fact that emission extends roughly perpendicular to the pulsar motion suggests that the reverse shock velocity must be significantly greater than the pulsar proper motion .",
    "the _ fermi _ large area telescope ( lat ) recently detected hess j1825@xmath0137 using 20  months of survey data @xcite .",
    "the gamma - ray emission detected by the lat boasts a similar size to the h.e.s.s .",
    "source , with extension @xmath31 for an assumed gaussian model .",
    "the @xmath32 gev lat spectrum of this source is well described by a power - law with a spectral index of @xmath33 .",
    "single - zone spectral energy distribution ( sed ) modeling of the x - ray and gamma - ray data showed that @xmath34 erg injected in the form of electrons evolved over @xmath35 kyr could reproduce the broadband aggregate spectrum , and that the hard lat spectrum was consistent with both a simple power - law electron injection spectrum , and with a relativistic maxwellian with a power - law tail @xcite .",
    "in this paper we describe sed modeling of the x - ray and gamma - ray data , with particular emphasis on the spatial variations in spectra . in section 2",
    "we overview the x - ray and vhe data , section 3 details the sed model , section 4 describes results of sed fitting , and section 5 discusses the conclusions that can be drawn from model fitting .",

    "the @xmath36 _ suzaku _ xis field of view is broad enough to encompass the bright core of hess j1825@xmath0137 , and @xcite reported emission nearly to the edge of all four xis chips .",

    "one - zone models can help constrain certain global nebula properties , such as the total energy injected in the form of electrons , the electron spectrum in the uncooled regime , and the mean magnetic field . yet",

    "we implement a spatially resolved model of hess j1825@xmath0137 .",
    "we begin by investigating how simple scaling relations inform model implementation .",
    "starting assumptions include : the source of all particles and magnetic field in the nebula is psr j1826@xmath01334 , ambient photon fields are static , and the nebula is 4 kpc distant . let us first consider the electrons present in the innermost zone ( zone 1 ) adjacent the pulsar . in a transverse magnetic field",
    "these particles synchrotron radiate photons at mean energy : @xmath132 we scale with a low field of @xmath133 since , as we shall see later , even in the innermost zone the mean field is only @xmath134 for the best fit model .",
    "such particles cool rapidly , with a lifetime ( @xmath135 ) of : @xmath136 therefore the cooling timescale for electrons radiating synchrotron photons at mean energy @xmath137 is : @xmath138 the flat ( @xmath139 ) x - ray spectrum extending to 10 kev of region 1 indicates that the electrons responsible for this emission are largely uncooled , implying @xmath140 .",
    "the inner region therefore must be dominated by particles recently injected by the pulsar . in the uncooled regime the synchrotron spectral flux scales with the magnetic field and number of electrons as : @xmath141 . over timescales short compared to the 21 kyr spin - down age of the pulsar",
    "the number of electrons @xmath142 in zone 1 is roughly proportional to the time period over which electrons have been injected @xmath143 , so @xmath144 , a relation we will return to momentarily .",
    "electrons inverse compton ( ic ) upscatter cmb photons to a mean energy of : @xmath145 for young electrons ic cooling is of little consequence , since 10 tev electrons scattering off the cmb cool in @xmath146 .",
    "we scale to 10 tev rather than 100 tev since at 100 tev the thomson regime is no longer realized and klein - nishina corrections must be incorporated . for example , while the above scaling relation for inverse compton cooling holds for electrons with @xmath147 tev , 100 tev electrons cool slowly over @xmath148 kyr , rather than the @xmath149 kyr predicted by this relation .",
    "we therefore consider only synchrotron cooling in the following discussion .",
    "the lowest energy h.e.s.s .",
    "point at @xmath150 tev requires electrons of energy @xmath151 tev , which synchrotron cool slowly at a rate of @xmath152 .",
    "therefore , electrons responsible for the low energy h.e.s.s",
    ". points cool quite slowly compared to those responsible for the x - ray flux .",
    "the electrons responsible for the lowest energy h.e.s.s . points ( and therefore all the _ fermi _ lat flux points as well ) are radiatively uncooled over time spans of a few thousand years , and provide a good indication of just how many electrons are present in the inner nebula .",
    "this is due to the fact that for @xmath147 tev the thomson limit holds and ic flux scales linearly with the number of electrons ( @xmath142 ) present : @xmath153 .",
    "the exact number of electrons at 10 tev will depend on the electron injection spectrum parameters as well as the injection time @xmath143 , and very weakly on the magnetic field due to feeble synchrotron cooling , so @xmath154 .",
    "the x - ray data breaks the degeneracy in magnetic field since @xmath144 , so between x - ray and gamma - ray data the electron injection spectrum , age , and magnetic field are very well constrained .",
    "for modeling the data , this means that once an injection spectrum is selected , the gamma - ray flux determines the injection time , while the ratio of x - ray to gamma - ray flux determines the magnetic field .",

    "the particle energy is presumed to go into an electron / positron plasma with an exponentially cutoff power - law spectrum : @xmath179 with @xmath180 the minimum particle energy .",
    "we initially select @xmath180 as 100 gev , which is well within the realm of minimum particle energies considered by @xcite in magnetohydrodynamical modeling of the crab nebula .",
    "the normalization of this power - law varies with time following equation 8 , though we treat the index , minimum energy , and cutoff energy as static .",
    "we begin by modeling pure power - law injection , although we later consider an injection spectrum composed of a relativistic maxwellian with a non - thermal tail , as proposed by @xcite .",
    "pulsar winds flow out at relativistic speeds until the ram pressure of the wind is balanced by the internal pressure of the pwn at the termination shock .",
    "high - resolution x - ray images can help illuminate the location of this termination shock , and chandra images of the pulsar reveal that the brightest inner pwn component stretches some @xmath181 ( @xmath182 at 4 kpc ) @xcite , with the short axis roughly oriented toward the pulsar birthsite .",
    "the overall extent of the equatorial flow is generally @xmath183 times larger than the termination shock radius @xcite , and we accordingly adopt a value of @xmath184 pc for the radius of the termination shock .",
    "past the termination shock the pulsar wind expands radially at a much reduced velocity . in the model of of @xcite",
    "the rapid rotation of the pulsar wraps up magnetic field lines , resulting in a primarily toroidal field at and beyond the termination shock .",
    "the field direction is therefore approximately perpendicular to the wind flow velocity .",
    "since particles effectively can not cross toroidal magnetic field lines , the bulk flow of particles predicts an ordered layering of particle ages with increasing distance from the pulsar , of age : @xmath185 with @xmath186 the velocity profile . on larger scales ,",
    "we consider the evolution of the parent supernova remnant ( snr ) of psr j1826@xmath01334 .",
    "early in the pulsar lifetime the snr expands freely into the ambient medium , typically at a velocity of @xmath187 . the large @xmath7 pc size of the vhe pwn and lack of any observed snr shell led @xcite to propose a very large snr of radius @xmath188 pc resulting from an energetic supernova explosion ( @xmath189 erg ) of age @xmath190 kyr , and a very low ambient medium density of @xmath191 . early on , a spherically symmetric pwn expands rapidly into unshocked supernova ejecta with nearly constant velocity @xcite : @xmath192 as the snr expands and sweeps up more mass , it eventually reaches a point where the swept up ism material is approximately equal in mass to the mass of the supernova ejecta .",
    "at this point the snr enters the sedov - taylor phase as the swept - up material begins to dominate the snr dynamics . adopting a uniform density ism , for the standard core - collapse supernovae assumption of a constant density inner core surrounded by a @xmath193 outer envelope the transition to",
    "the sedov - taylor phase occurs at : @xmath194 in this phase a reverse shock is driven deep into the snr interior , and for a snr expanding into a homogenous medium the reverse shock will impact the pwn , crushing it and leading to a series of reverberations which can last many thousands of years , as demonstrated compellingly in @xcite .",
    "calculations by @xcite yielded an upper limit on the reverse shock collision with the pwn at @xmath195 .",
    "a supernova explosion into an evacuated cavity of @xmath196 therefore yields a maximum pwn - reverse shock collision time of @xmath197 kyr ( nearly double the characteristic age of the pulsar ) , implying that the pwn could to this day be rapidly expanding to the southwest into unshocked snr ejecta .",

    "a more palatable alternative is that the southerly offset from the pulsar is due to crushing by the reverse shock . in this picture",
    "the reverse shock quickly reflects off of the molecular cloud to the north , and then impacts the pwn in a few thousand years .",

    "the termination shock radius accordingly scales roughly as @xmath240 , and for a braking index near @xmath241 ( where @xmath242 ) the termination shock remains approximately static .",
    "furthermore , since our sed model focuses on emission from the entire nebula ( which dwarfs @xmath243 ) , the precise value of @xmath243 has little effect on the resultant sed . for simplicity , we therefore assume a constant value of @xmath184 pc .    adopting a dipolar followed by toroidal magnetic field geometry out to the termination shock , @xmath244 .",

    "a similar deviation is observed for g@xmath263 @xcite , implying that the magnetic field structure deviates from a purely toroidal structure .",

    "the ` missing ' @xmath50% of flux implies a missing population of particles contributing to the ic flux of the nebula .",

    "while the magnetic field evolution and profile adopted in our model does not take into account the total energy budget of the pulsar , a reasonable model should nevertheless contain @xmath434 erg of magnetic energy for the choice of @xmath435 . computing the magnetic field energy from the final magnetic field profile @xmath436 yields an energy of @xmath437 erg , which is quite reasonable given that the magnetic field likely experiences some losses due to expansion . even though the vast majority of the pulsar energy initially goes into particles , summing the energy content of the final electron spectrum reveals that electron cooling losses leave only @xmath438 erg remaining in the form of leptons .",
    "we can also compute the value of @xmath177 from the assumed termination shock radius of @xmath439 pc and @xmath250 field strength . adopting a flow speed at the termination shock of @xmath440 and a spherical geometry",

    "the energy lost due to adiabatic cooling goes into accelerating a shell of swept - up material , and we can use estimates of this swept - up mass as another check of the validity of the sed model .",
    "for the adopted snr density profile of a constant density inner core surrounded by a @xmath193 outer envelope the transition between the two density regimes propagates out at a constant velocity @xmath446 , such that @xcite : @xmath447 this is much faster than the model 4 outer pwn expansion of @xmath310 , so we can treat the pwn as always expanding into the constant density ejecta core , with density @xcite : @xmath448 the amount of mass swept up by the pwn over its lifetime can be approximated as : @xmath449 with @xmath450 the initial timestep , @xmath451 and @xmath452 the filling factor of the pwn , equal to 0.31 for the adopted morphology . integrating equation 25 over the 40 kyr lifetime of the pulsar provides a very rough estimate of @xmath453 of swept up mass .",
    "accelerating @xmath454 to @xmath310 ( the mean expansion velocity for a pulsar age of @xmath455 kyr ) requires some @xmath456 erg . for the parameters selected in model 4",
    ", the sed model posits a total adiabatic loss of @xmath457 erg , quite close to the value quoted above . recall that in the sed model adiabatic losses depend only on the assumed pwn size evolution ( equation 17 ) , and do not take into account any snr properties . therefore the fact that the two adiabatic loss estimates are not glaringly different provides some support to the soundness of the sed model .",
    "the computed pressure within the entire nebula can be used as a further sanity check on our model by comparing to the expected pwn pressure after 40 kyr .",
    "given the degree of particle cooling , the model s final particle pressure ( @xmath458 ) is less than the magnetic pressure ( @xmath459 ) . within a freely expanding snr",
    "the pwn pressure scales as @xcite : @xmath460 with @xmath461 given by equation 24 , and @xmath462 the pwn expansion velocity .",
    "after 40 kyr this predicts a mean nebular pressure of @xmath463 , in good agreement with the computed values .",
    "the adopted termination shock radius of 0.03 pc predicts a pressure of @xmath464 at the termination shock ( equation 19 ) , significantly higher than the mean pressure of @xmath465 .",
    "this high pressure at the shock rapidly dissipates away from the pulsar , however , with the bulk of the nebula nearly isobaric at late times ; each of the 10 outer zones has a pressure within @xmath466% of the mean nebular pressure , as evidenced in the pressure and energy plot of figure  [ fig : p_en ] .",
    "this plot illustrates that the magnetic pressure exceeds particle pressure for the inner regions , and that the total particle energy exceeds the bulk magnetic field energy in the nebula .",
    "the total magnetic field pressure scales as @xmath467 , while the total particle pressure evolves as @xmath468 .",
    "this is precisely the @xmath238 evolution predicted by equations 24 and 26 for a freely expanding pwn .",
    "in addition to the pwn pressure and energy we can also compute a variety of quantities which vary over the pulsar lifetime . we calculate the mean magnetic field evolution as @xmath469 , which is quite similar to the @xmath470 evolution computed by @xcite in their single - zone model during the free expansion phase .",
    "the various luminosities in the nebula are plotted in figure  [ fig : lum ] , revealing that at late times the total luminosity of the nebula exceeds the pulsar spin - down power .",
    "this figure also demonstrates that after a few thousand years adiabatic losses overtake synchrotron radiation to provide the dominant cooling mechanism , though particles of energy @xmath471 tev primarily lose energy from synchrotron and ic cooling since for both the cooling timescale @xmath472 .",
    "indeed , at late time the ic cooling actually exceeds the synchrotron cooling due to the low mean magnetic field of @xmath473 .",
    "we construct radial flux profiles by summing the model fluxes in the _ suzaku _ and h.e.s.s .",
    "wavebands within each region , which can be compared with the data points plotted in figure  2 .",
    "we are also free to compute the profile in any arbitrary energy range , and",
    "so in figure  [ fig : mod_radial ] we plot the projected surface brightness in the _ fermi _ lat 1 - 100 gev range . since the lat energy range lies in the uncooled regime , the flux primarily tracks the energy content of electrons . as a result",
    ", the lat flux peaks toward the outer realm of the nebula where the majority of electrons were injected when the pulsar was much younger with a far higher @xmath171 , and this gives that a rather uniform counts map in the lat energy band .",
    "comparison of point source and extended gaussian morphologies in the @xmath474 gev range by @xcite yielded a significance of @xmath475 for a source extension of @xmath31 centered @xmath9 southwest of the pulsar .",
    "similar results are achieved with a uniform disk morphology , though the extension increases to @xmath476 .",
    "fitting the source to a spatial template provided by the h.e.s.s .",
    "excess map ( @xmath477 gev ) decreases the test statistic by @xmath478 , implying that the lat emission shows a distinctly different morphology from the h.e.s.s .",
    "indeed , the lat source extension of @xmath479 centered @xmath9 southwest of the pulsar is remarkably consistent with figure  [ fig : mod_radial ] .",
    "analysis of recently public _ suzaku _",

    "is naturally explained by electron cooling losses .",
    "time - dependent 3-d modeling of the twelve data regions allows one to constrain the electron injection properties , spin - down behavior of the pulsar , nebular velocity profile , and magnetic field profile .",
    "a choice of @xmath481% of the pulsar spin - down going into electrons is consistent with the data , though due to particle cooling at the current epoch magnetic field energy is @xmath482 the particle energy in the nebula .",
    "this cooling also results in a higher magnetic than particle pressure , with a nearly isobaric particle pressure profile in the outer ten zones and the total pressure falling as @xmath238 . for the best fit model ( model 4 ) an initial spin period of @xmath483 ms",
    "provides adequate pulsar spin - down energy to power the nebula , and combined with the braking index of @xmath484 this predicts an age of @xmath455 kyr and an expansion velocity of @xmath310 .",

    "the _ fermi _ lat photon index of @xmath65 connotes an electron index near the canonical 2.0 . however , fitting to the x - ray / tev and the higher energy portion of the electron spectrum , we find a somewhat softer power law index of @xmath487 .",
