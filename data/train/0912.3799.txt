    "searching for neutral vector resonances is one important task in the large hadron collider ( lhc ) programme , being the drell - yan process @xmath13 the preferred one in these studies @xcite . this signal with charged leptons in the final state",
    "has smaller backgrounds than those with only hadrons , but it requires that the new boson couples to both quarks and leptons , being this process suppressed when either of these types of couplings vanishes .",
    "the @xmath3 channel is an alternative if the couplings to leptons are the ones which are negligible . among the hadronic final states ,",
    "@xmath14 is very interesting by itself because , being the top very heavy , it allows for a relatively easy identification and reconstruction , and for this reason its backgrounds are relatively smaller .",
    "even more , @xmath4 is not only an alternative to the drell - yan process when the new resonance is leptophobic , but it is always complementary to determine the model because it involves a different combination of couplings , and it also allows for asymmetry measurements in the semileptonic decay @xcite .",
    "new gauge bosons are predicted in many of the best motivated standard model ( sm ) extensions .",
    "for instance , parity restoration , which can be at the tev scale , requires extending the sm gauge symmetry to @xmath15 , with new neutral and charged gauge bosons at this scale @xcite .",
    "grand unified models always predict new gauge bosons , and some of them may survive at lower energies @xcite . in general , models addressing the hierarchy problem which are not based on supersymmetry , such as little higgs models @xcite or models with large extra dimensions @xcite , also introduce ( a plethora of ) new vector bosons , with some of them at the lhc reach .",
    "many of them couple to quarks and leptons but , as already stressed , even in this case ( and obviously in the leptophobic limit ) it is important to perform a detailed resonance search in the @xmath14 channel .    with this purpose in mind ,",
    "we have extended  @xcite with a generator for @xmath0 production , including real emissions matched with leading logarithmic ( ll ) corrections ( both real and virtual ones ) .",
    "this is presented in the next section , and applied to the search of vector resonances decaying into @xmath14 in the following ones .",
    "for the sake of illustration , we concentrate on the case of a leptophobic @xmath16 , which also decays into new heavy neutrinos @xmath17 if @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "the model is described in section  [ model ] , where we also give details of the simulation of top pair production mediated by neutral gauge bosons .",
    "then , in section  [ analysis ] we show the relevance of using a generator including these contributions : a combined analysis of @xmath19 and @xmath20 improves the lhc sensitivity to neutral vector resonances , raising the statistical significance of the signal by 25% compared with an inclusive analysis .",
    "precise simulations of @xmath0 production in different channels are not only essential for discovery , but to determinine the model by measuring all the @xmath0 couplings with a precision as high as possible .",
    "the last section is devoted to our conclusions .",
    "in this section we briefly describe the main features of the new code .",
    "it evaluates the matrix elements for @xmath21  jets production , with @xmath0 decaying into several final states including @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "actually `` @xmath21  jets",
    "'' stands for the sum of the three possible intermediate vector bosons , namely @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath0 ; their interferences as well as their widths and all spin correlations are taken into account .",
    "decay products , as for example in @xmath24 , but for simplicity we still denote these processes as @xmath25  jets .",
    "obviously , by @xmath5 we only refer to events in which the extra jet is radiated off the @xmath0 decay products .",
    "the radiation from top decay products is not included at the matrix element level .",
    "] detailed information can be found in the readme file available at http://mlm.home.cern.ch / mlm / alpgen/. the sm parameters are controlled , as it happens for all the other processes implemented in  @xcite , by the variable iewopt , whose default value is iewopt = 3 .",
    "the possible final state is selected with the parameter ifs ( e.g. ifs = 0 @xmath26 @xmath27 , ifs = 2 @xmath26 @xmath3 ) , and its left - handed ( lh ) and right - handed ( rh ) couplings to @xmath0 with glzpe , grzpe and glzptop , grzptop respectively .",
    "in addition , the new gauge boson ( lh and rh ) couplings to the initial quarks , and its mass and width can be arbitrarily defined through the variables glzpup , grzpup , glzpdown , grzpdown , glzpc , grzpc , glzps , grzps , and masszp and zpwid , respectively , the lagrangian being @xmath28 and zpwid the width of the @xmath0 boson .",
    "finally , the mlm matching prescription  @xcite can be applied by taking the parameter ickkw = 1 . in table",
    "[ tab : zpjets_processes ] we gather the parton subprocesses evaluated for any given jet multiplicity .",
    ".3 cm     @xmath29 & @xmath30 & @xmath31 & @xmath32 + @xmath33 & @xmath34 & @xmath35 & @xmath36 +    since our aim is studying qcd corrections to the production of a single @xmath37-channel @xmath0 boson , rather than the production of two @xmath0 bosons , we neglect contributions with two light quark pairs , because in our approach the former excludes the latter .",
    "in order to illustrate the capabilities of this code we will evaluate top pair production for the leptophobic model described in the next section .",
    "the full analysis is presented in section [ analysis ] . as it can readily be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : minv ] , taking @xmath38 tev with a total width @xmath39 gev ,    [ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]     the @xmath3 distribution for the signal plus background and background alone is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : mtt - an0 ] .",
    "the number of events at the peak @xmath40 is also given in table  [ tab : nsnb - an0 ] .",
    "as expected , in this case the background scaling factor is larger than for the other analyses , @xmath41 , and the peak significance is of @xmath8 .",
    "this number is 25% smaller than the combined significances of the other two analyses , @xmath7 .",
    "we provide a new code implemented in alpgen for neutral vector resonance production , including the higher order corrections from real emission and the virtual ll contributions . in order to illustrate its features",
    "we have generated @xmath3 and @xmath42 events by the exchange of a leptophobic gauge boson based on @xmath43 at lhc .",
    "the analysis of the @xmath19 and @xmath44 samples show that such a program is necessary to account for @xmath45% of the @xmath46 events .",
    "indeed , for these events the resonance is not found in the @xmath3 invariant mass distribution but on the @xmath47 invariant mass .",
    "therefore , their presence can not be accounted for by a @xmath6 factor multiplying the lo @xmath48 cross section but has to be properly simulated at the generator level .",
    "we have shown that the lhc discovery potential for neutral vector resonances in the @xmath49 final state benefits from a separate analysis for @xmath3 and @xmath42 .",
    "for the case examined ( with a @xmath50 mass of 1 tev ) , the enhancement over an inclusive search for @xmath3 resonances is of a 25% in the statistical significance .",
    "this improvement is expected to be maintained for larger masses , and of course for other @xmath0 models than the leptophobic @xmath50 one used in the simulations . for",
    "other @xmath3 resonances the trend is expected to be the same as well .",
    "finally , the inclusion of corrections to @xmath4 not only translates into a better discovery potential but also into a proper description of the kinematical distributions .",
    "a code implementing them is necessary to establish the model once a new vector resonance is discovered , discriminating among models by a more precise measurement of the angular distributions  @xcite and the different @xmath0 couplings  @xcite .",
