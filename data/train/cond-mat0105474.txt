    "there has been increasing interest in the study of systems of interacting agents .",
    "such systems are useful for the study of global behavior in many situations of practical importance@xcite . in the newly established area of econophysics@xcite , for example ,",
    "multi - agent models have been intensively studied@xcite .",
    "agents in a population ( e.g. a market ) often do not act independently .",
    "the collective behavior of clusters of agents , also referred to as crowds , in which there is efficient information and opinion sharing among the agents , is an important factor in both real and simulated markets@xcite .",
    "these crowds are dynamic in nature in that there is a continual process of crowd formation and dissociation within a competing population .",
    "a simple model for stochastic opinion cluster formation and information dispersal , has recently been proposed and studied by eguluz and zimmermann@xcite .",
    "it is a dynamical model ( henceforth referred to as the ez model ) in which there is a continual grouping and re - grouping of agents to form clusters .",
    "a cluster or crowd of agents act together ( either buying or selling ) and then dissolve after the transaction has occured .",
    "when a cluster of agents decides not to trade , i.e. an inactive state , it may combine with another cluster of agents to form a bigger cluster .",
    "detailed numerical studies@xcite and mean field analysis@xcite revealed several interesting features of the model .",
    "for example , it was observed that this simple model of herd behavior could lead to a fat - tail distribution of price returns similar to that observed in real markets .",
    "in addition , the cluster size distribution @xmath0 shows a scaling behavior of the form @xmath1 for a range of cluster size @xmath2 , followed by an exponential cutoff@xcite .",
    "the ez model represents a generalization of the static percolation - type model of cont and bouchard@xcite in which herd formation is described by random connection between agents , and the cluster size distribution is found to follow the same scaling behavior .",
    "several variations on the model have been proposed and studied .",
    "these variations include the spreading of opinion to multiple clusters @xcite and inhomogeneous dissociation of clusters@xcite .",
    "interestingly , it was found that the values of the exponent characterizing the cluster size distribution seem to be robust against these variations , i.e. these values remain unchanged for the different variations proposed so far .",
    "we note that similar scaling behavior has been found in the size distribution of businesses@xcite , although the value of the exponent is different .    here",
    "we introduce a generalized version of the ez model in which a cluster of agents of size @xmath3 will dissolve with a probability @xmath4 if a transaction is made , and will combine with a cluster of size @xmath5 with a probability @xmath6 if a transaction is not made .",
    "the exponent becomes _ non - universal _ and tunable with values depending on the parameter @xmath7 .",
    "an analytic mean - field theory is presented which provides a quantitative explanation of the numerical results .",
    "the ez model is recovered as a limiting case of our model with @xmath8 .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows .",
    "we define our generalized model in sec .",
    "ii and present the numerical results on the cluster size distribution .",
    "section iii provides a mean field analysis and identifies the scaling exponent .",
    "the analytic results are compared with numerical simulations .",
    "the resulting distribution of price - returns is presented in sec.iv together with a discussion on possible extensions of our model .",
    "we consider a model with a total of @xmath9 agents .",
    "following ref.@xcite , a cluster or crowd is a group of agents who can exchange information efficiently and thus have a common opinion .",
    "these agents make the same decision at a given moment in time .",
    "initially , all the agents are isolated , i.e. each agent belongs to a cluster of size unity .",
    "as time evolves , an agent belongs to a cluster of a certain size . at each timestep an agent ,",
    "say the @xmath10-th one , is chosen at random .",
    "let @xmath3 be the size of the cluster to which the chosen agent belongs .",
    "since the agents within a cluster have a common opinion , all agents in such a cluster tend to imitate each other and hence act together .",
    "with probability @xmath11 the agent , and hence the whole cluster , decides to make a transaction , e.g. to buy or to sell with equal probability .",
    "after the transaction , the cluster is then broken up into isolated agents with a probability @xmath4 , with @xmath12 .",
    "with probability @xmath13 the agents decide not to make a transaction , i.e. they wait and try to gather more information .",
    "the other agents in the cluster follow . in this case , another agent @xmath14 is chosen at random .",
    "the two clusters of sizes @xmath3 and @xmath5 then either combine to form a bigger cluster with probability @xmath15 , or the two clusters remain separate with probability @xmath16 . here",
    "@xmath11 can be treated as a parameter reflecting the investment rate showing how frequent a transaction is made .",
    "our model thus represents a generalization of the basic ez model to the case in which a cluster of agents may stay together to form a group _ after _ making a transaction .",
    "the probability of dissociation @xmath4 implies that larger clusters have a larger tendency to remain grouped while smaller clusters are easier to break up@xcite .",
    "for the special case of @xmath8 , our model reduces to the ez model .    in the ez model ( @xmath8 ) ,",
    "clusters of agents break up after a transaction . here",
    ", our model includes a dissociation probability depending on the cluster size - this feature may be invoked to mimic practical aspects of a financial market , such as the effect of news arrival .",
    "imagine one of the agents in a cluster of size @xmath3 receives some external news with probability @xmath11 at a given timestep .",
    "this external news suggests that he , and hence the other members of his cluster , should immediately trade ( buy or sell ) . since the news is external , the crowd act together in this one moment , leaving the cluster with a finite probability of subsequently dissociating .",
    "suppose that they sense , e.g. from the resulting price - movement , that they are a member of a large crowd of like - minded agents : in practice many traders like to feel part of a larger crowd for reassurance .",
    "we therefore assume that the crowd breaks up with a size - dependent probability @xmath17 , where @xmath18 for @xmath19 and @xmath17 decreases monotonically as @xmath3 increases .",
    "by contrast , with probability ( @xmath20 ) there is no news arrival from outside .",
    "the agent in the chosen cluster , uncertain about whether to buy or sell , makes contact with an agent in another cluster of size @xmath5 .",
    "the agents share information and come up with a new opinion .",
    "each of them then separately tries to persuade the other members of his cluster of the new opinion . with probability @xmath17 ( @xmath21 )",
    "the opinion of cluster @xmath10 ( @xmath14 ) changes to the new opinion .",
    "thus , the two clusters combine with probability @xmath22 .",
    "it turns out that this particular form of the two combined modifications to the ez model , can be treated using our mean field analysis . as a specific example",
    ", our numerical simulations are carried out for the case in which @xmath23 .",
    "let @xmath0 be the number of clusters of size @xmath2 .",
    "figure 1 shows the results of numerical simulations on the cluster size distribution in the steady state , for various values of the parameter @xmath7 .",
    "the results are obtained for a system with @xmath24 and @xmath25 @xcite .",
    "averages are taken over a time window of @xmath26 time steps after the transient behavior has disappeared , together with a configuration average over 100 different runs with different initial conditions .",
    "the @xmath8 results give the features in the ez model . for a range of @xmath2 ,",
    "@xmath27 with @xmath28 @xcite .",
    "deviation from the scaling behavior sets in at a value of @xmath2 depending on the value of the parameter @xmath11 .",
    "these features are consistent with previous numerical@xcite and analytical studies@xcite . for @xmath12",
    ", it is observed that the size distribution @xmath0 still scales with @xmath2 in a range of @xmath2 as in the ez model .",
    "however , the exponent becomes model dependent and hence _ non - universal_. the data shows that the exponent @xmath7 is consistent with the behavior @xmath29 , where @xmath30 .",
    "a mean field analysis can be used to extract this scaling behavior , as will be described in the next section .",
    "it is interesting to note that several attempts have been made to modify the ez model .",
    "these extensions include , for example , the study by dhulst and rodgers on democrazy versus dictatorship by incorporating an inhomogeneous investment rate in the population@xcite and also allowing rumor to spread to multiple clusters in one time step after a chosen cluster decides not to make a transaction@xcite .",
    "all the extensions proposed so far give @xmath28 , hence the value seems to be robust .",
    "the present model incorporates a size - dependent dissociation probability of a cluster after a transaction and leads to a tunable and model - dependent @xmath31 .",
    "thus our model actually gives a set of models with different values of @xmath32 , similar to the case of changing a system from one universality class to another in problems in critical phenomena .",
    "in fact , the situation is reminiscent of the non - universal exponent of conductivity in continuum percolation@xcite . in percolation problems@xcite",
    ", it is known that the effective conductivity for a system consisting of insulators and conductors exhibits the scaling behavior @xmath33 near the percolation threshold @xmath34 .",
    "the exponent @xmath35 is universal in that its value depends only on the dimension of the system , regardless of other details , e.g. lattice type .",
    "if the conductances @xmath36 of the conductors follow a distribution of the form @xmath37 with @xmath38 , the @xmath35-exponent@xcite and other related properties@xcite become non - universal with exponents taking on a value depending on @xmath7 .",
    "it should be noted that it is not so surprising to see a connection between percolation and model for herd behavior . in the model of cont and bouchard@xcite , the ez model@xcite and their variations@xcite",
    ", an agent could be connected to any one of @xmath39 other agents to form a cluster .",
    "these models hence represent a problem of connectivity in high dimensions .",
    "several other percolation type models@xcite have also been proposed to explain the phenomena observed in real markets .",
    "the cluster size distribution in the ez model can be studied via a mean field analysis@xcite .",
    "the treatment can be extended to the present model to extract the scaling behavior of @xmath0 , though the algebra is more complicated .",
    "let @xmath40 be the number of clusters of size @xmath2 at time @xmath35 . at a certain time , @xmath40 changes as a result of the collective action of the members of the cluster containing the chosen agent .",
    "a master equation can thus be written down : @xmath41 for @xmath42 .",
    "each of the terms on the right hand side of eq.(1 ) represents the consequence of a possible action of the agent .",
    "the first term describes the dissociation of a cluster of size @xmath2 after a transaction is made .",
    "the second term represents coagulation of two clusters to form a cluster of size @xmath2 .",
    "the third term represents the combination of a cluster of size @xmath2 with another cluster . for clusters of size unity ( @xmath43 )",
    ", we have @xmath44 here , the first term comes from the dissociation of any clusters into isolated agents and the second term describes the combination of a cluster of size unity with another cluster . in the steady state ,",
    "@xmath45 , we have @xmath46 for @xmath47 , and @xmath48 for @xmath49 , where @xmath50 and @xmath51    the aim here is to extract the scaling behavior . invoking a generating function approach@xcite , we let @xmath52 where @xmath53 .",
    "it follows from eq.(3 ) that the function @xmath54 satisfies the equation @xmath55 note that @xmath56 can be expressed in terms of @xmath57 and @xmath58 , and @xmath59 the number of clusters of size @xmath2 can be found formally by @xmath60 where @xmath61 . the resulting expression for @xmath0 is @xmath62^{s } } { ( s!)^{2 } s^{-\\delta } [ na + 2(1-a)\\sum_{r=1}^{\\infty } r^{1-\\delta}n_{r } ] ^{2s-1}}. \\\\ ] ] invoking sterling s formula yields @xmath63 } { [ \\frac{na}{\\sum_{r=1}^{\\infty } r^{1-\\delta}n_{r } } + 2(1-a)]^{2 } } \\right]^{s }   s^{-(\\frac{5}{2 } - \\delta)}.\\ ] ] for @xmath8 , the sum @xmath64 and the previous results of refs.@xcite are recovered . for @xmath65 , it is difficult to solve for @xmath0 . since the summations in eqs.(11 ) and",
    "( 12 ) give a number , our result shows that @xmath29 with @xmath30 for the present model .",
    "this @xmath7-dependent exponent is also indicated in fig . 1 ( lines are a guide to the eye ) .",
    "we note that the scaling behavior is masked by the behavior of the term in the squared brackets in eq.(12 ) for large values of @xmath2 , similar to the situation for the ez model@xcite .",
    "eguluz and zimmermann@xcite applied their model to study the distribution of price returns .",
    "a price can be generated according to @xmath66 where @xmath67 is a parameter for the liquidity of the market .",
    "the price return @xmath68 is defined to be the relative number of agents buying or selling at a time with @xmath69 for a cluster of agents deciding to buy , and @xmath70 for a cluster deciding to sell at a given timestep .",
    "numerical results for the ez model showed that the distribution of returns @xmath71 with @xmath72 .",
    "we have carried out similar calculations for our model .",

    "the exponent @xmath73 is now _ non - universal _ and takes on the value @xmath74 , which is also the value of @xmath75 @xcite .    in summary ,",
    "we have proposed and studied the cluster size distribution , and the price return distribution , of a generalized version of the ez model .",
