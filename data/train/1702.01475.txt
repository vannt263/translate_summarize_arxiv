    "our knowledge about the universe surrounding us is far from being harmoniously unified .",
    "instead , we have a large catalogue of almost independent disciplines that constitute , with different degree of success , our comprehension on how nature works .",
    "quantum physics , chemistry , biology , and their subfields belong to such a hierarchical catalogue that could end with psychology and sociology .",
    "each of these fields of knowledge provides partial descriptions that correspond to different _ levels _ of reality chibbaro2014book .",
    "the relation between the basic laws of a discipline in terms of the ones ruling the previous level in the hierarchical tree ( usually called _ reduction _ ) is highly nontrivial as the  passage from one level to another may involve conceptual and mathematical discontinuities or phase transitions   @xcite . among these ,",
    "life and consciousness have proved to be the most elusive , with only a few hints as to when and why they emerge koch2012consciousness , hofstadter2013strange .    within the realm of physics , these transitions occur between different domains characterized by specific energy , time and length scales . here",
    ", we have reasons to be more optimistic since we have well - developed experimental and mathematical tools . to begin with , let us consider a textbook example which is close to our central problem of irreversibility , namely the derivation of equilibrium thermodynamics from classical statistical mechanics ( sm ) .",
    "the former , one of the driving forces behind the industrial revolution , describes the properties of matter in terms of pressure , volume , temperature , among other macroscopic variables .",
    "the latter , mainly developed by james c. maxwell , ludwig boltzmann and josiah w. gibbs , provides a probabilistic description of a system composed by @xmath4 atomic  constituents .",
    "these elementary entities , and the way in which they interact , are described by means of classical mechanics ( cm ) .",
    "in fact , boltzmann @xcite considered _ _ the world as a mechanical system of an enormously large number of constituents , and of an immensely long period of time  _ _ @xmath5,i.e . what we currently call the thermodynamic limit of @xmath6 and then @xmath7 .",
    "then , simple macroscopic relations ( thermodynamic equations of state ) can be derived from sm by focusing on certain microscopic observables and taking such a limit .    while the previous _",
    "reduction _ framework works in principle , and to a large extent in practice , it fails when dealing with specific and highly nontrivial physical situations : the critical points .",
    "indeed , a critical point indicates the onset of a phase transition , where the thermodynamic variables , expressed as functions of certain control variable , become non - analytic or even diverge . here , the reduction paradigm has to be replaced by the _ emergence _ of qualitatively new phenomena . as stated by sir michael berry @xcite ,    _ _ thermodynamics is a continuum theory , so reduction has to show that density fluctuations arising from interatomic forces have a finite ( and microscopic ) range .",
    "this is true everywhere except at the critical point , where there are fluctuations on all scales up to the sample size .",
    "thus , at criticality the continuum limit does not exist , corresponding to a new state of matter . in terms of our general picture ,",
    "the critical state is a singularity of thermodynamics , at which its smooth reduction to statistical mechanics breaks down ; nevertheless , out of this singularity , emerges a large class of new ` critical phenomena ' , which can be understood by a careful study of the large-__@xmath4 _",
    "asymptotes . _",
    "our everyday experience corresponds to a macroscopically large classical domain , where our falling glass shatters , our cup of coffee cools down , and the ice cube left out of the refrigerator melts .",
    "all of these _ irreversible _ phenomena are manifestations of the well known second law of thermodynamics , i.e. things evolve towards an unavoidable increase of entropy .",
    "indeed , the physical description of such a macroscopic domain involves time - asymmetric equations of motion , such as hydrodynamic and diffusive ones .",
    "as already stated , the elementary or microscopic constituents of each macroscopic entity belong to a more fundamental  level , whose physical description involves time - symmetric equations of motion , such as newtonian dynamics or , even better , the schrdinger equation . in other words , while the microscopic world is reversible , the macroscopic one is not .",
    "this paradoxical contrast has fed a recurrent controversy since the end of the nineteenth century to the present day .",
    "our position on this issue relies on the emergence of irreversibility from a microscopically reversible quantum dynamics provided that the thermodynamic limit ( tl ) @xmath6 is appropriately considered .",
    "this article constitutes an invitation to the study of irreversibility as en emergent phenomenon following a pathway much entangled with a series of nmr experiments led by patricia levstein and horacio pastawski at crdoba , argentina @xcite . in what follows ,",
    "we discuss and summarize the key concepts on this regard in a manner suitable for a broad readership .",
    "novel results and new insights of interest for specialists are discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec_dple ] .      in his attempt to reconcile the irreversible nature of the second law with the reversible newtonian laws of motion underlying sm , boltzmann considered the evolution of a gas composed by colliding particles which is prepared out of equilibrium .",
    "such a complex system was then described according to a kinetic equation that irreversibly leads the system to equilibrium . here",
    ", the time - reversal symmetry is removed through the assumption of molecular chaos  or _ stosszahl - ansatz_. this hypothesis implies that after each particle collision ( characterized by a typical time ) the memory of the previous state is lost .",
    "boltzmann s approach finally led him to the celebrated @xmath8 theorem , which is the first formal justification of the second law . at that time , joseph loschmidt raised the objection that for every possible trajectory that leads to equilibrium there will be another trajectory , equally possible , that would lead to the initial out - of - equilibrium state .",
    "therefore , it would be possible to revert the velocities of every particle to get again a low entropy state . as an answer , boltzmann emphasized on the extreme practical difficulty of achieving the time reversed evolution proposed by loschmidt , allegedly by saying _",
    "it is you who would invert the velocities ! _",
    "@xcite .",
    "boltzmann himself improved his theory transforming it into a probabilistic description .",
    "more precisely , the separation between microscopic and macroscopic scales , is exactly what enables us to predict the _ typical _ evolution of a particular macroscopic system .",
    "in fact , this constitutes the modern wisdom that explains the so called irreversibility paradox . as stated by joel lebowitz lebowitzrmp1999",
    "( see also @xcite ) ,    _ ... several interrelated ingredients which together provide the sharp distinction between microscopic and macroscopic variables required for the emergence of definite time - asymmetric behavior in the evolution of the latter despite the total absence of such asymmetry in the dynamics of individual atoms .",
    "they are : ( a ) the great disparity between microscopic and macroscopic scales , ( b ) the fact that events are , as put by boltzmann , determined not only by differential equations , but also by initial conditions , and ( c ) the use of probabilistic reasoning : it is not every microscopic state of a macroscopic system that will evolve in accordance with the second law , but only the ` majority '  of cases  a majority which however becomes so overwhelming when the number of atoms in the system becomes very large that irreversible behavior becomes a near certainty .",
    "_    the key point here is that , already in the classical boltzmann s approach , the notion of the _ emergent _ irreversibility depends somehow on the conditions under which the passage from the microscopic to the macroscopic domain is performed .",
    "more precisely , the main _ qualitative _ features of this paradigm have only a slight dependence on the specific details of the underlying microscopic dynamics . however , there exist microscopic properties that do determine the _ quantitative _ description of the macroscopic evolution @xcite . in other words ,",
    "the derivation of hydrodynamic and diffusive macroscopic equations ultimately depends on the behavior of microscopic trajectories .",
    "these microscopic details can include two mutually complementary properties :  an extreme sensitivity towards initial conditions , i.e. _ chaoticity _ , and a tendency towards a uniform distribution of the state in the available phase space , i.e. _",
    "mixing_.    let us explore the two ingredients just mentioned in the context of few - body cm .",
    "according to cm , the state of a system , composed by @xmath4 particles in @xmath9 dimensions , is described as a point @xmath10 in a ( @xmath11)-dimensional phase space .",
    "if the system is conservative , the energy is the primary conserved quantity , and the phase space is restricted to a hypersurface @xmath12 of @xmath13 dimensions usually called _",
    "energy shell_. in this scenario , _ chaos _ implies that two trajectories in @xmath12 , starting from points separated by an arbitrarily small distance @xmath14 , will separate exponentially as a function of time , @xmath15 $ ] . here , the typical inverse time @xmath16 is a lyapunov characteristic exponent .",
    "the _ mixing _ property implies that the system evolves over time so that any given region contained in @xmath12 eventually overlaps with any other given region in @xmath12 .",
    "this can be thought as an intertwined  picture of the phase space .",
    "none of these properties are satisfied in the case of fully integrable systems , since their solutions are regular and non - dense orbits in @xmath12 .",
    "but if integrability is completely broken , chaos and mixing imply that the orbits become irregular and cover @xmath12 densely .",
    "this means that an actual trajectory @xmath17 will be arbitrarily close to every possible configuration within @xmath12 , provided that enough time has elapsed .",
    "this last observation embodies the concept of _ ergodicity _ : an observable can be equivalently evaluated by averaging it for different configurations in @xmath12 or by its time - average along a single trajectory @xmath17 .",
    "such a property is the cornerstone of -classical- sm since it sets the equivalence between the gibbs description in terms of ensembles and boltzmann kinetic approach .",
    "furthermore , we remark that this result does not depend on the limit @xmath6 .    by the early 1950 s ,",
    "enrico fermi , john pasta and stanislaw ulam ( fpu ) fpu tried to study when and how the integrability breakdown could lead to an ergodic behavior within a deterministic evolution .",
    "they considered a string of harmonic oscillators perturbed by anharmonic forces in order to verify that these nonlinearities can lead to energy equi - partition as a manifestation of ergodicity . even though ulam himself stated",
    "_ the motivation then was to observe the rates of mixing and thermalization ... _",
    "@xcite , the results were not those expected : thermalization  dynamics did not show up at all .",
    "instead , the dynamics of the fpu problem , at least for the small number of particles considered , evidenced remarkable recurrences much as those invoked by henri poincar in his famous recurrence theorem poincare1890probleme , zermelo1,brushbook .",
    "nowadays , the striking fpu results are understood in terms of the theory of chaos @xcite .",
    "more precisely , the microscopic instabilities are systematically described by the theory of dynamical chaos developed by boris chirikov @xcite .",
    "in fact , the onset of dynamical chaos can be identified with the transition from non - ergodic to ergodic behavior @xcite . a more general criterion for the onset of ergodicity",
    "is given by the kolmogorov - arnold - moser ( kam ) theorem kamscholarpedia .",
    "it predicts that a weak nonlinear perturbation of an integrable system destroys the constants of motion only locally in the regions of resonances .",
    "in other regions of the phase space , islands of quasi - periodic motion persist .",
    "although a direct application of kam theorem to the fpu model suffers from technical difficulties , it constitutes the main indication that one should not naively expect that weak nonlinear perturbations ensure ergodicity .",
    "in addition , it is crucial to remember that real physical systems are neither closed nor finite in a strict sense .",
    "already boltzmann used this argument to conjure up the peril that cyclic or recurrent motion posed on sm @xcite :    _ in practice , however , the walls are continuously undergoing perturbations , which will destroy the periodicity resulting from the finite number of molecules_.    furthermore , the final way out should be found outside the realm of cm , in a description already foreseen by boltzmann , an emergent from a many - body ( quantum ) description in the tl @xmath6 @xcite :    _ since today it is popular to look forward to the time when our view of nature will have been completely changed , i will mention the possibility that the fundamental equations for the motion of individual molecules will turn out to be only approximate formulas which give average values , resulting from the probability calculus from the interactions of many independent moving entities forming the surrounding medium  as for example metheorology laws are valid only on average values obtained by long series of observations using the probability calculus .",
    "these entities must be of course so numerous and must act so rapidly that the correct average values are attained in millionths of a second .",
    "_      is it possible to formulate an straightforward extension of the previous physical picture within quantum mechanics ( qm ) ?",
    "any closed and finite quantum system involves a discrete energy spectrum and evolves quasi - periodically in the hilbert space , which becomes the quantum analogue to the classical phase space . as in cm , a closed and finite quantum system is intrinsically reversible due to the unitarity of the evolution operator .",
    "however , there exists a crucial difference : while integrability , ergodicity and chaos are well - established concepts within cm , their extensions in qm are much less clear .",
    "the notion of _ integrability _ in the qm literature may refer to different criteria .",
    "contrary to cm , the existence of @xmath4 independent ( local ) conserved mutually commuting linearly independent operators  does not necessarily imply that the system is exactly solvable  in the quantum domain   @xcite .",
    "in addition , the concept of _ ergodicity _ in qm has also generated intense debate , even after the recent rediscovery of the john von neumann s quantum ergodic theorem vonneumannqet , lebowitzqet .",
    "last , but not least , the classical definition of chaos as the sensitivity to initial conditions does not apply to a wave equation as schrdinger s .",
    "indeed , we will discuss below that the quantum signature of dynamical chaos had to be found as an instability of a quantum evolution towards perturbations in the hamiltonian @xcite .",
    "a phenomenological description of irreversible dynamics within qm can be performed by postulating that the system of interest is in contact with an environment .",
    "this implies the removal of the assumption that the system is closed . as stated by gran lindblad @xcite ,",
    "_ it seems that the only possibility of introducing an irreversible behavior in a finite system is to avoid the unitary time development altogether by considering non - hamiltonian systems .",
    "one way of doing this is by postulating an interaction of the considered systems s with an external system r like a heat bath or a measuring instrument . _",
    "the first consequence of the coupling to infinitely many environmental degrees of freedom seems to be the destruction of quantum weirdness within the system .",
    "more precisely , this means the attenuation of the interferences evidenced in specific observables and , ultimately , the appearance of classicality @xcite .",
    "since this degradation is originated in the loss of phase - coherence between the components of specific quantum superpositions , such a process is called _",
    "decoherence_. this automatically implies that the open system dynamics is irreversible .",
    "a theoretical framework , developed in the 1960 s by leo kadanoff and gordon baym @xcite and by leonid keldysh @xcite , describes the non - equilibrium sm and it intrinsically deals with open - system dynamics .",
    "such a framework uses the tools of quantum field theory and it ultimately involves the tl . precisely , this limit may shadow the nature of the approximations involved . a more controlled  formalism to describe open - system dynamics had to wait until 1976 , when lindblad s work @xcite was independently and simultaneously complemented by vittorio gorini , andrzej kossakowski , and george sudarshan @xcite .",
    "they provide the mathematical structure of the quantum master equations ( qme ) , which in turn can be understood as generalized liouville - von neumann differential equations for the reduced density matrix . in this approach ,",
    "the system under study is finite and specific assumptions are made to describe its environment . these physical hypothesis , which are basically known as the markovian approximation , were already known and discussed in the 1950 s by felix bloch @xcite and ugo fano @xcite . as summarized by karl blum @xcite ,    _",
    "it is assumed that r has so many degrees of freedom that the effects of the interaction with s dissipate away quickly and will not react back onto s to any significant extent so that r remains described by a thermal equilibrium distribution at constant temperature , irrespective of the amount of energy and polarization diffusing into it from the system s. in other words , it is assumed that the reaction of s on r is neglected and the correlations between s and r , induced by the interaction , are neglected .",
    "_    the qme approach has proved to be operationally successful in describing the dynamics of open systems , as in the case of nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) @xcite and quantum optics * *  * * zoller_book , petruccione_book .",
    "the more prominent model within the theory of open quantum systems is the two - level system in the presence of a structured environment @xcite .",
    "in particular , the kadanoff - baym - keldysh approach was recently applied to such a model with the specific purpose of describing _",
    "quantum dynamical phase transitions _ @xcite .",
    "this novel phenomenon , firstly observed in nmr qdpt_exp , corresponds to a functional change or non - analyticities in the dynamics of specific observables .",
    "more recently , these transitions were also described by means of the qme approach @xcite . in any case",
    ", the environment is required to be already in the tl , a requisite automatically satisfied in the experimental realm .      as in the original boltzmann s gas of colliding molecules ,",
    "let us consider now a closed quantum system composed by a large number @xmath4 of interacting particles , e.g. fermions or spins in a lattice .",
    "we assume that the initial state of the system ( @xmath18 ) is given by @xmath19 , which does not commute with the time - independent hamiltonian @xmath20 .",
    "in other words , @xmath21 is a non - equilibrium state .",
    "its time evolution is given by @xmath22 \\hat{% \\rho}_{0}\\exp \\left [ \\frac{\\mathrm{i}}{\\hbar } t\\hat{h}\\right ] , \\]]which , being dependent on time through quasiperiodic functions , is nearly recurrent and , strictly speaking , it can not describe the approach to any equilibrium  state .",
    "this is merely the result of an unitary dynamics .",
    "given a specific observable , say @xmath23 , the time - evolution of its expectation value is : @xmath24surprisingly , provided that @xmath23 fulfils certain conditions , _ equilibration _ can occur for @xmath25 . here",
    ", equilibration means that after some transient behavior , @xmath26 reaches some stationaryvalue and remains _ close _ to it for _ most _ of the time vonneumannqet , lebowitzqet . there exists several theoretical and experimental questions around such idea @xcite . for instance , one may naturally ask on the conditions required for @xmath23 , @xmath27 , and @xmath19 in order to observe the equilibration of @xmath28 . indeed , it seems that a key requirement for equilibration is the _ locality _ of @xmath23 . loosely speaking",
    ", this means that @xmath23 involves only a small number of sites or particles .",
    "the idea of locality provides for a natural argument in favor of an apparently irreversible behavior of @xmath25 .",
    "indeed , if we observe  a local subsystem that involves only a small fraction of the degrees of freedom of the entire system , the coupling to the rest of the system mimics a coupling to an environment .",
    "therefore , as in the above discussion on open system dynamics , the relaxation of @xmath25 occurs due to the presence of a large environment observing  the subsystem .",
    "in such a case , the complete system is said to act as its own environment .    given an interacting many - body system ,",
    "is it natural to expect that local observables do equilibrate ?",
    "the answer is no , since there exist striking phenomena in which the equilibration mechanisms are completely inhibited .",
    "in fact , a paradigmatic example can be drawn from a very active area in physics : the _ quantum localization_. the concept was originally developed by philip w. anderson anderson1958 , who described the absence of diffusion of spin excitations in a disordered system .",
    "this phenomenon was observed by george feher in electron - nuclei double resonance experiments performed in doped semiconductors @xcite .",
    "while the problem had indeed a many - body nature , anderson succeed in simplifying it as a system of non - interacting electrons in a @xmath9-dimensional disordered lattice .",
    "he realized that its dynamics described by bloch states can change dramatically when a perturbing disordered potential exceeds a critical value .",
    "this is known as the extended - to - localized transition or anderson s localization ( al ) andersonrmp-1978 .",
    "indeed , if the disorder is small , single - particle states are essentially described in terms of the scattering of bloch states with some finite lifetime . precisely , this physical picture was employed by robert laughlin to re - examine quantum transport in a random potential as a problem of quantum chaos @xcite .",
    "he proved that the lyapunov characteristic exponent of the classical electron motion in such a potential can be identified with the collision rate @xmath29 appearing in ohm s law .",
    "this constitutes a conceptual link between chaos and diffusive transport .",
    "then , for small disorder , one can generally say that a local excitation is described as a wave packet that ultimately diffuses throughout the system .",
    "but al involves a paradigm shift : when the disorder is large enough , the eigenstates of the system become localized in the real space .",
    "thus , in contrast to the diffusive picture , localization implies that the excitation remains close to its initial location and transport phenomena is no longer possible @xcite . in some sense , the same impurities that produce chaos and lyapunov exponents , which make possible diffusion , dissipative transport and equilibration @xcite , end up conspiring against them . for dimension",
    "@xmath30 , even a weak disorder ensures the onset of al .",
    "a step beyond the standard al problem corresponds to the original problem of localization in interacting systems . as a matter of fact",
    ", adding interactions increases the effective dimensionality of the problem , and hence significantly magnifies its complexity . a clean ( ordered )",
    "system can already evidence a transition into an insulating phase if the interactions are strong enough .",
    "this is the case of the mott - hubbard transition , whose most paradigmatic case occurs in a crystal with one electron per atomic orbital .",
    "john hubbard showed by means of a hartree - fock calculation that for strong local electron - electron repulsion , an otherwise half - filled band of electronic states would split into an occupied band and an unoccupied one @xcite .",
    "this drives the system from a metallic phase to a insulator one @xcite , a situation that would persist at fillings where the strong electron - electron coulomb repulsion forbids the identification of single - particle bands .",
    "if the system is disordered , the naive expectation would be that interactions prevent the existence of al essentially for two reasons .",
    "first , collisional dephasing would destroy the specific interferences needed to localize .",
    "second , including interactions automatically implies an exponential increase in the fraction of the hilbert space required to describe the excitation dynamics .",
    "this , in turn , constitutes a more favorable scenario for diffusion , consistent with the fact that a large @xmath9 prevents localization .",
    "nevertheless , a different kind of transition does occur between extended and localized many - body phases , which is called many - body localization ( mbl ) altshuler2006,altshuler2010 .",
    "the mbl is a dynamical transition that results when both perturbations to bloch states , i.e. interactions and anderson disorder , are present . as in the al case ,",
    "an interacting many - body system is said to be localized if the diffusion or transport of excitations becomes frozen , and therefore a memory of the initial conditions is preserved in local observables for long times @xcite .",
    "however , there is a hierarchical difference between al and mbl : while the former deals with the eigenstates in a single particle hilbert space , the latter relies on the properties of the many - body eigenstates in the much bigger fock space .",
    "the study of localization phenomenon , and particularly the mbl , is extremely attractive from fundamental grounds .",
    "its importance traces back to the fpu problem and the ( classical ) theoretical framework developed to understand it . as in the attempt by fermi and collaborators ,",
    "the current aim is to study simple quantum models that could go parametrically from an ergodic to a non - ergodic quantum dynamics .",
    "moreover , a fundamental question is whether such a transition occurs as a smooth crossover or it has a critical value , a sort of generalized quantum kam threshold @xcite . as a matter of fact , the mbl transition is the promising candidate in the quantum realm .",
    "if the many - body states are extended , then one may expect that the system is ergodic enough to behave as its own environment , and , as stated before , equilibration is enabled .",
    "quite on the contrary , if the many - body states are localized , any initial excitation would remain out - of - equilibrium . in this case",
    ", equilibration is precluded .",
    "therefore the mbl would evidence the sought threshold between ergodic and non - ergodic behaviors .    during the last years",
    ", the literature dealing with the dynamics of equilibration and thermalization has grown overwhelmingly ( see refs . eisert2016 and @xcite ) . on the experimental side ,",
    "an extreme degree of isolation and control has been achieved , such as in the case of ultracold quantum gases @xcite , trapped ions blatt_review2012 and also nmr @xcite . on the theoretical side ,",
    "the use of the hubbard model @xcite has proven useful to address the dynamics of strongly - interacting many - body systems tomadin2007,buonsante2008,shepelyansky2016 .",
    "in addition , for spin systems , numerical studies have provided evidence indicating that the competence between disorder and interactions may lead to highly non - trivial dynamical phase diagrams @xcite .",
    "we are now ready to focus on our major question .",
    "namely , to what extent would equilibration , as introduced above , could turn the excitation spreading into an irreversible phenomenon ? in order to tackle such a question , we consider specifically a system composed by @xmath4 quantum spins which is perturbed from a high temperature equilibrium by injecting a local polarization excess .",
    "in addition , we assume that the system can indeed equilibrate , i.e. dynamics can lead to a homogeneous distribution of the polarization .",
    "such an equilibration of the polarization is a consequence of a mechanism usually called _ spin diffusion _ blumehubbard1970,forsterbook .",
    "however , even though a particular observable seems to have reached equilibrium , a unitary quantum dynamics would ensure a precise memory of the non - equilibrium initial condition .",
    "in other words , the initial state is completely encoded into correlations ( eventually non - local ) present in the evolved state .",
    "if some experimental protocol could manage to achieve the inverse evolution operator , i.e. to _ reverse _ the many - body dynamics , then it would drive the system back to the initial non - equilibrium state hahn_atomicmemory .",
    "this echo idea  has remained at the heart of nmr .",
    "in fact , the first nmr time - reversal experiments were performed by erwin hahn in the 1950 s @xcite . there , the total polarization , that sums up contributions from individual spins , when lying perpendicular to the external magnetic field , will ideally precess indefinitely .",
    "however , each independent spin contributing to the polarization precesses at different velocity  due to the local inhomogeneities of the magnetic field .",
    "this dephasing produces the decay of the observed polarization .",
    "hahn s procedure involves the inversion of the sign of the zeeman energy in order to reverse these precessions .",
    "if such an inversion is performed at time @xmath0 , it will produce the refocusing of the total polarization at time @xmath1 , which is the well known spin echo . nevertheless , the  sign of the energy scale associated to the spin - spin interactions is not inverted and , accordingly , the echo signal @xmath2 becomes progressively degraded with @xmath31 this decay has a characteristic time scale called @xmath32 which , in a crystal , characterizes these many - body interactions .    by the early 1970 s , horst kessemeier",
    ", won - kyu rhim , alex pines , and john waugh implemented the reversal of the dynamics induced by the spin - spin dipolar interaction which was missed by the hahn s procedure kessemeier1971,rhim1971 .",
    "this results in the magic echo  signal , which indicates the recovery of a global polarization state .",
    "two decades later , richard ernst and collaborators introduced the polarization echo  ernst1992 .",
    "there , the polarization along the external field is injected _ locally _ at some labeled spins .",
    "as the global polarization is a conserved quantity in this experiment , the local polarization diffuses away for a time @xmath0 due to the spin - spin dipolar interaction .",
    "since it originates in many - spin interactions , this spreading occurs in time scale @xmath33 . by the implementation of a time - reversal procedure involving a change in the sign of the spin - spin energy at time @xmath0 ,",
    "some polarization @xmath2 is recovered at time @xmath1 in the same initial spots where it was injected .    while the success of these time reversal echoes unambiguously evidenced the deterministic and quantum nature of spin - dynamics in nmr , it is unavoidable that the reversal results degraded by uncontrolled internal or environmental degrees of freedom , or by imperfections in the pulse sequences . in terms of the theory of open quantum systems",
    ", these perturbations would constitute sources of decoherence .",
    "quite often , their precise assessment could only be evidenced through the time reversal experiment patricia98,hmp_revmex1998 .",
    "in addition , it was noticed that , since in the polarization echo  experiments the total polarization is a conserved quantity , an imperfectly recovered @xmath2  would be roughly proportional to inverse of the number of spins among which the polarization is distributed .",
    "this gives a clear entropic meaning for @xmath34$]@xcite .",
    "most importantly , the degradation of @xmath2 in suchexperiments , where the many - spin interactions are globally and quite perfectly time - reversed , occurs in a new time scale @xmath35 .",
    "remarkably , the experiments indicate that @xmath35 seems to be much shorter than any naive estimation of the characteristic time scale of the perturbations , say @xmath36 .",
    "thus , the question is whether the complexity inherent to a large number of correlated spins would enhance the fragility of the procedure under perturbations @xcite .",
    "the time - reversal procedures just described can be thought as a quantum realization of the gedanken experiment suggested by loschmidt .",
    "as mentioned above , he proposed the reversal of the particles velocities as a mechanism for undoing the increase of entropy .",
    "actually , the aforementioned nmr time - reversal experiments are specific procedures for backtrace the time evolution @xcite .",
    "this led patricia levstein and horacio pastawski to define the _",
    "loschmidt echo_(le ) as an idealization which embodies the various , eventually imperfect , time - reversal procedures implemented in nmr @xcite .",
    "a next generation of experiments in organic crystals patricia98,usaj - physicaa , molphys , suggested that the experimental time scale for irreversibility @xmath35 never exceeds more than a few times @xmath37 and indeed , it remains tied to it @xcite .",
    "thus , it seems that one is left with a sort of unbeatable limit , @xmath38the most immediate conclusion would be that there is still an uncontrolled source of decoherence not described by @xmath39 , an explanation that both theoreticians and experimentalists would subscribe to zurekpolonica .",
    "however , the experiments hinted that this perturbation independent decay  ( pid )  has a much deeper origin , with @xmath35 acting as a sort of inverse lyapunov exponent usaj - physicaa .",

[ fig_dplenumeric]-(*a * ) shows a forward autocorrelation function that corresponds to the dynamical preparation , i.e. @xmath180 the time - evolution of the local polarization at site @xmath58 is monitored and it is observed that it stabilizes near zero within the characteristic time of equilibration @xmath181 .",

    "the fact that @xmath113 no longer depends on the precise value of @xmath189 ( provided that it exceeds @xmath121 ) indicates that the specific phases in the state @xmath190 have become non - relevant for the dynamics of the polarization .",

    "it is also worthwhile to notice the clear exponential nature of the decay .",
    "the previous observation essentially states the equivalence @xmath197 in the regime where @xmath198 .",
    "moreover , it identifies such saturation as the overlap between two random superposition states that evolve ruled by perturbed and unperturbed hamiltonians .",
    "this is essentially the many - body extension of the semiclassical le definition @xcite .",
    "then , when the dynamical preparation creates a sufficiently complex state , a given perturbation yields a local le that is same as a global one for the same perturbation .",
    "the mentioned saturation is relevant for the picture of equilibration discussed in section [ sec_eqloc ] .",
    "when the preparation dynamics equilibrates the polarization , the state @xmath199 can be replaced by the _ equilibrated _ state @xmath196 , as far as the evaluation of polarization is concerned .",
    "the random phases in @xmath200 correspond to the fact that equilibration of a local observable is reached when the global correlations are irrelevant or at least redundant for such observable .",
    "a similar argument has already been discussed precisely in the context of the le @xcite , and it provides a hint for theoretical investigations on the onset of equilibration for local observables in closed many - body systems .",
    "our observations here may also provide new strategies to understand the experimental results discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec_lediscussion ] . since the le decay accelerates as a function of @xmath111 , the fragility of the reversal procedure in the presence of perturbations can be systematically quantified as a function of @xmath111 .",
    "more precisely , this indicates that the preparation dynamics contributes to the time - scale of the le decay . according to the experimental hints",
    ", this contribution would ultimately be the dominant term in the time - scale of le decay .",
    "of course , this last scenario corresponds to the tl , and thus an appropriate finite size scaling would be needed to confirm it .",
    "starting from a conceptual and historical discussion on the microscopic foundations of the second law of thermodynamics as an emergent of classical mechanics , we have introduced and motivated the study of the loschmidt echo ( le ) as tool that could help us to reveal the origin of irreversibility in a quantum mechanical framework . in particular , we discussed the le as defined for spin systems , which corresponds to the original nmr polarization echo experiments where the global polarization is a conserved observable .",
    "such experimental le evaluations have supported an emergent , and quite paradoxical , picture for irreversibility , here embodied by our _ central hypothesis of irreversibility _ : in an infinite many - spin system in a highly mixed state , any arbitrarily small perturbation is amplified by the progressively increased complexity resulting from the many - body dynamics , which then becomes the dominant time - scale .",
    "thus , the reversal procedure would ultimately be degraded within a time scale determined by such complex , but reversible , many - body interactions .    by formulating the le in spin systems as a local autocorrelation function",
    ", we were able to define the non - local or global le , and we proposed a protocol to transform the local le into a global one .",
    "this means that a local le can be employed to measure a global overlap between many - body states .",
    "this modified le procedure introduces a dynamical preparation of the initial state , which creates correlations by means of an ( ideally reversible ) evolution . in practice ,",
    "our numerical results confirm that the more correlated the state is , the more fragile under perturbations it becomes , which is manifested in much shorter , perturbation dependent , time scales .",
    "moreover , the decay saturates at a specific time - scale that corresponds to the global le of random superposition states .",
    "this occurs precisely when the preparation time @xmath111 exceeds the equilibration time @xmath201 of the polarization .",
    "such a saturation indicates that the local le no longer depends on the precise value of @xmath111 . in other words , a local observation of the polarization",
    "does not depend on the specific phases encoded in the many - body evolved state .",
    "our observations provide for a possible way to understand the experimentally observed pid .",
    "indeed , we showed that reversible dynamics transforms the original local excitation state into a more complex and sensitive one , which in turn is shown to be much more likely to be affected by any small residual perturbation .",
    "the time scale at which complexity is being generated could then appear as the dominant time - scale . this dynamical regime , however , has not yet been reached in numerical simulations , as the number of involved spins does not seem to be large enough .",
    "thus , while we are not yet in a position to present a definite numerical test for the central hypothesis of irreversibility , it is worthwhile to mention that the state preparation scheme discussed here can be implemented in a variety of actual nmr experiments .",
