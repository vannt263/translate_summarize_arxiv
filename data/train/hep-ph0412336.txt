    "the qcd phase diagram at finite temperatures and densities attracted increasing attention  @xcite , especially as it became possible to perform lattice qcd simulations at finite baryo - chemical potential @xmath1  @xcite .",
    "the numerical studies for the equation of state at finite @xmath1 provides a valuable framework for understanding the experimental signatures for the phase transition from confined hadrons to quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) .",
    "the heavy - ion experiments are aiming to explore the qcd phase diagram .",
    "therefore , it is of great interest to show the interrelation between strangeness and baryo - chemical potentials and @xmath5 in hadron resonance gas model ( hrgm ) compared with the available lattice qcd simulations .",
    "it is known that qcd phase diagram has a very rich structure . from numerical simulations , we know that the location of the phase transition line depends on the quark masses and flavors and the way of including the strange quark chemical potential @xmath8 at different values of @xmath1 and @xmath4 .",
    "the isospin chemical potential can play an additional role .",
    "but relative to @xmath1 and @xmath8 , the isospin chemical potential is very small , so that we can assume an entire symmetry in light quark potentials and therefore ignore the isospin chemical potential .",
    "the first point in qcd phase diagram , namely the point at @xmath5 and @xmath9 , has been a subject of different lattice simulations  @xcite .",
    "we know so far that for two quark flavors ( @xmath10 ) the transition is second order or rapid crossover and the critical temperature is @xmath11mev . for @xmath12",
    ", we have a first order phase transition and @xmath13mev . for @xmath14 ,",
    "i.e. two degenerate light quarks and one heavy strange quark , the transition is crossover and @xmath15mev . for the pure gauge theory , @xmath16  mev and the deconfinement phase transition is first order .",
    "the lattice qcd simulations at @xmath17 is still lacking an effective exact algorithm and suffer from the sign - problem .",
    "the fermion determinant gets complex and therefore the conventional monte  carlo  techniques are no longer applicable , since the lattice configurations can no longer be generated with the probability of the boltzmann weight .",
    "however , during the last few years considerable progress has been made to overcome these problems  .",
    "the significant numerical results on positioning the qcd phase diagram we have so far is that the transition line can be described by a parabola .",
    "this simple relation can be viewed as a reflection of the truncations done in the taylor expansions of different thermodynamic quantities calculated on lattice . in addition , we know from effective models such as bootstrap and nambu - jona - lasinio models that the structure of the phase diagram is complex .",
    "the freeze - out curve takes a much different behavior at large chemical potential  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , one might think that for small chemical potential ( @xmath18 ) the curvature of @xmath5-dependence upon @xmath19 can be fitted as a parabola , where @xmath19 is the quark baryo - chemical potential .",
    "the situation at very large chemical potentials is not clear .",
    "one might need to take into account other effects , such as quantum effects at low temperatures  @xcite , which might be able to describe the change in the correlations from confined hadrons to coupled quark - pairs .    in present work , we take advantage of our previous work  @xcite on analysis the critical temperatures @xmath5 for different quark masses and on reproducing the lattice thermodynamics at zero and finite @xmath1 by hrgm .",
    "we assumed that the deconfinement is driven by a constant energy density .",
    "we have shown  @xcite that the degrees of freedom rapidly increase at @xmath20 .",
    "here , we assume that @xmath21 remains constant along the whole phase transition line  @xcite , @xmath22 . concretely , we propose that the existence of different transitions does not affect the assumption that @xmath21 is constant for all @xmath1-values .",
    "we have to emphasize here that it is not possible in the framework of this model to make any statement about the transition at very large @xmath1 and low @xmath4 . as @xmath23",
    ", hrgm is no longer applicable .",
    "the nature of the degrees of freedom in this region is very different from that of the _ nearly _ non - interacting qgp at high @xmath4 and low @xmath1 .",
    "the message we have in this paper is that the condition driving the qcd phase transition at finite @xmath4 and @xmath1  @xcite is the energy density .",
