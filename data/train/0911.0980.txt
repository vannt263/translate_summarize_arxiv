    "while the evolution of the dark matter is reasonably well understood , the evolution of the baryonic component is much less certain because of the complexity of the relevant physical processes , such as star formation and feedback . with the",

    "supernovae inject not only thermal energy but also heavy elements into the interstellar medium , which can enhance star formation .",
    "chemical enrichment must be solved as well as energy feedback .",
    "`` feedback '' is also important for solving the angular momentum problem and the missing satellite problem , and for explaining the existence of heavy elements in intracluster medium and intergalactic medium , and the mass - metallicity relation of galaxies ( @xcite , hereafter k07 ) .    in the next decade",

    " although the explosion mechanism of core - collapse supernovae is a debated issue , the ejected explosion energy and @xmath0ni mass ( which decayed to @xmath0fe ) can be directly estimated from the observations , i.e. , the light curve and spectra fitting of individual supernova . as a result",
    ", it is found that many core - collapse supernovae have more than ten times larger explosion energy ( @xmath1 ) and produce a significant amount of iron .",
    "we calculate the nucleosynthesis yields for wide ranges of metallicity ( @xmath2 ) and the explosion energy ( normal sne ii and hne ) . assuming that a half of supernovae with @xmath3 are hne , the evolution of the elemental abundance ratios from carbon to zinc are in good agreement with observations in the solar neighborhood , bulge , halo , and thick disk ( @xcite , hereafter k06 ) .",

    "the star formation history and total number of sne ia are determined to meet the observed metallicity distribution function . in the early stage of galaxy formation ,",

    "ti is underabundant overall , which could be solved with 2d calculation .",
    "the observed decrease in the odd - z elements ( na , al , and cu ) toward low [ fe / h ] is reproduced by the metallicity effect on nucleosynthesis .",
    "the iron - peak elements ( cr , mn , co , and ni ) are consistent with the observed mean values at @xmath6 [ fe / h ] @xmath5 , and the observed trend at the lower metallicity can be explained by the energy effect under the assumption of inhomogeneous enrichment .",
    "note that cr ii observations are plotted .",
    "the most important improvement is in zn .",
    "the observed abundance of zn ( [ zn / fe ] @xmath7 ) can be explained only by such large contribution of hne . since the observed [ zn / fe ] shows an increase toward lower metallicity ( primas et al .",

    "2007 ) , the hn fraction may be larger in the earlier stage of galaxy formation .",
    "since neutron - rich isotopes @xmath8zn are produced at high metallicity , the hn fraction can be as small as @xmath9 . in the following chemodynamical simulations , we adopt @xmath10 for @xmath11 .",
    "pair - instability supernovae , which produce much more fe , more [ s / fe ] , and less [ zn / fe ] , should not contribute in the galactic chemical evolution .",
    "* type ia supernovae ( sne ia ) *  the progenitors of the majority of sne ia are most likely the chandrasekhar ( ch ) mass white dwarfs ( wds ) . for the evolution of accreting c+o wds toward the ch mass , two scenarios have been proposed : one is the double - degenerate ( dd ) scenario , i.e. , merging of double c+o wds with a combined mass surpassing the ch mass limit , although it has been theoretically suggested that it leads to accretion - induced collapse rather than sne ia .",
    "the other is our single - degenerate ( sd ) scenario , i.e. , the wd mass grows by accretion of hydrogen - rich matter via mass transfer from a binary companion .",
    "we construct a new model of sne ia , based on the sd scenario , taking account of the metallicity dependences of the wd wind ( @xcite ) and the mass - stripping effect on the binary companion star ( @xcite ) .",
    "our model naturally predicts that the sn ia lifetime distribution spans a range of @xmath12 gyr with the double peaks at @xmath13 and @xmath14 gyr .",
    "while the present sn ia rate in elliptical galaxies can be reproduced with the old population of the red - giants+wd systems , the large sn ia rate in radio galaxies could be explained with the young population of the main - sequence+wd systems .",
    "because of the metallicity effect , i.e. , because of the lack of winds from wds in the binary systems , the sn ia rate in the systems with [ fe / h ] @xmath5 , e.g. , high - z spiral galaxies , is supposed to be very small .",
    "we succeed in reproducing the galactic supernova rates with their dependence on the morphological type of galaxies , and the cosmic sn ia rate history with a peak at @xmath15 . at @xmath16 ,",
    "the predicted sn ia rate decreases toward higher redshifts and sne ia will be observed only in the systems that have evolved with a short timescale of chemical enrichment .",
    "this suggests that the evolution effect in the supernova cosmology can be small .    from [ fe / h ] @xmath17 ,",
    "sne ia start to occur producing more fe than @xmath4-elements , and thus [ @xmath4/fe ] decreases toward the solar abundance .",
    "the decreasing [ fe / h ] depends on the sn ia progenitor model .",
    "our sn ia model can give better reproduction of the [ ( @xmath4 , mn , zn)/fe]-[fe / h ] relations in the solar neighborhood than other models such as the dd scenario ( dotted lines ) .",
    "with the dd scenario , the typical lifetimes of sne ia are @xmath13 gyr , which results in the too early decrease in [ @xmath4/fe ] at [ fe / h ] @xmath18 . even with our sd model ,",
    "if we do not include the metallicity effect , [ @xmath4/fe ] decreases too early because of the shortest lifetime , @xmath13 gyr , of the ms+wd systems .",
    "in other words , the metallicity effect is more strongly required in the presence of the young population of sne ia .    * asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) stars *  stars with initial masses between about @xmath19 ( depending on metallicity ) produce light elements such as c and n , while the contribution of heavier elements are negligible in the galactic chemical evolution ( solid lines ) .",
    "the nucleosynthesis yields of agb stars involves uncertainties due to convection and mass loss .",
    "we introduce the new calculation by karakas ( 2009 ) , which is based on karakas & lattanzio ( 2007 ) .",
    "the na overproduction problem has been solved with the updated reaction rates ( karakas 2009 ) .",
    "needless to say , the envelope mass and pre - existing heavy elements are returned by stellar winds from all stars .",
    "surprisingly , in many hydrodynamical simulations , this contribution is not included , which should affect the metallicity and star formation history .",

    "the gravity is calculated in direct summation using the special purpose computer grape ( gravity pipe ) . for cosmological simulations",

    "since an individual star particle has a mass of @xmath25 , it dose not represent a single star , but an association of many stars .",
    "the mass of the stars associated with each star particle is distributed according to an initial mass function ( imf ) .",
    "we adopt a salpter imf with a slope @xmath26 , which give good agreement with many observations except for the [ @xmath4/fe ] problem in elliptical galaxies .",

    "are ejected from an evolved star particle as functions of time and metallicity , and are distributed to all surrounding gas particles out to a constant radius of 1 kpc (  4 ) , or with the number of feedback neighbors @xmath27 (  5 ) .",

    "we simulate the chemodynamical evolution of the milky way - type galaxy from the cdm initial fluctuation .",

    "@xmath51 , the scatter is large .",
