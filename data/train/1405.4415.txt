    "luminosities and spectra emanating from the microquasars and agns are best explained by the gravitational energy released due to accretion onto compact objects such as black holes .",
    "however , it has been established in recent years , that black hole candidates , be it stellar mass or super massive , emits powerful collimated outflows or jets @xcite . since black holes",
    "do not have intrinsic atmosphere or hard surface , these jets have to be generated from the accretion disc itself . in a very interesting paper ,",
    "@xcite had shown that jets originate from around a region less than @xmath0 ( @xmath1 schwarzschild radius ) across the central object of the nearby active galaxy m87 . since the typical timescale of an agn or a microquasar scales with mass , temporal behaviour of black hole candidates",
    "is studied with microquasars @xcite .",
    "after investigating the connection between accretion and ejection in ten microquasars , @xcite concluded that mildly relativistic , quasi steady jets are generally ejected in the low hard spectral states ( when electromagnetic spectra peak in the high energy power - law frequency range ) of the accretion disc .",
    "it was also shown that jets tend to get stronger as the microquasar moves to the intermediate hard states , and truly relativistic ejections are observed during hard - intermediate to soft - intermediate transition , after which the microquasar enters canonical high soft state ( when spectra peak in the thermal low energy range ) , which shows no jet activity @xcite .",
    "all these evidences suggest that the generation or quenching of jets do depend on various states of the accretion disc , and that , the jet formation mechanism is linked with the processes that dominate at distances relatively closer to the black hole .    it is well known that , spectra from microquasar change states between , the low hard state ( lh ) and high soft state ( hs ) , through a series of intermediate states .",
    "interestingly , the hard power - law photons exhibit a quasi - periodic oscillations ( qpo ) .",
    "the qpos evolve along with the spectral states of the accretion disc , starting with low frequencies in lh , increasing as the luminosity increases , and reaches highest value before disappearing in the hs state @xcite .",
    "interestingly , although qpo frequency increases as the accretion disc moves from lh to intermediate states , but no qpo was detected during ejection of relativistic jets @xcite which suggests that , probably the part of the disc responsible for qpo is entirely ejected as relativistic jets .",
    "this conversely also suggests that , the inner part of the disc is responsible for qpos and is also the base of the jet .",
    "accretion disc models which are invoked to explain the accretion - ejection phenomena around black hole candidates , should at least address the connection between spectral states , qpo evolution and the evolution of jets , apart from matching the luminosities radiated by agns and microquasars .",
    "there are various accretion disc models in the literature .",
    "we know that , matter crosses the horizon with the speed of light ( @xmath2 ) and circular orbits can not exist within the marginally stable orbit ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "so the inner boundary condition for accretion onto black hole is necessarily transonic , as well as , sub - keplerian , which implies that advection should be significant at least close to the horizon .",
    "the very first model of accretion onto black holes was of course radial inflow of matter , which was basically the general relativistic version of the bondi solutions @xcite .",
    "however , the infall time scale of radial accretion onto black holes is short , and therefore has very little time to produce the huge luminosities observed from agns and microquasars @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", @xcite considered a geometrically thin but optically thick accretion disc characterized by negligible advection , but by virtue of possessing keplerian angular momentum distribution , the disc was rotation dominated .",
    "this disc model was radiatively efficient and produced the multi - coloured blackbody part of the spectra or the ` blue bump ' radiated by the agns .",
    "however , the presence of hard power - law tail in the spectra of the black hole candidates indicated the necessity of a hot comptonizing cloud , which was neither present in keplerian disc nor its origin could be identified in any self - consistent manner from such a disc .",
    "therefore , models with advection gained importance .",
    "theoretically , it was shown that in a significant range of energy and angular momentum , multiple sonic points may exist for rotating , transonic accretion flows onto black holes , where the existence of the inner sonic point is purely due to the presence of gravity stronger than that due to the newtonian variety @xcite .",
    "it has been shown numerically as well as analytically , that such transonic matter in the multiple sonic point regime , may undergo steady or non - steady shock transition .",
    "shock in accretion may be pressure and centrifugally supported , if the flow is rotating @xcite or only be pressure supported if the flow is spherical @xcite .",
    "the most popular amongst accretion disc models with advection is the so - called advection dominated accretion flow ( adaf ) , and it is characterized by a single sonic point close to the horizon @xcite .",
    "it has been shown later , that adaf type solution is a subset of a general viscous advective accretion solutions @xcite .",
    "the shock in accretion disc around black holes has been shown to exist for multispecies flows with variable adiabatic index ( @xmath4 ) as well @xcite .",
    "shock transition for accretion flow are favourable mechanism to explain many of the observational features of black hole candidates .",
    "hot electrons in the post - shock region , abbreviated as cenbol ( centrifugal pressure supported boundary layer ) , may explain the power - law tail of the spectrum from black hole candidates in hard states , while a weak or no shock solution produces a dearth of hot electrons which may cause the weaker power - law tail in the soft states @xcite .",
    "moreover , a large number of authors have shown the formation of bipolar outflows from the post - shock accretion flow , both numerically @xcite as well as analytically @xcite .",
    "it is also interesting to note that , by considering a simplified inviscid accretion , and which has the right parameters to form a standing shock , @xcite qualitatively showed that there would be no jets in no - shock or weak shock condition of the disc , or in other words , when the disc is in the soft spectral state .",
    "this indicates the conclusions of @xcite .",
    "such a scheme of accretion - ejection solution is interesting because , the jet base is not the entire accretion disc but the inner part of the disc , as has been suggested by observations @xcite .",
    "although , most of the efforts have been undertaken theoretically to study steady shocks , perhaps transient shock formations may explain the transient events of the black hole candidates much better .",
    "@xcite , considered bremsstrahlung cooling of an inviscid flow , and reported there is significant oscillation of the post - shock region",
    ". since the post - shock flow is of higher density and temperature compared to the pre - shock flow , the cooling rates are higher .",
    "if the cooling timescale roughly matches with the infall timescale at the shock the resonance condition occurs and the post - shock flow oscillates . since the post - shock region is the source of hard x - rays @xcite , thus its oscillation would be reflected in the oscillation of the emitted hard x - rays  a plausible explanation for qpos @xcite . in this paper , we will focus on the oscillation of the shock front , but now due to viscosity instead of any cooling mechanism .",
    "@xcite had shown that , with the increase of viscosity parameter , in the energy - angular momentum parameter space , the domain of shock decreases .",
    "we know viscosity transports angular momentum outwards , while the specific energy increases inwards .",
    "how does the general flow properties of matter , which are being launched with same injection speed and temperature , be affected with the increase in viscosity parameter ?",
    "it has been shown from simulations and theoretical studies that post - shock matter is ejected as jets , however if the shock is weak then the jet should be of lower power",
    "! we would like to find the condition of the shocked disc that produces weak or strong jets .",
    "disc instability due to viscous transport has been shown before and has been identified with qpos @xcite , however , we would like to show how this instability might affect the shock induced bipolar outflows .",
    "moreover , it has been shown theoretically that the energy and angular momentum for which steady shock exists in inviscid flow , will become unstable for viscous flow @xcite .",
    "we would like to see how the mass outflow rate depend on unstable shock , or in other words , if there is any connection between qpos and mass outflow rate . in this paper",
    ", we would like to address these issues .    in the next section , we present the governing equations and model assumptions . in section 3",
    ", we present the results , and in the last section we draw concluding remarks .",

    "the role of viscosity is to remove angular momentum outwards , and consequently it perturbs the shock front , and may render the stationary shock unstable . in fig .",
    "2a , we show the time evolution of the shock location for inviscid accretion flow .",
    "the shock location is measured at the disc equatorial plane . here , we use input parameters as @xmath69 , @xmath70 , @xmath42 , and @xmath71 respectively . for @xmath72 , we find stable shock at around @xmath73 depicted in fig .",
    "when viscosity is increased further and reached its critical limit , namely @xmath74 , shock front starts oscillating and the oscillation sustains forever , provided the injected flow variables remain unaltered .",
    "this feature is shown in fig . 2c .",
    "for further increase of viscosity , the oscillation becomes irregular and for even higher @xmath26 , the shock oscillation is irrevocably unstable .",
    "we change the injection parameters to @xmath75 , @xmath54 , and @xmath76 at @xmath77 , and plot the time evolution of the shock @xmath78 for inviscid flow ( fig .",
    "2d ) , @xmath79 ( fig .",
    "2e ) and @xmath80 ( fig",
    "the mechanism of shock oscillation due to the presence of viscosity , may be understood in the following manner .",
    "we know viscosity transports angular momentum ( @xmath39 ) outwards .",
    "since the post - shock disc is hot , the angular momentum transport in the post - shock disc is more efficient than the pre - shock disc .",
    "accordingly , angular momentum piles up in the post shock region . on the other hand , a steady shock forms",
    "if the momentum flux , energy flux and mass flux are conserved across the shock .",
    "therefore , as the angular momentum piles up in the immediate post - shock region , extra centrifugal force will try to push the shock front outward . if this piling up of @xmath39 is moderate then the expanded shock front will find equilibrium at some position to form steady shock ( figs .",
    "2b , 2e ) .",
    "if this outward push is strong enough then the expanding shock front will overshoot a possible equilibrium position and in that case the shock front will oscillate ( figs .",
    "2c , 2f ) .",
    "if the angular momentum piling results in too strong centrifugal barrier , it could drive the shock out of the computation domain .",
    "it may be noted that we are simulating the inner part of the disc , the inner few @xmath81 of the disc . and",
    ", therefore the injection parameters are similar to the inner boundary conditions of an accretion disc . since matter entering a black hole has angular momentum , typically @xmath82 , our chosen angular momentum are also of the same order . however , at the outer edge angular momentum may reach very high value depending on @xmath26 .",
    "for example , with injection parameters @xmath69 , @xmath70 , @xmath42 , and @xmath71 , one can integrate the effective one dimensional equations of motion to estimate the angular momentum at the outer boundary and it is typically around @xmath83 at @xmath84 .",
    "to220 mm        [ landfig ]    from figs .",
    "2c-2e , it is clear that the shock can experience persistent oscillation for some critical viscosity and injection parameters .",
    "but the shock front is a surface and that too not a rigid one .",
    "therefore , every part of the shock front will not oscillate in the same phase , resulting in a phase lag between the shock front on and around the equatorial plane and the top of the shock front ( @xmath85 ) .",
    "for simplicity , we record the variation of shock location with time at the disc equatorial plane which is shown in _ top - left _",
    "panel of fig .",
    "3 . note that there exists quasi - periodicity in the variation of shock location with time .",
    "we identify eight shock locations within a given oscillation period that are marked in open circles .",
    "the respective velocity field and density contours ( solid , online red ) of the flow in the @xmath40 plane is shown in the rest of the panels of figs .",
    "3(a - h ) .",
    "higher density and extra thermal gradient force in the cenbol region causes a fraction of in falling matter to bounce - off as outflow .",
    "when shock front oscillates , post - shock volume also oscillates which induces a periodic variation of driving force responsible to vertically remove a part of the in falling matter . as the shock reaches its minimum ( fig .",
    "3c ) , the thermal driving of outflow is weak , so the spewed up matter falls back .",
    "the post - shock outflow continues to fall as the shock expands to its maxima ( figs .",
    "3d , e , f ) .",
    "however , as the shock reaches its maximum value the thermal driving also recovers ( fig .",
    "3 g ) . the extra thermal driving plus",
    "the squeeze of the shock front as it shrinks , spews strong outflow ( fig .",
    "3 g ) . in fig .",
    "3f , we have indicated the shock location on the equatorial plane @xmath78 , and the top of the shock front @xmath85 . the position of the shock front can easily be identified from the clustering of the density contours connecting @xmath78 and @xmath85 . from figs .",
    "3(a - h ) , it is clear that the mass outflow rate is significant when @xmath86 .    due to shock transition ,",
    "the post shock matter becomes hot and dense which would essentially be responsible to emit high energy radiation . at the critical viscosity ,",
    "since the shock front exhibits regular oscillation , the inner part of the disc , cenbol , also oscillates indicating the variation of photon flux emanating from the disc .",
    "thus , a correlation between the variation of shock front and emitted radiation seem to be viable .",
    "usually , the bremsstrahlung emission is estimated as , @xmath87 where , @xmath88 and @xmath89 are the radii of interest within which radiation is being computed and @xmath90 is the local temperature . in this work , we calculate the total bremsstrahlung emission for the matter from the cenbol region .",
    "also , we quantify the mass outflow rate calculated assuming an annular cylinder at the injection radius which is concentric with the vertical axis . the thickness of the cylinder is considered to be twice the size of a sph particle .",
    "this ensures at least one sph particle lies within the cylindrical annulus .",
    "we identify particles leaving the computational domain as outflow provided they have positive resultant velocity , @xmath91 and @xmath92 and they lie above the disc height at the injection radius . with this , we estimate the mass outflow rate which is defined as @xmath93 and observe its time evolution . here , @xmath94 .",
    "in figure 4 , we present the variation of shock location , corresponding bremsstrahlung flux from the post - shock region and mass outflow rate with time . here , the radiative flux is plotted in arbitrary unit . assuming a @xmath95 black hole , the overall time evolution of five seconds ( @xmath96 50600 code time ) is shown for representation .",
    "the input parameters are @xmath69 , @xmath48 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath74 respectively .",
    "note that persistent shock oscillation takes place over a large time interval , with the oscillation amplitude @xmath97 .",
    "this phenomenon exhibits the emission of non - steady radiative flux which is nicely accounted as quasi - periodic variation commonly seen in many black hole candidates @xcite .",
    "subsequently , periodic mass ejection also results from the vicinity of the gravitating objects as a consequence of the modulation of the inner part of the disc due to shock oscillation .",
    "to understand the correlation between the shock oscillation and the emitted photon flux from the inner part of the disc , we calculate the fourier spectra of the quasi - periodic variation of the shock front and the power spectra of bremsstrahlung flux for matter resides within the boundary of post - shock region as well as outflow with resultant velocity @xmath98 .",
    "the obtained results are shown in figure 5 , where the _ top panel _ is for shock oscillation , _ middle panel _ is for photon flux variation from post - shock disc and _ bottom panel _ is for photon flux variation of outflowing matter , respectively . here , the input parameters are same as figure 4 .",
    "we find that the quasi - periodic variation of the shock location and the photon fluxes from post - shock disc and outflow are characterized by the fundamental frequency @xmath99 hz which is followed by multiple harmonics .",
    "the first few prominent harmonic frequencies are @xmath100 hz ( @xmath101 ) , @xmath102 hz ( @xmath103 ) and @xmath104 hz ( @xmath105 ) .",

    "interestingly though , viscosity can produce multiple shocks ( for one spatial dimensional results see lee 2011 ) , while no such thing has been reported with cooling processes , albeit investigations with cooling processes have not been done extensively .",

    "<S> earlier , it has been observed that in a significant part of the energy and angular momentum parameter space , rotating transonic accretion flow undergoes shock transition before entering in to the black hole and a part of the post - shock matter is ejected as bipolar outflows , which are supposed to be the precursor of relativistic jets . in this work , </S>",
    "<S> we simulate accretion flows having injection parameters from the inviscid shock parameter space , and study the response of viscosity on them . with the increase of viscosity , </S>",

    "<S> the in falling matter inside the post - shock region exhibits quasi - periodic variations and causes periodic ejection of matter from the inner disc as outflows . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , the same hot and dense post - shock matter emits high energy radiation and the emanating photon flux also modulates quasi - periodically . </S>",
