    "low - power nonlinearities are enabled by the high intensities achieved through compression of the optical mode - area interacting with the rb atoms .",
    "one of the major technical issues in these systems is the accumulation of rb on the waveguide surfaces @xcite",
    ". this can be particularly problematic for the case of tof s , where surface contaminants are known to cause scattering of the guided evanescent mode and , consequently , a degradation of transmission through the fiber @xcite . because high transmission is essential for low - power nonlinear optics applications , the loss due to rb accumulation is currently one of the main limiting factors in these kinds of experiments . in order to move towards more practical systems ,",
    "a better understanding of transmission degradation for tof s in rb vapor is important at the present time .    in this paper",
    ", we describe an experiment which allowed real - time observations of tof transmission degradation as the density of the surrounding rb vapor was increased .",
    "we also show that a heating element used to raise the surface temperature of the tof higher than the surrounding environment can reduce the accumulation of rb atoms , thereby reducing the amount of transmission loss .",
    "our results indicate that it is possible to achieve relatively high tof transmission , even in the presence of the relatively high rb vapor densities needed for many low - power nonlinear optics applications .",
    "this systematic study of the potential effectiveness of tof heating was motivated by the use of basic heating elements in some of the original papers @xcite .",
    "the main results of our study are summarized in fig .",

    "the details of these tof `` heater off '' vs. `` heater on '' measurements will be discussed in the following sections .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organized as follows : in section [ sec : setup ] we describe the design of the tof heating unit and the overall experimental setup , and confirm the system s suitability for low - power nonlinear optics applications by demonstrating rb saturation with nw - level fields @xcite . in section [ sec : results ] we present detailed measurements of transmission degradation and preservation for three different scenarios , and in section [ sec : toffailures ] we briefly describe suspected tof failure mechanisms that prevented indefinite use of the system .",
    "our tof s were produced from standard single - mode fiber using the well - known `` flame - brush '' technique with an air - propane flame @xcite .",
    "the tof s typically had a minimum diameter of roughly 300 nm , and a sub-500 nm diameter over a length of about 5 mm .",
    "the overall transmission of freshly produced tof s was typically in the range of 40 - 70% .",

    "was typically @xmath2 torr after baking out the system .",

    "the ability to saturate the rb vapor at such low powers arises from the reduced optical mode areas in the tof waist region ( on the order of 1 um@xmath15 @xcite ) , and agrees with calculated saturation powers ( on the order of 10 - 100 nw @xcite ) for these kinds tof in rb vapor systems .",
    "we note that our ability to accurately determine the tof powers interacting with the rb vapor was hindered somewhat by non - ideal transmission @xcite of the tof s themselves ( 67% in the present example ) , and simple fiber connector losses in the optical system . to avoid repeatedly disconnecting the fragile bare - fiber adapters ( bfa s , fig .",
    "[ fig : setup ] ) , we measured the overall system transmission by comparing the input powers at the more robust connector fc@xmath16 with the output powers at detector @xmath6 .",

    "this off - resonant tof data provides the best indication of the overall tof transmission vs. time for these runs .    experimentally ensuring approximately the same rb density vs. time profiles enabled a fair comparison between these `` heater off '' vs. `` heater on '' runs .",
    "this was confirmed using the depth of the fsp absorption dips to measure the rapidly changing relative density in the chamber at the beginning of a run ; and the depths of the tof dips once they became apparent after @xmath18 seconds .",
    "because of the difficulties in accurately fitting the absorption profiles of 100% dips @xcite , we simply verified that the optical depths ( od s ) of the smallest tof dip ( dip 4 ) were roughly the same for the latter parts of the runs .",

    "in addition , the temperature of the tof heating unit was raised from the nominal value of 200@xmath4c to 265@xmath4c . as shown in fig .",

    "the ability to indefinitely maintain relatively high overall tof transmission in a standard `` heater on '' run ( such as fig .",

    "subsequent examination of the tof s with visible red - light usually showed large scattering out in the tapered region .",
    "the idea of a fracture is further supported by the fact that a smaller number of the failed runs resulted in the tof being physically broken into two pieces .",
    "we note that these `` fractures '' were also observed while maintaining a tof under vacuum without rb vapor .",
    "it is possible , however , that these rapid transmission drops were due to large contaminant particles `` landing '' on the tof surface .",
    "fujiwara et.al .",
    "have recently shown rapid transmission drops ( albeit not to zero ) due to dust particles @xcite , and similar effects have been seen by placing polystyrene clusters on tof s @xcite .",
    "in contrast , transmission degradation due to rb accumulation in our system ( summarized in fig .",
    "[ fig : mainresults ] ) occurred on a time - scale of several minutes .",
    "we note that similar time - scale transmission degradation was also observed during initial vacuum system bake - outs with the tof heating unit turned off ; presumably water vapor and other contaminants accumulating on the tof surface degraded transmission in a similar manner . from a practical point of view , keeping the tof heating unit turned on at 200@xmath4c entirely eliminated transmission degradation during bake - outs .",
    "similar slow time - scale transmission degradation was also observed when we attempted to raise the tof heating unit temperature above 265@xmath4c .",
    "we suspect outgassing of the epoxy ( and/or other materials ) at these higher temperatures contaminated the tof surfaces .",
    "this effect prevented us from using higher tof temperatures in an attempt to demonstrate preservation of tof transmission at higher rb densities .",
    "transmission loss due to rb accumulation on the surface of a tof is currently one of the main limiting factors in the utility of these systems for low - power nonlinear optics @xcite . in this paper",
    "we have described real - time observations of tof transmission degradation as the density of the surrounding rb vapor was increased . by comparing the case of non - heated tof s with heated tof s , we showed that a heating unit can be effectively used to preserve relatively high tof transmission , while maintaining the relatively high atomic densities needed for many low - power nonlinear optics applications .",
    "we achieved steady - state high tof transmission conditions ( like figs .",
    "[ fig : tof2 ] and [ fig : tof3 ] ) that lasted from several hours to several days in some cases , with suspected spontaneous `` fractures '' of the tof ( like fig .",
    "[ fig : instantbreak ] ) being the primary failure mechanism .",
    "the interaction of rb with silica surfaces is a complex process @xcite . in analogy to heating the windows in rb vapor cell experiments , the basic idea of raising the tof surface temperature higher than the surrounding environment is simply to prevent the initial accumulation of rb on the tapered waist region .",
    "although not as successful , we also found that our tof heater could be used to remove rb once accumulated , resulting in a partial recovery of tof transmission .",
    "the preservation and recovery of tof transmission has also been observed using a ( relatively ) high - power internally guided laser beam @xcite , and the possibility of external liad techniques with tof systems may also be useful @xcite .",
