    "determining the origin of neutrino masses and mixing is one of the major challenges of future research in neutrino physics .",
    "it is well known that the existence of nonzero neutrino masses can be related to the presence of more complicated higgs sector in the standard theory , involving additional higgs fields beyond the single doublet field .",
    "actually , it was realised a long time ago @xcite that a majorana mass term for the left - handed ( lh ) flavour neutrino fields can be generated by @xmath22 invariant yukawa couplings of two lepton doublet fields to a higgs triplet field , carrying two units of the weak hyperchange , @xmath23 .",
    "such a higgs field has an electrically neutral , singly charged and doubly charged components .",
    "the majorana mass term for the active flavour neutrinos arises when the neutral component of the higgs triplet field acquires a nonzero vacuum expectation value ( vev ) , breaking the @xmath22 symmetry .",
    "there are several possible realisations of this scenario .",
    "the realisation in which the global @xmath24 symmetry associated with the conservation of the total lepton charge @xmath25 is broken only spontaneously by the higgs triplet vev @xcite , was ruled out by the lep data on the invisible decay width of the @xmath26-boson .",
    "if , however , the @xmath24 symmetry is broken explicitly in a manner that leads to a nonzero vacuum expectation value of the neutral component of the higgs triplet field ( see , e.g. @xcite ) one obtains a viable model of neutrino mass generation .",
    "this model has been investigated in detail recently @xcite and was shown to have a rich and physically interesting phenomenology owing to the fact that i ) the couplings of the doubly and singly charged higgs fields to the flavour neutrinos and charged leptons are proportional to the elements of the majorana mass matrix of the ( flavour ) neutrinos , @xmath27 , and can be relatively large , and that ii ) the physical doubly charged and singly charged higgs fields , @xmath4 and @xmath28 , can have masses in the range from @xmath29100 gev to @xmath291 tev and thus can , in principle , be produced and observed at lhc .",
    "point i ) implies that the indicated couplings are determined essentially by the elements of the pontecorvo - maki - nakagawa - sakata ( pmns ) neutrino mixing matrix @xcite and by the neutrino masses . in @xcite",
    "it was shown that by studying the decays @xmath2 , @xmath5 , it might be possible to obtain information on the absolute neutrino mass scale , on the type of neutrino mass spectrum ( which can be , e.g. normal hierarchical ( nh ) , inverted hierarchical ( ih ) and quasi - degenerate ( qd ) ) , and on the majorana cp violating phases @xcite present in the neutrino mixing matrix .    in the present article",
    "we investigate the possibility to use the information on the neutrino mass spectrum and the majorana cp violating phases from the measurements of the @xmath30 decay branching ratios , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , in order to obtain predictions for the effective majorana mass in neutrinoless double beta ( @xmath0- ) decay , @xmath1 ( see , e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "our study is motivated by the fact that most probably the searches for the doubly charged scalars @xmath4 and the decays @xmath2 will be carried out at lhc before the next generation of @xmath0-decay experiments will be operative . among the different decay channels",
    "@xmath2 , @xmath5 , the easier to observe are those with two electrons ( positrons ) , two muons ( antimuons ) , or an electron ( positron ) and a muon ( antimuon ) , @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 , in the final state .",
    "if the mass of @xmath4 does not exceed approximately 400 gev , the branching ratios of the @xmath4 decays into @xmath33 , @xmath35 and @xmath34 can be measured at lhc with a few percent error @xcite .",
    "we will show that if the doubly charged higgs bosons @xmath4 will be discovered at lhc and at least the three branching ratios @xmath36 , @xmath11 and @xmath15 will be measured with a sufficient accuracy , one can obtain unique information on the @xmath0-decay effective majorana mass @xmath1 .",
    "this information will be extremely important , in particular , for the upcoming next generation of @xmath0-decay experiments .",
    "in the higgs triplet model  ( htm ) @xcite a @xmath37 complex @xmath38 triplet of higgs scalar fields is added to the standard model ( sm ) lagrangian . in the @xmath39 representation ,",
    "the higgs triplet field has the form : @xmath40 where @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 are neutral , singly charged and doubly charged scalar fields . in the flavour basis",
    "in which the charged lepton mass matrix is diagonal we are going to use throughout this article , a majorana mass term for the lh flavour neutrinos can be generated ( without the introduction of a right - handed neutrino fields ) by the @xmath22 gauge invariant yukawa interaction : @xmath44 here @xmath45 , @xmath46 , are complex yukawa couplings forming a symmetric matrix @xmath47 , @xmath48 is the charge conjugation matrix , @xmath49 is a pauli matrix for @xmath38 indices , and @xmath50 , @xmath51 , is the lh lepton doublet field .",
    "a non - zero triplet vacuum expectation value , @xmath52 , gives rise to a majorana mass matrix @xmath53 for the lh flavour neutrino fields @xmath54 : @xmath55 the requisite @xmath56 arises from the minimisation of the most general @xmath57 invariant higgs potential @xcite : @xmath58 ^ 2 + \\lambda_3\\ , { \\rm det}(\\delta^\\dagger\\delta )   \\nonumber \\\\ & & + \\lambda_4\\,(\\phi^\\dagger\\phi){\\rm tr}(\\delta^\\dagger\\delta ) + \\lambda_5\\,(\\phi^\\dagger\\tau_i\\phi){\\rm tr}(\\delta^\\dagger\\tau_i \\delta ) + \\left ( { 1\\over \\sqrt 2}\\mu\\,(\\phi^ti\\tau_2\\delta^\\dagger\\phi ) + h.c \\right)\\ , , \\label{higgs_potential}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath59 being the sm higgs doublet field . in eq .",

    "the resulting higgs spectrum contains a massless goldstone boson - the triplet scalar majoron , @xmath66 , and another light scalar , @xmath67 .",
    "the decay @xmath68 would give too large a contribution to the invisible decay width of the @xmath26-boson and this model was excluded by the lep data .",
    "the inclusion of the term @xmath69 ) explicitly breaks the lepton number conservation when @xmath70 is assigned two units of the total lepton charge @xmath25 , and therefore avoids the presence of a goldstone boson - the majoron , in the model  @xcite .",

    "the doubly charged higgs field @xmath83 coincides with the triplet scalar field @xmath43 .",
    "the remaining higss mass - eigenstate fields are in general mixtures of the doublet and triplet fields .",
    "the corresponding mixing parameter is proportional to the ratio of triplet and doublet vevs , @xmath84 , and hence is small _ even if _ @xmath71 assumes its largest value of a few gev .",
    "therefore @xmath85 are predominantly composed of the triplet fields , while @xmath86 is predominantly composed of the doublet field and plays the role of the sm higgs boson .",
    "the masses of @xmath87 are of order @xmath88 with splittings of order @xmath89 .",
    "for @xmath90  tev of interest for direct searches for the higgs bosons at the lhc , the couplings @xmath91 are constrained to be @xmath92 or less by a variety of processes such as @xmath93 etc .",

    "these decays are important not only for the searches of @xmath4 , but also because of the very interesting possibility that their lepton flavour dependence can be directly related to the majorana mass matrix of the lh flavour neutrinos .",

    "the decay @xmath97 is forbidden , while the decay @xmath98 is sufficiently strongly suppressed . in this case",
    "the branching ratios of the decays @xmath94 are given by the following simple expressions ( see , e.g. @xcite ) : @xmath99 where @xmath100 is the kronecker delta .",
    "note that the branching ratios depend only on the parameters of neutrino mass matrix .",
    "the measurement of @xmath101 can give significant information on the elements of the neutrino mass matrix @xmath102 , and therefore , e.g. on the absolute neutrino mass scale ( i.e. lightest neutrino mass ) , type of neutrino mass spectrum , majorana cp violating phases in the neutrino mixing matrix , etc .",
