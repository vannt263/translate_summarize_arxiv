    "in 1988 a survey was carried out at the ratan600 in the right ascension range between @xmath3 and @xmath4 at declination 477  of 1   width with the use of the entire ring surface of the radio telescope ( mingaliev et al . , 1991 ) .",
    "a catalog of 70 objects ( @xmath5 sources ) has been compiled at the wavelength of 8.0  cm .",
    "all the detected sources belong to a population of radio sources with flux densities from 14 to 70 mjy .",
    "general statistical investigation , estimation of spectral indices and luminosity calculation ( in the assumption of @xmath61 ) of @xmath5 sources have been reported by verkhodanov ( 1994 ) .",
    "several sources of this survey were studied using new ratan600 observational data obtained by verkhodanov and verkhodanova ( 19971999 ) in 1995 at four wavelengths .    to reveal morphology and select candidates for study with optical telescopes",
    ", one has to investigate the radio structure of the objects . by using morphological properties and selecting frii objects ( fanaroff and riley , 1974 )",
    ", one could extend the lists of the objects being candidates for distant radio galaxies studied in the programme `` big trio '' ( parijskij et al . , 1996 ) .",
    "detection and investigation of this type objects play an important role in the understanding of the origin and evolution of galaxies at early epochs of the universe . by studying faint radio sources that are close doubles ( down to 2 ) we can also select gravitationally lensed candidates which belong to the most interesting objects in the present day astrophysics ( fletcher , 1998 ) .",
    "these objects can be found among radio sources extended but unresolved with a beam of 25 .",
    "[ cols=\"<,^,^,<,<,>,>,^,^ , > \" , ]     @xmath7 dss2 magnitude values + @xmath8 6 m telescope data    two radio sources @xmath2 and @xmath9 were observed with the 6 m telescope in february , 1994 .",
    "three 400@xmath10 ccd frames were acquired for @xmath2 and six 400@xmath10 ones for @xmath9 with a seeing of 31 .",
    "isophotes of the @xmath2 ccd image are shown in fig .",
    "there is an empty field in the zone of @xmath9 in the r band .",
    "the results of identification with the apm catalog and dss and the upper limits estimated with the 6 m telescope data are given in table 3 .",
    "table 3 contains the results of optical identification of the objects with the apm data . in the columns",
    "are listed the object name ( for _ rz5 _ the northern and southern components , and a gravity center by nvss ) , apm coordinates at 2000.0 , the magnitude and object class on the e plate , the magnitude and object class on the o plate ( the class is described in terms of apm , with @xmath11 ( stellar like ) , 0 ( noise like ) and 1 ( extended ) ) , likelihood ratio , calculated by the following formula ( de ruiter et al . , 1977 ) :",
    "@xmath12,\\ ] ] where @xmath13 , @xmath14 is the density of background objects equal to 5.16@xmath010@xmath15 sec@xmath16 ( cohen et al . , 1977 ) ,",
    "@xmath17^{0.5}$ ] , @xmath18 are differences of radio and optical positions , @xmath19 and @xmath20 are root - mean - square errors of the radio and optical coordinates , respectively .",
    "the identification is considered reliable if lr@xmath212 . analyzing the vla maps",
    "( see table 1 ) one can find that all five objects are not point - like .",
    "two objects ( _ rz5 _ and _ rz55 _ ) have distinguished radio components .",
    "identification of the objects with dss and apm shows only 3 radio sources identified with a high probability with the optical objects visible on dss . despite the fact that _ rz5 _ is identified with a red star  like object of 195 , bta observations of 1994 have shown that it is rather an elliptical galaxy .",
    "an averaged 6 m ccd image ( fig . 12 ) of _ rz5 _ shows that merging of galaxies is probably observed in this object .",
    "actually , it is not merging of equal galaxies , but we have a case of `` cannibalism '' , i.e. a giant galaxy `` eats up '' surrounding galaxies of lower mass .",
    "radio emission of this merged group of at least 8 galaxies , with the largest one at the center , may be produced by active processes working during the merging , which may have an explosive character ( kontorovich et al . ,",
    "1992 ) .",
    "the source _ rz9 _ , which is slightly extended at 1400 mhz , is identified with an extended one in optics ( o - plate ) and , may be , with a galaxy or a qso , i.e. a radio core . if the 25-wide tail on the left side of @xmath2 ( fig .",
    "2 ) is not a false structure , then it may be a jet flying out from the core .    the source _ rz14 _",
    ", having an extended but unresolved into components structure and a steep radio spectrum , coincides with a star - like object with a very blue o - e color index , which is most likely a qso ( blue star  like object , bso ) . taking into account that it has an extended structure ( probably two close radio components )",
    "we can suppose it to be a candidate for a gravitationally lensed object ( fletcher , 1998 ) .",
    "the sources _",
    "rz55 _ and _ rz70 _ , showing an extended structure ( although _ rz70 _ is not resolved into components ) and having steep spectra , are not visible on the palomar observatory sky survey plates .",
    "therefore , they may be selected as candidates for distant radio galaxies and objects for further investigation .",
    "vla maps with a resolution of 25@xmath02   for three ratan600 zenith radio sources , _ rz5 _ , _ rz9 _ and _ rz14 _ , and with a resolution of 65@xmath023   for two sources , _ rz55 _ , _ rz70",
