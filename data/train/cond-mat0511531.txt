    "as the temperature is changed , the heat supplied goes partly in changing the temperature of the individual components and also in converting a part of the zipped chain to unzipped , i.e. to change @xmath55 . for the last process",

    "as the phase boundary is approached , @xmath68 approaches @xmath69 smoothly , see eq.([eq:8 ] ) . beyond the phase boundary , it is only the unzipped chain .",
    "therefore , the constant @xmath3 specific heat as a function of @xmath10 shows a _ jump discontinuity _ at the phase transition point though it is a first order transition .",
    "the peculiarity comes from the fact that for the most of the temperature range in the constant distance ensemble , we see phase coexistence , i.e. a y - fork .",
    "if we consider the specific heat at a constant force , then we cross the phase boundary at the transition point only while at all other temperatures we are strictly in one phase .",

    "this divergence of @xmath63 also follows from the thermodynamic relation of the two specific heats , @xmath73 since @xmath62 is finite at all @xmath10 , we see the divergence of @xmath63 at @xmath74 is linked to the divergence of @xmath45 at that point .",
    "a similar analysis can be done for the reentrant part of the phase boundary also .",

    "the @xmath0-dependent phase diagrams can be used to interpret the effect of helicases and other motor proteins on dna which keep the separation between the two strands constant .",
    "they may be classified as fixed - distance objects ( fdo s ) .",
    "take for example dnaa which is known to initiate the replication process .",
    "it generally starts at a point near an end which means @xmath76 .",
    "as it starts moving towards the end , @xmath0 starts increasing and the @xmath0-dependence of the phase boundary of fig .",
    "[ fig : phaseone ] ( eq.([unzippb ] ) ) shows that at some value of @xmath0 for the given @xmath10 , the end points get released .",
    "this is accompanied by a sudden change in the force ( eqs.([pbs]),([pbsb ] ) ) on the fdo and this sudden change can be responsible for its offloading .",
    "similarly , helicases have components to maintain a fixed distance between the two strands to behave as fdo s .",
    "the motor action and any further destabilizing effects ( like force in the case of pcra ) is equivalent to a thermodynamic force on the junction of the two coexisting phases at the y - fork ( `` domain wall '' ) .",
    "the opening of the dna by a helicase can then be interpreted as a motion of the wall or a propagating front through the double stranded dna under a local time - dependent instability .",
    "the velocity of the front ( i.e. opening of the dna ) can be related to the elastic behaviour of the wall@xcite .",
    "let us now discuss the features that one should see if one moves in a closed loop on the phase diagram .",
    "suppose we start with a dna in its zipped phase ( point a in fig .",
    "[ fig : phaseone](a ) ) in the fixed distance ensemble and use a tip ( say of afm ) to increase isothermally the separation between the monomers of two strands at a fraction @xmath77 from the anchored end .",
    "as we move on line ab in the phase diagram , a bubble starts emerging for small @xmath3 .",
    "the size ( i.e. length ) of the bubble grows with separation until we cross the solid curve at b@xmath78 where the free end of the dna gets unzipped into two single strands .",
    "this curve ( for b@xmath78 ) represents the jump from one coexistence region to another with a _ sudden , detectable change in force _ ( eqs.([pbs ] ) and ( [ pbsb ] ) ) .",
    "point b@xmath78 corresponds to the separation @xmath79 of eq.([step ] ) .",
    "once in the unzipped region at point b , we raise the temperature to point c. there is no change in the phase though the elastic response of the unzipped chains will show a @xmath10-dependence . on releasing the tip , i.e. along the path cd",
    ", we first see the formation of a y - fork at c@xmath78 via zipping of the base - pairs _ from the anchored end _ and a sudden change in force will be felt .",
    "this force remains constant until we reach the point d@xmath80 when the free end of the dna zips leading to the formation of a bubble .",
    "the force gets doubled at this point . by a reduction of @xmath10 we",
    "may then close the loop to get back the original state .    a closed loop efgh of fig .",
    "[ fig : phaseone](b ) will show only the zipped and the unzipped phases , with the y - fork appearing at special values of the force and/or temperature .    a similar closed loop cycle may be performed for @xmath81 .",
    "again we start from the zipped phase at a low temperature ( point a in fig .",
    "[ fig : phasetwo](a ) ) and increase the separation between the strands at fraction @xmath43 keeping the temperature constant . for any @xmath3 , we get the `` eye '' with a zipped tail ( `` tadpole '' ) .",
    "this state is characterized by all open bonds at the anchored end and the free end of dna is still in its zipped state .",
    "if the temperature is increased , the eye phase of dna gets denatured at a well defined temperature _ which is below the bulk melting temperature @xmath82_. at c one gets two single strands .",
    "if we decrease @xmath3 at this new temperature ( path cd ) the two strands of dna start feeling each other s presence at c@xmath78 where we cross the solid curve at a ( temperature dependent ) critical separation @xmath79 at which both the ends of the dna get re - zipped and a bubble is formed on the dna . by cooling one gets back into the eye phase .",
    "further decrease of separation brings back the dna to its initial zipped phase .    in the fixed force ensemble , we start from the zipped region at low temperature ( point e ) .",
    "the closed loop efgh takes us from the zipped to the eye ( at f ) , then to the unzipped ( at g ) and then back to the zipped phase ( at h , e ) .",
