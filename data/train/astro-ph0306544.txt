    "the slow neutron capture process ( s - process ) is responsible for about half of the abundances of elements heavier than the iron peak in solar - system material .",
    "the s - process has traditionally been described by two approaches : the schematic classical approach ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and modeling of the s - process in thermally pulsing asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) stars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in the classical approach",
    ", the neutron exposure is estimated from the abundance patterns of pure s - process isotopes in solar - system material , or the elemental abundance patterns in stars enriched in s - process - elements , while the temperature and neutron density during the s - process can be estimated by an analysis of the branchings of the neutron - capture chains where the rates for beta decay and neutron capture are comparable .    for @xmath0sm ,",
    "whose half - life is about 90 years , the @xmath3-decay rate is strongly dependent on temperature , while the neutron capture rate is not .",
    "this makes the @xmath0sm branching an excellent thermometer ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "previously , this branching has been analyzed using the @xmath4gd and @xmath5gd isotope ratios in solar - system material , which are believed to be significantly affected by this branching ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "one difficulty in this approach is that these gd isotopes are affected by a small amount of contamination from the p - process , though they are shielded from the r - process .",
    "hence , an independent observational constraint on the branching is desired .    the eu isotope ratio ( @xmath0eu/@xmath1eu ) is one possible constraint .",
    "more than 90  % of eu in the solar system is provided by r - process nucleosynthesis ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which suggests that it is difficult to constrain the s - process from measurement of the eu isotopes in _ solar - system material_. however , the eu isotope ratios can also be measured in individual stars , as high - resolution spectroscopy can partially resolve the expected hyperfine splitting and isotope shifts .",
    "@xcite and @xcite analyzed the eu isotopes for r - process - element - enhanced stars .",
    "they showed that the isotope ratios derived for a total of four of these objects agree well with that in solar - system material . in this letter",
    ", we apply this analysis to two s - process - element - enhanced , metal - poor stars , and report the first results of our analysis of eu isotopes to analyze the @xmath0sm branching .",
    "we selected two subgiants ( lp  62544 and cs  31062050 ) , which were found to be enriched in s - process - elements in our previous studies @xcite as most suitable for this investigation .",
    "these stars are both very metal - poor ( [ fe / h ] = 2.7 and [ fe / h ] = 2.4 , respectively @xmath6 , and @xmath7 for elements a and b. ] ) and have quite similar atmospheric parameters , as shown in table  [ tab : obs ] .",
    "the observed enhancement of s - process - elements in these stars is believed to be due to nucleosynthesis in extinct agb stars which transfered mass to the surviving luminous companions of the binary systems .",
    "the binarity of these stars is discussed below .",
    "the enhancement of the bulk of the s - process elements in these two stars is also similar ( e.g. , [ ba / fe]@xmath8 ) . one important difference between these two objects is their pb abundance : the pb / ba ratio in cs  31062050 is five times higher than that in lp  62544 . for comparison purposes",
    ", we also selected a very metal - deficient giant , hd  6268 ( [ fe / h ] = 2.5 ) , which exhibits a moderate enhancement of r - process - elements , and has strong eu lines , comparable to those in the two s - process - element - enhanced stars .",
    "the [ ba / eu ] values of lp  62544 and cs  31062050 derived in our previous studies @xcite are 1.09 and 0.46 , respectively .",
    "these are more than 1  dex higher than the value of the r - process component in solar - system material ( @xmath9 , arlandini et al .",
    "1999 ) . while the [ ba / eu ] value of lp  62544 is similar to that of the solar - system s - process component ( @xmath10 ) , the value of cs  31062050 is significantly lower",
    ". however , low [ ba / eu ] values ( @xmath11 ) are predicted by some agb nucleosynthesis models ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) for metal - deficient stars , for which high neutron - exposure is expected due to the high ratios of neutrons per seed nuclei .",
    "indeed , the value of [ ba / eu]@xmath11 is not unusual in carbon - rich , metal - deficient stars like cs  31062050 ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) . to explain these [ ba / eu ] values by contamination from the r - process",
    ", we must assume a very large enhancement of r - process elements ( [ eu / fe]@xmath12 + 1.51.8 ) , similar to that in extremely r - process - enhanced stars , such as cs  31082001 @xcite , which are known to be quite rare .",
    "for these reasons , we assume in the following discussion that the majority of the eu in cs  31062050 , as well as in lp  62544 , originates from the s - process .",
    "the observations we report here were made with the subaru telescope high dispersion spectrograph ( hds ; noguchi et al .",
    "2002 ) in august 2002 .",
    "the wavelength range covered was 3100 - 4700   , with a resolving power @xmath13 .",
    "the total exposure times and signal - to - noise ratios obtained are listed in table  [ tab : obs ] .",
    "the heliocentric radial velocities measured for our spectra are given in table  [ tab : obs ] .",
    "@xcite already reported a variation of radial velocities for lp  62544 , which is confirmed by the present measurement . for cs  31062 - 050 , a change of radial velocity from the previous measurement ( @xmath14  km  s@xmath15 by aoki et al .",
    "2002b ) was also detected .",
    "these results suggest the binarity of these stars , and strongly support the mass - transfer scenario for the enrichment of s - process elements .",
    "we adopted the eu line data , including the hyperfine splitting and isotope shifts , provided by @xcite .",
    "the isotope fractions of @xmath0eu [ fr(@xmath0eu ) = @xmath0eu / ( @xmath0eu + @xmath1eu ) ] were measured by fitting observed spectra with synthetic ones calculated for the eu lines , using the model atmospheres of @xcite and atmospheric parameters derived in the previous studies @xcite .",
    "the macro - turbulent velocity was estimated by fitting a gaussian profile to clean fe and ti lines detected in the same spectrum for each object ( see table  [ tab : obs ] ) .",
    "our careful investigation of the hds instrumental profiles around the eu lines used in the analysis showed that the profile is quite symmetric .",
    "hence , a gaussian profile approximation is sufficient for the analysis of stellar spectra that are further broadened by macro - turbulence .",
    "figure  [ fig : sp ] shows the spectra of the 4205   line in our three program stars . in the calculation of synthetic spectra , blending by other species",
    "is included using the comprehensive line list of @xcite and the ch and cn line lists produced in @xcite .",
    "the dot - dashed lines show the synthetic spectra calculated without the contribution .",
    "the absorption around 4205   is dominated by . in the top panel ,",
    "the line positions of both eu isotopes are shown . since the hyperfine splitting of @xmath0eu is larger than that of @xmath1eu , the asymmetry of the line profile increases with increasing fr(@xmath0eu ) .",
    "our measurements were carried out using the same procedure as was utilized for r - process - enhanced stars in @xcite .",
    "we searched for the isotope fractions that minimize the value of @xmath16 for a given eu abundance .",
    "we estimated the uncertainty of the derived eu isotope fractions and total abundances by considering the range over which the @xmath17 is twice as large as the best - fit case confidence level for 25 degrees of freedom , which is the case of our analysis for eu lines .",
    "we do not , however , insist on the exact value of the confidence level , because the statistical properties are not proven for spectra re - binned to a constant wavelength step ( bonifacio & caffau 2003 ) . ] .",
    "the error in the isotope fraction due to the uncertainty in the total eu abundance was estimated from the range of the isotope fraction allowed within the adopted abundance uncertainty .",
    "we estimated the errors arising from the following factors using the same procedures as in @xcite : ( 1 ) the macro - turbulent velocity ( given in table  [ tab : obs ] ) ; ( 2 ) the continuum - level uncertainty estimates , which are assumed to be 0.5% for hd  6268 and 1% for the other two stars ; and ( 3 ) the wavelength calibration of the spectrum and the eu line position .",
    "the wavelength shift was estimated from the longer wavelength ( redder ) part of the spectral line , which is insensitive to the eu isotope ratio ; the error is typically a few m .",
    "we analyzed three lines at 3819 , 4129 , and 4205   .",
    "table  [ tab : res ] gives the derived @xmath0eu fraction and total error ( @xmath18 ) , estimated from the quadrature sum of the individual errors mentioned above .",
    "the eu ( @xmath0eu + @xmath1eu ) abundance derived from each line is also given in the table .",
    "the 4205   line is most sensitive to the eu isotope fractions",
    ". therefore , the fractions deduced from this line have the smallest uncertainty , even though the strong ch line at 4204.75   affects the bluest part of the line .",
    "the 3819   line is strongest among the three lines .",
    "however , the uncertainty in the derived isotope ratio due to the error in the eu abundance estimation is significant @xcite .",
    "the 4129   line , as for 4205   , has suitable strength for this analysis .",
    "however , our synthetic spectra fail to well reproduce the blue portion ( @xmath12 4129.6   ) of the absorption line in the two carbon - rich stars .",
    "there seems to exist some unidentified absorption lines . excluding the blue wing from the fitting",
    ", we derived the isotope fractions , given in table  [ tab : res ] , for the range of 4129.654129.82   . though the number of data points within this range is sufficient , the results are rather sensitive to the choice of wavelength range used for the analysis .    for these reasons , we prefer to adopt the isotope fractions derived from the 4205   line as the best determination .",
    "we note , for comparison purposes , that the weighted means of the results from all three lines for hd  6268 , lp  62544 , and cs  31062050 are 0.47 , 0.61 , and 0.57 , respectively , which agree well with the results from the 4205   line alone .",
    "the fr(@xmath0eu ) of hd  6268 ( 0.48@xmath19 ) perfectly agrees with that of solar - system material ( 0.478 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , as found in other r - process - element - enhanced stars @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the fr(@xmath0eu ) of the two stars enriched in s - process elements are higher than the solar - system value .",
    "the yields of the s - process nuclides which explain the abundances of pure s - process isotopes in solar - system material have been calculated by @xcite .",
    "the fr(@xmath0eu ) values deduced from their best - fit stellar and classical models are 0.541 and 0.585 , respectively .",
    "the first conclusion of the present investigation is that _ the agreement between these values and those derived from our observations is quite good_.    in order to further investigate what can be learned about the s - process from the measured eu isotopes , we have made an analysis using the thermally pulsed s - process models described in howard et al .",
    "we utilized updated neutron - capture rates ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "in particular , in order to follow the nuclear flow in the sm - eu - gd region , we included the rates for @xmath20eu and @xmath0sm obtained by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the electron - capture rate of @xmath1gd was adopted from @xcite .",
    "we found that the fr(@xmath0eu ) value has almost no dependence on the mean neutron exposure ( @xmath21 ) for a fixed temperature in the range of @xmath22 , which well covers the @xmath21 ( @xmath23  mb@xmath15 ) estimated by @xcite for lp  62544 .",
    "our results are calculated with @xmath24 0.3  mb@xmath15 , which gives a good fit to solar abundances .",
    "figure  [ fig : fr151eu ] shows the fr(@xmath0eu ) values calculated by our model .",
    "they are plotted as a function of neutron density ( @xmath25 ) for four temperatures ( @xmath26 10 , 15 , 20 , and 30  kev ) .",
    "also shown for comparison by the hatched area is the fr(@xmath0eu ) range deduced for the s - process - element - enhanced star lp  62544 . as can be seen in this figure ,",
    "the fr(@xmath0eu ) value is rather sensitive to the ambient temperature and neutron density during the s - process .",
    "the fr(@xmath0eu ) value is maximized in the range of neutron density from @xmath27 5@xmath28 @xmath29 to @xmath30  @xmath31 .",
    "the branching factor at @xmath0sm is given by @xmath32 , where @xmath33 and @xmath34 are the neutron - capture rate and the @xmath3-decay rate , respectively .",
    "in these formulations , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , and @xmath37 are the mean thermal velocity , the maxwellian averaged cross section , and the half - life , respectively . for @xmath38  @xmath31 ,",
    "the branching factor is higher than 0.9 .",
    "this indicates that the nuclear flow bypasses @xmath0eu . in this case , the @xmath0eu abundance is produced by the decay of @xmath0sm after the neutron - capture flow ceases .",
    "as the neutron density increases to @xmath39  @xmath31 , another branching at @xmath1sm becomes important .",
    "since we adopt a much smaller cross section for @xmath1sm than those for @xmath0sm and @xmath1eu , the @xmath1sm abundance relative to @xmath0sm and @xmath1eu _ during _ the neutron capture reactions increases with increasing neutron density .",
    "this results in a decrease of the _ final _ value of fr(@xmath0eu ) with increasing neutron density for @xmath39  @xmath31 , as found in figure  [ fig : fr151eu ] .",
    "a measurement of the cross section for @xmath1sm is thus highly desirable to constrain the high neutron density branching .",
    "in contrast to the high neutron - density conditions , @xmath0sm @xmath3-decay _ during _ the s - process is increasingly important with decreasing neutron density ( @xmath40  @xmath31 ) . for the typical temperature ranges thought to apply in the s - process ( 10 - 30  kev ) , the neutron - capture rate on @xmath0eu is faster than that for @xmath1eu",
    ". therefore , the nuclear flow passes through @xmath0eu rather easily , and creates @xmath1gd via @xmath0eu(@xmath41 , @xmath42 ) @xmath4eu(@xmath43)@xmath4gd(@xmath41 , @xmath42)@xmath1gd . in low neutron - density conditions , the electron - capture on @xmath1gd is comparable with , or faster than , the neutron capture .",
    "this contributes to the production of @xmath1eu and explains the decrease of fr(@xmath0eu ) with decreasing neutron density in the low ( @xmath40 @xmath31 ) range .",
    "this trend appears more clearly for the higher temperature case , because the effect of a higher neutron - capture rate on @xmath0eu relative to that on @xmath1eu is large , while the branching factor decreases with increasing temperature .",
    "the comparison of the calculations with the observational results indicates that s - processes with high neutron density ( @xmath44 ) and low temperature ( @xmath45  kev ) , or those with quite low neutron density ( @xmath46 cm  s@xmath15 ) , are not allowed .",
    "this is a new constraint on s - process nucleosynthesis provided by the eu isotope analysis .",
    "recent models of agb stars show that the abundance patterns of nuclei in branchings are affected by the s - process both during the thermal pulses and between pulses ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the reaction which provides neutron in the former phase is @xmath47ne@xmath48 mg , which produces a neutron density as high as @xmath49@xmath50  @xmath31 . in the interpulse phase",
    ", @xmath51c@xmath52o is assumed to be the neutron source reaction , which leads to a lower neutron density ( @xmath53  @xmath31 ) .",
    "the observational errors of the derived eu isotope fractions are still too large to constrain the contribution of each process to the final abundance patterns produced by nucleosynthesis in agb stars .",
    "however , our analysis shows that eu isotopes can be a new probe to determine the temperature and neutron density in s - process nucleosynthesis .",
    "we note that the fr(@xmath0eu ) values derived by using the previous nuclear data of sm and eu isotopes , in particular the @xmath0sm neutron - capture rate , are significantly lower than the results shown above .",
    "the previous neutron - capture rate recommended by @xcite , e.g. , 2377  mb at 30  kev , is significantly higher than the rate used in the present work ( 1585  mb at 30  kev , best et al .",
    "the high neutron - capture rate causes the nuclear flow to bypass @xmath0eu , and results in lower fr(@xmath0eu ) values by 0.05 - 0.08 .",
    "the low neutron - capture rate is clearly preferable to explain our observational results .",
    "new experiments to determine the neutron capture cross section of @xmath0sm are highly desirable to fix ratios of @xmath0eu/@xmath1eu and also @xmath4gd/@xmath5gd .",
    "it should also be noted that the eu isotope fractions are quite similar between lp  62544 and cs  31062050 , even though their pb / ba abundance ratios are significantly different @xcite .",
    "this observational fact indicates that nuclear flow is very fast , and fr(@xmath0eu ) easily obtains asymptotic values in the sm - eu - gd region , once the flow passes through the @xmath54 neutron magic nuclei .",
    "this situation is quite likely to occur in these very metal - poor stars because of the expected high neutron - to - seed ratio .",
    "however , the pb abundance is very sensitive to the neutron exposure ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) , and large variations of the pb / ba ratio are expected .",
    "similar studies of additional s - process - enhanced stars would be useful to derive more clear conclusions on production of heavy nuclei by the s - process .",
