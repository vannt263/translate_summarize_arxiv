    "the existence of supermassive black holes ( sbhs ) in galactic nuclei has been accepted since the detections in the nearby spiral ngc 4258 @xcite and in our own galaxy @xcite .",
    "compelling cases now exist in three dozen additional galaxies ( see ferrarese & ford 2005 for a review ) , making it possible to investigate the existence of scaling relations linking the sbh mass , @xmath5 , to the overall properties of the host .",
    "indeed , @xmath5 correlates with the blue luminosity @xmath6 of the host bulge @xcite , with the central light concentration @xcite , and with the bulge velocity dispersion @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "because of its tight scatter ( 0.34 dex in @xmath5 ) , the @xmath7 relation is thought to allow us to peer into the mechanisms controlling the joint formation / evolution of sbhs and galaxies .",
    "however , cosmological simulations show that a possibly more fundamental relation should be expected between @xmath5 and the total gravitational mass @xmath8 of the galaxy , or the mass @xmath9 of the dark matter ( dm ) halo ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "indirect observational evidence for such a link has been found in the form of a correlation between the circular velocity @xmath0 of spirals disks ( obtained by either hi or deep optical observations ) and the @xmath1 of their bulge component ( ferrarese 2002 ; baes et al .",
    "2003 ; pizzella et al . 2005 ) :    @xmath10    further exploring the @xmath11 relation is of interest because , by linking galactic components on vastly different scales , the relation is a reflection of the interplay between disks and spheroids during galaxy formation / evolution .",
    "furthermore , if @xmath0 and @xmath1 are used as surrogates for @xmath9 and @xmath5 respectively , equation ( 1 ) implies a strong causal relation between sbhs and dm haloes .",
    "pizzella et al .",
    "( 2005 ) report evidence of a separation in the @xmath11 plane between high and low surface brightness spiral galaxies ( hsb and lsb respectively ) , the latter having distinctly larger @xmath0 at a given @xmath1 compared to the former . based on this ,",
    "the authors argue against the importance of baryonic collapse in shaping the density profiles of dm haloes in lsbs , and suggest that for a given dm halo mass , lsbs might host less massive sbhs than hsbs .",
    "the behaviour of hsbs themselves is somewhat controversial : while pizzella et al .",
    "( 2005 ) find that hsb in the range @xmath12 km s@xmath3 ( corresponding to @xmath13 km s@xmath3 ) follow a linear relation , ferrarese ( 2002 ) and baes et al .",
    "( 2003 ) claim that the relation is mildly non - linear for @xmath14 km s@xmath3 ( @xmath15 km s@xmath3 ) , and breaks down altogether at lower @xmath1 , possibly revealing the inability of the least massive haloes to form central sbhs @xcite    the goal of this paper is to investigate the @xmath11 relation for a combination of lsb and hsb galaxies , with @xmath0 in the critical range @xmath16 km s@xmath3 .",

    "discussion and conclusions can be found in  4",
    ".     fits to each spectrum , overplotted to the real data in the spectral region used to perform the fits .",
    "the narrow emission features present in three of the spectra are artifacts resulting from imperfect sky subtraction , width=321 ]    [ ppxf ]",
    "to compare the behaviour of lsbs and hsbs in the @xmath17 km s@xmath3 range of the @xmath11 relation , we drafted a sample of galaxies with @xmath0 known from published rotation curves , and proceeded to obtain new optical spectra from which to measure @xmath1 .",
    "we targeted 11 lsb galaxies with optical rotation curves from the palunas & williams ( 2000 ) compilation , and seven hsb galaxies with hi rotation curves from the ursa major sample of verheijen ( 2001 ) . besides the need of selecting galaxies visible in",
    "the given observing season , and bright enough to produce spectra with the required signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) , the one essential criterium in our sample selection is that the published rotation curves must be symmetric relative to the galaxy s centre , and reach an asymptotic value at large radii .",
    "details of the sample and observations are given in table 1 .",
    "the lsb galaxies were observed with the vlt / ut4 telescope of the european southern observatory on the nights of 2004 april 20 , 29 and may 6 .",
    "the holographic grism gris_1028z+29 on fors2 was centred on the calcium absorption triplet around 8500 , producing an instrumental broadening @xmath18 km s@xmath3 with the 07 slit .",
    "the seven hsb galaxies were observed with the twin spectrograph at the 3.5 m calar alto telescope , on 2005 , june 6 - 19 .",
    "the t06 grating was used in 1st order , again centred at the ca triplet .",
    "the instrumental broadening was @xmath19 km s@xmath3 for the 12 wide slit .",
    "all spectra were divided into several exposures to ease cosmic ray identification and removal .",
    "standard data reduction was performed with midas , iraf and additional software developed specifically for this project .",
    "after basic data processing ( dark and bias subtraction , flat fielding and trimming ) , atmospheric emission lines were identified and removed through an interpolation scheme , after which the spectra were rectified and wavelength calibrated .",
    "cosmic rays were removed by applying a median filter along the spatial axis .     method .",
    "the vertical dashed lines are drawn at the location of the bulge effective radius , @xmath20.,width=340 ]",
    "deriving accurate kinematical quantities of galaxies is a non - trivial task .",
    "the result of the extraction can vary depending on the applied fitting techniques , the s / n , the template stars , the absorption lines used , etc .",
    "( e.g. , de bruyne et al . 2003 ) . to lower this degree of subjectivity , we derived velocity dispersions using two independent techniques : a direct @xmath21 fit to the spectrum @xcite , and the ppxf algorithm @xcite ( see fig .",
    "[ ppxf ] ) , which is based on a penalized likelihood approach .",
    "velocity dispersions derived using these two methods agree to within 10% ; the final values quoted in table 1 were obtained using the @xmath21 routine . in analyzing the spectra , sky residuals that deviated by more than 3 times the average sigma in the nearby continuum",
    "were rejected ; furthermore , to minimize the effects of template mismatch , six different template stars were used , each with weight calculated by a quadratic fit to the central row of the spectrum . in keeping with previous works , velocity dispersions were extracted from spectra binned , in the spatial direction , out to 1/8th of the bulge effective radius , estimated from the literature in the case of the hsb galaxies @xcite , and from published surface brightness profiles for the palunas & williams ( 2000 ) galaxies . within this radius ,",
    "the effect of a possible contamination by the disk rotational velocity should be negligible .",
    "this was verified by measuring the dispersion profiles along the major axis ( without binning spatially ) ; the velocity dispersion of most galaxies ( see fig .  [ profile ] ) indeed remained nearly constant in the bulge dominated region .",
    "the circular rotational velocities and errors are published by verheijen ( 2001 ) for the hsb galaxies .",
    "these were derived from hi observations and extend beyond the optical radius ( @xmath22 ) , well into the flat part of the curve . for the lsb galaxies",
    ", we measured @xmath0 as the weighted average of the flat part of the optical rotation curve published in palunas & williams ( 2000 ) ; the error on @xmath0 was derived by means of a bootstrap method and reflects any slight asymmetries in the rotation curves .",
    "the optical rotation curves are not as extended as the hi observations of the hsb galaxies , however all rotation curves reach an asymptotic value at large radii . as shown in pizzella et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , when this condition is satisfied , @xmath0 can be extracted reliably ; therefore we do not expect any systematic biases in the @xmath0 measurements between our samples of hsbs and lsbs .",
    "the results of the dynamical analysis are given in table 1 .",
    "the @xmath23 relation for hsb galaxies is plotted in the left panel of fig .",
    "the 11 lsb galaxies studied in this paper populate the region between @xmath24 , where previously only three galaxies could be found .",
    "furthermore , in the same region , we more than double the number of hsb galaxies , from three to eight .",
    "pizzella et al .",
    "( 2005 ) conclude that , relative to the  relation defined by hsb galaxies , lsb galaxies appear to have larger circular velocities , @xmath0 , at any given value of @xmath1 .",
    "this conclusion is reaffermed by our data .",
    "however , with the addition of the present sample , it has now become more evident that there is some overlap in the locations occupied by lsb and hsb galaxies in the  plane . in other words ,",
    "lsb galaxies appear to occupy the _ upper envelope _ of the strip defined by hsb galaxies .",
    "furthermore , at low velocity dispersions @xmath25 , the  relation for both lsb and hsb galaxies appears to be shifted towards larger circular velocities relative to the relation defined by the ( hsb ) galaxies with larger velocity dispersion .    a least - square fit , taking into account the errors on both quantities ( fitexy ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , to the sample of hsbs with @xmath26  gives :    @xmath27    with @xmath28 .",
    "for @xmath29 , on the other hand ,    @xmath30    with @xmath31 for hsb galaxies , and    @xmath32    with @xmath33 for lsb galaxies .    although the uncertainties are large , equations ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) are consistent with each other well within 1@xmath34 , but inconsistent with equation ( 2 ) ( see also right panel of figure  [ vs ] ) .",
    "two interpretations are open at this point .",
    "the samples studied to date are far from complete or homogeneous , and it is conceivable that , as more data are collected , more galaxies will fill the gap between the lsb galaxies , which are mainly found in the low - velocity dispersion region , and the extrapolation to low @xmath1 of equation ( 2 ) , defined mainly by hsb galaxies .",
    "this interpretation allows for the possibility that the log - log  relation , including both hsb and lsb galaxies , is linear , but that its _ scatter _ increases going from large to small velocity dispersions .",
    "alternatively , it is possible that the log - log  relation is not linear , and that indeed its character changes dramatically below @xmath35 km s@xmath3 , as originally suggested by ferrarese ( 2002 ) and baes et al .",
    "( 2003 ) . in either case",
    ", it seems unavoidable to conclude that the efficiency of bulge ( and , perhaps , sbh ) formation , is regulated by intrinsic parameters in addition to the depth of the global potential well .",
    "the implications of these findings for the central sbhs can not be easily quantified .",
    "the @xmath36 relation is not characterised for lsbs , for which no sbh detection has been attempted .",
    "it is also not defined below @xmath37 km s@xmath3 , which corresponds to sbhs too small to be detected given current space or ground - based instrumentation .",
    "we reiterate the conclusion of ferrarese et al .",
    "( 2002 ) and baes et al .",
    "( 2003 ) that the behaviour of the @xmath23 relation at @xmath2 km s@xmath3 might reflect the inability of these galaxies to form a central sbh , as argued on theoretical grounds by , for instance , @xcite .",
    "numerical simulations @xcite predict that the @xmath7 relation originates from the feedback between the central sbh and the progenitor of the hot stellar component at the early stages of the formation of both ; therefore , in low - mass , late - type hsb and lsb galaxies internal factors might lead to the suppression of such feedback , creating a dynamical relation between disk , bulge and sbh which is starkly different from that displayed by more massive systems .",
