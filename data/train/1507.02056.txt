    "the possibility that planck - scale effects might modify the  dispersion relation \" , the on - shell requirement linking energy and momentum of a particle , has attracted quite some interest in the recent quantum - gravity literature ( see , _",
    "e.g. _ , refs .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "motivation for the study of this possibility also comes from the fact that it provides a rare case of conjectured planck - scale feature that could produce effects observable already with presently - available experimental technologies .",
    "these opportunities for testing are not for controlled earth - bound laboratory setups , where the effects would still be too small , but rather they arise in some contexts of astrophysics and cosmology where the ultralarge propagation distances act as amplifier of the minute planck - scale effects  @xcite .",
    "these opportunities from astrophysics and cosmology however also bring about a challenge for theories , since in the relevant quantum - spacetime pictures very little has been so far understood about the interplay between curvature and planck - scale effects .",
    "this is particularly true for cases where the analysis does not allow schematization in terms of a constant spacetime curvature , as it is indeed the case when tests are performed exploiting cosmological distances .",
    "these challenges have been so far mostly postponed , assuming the applicability of an _ ansatz _ , first formulated by jacob and piran @xcite ( also see refs.@xcite ) for this interplay between planck - scale modifications of the dispersion relation and spacetime curvature .    we here propose a general strategy of analysis of the effects of modifications of dispersion relation applicable when a non - constant curvature of spacetime is to be taken into account .",
    "we adopt a phenomenological approach : rather than attempting to establish a specific form of interplay between planck - scale effects and spacetime curvature within one or another quantum - spacetime picture , we use what is presently known about the various possibilities for formalizing a quantum spacetime as guidance for modeling in a very general way the possible forms of this interplay .    of particular interest is the fact that we allow for planck - scale features to be present not only in the dispersion relation but also in the description of translation transformations .",
    "this is important since in some of the most studied quantum spacetimes , such as the ",
    "@xmath0-minkowski noncommutative spacetime  @xcite , dedicated analyses have shown that the planck scale does have this double role , affecting both the dispersion relation and translations .    in this respect",
    "we uncover a particularly significant characterization of the jacob - piran _ ansatz _ : we show that this _ ansatz _ implicitly assumes that translations are unaffected by planck - scale structures . by this",
    "we mean that in particular specializing the jacob - piran _ ansatz _ to the case of constant rate of spacetime expansion ( de sitter spacetime ) one gets a picture that is invariant under ordinarily classical space and time translations .",
    "analyses depicted as full explorations of the implications of modified dispersion relations , which instead rely exclusively on the jacob - piran _ ansatz _ , should be more carefully described as testing the dispersion relation under the restrictive requirement that translations should be unaffected by planck - scale features .",
    "another qualifying aspect of our analysis is that it considers both the case of modifications of the dispersion relation that signal  liv \" ( lorentz invariance violation , _",
    "i.e. _ preferred - frame scenarios ) and the very different case where the modified dispersion relation is implemented within a fully relativistic picture .",
    "this latter possibility of course requires deforming the relativistic laws of transformation among observers in a way suitable for enforcing the modified dispersion relation as an observer - independent law , a possibility that can be formalized in terms of the relativistic theories of type  dsr \" ( doubly - special , or , for some authors , deformed - special , relativity ) , first introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite ( also see refs .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "as well established in the recent literature , the dsr case imposes taking into account of the novel relativistic effect of  relative locality \"  @xcite ( also see refs.@xcite ) . within the scopes of our analysis",
    "this is tedious but straightforward .",
    "however , it should be noted that we here report the most advanced phenomenological analysis to date of the interplay between relative locality and ( non - constant ) spacetime curvature .",
    "most of the issues we are concerned with are already present in the constant - curvature case , as we shall show explicitly . but",
    "extending the analysis to cases with non - constant curvature leads to encounter additional challenges .",
    "the constant - curvature case allows us to analyze most aspects of the problem at hand in terms of pure symmetry considerations .",
    "this is not directly available in cases with non - constant curvature ; however , we recover a role for symmetries also in the case of non - constant curvature by using the fact that locally the symmetries of the constant - curvature case reemerge .",
    "one can in particular describe a finite path within a frw - type spacetime by gluing infinitesimal paths within a suitable series of desitter - type spacetimes , a strategy of analysis we refer to as  thick slicing \" .    while the conceptual significance of our concerns should become clear to our readers very early in the analysis here reported , it is important for us to show that our concerns can also have significant quantitative implications .",
    "it is for this reason that we devote much effort to the illustrative application provided by the description of the path of a particle in a",
    " quantum - frw spacetime \" and the evaluation of travel times from a given source to a given detector .    in light of the conceptual and quantitative complexity of the issues we are dealing with we opt for focusing on the case of a 1 + 1-dimensional spacetime and obtaining results only at leading order in the ultrasmall planck length .",
    "before starting with the main part of our analysis we find convenient to collect in this section some known facts that we shall then use . in the first part of this section we shall review some known facts about classical de sitter spacetime , the ones most relevant for our later discussion of propagation of particles in a quantum spacetime with curvature . in the second part",
    "we remind our readers about the interconnection found in some much - studied quantum spacetimes between planck - scale modifications of the dispersion relation and planck - scale modifications of translation transformations .      in this section",
    "we present a covariant hamiltonian formulation for the motion of a classical point particle in de sitter spacetime .",
    "taking @xmath1 to be respectively the generators of time translations , space translations , and boosts , the algebra of spacetime symmetries for 2d de sitter spacetime can be described in terms of poisson brackets as @xmath2 the spacetime - symmetry generators leave invariant the casimir @xmath3    let us then consider the `` conformal time coordinatization '' with the spatial coordinate @xmath4 the conformal - time coordinate @xmath5 , related to the comoving time @xmath6 by @xmath7 and their canonically conjugate variables @xmath8 : @xmath9 we can represent the symmetry generators ( [ algebrads ] ) in terms of conformal - time coordinates as @xmath10    the invariant @xmath11 , with @xmath12 the mass of the particle , can be taken to describe the particles on - shell relation ( @xmath13 ) , and then can be used as hamiltonian constraint , in the spirit of a  covariant formulation \" of classical mechanics , generating equations of motion in terms of an auxiliary affine parameter , which we denote by @xmath14 . in terms of conformal - time coordinates ( [ representds ] )",
    "the mass - shell relation @xmath13 assumes the `` conformal '' aspect @xmath15 the fact that the poisson brackets between @xmath16 and @xmath1 vanish , implies that @xmath1 are conserved charges , i.e. they are constant along the evolution generated by the hamiltonian @xmath17 , where @xmath18 .",
    "then @xmath1 generate symmetry transformations ( time and space translations and boosts ) on the system by poisson brackets .",
    "one can derive the velocity of particles from the hamiltonian constraint and the poisson brackets  ( [ canphspconf ] ) .",
    "indeed by the chain rule ) and the chain rule that the velocity can be also expressed , after enforcing @xmath13 , as @xmath19 . ] @xmath20 by using eqs .",
    "( [ on - shell - ds ] ) and  ( [ canphspconf ] ) one thus finds the velocity in conformal - time coordinates ( assuming @xmath21 ) @xmath22 notice that in the equivalent description given in terms of the comoving time the velocity is @xmath23      as announced , we shall find that there are important issues at stake particularly in the understanding of how planck - scale effects may affect translation transformations .",
    "it is valuable for us to provide early on in this manuscript some intuition to our readers concerning the reason why these aspects of translation transformations become so significant when spacetime curvature is taken into account , while they are instead largely irrelevant in the minkowski limit",
    ". we shall be satisfied in this subsection with offering only a few remarks and exclusively for the dsr - relativistic case . in the following sections the relevant issues will of course",
    "be analyzed in detail , both for the dsr - relativistic case and the liv case .    in the minkowski limit",
    "the realm of possibilities we could consider is rather tightly constrained by the fact that the characteristic scale of quantum - gravity effects with the dimensions of an inverse - momentum ( which we denote by @xmath24 for dsr ) , is the only scale available for deforming the mass - shell relation .",
    "this in particular implies that at leading order in this deformation scale one can only have two possible new terms , one proportional to the cubic power of energy @xmath25 and one linear in energy and quadratic in momentum @xmath26 , so that @xmath27    it is then easy to see why such modifications of the mass - shell relation have no impact on translation transformations in the minkowski limit : both the correction term @xmath25 and the correction term @xmath26 have vanishing poisson brackets with the generators of translations , which are @xmath28 and @xmath29 themselves , and have vanishing poisson brackets among them in the minkowski limit : @xmath30 so that the modified mass - shell is still invariant under the standard action of space and time translation generators .",
    "as we underlined in the previous subsection , the situation is very different when spacetime is curved : the translation generators no longer have vanishing poisson brackets , as shown by eq .",
    "( [ algebrads ] ) @xmath31    it turns out that in the dsr case and in presence of spacetime curvature , the assumption of undeformed translation transformations is only compatible with the term @xmath32 whereas allowing for the term @xmath25 imposes a rather severe modification of translation transformations .",
    "since the quantum - gravity literature provides no argument favouring the term @xmath32 over the term @xmath25 evidently any systematic study of quantum - gravity modifications of the mass - shell relation should take into account what we here find on the implications of the translation sector .",
    "evidently the general idea of a liv modification of de sitter kinematics could be realized in an infinity of ways : if one allows breaking relativistic symmetries , as is the premise of the liv scenario , the framework is totally unconstrained .",
    "it should be understood that a fully general analysis of the liv scenario is accordingly impossible .",
    "it is nonetheless useful for our purposes to consider at least a few possibilities , also as a way to show that the differences between alternative liv scenarios are not `` merely academic '' but rather have tangible ( potentially observable ) consequences .",
    "this objective is pursued efficiently by taking as starting point for the liv modification the de sitter property coded in ( [ on - shell - ds ] ) and adding a few parametrized terms of liv type : @xmath33\\!\\!. \\end{split } \\label{displivrep}\\ ] ] here @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36  and @xmath37 are different choices of the inverse - momentum scale characterizing the contribution of different liv terms , which differ essentially for their time dependence , while @xmath38 are parameters governing the dependence of these terms on the particle s energy and momentum .",
    "of course , one could add not only other forms of time dependence of the liv terms , but also liv terms of completely different form ( for example involving spatial dependence ) , but these few terms we introduced will suffice for exposing the strength of our concerns .",
    "important for the main objective of this study is the fact that the liv modification coded in ( [ displivrep ] ) is not in general translationally invariant .",
    "one can check by using ( [ algebrads ] ) and ( [ canphspconf ] ) that ( [ displivrep ] ) is invariant under the action of spatial translations @xmath29 , but is not in general invariant under the action of time translations generated by @xmath28 .",
    "the poisson bracket between @xmath28 and @xmath16 is @xmath39 thus , in general , not only ( evidently ) boost symmetry but also ( more implicitly ) time - translational symmetries are broken by a liv scenario . among the liv parameters we introduced only @xmath36",
    "is not present in ( [ joclambda ] ) , meaning that @xmath36 is compatible with translational invariance , while all other parameters ( @xmath34,@xmath35,@xmath37 ) are incompatible with translational invariance .",
    "these differences are particularly striking since from the  liv perspective \" ( the perspective of lorentz invariance violation ) the four parameters @xmath36,@xmath34,@xmath35,@xmath37 should be viewed at exactly the same level , since their lorentz - transformation properties are completely analogous .    as a way to quantify the differences produced by different liv parameters we perform a travel time analysis .",
    "we start by noticing that from the hamiltonian constraint ( [ displivrep ] ) , for massless particles , one gets the velocity ( for @xmath40 ) @xmath41 where we have set the parameters @xmath42 , noticing that for massless particles they can be both reabsorbed in the definition of the parameters @xmath36,@xmath34,@xmath35,@xmath37 .    in looking for the travel time for a particle to go from one observer to another",
    "it is important to notice that the breakdown of ( time ) translational invariance implies that the description of a particle s hamiltonian given in  ( [ displivrep ] ) , and the velocity law  ( [ velocitylivdesitter ] ) , can only hold for one of the two distant observers : if  ( [ displivrep ] ) holds for bob then alice s description is given by the non - trivially translated version of  ( [ displivrep ] ) .",
    "suppose that ( [ displivrep ] ) and ( [ velocitylivdesitter ] ) hold in the frame of bob who is local to a detector , and suppose that this detector reveals two photons , one `` soft '' ( whose energy is small enough that the liv effects are negligible ) and one `` hard '' , emitted simultaneously at a distant source , local to an observer , say alice , at rest relatively to bob ( _ i.e. _ alice and bob are related by a pure translation ) .",
    "the relation between bob and alice s coordinates , connected by a finite desitter - translation , can be derived by exponentiating the action by poisson brackets of the translation generators @xmath43 , eqs .",
    "( [ representds ] ) and  ( [ canphspconf ] ) .",
    "taking bob to be connected to alice by a finite spatial translation followed by a finite time translation , we write symbolically @xmath44 where @xmath45 and @xmath46 are the finite translation parameters , and @xmath47 stands for the action by nested poisson brackets with parameter @xmath48 , the finite action on a coordinate @xmath4 is @xmath49 , where @xmath50 , @xmath51 . in this formalism",

    "( [ trajectorylivdesitter ] ) , and solving for @xmath62 . from  ( [ trajectorylivdesitter ] ) and  ( [ velocitylivdesitter ] ) , and using that @xmath61 , one finds that the hard photon is detected with a delay @xmath63   \\label{delaylivdesitter}\\ ] ] where we called @xmath64 the hard particle s momentum measured by bob , we used eq .",

    "we can express the delay in terms of the redshift of the source ( relative to bob ) @xmath67 : @xmath68 \\label{dslivmain}\\ ] ] where we also expressed the delay in terms of comoving time .",
    "notice that , since @xmath69 , it follows that @xmath70 so that the expression of the delay in conformal and comoving time coincide at the level accurately described by the approximations we are relying on .    the term in the delay ( [ dslivmain ] ) proportional to @xmath36 coincides with the one advocated by jacob and piran in  @xcite .",
    "jacob and piran provided as motivation an intuitive argument in favour of switching on only the @xmath36 parameter in liv phenomenology .",
    "here we exposed the fact that the jacob - piran intuition unknowingly reflected a preference for assuming that the quantum - gravity effects leave translations unaffected .",
    "however , as stressed above , the quantum - gravity literature providing motivation for liv research does not justify the assumption that quantum - gravity effects should leave translations unaffected .",
    "this makes us particularly concerned for the fact that limits claiming general applicability to liv scenarios have been presented in the literature @xcite , even though they were based exclusively on the jacob - piran _ ansatz_. the observations reported in this section , strengthened by what we shall find in the following sections , show instead that those limits only apply to a particular case of liv",
    ". they should be viewed as  conditional limits \" , the condition being indeed that translations are unaffected by the quantum - gravity effects producing the breakdown of lorentz invariance .    in closing this section",
    "we offer one more remark that can provide some intuition for the significance of our concerns , a remark which applies to the description of the equations of motion .",
    "for this we consider a third observer bob@xmath71 , at rest relatively to alice and bob , whose origin is along the soft photon worldline connecting alice and bob , at some point between alice and bob , a point which is at ( comoving ) time @xmath72 from the origin of the reference frame of bob .",
    "the coordinates of bob@xmath71 will be related to the ones of bob by expression  ( [ transcoord - ds ] ) replacing the coordinates of alice with the ones of bob@xmath71 and replacing @xmath45 with @xmath72 .",
    "then , from  ( [ transcoord - ds ] ) and ( [ velocitylivdesitter ] ) , it follows that bob@xmath71 describes the photons traveling with velocity @xmath73 here it is particularly important to notice that the only term which maintains the same form of  ( [ velocitylivdesitter ] ) is the one proportional to @xmath36 , which indeed corresponds to the translational invariant term in the hamiltonian  ( [ displivrep ] ) .",
    "in the dsr approach , the ( inverse - momentum ) scale @xmath24 at which the dispersion relation is modified is a relativistic invariant ( it plays a role completely analogous to the role of @xmath74 , the velocity of light , in ordinary special relativity ) .",
    "this requirement enforces the ( @xmath24-deformed ) dispersion relation to be expressible as a combination of only the ( charges ) generators of the relativistic symmetries ; in fact , it must be a casimir of an algebra of charges / generators . as first observed in ref .",
    "@xcite ( also see refs .",
    "@xcite ) , the relativistic invariance of a modified dispersion relation requires that the algebra of relativistic - symmetry generators must also be deformed by the scale @xmath24 .    in light of these considerations ,",
    "it is preferable , for the purposes of the dsr analysis , to start from a modification , rather then of the dispersion relation  ( [ on - shell - ds ] ) , of the casimir equation ( [ casimirds ] ) .",
    "the motion of particles is then generated by the deformed hamiltonian constraint @xmath11 .",
    "we take the following deformation , one should get the velocity @xmath75 .",
    "we also do not make room for deformation terms proportional to @xmath76 , since our flat - limit requirements would only allow such terms to be of the type @xmath77 or @xmath78 , producing negligibly small effects .",
    "in general we should proceed with full awareness of the smallness of both @xmath24 and @xmath79 , so among possible terms going with @xmath80 we shall only keep track of those involving @xmath81 or @xmath82 , _ i.e. _ cases where the cosmological travel times and travel distances here of interest can compensate for the smallness of @xmath80 . ]",

    "@xcite , and reproduces the results of ref .",
    "@xcite for @xmath86 .",
    "notice that , as stressed already earlier in this manuscript , the deformation term going like @xmath87 does not require a modification of translation transformations while for the deformation term going like @xmath88 a modification of translation transformations is required .",
    "this is particularly clearly by looking at eqs.([casimirdsr - ds])-([algebradsr - ds ] ) : the parameter @xmath89 of the term going like @xmath88 has implications not only for transformations involving boosts ( @xmath89 affects @xmath90 and @xmath91 ) but also for transformations involving exclusively translations ( @xmath89 also affects @xmath92 ) , whereas the parameter @xmath93 of the term going like @xmath87 does not affect @xmath92 .    to study the motion of particles , we want to express the deformed hamiltonian @xmath11 in terms of a set of spacetime coordinates and conjugate momenta , and derive the particles velocity in terms of these coordinates , as done in subsec .",
    "[ sec : desitter ] and sec.[sec : livdesitter ] . at this stage",
    "one must expect a crucial difference with respect to the liv case , a feature known in the literature as  relative locality \"  @xcite ( also see refs.@xcite .",
    "this is another consequence of the fact that , in the dsr case , the algebra of the generators of spacetime relativistic - symmetry transformations is deformed by the inverse - momentum scale @xmath24 : the result is that the action of the whole set of the symmetry generators on spacetime coordinates must be necessarily momentum - dependent , leading to the presence of momentum - dependent misleading inferences for the description by a given observer of events occurring at a from that observer ( large distance from the origin of the reference frame of that observer ) .",
    "this core feature of  relative locality \"  @xcite is usually rather surprising for newcomers , but actually it can be easily understood via an analogy with the one case of deformation of relativistic symmetries we all know , the one of the deformation from galileian to special - relativistic symmetries : according to the mindset of a galileian - era physicist the special - relativistic transformations introduce misleading inferences concerning the simultaneity of events , misleading inferences of increasing severity when the compared notions of simultaneity concern observers connected by a .",
    "we shall deal with these challenges drawing from previous results on relative locality , but we shall at the same time provide sufficient details for a self - contained description of the relative - locality effects .",

    "much insight on the differences between the liv  and the dsr  scenarios will be here provided by contrasting these two cases with the same hamiltonian constraint .",
    "we shall see that + @xmath99 even when they rely on the same hamiltonian constraint a liv and a dsr scenario do not in general lead to the same predictions , + @xmath99 and in particular even a case where the hamiltonian constrain requires nothing new of translation transformations in the liv scenario can require in the dsr scenario a deformation of translation - symmetry transformations .",
    "this last point is already evident in ( [ repdsr - ds ] ) which shows how the representation of ( time-)translation generators depends in the dsr case on the parameters @xmath89 and @xmath100 , through the combination @xmath101 .",

    "our research work was motivated by the fact that there are at this point literally hundreds of publications on applications of planck - scale - modified dispersion relations in contexts involving frw expansion , but all these studies have an exclusively heuristic basis . over the last decade",
    "significant progress was made on the understanding of planck - scale - modified dispersion relations in the flat - spacetime limit and we now do have a partial but satisfactory understanding of the generalization to the case of expansion at constant rate , but for frw expansion before our investigations we only had heuristic analyses and very limited understanding of the conceptual issues at stake .",
    "we feel we here provided a significant step forward toward raising the standards of this phenomenology . of particular significance",
    "is the understanding that the much - used jacob - piran _ ansatz _ implicitly assumes that spacetime translations are unaffected by the quantum - gravity scenario , and therefore that _ ansatz _ is applicable exclusively to a corresponding subset of possible quantum - gravity scenarios .",
    "we obtained predictions for both the liv case and the dsr case applicable when instead quantum gravity affects spacetime translations , thereby finally providing a target for those interested in testing planck - scale modifications of the dispersion relation in full generality .",
    "for some of our results an important role was played by our setup describing frw expansion as a series of stages of de - sitter expansion , with appropriate conditions for gluing the different  thick slices \" .",
    "this provided a safe path for generalizing to the case of frw expansion the results recently obtained for de - sitter expansion . while quantum - gravity research is certainly full of surprises , we can not imagine any quantum - gravity picture that would prevent one from describing frw expansion as a series of de - sitter expansions , and indeed to our knowledge there is no quantum - gravity result in the literature that would suggest this could be prevented .",
