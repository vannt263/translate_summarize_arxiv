    "consider the set @xmath1 of all nonnegative real functions @xmath2 with integral 1 , supported on the interval @xmath3 $ ] .",
    "what is the minimal possible value for the supremum of the autoconvolution @xmath4 ?",
    "this question ( or equivalent formulations of it ) has been studied in several papers recently @xcite , and is motivated by its discrete analogue , the study of the maximal possible cardinality of @xmath5-sidon sets ( or @xmath0 $ ] sets ) in @xmath6 .",
    "the connection between @xmath0 $ ] sets and autoconvolutions is described ( besides several additional results ) in @xcite .    if we define the autoconvolution of @xmath2 as @xmath7 we are interested in @xmath8 where the infimum is taken over all functions @xmath2 satisfying the above restrictions .",
    "this short note gives two contributions to the subject .",
    "on the one hand , in section [ improvedbound ] we improve the best known lower bound on @xmath9 .",
    "this is achieved by following the ideas of yu @xcite , and martin & obryant @xcite , and improving them in two minor aspects . on the other hand ,",
    "maybe more interestingly , section [ examples ] provides counterexamples to a long - standing natural conjecture of schinzel and schmidt @xcite concerning the extremal function for such autoconvolutions . in some sense these examples open up the subject considerably : at this point we do not have any natural conjectures for the exact value of @xmath9 or any extremal functions where this value could be attained . upon numerical evidence",
    "we are inclined to believe that @xmath10 , unless there exists some hidden `` magical '' number theoretical construction yielding a much smaller value ( the possibility of which is by no means excluded ) .    in short",
    ", we will prove @xmath11 which improves the best lower and upper bounds that were known for @xmath9 .",
    "throughout the paper we will use the following notation ( mostly borrowed from @xcite ) .",
    "let @xmath1 denote the set of nonnegative real functions @xmath2 supported in @xmath12 $ ] such that @xmath13 .",
    "we define the autoconvolution of @xmath2 , @xmath14 and its autocorrelation , @xmath15 .",
    "we are interested in @xmath16 .",
    "we remark here that the value of @xmath9 does not change if one considers nonnegative step functions in @xmath1 only .",
    "this is proved in theorem 1 in @xcite .",
    "therefore the reader may assume that @xmath2 is square integrable whenever this is needed .",
    "we will need a parameter @xmath17 and use the notation @xmath18 , and @xmath19 for any function @xmath5 .",
    "we will also use fourier coefficients of period 1 , i.e. @xmath20 for any function @xmath5 .",
    "we will need a nonnegative kernel function @xmath21 supported in @xmath22 $ ] with @xmath23 .",
    "we will also need that @xmath24 for every integer @xmath25 .",
    "we are quite convinced that the choice of @xmath21 in @xcite is optimal , and we will not change it ( see equation below ) .",
    "we will follow the steps of @xcite ( which , in turn , is based on @xcite ) .",
    "we include here all the ingredients for convenience ( the proofs can be found in @xcite ) .",
    "[ lemma1][lemmas 3.1 , 3.2 , 3.3 , 3.4 in @xcite ] with the notation @xmath26 as described above , we have    @xmath27    @xmath28    @xmath29    let @xmath30 be an even , real - valued , @xmath31-periodic function that takes positive values on @xmath12 $ ] , and satisfies @xmath32",
    ". then @xmath33    the paper @xcite uses the parameter @xmath34 ( thus @xmath35 ) , and the kernel function @xmath36 ( note here that @xmath37 ) .",
    "finally , in equation they use one of selberg s functions , @xmath38 defined in lemma 2.3 of @xcite .",
    "combining the statements of lemma [ lemma1 ] above they obtain @xmath39 and substituting the values and estimates they have for @xmath31 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 the bound @xmath44 follows .",
    "our improvement of the lower bound on @xmath45 comes in two steps .",
    "first , we find a better kernel function @xmath30 in equation .",
    "this is indeed plausible because selberg s functions @xmath46 do not correspond to the specific choice of @xmath21 in @xcite in any way , therefore we can expect an improvement by choosing @xmath30 so as to minimize the sum @xmath47 , while keeping @xmath48 .",
    "next , we observe that if @xmath45 is small then the first fourier coefficient of @xmath2 must also be small in absolute value , and we use this information to get a slight further improvement .",
    "we will also indicate how the method could yield further improvements .",
    "[ main ] if @xmath49\\to { \\ensuremath{\\mathbb{r}}}_+$ ] is a nonnegative function with @xmath50 , then @xmath51 .",
    "let @xmath52 be defined by .",
    "as in @xcite we make use of the facts that @xmath53 , and @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the bessel @xmath56-function of order 0 .    as described above , the main improvement comes from finding a better kernel function @xmath30 in equation .",
    "indeed , if we set @xmath57 , then @xmath58 for @xmath59 ( @xmath60 ) , and thus equation takes the form @xmath61 for brevity of notation let us introduce the `` gain - parameter '' @xmath62 .",
    "we note for the record that @xmath63 for the choices @xmath34 and @xmath64 in @xcite . for any fixed @xmath65",
    "we are therefore led to the problem of maximizing @xmath66 ( while we may as well assume that @xmath48 , as @xmath30 can be multiplied by any constant without changing the gain @xmath66 ) .",
    "this problem seems hopeless to solve analytically , but one can perform a numerical search using e.g. the `` mathematica 6 '' software . having done so , we obtained that for @xmath67 and @xmath68 there exists a function @xmath69 with the desired properties such that @xmath70 .",
    "the coefficients @xmath71 of @xmath69 are given in the appendix .",
    "therefore , using this function @xmath69 and @xmath67 in equation we obtain @xmath72    * remark .",
    "* one can wonder how much further improvement could be possible by choosing the optimal @xmath65 and the optimal @xmath69 corresponding to it .",
    "the answer is that there is _ very little _",
    "room left for further improvement , the theoretical limit of the argument being somewhere around @xmath73 . to see this ,",
    "let @xmath74 denote the symmetrization of @xmath2 , let @xmath75 ( where @xmath76 is defined in ) and reformulate equation as follows : @xmath77 this equality is easy to see using parseval and the fact that @xmath78 .",
    "now , with @xmath79 being given , the best lower bound we can possibly hope to obtain for the right hand side is @xmath80 , where the infimum is taken over all nonnegative , symmetric functions @xmath81 with integral 1 . to calculate this infimum",
    ", one can discretize the problem , i. e. approximate @xmath79 and @xmath82 by step functions , the heights of the steps of @xmath81 being parameters .",
    "then one can minimize the arising multivariate quadratic polynomial by computer . finally , we can use equations , and to obtain a lower bound for @xmath83 .",
    "we have done this for several values of @xmath65 and it seems that best lower bound is achieved for @xmath84 where we obtain @xmath85 .",
    "we remark that all this could be done rigorously , but one needs to control the error arising from the discretization , and the sheer documentation of it is simply not worth the effort , in view of the minimal gain .",
    "we can further improve the obtained result a little bit by exploiting some information on the fourier coefficients of @xmath2 .",
    "for this we need two easy lemmas .",
    "[ lemma2b ] using the notation @xmath86 and @xmath87 , where @xmath21 is defined by equation , we have @xmath88    this is an obvious modification of lemma 3.2 in @xcite .",
    "namely , @xmath89",
    "@xmath90    the next observation is that @xmath91 must be quite small if @xmath83 is small .",
    "this is established by an application of the following general fact ( the discrete version of which is contained in @xcite ) .",
    "[ lemmah ] if @xmath92 is a nonnegative function with @xmath93 , supported on the interval @xmath94 $ ] and bounded above by @xmath95 , then @xmath96 .",
    "observe first that @xmath97 and with a suitable choice of @xmath98 , the last integral , @xmath99 , becomes real and nonnegative .",
    "taking absolute values we get @xmath100 the lemma becomes obvious now , because in order to maximize this integral , @xmath101 needs to be concentrated on the largest values of the cosine function , so @xmath102    it is now easy to conclude the proof of theorem [ main ] .",
    "assume @xmath103 .",
    "by lemma [ lemmah ] we conclude that @xmath104    however , using lemma [ lemma2b ] instead of equation we can replace equation by @xmath105 substituting @xmath67 , @xmath106 and @xmath107 we obtain a lower bound on @xmath45 as a function of @xmath91 .",
    "this function @xmath108 is monotonically decreasing in the interval @xmath109 $ ] therefore the smallest possible value for @xmath45 is attained when we put @xmath110 . in that case",
    "we get @xmath111 , which concludes the proof of the theorem",
    ".    * remark .",
    "* in principle , the argument above could be improved in several ways .",
    "first , lemma [ lemmah ] does not exploit the fact that @xmath112 is an autoconvolution .",
    "it is possible that a much better upper bound on @xmath113 can be given in terms of @xmath95 if we exploit that @xmath114 .",
    "second , for any value of @xmath115 and any suitable kernel functions @xmath21 and @xmath30 we obtain a lower bound , @xmath108 , for @xmath45 as a function of @xmath91 .",
    "a bound @xmath116 will follow if @xmath91 does not fall into the `` forbidden set '' @xmath117 . in the argument above we put @xmath118 and , with our specific choices of @xmath65 , @xmath21 and @xmath30 , the forbidden set was the interval @xmath119 , and we could prove that @xmath91 must be outside this set .",
    "however , when altering the choices of @xmath65 , @xmath21 and @xmath30 the forbidden set @xmath120 also changes . in principle it could be possible that two such sets @xmath121 and @xmath122 are disjoint , in which case the bound @xmath116 follows automatically .",
    "third , it is possible to pull out further fourier coefficients from the parseval sum in lemma [ lemma2b ] , and analyze the arising functions @xmath123 .",
    "some papers in the literature conjectured that @xmath124 , with the extremal function being @xmath125 note that @xmath126 in particular , the last remark of @xcite seems to be the first instance where @xmath127 is suggested as the extremal value , while the recent paper @xcite includes this conjecture explicitly as conjecture 5.1 . in this section",
    "we disprove this conjecture by means of specific examples . the down side of such examples , however , is that we do not arrive at any reasonable new conjecture for the true value of @xmath9 or the extremal function where it is attained .",
    "the results of this section are produced by computer search and we do not consider them deep mathematical achievements .",
    "however , we believe that they are important contributions to the subject , mostly because they can save considerable time and effort in the future to be devoted to the proof of a natural conjecture which is in fact false .",
    "we also emphasize here that although we disprove the conjectures made in @xcite and in @xcite , this does not reduce the value of the main results of those papers in any way .",
    "the counterexamples are produced by a computer search .",
    "this is most conveniently carried out in the discretized version of the problem .",
    "that is , we take an integer @xmath128 and consider only nonnegative step functions which take constant values @xmath71 on the intervals @xmath129 for @xmath130 .",
    "this is equivalent to considering all the nonzero polynomials @xmath131 with nonnegative coefficients such that @xmath132 and their squares @xmath133 , and asking for the infimum of the maximum of the @xmath134 s .",
    "schinzel and schmidt proved @xcite that this value is @xmath135 and its limit when @xmath136 is @xmath9 .",
    "our constant @xmath9 can also be defined as @xmath137 where @xmath138 is the set of all nonnegative real functions @xmath5 , not identically @xmath139 , supported on the interval @xmath140 $ ] .",
    "the same thing happens in the discrete version .",
    "we can consider the set @xmath141 of all nonzero polynomials of degree @xmath142 with nonnegative real coefficients @xmath143 and their squares @xmath144 and ask for the value of @xmath145 and we will obtain the same value @xmath9 as before .",
    "although our examples will be `` normalized '' in order to fit the first definitions ( i.e. all integrals will be normalized to 1 , and all sums will be normalized to @xmath146 ) , most of the computations we have been carried out using these other ones ( which are more convenient and closer to the ones given by schinzel and schmidt ) .",
    "this note also justifies the fact that it is not a problem if we have an integral which is not exactly equal to 1 or a sum of coefficients in a polynomial which is not exactly equal to @xmath146 because of small numerical errors .",
    "while we can only search for _ local _ minima numerically , using the `` mathematica 6 '' software we have been able to find examples of step functions with @xmath147 , much lower than @xmath127 .",
    "subsequently , better examples were produced with the loqo solver ( student version for linux and on the neos server ) , reaching the value @xmath148 .",
    "the best example we are currently aware of has been produced by an iterative algorithm designed by m. n. kolountzakis and the first author .",
    "the idea is as follows : take any step function @xmath149 as a starting point , normalized so that @xmath150 . by means of linear programming",
    "it is easy ( and quick ) to find the step function @xmath151 which maximizes @xmath152 while keeping @xmath153 ( obviously , @xmath154 because the choice @xmath155 is legitimate ) .",
    "we then re - normalize @xmath156 as @xmath157 .",
    "then @xmath158 by construction .",
    "if the inequality is strict then it is easy to see that for small @xmath159 the function @xmath160 will be better than our original @xmath2 , i. e. @xmath161 .",
    "and we iterate this procedure until a fix - point function is reached .",
    "the best example produced by this method is included in the appendix , achieving the value @xmath162 .",
    "figure  [ fig : step ] shows a plot of the autoconvolution of this function .",
    "interestingly , it seems that the smallest value of @xmath128 for which a counterexample exists is as low as @xmath163 , giving the value @xmath164 we include the coefficients of one of these polynomials here , as it is fairly easy to check even by hand :",

    "we have looked at the plot of many step functions @xmath2 with integral 1 and @xmath165 and several different patterns seem to arise , none of which corresponds to an easily identifiable function .",
    "looking at one particular pattern we have been able to produce an analytic formula for a function @xmath2 which gives a value for @xmath166 , comfortably smaller than @xmath127 but which is somewhat far from the minimal value we have achieved with step functions .",

    "we have not made extensive efforts to maximize the value of @xmath173 in our numerical search . in the appendix",
    "we include one example of a step function with @xmath174 where @xmath175    we make a last remark here that could be of interest .",
    "it is somewhat natural to believe that the minimal possible value of @xmath176 does not change if we allow @xmath2 to take negative values ( but keeping @xmath50 ) .",
    "however , this does not seem to be the case .",
