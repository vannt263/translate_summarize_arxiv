    "the outermost electronic configuration of the rare - earth ( re ) elements plays a decisive role in determining their properties .",
    "these elements are known to be highly electropositive and to exist , predominatly , in the trivalent re@xmath9 form.@xcite moreover , re@xmath4 ions have inner @xmath10 electrons that are efficiently shielded by the outermost , and completely filled , @xmath11 and @xmath12 shells . as a consequence , electronic transitions involving the @xmath13",
    "orbital usually give rise to narrow and well defined signals that are not , or only weakly , influenced by the local re@xmath9 environment .",
    "anticipating the advantages of these attributes , much of the current interest in studying re - doped silicon - based compounds arises from their potential to combine some of the unique characteristics of re@xmath9 ions with the electrical properties of semiconductor hosts.@xcite presently , and despite the great advances achieved in the field of re - doped semiconductor compounds , the topic is still open with lots of challenging questions.@xcite @xcite specifically related to the magnetic properties of these compounds , studies on er - implanted crystalline silicon have concluded that the esr signal associated with the er@xmath4 ions is absent in samples with no oxygen , which is believed to stabilize sites for the ions.@xcite also , the co - doping with oxygen ( or other light impurities ) considerably improves the er - related luminescence signal.@xcite similar research have been conducted on er - doped hydrogenated amorphous si - o films and indicated that the photoluminescence intensity depends on the density of neutral si dangling bonds ( d@xmath5).@xcite    based on the above scenario , this work presents a systematic study on the magnetic properties of amorphous silicon ( @xmath0-si ) films doped with different re ( y , la , gd , er , and lu ) elements .",
    "the samples were prepared by the co - sputtering technique because of its versatility in producing films with quite different , and controllable , atomic compositions . for comparison hydrogenated @xmath0-si films doped with re were also analyzed .",
    "complementary spectroscopic techniques and @xmath3-induced crystallized films were also used in order to achieve further insight .",
    "this work sumarizes and presents part of the data taken from more than 60 films .",
    "all films were prepared in a high vacuum chamber ( base pressure @xmath14 x10@xmath15 torr ) , by radio frequency ( @xmath16 mhz ) sputtering a si ( @xmath17 % ) target covered at random with small pieces of metallic re ( @xmath18 % ) elements .",
    "polished crystalline ( @xmath19-)si wafers and high - purity quartz plates were used as substrates in every deposition run . during deposition ,",

    "the @xmath1-magnetization measurements were accomplished in the @xmath42 k @xmath35-range using  a @xmath43 @xmath44 squid magnetometer ( rso mode , @xmath45 t ) .",
    "in addition to the rbs data , the concentration of the magnetic re species was also determined from the esr and @xmath1-susceptibility data , @xmath46(@xmath35 ) . in the former ,",
    "[ re ] has been obtained after comparison with a gd@xmath47ce@xmath48rusr@xmath24cu@xmath24o@xmath49 and a strong kcl - pitch standard samples and in the latter , following a fitting of the low-@xmath35 @xmath1-susceptibility data to a _ curie - weiss _ law , @xmath50 , after subtraction the diamagnetism of a similar undoped thin film / substrate system .",
    "table i displays p(h@xmath24 ) , a@xmath25/a@xmath26 , and the atomic concentration [ re ] ( as determined from rbs , nra , esr , and @xmath51(@xmath35 ) data ) of some of the films investigated in this work . for simplicity @xmath3-crystallized silicon ( @xmath52-si ) films are not included in this table . notice that in spite of the quite different methods employed to determine [ re ] we always found [ re ] @xmath53 a@xmath25/a@xmath26 .",
    "nevertheless , considerable deviations occur for films deposited in a ar + h@xmath24 atmosphere .",

    "table i shows that , within the experimental error , the magnetic re contents estimated from esr and @xmath46(@xmath35 ) measurements agree with those obtained from rbs , indicating that most of the re species are indeed incorporated into the @xmath0-si(:h ) films in the re@xmath4  form . for the gd@xmath4 and",

    "the fitting of the @xmath51(@xmath35 ) data to a @xmath55 law shows that the obtained paramagnetic temperature , @xmath56 , of the gd - doped @xmath0-si(:h ) _  _ films is negative and larger for films of higher gd concentration , indicating the existence of an afm exchange - like interaction between the gd@xmath9 spins ( see table i ) .",
    "@xcite the same behaviour was observed in the gd@xmath4-doped @xmath52-si films and , also , @xmath56 was larger for the @xmath52-si than for the corresponding pure @xmath0-si film ( not shown ) .",
    "figure @xmath45 shows @xmath51(@xmath35 ) for the undoped films studied in this work .",
    "according to these data both the @xmath0-si and the @xmath52-si exhibit a low_-_@xmath57 _  _ paramagnetic behaviour , while the @xmath0-si : h film is diamagnetic .",
    "this is understood based on the nature of the defects present in these films : @xmath58 non - hydrogenated @xmath0-si and @xmath52-si films are known to have , respectively @xmath59 and @xmath60 spins/@xmath61 , a relatively high density of paramagnetic centers due to singly occupied dangling bond states , d@xmath5 , @xcite and @xmath62 hydrogenated @xmath0-si films , on the contrary , exhibit a high density of diamagnetic dangling bonds ( either d@xmath63 or d@xmath64 states ) .",
    "this interpretation is consistent with the transport properties of the @xmath0-si and @xmath0-si : h films.@xcite the difference in the density of paramagnetic states is evident in the inset of fig .",
    "1 that shows the esr signal of the films being considered .",
    "the esr signal of a quartz substrate is also shown for comparison .",
    "the esr line width of the d@xmath5 signal ( @xmath65 ) in the @xmath0-si and @xmath52-si films was measured as a function of @xmath35 and the results are displayed in figure @xmath66 . as compared to the @xmath52-si films , @xmath65 in the @xmath0-si film presents larger residual width and larger thermal broadening .",
    "the larger residual width  may be due to an inhomogeneous broadening and the larger thermal broadening to a stronger spin - lattice coupling ( shorter spin - lattice relaxation time , @xmath67 ) , and both caused by the larger disorder in the @xmath0-si films . at the lowest temperature , a small but detectable line broadening is observed in the @xmath52-si film which is probably associated with short - range magnetic correlations .",
    "the intensity of these signals increases at low-@xmath35 and follows approximately a @xmath68 behaviour which is the typical behaviour of localized spins ( see inset of figure @xmath66 ) . within the accuracy of our measurements , the @xmath69-values are @xmath35-independent .",
    "figure @xmath70 shows the d@xmath5 esr signal of non - hydrogenated @xmath0-si films doped with magnetic ( gd@xmath4 and er@xmath4 ) and non - magnetic ( y@xmath4 , la@xmath9 , and lu@xmath4 ) re elements ( [ re ] @xmath71 at.% ) . the esr signal of a quartz substrate , @xmath0-si , @xmath52-si , and @xmath0-si : h films are also shown for comparison .",
    "according to these data re - doping reduces the esr signal intensity of d@xmath5 states and the reduction produced by gd@xmath4 and er@xmath9 is remarkably greater than that caused by y@xmath4 , la@xmath4 , and lu@xmath9 .    at this point , we shall compare the density reduction of d@xmath5 states in our @xmath0-si films due to the different res .",
    "the density of d@xmath5 states and the @xmath69-value of all the re - doped @xmath0-si and @xmath52-si films considered in this work are shown in figure @xmath72 .",
    "for the present discussion it is important to mention that [ re ] @xmath71  at.% , the @xmath3-crystallization treatment , and p[h@xmath24 ] were all similar .",
    "strikingly , and according to figure @xmath72(a ) we observe : @xmath58 a depletion of d@xmath5 states with re - doping .",
    "this is an unexpected result since the doping of @xmath0-semiconductors is well known to increase the density of defects,@xcite and @xmath62 among all studied re ions , gd@xmath4 and er@xmath4 are the most efficient ones to deplete the density of d@xmath5 states .",
    "these results suggest that this phenomenon is partly caused by the size and/or coordination of the re ions , as exemplified by the density drop of d@xmath5 states by the non - magnetic y@xmath4 , la@xmath4 , and lu@xmath4 ions ( see figure 3 ) .",
    "it is interesting to observe that , as far as the suppresion of the d@xmath5  states is concerned , the doping with non - magnetic re ions induces almost the same effect than the @xmath3-crystallization of the @xmath0-si films ( see figure 3 ) .",
    "moreover , the depletion effect is even more pronounced for the magnetic re ions , gd@xmath4  and er@xmath4 , being stronger for gd@xmath4 .",
    "these results suggest that this @xmath74  depletion efficiency should be related to the spin of the magnetic res and that an exchange - like coupling , @xmath75 between the re@xmath9 spin , @xmath76 , and the spin of the d@xmath5 states , @xmath77 , may be the responsible mechanism .",
    "we argue that such a coupling may shift and broader the d@xmath5 esr line beyond our signal detection limits .",
    "this coupling is usually governed by the de gennes factor @xmath78 $ ] or by the spin factor @xmath79 .",
    "the importance of these factors have been already adviced in re - doped superconductor compounds through the supression of @xmath80 caused by the magnetic re ions .",
    "@xcite @xcite notice that the de gennes and spin factors assume their highest value at the gd@xmath4 ion ( @xmath81 ) , which is in agreement with the results of figure @xmath82(a ) .",
    "these results are also consistent with our recent report on the depletion of neutral dangling bonds , d@xmath5 , by re doping in a - sin films .",
    "@xcite    the analysis of the @xmath69-values displayed in figure @xmath72(b ) leads to interesting conclusions .",
    "the @xmath69-values of the @xmath0-sire films are @xmath83 and those for the @xmath52-sire films @xmath84 @xmath85 , which are close to the @xmath69-value of singly charged si neutral dangling bonds , @xmath86 ( d@xmath5 states).@xcite however , the @xmath0-sier and @xmath52-sier films present @xmath69-values of @xmath87 and @xmath88 , respectively , which are significantly smaller than those of the corresponding series .",
    "these small @xmath69-values seem to be intrinsically associated with the er - doping process itself and suggests that @xmath89-type films @xmath90 @xcite are obtained as a result of the insertion _  _ of er@xmath4 ions .",
    "this is in agreement with the results achieved by other authors .",
    "@xcite@xcite @xcite _  _ the exceptional ability of er@xmath4  to produce @xmath89-type films may suggest that the er@xmath4  ground state multiplet ( @xmath91 ) lies close to the film 's conduction band . the same trend was also observed for the series of @xmath0-sire : h films ( not shown ) .",
    "however , due to the weak d@xmath5 esr signal presented by these films _  _ ( see figure 3 ) it was not possible to accurately determine the @xmath69-values in these films .",
    "figure @xmath30 shows a series of @xmath0-si films doped with gd in the @xmath92 at.% range , as determined from rbs ( see table i ) .",
    "this series was exhaustively studied and for [ gd ] @xmath93 at.% the spectra show a broad ( @xmath7 oe ) and single resonance ( @xmath94 ) associated to a powder - like spectrum of gd@xmath4 .",
    "again , the strong reduction effect that the gd@xmath4 ions exert on the d@xmath5 esr intensity can be appreciated in figure @xmath30 . table",
    "i presents the data for a serie of @xmath95-sigd : h films where it is observed that the gd incorporated in the films decreases as [ h ] increases .",
    "surprisingly , the @xmath69-value and line width , @xmath96 , were independent of the gd@xmath4  concentration , chemical environment ( amorphous or @xmath3-crystallized ) , h content , and temperature for @xmath97  k.  hence , these results demonstrate unambiguously that the gd@xmath4 ions form a very stable complex with si .",
    "films of relatively higher gd concentrations @xmath98 at.%@xmath99 present a line broadening for @xmath100  @xmath101  k , indicating the existence of gd@xmath4- gd@xmath4 magnetic correlations , in agreement with the large @xmath102 measured for these films ( see table i ) . however , in contrast to the work of hellman @xmath103",
    "@xmath104@xcite , low field @xmath105koe zero field and field cooled susceptibility measurements in these films did not show any measurable spin glass - like behaviour down to @xmath106 k.    as stated above , hydrogen atoms in @xmath0-si are known to considerably reduce the density of d@xmath5 states as a result of the passivation of si dangling bonds.@xcite actually , most of the devices based on @xmath0-semiconductors correspond to hydrogenated compounds.@xcite in addition to the passivation of dangling bonds , the insertion of hydrogen in @xmath107-si materials promotes the widening of the optical band gap as a consequence of the recession of the top of the valence band due to the replacement of si - si by si - h bonds .",
    "therefore , the study of the combined effects due to the insertion of re ions and hydrogen atoms in the @xmath0-si host is of outmost importance to our discussion . with this purpose",
    "we have investigated a series of gd - doped @xmath0-si : h films .",
    "figure @xmath108 shows the transmission spectra of some gd - doped @xmath0-si films deposited with increasing hydrogen partial pressures ( table i ) .",
    "according to this figure , films deposited at higher p(h@xmath24 ) exhibit a transmission cutoff at higher energies , an indication that the optical band gap is indeed being increased .",
    "that is shown in the inset of figure @xmath108 where the e@xmath109 optical band gap ( energy corresponding to an absorption coefficient of 10@xmath110 @xmath111 ) is represented as a function of the hydrogen content .",
    "the e@xmath109 optical band gap of other films investigated in the present study are also displayed for comparison .",
    "usually , films deposited with no hydrogen , and after @xmath3-crystallization , present an e@xmath109 optical band gap lower than @xmath112 ev . increasing contents of hydrogen",
    "widen the optical band gap of these films which is proportional to [ h ] .",
    "the doping of @xmath0-si(:h ) films with res has the opposite effect with e@xmath109 values ranging from @xmath113 to @xmath114 ev , depending on the [ re ] .",
    "@xmath27-crystallization experiments also reduce the optical band gap of the re - doped @xmath0-si : h films essentially because of the removal of si - h bonds.@xcite    in addition to hydrogenation , different atomic environments may affect the magnetic properties of the re - doped @xmath0-si films .",
    "thus , it is important to characterize the atomic structure of these films . by means of @xmath2 scattering",
    "we have studied the  @xmath3-induced crystallized films and the main results are displayed in figure @xmath115 . for simplicity , just the spectra of _ c_-si and hydrogenated ( and gd - doped )",
    "@xmath116-si films are presented .",
    "this figure shows that the spectrum of @xmath0-si : h consists of a weak and broad @xmath2 signal at @xmath117 @xmath111 that corresponds to the transverse - optical to - like mode of a highly distorted @xmath0-si network .",
    "@xcite moreover , non - hydrogenated @xmath0-si ( either re - doped or not ) films exhibit ( not shown ) an extremely faint and almost featureless signal characteristic of amorphous quasi - metallic compounds .",
    "the @xmath3-crystallization processing of the @xmath0-sigd(:h ) films gives rise to a relatively strong scattering contribution at @xmath118 @xmath111 indicating the presence of ordered si - si bonds .",
    "based on the position , and line width , of this @xmath2 scattering signal it was possible to infer the size of these so - called crystallites ( or crystalline grains ) which are @xmath119 large.@xcite  notice that , despite the appearance of these crystallites , the films still present some amorphous contribution at @xmath120 @xmath111 indicating that they were not completely crystallized .",
    "the crystallized material was estimated@xcite from the ratio between the areas under the @xmath2 peaks due to crystallites and the amorphous tissue , @xmath121/@xmath122 .",
    "the inset of figure @xmath115 shows @xmath123/@xmath122 for various of our studied films .",
    "interestingly , the crystalline fraction @xmath121/@xmath122 in the @xmath3-crystallized films depends strongly on the presence of re species . according to figure @xmath115 , the @xmath52-sigd",
    ": h films exhibit an amorphous contribution substantially smaller than the @xmath52-si : h films , suggesting that the re species may act as crystallization seeds in the @xmath0-si : h network in a similar manner to that verified in other metal - containing @xmath0-si : h films .",
    "@xcite@xcite however , the crystalization fraction seems to be weaky dependent on the re and [ re ] ( see inset of figure 7 ) .",
    "this result is in agreement with the trends discused above where the presence of res diminish the density of d@xmath5 states in the films .    finally , it is opportune to notice that in spite of the great influence exherted by hydrogenation , re - doping , and @xmath3-crystallization treatment on the optical and structural properties of the studied @xmath0-si films , their magnetic characteristics seem to remain unchanged .",
    "one possible reason for such a behaviour could rely on the formation of very stable re - si complexes which are almost insensitive to the local environment .",
    "this phenomenun is not completely clear at present and more investigations are under way . because the [ o ] in our films were found to be smaller than 0.5 at.% ( rbs )",
    ", the formation of  any stable re - si - o complexes seems to be unlikely .",
    "rare - earth doped amorphous silicon films were prepared by co - sputtering and investigated by different magnetic and spectroscopic techniques ( esr , @xmath1-susceptibility , ion beam analyses , optical transmission , and @xmath2 scattering ) . hydrogenated and @xmath3-crystallized films were also considered in the present study .",
    "the main experimental results are : @xmath58 _  _ re ions are incorporated in the @xmath0-si(:h ) host , predominantly , in the trivalent form , @xmath62 @xmath0-si and @xmath52-si films exhibit d@xmath5 spin densities of @xmath59  cm@xmath23  and @xmath60  cm@xmath23 , respectively , which are strongly reduced by the re - doping . the magnetic gd@xmath9  and er@xmath4  ions present an even stronger density depletion of d@xmath125 states , which led us to suggest an exchange - like coupling between the spin of the magnetic res@xmath4 and the spin of silicon neutral dangling bonds",
    ". we should mention that the same behavior has been consistently observed in a series of a - sin alloys doped with y , la , pr , nd , sm , gd , tb , dy , ho , er , yb , and lu , giving further support to the assumption of the existence of an exchange - like coupling mechanism,@xcite @xmath126  the gd@xmath4 esr line shape , line width , and @xmath69-value does not change with [ gd ] or [ h ] , @xmath35 , nor with the local environment ( if amorphous or partially crystallized ) .",
    "these results suggested the formation of an extremely stable gd - silicon - like complex . at the moment",
    "more research is under way to elucidate this point , and @xmath127 the reduction of the d@xmath5 @xmath69-value in both , @xmath0-sier and @xmath52-sier films , indicates that the er - doping is more efficient in producing @xmath89-type films .",
