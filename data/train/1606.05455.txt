    "despite the fundamental and technological importance , the structure - property relationship in metallic glasses ( mgs ) has long been obscured by their long - range disordered structure@xcite .",
    "a mg often looks microstructurally featureless or  amorphous  under a conventional electron microscope , which is in sharp contrast to crystalline alloys in which grain boundaries , dislocations and many other microstructural features can be readily identified@xcite .",
    "however , recent atomistic simulations @xciteand experiments@xcite indicate that the amorphous structure of glasses is indeed heterogeneous , containing nano - scale elastic@xcite or viscoelastic@xcite imhomogeneities on top of their intrinsic density fluctuation .",
    "unlike the conventional microstructural defects in crystalline alloys , the structural heterogeneities in mgs are dynamic in nature , which are invisible under static electron microscopes but could be theoretically associated with low - frequency vibration modes@xcite or liquid - like regions with very low local viscosities or relaxation times@xcite . in principle , these regions of dynamic heterogeneity are susceptible to irreversible local atomic rearrangements under external perturbations ( stress or heat ) , thus acting as  flow units `` to initiate macroscopic plastic flows@xciteor as ' ' liquid - like sites \" to initiate secondary relaxations in mgs@xcite .",
    "despite the recent efforts confirming the existence of the dynamic heterogeneities in mgs , however , it still remains challenging to derive the mechanical / physical properties of mgs , in a quantitative manner , from the perspective of local structural heterogeneities . on the other hand , through the extensive studies over the past decades@xcite",
    ", various correlations were established between the overall elastic constants of mgs and their many other physical properties .",
    "today , it is commonly thought that the elastic properties of mgs may hold the key to the understanding of many fundamental issues in mgs , such as glass transition@xcite , relaxation@xciteand deformation@xcite .",
    "for example , it was shown that the elastic modulus of a mg is determined by both the atomic bonding strength and the atomic configuration@xcite , which varies with the possible structural change in a mg , as witnessed in a typical structural relaxation@xcite or rejuvenation process@xcite .",
    "moreover , extensive studies also indicate that the poisson s ratio of a mg correlates with the structural state of the corresponding supercooled liquid , as characterized by the liquid fragility@xcite , which in turn affects the ductility of the glass .",
    "as motivated by the fact that the amorphous structure of mgs is overall heterogeneous , we intend to derive relations in this work that connects the elastic constants of mgs to their local structural heterogeneities .",
    "once these relations become available , one may develop important structure - property relations , with the use of the elastic constants as intermediate variables , which ultimately bridge the structural heterogeneity in mgs and their physical and mechanical properties or other attributes .",
    "in principle , the whole structure of an mg can be envisaged as an atomic - scale composite@xcite , consisting the solid - like regions ( slrs ) as a `` matrix '' and isolated soft regions as `` inclusions '' , as schematically shown in figure [ fig1 ] .",
    "the llrs are loosely packed atom regions , and should have the lower elastic moduli ( bulk or shear modulus ) than those of rigid slrs . from the point view of mechanics , llrs can be viewed as elastic imhomogeneities embedded in an isotropic matrix . thus , the effective elastic moduli of the whole structure can be readily obtained from the eshelby s theory@xcite on inhomogeneities . the eshelby s theory",
    "have been extensively used in analyzing the elastic stress field associated with the shear transformation of elementary deformation units@xcite , which are possibly initiated from llrs . here , we consider the static effective elastic modulus of mgs from the eshelby s approach on the elastic inhomogeneities .",
    "suppose that the composite structure is subject to a uniform applied elastic strain field of @xmath2(@xmath3,@xmath4 over 1,2,3 ) by the surface traction , the elastic mismatch between inhomogeneities and the matrix will cause additional stress / strain field , thus leading to an interaction elastic energy .",
    "the effective elastic modulus ( @xmath5 ) is defined from the total elastic energy of the specimen : @xmath6 in eq.[eq1 ] , @xmath7 is the elastic energy of the specimen under a uniform @xmath2 when it is free of inhomogeneities .",
    "@xmath8 is the interaction energy between an inhomogeneity and the external field .",
    "the sum is over all inhomogneities contained in the matrix .",
    "both @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the quadratic functions of @xmath2 .",
    "assume the bulk ( or shear ) modulus of slrs and llrs are @xmath9 ( or @xmath10 ) and @xmath11 ( or @xmath12 ) , respectively , the effective bulk ( @xmath13 ) or shear ( @xmath14 ) modulus for the ssrs - llrs assembly is derived as ( see the theoretical analysis in supplementary text i ) : @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the volume fraction of llrs , @xmath9 and @xmath10 should have values close to that of ideal glasses .",
    "@xmath17 and @xmath18 are two coefficients associated with the discrepancy of elastic moduli between slrs and llrs . it should be noted here that the elastic moduli of llrs in real structure of mgs are not uniform and might have a distribution spectrum , however , the current theoretical approach is still valid from a mean - field sense if @xmath11 or @xmath12 is viewed as the mean value of bulk modulus and shear modulus of llrs distributed in mgs , respectively . for spherical llrs , @xmath19 and @xmath18 read@xcite : @xmath20 where @xmath21 and @xmath22 are two parameters depending on the poisson s ratio of the matrix , @xmath23 : @xmath24 , @xmath25 .",
    "@xmath17 and @xmath18 usually have positive values due to elastic softening of llrs compared with slrs ( @xmath26 , @xmath27 ) .",

    "[ eq2]-[eq4 ] in fact establish general relations between the macroscopic elastic properties and the characteristics of microscopic structural heterogeneities in mgs . from these relations",
    ", one can generally found that the overall elastic moduli of mgs do not follows the conventional `` rule of mixtures '' , i.e. the weighted average of elastic moduli of slrs and llrs .",
    "this is unexpected since the rule is often commonly used in previous studies when estimating the elastic properties of mgs or composite materials@xcite . to facilitate discussion , we define @xmath30 , @xmath31 , which reflect the elastic softening degree of llr compared with slrs . in general ,",

    "the extent that @xmath13 or @xmath14 decrease at a certain @xmath16 depends on the specific value of @xmath32 or @xmath33 : the larger the @xmath32 or @xmath33 is , the more steeply the @xmath13 or @xmath14 drops . while the poisson s ratio could either decrease or increase with @xmath16 , depending on specific values of @xmath32 and @xmath33 . based on this",

    ", we developed a model by considering the reduction of llrs both on their numbers and size during annealing ( see supplementary text ii ) .",
    "the theoretical analysis shows that the small values of @xmath80 ( @xmath103 ) mainly result from one - dimensional reduction of llr size during annealing . besides , the deviation of @xmath80 from @xmath104 is indicative of the spatial heterogeneity of llr annihilation dynamics in mgs .     the calculated volume fraction of llrs , @xmath16 , versus with the annealing time @xmath75 for vit105 based on the measured shear modulus @xmath14 .",

    "for example , the poisson s ratio was shown to correlate well with the ductility or plasticity in mgs@xcite , i.e. the larger plasticity favors the higher poisson s ratio .",
    "now , the correlation can be well understood from our analysis . from eq .",
    "[ eq4 ] , one can see that the higher poisson s ratio corresponds to the more significant structural heterogeneities of mgs , i.e. the larger volume fraction and the larger shear modulus softening of llrs as well as the higher poisson s ratio of the slr matrix , factors all beneficial to the plasticity of mgs .",
    "it is also worth noting that the poisson s ratio criterion for plasticity can not be applied to mgs ( such as the ce - based mg in our present work ) where the bulk modulus softening is much larger than shear modulus softening in llrs , resulting in the decrease of poisson s ratio with the volume fraction of llrs .",
    "this may explain that the anomalous improved plasticity is achieved at lower poisson s ratio reported in some fe - based mgs@xcite .",
    "in addition , our present results could also be used to interpret the correlation between the poisson s ratio in mgs and the fragility of their corresponding glass - forming liquids@xcite .",
    "it was once shown that the larger possion s ratio or the ratio of shear modulus to bulk modulus in the glass often corresponds to the more fragile behavior of the liquid .",
    "novikov et al@xciteinterpreted the correlation from a non - ergodicity parameter , which determines the amplitude of fluctuations frozen at @xmath59 and thus relates the fast relaxation dynamics of a liquid to the ratio of shear modulus to bulk modulus in the glass state . here",
    ", we could provide another interpretion on this correlation from the aspect of structural heterogeneities of glasses .",
    "recent experimental studies@xcite found that the fragility parameter , @xmath105 , reflects the configuration change rate in the potential energy landscape of a liquid , and thus directly related with the temperature dependence of shear modulus softening around the glass transition .",
    "a collection of available experimental data on different kind of glasses@xcite have showed that the larger shear modulus softening rate at @xmath59 corresponds to the more fragile liquid or the larger value of @xmath105 .",
    "since llrs can be regarded as the `` residual liquid '' in the structure of mg solids quenched from the liquid , it can be inferred that the liquid fragility is related to the shear modulus softening degree of llrs as compared to slrs in mgs .",
    "meanwhile , provided that the volume fraction of llrs is fixed , the large shear modulus softening degree of llrs indicates a large value of poisson s ratio from our current analysis . by this way",
    ", the fragility of a liquid can be linked to the poisson s ratio of the glass solids quenched from the liquid .",
    "the details for origin of the correlation deserve a further study along this line .",
    "in summary , we established a quantitative link between overall elastic properties and local structural heterogeneities in mgs .",
    "general formulas for elastic moduli were derived from characteristics of structural hetergeneities from the eshelby s theory and are verified by experimental results obtained from structural relaxation of various mgs .",
    "particularly , we revealed that the decrease of poisson s ratio upon annealing of mgs is associated with a much large shear softening over hydrostatic - pressure softening , and vice versa in local soft regions .",

    "<S> the common notion suggests that metallic glasses ( mgs ) are a homogeneous solid at the macroscopic scale ; however , recent experiments and simulations indicate that mgs contain nano - scale elastic heterogeneities . despite the fundamental importance of these findings </S>",

    "<S> s theory , here we develop a micromechanical model that correlates the properties of the local elastic heterogeneities , being very difficult to measure experimentally , to the measurable overall elastic properties of mgs , such as shear / bulk modulus and poisson s ratio . our theoretical modeling is verified by the experimental data obtained from various mgs annealed to different degrees . </S>",
    "<S> particularly , we revealed that the decrease of poisson s ratio upon annealing of mgs is associated with a much large shear softening over hydrostatic - pressure softening , and @xmath0 @xmath1 in local elastic inhomogeneities . </S>",
    "<S> the relative extent of the bulk versus shear modulus softens is extracted for different mgs , and is found to closely depend on the specific composition and their ductility . </S>",
    "<S> the implication of our results on the poisson s ratio criterion on the ductility as well as the aging dynamics in mgs is discussed . </S>"
