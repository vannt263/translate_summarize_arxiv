    "a new higgs - like boson around @xmath5gev has just been discovered at the lhc  @xcite .",
    "although its properties are not well measured yet , it complies with the expected behaviour and therefore it is a very compelling candidate to be the standard model ( sm ) higgs .",
    "an obvious question to address is to which extent alternative scenarios of electroweak symmetry breaking ( ewsb ) can be already discarded or strongly constrained . in particular , what are the implications for strongly - coupled models where the electroweak symmetry is broken dynamically ?",
    "the existing phenomenological tests have confirmed the @xmath6 pattern of symmetry breaking , giving rise to three goldstone bosons which , in the unitary gauge , become the longitudinal polarizations of the gauge bosons .",
    "when the @xmath7 coupling @xmath8 is neglected , the electroweak goldstone dynamics is described at low energies by the same lagrangian as the qcd pions , replacing the pion decay constant by the ewsb scale @xmath9gev  @xcite .",
    "contrary to the sm , in strongly - coupled scenarios the symmetry is nonlinearly realized and one expects the appearance of massive resonances generated by the non - perturbative interaction .",
    "the dynamics of goldstones and massive resonance states can be analyzed in a generic way by using an effective lagrangian , based on symmetry considerations .",
    "the theoretical framework is completely analogous to the resonance chiral theory description of qcd at gev energies  @xcite . using these techniques , we investigated in ref .  @xcite the oblique @xmath0 parameter  @xcite , characterizing the electroweak boson self - energies , within higgsless strongly - coupled models . adopting a dispersive approach and imposing a proper uv behaviour ,",
    "it was shown there that it is possible to calculate @xmath0 at the next - to - leading order , _",
    "i.e. _ , at one - loop .",
    "we found that in most strongly - coupled scenarios of ewsb a high resonance mass scale is required , @xmath10tev , to satisfy the stringent experimental limits .",
    "the recent discovery of a higgs - like boson makes mandatory to update the analysis , including the light - scalar contributions .",
    "in addition , we will also present a corresponding one - loop calculation of the oblique @xmath1 parameter , which allows us to perform a correlated analysis of both quantities .",
    "@xmath0 measures the difference between the off - diagonal @xmath11 correlator and its sm value , while @xmath1 parametrizes the breaking of custodial symmetry  @xcite .",
    "more precisely , @xmath1 measures the difference between the @xmath12 and @xmath13 correlators , subtracting the sm contribution .",
    "the explicit definitions of @xmath0 and @xmath1 are given in refs .",
    "previous one - loop analyses can be found in refs .",
    "we have considered a low - energy effective theory containing the sm gauge bosons coupled to the electroweak goldstones , one light scalar state @xmath14 with mass @xmath15  gev and the lightest vector and axial - vector resonance multiplets @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "we only assume the sm pattern of ewsb , _",
    "i.e. _ the theory is symmetric under @xmath18 and becomes spontaneously broken to the diagonal subgroup @xmath19 .",
    "@xmath14 is taken to be singlet under @xmath19 , while @xmath16 and @xmath17 are triplets ( singlet vector and axial - vector contributions are absent at the order we are working ) . to build the lagrangian we only consider operators with the lowest number of derivatives , as higher - derivative terms are either proportional to the equations of motion or tend to violate the expected short - distance behaviour of the green s functions  @xcite .",
    "we will need the interactions @xmath20 \\!{\\,\\rangle}\\nonumber \\\\ & & \\mbox { } + \\sqrt{2}\\ , \\lambda_1^{sa}\\ ,   \\partial_\\mu s_1 \\ , { \\langle \\,}\\ ! a^{\\mu \\nu } u_\\nu \\!{\\,\\rangle}\\ , , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] plus the standard gauge boson and resonance kinetic terms .",
    "the three goldstone fields @xmath21 are parametrized through the matrix @xmath22 , @xmath23 with @xmath24 the appropriate gauge - covariant derivative , and @xmath25 stands for the trace of the @xmath26 matrix @xmath27 .",
    "we follow the notation from ref .  @xcite . the first term in ( [ eq : lagrangian ] )",
    "gives the goldstone lagrangian , present in the sm , plus the scalar - goldstone interactions . for @xmath28",
    "one recovers the @xmath29 vertex of the sm .",
    "the calculation will be performed in the landau gauge , which eliminates the mixing between goldstones and gauge bosons .",
    "the oblique parameter @xmath0 receives tree - level contributions from vector and axial - vector exchanges @xcite , while @xmath1 is identically zero at lowest - order ( lo ) : @xmath30 to compute the one - loop contributions we use the dispersive representation of @xmath0 introduced by peskin and takeuchi  @xcite , whose convergence requires a vanishing spectral function at short distances : @xmath31\\ , , \\ ] ] with @xmath32 the spectral function of the @xmath11 correlator  @xcite .",
    "we work at lowest order in @xmath33 and @xmath8 and only the lightest two - particle cuts have been considered , _",
    "i.e. _ two goldstones or one goldstone plus one scalar resonance . @xmath34 and",
    "@xmath35 contributions were shown to be very suppressed in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the calculation of @xmath1 is simplified by noticing that , up to corrections of @xmath36 , @xmath37 where @xmath38 and @xmath39 are the wave - function renormalization constants of the charged and neutral goldstone bosons computed in the landau gauge  @xcite .",
    "a further simplification occurs by setting to zero @xmath33 , which does not break the custodial symmetry , so only the @xmath40-boson exchange produces an effect in @xmath1 .",
    "this approximation captures the lowest order contribution to @xmath1 in its expansion in powers of @xmath33 and @xmath8 .",
    "again only the lowest two - particle cuts have been considered , _",
    "i.e. _ the @xmath40 boson plus one goldstone or one scalar resonance .    fig .",
    "[ nlo_graphs ] shows the computed one - loop contributions to @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "requiring the @xmath41 correlator to vanish at high energies implies also a good convergence of the goldstone self - energies , at least for the two - particle cuts we have considered .",
    "therefore their difference obeys an unsubtracted dispersion relation , which enables us to also compute @xmath1 through the dispersive integral , @xmath42 \\ , , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath43 the spectral function of the difference of the neutral and charged goldstone self - energies .",
    "fixing the scalar mass to @xmath44  gev , we have 7 undetermined parameters : @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "the number of unknown couplings can be reduced using short - distance information .    assuming that weak isospin and parity are good symmetries of the strong dynamics , the @xmath41 correlator is proportional to the difference of the vector and axial - vector two - point green s functions  @xcite . in asymptotically - free gauge theories",
    "this difference vanishes at @xmath52 as @xmath53 @xcite , implying two super - convergent sum rules , known as the first and second weinberg sum rules ( wsrs )  @xcite , which at lo give the relations @xmath54 this determines @xmath47 and @xmath49 in terms of the resonance masses , leading to @xmath55 since the wsrs also imply @xmath56 , this prediction turns out to be bounded by  @xcite @xmath57 it is likely that the first wsr is also true in gauge theories with non - trivial ultraviolet fixed points  @xcite whilst the second wsr is questionable in some scenarios . if only the first wsr is considered , but still assuming the hierarchy @xmath56 , one obtains the lower bound  @xcite @xmath58 the possibility of an inverted mass ordering of the vector and axial - vector resonances  @xcite would turn this lower bound into the upper bound @xmath59 .",
    "note that if the splitting of the vector and axial - vector resonances was small , the prediction of @xmath60 would be close to the bound .    at the next - to - leading order ( nlo )",
    "the computed @xmath41 correlator should also satisfy the proper short - distance behaviour .",
    "the @xmath61 and @xmath62 spectral functions would have an unphysical grow at large momentum transfer unless @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",
    "the first constraint guarantees a well - behaved vector form factor @xcite , while the second relates the axial and scalar couplings .",
    "once these relations are enforced , the goldstone self - energies are convergent enough to allow for an unambiguous determination of @xmath1 in terms of masses and @xmath50 . neglecting terms of @xmath65 , @xmath66   \\ , ,",
    "\\label{eq : t}\\ ] ] where @xmath67 is the sm reference higgs mass adopted to define @xmath0 and @xmath1 . notice that taking @xmath68 and @xmath69 ( the sm value ) , @xmath1 vanishes when @xmath70 as it should .    to enforce the second wsr at nlo one needs the additional constraint @xmath71 ( constrained to the range @xmath72 ) .",
    "one can then obtain a nlo determination of @xmath0 in terms of @xmath45 and @xmath46 : @xmath73 \\,,\\quad \\label{eq.1 + 2wsr}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where terms of @xmath65 have been neglected .",
    "taking @xmath68 , the correction to the lo result vanishes when @xmath70 ( @xmath28 ) ; in this limit , the nlo prediction reaches the lo upper bound in eq .",
    "( [ slotwowsr ] ) .",
    "if only the first wsr is considered , one can still obtain a lower bound at nlo in terms of @xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath50 : @xmath74   , \\label{eq.lower - bound-1wsr}\\ ] ] where @xmath75 has been assumed and we have neglected again terms of @xmath65 . with @xmath68 , the nlo correction vanishes in the combined limit @xmath28 and @xmath70 , where the lo lower bound ( [ eq.lo-s+1wsr ] ) is recovered .",
    "taking the sm reference point at @xmath76 gev , the global fit to precision electroweak data gives the results @xmath77 and @xmath78 , with a correlation coefficient of @xmath79  @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ fig.2wsr ] we show the compatibility between these `` experimental '' values and our nlo determinations imposing the two wsrs : eq .",
    "( [ eq : t ] ) with @xmath80 and eq .",
    "( [ eq.1 + 2wsr ] ) .",
    "notice that the line with @xmath81 ( @xmath82 ) coincides with the lo upper bound in  ( [ slotwowsr ] ) , while the @xmath83 curve reproduces the lower bound in eq .",
    "( [ eq.lower-bound-1wsr ] ) in the same limit .",
    "thus , a vanishing scalar - goldstone coupling ( @xmath84 ) would be incompatible with the data , independently of whether the second wsr has been assumed .",
    "[ fig.2wsr ] shows a very important result in the two - wsr scenario : with @xmath15  gev , the precision electroweak data requires that the higgs - like scalar should have a @xmath3 coupling very close to the sm one . at 68% ( 95% )",
    "cl , one gets @xmath85 $ ] ( @xmath86 $ ] ) , in nice agreement with the present lhc evidence @xcite , but much more restrictive .",
    "moreover , the vector and axial - vector states should be very heavy ( and quite degenerate ) ; one finds @xmath87  tev ( @xmath88  tev ) at 68% ( 95% ) cl .",
    "this conclusion is softened when the second wsr is dropped and the lower bound in eq .",
    "( [ eq.lower-bound-1wsr ] ) is used instead .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig.1wsr ] , which gives the allowed 68% cl region in the space of parameters @xmath45 and @xmath50 , varying @xmath90 between 0 and 1 .",
    "note , however , that values of @xmath50 very different from the sm can only be obtained with a large splitting of the vector and axial - vector masses .",
    "in general there is no solution for @xmath91 . requiring @xmath92 ,",
    "leads to @xmath93 at 68% cl , while the allowed vector mass stays above 1  tev  @xcite .",
    "taking instead @xmath94 , one gets the stronger constraints @xmath95 and @xmath96  tev . in order to allow vector masses below the tev scale",
    ", one needs a much larger resonance - mass splitting , so that the nlo term in ( [ eq.lower-bound-1wsr ] ) proportional to @xmath97 compensates the growing of the lo vector contribution .",
    "the mass splitting gives also an additive contribution to @xmath1 of the form @xmath98 , making lower values of @xmath50 possible for smaller @xmath45 .",
    "however , the limit @xmath99 can only be approached when @xmath100 .    in summary , strongly - coupled electroweak models with massive resonance states are still allowed by the current experimental data . nonetheless , the recently discovered higgs - like boson with mass @xmath44  gev must have a @xmath3 coupling close to the sm one ( @xmath28 ) . in those scenarios , such as asymptotically - free theories , where the second wsr is satisfied ,",
    "the @xmath0 and @xmath1 constraints force @xmath50 to be in the range @xmath101 $ ] at 95% cl .",
    "larger departures of the sm value can be accommodated when the second wsr does not apply , but one needs to introduce a correspondingly large mass splitting between the vector and axial - vector states .",
    "similar conclusions can be obtained within more specific models , particularizing our general framework .",
    "for instance , let us mention the recent phenomenological analyses of vector and axial - vector states within the @xmath4 minimal composite higgs model  @xcite . in this context",
