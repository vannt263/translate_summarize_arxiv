    "since the evanescent field strength is sufficiently weak at the radial distance of about @xmath7@xmath8 away from the surface of the nanofiber@xcite , each adjacent nanofiber pairs located at such a distance will not lead to an efficient overlap of different cavity modes , which guarantees that the @xmath9th ensemble of cs rydberg atoms can interact only with the @xmath9th cavity@xcite .    by using the red- and blue - detuned evanescent light fields around the optical nanofiber",
    ", a two - color optical dipole trap can be formed .",
    "this optical dipole trap should allow an ensemble of cs rydberg atoms to be prepared at a few hundred nanometers from the nanofiber surfacekien , goban . for cs rydberg atoms , we can choose the fine - structure states @xmath10 and @xmath11 as the ground state @xmath12 and the intermediate state @xmath13 , respectively , while the rydberg state is assumed as @xmath14 .",
    "as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2](b ) , the photon induced by the evanescent field , with wavelength @xmath15 nm , governs the transition between the ground state @xmath12 and the intermediate state @xmath13 , whereas the other transition between the intermediate state @xmath13 and the rydberg state @xmath16 is controlled by a classical driving laser , with wavelength @xmath17 nm , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] .    formally , the total hamiltonian of the system considered in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] is @xmath18 in the hamiltonian ( [ h ] ) , @xmath19 describes the interaction between the photons and the ensemble of cs rydberg atoms for all nanofiber photonic crystal cavities .",
    "we first consider the interaction between the photon and a single three - level cs rydberg atom at one cavity . in the current experimental setups@xcite ,",
    "the interaction between photons and the single cs rydberg atom is of the order of mhz ( the detailed estimation will be shown in the next subsection ) .",

    "when the detuning is large , we can adiabatically eliminate the intermediate state @xmath13 , and rewrite the hamiltonian ( [ h1 ] ) via a unitary transformation as@xmath30where @xmath31 is the effective photon frequency , @xmath32 is the effective transition frequency of the two - level rydberg atom , @xmath33 is the effective interaction strength , and @xmath34 @xmath35 . for large detuning , @xmath36 is very small and we thus can omit the interaction term @xmath37 .",

    "for simplicity , we also assume that the number of cs rydberg atoms in each cavity is a constant @xmath39 .",
    "the strong van der waals repulsive interaction between cs rydberg atoms in the same cavity generates a rydberg - blocked effect , which excites only one cs rydberg atom@xcite . in such case , we should introduce the collective ground state @xmath40 , and the collective excitation state @xmath41 .    thus , the first term of the hamiltonian ( [ h ] ) becomes@xmath42 .",

    "the long - range van der waals interaction can induce a strong correlation between cs rydberg atoms in different cavities .",
    "hereafter , we use the nearest - neighbor interaction to represent the entire van der waals interaction , i.e. , @xmath50 , because @xmath51 , and @xmath52 , @xmath53 . in the last term of the hamiltonian ( [ h ] ) ,",

    "it should be noted that a dielectric medium placed near dipoles will alter the spatial distribution of the electromagnetic field .",
    "however , for the parameters of the nanofiber and cs rydberg atoms considered here , this alteration can be regarded as a higher - order small quantity , compared with the direct atom - atom interaction@xcite .",
    "this allows us to safely treat the interaction between cs rydberg atoms in different cavities as the standard long - range van der waals force .      before proceeding",
    ", we estimate the relevant parameters of the hamiltonian ( [ h ] ) in terms of the above proposal .    * the effective photon frequency @xmath31 and the effective atom transition frequency @xmath55 .",

    "both the cavity decay rate and the photon hopping rate can be controlled by changing the cavity length .",
    "the above parameters show two basic features : @xmath93 and @xmath94 .",
    "the condition @xmath93 implies that we may safely neglect the influence of the decay of both cavity and atom , because these only change slightly the phase boundaries@xcite .",
    "in addition , using the above parameters , we also estimate that the atomic number density of each cavity is of the order of @xmath95 @xmath96 .",
    "for such a typical density , the dephasing time of the collective states @xmath97 and @xmath98 , which are induced by the atomic collision , can , at least , reach the order of microseconds .",
    "this is much larger than the time scales of @xmath99  and @xmath100 , and can thus be neglectedrait , rolf .",
    "this guarantees the validity of our effective two - level model in eq .",

    "we now construct a strong plrri in terms of the hamiltonian @xmath101 .",
    "we begin to address the simplest case , @xmath102 , in which the hamiltonian ( [ h1 ] ) reduces to @xmath103the eigenstates of the hamiltonian @xmath104 are given by @xmath105for @xmath106 , and @xmath107for @xmath108 , where @xmath109 and @xmath110 is the detuning .",
    "the corresponding eigenvalues are @xmath111 and @xmath112since here we investigate the lower - energy behavior , only the lower polariton branch @xmath113 is considered@xcite .",

    "the second term of the hamiltonian @xmath104 leads to an even distribution of polaritons , which provides an effective on - site repulsive interaction between photons@xcite .",
    "when @xmath116 , the rotating - wave approximation is reasonable , and thus the hopping term becomes @xmath117where @xmath118  and @xmath119 , with @xmath120 .",
    "in addition , since the upper polariton branch @xmath121has the higher probability of rydberg excitation ( stronger repulsive interaction ) , we also only consider the projection of the van der waals interaction into the lower polariton branch @xmath113 .",
    "thus , the corresponding hamiltonian becomes @xmath122where @xmath123is the effective interaction strength .",
    "since @xmath124 , and moreover , @xmath94 , eq .  ( [ plrri ] ) demonstrates explicitly that the van der waals interaction generates a strong plrri .",
    "as will be shown below , this strong plrri leads to non - trivial quantum phases exhibiting photon solid states .",
    "we investigate quantum phases and phase diagrams by perturbation theory and a mapping into an effective hamiltonian .",
    "for instance , when the chemical potential @xmath3 is weak , the high - occupancy - photon states ( @xmath125 ) of the hamiltonian ( [ h1 ] ) are not considered .",
    "in such case , we rewrite the hamiltonian ( [ h1 ] ) in a reduced hilbert space , with @xmath126 , as @xmath127where @xmath128 , @xmath129 , and @xmath130 is the single - particle energy of the @xmath131 state .",
    "this effective photon hopping rate @xmath132  can be easily tuned by the detuning @xmath133 , since @xmath134 .",
    "in addition , for the low - energy effective hamiltonian ( [ heff ] ) , it is convenient to introduce a renormalized nearest - neighbor van der waals interaction @xmath135  to simplify the discussions about phase diagrams , as shown below .",
    "we first consider the case without photon hopping ( @xmath136 ) . at the initial time , we assume that every cavity is in its vacuum state , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3](a ) . when increasing the chemical potential @xmath3 , photons in some cavities can be excited , due to the existence of the plrri ( without the plrri , all cavities are excited identically@xcite ) , and some @xmath137 states emerges , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3](b ) .",
    "the corresponding critical point is @xmath138derived from @xmath139 .",
    "since the @xmath140 states are generated one by one and deviate from each other , the system exhibits photon solid states , which are mainly governed by different filling factors @xmath141with @xmath142 and @xmath143 being both integers . in order to quantitatively determine the filling factor @xmath144 , we introduce @xmath145 and @xmath146 , where @xmath147 is the position of the @xmath9th @xmath137 state and @xmath146 is the distance to the @xmath148th next @xmath140 state , satisfying @xmath146 @xmath149 .",
    "when the ground - state energy is minimized for all sites , we have @xmath150where @xmath151 , and satisfy the relationhubbard , pokrovsky @xmath152 in eq .",
    "( [ r2 ] ) , @xmath153  is the total number of cavities . for",
    "a given filling state , the repulsive interaction energy of the @xmath140 states can be estimated by applying the relations in eqs .",
    "( [ r1])-([r2 ] ) to the hamiltonian ( [ heff ] ) .",
    "moreover , the corresponding phases are stable if it costs energy to add or remove a particle and rearrange the structure .",
    "we define the photon solid phase , with the filling factor @xmath144 , as @xmath154 .",
    "if we add one @xmath140 state , @xmath155 becomes @xmath156 and the @xmath137  states are crowded .",
    "to minimize the repulsive energy , the summation of distances between the @xmath137  states must be a minimum .",
    "thus , the most likely rearrangement structure is that some pairs of the adjacent @xmath137  states are shortened by one site@xcite . by considering the periodic boundary condition and relations in eqs .",
    "( [ r1])-([r2 ] ) , @xmath157 @xmath140 state pairs with @xmath158 @xmath159 must be replaced by @xmath159 @xmath137 state pairs with @xmath160 .",
    "in addition , at the phase - transition point , there is no energy gap@xcite between @xmath155 and @xmath161 , i.e. , @xmath162 , and the critical point is thus obtained by @xmath163 + \\label{u1 } \\\\ & & \\sum_{k=1}\\left [ kqj_{\\parallel } ( kq-1)-\\left ( kq-1\\right ) j_{\\parallel } ( kq)\\right ] ,   \\notag\\end{aligned}\\]]where @xmath164  is any integer ( see methods section ) .",
    "similarly , if we remove one @xmath137 state , @xmath155 turns into @xmath165 , and the corresponding critical point is given by ( see methods section ) @xmath166 + \\label{u2 } \\\\ & & \\sum_{k=1}\\left [ \\left ( kq+1\\right ) j_{\\parallel } ( kq)-kqj_{\\parallel } ( kq+1)\\right ] .",

    "[ fig4](a ) , we plot the filling factor @xmath144 as a function of the chemical potential @xmath3  and the renormalized effective strength @xmath176 of the van der waals interaction , in terms of the obtained @xmath167 and @xmath168 in eqs .",
    "( [ u1 ] ) and  ( [ u2 ] ) . for @xmath177 , @xmath178 ,",
    "as expected [ see the red solid line in fig .",
    "[ fig4](a ) ] . however , the results for finite @xmath179  [ for example , @xmath180 ; see the black dashed line in fig .",
    "[ fig4](a ) ] are very interesting .",
    "when increasing @xmath3 , @xmath144 is not a constant , but varies jumpily  from @xmath181 , @xmath182 , @xmath183 , @xmath175 , @xmath174 , @xmath184 , to @xmath183 .",
    "the reason is that when increasing @xmath3 , @xmath185 decreases , and excitation of the cavities is thus favorable .",
    "this behavior clearly shows a devil s staircase@xcite .",
    "moreover , this devil s staircase could be detected experimentally by measuring the mean - photon number @xmath186 , since @xmath187 , and thus here called the _",
    "photon devil s",
    "staircase_. however , when increasing @xmath179 , @xmath188  varies jumpily from high to low because the plrri prevents the photon excitation .",
    "recently , the photon nearest - neighbor interaction was studied and a photon solid state was predicted@xcite . in that case , the @xmath189  symmetry , translated by one site , has been broken .",
    "here the plrrl generates a long - range translation symmetry , whose breaking induces the photon devil s staircase .",
    "moreover , it leads to other non - trivial phases when the photon hopping exists .",
    "notice that between the adjacent photon solid phases , with @xmath190  and @xmath191 , respectively , there are many transition states which have different numbers of defects .",
    "here we define the pairs of the @xmath131  states with shorter ( longer ) distance as a particle- ( hole- ) like defect structure .",
    "since these states have very small stability intervals , they should be hard to observe when @xmath136 , and thus not plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig3](b ) .",
    "however , when @xmath192 , they play an important role for the ground - state properties , because of the motion of the defects , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3](c ) .",
    "especially , when the hopping energy is negative , the states with defects may be more stable than the adjacent photon solid states .",
    "thus , the photon solid phases melt and a photon - floating solid phase@xcite can emerge . in general , it is difficult to fully characterize this process .",
    "however , in the region close to the phase - transition point , the repulsive interaction between the defects only allow one defect .",
    "thus , the phase boundary can be estimated by comparing the energy of the photon solid state @xmath193  with that of the state with one defect . using a perturbative method",
    ", we obtain the following phase boundaries ( see methods section ) : @xmath194    equation ( [ b1 ] ) shows that the hopping energies of the defects reduce the regions where the photon solid phases exist , because @xmath195  @xmath196 .",
    "in particular , when @xmath197 , @xmath198  @xmath199 , and thus the energy bands of the particle- and hole - like defect states cross and the photon solid phases can not exist .",
    "this is the reason why only the photon solid phases , with @xmath200  and @xmath201 , can emerge in fig .",
    "[ fig4](b ) . from fig .",
    "[ fig4](b ) , we also see that the regions where the photon solid phases exist are very small , and are melted for a smaller @xmath202 ( @xmath203 ) .",
    "this implies that the hopping term can be treated as a perturbation .",
    "so the results from the phase boundaries in eq .",
    "( [ b1 ] ) are reasonable . strictly speaking , in the photon - floating solid phase ,",
    "the total number of the @xmath140 states is sensitive to the fluctuation of the parameters , and also @xmath144 and @xmath186 are hard to calculate in that phase .",
    "recently , the quantum monte carlo method has been used to solve this problem@xcite . when @xmath177 , the photon - floating solid phase disappears [ see the blue line in fig .  [ fig4](b ) ]",
    ".      finally , we address the case of a strong chemical potential @xmath3 , in which the higher - photon - occupancy states in some cavities can occur , and moreover , the single - particle energy of the @xmath204 state , @xmath205 , is close to that of the @xmath140 state , @xmath206 , ( here we omit the case @xmath207 ) . in this case , there are three kinds of repulsive interactions : between the @xmath208  and @xmath137  states , between the @xmath204  and @xmath209  states , and between the @xmath140  and @xmath204  states . moreover , the photon hopping has two channels , from the @xmath210to @xmath137  states and from the @xmath131  to @xmath204  states .",
    "these two channels are very complex . however , in the resonant case ( @xmath211 ) , @xmath212 , and @xmath213 is thus independent of @xmath214 .",
    "this indicates that the photon numbers of the excited cavities are only determined by @xmath206 and @xmath205 .",
    "when the plrri is not sufficiently strong , the lattice can be fully filled in the weak-@xmath3  region . in this region , @xmath215 , and",
    "the ground state , still governed by the hamiltonian ( [ heff ] ) , is thus composed of the @xmath210 and @xmath140 states . by increasing @xmath3 , @xmath144 increases from @xmath216 and reaches @xmath217 . further increasing @xmath3 ,",
    "all cavities can be excited with uniform photon numbers , which is similar to that of the standard jaynes - cummings - hubbard model , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig5](a ) .",
    "however , there is a non - trivial case for a strong plrri , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig5](b ) . in such case",
    ", the photon solid phases can exist in the strong-@xmath3  region .",
    "but we can not ensure that the lattice is fully filled by the @xmath137 states , due to inversion of @xmath185 and @xmath205 .",
    "this process can be determined by comparing @xmath218 , obtained by making @xmath178  in @xmath219 , with the other critical point @xmath220 ( the degenerate point of @xmath221 and @xmath222 ) . when @xmath223 , @xmath224 , and there is a transition from the @xmath137  to @xmath225 states in the excited cavities .",
    "thus , this transition induces a new crystalline configuration , which is composed of the @xmath210  and @xmath204 states .",
    "the corresponding low - energy behavior is governed by a new effective hamiltonian @xmath226where @xmath227 ,  and @xmath228 . since @xmath229the photon hopping is always frozen even if @xmath88 exists .",
    "we denote the corresponding phase as the _ photon - frozen solid phase_. in this phase , the fractional filling structure of the @xmath230 states is robust , i.e. , it is not easily destroyed by the photon hopping . in terms of the hamiltonian ( [ neh ] ) , when further increasing @xmath3 to satisfy @xmath231 , the lattice can be fully filled by the @xmath230 states , as shown in fig .  [ fig5](b ) .",
    "in summary , we have achieved a strong plrri by controlling the van der waals interaction of rydberg atoms located in different cavities in extended jaynes - cummings - hubbard lattices , and then predicted novel quantum phases . since the atom - cavity polariton can be easily controlled experimentallyfb07,mp14 , our proposal offers a new way to control the interaction between individual photons .",
    "in addition , our proposal might help to explore rich many - body phenomena of light and quantum nonlinear optics , as well as potential applications to quantum information and computing .",
    "we have described the low - energy behavior of the hamiltonian ( [ h ] ) by an effective hamiltonian ( [ heff ] ) . moreover ,",
    "we have also pointed out that when @xmath136 , there is a succession of photon crystal states with different filling factors , denoted as a photon devil s staircase structure , and the energy gap of the photon crystal states can be calculated in terms of eqs .",
